gas face some hurdles -- including from Trump and the petroleum
industry," The Conversation, 04-11-2025, accessed 07-05-2025,

The second [Trump]{.underline} administration has [launched the next
stage in the]{.underline} half-century-long [battle between commerce and
conservation over Alaskan oil and gas development]{.underline}. But [its
moves are delivering a **mixed message** to the petroleum
industry]{.underline}.

[The administration has]{.underline} opened -- or [reopened]{.underline}
-- [large swaths of government land in Alaska to oil and gas
drilling]{.underline}, though [only some]{.underline} of those
opportunities [have drawn]{.underline} much [commercial
interest]{.underline} in recent years. And an 800-mile pipeline across
Alaska that the administration says it supports is not yet funded, and
other administration policies risk turning off prospective partners.

President Donald Trump says he wants to grow oil and gas production and
advance the goal of what he calls U.S. "energy dominance." The White
House says that term means both reducing the amount of energy imported
from other countries and increasing the amount of energy exported from
the U.S., especially to allies.

The U.S. is already the world's largest producer and exporter of natural
gas as well as the largest producer of crude oil. And the nation's oil
industry boomed under the Biden administration. However, the U.S. does
import an average of over 6 million barrels per day of crude oil, most
of it from Canada.

[Trump's efforts seek to boost U.S. production]{.underline} to still
greater heights [by expanding access to areas for drilling
and]{.underline} building [related infrastructure]{.underline}. But as a
former petroleum geoscientist and industry observer, I would suggest
[his various actions]{.underline}, taken as a whole, [may have **more
limited effects than he seems to hope**]{.underline}.

Returned to leasing

In one of his first executive orders after retaking office on Jan. 20,
2025, Trump declared that the U.S. would develop Alaska's petroleum
resources "to the fullest extent possible."

The Biden administration had banned oil leasing in three areas of
Alaska. One was all but 400,000 acres in the coastal plain portion of
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Another was a 13-million-acre swath
of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, a massive parcel of federal
land west of the refuge. The third area was 44 million acres of the
offshore coastal portion of the northern Bering Sea, based on concerns
for tribal rights and the migration routes of marine mammals.

Trump moved quickly to reverse all these bans, describing them as an
"assault on Alaska's sovereignty and its ability to responsibly develop
(its) resources for the benefit of the Nation." And Trump went farther,
expanding the available land by an additional 6 million acres in the
petroleum reserve and another 1.1 million acres of the wildlife refuge.

All those [areas are home to many different types of wildlife, as well
as Indigenous groups]{.underline}.

The view of industry

[For the petroleum industry, I expect these actions are **both welcome
and irrelevant**. Reopening the]{.underline} northeastern portion of the
[petroleum reserve creates a real opportunity]{.underline}: Exploration
has found a significant amount of oil and gas in that area, and
indications are that there may be more yet to discover.

[But prospects on the land in the wildlife refuge and the shallow waters
of the Bering Sea are **not likely of much interest to drilling
companies**]{.underline} unless oil prices rise significantly from their
levels in early 2025. [There is no established production in either
area]{.underline} at present. And, though the refuge has oil and gas
potential, [there are **no roads or pipelines**]{.underline}, and
[Arctic drilling is **especially expensive**]{.underline}.

In fact, [the last two attempts by the government to lease oil
development rights in the wildlife refuge drew **very little
interest**]{.underline}. In 2020, the first Trump administration teamed
with Republicans in Congress to overcome long-standing legal and
political opposition to leasing in the refuge. But the 2021 lease sale
was a bust, with none of the top oil producers in the state
participating.

[A second round of bidding, in January 2025, **received no interest at
all from oil companies**]{.underline}.

Analysts said [drillers]{.underline} may [not]{.underline} be [in a
hurry to take advantage of Trump\'s order]{.underline} on Monday [titled
\"Unleashing Alaska's extraordinary resource potential]{.underline}.\",
opens new tab

The [executive order would reopen vast areas for drilling and
mining]{.underline}, and expedite permits for projects, part of Trump\'s
sweeping plan to maximize oil and gas production while reversing former
President Joe Biden\'s policies encouraging the transition to renewable
energy sources to fight climate change.

\"Many of these areas have been closed for a good long while,\" said
Dustin Meyers, senior vice president of policy at the American Petroleum
Institute, a trade organization that represents major oil firms
including Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corp, and ConocoPhillips.

\"[There is always the risk that these areas could be reclosed after the
next election cycle]{.underline},\" he said, adding that is the [key
issue that could temper interest from oil companies in the short term to
pursue new drilling projects there]{.underline}.

[Drilling in the Arctic and Alaska is a high-risk endeavor]{.underline},
involving [decades of work and billions of dollars of
investment]{.underline}.

Exxon (XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N), Conoco (COP.N), and Occidental Petroleum
(OXY.N), did not comment.

Conoco is among the most active oil companies in Alaska's Arctic, and
secured a federal approval from the Biden administration for its \$8
billion Willow project there in 2023, angering environmental groups.

The U.S. drilling industry trade group AXPC also did not comment.

A [source at one major U.S. oil company]{.underline}, who asked not to
be named discussing the matter, [said many companies are unlikely to
pursue projects in Alaska based on Trump\'s executive order alone,
seeking long-term certainty like an act of Congress]{.underline}.

Energy consultancy Rystad said Trump's use of the \"[drill, baby,
drill]{.underline}\" mantra in his inauguration speech [overestimates
the industry\'s willingness to prioritize growth over generating
shareholder returns.]{.underline}

[Drilling in Alaska\'s pristine Arctic refuge has long been a source of
friction between Alaska lawmakers and tribal corporations seeking to
open more acres to drilling to spur economic growth, and Democratic
presidential administrations that sought to preserve the local ecosystem
and wildlife.]{.underline}

A 2017 tax law during [Trump]{.underline}\'s first term mandated oil and
gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a 19
million-acre sanctuary for species including polar bears and Porcupine
caribou. [But interest has been sparse.]{.underline}

The Biden Interior Department received [no bids from energy companies
last year when it offered 400,000 acres of the refuge]{.underline}, the
minimum amount required.

[ANWR]{.underline}'s wild landscape lacks roads and public facilities,
but its 1.6 million-acre coastal area along the Beaufort Sea [is
estimated to have up to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, enough
to supply the U.S. for more than a year and a half]{.underline} at
current rates.

Before leaving office this month, Biden banned new offshore oil and gas
drilling in federal waters off the East and West coasts, the eastern
Gulf of Mexico and portions of the northern Bering Sea in Alaska. The
move was considered mostly symbolic since it mainly covered zones that
have no important prospects.

[No oil or gas company sought to drill in a contentious wildlife refuge
in Alaska, the Interior Department announced]{.underline} Wednesday.

As required by a 2017 law, the [Biden administration offered the private
sector the chance to drill on tracts in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge]{.underline}.

[However]{.underline}, it said Wednesday that [no company submitted a
bid to do so]{.underline}. The deadline to submit bids to drill was
Monday.

"The [lack of interest from oil companies in development in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge reflects what we and they have known all along
--- there are some places too special and sacred to put at risk with oil
and gas drilling]{.underline}," Laura Daniel-Davis, acting deputy
secretary of the Interior Department, said in a written statement.

On the campaign trail, President-elect Trump said he wanted drilling in
the wildlife refuge, saying in August that he would "get it going very
quickly."

But if companies are unwilling to drill there, that would complicate his
efforts.

Whether to allow drilling in the refuge has been a source of partisan
conflict for many years.

#### It's [too expensive]{.underline} and [politically costly]{.underline}.

decline to bid for Arctic Refuge drilling rights," World Oil,

DG

[Oil companies declined to bid]{.underline} in a U.S. government auction
[to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as **industry interest
wanes** in a region]{.underline} that's [rich with crude but **difficult
to develop**]{.underline}.

The [Interior]{.underline} Department said it [received no sealed
bids]{.underline} for the auction mandated by Congress before those
offers were set to be opened Friday. It marked [the second time in four
years an auction of oil and gas leases]{.underline} in the refuge's
1.6-million-acre coastal plain **[flopped]{.underline}**, coming after a
2021 sale held under President-elect Donald Trump drew just 11 high
bids, most of which were lodged by an Alaska economic development
corporation. Ultimately, [all]{.underline} of the [leases sold
in]{.underline} that [2021]{.underline} auction [were **forfeited**,
with two relinquished and seven others canceled]{.underline} by
Interior.

[The industry's no-show]{.underline} this week [underscores the **legal,
social and economic challenges of drilling in the Coastal Plain**,
despite U.S. Geological Survey estimates the region might hold between
4.3 billion and 11.8 billion barrels of]{.underline} technically
recoverable [crude]{.underline}.

"The [lack of interest]{.underline} from oil companies in development in
the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge [reflects what we and they have
known all along: There are some places **too special and sacred to put
at risk with oil and gas drilling**]{.underline}," said Laura
Daniel-Davis, the acting deputy Interior secretary.

The idea of tapping the 19-million acre refuge for its potential oil
bounty has tantalized Washington for decades. Oil industry allies and
advocates have long championed lease sales in ANWR as a way to boost
production on Alaska's North Slope and supply more crude to the Trans
Alaska Pipeline System that provides a vital conduit for crude.

Yet [companies]{.underline} that lay their eyes on the region [would
come up against more than just reputational risks.
Developing]{.underline} the area [would require they overcome **costly
logistical challenges, navigate intense permitting requirements** and
**deal with opposition from environmental groups**]{.underline},
analysts have warned.

[The **high costs** and **challenges of Arctic oil
development**]{.underline} --- most [vividly demonstrated by Shell Plc's
struggles to mount exploratory drilling in the Chukchi Sea]{.underline}
more than a decade ago --- [led energy companies to **forfeit drilling
rights** in U.S. Arctic waters north of Alaska too, despite the
potentially 27-billion-barrel bounty]{.underline}.

#### Even if opportunities exist, the industry [won't bite]{.underline}.

Heather **Richards 24**, Interior Department and National Park Service
Reporter at E&E News, "Trump gets second chance to drill ANWR. Will oil
companies bite?", E&E News, 12-04-2024, accessed 07-05-2025,

DG

[Regardless of the **political interest** in development in
ANWR]{.underline}, which is long-standing for Alaska leaders and many
North Slope Alaska Natives, [the oil and gas industry will ultimately be
the test of Trump's]{.underline} ANWR [policies]{.underline}.

[The North Slope is far from Asian and Lower 48 markets]{.underline} to
sell its oil and gas. [The refuge]{.underline} also [has **no current
infrastructure** like pipelines to move oil and gas. Major oil
companies]{.underline}, like BP and Shell, [have **exited Alaska** and
reduced the number of well-funded major companies likely to bid in
federal lease sales]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, some [major insurers and banks have **increasingly expressed
reservations** about supporting drilling and mining in the Arctic
because of its cultural and biological sensitivity and vulnerability to
climate change]{.underline}. The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of
the rest of the globe, according to NOAA.

The only certain bidder appears to be the Alaska Industrial Development
and Export Authority, which in October approved a plan to use up to \$20
million to bid in the upcoming ANWR auction. The authority was the
majority bidder in the Trump-era sale in 2021.

Lavin said [the difficult oil market is **one of the strongest
protections against**]{.underline} the Trump administration's
**[increasing drilling access]{.underline}**.

"[The **headwinds are substantial**, even if drilling the Arctic refuge
is what you want]{.underline} to do," he said.

The former Trump Interior official who spoke to E&E News said geological
data --- obtained through seismic surveys to show what's beneath the
refuge's surface --- could galvanize industry interest.

Seismic technology uses sound echoes to digitally create a 3D rendering
of the subsurface, helping companies identify where oil and gas deposits
are located and strategize how to tap them. The U.S. Geological Survey
estimates as much as 10 billion barrels of oil under the refuge's
surface. But that estimate hasn't been fortified with modern testing
techniques.

The last attempt at shooting seismic in the refuge came from an Alaska
Native organization --- the Kaktovik Iñupiat Corp. (KIC) --- in 2021.
KIC is one of the only entities to ever have drilled a well in the
refuge. KIC, with partners BP, Chevron and Arctic Slope Regional,
drilled a test well in ANWR in 1985. But data from the well has not been
made public.

The Biden administration voided KIC's application to shoot seismic in
2021 for failing to complete required overhead surveys to look for polar
bears.

KIC disputed Interior's arguments, saying the Biden administration
intentionally stalled the application. KIC and the Alaska Oil and Gas
Association did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

Seismic testing would be limited to leased acres in the refuge, under
the Biden administration's final supplemental environmental review for
the ANWR oil program. Trump is expected to lift that restriction, but
[Interior officials]{.underline} could still [face hurdles]{.underline}.

[Seismic testing uses heavy trucks that can crush polar bear dens, a
protected species]{.underline}. The bears are classified as threatened
by the Fish and Wildlife Service, and a subpopulation of polar bear
females often spend winter in snow dens with their cubs in the refuge's
coastal plain. They are protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

[The winter months are]{.underline} also [when oil and gas activity is
allowed]{.underline} in the Arctic because the tundra is frozen and less
vulnerable to traffic damage. The [timing makes a seismic program
challenging]{.underline}.

Even if the Trump administration is supportive of seismic, [it will be
difficult for federal agencies in Alaska to approve a seismic program
because of the high risk to bears]{.underline}, said Lavin with
Defenders of Wildlife.

From seismic impacts to climate, an oil program doesn't fit in the
refuge, he said.

"**[It just kind of sticks out like a sore thumb as a really bad
idea]{.underline}**," Lavin said.

### U\-\--Pipelines\-\--2NC

#### Alaska LNG is a joke\-\--new investments are [non-binding]{.underline}, [far off]{.underline}, and likely to get cancelled.

Alex **DeMarban 25**, Reporter at Anchorage Daily News, "Alaska LNG has
caught a wave of high-level attention. Is it winning over its
skeptics?", Anchorage Daily News, 06-05-2025, accessed 07-05-2025,
https://www.adn.com/business-economy/energy/2025/06/05/alaska-lng-has-caught-a-wave-of-high-level-attention-is-it-winning-over-its-skeptics,
DG

[A rare visit to Alaska]{.underline} this week [by high-level Asian
dignitaries and top members of the Trump administration]{.underline} has
[brought new attention to]{.underline} the \$44 billion [Alaska
LNG]{.underline} project.

But [state lawmakers and industry observers]{.underline} who have been
[skeptical of the project say **huge questions remain** about a
mega-project that Alaska businesses and leaders]{.underline}, in one
form or another, [have **tried and failed to build for
generations**]{.underline}.

The Alaska LNG project would deliver vast amounts of natural gas from
the North Slope in an 800-mile pipeline, super-chill it in Southcentral
Alaska, and transport the liquefied natural gas overseas to countries
like Japan, Korea and Taiwan. It would be built in phases, with an \$11
billion portion for the gas line providing natural gas in Alaska in a
first phase, followed by construction of other portions such as the
liquefaction plant and marine terminal to support Asian exports.

Alaska LNG is the latest project to propose tapping North Slope gas.
Similar Alaska gas line projects have failed for half a century, often
the victim of high price tags and a lack of investment, generating
skepticism among many Alaskans that the project will ever be built.

Delegations from those Asian countries and others came to Alaska this
week, expressing interest in the project and also seeking to learn more
about it. A Taiwanese official even said Alaska LNG could one day become
that country's primary source of energy, if the project is built.

They were joined by three top officials with the administration of
President Donald Trump who vowed full support for the project, during a
rare trip to the Alaska oil and gas fields near the Arctic Ocean where
the project would originate.

[Trump]{.underline} has [made Alaska LNG one of his pet projects,
calling it]{.underline} "[truly spectacular]{.underline}" in his joint
speech to Congress in March. He's urged Asian countries to invest in the
project or buy its gas to reduce their trade deficits with the U.S.

The project also received a lot of focus at Gov. Mike Dunleavy's
three-day sustainable energy conference in Anchorage, including on
Thursday when the head of Glenfarne Group, the private company pursuing
the project, said first gas could reach Alaskans in 2028 --- though he
acknowledged it won't be easy.

Lawmakers and industry observers said the spotlight on the project this
week will help potential investors better understand its virtues, such
as:

• Its proximity to Asian countries that want secure energy sources.

• Its existing federal permitting approvals and a ready right-of-way
along the existing trans-Alaska pipeline.

• Its support from both the Trump and former Biden administrations.

[Alaska Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel said it's great that the
project has fresh interest, but she still has plenty of **doubts it will
be built**]{.underline}.

One concern is that the \$44 billion cost estimate is likely too low,
she said.

"I'm remaining pretty skeptical," Giessel said in an interview Thursday.

She'll remain so, **[until a company puts up]{.underline}** maybe \$10
billion or \$**[20 billion to build it]{.underline}**, she said.

The project has a lot of positives, no doubt, she said.

"At the same time, [the **cost of materials** and the **workforce** is a
whole other calculation]{.underline}, and I think [they're way
underestimating that in their optimistic pursuit of this]{.underline},"
she said.

Rep. Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, said the interest from potential Asian
partners this week and other positive developments for the project give
him confidence that it will be built starting in the next two or three
years.

"We've seen major players come and go and commitments signed and
scrapped, so I get why folks are weary," he said. "But you know, here's
the question, in this moment when Alaska LNG has serious investment
interest, federal support and desperate in-state energy need, are we
going to let old disappointments shut the door on a real opportunity?
I'm not.\"

\$115B in 'expressed interest' raises questions

[Glenfarne said]{.underline} in a statement this week that [more than 50
companies from around the world have expressed interest]{.underline} for
"over \$115 billion of contract value for various partnerships with the
project."

The partnerships would include "equipment and material supply, services,
investment, and customer agreements," according to Glenfarne's
statement.

**[Who are the companies?]{.underline}**

Glenfarne spokesperson Micah Hirschfield declined to disclose that
information Tuesday.

Glenfarne early in the week planned [a media briefing]{.underline} on
Thursday where questions could be posed to Brendan Duval, Glenfarne's
chief executive.

But it [was canceled]{.underline} due to the company's busy agenda,
Hirschfield said Thursday morning.

Duval could not be reached for comment Thursday, Hirschfield said.

"Not going to be able to make it happen today," Hirschfield said in a
text. "Apologies."

Giessel said the announcement leaves many questions.

"OK, so in plain English, what does that mean?" she said. "**[Are they
ponying up money? Are they just saying they're interested in
participating in the project?]{.underline}**"

She said the project, which involves Alaska as a minority partner
alongside Glenfarne, should be much more public given its large size and
use of Alaska's resources.

Kopp said he's confident the announcement will soon be followed by
binding agreements, given that Glenfarne says more than 50 companies are
expressing interest.

"I don't think it's an exaggeration to think it's just months, within
two to three short months," he said.

Brad Keithley, a former oil and gas attorney and longtime industry
observer, said the [expression of interest is similar to
**nonbinding**]{.underline} "**[memorandums of
understanding]{.underline}**" that [the project has signed with foreign
entities **in the past, for potential partnerships or gas supply
agreements, that have amounted to nothing**]{.underline}.

"[They're trying a **shock-and-awe** with coming out with a big number
like that, but **this is no more than expression of
interest**]{.underline}," Keithley said. "**[We've seen lot of those
over the course of Alaska LNG history that never turn into solid
numbers]{.underline}**."

[They're making the announcement to get attention]{.underline} for the
project [in hopes that people get on board]{.underline}, Keithley said.
It's not surprising that **[Glenfarne]{.underline}** "**[dumped a number
out there and walked away from it]{.underline}**," he said.

Keithley said this week's events have brought renewed attention to the
pipeline, a plus. But ultimately, the economics of the project will
determine whether any entities will invest.

Sen. Jesse Bjorkman, R-Nikiski, said there's a lot of "momentum and
tailwind" behind the project, and that's exciting.

But he said there are plenty of "**[details and holes]{.underline}**
that **[need to be fleshed out]{.underline}**." His constituents have
concerns that ratepayers in Alaska could face high costs for the gas,
since the state's small population and businesses will be the buyers
before exports begin, following the \$11 billion construction of the
first phase.

"I know what matters to the people on the Kenai Peninsula is they want
their lights and their homes to be on and heated reliably, and they want
that to happen at the lowest cost possible," Bjorkman said.

Alaska House Speaker Bryce Edgmon said outside the conference at the
Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center that the attention on the project
has helped create buzz around it.

"The optimism meter has to be surging, there's no question about it," he
said.

"But the devil's in the details with this project, as they say," he
said.

[One question is the level of involvement of potential investors in the
project, if any]{.underline}, he said.

#### No pipeline expansion\-\--tariffs and lack of funding stop companies from taking advantage of the opportunity.

Scott L. **Montgomery 25**, Lecturer at the University of Washington
Jackson School of International Studies, M.S. in Geological and Earth
Sciences from Cornell University, "White House plans for Alaskan oil and
gas face some hurdles -- including from Trump and the petroleum
industry," The Conversation, 04-11-2025, accessed 07-05-2025,

[A strong gain for the petroleum industry would be a major new pipeline
to carry natural gas]{.underline} more than 800 miles south [from the
Prudhoe Bay area on the Arctic coast to a port near
Anchorage]{.underline} on south-central Alaska's Cook Inlet.

The idea has its own decades-long history, and has been both pushed
forward and set back over the years by changing economics, government
plans, and tribal interest and opposition.

The main challenge is that [there is **no way to transport natural gas**
off the North Slope]{.underline}. Since drilling began in the late
1970s, some has been used locally for heating and running equipment,
with the vast majority being reinjected into oil reservoir rock to help
maintain oil production.

Rising demand and elevated prices in Asia, however, suggest the project
could be profitable, despite the current cost estimate of US\$44
billion. Project plans indicate most of it would go to build a liquefied
natural gas export terminal near Anchorage, with the rest spent to
construct an 807-mile pipeline paralleling the existing Trans-Alaska
Pipeline, and a plant at Prudhoe Bay that would capture carbon from the
atmosphere, compress it and inject it into oil-producing reservoirs to
boost production.

The pipeline is designed to carry 3.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas
each day, which would make it one of the largest pipelines in North
America. The export terminal, to be built near the town of Nikiski on
Cook Inlet, would have a capacity of roughly 1 trillion cubic feet per
year, enough to heat about 15 million homes for a year.

The pipeline could take as little as two to three years to build, but
the terminal and carbon-capture plant would take longer -- five years or
so. The exports from Alaska could go to other ports in the U.S., but
they could also fetch higher prices in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and
possibly China.

A wrench in the works

[Most of the permits needed for the pipeline-and-export-terminal project
have been secured]{.underline} by the Alaska Gasline Development
Corporation, a company created by the state of Alaska to build the
project.

[However, **no company or foreign government has**]{.underline} yet
**[agreed to foot the bill]{.underline}**, and [despite the support of
the Trump White House, there's **no indication the federal government
will do so** either]{.underline}.

The [Trump]{.underline} administration has also [created a new barrier
to the project]{.underline}. Its [sweeping tariffs and the resulting
trade war **crashed prices** in the global oil and gas
market]{.underline} in early April 2025.

In addition, [uncertainty about the permanence of tariffs or other
restrictions on]{.underline} international [trade are]{.underline} now
[**widespread** and **directly affect the oil industry**. Lower gas and
oil prices and less stability **make any project less
attractive**]{.underline}.

[It's true that Trump exempted oil and gas from his]{.underline} most
recent [tariffs. But **that matters less than the broader effect** the
trade war is already having]{.underline}, with analysts projecting it is
driving the global economy toward recession. [Less economic activity
means less demand for oil and gas, and]{.underline} therefore [less
incentive]{.underline} for companies [to]{.underline} drill new wells
and [build new pipelines]{.underline}.

To top everything off, [the White House slapped heavy tariffs on Japan,
South Korea and Taiwan, the very countries that might be inclined to
help fund the pipeline project]{.underline}. Even before the trade war,
they were hesitant about supporting it. The potential [suspension, or
reinstatement, or adjustment of tariffs is not likely to help them view
the situation as more stable]{.underline}.

[Those who favor oil and gas development in Alaska may be wondering
whether the president is truly on their side. It remains to be seen
whether their hopes might end up a casualty of White House economic
policy]{.underline}.

#### It has no investors.

The Trump administration is confident that a massive liquified natural
gas project in Alaska will find investors despite its enormous cost.

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} has [pushed Alaska LNG as a
national priority]{.underline} since taking office. Alaska has already
spent years trying to build an 800-mile pipeline from the North Slope
above the Arctic Circle south to the Cook Inlet, where the gas would be
cooled and shipped to U.S. allies in Asia.

But [Alaska LNG has **never gotten off the ground** due to a
**stratospheric price tag** of more than \$40 billion.
Trump]{.underline} has [pushed Japan and South Korea]{.underline} in
particular [to invest]{.underline} in the project, [threatening them
with higher]{.underline} tariffs if they don't offer trade deals that
suit him.

"If you get the commercial offtakers for the gas, financing is pretty
straightforward," Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC's Brian
Sullivan in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. "There \[are\] countries around the
world looking to shrink their trade deficit with the United States, and
of course, a very easy way to do that is to buy more American energy,"
Wright said.

[Energy analysts]{.underline}, however, [are **skeptical**]{.underline}
of the project. [Alaska LNG]{.underline} "**[doesn't have a clear cut
commercial logic]{.underline}**," Alex Munton, director of global gas
and LNG research at Rapidan Energy, told CNBC in April.

"**[If it did, it would have had a lot more support]{.underline}** than
it has thus far, and [this project has been on the planning board for
**literally decades**]{.underline}," Munton said.

Policies pursuant to OCSLA are supposed to balance energy needs and the
management of oil and gas exploration with protection for marine
animals, coastal beaches, and wetlands. 79

[Seismic surveys, sonar, and blasting]{.underline} that [are used to map
geographic structures in the seabed to search for oil and natural gas
reservoirs can cause **significant hearing damage to marine mammals**.
Seismic air guns]{.underline} ([and military sonar]{.underline}) [emit
explosive, repetitive sound waves that travel great distances,
interfering with]{.underline} other [sounds in the ocean]{.underline},
and [the cumulative effect poses **significant risks to marine
life**]{.underline}. 80 The [persistent shock waves and rapid changes in
pressure]{.underline} can [cause tissue destruction and **deafen marine
mammals** who are highly dependent on their key senses for survival. It
affects their balance and ability to navigate, judge depths,
communicate, feed, and breed. Changes in communication]{.underline}
(calls) [between whales and dolphins have been observed]{.underline}
with reduced or increased vocal activities and change in pitch. 81

[Behavioral reactions include changes in duration of surfacing and
diving, number of blows per surfacing, abandonment of preferred feeding
grounds, and even strandings. Prey may]{.underline} also [attempt to
flee the area of the sound impact, disrupting schooling and]{.underline}
further [impairing feeding]{.underline} success. **[Reproduction and
survival are jeopardized]{.underline}**. These high-impact risks are
widely recognized in Marine Mammal Protection Act \"incidental take\"
applications.

\[\*10159\] On the Atlantic Coast, [impacted marine mammals include the
following **endangered species**: North Atlantic right whale, blue
whale, fin whale, sei whale, humpback whale, and sperm
whale]{.underline}. 82 In addition, [fishermen estimate]{.underline}
that [seismic noise may reduce their fish catch by **40%-80**%, as
Atlantic cod, haddock, rockfish, herring, sand eel, and blue whiting are
also impacted]{.underline}. 83 So, [increased oil revenues may pose an
**offsetting economic disadvantage for fishermen**]{.underline}.

In addition to the risks posed by seismic blasting, [marine mammals are
subject to risks from drilling equipment noise, drilling discharges,
seafloor disturbance, vessel and equipment noise, vessel traffic,
aircraft traffic and noise, trash and debris, onshore support
activities, and accidental fuel spills]{.underline}. 84

Clearly, **[the more people move around, the higher the risk of disease
transmission]{.underline}**. In the Arctic, [the most mobile population
is likely the pool of extractive industry workers]{.underline}. A 2019
demographic atlas of the Arctic found that \"the highest share of
working-age population was in regions where a high proportion of
employment is related to extracting natural resources, e.g. oil, gas and
minerals. This is especially the case in the Russian Arctic regions.\"

Some of these workers are residents, but [industrial activity bringing
in]{.underline} \"non-resident male [worker populations]{.underline}\"
[is]{.underline} likely [a **pipeline for rapid dispersal of infectious
diseases**]{.underline}. According to a 2019 analysis from University
College London, such transitory workers often live in \"camp-like
conditions\" that encourage \"increased demand for commercial sex and,
thereby, potentially human trafficking.\"

[Because of]{.underline} the [rapid travel patterns and cramped living
quarters typical of extractive operations]{.underline}, \"**[you don\'t
need a huge dispersal of a pathogen]{.underline}**,\" Mora says. [You
just need **person-to-person transmission**]{.underline} in close
quarters [and **one infected person** to carry the disease quickly to a
more populated area]{.underline}.

[Greenland]{.underline} is a prime example of the problem. It [is
already at high risk for pathogen exchange and on the brink of massive
expansion of resource extraction]{.underline}. The mineral exploration
company KoBold Metals, with investors who include Microsoft founder Bill
Gates, Amazon and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, and Ray Dalio,
founder of the world\'s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, is
exploring for nickel, copper, cobalt, and platinum group metals in
Greenland as the island\'s massive central ice sheet recedes. Their goal
is ostensibly to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. But,
says Markus Kröger, professor of global development studies at the
University of Helsinki, [extraction projects are]{.underline} also
[pushing right up against]{.underline} the [**thawing permafrost** and
fostering the creation of **boom-bust towns**]{.underline}, which are
known [**breeding grounds for both emerging and familiar diseases**.
Greenland is]{.underline} currently [a hotspot for]{.underline} the
sexually transmitted diseases [chlamydia and gonorrhea]{.underline}, far
outpacing the Arctic regions of the United States and Canada.

Neither KoBold Metals nor the Gates Foundation responded to multiple

[The **sheer size of Alaska** and **proportion of intact
systems**]{.underline}, much of which is public land, [makes Alaska a
**singularly important** and **opportune place** for the **U**nited
**S**tates to consider natural climate solutions]{.underline} within its
own borders. Approximately [60%]{.underline} (900,000 km2 of 1.5 M km2)
[of Alaska's terrestrial surface area is federal land]{.underline}
(Figure 1). Nearly [2/3 of this is within an IUCN protected
category]{.underline} I-VI, [with management ranging from protections
for wildlife and recreational values]{.underline} \[e.g., Fish and
Wildlife Service (FWS) Refuges, National Park Service (NPS)\], [to
managing lands for]{.underline} some oil and gas, mineral, and timber
[development]{.underline} \[e.g., United States Forest Service (USFS),
Bureau of Land Management (BLM)\]. The State of Alaska manages another
100 million acres (404,685 km2), an area the size of the State of
California, for an equally wide range of purposes. Together, 88% of
Alaska is managed either by the federal or state government. No United
States state has a larger amount of public lands nor the combined
intactness, carbon storage, and native biodiversity importance of
Alaska.

As noted, ANCSA, enacted in 1971, transferred 44 million acres (178,062
km2) of land (nearly 12% of the State) to newly created Alaska Native
regional and village corporations. These lands are managed for the
benefit of the corporations' Alaska Native shareholders. In addition,
the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), passed in
1980, provided varying protections to 157 million acres of land set
aside as National Parks, National Forests, and other conservation areas.
It also established subsistence priority in hunting, fishing, and
gathering activities for rural residents, Alaska Native or otherwise,
stating that, "the continuation of the opportunity for subsistence is
essential to Native physical, economic, traditional, and cultural
existence." Roughly 80% of the population of remote rural Alaska
residents are Indigenous People7, and federal and state public lands
comprise much of the traditional territory of Alaska's 229 federally
recognized tribes---creating an unusual opportunity for a small number
of landowners and sovereign tribes to work together on coordinated land
management strategies across large regions of the state. Only about 1%
of Alaska is in general private land ownership.

[Many intact systems in Alaska face a variety of proposed industrial
land uses that]{.underline} either [**increase carbon emissions**
through]{.underline} the [extraction and production of fossil fuels or
**diminish carbon storage values and system intactness** through
degradation or conversion of natural areas. Among these are expanded
fossil fuel development]{.underline} in the Brooks Foothills and
Beaufort Coastal Plain (Figure 6), [clear-cut old-growth
logging]{.underline} in forest systems [in southeast Alaska, and
large-scale, fossil-fuel based mining operations and associated
infrastructure in otherwise intact regions]{.underline} such as the
Bristol Bay watershed. [Land conversion from forest to agriculture in
Alaska's boreal region would be likely to result in **net carbon
release**]{.underline} (Grünzweig et al., 2004). In Canada, agricultural
conversion is the greatest source of historical loss of boreal forests,
and remains an important driver of deforestation in some boreal zones
(Hobson et al., 2002). Such conversion is not however, occurring at
anything approaching large scales in Alaska (Figure 3).

Oil drilling is not currently happening in the ANWR, but there are many
people who are trying to drill there. In 2004, the American-Made Energy
and Good Job Act legislature originally started to open up the ANWR for
oil drilling. Then later on, in 2017, the United States government
started its plan to open up the ANWR for oil drilling. In 2020 the plan
was finalized, and preparations for auctioning off land and drilling
leases began.50 Later that year, the US presidential administration
changed, and the new administration suspended drilling leases in the
ANWR.51 The President cited "legal deficiencies" in the oil drilling
plan and "inadequacy of the environmental review" that the plan was
based on as the reasons for suspending the leases.52

Image of an oil pipeline

[Drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would cause a lot of
**environmental harm**.53 In 2006, groups of ecologists studied tropic
and microbial changes to oil-drilled land in the North Slope of Alaska.
They concluded that the hydrological processes and tundra surfaces,
which are processes that **maintain** the ecosystems, were **disrupted**
by arctic oil production.54 Altering these processes that maintain the
ecosystems causes **ecological disruption**. Anywhere that oil is
drilled, the environment is affected specifically through aspects of
drilling like discharge solids, drilling waste, and dirty fuels from
trucks.55 In the study done in the North Slope of Alaska, researchers
also found that **food and human waste** from the oil drilling facility
have altered predation patterns of brown bears and arctic
foxes.56]{.underline}

Before oil drilling can begin, testing must be done on the land to see
if the land contains oil. [Testing for oil has its own environmental
damage. In 2018, damage caused by heavy vehicles that are used in
seismic testing for oil was seen in the ANWR. The damage is in a grid
formation covering a portion of the ANWR in an area called Point
Thomson.57 These tracks can remain in the land for decades and change
the surface water flows or accelerate the **thawing of permafrost**.58
Changes to the surface flow of water mean changing or **degrading** the
current ecosystem.]{.underline} In order to start drilling in the ANWR,
the Interior Department would need to construct 4 airstrips, major well
pads, 175 miles worth of roads, ground pipelines, a seawater treatment
plant, and a barge landing and storage site.59

[Drilling for oil also includes other side effects like **spills**,
which can **endanger or kill** native life. Oil completely destroys an
animal's ability to insulate.60 Oil spilling into waterways majorly
affects the animals living in and around the contaminated
water]{.underline}. [Fracking]{.underline} can pollute ground and
surface water.61 Fracking requires using a fracking fluid that is
injected into the soil and shale to extract oil further.62 This process
[is more harmful to the environment and people. Fracking can **pollute**
ground and surface water, which would only harm the people living in the
area.63]{.underline}

There are three common reasons why oil drilling in this area would be
beneficial. It would reduce reliance on Middle East oil, strengthen the
economy, and increase the jobs and welfare of Alaskans. Some believe
that this can all be done with little harm to the environment.64 These
claims are based on the environmental impact of the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline, which was implemented in the 1970s and had very little
environmental impact. Only 2% of the developed land experienced
alteration.65 The pipeline itself only affects 2% of land and does not
include the land damaged from spills or the other land surrounding it
being affected by the pollution of the line.66

[The largest tract of public land in the **U**nited **S**tates
is]{.underline} a wild expanse of tundra and wetlands stretching across
[nearly 23 million acres of northern Alaska]{.underline}. It's [called
the National Petroleum Reserve]{.underline} in Alaska, but despite its
industrial-sounding name, the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, or
NPR-A, is much more than a fuel depot.

[Tens of thousands of caribou feed and breed in this area, which is the
size of Maine. Migratory birds flock]{.underline} to its lakes [in
summer]{.underline}, and [fish rely on the]{.underline} many [rivers
that crisscross the region]{.underline}.

[The area is]{.underline} also **[vital for the health of the
planet]{.underline}**. However, its future is at risk.

The Trump administration announced a plan on June 17, 2025, to open
nearly 82% of this fragile landscape to oil and gas development,
including some of its most ecologically sensitive areas. The government
is accepting public comments on the plan through July 1.

I am an ecologist, and I have been studying sensitive ecosystems and the
species that depend on them for over 20 years. [Disturbing this
landscape and its wildlife could lead to consequences that
are]{.underline} difficult -- if not **[impossible]{.underline}** --
**[to reverse]{.underline}**.

What is the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska?

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was originally designated in 1923
by President Warren Harding as an emergency oil supply for the U.S.
Navy.

In the 1970s, its management was transferred to the Department of
Interior under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act. This
congressional act requires that, in addition to managing the area for
energy development, the secretary of the interior must ensure the
"maximum protection" of "any significant subsistence, recreational, fish
and wildlife, or historical or scenic value."

The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for overseeing the reserve
and identifying and protecting areas with important ecological or
cultural values -- aptly named "special areas."

The Trump administration now plans to expand the amount of land
available for drilling in the NPR-A from about 11.7 million acres to
more than 18.5 million acres -- including parts of those "special areas"
-- as part of its effort to increase U.S. oil drilling and reduce
regulations on the industry.

I recently worked with scientists and scholars at The Wilderness Society
to write a detailed report outlining many of the ecological and cultural
values found across the reserve.

A refuge for wildlife

[The reserve is a sanctuary for]{.underline} many [Arctic wildlife,
including caribou]{.underline} populations that have experienced sharp
global declines in recent years.

The reserve's [open tundra provides critical calving, foraging,
migratory and winter habitat]{.underline} for three of the four caribou
herds on Alaska's North Slope. These herds undertake some of the longest
overland migrations on Earth. Infrastructure such as roads and
industrial activity can disrupt their movement, further harming the
populations' health.

[The NPR-A is]{.underline} also [globally significant for migratory
birds]{.underline}. Situated at the northern end of five major flyways,
[birds come]{.underline} here [from all corners]{.underline} of the
Earth, including all 50 states. [It hosts]{.underline} some of [the
highest densities of breeding shorebirds **anywhere on the
planet**]{.underline}.

An estimated [72% of Arctic Coastal Plain shorebirds]{.underline} --
over 4.5 million birds -- [nest in the reserve]{.underline}. This
includes the yellow-billed loon, the largest loon species in the world,
with most of its U.S. breeding population concentrated in the reserve.

[Expanding oil and gas development]{.underline} in the National
Petroleum Reserve-Alaska [could threaten these birds by **disrupting
their habitat** and **adding noise to the landscape**]{.underline}.

[Many other species]{.underline} also **[depend on intact
ecosystems]{.underline}** there.

[Polar bears build dens]{.underline} in the area, [making it critical
for cub survival. Wolverines]{.underline}, which follow caribou herds,
also [rely on large, connected expanses of undisturbed
habitat]{.underline} for their dens and food. [Moose browse along the
Colville River]{.underline}, the largest river on the North Slope, while
[peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons and rough-legged hawks nest on the cliffs
above]{.underline}.

A large stretch of the Colville River is currently protected as a
special area, but the Trump administration's proposed plan will remove
those protections. The Teshekpuk Lake special area, critical habitat for
caribou and migrating birds, would also lose protection.

[Indigenous communities]{.underline} in the Arctic, particularly the
Iñupiat people, also [depend on these lands, waters and wildlife for
subsistence hunting and fishing. Their livelihoods, food security,
cultural identity and spiritual practices are **deeply intertwined with
the health of this ecosystem**]{.underline}.

Oil and gas drilling's impact

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is vast, and [drilling won't occur
across all of it. But oil and gas operations pose **far-reaching risks**
that **extend well beyond the drill sites**]{.underline}.

[Infrastructure like roads, pipelines, airstrips and gravel pads
**fragment** and **degrade the landscape**. That can **alter water
flow** and the **timing of ice melt**. It can]{.underline} also [disrupt
reproduction and migration routes for wildlife that rely on **large,
connected habitats**]{.underline}.

Networks of [winter ice roads and the way exploration equipment compacts
the land can **delay spring and early summer thawing
patterns**]{.underline} on the landscape. [That can upset]{.underline}
the normal pattern of [meltwater, making it harder for shore birds to
nest]{.underline}.

ConocoPhillips' Willow drilling project, approved by the Biden
administration in 2023 on the eastern side of the reserve, provides some
insight into the potential impact: An initial project plan, later scaled
back, included up to 575 miles (925 kilometers) of ice roads for
construction, an air strip, more than 300 miles (nearly 485 kilometers)
of new pipeline, a processing facility, a gravel mine and barge
transportation, in addition to five drilling sites.

Many [animals]{.underline} will try to [steer clear of noise, light and
human activity. Roads and industrial operations]{.underline} can [force
them to alter their behavior, which can affect their health and how well
they]{.underline} can [reproduce]{.underline}. Research has shown that
caribou mothers with new calves avoid infrastructure and that this
impact does not lessen over time of exposure.

At Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in the U.S., [decades of
oil development have led to **pollution**, including hundreds of **oil
spills and leaks**, and **habitat loss**, such as flooding and shoreline
erosion, extensive permafrost thaw and damage from roads, construction
and gravel mining]{.underline}. In short, [the footprint of drilling is
**not confined**]{.underline} to isolated locations --- it radiates
outward, undermining the ecological integrity of the region. Permafrost
thaw now even threatens the stability of the oil industry's own
infrastructure.

Consequences for the climate

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the surrounding Arctic
ecosystem also play an outsized role in regulating the global climate.

[Vast amounts of climate-warming carbon is]{.underline} currently
[locked away in the wetlands and permafrost of the tundra]{.underline},
but the Arctic is warming close to three times faster than the global
average.

[Roads, drilling and development]{.underline} can [**increase permafrost
thaw** and **cause coastlines to erode**, releasing carbon long locked
in the soil]{.underline}. In addition, these [operations]{.underline}
will ultimately add **[more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, further
warming the planet]{.underline}**.

The public comment period on the White House's plan to open more of the
National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to oil and gas drilling closes at the
end of the day on July 1.

The [decisions made today will **shape the future of the
Arctic**]{.underline} -- and one of the last wild ecosystems in the
United States -- **[for generations to come]{.underline}**.

JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) --- Environmental groups on Wednesday petitioned the
U.S. Department of Interior to review climate impacts related to the
decades-old trans-Alaska pipeline system and develop a plan for a
"managed phasedown" of the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) pipeline, which is
Alaska's economic lifeline. The request comes more than a year after the
Biden administration approved the massive Willow oil project on Alaska's
petroleum-rich North Slope, a decision that was welcomed by Alaska
political leaders seeking to stem a trend of declining oil production in
the state and by many Alaska Native leaders in the region who see the
project as economically vital for their communities. Willow, which is
being developed by ConocoPhillips Alaska, could produce up to 180,000
barrels of oil a day. Some of the groups who filed the petition,
including the Center for Biological Diversity and Sovereign Iñupiat for
a Living Arctic, are among those who have asked an appeals court to
overturn the approval of Willow. A decision is pending. Oil flow through
the trans-Alaska pipeline system averaged around 470,000 barrels a day
last year. At its peak, in the late 1980s, about 2 million barrels a day
flowed through the line, which began operating in 1977. [The last
environmental analysis, done more than 20 years ago as part of a
right-of-way renewal, is "**woefully outdated**,"]{.underline} the
groups said in their petition. [They cite the rapid warming and changes
the Arctic region has experienced, noting that several ice-reliant
species, such as polar bears, have received **Endangered Species Act
protections** since the last review. They also raise concerns about the
impacts of **thawing permafrost** on the pipeline
infrastructure.]{.underline} While the next environmental review is
expected in about a decade, that's too long to wait, they argue. "[Every
drop of oil that moves through the pipeline is more **climate
devastation**, both here in Alaska and around the world," said Cooper
Freeman, Alaska director for the Center for Biological Diversity. "The
longer we wait to have this hard conversation about the inevitable ---
because we must transition off of fossil fuels and we have to do it
urgently --- the **harder** it's going to be for Alaska."]{.underline}
Michelle Egan, a spokesperson for pipeline operator Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co., said in a statement that the company continues to
"collaborate with our numerous federal and state regulatory partners as
we meet our commitments to safe and environmentally responsible
operations. We are steadfast and dedicated to being a prudent operator,
safely and reliably transporting oil from the North Slope of Alaska into
the future." Freeman said Interior can accept the groups' request or
deny it, which the groups could challenge. If Interior doesn't respond
in what would be considered a reasonable amount of time, the groups can
seek to compel a response through the courts, he said. Interior did not
have a comment, spokesperson Giovanni Rocco said by email. The petition
asks that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which falls under
Interior, evaluate a range of options that include not renewing the
right-of-way, issuing a right-of-way for a period of 10 or fewer years
to allow for "continuous re-evaluation of the landscape in which TAPS
operates," setting potential limits on how much oil flows through the
pipeline and requiring North Slope oil producers to adopt emissions
controls for their operations. [The groups say the "only rational
conclusion of that analysis will be a managed **phasedown** of the
pipeline," and their petition calls on the land management agency to
begin work on such a plan.]{.underline} It doesn't suggest a timeline
for a phasedown. "We're not asking for the pipeline to shut down
tomorrow. We're saying you need to start the conversation now," Freeman
said. "That includes extensive conversation, engagement, consultation
with communities across Alaska, especially on the North Slope. \... [The
longer we wait, the **more pain** for people, wildlife and the climate,
especially here in Alaska]{.underline}."

projects---are intended to export gas overseas as LNG, based on the
authors' assessment of federal data and other public records. The
additional gas shipments would have significant implications for climate
change. If all of the pipelines are built and run at full capacity,
carbon dioxide emissions from burning this additional gas would be two
and half times greater than the CO2 currently released from all U.S.
coal-fired power plants, the report found. This doesn't include
emissions of methane, a climate super pollutant and the primary
component of natural gas. [Methane emissions occur at **every step** of
the natural gas supply chain---from wellheads and pipelines to LNG
vessels and end users---as the gas leaks or is intentionally vented.
Methane emissions from the additional pipelines would pack a climate
punch nearly twice that of CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants
over a 20-year period, according to the report. The amount of gas leaks
from the oil and gas sector will likely increase as the Trump
administration **rolls back** the industry's methane
regulations]{.underline}, the report noted. "We know from hundreds of
thousands of aerial and satellite measurements that methane leaks from
oil and gas production are far worse than we previously realized, which
makes the climate footprint of natural gas as bad as coal in many
regions of the country," said Danny Richter, a senior fellow with CEEA
and the report's lead author. "We had a clear path to clean up the
methane problem, including the methane emissions reduction program
enacted by Congress in 2022 as well as EPA regulations for the oil and
gas industry. But that pathway has been shut down by the current
administration." A fee on excessive methane emissions from oil and gas
producers implemented under the Biden administration was rescinded by
the Trump administration on May 12. "It is clear from the beginning of
this 'report' that it was created with the outcome already determined
and no desire to provide facts," an EPA spokesperson told Inside Climate
News. "U.S. methane emissions have been falling for decades thanks to
American innovation, not heavy-handed government regulations, while
domestic production of oil and gas has exponentially increased.
According to EPA, methane emissions in the United States decreased by
19% between 1990 and 2022." Measurements in the field have repeatedly
shown that reported methane emissions far understate actual releases.
The American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, did not
respond to a request for comment. The report is based on U.S. Department
of Energy data on 104 pipeline projects currently under development. It
is unclear whether all of the planned pipelines will be built.
Fifty-four of the projects, slightly more than half of all pipelines
under development, have either not yet been approved or are on hold.
[This includes one of the **largest** proposed pipelines, the \$45
billion **Alaska Nikiski LNG project**. The pipe, which proponents have
sought for decades, would transport gas 805 miles from Alaska's North
Slope to an LNG export terminal in southern Alaska.]{.underline}
Completing the proposed export terminal, a retrofit of an existing
import terminal, is included in the project's projected cost. The
developer, the Alaska Gasline Development Corp, has applied for permits
for the pipeline, many of which were approved during the last Trump
administration, but still requires more. President Donald Trump has
directed agencies to speed up permitting and roll back environmental
protections. He touted the Alaska Nikiski LNG project in an address to
Congress earlier this year as "truly spectacular" and said "the
permitting is gotten." Arvind Ravikumar, co-director of the Energy
Emissions Modeling and Data Lab at the University of Texas at Austin,
cautioned that the report included figures for carbon dioxide emissions
of gas burned by end users in other countries that import the LNG. "The
way international carbon accounting works in this space is that you
count only those emissions that happen within your national border,"
Ravikumar said. [However, David Lyon, a senior methane scientist with
the Environmental Defense Fund, said including emissions from burning
the gas, wherever it occurs, made sense. "Climate change is global,"
Lyon said. "If we are just exporting our emissions to other countries,
that's still going to cause climate change and have
impact."]{.underline} However, Lyon noted that in some cases, building
gas pipelines could actually help reduce emissions. For example, in the
Permian basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico---the largest
oil and gas producing region in the country---gas is often flared, or
vented, due to a lack of sufficient pipeline capacity. In such cases,
additional pipelines could help reduce flaring and its associated
emissions. But it would be better to avoid drilling new wells in areas
that lack sufficient pipeline capacity in the first place, Lyon added.
In comparing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the planned
pipelines to those of coal-power plants, the report only compares CO2
emissions between the two fuel sources. Elsewhere, the report discusses
methane emissions from the gas supply chain, but does not consider
methane emissions from coal mines that feed coal-fired power plants. A
recent peer-reviewed study comparing the greenhouse gas emissions of LNG
and coal found methane emissions from coal mines were relatively modest
compared to coal's CO2 emissions. In addition to permitting issues,
economic forces could also limit the number of pipeline projects that
get built in the coming years, or the extent to which completed
pipelines operate at full capacity. China, the world's largest importer
of LNG, stopped taking U.S. gas entirely in March in response to U.S.
tariffs on Chinese goods. Symons said the ongoing pipeline buildout
could commit the U.S. to significantly larger LNG exports for decades to
come. "[This locks in more fossil fuel **dependency** that future
presidents **won't** be able to make go away," he said. "Policies like
tax incentives come and go, but pipelines are **forever**."]{.underline}

[Pipeline corridors, as one representative type of linear engineering
infrastructures and **environmental disturbances, are widespread** owing
to the growing demand for natural resources]{.underline} \[ 1, 2\].
Pipeline corridors are created for oil and gas exploration and
transportation in hydrocarbon-rich boreal and tundra ecosystems in North
America \[ 3 \] and northern Eurasia \[ 4\], and in other alpine and
high-plateau permafrost regions at mid- to low latitudes, e.g., \[5
--7\]. There are more than 2485 km of pipelines in Alaska, 2031 km in
China \[8\], and hundreds of potential routes and tens of thousands of
kilometers for pipelines in northern Canada and Russia

[Pipeline systems built in permafrost regions are represented by the
Alyeska]{.underline} (Trans- Alaska) [pipeline system in
Alaska]{.underline}, USA, the Norman Wells Oil Pipeline in western
Canada, the Eastern Siberia to Pacific Ocean Oil and Gas Pipelines
Systems (ESPO) in Russia and its spur line, the China-Russia Crude Oil
Pipelines (CRCOP) in northeast China, and the Golmud-Lhasa Products Oil
Pipeline (GLPOP) on the interior Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in southwest
China \[5, 10\]. [Construction of pipeline corridors generally
necessitates the **partial** (elevated construction mode) or
**complete** (burial construction mode) **clearance of surface
vegetation** (except arctic tundra due to low vegetation
height)]{.underline} along a belt transect 5--20 m in width (also named
the pipeline right-of-way (ROW)) \[ 11 ,12 \]. Furthermore, [roots of
trees and other vegetation and surface organic soil are **removed for
machine and vehicle movement**. For buried pipelines, a trench about
1.5--2.0 m in width or wider and 1.5--3.0 m in depth (depending on the
depth of the permafrost table, pipe diameter, and the associated
pipe--wall configurations) is excavated]{.underline} \[ 13 \]. Soil is
backfilled after installation of pipelines \[ 14 \]. These [construction
processes have **substantial ecological impacts, altering the abiotic
and biological environments**, usually extending far beyond the pipeline
corridor widths \[15\]]{.underline}

[Pipeline construction and operation, as well as maintenance (e.g., by
adding more read- ily available gravelly soils above or near pipelines
to mitigate water and wind erosion and filling up the thermokarst lakes
and depressions with soils) and **emergency responses, may generally
result in permafrost degradation, as evidenced by a warmer
soil/ground**, lower- ing the permafrost table and/or thickening the
active layer]{.underline}, ground surface subsidence and thermokarsting,
and formation of the supra-permafrost subaerial talik; consequently,
they modify or alter the physical, biophysical, chemical and biological
properties of foundation soils \[1,16\].

[**Pipeline disturbances may have profound implications for boreal
forest**, wetlands and peatlands, and arctic/alpine tundra ecosystems,
where, because of low temperatures, vegetation recovery rate is slow, if
ever possible, to return to the pre-disturbance state under severe
disturbances]{.underline} \[ 11 ,17 \]. Shrub invasion, colonization,
establishment, and expansion in the ROW, as characterized by increases
in abundance, coverage, and phytomass, also known as shrubification,
have been reported in many permafrost regions during vegetation recovery
e.g., \[14 , 18-- 20 \]. [**Shrubification in the ROW has been linked to
permafrost** thaw and soil disturbances resulting from pipeline
construction and operation]{.underline} \[ 11 ,12 ,18 \]. However, how
permafrost thaw influences shrubification in the ROW along pipeline
corridors remains evasive \[21\].

oil pipeline, develop phasedown plan,"
https://apnews.com/article/alaska-oil-pipeline-climate-study-4d2929115f3e31495d21cdbc9ceaa322)//GOATKUNA

[JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) --- Environmental groups on Wednesday petitioned
the U.S. Department of Interior to review climate impacts related to the
decades-old trans-Alaska pipeline system]{.underline} and develop a plan
for a "managed phasedown" of the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) pipeline,
which is Alaska's economic lifeline.

The request comes more than a year after the Biden administration
approved the massive Willow oil project on Alaska's petroleum-rich North
Slope, a decision that was welcomed by Alaska political leaders seeking
to stem a trend of declining oil production in the state and by many
Alaska Native leaders in the region who see the project as economically
vital for their communities. Willow, which is being developed by
ConocoPhillips Alaska, could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day.

[Some of the groups who filed the petition, including the Center for
Biological Diversity and Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, are
among those who have asked an appeals court to overturn the approval of
Willow]{.underline}. A decision is pending.

[Oil flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline system averaged around
470,000 barrels a day last year. At its peak, in the late 1980s, about 2
million barrels a day flowed through the line, which began operating in
1977.]{.underline}

The last environmental analysis, done more than 20 years ago as part of
a right-of-way renewal, is "woefully outdated," the groups said in their
petition. They cite the rapid warming and changes the Arctic region has
experienced, noting that several ice-reliant species, such as polar
bears, have received Endangered Species Act protections since the last
review. [They also raise concerns about the impacts of thawing
permafrost on the pipeline infrastructure. While the next environmental
review is expected in about a decade, that's too long to
wait]{.underline}, they argue.

["Every drop of oil that moves through the pipeline is more climate
devastation, both here in Alaska and around the world,]{.underline}"
said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director for the Center for Biological
Diversity. "The longer we wait to have this hard conversation about the
inevitable --- because we must transition off of fossil fuels and we
have to do it urgently --- the harder it's going to be for Alaska."

Michelle Egan, a spokesperson for pipeline operator Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co., said in a statement that the company continues to
"collaborate with our numerous federal and state regulatory partners as
we meet our commitments to safe and environmentally responsible
operations. We are steadfast and dedicated to being a prudent operator,
safely and reliably transporting oil from the North Slope of Alaska into
the future."

Freeman said Interior can accept the groups' request or deny it, which
the groups could challenge. If Interior doesn't respond in what would be
considered a reasonable amount of time, the groups can seek to compel a
response through the courts, he said.

Interior did not have a comment, spokesperson Giovanni Rocco said by
email.

The petition asks that the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which falls
under Interior, evaluate a range of options that include not renewing
the right-of-way, issuing a right-of-way for a period of 10 or fewer
years to allow for "continuous re-evaluation of the landscape in which
TAPS operates," [setting potential limits on how much oil flows through
the pipeline and requiring North Slope oil producers to adopt emissions
controls for their operations.]{.underline}

The groups say the "only rational conclusion of that analysis will be a
managed phasedown of the pipeline," and their petition calls on the land
management agency to begin work on such a plan. It doesn't suggest a
timeline for a phasedown.

"We're not asking for the pipeline to shut down tomorrow. [We're saying
you need to start the conversation now," Freeman said. "That includes
extensive conversation, engagement, consultation with communities across
Alaska, especially on the North Slope]{.underline}. \... The longer we
wait, the more pain for people, wildlife and the climate, especially
here in Alaska."

[The mining and metallurgical industry of the Arctic is also faced with
the problem of **local ore fields depletion**]{.underline}, many of
which have been developed since the 30s of the last century. An urgent
scientific and technical problem that is being solved by the Kola
Scientific Center of Russian Academy of Sciences scientists is the
development of [technologies that allow additional extraction of useful
components from substandard ores and mining and processing
waste]{.underline}. In the last decade, pilot work has begun on heap
leaching of poor copper-nickel sulphide ores, in which useful components
are extracted from the ore using special solutions. About 20 percent of
copper is produced in the world today using this technology.

[**Black carbon (BC) poses a huge threat to the Arctic**, polluting
snow, darkening its surface. This enhances the **absorption of solar
radiation**, heating the snow and causing it to melt]{.underline}. Due
to their low weight, [BC particles are **spread by air currents over
huge areas**, which makes the Arctic a particularly vulnerable part of
the planet]{.underline} (Chen et al., 2021). [Thus]{.underline}, [the
largest source of BC emissions in the Murmansk region is the mining
industry]{.underline}, which accounts for 71% of total emissions. There
are at least 250 diesel- powered mining trucks operating in the
industry, [which are a significant source of BC emissions]{.underline}.
Because mining truck engines have a relatively short lifespan, there are
many options to choose from to reduce emissions, such as investing in
replacing engines with cleaner engines that run on LNG. In this case,
fuel efficiency can increase by 5-15% and BC emissions can sharply
decrease with a relatively small increase in engine cost (Kholod et al.,
2015).

[**The primary causes** of the environmental effects caused by
generating oil and gas are production activities (such as the upkeep or
substitution of facility components), the handling of waste (such as
produced water), noise from well operations, com- pressor or pump
stations, flare stack, automobiles and machinery, worker presence, and
potential spills]{.underline} (Fig. 9.1). Kuch and Bavumiragira \[29\]
elucidate the potential impact of these activities on available
resources. [**Drilling in the Arctic Ocean would expose aquatic
organisms** to additional environmental stressors, such as pollution,
noise pollution, and disturbances from other sources.]{.underline}
[Aquatic life is already nega- tively impacted by warming sea and air
temperatures.]{.underline} Compressor and pumping stations, producing
wells (which may involve flaring on occasion), and vehicle traf- fic are
the major causes of noise during conventional oil and gas production.
When a compressor station is located one mile (1.6 km) away, the noise
levels produced range from 64 to 86 dBA at the station to 58--75 dBA.
Residents, tourists, and [wild- life would all experience **localized
disturbances** as a result of noise. According to Kuche and Bavumiragira
\[29\], noise resulting from cavitation poses a significant threat to
cattle, wildlife,]{.underline} and land owners.

Seeds sprout, grow, and ultimately reach maturity in the soil substrate,
where water, air, and essential resources are accessible to encourage
healthy plant growth for profitable and effective agriculture. [Because
crude oil spills into agricultural soils frequently and fouls all living
things, the soil, especially the biologically active surface layer,
becomes **toxic and unusable**. The majority of the vital nutrients are
no longer accessible for use by plants and crops due to the oil's
reduction of the soil's fertility]{.underline}. The mangrove vegetation,
which has been disappearing recently, is a per- fect example of the
extreme toxicity of oil spills on agricultural performance. Crude oil
spills diminish and restrict permeability because they are denser than
water. The organic hydrocarbons occupying the soil pores force out air
and water, denying the roots of the plants of essential nutrients.
Degradable soil properties include appear- ance, infiltration, hydraulic
conductivity, humidity, and density. These properties affect root and
developmental stages of leaves, plant growth, and yield. These prop-
erties affect root and developmental stages of leaves, plant growth, and
yield. [Overall, crop output and farm income were impacted by oil
spills, which in turn had an **impact on farming communities'
socioeconomic livelihoods \[29\].**]{.underline}

[Exploiting natural gas and crude oil may have **negative consequences
on ecologi- cal resources**, such as: poisoning biota; upsetting
wildlife with noise and human activities; and killing biota in accidents
with cars or above-ground constructions.]{.underline} [Ecological
resources are impacted by the presence of producing wells, ancillary
facilities, and access roads because they lower habitat quality and
disturb]{.underline} the biota \[29\]. Some species may experience
disruptions to their migratory patterns and other activities due to the
existence of an oil field. [When produced water is improperly released
onto land or into bodies of surface water, the salinity levels can rise
to a point where plants cannot survive]{.underline}. According to Jones
et al. \[27\], [wildlife exposed to petroleum-based chemicals and other
contaminants in conserved pits and water management system is always at
risk. They can suffocate from cold stress if the oil affects the
insulation that feathers and fur give, or they can get entangled in the
oil and drown]{.underline}. They can also consume hazardous amounts of
oil by preening (for birds) or licking it (for mammals). Where [produced
water and solid wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive
material (NORM) are generated, **improper handling of these wastes can
lead to radioactive pollution** of surface water bodies or
soils]{.underline} \[29\]. When taking into account [the detrimental
effects of oil drilling]{.underline}, polar bears are another important
concern. Given that polar bears are the largest land carnivore in the
world and one of the most well-known and endearing creatures, it is
understand- able that many people are very worried about the potential
effects of drilling in the refuge of the bear population. The Southern
Beaufort Sea population of polar bears, one of just two subpopulations
in the United States, numbers about 1500 and is found in the Alaskan
National Wildlife Refuge. Unfortunately, it appears that arctic oil
extraction poses a serious threat to this community. Selecting the ideal
time of year to enter the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and
begin drilling is a key planning consideration. A number of oil
corporations suggested restricting their operations in the Refuge to the
winter months exclusively in an effort to lessen their environmental
effects, since this would help most of the local species. Sadly, polar
bears do not belong to the list of animals that this proposal will help.
Since polar bears undergo denning during the winter, which makes them
especially vulnerable to disturbances, drilling during the winter would
be extremely harmful to them \[50\]. As a result, this
"environmentally-conscious" approach is ultimately devalued.

[Oil appears to have an impact on seed germination in two different
ways. High levels of crude oil pollution likely **inhibit seeds from
germination** because the oil soaks through the outer layer of the seed
coat. The presence of oil slows down seed germination at low levels of
crude oil contamination.]{.underline} The impact of crude oil on plants
is quite concerning since [it damages several plant components that are
essen- tial to their life and well-being, which prevents the plants from
developing and growing.]{.underline} Research revealed that [plants
impacted by oil had a tendency for their leaves to get dehydrated and
display a generalized symptom of chlorosis]{.underline}, which is
indicative of a lack of water. One possibility for the decrease in leaf
area is dehydra- tion. Research indicates that the noteworthy decline in
the [ultimate germination percentage across all species could perhaps be
**attributed to the deleterious impact of crude oil** on seed and
inadequate soil aeration]{.underline}. It has been determined through
numerous experiments that [a crude oil spill would have the following
effects on plants: prevent a plant's germination; prolong the lag phase
by causing stress, which delays germination; and prevent the plant's
roots from absorbing water and nutri- ents, which results in
deficiencies in other plant parts like the leaves, impacts the regrowth
of stump, and impacts the leaves' anatomical features]{.underline}
\[29\].

A decline in the activity of enzymes that break down starch as well as a
reduction in the amount of whole proteins, carbohydrates, and amino
acids are other notewor- thy symptoms of growing plants found in
oil-contaminated soil. [**The deadliest con- dition brought on by
pollutants, such as crude oil and petroleum hydrocarbons, on plants is
oxidative stress,** which causes a variety of reactive oxygen species
(ROSs) with strong oxidizing potential to form in cells]{.underline}
(superoxide radical (O2∙−), H2O2, hydroxyl radical (∙OH), etc.). One way
that the ROSs hinders growth activity is by destroying cell-membrane
complexes, interfering with intracellular reactions and transport
activities \[28\].

Plants, on the other hand, depend on ROS buildup for both defense and
develop- ment since they use ROS as a second messenger in numerous
signal transduction cascades. These factors make the plant antioxidative
defense network essential for limiting the duration of ROS signals and
averting unchecked oxidation \[47\]. [Water resources are pressured when
oil is sought in locations with limited water supplies. While oil
shipment and distribution increase the hazard to the ecosystem in the
event of leaks or fatalities, offshore oil exploration poses risks to
marine life.]{.underline} In the fields of pipeline conveyance, shale
gas exploration, the extraction of oil, and oil tanker transportation,
accidents, leaks, and spills are inevitable. The effects of pol- lution
from oil production on surface and subsurface waters represent a major
risk. An effluent release or an oil spill causes seepage into the
ground, where it mixes with the subterranean water system. It has been
discovered that cleaning up con- taminated subterranean water takes many
years. [The only sources of local water supply in the community are
streams and wells, where this subsurface water flows, leading to an
increase in **water-borne illnesses.** In the areas where oil is found,
this has had an impact on the inhabitants' customary relationship with
water. It is evi- dent that people are afraid these water systems, which
once provided life, are now the causes of suffering, illness, and even
death.]{.underline}

Already reeling from the impacts of climate change and plastic
pollution, our ocean now faces another threat: [deep-sea
mining]{.underline}. The massive [machines]{.underline} that would be
deployed to mine the seabed for critical minerals [would **destroy ocean
ecosystems**]{.underline} that developed over tens of millions of years.
[**Entire habitats would be wiped out**; scraping ore-rich crusts from
seamounts would be akin to mountaintop coal removal, **killing corals**
and other **immobile species**]{.underline}.

[Mining proponents maintain]{.underline} that [seabed minerals must be
mined to support clean-energy technologies]{.underline}, but a report by
Planet Tracker casts doubt on this claim. Ocean Conservancy rejects
industry's assertion as **[a false choice]{.underline}**. Instead, we
call for a global moratorium on seabed mining.

The ocean plastics crisis serves as a potent reminder that the
[recycling]{.underline} of [materials]{.underline} we are already using
[should be prioritized over]{.underline} the [production]{.underline} of
virgin materials. Scaling EV battery recycling to achieve 100%
circularity combined with the next generation of nickel- and cobalt-free
batteries are alternative strategies that could obviate the need for
deep-sea minerals or metals.

Some claim deep-sea mining is justified because the deep sea is
relatively lifeless, but this is patently untrue. [Earlier this year,
scientists discovered 5,000 new species in the]{.underline}
Clarion-Clipperton Zone ([CCZ]{.underline}) [alone]{.underline},
including the enigmatic gummy squirrel and the delicate star-shaped
dytaster. [The CCZ seafloor]{.underline}, located between Hawaii and
Mexico, [is rich in potato-sized nodules that deep-sea mining companies
are hungry to extract for critical minerals, **directly threatening a
variety of sea creatures**, some **newly discovered or even unknown to
science**]{.underline}.

[Mineral-rich hydrothermal vents serve as another habitat in the deep
sea and support]{.underline} a diversity of [unique animals **found
nowhere else**]{.underline} on Earth, some [with **huge biomedical
potential**]{.underline}. For example, [scientists isolated an enzyme
from a microbe living near a vent that led to]{.underline} the
development of [a test for]{.underline} diagnosing
[COVID]{.underline}-19. How many [species]{.underline} could [we lose to
deep-sea mining]{.underline} that [might]{.underline} otherwise [be the
**next antibiotic or anti-cancer drug**]{.underline}?

It's not just the immediate seabed that is at risk from mining. An
analysis by Ocean Conservancy raises concerns about the impacts of
seabed mining in United States federal waters on species living in the
water column. Our paper explains that [commercially valuable
fishes]{.underline} in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands or Gulf of
Alaska (two areas with prospective critical minerals) [could be
susceptible to sediment plumes generated by mining]{.underline}
operations. Researchers confirm that [jellyfishes]{.underline} living at
depths of 1,500-2,000 feet in the mesopelagic zone [showed signs of
stress when exposed to sediments]{.underline} like those found at
potential mining sites. This is important because [mesopelagic species
are **critical to the ocean food web and the carbon cycle**. Harm from
mining tailings]{.underline} (toxic byproducts of mining), potentially
[traveling hundreds of miles]{.underline}, [could have **major
ecological** and **climate-ripple effects**]{.underline}.

Another major concern is ineffective governance. The International
Seabed Authority (ISA) is the body charged with managing the
international seabed for "the common heritage of mankind" while ensuring
sufficient measures are in place to protect the marine environment.
Tragically, this mandate is not unfolding in practice. Corporate mining
interests have an outsized influence at the ISA, which calls into
question the credibility of this body to develop effective regulations
that are centered around ocean health.

Unfortunately, until [the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} ratifies
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it [has no voting
authority at ISA]{.underline}. A group of bipartisan senators is now
urging ratification so that the United States can have a voice in seabed
mining decisions.

But even without a voice at the ISA, the Biden administration can and
must take immediate and meaningful action here at home. First, it should
issue a moratorium on mining in United States federal waters to
safeguard the health of species, habitats, fisheries and critical seabed
infrastructure such as telecommunications cables. Second, it can and
must avoid incentivizing the destruction of the deep sea outside the
United States by prohibiting the importation of marine minerals that
would otherwise be eligible for electric vehicle tax credits under the
Inflation Reduction Act.

We have too often witnessed the unchecked damage extractive industries
inflict on our ocean. [The fossil fuel industry has left countless
scars]{.underline}: thousands of miles of pipelines, oil wells boring
deep into the seabed and oil spills laying waste to marine ecosystems
and wildlife. These serve as sobering reminders that seabed mining would
further harm our ocean.

[The United States must send a strong message]{.underline} to the world
[that we can transition from fossil fuels]{.underline} to clean-energy
technologies **[without needlessly sacrificing fragile and remote
deep-ocean ecosystems]{.underline}**.

for a precautionary approach in the regulation, management, and
administration of this activity. From a cultural and social perspective,
DSM is certainly alleviating the "Not in My Back Yard" syndrome as DSM
infrastructure placed in the deep sea does not disturb the landscape and
therefore does not pose as many societal non-acceptance reactions, as in
the case of offshore wind energy power or other energy infrastructure at
sea. However, [DSM activities could conflict with environmental assets
such as fisheries, shipping lanes, and submarine cables]{.underline}.
Yet, there is inconsistent knowledge about the desirability of DSM or
how the public perceived this type of activity, except one study that
has used interviews and focus groups to explore what the community\'s
reactions would be should exploration go on (Mason et al., 2010).

**[The deep sea plays a vital role in Earth\'s health]{.underline}**

This [richness and diversity of organisms]{.underline} in the deep sea
[support ecosystem processes **necessary for the Earth's natural systems
to function**. The deep ocean]{.underline} also [constitutes more than
90**% of all the living space on the planet** and plays a key role
in]{.underline} services such as [climate regulation, fisheries
production, and elemental cycling]{.underline}. It is an integral part
of the culture and well-being of local communities and the seafloor
forms part of the world's Common Heritage, which belongs to everyone on
the planet and everyone yet to come.

The more we, marine scientists, learn about the complexity and
importance of life in the deep ocean, the more we realise the great
peril it faces. [Deep-sea ecosystems are under stress from]{.underline}
a number of human stressors, including [climate change, destructive
bottom trawling and pollution]{.underline}. And new threats loom on the
horizon.

[Deep-sea mining]{.underline}, a new industry that may be given the
green light to begin operating as early as 2023, [will **add to these
stresses**. It could result in the **loss of deep-sea biod**iversity and
**disruptions of ecosystem functioning and services that
could**]{.underline} last millennia or even **[be
permanent]{.underline}**.

The risks of deep-sea mining are not fully understood

[To compound these concerns]{.underline} about the risks of deep-sea
mining, [a recent study]{.underline} has [revealed]{.underline} just
[how little experts know]{.underline} about the parts of the planet
already leased for mining exploration and how they might be affected by
mining activities. In fact, 57.8% of the scientific categories assessed
for regions with mining exploration areas were shown to have no or next
to no scientific knowledge to enable evidence-based management. Only
1.1% had enough. [Without environmental, biodiversity and ecological
information, the potential risks of deep-sea mining]{.underline} to
deep-ocean biodiversity, ecosystems and functioning, as well as human
well-being, **[cannot be fully understood]{.underline}**.

Global calls grow to pause deep-sea mining

The gravity of these concerns made deep-sea mining the talk of the town
at the recent United Nations Ocean Conference in Lisbon. Here, countries
such as France, Palau, Fiji, and Samoa, joined parliamentarians, youth
leaders, Hollywood stars, companies, such as BMW, Google, Volkswagen and
Volvo, banks, such as Credit Suisse, Lloyd's, Standard Chartered, and
NatWest and over 600 scientists from 44 countries to call for a pause to
deep-sea mining. With the second part of the International Seabed
Authority's annual negotiations following swiftly on the heels of
Lisbon, this could be the first meeting in decades where a pause on
deep-sea mining is meaningfully discussed.

The United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development,
launched last year, provides an opportune period in which to collect
more information about the species and ecosystems that could be affected
by deep-sea mining -- before not after this industry begins. As
scientists, we deeply value evidence-based decision-making, especially
in instances as consequential as a global decision to open an entirely
new frontier of the ocean to large-scale industrial resource
exploitation.

[The sheer importance of the ocean to our planet and people, and the
risk of large-scale and permanent loss of biodiversity, ecosystems, and
functioning, necessitate a **pause of all efforts to begin mining of the
deep sea**]{.underline}. Unlike Pliny the Elder, we must recognise that
**[we are far from having all the answers]{.underline}** about things
concealed in the deep, and instead take intelligent precautions and
accelerate independent research, so that we can gain a better
understanding of what is truly at stake.

Possibly [the greatest restriction to commercial DSM]{.underline}
activities [is the environmental question]{.underline}: can the
environmental impacts be justified by the overall benefits? This aspect
surrounds environmental impacts of DSM of PMN deposits, rather than the
impact of the environment on mining operations, which is discussed in
the "Economic barriers to DSM of PMNs" section. In order to solve this
conundrum, the environmental impacts must first be known. This section
considers environmental barriers to PMN mining by assessing the specific
environmental impacts of PMN mining where possible, though acknowledging
similarities between PMN mining and other DSM activities.

[The deep sea]{.underline} (\> 200-m depth) [represents 95% of the
global biosphere by habitable volume]{.underline}, though [an
overwhelming proportion]{.underline} of it [remains **totally
unexplored**]{.underline} (Miller et al. 2018, and references therein).
As such, it is accepted that [there are **vast knowledge gaps**
regarding deep-sea ecosystems and their responses to anthropological
activities]{.underline} (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2011). Even more poorly
understood, by virtue of this initial knowledge gap, is the impact of
DSM on deep-sea ecosystems, resulting in strong opposition to DSM
activities.

[It is expected that DSM will]{.underline} likely [affect marine
ecosystems **at every depth**]{.underline} at which it operates,
[including the seabed, the water column, and the surface]{.underline}
(Kaikkonen et al. 2021), [as well as producing **terrestrial
environmental disturbances** as a result of the processing]{.underline}
of the PMNs [themselves]{.underline} (Habashi 2012). This being said,
some early predictions have suggested that whilst the environmental
consequences will be far reaching, impact will decrease away from the
mining site (Boschen et al. 2013; Van Dover 2014). In spite of this, the
annual mining footprint will likely be within the region of hundreds to
thousands of km 2 per year (Oebius et al. 2001; Jones et al. 2017), and
it is believed that [disturbance from a single mining operation could
be]{.underline} 2--[fourfold greater than its initial
footprint]{.underline} (Smith et al. 2020).

A fundamental issue with DSM activities is [the]{.underline} much [lower
current velocity in deep-sea environments]{.underline} to other aquatic
environments (Morgunov et al. 2014; Shanmugam 2021), which results in
lower rates of sedimentation and nutrient replenishment (Hjulström 1935;
Chen 2008). This, in turn, [amplifies **any physical effect that DSM
has** on the environment]{.underline} in terms of both time and
intensity, [as a result of artificial turbidity and sediment plume
generation. Physical evidence of experimental]{.underline} PMN
collection [activity, in the form of equipment tracks]{.underline} in
seafloor sand, [was still present 37 years after the activity had taken
place]{.underline}, demonstrating the environment's poor recovery rate
(Khripounoff et al. 2006). When it is taken into account that epifaunal
densities of PMNs are over twice that of PMN-free areas, and that [PMN
mining is likely to remove all epifauna as well as have significant
impacts on benthic fauna in the water column]{.underline} (Vanreusel et
al. 2016), the immediate and severe effect of DSM on the local
environment becomes difficult to justify (Jones et al. 2017).

Though some suspected environmental impacts have been well
substantiated, it is still believed that [the impacts are grossly
miscalculated]{.underline}. This is [due to underestimating DSM
footprints relative to habitats targeted]{.underline}, as well as large
knowledge gaps regarding the sensitivity, biodiversity, and dynamics of
deep-sea ecosystems (Smith et al. 2020). Critically, there are still
many unknown unknowns, meaning that the [initial baseline
assumptions]{.underline} against which to compare [are **far from
sufficiently comprehensive to draw even remotely accurate conclusions
regarding the environmental impacts of DSM**]{.underline} activities
(Heffernan 2019).

These huge data gaps represent a significant challenge for the DSM
industry, with the majority of opposition resulting from environmental
concerns (Miller et al. 2018). The ISA's [permitting]{.underline}
procedure works [using a precautionary approach]{.underline}, requiring
that prospecting and exploration activities should not be undertaken "if
substantial evidence indicates the risk of serious harm to the marine
environment" (International Seabed Authority 2013), though this may be
seen as a principle of 'harmless unless proven harmful'. Exploitation
permits, according to the Draft Regulations, may be granted if the
environmental plans "provide for the effective protection of the Marine
Environment in accordance with Article 145 of the Convention \[UNCLOS\],
including through the application of a precautionary approach and Good
Industry Practice" (International Seabed Authority 2021). Article 145
requires that "necessary measures be taken...to ensure effective
protection for the environment from harmful effects which may arise from
such activities" (United Nations 1982). [Given]{.underline} that [there
is insufficient baseline information available, the ISA
may]{.underline}, in theory, [justifiably grant PMN prospecting,
exploration, and/or exploitation permits for environmentally harmful
activities]{.underline}, worrying many opponents of DSM practices.

Alternatively, it could be argued that the ISA does not have the same
economic incentives to grant permits for potentially environmentally
detrimental activities in the way a national government may (Waye et al.
2010). This argument is strengthened by the ISA's mandate "to ensure the
effective protection of the marine environment from harmful effects that
may arise from deep-seabed related activities" (International Seabed
Authority 2021), which may reduce the ISA's scope for interpretation of
environmental protection, encouraging more stringent regulatory controls
in regard to permitting. Some academic opinions refute this, believing
that the ISA has more of an economic focus than is openly suggested. It
is argued that "protection of the marine environment was not the driving
force behind the development of the international seabed mining regime.
Rather, the focus was on establishing a regime to regulate access to
seabed minerals and the sharing of benefits from their exploitation"
(Jaeckel and Rayfuse 2017). This argument is formulated on the premise
that the ISA are in the process of developing a permitting framework for
an activity of which the environmental impacts are far too uncertain to
develop regulations ensuring the protection of the environment. As a
result of this, [there is currently a lack of transparency in the
decision-making process regarding]{.underline} exploitation
[permits]{.underline}. The Draft Regulations require an Environmental
Impact Statement, an Environmental Management and Monitoring Plan, and a
Closure Plan to be included in the final permit application (ISA 2018).
These documents are scrutinised by the ISA's Legal and Technical
Commission, who must consider comments from members of the Authority as
well as Stakeholders, though unanimous consent is not required. [The
opacity regarding exact criteria for acceptance, as well as a lack of
baseline environmental information]{.underline} in which to ground the
environmental submissions, [are a **notable barrier to DSM
activities**]{.underline} in the near future.

[Further to these environmental barriers is the additional **unanswered
question of liability**]{.underline} in case of damage. [With many
potential environmental impacts]{.underline} yet to be discovered,
[there is a distinct possibility that DSM of PMN deposits will create
some degree of environmental degradation which will **remain undetected
until after the damage is done**. There is]{.underline}, as yet, [no
clearly defined landscape for liability]{.underline} in the event of
environmental damage (MacMaster 2019). [As pollutants]{.underline} can
[travel]{.underline} much further in water, [the extent of the damage
may be significantly higher than]{.underline} that of [a similar
terrestrial incident]{.underline} (Likens and Bormann 1974; Halfar and
Fujita 2002). [This]{.underline}, in turn, **[increases
the]{.underline}** potential **[severity of any environmental
damage]{.underline}** arising from DSM activities, [and]{.underline}
thus [the cost of indemnity insurance]{.underline} for operators,
sponsor States, or flag States 4 --- it has even been suggested that the
ISA may bear some liability for environmental impacts related to DSM
(MacMaster 2019). This **[vast legal uncertainty must be resolved prior
to commercial DSM activities beginning, or else
operators]{.underline}**, sponsor States, and flag States **[risk having
to ultimately bear the cost arising from the production of any negative
externalities]{.underline}** related to DSM activities in which they are
involved.

[Atmosphere-based geoengineerin]{.underline}g technologies [would have
**far-reaching, global impacts on biod**iversity across all biomes.
Deployment]{.underline} of solar radiation management (SRM) technologies
[would introduce **novel risks associated with light dimming** and the
**threat of termination shock**, putting biodiversity and ecosystem
functions at risk of suffering **irreversible damages**]{.underline}.1

Simulations show that [even if light dimming]{.underline} --- which
describes the effect of Earth receiving less solar radiation --- [were
**globally perfectly uniform**]{.underline} using stratospheric aerosol
injection (SAI), **[surface temperatures would not]{.underline}**
uniformly **[fall]{.underline}** to either preindustrial or current
conditions at the regional level. 14 SAI-induced [dimming would reduce
the temperature gradient between the equator and the poles, resulting in
**excess cooling in the tropics, excess warming in the poles, or
both**]{.underline} compared to existing conditions.15 This is
significant as it signals that **[even if planetary cooling were
achieved, ecosystems would still experience the adverse effects of
regional temperature changes, decreasing their long-term
resilience]{.underline}**.

Marine cloud brightening ([MCB]{.underline}) [is expected
to]{.underline} also [result in **unevenly distributed temperature
shifts**]{.underline}, ultimately [altering the land-sea temperature
gradient]{.underline}.16 [Doing so would]{.underline} likely
**[significantly impact]{.underline}** several of [**Earth's
subsystems**, including shifts in mean annual precipitation patterns,
**increased warming in the Arctic** and Antarctic, uneven terrestrial
warming, and marine cooling]{.underline}.17 [These effects]{.underline}
are likely to [**stress ecosystems**, putting them]{.underline} further
[in danger of **reaching their tipping points** and undermining their
ability to keep us in the Holocene. As a result of uneven cooling and
physical harms caused to micro marine life during the pumping of
seawater, MCB would]{.underline} also [modify food webs through **harm
to primary producers** and alter the vertical structure of the water
column]{.underline}, likely [making **ocean stratification more
pronounced**]{.underline}, thereby [leading to changes in the ocean's
biogeochemical cycling with consequences for carbon sequestration and
oxygen cycling that are not yet understood]{.underline}.18

Enhancing marine [microbubbles]{.underline} is a proposed albedo
enhancement technology that would use surfactants --- chemical
substances used to reduce surface tension --- to cause the bubbles left
in ships' wake to linger. This [could]{.underline} potentially [result
in a marine temperature decrease]{.underline} of up to 0.5ºC, which
proponents argue could be protective of marine life.19 [However,
increased ocean acidification would offset the protection of cooler
temperatures]{.underline}. A cooler ocean is more able to absorb CO 2
from the atmosphere,20 increasing ocean acidification and amplifying its
negative effects on marine biodiversity, including harm to corals and
shelled species like oysters. 21 Additionally, [the surfactants
needed]{.underline} to achieve enhanced marine microbubbles [would
inhibit the oceans' gas exchanges with the atmosphere]{.underline}.22
[Inhibited gas exchanges are likely to have harmful impacts on marine
ecosystems due to decreased dissolved oxygen and increased dissolved CO
2 with not yet fully understood consequences for marine
biodiversity]{.underline}.23

[Idealized SRM is likely to **impact the hydrologic cycle
negatively**]{.underline}.24 SRM may offset some regional precipitation
changes associated with unmitigated climate change, but overall, it is
expected under a uniform dimming scenario that SAI [**tech**nologies
will **slow the planetary hydrologic cycle**, resulting in a 2 percent
global decrease in mean precipitation]{.underline} compared to the
current climate.25 Such a decrease is expected to be [most pronounced
over land and/or in equatorial regions that host **significant amounts
of biod**iversity]{.underline}26 [and over monsoon regions]{.underline}
in the Southern and Northern Hemisphere.27 [One such
country]{.underline} that would be majorly impacted [is]{.underline}
"**[megadiverse]{.underline}**" **[Indonesia]{.underline}** --- [home
to]{.underline} approximately [10 percent of all flowering plant
species, 12 percent of all mammal species, 16 percent of all reptiles,
and 17 percent of all birds, as well as 40 million rural Indonesians who
rely on **biod**iversity for subsistence]{.underline} needs.28
Similarly, "megadiverse" nations that would be impacted include
Colombia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ecuador, Gabon, and
Malaysia.

Additionally, [SAI will]{.underline} likely [have a negative impact on
the ozone]{.underline} layer. Without robust ozone, [Earth would receive
**more UV radiation, especially in**]{.underline} the **[polar
regions]{.underline}** in their respective springs, with the greatest
increases observed from March to April for the Arctic.29 [Polar species,
plants, and animals are **comparatively slow to adapt**]{.underline} to
environmental perturbations, [meaning]{.underline} these [ozone
changes]{.underline} and their implications [would]{.underline} likely
[affect]{.underline} those [species least able to respond]{.underline}
to its associated challenges. The ultimate biodiversity consequences of
increased UV reaching Earth will depend on the type of UV that would
increase most, which is not known and cannot be sufficiently modeled at
this time.30 [Humans are]{.underline} also [likely to suffer from
increased UV exposure]{.underline}, given that UV damage is associated
with skin cancer as well as eye damage.31

Furthermore, [**ocean acidification is likely to worsen** in a world
prioritizing SRM deployment]{.underline} over decarbonization. [Since
SRM does not reduce]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions]{.underline},
CO 2 [emissions and ocean acidification would continue]{.underline}
under SRM deployment. [The long-term consequences of unmitigated ocean
acidification include direct and indirect harms to marine organisms'
skeleton formation, gas exchange abilities, reproduction, growth, and
neural functions]{.underline}.32 [These harms will have **negative
consequences for life at all levels of the food chain** and put
fisheries and those dependent upon them at risk]{.underline}.

Changes in Light

Marine [microbubbles, MCB, idealized SAI, and ocean fertilization may
**decrease**]{.underline} photosynthetically active radiation
(**[PAR]{.underline}**) [and increase the amount of diffuse light
reaching Earth and penetrating the oceans]{.underline}. 33 PAR describes
the range of light that photosynthetic organisms can use for
photosynthesis, and diffuse light is refracted sunlight, which has
spread out evenly over an area. As plant productivity is directly
dependent on the ability of a plant to intercept solar radiation, net
primary production is linearly related to PAR.34 Decreases in available
PAR are likely to decrease net primary production and CO 2 storage in
plants and, in turn, decrease crop outputs, thereby negatively impacting
food security. The total harm from decreased PAR will ultimately depend
upon the scale and duration of SRM technologies if deployed.

In contrast, gross primary plant production may increase with higher
amounts of diffuse light, providing more uniform light distribution
through tree canopies.35 However, as with the above-described
hydrological changes, [increased primary plant production is not a good
proxy for biodiversity as not all species would benefit from these
changes]{.underline}.36 [Less PAR and more diffuse light may be unable
to penetrate the ocean as deeply as unaltered sunlight]{.underline}.37
Therefore, it is likely that [SRM deployment would **decrease marine
primary production, disrupt the food webs of the oceans, and weaken
ecosystems globally**]{.underline}.

[Changes in polarized light are]{.underline} also [anticipated to impact
marine ecosystems where many species]{.underline} --- mainly fish,
mollusks, and arthropods38 --- [use polarized light]{.underline} in ways
not yet fully understood, including [for navigation, prey
identification, and reproduction]{.underline}.39 [Changes in polarized
light have the capacity]{.underline} "[to **drastically increase
mortality and reproductive failure in animal
populations**]{.underline},"40 [resulting in changes to these species'
communities and later ecological interactions]{.underline}.41 In the
marine context, these [disruptions]{.underline} in polarized light [may
result in the partial loss of marine ecosystem functions such as CO 2
uptake, oxygen provisioning, nutrient cycling, and food
availability]{.underline}.

Lock-In and Termination Shock

For SRM to have its intended effect, the Earth would be locked into
using these risky technologies for an indeterminate amount of time while
emissions were reduced by highly speculative CDR approaches, with
so-called "peak-shaving" scenarios for stratospheric aerosol injection
implying deployment on the order of 100 to 200 years.42 [The practical
and geopolitical challenges of maintaining]{.underline} the deployment
of a [planetary-scale operation]{.underline} such as this [over multiple
generations are clear]{.underline}. Yet **[any abrupt pause or cessation
of SRM]{.underline}** (including SAI 43 and MCB44) [**would result in
rapid temperature increases, known as termination shock**. Under the
temperature masking effects]{.underline} of these technologies,
[ecosystems become **even less resilient to climate
change**]{.underline}, likely [leading to greater **species death,
degradation of ecosystem functions**, and **severe socioeconomic
consequences**]{.underline} if they are stopped.45 [The only way to
avoid termination shock]{.underline} once these technologies have been
deployed [would be through a gradual, long wind down]{.underline}
enabled by global deployment of CDR techniques. [Given that no such
pathway is credible the potential deployment of SRM effectively ensures
**they could never be stopped**]{.underline}.

The [legitimizing]{.underline} of [solar geoengineering is]{.underline}
emerging as [a **major threat**]{.underline} to climate justice. [Solar
geoengineering]{.underline} is the ultimate "technical fix" \[4.17\]
\[4.18\] \[4.19\]; it [does **nothing** to address the cause of climate
change]{.underline}, and the social, political and ecological risks of
advancing this cannot be understated \[4.13\]. [Solar
geoengineering]{.underline} technology [creates a mechanism for powerful
elites to manipulate the Earth's climate system]{.underline} for their
advantage. [There is no way for this technology to benefit all
regions]{.underline} of the world [equally]{.underline}, so if and when
it was deployed, [some places may experience climate
benefits]{.underline} but [**other areas could be worse off**. Because
the Earth's systems are]{.underline} so [**complex and interconnected**,
attempts to manipulate the climate would have **unpredictable cascading
impacts**]{.underline}. Among the many potential unintended
consequences, [changes to the Earth's hydrological cycle
could]{.underline}, for example, **[disrupt]{.underline}** the
[**monsoon season** which would threaten **ag**riculture, reduce **food
production**, and **restrict drinking water access**]{.underline}
\[4.16\]. Another danger is that [the prospect of this
non-transformative technology could]{.underline} continue to **[slow
down and detract from larger systemic changes to address climate
injustices]{.underline}** and human suffering.

Although those advocating for solar geoengineering often qualify their
advocacy by saying that advancing this technology should not reduce the
urgency for other responses to the climate crisis, them saying that does
not mean that it is not. Given that [many of the strongest
supporters]{.underline} of solar geoengineering [are technology
billionaires]{.underline} who are **[NOT advocating for or investing in
social, political or economic changes]{.underline}** as a response to
climate change, [it is clear]{.underline} that [the potential of solar
geoengineering is diverting interest and investment in more
transformative changes]{.underline}.

The claim that just because the scientists advocating for solar
geoengineering care about climate mitigation, solar geoengineering
deployment will not detract from other climate mitigation efforts is
naïve. This claim falsely assumes that the intentions and commitments of
the scientists who develop a technology shape how the technology is
deployed once it is developed \[4.20\]. This claim also misrepresents
and idealizes the power of the scientists advocating for solar
geoengineering research. Despite their confidence in knowing how the
world works, it needs to be acknowledged that [the decision of whether,
when and how to deploy solar geoengineering will not be made
by]{.underline} the [scientists]{.underline} who are advancing the
technology \[4.20\]. It is much more likely that [authoritarian leaders
like]{.underline} Donald [Trump]{.underline} or Vladimir Putin, or
powerful technology entrepreneurs like Elon Musk, [are]{.underline}
among those most [likely to be attracted to deploying this
climate-manipulating technology]{.underline}. Because of its
non-transformative qualities, [the speculative idea]{.underline} of
future solar geoengineering [is]{.underline} also [likely to continue to
be **appropriated by corporate and political actors who seek to delay
the phase-out of fossil fuels**]{.underline} \[4.20\]. [As a technology
developed within the climate isolationist mindset, solar geoengineering
reinforces climate injustices and slows down the
transformations]{.underline} that are [necessary to move humanity on a
path toward climate justice]{.underline} \[4.21\].

During the past decade, the United States has become the global leader
in solar geoengineering research, with multiple philanthropic efforts
funding research at major universities, with the largest solar
geoengineering research program at Harvard. The Harvard solar
geoengineering program is funded by philanthropic gifts from individuals
and foundations, including Bill Gates \[4.13\]. Solar geoengineering is
also fraught with ecological and governance risks and investing in this
approach is detracting from efforts for transformative social change
\[4.22\]. [The imagined potential of solar geoengineering has created a
new pathway for the rich and powerful to establish additional control
over everybody]{.underline} else [as climate impacts worsen]{.underline}
\[4.13\]. Advocacy for solar geoengineering research continues to be
dominated by white male scientists from the Global North funded by tech
billionaires and elite philanthropists \[4.23\]. More diverse voices are
needed to expand public discourse beyond the narrow technocratic
narrative that limits authentic deliberation about the risks of
advancing solar geoengineering \[4.9\].

Although [current efforts have]{.underline} primarily been [focused on
computer simulations, and]{.underline} in rare cases, [small-scale
experiments, once large-scale efforts are undertaken, there exists the
potential for **substantial unintended consequences**]{.underline},
either [due to **unidentified interactions, potential miscalc**ulations,
or **lagging responses**]{.underline}. Although a sense of urgency
exists among many with regard to the need for solutions to climate
change, [without proper due diligence]{.underline}, proposed [solutions
have the potential to **exacerbate current challenges** and **add
tension** between nation states and their citizens, who bear the
result]{.underline} of any experimentation. Under the concept of
consequentialism, although the aim for expediency may be well intended,
[failing to understand]{.underline} the [complex interactions leads to
the concern that poorly understood outcomes may lead to a **net negative
outcome**]{.underline}, worsening the situation for those affected.
Although the available number of real-world experiments in
geoengineering has been limited, the deployment of large renewable
energy systems is more prevalent and can act as an example of positive
intentions, resulting in potential net negative outcomes once studied.
Solar and wind technologies, for example, are often recognized as a way
to reduce carbon emissions and replace fossil fuel consumption through
renewable pathways, and those technologies have received widespread
support \[54\]; however, recent studies indicate that in large-scale
deployments, depending on placement, the near surface changes to albedo
and atmospheric conditions may produce net-warming \[55\], disruptions
of local climate patterns \[56\], reduction of wind speeds \[57\], and a
loss of precipitative transport inland \[58\]. By some indications, wind
farms may "need to operate for more than a century before the warming
effect over the Continental US caused by turbine-atmosphere interactions
would be smaller than the reduced warming effect from lowering
emissions" \[56\].

[In addition to failing to mitigate carbon production]{.underline},
these [studies highlight that mitigation efforts hold the potential to
alter agriculture, water availability, the frequency, intensity, and
duration of natural hazards, and a **range of other
issues**]{.underline} that have the ability to amplify climate
challenges and could increase the potential for conflict. [Concerns over
the]{.underline} understudied or [poorly understood consequences of
geoengineering have]{.underline} already [led to push back]{.underline}
from some Indigenous groups in the Arctic. In March of 2021, the Saami
Council, representing the Saami (Sámi) people, wrote an open letter to
the Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment (SCoPEx) Advisory
Committee, which is part of a project by Harvard University attempting
to test stratospheric aerosol injection technology in Sweden \[59\]. The
letter voiced several issues, [including the potential for **termination
shock**]{.underline}, "**[irreversible sociopolitical
effects]{.underline}**", [and concerns]{.underline} that [the team did
not]{.underline} "[have any representation]{.underline} from the
intended host country". Citing concerns from the Saami Council and
environmental groups, Sweden's space agency cancelled the flights that
would have been the first active test of aerosol injection technology
\[60\]. These challenges further highlight the need for an inclusive
risk governance approach, to ensure stakeholder concerns are a component
in the design and deployment of eventual intervention methods.
Additionally, such an approach would provide a mechanism to communicate
risk more effectively between groups.

[MCB]{.underline} also [triggers **unexpected climate responses** in
remote regions]{.underline} in 2010 and 2050. Under 2010 conditions,
[both]{.underline} strategies [induce substantial]{.underline}
reductions in heat stress over land and considerable [precipitation
responses, including a **decrease in precipitation** over the Sahel and
the Western United States]{.underline} (Fig. 3a,b and Extended Data Fig.
7a,b). However, under 2050 conditions, certain regions, including
[north-east Asia, Europe and central North America, experience
**exacerbated heat stress** and **hotter summers**]{.underline} with MCB
**[than would otherwise occur under global warming]{.underline}** (Fig.
3c and Extended Data Fig. 7c). [Europe suffers warmer summers under both
MCB strategies despite experiencing heat stress and air temperature
reductions]{.underline} similar to the Western United States in 2010
(Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 7a). These [large]{.underline} remote AP
[increases **do not occur under present-day conditions**]{.underline}
but develop under mid-century warming, indicating [MCB triggers a
**non-linear response** within the climate system]{.underline}. The
changes in the spatial pattern of responses under present-day and
mid-century conditions are consistent for both MCB regions (Extended
Data Figs. 1 and 6), suggesting the state dependence of regional MCB
efficacy is robust to the CESM low cloud biases.

Marine cloud brightening would cool the Earth by increasing the
reflectivity of low-hanging cloud over parts of the ocean. The basic
premise is that by introducing more particles into the clouds, there
would be more nuclei around which droplets could form. As a result,
clouds with the same water content could be made more reflective due to
a larger internal surface. [Most climatological research into MCB has
been model-based]{.underline}, using model projections to gauge its
potential effects. [There are **significant uncertainties** about the
potential effects of MCB, **including its cooling potential**. No
SRM]{.underline} technologies [could reverse climate
change]{.underline}. However, there are many open questions about the
efficacy, technical implementation, and risks of marine cloud
brightening. These include uncertainties about:

► How clouds and aerosols would interact: currently, [there is a
**limited understanding** of the interactions between aerosols and
clouds, how this may affect the cloud's lifespan and
precipitation]{.underline} (Stjern et al. 2017), [as well as what this
might mean for the cooling potential of MCB]{.underline}.

► How MCB might affect precipitation and other climate systems: like
SAI, [MCB presents a lot of uncertainties in]{.underline} terms of [how
it might interact with the climate system. MCB would be implemented
regionally]{.underline} -- while its effects aim to be global -- [but
the interaction between]{.underline} the [regional
implementation]{.underline} of MCB [and its global and ecological
effects]{.underline} (e.g Latham et al., 2013) [is]{.underline} still
**[poorly understood,]{.underline}** e.g. [both in terms of the
potential to affect crop growth]{.underline} (Parkes/Challinor/Nicklin
2015) [and tropical productivity]{.underline}
(Muri/Niemeier/Kristjánsson 2015).

► The inconsistency of model projections: The [**models disagree** both
with each other and with observational data about aerosol cloud
interactions, albedo enhancement, and regional/global
effects]{.underline} (National Research Council 2015, p. 118). Again,
[this raises **serious questions** about the reliability and validity of
model projections]{.underline}.

► Whether the predictive capacity of current model projections is
reliable: like in the case of SAI, [projections of the effectiveness of
MCB are based on model studies]{.underline}. Here too, [there remains a
**major uncertainty** how well climate models represent the potential
effects of MCB]{.underline}. Currently, [they are **certainly not yet
reliable enough to provide good estimates of efficacy and risks of
MCB**]{.underline} (Ahlm et al. 2017; National Research Council 2015) --
and **[it is uncertain whether they could be]{.underline}**.

► How MCB might be implemented and how it might affect local ecosystems:
Currently, the [technical capacities for the implementation of MCB are
**lacking**. It is also unclear how MCB would impact marine ecosystems.
Serious uncertainty remains on how to set up a research project and when
to stop it if it has unwanted effects]{.underline} (Diamond et al.
2022).

### Link\-\--Geoengineering\-\--SAI

#### Large-scale SAI rollout [exacerbates warming]{.underline}\-\--their studies are [overly optimistic]{.underline} and don't assume the CP [scaling]{.underline} it.

Could [SAI]{.underline} lead to directly3 catastrophic ecological
impacts? Existing [studies highlight a **raft of potential negative
consequences**]{.underline}. But the specific nature of these impacts,
and their contributions to catastrophic outcomes, depends on the
specific SAI implementation. This is an issue of high uncertainty,
particularly regionally.

The [projected local ecological effects of SAI are **mixed** and
**uncertain**]{.underline}, depending on the specific analytical
approach and specific SAI deployment. [Monsoon areas]{.underline} would
likely [face a drop in precipitation]{.underline} under large scale SRM
(Tilmes et al., 2013; Reynolds et al., 2016), but this focuses on SRM in
the abstract and may not be fully applicable to SAI. Many [regions could
face]{.underline} a seasonal [under- or over-compensation in
rainfall]{.underline} (compared to a high warming average (RCP8.5) from
2010 to 2030, and assuming SAI is implemented to mask 5 degrees of
warming) (Jiang et al., 2019). [Effects on hydrological systems would
be]{.underline} regionally diverse and [uncertain due to]{.underline}
potential [changes in non-linear variables including surface runoff,
evapotranspiration, rainfall levels, and distribution]{.underline}
(Dagon and Schrag, 2016, 2019). These [fine-grained changes in
weather]{.underline} could then [affect vegetation. Plant
communities]{.underline} could [transform]{.underline} their structure,
traits, and geographical range, particularly under larger swifter SAI
deployments (Zarnetske et al., 2021). While SAI might offer salvation to
climate vulnerable vegetation it will depend on deployment timing. Some
communities may already be committed to at least local extinctions
before SAI is deployed. [SAI would]{.underline} likely [result in
**ecological trade-offs** with some communities benefitting and others
suffering]{.underline}. The exact nature of these trade-offs is
uncertain and needs further study (Zarnetske et al., 2021). The key
theme here is that SAI would likely have a range of impacts on many
ecological systems. But how these would play out is highly uncertain,
particularly at regional scales. Impacts hinge on the inherent
uncertainties within complex ecological systems, varied comparative
baselines, and the specific SAI deployment.

The overall direct impacts of SAI, while uncertain, do not currently
seem to constitute a catastrophic threat. Whether SAI would cause
greater risks in terrestrial, freshwater, marine systems than climate
change is unclear and depends on SAI\'s specific deployment
configuration. [Higher levels and swifter deployment of SAI would mean
**greater potential for disastrous impacts**]{.underline} (Trisos et
al., 2018; Zarnetske et al., 2021). Additional considerations like
seasonal (Lee et al., 2021) or hemispheric (MacMartin et al., 2017)
deployment further affect potential impacts.

There is a paucity of research on SAI impacts (Irvine et al., 2016,
2017; MacMartin et al., 2016; McCormack et al., 2016; but see Schäfer et
al., 2015 for an exception), particularly so for catastrophic or
worst-case impacts. This has been the case for climate modeling
literature in the past as well (Brysse et al., 2013). Climate modeling
is often an exercise in "betting on the best case" (Geden, 2015; Jehn et
al., 2021). Others have noted [this **idealistic tendency** for SAI
modeling]{.underline} (Low and Honegger, 2020), for example limiting SAI
use to only halving warming (Irvine et al., 2019) or limiting SAI
deployment to spring (Lee et al., 2021). These idealized approaches [in
theory could reduce negative impacts]{.underline} associated with SAI.
[Yet their likelihood is **questionable** due to optimistic assumptions
of multi-decadal international **coop**eration]{.underline} (see
section: Politics).

The possibility of dangerous ecological tail-risks depends on the level
of cooling. Initial game theoretic research indicates the possibility of
overcooling if SAI is pursued by uncoordinated actors (Abatayo et al.,
2020). [Negative impacts]{.underline} which are [projected to be
relatively minor in existing studies]{.underline}, for example sulfate
deposition impacts on terrestrial ecosystems (Kravitz et al., 2009;
Visioni et al., 2020b), [may become **major ecological issues** if SAI
is deployed to **far more of an extent than envisioned**]{.underline}.
Similarly, a [poor choice]{.underline}4 [of aerosols could result in
**large-scale ozone depletion**]{.underline} (Heckendorn et al., 2009;
Keith et al., 2016). It is unclear whether, in these extreme cases,
biophysical impacts would revert to their pre-SAI state once SAI is
removed. Modeling on "worst" cases is thus critical in informing SAI\'s
desirability. Exploring uncoordinated scenarios with the (simultaneous)
use of different aerosols, different desired extents of cooling, and
implementation by a small club, would all be helpful complements to
existing idealized modeling scenarios.

Regardless of how developed our understanding on SAI impacts become,
there will always be inherent uncertainty. When dealing with a complex
system like the climate there is always the chance that a black swan is
lurking in the dark.

Some [commentators have downplayed the potential of unknown
impacts]{.underline} due to the availability of historical analogs,
namely historically severe volcanic eruptions (Halstead, 2018).
Improvements in modeling, a gradual implementation, and a cessation if
unacceptable negative impacts are found could also lessen the likelihood
of an unforeseen catastrophic tipping point.

None of these reasons are causes for comfort. [Modeling]{.underline},
regardless of improvements, [may simply be **incapable of capturing rare
tipping-points** and **is not intended to accurately** predict or
**foresee non-rational political dynamics**]{.underline} (Elsawah et
al., 2020). In addition, [a gradual rational phase-in and phase-out
relies on **optimal governance conditions**. **Overly rapid
deployment**]{.underline} due to "free-driving"5, (Weitzman, 2015) **[or
overly slow phase-out]{.underline}** due to technological or
infrastructural lock-in (Seto et al., 2016) **[are entirely
plausible]{.underline}**. Moreover, [SAI impacts may]{.underline} also
[not follow]{.underline} the pathway of [historical
analogs]{.underline}. The core rationale of SAI is to manufacture the
cooling effect of a volcanic eruption in a "safe" manner, not replicate
volcanic processes. Deviance from historical analogs is especially a
possibility if the choice or mix of aerosol is radically different. This
is particularly the case since climate change and human-pressures are
already pushing ecological systems into novel states (Williams and
Jackson, 2007; Williams et al., 2021). [SAI would push systems into
**further novel states that make unseen ecological responses
likely**]{.underline} (McKinnon, 2018).

Our [understanding of]{.underline} both [Earth systems and the likely
contours of deployment are **too weak for us to rule-out a potentially
catastrophic form of ecological blow-back**]{.underline}. For now, the
literature points to SAI having numerous impacts. But none seem remotely
capable of being a GCR, particularly if SAI deployment were limited.
Nonetheless, [the **Specter of an unforeseen tipping point in the
Earth\'s climatic system remains**]{.underline}.

#### It can't solve [ocean acidification]{.underline} or [sea level rise]{.underline}\-\--oceans are [slower to adapt]{.underline}.

[Climate change is heating the oceans]{.underline}, altering currents
and circulation patterns responsible for regulating climate on a global
scale. If temperatures dropped, some of that damage could theoretically
be undone. But [employing]{.underline} "[emergency]{.underline}"
[atmospheric geoengineering]{.underline} later this century [in the face
of continuous high carbon emissions **would** **not**]{.underline} be
able to **[reverse changes to ocean currents]{.underline}**, a new study
finds. [This would]{.underline} critically [curtail the
intervention's]{.underline} potential [effectiveness on human-relevant
timescales]{.underline}.

[Oceans]{.underline}, especially the deep oceans, [absorb and lose heat
more slowly than the atmosphere]{.underline}, so [an intervention that
cools the air **would not**]{.underline} be able to **[cool the deep
ocean on the same timescale]{.underline}**, the authors found.

Stratospheric aerosol injection is a commonly discussed geoengineering
concept based on the idea that adding particles to the stratosphere
could help cool the surface of the planet by reflecting sunlight back
into space. This could help stabilize the planet if warming exceeds the
1.5 degree Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cap set by the Paris Climate
Agreement, which the planet is on track to exceed under current emission
rates. (Global temperatures surpassed that threshold for several months
in 2023 due to a combination of factors in addition to climate change,
such as El Niño.)

But whether the injections would work is still heavily debated.

Previous research hints that a steady trickle of [aerosol injections
would]{.underline} help [cool the surface]{.underline} of the planet.
But the new study suggests that while an abrupt aerosol injection later
this century could provide some ocean cooling, [it **wouldn't be enough
to nudge**]{.underline} "**[stubborn]{.underline}**" **[ocean
patterns]{.underline}** such as Atlantic meridional overturning
circulation, which some research finds is already weakening.

In that case, [preexisting problems resulting from a warmed deep ocean,
such as **altered weather patterns**]{.underline}, regional [**sea level
rise and weakened currents**, would **remain**]{.underline} in place
**[even as the atmosphere and surface ocean cooled]{.underline}**.

"The big picture result is that we believe we can control the surface
temperature of the Earth, but other components of the climate system
will not be so fast to respond," said Daniel Pflüger, a physical
oceanographer at Utrecht University who led the study. "We need to bring
down emissions as fast as possible. We're only talking about
geoengineering because the political will for emission mitigation is
lacking."

The study was published in Geophysical Research Letters, AGU's journal
for high-impact, short-format reports with immediate implications
spanning all Earth and space sciences.

Indigenous peoples and communities with land-based livelihoods worldwide
are facing mounting pressure from the unprecedented scale and pace of
low-carbon energy transitions \[1--4\]. Mining and energy projects
require access to land that is central to Indigenous cultures and
livelihoods, with Indigenous peoples holding responsibilities as guard-
ians of ancestral lands and cultural heritage \[5,6\]. [While
industrial-scale mining and energy projects can offer remote communities
socio- economic and environmental benefits (better access to energy, in-
come, services, and education) \[e.g., \[7,8\]\], research highlights
**signif- icant negative impacts**, including loss and degradation of
ancestral lands and waters, conflicts and displacements]{.underline},
risks to health and life, impacts on culturally significant sites and
activities, and unfair benefit-sharing \[e.g., \[9,10,11\]\] Ongoing
energy transitions are deeply tied to colonial histories, when
hydroelectric dams and oil exploration were developed

in a way that disrupted Indigenous ways of life and marginalised
Indigenous leadership in resource governance[. **Many Indigenous com-
munities continue to be excluded from decision-making**, and are sub-
jected to violence, discrimination, criminalisation and
ignorance]{.underline} \[12,13\]. [Calls for justice emphasize the need
to rectify colonial legacies and **avoid perpetuating marginalization**
by recognising and respecting Indigenous sovereignty in infrastructure
planning and resource man- agement]{.underline} \[14,15\]. In
particular, there is a significant interest in decision- making which is
inclusive and respectful of cultures, rights, interests, knowledges, and
values of Indigenous peoples \[1,16--21\], which we refer to as
Indigenous-centred decision-making.

[Indigenous-centred decision-making is **increasingly recognised as a
critical component** of a just energy transition]{.underline}
\[15,21,22\]. Originating in the United States (US) [labour movement of
the 1980s, the concept of a "just transition" has broadened to encompass
the energy transition]{.underline}, and has been increasingly
instrumental in calls for theoretical pluralization that highlight
multiple understandings of "just transitions", including those of
Indigenous peoples \[23--25\]. [The global Indigenous peoples' movement
has outlined **multiple principles for a just transition**, ranging from
the **"Right to life"** to a "Rights-based approach to supply
chains"]{.underline} (see the summary document from the 2024 Indigenous
Summit on Just Transition \[15\]). Just transition for Indigenous
Peoples means "exer- cising our own customary institution and Indigenous
Peoples' gover- nance systems, based on our traditions and ways of life"
(p. 3). [In the context of the energy transition, this includes "**a
supply chain that re- spects Indigenous Peoples'** decision-making
authority and free, prior and informed consent (FPIC)]{.underline} at
all steps" (p. 7). This vision aligns with research on the topic that
[emphasises the centrality of procedural power and justice for
Indigenous knowledge \[]{.underline}22\]. There continues to be a strong
research need for a better understanding of concepts of justice and just
energy transitions grounded in perspectives of Indigenous and
land-connected people, with existing literature highlighting two broad
perspectives: one rooted in ontological and epistemological under-
standing of justice (centred on relationality among human, non-human,
physical and spiritual), and second focuses on a rights-based notion of
justice (recognition and implementation of Indigenous rights under
common law and moral frameworks) \[26,27\]. This paper primarily en-
gages with the latter approach, while drawing connections to the former.

**[The significance of Indigenous-centred decision-making has grown in
importance in light of the rush to develop low-carbon
projects]{.underline}** driven by climate urgency, geopolitical
instability, and energy security con- cerns. [This haste has created an
urge to expedite decision-making pro- cesses, sometimes weakening
safeguards for affected people and the environment]{.underline}
\[28,29\]. As the global Indigenous peoples' movement put it, "[we will
continue to engage/challenge local, national, state, provin- cial,
federal and international regulations, standards, laws, policies and
actions that streamline 'green/clean' energy projects that ignore our
free, prior and informed consent and socio-cultural and environmental
review processes in order to 'fast track' such projects in the name of
public or national interest"]{.underline}

Since Donald Trump regained the presidency, he has coveted Greenland.
Trump has insisted that the U.S. will control the island, currently an
autonomous territory of Denmark, and if his overtures are rejected,
perhaps seize Greenland by force.

During a recent congressional hearing, [senators and expert witnesses

resources: critical minerals, fossil fuels and hydropower. [**No one
mentioned the hazards**, many]{.underline} of them **[exacerbated by
human-induced climate change]{.underline}**, that those longing to
possess and develop the island will inevitably encounter.

That's imprudent, because [the Arctic's climate is changing]{.underline}
more [rapidly]{.underline} than anywhere on Earth. [Such rapid
warming]{.underline} further [increases the]{.underline} already

and its ice sheet, including natural hazards and climate change. That
knowledge is essential for understanding the risks that military and
extractive efforts face on Greenland today and in the future.

Greenland is unlike where most people live. The climate is frigid. For
much of the year, sea ice clings to the coast, making it inaccessible.

An ice sheet, up to 2 miles thick, covers more than 80% of the island.
The population, about 56,000 people, lives along the island's steep,
rocky coastline.

While researching my book "When the Ice is Gone," I discovered how
[Greenland's harsh climate and vast wilderness stymied past colonial
endeavors]{.underline}. During World War II, dozens of U.S. military
pilots, disoriented by thick fog and running out of fuel, crashed onto
the ice sheet. An iceberg from Greenland sunk the Titanic in 1912, and
46 years later, another sunk a Danish vessel specifically designed to
fend off ice, killing all 95 aboard.

Now [amplified by climate change, natural hazards make resource
extraction and military endeavors]{.underline} in Greenland
[**uncertain, expensive and** potentially **deadly**]{.underline}.

Rock on the move

[Greenland's coastal landscape is prone to rockslides]{.underline}. The
hazard arises [because the coast is where people live and where rock
isn't hidden under the ice sheet]{.underline}. In some places, [that
rock contains critical minerals]{.underline}, such as gold, as well as
other rare metals used for technology, including for circuit boards and
electrical vehicle batteries.

The unstable slopes reflect how the ice sheet eroded the deep fjords
when it was larger. [Now that the ice has melted, nothing
buttresses]{.underline} the near-vertical [valley walls, and so, **they
collapse**]{.underline}.

In 2017, a northwestern Greenland mountainside fell 3,000 feet into the
deep waters of the fjord below. Moments later, the wave that rockfall
generated (a tsunami) washed over the nearby villages of Nuugaatsiaq and
Illorsuit. The water, laden with icebergs and sea ice, ripped homes from
their foundations as people and sled dogs ran for their lives. By the
time it was over, four people were dead and both villages lay in ruin.

Steep fjord walls around the island are littered with the scars of past
rockslides. The evidence shows that at one point in the last 10,000
years, one of those slides dropped rock sufficient to fill 3.2 million
Olympic swimming pools into the water below. In 2023, another rockslide
triggered a tsunami that sloshed back and forth for nine days in a
Greenland fjord.

[There's no network of paved roads across Greenland. The only feasible
way to move heavy equipment, minerals and fossil fuels would be **by
sea**. Docks, mines and buildings within tens of feet of sea level would
be **vulnerable to rockslide-induced tsunamis**]{.underline}.

Melting ice will be deadly and expensive

**[Human-induced global warming]{.underline}**, driven by fossil fuel
combustion, [**speeds the melting of Greenland's ice**. That melting is
threatening]{.underline} the island's [infrastructure]{.underline} and
the lifestyles of native people, who over millennia have adapted their
transportation and food systems to the presence of snow and ice. [Record
floods]{.underline}, fed by warmth-induced melting of the ice sheet,
[have]{.underline} recently [swept away bridges]{.underline} that stood
for half a century.

As the climate warms, [permafrost]{.underline} -- frozen rock and soil
-- which underlies the island, [thaws]{.underline}. [This destabilizes
the landscape, **weakening steep slopes** and **damaging** critical
**infrastructure**]{.underline}.

[Permafrost melt is]{.underline} already [threatening the U.S. military
base on Greenland]{.underline}. As the ice melts and the ground settles
under runways, [cracks and craters form]{.underline} -- a hazard for
airplanes. [Buildings tilt as their foundations settle into the
softening soil]{.underline}, including critical radar installations that
have scanned the skies for missiles and bombers since the 1950s.

Greenland's icebergs can threaten oil rigs. As the warming climate
speeds the flow of Greenland's glaciers, they calve more icebergs in the
ocean. The problem is worse close to Greenland, but some icebergs drift
toward Canada, endangering oil rigs there. Ships stand guard, ready to
tow threatening icebergs away.

Greenland's government banned drilling for fossil fuels in 2021 out of
concern for the environment. Yet, Trump and his allies remain eager to
see exploration resume off the island, despite exceptionally high costs,
less than stellar results from initial drilling, and the ever-present
risk of icebergs.

[As Greenland's ice melts and water flows into the ocean, sea level
changes]{.underline}, but in ways that might not be intuitive. Away from
the island, sea level is rising about an inch each six years. But close
to the ice sheet, it's the land that's rising. Gradually [freed of the
weight of its ice, **the rock beneath Greenland**, long depressed by the
massive ice sheet, **rebounds**]{.underline}. That rise is rapid -- more
than 6 feet per century. Soon, many [harbors in Greenland may **become
too shallow for ship traffic**]{.underline}.

Greenland's challenging past and future

History clearly shows that many [past]{.underline} military and colonial
[endeavors failed in Greenland because they showed **little
consideration** of the island's harsh climate and dynamic ice
sheet]{.underline}.

Changing climate drove Norse settlers out of Greenland 700 years ago.
Explorers trying to cross the ice sheet lost their lives to the cold.
American bases built inside the ice sheet, such as Camp Century, were
quickly crushed as the encasing snow deformed.

In the past, the [American focus in Greenland was on short-term
gains]{.underline} with little regard for the future. Abandoned U.S.
military bases from World War II, scattered around the island and in
need of cleanup, are one example. Forced relocation of Greenlandic Inuit
communities during the Cold War is another. I believe that Trump's
[demands]{.underline} today [for]{.underline} American [control of the
island to exploit its resources are]{.underline} similarly
[shortsighted]{.underline}.

However, when it comes to the planet's livability, I've argued that [the
greatest]{.underline} strategic and economic [value of
Greenland]{.underline} to the world [is]{.underline} not its location or
its natural resources, but **[its ice]{.underline}**. That [white snow
and ice reflect sunlight, **keeping Earth cool**]{.underline}. And [the
ice sheet, perched on land, **keeps water out of the ocean**. As it
melts, Greenland's ice sheet will **raise global sea level, up to about
23 feet**]{.underline} when all the ice is gone.

[Climate-driven sea level rise is already flooding coastal
regions]{.underline} around the [world, including major economic
centers]{.underline}. As that continues, estimates suggest that [the
damage will total trillions of dollars. **Unless Greenland's ice remains
frozen, coastal inundation will force the largest migration that
humanity has ever witnessed**. Such changes]{.underline} are predicted
to [**destabilize the global** economic and strategic **world
order.**]{.underline}

These examples show that [disregarding the risks of natural hazards and
climate change in Greenland **courts disaster**]{.underline}, both
locally and **[globally]{.underline}**.

#### Other places are [much better]{.underline}.

Javier **Blas 25**, Opinion Columnist at Bloomberg, "Trump's Folly?
Greenland for Critical Minerals Is Utter Nonsense," Bloomberg,
01-15-2025, accessed 04-07-2025,

DG

Every few years, a craze engulfs the commodity industry: [A new and
exotic source of mineral supply is about to emerge, solving all the
world's shortages]{.underline}. The list stretches the imagination from
the ocean abysses (deep sea mining) to the vastness of space (asteroid
mining).

The buzz today is more mundane: Greenland --- cold, vast and, so we're
told, endowed with every mineral the world needs. So large are its
riches that US President-elect Donald Trump wants it. Trouble is, the
theory is utter nonsense.

As with every tall tale, the story starts from a grain of truth. The
island of about 60,000 people, a self-ruling territory of Denmark, has
some mineral deposits, some of which are even large. That's
unsurprising. Geologically, the island is an extension of the North
American continent, and we know that the US and Canada do enjoy a
significant mineral endowment.

But cynical observers should be forgiven a case of déjà vu: The
[hyperbole around Greenland and commodities has a **50-year long
history**]{.underline}. Back in the 1970s, the interest was about oil.
The craze resurfaced in the early 2000s after oil and iron ore prices
surged. Suffice to say the island doesn't pump a barrel of oil and the
miner that planned to develop an iron ore deposit went into bankruptcy.

Now it's an eagerness to tap "a lot of great natural resources" --- in
the words of Vice President-elect JD Vance. But here, it really depends
on your definition of "a lot" --- certainly, using my definition, it
doesn't qualify. It's not even close.

[A 2023]{.underline} Danish geological [survey identified]{.underline}
at least [50 locations with mineral potential]{.underline}. Of them,
[more than half are north of the Arctic Circle, making their
exploitation **very hard and expensive, if not impossible**. A
handful]{.underline}, however, are [in the ice-free southern tip of
Greenland]{.underline}, opening the door to development. But most of
them [are small]{.underline}. Of the potentially large, perhaps the most
interesting one is the Tanbreez rare earths deposit.

Yet the geological report warns that [Greenland has **very little chance
of developing its commodity deposits** due to high production
costs]{.underline}. "Greenlandic deposits could become more economically
viable in the future," it says, only if prices were to rise
significantly.

Here is where the sales pitch is required. Of course, prices will rise,
the bulls say; haven't you seen that China controls 90% of the world's
rare earth metals, and Beijing could close the tap any day, they add.
Yes, I have; I even saw the price of dysprosium, one of the rare earth
compounds often quoted as very rare and very important, go parabolic in
2011, during the last rare earth mania. In a few weeks, it went up 800%,
only to crash nearly as quickly.

[Rare earths are a]{.underline} bit of a **[misnomer]{.underline}** ---
**[they are quite abundant]{.underline}**. The problem is that rarely
are they abundant in a concentration worth mining for. [Even
when]{.underline} the [concentration is high, extracting]{.underline}
the elements [from]{.underline} the [ore is expensive and very
polluting]{.underline}. Hence why [China]{.underline} controls the
market. Not only does the Asian giant have more reserves than anyone
else, it also [doesn't mind the environmental cost]{.underline} of the
rare earths refineries.

Are the Greenlandic reserves of rare earths large? Not as far as we
know. According to the US Geological Survey, considered an authority in
the field, [the island contains 1.5 million tons. That puts
Greenland]{.underline} in the world's top 10, but well [**behind the
US** itself, as well as **China, Brazil, Vietnam, India and Australia**.
Very likely, mining for rare earths in **all of those**]{.underline}
countries **[would be easier and cheaper]{.underline}** than in
Greenland.

What about the geopolitical considerations? Let me put it this way: Rare
earths aren't oil. Or copper; or uranium; or natural gas. In 2023, the
total value of the rare earth compounds and metals the US imported was
\$190 million. The price of rare earth can surge by 50 times and not be
more than a blip for the US economy. And at those prices, American
companies would find many projects at home before Greenland.

True, if the cost of rare earths like dysprosium was to surge once again
--- and crucially, stay higher for a long period --- perhaps some of the
Greenlandic projects would make sense. But [one has to assume the most
bullish price forecasts]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline}
simultaneously, [that climate change will render mining in Greenland **a
lot easier**]{.underline} than today, **[and that every other
nation]{.underline}** with rare earths reserves **[wouldn't rush to
develop their own, crashing the market]{.underline}**.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results --- but investors
should beware of the siren song of the rare earth sector. Look at the
VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals exchange traded fund. It's down
nearly 80% since its launch in 2010.

If Greenlandic rare earths aren't worth the time and money, perhaps
other commodities? I don't think so. Not at current prices, anyhow. Take
cobalt, key for the batteries used by Tesla Inc. and other electric -car
companies. It's hovering close to a 20-year low thanks to Chinese
miners, deterring investment everywhere. The same goes for nickel,
facing a glut thanks to booming Indonesian output; likewise, iron ore.
Perhaps copper has a future, but if prices climb, many other locations
would be far more profitable -- and offer far more production potential
--- than Greenland, which has very limited reserves of the reddish
mineral. The same applies to more exotic minerals like titanium,
tungsten and vanadium. [For all, the potential reserves are equally
abundant elsewhere, and at a lower production cost]{.underline}.

[If the US is serious about mineral supply, **it has better places to
flex its diplomatic muscle**]{.underline}. The Democratic Republic of
[Congo]{.underline} is, by far, the most important one --- home of huge
proved reserves of copper and cobalt, two minerals far more important
than rare earth elements. So are [Chile, Peru, Brazil and Mongolia.
Kazakhstan]{.underline} goes into the list too. Sadly, none of them is
for sale. But neither is Greenland.

#### Extraction would take [forever]{.underline}, and unforeseen hurdles block effectiveness.

[Greenland's mineral resources are]{.underline} becoming [more
accessible]{.underline} as climate change causes its vast ice cap to
recede --- **[but actual projects are scant]{.underline}**.

[The furthest developed mine]{.underline} near the southern tip of the
country, Kuannersuit or Kvaneflejd, [was]{.underline} effectively
[blocked from exploitation because its deposits]{.underline} of rare
earths [are mixed with uranium]{.underline}. The company holding the
exploitation license has sued Greenland\'s government for \$11 billion.

[Other deposits are much **smaller** and **harder to
access**]{.underline}, meaning their [exploitation would require
**vast**]{.underline} sums of **[investment and a lot of
time]{.underline}** to develop.

#### By the time we get there, the environment will be destroyed.

DG

[While critical minerals are likely in Greenland, it is **unclear if
mining is economically viable**]{.underline}. That\'s where exploration
comes in. \"Mineral exploration is amongst the most challenging and
risky of enterprises related to mining,\" says Simon Jowitt, director of
the Ralph J. Roberts Center for Research and Economic Geology at the
University of Nevada, Reno. He notes that for every 100 mineral
exploration projects, one of them might turn into a mine.

[If]{.underline} the [exploration efforts reveal a mine\'s
potential]{.underline}, on average, [it can still take]{.underline}
about **[10 years to go from discovery to production]{.underline}**,
Jowitt says. \"It all depends on where you are, what the infrastructure
is, what permitting and other things you have to do to make sure that
you\'re going to be mining in a conscientious way.\"

[Greenland has a notable **lack of infrastructure**]{.underline} --
[once out of the cities, there are **no roads or
railroads**]{.underline} through the countryside. \"Getting around
isn\'t easy\-- you can\'t drive a four-by-four over the terrain in
Greenland," says Jowitt. Travel is done by boat or air, not car. The
[lack of established infrastructure]{.underline}, notes Jowitt, [could
prove a challenge for mining operations]{.underline}.

[Processing minerals can]{.underline} also [be a fraught
endeavour]{.underline}. Unlike a mineral such as gold, which is found in
its native state within a rock, [rare earth elements are locked within
another complicated mineral]{.underline}, explains Goodenough. \"Those
[deposits are very, **very difficult to process**, and]{.underline}
sometimes [intimately connected with uranium or with other
elements]{.underline} that [you might not want to be
mining]{.underline}.\"

Indeed, [if a mineral is locked in tandem with radioactive minerals, the
mine could stop **before a single gram is processed**]{.underline}. In
2021, [Greenland passed a law limiting the amount of uranium in mined
resources]{.underline}, and action which froze the development of a rare
earth element mine in Southern Greenland.

The [current parliament reflects Greenlanders\' concerns over mining\'s
long-lasting impacts]{.underline}. Three [legacy mines on Greenland
caused **marked environmental damage**]{.underline}, especially to the
water around the island. Merrild explains that in mining, trash rock
from the process is put into two categories: waste rock and tailings.
\"The tailings are the most polluted leftovers, whereas waste rock is
considered less damaging,\" she says. Because of this view, [waste rock
was dumped along rivers and coastlines]{.underline}.

But the waste rock was not inert.

\"[The level of heavy metals has been **very high**]{.underline} in some
of the waste rock,\" Merrild says. Scientists found elevated levels of
the metals in everything from spiders to lichen, fish and bivalves near
the mines.

The [cold temperatures and low salinity]{.underline} around Greenland
[made environmental recovery **painfully slow**]{.underline}, and
effects can still be detected 50 years later, says Merrild. \"Damaging
the water is really damaging the whole food supply of Greenlanders and
their opportunity to have a livelihood based on fisheries and hunting.\"

Climate change is drastically affecting the Arctic, with temperatures
rising nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet. New
estimates show the Greenland ice sheet is losing 30 million tonnes of
ice an hour. [While the retreat of the inland ice will reveal more
buried rock]{.underline}, Merrild notes that [the melting is not a
driving factor for the increased interest in exploration]{.underline}.
After all, **[glacier melting takes a long time]{.underline}**.

[While the presence of critical minerals in Greenland is proven, **the
value of these is**]{.underline}, perhaps strangely,
**[contested]{.underline}**.

Ten years ago, a research report, For the Benefit of Greenland, was
conducted by [a team of geologists]{.underline}. It [warned of
**unrealistic expectations** around]{.underline} the island's [mineral
potential given **uncertainties around market prices** and **global
demand**]{.underline}.

"[Even if estimates]{.underline} of the quantity and quality of ore in a
geological deposit [are well documented]{.underline}," it reads, "[it is
**difficult to translate this into economic potential**]{.underline} and
even more difficult to predict a specific revenue for Greenlandic
society."

One of its authors, Greenlander and geology professor Minik Thorleif
Rosing, tells Mining Technology that the situation is relatively
unchanged since the report's publication.

"[There is a misconception]{.underline} that [Greenland will be like a
new Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, only at the size of a small British
town," he says.

"The reality is that [while mineral resources could be a part of
Greenland's economy, it is **unlikely to be a major part**]{.underline}.
Even if you had an unrealistically high rate of development of mineral
resources, it would be unlikely to replace more than half the annual
block grant from Denmark in any near future."

He is referring to the annual grant given to Greenland from Denmark,
consisting of DKr3.9bn (roughly \$540m), which accounts for
approximately 20% of Greenland's gross domestic product.

Greenland's uncertain mineral future is not, Rosing says, due to a lack
of resources but more a reflection of wider markets.

"It is not because Greenland doesn't have a lot of minerals, but
**[minerals are not the same as wealth]{.underline}**," he said.

"For one thing, [the value]{.underline} of a deposit [is a sociological
rather than geological feature]{.underline} -- [it all depends on the
market]{.underline}. And right [now, there is **no stable market for
rare earths**]{.underline}. If this changes, then there is definitely a
chance for rare earth metals to be developed, but it hinges on this
condition.

"This is not to talk down the potential of Greenland but just to caution
on the extreme end of the dreams about what Greenland could do," he
continues.

Similarly, Torben Andersen, an economics professor at Aarhus University,
suggests that [reaping the potential benefits of mining in Greenland
will require government action and industry development]{.underline}.

"The new geopolitical situation and the focus on control over supply
chains may change this, but [it would take **years** before this
develops into a significant part of the economy]{.underline}," he
explains.

"The impact of developing mining all depends on the government's
actions, and the scope for using such activities to improve job
prospects for the local population, involvement of local small
businesses, etc.

"There is a large potential \[in Greenland\], but it would take time to
develop it."

#### Icebreakers cause sea level rise and extreme weather.

Advancement of the Steady State Economy, "Icebreakers in the Arctic: An
Overlooked Environmental Concern," Steady State Herald, 04-14-2022,

https://steadystate.org/icebreakers-in-the-arctic-an-overlooked-environmental-concern,
DG

[Little **info**rmation is available about the environmental concerns
that icebreakers pose]{.underline}. Literature highlights the perceived
"positives"---scientific exploration, search and rescue, trade and
shipping, and competition amongst nations---as being more important than
considering environmental degradation. However, here's what we know.

Icebreakers break ice. [As the broken ice melts, sunlight is absorbed,
leading to **increased temperatures**, and]{.underline} thus [more ice
melting]{.underline}. An icebreaker cruising through the ice for 1,000
kilometers (620 miles), leaving an ice-free wake of ten meters (33
feet), would open an area of water ten square kilometers (3.9 square
miles) over the entire cruise. Although the Arctic Sea covers about
4,000 kilometers (2500 miles), [**any amount of ice breaking harms the
environment**. With the continual use of icebreaker ships, the Arctic
will]{.underline} continue to [look more like ice cubes melting in a
glass of water]{.underline}.

As melting endures, we will continue to see environmental effects around
the world. [Changes in the Arctic]{.underline} Sea [ice pattern leads to
a **rise in sea levels globally**. Low-lying developed areas in the Gulf
Coast and the mid-Atlantic regions are especially at risk]{.underline}
from sea-level rise. The recent growth of coastal areas has resulted in
larger populations and more valuable coastal property being at risk from
sea-level rise. [Major physical impacts of a rise in sea level include
erosion of beaches, inundation of deltas as well as flooding and loss
of]{.underline} many [marshes and wetlands. Increased salinity
will]{.underline} likely [become a problem in coastal aquifers and
estuarine systems]{.underline} because of saltwater intrusion.

[Changes in Arctic ice patterns are]{.underline} also [leading to more
frequent **extreme weather**]{.underline}. In the past few years, such
extreme weather has been seen particularly across the east coast of the
USA, western Europe, and central Asia. These regions will continue to
experience more extreme weather [because of Arctic amplification, the
enhanced sensitivity of high latitudes to global heating. Arctic ice
melt has]{.underline} also [been shown to distort the flow of and weaken
the jet stream, resulting in more frequent]{.underline} periods of
**[intense heat and ferocious cold]{.underline}**.

[There's]{.underline} also [evidence]{.underline} that [the sound
emitted from icebreakers is **detrimental to marine animals**,
particularly **whales and other large mammals**]{.underline}. The [sound
interferes with their ability to communicate with their
pods]{.underline}. Additionally, [sound pollution likely has **long-term
effects that are difficult to predict**]{.underline}.

Most of the Russian icebreaker fleet is nuclear-based due to the fuel
costs of running an icebreaker. On average, an icebreaker working in
regions with three-meter-thick ice uses more than 100 tons of fuel per
day. However, nuclear icebreakers have obvious concerns as well. In
fact, should an accident occur, the consequence would be as severe as
the Chernobyl disaster and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill combined:
devastating.

The objective of this report is to identify [the changes that have
occurred in the system of nuclear waste management in the Arctic

importance of the Arctic in the modern era. The economic, climatic,
environmental and safety aspects of the Arctic are attracting increased
attention from a variety of stakeholders. [In considering the issues of
radioactive waste management in Russia, it is essential to recon with
the multicomponent nature of the nuclear power complex and the presence
of a considerable number of nuclear legacy sites]{.underline}. The
Russian nuclear industry, comprising both civilian and [military
operations, has amassed a considerable quantity of nuclear waste. A
**considerable proportion** of this **waste has accumulated** in the
Russian Arctic region, including on the seabed of the Arctic Ocean and
its associated seas]{.underline}. Following the dissolution of the USSR,
the Russian government has been engaged in the construction of a system
for the management and ultimate elimination of radioactive waste and
other issues related to the so-called 'nuclear legacy' for an extended
period of time. International cooperation played a pivotal role in the
development of this system. Foreign states provided substantial
financial and technological assistance within the framework of various
international structures. However[, following the outbreak of the war in
Ukraine, these ties were abruptly severed. Russia is now prioritizing
economic projects for the utilization of nuclear energy in the Arctic,
while **environmental considerations** have been **largely overlooked**.

[This enormous monstrosity is the world's first purpose-built floating
nuclear power plant. It's now bound for the Arctic.]{.underline}

No, we're not joking. No, this isn't science fiction. This is really
happening.

R[osatom, the Russian state-controlled nuclear giant, is launching the
"Akademik Lomonosov", the first of its kind, into the
world.]{.underline} It's currently being towed through the Baltic sea,
where it will go all around Scandinavia to Murmansk, to be fuelled and
tested[, before it heads off on a 5,000 km journey through the Arctic.
They plan on building and selling more plants like these to other
countries, like China, Indonesia, and Sudan.]{.underline}

[We already know the risks of drilling for oil in such a wild and
fragile region, but a floating nuclear reactor could be even worse.
Here's why:]{.underline}

[1. It's a catastrophe waiting to happen]{.underline}

[Nuclear reactors bobbing around the Arctic Ocean pose a shockingly
obvious threat to this wild and fragile environment]{.underline}.

[Rosatom has said that the plant "is designed with the \[sic\] great
margin of safety that exceeds all possible threats and makes nuclear
reactors invincible for tsunamis and other natural
disasters]{.underline}." Remember the last time a ship was called
'unsinkable'?

Nothing is invincible. The problem is that this nuclear titanic has been
constructed without any independent experts checking it. In Chornobyl,
there was a similar lack of oversight.

This plant's flat-bottomed hull makes it particularly vulnerable to
tsunamis and cyclones. A large wave can pitch the power station onto the
coast. It also can't move by itself. If it comes loose from its
moorings, it can't move away from a threat (an iceberg or a foreign
vessel, for example) increasing the risk of a deadly incident. [A
collision could damage its vital functions and lead to a loss of power
and damage its cooling function, and that could lead to a release of
radioactive substances into the environment]{.underline}.

2\. Imagine how hard it will be to deal with the consequences

[There are so many things that could go wrong here: it could flood, or
sink, or run aground. All of these scenarios could potentially lead to
radioactive substances being leaked into the environment.]{.underline}

In the case of a collapse, the core will be cooled by the surrounding
seawater. While this seems like a good idea, [when melting fuel rods
come into with seawater, it will first lead to a seawater explosion and
potential hydrogen explosions that will spread a large amount of
radioactive isotopes into the atmosphere.]{.underline}

[A damaged reactor could contaminate much of the marine wildlife in the
near vicinity. That means that fish stocks could be contaminated for
years to come. A radioactive Arctic is not a pretty
scenario]{.underline}. The areas around Fukushima and Chornobyl are
already difficult to clean up; imagine the polar night, deep sub-zero
temperatures and Arctic storms.

3\. The terrible track record of nuclear ships, icebreakers and
submarines

There is very very long list of incidents and accidents with existing
nuclear submarines and icebreakers.

The very first nuclear icebreaker, Lenin, had a cooling accident in
1965, resulting in a partial meltdown of the core. The damaged
radioactive core was dumped in the Tsivolki Bay near the Novaya Zemlya
archipelago in 1967. In 1970 the reactor of a nuclear submarine (K-320)
started up by itself at Krasnoye Sormovo wharf in Russia, releasing
large amounts of radiation and causing hundreds of people to be exposed.
An accident during fuel loading of the reactor of a nuclear submarine in
Chazma in 1985 irradiated 290 workers leading to 10 casualties and 49
people injured. The list goes on...

Rosatom's plans to build a fleet of floating nuclear power stations
means an unprecedented increase of the risk of nuclear incidents and
accidents in the Arctic.

4\. A nuclear dumping ground on water

We already have more nuclear waste than we know what to do with. We
don't need any more.

[The reactors on this plant are smaller than conventional land based
nuclear plants and will need refuelling every two to three years. The
nuclear waste will be stored onboard until it returns after 12
designated years of operation. That means that radioactive waste will be
left floating around in the Arctic for years at a time.]{.underline}

Not only is this incredibly risky, there is still nowhere secure for the
spent fuel to be transported to once it's on land. No power source
should create waste that takes milennia to be safe.

Since the development and remediation of the KIC-1 oil well, oil and gas
exploration and withdrawal in the Alaskan North Slope are ongoing6,7. To
date, almost 8,094 km2 of Alaska are leased to the oil and gas industry
for active withdrawal, in addition to the National Petroleum Reserve,
which covers an additional 93,078 km2 of permafrost tundra above the
Arctic Circle2,8. Located inside the Arctic circle, Prudhoe Bay Oil
Field in the North Slope is the United States' largest oil field,
covering an area of 864.2 km2 of permafrost tundra1. It was established
in 1968, began production in 1977, and currently produces over 19,013
barrels of crude oil per day (\~ 1.590 × 107 t/a)1. According to
estimates from the oil industry, subsurface expansion from active oil
and gas withdrawal could cover between 2 and 130.2 km2 per pad,
resulting in substantial below-ground permafrost disturbance8.

[Studies of the direct impacts on the permafrost landscape from oil pads
have discovered that infrastructure development leads to **changes to**
the movement of **wildlife9**]{.underline},10, increased permafrost thaw
rates and water pooling6,11,12, and pollution from anthropogenic refuse
or aerosols13--16. [Secondary impacts may include increased water flow
and thermal impacts that create a marsh-like surface
cover6]{.underline},17--19, [and the **release of organic carbon,
microbes, and greenhouse gases20**]{.underline}--23. [Localized thaw can
also introduce **risks to critical infrastructure**, including roads and
airports1]{.underline}5,24,25. While these studies have sought to
understand the long-term ecosystem impacts to the permafrost from oil
drilling6,13,14,26--30, our effort to compare the residual impacts from
a remediated legacy pad to the direct impacts of current infrastructure
is a new application of cross-scale observational techniques.

While many of the direct, short-term impacts from oil well pads on the
permafrost are known1,6,7,12,31, the effort to couple these data with a
characterization of long-term impacts from a remediated pad has not been
completed. To further inform modeling and remote sensing efforts and
understand the impacts occurring within a 100 m radius immediately
surrounding oil well pads, we sampled four gravel pads along the Dalton
Highway near Prudhoe Bay used for industrial purposes other than oil
extraction (Fig. 1). Access to active oil wells and their surrounding
pads is prohibited for security reasons. The 'proxy' pads are
constructed in the same manner as the larger oil well pads and with
similar, if not identical fill materials6,8,25. Then, to compare the
direct impacts of pad development and the long-term impacts of
remediated oil well pads, we utilized airborne imaging spectroscopy
(hyperspectral imaging) to characterize ongoing permafrost effects from
the remediated KIC-1 pad. This presents a novel opportunity to compare
longer-term infrastructure effects with short-term, direct impacts from
active pads, covering timescales ranging from daily to decadal. Our
comparison of both active and legacy oil well pads create a timeline
from active pad use to post-remediation, outlining the primary and
secondary effects of oil and gas infrastructure on the permafrost
tundra.

Results

Direct measurements of pad impacts on the tundra

To understand the ongoing impact from gravel pads on the permafrost
tundra of the Alaskan North Slope, samples were taken during July of
2023 over a series of days at both 5 cm and 15 cm depth in an area
surrounding four industrial use gravel pads, to augment previous
measurements6,12,30,30,31. [Numerous physical relationships between the
pads and the surrounding permafrost environment were identified as
**significant**]{.underline} after Pearson Correlation Coefficient
testing and corresponding significance testing. Further details are
provided in the methods and supplementary sections.

[Industrial and oil well pads on the permafrost tundra in Alaska are
constructed from non-local gravel, introducing a novel substrate to the
ecosystem6,7,32. This frequently used, cost-efficient strategy has a
secondary consequence of **amplifying warming**]{.underline}, drying the
local permafrost environment and driving pH changes6,12,33. For example,
in our case study the elevated soil temperature and pH values decreased
with distance from the pad, finally returning to background levels at
approximately 60 m from the pads (Fig. 2, S1a,b).

The largest statistically significant correlations between physical
relationships between the pad and the surrounding permafrost environment
were found between soil moisture and soil temperature (0.266) and soil
temperature and distance from pad (-0.481). This suggests that the
[addition of a pad changes the heat profile and **increases the
temperature** of the surrounding environment]{.underline} and
corroborates what is known from the literature (Fig. 2)6,30. Soil
moisture and distance from pad (0.258) was also correlated, but was a
less linear relationship due to the highly variable terrain, bordering
on herbaceous wetland, and a proliferation of thermokarst lakes

We also found anticorrelated relationships between soil moisture and
depth (-0.588), and soil temperature and depth (-0.692), the latter
indicating the greatest statistical relationship and largest magnitude
of negative correlation \[= -0.6919, p-value 2.20327657E-36\]. This is
expected as the deeper measurements at 15 cm were often below the active
layer, at the permafrost interface.

The r[elationship between soil pH and moisture (-0.662) is a known
physical relationship11,33, and demonstrated the **largest negative
ranking** by magnitude according to the Spearman rank
coefficient]{.underline} \[= -0.7490, p-value 2.83555057E-03\]. Soil pH
and distance from pad (-0.400), soil pH and temperature (0.163), and
soil pH and depth of soil profile measurement (0.142) were all
correlated, illustrating known relationships11,19,33,34, and another
example of the potential impacts from the pad substrate6,12,31. While
these measurements are a small subsample during an abbreviated period,
[they are in alignment with the body of literature6,7,10,12 and
emphasize that gravel pads directly impact permafrost state and
condition.]{.underline}

Remote sensing analysis of pad remediation

While the ongoing impacts from gravel pads on the tundra provide
critical data, the legacy of KIC-1, the only remediated oil well pad in
the North Slope of Alaska, provides critical information about the
long-term effects of gravel pads on the tundra. [The footprint of the
KIC-1 well pad is **clearly visible** in August 2022 true color
AVIRIS-NG imagery (Fig. 3a, top left) despite being 40 years post
remediation]{.underline}. Photogrammetry of the area makes visible
extensive permafrost loss and subsidence at and surrounding the oil well
pad10. Airborne imaging spectroscopy from NASA's Airborne Visible /
Infrared Imaging Spectrometer---Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG)35 shows
vegetation changes and expanded polygonal hydrology from thawing
permafrost. SWIR/NIR/Green (2250 nm, 850 nm, 550 nm) false color
composite (Fig. 3a, top center) clearly captures variability in the
KIC-1 pad site and non-photosynthetic vegetation in the surrounding
tundra (magenta and red).

A linear spectral mixture model (Fig. 3a, top right; endmembers shown in
bottom right) quantifies this variability. The maximum
wavelength-explicit difference between mean spectra of the KIC-1 pad
(Fig. 3a, lower left, N = 1500 pixels) and an equal number of pixels
randomly sampled from nearby tundra (\> 150 m from the nearest point on
the KIC-1 well pad) was found to be 2.6% reflectance, less than 0.5
standard deviation of the spatial variability within the pad. The mean
value of the wavelength-explicit difference spectra was 0.4%
reflectance, with a standard deviation of 1.2%. These differences are so
minor that they were not found to not be significantly different from 0
at the 90% level. Despite similarity in mean spectra, spatial
variability in spectral signatures within KIC-1 is much more variable
with two to four times greater standard deviation at all wavelengths
(Fig. 3a, bottom center).

High-resolution optical imagery also demonstrates the impacts of KIC-1
on the permafrost tundra, illustrating the value of multiple remote
sensing analysis to capture the impacts from infrastructure on remote
and inaccessible regions. Native resolution (2 m ground sampling
distance) true color WorldView-3 imagery shows the north slope blanketed
in late spring snow cover (Fig. 3b, Left image). The same image,
enlarged and enhanced, shows the impacts of KIC-1 on snow pad
accumulation and melt (Fig. 3b, center image). [This image also
highlights the significant polygonalization of the tundra immediately
north and west of the KIC-1 oil]{.underline} well pad while the tundra
to the east remains largely undisturbed. A true color WorldView-2 image
captured approximately one month later in June 2020 shows extensive
ponding and exposed substrate within the original well pad borders after
snow melt (Fig. 3b, far right image). Imagery indicates that KIC-1 pad
has had a lasting and observable impact on the tundra, even after
remediation.

Discussion

Direct measurements of pad impacts on the tundra The four proxy gravel
pads along the Dalton highway utilized for this study encompass a
proportionally smaller area than oil well pads. However, they have a
similar structure and composition to both KIC-1 and active oil well
pads, and they elevate infrastructure above the permafrost tundra with
gravel. [The pads sampled along the Dalton highway for this study are
2.3% smaller than the average oil well pad]{.underline} (0.02 km2)8. The
results from thesurveyed sites are also representative of only
aboveground activity, and they are not direct proxies for the larger
active oil and gas pads. [The operational oil and gas pads may have a
**substantially greater impact** through heat flux, soil moisture, and
pH changes both above and belowground, where they can disturb hundreds
of acres of subsurface area per oil well pad8.]{.underline}

[All four study sites showed local warming and subsequent permafrost
thaw **extending away from the pad**. Associated effects of this warming
may include enhanced standing water and hydrological flow, surface
warming, and permafrost thaw that expands from discrete pads into the
surrounding environment]{.underline} (Figs. 2, 3)36,37. Further
examining the relationships between the pad and surrounding substrate,
soil temperature decreases with distance from the pads, leading to a
thermal gradient6,12. [Additionally, the correlation between soil pH and
the distance from well pads (-0.400) could suggest that warmer soils
near well pad sites **stimulate permafrost degradation**]{.underline}
and leaching from the pad. This localized warming can amplify subsurface
thaw, contributing to an increase in water availability at depth. These
relationships have been explored in the literature6,7,12,13, and our
smaller case study reiterates these findings.

Acidic pH is a common and critical characteristic of the permafrost
soils of northern Alaska33. [Permafrost soils contain considerable soil
organic carbon, which can be up to thousands of years old15,38, and
could be released with permafrost thaw37--39. The pH buffering capacity
of the permafrost soils is linked with water retention and coupled to
carbon release]{.underline}33, indicating that [changes to the pH of the
tundra, by itself, could have greenhouse gas emission
potential]{.underline}.

[Oil well pad gravel also has the potential to alter the delicate pH
balance of surrounding permafrost6. As global temperatures increase, the
deepening of the active layer causes permafrost to transition from
stable, yearly freeze--thaw cycles to abrupt and punctuated
thaw]{.underline}40,41. The localized temperature increases
emanatingfrom oil well pads exacerbate these dynamics by increasing
water mobilization locally, with thaw expanding laterally17,19.
[Infrastructure accelerates thaw across the permafrost landscape,
elevating the chances of greenhouse gas release and abrupt
thaw1]{.underline}7,19,42. The transition from a frozen environment to
one of hydrologic flux changes the structure of the
landscape18,22,34,43, [suggesting that subsequent **remediation** could
be nearly **impossible44**]{.underline},45.

While our results are localized to the four case study proxy gravel
pads, there are many similar pads and elevated roads in North Slope
where ongoing soil profile measurements may provide further insights.
These measurements could supplement the existing literature to map the
subsurface dynamics that directly affect the evolution of above-ground
permafrost topography and biodiversity

Remote sensing analysis of pad remediation

Compared to the surrounding regions, the area around KIC-1 shows the
persistence of disturbance effects. The well damage has expanded past
the initial pad area, changing vegetation structure, deepening
permafrost thaw, and increasing hydrologic intrusion into the collocated
permafrost (Fig. 4). Looking at the Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI or greenness) and Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI
or wetness) shows that the vegetation surrounding KIC-1 has never
recovered from the disturbance, with decreased vegetation growth under
the footprint of the pad and extending out into the surrounding tundra.
The NDMI of the permafrost within the region also shows considerably
more moisture, indicating melted ice, permafrost thaw, and slumping
(Fig. 4).

[The KIC-1 oil well pad left an **unmistakable impression** on the
landscape, where the underlying permafrost, tundra vegetation, water
flow, and animal habitats are all altered]{.underline}. Future work
should track the progression of in-use oil well pads, to develop a
complete picture of permafrost impacts from oil and gas pads.

Future land cover change

[Our study emphasizes that once permafrost degradation begins, it is
**difficult to remediate**, and that the impacts of above-ground pads on
the permafrost are considerable and lasting. However, the below-ground
impacts to the subsurface environment may be substantially more
extensive.]{.underline}

The National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska covers an area of 93,078 km2 of
permafrost tundra above the Arctic Circle. With the Willow project
approved in 2023, further development is planned (Fig. 1)46. The Willow
project will introduce an estimated 250 new oil well pads, each at \~ 40
× 50 ft2.46 To construct these pads, road, air, and water vehicles must
bring infrastructure, supplies, and provisions, across over 405 km2 of
fragile permafrost tundra46. The Willow drilling project will last 30
years, ending its term in a considerably warmer world47.

[The Willow Project environmental impact report suggests **substantial
damage** to critical fish stocks, polar bears, ungulates, raptors,
walruses, seals, and numerous endangered whales caused by the
construction and drilling46.]{.underline} The project would [alter
fragile habitat, changing the region's vegetative structure, range, and
food system dynamics]{.underline}4. To fully understand the long-term
impacts of construction for energy production on the Alaskan permafrost,
further comprehensive studies must be accomplished. While remediation of
the decommissioned oil well pads and infrastructure are offered as a
solution, the long-term impacts of KIC-1 on the landscape illustrate
that true remediation is not possible.

[Contaminants in the Arctic pose signifcant risks to the environment
including the loss of biodiversity, habitat degradation,]{.underline}
and climate change interactions. [Contaminants can cause reproductive
failure in sensitive species, leading to reduced populations and loss of
biodiversity]{.underline}. For example, Sonne et al. \[142\] report that
pollutants like PCBs can affect the reproductive success of birds and
marine mammals. Additionally, [oil spills and heavy metal contamination
can degrade habitats such as shorelines and sea ice, which are crucial
for the survival of many Arctic species]{.underline} \[168\]. [Climate
change can exacerbate the impacts of contaminants because melting ice
and thawing permafrost can release previously trapped
pollutant]{.underline}s, increasing their availability and movement
through the ecosystem \[37\]. Contaminants like 3 Arctic Marine
Ecosystems 56 black carbon (soot) settle on ice and snow, reducing their
albedo (refectivity) which further accelerates ice melting \[166\].

Ayala-Borda et al. \[9\] report on eutrophication in Arctic lakes.
Excessive [nutrients from agricultural and industrial activities can be
runoff or transported to the Arctic leading to algal blooms, which
deplete oxygen in water, causing dead zones where aquatic life cannot
survive]{.underline}. 3.6.2.2 Wildlife Population Effects Pavlova et al.
\[122\] report that [high levels of PCBs have been linked to
reproductive failure in polar bears and seals]{.underline}. Contaminants
can cause reproductive issues such as reduced fertility, altered hormone
levels, and developmental abnormalities in offspring. This ultimately
contributes to population declines in certain species, particularly
those at the top of the food chain. Bioaccumulation and biomagnification
also contribute significantly to this as contaminants like [POPs and
heavy metals that accumulate in organisms, become more concentrated at
higher levels of the food chain]{.underline} \[36\]. This can lead to
toxic effects in top predators such as polar bears and birds of prey.

[Exposure to these contaminants can also weaken the immune systems of
wildlife]{.underline}, [making them more susceptible to diseases and
infections]{.underline}. This has been observed in marine mammals
exposed to heavy metals and POPs \[43\]. [Another effect]{.underline} of
contaminants on wildlife populations [is behavioral changes such as
altered feeding, mating, and migration patterns \[134\]. For instance,
mercury exposure can impair the neurological function of birds and fish,
affecting their ability to hunt and avoid predators]{.underline} \[35,
86, 161\]. 3.6.2.3 Human Health Risks

[Indigenous communities in the Arctic rely heavily on traditional diets
that include fish, marine mammals, and birds \[159\]. Dietary exposure
to these food sources, which can be contaminated with high levels of
POPs and heavy metals, can lead to increased health risks for human
populations]{.underline}. Carucci et al. \[32\] and Zulaikhah et al.
\[170\] report that exposure to mercury and other neurotoxic
contaminants can cause neurological damage, particularly in developing
fetuses and young children. This can result in speech problems, severe
autistic disorders, lifelong disabilities, other cognitive deficits,
motor skill impairments, and other developmental issues \[3, 74, 82\].
Additionally, some contaminants, such as PCBs and dioxins, are known
carcinogens and long-term exposure to these substances can increase the
risk of cancer in humans \[63\].

Similar to wildlife, [humans exposed]{.underline} to high levels of
contaminants can experience immune system suppression,
[mak]{.underline}ing [them more susceptible to infections and diseases
\[]{.underline}2, 14\]. [POPs and other chemicals can disrupt hormonal
systems]{.underline}, leading S. O. Adeniran-Obey et al. 57 to
[reproductive health issues]{.underline}, thyroid dysfunction, and other
endocrine-related disorders \[81\]. Furthermore, the health risks
associated with consuming traditional foods can have social impacts by
forcing Indigenous communities to change their diets, impacting cultural
practices and traditional ways of life \[99\].

Meanwhile, [oil and petroleum products pollute]{.underline} the
environment [on a **large scale**]{.underline}, as they are
characterized by great mobility. Every year, the area of damaged land
increases by 10,000 hectares. According to some experts, only during the
construction of the main pipeline, 500 hectares of damaged land are
accounted for every 100 km of the route.22) At the same time, [the rate
of restoration of local plant communities in the Arctic is significantly
lower than in]{.underline} more [southern regions]{.underline}, and
[**tech**nologies for recultivation of polluted lands are
**ineffective**]{.underline}. In addition, in practice, [reclamation is
carried out only along existing roads and does not affect]{.underline}
the [territories]{.underline} located [outside]{.underline} the
[roadside sections]{.underline}.

**[Often there is not a real reclamation]{.underline}**, but its
imitation: the [oil-filled areas are sprinkled with sand, after
which]{.underline} the [oil remains in the soil, getting into
groundwater and freshwater reservoirs, and then into the]{.underline}
Arctic [Ocean. Only with river runoff, several hundred thousand tons of
petroleum products are]{.underline} annually [carried into the
seas]{.underline} of the Arctic Ocean. As a result, [the concentration
of pollutants in]{.underline} many areas of [the Barents, White, Kara,
and Laptev Seas is]{.underline} already **[2-3 times higher than
normal]{.underline}**.23)

The development of liquid hydrocarbon deposits on the Arctic shelf of
Russia continues. In the period up to 2025, the volume of oil production
at the Prirazlomnoye field is expected to increase to 5 million tons. In
the period up to 2030, in an optimistic scenario, oil production will be
established at the Dolginsky field, as well as, possibly, at 1-2 more
offshore fields. Also, in the period up to 2025, geological exploration
is planned at the licensed sites. At least 10 operating license areas
for the development of hydrocarbon raw materials are located in the
Pechora Sea. The licenses issued are designed for a period up to
2025-2046. The total recoverable resources of 10 license areas in the
Pechora Sea may amount to about 600 million tons of oil and 161 billion
cubic meters of gas. At the same time, most of the license areas contain
mainly oil deposits.24)

[The elimination of oil spills in ice conditions is a separate
issue]{.underline}, which many environmentalists and designers are
currently working on. [The issue is extremely acute due to the
difficulties that arise during the liquidation of oil in an ice
environment and at subzero temperatures]{.underline}. After all, [the
use becomes impossible if the oil gets under the ice cover]{.underline}.
To solve this issue, further research is needed with the use of
empirical studies, based on which new technical methods of oil
collection will be developed or existing ones will be improved.

Implications for biodiversity and Indigenous peoples

The Arctic contains some of the world's largest untapped oil and gas
reserves. However, [oil extraction poses a **considerable risk** to
Arctic ecosystems and communities. Exploration, drilling, and offshore
oil production]{.underline} can [threaten the **fish and marine
mammals**]{.underline} that [Arctic Indigenous peoples depend
on]{.underline}. If their number is decreasing, then the [Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} of the Arctic will [face grave challenges with
secure access to food. Whales and other marine mammals are exposed to
harmful underwater noise that prevents them]{.underline} from
[navigating, finding mates, and foraging in the dark Arctic
waters]{.underline}.25) [Marine ecosystems in the Arctic are
**particularly vulnerable** to oil spills from **explosions, pipeline
leaks**, or **shipping accidents**]{.underline}.

The [lack of infrastructure and the remoteness of the Arctic
means]{.underline} that [spill response could take]{.underline} days or
[weeks. The Arctic has short summers, low temperatures, and limited
sunlight, so]{.underline} Arctic Ocean [ecosystems]{.underline} could
[**take decades to recover** from damage]{.underline}.26)

The [development of oil and gas fields can]{.underline} also [harm
**fisheries** and **tourism**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the cost of
drilling oil wells]{.underline} in the Arctic [does not bring economic
benefits. Responsibility for cleaning and accidents is high compared to
the return on investment]{.underline}, and [the benefits to Arctic
communities are small]{.underline}. At the moment, Arctic governments
are subsidizing oil and gas production rather than investing these funds
in a renewable future.

Arctic [oil and gas production contributes **even more to the climate
crisis** due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. The Arctic
states]{.underline} currently [have one of the world's largest carbon
footprints]{.underline}. They accounted for over 21 percent of global
CO2 emissions in 2016.27)

\[\*272\] [Though there are practices to mitigate accidents, **not all

[thawing permafrost strains infrastructure because it was built for

protection at the level of potentially hazardous production facilities
and complexes.

Varotsos and Krapivin (2018) use the Geoecological Information Modeling
System (GIMS) as one of the Big Data tools to assess the impact on the
Arctic Basin's ecological system and the pollution of its waters. In
simulation, heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and radionuclides are
considered as primary pollutants, and to predict the Arctic ecosystem's
state indicators of bio- complexity and survivability are used. Shulga
et al. (2020) using mathematical model of multifunctional energy complex
have shown that transition to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) should
significantly improve environmental conditions.

[Port infrastructure's development can **significantly worsen
environmental conditions**.]{.underline} As the China experience has
shown, with the ports' development, emissions from cargo ships and
container ships have become one of the most significant sources of air
pollution in port cities and surrounding areas. Such studies are
described by Zhao et al. (2020), Xu et al. (2018) and Wan et al. (2019),
who have found that [emissions depend on the type and size of ships and
the **highest percentages of pollutant emissions** are ships with a
large gross tonnage and with a high rated power of the main engines,
such as]{.underline} cruise ships, container ships and **[tankers for
liquefied gas transportation]{.underline}**. For example, López-Aparicio
et al. (2017) emphasize [the importance of a detailed emission inventory
as a basis for the development of efficient measures to reduce
emissions]{.underline} [from shipping in port areas.]{.underline}
Authors have used a bottom-up approach to develop a comprehensive
emission inventory for the Oslo Port. The main sources of ocean-going
ships' emissions, according to the research, are international ferries,
cruise ships and container ships. Sorte et al. (2019) have used
numerical simulations based on the web- based study screening tool
C-PORT to study ship emissions in Porto harbors (Portugal) to estimate
the relative contribution of different source sectors to emissions,
including ports (terminals, ships and roads), road traffic and
industrial (oil refining) sources that potentially affect the port
vicinity, including residential areas

Methods to Study Negative Impact of Transport on the Arctic Zone's
Ecosystems

[Negative impact of transport on the Arctic ecosystems is associated,
first of all, with development of shipping along the NSR, as well as
with the **logistics of raw materials** and goods for the industry and
life development in this region]{.underline}. Since the traffic on the
NSR is still insignificant, prospects and risks of the NSR development
can be assessed quite easily. However, [the **negative impact** of road
and rail transport will depend on support zones development strategy and
many factors that are stochastic.]{.underline} For the purposes of
analysis and forecasting, it will be necessary to apply multivariate
analysis and modeling, including data mining, machine learning, neural
networks, genetic algorithms, dynamic programming, etc. (Żabiński and
Zielosko, 2021).

[Numerous researches are devoted to the shipping impact along the NSR on
the ecosystems' state in the Arctic]{.underline}, which is seen as a
promising area for economic activity and a potential connecting corridor
between Asia and Europe / America. [Growth of number of ships passing
the NSR means an **increased accidents risk and related oil
spills**.]{.underline} Since the window for successful cleaning will be
short, according to Kelly et al (2018), [it is necessary to take into
account the duration of the recovery period from
pollutants]{.underline}. Dalaklis et al. (2018) show that, [as activity
is expected to increase in this region, it is imperative to assess the
current level of support for ships that will traverse the region; and
capabilities related to search and rescue operations and oil spill
response.]{.underline}

[**Arctic exploration and transportation pose significant risk**s due to
the region unique features, such as ice, harsh operating conditions,
unpredictable climatic changes and remoteness.]{.underline} Khan et al.
(2018) propose a model of an object-oriented Bayesian network for
dynamically predicting the probability of a ship colliding with ice and
assessing the risk, including the likely consequences, [**taking into
account the state of the navigation and operating system**, weather and
ice conditions, as well as human errors.]{.underline} Lin and Chang
(2018) propose a new risk model using a Bayesian network applicable to
the NSR to study the possibility of marine accidents such as collision,
flooding and grounding. The proposed model takes into account various
operational and environmental factors. When researching and controlling
the negative environmental impacts of shipping in the Arctic, travel
time, fuel consumption and related exhaust emissions from ships must be
taken into account (Schröder et al., 2017).

Impacts

 [All action alternatives would cause minor to **moderate adverse
impacts** to air quality from air pollutant emissions]{.underline}. The
majority of emissions are from fuel combustion for vessel propulsion and
power generation. The expected emission levels would equal but not
exceed air quality regulatory limits.

 The increase in emissions from the additional activities under
Alternatives 3, 4, and 5 would be minimal so the impact remains
moderate.

3.5.2 Acoustics

The [existing airborne and underwater noise environment in the EIS
project area is influenced by sounds from natural and **anthropogenic
sources.** The primary natural source of airborne noise on the offshore,
nearshore, and onshore regions is wind]{.underline}, although wildlife
can produce considerable sound during specific seasons in certain
nearshore and onshore regions. A[nthropogenic noise levels in the
Beaufort Sea region are higher than the Chukchi Sea due to the oil and
gas developments of the nearshore and onshore regions of the North
Slope]{.underline}, particularly in the vicinity of Prudhoe Bay. Noise
sources consist of regular air traffic, vehicular traffic on the
numerous roads within the development areas (such as around Deadhorse).
Noise is also produced by the operations of heavy construction and
industrial equipment that service the wells, processing facilities,
pipelines, and camps. Industrial activities occur throughout the region
on a year-round basis.

[**Anthropogenic noise levels** in the nearshore and onshore region will
be **higher in populated areas**]{.underline} -- the coastal communities
of Wainwright, Point Lay, Point Hope, Kivalina, and Barrow -- with
increasing noise levels associated with the larger communities.
Community noise consists of aircraft, vehicular traffic (including
all-terrain vehicles and snow machines), construction equipment, people
talking/yelling, dogs barking, power plants, skiffs used for hunting,
generators, etc.

Underwater noise is comprised of natural and anthropogenic sources. It
varies temporally (daily, seasonally, annually) depending on weather
conditions and the presence of anthropogenic and biological sources.
Natural sound sources in the Arctic Ocean include earthquakes, wind,
ice, and sounds from several animal species. [**Anthropogenic noise
sources include vessel traffic**, oil and gas exploration, and other
miscellaneous sources.]{.underline}

Impacts

 While high sound levels do not constitute an effect, [the presence of
high sound levels from **anthropogenic activity and consequent
exposures** of marine wildlife to these conditions could potentially
cause adverse effects. The impact criteria for acoustics are based on
the existence of sound levels that could cause effects]{.underline}.

 All action alternatives would cause moderate adverse impacts to
acoustics because they produce underwater sound levels that could exceed
ambient noise levels or exceed disturbance and injury thresholds.

The increased activity under Alternatives 3, 4 5, and 6 would not raise
the sound level above the

moderate impact level.

 The time/area closures under Alternative 5 do not reduce sound levels
but they do reduce the likelihood that exploration activities would
occur when marine mammals would be present and consequently reduce the
chances of injurious exposures. [Moderate adverse impacts remain, as the
exploration activities in non-closure areas/periods will introduce
sources that produce underwater sound levels that exceed disturbance and
injury thresholds]{.underline}.

 Under Alternative 6, the use of alternative technologies that reduce
sound levels from seismic survey sources would not reduce the impact
level which would be moderate. This is because it is unlikely the
technologies will entirely preclude the generation of sound levels
exceeding the injury and disturbance criteria.

3.6 Biological Environment

3.6.1 Marine Mammals

Bowhead and belugas whales are discussed below. The alternatives would
be expected to have mostly minor adverse impacts to other marine mammals
(other cetaceans, ice seals, Pacific walrus, and polar bear) which are
not discussed here. Mechanisms for disturbance would be similar amongst
all marine mammal species. Please see Chapter 4 of the EIS for a
complete discussion of impacts to these species. Both bowhead and beluga
whales could be present in the EIS project area throughout the spring,
summer, and fall. Both species use the area during migration and for
feeding. Bowhead whales are known to concentrate in the Barrow area for
feeding during the spring and fall, and conduct migrations through the
Beaufort and Chukchi seas in both the spring and fall. Beluga whales are
known to feed in Barrow Canyon, the Shelf Break of the Beaufort Sea, and
in Kasegaluk Lagoon.

The [primary adverse impact on bowhead and beluga whales resulting from
the action alternatives would be from **noise exposure**]{.underline}.
[Noise can cause behavioral disturbance and **auditory impairment**.
Disturbance to feeding, resting, or migrating bowhead or beluga whales
could cause whales to leave areas of exploration activity and avoid them
in the future,]{.underline} effectively reducing their available
habitat. Ship strikes and habitat degradation is also possible. Oil and
gas exploration activities that may alter whale habitat include:
disturbance of sea ice from icebreaking, disturbance of benthic
sediments during drilling, contamination of the marine environment from
discharge of drilling muds and other waste streams from ships and
support facilities.

Impacts

 [All action alternatives would cause moderate adverse impacts to
bowhead and beluga whales from noise disturbance, **risk of ship
strikes, and habitat degradation**.]{.underline}

While this [increase]{.underline} brings economic opportunities, it also
[brings greater risks for Arctic marine **ecosystems** and coastal
communities]{.underline}---because [more ships mean greater risks of
**accidents, oil spills and pollution.**]{.underline}

[Increasing pollution in the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}

About [**three quarters** of the marine fuel currently used by ships in
the Arctic is **heavy fuel oil,** or HFO.]{.underline} HFO is
problematic for Arctic ecosystems in several ways. [When this **dirty,
viscous** and polluting fossil fuel is spilled in cold polar waters, it
**breaks down even more slowly** than other fossil fuels---and there is
currently **no viable method** to remove the oil from ice.]{.underline}

[There is also **no infrastructure** in place in the Arctic from which
to stage a clean-up operation. ]{.underline} That means that [any HFO
spill will **have long-term, devastating** effects on]{.underline}
Arctic communities and [the marine ecosystems and species]{.underline}
they depend upon. It could also hinder Arctic communities' subsistence
harvesting of fish and marine mammals by contaminating coastlines[. This
could lead to **food shortages** and jeopardize livelihoods, cultures
and human health in the Arctic, especially for **Indigenous
communities**.]{.underline}

[When HFO is burned, it also produces high levels of **black carbon
particles** that are emitted into the environment through exhaust
fumes]{.underline}. Not only is black carbon a dangerous pollutant
[linked to **heart and lung disease,**]{.underline} but the black
particles it produces [also reduce the **reflectivity** of Arctic snow
and ice. This accelerates snow and ice melt, as more heat from the sun
is **absorbed** rather than reflected]{.underline}. In fact, [about **20
per cent** of the climate warming impacts of global shipping can be
attributed to black carbon.]{.underline}

Facing a rising tide of [underwater noise]{.underline}

[More ships in Arctic waters has also increased **underwater noise.**
Ship propellers create tiny **bubbles** and when these bubbles collapse,
they produce noise.]{.underline} According to a recent [Arctic Council
report]{.underline}, the amount of [underwater noise in some parts of
the Arctic Ocean has **doubled in just six years** as the result of
increased shipping.]{.underline} This is [especially alarming
considering it took]{.underline} between 30 and [**40 years**
for]{.underline} [oceans in other parts of the world to see a similar
increase.]{.underline}

[Underwater noise pollution is known to harm **marine
life**---everything from shellfish to important fish stocks to whales.
All marine mammals rely on sound to **locate food, find mates, navigate,
avoid predators and care for their young**.]{.underline} The Arctic
Ocean's [cold temperatures and]{.underline} other [oceanographic
conditions]{.underline} also [enable sound from ships to travel **long
distances** at shallow water depths.]{.underline} This means that
[underwater noise is concentrated within the **swimming and diving
ranges** of whales, walrus and seals. Even a **small increase** in ship
traffic can have a significant impact on the acoustic environment of the
Arctic Ocean compared to other oceans]{.underline} around the world.

[Anthropogenic activities]{.underline} have [significantly contributed
to climate change in the Arctic. The primary driver]{.underline} of this
change [is the increased emission of]{.underline} greenhouse gases
([GHGs]{.underline}), particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane
(CH4), resulting from fossil fuel combustion, industrial activities, and
deforestation \[4,116\]. These emissions enhance the greenhouse effect,
trapping heat in the atmosphere and leading to rising temperatures
\[117\]. Global warming caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions
is leading to a significant reduction in the Arctic's sea ice \[7\].
Black carbon, a short-lived climate pollutant produced from incomplete
combustion of fossil fuels and biomass, settles on Arctic ice, reducing
its reflectivity (albedo) and accelerating melting \[118\].

In conjunction with the effects of climate change, various [other
human-induced stressors, such as air and water pollution, overfishing,
depletion of the ozone]{.underline} layer, [habitat modification, and
pollution]{.underline} resulting [from resource extraction, as well as
the escalating pressure on land and resources, are affecting life in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The [increase in wildfire seasons]{.underline} in
the Arctic has [made forest fires more intense and
destructive]{.underline} \[119\], [resulting in deforestation and loss
of forest cover]{.underline} \[120\] [due to]{.underline} a combination
of climatic and non-climatic factors, predominantly [human-caused
climate change]{.underline} \[121\]. Industrial activities, such as oil
and gas extraction in the Arctic, contribute to environmental
degradation and climate instability \[122\]. The [**expansion of
shipping routes**, enabled by sea ice loss, **increases emissions of
pollutants**]{.underline}, further [warming the atmosphere]{.underline}
\[123\]. [A notable example is the]{.underline} increasing [presence of
**liquefied natural gas tankers**, which produce **methane leaks**
during transport]{.underline}, further **[amplifying Arctic
warming]{.underline}** \[124\]. Deforestation and [land-use
changes]{.underline}, particularly in boreal forests bordering the
Arctic, [**reduce carbon sequestration capacity** and **alter regional
climate patterns**]{.underline} \[125\]. [The combination
of]{.underline} these [human-induced factors is **accelerating changes
in Arctic ecosystems**, leading to **biod**iversity **loss, disruptions
in Indigenous livelihoods**, and **shifts in global climate patterns due
to altered oceanic and atmospheric circulation**]{.underline} \[72\].

[Natural resource extraction]{.underline} is increasing in the Arctic
and [is a significant contributing factor]{.underline} to the rise in
Arctic shipping. This can be [observed in]{.underline} the case of
increasing [iron ore extraction]{.underline} in the Arctic \[126\]. The
[transportation of bulk carriers]{.underline} carrying large quantities
of various products, such as food grains, ores, coal, and cement, [has
increased substantially]{.underline}. Shipping activity increased by 37%
from 2013 to 2023 and the distance sailed by all the vessels increased
by 75% \[127\]. Shipping activities in the Arctic have significant
effects on biogeophysical systems, including the atmosphere and the
ocean. In the atmosphere, [shipping contributes to]{.underline}
greenhouse gas [emissions and the **release of black carbon**, which
**accelerates ice melting**]{.underline} \[128\]. In the ocean,
[shipping causes **pollution, overharvesting of marine resources**,
**disturbances to marine species, underwater noise pollution**, and the
**introduction of invasive species**]{.underline} \[129\].
[These]{.underline} impacts [pose risks to both the **environment and
society**, particularly for]{.underline} the [Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline} who rely on these systems \[130\]. The Arctic is
estimated to contain approximately 13% (90 billion barrels) of the
world's undiscovered conventional oil resources and 30% of its
undiscovered conventional natural gas resources \[131\]. It supplies
roughly 10% of its oil and 25% of its natural gas to the world \[132\].
[With the melting of Arctic ice, there is increased exploration and
production of fossil fuels in the area, leading to climate
change]{.underline}.

4.3. Feedback Mechanisms in the Arctic

[The Arctic is vulnerable to]{.underline} a variety of [**feedback
mechanisms** that accelerate warming and alter climate
dynamics]{.underline} \[4\]. [Ice--albedo feedback]{.underline}, which
occurs [when]{.underline} the [ice cover shrinks, exposes darker ocean
or land surfaces]{.underline} \[10\]. [This]{.underline} exposed surface
[absorbs more solar energy than ice]{.underline}, which reflects
sunlight, [resulting in **increased heat** and **accelerated ice
melting**. This cycle]{.underline} of melting ice and increased heat
absorption [is an important driver of Arctic warming]{.underline}
\[133\]. The [release of greenhouse gases from permafrost thawing is an
**important feedback mechanism**]{.underline} \[134\]. As permafrost
thaws, the organic material trapped beneath it decomposes, emitting
carbon dioxide and methane, both of which are important greenhouse gases
\[18\]. These emissions add to atmospheric warming, which increases
permafrost thaw, resulting in a feedback loop that affects global
greenhouse gas levels. [Ocean circulation patterns]{.underline} also
[play an important part. As Arctic ice melts and freshwater flows into
the ocean, it alters the salinity and density of seawater]{.underline},
potentially [slowing the]{.underline} Atlantic Meridional Overturning
Circulation ([AMOC]{.underline}). [A weaker AMOC could slow the transfer
of warm water northward, affecting climatic patterns **far beyond the
Arctic**]{.underline} \[80\]. Together, [these feedback mechanisms show
the **interdependence of Arctic changes**, with **each loop exacerbating
warming** and **changing** not only the Arctic but also **the worldwide
climate system**]{.underline}.

4.4. Arctic Amplification (AA)

Arctic amplification is a process in which [the Arctic region warms at a
much higher rate than the global average]{.underline}, as supported by
instrumental evidence, climate models, and paleoclimate proxy records
\[135,136\]. Several connected mechanisms contribute to this rapid
warming, including marine heating and the ice--albedo feedback mechanism
(Figure 3), which exposes darker ocean surfaces when sea ice melts,
resulting in higher solar energy absorption \[4\]. [Atmospheric feedback
mechanisms]{.underline}, such as Planck feedback, lapse-rate feedback,
and cloud feedback, as well as ocean heat transport and meridional
atmospheric moisture transport, also [play important roles]{.underline}
\[137,138\]. Recent decreases in air pollution in Europe \[139\] have
been related to increasing Arctic warming, and future reductions in
Asian aerosols owing to mitigation policies may exacerbate this trend
\[140\]. Despite the well-known trends, there is little agreement on the
exact magnitude of AA, with studies reporting Arctic warming at nearly
twice, thrice, and four times the global average. The Arctic Monitoring
and Assessment Programme reports a rate of warming three times faster
than global warming from 1971 to 2019 \[141\]. The differences stem from
different definitions of AA, such as the time periods and geographical
limits examined. While climate models, notably those in the Coupled
Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6), have made progress in
modelling Arctic climate evolution and sea ice dynamics, many continue
to struggle to appropriately depict the sensitivity of sea ice loss to
global temperature increases. Understanding whether climate models can
effectively reproduce the reported scale of AA is important, given that
sea ice loss is an important cause of the phenomena. Although previous
research suggests that AA is weaker in climate models than in
observations \[142\], a complete comparison with the most recent
observational datasets has yet to be undertaken. [Arctic amplification
is an important climate phenomenon with far-reaching implications for
global climate systems, emphasising the need for]{.underline} further
[research and better climate models]{.underline} to support effective
policy decisions targeted at minimising climate change impacts.

AA is a well-known phenomenon characterised by increased warming in the
Arctic relative to the global average, primarily caused by such
processes as sea ice--albedo feedback, which reduces the surface albedo
as ice melts, exposing more ocean that absorbs heat \[143,144\]. Recent
research has highlighted the subtle functions of cloud and water vapour
feedback mechanisms, with increased cloud cover blocking incoming solar
radiation while increasing downward longwave radiation, resulting in net
warming \[145\]. [Temperature feedback, influenced by stable
stratification of the Arctic atmosphere, leads to positive feedback via
a lower lapse rate, resulting in higher warmth aloft]{.underline}
\[146\]. [The movement of heat and water vapour from lower latitudes to
the Arctic **exacerbates regional warming**]{.underline} \[10,147\].
Despite a thorough understanding of these mechanisms, quantifying their
relative contributions is difficult, implying that Arctic amplification
persists even when specific feedback mechanisms are suppressed,
resulting in dynamic competition among feedback processes in climate
models \[142\].

1 Introduction [Global climate change is imposing severe stresses on
ecosystems throughout the world, and nowhere more so than in Arctic seas
and their surrounding lands]{.underline}. Climate warming is amplified
at these high northern latitudes and is resulting in rapid changes in
the ice regimes that polar marine life depends upon. [These changes are
also impacting the Indigenous communities that have lived in the region
for millennia, and whose traditional cultures are closely linked to the
ice and ecosystem health of the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}. [Warming
temperatures and loss of ice habitats, combined with ocean
acidification]{.underline} and contaminant inputs, [have moved Arctic
marine ecosystems towards a precarious state that is vulnerable to
additional stresses. The ongoing loss of Arctic sea ice has opened up
opportunities for new shipping operations in the region, and much
greater maritime traffic is projected for the future.]{.underline} Cargo
shipping through the Northern Sea Route increased by nearly fourfold
since between 2013 and 2018,1 and is also increasing across the Canadian
Arctic.2 Global warming above 2°C is projected to allow navigability
through the Northwest Passage for all vessel types during the ice-free
season, and to increase the season length for shipping in the Beaufort
Sea region to 100--200 days, rising to 200--300 days at 4°C.3 Given the
uncertainties of the Arctic ice regime, ongoing changes in Arctic ship
traffic4 will be tempered by operational and commercial risks,5 but
further large increases could occur if operators are prepared to risk
marginally unsafe conditions.6 Although [shipping brings]{.underline}
socioeconomic benefits including employment opportunities and the
transport of people, resources and vital supplies, it also has
potentially [negative effects on marine ecosystems and the adjacent
coastal land-based ecosystems. These include physical impacts, such as
noise pollution, icebreaking and collisions with animals, chemical
impacts, such as oil pollution, aerosol release and wastewater
discharge, and biological impacts, such as the transport of invasive
species and disruption of seasonal bird and mammal
migrations.]{.underline} In the polar regions, these impacts are
amplified by many features that are characteristic of high latitudes,
such as persistent cold temperatures that limit the break-down of
pollutants, the short summer season for peak biological activities, and
the reduced species diversity that lessens the resilience to
perturbations. Our aim in this chapter is to review the current state of
Arctic Ocean ecosystems and their vulnerability to increased shipping
traffic. We first introduce the key features of these ecosystems,
including ecological values that make the region of special interest and
concern for long-term conservation. We summarize recent observations of
rapid change, the projections of future change, and evidence of
increasing multiple stresses across the Arctic Ocean and its coastal
lands. We then summarize the potential negative effects of shipping,
with attention to the particularities of Arctic marine ecosystems, and
conclude by identifying mitigation strategies that may allow future
shipping developments to proceed carefully, and with reduced risk of
catastrophic impacts.

### Link\-\--Shipping\-\--Disease

#### Arctic shipping causes diseases.

Valerie **Brown 24**, Award-Winning Explanatory Science Journalist,
Member of the Society of Environmental Journalists, "A rising danger in
the Arctic," Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 11-25-2024, accessed

[Increased shipping and **accelerating development**]{.underline} are
closely tied **[in the Arctic]{.underline}** and **[present a
significant risk for disease spread]{.underline}**. There is great
interest in a trans-Arctic shipping route between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans because it could shave five days off the current transit
time through the Suez and Panama Canals for voyages between Asia,
Europe, and eastern North America. Shipping interests eagerly anticipate
the point when the trans-Arctic sea routes are ice-free year-round.

It\'s uncertain whether industrial and commercial development in the
Arctic will continue apace in the short run. The Russia-Ukraine war has
somewhat dampened enthusiasm for trans-Arctic shipping, as have the
ongoing threat of sea ice blockages and problems maintaining land
infrastructure crucial to both shipping and oil and gas exploration,
including pipelines. But absent some reversal of climate warming or a
global economic shock, shipping activity in the Arctic is expected to
only go up. Over the last decade, Arctic shipping has certainly done so,
as measured by overall ship traffic, distances sailed, and the striking
example of the Mary River iron mine in Baffinland, where traffic in the
nearby port of Milne Inlet jumped 583 percent in five years.

[Ships move]{.underline} about [10 billion tons of ballast water around
the world annually. Ships]{.underline} typically [dump their ballast
water, which helps maintain ship stability]{.underline}, in port and
take in new water for the next journey. [Expanded Arctic shipping
brings]{.underline} with it [**a severe threat of microbe exchange**
between more southerly and Arctic waters]{.underline}. David Lodge,
professor at Cornell\'s Atkinson Center for Sustainability, has studied
the explosion of invasive species in the world\'s ports and coastlines.
There is little data on the Arctic, so he stresses he is speculating,
but says, \"I think [ships are the more likely way to bring]{.underline}
quite [**novel organisms** including microbes into]{.underline} the
Arctic [and out of the Arctic]{.underline}.\"

The Russian city of [Murmansk is the port with the highest risk of
spreading invasive species]{.underline}, according to a 2016 paper by
Notre Dame University computer scientist Mandana Saebi and colleagues.
Most of the Murmansk traffic moves between Russian ports and those in
Nordic countries. But many [voyages]{.underline} also [connect with
ports to the south]{.underline}; for example, some voyages stopping at
Murmansk also visit West African ports. [This could exacerbate the
spread of polar diseases southward **and move tropical diseases into
regions with expanding human presence** that are rapidly losing
permafrost and sea ice]{.underline}.

[Tourist ships can]{.underline} also [be a source of microbe
exchange]{.underline}. The Arctic Council\'s shipping survey found that
the number of cruise ships in the Arctic jumped from 58 in 2013 to 96 in
2023, and [cruise ships remain the sixth largest ship type]{.underline}
behind fishing and cargo ships. One experiment found that [antibiotic
shoe wash placed where tourists moved on and off their ship did
not]{.underline} effectively [reduce their shoes\' microbial
load]{.underline}. The [passengers]{.underline} in the study
[visited]{.underline} the [Svalbard]{.underline} archipelago, [where
concerns about microbial invasions affecting the terrestrial ecosystem
are high]{.underline}.

all of vital concern to the Indigenous communities that live at the
Arctic coast in close association with the marine environment.53 In
t[heir assessment of Arctic shipping in the context of these global
changes, the Inuit Circumpolar Council identified a wide range of
issues]{.underline}, especially those relating to the health of marine
ecosystems that Inuit depend upon for traditional food supplies, culture
and general well-being.54 4 [Ecological Consequences of Arctic
Shipping]{.underline} The impacts of shipping on marine life occur at
multiple levels, [from effects on individuals and populations, to
perturbation of biological communities, food webs and
ecosystem]{.underline}s. In Canada, the federal Department of Fisheries
and Oceans has developed a detailed framework to assess these impacts by
way of 'Pathway of Effects' (PoE) conceptual models.55 These involve
identifying the known linkages between shipping activities, stressors
and effects, and then assessing the ecological risk associated with
these specific pathways relative to the conservation goals within a
particular area. Stressors that would be relevant to such an assessment
can be separated into three categories: chemical, physical and
biological. 4.1 [Chemical Pollution]{.underline} The [most devastating
effects of shipping on Arctic Ocean ecosystems would be through oil
pollution, resulting, for example, from vessel collisions or
grounding.]{.underline} These have the potential to cause serious
impacts anywhere in the world, [but the consequences for northern marine
environments are worsened by several factors that are specific to the
Arctic and to cold polar seas]{.underline}. The remoteness of the Arctic
Ocean and the sparse distribution of land-based infrastructure mean that
[clean-up operations would be slow to mobilize and difficult to ramp
up]{.underline}, with activities further constrained by the severe
weather conditions at high latitudes. [Microbes that degrade
hydrocarbons do occur naturally in the polar oceans, but incubation
experiments with Arctic seawater show that their degradation rates are
extremely slow]{.underline} at the cold ambient temperatures.56
Similarly, [evaporation rates are slow in the cold]{.underline}, and the
ocean currents and increasingly mobile sea ice would likely disperse the
oil spills over large areas and extensive tracts of coastline. Finally,
the [specialized food webs of the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}, already
under stress, [have limited resilience to chemical
pollution]{.underline} and would likely collapse in the face of this
type of catastrophic event. [The impacts of oil pollution can persist
well into the future]{.underline}. When the oil tanker TV [Exxon
Valdez]{.underline} ran aground in subarctic Prince William Sound,
Alaska, in 1989, the resultant oil pollution [caused the death of
250,000 seabirds, thousands of marine mammals and millions of fish
eggs]{.underline}. In addition to these acute impacts, there were
chronic effects on the coastal ecosystem. A pod of killer whales that
were heavily impacted will likely never recover, and 27 years later,
[patches of oil were still found on the beaches and are likely to
persist for decades longe]{.underline}r.57 To assess the socioeconomic
impacts of a potential oil spill on a community in the Canadian Arctic,
a recent study simulated the conditions of an Exxon Valdez spill in the
Rankin Inlet region and asked a broad range of respondents with
different backgrounds and expertise to evaluate this scenario.58 The
simulation indicated that social as well as financial costs would
increase through time over several years associated with the impacts on
hunting, the local economy, culture and social activities, with lasting
psychological effects and legal costs. In regular shipping operations,
[chemical pollution can occur from multiple types of discharges from
underway or anchored vessels, including antifouling substances, ballast
water, black water, grey water, tank cleaning, cooling water, scrubber
water, bilge water, propeller shaft lubricants, solid waste and
atmospheric pollution]{.underline}.59 [Atmospheric releases from ships
include black carbon (soot]{.underline}) and other particles that absorb
light and accelerate the melting of snow and ice that they settle upon,
along with sulphur and nitrogen oxides that are biologically and
chemically active. A study in a remote Svalbard fjord showed that the
presence of tourist ships increased fine particle concentrations in the
local atmosphere by up to 81 percent, and the observations implied that
large areas of the Svalbard archipelago already experience some chemical
influence from shipping.60 A model analysis for the Canadian Arctic
indicated that the effects of shipping are currently low, [but that
further shipping expansion up to the year 2030 could increase total
deposition of pollutants by 20 percent for sulphur, 50 percent for
nitrogen and up to 30 percent for black carbon]{.underline}.61 The
deposition of ship-derived acidic sulphur and nitrogen oxides may also
influence Arctic freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. In a chemical
study of more than 1,000 Arctic Canadian lakes, a high percentage were
found to be sensitive to acid deposition, which would impair their
habitat quality for Arctic char.62 4.2 [Physical Stressors Noise
pollution by ships has become an ecological threat of increasing concern
throughout the world ocean]{.underline},63 and although much of the
Arctic Ocean is acoustically quiet, ship noise represents a new
intrusion. [Arctic marine animals are known to be sensitive to noise,
and ship noise pollution is already rising to levels that may be causing
stress.]{.underline} [Narwhals are especially sensitive, with reactions
up to 40 km distant from a ship]{.underline} and cessation of foraging
at distances of 7--8 km.64 A recent analysis has identified noise risk
hotspots at the eastern end of the Northwest Passage where there is a
combination of elevated shipping noise and high population densities of
narwhals and seabirds.65 [Ice integrity is critical for certain
ecosystem processes in the Arctic, and the timing and magnitude of
icebreaker shipping activities are therefore of concern]{.underline}.
For example, terrestrial animal migration in the Canadian Arctic
[Archipelago is important for genetic exchange and for access to
seasonal food resources.66 The rupture of ice bridges, used by migrating
animals and already weakened by climate warming, could have lasting
impacts on animal populations]{.underline}. Surveys in the south central
part of the Archipelago over the period 1977--1980 identified 73
crossing sites on sea ice for caribou. [The study concluded that ship
tracks through the ice would severely impede migration]{.underline}, and
that the "the ice shelf and the ice-block rubble pushed-up along the
edges of the track could be a death-trap" for caribou on the ice.67 In
the Last Ice Area at the top of Canada, the ice is retained by an ice
arch that forms between Ellesmere Island and Greenland[. This arch
appears to be weakening as a consequence of climate change,68 and
extensive icebreaker activities in this area could threaten the
integrity of this important conservation area.]{.underline} Finally[,
collisions with marine animals are unlikely events, but the probability
increases with increasing ship traffic, and incidents have been reported
for dozens of species throughout the world]{.underline}.69 Some Arctic
animals may be especially susceptible. In an analysis of bowhead whales
harvested in Alaska from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas population,
about 1 percent showed scars from ship collisions70 and even sublethal
strikes increase the stress on animals that are contending with multiple
other pressures. In a vulnerability assessment of 80 subpopulations of
seven Arctic marine mammals in the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest
Passage, more than half were exposed to open water vessel routes, with
narwhals the most vulnerable given their high sensitivity and
exposure.71

4.3 Biological Effects [Ships are well known vectors for the transfer of
new species into marine ecosystems, often with severe ecological and
economic consequences]{.underline}. In the Arctic, of [54 known species
invasions, 39 percent could be attributed to ships, via either ballast
water or by fouling of the ship hull]{.underline}.72 Under the 2004
International Convention for the Control and Management of Ship's
Ballast Water and Sediments, ships are required to exchange their
ballast waters at sea to avoid biological contamination of ports and
coastal areas,73 [but modelling of ballast water discharges in the
Arctic indicate that currents may then transport such waters to
localized coastal areas where invasive species may accumulate and
perhaps establish]{.underline}.74 [Climate change is likely to
accelerate the habitat expansion of some invasive species. For example,
the European brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) is thought to have entered
Icelandic coastal waters via ship ballast in the early 2000s. It is now
well established there, and has become an important predator of
plaice]{.underline} (Pleureonectes platessa), a commercially valuable
fish species.75 Along with several other invasive species, the northward
expansion of brown shrimp is likely, and may be favoured by climate
warming.76 Potential biological effects by ship discharges under the
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
(MARPOL) have not been evaluated in the Arctic, but local pelagic as
well as bottom-dwelling communities could be impacted by discharge of
pathogens and invasive species. 5 Policy Directions to Minimize Shipping
Impacts As a consequence of climate change and other global processes,
the Arctic Ocean is experiencing large-scale perturbations that are
likely to worsen over the course of this century. Plans to extend
shipping routes and increase traffic must therefore be evaluated with
the knowledge that not only do Arctic marine ecosystems have unique
ecological features requiring special care and protection, but they also
have uniquely limited resilience to environmental change, [which is
already pushing these biological systems to their limits. Shipping now
imposes a new set of pressures on Arctic ecosystems and their
increasingly stressed biota and food chains]{.underline}. Efforts to
avoid catastrophic impacts are required at multiple levels, from global
mitigation of carbon emissions to protect and restore Arctic sea ice, to
the strengthening of pollution prevention, safety and emergency
standards and protocols, the establishment and expansion of marine
protected areas, and further scrutiny and regulation of maritime
practices in north polar waters. [The risk of invasive marine species
from the south via ship hulls and ballast water, as well as the risk of
accidental and operational discharge of pollutants, such as oil, noxious
liquid substances and sewage, in frigid Arctic waters that have little
capacity for microbial breakdown of pollutants]{.underline} require
stringent measures of prevention and response. Recognition of the risks
related to discharge has prompted the negotiation of the International
Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code).77 This landmark
instrument contains both guidelines and regulations. The latter have
become mandatory through amendments to the International Convention for
the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)78 and MARPOL,79 and both parts of this
instrument are relevant to protecting Arctic marine ecosystems. [There
is a need for continued efforts to broaden the scope of these provisions
in the light of new ecological information about the Arctic Ocean and
its biota]{.underline}, and more stringent regulations are required.
Revisions to the Polar Code should be based on the precautionary
approach, with restrictions on substances and activities, even if the
exact extent of their harmfulness is not yet scientifically determined.
[Efforts to further strengthen existing rules and standards also need to
continue beyond the framework of the Polar Code. Regarding the use of
heavy fuel oil]{.underline} (HFO) and ship emissions, such as sulphur
and black carbon, restrictions greatly lessen the extent of atmospheric
pollution. Modeling analysis of the Canadian Arctic showed that emission
controls, such as those applied to the current North American Emission
Control Area created under MARPOL in 2011,80 would substantially reduce
the impact of shipping on atmospheric pollutants in this region.81
Combustion of HFO results in the highest marine fuel emissions of black
carbon, sulphur and other pollutants; [additionally, release of this
fuel type into the water would be especially dangerous for Arctic marine
ecosystems given its high viscosity, slow degradation and likelihood of
being trapped and transported by the sea ice]{.underline}. Although a
ban on the carriage and use of HFO s by ships in Arctic waters will take
effect on 1 July 2024, exemptions and waivers will remain applicable
until 1 July 2029.82 Furthermore, the sulphur content in fuel oil used
by ships worldwide, including in the Arctic, has been limited to a
maximum amount of 0.5 percent m/m (mass by mass) since 1 January 2020.83
However, uncertainties remain about the behaviour of lower sulphur
marine fuels in the Arctic, including the question of whether they may
in some cases generate higher black carbon emissions.84 Between 2015 and
2019, black carbon emissions grew by 72 percent for ships using HFO in
the Arctic and by 85 percent overall for all ships operating in the
Arctic.85 International Maritime Organization discussions on how best to
protect the Arctic from black carbon emissions of ships are underway,86
but for the time being, States and ship operators are simply invited "to
voluntarily use distillate or other cleaner alternative fuels or methods
of propulsion."87 [The high sensitivity of Arctic marine animals to
noise is now supported by recent scientific analyses]{.underline}
(described above), yet only general, non-binding Guidelines for the
Reduction of Underwater Noise from Commercial Shipping to Address
Adverse Impacts on Marine Life exist at present.88 As these 2014
Guidelines are currently undergoing revision,89 there may be a window of
opportunity to specifically address noise caused by shipping in polar
waters and to work towards binding regulations.

#### SMR's hurt the environment and risk nuclear prolif

Dawn **Stover 24**, B.A. from Carleton College in Biology; M.A. in
Journalism from New York University; Contributing Editor at Bulletin of
the Atomic Scientists; 4-1-2024, \"Say no to small modular reactors:
Stop normalizing the exploitation of nature\", Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists,

Among other global crises, [the worsening impacts of climate change are
intensifying every year]{.underline}. Last year was the warmest on
record and, beginning in March 2023, raging wildfires filled cities
across Canada with smoke for months. This year is already shaping up to
be warmer than the last. This is why a lot of young people are
questioning the very systems we live under. This is why many of us
support a rapid and just transition in energy. But in this process,
[some governments are promoting an expansion of nuclear
power]{.underline}, supposedly to solve climate change. I fear that
[such an expansion will result in my generation having to confront an
equally terrifying set of problems]{.underline} resulting from the
nuclear fuel chain. This is precisely what I already see happening
around me in the Canadian province of New Brunswick where I live and
study. Over the last few years, the province's government has advocated
for and funded the development of what it calls [small modular reactors
(SMRs)]{.underline}. Even though SMR doesn't include the word "nuclear,"
these are nuclear reactors. Ostensibly, [these reactors are meant to
decarbonize the Canadian economy]{.underline}. But in 2021, New
Brunswick Energy Minister Mike Holland protested the 2030 target for
phasing out coal in the province, saying [new nuclear reactors would not
be ready in time]{.underline} to meet that goal. How will the expansion
of nuclear power decarbonize the economy if, meanwhile, New Brunswick is
still extracting and burning fossil fuels? The province has funded [two
companies]{.underline}---[Moltex Energy and ARC Clean
Technology]{.underline}---[to develop small modular
reactors]{.underline}. On their websites, Moltex and ARC market nuclear
power as "clean," "carbon free," and a "clean energy solution." Last
year, Moltex CEO Rory O'Sullivan spoke to me, my fellow students, and
professors working on the Plutonium Project at St. Thomas University in
Fredericton, New Brunswick, in which we explored these small modular
reactors being proposed for the province to develop an understanding of
the assumptions, claims, and implications of these technologies. I
remember O'Sullivan as friendly and well-spoken. He emphasized that a
transition away from fossil fuels is necessary and that renewable energy
is a key element in this transition. Yet he told us that wind farms, for
example, could not generate enough energy to sustain our society, and
that battery storage was not advanced enough to help with this, and thus
renewables could not be considered an effective climate solution on
their own. This is why he advocates for small modular reactors---as a
necessary supplement to renewables in the energy transition. But, again,
he stressed that, at Moltex, they were working to reduce any potential
safety risks. This made me wonder: What about the [highly radioactive
waste these reactors will produce]{.underline}? Even if SMRs produce
less waste than past nuclear reactors (although not when weighted by how
much electricity they produce), [spent fuel will remain dangerously
radioactive for thousands of years]{.underline}. [While nuclear
proponents have argued that a deep geological repository would be an
effective storage space for the waste]{.underline}, there are [many
uncertainties]{.underline} surrounding this proposal, and the long-term
impacts are unknown. The proposed sites for the repository are located
on traditional Indigenous lands in the Wabigoon Lake Ojibway
Nation-Ignace and Saugeen Ojibway Nation-South Bruce areas in Ontario.
Because the safety of the proposed repository is unproven, [storing
radioactive waste]{.underline} there [would jeopardize the health of the
local Indigenous communities]{.underline} and their lands.
[Moltex]{.underline} and ARC have [advertised reprocessing]{.underline}
as a way [to recycle waste]{.underline} and use it to power other
reactors. However, [this is also incredibly dangerous]{.underline},
because [once plutonium is separated from used nuclear
fuel]{.underline}, [it can be used much more easily in the production of
atomic weapons]{.underline}. If separated plutonium were to fall into
the wrong hands, the result would be nuclear proliferation---an
increased number of nuclear weapons across the globe. In addition to the
waste and proliferation problems, [small modular reactors]{.underline}
will [not]{.underline} be built and operating in time to be [an
effective climate solution]{.underline}. [Canada's climate
targets]{.underline} involve decreasing greenhouse gas emissions to 40
per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and [reaching net-zero by
2050]{.underline}. However, ARC predicts that it will finish building
its first small modular reactor by 2028 which will "replace the existing
coal generation station in 2030" at Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating
Station in Saint John, New Brunswick. And [Moltex does not expect to
have an "operational reactor" until "the early 2030s."]{.underline} This
timeline will clearly not help Canada reach its decarbonization goal by
2030, and so the country will not be on track for the 2050 goal either.
Given these realities, I find it [hard to believe]{.underline} that
[nuclear power is in the best interest of human]{.underline}s, non-human
species, or the planet as a whole. Capitalist nations that prioritize
economic growth above all else, such as the [United States and Canada,
have normalized the exploitation of nature]{.underline}. [This has
happened with the extraction]{.underline} and combustion [of fossil
fuels, and it will happen again with the radioactive waste]{.underline}
produced by new nuclear reactors if humans do not learn from past
mistakes. It is hard enough to deal with the large stockpile of
radioactive waste produced by conventional nuclear reactors that were
built during the late 20th century, when the public and even experts
knew less about how difficult this material is to deal with. Humans
cannot effect meaningful change in the face of the climate crisis
without seriously reexamining the relationship they have with Earth. Can
we dismantle the current relationship in favor of reciprocal
relationships with the natural world and each other? I had an
interesting conversation on January 14 with gkisedtanamoogk, a Wampanoag
elder and member of the Otter Clan from the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe in
Cape Cod, Massachusetts, about learning to listen to the natural world.
I am a research assistant for the Contesting Energy Discourses through
Action Research (CEDAR) Project, and I met gkisedtanamoogk during a
panel on energy transitions at a CEDAR event. Wampanoag elder speaking
at St. Thomas University in October 2023gkisedtanamoogk, an elder from
the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe in Massachusetts, spoke about energy
transitions at St. Thomas University in October 2023. gkisedtanamoogk
went by an English name and identified as a typical "Joe America" until
the 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, by followers of the
American Indian Movement. This made gkisedtanamoogk, then a sophomore in
college, wonder about what it meant to be a Wampanoag. gkisedtanamoogk
traveled back to the Mashpee community to explore traditional songs,
languages, and ceremonies with other young people there. After becoming
reconnected to these Indigenous roots, gkisedtanamoogk---who now goes by
thing/it pronouns because so many of its teachers are non-human and are
often referred to with these terms---abandoned its English name in favor
of its traditional Indigenous name. gkisedtanamoogk has identified as
"Joe Wampanoag" ever since. gkisedtanamoogk is now married to
Miigam'agan, the Elder-in-Residence at St. Thomas University and an
elder of the Burnt Church First Nation in New Brunswick. The proposal to
construct small modular reactors at Point Lepreau---the site of New
Brunswick's only existing nuclear power plant---is close to home for
gkisedtanamoogk, who moved to the province years ago to live with
Miigam'agan. In our conversation, gkisedtanamoogk told me, "I can't help
but notice that Earth and Creation go to great lengths to keep us alive.
They make a place for us, and we have a duty and an obligation and a
responsibility to be reciprocal." When gkisedtanamoogk spoke these
words, it was with a soft but powerful voice. gkisedtanamoogk's gray
hair was shaved on the sides, and the rest was pulled back into a short
ponytail at the nape. Earrings made from some kind of animal tooth
dangled from each of gkisedtanamoogk's ears, and I noticed a couple
dragonfly pins: one attached to gkisedtanamoogk's hat alongside a bird
feather and the other pinned over gkisedtanamoogk's heart. Maybe a
reciprocal relationship with Earth is about learning to listen to the
whispers in the trees and the songs in the wind, or the "ancient song"
as gkisedtanamoogk calls it---and recognizing all the natural world does
for us. In doing so, humans can reconnect with the natural community and
remember their place in it. With this respect for nature, humans can
then stop degrading it with our energy pursuits, from dirty fossil fuels
to radioactive nuclear power. Nearly two-thirds of Canadians support an
emissions cap on the oil and gas industry. The majority of Canadians
recognize the necessity for a transition away from fossil fuels. But
[let's not transition into an age of radioactive waste and nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}. Let's not transition to another problem
disguised as a solution. In her book Braiding Sweetgrass, Robin Wall
Kimmerer, a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation based in Shawnee,
Oklahoma, writes beautifully about a reciprocal relationship with the
planet, rather than an exploitative one: "As we work to heal the earth,
the earth heals us." Canadians must begin to mend their relationship
with the natural world through actions such as transitioning to
renewable energy and consuming less overall. But we all must act now,
[in the most responsible and caring ways that we can, so that we do not
leave a legacy of environmental destruction and toxic waste for future
generations.]{.underline} Earth has sustained us since time immemorial,
and we have a responsibility to give back to the natural world for all
it has given to us. That is the legacy I want to leave.

[Sources of **radioactive contamination** in the Arctic are
multifaceted, encompassing both natural and anthropogenic
origins]{.underline}. Naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORMs)
such as uranium and thorium are present in the Earth's crust and can be
mobilized through geological processes, albeit typically at low
concentrations that pose minimal ecological risk \[2, 34\]. In stark
contrast, [**anthropogenic sources** have introduced significant amounts
of radioactivity into the Arctic marine environment]{.underline}.
Prominent among these are the historical and ongoing impacts of nuclear
weapons testing, which peaked during the mid-twentieth century and
released substantial quantities of radionuclides like cesium-137 and
strontium-90 into the atmosphere \[11, 18\]. These isotopes have been
transported to the Arctic through atmospheric and oceanic circulation
patterns, leading to widespread contamination \[25, 44\]. [Accidents at
nuclear power plants, such as **the catastrophic failures** at Chernobyl
in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011, have further exacerbated the issue by
releasing large amounts of radioactive materials into the
environment]{.underline}, which have subsequently been detected in the
Arctic. Additionally, the [**deliberate or accidental dumping** of
nuclear waste, including submarine reactor cores and contaminated
equipment, has contributed to localized hotspots of
radioactivity]{.underline} \[33, 54\]. The Arctic has also been affected
by radioactive discharges from reprocessing plants, where spent nuclear
fuel is treated, leading to the release of radionuclides into the marine
environment. These combined sources have created a complex and
persistent problem of radioac- tive contamination in the Arctic, posing
significant challenges for environmental monitoring and remediation
efforts.

12.3 Mechanisms of Radioactive Contamination Spread in the Arctic Marine
Environment

The mechanisms of radioactive contamination spread in the Arctic marine
environ- ment are intricate and influenced by various dynamic processes.
A[tmospheric trans- port is a primary pathway, whereby **radionuclides
released from sources** such as nuclear weapons testing or reactor
accidents enter the atmosphere and are carried over vast
distances]{.underline} by prevailing wind patterns \[28, 53\]. [These
**airborne contami- nants** eventually deposit onto the Arctic
surface]{.underline} through precipitation or dry deposi- tion \[5\].
Ocean currents play a crucial role in distributing radioactive
substances within the marine environment \[22\]. The complex system of
Arctic and sub-Arctic currents, including the North Atlantic Drift and
the Transpolar Drift, facilitates the widespread dispersal of
radionuclides, enabling them to travel from their points of origin to
remote areas of the Arctic Ocean \[50\]. Ice dynamics also significantly
influence the spread of radioactive contamination. Sea ice can entrap
radionuclides during its formation and subsequently transport them
across the Arctic as the ice drifts \[45\]. When the ice melts, the
radionuclides are released into the marine envi- ronment, potentially
contaminating different regions. Riverine input is another criti- cal
mechanism, as rivers like the Ob, Yenisei, and Mackenzie drain large
catchment areas that can carry contaminants from terrestrial sources,
including industrial dis- charges and runoff from contaminated soils,
into the Arctic Ocean \[10\]. Figure 12.1 shows the dispersion of
radionuclear contamination in Arctic water bodies in the years 2015,
2050, and 2100, assuming that the influx of pollutants into Arctic
waters remains at the same amount as in 2015, with an annual variation
of 5% following a normal distribution. These combined mechanisms
underscore the complexity of radioactive contamination spread in the
Arctic, necessitating a multifaceted approach to monitoring and
mitigating its impacts on the marine environment and its dependent
ecosystems.

12.4 Key Radioactive Isotopes in the Arctic

Key radioactive isotopes in the Arctic include cesium-137, iodine-131,
strontium- 90, various plutonium isotopes, and radionuclides from
natural sources. Cesium-137 is a significant contaminant due to its long
half-life of approximately 30 years, mak- ing it persistent in the
environment \[1\]. It is highly soluble in water and bioaccumu- lates in
marine and terrestrial ecosystems, posing long-term ecological and
health risks. Iodine-131, although having a much shorter half-life of
around 8 days, is noteworthy for its high radiotoxicity and rapid uptake
by the thyroid gland, leading to acute exposure risks following nuclear
accidents \[3, 14\]. Strontium-90, with a half-life of about 29 years,
mimics calcium and thus tends to accumulate in bone tissue, increasing
the risk of bone cancer and leukemia \[18\]. Plutonium isotopes,
including plutonium-239 and plutonium-240, are introduced primarily
through nuclear weapons testing and nuclear fuel reprocessing \[15,
17\]. These isotopes are highly radiotoxic, with half-lives extending
thousands of years, and pose significant health hazards due to their
potential for internal exposure via inhalation or inges- tion.
Additionally, natural radionuclides such as uranium-238, thorium-232,
and their decay products are present in the Arctic environment \[49\].
Although typically at lower concentrations, these natural sources
contribute to the overall radioactive burden. Understanding the
distribution, behavior, and impacts of these key isotopes is crucial for
assessing the environmental and health implications of radioactive
contamination in the Arctic.

12.5 Impacts of Radioactive Contaminants on Arctic Flora and Fauna

[Th**e impact of radioactive contamination on Arctic flora and fauna is
profound,** driven largely by the bioaccumulation of radionuclides
within the food web.]{.underline} [Bioaccumulation refers to the
progressive concentration]{.underline} of radioactive substances as they
move up the trophic levels, beginning with microorganisms and plankton
and extending to higher predators like fish, seals, and polar bears
\[30, 38\]. [**This process poses severe risks to marine organisms**,
where radionuclides]{.underline} such as cesium-137 and strontium-90
[can interfere with physiological processes, leading to genetic
mutations]{.underline}, reproductive impairments, and increased
mortality rates \[42, 46\]. For instance, studies on Arctic fish have
shown elevated levels of cesium-137, which can result in diminished
growth rates and altered behavior, affecting their survival and
reproduction. Terrestrial organisms are similarly affected, with
radionuclides accumulating in vegetation that is subsequently consumed
by herbivores like rein- deer. [These herbivores then pass the
contaminants up the food chain to predators, including indigenous human
populations. **The impact on terrestrial fauna** includes compromised
immune systems, higher incidence of cancers, and other health disor-
ders]{.underline} \[19\]. Specific case studies, such as the
contamination of lichens---a crucial winter food source for
reindeer---highlight the cascading effects of radioactive con-
tamination. Reindeer herds, essential to the livelihoods of Arctic
indigenous com- munities, exhibit high levels of radioisotopes, leading
to health risks for both the animals and the humans who depend on them.
These case studies underscore the intricate and far-reaching
consequences of radioactive contamination, necessitating ongoing
monitoring and intervention to protect Arctic ecosystems and the species
that inhabit them.

[SMRs]{.underline} can also [pose **ecological** and **human health
risks** in]{.underline} northern or [arctic regions since]{.underline}
the [environmental guidelines]{.underline} for Canadian nuclear
facilities ar[e mostly based on]{.underline} designs that apply to
[temperate climate regions]{.underline} (Rowan 2020). For instance, a
significant portion of [SMR-generated heat is dissipated to the
environment. SMRs must be]{.underline} located [more than 1 km away from
communities and cannot contribute to district heating]{.underline}.
Efforts are underway by the Standards Council of Canada (SCC) to develop
and promote climate-resilient standards for northern infrastructure
design, management and operation (Standards Council of Canada 2023).
Although the IAEA offers some data and parameters for northern regions
(Armand et al. 2021), the presented information is not sufficient to
design and employ SMRs in northern regions. [Experimental data are
needed to verify and validate numerical models simulating SMR behavior
in northern environments]{.underline}. Additionally, [SMRs using
unconventional fuel and coolant mixtures]{.underline} may [generate
**poorly-understood emissions and waste**]{.underline}. Uranium-fueled
SMRs produce familiar byproducts, but [gas-cooled, molten salt,
sodium-cooled, and lead-cooled SMRs]{.underline} could [yield different
activation products]{.underline}, some of [which may be highly mobile in
the environment or accumulate in the food chain]{.underline}. Addressing
these concerns requires specific guidelines considering northern

• Environmental radiation risks: [Light-water SMRs follow the same
nuclear fuel cycle as existing water-cooled]{.underline} nuclear
[reactors]{.underline} (front-end steps that prepare uranium for use in
nuclear reactors and back-end steps to safely manage, prepare, and
dispose of used but still highly radioactive fuel).18 [This]{.underline}
nuclear fuel cycle (Figure 1) [has associated **environmental radiation
risks** resulting from released contaminants]{.underline}.19 [This poses
hazards for both public and worker health]{.underline}.

NUCLEAR FUEL CYCLE

[Worker-related concerns include]{.underline} internal and external
[**radiation exposure** during]{.underline} primary component
[maintenance]{.underline} during operations and power outages, [steam
generator surveillance and repair, spent fuel pool work activities,
refueling operations, waste processing operations, component
decontamination, and spill cleanup]{.underline}.

Public radiation risks depend on implementing appropriate emergency
planning zones (EPZs), within which measures are taken to protect people
from radiation exposure. Currently the NRC defines two EPZs around each
nuclear power plant. The first is a plume exposure pathway extending
about 10 miles in radius around the reactor site. Protective action
plans within this area are designed to avoid or reduce dose from
potential exposures such as inhaling radioactive waste. The second is an
ingestion exposure pathway extending about 50 miles in radius around the
reactor site. Protective action plans for this area are designed to
avoid or reduce dose from eating or drinking radioactive materials.

Designing appropriate methodology for SMR EPZs is an essential element
of practical emergency preparedness and response. Some SMR plant
developers claim that SMR designs have advanced safety features and
should have a reduced EPZ size.20 NuScale, for example, is seeking an
EPZ that ends at the site security fence, arguing that the change
provides the same level of protection to the public as a 10- mile
radius.21 The NRC's Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards recently
approved NuScale's methodology to calculate the EPZ.22 This will have
major implications for future SMR license applications.

• Nuclear waste management and disposal: A 2022 study led by researchers
at Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation showed
that [SMRs **exacerbate the challenges of** nuclear **waste management
and disposal**]{.underline} and that [most SMR designs will increase the
volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal by a factor
of 2 to 30 compared with traditional reactors]{.underline} in the case
study.23 Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory also recently
published a study to evaluate the nuclear waste attributed to SMRs
scheduled for deployment within this decade compared with waste from a
reference large pressurized water reactor (PWR). The result showed that
[the volume of nuclear waste from SMRs is roughly comparable
to]{.underline} that from [conventional PWRs]{.underline}.24 These
studies indicate that [managing and disposing of SMR nuclear waste is a
**critical safety matter**]{.underline}, as some of the waste products
remain radioactive for a long time.

• Nuclear proliferation risks: The most substantial hurdle to achieving
new nuclear weapons capability for a state or subnational organization
is access to nuclear material---or access to highly enriched uranium or
plutonium. Nuclear proliferation risks for any future deployment of SMRs
will depend on how the SMR systems integrate safety, physical security,
safeguards, and material control and accounting into their designs.
Non-light-water reactor SMR designs, or designs that incorporate
high-assay low-enriched uranium, substantially increase the
environmental harm and nuclear weapons proliferation risk from nuclear
energy.25

CONCLUSION

[Proponents of SMRs claim]{.underline} that [SMR **tech**nology will
safely deliver competitive electricity generation]{.underline} through a
combination of passive safety, modularization, and smaller plant size.
They also argue that it is possible to offset economies of scale
achieved by large nuclear plants with economy of multiples. However,
there is no history of the nuclear industry realizing those claims. SMRs
could receive financial support as part of the IRA, but even with those
subsidies, [SMRs can't reasonably compete in the electricity market
against cheaper and proven renewable energy technologies]{.underline}.
For SMRs to play any role in the future, [the technology must
address]{.underline} the following challenges: [cost, environmental
radiation, nuclear waste, and nuclear weapons
proliferation]{.underline}. Absent meeting these challenges, the
technology is unlikely to succeed.

Modular Reactors\", Equation,

Even casual followers of energy and climate issues have probably heard
about the alleged wonders of [small modular nuclear reactors
(SMRs)]{.underline}. This is due in no small part to the "nuclear bros":
an active and seemingly tireless group of nuclear power advocates who
dominate social media discussions on energy by promoting SMRs and other
"advanced" nuclear technologies as the only real solution for the
climate crisis. But as I showed in my 2013 and 2021 reports, the hype
surrounding [SMRs is way overblown]{.underline}, and my conclusions
remain valid today. Unfortunately, much of this [SMR happy talk is
rooted in misinformation]{.underline}, which always brings me back to
the same question: If the nuclear bros have such a great SMR story to
tell, why do they have to exaggerate so much? What are SMRs? SMRs are
nuclear reactors that are "small" (defined as 300 megawatts of
electrical power or less), can be largely assembled in a centralized
facility, and would be installed in a modular fashion at power
generation sites. Some proposed SMRs are so tiny (20 megawatts or less)
that they are called "micro" reactors. SMRs are distinct from today's
conventional nuclear plants, which are typically around 1,000 megawatts
and were largely custom-built. Some SMR designs, such as NuScale, are
modified versions of operating water-cooled reactors, while others are
radically different designs that use coolants other than water, such as
liquid sodium, helium gas, or even molten salts. To date, however,
theoretical interest in SMRs has not translated into many actual reactor
orders. [The only]{.underline} [SMR currently under construction is in
China]{.underline}. And in the United States, only one
company---TerraPower, founded by Microsoft's Bill Gates---has applied to
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a permit to build a power
reactor (but at 345 megawatts, it technically isn't even an SMR). The
nuclear industry has pinned its hopes on SMRs primarily because some
recent large reactor projects, including Vogtle units 3 and 4 in the
state of Georgia, have taken far longer to build and cost far more than
originally projected. The failure of these projects to come in on time
and under budget undermines arguments that modern nuclear power plants
can overcome the problems that have plagued the nuclear industry in the
past. Developers in the industry and the US Department of Energy say
that SMRs can be less costly and quicker to build than large reactors
and that their modular nature makes it easier to balance power supply
and demand. They also argue that reactors in a variety of sizes would be
useful for a range of applications beyond grid-scale electrical power,
including providing process heat to industrial plants and power to data
centers, cryptocurrency mining operations, petrochemical production, and
even electrical vehicle charging stations. Here are five facts about
SMRs that the nuclear industry and the "nuclear bros" who push its
message don't want you, the public, to know. 1. SMRs are not more
economical than large reactors. In theory, small reactors should have
lower capital costs and construction times than large reactors of
similar design so that utilities (or other users) can get financing more
cheaply and deploy them more flexibly. But that doesn't mean small
reactors will be more economical than large ones. In fact, the opposite
usually will be true. What matters more when comparing the economics of
different power sources is the cost to produce a kilowatt-hour of
electricity, and that depends on the capital cost per kilowatt of
generating capacity, as well as the costs of operations, maintenance,
fuel, and other factors. According to the economies of scale principle,
smaller reactors will in general produce more expensive electricity than
larger ones. For example, the now-cancelled project by NuScale to build
a 460-megawatt, 6-unit SMR in Idaho was estimated to cost over \$20,000
per kilowatt, which is greater than the actual cost of the Vogtle large
reactor project of over \$15,000 per kilowatt. This cost penalty can be
offset only by radical changes in the way reactors are designed, built,
and operated. For example, SMR developers claim they can slash capital
cost per kilowatt by achieving efficiency through the mass production of
identical units in factories. However, studies find that such cost
reductions typically would not exceed about 30%. In addition, dozens of
units would have to be produced before manufacturers could learn how to
make their processes more efficient and achieve those capital cost
reductions, meaning that the first reactors of a given design will be
unavoidably expensive and will require large government or ratepayer
subsidies to get built. Getting past this obstacle has proven to be one
of the main impediments to SMR deployment. Another way that SMR
developers try to reduce capital cost is by reducing or eliminating many
of the safety features required for operating reactors that provide
multiple layers of protection, such as a robust, reinforced concrete
containment structure, motor-driven emergency pumps, and rigorous
quality assurance standards for backup safety equipment such as power
supplies. But these changes so far haven't had much of an impact on the
overall cost---just look at NuScale. In addition to capital cost,
operation and maintenance (O&M) costs will also have to be significantly
reduced to improve the competitiveness of SMRs. However, some operating
expenses, such as the security needed to protect against terrorist
attacks, would not normally be sensitive to reactor size. The relative
contribution of O&M and fuel costs to the price per megawatt-hour varies
a lot among designs and project details, but could be 50% or more,
depending on factors such as interest rates that influence the total
capital cost. Economies of scale considerations have already led some
SMR vendors, such as NuScale and Holtec, to roughly double module sizes
from their original designs. The Oklo, Inc. Aurora microreactor has
increased from 1.5 MW to 15 MW and may even go to 50 MW. And the General
Electric-Hitachi BWRX-300 and Westinghouse AP300 are both starting out
at the upper limit of what is considered an SMR. Overall, these changes
might be sufficient to make some SMRs cost-competitive with large
reactors, but they would still have a long way to go to compete with
renewable technologies. The levelized cost of electricity for the
now-cancelled NuScale project was estimated at around \$119 per
megawatt-hour (without federal subsidies), whereas land-based wind and
utility-scale solar now cost below \$40/MWh. Microreactors, however, are
likely to remain expensive under any realistic scenario, with projected
levelized electricity costs two to three times that of larger SMRs. 2.
[SMRs are not generally safer or more secure]{.underline} than large
light-water reactors. Because of their size, [you might think that small
nuclear reactors pose lower risks to public health]{.underline} and the
environment than large reactors. After all, the amount of radioactive
material in the core and available to be released in an accident is
smaller. And smaller reactors produce heat at lower rates than large
reactors, which could make them easier to cool during an accident,
perhaps even by passive means---that is, without the need for
electrically powered coolant pumps or operator actions. [However, the
so-called passive safety features that SMR proponents like to cite may
not always work, especially during extreme events]{.underline} such as
large earthquakes, major flooding, or wildfires that can degrade the
environmental conditions under which they are designed to operate. And
in some cases[, passive features can actually make accidents
worse]{.underline}: for example, the NRC's review of the NuScale design
revealed that passive emergency systems could deplete cooling water of
boron, which is needed to keep the reactor safely shut down after an
accident. In any event, [regulators are loosening safety and security
requirements for SMRs]{.underline} in ways which could cancel out any
safety benefits from passive features. For example, the NRC has approved
rules and procedures in recent years that provide regulatory pathways
for exempting new reactors, including SMRs, from many of the protective
measures that it requires for operating plants, such as a physical
containment structure, an offsite emergency evacuation plan, and an
exclusion zone that separates the plant from densely populated areas. It
is also considering further changes that could allow SMRs to reduce the
numbers of armed security personnel to protect them from terrorist
attacks and highly trained operators to run them. Reducing security at
SMRs is particularly worrisome, because even the safest reactors could
effectively become dangerous radiological weapons if they are sabotaged
by skilled attackers. Even passive safety mechanisms could be
deliberately disabled. Considering the cumulative impact of all these
changes[, SMRs could be as---or even more--- dangerous than large
reactors]{.underline}. For example, [if a containment structure at a
large reactor reliably prevented 90% of the radioactive material from
being released from the core of the reactor during a meltdown, then a
reactor 5 times smaller without such a containment structure could
conceivably release more radioactive material into the
environment]{.underline}, even though the total amount of material in
the core would be smaller. And if the SMR were located closer to
populated areas with no offsite emergency planning, [more people could
be exposed to dangerously high levels of radiation.]{.underline} But
even if one could show that the overall safety risk of a small reactor
was lower than that of a large reactor, [that still wouldn't
automatically imply the overall risk per unit of electricity that it
generates]{.underline} is lower, since smaller plants generate less
electricity. If an accident caused a 250-megawatt SMR to release only
25% of the radioactive material that a 1,000-megawatt plant would
release, the ratio of risk to benefit would be the same. And a site with
four such reactors could have four times the annual risk of a single
unit, or an even greater risk if an accident at one reactor were to
damage the others, [as happened during the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi
accident in Japan.]{.underline} 3. [SMRs will not reduce the problem of
what to do with radioactive waste]{.underline}. The industry makes
highly misleading claims that certain SMRs will reduce the intractable
problem of long-lived radioactive waste management by generating less
waste, or even by "recycling" their own wastes or those generated by
other reactors. First, it's necessary to define what "less" waste really
means. In terms of the quantity of highly radioactive isotopes that
result when atomic nuclei are fissioned and release energy, [small
reactors will produce just as much as large reactors per unit of heat
generated.]{.underline} (Non-light-water reactors that more efficiently
convert heat to electricity than light-water reactors will produce
somewhat smaller quantities of fission products per unit of electricity
generated---perhaps 10 to 30%---but this is a relatively small effect in
the scheme of things.) And for reactors with denser fuels, the [volume
and mass of the spent fuel generated may be smaller, but the
concentration of fission products in the spent fuel, and the heat
generated by the decay products---factors that really matter to
safety---will be proportionately greater]{.underline}. Therefore,
entities that hope to acquire SMRs, like data centers that lack the
necessary waste infrastructure, will have to safely manage the storage
of significant quantities of spent nuclear fuel on site for the long
term, just like any other nuclear power plant does. Claims by vendors
such as Westinghouse that they will take away the reactors after the
fuel is no longer usable are simply not credible, as there are no
realistic prospects for licensing centralized sites where the used
reactors could be taken for the foreseeable future. Any community with
an SMR will have to plan to be a de facto long-term nuclear waste
disposal site. 4. SMRs cannot be counted on to provide reliable and
resilient off-the-grid power for facilities, such as data centers,
bitcoin mining, hydrogen or petrochemical production. Despite the claims
of developers[, it is]{.underline} [very unlikely that any reasonably
foreseeable SMR design would be able to safely operate without reliable
access to electricity from the grid to power coolant pumps and other
vital safety system]{.underline}s. Just like today's nuclear plants,
SMRs will be vulnerable to extreme weather events or other disasters
that could cause a loss of offsite power and force them to shut down. In
such situations a user such as a data center operator would have to
provide backup power, likely from diesel generators, for both the data
center AND the reactor. And since there is virtually no experience with
operating SMRs worldwide, it is highly doubtful that the novel designs
being pitched now would be highly reliable right out of the box and
require little monitoring and maintenance. It very likely will take
decades of operating experience for any new reactor design to achieve
the level of reliability characteristic of the operating light-water
reactor fleet. Premature deployment based on unrealistic performance
expectations could prove extremely costly for any company that wants to
experiment with SMRs. 5. SMRs do not use fuel more efficiently than
large reactors. Some advocates misleadingly claim that SMRs are more
efficient than large ones because they use less fuel. In terms of the
amount of heat generated, the amount of uranium fuel that must undergo
nuclear fission is the same whether a reactor is large or small. And
although reactors that use coolants other than water typically operate
at higher temperatures, which can increase the efficiency of conversion
of heat to electricity, this is not a big enough effect to outweigh
other factors that decrease efficiency of fuel use. Some SMRs designs
require a type of uranium fuel called "high-assay low enriched uranium
(HALEU)," which contains higher concentrations of the isotope
uranium-235 than conventional light-water reactor fuel. Although this
reduces the total mass of fuel the reactor needs, that doesn't mean it
uses less uranium nor results in less waste from "front-end" mining and
milling activities: in fact, the opposite is more likely to be true. One
reason for this is that HALEU production requires a relatively large
amount of natural uranium to be fed into the enrichment process that
increases the uranium-235 concentration. For example, the TerraPower
Natrium reactor which would use HALEU enriched to around 19%
uranium-235, will require 2.5 to 3 times as much natural uranium to
produce a kilowatt-hour of electricity than a light-water reactor.
Smaller reactors, such as the 15-megawatt Oklo Aurora, are even more
inefficient. Improving the efficiency of these reactors can occur only
with significant advances in fuel performance, which could take decades
of development to achieve. Reactors that use uranium inefficiently have
disproportionate impacts on the environment from polluting uranium
mining and processing activities. They also are less effective in
mitigating carbon emissions, because uranium mining and milling are
relatively carbon-intensive activities compared to other parts of the
uranium fuel cycle. SMRs may have a role to play in our energy future,
but only if they are sufficiently safe and secure. For that to happen,
it is essential to have a realistic understanding of their costs and
risks. By painting an overly rosy picture of these technologies with
often misleading information, the nuclear bros are distracting attention
from [the need to confront the many challenges that must be resolved to
make SMRs a reality---and ultimately doing a disservice to their
cause.]{.underline}

[A changing Arctic Ocean has effects far beyond the waters in question.
The Arctic is]{.underline} part of the global ocean and climate systems
and is [**increasingly con**nected to global society]{.underline} as
well. Many who had never given the Arctic a second thought are now
affected in ways large and small by what is taking place in the North.
Over 200 years ago, the British naval captain Edward Parry (quoted in
O'Brian 1997) noted that [a change in sea ice near Greenland affected
the quality of whale oil and led to crop failures]{.underline} and
colder summers [far to the south]{.underline}. Similar connections can
be seen today.

[Mid-latitude weather in the Northern Hemisphere has been **widely
affected** as Arctic sea ice loss has changed]{.underline} the patterns
of [the jet stream]{.underline} (Francis and Vavrus 2015; Ge et al.
2020; Zou et al. 2020). [This]{.underline} effect has [produced cold
winters in North America and East Asia]{.underline} (Kug et al. 2015).
[Such teleconnections]{.underline} (Mao et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2019)
[are among the reasons]{.underline} that [China considers itself
a]{.underline} ''[near Arctic state]{.underline}.'' [Changes
in]{.underline} the movements of [water masses in the North Atlantic,
driven]{.underline} in part by [warmer Arctic waters]{.underline}, may

et al. 2021). An understanding of such meteorological connections is
essential for accurate weather prediction and for long-term planning and
preparation for extreme weather events.

Climatologically, [loss of Arctic sea ice **amplifies global warming**
by allowing more solar energy to be retained instead of
reflected]{.underline} (McGuire et al. 2006). Thus, [the effects of sea
ice loss **amplify the effects of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide

[Climate change poses a significant threat to the Arctic
ecology]{.underline}. The [Arctic is experiencing a warming rate that is
more than twice as rapid as the global average]{.underline}, resulting
in [substantial decreases in the thickness and extent of sea
ice]{.underline}. According to Richter-Menge et al. \[130\], this
phenomenon is [referred to as Arctic amplification]{.underline}.
[Species]{.underline} that depend on ice for reproduction, feeding, and
protection are [at risk due to the loss of ice habitat]{.underline}
\[94\]. Furthermore, [as a result of climate change]{.underline},
[habitats and migration patterns are changing]{.underline}, [affecting
indigenous populations]{.underline} as well as regional economies that
rely on hunting, fishing, and tourism \[118\]. These warming
temperatures and changing ice conditions have the potential to
[impact]{.underline} not only the timing and distribution of primary
production but also [the reproductive cycles of Arctic species and food
webs]{.underline} \[126\].

The [Arctic is very susceptible to pollution]{.underline} from both
nearby and remote sources, making pollution a significant concern in the
region. [Plastic debris, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), and heavy
metals]{.underline} may [accumulate in the frigid, slow degrading
environment]{.underline}. By entering the Arctic through riverine
intake, atmospheric deposition, and ocean currents, these pollutants
[potentially endanger human populations and species that depend on
marine resources]{.underline}. For example, Lee \[98\] reports on the
impact of toxic elements and POPs on avian influenzas prevalence in
Arctic seabirds.

The [increased availability of resources]{.underline} (such as oil, gas,
and minerals) that were previously inaccessible as a result of melting
ice is generating commercial interest; however, it is also [causing
environmental damage and disturbing local population]{.underline}s
\[91\]. Concerns have been raised over the possible impacts that [human
activities, such as shipping, oil and gas exploration, and commercial
fishing]{.underline}, may have on the Arctic marine ecosystem. These
activities have the [potential to cause habitat]{.underline} 3 Arctic
Marine Ecosystems 48 [disruption]{.underline}, pollution,
[and]{.underline} overfishing that could have [negative consequences for
the marine environment]{.underline}. Kershaw et al. \[83\] reported the
declining reproductive success in humpback whales (Megaptera
novaeangliae) reflected by ecosystem shifts on their feeding ground.
Specifically, the emergence of [new shipping routes as a result of ice
melting raises the likelihood of oil spills and other accidents, which
can cause devastating damage to the delicate Arctic
environment]{.underline} \[56\]. Moreover, the [geopolitical tensions
arising from conficting territorial claims and interests between Arctic

data31 has **decreased** from 49 to 31%. This reduction affects **sea
ice dynamics**, in particular through decreases in ice **mechanical**
**strength** and internal ice interaction forces, and increases in ice
**deformation** rates32]{.underline}. These outcomes in turn increase
the momentum flux from the atmosphere to the ocean33, 34, and strengthen
anticyclonic circulation in the Beaufort Gyre with a steepening sea
surface height anomaly after the early 2000s35. [As a result of such
changes, ice **drift** **speed** has significantly **increased36**, 37,
likely responsible for the increase in early summer Div from 1.9 to 3.7%
mo]{.underline}−1. Although the direct contribution of the increased
divergence to reductions in ice concentration is quite small,
[**accumulated heat absorption** by the upper ocean through the end of
August has gradually increased through **ice-ocean albedo feedback**,
with an increase by a **factor** of up to **1.5**]{.underline} (from 153
MJ m−2 to 230 MJ m−2[). This increased heat uptake can explain about
**70%** of the observed **2.1-fold** increase in total sea ice
**melt**]{.underline} (from 121 MJ m−2 to 257 MJ m−2). This contrast in
the increase in annual ice melt compared to heat input is also evident
in Fig. 2d, and is partly explained by the continuing decline in mean
ice thickness4, 5.

[Other factors]{.underline} such as changes in atmospheric circulation
patterns38, influence of cloud cover39, 40, longwave radiative forcing
due to anthropogenic CO2 emission41, melt pond distribution in the early
summer season42, release of the solar heat stored in a near-surface
layer of the ocean43, and increases in the heat inflow through Bering
Strait44 may also contribute to drastic ice reductions. However, we note
that these factors [are **intrinsically** **linked** to divergence in
the ice pack, because increased **heat** **input** from any source may
enhance sea ice **mobility**]{.underline}. Thus, [this study
provides]{.underline} a new perspective on the observed drastic ice
reduction in demonstrating, [through **modeling** and **analysis** of
remote sensing data, that ice **divergence** in the early melt season is
a key trigger for **amplification of ice retreat** through ice-ocean
**albedo** feedback.]{.underline} This finding also suggests that
early-season ice divergence is associated with a substantial skill for
seasonal ice prediction. A detailed analysis for the impact of
individual processes on sea ice retreat at the local scale is beyond the
scope of this study. Future work will require comprehensive analysis of
output from fully coupled climate models along with time series of
relevant sea ice quantities.

#### Albedo feedbacks are caused by atmospheric carbon

**\*\*AA = Arctic Amplification, GST = global surface temperature, AST =
Arctic surface temperature\*\***

4 Conclusion and Discussion

To understand [how **surface albedo**, surface temperature, and CO2
influence the seasonal **variation in** **AA**, we use a coupled climate
model with **simulations** that elucidate these forcing
effects.]{.underline} The results show that the [seasonal variation in
AA is mainly a result of local forcing and **feedbacks** in the Arctic.
A **decrease** in surface albedo can largely **enhance solar radiation**
absorption in the Arctic. This phenomenon should be viewed as the **real
heat source** for amplified Arctic warming. Moreover, CO2 **prevents**
heat from **escaping** the Earth and enhances surface temperatures,
especially at **low latitudes**.]{.underline} The Planck feedback is a
good indicator for the magnitude of AA.

In this study, we discuss the seasonal variation in AA to a greater
extent in several ways.

First, although polar warming and sea-ice loss in recent centuries were
initiated by increased CO2 forcing, polar ocean warmed up under many
conditions (i.e., the Milankovitch theory, Berger, 1988; He
et al., 2013; Sigman & Boyle, 2000). So, we discuss the influence of
surface albedo and increased CO2 individually in this study. To separate
the influence of surface albedo from increased CO2 forcing, global
warming is produced by artificially decreasing the albedo of the
ice-covered ocean. In this way, both surface albedo and solar radiation
absorption over the polar ocean remain nearly unchanged even with larger
sea-ice loss. Thus, when increased CO2 forcing is applied in the surface
albedo perturbation experiment, new variation should be contribution
from the direct (radiative) impact of CO2 forcing. As a result, we
separate the influences of surface albedo and CO2 forcing to AA
successfully.

Second, all the sensitivity experiments in this study are highly
idealized, which induce stronger polar warming and sea ice loss than
those in the recent observations. Although the Arctic surface albedo can
hardly reach such a small magnitude in the real world and we only employ
the CESM in this study, many features in our polar forcing experiment
(0.1 A) are similar as those in the polar forcing experiment carried out
using other models (ST18). (1) AHT (OHT) is northward (southward)
anomaly south (north) of 40°N (equator) in 0.1 A (Figure S1d), which
shares similar distribution as that in Figure 3 of ST18. (2) Surface
temperature increase is maximum in the Arctic, with the second peak in
the Antarctic, and the minimum is in the subtropic region (Figure 4 in
ST18; our result is not shown though). All the results above confirm the
robustness of the model feature-AA is dominant by local forcing and
feedbacks.

Third, [the **positive feedback** of surface albedo **dominates** the
local forcing and feedbacks throughout the year]{.underline} (at the
surface and TOA[), and the **heat storage** in the subsurface ocean
plays a role in delaying the influence of this positive
feedback.]{.underline} Subsurface ocean heat storage forms in summer and
discharges in autumn and winter. Thus, the pseudo total feedback, which
is the sum of the heat storage and net radiative flux variation, can
well explain the seasonal AST variation and AA, which reaches the
maximum in autumn, has a secondary peak in spring, and attains the
minimum in summer. The direct (radiative) impact of CO2 forcing enhances
the GST variation and decreases the local forcing and feedbacks in
spring, summer, and autumn. [However, with more heat storage discharged
from the subsurface ocean (due to a warming climate) and stronger CO2
forcing, a larger pseudo **total feedback** (positive) is achieved in
**winter**.]{.underline}

When we study the climate change in recent centuries, [the **surface
albedo** feedback becomes an **indirect influence** of increased **CO2
forcing**. As a result, two opposite impacts of increased CO2 forcing on
AA occur: the **direct** (indirect) impact of increased CO2 forcing
reduces (increases) the difference between GST and AST]{.underline}. The
result in Figures S4 and S5 suggests that [the **indirect** impact
dominates the **local forcing** and feedbacks in the
Arctic.]{.underline} Another key factor for the AA is the heat storage
in the subsurface ocean, and how heat storage forms/discharges (through
vertical advection and vertical diffusion) in different seasons will be
reported in future.

### Internal\-\--Arctic Key\-\--Clouds

#### Carbon emissions disrupt critical cloud formation

[**Stratocumulus** clouds]{.underline} may not be the showiest puffs in
the International Cloud Atlas, but they [are the **workhorses** of the
atmosphere. The low, flat decks of clouds---also known as **marine**
**layers**---cover over **20 percent** of subtropical oceans and
**reflect** about **30 percent** of the sun's light, keeping the planet
**much cooler** than it would otherwise be]{.underline}. But [a new
**climate model** suggests that rising **carbon dioxide concentrations**
in the atmosphere could **disrupt** stratocumulus formation, leading to
dramatic rises in Earth's surface temperature, as much as **14 degrees
Fahrenheit.**]{.underline}

Joel Achenbach at The Washington Post reports that [clouds]{.underline}
are an important but frustrating part of climate modeling. Depending on
their location, type and quantity, they can [either trap heat or help
reflect it.]{.underline} Accurately modeling cloud behavior, however,
takes a lot of computing power and the air currents that sustain clouds
are too small to add into global climate models.

That's why researchers decided to simplify things, modeling a
five-by-five kilometer section of cloud above California's subtropical
ocean on a supercomputer. [As they increased the concentration of CO2 in
their models,]{.underline} they saw a surprising effect. At levels over
1,200 parts per million of carbon dioxide[, the stratocumulus clouds
were no longer able to form their **large, flat, reflective
sheets**---instead **breaking** into puffier clouds.]{.underline}
Emiliano Rodriguez Mega at Nature reports that's because [to maintain
their shape, stratocumulus clouds need to continuously radiate heat into
the upper atmosphere. If the air temperature gets too warm, they can no
longer do this and break apart.]{.underline} The paper appears in the
journal Nature Geosciences.

Currently, global CO2 levels are at 410 ppm, up from about 280 ppm
before the start of the Industrial Revolution. While [exceeding 1,200
ppm]{.underline} sounds unlikely, it's [where the atmosphere is
**headed** in]{.underline} about a century at humanity's current pace of
carbon pollution. "I think and hope that technological changes will slow
carbon emissions so that we do not actually reach such high CO2
concentrations," lead author Tapio Schneider of the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory at Caltech says in a press release. "But our results show
that there are dangerous climate change thresholds that we had been
unaware of."

Schneider says the 1,200 ppm [threshold]{.underline} for the cloud
breakup is [just a rough estimate]{.underline}. And because so many
elements of the climate model were simplified in the new model, Matthew
Huber, a palaeoclimatologist at Purdue University, tells Mega at Nature
it's hard to say with certainty how accurate the new cloud model may be.

But the findings are not pie in the cloudless sky."It's not bonkers,"
Andrew Ackerman, a cloud researcher at NASA's Goddard Institute for
Space Studies not involve in the study tells Mega. "The underlying
mechanism is totally plausible."

If the [model]{.underline} holds true, it could [explain]{.underline} a
strange period in Earth's past known as the [Paleocene Eocene Thermal
**Maximum** about 55 million years ago.]{.underline} During that period,
the [world warmed so much that the **Arctic melted** and was even home
to crocodiles.]{.underline} For such a dramatic event to occur, current
climate models say carbon dioxide levels would have to reach 4,000 ppm,
which is about twice the CO2 levels researchers have found in the
geologic record[. However, if rising CO2 led to the **loss of
stratocumulus clouds**, that could explain the unusual **heat spike**.
The ebb and flow of clouds could also help explain other unusual heat
spikes in Earth's climate history.]{.underline}

"Schneider and co-authors have cracked open Pandora's box of potential
climate surprises," Huber tells Natalie Wolchover at Quanta Magazine.
"All of a sudden this enormous sensitivity that is apparent from past
climates isn't something that's just in the past. It becomes a vision of
the future."

Abstract

[The **Arctic clouds** should be an important factor that affects the
**summertime sea ice**. By reflecting the incoming **solar radiation**
before it reaches the surface, the Arctic clouds]{.underline} may
[prevent the **surface** from absorbing tremendous solar radiation due
to the reduced sea ice. This cloud effect will]{.underline} lead to
[**intervene** the **feedback** **relation** between the solar radiation
and the sea ice change]{.underline}. However, few studies have
quantitatively investigated the Arctic cloud effect on the ice- albedo
feedback. [This study found that the Arctic **clouds regulate the
melting speed** of sea ice in midsummer months (June to August) based on
the **data from multiple** **sources**, that is, satellite, reanalysis,
and climate models]{.underline}. During this period, the fraction of
Arctic clouds with the net radiative cooling effect is almost invariable
with sea ice reduction. However, despite of the steady cloud fraction in
the midsummer months, [the shortwave cloud radiative **effect** (total-
sky minus clear-sky absorbed shortwave radiation) was found to
significantly **increase** with the **reduced sea ice**
concentration]{.underline} (0.64 W m−2%−1 in CERES, 0.73 W m−2%−1 in
ERA5). [This is because the clouds present **more contrast of albedo**
with the sea ice-free ocean than the sea ice-covered ocean.]{.underline}
Finally, our analyses show that the [Arctic clouds are nearly
**halving** the strength of the ice- albedo **feedback** in the
midsummer months. These results imply that the sea ice reduction could
have been **much faster** in the past decades in the **absence** of the
cloud effect found here.]{.underline}

[Avoiding the worst effects of climate change requires **rapid
decarbonization** and **improved ecosystem stewardship**. Alaska, with
its **intact ecosystems** and **ecoregions with full rosters of native
species**]{.underline}---[many with relatively healthy
populations]{.underline}---[provides a **globally exceptional
opportunity for protecting biodiversity**]{.underline} in a context
linked to natural climate solutions. [As climate warms, intact systems
will become more valuable as they]{.underline} have greater potential to
[provide **superior resilience to climate change** and]{.underline} will
help [buffer against frequent **droughts** and other disturbance
events]{.underline}. Analysis of vegetation cover data for Alaska shows
that significant changes are occurring, with implications for both the
biodiversity and carbon storage potential of the nation. [Natural
climate solutions offer win-win solutions to]{.underline} the linked
crises of [**biod**iversity **loss**, accompanying **cultural and
traditional losses**, and **climate change**. Managing lands for climate
stabilization, adaptation, and resilience provides an opportunity to
**prevent degradation of ecosystems** and]{.underline} to [**increase
the ability of ecosystems to remove CO2** from the atmosphere. Because
Alaska is]{.underline} also [**globally significant** for its large
contribution to carbon storage, incentivizing land management to
conserve and enhance]{.underline} this [storage presents a significant
opportunity for the **U**nited **S**tates to lead]{.underline} in
natural climate solutions.

Quantification of the near-term contribution of various land management
scenarios to climate emissions reduction and to long-term climate
stabilization in Alaska is difficult due to significant data gaps. In
2018, researchers identified and analyzed 21 natural climate solutions
in the contiguous United States and found that combined they could
reduce global warming emissions by an amount equivalent to nearly 21% of
United States net emissions in 2016 (Fargione et al., 2018). No such
study has been performed for Alaska, which accounts for 19.3% of the
United States land mass (US Census Bureau, 2012). [Given the size and
importance of Alaska's lands and waters and the magnitude of its
accumulated carbon stores and]{.underline} potential [climate
stabilization services over time]{.underline}, however, it is clear that
[Alaska **must play a prominent role in any**]{.underline}
knowledge-based, [**U**nited **S**tates **climate stabilization
strategy**]{.underline}.

#### Alaskan biodiversity is [unique]{.underline}\-\--its both [more intact]{.underline} than other ecosystems and [more integral]{.underline} to global resilience.

[Alaska is globally significant for its **large tracts of intact
habitats** and their role in **conserving biod**iversity and **storing
carbon**]{.underline} while supporting traditional and cultural uses
(Kofinas et al., 2010; Reynolds et al., 2018; Dinerstein et al., 2020).
[Alaska holds one third of **U**nited **S**tates federal lands, the bulk
of the United States' intact and wild lands, and 62 percent of the
country's terrestrial ecosystem carbon stocks on federal
lands]{.underline} (Merrill et al., 2018). The Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA) established twelve (later thirteen)
Alaska Native regional corporations and over 200 local village
corporations, representing a total of 44 million acres (17,806 km2) of
land (Figure 1). Alaska is home to 229 federally recognized tribes and
it is the United States state with the highest proportion of American
Indian and Alaska Native people1. Alaska has \>30% of the United States
coastline2 and 63% of the nation's wetlands (Hall et al., 1994). Most of
Alaska far exceeds landscape condition values of even the most protected
places in the contiguous United States (Reynolds et al., 2018; Figure
2). [The intactness of Alaska's systems as part of a national climate
change mitigation strategy has been underexplored]{.underline} in both
science and public policy.

\[FIGURE 1 & 2 OMITTED\]

In discussing the role of Alaska's intact systems in fostering
biodiversity and storing carbon, it is important to recognize that [the
region is already experiencing and will continue to experience climatic
changes that]{.underline} will [influence carbon sequestration and
storage capacity]{.underline} across landscapes. While physically
Alaska's landscapes are largely undeveloped (Figure 3), the region is
changing quickly. Presently, [climate change is the biggest driver of
change for Alaska's ecosystems, species, and people]{.underline}, and
this has been well documented (Stone et al., 2002; Chapin et al., 2004;
Hinzman et al., 2005; Brubaker et al., 2011). Likewise, cultural and
economic climate change impacts across Alaska have been reviewed
elsewhere (e.g., Hinzman et al., 2005; Wolken et al., 2011; Cochran et
al., 2013; Berman and Schmidt, 2019). With reference to these previous
reviews, this analysis focuses on carbon dynamics and ecosystem
integrity.

\[FIGURE 3 OMITTED\]

[Due to the geographic size and spatial extent of Alaska's landscapes,
along with the **relative intactness of many of its ecological
systems**]{.underline}, recent reviews suggest that [Alaska could
contribute **over 50% of total carbon storage for the entire U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} (Zhu and McGuire, 2016). [Northern permafrost
soils contain almost two times the amount of stored carbon as that found
within the atmosphere]{.underline}. However, soil carbon concentrations
will change with the melting of permafrost (Hugelius et al., 2014; Jones
et al., 2017). The [decomposition of permafrost carbon could
**accelerate climate warming** through the loss of stored carbon, and
**methane releases** have been widely documented from warming
lakes]{.underline} (Jorgenson et al., 2001). The interaction of marine
and terrestrial systems across seasonal variations makes predicting
changes to total carbon storage challenging (Parmentier et al., 2017).
Likewise, as will be discussed, the effects of climate change on the
frequency and intensity of wildfires add complexity to issues of carbon
balance. Here we focus on the role that Alaska's intact systems and
species might play in maintaining biodiversity, storing carbon, and
mitigating climate change -- even as climate change continues to affect
those systems.

[Global climate targets have been established]{.underline} in order [to
prevent the worst effects of climate change, including **disruption to
weather** patterns, **extreme heat and flood** events, **water and food
shortages**, and **loss of biod**iversity and **essential ecosystem
services**]{.underline} (IPCC, 2018). [Naturally functioning ecosystems
are critical for **mitigating** greenhouse gas **emissions** and
**meeting global climate targets** via]{.underline} both [protecting
existing carbon stocks and new sequestration]{.underline} (Griscom et
al., 2017; Teske, 2019). These natural-climate solutions (NCS) include
proforestation (allowing forests to continue to grow), which is the most
rapid means to accumulate additional carbon in forests and out of the
atmosphere (Law et al., 2018; Moomaw et al., 2019). Other
strategies---including conservation and restoration that increase carbon
storage and/or reduce greenhouse gas emissions---are increasingly
recognized as essential to meeting global climate targets (Griscom et
al., 2017; Seddon et al., 2020). Nearly all pathways to staying below
2°C rise in average global temperature require preventing conversion of
the vast majority of Earth's remaining, terrestrial habitats (Teske,
2019). Significantly, much of the land essential to achieving carbon
storage objectives is also essential for protecting biodiversity
(Dinerstein et al., 2019, 2020; Buotte et al., 2020).

[Protection of intact and low human-impact forests is one of the most
cost-effective ways to mitigate climate change]{.underline}. Globally,
[forests store]{.underline} 662 Gt C, or [75% of the amount currently in
the atmosphere]{.underline} (Food and Agricultural Organization, 2020),
[and terrestrial ecosystems]{.underline} (primarily forests) [annually
remove 30% of excess carbon emitted by human activities]{.underline}. A
large portion of this carbon is found in the globally important forest
and wetland areas of the tropics and boreal region (Bradshaw and
Warkentin, 2015). [Protection of intact ecosystems from industrial land
uses is]{.underline} particularly [important since **carbon storage
values are diminished as natural areas are degraded or
converted**]{.underline} (Grünzweig et al., 2004; Martin and Watson,
2016).

Though the impacts to Alaska systems from climate change are well
established, there has been little focus on the potential contribution
of Alaska land and water management to climate stabilization (Zhu and
McGuire, 2016). Though [Alaska's marine areas are]{.underline} also
[**extremely significant** for global biodiversity and carbon
budgets]{.underline}, we focus here on terrestrial ecosystems. We
synthesize existing literature and provide expert input to answer three
primary questions: Why is Alaska globally meaningful (for biodiversity
and climate)? Why should Alaska be a key element of a climate
stabilization and biodiversity conservation strategy for the United
States? What do we need to know to better understand the role Alaska
will play in climate stabilization and resilience given projected
changes?

[**The risk of oil spills in the Arctic is increasing** as the loss of
sea ice makes Arctic shipping more feasible]{.underline}. Arctic sea ice
extent in September diminished from 7.05 million of km2 in 1979 to 4.37
million of km2 in 2023 (Fig. 1a), according to the National Snow and Ice
Data Center (htt ps://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/). This prolonged
open-water season, including passage across the Arctic, is anticipated
to increase marine transport due to the cost savings associated with
more efficient shipping routes (Melia et al., 2016). An analysis of
Arctic ship traffic data (www. astd.is) revealed that both distance
sailed and unique ships (all types of ships entering the Polar Code
Area) have significantly increased over the past 10 years, owing to the
extended navigation period and increased demand for transport of fuel
and materials associated with community and industrial growth (Fig. 1b).
[As the increased frequency of marine shipping, industrial, and tourism
activities **increases accidental oil spill risks**, reviewing the level
of awareness on the effects of oil spills, response tactics, and
regulatory practices in the coastal regions of the Arctic and Subarctic
is urgently required]{.underline}.

[For crude oil spills, in addition to the increased risk associated with
changes in the volume of marine traffic, spills can also result from in-
dustrial activities associated with oil exploration/production, crude
oil terminals, transmission pipelines, etc]{.underline}. For example,
the Alaska Depart- ment of Environmental Conservation documented over
1300 crude oil spills from 2000 to 2023 (PPR Spills Database,
https://dec.alaska. gov/applications/spar/publicmvc/perp/spillsearch).
**[Approximately 72 % of crude oil spill incidents were related to
offshore and onshore oil production operations]{.underline}** (Fig. 1c).
Equipment failure, human error, and leak are the top three causes of
Alaska crude oil spills, accounting for more than 43 % of all incidents
(Fig. 1d). Moreover, [non-crude oils such as refined petroleum products
can also be released into the Arctic and Subarctic environment,
generating significantly adverse impacts.]{.underline} Diesel, hydraulic
oil, gasoline, and engine lube/gear oil are the frequently spilled
non-crude substances in Alaska (Fig. 1e).

[Oil spill response operations in Arctic and Subarctic regions are
**considerably more challenging** with the constraints linked to harsh
weather conditions, infrastructure inaccessibility, and remote
locations]{.underline} (API, 2012; National Research Council et al.,
2014). [Therefore, the **spilled oil may eventually be deposited on
shorelines**]{.underline} (Feng et al., 2022; G´ongora et al., 2022),
which [may have **long-term impacts on wildlife and coastal
communities\'** health and socioeconomic conditions]{.underline}. To
improve oil spill response preparedness, particular consideration has
been given to the modification of existing or the development of new
cleanup strategies for some sensitive shorelines (e.g., tundra and peat
shores) and oily snow and ice waste (Owens, 2014). Many countries,
including the United States, Canada, Norway, and Russia, have terri-
tories within the Arctic, and international coordination in these
regions has proven beneficial in numerous instances for ensuring
efficient and effective containment and cleanup efforts to minimize the
impact of oil spills. Thus, international organizations, such as the
Arctic Council and International Maritime Organization, have established
agreements, regulations, and operational guidelines to enhance global
capability and capacity to respond to oil spills within the Arctic and
Subarctic regions (Koivurova et al., 2020).

This study aimed to comprehensively and systematically review the major
issues of oil spills in coastal regions of the Arctic and Subarctic.
This includes the assessment of impacts of spilled oil (crude and
refined products) on invertebrates, fish, birds, marine mammals, and
humans. Understanding the factors influencing oil transport and fate
within the coastal Arctic regions is necessary to assess the damage to
natural re- sources and the subsequent habitat recovery. Oil spill
countermeasures based on the results of laboratory studies, field
trials, and case studies that may be used in cold regions, such as
natural attenuation, biore- mediation, manual removal, in situ burning,
and enhanced oil trans- location, including the use of surface-washing
agents, are also discussed. Finally, to ensure the protection of the
Arctic ecosystem (and its living resources) and the socioeconomic
well-being of coastal communities, existing national/international
policies and regulations related to oil spills in cold regions are
reviewed. Based on the state of knowledge gained from this review,
current gaps are identified and recommenda- tions are provided for
scientific researchers, spill responders and co- ordinators, and
policy/decision-makers to minimize the impacts of future oil spills in
Arctic coastal regions.

2\. Impacts of oil spill on Arctic and Subarctic wildlife and

human

[Spilled oil in Arctic or Subarctic waters **does not remain
stationary** but is carried by wind and currents (horizontally and
vertically), often covering considerably large areas. Oil will likely
reach shoreline regions or become trapped within sea ice, affecting
coastal wildlife and local communities (Fig. 2), which are highly
dependent on the sustenance and habitat of a healthy ocean.]{.underline}

Arctic species on the move

Over the past two decades, polar bears and Pacific walrus have changed
their behaviour as sea ice in some parts of the Arctic recedes north
earlier in summer. More polar bears now make their dens on land instead
of on sea ice and Pacific walrus form huge, crowded groups along
coastlines, often farther from their feeding grounds. Receding sea ice
is also allowing killer whales to move further north, enabling them to
prey on narwhal, beluga, and bowhead whales. The climate crisis is also
altering seasonal activities, population numbers and migratory patterns
of other important Arctic species, such as caribou and salmon. [This is
resulting in food shortages for people living in the
Arctic]{.underline}, especially Indigenous communities, and jeopardizing
their livelihoods, cultures, and health.

But climate change is not the only factor behind Arctic biodiversity
loss. [Expanding industries are building roads to mine sites and
drilling for oil and gas, putting even **more pressure** on Arctic
species, habitats and ecosystems]{.underline}. This development is
happening despite the fact that new Arctic oil and gas exploration and
production goes against the Paris Agreement's goal to stay within the
1.5°C limit of global warming.

[Industrial development also poses a **tremendous risk** to the Arctic
ecosystems]{.underline} and species that some 4 million people living in
the region depend on for their food, livelihoods and cultural identity.
[Roads cutting through the tundra **inhibit** caribou migration and
adaptation. Underwater noise from drilling makes it harder for whales to
**navigate**, and oil spills **endanger** whole marine
ecosystems.]{.underline} Finding ways to maintain a healthy, diverse and
connected web of life in the Arctic, from zooplankton to fish to whales
and seabirds, will not only contribute to the well-being of Arctic
peoples, but to nature and communities around the world.

Accessed 6-30-2025; AY\]

[Oil in the Arctic marine ecosystem originates mainly from two sources:
**drilling activity and oil spills** during transportation. Drilling
activity causes long-term exposure and thus chronic effects on Arctic
marine ecosystems,]{.underline} such as changes in species composition,
dominance and biomass, while [oil spill effects are acute and can cause
**severe damage** locally1]{.underline} . However, [the oil
products,]{.underline} whether it originates from shipping activities or
drilling activity, [destroy **all aspects** of the environmental
integrity of the marine ecosystems including fisheries, marine mammals,
corals, ocean and shore birds, and the coastal wildlife and thus lead to
changes in e.g. behaviour (feeding, activity and motility, avoidance
reactions etc.), growth, and reproduction2]{.underline} .

Oil spills in ice are more complicated to address than oil spills in
open waters. Should this occur at the wrong place at the wrong time, for
example in the marginal ice zone, in polynyas, during the high
production period, the impacts could be serious. Shallow waters are the
most sensitive to such pollution, and these areas are important to
organisms of all levels of the Arctic food chain. Apart from the
normally long distances from existing infrastructure, the oil is less
accessible in ice-covered waters.

[The slow rate of biological degradation of oil at near-zero
temperatures]{.underline} has led biologists to suggest that oil spills
[in the Arctic Ocean might remain there for periods of **50 years or
more**.]{.underline} The dynamics of the ice pack combined with the long
life of the oil could allow an oil spill to have a major effect on the
albedo in certain regions of the Arctic. It is estimated that the
transit time of an oil spill on the fringes of the Beaufort Sea around
the circumference of the Beaufort gyre would be about 7--10 years.
[Several mechanisms act both to diffuse the oil and to put the oil on
the surface of the ice. Therefore, as the source continued, the area
affected by the spill would grow. By the time the original spill site
returned to its original approximate geographic coordinates, a
**considerable area** of the Beaufort Sea could have its albedo
changed.]{.underline} The significance of the resultant albedo change
for the Arctic heat balance is moot, but most scientists agree that the
Arctic environment will require special precautions to minimize the
risks of accidental oil spills3 .

According to the ARCOP-study1 , it seems that long-term effects of oil
spills on open water ecosystem may be less important than generally
assumed, and restricted to a relatively small area. However, there is
still uncertainty about the effect of oil in ice covered environments.
Oil associated with sea ice may have a notable effect on the ice biota,
particularly as oil tends to become trapped between ice floes, and
within brine channels in ice, and thus lengthens the contamination time.
[Even after several years of an oil accident, the recovery process of a
littoral or benthic ecosystem may still be **incomplete** and, in the
worst case, may not ever reach the **original state.**]{.underline}

Ottawa, Canada -- [A new report shows that the amount of underwater
noise in parts of the Arctic Ocean has **doubled in just six years**
because of increased shipping traffic.]{.underline} The report was
released by the Arctic Council and is the first time scientists have
mapped noise pollution from shipping across the region. The results are
staggering considering it [took oceans in other parts of the world
between 30 and 40 years to reach that magnitude of
increase.]{.underline}

[Underwater noise pollution is known to harm marine life from shellfish
to globally important fish stocks to large whales.]{.underline} The
Arctic's many coastal and Indigenous Peoples depend upon the ocean for
their livelihoods and culture. The Arctic Council study shows that
between 2013 and 2019, ship noise doubled in multiple locations, though
in some areas like the [Barents Sea and Baffin Bay, noise levels were up
to **ten times higher**.]{.underline}

Dr Melanie Lancaster, species lead WWF Arctic Programme said:

"Marine mammals rely on sound to find food and mates, navigate, avoid
predators and take care of their young. This report clearly shows that
one of the planet's last natural 'sound sanctuaries' for [marine life is
being inundated with human-caused underwater noise.]{.underline} There
is an urgent need to turn down the volume of ship noise in the Arctic
because these dramatic increases cannot be left unchecked."

The Arctic is warming three times faster than the rest of the planet.
Our rapidly changing climate has led to a decrease in sea ice and an
increase in shipping throughout the region. During the corresponding
time frame of the report, the [number of ships operating in Arctic
waters grew by 25 per cent and the distance they sailed increased 75 per
cent.]{.underline}

The Arctic Ocean's cold temperatures and other oceanographic conditions
make it a special case for underwater noise. Sound travels long
distances at shallow water depths. This means that ship noise is
concentrated within the swimming and diving ranges of whales, walrus and
other seals. [Even small amounts of shipping can have a
**disproportionately large impact** on the acoustic environment of
wildlife compared to other oceans around the world.]{.underline}

Wendy Elliott, Deputy Leader of WWF's Wildlife Practice said:

"Underwater noise is a global problem in our oceans. Based on scientific
knowledge from other parts of the world, the amount of noise in the
Arctic is likely already having a [detrimental effect on noise-sensitive
species and marine ecosystems. Ship noise can disrupt the activities
marine animals need to survive by shrinking their communication space,
causing stress and displacing them from important habitats. **More needs
to be done**]{.underline} to understand and reduce underwater noise
impacts on marine life."

The Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME) working group of
the Arctic Council recently published an extensive report on underwater
noise pollution from shipping in the Arctic.

[Shipping is one of several underwater activities that produce noise in
the Arctic. Along with mineral extraction, exploration, and port
construction, human-produced noise alters the underwater soundscape and
can potentially **negatively impact** marine ecosystems]{.underline} and
Indigenous and local ways of life.

Like many other types of pollution, the Arctic is disproportionately
affected. Noise pollution from shipping in the Arctic Ocean is
increasing at a rate faster than anywhere else in the world.

PAME expects [global economic growth and the expected decrease in sea
ice in the Arctic region to be the **major driving forces** behind
underwater noise pollution]{.underline} in the region.

[\[Image Excluded\]]{.underline}

Disturbs marine life

[Underwater noise pollution is **particularly disturbing** for marine
mammals, such as whales and dolphins.]{.underline} The noise can
interfere with and obscure their ability to hear natural ocean sounds,
which in turn can [disrupt their natural behavior and
communication]{.underline}.

[Animals communicate to find one another, coordinate hunts, and detect
and warn others about potential predators. A disruption of this behavior
can therefore have a **severe impact** on the animals\'
lives.]{.underline}

The noise itself can also be loud enough to send the animals into a
panic. To escape the noise, they might ascend too quickly, leading to
decompression sickness and skin damage. [Loud sounds can also cause
hearing loss or cause animals to **strand and die**.]{.underline}

Increased noise in the Arctic Ocean

The PAME report states that underwater noise from shipping will increase
across the Arctic Ocean if no action is taken.

The working group\'s model predicts that underwater noise pollution will
increase significantly by 2030, primarily due to increased ship traffic
and reductions in sea ice extent and thickness.

The increase of noise levels will not be uniform, however. In regions
with less shipping, such as the Chukchi Sea, changes will be significant
despite only modest increases in shipping. And in regions with heavy
shipping, such as the Barents Sea, changes will not be as noticeable,
but ship noise will nonetheless be persistently higher than across most
of the sea.

[Ocean acidification]{.underline} occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) from

Five times in the history of life on Earth the [corals]{.underline} have
[perished]{.underline}, swept from the board by conditions hostile to
nearly all life. Each time, it has taken [them **millions** of years to
evolve anew.]{.underline} Each **[mass death]{.underline}** of
corals has been [accompanied by the mass deaths of most other
**species**, on **land** and at **sea**.]{.underline}

Corals are the traffic light that warns of planet-wide
catastrophe ahead. And the light is glaring red.

Like the wildfires searing the world's forests and grasslands, like the
vanishing of insects, birds and large mammals the corals are another
unambiguous signal that humans are riding a runaway train to our own
ultimate destruction. Yet our fossil-fuelled governments and
corporations heap coals into the engine, keep down their heads and
deliberately ignore onrushing disaster.

That the sixth Great Death of corals is now upon us is plain from the
evidence piling up around the world. The US National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Watch has warned the world is
now in its fourth global cycle of bleaching since 1998 -- an ominous
crescendo.\[1\]

Coral bleaching has been reported in reefs extending across Florida, the
Caribbean, Brazil, the south Pacific, the Middle East, west Indonesia
and East Africa. Australia's Great Barrier Reef is undergoing its fifth
mass bleaching event in eight years with over 80% of the reef hit by
bleaching-level heat stress in 2024, the highest ever seen. \[2\]

The data spell disaster for humanity in both the short and the long
term. [Coral reefs]{.underline} are estimated
to [generate]{.underline} around US\$9.8 trillion in economic
activity annually from fishing, tourism and [ecosystem
services]{.underline}. They support [around **500 million
livelihoods**]{.underline} [in 100 countries around the planet and
**supply** a significant part of the **world's food**]{.underline}.
Their loss would be the economic equivalent of losing three world car
industries. Yet most governments and corporates are accelerating it.

Additionally, coral reefs [provide barrier protection for]{.underline}
many heavily-populated **[coastlines]{.underline}** [which]{.underline}
will be [**exposed** to **major flooding** from storms, tsunamis and sea
level rise as the reefs break up]{.underline}. Corals
also absorb a significant amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide -- and
their loss eliminates an important brake on global
heating, projecting the Earth more rapidly into a Hothouse state where
large animals and humans struggle to survive.

As in the previous five events, the [loss of
corals heralds **extinction** on a **global scale**.]{.underline}

Corals first emerged around 542 million years ago in the oceans of the
Precambrian era. Over the next half billion years they underwent five
major extinction events, followed by long lags of 5 to 20 million years
before they managed to evolve anew. Ancient species, such as the
once-plentiful rugose corals, were wiped out in the Great Death of the
Permian era, and remain lost forever.

[Corals are not a single creature, but a partnership between the coral
polyps and their symbiotic zooxanthellae,]{.underline} from which they
obtain most of their nutrient energy. When this partnership is severed
-- by hot, toxic, anoxic or acidic sea water or disease -- the coral
expel the algae and blanch. Unless the algae rapidly reoccupy them, the
coral polyps starve and die and the whole colony perishes, leaving only
the whitened skeletons of 'hard corals' in the graveyards photographed
by wondering tourists, blind to the tragedy unfolding before their very
eyes.

[Coral colonies also sustain a host of other life, including
fishes]{.underline}, molluscs and sea plants, [creating living marvels
such as the **Great Barrier Reef**.]{.underline}
[Their loss]{.underline} is thus accompanied by the loss of thousands of
other species, and [travels all the way up the food
chain reaching]{.underline} even birds and land animals, including
**[humans]{.underline}**.

It is the very fraility of the bond between the coral polyps and their
zooxanthellae that renders them such a vital signaller of thermal and
chemical disaster in the oceans -- and thus, on the planet as a whole.
They are not 'just corals', as so many scientifically-illiterate
politicians, media and 'opinion influencers' seem to regard them.

reefs]{.underline} cover only 0.0025% of the ocean floor, they [are
responsible for producing **half** of the oxygen present in]{.underline}
the [Earth's atmosphere]{.underline}. It is the symbiotic relationship
between corals and an alga, zooxanthellae, that makes this miraculous
phenomenon possible.

Isn't it amusing that these reefs only cover up such a little portion of
the ocean floor and can still produce such a significant amount of
oxygen? [They're **crucial**]{.underline} not only **[for our
existence]{.underline}** but also for the existence of marine life.

In this article, we will get to know about how coral reefs produce
oxygen, how they're a region for thriving biodiversity, and the factors
responsible for their survival.

Let's dive deep into the coral reefs.

What are Coral Reefs?

A coral reef can be considered a vast ecosystem that consists of
colonies of hundreds of tiny living corals. Each of the corals is
referred to as a "polyp".

These corals have branch-like structures; most of them possess a hard,
protective shell that is made of calcium carbonate. They also have
varying sizes and colors.

When these tiny corals of different colors and sizes grow together in
hundreds and thousands, they gradually form a reef.

Did you know that it takes about a year for a 10-centimeters polyp to
grow? The time taken for a coral reef to fully grow ranges from a
hundred thousand to 30 million years.

It means that the coral reefs we see today have been developing for over
ten thousand years. It also means that if these are depleted, it will
take them thousands of years to replenish; they might even go extinct
for all we know.

Types of Coral Reefs

We can all agree that the marine world is still largely unexplored.
However, so far, we have found four different types of coral reefs.

Let's learn more about all of them:

Barrier Reefs

The coral reefs that are parallel to the coastline but are separated by
a wide lagoon, or any other water body, are called Barrier Reefs. Here,
the term "barrier" is used because these reefs create a barrier between
the coast and the ocean at the shallowest point, reaching the water's
surface.

Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the most popular example of a barrier
reef. It also happens to be the largest barrier reef in the entire
world.

Patch Reefs

Patch reefs are patches of isolated coral reefs that are close to each
other but are separated by sand rings. These reefs are usually found in
a collective reef in shallow lagoons and occur under 10-20 feet of
water.

Patch reefs are commonly found in the Bahamas, the Pacific Islands,
Bermuda, and the Caribbean Islands.

Atolls

When you see rings of coral reefs surrounding a lagoon, they are known
as Atolls. Atolls are usually found in the middle of the ocean.

Some of the famous examples of atolls are the Funafuti and the Fuji
atolls in the Ellice Islands.

Fringing Reefs

The coral reefs that grow very close to the coast are called Fringing
Reefs. These reefs are usually attached to the shoreline, but the
portion at their back could be shallowly submerged in the water.

Fringing reefs are the most common coral reef variety.

How do coral reefs produce oxygen?

As we have mentioned earlier, coral reefs produce oxygen due to their
symbiotic relationship with an alga called zooxanthellae.

But have you ever wondered what a symbiotic relationship means?

A symbiotic relationship is an intimate relationship between two
different organisms of different species. In this type of relationship,
both organisms interact, out of which at least one organism benefits.

Along with zooxanthellae, other algae inside the coral tissue carry out
photosynthesis as well. These algae provide the corals with food and
energy. Now you might be wondering what the corals can offer to the
zooxanthellae and other algae in return?

The corals provide these algae with a shelter to live. They also provide
them with carbon dioxide to carry out the process of photosynthesis.

Thus, it is actually the algae that produce half of the Earth's oxygen
while being in a symbiotic relationship with the coral reefs.

Fun facts: Did you know that it is zooxanthellae that provide the
awestruck colors to the corals?

Factors responsible for the survival of coral reefs

Now that we've learned all about coral reefs and their importance, we
can agree that their survival is crucial for the survival of humans and
all other living organisms.

But what do these reefs need to survive? That's what we will talk about
in this section.

Coral reefs have five necessities that can affect their survival, and
all of them are listed below. Keep reading to learn more:

1\. Coral reefs need sunshine

Because coral reefs can't grow below 165 feet, they are always found in
shallow waters. But have you ever wondered why that is?

It is because they require sunshine to survive. Sunlight is essential
for algae to carry out the process of photosynthesis and produce oxygen.
Coral themselves depend on the algae, zooxanthellae, to get oxygen and
live.

2\. Coral reefs need warm water

Corals that build reefs need warm water to live. But warm water doesn't
mean that they can survive at any temperature.

Different types of coral reefs can tolerate only a range of
temperatures. They can survive between the warmth of 68 to 90 degrees
Fahrenheit or 20 to 32 degrees centigrade.

3\. Coral reefs need clear water

Coral reefs need clear water for their survival because sunlight can
pass only through clear waters and not dense or opaque waters.

Organisms like plankton can cloud the water, which prevents sunlight
from reaching the algae present on corals, which is problematic for
photosynthesis.

4\. Coral reefs need clean water

Pollutants and various sediments can easily damage the corals. Wondering
how? By making the water cloudy and preventing the sunlight from
reaching them. The presence of sediments in water can, thus, destroy
corals.

If wastewater is ever released near coral reefs, it will destroy them.
It is because nitrogen, the most common nutrient present in wastewater,
is known to impair coral growth.

5\. Coral reefs need a saltwater

Have you ever found coral reefs in a water body that contains purely
freshwater? Probably not. It is because the corals need the presence of
salt in water for their growth and are, thus, always formed in seawater.

Coral Reefs: a zone of thriving biodiversity

Before diving into how and why coral reefs have become the hub of
biodiversity, let's discuss what do is meant by the term "biodiversity"?

Biodiversity is a term that refers to the existence of an enormous
variety of living organisms present on the surface of the Earth in
different ecosystems, along with different environmental factors like
temperature, oxygen levels, and climate.

Now, what makes a coral reef a thriving zone for biodiversity? The
production of oxygen by coral reefs explains the presence of a wide
variety of species found near them. They also provide a home and shelter
to these living organisms.

How many species of organisms do you think we can find around coral
reefs? Thousands of species of organisms are seen on and around them.
Additionally, we can also find marine animals like sea turtles, sharks,
and stingrays around them.

Coral reefs are the sole reason for many species to come together and
create an ecosystem. They provide the resources for them to live and
thrive, preventing them from being endangered or extinct.

It is as if the reefs act as magnets for different species. Such is the
concentration of species inhabiting the coral reefs that many of them
are not even known yet. Researches are still conducted around coral
reefs to find out new organism species.

Thus, the coral reefs' function of producing oxygen in such high amounts
brings together thousands of flora and fauna, creating a zone of
thriving biodiversity.

Are the coral reefs dying?

Coral reefs are the most diverse ecosystems in the seas and oceans. In
fact, it wouldn't be wrong to say that they are a part of the reason
behind all life on Earth.

However, nowadays, this essential resource is slowly getting depleted
because of a range of destructive human activities.

Scientists have predicted that if we proceed at this rate, the existence
of all the coral reefs will be threatened (on the brink of extinction)
by the year 2050.

What does it mean for us? [The extinction of coral reefs will lead to
the loss of half of the oxygen]{.underline} present [in the atmosphere,
which might]{.underline} end up **[threaten]{.underline}**ing **[our
existence]{.underline}**.

The following are some of the reasons behind the depletion of coral
reefs:

1\. Coral bleaching

When the ocean waters become warm, coral detach the oxygen-supplying
zooxanthellae from themselves. It leads to the corals losing their color
and inbuilt food sources, and, in turn, all the bleached corals turn
white.

And although corals can survive bleaching, they cannot survive being
subjected to repeated stress.

2\. Increasing sea levels

Nowadays, glaciers are melting because of global warming, which has led
to a rise in sea levels. And as sea levels are increasing, the coral
reefs become more submerged into the sea.

It will eventually lead to a decreased growth of corals, as they would
receive less amount of sunlight, which is essential to their survival.

3\. Overfishing

The practice of overfishing and unsustainable fishing near the coral
reefs leads to imbalances in the marine ecosystems. In addition to the
extinction of fish, it is also known to deplete some key reef species in
many locations.

Furthermore, some fishing gears can also inflict physical damage to
coral reefs, along with seagrass beds and other vital marine habitats.

4\. Water pollution

Discharging sewage and industrial waste into seawater introduces
pollutants and sediments to it, leading to water pollution.

And as we've mentioned earlier, the nutrients present in these
contaminants lead to the growth of weed and algae, which damage the
corals.

Conclusion

In this article, we have learned about how [coral reefs are **vital** in
**balancing** the **oxygen** of the atmosphere]{.underline}. These
[reefs play a **key role in our survival**]{.underline} as well as the
survival of marine creatures. Various phenomena like global warming and
pollution are directly or indirectly leading to the [depletion of the
coral reefs]{.underline}, which [can]{.underline} eventually [lead to
**our extinction** as well.]{.underline}

[Increasing acidity in the world's oceans will cause **massive organ
failure** in yellowfin tuna larvae,]{.underline} according to a
disturbing new study published in the Journal of Experimental Marine
Biology and Ecology. [Carbon dioxide in the ocean is changing the
chemical conditions under which life has evolved.]{.underline}

This particular tuna is shaped like a torpedo and has dark metallic blue
backs, yellow sides, and a silver belly. They have very long anal and
dorsal fins and finlets that are bright yellow. The lifespan of a
yellowfin can be six or seven years. Highly migratory, they are found
throughout the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This fish is prized
in the raw sashimi market and overfishing has impacted the Yellowfin
Tuna , but populations are considered somewhat abundant. [So far the
world's fisheries have managed the population so that it does not result
in the **same fate** as the threatened bluefin tuna.]{.underline} "The
bluefin tuna, which has been endangered for several years and has the
misfortune to be prized by Japanese sushi lovers, has suffered a
catastrophic decline in stocks in the Northern Pacific Ocean, of more
than 96%, according to research published." [It is estimated that 90
percent of all large predatory fish---including tuna, sharks, swordfish,
cod and halibut---are gone]{.underline}

Urgency for ocean protection

Globally, marine protection lags far behind land efforts, say
conservationists. [But there is building momentum on the back of the
just-concluded 2025 UN Ocean Conference. In recent weeks, a raft of new
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and ocean protection commitments were
announced, as nations moved toward ratifying the Agreement on Marine
Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction, also known
as the High Seas Treaty]{.underline}.

[This international agreement aims to push forward protection of 30% of
the world's oceans by 2030 while establishing legal mechanisms for
protection of high seas areas. Fifty countries have ratified the treaty
so far, but 60 are needed for it to come into force.]{.underline}

Findlay says her team's acidification findings should add impetus for
nations who have yet to ratify the accord. "[Any additional protection
that's placed on the ocean, provides an opportunity for ecosystem
resilience against harder-to-solve issues, such as \[ocean
acidification\],"]{.underline} she says. "However, \[our findings\]
should also be a motivation to cut emissions, given that
\[acidification\] and climate change are a \[dual\] threat to marine
biodiversity, which this treaty aims to protect."

In a June 2025 Nature commentary, Rockström and other scientists,
including eminent marine biologist Sylvia Earle, warned that the high
seas treaty, though important, will likely take years to put into
action. They argue that urgent steps are needed immediately to protect
the world's oceans from all forms of exploitation.

"Given the urgency of addressing the climate and biodiversity crises,
the world can't wait another decade to fix the problems humans have
created," they write. "Ocean life is too precious and important to lose,
and shifts in the chemical and physical environments of the sea, once
made, will be irreversible on timescales of centuries to millennia."

"For the high seas, 30 by 30 is not enough," Rockström tells Mongabay.
"We should halt 100% of the high seas overexploitation with industrial
fishing \[and\] industrial trawling and forbid all forms of deep-sea
mining."

#### Ocean health is [strong]{.underline}.

Eric **Bender 21**, Science Writer, \"The Case for Ocean Optimism,\"
Knowable Magazine, 08/05/2021,
https://knowablemagazine.org/article/food-environment/2021/the-case-ocean-optimism.

But [there's]{.underline} **[good news]{.underline}**, too,
[says]{.underline} Nancy [Knowlton]{.underline}, a [coral reef biologist
at the]{.underline} **[Smithsonian]{.underline}** Natio[nal Museum of
Natural History]{.underline}. In fact, she says, many [marine
conservation efforts]{.underline} **[around the globe]{.underline}**
[are seeing]{.underline} **[good]{.underline}** [results]{.underline}.

"There are a lot of successes out there, and most people don't know
about them," Knowlton says. It's important to share those successes, she
adds, to avoid paralyzing feelings of hopelessness and to spread the
knowledge of approaches that work. That's why she and her allies began
pushing the #oceanoptimism Twitter hashtag in 2014. Organizations such
as Conservation Optimism and the Cambridge Conservation Initiative have
broadened her theme, helping to share conservation stories, findings,
resolve and resources.

In marine conservation, "successful efforts typically are neither quick
nor cheap and require trust and collaboration," Knowlton wrote in a 2020
Annual Review of Marine Science paper promoting ocean optimism. Focusing
on success stories, she stressed, helps motivate people to work toward
new successes.

Here are glimpses of a few bright spots in the pitched battle for the
blue planet.

Some high-profile **[conservation efforts]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}** [paying off]{.underline}.

An international [moratorium on]{.underline} commercial **[whale
hunting]{.underline}** that started in the 1980s [has shown]{.underline}
**[dramatic]{.underline}** [results]{.underline}, even though a few
species are still hunted by several countries and indigenous groups.
While some whale populations remain very much in trouble --- the North
Atlantic right whale, for instance, is critically endangered --- others
are rebounding. The [population]{.underline} of humpback whales in the
western South Atlantic, which had dropped to around 450 in the 1950s,
now is [estimated]{.underline} at around 25,000 --- [near the level
scientists]{.underline} **[estimate]{.underline}** [existed before
hunting began]{.underline}. The International Whaling Commission
estimates the global population of these whales now may be around
120,000 animals. **[Blue]{.underline}**, **[bowhead]{.underline}**,
**[fin]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[sei]{.underline}** [whale
populations are]{.underline} also **[growing globally]{.underline}**,
according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Sea turtles are another success story. Most [populations of
turtles]{.underline} included in a recent survey [were found to
be]{.underline} **[growing]{.underline}**, even though the animals must
be protected on both land and sea. In Florida, scientists estimate that
the population of green turtle nests climbed from 62 in 1979 to 37,341
in 2015. And in Texas, Kemp's Ridley turtle nests rose from just 1 to
353 over roughly the same time period, Knowlton notes.

Many fisheries are reasonably well managed.

In many areas, the ocean is dangerously overfished. But the world's most
valuable [fisheries]{.underline}, which make up roughly 34 percent of
global captures, [are]{.underline} **[relatively healthy]{.underline}**
in general, environmental economists Christopher
**[Costello]{.underline}** of the University of California at Santa
Barbara [and]{.underline} Daniel **[Ovando]{.underline}** of the
University of Washington in Seattle [wrote]{.underline} in the 2019
Annual Review of Environment and Resources.

Hot debates continue about the status of many species that were
massively overfished for decades. But [there is good evidence
that]{.underline} **[sustainable management]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} now [being achieved]{.underline} for some species
[in]{.underline} some [regions]{.underline}. According to the UN's Food
and Agriculture Organization, 34.2 percent of the world's marine
fisheries are currently overfished, but harvests have held relatively
steady for fisheries ranging from Alaska pollock to European sardines
(pilchards) to Indian mackerel and yellowfin tuna.

On the high seas beyond national jurisdiction, fishing vessels largely
operate without legal restrictions, and sometimes hundreds of vessels
will target a given region and make huge hauls. Such incidents may
suggest that the unregulated high seas "would be a tremendous threat to
sustainability of the world's fisheries," Costello and Ovando wrote.
"Somewhat incredibly, this does not appear to be the case." Among the
likely explanations: High seas fishing accounts for only 6 percent of
global fish catch; pursuing highly mobile and unpredictable species such
as tuna can be extremely expensive; and regional fisheries management
organizations do watch over many catches in the high seas.

The high seas may come under better control through a United Nations
treaty on marine biodiversity, which may be finalized next year after
many years of meetings. This would greatly broaden the international
resources available for proper fisheries management anywhere on the
ocean.

Moreover, [technology is]{.underline} **[changing the
game]{.underline}** [in fisheries enforcement, says]{.underline} Heather
**[Koldewey]{.underline}**, a senior technical advisor at the Zoological
Society of London. Organizations such as Global Fishing Watch and Ocean
Mind [track]{.underline} large [fishing vessels via]{.underline}
**[satellite imaging]{.underline}**, [making it easy to]{.underline}
**[track]{.underline}** [suspicious activities such as]{.underline}
**[clusters of vessels]{.underline}** [in a protected zone]{.underline}.
In 2019, for example, after Global Fishing Watch partnered with the US
Coast Guard in the Pacific, the patrol tripled its number of fishing
vessel boardings. Also in 2019, Ocean Mind joined with Interpol and
several nations and successfully tracked and seized an illegal fishing
vessel in Indonesia.

There's also hope for an end to the large governmental subsidies given
to high-seas fisheries that are ecologically unsustainable and also, by
World Trade Organization assessment, don't make economic sense. Each
year, China, the European Union, the United States and others give about
\$35 billion of subsidies to their fishing industries, many of them
high-seas fleets going after populations that can't sustain the attack.
Without these large subsidies, "as much as 54 percent of the present
high-seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable," estimated marine
biologist Enric Sala of the National Geographic Society and his
coauthors in a 2018 Science Advances paper.

Finalizing years of negotiations to reduce these subsidies will be a
high priority for WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala.

Marine protected areas are rapidly expanding and could play a hugely
positive role.

Marine protected areas are regions of the ocean designated to guard
ecosystems that may be particularly crucial for preserving biodiversity
or withstanding specific severe threats. Almost 8 percent of the ocean
has been structured as MPAs, although less than half of that area is
fully protected against fishing and loss of other resources. [Coverage
is]{.underline} **[growing]{.underline}** --- for instance, in April
2021 the European Commission and 15 countries announced [support
for]{.underline} two **[MPAs]{.underline}** that would protect more than
3 million square kilometers of the Southern Ocean off Antarctica.

Safeguarding marine environments, [MPAs]{.underline} also
[offer]{.underline} **[major benefits]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
human [communities, such as]{.underline}
**[reestablishing]{.underline}** [fish populations that can
be]{.underline} **[sustainably]{.underline}** [fished just outside their
waters]{.underline}. An analysis of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine
National Monument off Hawaii, the third-largest protected area in the
world, found "little, if any, negative impacts on the fishing industry,"
according to a 2020 Nature Communications article. And in Southern
California, MPAs preventing fishing in 35 percent of one coastal area
led to a 225 percent increase in spiny lobster catch after just six
years, scientists reported in a 2021 Scientific Reports paper.

A worldwide "30 by 30" initiative seeks to protect at least 30 percent
of the globe by 2030, with backers including the G7 group of wealthy
industrial nations.

Some progress is being made in the global struggle against pollution.

OK, nothing like the progress that is needed. But there are some happy
stories, although they may take decades for the payoffs to be evident,
says Carlos Duarte, a marine ecologist at King Abdullah Science and
Technology University in Saudi Arabia.

One example is a series of [governmental restrictions]{.underline} that
began in the 1970s to [ban]{.underline} **[leaded fuels]{.underline}**
[in vehicles, a]{.underline} **[major]{.underline}** [source of ocean
pollution]{.underline}. During a global expedition in 2010 and 2011,
Duarte and colleagues looked at levels of lead across the ocean and
found they had dropped to negligible. "By banning leaded fuels, [we
actually]{.underline} **[restored the whole ocean]{.underline}** [within
30 years]{.underline}," he says.

[Oil spilled]{.underline} into the ocean from tankers [has]{.underline}
also [dropped]{.underline} **[dramatically]{.underline}** [over the
decades]{.underline}, primarily [due to steady tightening
of]{.underline} **[regulations]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[conventions]{.underline}** like the International Maritime
Organization's International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution
from Ships.

True, plastics are a global garbage disaster. Although public awareness
has climbed dramatically, as much as 23 million metric tons of plastic
waste still enter aquatic systems each year, according to a 2020 article
in Science. This megaproblem must be solved primarily upstream, in
manufacture and use, says Marcus Eriksen, an environmental scientist at
5 Gyres Institute in Santa Monica, California. "Today, the optimism is
around the innovators, the private sector rising to the challenge to
fill the consumer need without the externalities of pollution," he says.
Eriksen points to manufacturers ramping up production of innovative
biomaterials such as microbially synthesized polymers called
polyhydroxyalkanoates, or PHAs, that are designed to be fully degradable
by microbes in the ocean and other natural environments.

We know how to restore crucial coastal ecosystems such as mangroves at
large scale.

Vast stretches of healthy coastal ecosystems have been lost to
pollution, urban expansion, conversion for aquaculture and other human
activities. But not all the news is bad --- take
[mangroves]{.underline}, for instance, which [make]{.underline}
**[enormous]{.underline}** [contributions to]{.underline}
**[biodiversity]{.underline}**, **[fisheries]{.underline}**, storm
protection [and]{.underline} **[carbon storage]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline} warm coa[stlines around the world]{.underline}.

"We've [seen a]{.underline} **[slowdown]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[losses of mangroves]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
in many regions of the world we're [starting to see an]{.underline}
**[increase]{.underline}**," says Duarte. "We are very, [very capable of
restoring mangroves]{.underline} **[at scale]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} I think [it's]{.underline} **[doable]{.underline}**
[to restore them to]{.underline} almost [their]{.underline}
**[historical extent]{.underline}** [within]{.underline} the next [30
years]{.underline}."

The most dramatic example, Duarte adds, is the restoration of 1,400
square kilometers of Vietnam's Mekong Delta mangrove forest, destroyed
by the US Air Force in the 1970s. "When I worked there in the late
1990s, if I wasn't a trained mangrove ecologist I would have thought I
was in a pristine mangrove forest," he says. "And that [mangrove
sequesters an]{.underline} **[amount]{.underline}** [of carbon that
is]{.underline} **[very significant]{.underline}** compared to the
emissions of Vietnam, which [has a]{.underline} **[huge positive
role]{.underline}** [in mitigating climate change]{.underline}."

The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed roughly a quarter of a million
people helped to shift international thinking about the importance of
defending and reestablishing mangrove forests, Duarte says. Judging by
analyses of the tsunami's impact published later, "it was clear that in
the villages where there was a pocket of mangrove sheltered between the
shoreline and the village, there was almost no human cost," he says.
"Even property losses were severely reduced."

In the Philippines, too, some mangrove forests are being recovered after
decades in which half of them were lost, mostly to aquaculture ponds or
coastal development, says Koldewey. "We've made huge progress in
science-based but community-led mangrove restoration projects," she
says. "Within five years, they're functioning, trapping loads of carbon,
stopping waves eroding shore or damaging people and habitats, and doing
their mangrove thing."

It's important, though, that these efforts are done right. (To learn
more, see Knowable Magazine's article on mangrove restoration.) Key to
success, researchers have learned, are selecting the right mangrove
species and planting them in the right locations --- and being sure to
involve local communities.

Mangroves aren't the only types of coastal ecosystems being renewed
around the world. Salt marshes and oyster reefs are also being restored
on a large scale in Europe and the US, Duarte and colleagues note in a
2020 Nature paper. One recent study, for example, counted 140 saltmarsh
restoration projects in Europe, and massive efforts are underway in
Louisiana and Florida. "Restoration attempts of seagrass, seaweed and
coral reef ecosystems are also increasing globally, although they are
often small in scale," the Nature authors add.

[Offshore wind is]{.underline} **[rapidly]{.underline}** [ramping up to
deliver]{.underline} **[clean energy]{.underline}** [on a]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}** [scale]{.underline}.

Ocean wind technologies are proven around the world, and often are
highly competitive with other energy sources, especially with the advent
of larger turbines and other engineering advances. By one estimate, this
year [the]{.underline} **[global]{.underline}** [installed offshore wind
capacity will]{.underline} **[climb 37 percent]{.underline}**.

These giant [offshore wind factories]{.underline} will
[deliver]{.underline} **[enormous]{.underline}** [amounts of energy
with]{.underline} **[very low levels]{.underline}** [of greenhouse
gases]{.underline}, offering "an [important potential]{.underline} for
wind energy [to really make a]{.underline} **[big
contribution]{.underline}** [to going carbon]{.underline}
**[neutral]{.underline}**," Knowlton says. In 2019, the International
Energy Agency estimated that close-to-shore offshore wind sites have the
potential to provide more than the current global electricity demand.
Offshore turbines do bring ecological risks, including damage to marine
ecosystems, interference with fisheries and threats to birds, but
leading environmental groups see those risks as quite acceptable with
proper design and management. "It's past time to push for more offshore
wind," the Sierra Club declared in March 2021.

Optimism breeds action.

Of course, marine scientists can't forget the enormous threats to the
ocean for a second. "We're not being naive," says Koldewey. "There's a
lot of bad news, but we're balancing the narrative with: How do we solve
it? There are reasons to be optimistic and everybody has a role to play
in being part of the solution."

Duarte has become more hopeful in the past few years, as [growing signs
of conservation success]{.underline} **[crop up around]{.underline}**
[the world]{.underline}, often [from efforts]{.underline}
**[launched]{.underline}** decades ago. Taking on the challenge to heal
the oceans will be hugely difficult, "but if we don't do it now, a
decade from now it will be impossible," he says. "We made a goal to stop
grieving about the ocean, to accept the loss and then engage in action
--- because we still have the capacity to reverse much of the losses and
turn over a healthy ocean to our grandchildren."

[Biodiversity is the **fabric of life on Earth** and the life support
system that **underpins planetary health** and **human
well-being**]{.underline} \[289\]. [Fossil fuels pose an existential
threat to]{.underline} the planet's [biodiversity]{.underline}. Fossil
fuels drive the climate crisis which is [accelerating species
**extinction risk** and **ecosystem degradation**]{.underline}, and
cause biodiversity harms [through fossil fuel **development** and
**petrochemical pollution**]{.underline}. In a destructive cycle, the
[fossil-fuel-driven degradation of wild places and loss of species
**worsens the climate crisis** by disrupting ecosystem-based carbon
dioxide removal]{.underline} from the atmosphere, [which is **needed to
curb global heating**]{.underline} \[290\]. Overall, fossil-fuel-driven
[**biod**iversity loss has]{.underline} direct and [dire impacts on
**food security** and nutrition, **water** quality and availability,
**health and well-being, carbon storage** and sequestration,
**resilience to climate change**, and]{.underline} almost all of
[nature's vital contributions]{.underline} \[291\], [on top
of]{.underline} the incalculable, non-monetizable costs of **[species
extinctions]{.underline}**.

Worldwide an estimated [one million animal and plant species are
threatened with extinction]{.underline}, with climate change as a
primary driver, [alongside habitat destruction and
exploitation]{.underline} \[292\]. [Scientists]{.underline} have long
[documented]{.underline} the widespread and growing stresses of
anthropogenic climate change on species and ecosystems, as **[rising
temperatures]{.underline}**, more **[extreme weather]{.underline}**
events, [**coastal flooding, sea ice and glacier melt**, and **other
climate hazards make conditions**]{.underline} more
**[inhospitable]{.underline}**. Climate change is disrupting species'
distributions, timing of breeding and migration, physiology, vital
rates, and genetics \[293--296\]. [It is **spreading disease** and
invasive species; increasing mortality and localized **extinctions**;
and **deteriorating ecosystem processes**]{.underline} \[297--299\].
Climate change-related local extinctions are already widespread \[300\].

**[Every increase in fossil fuel pollution and]{.underline}** resulting
**[climate stress pushes ecosystems closer to tipping points and
amplifies extinction risk]{.underline}**. With \~1.5°C temperature rise
as of 2024, the world's [coral reef ecosystems]{.underline}---[which
support a quarter of ocean life and]{.underline} the livelihoods of a
[half billion people]{.underline}---[are in crisis due to]{.underline}
increasingly frequent and severe bleaching events from [ocean heating
paired with]{.underline} ocean [acidification]{.underline} \[301\]. Half
of the world's reefs have already been lost \[302\] and near total
global reef col- lapse is projected at 2°C temperature rise \[66\]. An
estimated 1.6% of species are projected to become extinct at the current
level of temperature rise \[303\]. [Numerous studies have projected
**catastrophic species losses**]{.underline} with continued fossil fuel
pollution with, for example, the climate-related extinction of 14%--32%
of animal and plant species---representing the potential loss of 3
million to 6 million species---in the next 50 years, even under
intermediate fossil fuel emissions scenarios \[304\]. Scientists have
called for the urgent transformation of our energy system away from
fossil fuels to prevent a mass extinction event \[305\].

[Fossil fuel development itself]{.underline} also [causes a **wide array
of harms** to species and ecosystems: **destroying** and fragmenting
**wildlife habitat**, causing **air, noise**, and **light pollution,
contaminating** surface and ground **water** and reducing water
supplies, and **facilitating the spread of** ecologically disruptive
**invasive species**]{.underline} \[306--308\], [with similar harms in
the marine environment]{.underline} \[309\]. [Fossil fuel infrastructure
creates]{.underline} the [significant risk of **oil spills** and brine
spills, which can kill wildlife and cause long-term impacts over large

3\. Indicators of the current biodiversity crisis

Recent local, regional and global studies present diverse indications of
the current biodiversity crisis. From a plant life perspective, for
example, 70% of the Earth\'s land surface potentially occupied by plants
has been altered \[26\]. Consistent with the onset of agriculture some
11 000 years ago, the biomass of terrestrial vegetation has been reduced
by ca 50% \[27\], with an estimated loss of approximately 20% of its
original biodiversity \[28\]. Related to this, 40% of plants have been
catalogued as endangered \[29\]. [From a zoocentric perspective, a clear
pulse of Anthropocene defaunation (sensu \[30,31\]) has been
demonstrated.]{.underline} Vertebrate biomass consisted of some 300
million tons 11 000 years ago, of which a tiny fraction corresponded to
a human population of approximately 4 million \[32\]. [By 2015, total
vertebrate biomass exploded to a **dramatic 1850 million**
tons]{.underline}, but this was largely composed of [domesticated
animals, which monopolized 76% of the total, followed by humans at
23%]{.underline} (7.3 billion humans by then), [while wildlife was
reduced to a mere 1%]{.underline} (not considering seals, sea lions,
amphibians and birds in this study). [Despite this biological
\[collapse\] ~~holocaust~~]{.underline}, a little fewer than 700
vertebrate species have been recorded as extinct or extinct in the wild
over the last 520 years \[11,12\]. Undoubtedly the extinction of many
more species, particularly of small-sized, understudied invertebrates,
has gone unrecorded \[33\], but a basic point remains---[the holocaust
is the loss of populations and the ecosystem services they provide, not
the loss of species, as we will discuss later]{.underline} \[34\].

4\. The extinction crisis: an intersection of two complex adaptive
systems

Within an ecosystem, the plants, animals, fungi, bacteria and many other
types of microorganisms play ecological roles via their evolutionary and
ecological interaction with their abiotic and biotic environments. Such
interactions define the functioning of ecosystems. They are complex
adaptive systems, as they consist of myriad elements that interact
locally (survive and reproduce), leading to emergent system properties
\[35\]. Predicting the exact trajectory of a complex adaptive system is
near impossible but predicting one that will have emergent properties is
generally correct. Changing the atmospheric temperature will certainly
change the functioning of a terrestrial ecosystem, but just how is much
more difficult to predict.

Although of very recent appearance in the evolutionary tree, and with a
few traits that set them apart, human beings are part of biodiversity
and elements in a global ecosystem. Their most distinctive traits among
vertebrates are their vast stores of non-genetic information or
'culture' \[36\] and their ultrasociality---levels of cooperation vastly
greater than those seen in other mammals \[37\].

Human culture is another complex adaptive system with emergent
properties (religions, wars and pandemics), but again the trajectory of
the entire system is notoriously unpredictable. Combine two complex
adaptive systems, and you can see why mitigating or even reversing the
anthropogenic effects of the ongoing sixth mass extinction event in
detail is particularly difficult (see \[38\]). Traffic jams are one
emergent property of the cultural complex adaptive systems, but the
basic problem cannot be solved by arresting drivers who slow down.

[Civilization, and even the **fate** of our species, is **utterly
dependent** on proper global ecosystem functioning. Ecosystem
functioning, including primary productivity, the biogeochemical cycles,
and the network of trophic mutualistic and antagonistic species
interactions that compose the food chains,]{.underline} is the fabric of
life---a fabric that is translated by humans as ecosystem services (e.g.
\[28,39\]).

The vast literature on the biodiversity--ecosystem function relationship
and the significance thereof in terms of services to humanity has
focused its attention on the [consequences of]{.underline} [changes in
the diversity of (mostly) plant species or genetic variants on four
**major types** of ecological processes: (i) provisioning, such as
**crop yield**, fodder yield, wood production, medicines and **medicine
models**; (ii) regulating, such as biocontrol, pollination and nutrient
cycling; (iii) support services such as primary productivity; and (iv)
cultural services, such as inspiration, and education (see a classic
review in \[40\]; also \[39\]). Biodiversity]{.underline}--ecosystem
function studies focused on animals are more limited, but some reviews
make such relationship evident too, [including services such as crop
pollination and pest control, seed dispersal, litter decomposition,
carbon cycling, carrion and dung removal, soil erosion control, animal
forage provisioning, and **zoonosis risk regulation**]{.underline} (see
reviews in \[30,41\]). What all this implies, in practical terms, is
that the millions of years of plant and phytoplankton cumulative
photosynthesis; the tens of millions of soil organisms that transform
dirt into fertile soil, decompose the bodies of dead organisms and
[contribute to nutrient recycling]{.underline}; the wild and
domesticated plants, animals (both terrestrial and aquatic) and fungi
that for millennia have [fed and currently feed the human
population]{.underline} (i.e. we all eat biodiversity); the communities
of animals that maintain plant reproduction and genetic diversity, as
well as those [animals that regulate the abundance of disease hosts and
vectors]{.underline}; the thousands of plants, fungi, other
microorganisms and animals that have provided and continue to provide
medicine or medicine models; [the physical protection due to ecosystem
'structures\' such as mangroves and coral reefs from **extreme weather
events**]{.underline}; and the increasingly appreciated significance of
the [inspirational, educational and emotional benefit derived from our
contact with biodiversity]{.underline} [constitute the **life-support
systems** for humanity]{.underline} (see a recent review in \[18\]).

In a different perspective, ecosystem services have been examined in
economic terms (see a major review in \[42\]), and several researchers
have attempted to calculate the value of nature\'s services in a variety
of ways. Among these would be the cost of infrastructure that needs to
be developed to substitute for the services of, for example, protective
coastal ecosystems, and the price of water treatment plants that can
play the role of wetlands in filtering contaminants \[43\]. Similarly,
one estimate is that [without mangroves flood damage in tropical coastal
areas would increase by more than 16%]{.underline} or \$US82 billion
annually. However, we emphasize that the fundamental value of ecosystems
in the intersection culture--[ecosystem functioning lies in that the
value of our life-supporting systems 'is essentially
incalculable']{.underline} \[18\].

This short review makes it [evident that humanity **cannot survive** in
the **absence** of biodiversity]{.underline} [and ecosystem
functioning]{.underline}, which, as we have discussed above, we are
increasingly degrading. Furthermore, the [prospect of Homo sapiens being
present when the normal recovery times following a mass extinction occur
is **simply unrealistic**]{.underline}. Finally, it is imperative to
appreciate that all these aspects of human dependence on
biodiversity---the intersection between human culture and ecosystem
services---occur at the level of the populations of the myriad species
and functional groups present where human populations are present.
[Therefore, it is crucial that we examine the impact of the human
enterprise on the myriad populations]{.underline} of plants, animals,
fungi and microorganisms.

#### Even minor disruptions [cascade]{.underline}.

Some have considered the end of the human lineage, mammals, and most
life reflecting geologic and cosmic time scales that are beyond
comprehension. If one accepts that we are but a small planet on the edge
of a galaxy, with unimaginably more galaxies and planets (around a
couple of trillion galaxies following the latest estimations, with each
galaxy containing several billion stars and with many stars hosting
planets), what does [life's extinguishment]{.underline} on Earth really
matter? We think that it [does]{.underline} indeed [matter]{.underline},
if only [from a perspective of **keeping maximal cosmic biod**iversity.
We]{.underline} also [have a moral obligation to try to remedy future
problems that]{.underline} may [threaten the **existence of humanity**
and life itself]{.underline}. And there are additional nonutilitarian
and utilitarian reasons unforeseen today. Regarding nonutilitarian
motivations, the possibility of intelligent life throughout the universe
is a subject of active debate among astrobiologists (e.g., see Mahecha
2016, Frank 2018), but thus far, there is no scientific evidence of
other life in the known universe. [Allowing for the only current
evidence of life in an inert universe to vanish is]{.underline}
therefore **[unacceptable]{.underline}**, if only [for ethical reasons.
Our **duty as a civilization** is to give empirical testament of the
process of evolution of life on Earth. Even in the event of the
discovery of new forms of life, we should shy away from inaction
and]{.underline} lame attitudes and [do our bit as a civilization to
**ensure disseminating the empirical example of the story of life on
Earth**]{.underline}. Second, from a utilitarian standpoint, [the
preservation of **biod**iversity on Earth]{.underline} and beyond [is a
**necessity** to give our species and the rest of existing biological
diversity a life-supporting system]{.underline}. This utilitarian view
may also have nonutilitarian consequences, because other extant or
[future emerging civilizations might be helped by the understanding of
our own biological]{.underline} or cultural evolution [processes. Under
both nonutilitarian and utilitarian views, **a plan to maintain
biod**iversity **indefinitely would be required**]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--Biodiversity\-\--Disease\-\--2NC

#### Biodiversity loss increases the risk of [zoonotic diseases]{.underline}

Felicia **Keesing** and Richard S. **Otsfeld 21**, Bard College Biology
and Cary Institute Ecosystem Studies, "Impacts of biodiversity and
biodiversity loss on zoonotic diseases,\" PNAS,
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2023540118

[Biodiversity as a Source of Zoonotic Pathogens]{.underline}

[Animals share]{.underline} their [pathogens with us the same
way]{.underline}s that [humans share]{.underline} their [pathogens with
each other]{.underline}. A pathogen might [travel from one host to
another in droplets or aerosols from coughs or sneezes; through blood,
urine, saliva, or other bodily fluids; through fecal material; or by
being transferred during the bite of a vector like a fly, mosquito, or
tick]{.underline}. In some cases, [the pathogen might linger on a
surface or in the environment so that a human might encounter the
pathogen without close proximity to]{.underline} the animal that was
[its source.]{.underline} The pathogen might not be able to infect the
human it contacts. Even if it can, the person's immune system might stop
the pathogen before it causes harm. But in some cases, **[the pathogen
is able to infect the]{.underline}** new **[human]{.underline}** host,
**[and]{.underline}** that person might in turn **[transmit the pathogen
to others]{.underline}**.

What factors determine whether a pathogen will spill over from an animal
into a human host and become established? [Cross-species transmission
results from a complex interplay between the characteristics of the
pathogen (2, 10⇓--12): the original host's infection, behavior, and
ecology; how the pathogen is shed into and survives in the environment;
how humans are exposed to the pathogen; and how susceptible those humans
are to infection]{.underline} (4, 12⇓⇓⇓--16).

Natural **[biodiversity]{.underline}**, and its loss, [can affect this
pathway at multiple points, potentially affecting the probability that a
new pathogen will become established in humans]{.underline}. Most
importantly, **[diverse communities]{.underline}** of host species can
**[serve as sources for new pathogens]{.underline}**, and it is this
role for biodiversity that has received the most attention in research
on disease emergence. [In the most common conceptual model linking
biodiversity to disease emergence, biodiversity is made up of species
that host a diversity of pathogens]{.underline} (SI Appendix), [any one
of which could have the characteristics enabling it to jump successfully
into humans]{.underline} (Fig. 1A) (7). Implicit in this model focusing
on total host diversity is the assumption that [**all** taxa are
**equally likely** to be sources of zoonotic pathogens]{.underline}.
Alternatively, [certain groups---such as bats, rodents, or
livestock---might be significantly more likely to serve as sources of
zoonotic pathogen]{.underline}s. In this "zoonotic host diversity"
model, the diversity of these hosts, but not total host biodiversity,
would be most important in determining the probability of zoonotic
emergence (Fig. 1B).

Alternative conceptual models linking host biodiversity to zoonotic
emergence in humans. (A) Total host diversity: In this model[, the
overall diversity of hosts leads to a pool of pathogens, any one of
which could jump to humans]{.underline}. Research assuming this model
typically involves comparisons of large geographic areas with innate
variation in biodiversity (e.g., along latitudinal gradients or between
countries). (B) Zoonotic host diversity: In this model, [some species
are more likely to host zoonotic pathogens, and it is the diversity of
these zoonotic hosts that is most important in determining the risk of
zoonotic emergence]{.underline}. Research using the zoonotic host
diversity model typically focuses on the distribution or characteristics
of a particular taxon (e.g., bats or primates). (C) Zoonotic host
diversity and abundance: In this model, [the diversity and the abundance
of zoonotic hosts determine the risk of zoonotic emergen]{.underline}ce.
Research using this model typically focuses on the effects of changes in
natural biodiversity (e.g., through human impacts, on zoonotic
pathogens). Modified from an illustration in Ostfeld and Keesing (7).

Researchers explicitly or implictly applying the "total host diversity"
model (Fig. 1A) tend to conduct broad geographic comparisons across
regions that differ in their innate levels of biodiversity. For example,
[in a seminal study]{.underline}, [Jones et al. (5) identified zoonotic
diseases that had emerged between 1940 and 2005, and mapped the most
likely locations of their underlying emergence. After attempting to
correct for potential spatial variation in reporting bias, Jones et al.
compared a suite of variables to see which best predicted the locations
of global zoonotic hotspots. Although zoonotic diseases arising from
wildlife were only ∼1% more likely to emerge where the diversity of wild
mammals was high, Jones et al. (5) concluded that "wildlife host species
richness is a significant predictor for the emergence of zoonotic EIDs
\[emerging infectious diseases\] with a wildlife origin, with no role
for human population growth, latitude or rainfall."]{.underline} Of note
was their observation that high human population density increased the
likelihood of the emergence of a zoonotic disease from wildlife by 75 to
90%, an effect almost two orders-of-magnitude greater than the effect of
mammalian diversity. Allen et al. (17) expanded this analysis,
incorporating more explanatory variables and new methods for estimating
reporting bias. After correcting for reporting bias, they found that
[mammal species richness had]{.underline} only [the fourth strongest
influence on the distribution of emerging infectious
diseases]{.underline}, after the presence of evergreen broadleaf trees
first, human population density second, and climate third.

In an ongoing effort to slow the destruction of nature, delegates at the
2022 United Nations Biodiversity Conference in Montreal, Canada, focused
on reversing the rapid decline of animals, plants and insects. The
conference, also known as COP15, worked towards a new global agreement
to protect biodiversity.

In a strongly worded opening address, UN Secretary-General António
Guterres told delegates that "[humanity has become a weapon of mass
extinction]{.underline}". Guterres piled further pressure on attendees
by describing the conference as "our chance to stop this orgy of
destruction".

The destruction to which Gueterres refers spans the globe and is
happening on a massive scale. According to a UN Global Land Outlook
assessment, more than 1 million species are now threatened with
extinction, vanishing at a rate not seen in 10 million years. As much as
40% of Earth\'s land surfaces are considered degraded.

Research by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature found
that [human activity for food production, **infrastructure, energy and
mining** accounts for **79% of the impact** on threatened
species.]{.underline}

\[Image Excluded\]

Creating a nature-positive economy

Only by fundamentally transforming these systems can we shift from
destructive human activity to a nature-positive economy. The World
Economic Forum's New Nature Economy Report II sets out a range of
transitions that will reverse nature loss and pull us back from the
brink. [Without these changes, the world will suffer irreversible
destruction of biodiversity that will have far-reaching impacts on the
economy and all life on Earth.]{.underline}

The report delivers a stark warning about the risks [we are creating by
destroying nature, stating that "**\$44 trillion** of economic value
generation -- over **half the world's** total GDP -- is potentially at
risk as a result of the dependence of business on nature and its
services".]{.underline}

[Biodiversity loss was ranked as the third **most severe threat**
humanity]{.underline} will face in the next 10 years in the World
Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2022.

#### Biodiversity is key for food security

**Bambridge-Sutton 24** \[Augustus Bambridge-Sutton; senior reporter for

vital to food security]{.underline}\"; FoodNavigator;

Accessed 6-30-2025; AY\]

[Biodiversity makes soil function effectively, pollinates plants and
ensures the functioning of the food system.]{.underline} But what\'s
being done to support biodiversity and is it too little too late?

As the COP16 summit in Cali, Colombia wraps up, it is increasingly clear
that biodiversity and food insecurity are intimately linked. Why is the
biological richness of the world so important to the food we eat?

Why is biodiversity so important to food?

\"To put it simply -- we rely on biodiversity to survive,\" Theodora
Ewer, Project Manager at Systemiq and the Food and Land Use Coalition
(FOLU) told FoodNavigator. [\"Species diversity plays a key role in
providing ecosystem services that support food systems, including
pollination, **natural pest control**, nutrient cycling, **soil
health**, and water retention. Genetic diversity within crop and
livestock species is equally important .]{.underline} This diversity
represents the range of genetic variations and breeds within species,
which enhances the adaptability of populations to environmental
pressures and breeding challenges.

\"For instance, [genetic diversity]{.underline} allows for the selection
of traits that [support survival under **extreme conditions**, such as
drought, heat, and salinity, and enables resistance to specific pests
and diseases.]{.underline} Dietary diversity is also enhanced by species
variety in food systems, as different species provide distinct
micronutrients necessary for human health.\"

["There is no human food without the food chain, from the smallest
microorganism transforming the inorganic to the organic to the largest
ruminants enhancing ecosystem functioning in the **largest terrestrial**
biome on earth -- grasslands]{.underline}," Simon Kraemer, policy
steward for regenerative agrifood systems at the European Alliance for
Regenerative Agriculture (EARA), told FoodNavigator.

"Indigenous food systems have stewarded ecosystems for biocultural
diversity increase for thousands of years. Since agriculture has become
exploitative with the use of ploughs and the segregation of plant and
animal cultivation, biodiversity has been decreasing the last 2000
years."

\"[Soil health is highly impacted by biodiversity, which in turn affects
the way plants grow,]{.underline}\" Tom Stuart, senior policy advisor at
the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), told FoodNavigator. "Soil is more
than just a lifeless material; it's a complex ecosystem full of living
things, or organisms. These organisms help soil function effectively,
making nutrients available to plants, forming structures that support
root growth, and regulate water flow to both [retain moisture in dry
weather and prevent flooding during heavy rain.]{.underline}

"Nature also provides essential 'ecosystem services',\" he continued,
\"like pollination, pest control, and waste decomposition. When
biodiversity decreases, these services are reduced, making it harder to
grow the food we rely on."

How does reduced biodiversity affect food security?

Without biodiversity, EARA's Kraemer told us, production will be more
fragile, crop diseases more prevalent, and food less nutritious.

Poor soil health impacts the food system in clear and significant ways,
WWF's Stuart told us. "Soil loss and degradation pose significant risks
to long-term food production, and in some cases, fields are already
unproductive -- such as with the 'wasted peat' issue. In 2024, the UK
saw its second-lowest yield for arable crops since records began in 1983
-- this is largely down to flooding.

"More resilient, better-structured soils that are adapted to climate
change would have reduced the impact of this extreme rainfall. In severe
cases, the collapse of local pollinator populations has forced some
Chinese growers to pollinate cherry trees by hand."

[A decline in biodiversity disrupts the ecosystem services biodiversity
provides us,]{.underline} Systemiq\'s Ewer told us. \"[In the absence of
these **critical ecosystem** functions, farmers often become reliant on
a narrower range of crops,]{.underline} increasing the likelihood of
farmer adoption of monocultural production systems -- [which themselves
further reduce bio-diversity]{.underline} - and necessitating the
increased use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Increased chemical
application then further exacerbates biodiversity loss, soil
degradation, pollution, economic losses, and adverse health outcomes.

\"With fewer species and genetic varieties available, agricultural
systems become more vulnerable to pests, diseases, and the impacts of
climate change. [The resulting lack of diversity means that crop failure
in one species can have widespread repercussions, potentially leading to
**severe food shortages** and heightened food insecurity.\"]{.underline}

[The loss of biodiversity can interact with or **exacerbate
conflict**]{.underline} (see figure 3). There are many anecdotal
examples of this relationship, but the processes are often indirect and
interconnected with other contributing factors. [In most cases,
biodiversity loss amplifies stress in situations with existing conflict
and social tension or other socioeconomic vulnerabilities.34 In such
cases, biodiversity loss can contribute to **livelihood insecurity**,
which leads to maladaptive migration and so puts additional pressures on
natural resources already used by receiving communities.]{.underline}
This might result in conflict and violence. [Environmental degradation
and biodiversity loss can also reduce the number of available migration
alternatives]{.underline}, 'trapping' communities in places with poor
livelihood options. This might exacerbate existing local conflicts and
resource competition. [Biodiversity loss resulting from environmental
damage or degradation can reduce the availability of, and access to,
natural resources that are of key livelihood importance.]{.underline}
When society is generally peaceful and functional, such reduced
availability might not be so keenly felt. However, [in times of conflict
or social tension, it may initiate further **cycles of
violence**.35]{.underline} In addition, long-standing and unresolved
competition for resources and land can act as a latent risk factor at
all levels of society, from communities up to states. When biodiversity
is already in decline[, these conflicts are activated and can escalate
into violence. Biodiversity loss can also drive conflict in more
indirect ways.]{.underline} For example, the Netherlands has been
struggling with high emissions of nitrogen, primarily from agriculture,
which has breached European Union (EU) directives on preserving
vulnerable habitats and is threatening the country's biodiversity.36
Yet, moves by the Dutch government to dramatically limit nitrogen
emissions in the agricultural sector have been met with extensive
protests by farmers. In other instances, authoritarian environmentalism
and nature protection have been linked to local conflicts in many
locations. In India, for example, consideration of livelihood uses has
historically been excluded in the name of biodiversity protection.37

[Overfishing of herring resulted in an estimated 97% biomass decline
from the 1950s]{.underline} to the 1980s, according to one study, which
found populations have since made a modest recovery. North Sea
anglerfish and cod are among fish populations in a "deeply troubling
state", [a 2023 report found, while demersal fish -- species living
close to the sea floor -- have declined by 23% since 1993, according to
the state of nature 2023 report. But in recent years, a bounceback in
some wildlife has given conservationists reason for **cautious
optimism**.]{.underline}

"The [North Sea is one of the most pressured areas of ocean]{.underline}
on planet Earth. There are relatively few other places that have a
combination of industrialised countries around a largely enclosed sea,
intensive agriculture, and pressures from fishing going back centuries.
But the wonderful thing about nature is that it can recover pretty
quickly if you give it the chance," says Juniper.

Bottlenose dolphins, along with humpback and minke whales, have been
spotted in greater numbers in recent years along England's North Sea
coast, monitoring groups say. Their reasons for returning are not
entirely clear. Grey seals -- once in danger of disappearing around the
UK -- are flourishing. Visits to colonies on Norfolk beaches -- where
thousands of pups are born every year -- have become a Christmas ritual
for local people. Around the beach at Horsey, [nearly 4,000 seal pups
were born last year during a record-breaking season.]{.underline}

"We know the grey seals are doing well, which is fantastic news, and we
know that's also true of other species in the North Sea," says Bex
Lynam, marine advocacy manager for North Sea Wildlife Trusts.
"[Bottlenose dolphins -- which we weren't seeing]{.underline} off the
Yorkshire coast [until the last five years -- have been recorded in a
huge number of sightings]{.underline}. It's clear they have enough food.
They are also calving down here, which is fantastic," she says.

Lynam credits the [impact of growing protections for nature]{.underline}
in the North Sea, [such as new marine protected areas and increased
controls on fishing.]{.underline} In April, the UK and Scottish
governments announced a ban on commercial sandeel fishing in the North
Sea in an effort to [help other marine species recover.]{.underline}
Sandeels are a leading food source for puffins, kittiwakes and other
bird species, many of which are suffering significant population
declines. They are also a food source for many of the fish humans
regularly eat. This ban is being contested by the EU.

New research shows that the [loss of biodiversity can increase the risk
of "extinction cascades",]{.underline} where an [initial species loss
leads to a domino effect of further extinctions]{.underline}.

The researchers, from the University of Exeter, showed there is a
[higher risk of extinction cascades when other species are not present
to fill the "gap" created by the loss of a species]{.underline}.

Even if the loss of one species does not directly cause knock-on
extinctions, the study shows that this leads to simpler [ecological
communities that are at greater risk of "run-away extinction
cascades]{.underline}" with the potential loss of many species.

With extinction rates at their highest levels ever and numerous species
under threat due to human activity, the findings are a further warning
about the consequences of eroding biodiversity.

"Interactions between species are important for ecosystem (a community
of interacting species) stability," said Dr Dirk Sanders, of the Centre
for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter's Penryn Campus
in Cornwall. "And because species are interconnected through multiple
interactions, an impact on one species can affect others as well.

"It has been predicted that more complex [food webs will be less
vulnerable to extinction cascades]{.underline} because there is a
greater chance that other species can step in and buffer against the
effects of species loss.

"In our experiment, we used communities of plants and insects to test
this prediction."

The researchers removed one species of wasp and found that it led to
secondary extinctions of other, indirectly linked, species at the same
level of the food web.

This effect was much stronger in simple communities than for the same
species within a more complex food web.

Dr Sanders added: "Our results demonstrate that [biodiversity loss can
increase the vulnerability of ecosystems to secondary extinctions which,
when they occur, can then lead to further simplification causing
run-away extinction cascades]{.underline}."

The study, supported by France's Sorbonne Université, is published in
the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The paper is entitled: "Trophic redundancy reduces vulnerability to
extinction cascades."

How extinction cascades work

The loss of a predator can initiate a cascade, such as [in the case of
wolves, where their extinction on one mountain can cause a large rise in
the number of deer]{.underline}. [This larger number of deer then eats
more plant material than they would have before]{.underline}. This
[reduction in vegetation can cause extinctions in any
species]{.underline} [that also relies on the plants,]{.underline} but
are potentially less competitive, such as rabbits or insects.

While [IPCC reports]{.underline} are virtually [unanimous in confirming
the primary influence of human activities on]{.underline} contemporary
[climate change]{.underline}, changes in the Earth's climate occur,
naturally, in the absence of human intervention, and they display
significant [fluctuation throughout the history of the
planet]{.underline}: the Precambrian period, for example, reached
temperatures of 9 °C higher than today, while five known major
glaciations have occurred over the entirety of Earth's climate history
(Stager, 2011). Non-anthropogenic climate forcings are due both to
astronomical forces---such as the amount of radiation coming from the
Sun and cyclical variations of Earth's orbit (the above-mentioned
Milankovitch cycles)---and geological forces---such as tectonic activity
and continental shift, volcanic activity and the creation and gradual
disappearance of mountain ranges. Such forces, however, operate along a
timescale that American palaeontologist Jay Gould (1987) defines as
'deep time', and human activities (at least thus far) are unable to
change either the overall amount of incoming solar radiation, or its
geographical distribution.

However, [much more rapid changes are due to the influence that ice
sheets, cloud formations and forest coverage exert on the Earth's
albedo]{.underline} (a measure of the reflection of solar radiation).
More importantly, they are [due to the **quantity of**]{.underline}
so-called **[greenhouse gases present]{.underline}** in the atmosphere,
[which trap]{.underline} the [radiation emitted by the Earth back into
the cosmos and]{.underline} thus tend to [warm the
atmosphere]{.underline}. 10 While [astronomical and geological
forces]{.underline} alone [have been **unable to explain**]{.underline}
the **[rapid changes in global surface temperature]{.underline}**
observed **[over the past two centuries]{.underline}**, computer-based
[climate models have justified]{.underline} the [observed warming by
including]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions]{.underline} in the
calculations. Ongoing climate observations, combined with both
computer-based climate models and paleoclimate studies, have thus
unequivocally confirmed that recent changes in global surface
temperature are both unusual and are caused by a sudden change of the
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.11

[The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is]{.underline}, therefore, [a
**good indicator** of the current state of the Earth's
climate]{.underline}. Hansen indicates that the ideal upward CO 2 limit
is 350 parts per million (ppm---a figure revised down from an initial
450), a number later popularized by American environmentalist Bill
McKibben's initiative 350.org. The most current observations (2024) from
the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, however, mark atmospheric CO2 at
over 426 ppm. While the increase is certainly troubling, the rate of the
increase is even more staggering: CO 2 atmospheric concentration
increased from 280 ppm in 1750 (where they had likely hovered since the
end of the last ice age) to 387 ppm in 2009, with an increase of 100 ppm
over 250 years, and a further increase of another 40 ppm over the last
fifteen years alone. If any doubts were left as to the magnitude of
anthropogenic influence on the quantity of greenhouse gases in the
atmosphere, the forced changes in production, transportation and
consumption patterns caused by the 2020 COVID-19 global pandemic showed
an overall decrease of more than 17% of daily CO2 emissions during the
period of forced confinement in the first half of the year (LeQuéré et
al., 2020). [Current changes in global temperature are]{.underline} thus
[**unequivocally** caused by emissions]{.underline} of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere [due to human activities, such as burning of fossil
fuels and extensive **defo**restation]{.underline}. Curt Stager suggests
that, depending on the amount of carbon ultimately released in the
atmosphere, a return to its pre-industrial amounts may take between
400,000 and 500,000 years (2011, 42). 12

It may be worth considering, at this point, what these numbers mean for
humanity. Earth's surface temperature makes the existence of life
possible. However, [life in general and human life in
particular]{.underline}---and even more so the lifestyle of the most
widespread human cultures of today---[depend on]{.underline} very
specific '**[goldilocks]{.underline}**' **[conditions]{.underline}**. 13
[Too cold or too hot a surface temperature and **major extinction events
occur**]{.underline}, and no life appears to exist under the hothouse
conditions of Venus (above 700 °C) or in the gelid coldness of space.
Life, as it is defined by science and as far as current science can
determine, only exists within a relatively narrow range of habitable
temperatures. [This range is narrower for the existence of human
life]{.underline}, and [it is even more **narrow for the continued
existence of civilization** in its current from]{.underline}.
Anthropologist Stanley Ambrose (1998) suggests that the [sudden cooling
caused by]{.underline} the [Mount Toba]{.underline} explosion of 70,000
years ago [nearly drove human populations to extinction]{.underline}.14
Moreover, archaeologist Brian Fagan (2008) documents how [agricultural
civilization is the result of a temporarily mild and stable interglacial
climate]{.underline}, while Hansen (2009, 39) notes how the [unusual
stability of sea levels over the past 7000 years contributed to the
development of complex agricultural societies]{.underline}, whereby food
yields provided by stable seaside settlements could sustain large
numbers of non-food producing social roles.15 On the other hand, the
medieval climatic optimum, which allowed the establishment of Viking
settlements in Iceland and Greenland, was followed, from mid-fifteenth
century until mid-nineteenth century, by a 'little ice age', a cooler
period marked by harsh winters, cold and wet summers, and a surge in
alpine glaciers, as well as significant social disruptions.16

Paleoclimatologist William Ruddiman (2003) argues that
[anthropogenic]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions]{.underline},
beginning with the establishment of agriculture some thousands of years
ago and accelerating exponentially over the last century or two, [have
disrupted the cycles that led to the ice ages that have marked the
Quaternary period]{.underline} (the current geological period). 17
Hansen agrees, noting that '[human-made climate forcings]{.underline}
added in just the past several decades alre[ady dwarf the natural
forcings associated with the Little Ice Age]{.underline}' (2011, 9) and
'a single chlorofluorocarbon factory would be more than sufficient to
overcome any natural tendency toward an ice age' (37). Without
sufficient policies to mitigate climate change, current projections
suggest an overall increase in global mean temperature by 2100 of
3.7--4.8 °C relative to pre-industrial levels.

Will Steffen et al. (2015) have called the present situation the Great
Acceleration, '[the steep, exponential rise in]{.underline} global
greenhouse gas [emissions and]{.underline} indeed [the overall human
imprint on the Earth system]{.underline} which has distinguished the
second half of the twentieth century and beyond' (Rogers, 2020a, 2020b,
95), also speculating as to whether such an acceleration [will culminate
in a **Great Collapse**. This rate of change, measured in
decades]{.underline} (rather than tens of thousands of years) [and
occurring at an **unprecedented speed**]{.underline} that no natural
process can explain, [led]{.underline} ecologist Eugene Stoermer
[to]{.underline} coin---and atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen to
popularize---[the]{.underline} term [Anthropocene]{.underline} to define
[a geological epoch in which humanity itself has become a veritable
geological force]{.underline} (Trischler, 2016). 18

Far from being cause for celebration, [human activities run
the]{.underline} significant [risk of generating a **cascade of positive
feedback loops**, causing the **crossing of irreversible tipping
points** beyond which the stability of the Earth's temperature cannot be
further controlled. One such tipping point is the **sudden release of
methane**]{.underline} (a more potent greenhouse gas than CO 2 ) in the
atmosphere, largely as a result of the release of large methane
clathrate deposits [currently locked in permafrost]{.underline}, oceanic
muds and peatlands. 19 To an almost unanimous scientific community, the
patterns are clear: a [release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
capable of increasing the temperature]{.underline} by about 6 °C
(something which humans are capable of doing faster than the PETM event,
over a mere few centuries) [is likely to trigger a **cascade effect** of
releasing methane locked in ice, increasing the temperature]{.underline}
of another 6 °C [and]{.underline} potentially [leading to]{.underline} a
**[mass extinction]{.underline}**. This is known as the 'clathrate gun
scenario', a hypothesis suggesting that [runaway climate change may
occur **much faster** **and**]{.underline} much **[more irrevocably than
currently predicted]{.underline}** (Hartmann, 2013, 30). [Other tipping
points]{.underline}, identified, for example, by Tim Flannery (2006),
are [the collapse of the Gulf Stream]{.underline}, capable of [causing
rapid and dramatic cooling]{.underline} in large parts of Europe and
North America, [and the destruction of the Amazon
rainforests]{.underline}.

Most of [these]{.underline} events [are likely to occur both **suddenly
and rapidly**]{.underline}, 'with speed and violence' in the words of
climate journalist Fred Pearce (2007). James Hansen captured the
predicament in dismal, albeit somewhat poetic, terms:

> [Humanity treads]{.underline} today [on a **slippery
> slope**]{.underline}. As we continue to pump greenhouse gases into the
> air, we move onto a steeper, even more slippery incline. We seem
> **[oblivious to the danger]{.underline}** -- unaware how close we may
> be to a situation in which [a catastrophic slip becomes **practically
> unavoidable**]{.underline}, a slip where [we suddenly lose all control
> and are pulled into a torrential stream that hurls us over a precipice
> to our demise]{.underline} (2009, 70)

Over the history of life on Earth, there have been five major
extinctions (i.e. events marked by the reduction of over 65% of existing
species, with a recovery rate measurable in millions of years), all due
to significant and relatively sudden changes in the Earth's temperature
(Sepkoski & Raup, 1982). 20 [One of the risks of climate
change]{.underline}, therefore, [is]{.underline} what some scientists
have termed [the]{.underline} '**[sixth extinction]{.underline}**', [a
major decrease of life's overall biodiversity]{.underline} (Leakey &
Levin, 1996). It is important to note that the [collapse of biodiversity
is likely to cause a **cascading collapse** of a multiplicity of
lifeforms, **including humans**]{.underline}; as a result, [the
maintenance of biodiversity is necessary for humanity's own survival,
and]{.underline} thus, [the **threat of a potential mass extinction is a
threat to humanity itself**]{.underline}.

[The global system is actively generating **latent risk**]{.underline}.
For example, [beyond its immediate impacts, climate change could hamper
humanity's ability to recover from **other catastrophes**]{.underline}
(Kemp et al., 2022). More generally, [if any]{.underline} of the [global
critical systems on which humanity depends on were to fail]{.underline}
(Avin et al., 2018), [this might trap us in a state where that system
**could not be regenerated**, and would]{.underline} also **[decrease
our]{.underline}** species' [**resilience** to further catastrophes,
such as **human extinction**]{.underline}. If increasing sociotechnical
complexity leads to the loss of simpler alternatives (Manheim, 2020; see
also Section 3.3), this present-day trend increases the latent risk in
such scenarios. To illustrate these issues while maintaining a focus on
the worst-case outcomes, we now consider how [systemic risk would
manifest after global societal collapse]{.underline} (noting that any
reasoning about post-collapse worlds is necessarily speculative).

After a collapse, emergent phenomena might trap the system in the
collapsed state. Various theories of human civilisational development --
i.e. the development of the global system -- emphasise the role of
amplifying feedbacks. For example, the industrial revolution may have
been substantially driven by feedback cycles that rapidly increased
human access to energy (Lenton & Scheffer, 2024). However, [if the
global system were to collapse and advanced **tech**nology were to be
lost, it is not clear that this pattern could be repeated, because
most]{.underline} easily accessible [fossil fuels would have been used
up]{.underline} (Baum et al., 2019; Belfield, 2023).12 [If amplifying
feedbacks initially propelled the global system to its present state,
the **lack of** such **feedbacks**]{.underline} -- and thus, a dominance
of stabilising feedbacks -- [could **prevent
re-industrialisation**]{.underline} after a collapse.

After a collapse, [emergent phenomena could]{.underline} also
[**substantially increase the risk of human extinction**. Without
industrial]{.underline} methods of [food production, the global
population would fall]{.underline} to a substantially lower level [and
may]{.underline} also [become geographically disconnected. Surviving
human populations could]{.underline} then [face **non-linear ecological
dynamics**]{.underline} akin to those faced by non-human species (May,
1977; Scheffer et al., 2001), [including **runaway extinction** if
population numbers fall below a minimum]{.underline} size.13 Crucially,
[minimum viable population sizes are]{.underline} often [set by the
influence of population size on the ability to effectively
cooperate]{.underline} (Stephens & Sutherland, 1999) [and
may]{.underline} thus [be much higher than those predicted purely on the
basis of genetics]{.underline} (Baum et al., 2019). While complete human
extinction remains a high bar, one key point is worth emphasising:
[because of latent risk and emergent phenomena, a given catastrophe
**does not need to make Earth completely uninhabitable to ultimately
lead to human extinction**]{.underline}.

### Impact\-\--Climate\-\--Weather\-\--2NC

#### Warming disrupts three jet streams that cause [devastating]{.underline} and [persistent]{.underline} weather disasters

**AC 24** \[Arctic Council, high-level intergovernmental forum that
addresses issues faced by the Arctic governments and the indigenous
people of the Arctic region. \"Shifting Winds: How a wavier polar jet
stream causes extreme weather events\", 10-28-2024,

accessed 7-1-2025\] /vzhu

True to its name, [the **polar jet stream**]{.underline} can shave some
30-45 minutes off your transatlantic flight going from North America to
Europe. The high-altitude wind current, circulating the Northern
Hemisphere at the height commercial airplanes travel, [has acted as a
**reliable barrier** between icy Arctic and warmer southern air. But
**climate change** is **disrupting** the wind system, and the once
relatively stable waves of the polar jet stream are now more often
**plunging** **deeper** and climbing higher, leading to severe
**consequences** for **billions** of people.]{.underline}

The polar jet stream is a river of wind, [flowing from the West to the
East and encircling the **Northern Hemisphere**.]{.underline} Its
meandering waves create a boundary between the cold Arctic air and the
warmer air to the South. Yet, with the [Arctic warming **three times
faster** than the average for rest of the world, the **temperature
difference** between North and South **decreases** and so does the
**speed** of the jet stream's westerly winds.]{.underline} As these
winds slow down, its [waves]{.underline} typically [grow bigger and
**extend farther** to the North and the South. Larger jet-stream waves
move eastward more **slowly**, affecting **weather patterns** across
North America to Central Europe and Asia.]{.underline}

"The [big swings of the jet stream tend to be **very** **persistent**
and to stay in the same place for a long time]{.underline}. As each wave
brings either warm or cold air to a region, [this slow movement can
cause **extreme weather patterns**, such as heat waves, floods, cold
spells, storms and droughts -- and we are seeing these wavey patterns
happen more frequently]{.underline}", explains [Dr. Jennifer Francis,
**senior atmospheric scientist** at the Woodwell Climate Research
Center.]{.underline}

On the right (or wrong) side of the wave

[The archipelago of Svalbard experienced the **coldest winter** in 20
years in 2024, followed by]{.underline} a persistent warm-up and quick
disappearance of sea ice in spring, leading to yet [another
**record-breaking** warm]{.underline} [summer. This has a direct
correlation with the stream's wild north-south swings]{.underline}, says
Dr. Francis. While parts of the Arctic, including Svalbard and Northern
Norway, recorded the warmest month (Longyearbyen, Svalbard: an average
of 11 degree Celsius in August at 78°N) and most summer days above 20
degrees Celsius (Tromsø, Norway: 36 days compared to an average of 12),
[Central Europe saw **devastating floods** in later summer, impacting
**2 million people** on the continent.]{.underline}

"These [extremes come in **pairs**]{.underline}. While [one region might
experience abnormally **warm** temperatures, you just need to look to
the east, downstream, and you will likely face the **opposite** weather
conditions.]{.underline} Whether you are experiencing a dry spell or
flooding, largely depends on where on the trajectory of the polar jet
stream waves are placed relative to you: If you are located on the [part
of a wave where the winds come down from the northwest,]{.underline}
you\'re typically looking at [dry conditions and clear blue
skies]{.underline}", shares Dr. Francis. [On the other side of that
wave, southwestly winds bring warmth and moisture]{.underline}, which
tend to [form storms]{.underline}. "So, you can look at the location of
the jet stream and get a pretty good idea of how your weather will
behave in the near future."

Warm oceans, bigger jet stream waves

In addition to the rapidly warming Arctic, another reason for the jet
stream becoming wavier is the drastic warming of the midlatitude oceans,
Dr. Francis theorizes. "The oceans are absorbing much of the heat
trapped by greenhouse gases -- up to 90 percent. Across the North
Pacific and the Atlantic, we have observed record-breaking water
temperatures over the past years".

[In the **higher latitudes**,]{.underline} the [warming is]{.underline}
even more [pronounced. In only 40 years, about **75 percent** of sea-ice
volume has been lost. As the sea ice retreats and thins, it provides
**less** of a **barrier** for the ocean's heat to enter the air, which
further contributes to the warming.]{.underline}

[Dr. Francis also emphasizes the role of **water vapor**]{.underline}
and wrote in a 2018 Scientific American article: "Scientists and Arctic
residents often fail to appreciate the [strong effects that the extra
moisture can create.]{.underline} For starters, [water vapor is a
greenhouse gas, so in a dry Arctic winter atmosphere, a little more
**moisture** can **trap** substantially more heat]{.underline}.
Moreover, [when that moisture **condenses into clouds**, it releases
latent heat, further warming the air]{.underline}. Finally, [more clouds
trap more warmth below them, one more factor contributing to the
**Arctic meltdown**]{.underline}." \[1\]

Add to this the [jet stream's more extensive north-south
**oscillation**, which has brought pulses of record warmth and moisture
to the high latitudes]{.underline}, and you are beginning to [piece
together]{.underline} the complex picture of **[Arctic
amplification.]{.underline}**

Record after Record, altering Weather Worldwide. Scientific American,
April 2018.

The interplay of wind systems

In addition to the polar jet stream, there is [also a **subtropical jet
stream** in the Northern Hemisphere]{.underline}. While the polar jet
stream affects weather patterns in the mid-latitudes, through the United
States to Europe, its [southern equivalent has more influence on areas
between the equator and 30 degrees North. "Sometimes these two jet
streams **interact**, layer on top of each other;]{.underline} and when
they do, we tend to [get the really **big storms**]{.underline}. That is
[because the subtropical jet stream brings **tropical** **heat** and
moisture in contact with very cold **Arctic** **air**]{.underline},"
describes Dr. Francis.

It\'s a complex system and, as Dr. Francis explains, the two wind
systems form for different reasons and respond differently to climate
change. "It's all very interesting. We still have a lot of questions
about how these wind systems will change and in turn influence our
weather."

[In wintertime, a third circling stream joins the scene: The
**stratospheric polar vortex**. This pool of cold air sits over the
North Pole only during winter months, **way above** the jet stream (30
kilometers versus 10).]{.underline} It starts to form in late autumn and
usually spins around the top of the world -- not bothering anybody, as
Dr. Francis puts it.

[A **wobbling** polar vortex causing **deadly freezing**
events]{.underline}

"[Normally]{.underline}, the polar vortex has [little influence on our
weather, but every once in a while,]{.underline} the [it stretches into
a bean shape, or it **splits** into two or three pockets]{.underline}.
When that happens, those [**smaller pools** of cold air can descend
southward and reinforce a dip in the jet stream, making a **cold spell**
**much worse**]{.underline}."

This is exactly what [happened in **Texas** in February
2021,]{.underline} when the [U.S. state recorded the **longest freezing
streak** in its history]{.underline}. Lasting for [almost 9 full
days]{.underline}, the Great Texas Freeze saw [temperatures drop below
-26 degrees Celsius and cause a power outage that left **millions

While [polar vortex splits]{.underline} happen naturally, researchers
like Dr. Francis are observing these events [more **frequently**
now]{.underline}. "We think one of the [reason]{.underline}s it\'s
happening more often [is the **loss of sea ice**,]{.underline}
especially in the [Barents-Kara-Sea area east of
**Svalbard**]{.underline}. This is [one of the **fastest warming**
places in the Arctic]{.underline} and it's [located right underneath the
westerly winds of the polar vortex. It creates]{.underline} like [a
**bubble of hot air** over the region, which can cause the spinning
vortex to wobble, stretch and ultimately to break apart]{.underline}".

The future jet stream -- and the chances of getting it back on track

When asked how she thinks the polar jet stream will change in the
future, Dr. Francis predicts that [wavier jet-stream patterns, causing
more persistent weather regimes, will occur more often. "That's bad
news, because it means that we will see more droughts, more heat waves,
more wildland fires, more flooding." All of these effects are connected
to unusual and persistent weather patterns]{.underline}. "The underlying
message here is that [we are going to see weather regimes becoming more
persistent, leading to extremes that result from long-lived weather
conditions]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [we are going to experience even
more extreme events and record-breaking conditions that will affect
billions of people]{.underline} across the Northern Hemisphere," Dr.
Francis warns.

So, is there a possibility of getting the jet stream back on track?
"[The disease that needs to be treated is the build-up of heat-trapping
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are mainly coming from burning
fossil fuels,]{.underline} but also from cutting down forests and
removing wetlands", Dr. Francis emphasizes. "[We've got all the tools,
we just need the will of people, governments and communities to embrace
the goal.]{.underline} In the meantime, we have to prepare for the
changes that we know are coming."

[Barriers to adaptation in the Arctic parallel]{.underline} many of [the
challenges facing adaptation]{.underline} in diverse regions [globally.
This includes]{.underline} the existence of pressing [**socioeconomic
problems, institutional** and **governmental barriers, limited knowledge
of future climate risks and effectiveness** of potential adaptations,
**uncertainty**, **demographic shifts, lack of financial resources, bias
to mitigation** in climate policy, and **limited decision-making
power**]{.underline} at local levels (Berman et al., 2020; Birchall &
Bonnett, 2020; Labbe et al., 2017; Olsen et al., 2021). [In
Alaska]{.underline}, for example, [the need to relocate high risk
villages has been recognized]{.underline} by researchers,
decision-makers, and communities for sometime, and while progress is
being made in some locations (Ristroph, 2017), [institutional barriers
have resulted in negligible progress]{.underline} overall (Albert et
al., 2018). Among the Yamal-Nenets reindeer pastoralists, fishing bans
have reduced the flexibly of herders to survive reindeer loss due to
back-to-back stresses (e.g., anthrax outbreak, icing events) by
temporarily turning to fishing due, a traditional coping mechanism
(Stammler & Ivanova, 2020). In the Arctic Ocean, [managing
the]{.underline} potential [expansion of fisheries in international
waters is currently limited by gaps in regulatory frameworks for
fisheries outside of national legislated zones]{.underline} (Crepin et
al., 2017). Notwithstanding these barriers, the capacity of governance
systems in the Arctic to respond to climate change has strengthened
recently (Meredith et al., 2019). For Indigenous Peoples, advances in
self-government, land claims, and resource management particularly in
the North American Arctic provide a strong basis for responding to
climate impacts (Robards et al., 2018; Vogel & Bullock, 2020). These
developments expand the solution space for responding to climate
impacts, although the colonial-basis of government and institutions
continues to perpetuate vulnerability and limit Indigenous
self-governance (Ford et al., 2020; Snook et al., 2020).

#### Waiting too long to adapt causes [overreactions]{.underline}, locking in our impacts.

Climate change is inherently tractable and we already have the
technologies we need to stop creating it, albeit without the
institutions to fairly distribute them with a sufficient level of
urgency. However, responding to risks like climate change can incur
risks of its own. Indeed, the IPCC, in its risk concept notes to the
sixth assessment report, does not just discuss the usual three
determinants of risk, hazard, vulnerability, and exposure, but also
identifies "response risks".21 Others have suggested that response
should be added to the classic list of determinants.22 In some cases,
responses may be far worse than the initial perceived risk, that is,
they are iatrogenic: the treatment is worse than the disease.

Existential risk is especially prone to response risks due to its scale,
severity, and often speculative nature. For instance, at the extreme a
speculative fear of dispersed weapons of mass destruction could justify
a mass surveillance state.23 In general, there is always the potential
for concerns over global risk to justify a Stomp Reflex --- the abuse of
emergency powers which inappropriately empower those atop a hierarchy
and shield them from scrutiny. 24 This is also true for climate change

Reacting to climate change could lead to emergency responses, such as
stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), in an attempt to manipulate the
quantity of solar radiation hitting the earth and thus counter some of
the impacts of climate change. Existing data on the direct impacts of
SAI and its contribution to systemic risk or triggering other hazards is
sparse. Preliminary analysis suggests that the greatest problem is the
latent risks of "termination shock". If a calamity such as a nuclear war
deactivates the system for a prolonged time, then this could
significantly accelerate warming. Hence SAI shifts the risk distribution
by likely lowering the level of risk in an average scenario but
fattening the tail or "worst-case" scenarios depending on how SAI is
deployed, to what degree it is used, and what geopolitical and
ecological world it is dispersed into.25 On the other hand, there are
also frequently neglected co-benefits of climate mitigation policies,
such as the public health benefits of eliminating coal smoke and other
pollutants from our air.26

Such problems of response risk are perhaps the most neglected. Yet they
are precisely what the study of existential risk needs to grapple with.
This could include by using robust decision-making procedures, such as
the minimax principle, to aid in selecting policy options under
uncertainty or using deliberative democratic processes to combine
diverse perspectives and co-create effective policy responses.

Science warns us that [**each incremental rise** in global warming can
aggravate compound and concurrent climate hazards. Compound climate
extremes occur when multiple climate-related events]{.underline} (e.g.,
[**heatwaves, fires, droughts**, and **floods**]{.underline}) [occur
simultaneously or consecutively]{.underline}, intensifying their
impacts. These [hazards]{.underline} can [exacerbate vulnerabilities in
ecosystems, economies, and societies, leading to **cascading** and
**amplified risks**]{.underline}. Due to climate change, they are
becoming more frequent and severe (EUCRA (2024), IPCC (2023) and Raymond
et al. (2023)). [Compound risks are]{.underline} characterized by
[**complex, non-linear interactions**, making their effects]{.underline}
on society and the economy [difficult to predict]{.underline}. Unlike
individual shocks, the impacts of compound events cannot simply be
quantified. These [interactions]{.underline} can [amplify]{.underline}
the severity of [climate-related shocks, creating **disproportionate
consequences**]{.underline}. Such [amplification poses significant
challenges for **financial stability**]{.underline} and monetary policy,
as [traditional models struggle to account for]{.underline} the
[cascading and interconnected nature of these risks]{.underline}. This
may lead to the underestimation of their impacts (NGFS (2023)).

\*TR = Time Reversability

1\. Introduction

According to the most recent International Panel on Climate Change
report, [humanity is unlikely to prevent global warming]{.underline} by
1.5◦ above pre-industrial levels. [Still, **aggressive curbing**
of]{.underline} greenhouse-gas [emissions]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
carbon [extraction]{.underline} from the atmosphere **[could limit its
rise]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} even **[bring it back
down]{.underline}** (IPCC (2022)). But [this window is]{.underline}
**[rapidly closing]{.underline}**, and, [above]{.underline} the [1.5◦
limits]{.underline}, [the chances of tipping points,]{.underline}
extreme weather, [and ecosystem collapse **will become even more
sizeable**]{.underline}.

An environmental tipping point is when [small changes]{.underline} in
the environment **[might trigger larger]{.underline}**, abrupt, and
**[irreversible changes]{.underline}** [and lead to cascading
effects]{.underline}. Recent IPCC assessments suggest that [tipping
points can be achieved between]{.underline} **[1]{.underline}**◦ [and
**2**]{.underline}◦ **[of warming]{.underline}**. Therefore, [they are
likely to arise at current]{.underline} emissions [levels]{.underline}
if they have not already occurred. Well-known [tipping points
concern]{.underline} the Greenland and the West Antarctic **[ice
sheets]{.underline}**, the Atlantic **[Meridional Overturning
Circulation]{.underline}** (AMOC), **[thawing permafrost]{.underline}**,
ENSO, [and the]{.underline} Amazon **[rainforest]{.underline}**. Recent
evidence suggests that [melting ice sheets is accelerating]{.underline}
because of warming temperatures, less snowfall, and ocean warming. Some
studies suggest that [irreversible disintegration]{.underline} of the
Greenland ice sheet [could occur]{.underline} at global temperature
warming [between 0.8◦ and 3.2◦]{.underline} above pre-industrial levels
(Wunderling et al. (2021)). An unstoppable [ice sheet
melting]{.underline} in Antarctica would also be triggered by global
warming exceeding 2◦ (DeConto et al. (2021)). Current ice sheets melting
also [add fresh water]{.underline} to the North Atlantic, weakening the
AMOC, one of the main global [ocean currents]{.underline}. The AMOC is
already in its weakest state in 1,000 years (Caesar et al. (2021)). Its
[shut down]{.underline} **[would cause significant
cooling]{.underline}** along the US east coast and Western Europe, alter
rainfall [and cause more drying]{.underline}. [A 50%
weakening]{.underline} of AMOC **[could be caused by
continued]{.underline}** global **[warming]{.underline}** by 2100, and a
tipping point could be reached between 3◦ and 5.5◦ of warming.

Moreover, the Arctic is warming twice as faster as the planet on
average, and it has already warmed 2◦, causing [permafrost
thawing]{.underline}, which [releases CO2 and methane]{.underline} into
the atmosphere. Available **[estimates point to 1400 billion
tons]{.underline}** of carbon [frozen]{.underline} in the Arctic's
permafrost, **[twice as much carbon]{.underline}** already [in the
atmosphere]{.underline}, and a 2◦ of global warming could even cause the
thawing of 40% of the world's permafrost. The El Ni ̃no-Southern
Oscillation or ENSO cycle is an oscillating warming and cooling pattern
affecting rainfall intensity and tropics' temperatures. It can strongly
influence weather in many parts of the globe. El Ni ̃no and La Ni ̃na
are the warm and cool phases of the ENSO cycle, respectively. Oceans
[warming]{.underline} can [trigger a tipping point in]{.underline} the
[ENSO]{.underline} cycle, [increasing]{.underline} its [variability and
intensity]{.underline} and shifting its teleconnection eastward (Cai et
al. (2021)). **[Extreme rainfalls and droughts]{.underline}** in various
parts of the world, not only at the Tropic**[, can then follow from
the]{.underline}** **[destabilization]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
these **[natural oscillations]{.underline}**. Due to human activity and
fires, the Amazon rainforest has already lost about 17% of its tree
cover, and at the current rate of deforestation the loss could reach 27%
by 2030. Lovejoy and Nobre (2018) estimate the dieback of the Amazon
Forest at 20%-25%; beyond this deforestation threshold, the [rainforest
would transform into a savannah]{.underline}, potentially releasing up
to 90 gigatons of CO2. Some climate models already indicate that the
Amazon will be a net generator of C02 by 2035, setting the dieback
threshold at 3◦ of warming.

Further uncertainty on the compound effect of the above phenomena arises
from their potential interaction, even before the 2◦ warming is
achieved, allowing tipping points to occur at lower thresholds. Overall,
[greenhouse gases generated by human activity]{.underline} over the last
two centuries have driven the global trend temperature up. This
temperature warming has [widely impacted the natural environment and has
raised the risk of irreversible changes]{.underline} of state with
catastrophic consequences (see also Schellnhuber (2008)) and Solomon et
al. (2009)).

In this paper, we establish a linkage between the concept of
environmental tipping point and the statistical property of time
irreversibility. A stationary process {Yt}T t=1 is said to be
time-reversible if its statistical properties are in- dependent of the
direction of time. In other words, the vectors (Y1, Y2, . . . , YT )
have the same joint distributions as (Y−T , Y−(T −1), . . . , Y−1) for
every integer T . [This implies]{.underline} that the [processes
characterized b]{.underline}y time reversibility ([TR]{.underline})
**[exhibit a temporal symmetry]{.underline}** in the probabilistic
structure. In the alternative circumstance, we have time irreversibility
when the stochastic process behaves differently according to the
direction of time considered. TR has been under investigation in various
fields over the years, for instance, in the different branches of
physics, where researchers have been investigating whether time has some
preferred direction in explaining physical phenomena (see Wald (1980),
Levesque and Verlet (1993), Holster (2003)). This appears to be the case
once a tipping point is achieved, where the system undergoes an
irreversible state change.

This paper aims to investigate whether [TR has the potential to offer
insight into]{.underline} the process of [climate change]{.underline},
**[with a particular focus on the process of global
warming]{.underline}** and its implications for the natural environment.
Studying TR in the context of global warming in this paper is motivated
by the possibility of answering the following questions: are there
divergences between the forward- time and backward-time joint
probability distributions for the process of global warming? Is the
process of global warming symmetric over time? Are these properties
similarly present in natural oscillations that temperature warming might
have permanently impacted, inducing changes in their frequencies and
intensity of occurrence? Irreversibility in this context might carry
insights into the occurrence of state changes.

This paper then introduces new strategies to detect whether a stochastic
pro- cess is time-reversible. [There are already several tests for
TR]{.underline} in the economet- ric literature (see Ramsey and Rothman
(1996), Hinich and Rothman (1998), Chen et al. (2000), Belaire-Franch
and Contreras (2003), Proietti (2020)). [The shortcoming of many of
these]{.underline} approaches [is]{.underline} that [they]{.underline}
usually **[impose strong restrictions]{.underline}** on the model (for
example, Ramsey and Rothman (1996), which re- quires finite sixth
moments), or they are not trivial to apply (for example, Chen et al.
(2000)). [Our new strategies]{.underline} **[are based on
mixed]{.underline}** causal and noncausal **[models]{.underline}** (see
Gourieroux and Jasiak (2016)). Unlike causal models, [which]{.underline}
only take the relationship between present and lagged values into
account, mixed ca- sual and noncausal models also **[compute the
relationship between present and future values]{.underline}**.
[This]{.underline} framework [leads to **nonlinear conditional
expectations**]{.underline} (e.g., Gourieroux and Jasiak (2022)). The
straightforward connection between these models and TR gives rise to our
testing strategies. Furthermore, similarly to Proietti (2020[), we can
test for TR]{.underline} on nonsta- tionary time series **[using a novel
approach]{.underline}**. To do so, we extract the trend component using
the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter that is triggered by a time- reversible
closed-form solution. This implies that the cyclical component, that
records the oscillations of the process around its trend is responsible
for the eventual time-irreversibility feature of the stochastic process.
The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 summarizes the properties
of time-reversible processes.

The existing methods to detect TR are briefly re- viewed. Section 3
introduces our new TR strategies. Namely, we show how our new approaches
exploit the properties of mixed causal and noncausal models. We then
evaluate their performance through Monte Carlo experiments. Section 4
extends our framework to nonstationary time series. Section 5 is
dedicated to empirical investigations on climate variables. Section 6
concludes. 2. Time reversibility Weiss (1975) shows that if an ARMA
model is characterized by a Gaussian error term, then the process is
time-reversible. Indeed, Gaussian processes are completely defined by
their second-order moments, which have the property of being time
symmetrical. Hallin et al. (1988) consider two-sided linear models of
the form: Yt = ∞∑ k=−∞ θkt−k, (1) where the stationary condition ∑∞ k=−∞
\|θk\| \< ∞ is satisfied. They claim that if {Yt}T t=1 is
time-reversible, then either t is a Gaussian white noise, or there
exists a k and s ∈ {0, 1} such that θ2k+j = (−1)sθ2k−j . However, t has
to be a sequence of i.i.d. zero-mean random variables with finite
moments of all orders. It is an unrealistic assumption for non-Gaussian
processes and many time series. Breidt and Davis (1992) extend Weiss's
results to non-Gaussian processes assuming milder conditions than those
in Hallin et al. (1988). They take the following ARM A(p, q) process
into account: φ(L)Yt = θ(L)t, (2) where L indicates the backshift
operator, φ(z) is characterized by r roots outside and s roots inside
the unit circle, and t has finite variance. For simplicity, we set the
polynomial θ(L) = 1, such that (2) can be rewritten as: φ+(L)φ−(L)Yt =
t, (3) where φ+(L) has r roots outside the unit circle, while φ−(L) has
s roots inside. It is well known that (3) has a unique stationary
solution given by a two-sided moving average representation, as
expressed in (1). Breidt and Davis (1992) claim that if φ(z) and φ(z−1)
have different roots, then Yt is reversible if and only if the error
term is Gaussian. In the other case, that is when the two polynomials
φ(z) and φ(z−1) have the same roots, it can be shown that (1) (or
equivalently (3)) is time-reversible regardless of the distribution of
t. Indeed, if p \> 0 and φ(z) and φ(z−1) have the same roots, it can
then be shown that 1/φ(z) has the Laurent expansion 1 φ(z) = ∞∑ −∞ θj zj
, (4) with θ−p/2−j = θ−p/2+j , for j = 0, 1, . . . (see Breidt and Davis
(1992)). This implies that the result of Hallin et al. (1988) is a
consequence of the conclu- sion that the two polynomials φ(z) and φ(z−1)
have the same roots. Moreover, unlike Hallin et al. (1988), Breidt and
Davis (1992) only assume that the error term must have finite variance.
Ramsey and Rothman (1996) define the stationary stochastic process {Yt}T
t=1 is time-reversible only if: γi,j = E\[Y i t Y j t−k\] − E\[Y j t Y i
t−k\] = 0 (5) for all i, j, k ∈ N+. This is a sufficient condition for
TR, but not a necessary one since it only considers a proper subset of
moments from the joint distributions of {Yt}. Since it's impractical to
show that (5) holds for any i, j, and k, they adopt a restricted
definition of TR by imposing i + k ≤ m and k ≤ K. In particular, they
restrict m = 3 so that the symmetric-bicovariance function is given by:
γ2,1 = E\[Y 2 t Yt−k\] − E\[YtY 2 t−k\] = 0, (6) for all integer values
of k. Ramsey and Rothman (1996) claim that i + j = 3 is sufficient to
provide a useful indication of time irreversibility. Ramsey and Rothman
(1996) also introduced a new procedure to test TR that became a standard
approach to investigating business cycle properties such as asymmetry.
It is characterized by a TR test statistic distributed as a standard
normal distribution: √T \[̂γ2,1 − γ2,1\] √V ar(̂ γ2,1) d −→ N (0, 1), (7)
with: ̂ γ2,1 = ̂ B2,1(k) − ̂ B1,2(k), and: ̂ B2,1 = (T − k)−1 T∑ t=K+1 Y
2 t Yt−k ; ̂ B1,2 = (T − k)−1 T∑ t=K+1 YtY 2 t−k, for various integer
values of k. Under the null hypothesis, we have a time- reversible
process. It is important to underline that the pre-requisite of the test
is that the data must possess a finite first sixth moment. If the
distribution lacks those first finite sixth moments, the size of the
test can be seriously distorted (see Belaire-Franch and Contreras
(2003)). Chen et al. (2000) propose a new class of tests for TR and,
unlike the one proposed by Ramsey and Rothman (1996), they do not
require any moment restrictions. This class of tests is based on the
following result: if {Yt}T t=1 is a time-reversible process, then for
every k = 1, 2, . . . , the distribution of Xt,k = Yt − Yt−k is
symmetric about the origin. The drawback of this approach is that it
allows us only to test the symmetry of Xt,k for each value of k, giving
us no chance to jointly test Xt,k for a collection of k values.2
Finally, its implementation is not trivial. Similar reasoning is adopted
by Proietti (2020) since also his test is based on the idea that Xt,k
has to be symmetric for every k \> 0. However, the main difference
between the two approaches is that the test proposed by Proietti (2020)
uses a weaker definition of TR as {Yt}T t=1 can also be nonstationary.
3. New strategies to detect time reversibility on stationary time series
This section introduces new strategies to detect the TR of stationary
stochas- tic processes, exploiting the properties of mixed causal and
noncausal models. Breidt et al. (1991) introduce mixed causal and
noncausal models as expressed in equation (3). They define the
polynomial φ−(z) as noncausal and φ+(z) as a causal polynomial. In this
set up, a required condition for identifying the causal from the
noncausal component is the non-Gaussianity of the innovation term. Lanne
and Saikkonen (2011), rewriting the noncausal polynomial in (3) as lead
polynomial, start with a mixed causal and noncausal model expressed as:
φ(L)φ(L−1)Yt = t, (8) where L−1 produces lead such that L−1Yt = Yt+1. A
mixed causal and non- causal model represented in this way is denoted as
MAR(r,s), where φ(L−1) is the noncausal polynomial of order s and φ(L)
is the causal polynomial of order r. Purely causal and purely noncausal
models are obtained setting respectively φ(L−1) = 1 and φ(L) = 1 (see
Gouri ́eroux et al. (2013), Hencic and Gouri ́eroux (2015), Hecq et al.
(2016), Fries and Zakoian (2019), Hecq and Voisin (2021), Giancaterini
and Hecq (2022), and Fries (2021)). In (8), both causal and non- causal
polynomials have their roots outside the unit circle, such that: φ(z) 6
= 0 and φ(z) 6 = 0 f or \|z\| ≤ 1. (9) The tests for TR that we propose
have the common feature of extending the results obtained by Breidt and
Davis (1992) to the MAR(r,s) representation (8). This is possible if and
only if Condition 3.1 is true. Condition 3.1 A stochastic process that
can be expressed as a MAR model is time-reversible if and only if
φ(z)φ(z−1) have the same roots as φ(z−1)φ(z). Namely, when: r = s and φi
= φi, f or i = 1, . . . , s. This implies that MARs are time-reversible
if and only if the causal polyno- mial has the same order and the same
coefficients as the noncausal polynomia and vice versa. Remember that it
is not possible to identify a MAR model under the Gaussianity of the
innovation term. Hence, in that case, we have a time-reversible process
(see Weiss (1975)). 3.1. Strategy 1 to detect time reversibility The
first strategy aims to evaluate whether a stochastic process meets
Condition 3.1. In particular, it uses a procedure that is similar to the
one used to identify MAR models (see Lanne and Saikkonen (2011) and Hecq
et al. (2016)). That is: 1. We estimate a conventional autoregressive
process (also called pseudo causal model) by OLS, and the lag order p (p
= r + s) is selected us- ing information criteria (for instance, AIC or
BIC). 2. We test the normality in the residuals of the AR(p). In the
event that the null hypothesis of Gaussianity is not rejected, we cannot
identify a MAR(r,s) model and, for the reasons mentioned previously, we
have a time-reversible process. Moreover, if the null hypothesis of
normality is rejected and p is an odd number, the condition r = s can
never be satis- fied, and the process is time-irreversible. In the
alternative case that the null hypothesis of Gaussianity is rejected,
but p is an even number, the condition r = s is a possible scenario and
we proceed to the next step. 3. We select a model among all MAR(r,s)
specifications with r + s = p. This is done using a maximum likelihood
approach (see Giancaterini and Hecq (2022) and references therein). In
the selection procedure, we also include the model given by the
restricted likelihood that imposes commonalities in causal and noncausal
parameters. In other words, we are also going to in- clude the model
with the same restrictions as in Condition 3.1. Note that when we
compute the information criteria of the model with restricted
likelihood, instead of estimating p parameters, we estimate r (or s) of
them, implying a smaller penalty term. Finally, we choose the model with
the smallest information criteria. Let us consider a short example to
illustrate how the strategy works. We sup- pose that we estimate a
conventional AR model by OLS, and we reject the Gaussian hypothesis of
the residuals, for instance, using the Jarque-Bera test. Furthermore,
let us assume we find a number of lags (p) equal to 2. In order to
analyze whether our process is time-reversible, we are going to compute
the log-likelihoods and then the information criteria of the following
four models: MAR(2,0), MAR(0,2), MAR(1,1) as well as the MAR(1,1) with
the restriction φ = φ. If the model with the smallest information
criteria is the one with the restriction, it means that we have a
time-reversible process. In the alternative case where another model is
selected, then we have a time-irreversible process. The positive aspect
of this approach is that it allows us to know with a lim- ited number of
steps whether the process is time-reversible. The shortcoming is that
the strategy is based on information criteria, which have the property
of being very sensitive to the sample, and a specification can be
favoured for a tiny difference in the value of those information
criteria. We also get the common feature that different criteria lead to
different conclusions. 3.2. Strategy 2 to detect time reversibility The
second strategy introduced in this paper is more robust with respect to
the sample and slight differences in the value of information criteria
when models are compared. On the other hand, more steps are required to
identify the TR of the process than for the previous approach. It is
based on the following steps: steps 1 and 2 are identical to what we had
described in 3.1; 3. we select a model among all MAR(r,s) specifications
with r+s = p, choos- ing the one with the largest likelihood (since we
are considering models with the same number of parameters). 4. In the
event that the selected model is the one with r = s, in our previous
example, a MAR(1,1), we compute a likelihood ratio test, taking into
account the same restrictions as in Condition 3.1. If we do not reject
the null hypothesis of the test, we have TR. In the opposite case, when
the null hypothesis is rejected, we have a time-irreversible process.
3.3. Simulation study Let us investigate the performance of the two
strategies. In particular, we run Monte Carlo simulations with N = 1000
replications and four different sample sizes: 100, 200, 500, and 1000
observations (T ). The data generating process is a MAR(1,1), that is (1
− φL)(1 − φL−1)Yt = t, and different combinations of causal and
noncausal coefficients are considered: • φ0 = 0.8, φ0 = 0.8;
time-reversible process; • φ0 = 0.8, φ0 = 0.5; time-irreversible
process; • φ0 = 0.8, φ0 = 0.1; time-irreversible process. In all these
cases, we assume that the error term is distributed as a Student's-t
with degrees of freedom (ν) equal to 3 and a scale parameter (σ) equal
to 5. The assumption that the error term is distributed according to a
Student's-t is not a particularly strong hypothesis. It is a symmetric
distribution that summarizes the features of other (non-Gaussian)
fat-tailed and symmetric distributions well. We also include in our
Monte Carlo study the results obtained by Ramsey and Rotham's test,
setting k = 2. Table 1 shows the frequencies with which the two new
strategies and the test proposed by Ramsey and Rotham detect the
processes under investigation as time-irreversible; p = 2 is assumed to
be known, and r and s are estimated. In particular, the columns Strategy
1 and Strategy 2 indicate the percentage of times the stochastic
processes are identified as time-irreversible when the strategies
introduced in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 are implemented. The last column, RR
(1996), indicates how often we reject the null hypothesis of TR when the
methodology proposed by Ramsey and Rothman (1996) is used. The informa-
tion criteria used for Strategy 1 is the Bayesian Information Criteria
(BIC The results exhibit that Strategy 1 is the methodology that detects
TR with greater precision but is "undersized" for large T . This
observation is because the penalty terms can differ from a very small
number in a large sample. On the other hand, Strategy 2 looks consistent
and is the approach that performs better when the processes under
investigation are time-irreversible (frequencies are not size-adjusted,
though, which makes the results of Strategies 1 and 2 not easy to
compare). The test proposed by Ramsey and Rothman (1996) clearly shows
some size distortion problems. This is not an unexpected result since,
as previously stated, the test can show a size seriously distorted if
the distribution lacks a finite sixth moment. The Student's-t
distribution has a finite sixth mo- ment for ν \> 6. As a consequence,
also the power of the test performs poorly for RR (1996). However, as
Table 2 shows, we obtain different results if we assume that both r and
s are known. In this case, we directly compare the information criteria
of the restricted and unrestricted MAR(1, 1) for Strategy 1 and, for
Strategy 2, we directly compute the likelihood ratio test. The ability
of the two new strategies to detect TR further increases for small
sample sizes (T = 100 and T = 200). The results related to the test
introduced by Ramsey and Rotham (RR (1996)) are invariant since we
applied the same methodology used for Table 1. 4. Testing for time
reversibility on nonstationary processes The goal of this section is to
detect TR in nonstationary processes {Yt}T t=1 that can be expressed as:
Yt = f Y t + ccY t , (10) where f Y is a generic trend function, and ccY
is a stationary process that cap- tures the cyclical fluctuations of Y
around f Y . We show that whenever the trend component is computed using
the HP filter, then f Y can be expressed as a time-reversible process.
As a consequence, the eventual time irreversibility of process Y would
be captured by its cyclical component ccY . In other words, whenever f Y
is estimated by using the HP filter, model (10) is time-irreversible (or
reversible) if and only if its cyclical component is irreversible (or
reversible). The HP filter estimates the trend component through the
following mini- mization problem (see Hecq and Voisin (2021)): min {f Y
t }T t=1 (∑T t=1 y2 t + λ ∑T t=1 \[(ft − ft−1) − (ft−1 − ft−2)\]2) .
(11) According to De Jong and Sakarya (2016), the optimization problem
(11) has the following closed-form solution: f Y t = ( λL−2 − 4λL−1 +
(1 + 6λ) − 4λL + λ2)−1 Yt, (12) for t = 3, . . . , T − 2. The λ
parameter penalizes the filtered trend's variability; therefore, the
higher its value, the smoother the trend component: λ = ( number of
observations per year 4 )i , with either i = 2 (see Backus and Kehoe
(1992)) or i = 4 (Ravn and Uhlig (2002)). It can be shown that (12) can
be rewritten as: f Y t = \[( 1 − ψ1(λ)L − ψ2(λ)L2)( 1 − ψ1(λ)L−1 −
ψ2(λ)L−2) + − ( ψ2 1 (λ) + ψ2 2 (λ) + 6ψ2(λ) )\]−1 Yt, (13) where ψ1(λ)
= 4λ λ+1 , and ψ2(λ) = −λ. For instance, when annual data are
considered, it is commonly accepted to adopt λ = 6.25, implying f Y t =
\[( 1 − 100 29 L + 6.25L2)( 1 − 100 29 L−1 + 6.25L−2) − 13.456 \]−1 Yt.
The results underline that the filter of the trend component is given by
a time- reversible MAR(2,2) polynomial minus a constant value. Since the
latter doesn't affect the symmetry over time of our process, and our
goal is to investigate the time reversibility of f Y , we do not
consider the constant term in our investiga- tion. As a consequence, we
can approximate f Y as follows: f Y t ≈ \[( 1 − 100 29 L + 6.25L2)( 1 −
100 29 L−1 + 6.25L−2)\]−1 Yt. (14) Using the Laurent expansion as in
(4), we have: f Y t ≈ +∞∑ j=−∞ δj Yt−j , (15) where because the identity
of the lead and lag polynomials, δ is symmetric over time. Hence, even
if f Y is a nonstationary process, we can apply a weaker definition of
TR and define it as time-reversible. This implies that the eventual time
irreversibility (or reversibility) lies with the cyclical component of Y
. 5. Is climate change time-reversible? We analyze nine different annual
climate time series: global land and ocean temperature anomalies (GLO),
global land temperature anomalies (GL), global ocean temperature
anomalies (GO), solar activity (SA), emissions of greenhouses gas (GHG),
emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2O), Southern Oscillation Index (SOI),
North Atlantic Oscillation Index (N AO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation
Index (P DO).3 GLO, GL, and GO temperature anomalies are employed to
measure global warming. They provide the difference between the current
temperature from a standard benchmark value. Positive temperature
anomalies show that the observed temperature is warmer than the
benchmark value. Negative temperature anomalies show that the observed
temperature is colder than the benchmark value. SOI is one of the most
important atmospheric indices for determining the strength of El Ni ̃no
and La Ni ̃na events and their possible effects on weather conditions in
the tropics and various other geographical areas. El Ni ̃no events are
characterized by sustained warming of the central and eastern tropical
Pacific, whereas La Ni ̃na events are characterized by sustained cooling
of the same areas. These changes in the Pacific Ocean and its overlying
atmosphere occur in a cycle known as the El Ni ̃no--Southern Oscillation
(EN SO). High values of SOI indicate La Ni ̃na events, whereas negative
values indicate El Ni ̃no events. The N AO determine the westerly winds'
speed and direction across the North Atlantic and the winter sea surface
temperature. When the N AO index is far above average, there is a
greater likelihood that seasonal temperatures in northern Europe,
northern Asia, and South-East North America will be higher than usual.
In contrast, seasonal temperatures in North Africa, North-East Canada,
and southern Greenland will be lower than usual. The opposite is true
when N AO is far below average. Finally, P DO is a climatic cycle that
describes anomalies in sea surface temperature in the Northeast Pacific
Ocean. The P DO has the power to influence weather patterns all over
North America. Figure 1 presents the annual data: GLO, GL, GO, SA, GHG,
and N 2O range from 1881 to 2014, SOI and N AO from 1951 to 2021, and P
DO from 1854 to 2021. Unlike the natural oscillation indices, GLO, GL,
GO, SA, GHG, and N 2O are characterized by a positive trend. Hence,
according to the strategy introduced in Section 4, their eventual
time-reversibility (or irreversibility) lies with their cyclical
component. For this reason, we can remove their trend and extract their
cyclical fluctuations by using the HP filter. Figure 2 displays the
detrended time series. The goal now is to investigate the
time-reversibility of all the variables displayed in Figure 2 and the
latter three variables in Figure 1. As a first step, we estimate
autoregressive models (see Sections 3.1 and 3.2) in each time series.
The information criteria used to identify the number of lags (p) is the
BIC. Next, we test the normality of the residuals of the nine AR(p)
models. Since ccGLO , ccGL, ccGO , ccSA, SOI, N AO and P DO do not
reject the null hypothesis for normality (significance level 0.05) of
the Shapiro-Wilk test (p-values equal to 0.83, 0.59, 0,24, 0.08, 0.16,
0.31, and 0.55 respectively) and the Jarque-Bera test (p-values equal to
0.64, 0.25, 0.15, 0.13, 0.27, 0.31, and 0.55 respectively), we identify
them as time-reversible processes. On the other hand, in ccGHG and ccN
2O , we reject the null hypothesis of Gaussianity of both the
Shapiro-Wilk test (the p-values are close to zero in both cases) and the
Jarque-Bera test (the p-values are close to zero in both cases). This
implies that we can fit MAR models to our data, identifying ccGHG as
MAR(2,0) and ccN 2O as MAR(4,0). Since the condition r = s is not met in
both cases, we detect these two processes as time-irreversible (Table
3). These results let us identify GLO, GL, GO, SA, SOI, N AO, and P DO
as time-reversible and GHG, N 2O as time-irreversible. The time
irreversibility of ccGHG and ccN 2O is a noticeable property of
variables that account for the upward trend in global temperatures,
i.e., for the global warming phenomenon (IPCC (2014); Morana and Sbrana
(2019)). This statistical property should be present in other variables
affected by greenhouse gas emissions, as, statistically, a linear
combination of time-irreversible and time-reversible variables is also
time-irreversible. Finding that the cyclical components of temperatures
and natural oscillations such as SOI, N AO, and P DO are not
time-irreversible is important. Concerning cyclical temperatures, the
finding is consistent with the view that many natural factors (in
addition to anthropogenic GHG emissions) can contribute to transitory
changes in temperatures. These natural factors include solar and
volcanic activity and natural oscillations, such as the Enso, the P DO,
and the NAO. Apart from the tropics, the strongest EN SO influences are
found over North America and Australia, impacting cold conditions over
Northern Europe (Chen and Tung (2014), and Bell et al. (2009)).
Coherently, the natural oscillations investigated in the paper do not
show the irreversibility property, and their contribution to cyclical
temperatures is then dominating the contribution of greenhouse gas
emissions. This explains why the irreversibility property, theoretically
expected in cyclical temperature, is not detected empirically. Yet
global warming might exert feedback effects on natural oscillations.
Tipping points in AM OC and EN SO are, for instance, extreme
consequences of warming temperatures in this respect. Oceans warming can
trigger a tipping point in the EN SO cycle, increasing its variability
and intensity and shifting its teleconnection eastward (Cai et al.
(2021); see also Cai et al. (2014), and Cai et al. (2015)). Some
empirical evidence of feedback effects of global warming on the natural
environment, in terms of higher natural disaster risk induced by
Atlantic hurricanes and a destabilizing impact on the EN SO cycle, are
reported by Morana and Sbrana (2019). As global warming rises in
intensity, its impact on natural oscillation might become detectable
through the emergence of the irreversibility feature in these series
and, therefore, in cyclical temperatures. Admittedly, while this feature
might already be present in the data, we do not empirically detect it.

Under a constructive view, [our findings]{.underline} then **[give
hope]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} [correction]{.underline} policies
**[might still help avoid]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} [worst
consequences of climate change]{.underline}. Yet, **[they call for
action]{.underline}** [not to miss the opportunity]{.underline} window
[that appears]{.underline} still [available]{.underline}. 6. Conclusions
[This]{.underline} paper reviewed and summarized the properties of
time-reversible processes. We analyzed the relationship between mixed
causal and noncausal models and TR. We exploited their association to
create new strategies that help detect TR. In addition to being
parsimonious, our [simulation]{.underline} studies [show]{.underline}
that the [strategies perform accurately]{.underline}, **[exhibiting a
solid ability to detect TR]{.underline}**. Finally, using a weaker
definition of TR, we investigate the time reversibility of nonstationary
processes. In our empirical investigation, we investigate whether TR
appears to be a feature of the process of global warming. In particular,
[we applied our tests to nine different climate time
series]{.underline}: GLO, GL, GO, SA, SOI, N AO, P DO, GHG, and N 2O.
Our [new strategies identified]{.underline} the first **[seven time
series as time-reversible]{.underline}** and the last two as
time-irreversible.

[Intensifying climate change will increase the future risk of **violent

published today in the journal Nature. Synthesizing views across
experts, the study estimates [climate has influenced between 3% and
**20% of armed conflict risk** over the last century and that the
influence will likely increase dramatically.]{.underline}

[In a scenario with 4 degrees]{.underline} Celsius of warming
(approximately the path we're on if societies do not substantially
reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases), [the influence of climate on
conflicts would increase more than five times, leaping to a **26% chance
of** a substantial increase in conflict risk]{.underline}, according to
the study. [Even in a scenario of 2 degrees]{.underline} Celsius of
warming beyond preindustrial levels -- the stated goal of the Paris
Climate Agreement­ -- the influence of climate on [conflicts would more
than double, rising to a 13% chance.]{.underline}

"Appreciating the role of climate change and its security impacts is
important not only for understanding the social costs of our continuing
heat-trapping emissions, but for prioritizing responses, which could
include aid and cooperation," said Katharine Mach, director of the
Stanford Environment Assessment Facility and the study's lead author.

[Climate change-driven extreme weather and related disasters can
**damage economies**, lower **farming and livestock production** and
**intensify inequality** among social groups. These factors, when
combined with other drivers of conflict, may increase risks of
violence.]{.underline}

"Knowing whether environmental or climatic changes are important for
explaining conflict has implications for what we can do to reduce the
likelihood of future conflict, as well as for how to make well-informed
decisions about how aggressively we should mitigate future climate
change," said Marshall Burke, assistant professor of Earth system
science and a co-author on the study.

[Our ocean is the **lifeblood of the planet**, regulating climate,

https://www.nrdc.org/experts/rhea-suh/trump-moves-open-90-percent-our-coastal-waters-oil-drilling

If Trump gets his way, iconic fishing grounds like George's Bank,
treasured recreational waters like the Florida Straits, and
[**critical** marine-breeding areas]{.underline} like those off the
California coast [would be exposed to the dangers of blowouts,
explosions, **catastrophic** spills, seismic blasting, and other perils
that come with these inherently hazardous industrial operations at
sea.]{.underline} [We could]{.underline} see [drill rigs going
up]{.underline} in federal waters off our coasts from Maine to Florida,
from California to Alaska, and **[everywhere]{.underline}** in between.

Today's [proposal comes on the heels of]{.underline} two Trump [moves
that **needlessly increase those dangers**]{.underline}. Over the
holidays, [the Trump administration proposed **weakening offshore
drilling and production safeguards** that grew directly from lessons
learned from the BP disaster. And]{.underline} earlier in December, the
administration [killed an independent study needed to help modernize and
strengthen responsible public oversight of oil and gas operations at
sea]{.underline}. This three-front assault on our oceans and coasts is
~~madness~~---and it's ~~maddening~~.

We all remember the 2010 BP blowout that killed 11 workers, dumped more
than 200 million gallons of toxic crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, and
threw scores of thousands of people out of work. Watching oil gush into
pristine ocean waters for 87 days while the industry fumbled, unable to
stop it. The ghastly pictures of pelicans, dolphins, turtles and other
marine life dying and coated in oil that polluted more than 1,100 miles
of coast. And the presidential commission that told us what went wrong
and what we needed to do to prevent anything like it from happening
again.

Trump wants us to forget all that and let the oil and gas industry have
its way with our workers, waters, and wildlife. Far from protecting us
from the next BP-type disaster, he's increasing the odds of another one.

If Trump gets his way, we'll know less about the dangers of offshore
drilling, we'll have fewer tools to reduce those risks, and we'll have
more waters and coasts exposed to hazard and harm.

And for what?

The United States will produce more crude oil today---9.2 million
barrels---than at any other time since the early 1970s. When you add
natural gas liquids, which are refined much like crude oil, we're up to
12.9 million barrels a day, our highest level ever and up 90 percent
over just the past decade.

To those who think oil is a national security commodity, we now export
6.2 million barrels of crude oil and refined petroleum products each
day---up 343 percent since 2008. That's enough to meet a third of our
daily demand, but the industry is shipping it overseas.

This isn't about national security or some speechwriter's pipe dreams of
energy "dominance." It's about putting fossil fuel profits first---and
putting the rest of us at risk. Its reckless. It's reprehensible. It's
wrong.

[There may be **nothing more essential** to the natural systems that
support and sustain **all life on earth** than clean and healthy oceans.
Oil and gas production at sea puts all that at risk of blowouts,
explosions, disastrous spills, and the sonic blasts used in exploration
that can be dangerous, even lethal, to whales and other marine
life]{.underline}. Burning oil and gas creates carbon pollution that
drives climate change---warming our oceans, raising sea levels, and
threatening our coastal communities. And much of that carbon pollution
settles into our oceans, making our waters more acidic and wreaking
havoc on shellfish, coral reefs, and other foundational forms of life at
sea.

[Protecting]{.underline} the [waters that **sustain life on our planet**
begins with ending our reliance on fossil fuels as quickly as
possible,]{.underline} by investing in energy efficiency so we do more
with less waste; modernizing our transportation systems; and getting
more clean power from the wind and sun.

[As we shift away from]{.underline} the [dirty fuels]{.underline} of the
past toward cleaner, smarter ways to power our future, [we must **limit,
not expand**, the waters that are exposed to the hazards of offshore
drilling]{.underline}. And we must do everything we can to reduce the
risks of what is, by its nature, dangerous work, by strengthening
commonsense safeguards, not weakening them.

A number of researches have been carried out on hydrocarbon polluted
marine environment. The studies include Abii and Nwosu (2009) study on
the effects of oil spillage on soil and Aghalino (2000) on the negative
impact of **[oil activities]{.underline}** on the marine wild life,
soil, air, water and the ecosystem of communities.

[The ecological effects include]{.underline} brownish vegetation and
**[soil erosion]{.underline}**, dead and **[extinction]{.underline}**
[of marine wild life]{.underline}, [**diminishing resources** of the
natural ecosystem]{.underline}, [fertile land turned
**barren**]{.underline} [and adverse effect on]{.underline} the life,
health and economy of the **[people]{.underline}**. In Amadi and Ue Bari
(1992) study in the rainforest ecosystem in Nigeria, soil and
microbiological properties were evaluated 17 years after oil spillage to
assess the effects of oil and interrelationship between the hydrocarbon
utilizing and nitrifying microorganisms in the marine ecosystem. The
study showed that organic carbon, total nitrogen, carbon/nitrogen ratio,
available phosphate and exchangeable potassium were high at moderate and
high impacted zones. Also the distribution of aerobic petroleum
hydrocarbon utilizing fungi and bacteria showed a lesser condition at
the moderately impacted zone than at the highly impacted zones.

[The effect of crude **oil pollution**]{.underline} on marine
environment, soil fertility and the growth of plants and uptake of
nutrients were investigated by Agbogidi, Eruotor and Akparabi (2007) by
growing corn on a soil polluted by crude oil. The soil was analyzed for
organic carbon, total and available nitrogen, extractable phosphate, and
exchangeable potassium, calcium, iron and manganes after each cropping.
It was observed that [germination and **yields** were drastically
reduced]{.underline} as the level of pollution increased. At 4.2 percent
crude oil pollution level, the average reductions were 50 percent in
germination and 92 percent in yield. The amount of organic carbon, total
nitrogen, extractable phosphate, and exchangeable potassium, iron and
manganese increased in the soil with level of crude oil addition, while
extractable phosphate and exchangeable calcium were reduced. The poor
growth was attributed to suffocation of plants caused by exclusion of
air by oil and exhaustion of oxygen by increased microbial activity,
interference with plant-soil-water relationships and toxicity from
sulfides and excess manganese produced during the decomposition of the
hydrocarbons.

Wokocha, Emeodu and Ihenko (2011) examined the impact of crude oil
spillage on the ecosystem, soil properties and food production in
Ogba/Egbema/ Ndoni Area in Rivers State, Nigeria. The results showed
that the pH status of soil in heavily contaminated and moderately
contaminated zones varied from acidic (pH 4.0) to neutral (pH 6.0). The
chemical properties of soil indicated that percentage organic matter
increased from 1.34 to 2.62, available phosphorus decreased from 15 ppm
in control to between 7.34 and 5.42 in soil polluted with high level of
crude oil. The result was in line with Amadi and Ue Bari (1992),
and Ogboghodo, Osemwota, Iruaga and Chikor (2000).

Andrade, Cavelo, Vega and Marcet (2004) in an experiment on the effect
of prestige oil on marine salt marsh ecosystem soils in the coast of
Galicia (Northern Spain) revealed that **[oil pollution]{.underline}**
[altered both physical and chemical soil properties, lowered porosity,
and increased resistance to penetration and hydrophobicity]{.underline}.
The **[crude oil spillage]{.underline}** [affected th]{.underline}e
physical, chemical and biological [properties of soil and the **entire
marine ecosystem**, resulting in **low food production**]{.underline}
[by reducing the nutrients availability]{.underline} in the soils
through increased soil acidity and toxicity of crude oil fractions. The
experiment on the effect of poultry manure on maize planted on crude oil
polluted soils showed that [percentage growth rate in plant height and
**yield** decreased with increase in crude **oil
contamination**]{.underline} (Ogboghodo et al., 2004).

**[Crude oil spillage]{.underline}** [also suppresses seed
**germination**]{.underline}, [regeneration and restoration]{.underline}
and caused cellular and stomata abnormalities (Gill & Sandota,
1976). Ekundayo, Emede and Osayande (2001) confirmed that in crude oil
polluted soils, possibility of grain yield is significantly reduced by
95 percent compared with the control. In a study of agricultural land in
an oil producing area around Qua Iboe River in the Eastern Niger Delta
of Nigeria, the fouled loamy soil samples polluted by crude oil were
treated using chemical degreasers and detergents (Essien & John, 2010).
The result of the treatments showed a significant effect on soil
properties and crop growth parameters; however recovery level was
significantly higher than the level of degradation, except in
infiltration rate. Soil pH increased by 26% in fouled soil, attributed
to bacterial biodegradation of crude oil under the anaerobic conditions
present in the soil macro and micro-pores, and indicated the tendency of
crude oil spills to buffer acidic soil to neutral. Hydraulic
conductivity with 45% - 67% reduction from 82.24 cm/day in the control
soil to 39.6 cm/day in polluted soil confirmed the blockage of polluted
soils micropores by oil films. Crop growth, indicated by root
elongation, diminished to 7.4 ± 0.64 cm in polluted soil ecosystem
compared to13.47 ± 6.40 cm in the control soil ecosystem.

2.1. The Marine Habitats

A habitat is an ecological or environmental area inhabited by one or
more living species. Marine habitats can be divided into coastal and
open ocean habitats.

Coastal habitats are found in the area that extends from as far as the
tide comes in on the shoreline out to the edge of the continental shelf.
Most marine life is found in coastal habitats, even though the shelf
area occupies only seven percent of the total ocean. Figure 1 describes
the configuration and composition of the continental shelf showing the
coastline, the continental slope, the continental rise and the ocean
cavity.

**[Oil spills]{.underline}** frequently [kill marine
mammals]{.underline} such as whales, dolphins, seals, and sea otters.
Oil coats fur of otters and seals, leaving them vulnerable to
hypothermia. [Even when marine mammals escape the immediate effects, an
oil spill can **contaminate** their **food supply.**]{.underline}

2.2. Beaches, Marshlands, and Fragile Aquatic Ecosystems

[Oil spills]{.underline} coat everything they touch and become unwelcome
with long-term effects on parts of every ecosystem they have contact
with.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ When an oil slick from a large spill reaches a beach, oil coats
and clings to every rock and grain of sand.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ If the oil washes into
coastal marshes, mangrove forests, or other wetlands, fibrous plants and
grasses absorb oil, which can [damage plants and make the area
unsuitable as wildlife habitat]{.underline} (Fukuyama et al., 2014).

[When oil]{.underline} eventually stops floating on the water's surface
and [begins to sink into the marine environment, it can have similar
damaging effects]{.underline} on fragile

underwater ecosystems, [killing or contaminating fish and smaller
organisms that are **essential links**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline}
**[global food chain]{.underline}**.﻿﻿﻿

Despite massive clean-up efforts following the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil
spill, for example, a study conducted by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) found that 26,000 gallons of oil were
still trapped in the sand along the Alaska shoreline.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Confirming the
recalcitrant nature of crude oil impact (Shigenaka, 2014).

2.3. Birds

Oil-covered birds are a universal symbol of environmental damage wreaked
by oil spills. Some species of shore birds might escape by relocating if
they sense danger in time, some may not. Some sea birds that swim and
dive for their food are most likely to be covered in oil following a
spill are likely vitims. Oil spills also damage nesting grounds,
potentially causing serious long-term effects on entire species.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ The
2010 BP Deepwater Horizon offshore oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, for
example, occurred during prime mating and nesting season for many birds
and marine species, and long-term environmental consequences of that
spill won't be known for years.﻿﻿﻿﻿ **[Oil spills]{.underline}** [can
disrupt **migratory patterns** by contaminating areas where migrating
birds normally stop]{.underline} (Gulf Oil Spill).

[Even a small amount of oil can be deadly]{.underline} to birds.﻿﻿﻿﻿ By
coating feathers, [oil not only makes flying impossible but also
destroys birds' natural waterproofing and insulation]{.underline},
leaving them vulnerable to hypothermia or overheating.﻿﻿﻿ As birds
frantically preen their feathers to restore their natural protections,
they often swallow oil, which can severely damage their internal organs
and lead to death.﻿﻿﻿ The best estimate of the Exxon Valdez oil spill is
that it killed 250,000 seabirds (Carson et al., 1992; Haney et al.,
2014).﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Figures 2(a)-(c) clearly shows the degree of impacts on birds
after being oiled during oil spill incident.

The laughing gull was by far the most affected, with 32% of the entire
northern Gulf of Mexico population killed because of the spill.

An oiled seabird was found dead on the beach following the Kuroshima oil
spill near Dutch Harbor, Alaska, in November 1997 (NOAA).

2.4. Marine Mammals

[Oil spills]{.underline} frequently [kill marine mammals such as whales,
dolphins, seals, and sea otters]{.underline}.﻿﻿﻿﻿ Oil can clog blowholes of
whales and dolphins, making it impossible for them to breathe properly
and disrupting their ability to communicate. Oil coats fur of otters and
seals, leaving them vulnerable to hypothermia.

Even when marine mammals escape the immediate effects, [an oil spill can
contaminate their **food supply**]{.underline}. Marine [mammals that eat
fish or other food exposed to an oil spill may be poisoned by oil and
die or experience other problems]{.underline}.

The Exxon Valdez oil spill killed 2800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, and
up to

22 killer whales (Harwell & Gentile, 2014). In the years after the Exxon
Valdez spill, scientists noted higher death rates among sea otters and
other species affected by the spill and stunted growth or other damage
among additional species.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Thirty-five years after the disaster,
researchers have found that the Prince William Sound ecosystem seems to
have finally recovered, and localized effects on sea otters appear to
have been resolved (﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Fukuyama et al., 2014).

[Long after the spill, **impacts persist**]{.underline} on marine
mammals leading to more dead, threat of species extinction or stunted
growth or other damage among other species as shown in Figure 3(a)
and Figure 3(b). Potential respiratory damage, hypothermia and other
cellular injuries are eminent as a result of the oil spill impact.

3\. Turtle

The survival rates of Turtles plummeted and the number of nests declined
by 35% as a result of the BP oil spill which cause a surge of sea turtle
strandings in the northern Gulf of Mexico with a majority in Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiana (Gallaway et al., 2016).

3.1. Impact on Fish

[Oil spills often take a deadly toll]{.underline} on fish, shellfish,
and other marine life, particularly if many fish eggs or larvae are
exposed to oil.﻿﻿﻿ Shrimp and oyster **[fisheries]{.underline}** along the
Louisiana coast [were among early **casualties**]{.underline} of the BP
Deepwater

Horizon oil spill.﻿﻿﻿﻿ Similarly, the Exxon Valdez spill destroyed billions
of salmon and herring eggs.﻿﻿﻿﻿ **[Fisheries]{.underline}** impacted by the
Exxon Valdez [took over three decades to
recover]{.underline} (Quintana-Rizzo et al., 2015).

The shrimp and oyster fisheries are usually the first casualties of
marine oil spills. In most cases, the **[fisheries hardly
recover]{.underline}**. [Fish are affected through contacts]{.underline}
with the gills, [by ingestion, or by eating oiled prey]{.underline}. The
oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are the most
toxic components of oil. Oil vapors can cause damage to an organism's
central nervous system, liver, and lungs. **[Spilled oil
can]{.underline}** also have long-term reproductive problems in
organisms that have been exposed to oil (Fukuyama et al., 2014). Fishes
are very susceptible to oil spill impacts as shown in Figure 4. The
severity most often **[result]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} death,
deformation and **[extinction]{.underline}** of species.

3.2. Cetaceans

A deadly toll on dolphin and whale populations contributed to the
largest and longest marine mammal mortality event ever recorded in the
area. Between 2010 and 2014, there were 1141 cetacean strandings
recorded in the northern Gulf of Mexico, with 95% found dead. Bottlenose
dolphins especially were killed both as a direct result of oil pollution
and from long-term adverse health effects. Studies on the species
conducted from 2010 to 2015 found that reproductive success rates for
bottlenose dolphin females were less than a third of those in areas not
impacted by the spill (Kellar et al., 2017).

3.3. Wildlife Habitat and Breeding Grounds

Spill have both acute, short-term impacts on wildlife and environmental
health, and long-term effects that persist for a longer period (Schwing
et al., 2015).

[Long-term damage to species and their habitats]{.underline} and nesting
or breeding grounds [is one of the most **far-reaching environmental
impacts**]{.underline} [caused by oil spills]{.underline}.﻿﻿﻿﻿ Even species
that spend most of their lives at sea, such as various species of sea
turtles, must come ashore to nest.﻿﻿﻿﻿ Sea turtles can be harmed by oil they
encounter in the water or on the beach where they lay their eggs, their
eggs can be damaged by oil and fail to develop properly, and newly
hatched turtles may be oiled as they scurry toward the ocean across an
oily beach.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

#### Plankton collapse threatens the entire Arctic food web and accelerates climate change---oil drilling, pollution, and climate disruptions undermine core ecological and carbon cycles.

[**Phytoplankton and zooplankton are fundamental** to the functioning of
marine ecosystems, particularly in the Arctic, where they drive food web
dynamics and biogeochemical cycles]{.underline}. Their roles in primary
production, carbon sequestration, and nutrient cycling are critical for
the health and sustainability of Arctic marine environments.
[Understanding and protecting these vital components of the ecosys- tem
are essential for managing the impacts of climate change and preserving
the biodiversity and ecological integrity of the Arctic.]{.underline}

[Human activities are increasingly **impacting the Arctic marine
environment**, with significant consequences for plankton communities.
One of the most direct impacts arises from industrial activities such as
oil and gas exploration and extraction]{.underline} \[31, 48\]. These
operations introduce [pollutants, including hydrocarbons and heavy met-
als, into the marine ecosystem, which can be **toxic to planktonic
organisms**. Oil spills, in particular, pose severe threats to
phytoplankton and zooplankton by creat- ing physical barriers to light
penetration, disrupting photosynthesis, and causing mortality through
chemical toxicity.]{.underline}

[Commercial shipping, which is expanding due to the reduction in sea
ice, also directly affects plankton communities]{.underline} \[42\].
Ships release ballast water containing non-native plankton species,
potentially [leading to **biological invasions** that disrupt local
ecosystems]{.underline}. Moreover, the discharge of waste and emissions
from ships intro- duces pollutants and alters the chemical composition
of seawater, affecting the 337 growth and survival of plankton[. Noise
pollution from industrial activities, ship- ping, and icebreaker
operations can **disrupt the behavior of zooplankton**, which rely on
acoustic signals for navigation and predator avoidance]{.underline}
\[52\]. Such disturbances can lead to changes in zooplankton
distribution and abundance, indirectly affecting the entire marine food
web.

[Climate change, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, is
**the most significant indirect impact** on Arctic plankton
communitie]{.underline}s \[46\]. Rising tempera- tures and the melting
of sea ice are altering the physical and chemical properties of the
Arctic Ocean, with profound effects on plankton dynamics. The reduction
in sea ice extent and thickness increases light penetration into the
water column, poten- tially enhancing phytoplankton productivity.
[However, this also leads to shifts in species composition and the
timing of phytoplankton blooms, which can **disrupt the
synchronization** between phytoplankton availability and the life cycles
of zooplank- ton and higher trophic levels.]{.underline} Ocean
acidification, another consequence of increased CO2 emissions, poses a
critical threat to plankton communities. [The uptake of CO2 by seawater
reduces pH levels, affecting the calcification processes of organisms
such as coccolithophores and some species of zooplankton \[27\].
Acidification can impair their ability to build and maintain calcium
carbonate shells, leading to decreased survival and altered population
dynamics \[35\].]{.underline}

[Changes in freshwater input from melting glaciers and increased
precipitation affect the salinity and stratification of Arctic waters
\[50\]. These hydrological changes influence nutrient availability and
distribution, which are crucial for phyto- plankton growth]{.underline}.
Variations in salinity and nutrient fluxes can lead to shifts in phy-
toplankton species composition and productivity, with cascading effects
on the entire marine food web. Furthermore[, anthropogenic nutrient
inputs from riverine discharge and atmospheric deposition can cause
eutrophication, leading to **harmful algal blooms**]{.underline} (HABs)
\[60\]. [These blooms can produce toxins that are **detrimental to
marine life,** including zooplankton, and can create hypoxic conditions
that further stress plankton communities.]{.underline}

[The cumulative and synergistic effects of these direct and indirect
human activi- ties **exacerbate the stress** on Arctic plankton
communities.]{.underline} For instance, the combi- nation of warming
temperatures, altered salinity, and increased pollutant loads can create
inhospitable conditions for many plankton species. [The disruption of
plank- ton dynamics has **far-reaching implications** for the entire
Arctic marine ecosystem, as plankton form the foundation of the food
web, supporting a diverse array of marine organisms from small fish to
large marine mammals.]{.underline}

[Human activities are profoundly impacting Arctic plankton communities
through both direct mechanisms, such as pollution and noise, and
indirect pathways, such as climate change and ocean
acidification]{.underline} \[33, 39\]. The resilience and adaptability
of these communities are being tested by the rapid and multifaceted
changes occurring in the Arctic marine environment. Addressing these
challenges requires comprehen- sive and integrative management
strategies that mitigate anthropogenic pressures and enhance the
resilience of Arctic ecosystems.

### Impact\-\--Oil Spills\-\--Public Health\-\--2NC

#### Oil and gas extraction causes severe public health crises---linked to birth defects, cancer, respiratory illness, and toxic exposure

According to available research, [pollution from the oil extraction
sector is probably to blame for a variety of newly discovered health
issues, such as a rise in the number of **miscarriages, eye infections,
blindness, and skin conditions**, as well as an increase in the rate of
female sterility]{.underline} \[5, 41, 45\]. In addition, a few
interviewees stated feel- ing fatigued, cramps in the stomach and
appendicitis. People inhabiting [production oil fields experience
discomfort and anguish due to noxious odors and smoke. Health
professionals in Koch and Melut have found evidence of a **link between
elevated pollution levels from the oil industry and these health
problems**]{.underline} \[29\]. [The **percentage** of mothers in the
oil-producing regions who gave birth to children with birth
abnormalities was **88.5%**, according to a research by Mckenzie et
al]{.underline}. \[33\]. [Studies conducted in the US State of Colorado
show a connection between congeni- tal heart problems and neural tube
malformations in neonates, as well as proximity to oil and gas
operations]{.underline} \[24, 33, 49\]. Piping leaks are visible in the
Mala oilfield. [Exposure to carcinogenic petrochemicals has increased in
oil-producing regions due to a typical occurrence of oil spills from
leaking pipelines, refineries, corroded or aged infrastructure, and
conflict damage]{.underline}. Another major environmental problem is the
emissions from gas flaring. [The produced gas is flared or reinjected
together with the oil throughout the mining operation. The **pollutants
resulting from incom- plete combustion are causing gas flaring,**
despite the fact that this is prohibited by law]{.underline}. Numerous
particles and other hazardous gasses are released into the atmo- sphere
in oil field environments. [Benzene, styrene, ethynyl benzene,
ethynyl-methyl benzenes, toluene, xylenes, acenaphthylene, biphenyl, and
fluorine are a few of these dangerous hydrocarbons. Some of the
recognized carcinogens in the oil leak in the Tharjat oil field are
believed to cause cancer, while others may exacerbate fetal
difficulties]{.underline}. The volunteers from Koch, Leer, and Nyal had
high levels of lead and barium in their hair, indicating an elevated
exposure to this toxic metal. [The discovery of high levels of lead in
local well water samples implies that polluted water is a major
contributing factor to the lead hair results]{.underline} \[29\].

Six typical outdoor contaminants include acid rain precursor gases (NO 2
and SO2) in addition to acidic precipitation and its detrimental effects
\[31, 32\]. [The 205 inhalation of fine particles resulting from acid
precursor gases has been **associated with heart and lung
problems**,]{.underline} including asthma and bronchitis, as well as
[early mortality]{.underline} \[4, 36\]. In addition to being a
significant contributor to the creation of the photochemical pollutant
ozone, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) also presents a risk to human health.
Prior research has demonstrated that [animals exposed to NO2 have
**weakened defenses against bacterial and viral
infections**]{.underline}, [while youngsters exposed to high indoor NO2
concentrations may be more vulnerable to serious infections of the
lungs]{.underline}, bronchial tubes, and lower respiratory tract, as
well as bronchitis and chest cough with phlegm. Although sulfur dioxide
(SO2) is a transient irritant, [stud- ies have indicated that elevated
SO 2 levels in combination with particle matter may cause slight but
detectable transient impairments in pulmonary function]{.underline}.
[Skin lesions and malignancies may also be connected to acid
rain]{.underline}. Due to the fact that South Sudanese people mostly
rely on rainwater for drinking, cooking, laundry, and other household
purposes, drinking acidic water can change the pH of the stomach and
dissolve the mucous membrane lining the intestinal walls, increasing the
risk of stomach ulcers \[29\].

[Oil and petroleum products have a **high degree of mobility**, which
causes exten- sive environmental pollution.]{.underline} [The devastated
land area grows by **10,000 hectares**]{.underline} annually. Some
analysts claim that for every 100 km of the pipeline's path, 500
hectares of damaged land were recorded simply during the main pipeline's
con- struction. However, compared to more southern places, [the Arctic
is restoring its native plant communities at a much slower rate, and
attempts to rehabilitate con- taminated soil through technology have
proven fruitless.]{.underline} Furthermore, in actuality, reclamation
only occurs beside already-existing roadways; areas outside of these
segments remain unaffected. Frequently, there is only a phony
reclamation taking place: [the oil-filled areas are sprayed with sand,
but the oil stays in the soil and seeps into freshwater and groundwater
sources,]{.underline} eventually entering the Arctic Ocean. Every year,
hundreds of thousands of tons of petroleum products are only delivered
into the Arctic Ocean by river runoff. Because of this, the amount of
pollutants in various regions of the White, Kara, Laptev, and Barents
Seas is already two to three times higher than usual \[7\]. On Russia's
Arctic shelf, liquid hydrocarbon resources are still being developed. It
is anticipated that the Prirazlomnoye field would pro- duce five million
tons of oil by the year 2025.

### Impact\-\--Oil Spills\-\--AT: Cleanup Solves

[Oil has been the primary source of energy for the past century. As we
continuously search for untapped oil reserves to fuel our economy, many
have been turning their attention to the Arctic]{.underline}. The US
Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic holds up to a fifth of the
world's undiscovered oil reserves. These resources have been left
untouched, since the harsh climate conditions in the Arctic make
exploring and developing oil reserves very challenging. But oil
exploration in the Arctic is becoming more accessible with the Arctic
warming up and losing sea ice. Commercial ships that use and transport
oil are also traveling throughout the Arctic waters more often,
increasing the risk of oil spills in the Arctic. [Unfortunately, we know
**very little** about the potential impacts of oil spills in the
Arctic.]{.underline} When you think of oil spills, images of volunteers
walking along the beach and scooping out oil-drenched sands may come to
mind. These actions are definitely helpful to minimize the damage of oil
spills. [But oil in the environment also degrades naturally, just over
much longer periods of time.]{.underline} Oil-eating microbes living in
seawater and in soil can take up oil and break it down to smaller
molecules that are not harmful anymore to the environment. [However, to
break down oil effectively, these microbes need to have "nice" living
conditions (warm water temperature, lots of nutrients in water, etc.),
which the Arctic waters **don't really offer**.]{.underline} This had
motivated a group of scientists in the early 1980s to study how oil
degrades naturally in the Arctic climate, by carrying out the Baffin
Island Oil Spill (BIOS) project. In this project, they had released a
small amount of crude oil on two nearshore locations in the Arctic to
simulate real oil spill events, and tracked how the composition of oil
changed over time. Army soldiers cleaning oil at Papamoa Beach from the
Rena oil spill (Wikimedia Commons) [In 2019, another group of scientists
revisited the BIOS project sites to find out what impacts the oil spills
from four decades ago left on the beaches of Baffin Island.]{.underline}
They collected beach sand at the surface (0-2cm) and the subsurface
(slightly below the surface, 5-10cm) from the oil spill sites, and also
from uncontaminated sites. [Even though sands from the oil spill sites
did not look different from oil-free sands by eye, there was still 0-2%
and 3-6% of crude oil left in the surface and the subsurface sands after
all these years. Colwellia is a marine bacterium that can degrade oil at
cold waters (like the Arctic Ocean) (NCBI)]{.underline} The scientists
also discovered that there were still large differences in the
populations and types of microbes living in oil-contaminated sands
compared to oil-free sands. Because oil-contaminated sands were
providing extra nutrients only for oil-eating microbes, oil-contaminated
sands contained mostly oil-eating microbes, whereas oil-free sands
contained many more types of diverse microbes. [This meant that the
sands affected by oil still **haven't returned** to their original
state!]{.underline} Interestingly, most of the oil-eating microbes were
not specifically adapted to the cold temperatures in the Arctic. [This
means that oil-eating bacteria are likely breaking down oil at a **much
slower pace** than they would be if they were living in warm
waters.]{.underline} This result is important for us to think about how
to clean up oil spills in the Arctic, because we literally cannot heat
up the Arctic waters to help microbes break down oil quickly. Instead,
we may have to rely more on "aggressive" cleanup strategies, by directly
removing the beach soil and treating them somewhere else to get rid of
oil. Overall, studies like these are very important in helping us better
understand the potential danger of oil spills in the Arctic (and
possibly Antarctic), and come up with strategies to efficiently clean up
oil and recover the ecosystem.

#### The Arctic is uniquely hard to clean up.

[During]{.underline} the [clean-up]{.underline} operations
[of]{.underline} the Exxon [Valdez]{.underline} spill in Alaska [and
Deepwater Horizon]{.underline} in the Gulf of Mexico, [only 15% to 25%
of oil was successfully removed through mechanical methods]{.underline},
such as mechanical recovery and burning of the spilled oil. [The bulk of
the clean-up was carried out by oil-eating bacteria]{.underline} in the
water.

Of particular interest to scientists is the way in which [oil-eating
microbes are **slowed down in ice-cold temperatures**]{.underline}. The
Arctic Research Centre at Aarhus University in Denmark has found that
[low temperatures change the chemical properties of]{.underline} the
[spilled oil and **slow down biodegradation**. Cold oil is]{.underline}
said to be [more viscous, making it harder for]{.underline} oil-eating
[microbes to break it down]{.underline}.

[The **lack of waves** in the Arctic Ocean poses another challenge.
Where there is sea ice and]{.underline} therefore [fewer
waves]{.underline}, the [oil does not disperse into small
droplets.]{.underline}

[There is also a lower level of nutrients, such as nitrogen and
phosphorus, which feed algae and bacteria]{.underline} in the water.
[Without these]{.underline} nutrients, the [**bacteria cannot develop**
at an optimum rate]{.underline}.

Another interesting feature is the [long]{.underline} (often 24-hour)
[periods of sunlight in the Arctic summer]{.underline}, which can both
help and hinder clean-up operations. On the one hand, long hours of
sunlight help the microbes to break up oil molecules, but conversely
this could [make the oil compounds **more toxic for aquatic
organisms**]{.underline}.

Last October, an unmanned barge with 950 gallons of fuel on board was in
the Beaufort Sea when it broke free from the tug towing it. The weather
was stormy and the tug captain decided it was too dangerous to try to
retrieve the barge in turbulent seas.

Ideally, the Canadian Coast Guard would have been on hand to deal with
the situation. But the icebreaker it routinely dispatches to the
Beaufort Sea had gone back to Vancouver for the winter. It would have
taken a week for it to return.

In the days that followed, powerful currents swept the barge into
Alaskan waters. The U.S. Coast Guard couldn't do anything because its
one operating icebreaker was stationed in Antarctica at the time.
Canadian and U.S. officials thought the barge would most likely be
locked in the ice, or crushed by ice and sink. It continued to drift,
however, and when satellite observers checked last month the barge was
about 40 miles off Russia's Chukchi Peninsula. Russian attempts to find
the barge have been hampered, likely to due to bad weather.

As potential oil spills go, the barge incident is an extremely minor
one. But experts say that the errant barge should be a wake-up call for
[Arctic nations]{.underline} like the United States, Canada, Russia,
Denmark, and Norway that [are poised to ramp up shipping, as well as oil
and gas drilling]{.underline}, in the Arctic.

Not only does the route of the ghost barge serve as a real-life
demonstration of how spilled oil could move across the Arctic, it also
illustrates how difficult it will be to contain and clean up oil in a
region where roads, ports, airplanes, and icebreakers are few and far
between. In addition, [scientists and engineers]{.underline} still
[**don't fully understand** how chemical dispersants and oil collection
agents might work in a cold climate, how ice conditions and ocean
currents]{.underline} will [influence the fate of spilled oil, and how
well microbes in the Arctic]{.underline} are able to
[degrade]{.underline} the [hydrocarbons, as they tend to do in warmer
climates]{.underline}, such as during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil
spill in the Gulf of Mexico.

"[Responding to an oil spill is **extremely challenging in any marine
environment**]{.underline}," says Paul Crowley, the Canadian director of
the World Wildlife Fund's Arctic Program. "[Under Arctic conditions, it
is **much worse**. A major spill would contaminate ice and shorelines
for]{.underline} many [thousands of kilometers, kill seabirds and
mammals, and severely pollute the natural ecosystem that]{.underline}
traditional \[[indigenous]{.underline}\] [users and wildlife rely
upon]{.underline}."

Crowley noted that the offshore operating season in the Arctic --- and
therefore [the period when it would be possible to clean up an oil
spill]{.underline} --- [is restricted to four to five months by
darkness, heavy ice, and extreme cold]{.underline}. These [severe
conditions]{.underline} would [make it **impossible** to attempt an oil
spill cleanup for half of the time during]{.underline} the [operating
season, and **100 percent of the time during the winter**]{.underline},
Crowley and others say.

The issue of oil spill response in the Arctic has gained added attention
since the Obama administration announced last month that it was giving
conditional approval to Shell Oil to drill up to six exploratory wells
in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska. Although the U.S. is requiring Shell to
abide by stringent safeguards --- drilling only in shallow water and
only in ice-free months, requiring the presence of a second oil rig to
drill a relief well in case of a blowout --- the administration's
decision nonetheless opens the door to drilling in U.S. Arctic waters.

Shell also is exploring Arctic oil-drilling opportunities in Russia,
Greenland, and Norway. The company says it is taking "extraordinary
precautions" to drill safely and is collaborating closely with
scientific organizations and governments in the region.

Using a supposedly ice-resistant platform, Russia has already begun
drilling in the Arctic Ocean at the Prirazlomnoye oil field in the
Pechora Sea off western Siberia. These developments, experts warn, may
be just the beginning of oil exploitation in a region that is unprepared
to handle oil spills of any size.

Rob Huebert is senior research fellow at the Center for Military and
Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary and a board member of the
Canadian Polar Commission, which is responsible for monitoring and
disseminating knowledge of the polar regions. He is not alone in
suggesting that the time to act on oil spill preparedness should come
sooner rather than later because oil and gas drilling, as well as
shipping in the Arctic, will inevitably accelerate.

In addition to Russia, Huebert says, other Arctic nations --- including
Greenland, Norway, the United States, and Canada --- are interested in
developing energy resources in the Arctic, setting "these states on a
collision course with the international environmental community."

Recent oil spills such as Deepwater Horizon have provided engineers and
biologists with valuable insights into the containment, cleanup, and
disposal of spilled oil. These spills have also spurred the U.S.
Department of Interior to enact some of the most aggressive reforms to
offshore oil and gas regulation and oversight in U.S. history.

But [as Deepwater Horizon demonstrated, it takes a **tremendous amount
of resources** to clean up a major spill]{.underline}. At the height of
the cleanup, 7,000 vessels, 125 aircraft, and 47,000 people were
deployed from a host of easily accessible ports and bases across the
coast of the Gulf of Mexico. [And yet, several months after the oil well
was finally capped, more than 100 millions gallons of oil]{.underline}
--- out of as many as 210 million spilled --- [was still unaccounted
for]{.underline}. Much of that [missing oil]{.underline} is believed to
have [settled on the sea floor]{.underline}.

A spill on the scale of the Deepwater Horizon isn't going to happen
anytime soon in the Arctic. But experts say that mo[bilizing even a
fraction of these resources in the region in an expeditious manner would
be **extremely difficult** because there are **few roads, runways, or
ports**]{.underline} in the Arctic; **[little expert manpower standing
by]{.underline}** to stage a response; [and **insufficient international
protocols** to orchestrate a cleanup if]{.underline} the [oil crosses
international boundaries. Tracking]{.underline} the oil [by satellite
would]{.underline} also [be difficult because of weather conditions and
ice that may cover oil slicks]{.underline}.

Studies have shown that in most cases, no more than 20 per cent of oil
spilled in the ocean can be recovered by mechanical means --- those that
do not involve the use of chemicals, which can be toxic to marine
organisms. In situ burning and chemical dispersants, therefore, would
have to be relied upon heavily in the event of a spill in the Arctic,
experts say.

University of Manitoba scientist David Barber heads up a Canadian
research group with expertise in the detection, impacts, and mitigation
of oil in sea ice. He says [there is very limited knowledge of how
Arctic marine ecosystems will be affected by]{.underline} the presence,
composition, and dispersion of [oil, as well as chemicals used for
cleanup]{.underline}, such as dispersants.

"Development of [technologies]{.underline} that would be able to help
detect oil in ice, and cold-adapted bioremediation technologies, [are
**in their infancy**]{.underline}," he points out.

Barber and his group recently received \$28 million in funding from the
Canadian government to study ways of detecting oil in Arctic ice. He
says there are a number of variables in the Arctic that complicate
containment and clean up efforts, with ice and cold weather topping the
list. [Oil can become frozen in ice and drift long
distances]{.underline}, and [oil trapped under ice]{.underline} also
[breaks down more slowly because of reduced wave action. Lower
evaporation losses in cold climes]{.underline} also [slow the breakdown
of oil]{.underline}. The [long-lingering effects of the
1989]{.underline} Exxon [Valdez oil spill in southern Alaska
demonstrated the difficulties]{.underline} of cleaning up oil spills in
cold climes.

What worries scientists and environmentalists even more is [a
blowout]{.underline} that [might take place toward the end of the summer
drilling season]{.underline}.

"If a blowout were to occur and could not be contained before the winter
freeze-up, [it could **spew oil uncontrollably for the seven or eight
months** of winter ice-cover, without the **possibility of** taking any
**steps during that time to control it**]{.underline}," Crowley says.
"[The oil would bind with the newly formed ice, be carried far and wide
by ocean currents, and **released into new environments** the following
spring]{.underline}." This, Barber said, should cause people "to pause
and reflect on the consequences of allowing oil and gas development in
this region without the proper safeguards."

Environmental groups are particularly concerned that Shell is being
given permits for conditional drilling in the Arctic, considering that
the company's history of exploratory drilling has been fraught with
problems, including the grounding of a drilling rig off the Alaska coast
in late 2012.

Shell has made improvements in source control capping and containment
since 2012, but experts with WWF and the Pew Charitable Trusts believe
that Shell's spill response capabilities, and those of U.S. agencies,
still do not come close to resembling what an expert committee for the
U.S. National Research Council recommended in 2014. The report
highlighted serious shortcomings and featured a long list of
recommendations.

"**[There is still no backstop]{.underline}** --- [no]{.underline}
national [regulation to ensure operators are prepared for the harsh
conditions and remote location of the Arctic]{.underline} region," says
Marilyn Heiman, director of Pew's US Arctic Project. "That's why we are
pushing for \[the\] Interior \[Department\] to finalize strong
regulations that will apply to all future drilling in the Arctic."

The fact that Russia is ramping up activity in the Arctic was one of the
concerns of the National Research Council committee. If a spill or an
accident were to happen on the Russian side of the border, the committee
pointed out, oil could easily migrate into Alaskan waters. The committee
called on the U.S. Coast Guard to expand its bilateral agreement with
Russia to include Arctic spill scenarios. Crowley says the same
international dispersion of oil could happen if a spill were to occur in
Canada's Beaufort Sea, where Imperial Oil Canada, Exxon Mobil, and BP
have jointly filed an application to drill at least one well nearly a
mile deep.

Crowley says that the barge that ended up in Russia is an example of
what WWF-Canada has highlighted in an oil spill modeling map of the
Beaufort Sea. The barge has followed roughly the same path along the
Canadian, Alaskan, and Russian coasts as many of the 22 oil spill
scenarios depicted on the WWF map.

"This also highlights the need for increased cooperation, both between
industry and governments, and especially between the Arctic states who
share these waters," says Crowley.

Humanity\"; Job One for Humanity;

Accessed 6-27-2025; AY\]

[A **total extinction** event could begin]{.underline} as early as 50-70
years from now[, in the form of a very high average global temperature
and very high atmospheric carbon levels]{.underline} of approximately
750 ppm, which would support the initiation of the final stages of the
runaway global heating process.

[The final stage, runaway global heating, describes the circumstances in
which the global climate destabilizes **catastrophically and
permanently** from its original state---similar to what happened on
Venus when the planet lost its atmosphere out into outer
space.]{.underline} Runaway global warming is thought to have occurred
on Venus approximately 4 billion years ago due to its extremely high
carbon-rich atmosphere and exceptionally high average surface
temperatures.

[The final stage of runaway global warming will create a literal
Climageddon meltdown where nothing will survive because there will be
**no atmosphere**.]{.underline} This total extinction event will enter
its first phase as soon as our average global temperature rises at or
above 5- 6 degrees Celsius.

Somewhere at a 5-6 degree Celsius increase in average global
temperature, [added to the massive additional tipping point of
**releases of methane** from coastal deposits and
permafrost]{.underline}, will quickly [further skyrocket atmospheric
carbon levels and average global temperatures]{.underline} to new levels
faster than at any previous time in humanity\'s history. This will also
trigger, initiate, and accelerate the final phases of runaway global
warming.

Here is how this happens. At a 5-6 degree Celsius temperature increase,
[the coastal deposits and permafrost begin releasing methane at
**exponentially higher rates**, or in other words, the \"methane time
bomb\" goes off.]{.underline}

This will take us from the 5-6 degree Celsius atmospheric carbon level
of 500-600 parts per million (ppm) far too quickly to the atmospheric
carbon levels of 800 ppm, 1,000 ppm, 1,200 ppm, and even to 1,600 ppm
and beyond. (Our climate was stable for hundreds of thousands of years
at about carbon 270 ppm.) We are currently at about carbon 420 ppm. (The
recent carbon 270 to 415 ppm increase occurred since the beginning of
the Industrial Revolution, which was powered by burning fossil fuels.)

[Jacqueline Goordial, a CIFAR Azrieli **Global Scholar**]{.underline} in
the Earth 4D: Subsurface Science & Exploration program, recalls her last
visit to the Canadian Arctic. From the helicopter, she and her team flew
over a [large **permafrost** site]{.underline} that is [thawing at such
a pace that the edges of its structure are slumping]{.underline}, as
though a giant had taken a bite out of the soil underneath the surface.

Once on land, and venturing through thigh-high mud and tundra, the team
drove their instruments deep into the permafrost face, next to a
**[thousand year old]{.underline}** wedge of ice formation --- they were
there to [measure **methane** levels seeping out from the frozen
ground.]{.underline}

The [next day,]{.underline} they came back to find the [permafrost thaw
face had **melted away**]{.underline}, along with their instruments.

"That was [less than **24 hours**]{.underline}," says Goordial. "This is
a [structure]{.underline} that's been [frozen for thousands of
years]{.underline}, and I [see it erode in real time, inch by inch,
within a day]{.underline}."

The rapid erosion of permafrost is one of a myriad of alarming examples
of the effects of climate change --- whether it is shrinking glaciers,
frequent extreme weather events, increased food scarcity or rising sea
levels. Goordial's work examines how [**microbial life persists** within
extreme subsurface environments such as permafrost]{.underline} and
oceanic crust/marine sediments.

Though Goordial's instruments were irretrievable in that instance, her
team has been successful in collecting methane data in the Canadian
Arctic.

"We [install chambers into the face of the permafrost]{.underline} and
one of the things that we [see]{.underline} is that there is an
[**instant release** of methane coming from these **fast erosional**
features]{.underline}," explains Goordial. "We have [a lot of **old
carbon** frozen away.]{.underline}"

[As the permafrost is rapidly melting, it is releasing trapped methane
from **microorganisms** underground. Methane is **25 times** as potent
at trapping heat in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2), and
eventually **combines** with oxygen to create **CO2**.]{.underline}

[Permafrost in the Northern Hemisphere is currently trapping about
**1,700 tonnes of carbon**, including methane and CO2. In]{.underline} a
March 2021 feature in [Nature]{.underline} on effects of thawing
permafrost, [climate scientists describe the disappearing permafrost
landscape as having the potential to trigger a **massive "carbon
bomb."**]{.underline}

"One of the things that we fear will happen when it thaws is [some of
that carbon will become **newly available** to microorganisms that have
gone from this frozen state, to a **warmer state**]{.underline}. Then,
[through their own **metabolism**, these microorganisms will convert
that carbon into **more greenhouse gases**]{.underline}," explains
Goordial.

Additionally, [permafrost temperatures are rising, leading to thawing
that releases stored greenhouse gases]{.underline}, further amplifying
global warming \[94\]. The [thawing of permafrost in the Arctic has
far-reaching consequences for both infrastructure and
ecosystems]{.underline}. Permafrost, which is ground that remains frozen
for at least two consecutive years, underpins much of the Arctic
landscape. As temperatures rise, the stability of this frozen ground is
compromised, [leading to]{.underline} several negative impacts such as
[structural damage in buildings, roads, pipelines, and other
infrastructure built on permafrost which are at risk of damage as the
ground thaws]{.underline} and becomes J. O. Kayode-Edwards et al. 79
unstable \[84\]. The thawing of permafrost can also affect the
reliability of transportation networks as roads and airstrips can become
uneven or impassable, disrupting travel and supply routes for Arctic
communities \[25\].

Furthermore, [settlement]{.underline} (the compression of the ground
beneath a building due to its weight) and subsistence (the movement of
foundations due to the action of materials beneath them) [can cause
foundations to crack and collapse, necessitating costly repairs and
redesigns]{.underline}. [Changes in vegetation and ground stability
impact wildlife habitats]{.underline}. Species that rely on specific
conditions, such as the tundra-dwelling caribou and migratory birds, may
find their habitats shrinking or shifting. The thawing permafrost alters
the landscape, affecting plant communities as well. As the ground
becomes wetter, some areas may experience increased plant growth, while
others may see a decline in species that depend on dry, frozen
conditions. The permafrost thawing equally affects the hydrological
cycle, leading to changes in the flow of rivers and streams \[97\].

This can impact fish populations and other aquatic life, as well as
water availability for human use. [Faster flow rates and increased
sediment load can affect fish spawning areas and reduce water quality,
potentially leading to shifts in species composition and declines in
biodiversity]{.underline}.

Permafrost contains vast amounts of organic material that, when frozen,
is relatively stable. However, [as permafrost thaws, this organic
material decomposes, releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Methane is a particularly potent greenhouse gas, with a global warming
potential many times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year
period]{.underline} \[28\]. [The release of methane from thawing
permafrost can signifcantly amplify global warming as it creates a
positive feedback loop]{.underline}. As more methane is released, global
temperatures rise further, leading to more permafrost thaw and
additional greenhouse gas emissions.

Thawing permafrost also leads to the release of CO2 through the
increased decomposition of organic material. This contributes to the
overall greenhouse gas burden in the atmosphere, with potential impacts
on weather patterns, sea level rise, and the frequency of extreme
weather events. [Current climate models may underestimate the potential
contributions of permafrost thaw to future greenhouse gas
concentrations]{.underline}, highlighting the need for more
comprehensive data and improved modeling.

Permafrost Thaw in the Warming Arctic: Final Remarks

[**Siberia**, like much of the world, had a year like no
other]{.underline}. Stories about an [**unprecedented six-month
heatwave** and raging wildfires throughout Russia's Northern
regions]{.underline} filtered into the mainstream media. These alarming
headlines reminded the world that climate change and its effects are
being felt now, especially in the Far North. The [Arctic]{.underline},
which is [warming]{.underline} at least [**two times faster** than the
rest of the world]{.underline}, is a [harbinger **signaling dire
consequences** if we cannot keep global warming below **1.5 degrees
Celsius**]{.underline}.1) Hidden underneath these extreme events is a
quieter but no less pressing [threat]{.underline} that could prevent us
from meeting that goal; one that may prove [pivotal]{.underline} if we
hope [to curb global carbon emissions: **thawing
permafrost**.]{.underline}

In order to be considered [permafrost]{.underline}, the ground must
[remain]{.underline} at or below [freezing for at least two consecutive
years]{.underline}.2) It traditionally [acts as a "**carbon sink**,"
where carbon has been captured and stored. Scientists estimate that this
layer contains approximately **1,400 gigatons** of frozen carbon, the
equivalent of **four times** the amount **humans** have emitted since
the Industrial Revolution and **two times** as much as is **currently**
**contained** in the environment.3) If this captured carbon were allowed
to escape into the atmosphere, it would contribute to]{.underline} what
may already be [a **runaway greenhouse effect** that could render even
the **most ambitious** attempts to cut global emissions **ineffective**.
Essentially, we could make **every necessary sacrifice** and still see
global temperatures rise above 1.5 degrees Celsius if the Arctic becomes
a major carbon source instead of remaining a carbon sink]{.underline}. A
recent NASA-funded study suggests that this shift is already happening
due to winter soil emissions. According to Sue Natali of the Woods Hole
Research Center, carbon emissions at individual sites are surpassing
carbon uptake. It remains to be seen if this transition is occurring
throughout the entire Arctic region. This development makes
understanding and incorporating permafrost thaw emissions into the
global carbon budget even more pressing.4)

Despite the potential ramifications of emissions from permafrost thaw,
[the **global carbon budget**, which balances the carbon dioxide (CO2)
output from human activities with the input or storage in carbon sinks,
does **not fully** **incorporate** this emission source]{.underline}.5)
Ensuring that permafrost thaw is included in this calculation is
critical in making our current goals reachable. Fortunately, the recent
events in Siberia are bringing a new level of awareness to the [leading
role]{.underline} that [permafrost will play in]{.underline} our future
[**success or failure** in staying below 1.5 degrees of
warming.]{.underline} In examining these events, we can better
understand the relationship between extreme weather, its impact on
permafrost, and the consequences if the international community fails to
account for this looming threat.

The six-month heatwave in Siberia contributed to raising the world's
average temperature to the hottest on record.6) [From January through
the end of June, Siberia was subjected to record high temperatures. One
of the world's **coldest towns,** Verkhoyansk, saw **100-degree
days**]{.underline}.7) According to Zeke Hausfather, the Director of
Climate and Energy at the Breakthrough Institute in Oakland, California,
Siberia's temperatures were "extreme no matter how you look at them."8).
These [temperatures]{.underline} concerned scientists because of their
[potential to **increase the rate of thaw** in the Arctic. High,
prolonged temperatures melt more ice and snow, which expose the **darker
sub-layers.** Without the layer of white snow and the **protective
albedo effect** it provides, the soil begins to **thaw**. This, in turn,
exposes more dark soil, which leads to further melting and so on. As the
thaw moves deeper into the soil, **nutrients are released**, allowing
plants and shrubs to grow, darkening the surface even more. As this
**positive, self-reinforcing feedback** continues, more CO2 is emitted.
Carbon dioxide is a significant contributor to global warming, resulting
in more **extreme weather** and other climate events that amplify the
cycle. Scientists fear that these local feedback loops will contribute
to a **global loop** with **disastrous, irreversible**
consequences.]{.underline} Unfortunately, high temperatures have also
led to other devastating events in the Arctic.

In Siberia, these protracted, unusually [high temperatures]{.underline}
have [result]{.underline}ed [in]{.underline} conditions that have
contributed to **[extreme wildfires]{.underline}**. According to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Earth Observatory,
Siberia's 2020 fire season released more carbon dioxide in June and July
than any other fire season since 2003.9) These wildfires [**burn off
the** **organic layers** of moss and other decomposing plants that form
on top of permafrost-affected soils. That organic matter typically acts
as a **blanket** in the summertime to keep the darker, deeper soil
insulated from the heat of the sun. However, the deeper layers of
permafrost, having already thawed more than usual during the winter
months from a reduced albedo effect, are now **more susceptible to
thaw** in layers that would typically stay frozen even in the summer
months. When **wildfires burn off** that summertime insulation, the
initial loss of insulating materials kicks off a sequence of **local
feedback loops, amplifying** permafrost thaw.]{.underline}10) Dr.
Charles Koven, an Earth System Scientist for the University of
California, Berkeley, notes that the permafrost research community's
[ability to incorporate extreme events like wildfires into their climate
models is limited]{.underline}. However, [there is]{.underline} also a
[basic agreement]{.underline} that "there is a possibility that these
[extreme events]{.underline} are **[amplify]{.underline}**ing [and
speed]{.underline}ing [up things]{.underline}."

There is a [growing **consensus** among scientists and policymakers that
this critical emissions source needs to be better
represented]{.underline} in our climate models. Many in the permafrost
research community, those who have been studying it and speaking up
about it for years, worry that despite our best efforts and sacrifices,
[we may **not be able** to keep global warming below the goal of 1.5
degrees **unless we consider these** **feedback loops.**]{.underline}
Dr. Koven estimates that about 100 gigatons of CO2 will need to be
subtracted from the current global carbon budget to account for these
emissions. While there is still significant uncertainty concerning the
amount of CO2 held in permafrost, [the impact of extreme events, and the
rate of thaw]{.underline}, it [is vital that the international community
not ignore the situation]{.underline} until the models are improved.
With permafrost thaw incorporated into the global carbon budget,
policymakers will be better able to make decisions based on a more
realistic picture of the actions countries will need to take to meet
their carbon emission goals. Even so, including estimated emissions from
permafrost thaw will just be the first step. Ongoing international
cooperation will be essential in developing more effective observation
networks and funding additional research in this critical area.

to all life forms on Earth, including humankind. Changes to ecosystem

One sentence summary

We describe the devastating effects of nuclear radiation and its
long-lasting consequences on Earth's ecosystems.

Main text

Recent events related to the armed conflict in Ukraine have been linked
to the possibility of radioactive leaks, the risk of using "tactical
nuclear bombs," or even full-scale nuclear war. The shelling of the
Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant represents a particular risk. As
environmental scientists, ecologists, and conservationists from all
corners of the world, we would like to call upon all scientists to
communicate the risks associated with radiation to the public and
policymakers. We must be proactive and explain to our people the stark
implications of an accidental nuclear leak, the use of tactical bombs,
or a full-scale nuclear war if any of these were to happen. Our ethical
and professional duty is to communicate the multiple potential
consequences to life on Earth, including humankind. We propose a key
summary of facts to communicate our concerns to leaders, stakeholders,
and society effectively.

In any socioecological system, many variables, components, and processes
can be affected by human intervention. [**Radiation leakage** and
nuclear explosions can severely affect natural (and anthropogenic)
systems.]{.underline} Adding a major disturbance to the intrinsic
uncertainty and unpredictability of these systems (Battisti et al.,
2016). Any nuclear explosion can trigger ecological consequences far
beyond the site where it occurs. Nuclear weapons can release massive
radiation with total burdens of radionuclides amounting to millions of
curies of strontium, cesium, plutonium, and carbon (Leaning, 2000;
Pereira et al., 2022). [Those consequences are long-lasting, affect
ecosystem structure and function, lead to decline and local extinctions,
**severely hamper life on Earth**, and reduce opportunities for humans
to sustain our civilization]{.underline} (Leaning, 2000; Burkitbayev et
al., 2011).

[The importance of Arctic sea ice **cannot be overstated**]{.underline}.
President Niinistö of Finland said during a meeting with Former
President Trump on August 28th, 2017, "**[If we lose the Arctic, we lose
the globe]{.underline}**. That is reality." Niinistö was summarizing the
dire state of the environmental situation with his words of warning. I
assume the president of Finland is not a scientist, although he is
knowledgeable. As one consequence, I will turn to scientific sources
that support and clarify Niinistö's claim.

Adding peer-reviewed information to President Niinistö's claim,
Professor Mark C. Urban wrote in the renowned peer-reviewed journal
Science on 14 February 2020, "**[Arctic ice acts as Earth's air
conditioner]{.underline}**." Science is the premier journal of the
prestigious American Association for the Advancement of Science, an
organization founded in 1848. If you're doing the math, that's 173 years
of supporting and promoting science at the national level. Urban was and
is the director of the Center of Biological Risk and is also a professor
in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University
of Connecticut. He was merely reflecting an overwhelming abundance of
scientific knowledge with his paper in Science, which was titled, "Life
without ice."

[There will be several contributors to rapid planetary heating in the
wake of an ice-free Arctic]{.underline} Ocean. [Primary among
these]{.underline} contributors are: 1) **[loss of
albedo]{.underline}**; 2) **[latent heat]{.underline}**; 3) **[loss of
aerosol masking; and]{.underline}** 4) **[release of
methane]{.underline}** from the relatively shallow continental shelves
in the Arctic Ocean. [Each]{.underline} of these factors [has been
described **at length** in]{.underline} the [peer-reviewed
literature]{.underline}. As a result, I will provide only a brief
summary here.

First, some context. We currently occupy the warmest planet in the
history of civilizations on Earth, as pointed out by James Hansen and 14
other colleagues in their 18 July 2017 peer-reviewed paper, "Young
people's burden: requirement of negative CO2 emissions." I can assure
you that the planet has not cooled since 2017. According to the opening
chapter in the 2020 book, The Intersection of Environmental Justice,
Climate Change, and the Ecology of Life by Ande A. Nesmith and seven
other scholars: "The science tells us that the planet is warming faster
than predicted or imagined." The phrase, "faster than predicted or
imagined" sounds bad. Actually, it sounds beyond bad.

[The rate of environmental change is critically important to **retention
of habitat** for all species, including humans]{.underline}. As I have
pointed out in this space, most recently in the November 2021 issue,
Strona and Bradshaw wrote in the peer-reviewed journal Scientific
Reports on 13 November 2018 that the ex**[tinction of all life on Earth
is to be expected from]{.underline}** the ongoing and projected rates of
**[planetary overheating]{.underline}**. This is happening very quickly,
and [the]{.underline} rapid [rate of environmental change in the wake of
an ice-free Arctic Ocean **spells disaster for life on
Earth**]{.underline}.

First up with respect to [loss of sea ice on the Arctic Ocean is loss of
albedo]{.underline}, or reflectance. [As long as ice remains floating on
the surface of the Arctic]{.underline} Ocean, [that ice will reflect
incoming sunlight]{.underline}, thereby [preventing]{.underline} the
incoming sunlight from additionally [overheating]{.underline} Earth.
[When]{.underline} the [ice disappears and is replaced by]{.underline}
the [dark blue water]{.underline} of the ocean, then [incoming sunlight
will **rapidly heat the water**]{.underline}. An already overheated
ocean finally led the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to admit
that climate change is irreversible in September of 2019 with the IPCC's
Special Report on Oceans and the Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. The
planetary temperature has neither cooled nor stabilized since September,
2019. Professor Jennifer MacKinnon at the Scripps Institution and also
at the University of California-San Diego expects the Arctic sea ice to
be gone by next year and only thenceforth develop during the winter
months. She admits, however, that we might get an extra year, as was
indicated by Harvard professor James Anderson in Forbes on 15 January
2018. [Loss of Arctic sea ice]{.underline} by 2023 [translates to loss
of habitat for humans and most other organisms]{.underline} within the
coming year as the diminishing loss of sea ice accelerates, thereby
[leading to **disrupted patterns of atmospheric circulation, intensified
local warming**, and **profound changes in precipitation**]{.underline}.

[Loss of albedo leads directly to]{.underline} the next important topic,
latent heat or, specifically, **[latent heat of fusion]{.underline}**.
The latent heat of fusion is a very big deal. Once we lose sea ice
floating on top the Arctic Ocean, [all the sunlight]{.underline}
currently [going into melting the ice will **instead heat the
water**]{.underline}. It will not take long before that [**overheated
seawater translates into an overheated atmosphere**. A quickly
overheated atmosphere means the **quick loss of habitat for humans and
other organisms**]{.underline}. I wrote about this topic with my
peer-reviewed article in Academia Letters, published 1 April 2021.
Barring a near-term solution to this impending disaster, **[we
will]{.underline}** soon **[be saying our final
good-byes]{.underline}**. The rapid rate of change in our wake will be
sufficient to cause the loss of all life on Earth.

[When we lose Arctic sea ice, the temperature will rise **beyond our
ability to grow, store, and distribute grains**]{.underline} at a large
scale. That's inconvenient because [the ability to grow, store, and
distribute grains at a large scale is what **characterizes every
civilization**]{.underline}, including the one in which we are currently
embedded. Again, [loss of civilization translates to near-term loss of
habitat for human animals because of the]{.underline} attendant [**loss
of aerosol masking** leading to a rapid rise in global-average
temperature]{.underline}.

The aerosol masking effect has been reported in more than two dozen
peer-reviewed papers dating back to 1929. Most recently, the conclusion
in the prestigious journal Nature Communications on 15 June 2021 comes
via title: "Significant underestimation of radiative forcing by
aerosol-cloud interactions derived from satellite-based methods." As
with most scientific endeavors, previous research has underestimated the
aerosol masking effect. According to this recent paper in Nature
Communications, [loss of aerosol masking will lead to a **55 percent
increase in global-average temperature**, and a **133** percen
**increase over land**]{.underline}. Earth has already warmed more than
2 C above the 1750 baseline according to renowned professor Andrew Y.
Glikson's October 2020 book, The Event Horizon, leading to the
initiation of several self-**[reinforcing]{.underline}** feedback loops
(so-called "**[positive feedbacks]{.underline}**").

Finally, [the abrupt release of methane from]{.underline} the relatively
[shallow continental shelves beneath the Arctic]{.underline} Ocean
[poses an **existential threat**]{.underline}. This idea was initially
presented by Dr. Natalia Shakhova and three other scholars at the
European Geophysical Union annual conference in April, 2008. Their
abstract from the presentation includes these lines: "We consider
[release of]{.underline} up to 50 Gt of predicted amount of [hydrate
storage]{.underline} as highly possible for abrupt release at any time.
That [may cause ∼12-times increase of modern atmospheric methane burden
with consequent **catastrophic greenhouse warming**]{.underline}."
Notice that an ice-free Arctic Ocean was not required for this
catastrophic release of methane. It still isn't.

[When humans exit the planetary stage, the uncontrolled meltdown of the
world's nuclear power facilities]{.underline} will [cause atmospheric
**ozone to be stripped away**]{.underline}, as indicated by the loss of
stratospheric ozone in the wake of the Toba supervolcano about 74,000
years ago [combined with the loss of magnetic protection]{.underline} in
the wake of ionizing radiation in exoplanets from nearby stars.

[With the extinction of our species comes not only the stripping away of
atmospheric ozone, but also the rapid loss of aerosol masking
and]{.underline} therefore [a stunningly **rapid rate of environmental
change**]{.underline}. In other words, Homo sapiens has inadvertently
become the most important species in the history of the planet: **[We
alone can trigger extinction of life on Earth through a variety of
means]{.underline}**. And we have already pulled the trigger,
unfortunately, through each of those means.

SINGAPORE, May 21 (Reuters) - [Rising sea levels could severely disrupt
crude oil shipments and erode energy security in import-dependent
countries like China, South Korea and Japan, with many of the world\'s
biggest terminals vulnerable to flooding]{.underline}, researchers said
on Tuesday.

Melting ice and swelling seas caused by rising temperatures could
\"unleash unstoppable multi-metre (sea level rise) which will not only
sink key oil ports and disrupt global oil trade but also swamp coastal
refineries and petrochemical facilities\", the China Water Risk (CWR)
think tank warned in a report.

A 2021 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated
that on current trends, average sea levels could rise by more than a
metre by the end of the century, adding that a two-metre rise could not
be ruled out.

Low-lying ports and bunkering facilities would be especially vulnerable
to higher sea levels, CWR said after conducting a \"stress test\" of the
maritime infrastructure used to export and import crude oil.

It said 12 out of the top 15 tanker terminals were expected to be
impacted by one metre of sea level rise, including five based in Asia.

[Up to **42% of global crude oil** exports from Saudi Arabia, Russia,
the United States and the United Arab Emirates were at risk, affecting
45% of crude shipments to China, the United States, South Korea and the
Netherlands, it said.]{.underline}

Years after the Deepwater Horizon spill, crews still were finding
remnants of the leaked oil in the environment, Savitz said.

Much of the oil eventually makes its way into the air as sea spray or
evaporating water, leaving behind an oily residue on shores, said Rick
Luettich, director of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
Institute of Marine Sciences.

### Impact\-\--Whales\-\--2NC

#### Saving whales saves the planet.

Rachel **Pannett 22**, Global News Reporter at The Washington Post,
"Want to save the planet? Saving whales could help, scientists say.",
The Washington Post, 12-15-2022, accessed 07-02-2025,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/12/15/whales-carbon-sink-climate-change-sequestration,

**[Saving whales is]{.underline}** probably **[a good way to save the
planet]{.underline}**, according to a group of scientists who examined
[the animals' potential to act as a carbon sink]{.underline} ---
something that [helps reduce carbon in the Earth's atmosphere by
absorbing more carbon than it releases]{.underline}.

Many nature-based solutions to fighting climate change have focused on
the ability of trees and wetlands to capture and store atmospheric
carbon dioxide. But in a paper published Thursday in the journal Trends
in Ecology and Evolution, a group of biologists explores the idea that
whales can influence the amount of carbon in the air and in the ocean,
potentially contributing to the overall reduction of atmospheric carbon
dioxide.

"Understanding the role of whales in the carbon cycle is a dynamic and
emerging field that may benefit both marine conservation and
climate-change strategies," wrote the authors, led by Heidi Pearson, a
biologist from the University of Alaska Southeast.

[The ocean is]{.underline} by far [the world's largest carbon
sink]{.underline}, having absorbed about 40 percent of all carbon
dioxide emitted from the burning of fossil fuels since the Industrial
Revolution.

[Marine biologists]{.underline} recently [discovered that
whales]{.underline}, particularly great whales, also [play an important
role in **capturing carbon**]{.underline} from the atmosphere. They can
weigh up to 28 tons and live over 100 years, the researchers wrote, and
[their size and long lives mean they accumulate more carbon in their
bodies than other small animals. When they die, they sink]{.underline}
to the bottom of the ocean, **[taking carbon out of the atmosphere for
centuries]{.underline}**.

"Whales consume up to 4 percent of their massive body weight in krill
and photosynthetic plankton every day. For the blue whale, this equates
to nearly 8,000 pounds," the scientists wrote. "When they finish
digesting their food, [their excrement is rich in important nutrients
that help]{.underline} these [krill and plankton flourish, aiding in
increased photosynthesis and carbon storage]{.underline} from the
atmosphere."

A 2019 report published by the International Monetary Fund estimated
that a great whale sequesters 33 tons of carbon dioxide each year on
average, while a tree absorbs only up to 48 pounds a year --- a figure
the report's authors used to suggest that conservationists could be
better off saving whales than planting trees.

The new paper explores how a recovery in whale populations to
pre-whaling levels --- between 4 million and 5 million, from slightly
more than 1.3 million in 2019, according to the IMF report --- could
increase the animals' ability to act as a carbon sink. (Commercial
hunting, the main reason whales' numbers have dwindled, has decreased
their populations by 81 percent, the researchers said.)

Among a number of whale species, the amount of carbon that was being
sequestered "jumps up by one or two orders of magnitude" with a recovery
in the whale population, said Stephen Wing, a co-author of the paper and
a marine science professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand.

The numbers are "relatively small" considering the scope of the global
climate challenge, "but relative to the promises that some nations make
on reducing CO2 emissions, they're relatively large," he added.

"We're kind of hind casting and saying the recovery could achieve
pre-whaling numbers because the system has previously sustained that
number of whales," Wing said.

[Whales]{.underline}, along with a number of ocean animals, [are
vulnerable to climate change, as rising temperatures drive them into new
habitats. They rank among the world's most endangered marine
mammals]{.underline}, including the North Atlantic right whale, only
about 340 of which remain.

[Whales are]{.underline} still being [killed in **startlingly high
numbers**, years after commercial whaling was banned]{.underline}, in
waters brimming with [ships]{.underline} that [strike them and
ropes]{.underline} that [entangle them. Offshore wind
turbines]{.underline} --- part of President Biden's clean energy agenda
--- [are]{.underline} also [poised to encroach on their
habitat]{.underline} as the administration tries to balance tackling
global warming with protecting wildlife.

"[Whale recovery has the potential for **long-term self-sustained
enhancement of the ocean carbon sink**]{.underline}," the authors wrote.
"The full carbon dioxide reduction role of great whales (and other
organisms) will only be realized through robust conservation and
management interventions that directly promote population increases."

The authors were cautious on the math behind including whale carbon in
any wider climate-change mitigation strategies just yet, however, as
there are still many scientific unknowns. They argued that recent
studies valuing the carbon contribution of a single blue whale at \$1.4
million "are based on assumptions beyond our understanding of whale
ecology and biological oceanography."

#### Whales are key to the [entire food chain]{.underline}\-\--they distribute nutrients and prevent ocean acidification. 

Kirsten Freja **Young &** Marion **Rossi 25**, Senior Lecturer in
Ecology at the University of Exeter, Ph.D. in Ecology from the
University of Exeter; Research Fellow in Climate Systems at the
University of Exeter, "Why whale urine is so important to life in the

Even biologists only capture a glimpse of the lives of whales. There are
still many species whose lives are largely a mystery, particularly the
deep diving whales.

But scientists are learning more about the role that whales play in
marine ecosystems and the services that they provide. Recent research is
showing that even **[whale urine is important for Earth]{.underline}**.

Previous work suggested that [whale feces]{.underline} was important to
ecosystems. These giant mammals [bring nutrients from the
depths]{.underline} where they feed [to shallow waters]{.underline}.

This effect is called [the]{.underline} \"[whale pump]{.underline}\" and
it [can enhance the photosynthetic rate of plankton, which is the
**basis of the food web**]{.underline}. Nutrients are not distributed
evenly across the ocean and in some areas, phytoplankton populations are
limited because there aren\'t enough of specific elements, such as iron.

Some [whale species perform long migrations]{.underline} across the
ocean. Humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) perform the longest
migration of any mammal at around 10,000 km, moving nutrients across
ocean basins as they travel. To some extent, [the whale pump influences
**carbon cycling and storage**]{.underline} too.

[Whales]{.underline} can also help [cycle nutrients in the ocean when
they disturb the seabed as they feed]{.underline}. Gray whales
(Eschrichtius robustus), for example, are known to forage for
invertebrates on the seafloor and stir up sediments which release
nutrients, [such as nitrogen, phosphorus and iron]{.underline}.

Another key area of research describes the oasis ecosystems that [whale
carcasses]{.underline} provide to deep sea species, from hagfish
(Eptatretus deani) and sleeper sharks (Somniosis pacificus) to
crustacea, mollusks, nematodes and bacteria. The great whales
[have]{.underline} large bodies with [high amounts of
lipids]{.underline} in their bones. These [lipids are food for lots of
organisms and whale carcasses create **mini ecosystems**]{.underline} in
the deep.

But until now, another benefit that whales provided to ecosystems had
not been quantified---that of urine.

A recent study published in Nature Communications indicates that baleen
[whales\' urine could]{.underline} also [have a **crucial
function**]{.underline} in oceans. Some whale species can produce up to
950 liters of urine per day, and this means [they]{.underline} can
[relocate nutrients to tropical grounds low in nutrients]{.underline}.
Many [baleen whales]{.underline}, such as humpback and gray whales,
[feed in **polar and subpolar regions**]{.underline} during summer,
[then migrate to equatorial breeding areas]{.underline} en masse into
relatively small areas during the winter.

During migration, the whales carry detritus like placenta, urine, feces
and if they die, carcasses. For example, the paper describes how gray
whales tend to winter in several feeding grounds across the north
Pacific Ocean and aggregate in summer in a few small bays on the coast
of California.

The researchers describe how gray, humpback and right
[whales]{.underline} (Eubalaena glacialis) [transport carbon and
nitrogen to the tropics, in]{.underline} what they call
[the]{.underline} \"**[great whale conveyor belt]{.underline}**.\"
Globally, for these species, this process results in more than 46,000
tons of biomass (whales\' total mass and the nutrients they contain) and
almost 4,000 tons of nitrogen per year, transferred to poor nutrient
grounds.

Most of this nitrogen transport comes from whale [urine]{.underline},
which [stimulates **phytoplankton growth** and **photosynthesis**.
This]{.underline} increase in the rate of photosynthesis [could lead to
18,180 tons of **carbon being drawn down from the
atmosphere**]{.underline}. Other large baleen whales probably also
contribute to this effect but there is less data on their distributions
and ecology.

### Impact\-\--Whales\-\--U

#### Whale population increasing -- previous models are wrong

**Owen-McLaughlin \'24** \[Niamh Owen-Mclaughlin; A graduate of
University College London (UCL) with a BA Geography; 8-26-2024; \"Rapid
increase rates in large whale populations continue until they near

Accessed 7-5-2025; AY\]

In a new study challenging conventional thinking about how populations
of large baleen whales recover from whaling, [researchers have revealed
that populations continue **increasing rapidly** for a wide range of
recovery levels, only slowing once approaching pre-whaling levels. This
could have wide implications for how agencies from across the world
manage whale populations, and when we think a population has fully
recovered from overexploitation.]{.underline}

Published in July 2024 in the Journal of Applied Ecology, the team used
whale abundance data from bowhead, gray and humpback whales, focusing on
populations with long-term studies that covered a wide range of
abundance levels from low to high. The collaborative research team was
comprised of Dr. Yu Kanaji (Fisheries Resources Institute, Japan
Fisheries Research and Education Agency), Dr. Rob Williams (Oceans
Initiative), Dr. Alex Zerbini (Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean
and Ecosystem Studies (CICOES) at the University of Washington, NOAA
Alaska Fisheries Science Center, and Marine Ecology and Telemetry
Research), and Professor Trevor Branch (University of Washington School
of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences). They demonstrated that recovery levels
are more rapid than previously thought. [Before now, the **prevailing
thought** was that population growth slows quickly as populations
rebuild.]{.underline}

Standard ecological theory, also known as density dependence, holds that
as populations increase, they compete more for food, and eventually it
gets harder to find food, resulting in slower growth in body size, lower
survival, and lower birth rates, all of which result in slower
population recovery at higher abundance. This theory has resulted in the
International Whaling Commission (IWC) designating 60% as the minimum
target for whale recovery, basing this off thinking that whale
populations increase in numbers most rapidly at 60% of pre-whaling
abundance. The new study shows that, on average, 80% is a more
reflective figure for large whales, with recovery rates being high over
a wide range of abundance levels.

[This study changes global thinking about whale recovery and management,
with the research team expecting whale populations to recover at rapid
rates over a much wider range of abundance levels, plus a longer time
period to reach management targets if the target increases from 60% to
80%.]{.underline}

The study, sixteen years in the making, started off at a Scientific
Committee of the IWC in 2008, where scientists Alex Zerbini and Trevor
Branch wondered if it was reasonable for the IWC to assume that recovery
slows down as populations increase. Rob Williams then tracked down the
history of this concept as used by the IWC. Fast forward a few years
with key contributions from Felipe Hurtado-Ferro and a visit by lead
author Yu Kanaji to the University of Washington in 2019-2020, and the
project was completed.

Using estimates of abundance in each year, the team focused on four
whale populations that have a long time series of data: bowhead whales
in the Arctic Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas, gray whales in the eastern
North Pacific, and humpback whales in the eastern North Pacific and
eastern Australia.

They fit sophisticated Bayesian models to these data to estimate not
just the rate of recovery, but also how that rate changes with
abundance, which is where the difficulty comes in. Little is known about
where density dependence operates: does it affect recovery at low,
medium, or only high abundance levels? It requires very good data to
estimate changes in recovery rates, and these kinds of data are very
hard to come by. By fitting the models to the data, they could estimate
how much whale recovery rates slow down as the population increases.

The new results have multiple implications for the management of whale
populations, beyond the expectation that increase rates remain high
across a broad range of population sizes. [In particular, the research
team suggests that international recovery targets, currently set at 60%
of pre-whaling levels, should be increased to a **default of 80%,**
since this is where maximum population increase occurs.]{.underline}

across the frozen carcasses of 11 beached bowhead whales, [enormous
marine mammals that have made a slow but steady comeback since they were
driven to the brink of extinction by late 19th and early 20th century
whalers.]{.underline}

[Unsure of what killed the whales, the hunters contacted
officials]{.underline} at Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Prevented from
flying up by the Covid quarantine, scientists instead examined photos
and tissue samples sent by the Inuit. [The whales were young, thin, and
scarred by what looked like teeth marks.]{.underline}

"There was no smoking gun," according to biologist Jeff Higdon. But he
says that the perpetrators were very likely orcas, also called [killer
whales, which were rarely seen in the High Arctic until sea ice began to
retreat, opening pathways for other marine life, including salmon, **to
enter.**]{.underline}

What makes this situation even more intriguing, according to University
of Manitoba evolutionary geneticist Colin Garroway, is that these
[killer whales are likely members of an ecotype --- a **genetically
distinct** geographic variety]{.underline} --- that has begun migrating
farther into previously icy regions of the Arctic from as far away as
Spain. [Unlike orcas in other parts of the Arctic, which eat fish, this
ecotype preys on large mammals]{.underline}. If their numbers continue
to grow, say scientists who are watching this closely, they could upend
or shift the food web in ways that could affect Inuit subsistence
hunting and some endangered whale populations.

We know that whales, dolphins and porpoises are amazing beings with
complex social and family lives, and we are leaning more about them all
the time. But we are only beginning to understand that [whales are
essential in ensuring a healthy ocean and helping us combat climate
change.]{.underline}

The ocean is our largest carbon sink, and it is the life within it that
makes this possible. We are learning that whales and dolphins are
fundamental to the ocean\'s ability to take carbon out of our atmosphere
and lock it away.

We are starting to understand that as [whales go about their long lives,
they circulate nutrients throughout the ocean.]{.underline} These
nutrients are [**essential** for the whole marine ecosystem, from the
smallest animals, such as krill, to the largest, including the whales
themselves, and also for **phytoplankton growth**.
Phytoplankton]{.underline} are microscopic plant-like organisms that
absorb carbon dioxide, [capturing nearly a third of human-made carbon
dioxide]{.underline}. They also provide oxygen which sustains most of
the rest of the life in the ocean. Because of this, they are key to
helping us combat both the climate and biodiversity crises.

Circle of life

So, [how do whales circulate these nutrients?]{.underline} The research
shows there are two main ways. [The first is known as the \'whale
pump\'. As whales dive deep to feed and then return to the surface to
breathe, they **stir up the nutrients** that other species need to
survive and that would otherwise just sink to the seafloor and be
unavailable]{.underline}

Poo power

When at the surface, [whales release huge amounts of poo, which is
**rich with nutrients**, particularly iron.]{.underline} So, by moving
up and down the water column and pooing at the surface, whales \'pump\'
vital nutrients around. [Some species such as the sperm whale are really
deep divers to depths of over 2,000 metres. A case study demonstrates
how, through the whale pump, the population of sperm whales in the
Southern Ocean stimulate phytoplankton growth to remove over 180
thousand tonnes of carbon from our atmosphere every year,]{.underline}
the same amount of carbon removed each year by eight million trees.

Whale conveyor belt

The [second way whales circulate these nutrients is across the ocean on
their skin and in their urine,]{.underline} for example, as they
undertake their long migrations. This is known as the \'great whale
conveyor\'. [Studies on the migration of blue whales in the Southern
Ocean show that these whales carry nutrients with them on their journeys
which enable phytoplankton to **flourish**,]{.underline} which in turn
lock away 24-thousand-trees-worth of carbon each year[. It is estimated
that if this population of blue whales recovered to pre-whaling numbers
they could lock away 6.6 million trees worth of carbon.]{.underline}

#### Phytoplankton are key to [all marine life]{.underline}.

Central to Life on Earth. How Is Climate Change Affecting Them?",

Plankton are divided into two groups: phytoplankton, which are plants,
and zooplankton, which are animals. However, in the plankton world, the
distinction between plant and animal is complicated. Some organisms get
their nutrition from photosynthesis; others get it by eating other
organisms; some organisms are photosynthetic, but also eat other
organisms; some bacteria are also classified as plankton and are
decomposers; and many more organisms are in between or do multiple
things.

In terms of photosynthetic organisms, there is far more diversity in
ocean plankton than on land, said Juhl. There are probably 100,000
different species of phytoplankton, each of which may have different
characteristics, different ecological functions, and different
distributions. Zooplankton, too, include many, many, different groups.

[Phytoplankton]{.underline}, which, like land plants, contain
chlorophyll, are found near the surface because they [need the sun's
rays. They use sunlight and nutrients such as phosphate, nitrate and
calcium to create energy and grow, taking in carbon dioxide and
releasing oxygen]{.underline}. Phytoplankton perform about 50 percent of
all the photosynthesis on the planet. It is estimated that they have
produced about half of all the earth's oxygen.

Some examples of phytoplankton are cyanobacteria (also known as
blue-green algae); diatoms, which have cell walls of silica, and are the
most abundant and diverse group; and dinoflagellates, which have
appendages that help them move. All algae are phytoplankton, but not all
phytoplankton are algae.

Zooplankton include animals such as krill, copepods, small shrimp-like
crustaceans and jellyfish. They generally feed on phytoplankton and are
in turn eaten by fish and other larger organisms.

Why are plankton important?

[Plankton are the **foundation of the entire marine food chain**. The
**health** and **productivity of all marine life** ultimately depend on
them]{.underline}.

[Plankton]{.underline} also [play important roles in the **earth's
carbon cycle**. When phytoplankton die, some of the carbon they take
in]{.underline} through photosynthesis [sinks to the ocean depths, where
it is sequestered from the atmosphere. This process, called the
biological pump, **makes the ocean the earth's largest carbon
sink**]{.underline}.

Oceans have absorbed an estimated 40 percent of all the carbon dioxide
humans have put into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution.
Globally, the biological pump transfers 10 billion metric tons of carbon
from the atmosphere to the ocean depths each year.

Phytoplankton are useful to humans in other ways as well. [More
efficient than land plants at photosynthesis and carbon storage,
phytoplankton can be a renewable resource. Protein-rich
phytoplankton]{.underline} can [provide an alternative to fish
mea]{.underline}l used in aquaculture, [and supplements for meat- and
soy-based animal feeds]{.underline}. While growing soy and other crops
uses up land, fertilizer and other resources, [algae production requires
little space and is less harmful for the environment]{.underline}.

[Enzymes]{.underline} from plankton [are used in **pharma**ceutical
products and food products. Fats from plankton are put into cosmetics
and food supplements. They can also be used as fertilizers]{.underline}
in place of chemical-based products. [Organic compounds produced by
plankton]{.underline} have potential to be used to [treat Alzheimer's,
cancer, diabetes, AIDS, osteoporosis and other diseases]{.underline}.

There has been much interest in cultivating phytoplankton for biodiesel
fuel, but that promise has yet to be met.

They grow rapidly, have high fat content and produce up to 30 times more
energy than other biofuels. However, recent research found that
manufacturing and using biodiesel from phytoplankton actually consumes
more energy than the biofuel can produce, and may have a bigger carbon
footprint than fossil-fuel diesel. In order for a viable low-carbon fuel
to be made from microalgae, enhanced microalgae strains and improved
infrastructure design would be necessary.

First let's look at some of the smallest organisms in the ocean:
plankton. These tiny organisms float through the water, but they have a
tremendous effect on the ocean---and even on the atmosphere we all
breathe.

[Phytoplankton]{.underline} are microscopic plants that [form the
**basis of the oceanic food web**]{.underline}. Like plants on land,
[phytoplankton use photosynthesis to convert the sun's rays into energy.
Part of that]{.underline} process [is absorbing carbon dioxide and
producing oxygen]{.underline}, which we humans need to breathe.
[Phytoplankton live close to the water's surface so they can absorb
sunlight. By absorbing carbon dioxide, phytoplankton help **create a
carbon sink**]{.underline}---[when they die]{.underline}, the [carbon is
sequestered]{.underline} deep in the ocean---which is **[critical for
mitigating climate change]{.underline}**.

[Zooplankton]{.underline} are tiny animals, many of which [consume
phytoplankton and each other]{.underline}. As consumers,
[they]{.underline} help [keep the phytoplankton population under
control. Without enough zooplankton]{.underline} to eat phytoplankton,
[the ocean can experience **harmful algae blooms that hurt lots of
species**]{.underline}, including humans. Too many zooplankton would
mean a drastic reduction in phytoplankton absorbing our CO2 and
producing oxygen for us.

North Atlantic right whales are baleen [whales]{.underline} that [feed
on zooplankton]{.underline}. In fact, they can eat as much as 1,100
kilograms (2,400 pounds) of zooplankton in one day. By keeping the level
of zooplankton under control, they help maintain a healthy balance of
phytoplankton.

### Thumper\-\--Drilling

#### Thumped -- companies are working towards a [net-zero]{.underline} model for oil drilling.

Accessed 6-27-2025\] HS 宋

Last year, environmentalists criticized the Biden Administration for
approving a large oil drilling project on public land in the Alaskan
Arctic called the Willow project. [However, a similar petroleum project
has drawn little attention.]{.underline} About 30 miles east of Willow,
[Australian energy company Santos, Spanish company Repsol, and ASRC
Energy,]{.underline} a subsidiary of the Alaska Native-owned Arctic
Slope Regional Corporation (ASRC), [has received approvals and is
currently building the first phase of the Pikka Project, an effort to
produce hundreds of millions of barrels of oil over the next three
decades.]{.underline} The project is located entirely on land owned by
the State of Alaska and the ASRC. During his first term, President Trump
expanded federal lands in Alaska open for oil and gas drilling.
President Biden then cancelled some leases and moved to restrict some
areas in the Arctic open for energy exploration, although he also
approved the massive Willow drilling project. During his second
campaign, Trump promised to re-open even more Alaskan lands as part of
his "Drill, Baby, Drill" agenda. "The U.S. should unapologetically
pursue American interests in the Arctic," the Republican roadmap for
Trump's second term, Project 2025, says of drilling in Alaska. "...The
region is estimated to contain 90 million barrels of oil and one-quarter
of the world's undiscovered natural gas reserves." [The Pikka Project on
the North Slope of Alaska would be Santos' first project in the U.S. The
company is Australia's biggest producer of natural gas,]{.underline}
with other operations across Southeast Asia. [In October, the
Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility sued Santos for
greenwashing because of its plan to reach **net-zero** greenhouse gas
emissions by **2040**, which the organization described as "little more
than a **series of speculations**."]{.underline} In Alaska, Santos has
become the state's second-largest oil and gas leaseholder, with plans to
begin producing oil from the Pikka Project by 2026. It opened an office
in Anchorage and began hiring workers, saying in a presentation to
Alaska legislators in February that it would have 430 employees in the
state by the end of this year. ConocoPhillips' Willow Project drew
intense scrutiny from environmentalists and the media, with many seeing
it as a test of the Biden Administration's commitment to transitioning
away from fossil fuels and addressing climate change. Biden approved the
Willow project in March 2023. The Pikka Project, by contrast, has gotten
little attention outside of Alaska. [The project is slightly smaller
than Willow, which ConocoPhillips says would produce up to 600 million
barrels of oil over 30 years, with a peak of 180,000 barrels per
day.]{.underline} Santos says Pikka will produce about 400 million
barrels over 30 years, with a peak of 80,000 barrels per day. Santos
originally planned to produce oil on 77,744 acres but earlier this year
announced a 19,664-acre expansion, bringing the total to 97,408 acres,
about 152 square miles -- roughly the size of Denver. Phase I of the
project has been approved and is under construction, and major approvals
have been secured for the second phase of the project. [Nauri Simmonds,
executive director of Sovereign Iñupiat for a Living Arctic, has worked
in the oil and gas industry for a different ASRC-owned company. The
industry's impact is mixed on communities like Nuiqsut, a tribal village
located between the Willow and Pikka oilfields]{.underline}. A 2022
ConocoPhillips gas leak forced people in Nuiqsut to evacuate their
homes, with what Simmonds described as poor communication from
authorities making it difficult for people to know when to leave and
when it was safe to return. Oil development has disrupted caribou herds
that people rely on for meat. [At the same time, the industry has built
roads that make some areas more accessible, and many depend on oil
industry jobs and dividends they receive from Native corporations that
support drilling.]{.underline} "It creates a form of dependence,"
Simmonds said. "You need money for snow machines, you need money for
ammo, you need money for equipment." The rest of the U.S. is much less
dependent on Alaskan oil than in previous decades. Alaska's share of
U.S. oil production has declined from a high of 25 percent in 1988 to
less than 4 percent as of 2022. Over the past 40 years, Alaska's share
of overall production has declined compared to other oil-producing
regions, such as Texas, New Mexico, and North Dakota. In these states,
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unlocked oil from shale
formations previously considered too expensive to produce. Oil
production on Alaska's North Slope began with the industry\'s discovery
of reserves in Prudhoe Bay in 1968. Then followed the construction of
the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, an 800-mile pipeline network completed
in 1977. All of the oil produced on the North Slope has to flow through
the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, which delivers crude oil to refineries and
export terminals along the Prince William Sound in Valdez. Willow, which
is currently under construction, and Pikka are far from the biggest of
the roughly two dozen oil fields in the North Slope, the largest being
Prudhoe Bay, where commercial production began in 1977. [However, they
have the potential to continue producing for decades, even as the U.S.
and other countries have stated goals of reducing fossil fuel
consumption to combat climate change.]{.underline} "What's so radical
about it is they made a really big bet in a controversial place," said
Philip Wight, an environmental historian at the University of Alaska
Fairbanks. "Their bet was basically, 'We\'re going to need a lot more
oil, even though scientists are saying we need to have a
carbon-constrained world." Wight said the Trans-Alaska Pipeline's
purpose has shifted since the 1970s and 1980s when it was about
"delivering Alaskan oil for American energy security." Instead, Alaskan
officials want to see oil development continue to bring in more revenue
to the state. "It's not that the nation needs Alaska's gas or Alaska's
oil," Wight said. "It's that Alaska doesn't have a sustainable fiscal
model, and we need to produce the oil in order to keep the state
afloat." [Santos, the Australian company developing the Pikka Project,
claims it has a "goal of achieving net-zero" by 2040. The company says
it will offset the greenhouse gas emissions from all its oil and gas
production]{.underline}, including the Pikka Project, [by sequestering
carbon dioxide. The company is currently working on three carbon
sequestration hubs in Australia.]{.underline} In Alaska, Santos, Repsol,
and ASRC Energy make up a group called the Alaska CCS Consortium, with a
"long-term vision" of carbon capture and storage sites on the North
Slope and in Cook Inlet, near Anchorage. [The Department of Energy
awarded the consortium **\$3 million** from the Bipartisan
Infrastructure Law for a "pre-feasibility study" of locations in Alaska
that could be used for a direct **air capture facility** that would suck
carbon directly from the atmosphere and store it
underground.]{.underline} It\'s unclear whether any of these ideas will
become a reality. Carbon capture and sequestration technologies have yet
to be deployed in the U.S. on a large scale and they have not proven
themselves to be financially viable. There are currently no pending
applications in Alaska for wells to store carbon dioxide underground.
Climate change is already reshaping the Alaskan Arctic. Thawing
permafrost is softening the ground, causing shifting and cracks in
buildings and making it more difficult for oil companies to maintain
well pads, roads, pipelines and other equipment. Ironically, companies
such as ConocoPhillips must use refrigeration devices called
thermosyphons below pipelines and other infrastructure to keep the
permafrost frozen, even as they produce fossil fuels responsible for
thawing the permafrost. The region is also experiencing freezing rain in
winter instead of snow. This icy crust prevents wildlife such as caribou
from reaching food underneath the snowpack. The layer of ice also makes
it difficult for people to travel via snowmobile or dogsled, some of the
only ways to travel in an area with few roads. According to climate
scientists, the Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the rest
of the planet. This warming is causing sea ice to retreat and affecting
all kinds of wildlife -- seals, caribou, polar bears, and migratory
birds, said Cooper Freeman, Alaska director for the Center for
Biological Diversity. "Everything's changing," Freeman said. "The
solution can't be to drill more oil and pump more oil through the
pipeline. It's suicide."

#### The Alaska LNG project is [state-approved]{.underline} and received an [environment stamp of approval]{.underline} from both Trump and Biden.

must be done, but major progress has been made; Alaska Beacon;

As the Alaskan who leads the board of the Alaska Gasline Development
Corporation , I write to provide a frank update about the Alaska LNG
Project, which has been in the news a lot lately --- [AGDC signed a deal
with Glenfarne to take over the project, President Trump and our
congressional delegation vocally **support** Alaska LNG, and markets in
Asia have increased interest in buying Alaska's liquefied natural
gas.]{.underline}

Alaska LNG is a big, expensive and complex project. Many Alaskans don't
realize just how big. Alaska LNG's latest cost estimate, at the end of
2023, is for \$44 billion. In comparison, Alaska's annual state budget
is about \$13 billion.

Alaskans have been hearing about natural gas projects for decades
because Alaska's North Slope natural gas resource is simply too valuable
to ignore. Thankfully Alaskans have never given up on trying new ways to
solve the puzzle. [So what is different about Alaska LNG
now]{.underline}?

First, we [have our major permits in hand]{.underline}. These permits
represent more than a piece of paper. [Permitting Alaska LNG took
approximately five years and more than \$100 million of engineering and
**environmental design**.]{.underline} The State of Alaska largely bore
the costs of this permitting work. [Both President Trump and President
Biden gave Alaska LNG an **environmental stamp of
approval**.]{.underline} Because permitting is such an expensive process
with uncertain outcomes, completed permits substantially derisk Alaska
LNG. They include a definitive project development timeline. LNG buyers
take us more seriously because of our permits and they helped give
Glenfarne the confidence that Alaska LNG stands up to scrutiny.

Second, Alaskans face a major Cook Inlet energy shortfall. We may need
to rely on imports temporarily until the pipeline opens, but [Alaska LNG
is the ONLY option that meets three vital energy criteria: **quantity**,
**affordability**, and **reliability**.]{.underline} Renewables can
help, but honest experts will tell you that there is no practical
replacement for the energy foundation provided by natural gas and one
won't be available for decades. Locking into long-term imports means
doubling our energy bills for perpetuity and forgoing substantial
in-state economic growth.

Third, Alaska LNG has been determined to be economically viable. No
additional feasibility studies are required for private investment. Wood
Mackenzie found that Alaska LNG can deliver LNG to Asia at prices lower
than competing U.S. Gulf Coast projects. They determined that the
pipeline can be economically self-supporting, even when the added cost
of the lateral to Fairbanks and various North Slope gas supply options
are considered. Critics often question Alaska LNG's upfront costs,
higher than other projects due to the pipeline, but our ongoing running
costs are a lot lower than other projects because of our short shipping
distance to Asia, about 75% shorter than Gulf Coast projects. North
Slope gas will be cheaper than other sources because it is stranded with
no means to get it to market, and it avoids the rampant price volatility
characteristic of Lower 48 natural gas.

Fourth, Alaska LNG benefits from robust federal support. Our
congressional delegation authored legislation signed by President Biden
that makes Alaska LNG eligible for approximately \$30 billion in federal
loan guarantees. These loan guarantees greatly reduce borrowing costs,
back project debt with the full faith and credit of the United States,
lower project risk, and make Alaska LNG even more competitive in global
markets. President Trump has made Alaska LNG a centerpiece of his second
term through his executive orders and a focus of the new National Energy
Dominance Council to use the full force of the federal government,
including defense, trade, and commerce tools, to support Glenfarne's
work to propel Alaska LNG forward.

I promised you straight talk about Alaska LNG and here is the basic
truth: There is still a lot of work to be done, and it will not be easy.
Success is not guaranteed. But that also does not mean that we can
dismiss or discount the major progress that has been made. Alaska LNG is
built on the shoulders of previous efforts that fell short and benefits
from insights gained along the way. The state has made a substantial
investment in Alaska LNG --- hundreds of millions of dollars --- and we
have reached a point where Glenfarne, a qualified private developer,
will bear the costs and the risks going forward. Although policy makers
will have the option for Alaska to invest in the construction of Alaska
LNG, there is no further obligation to the state, which is now
positioned to realize the billions of dollars of energy security,
economic, employment and environmental benefits this project holds
without any further material investment.

And although AGDC has passed the baton of project development to
Glenfarne, the work of AGDC board members representing the state and
protecting Alaska stakeholders continues. This project holds the
potential to blaze a new path of prosperity for generations of Alaskans
and has brought us closer than any previous effort. We're not yet at the
finish line, but our work continues with energy and optimism. As your
neighbors and fellow Alaskans, we carry your interests in every decision
we make and promise to keep you updated about the important work ahead.

[The amount of oil flowing through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System was
higher in 2022 than in each of the two years prior]{.underline}, the
system's operator said on Tuesday.

[The system shipped over 176.4 million barrels of oil in the calendar
year, averaging 483,415 barrels per day]{.underline}, said Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co., the consortium that operates the 800-mile line and
its Valdez marine terminal.

It was the first time since 2017 that oil flowing through the pipeline
-- known as throughput -- increased from the previous calendar year,
Alyeska said in a statement. The 2022 totals were also higher than those
from 2020, the company said.

In 2021, nearly 174.4 million barrels were shipped through the system,
averaging 477,798 barrels per day, Alyeska said. In 2020, about 175.8
million barrels were shipped through the system, averaging 480,199
barrels per day, Alyeska said.

The [throughput increase is good news,]{.underline} Alyeska said in its
statement.

"The [best long-term solution for safe and sustainable TAPS operations
is more oil]{.underline}, so this increase is a notable milestone,"
Betsy Haines, Alyeska's interim president, said in the statement. "It's
[also a positive for Alaskans and our state's economy]{.underline}. We
are all encouraged by discoveries and development on the North Slope,
and supportive of an external environment that fosters responsible
resource development, creates future throughput increases for TAPS, and
strengthens our state and country."

The Trans Alaska Pipeline System began shipping oil in 1977. Average
daily throughput peaked in 1988 at over 2 million barrels per day. It
has been declining since then, though with some variability, as North
Slope fields age and become less productive.

North Slope oil production has been influenced since early 2020 by
several factors, some working in opposite directions.

In the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, ConocoPhillips Alaska
Inc., the top oil producer, drastically curtailed operations in Alaska
and elsewhere. That included the suspension of production at about 300
North Slope wells and demobilization of nearly 2,000 North Slope
workers. The reduced production was not permanently lost but deferred
until later, the company said.

But also during the period since 2020, under Hilcorp Energy Co.'s new
management, the long-term [decline of production at the Greater Prudhoe
Bay Unit was halted and, eventually, reversed]{.underline}. Hilcorp, a
privately owned company known for revitalizing mature fields, became
Prudhoe's operator in mid-2020 after acquiring BP's Alaska assets.
Production [at Prudhoe, the largest oil-field unit on the North Slope,
is now higher]{.underline} than it was just prior to the Hilcorp
takeover, according to the Alaska Department of Revenue. [Average daily
Prudhoe unit production was 295,427 barrels through December of 2019 but
in December of 2022 it averaged 322,261 barrels]{.underline}, according
to the department.

[Given the tight grip and financial hold of the fossil fuel industry on
US politics, federal support for fossil fuel expansion spans **both**
major]{.underline} political **[parties]{.underline}**. Upon taking
office in January 2025, the second [Trump]{.underline} administration
[directed federal agencies to **aggressively expand fossil fuel
production**, pursue de-regulation of the fossil fuel industry, and
rollback climate policy, while continuing to deny]{.underline} the
reality of [climate change and withdrawing]{.underline} the USA
[from]{.underline} the [Paris]{.underline} Agreement \[87--90\]. The
[Biden]{.underline} administration, in contrast, had embraced the
scientific reality of climate change as a crisis driven by fossil fuels,
re-entered the Paris Agreement, and pursued some regulation of the
fossil fuel industry \[91--93\]. However, its climate and energy policy
[focused on expanding renewables]{.underline}, most notably through the
Inflation Reduction Act, [while simultaneously approving]{.underline}
many massive [**new fossil fuel extraction** and **infrastructure
projects**]{.underline} as part of an "all-of-the-above" energy strategy
(e.g. [Willow oil development project in Alaska, Mountain
Valley]{.underline} pipeline [in Appalachia, LNG and oil export
terminals in Gulf Coast communities, record-high approvals of oil and
gas drilling permits on public lands]{.underline}) \[94, 95\]. Although
Democrats have periodically responded to enormous grassroots pressure in
opposition to specific fossil fuel projects (e.g. Keystone XL pipeline),
these have been exceptions. [The result at the federal level has been an
**unstable** and **inconsistent climate**]{.underline} and energy
[**policy**, with flip-flopping]{.underline} between administrations [on
climate rhetoric and policy signaling, and **persistent support for US
oil and gas expansion**]{.underline}. While counter-acting market forces
may limit the degree to which any political administration can continue
to expand fossil fuel production and infrastructure in the short term
\[96, 97\], [momentum in the USA for a clean energy transition is
challenged by the **extreme politicization of fossil
fuels**]{.underline}.

### No Link\-\--Fossil Fuels Good

#### Fossil fuel dependence is [good]{.underline} and [inevitable]{.underline}\-\--adaptation ensures the benefits outweigh, and other emitters make their impacts inevitable.

Like the Marxist dialectic, or the predictions of the Gospels, the green
movement has long seen its triumph as preordained. Yet sometimes the
inevitable turns out to be not so.

Over the past few years [green policies]{.underline} --- notably the
drive for "net zero" --- [have been **failing**]{.underline}. Both
[markets and politicians have seen the light]{.underline}. What Joe
Biden's treasury secretary Janet Yellen once called "the greatest
business opportunity of the twenty-first century" has revealed itself to
be something of a disaster.

The new American President is likely to be blamed for the implosion of
the green agenda, but its collapse long pre-dates his re-ascension. Well
before November the opportunity of the century was going bust --- not
least because the [policies were having **little apparent impact on the
actual climate**]{.underline}. On Wall Street,
[ESG]{.underline}-approved (environment, social and government) [stocks
have been tanking]{.underline}, according to leading studies, [shackling
firms with massive losses]{.underline}.

Climate activists still insist that Trump's departure from the green
mantra is hubristic, like an ostrich sticking its head in the ground as
the inevitable climate apocalypse comes closer. But many voters in
America as well as Europe have had second thoughts about spending
upwards of \$6 trillion annually for the next thirty years on green
largesse. It doesn't help that these spending pledges are so often
advocated by jet-setting billionaires.

Well-funded campaigners will continue to try to shield Europe's
environmental policies from Trump, but this is not a passion among
voters on either side of the Atlantic. [Most people don't want to
huddle]{.underline} in smaller dwelling units, [enjoy less mobility,
more costly home heating, no air-conditioning, and a more austere
diet]{.underline}. Already a growing [economic dislocation]{.underline}
--- such as the energy-driven decline of the German industrial machine
--- [is sparking **opposition to green policies** throughout the
West]{.underline}, first expressed by the gilets jaunes movement in
France in 2018, now spreading further across an increasingly distressed
Europe. Even some on the left are reconsidering their policy agenda. In
ultra with-it Berlin, a referendum on tighter emissions targets recently
failed to win over enough voters.

The decline of the greens is a clear sign of change. Once seen by
Foreign Affairs as "reshaping global politics," the greens have suffered
devastating defeats across Europe. [There are]{.underline} now [moves to
boost fossil fuels in eastern Europe and Japan]{.underline}.

[Britain]{.underline}, once a reliable implementer of extreme climate
policy, [is]{.underline} now [considering new oil and gas projects,
while the EU, concerned about]{.underline} lagging [productivity, may be
about to scrap its climate requirements]{.underline}.

[Support for current green policies]{.underline} --- including
now-abandoned mandates for electric vehicles --- [has traditionally been
**weaker in the US**]{.underline}, reinforced by poor sales and lost
profits by US carmakers. A recent Gallup poll shows that just 3 percent
of Americans consider climate change and the environment their main
concern. Even young people, the group most concerned with climate
change, rank it far below inflation, housing, gun violence, jobs and
corruption.

[Opposition to Biden's green climate policies]{.underline} also [played
a critical role in Trump's wins in Pennsylvania]{.underline}, a major
fracking state, as well as manufacturing-oriented [Wisconsin and
Michigan]{.underline}. Huge parts of the American economy ---
manufacturing, agriculture, logistics --- depend on reliable and
low-cost electricity.

Unsurprisingly, President [Trump was strongly backed by fossil-fuel
industry campaign contributions]{.underline} (green capitalists backed
Harris). His plans to reindustrialize the country, a key MAGA goal and
particularly critical for the Midwest, rely in large part on keeping US
energy supplies buoyant and affordable.

To be sure, most Americans, like Europeans, support the notion of
climate mitigation but they are not willing to pay a high price for it:
a large majority seems unwilling to pay even \$10 a month to "save" the
planet. In contrast, a recent poll suggested that urban elites --- high
earners with graduate degrees --- favor unpopular notions like rationing
gas and meat, ideas that are roundly despised by the rest of the
population.

Even [hipsters are **ditching the green agenda**]{.underline}. Bastions
such as Berkeley and Washington State voted overwhelmingly last fall
against measures to limit or increase tax on natural gas. Even
Californians seem to be losing their passion for renewable energy.
Throughout red America, communities have been rejecting wind and solar
projects, over seven hundred times since 2015.

[The crux of the green dilemma lies in part with the realities of
**physics** as well as **geopolitics**. Renewables suffer a **low power
density** which]{.underline}, as Siemens energy CEO Christian Bruch
recently suggested, [requires ten times as much material to
work]{.underline} effectively, regardless of whether the wind is blowing
or the sun is shining.

As the OECD noted in 2018, "[the full cost of]{.underline} energy,"
(i.e. the cost of integrating [renewables]{.underline} in full
nationalized grids) [is **higher than natural gas, coal and nuclear
power**]{.underline}. Expect [the green lobby]{.underline} to ramp up
its propaganda. Rather than sober discussion about a very complex topic,
they [will predict catastrophic results]{.underline}, including mass
starvation and a rapid growth in weather related fatalities, even though
decades of [predictions of impending, unalterable doom have proved
**more theatrical than accurate**]{.underline}. "[Climate
science]{.underline}," [notes]{.underline} 2022 [Nobel Prize laureate
for physics John F. Clauser]{.underline}, "[has metastasized into
massive **shock-journalistic pseudoscience**]{.underline}."

The outcries will get lots of attention. The [**climate propaganda**
drive enjoys an inside track with the media]{.underline}, including
outlets, such as Associated Press or National Public Radio, which take
money from climate advocates. Paid off or not, [the mainstream press
remains]{.underline} largely **[the climate lobby's useful
idiots]{.underline}**.

A New York Times piece last year suggested "mass climate migration" away
from places like Texas despite continued migration flows toward it. As
analyst Robert Bryce has demonstrated, in 2021 green nonprofits --- what
he scathingly calls "the anti-industry industry" --- received well over
four times as much in donations as those advocating for the use of
nuclear or fossil fuels.

Repeated [claims of impending, unalterable doom tend to undermine the
seriousness of the issue]{.underline}. Certainly **[warming has not
impacted food production]{.underline}**, as is frequently suggested.
Since 1960 [wheat production has quadrupled. Rising sea levels remain a
concern]{.underline}, but that [has been **happening since the last
glaciation** over a few hundred thousand years ago]{.underline}. It has
not accelerated substantially in recent decades. Even the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's own report concludes that a
signal of climate change has not yet emerged beyond natural variability.

Perhaps equally critical are geopolitical considerations. [The West will
**pay a price for its green fantasies**]{.underline} given that [its
greatest competitors, including China, use coal and gas to power their
economies. China]{.underline} now [emits more greenhouse gases than
Japan, the EU and North America **put together**. In the developing
world, fossil-fuel burning continues to grow in **Pakistan, India,
Bangladesh and Vietnam**]{.underline}. As former Nigerian vice-president
Yemi Osinbajo has noted, "**[No country in the world has been able to
industrialize using renewable energy]{.underline}**."

By far [the biggest beneficiary of the]{.underline} mandated [switch
to]{.underline} "[renewable]{.underline}" [energy is China. The
countries]{.underline} which are [critical for providing the necessary
resources are]{.underline} often [**dominated by Beijing**.
The]{.underline} Chinese [regime uses efficient, cheaper fossil fuels to
dominate the solar-panel industry, building]{.underline} its [battery
capacity]{.underline} to roughly four times ours, [while exercising
effective control of rare earth minerals and the **tech**nology for
processing them]{.underline}.

Unlike their Chinese counterparts, politicians in Washington, London or
Brussels have to listen to their own constituents. These people are
being forced to pay high energy prices, which are more expensive
everywhere that green policies have been most aggressively pursued:
Denmark, Germany and, in the US, California. In Britain last year, where
energy costs are some of the highest in Europe, more than ten million
households fell behind on their energy payments due to soaring bills.

[Immiseration has become **central to green ideology**]{.underline}.
According to Robert Jackson, a Stanford professor of earth system
science, [Americans should learn to like living on one-quarter of their
current energy]{.underline}, essentially [turning the clock back to
consumption patterns of the 1950s]{.underline}. This does not make an
appealing proposition to the public, as the likes of Bill Gates and even
the head of a powerful and prominent UK trade union have noted.

Political scientist Roger Pielke's "iron law of climate policy" suggests
that "substantially increasing the costs of energy, which supports every
aspect of modern life, is off the table as a policy option for achieving
deep decarbonization."

Fortunately, [there are]{.underline} other [less damaging ways to reduce
emissions, by **using natural gas**]{.underline} instead of coal [and
building emissions-free nuclear plants. Gradual shifts in cars with
greater efficiency]{.underline} --- such as hybrids --- [are more likely
to win marketplace acceptance than]{.underline} the current insistence
on [electrical vehicles]{.underline}. (EVs also have their own
considerable environmental drawbacks, due to the heavy use of
carbon-intensive materials.)

[Humans have struggled against **more dramatic climate challenges**
throughout history. Cold or drier weather has driven changes in crops.
Holland's harnessing of surging sea levels to create new
land]{.underline} behind dikes [is an example]{.underline} of
centuries-old adaptation. In 1900, [Galveston]{.underline}, Texas [was
devastated by a hurricane but is now protected by a sea
wall]{.underline}, which has kept the city safe through numerous major
storms.

[If the seventeenth-century Dutch or early twentieth-century Texans
could adjust]{.underline} to climate changes, [it seems reasonable that
with today's vastly more potent technologies, **so can
we**]{.underline}.

[Rather than wallow in hysteria, countries can focus on
investments]{.underline} --- dykes, seawalls, tree plantings ---
[that]{.underline} will [**mitigate and adapt** to future climate
changes]{.underline}. The rise of [remote work]{.underline}, the
International Energy Agency suggests, [offers great
opportunities]{.underline}. If everybody were able to work from home
just one day a week, it would save around one percent of global oil
consumption.

[The world faces many challenges]{.underline} in the future, but
[**climate is not the sole or even the most pressing one**. As we
fac]{.underline}e the threat of expanding [war]{.underline}, intensified
[class and ethnic conflict, growing inequality and health crises, it's
time to **look dispassionately at climate** as one of the many
challenges facing humanity]{.underline}.

The quasi-religious values of the greens have their place, but ought not
to trump the search for a better life among people in the West, China or
the developing world.

### No Link\-\--Mining

#### Sustainable Arctic mining is possible---when Indigenous communities co-own and co-manage, extraction can promote environmental protection, economic development, and reconciliation.

**Bidgood '24** (Anna K Bidgood, Earth and Planets Laboratory, Carnegie
Institution for Science, Jessica Hall, Centre for Sámi Studies, UiT The
Arctic University of Norway, Date Published: November 18 2024, Earth
Science, Systems and Society (Lyell Collection, "We Need to Talk About
Mining in the Arctic", Date accessed: June 30, 2025,
https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.3389/esss.2024.10117)

Looking to the future of mining in the Arctic: can this industry provide
an opportunity for sustainable development and reconciliation?
[Sustainable development has been defined as "**development which meets
the needs of the present** without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs]{.underline}" (Brundtland
Commission, 1987). Whilst sustainable mining may be an oxymoron,
[sustainability in mining leading to the development of sustainable
outcomes, **is a legitimate concept**]{.underline} that we should be
working towards. Sustainability within the mining industry can be
multifaceted, encompassing [projects which aim to not only **reduce**
the **environmental and social impacts** of mining through stewardship
of the natural environment]{.underline} but to also add value, creating
something sustainable in the long term. Sustainable goals must also
include the development of, and continued effort towards, building
long-term relationships with communities who are impacted by the mining
process. Ensuring that mining is sustainable is not just reliant upon
ethical extraction but also protecting the long value chain that occurs
after the mining has taken place. [This process creates **environmental,
social, and economic value** which can positively benefit the local
communities.]{.underline}

[For example, despite being built on environmental disaster, Faro mine
in Canada is now home to the Faro Mine Remediation Project, a government
and Indigenous-led program. This program provides employment and
training opportunities for Kaska and other Indigenous
citizens]{.underline} (FARO Mine Remediation Project, 2022) and is an
example of a long-term project which provides opportunities for locals
whilst at the same time rehabilitating the environment. [Incorporating
sustainability principles into the lifecycle of a mining operation and
beyond, has the potential to have a **positive impact on
communities**]{.underline} and, if incorporated into the early planning
stages, could contribute to the long-term sustainability of the local
area.

These questions are also particularly pertinent in Greenland, a country
with 92% Indigenous population, a great potential for mineral resources,
a large expanse of unexplored land and a limited history of resource
development (In 2020 there were 2 active mines in Greenland compared to
1001 in Canada). Despite the small number of mines in Greenland, some
areas (such as in South Greenland) have been mined for more than a
century and a significant proportion of the population of Greenland have
some experience of exploration and mining operations and are positive
towards mining (e.g., Agneman, 2018; Thaarup et al., 2020). As Greenland
continues to be explored, coastal regions are becoming more and more
prospective, and the number of exploration licences is slowly
increasing.

The government and people of Greenland are currently battling with
questions of environmental, economic, and political opportunities. For
example, the controversial Kvanefjeld rare earth deposit is one of the
most significant rare earth deposits globally and presents an
opportunity for Greenland to become an internationally significant
supplier of raw materials and perhaps establish economic independence
from Denmark. Many local residents support the project as it offers
greater employment whereas other have raised concerns about disruptions
to the environment and the lack of adequate information, particularly
surrounding the potential radioactive pollution, and failure to consult
and seek local community's free, prior and informed consent (FPIC)
(Orellana et al., 2021). It should be noted, however, that the main
concerns around the Kvanefjeld deposit are related to the presence of
uranium in the ore. This is not reflective of the "typical" concerns to
other exploration and mining operations elsewhere in Greenland, many of
which are seen largely positively. A recent report on sand mining in
Greenland surveyed almost 1,000 Greenlanders (\>1.5% of the population)
and found that large majorities support extraction but oppose foreign
involvement (Bendixen et al., 2022).

**Examples of Indigenous Collaboration and Ownership**

[A direct result of oil and gas extraction throughout the Arctic has
seen the **increase in co-management structures** between Indigenous
communities and developers]{.underline}. The [legacy of oil and gas
extraction in Canada has led to a historical relationship of distrust
between Indigenous communities and extractive industries. The oil and
gas industry in Canada had a **significant impact on Indigenous
communities**]{.underline} through the ever-increasing wave of Europeans
arriving to be a part of the extractive industries' growth (Alberta's
Energy Heritage). The 1850s in Canada saw a dramatic increase in the
production of oil, with the Mining and manufacturing Company of 1854
being the first dedicated oil company in North America (Alberta's Energy
Heritage). Furthermore, projects developing access and acquisition of
gas, such as Coastal GasLink in British Columbia, have been accused of
violating FPIC principles, thus continuing the challenges navigating
these forms of extractivism and the Indigenous right to
self-determination (StandEarth, 2022).

Whilst mining and Indigenous relations are typically portrayed in a
negative light, t[here are examples, particularly in the Canadian
Arctic, which can inform future exploration and mining.]{.underline} Red
Dog mine in Alaska is a major world producer of Zn and Pb and is
co-owned by Teck Alaska and the NAANA Indigenous corporation, providing
an example where typical approaches to western business deals were
challenged, resulting in a potential new approach to business in the
Arctic. Raglan mine in northern Quebec is another example of a major
world producer of Ni and the location of Canada's first Impact Benefit
Agreement with Indigenous communities, promoting political, social, and
economic development of the region. Indigenous knowledge, in
collaboration with two neighbouring Inuit communities, was incorporated
into the environmental impact assessments prior to the Raglan mine
operation, resulting in a shortened shipping season to aid conservation
relating to Arctic char and seal populations (Natural Resources Canada,
2007).

[**Indigenous collaboration and ownership** is increasingly **common**
in Arctic development. For example, First Nations, Métis, and Inuit
entities were partners or beneficiaries in nearly 20% of Canada's
existing electricity-generating infrastructure in 2022]{.underline}
(Gall et al., 2022), most of which produces renewable energy, reducing
reliance on diesel generators in these remote regions. The Nechalacho
rare earth project, located on the traditional lands of several Metis
and Dene First Nations groups in the Northwest Territories, involves a
51% joint venture ownership by the Yellowknives Dene First Nations, who
will control mining operations at the site. This project provides
significant potential for Indigenous and northern employment and
economic benefit and is the first example of a First Nations business
entity contracting for a mine operation on traditional lands in Canada.

### No Link\-\--Pipelines

[An inaugural environmental, social and governance report issued by the
**operator** of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System summarizes what the
company said was overall **positive work** "as caretaker, steward, and
operator" of the **800-mile oil line** and its Valdez marine
terminal.]{.underline} The 19-page report, released last week by Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co., covers a wide variety of metrics from 2022, the
system's 45th year of operation. [Subjects covered include greenhouse
gas **emissions** from operating the system, which are **trending
down**]{.underline}; notable repair and maintenance projects; freshwater
use; Alaska Native hire and employee diversity; and worker injuries,
which increased somewhat in 2021 and 2022 after falling substantially
over the past two decades. The report is planned as the first in a
series of annual ESG reports, said Michelle Egan, Alyeska's chief
communications officer. Alyeska has been issuing external and internal
reports for years on specific aspects of its operations, and this ESG
report is intended to combine that information, Egan said. "Our view was
we should pull this all into one publicly available report and we should
follow a framework that people are familiar with," she said. Alyeska is
owned by three companies with major shares of North Slope oil fields.
Hilcorp's Harvest Alaska unit owns 49.1%, the share that the company
acquired from BP Plc. ConocoPhillips has a 29.6% share and ExxonMobil
has a 21.3% share. A requirement for recruiting and hiring a significant
number of Alaska Natives has been in effect over Alyeska's entire
lifetime. Under an Alaska Native Utilization Agreement first signed in
1996 and renewed since then, the targets became more specific, listing
20% Native hire for Alyeska and its contractors and other goals, Egan
said. [That 20% target has been met for more than a decade, she said. In
2022, Alyeska's workforce was **27.2% Alaska Native** and its contractor
workforce was 20.5% Alaska Native, according to the report.]{.underline}
A section of excavated pipe is seen in 2022 at a high ridge above
Keystone Canyon north of Valdez. Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., operator
of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, dug 42 feet into the steep area to
examine that section of the 800-mile line. Workers found and removed a
large boulder that had been pressing against the line. (Photo provided

2022 at a high ridge above Keystone Canyon north of Valdez. Alyeska
Pipeline Service Co., operator of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, dug
42 feet into the steep area to examine that section of the 800-mile
line. Workers found and removed a large boulder that had been pressing
against the line. (Photo provided by Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.) Major
environmental events in 2022 included a response to "unprecedented
challenges" from heavy spring snow that, combined with freeze-thaw
cycles and glaciation, damaged equipment at the Valdez terminal's
storage tanks, the report said. The damage allowed hydrocarbon fumes to
vent from the storage tanks, contrary to Clean Air Act requirements,
regulators said at the time. [Other environmental work over the year
included **12** integrity inspections and digs, one of them on a steep
ridge at Keystone Canyon about 80 miles north of the Valdez terminal,
the report said. The report cites **positive results** from employee
surveys, which showed that **83%** believe Alyeska operates safely and
89% believe sufficient environmental safeguards are in
place.]{.underline} Those statistics contrast with findings in a report
issued in April by a watchdog group that identified safety problems at
the Valdez marine terminal. That report, from the Prince William Sound
Regional Citizens' Advisory Council, relies in part on information
provided by employees and other people referred to as "concerned
individuals." It cites worker concerns about maintenance backlogs, aged
and outdated equipment, cost-cutting and other issues. "A significant
percentage of the workforce believes that a serious incident is
imminent, according to Alyeska survey data. It appears that the key
element of Safety Culture -- a commitment to safety as the overriding
priority -- has been replaced with a business focus on budget, which has
strained resources and compliance," the RCAC report said. Risks are
exacerbated by staff reductions at the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation and other agencies that regulate the
terminal, the RCAC report said. Egan said Alyeska has confidence in its
safety performance and an "open work environment" in which employees are
encouraged to share concerns. [The company has been reviewing the RCAC
findings, she said. "We **welcomed** the report and their
input]{.underline}," she said. The Alyeska ESG report also summarizes
the company's contributions to nonprofits around the state. It notes a
special connection to the Nordic Skiing Association of Anchorage and to
the sport in general. Betsy Haines, an Alyeska veteran who served as the
company's interim president in 2022 and early 2023, was a U.S. Ski Team
member and Olympic athlete, and her niece is Kikkan Randall, a U.S. Ski
Team standout who won numerous World Cup titles and an Olympic gold
medal. Randall is now executive director of the Nordic Skiing
Association of Anchorage.

#### New federal leak detection rule slashes methane emissions---advances safety, tech innovation, and climate resilience while saving \$1.5B annually.

**PHMSA '25** (PHMSA,
https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/news/usdot-advances-rule-modernize-gas-pipeline-methane-emissions-detection-requirements-0,
Date Published: February 25, USDOT Advances Rule to Modernize Gas
Pipeline Methane Emissions Detection Requirements, Date Accessed:
7/25/2025)//GOATKUNA

WASHINGTON -- Today, the [U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline
and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) transmitted a
final rule to the Federal Register to enhance the safety of natural gas
pipelines through updated leak detection and repair
requirements]{.underline}. [The rule is expected to deliver up to
**\$1.5 billion in annual net benefits** to the public and **eliminate
up to 500,000 metric tons** of methane emissions from approximately 2.8
million miles of gas transmission,]{.underline} distribution, and
gathering pipeline facilities, 398 underground natural gas storage
facilities (UNGSF), and 173 liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities
across the United States.

"[This new rule was developed by building a consensus with the pipeline
industry,]{.underline} public interest representatives, and
representatives from labor unions that are actually on the ground doing
the work to maintain the world's largest gas pipeline system," said
**PHMSA Deputy Administrator Tristan Brown**. "[It will **harness the
tremendous new potential** we are seeing from mobile leak detection
systems, unmanned aerial systems, and other innovative technologies to
mitigate this threat]{.underline} to people and the
environment---keeping valuable natural gas in pipelines so they arrive
safely for use in homes and businesses, and ensuring America is the
global leader in safely transporting methane."

The rule issued by PHMSA updates decades-old leak detection rules to
require pipeline operators to establish advanced leak detection programs
aimed at detecting and repairing all gas leaks by:

- Increasing the frequency of required surveys and requiring use of
  commercially available advanced leak detection technology---such as
  aerial or vehicle surveys, handheld detection devices, and continuous
  monitoring systems.

- [Reducing volume of gas released due to unintentional emissions such
  as leaks and equipment failures and revising the reporting minimum
  threshold to detect smaller leaks sooner.]{.underline}

- Minimizing releases caused by equipment venting or blowdowns,
  associated with pipeline maintenance, repair, and construction and
  encouraging operators to consider cost-effective equipment that can
  capture methane and other gases for later use.

- Establishing clear criteria and timeframes for timely repair of all
  leaks that pose a risk to public safety or the environment.

[The new rule is in response to **Section 113 of the [PIPES Act of
2020](https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/legislative-mandates/pipes-act-2020-overview)** (signed
into law by then-President Trump), which mandates the issuance of new
rules to require gas pipeline operators to develop advanced leak
detection programs capable of identifying, locating, and categorizing
natural gas leaks from pipeline infrastructure for timely
repair]{.underline}. The PIPES Act also requires this rulemaking to
include minimum performance standards and repair deadlines and make use
of advanced technologies. **The new requirements are based on 28
consensus recommendations from representatives of the pipeline sector,
developed over the course of months of discussions and weeks of *Gas
Pipeline Advisory Committee (GPAC) meetings in November of 2023 and
March of 2024*.**

The Leak Detection and Repair rule plays a critical role in the *U.S.
Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan*, leveraging all available tools
to reduce methane emissions while protecting public health, promoting
U.S. innovation in new technologies, lowering energy costs for families
by reducing inefficiency and waste, and supporting good-paying jobs for
thousands of skilled workers across the country. [This rule also builds
on other **national and international actions** advanced in recent years
to mitigate methane emissions---a greenhouse gas with 80 times the
global warming potential of carbon dioxide.]{.underline}

#### Insulation is key to Arctic pipeline viability---thermal barriers reduce permafrost thaw and frost heave but face long-term durability and construction challenges.

Where necessary, insulation material may be installed to reduce
permafrost degradation. [The insulation around the pipe is **commonly
applied to a hot oil pipeline** to mitigate the thaw settlement of
founda- tion soils]{.underline}, although this method has the potential
of corrosion occurring under the insulation, and deterioration of the
coating limi ts its appli- cation. Xu et al. \[71\] conducted a
large-scale model test with a geometric scale of 1:8 to investigate the
effect of an insulation layer on the crude oil pipeline. Two parallel
steel pipes with a length of 7.8 m and a diameter of 108 mm were placed
in an insulated tank and one pipe was enclosed in a 30 mm thick PVC
insulating material. [During the testing procedure, **the oil
temperature was increased step by step** from 15 ◦C to 0 ◦C, 10 ◦C, 20
◦C, 25 ◦C. Monitoring shows that the size of the thawing zone around the
insulated pipe is much smaller than for the bare pipe. The conclusion
can be drawn that **with an insulation layer around a pipe, the
development of the thawing zones could be effectively reduced**. Abdalla
et al. \[1\] assessed the pipe insulation mitigation method in frost
heave growth of a chilled pipeline with a constant operating temperature
of 25 ◦C.]{.underline} A numerical model of frost heave was established
based on the porosity rate function. A total of 4 insulation materials,
polypropylene, low-density polymer, polyurethane foam, and propane gas
with thermal conductivity of 0.1, 0.05, 0.02 and 0.01 W⋅m 1⋅K 1, and a
same thick- ness of 30 mm were analyzed. The 5-year pipe-soil
interaction modeling results show that compared with base case pipe
heave can drop to 13%, 42%, and 46% with insulation material thermal
conductivity of 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01 W⋅m 1⋅K 1, respectively. For the
polypropylene case, because of high conductivity, frost heave growth
pushed the pipe upward.

[**Geothermal modeling** could be used to determine the **necessary
thickness of pipeline insulation** needed to control the development of
a thawing bulb or a frost bulb around the pipeline \[62\]]{.underline}.
The thicknesses of the insulation layer in the Alyeska Pipeline System
and the China-Russia Crude Oil Pipelines (CRCOPs) are 80 mm and 95 mm,
respectively \[67,64,63[\]. The idea of the insulation is to 1) prevent
or reduce heat transfer from a pipeline into the surrounding unfrozen
soils and 2) minimize the thawing or freezing of the surrounding
unfrozen soils to mitigate damage. The difference between oil pipe and
gas pipe is that oil pipe moves downwards in the thawing process and gas
pipe moves up- wards in the heaving process.]{.underline} The frost bulb
generated by a chilled pipe pushes the pipe upward, the adjacent pipes
anchored in the frozen ground hold the pipe down, causing bending or
even deformation in the insulation. [Due to the long-term absence of
heaving, **the effectiveness and durability of thermal insulation are
crucial**.]{.underline} The normal type of pipe insulation and
protection layer might be very vulnerable to the frost heave and
extremely low air temperature environment and would be crushed possibly.
The experience with the use of pipe insulation in the N. Urengoy-Surgut
pipeline indicates that the thermal insulation failed after 3--5 years
of operation under heaving conditions when freezing occurred in a closed
space \[30\].

#### Advanced insulation and heating innovations make chilled gas pipelines safe and sustainable in Arctic regions---mitigating frost heave and preserving permafrost.

[To prevent the thawing of ice-rich permafrost, it is suggested that gas
should be **transported in a chilled state** (below the freezing
temperature) in [pipelines
buried](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/buried-pipelines)
in permafrost.]{.underline} However, frost heave occurs when water
migrates towards the chilled pipeline and ice lenses grow underneath the
pipe. This might endanger the integrity of the pipeline and the
environment as well. Therefore, [innovative **frost heave [mitigation
measures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/mitigation-measure)**
are required when designing the pipeline, especially those sections in
discontinuous permafrost or near the [compressor
stations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/compressor-station).]{.underline}
The ground temperature field in response to the operation of a proposed
chilled [gas
pipeline](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/gas-pipeline)
traversing permafrost regions in Alaska was simulated by a pipe-soil
thermal interaction geothermal model. [Frost heave mitigation measures,
including insulation around the pipe, flat slab insulation under the
pipe, and heating cables combined with slab insulation, were evaluated
for chilled pipeline operation in seasonally varying ambient
temperatures. The numerical results show that the minimum temperature of
the observation point at 2.5 m below the pipe bottom increases by 17%,
29%, and 48% when the [thermal
conductivity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/thermal-conductivity)
of the outer [insulation
layer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/insulation-layer)
is 0.1, 0.05, and 0.02 W/(m·K), respectively.]{.underline} For flat slab
insulation, the thermal field is less sensitive to varying slab
thicknesses than to varying thermal conductivity, implying the thermal
conductivity, not the thickness, is the crucial factor. Additionally[,
**the heat flow could be redirected** from vertical to horizontal by
flat slab insulation. The electrical **heating cables could be regarded
as a new [heat
source](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/actuator)**
to balance the heat removal rate of the soil around the chilled
pipe.]{.underline} The minimum temperature of the observation point at
1.1 m below the bottom of the pipe increases from −15.2 °C to −3.0, 1.5,
and 7.5 °C, corresponding to the heating cable power of 20, 30, and 40
W, respectively, with the power of 30 W deemed appropriate for the study
case. It is concluded that [heating cables in combination with
insulation slabs could be adopted to **regulate the temperature field**
around the chilled pipeline efficiently and economically. The advantages
of this combination include redirecting the heat flow and eliminating
frost in the soil underlying the pipe]{.underline}. These approaches
could be considered for applications in gas pipeline projects in arctic
and alpine/high-plateau permafrost regions.

accessed 6/30/2025) //daxw

\*The most recently used evidence in the article is from 2018 so the
date written has to be 2018 or later

This month sees yet more evidence of [oil and gas companies stepping up
their sustainability commitments]{.underline} as they adapt to the newly
emerging realities of the global energy landscape. [With governments
across the Middle East and wider world setting targets for lower carbon
emissions and greater presence of renewables]{.underline} in their
national energy mix, [the oil and gas industry is looking towards
cleantech innovations]{.underline} to find the best ways to successfully
pivot towards this future energy vision.

Increasingly, we are seeing a lot more oil and gas companies trialling
and enjoying success with a widening range of [technologies and
solutions that are helping them become more sustainable]{.underline},
minimise costs and [ultimately cut their carbon footprint]{.underline}.
With so many of the Middle East's [OPEC]{.underline} countries pushing
the pace of their economic diversification strategies, this [is
prompting even greater and faster adoption of sustainability measures
across the industry]{.underline}, so we can expect to see a lot more
instances of companies exploring the following:

8 WAYS THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IS MAKING BETTER USE OF SUSTAINABLE
TECHNOLOGIES

1\. Better use of data

At the end of last year, McKinsey placed the O&G industry's performance
gap at \$200 billion. Their research states that on average, offshore
platforms run at only 77% of maximum production potential. [Correctly
implemented data analytics systems and tools can overcome the
operational complexity]{.underline} of O&G operations, [quickly yielding
returns of as much as 30-50 times the original investment and reducing
ecological impact by reducing wastage, accidents and
bottlenecks.]{.underline}

2\. Decreasing freshwater usage

Water is an essential element in various oil production processes, from
fracking to separating oil from other elements present in oil sands.
[Hundreds of millions of barrels of water are utilised every single
day]{.underline}, and [while the global O&G industry currently manages
to recycle the vast majority of this water (between
80-95%)]{.underline}, companies are rethinking the extraction process to
reduce freshwater from the very outset.

3\. Improving water recycling efforts

In order to decrease freshwater usage, O&G companies are exploring more
effective ways of recycling and reusing water for their operations.
Increasingly, [companies are aiming to use 100% non-potable water by
improving filtration oxidisation methods]{.underline}, as well as
advanced chemical-free water treatment solutions to neutralise bacterial
contaminants such as sulphate-reducing and iron-oxidizing bacteria.

4\. Reducing methane leaks

[Finding ways to reduce methane leaks is a cost-effective opportunity
for the industry.]{.underline} Recent figures from the International
Energy Agency have outlined that it is financially possible to reduce
oil and gas methane emissions\[1\] utilising currently available and
emerging technologies.

5\. Used oil recycling

M[ore companies are utilising small-scale waste-oil micro-refinery units
that transform used oil into diesel fuel]{.underline}. Not only does
this approach yield fuel for ongoing operations, it's also a relatively
inexpensive alternative to more traditional oil disposal methods.

6\. Streamlining/improving processes

Even innovations that don't specifically make oil and gas processing
greener and cleaner can still help improve the industry's overall
sustainability by allowing for more cost-efficient processes. For
example, new [ultrasound technology allows companies to create 3D images
of the inside of oil wells]{.underline}, enabling them to make more
informed and cost-effective production decisions. Similarly, IIOT,
analytics, automation, reserve replacement and enhancement capabilities,
and [emerging artificial intelligence programmes can all help find and
eliminate operational inefficiencies.]{.underline}

[By improving the efficiency of ongoing operational processes by even a
small fraction, O&G companies can produce the same amount but with
reduced costs and energy expenditure, leading to a lower overall carbon
footprint.]{.underline}

## Impact

### Thumper\-\--Arctic Biodiversity

#### Arctic biodiversity will crash with worsening climate change 

**Shahbazi 24** \[Alex Shahbazi; Senior Manager, Arctic Programs at
Ocean Conservancy ; 7-15-25; Turning the Tide for Imperiled Arctic
Biodiversity; Wilson Center ;
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/no-33-turning-tide-imperiled-arctic-biodiversity;
7-3-2025; JC\]

The Arctic brims with biodiversity: the variety of living things. [Over
21,000 species are Arctic inhabitants, including over 100 species of
mammals, nearly 400 species of fish, almost 10,000 invertebrate species,
and more than 2,000 species of plants. Many of these species are
endemic, meaning they occur nowhere else on Earth, with narwhals, musk
ox, and polar bears some of the most famous. Many others are only
part-time resident]{.underline}s. Those part-timers still depend on the
seas, coasts, rivers, and lakes of the north. Birds seen in your own
backyard might frequent Arctic ecosystems when they aren't stopping at
feeders further south; over 100 migratory bird species over-summer in
the High North. Marine species like whales make vast journeys, too,
traversing to and from the Arctic along oceanic highways hundreds to
thousands of miles long.

[Yet biodiversity in the Far North is increasingly imperiled. As carbon
emissions rise and far-northern human activities expand, the fabric of
Arctic ecosystems and the communities that rely on them continue to
unravel.]{.underline}

The Arctic is warming many times faster than the global average as
anthropogenic carbon emissions intensify climate change and ravage the
Arctic environment. [Diminishing sea ice eliminates habitat for seals
and feeding opportunities for polar bears. Increasing rain-on-snow
events---when rain freezes as a crust on top of existing
snowpack---severely inhibit ungulates like reindeer, caribou, and muskox
from finding food. Warming water temperatures harm salmon in rivers like
the Yukon and Kuskokwim. Thawing permafrost impacts wildlife habitats
while intensifying wildfires wreck forests and tundra.]{.underline}

As political and economic interest in the Arctic increases, rapidly
expanding human activities in the Far North introduce their own perils.
[Resource extraction and other commercial development may harm
ecosystems. In the fisheries world, bycatch is weakening salmon
populations. Arctic shipping threatens species of all kinds through
pollution, underwater noise, vessel strikes, and oil
spills.]{.underline}

It's a multi-pronged problem with numerous consequences.

Arctic biodiversity supports economic engines of local, regional, and
global importance. Local economies, and especially Indigenous
communities, rely heavily on the harvests of fish, marine mammals,
berries, birds, and more. Fisheries in Arctic and near-Arctic waters
support thousands of jobs and fill grocery stores around the world.
Tourism is also growing in the Arctic, with far northern wildlife and
landscapes a key draw.

[Crucially, declining Arctic biodiversity threatens the cultures,
livelihoods, and ways of life of Arctic residents, particularly
Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous Peoples of the High North have been
intrinsically tied to Arctic biodiversity for at least several thousand
years, connections which still thrive today. As Arctic biodiversity
dwindles and changes, however, these connections are
endangered]{.underline}. Arctic Indigenous People are not driving these
changes despite being those whose way of life are most at risk.

#### Biodiversity will continue to decrease in the arctic

\"But where the shrubs take over, [biodiversity will decrease, and then
the question is where the outcompeted species will go. There are no
colder regions than the Arctic, and some species may disappear
completely from large areas]{.underline},\" says Bjorkman.

The unique vegetation of the Arctic tundra is important for carbon
sequestration and how much sun is reflected from the ground surface[.
Larger shrubs absorb more of the sun\'s rays than today\'s vegetation,
which amplifies the warming of the Arctic.]{.underline}

[\"Changes in vegetation obviously also affect herbivorous
animals.]{.underline} Reindeer husbandry cannot have the same grazing
areas in the valleys as today, perhaps they can find new ones on the
bare mountains. [Then tourism will be affected when mountain birches and
shrubs take over on the mountains and the alpine meadows with beautiful
wildflowers disappear. And it will be difficult to get hold of drinkable
water when the glaciers and the late snowfields melt
away,]{.underline}\" says Robert Bjork.

The researchers cannot give a clear picture of exactly how the Swedish
mountain world will look in 50 to 100 years. [Much research remains to
be done to find out, but it is certain that the area of open mountain
meadow will decrease]{.underline}. At the Latnjajaure research station
near Abisko, led by the University of Gothenburg, the changes are
clearly visible.

[\"We are in the midst of climate change and will reach certain
thresholds where the flora will change radically, but we don\'t know
when it will happen. Or how it will happen]{.underline},\" says
Bjorkman.

### Thumper\-\--Whales

#### Hasty morticians and overfishing thump.

Ben **Goldfarb 22**, Award-Winning Environmental Journalist, "Humans Are
Overzealous Whale Morticians," Nautilus, 08-10-2022, accessed
07-02-2025,
https://nautil.us/humans-are-overzealous-whale-morticians-238529, DG

Those [whales who drift ashore]{.underline}---buoyed by internal gasses,
conveyed by currents---[support **complex ecosystems**]{.underline} of
their own. [Vultures and seabirds peck at eyes and blowhole; sharks
strip blubber]{.underline} in the surf. In Namibia's coastal deserts,
[jackals and hyenas gnaw at dead seal pups, dolphins, and
whales]{.underline}.4 When, in 2020, a minke whale---nicknamed Godfried,
for a beloved local author---washed ashore on a Dutch islet, he was
visited by 57 species of beetle, 21 of whom had never been seen on the
island before. In Russia, scientists have documented 180 polar bears
feasting on a single bowhead.5

Once, [coastal necrophages could count on a steady supply of whale
carcasses]{.underline}. (California's famously huge grizzlies, now
extinct, may have attained their gargantuan size by feeding upon the
same marine mammals who supported condors.6) [Today]{.underline},
however, [washed-up cetaceans are **comparatively rare**]{.underline}.
In part, that's [because industrial whaling]{.underline}---"the largest
removal of biomass in world history," per one researcher---[ravaged the
leviathans. Blue whale populations have plummeted]{.underline} by up to
90 percent, and [sperm whales endure at just one-third of their historic
numbers]{.underline}. Scavengers can't eat nonexistent animals.

But the dearth of whales isn't entirely responsible for the dearth of
whale carcasses. We [humans]{.underline} also [tend to be **overzealous
morticians**]{.underline}. Rather than letting stranded animals fulfill
their ancient roles, [we hastily dispose of their remains, depriving
coastal ecosystems of nature's greatest windfall]{.underline}. As one
group of scientists put it in a recent review of cetacean carcass
management, [whaling and whale-removal have together]{.underline} "[led
to **radical changes** in the abundance and availability of large marine
biomass inputs]{.underline}."7 In other words: **[Our shorelines miss
their whales and dolphins]{.underline}**.

Lately, some researchers have begun to pay closer heed to the value of
stranded whales, and to encourage coastal managers to let carcasses lie.
Granted, not every beach is an appropriate resting place for a reeking,
50,000-pound corpse. When circumstances allow, however, permitting dead
whales to decompose in situ may be preferable to disposal. "Can we do
better than the way we manage carcasses nowadays?" says Martina
Quaggiotto, an ecologist at the University of Stirling and the review's
lead author. "We are removing what is natural from a natural place."

In 1979, a pod of 41 sperm whales stranded on an Oregon
beach---"hemorrhaging under the crushing weight of their own flesh,"
wrote Barry Lopez, who attended the spectacle. The whales, it was clear,
couldn't be saved, and the numinous visitation became a profane exercise
in bureaucratic wrangling. What law-enforcement agency should manage
crowd-control, which scientists should be in charge of obtaining tissue
samples, and how would the state dispose of the corpses? "If buried, the
carcasses would become hard envelopes of rotting flesh, the internal
organs would liquefy and leach out onto the beach, and winter storms
would uncover the whole mess," Lopez cautioned. (Officials ultimately
decided to burn the whales, then bury the charred remnants.) A dead
cetacean on a public beach was no longer an ecological cog, but a
logistical nightmare.

More than 40 years later, our management of dead whales is no more
coherent. As Quaggiotto and her colleagues note, [every country, state,
and municipality obeys slightly different protocols. Some whales are
carted off to the landfill, incinerator, or rendering plant, where their
oily fats may be extracted]{.underline} for soaps, pet foods, and
biofuel. [Some are towed to sea, weighed down with scrap metal, and
sunk. Some are buried. Some are cleaned for museum display]{.underline}.
In 1970, the Oregon Highway Department infamously dynamited a gray
whale, flattening an Oldsmobile beneath a chunk of flying blubber and
leaving 75 bystanders flecked with putrescent meat. Detonation, needless
to say, is no longer anyone's preferred alternative.

In some cases removal is a matter of public safety, given that a dead
whale is the world's most alluring shark bait; even a buried cetacean
may leach shark-beckoning plumes of carbon and ammonium into the ocean.8
Often, whales who strand alive are put out of their misery with
pentobarbital, a drug that renders their bodies toxic long after death.
In one horrifying incident, a 2-year-old Australian shepherd fell into a
coma after she excavated blubber from a humpback who'd been euthanized
three weeks earlier.9 (Today many veterinarians prefer potassium
chloride, which doesn't leave behind dangerous residues.)

Mostly, [whales are removed for a prosaic reason: They
stink]{.underline}. The aroma of dead cetaceans has been described as
"the worst garbage smell you can think of," "death in a dumpster," and
"like a dead animal but multiply that by 10 and then add fish smell to
that and then feces." The journalist Sarah Gilman took a more literary
tack: "a throatier version of seashore rot that tastes like backwash
from a mildew-darkened garbage disposal."

As a result, [**authorities seldom let carcasses lie**. Some
countries]{.underline}, like Belgium and France, actually [require
officials]{.underline} to [usher dead cetaceans off to a
waste-management facility]{.underline}. In the United States, Quaggiotto
found that just 28 percent of cetacean carcasses remain in situ---nearly
all of these, surely, on remote beaches in wildlife refuges, national
parks, and Alaska. In heavily developed Florida, Megan Stolen, a
stranding investigator and scientist with the Blue World Research
Institute, estimates that less than 5 percent of dead whales and
dolphins get to stay put. The removal of a bottlenose dolphin can be a
tourist attraction as enticing as Epcot Center. "Daytona Beach during
spring break on a Friday afternoon, that's fun," Stolen says wryly.

[Our tendency to remove carcasses]{.underline}, however understandable,
[is **problematic**]{.underline} on a few levels. In Australia,
disposing of a single small whale costs around \$20,000 AUD (nearly
\$14,000),10 and some large humpbacks have run more than \$115,000
[It's]{.underline} also [tremendously labor-intensive]{.underline}.
Stolen's team once elected to chop up and bury a humpback on Melbourne
Beach. Because heavy machinery would have destroyed sea turtle nests,
they dug the immense grave by hand. "It was about eight hours of digging
with a five-man crew," Stolen recalls.

[The refusal to let bodies be bodies has ecological
implications]{.underline}, too. [Deprived of coastal carrion, California
condors have turned to the gut piles left behind by
hunters]{.underline}, which are often [tainted with bullet
fragments]{.underline}; today [lead poisoning accounts for half of known
condor deaths]{.underline}.11 Similarly afflicted are Andean condors,
the California condor's cousins, whose 10-foot wingspans shadow South
America's Pacific lip. Like their North American relatives, Andean
condors once depended on coastal cuisine, then turned to cattle and
other terrestrial carrion after industrial whaling eliminated their
preferred repast. But it hasn't been a smooth transition. To access
their inland scavenging grounds on the Patagonian steppe, many condors
must wing over the Andes, fight powerful headwinds, and traverse one of
the wettest rainforests on Earth. Condors on the Pacific coast,
scientists note, "​​expend more time and energy than their historical
counterparts" hunting for carcasses, which, along with the coastal
development that has overwhelmed prime foraging grounds, is among the
reasons that they're endangered throughout much of their range.12

Nor are condors the only [scavengers]{.underline} to [get **crowded out
by humans**]{.underline}. This was illustrated by a clever 2012
experiment, in which Australian researchers placed dead fish along two
sets of beaches---some near towns, others in more rural areas.13 While
fish on remote beaches were quickly claimed by native raptors like
whistling kites, the urban carcasses lingered much longer, and were only
belatedly scavenged by nonnative foxes and rats. The implications were
troubling: Many co[astal necrobiomes are **too impoverished by people**
to take full advantage of carrion]{.underline}.

Yet letting scavengers feast can be fraught, too. In California,
scientists typically necropsy cetaceans to ascertain their cause of
death and collect bone and tissue samples. Sometimes, though, bodies
wash up near nesting colonies of snowy plovers, threatened seabirds who
lay their eggs in sandy hollows. Cutting open a whale on a plover beach,
says Moe Flannery, a senior collections manager at the California
Academy of Sciences who investigates cetacean strandings, risks
attracting ravens, coyotes, and other scavengers, who might prey on
plover eggs and chicks once they're in the area. Some land managers
prohibit necropsies near plover beaches altogether, even if performing
one would theoretically benefit scavengers.

Plovers have always contended with predators and the carcasses that
enticed them, of course---but today their populations, diminished by
development, are more vulnerable to hungry mouths and beaks. We may wish
to restore coastal necrobiomes, yet our broken world doesn't always make
it easy.

Millennia ago, we humans were as dependent on whale carcasses as
condors. Coastal Indigenous peoples around the planet---the Arawak, the
Maori, the Inuit---exploited stranded cetaceans for food and tool
material. In one Spanish cave occupied by humans some 14,000 years ago,
researchers unearthed barnacles that grow only upon the skin of right
whales, a molluscan testament to our ancestors' scavenging prowess.14 To
Patagonia's Fuegians, each dead whale was a "great gift of nature."

"For as long as there have been humans," Rebecca Giggs points out in
Fathoms, her meditation on cetaceans, "the whale has been a portentous
animal." Precisely what a dead whale portends, however, has changed
drastically. In the Anthropocene, carcasses aren't always divine gifts;
sometimes they're curses of a sort, the rotten fruits of modernity's
diseased tree. Whales and dolphins are diced by ship propellers, drowned
by fishing gear, starved by the plastic bezoars that accumulate in their
guts. Pods of pilot whales, agonized and disoriented by the clamor of
naval sonar and seismic energy testing, hurl themselves onto beaches. A
symbol of nature's bounty transmutates into a symptom of its collapse.
[We jettison dead whales not just because they're smelly shark
attractants]{.underline}, perhaps, [but to **escape the evidence of our
sins**]{.underline}.

Our treatment of dead whales mirrors our treatment of most dead animals.
Highway maintenance personnel haul roadkill to the dump, a reasonable
safety measure that also disguises the violence of automobility. In
Spain, regulations imposed in the wake of Mad Cow Disease require
farmers to incinerate livestock rather than letting their bodies nourish
vultures. Our "aseptic" approach to carcass management has
short-circuited processes, like scavenging and decomposition, that have
buttressed ecosystems since the dawn of microbial life. Because objects
interred in landfills don't readily break down, many coastal dumps have
become tombs for the unprocessed corpses of whales and dolphins, as
eerily preserved as pharaohs in their pyramids. "It's kind of a joke
among marine-mammal people," Megan Stolen says. "When life on Earth ends
and the aliens come down, they're going to wonder what the heck these
humans were doing."

And the management of dead cetaceans will only grow more vexing. Many
whale populations have grown in recent decades, meaning there's more
future carrion in the sea; some groups of humpbacks, for instance, have
nearly recovered from whaling.15 Less happily, [climate change
is]{.underline} already **[wreaking havoc on marine
ecosystems]{.underline}**. Along the Pacific Coast, [a recent rash of
stranded and emaciated gray whales may be symptomatic of **dwindling
Arctic food supplies**]{.underline}.16 [Warmer oceans]{.underline} may
also [give rise to more infectious diseases and]{.underline}, with them,
"**[mass mortality events]{.underline}**."17 For some creatures, the
carcass boom may present a grim opportunity. During the Pleistocene,
when warmer temperatures melted Arctic sea-ice and left polar bears
unable to hunt seals, Ursus maritimus likely survived by scavenging
cetaceans.17 It's some solace to think that the great white bear, the
poster-species for global warming, could yet endure the Anthropocene on
a putrescent diet of bowheads and grays.

In a sense, says Quaggiotto, [humanity's relationship with stranded
cetaceans must come full circle]{.underline}. A dead whale furnishes
vital data about the health of our oceans; reconnects us to nature; and
nourishes the scavengers whose waste-management services support our own
health. A dead whale, as our forebears knew, was both tragedy and gift,
an object to be cherished and learned from, not reflexively discarded.
"For looking at the future of carcass management, we must also look to
the past," Quaggiotto says.

the hunting of baleen whales, we **accelerated**]{.underline} our
**[emissions]{.underline}** of greenhouse gases, [**driving global
warming** and the **rapid alteration of high-latitude oceans** that are
primary foraging areas for baleen whales.]{.underline} As a result,
[populations that are recovering from the impacts of whaling
are]{.underline} now [inhabiting ecosystems]{.underline} that are being
**[profoundly affected by climate change]{.underline}**. Climate
projections predict that [upwelling regions and polar systems will
experience declines in productivity as ocean temperatures
rise]{.underline} (95, 96). Ecosystem models suggest that [a projected
reduction and redistribution of Antarctic zooplankton will slow and
reverse recoveries of Southern Hemisphere baleen whales]{.underline},
due in part to interspecific competition among species (97).

Our simulations suggest that, if environmental and climate effects act
through density-dependent mechanisms as we hypothesize, then [recovered
populations that are already experiencing density-dependent constraints
will **respond more quickly** and **in greater magnitude to
climate-associated declines in productivity**]{.underline}. This
presents another paradox: [Populations]{.underline} that are [considered
recovered or close to recovery will]{.underline} likely [be **the
first** to exhibit climate-associated downturns. Depleted
populations]{.underline}, in contrast, [are less likely to experience
climate-driven declines until prey availability decreases to levels that
introduce intraspecific competition]{.underline}. Thus, it may be [the
populations of least conservation concern that experience the most
substantial early responses]{.underline} to climate change. This may
already be playing out in several cases. Eastern North Pacific gray
whales have long been considered an icon of successful conservation, but
have experienced three major mortality events over the past three
decades in response to variable Arctic prey conditions and access to
feeding areas. Whereas the first two mortality events lasted for 2 years
and were followed by rapid recoveries, the most recent mortality event
lasted twice as long and has been associated with an ongoing depression
of reproductive output that has so far lasted for 6 years (98, 99). The
[Arctic feeding grounds]{.underline} of this species [are among the most
rapidly changing ecosystems]{.underline} on the planet (100). Similarly,
the recent major abundance decline in North Pacific humpback whales
coincided with repeated and prolonged marine heatwaves (14), an ongoing
manifestation of climate change in the North Pacific (101, 102). These
populations have made some of the strongest post-whaling recoveries and
were among the first populations to show substantial responses to
climate change in their abundance and vital rates.

The potential impacts of climate change on marine mammal populations
have been extensively reviewed (103--105), and it is not our intention
to duplicate those efforts here. However, [it is important to
distinguish]{.underline} between [density-dependent and
density-independent effects of climate change on these
species]{.underline} when considering how they will manifest in
recovered and depleted populations. [The most widely anticipated impacts
to marine mammals from climate change are **changes in distribution** in
response to poleward shifts of prey species, driven by warming ocean
temperatures]{.underline} (104). In turn, [this could expose baleen
whales to increased risk of acute human impacts]{.underline} such as
vessel strikes and fisheries interactions in regions where they were
previously seen rarely, as has been documented in North Atlantic right
whales (Eubalaena glacialis) (106). This is an example of a
density-independent effect of climate change, which would be expected to
affect both recovered and depleted populations similarly.

[Future impacts]{.underline} to baleen whale carrying capacities and
prey availability [will not be limited to climate change and natural
environmental variability]{.underline}. We have focused here on
intraspecific density- dependent feedbacks, but [interspecific
competition may also be a constraining force on baleen whale population
dynamics]{.underline} (107), [depending on the extent of niche
overlap]{.underline} (22, 24). Humans can function as important
consumers of lower trophic level prey of baleen whales. In the Southern
Ocean, for example, krill fisheries have recently increased in scale and
could potentially act as a further competitor to baleen whales that feed
seasonally in the waters surrounding Antarctica (108). [The harvest of
krill could reduce the total prey biomass available to baleen
whales]{.underline} in the Southern Ocean, effectively reducing their
carrying capacities and inducing density dependence at lower abundance
levels than historical abundances before whaling. [Collectively, natural
environmental variability, increasing climate impacts, and poorly
managed human harvest of low trophic level prey items could drive
**major interannual variability**]{.underline} in baleen whale
population dynamics, [with the strongest responses expected in recovered
populations]{.underline}.

### No Impact\-\--Arctic Biodiversity

#### Biodiversity is resilient despite warming 

**Gray 6-9** \[Luna Gray; Writer for Earth Vocal; 06-09-25; Frozen

[What makes Arctic biodiversity even more remarkable is how species are
highly specialized to their environment]{.underline}. These adaptations
are not flexible; they are precise responses to ice, cold, light, and
scarcity. This specialization, while impressive, also makes Arctic
biodiversity extremely vulnerable to environmental change---especially
climate change.

[The Arctic is warming at nearly four times the global average rate, a
phenomenon known as Arctic amplification.]{.underline} Sea ice is
melting earlier in the spring and forming later in the autumn, which
disrupts the entire food chain. Without stable sea ice, seals lose
breeding grounds. Without seals, polar bears starve. Algal blooms shift,
affecting fish populations. Migratory patterns are thrown off, and new
predators or pathogens may enter the system. Essentially, the delicate
balance of Arctic biodiversity begins to unravel.

Scientists and conservationists are working hard to understand and
protect this hidden web of life. [From remote monitoring stations to
satellite tracking of animal movements, the effort to preserve Arctic
ecosystems is global. Indigenous communities, such as the Inuit, also
offer traditional ecological knowledge, having lived in harmony with
Arctic biodiversity for centuries.]{.underline}

While legal protections exist through agreements like the Arctic
Council, much more is needed. [Sustainable fishing, emissions reduction,
and protected marine zones can all contribute to preserving the Arctic's
biodiversity]{.underline}. But without immediate and collective action,
many of these species---and the relationships they maintain---could be
lost forever.

One way the public can help is by simply raising awareness. [Knowing
that life thrives at the top of the world, and understanding how
connected it is to the rest of the planet, helps build a case for its
protection. The Arctic may seem distant, but the climate systems, ocean
currents, and animal migrations that depend on it affect us
all.]{.underline} What happens at the North Pole doesn't stay at the
North Pole.

In conclusion, [the North Pole is not barren---it's brimming with life.
That life may be subtle, hidden beneath ice or cloaked in fog, but it's
there, surviving against all odds. It is a frozen wonder---a treasure
trove of biodiversity---and it urgently needs our attention. Every
phytoplankton bloom, every tern migration, and every seal pup born on
shifting ice is a miracle of adaptation. It's a reminder that
biodiversity is not just about quantity---it's about resilience,
connection, and survival.﻿]{.underline}

#### NBS and indigenous knowledge ensures biodiversity strength

[The Arctic stands at the forefront of our global climate crisis.
Experiencing warming at more than twice the rate of the rest of the
planet, the Arctic faces dramatic transformations as ancient ice melts,
permafrost thaws, and ecosystems undergo upheaval]{.underline}. These
changes lead to a cascade of challenges, from coastal erosion to
shifting wildlife habitats, threatening both natural landscapes and the
communities that depend on them. In response to these pressing
challenges, integrating Indigenous knowledge into nature-based solutions
(NbS) presents a promising approach to enhancing climate resilience.

[NbS is a recently emerging term for actions to leverage the power of
ecosystems to protect people, optimize infrastructure, and ensure a
stable and biodiverse future.]{.underline} These natural (climate)
solutions include conservation efforts, habitat restoration, water
resource management, and green infrastructure initiatives.1) By
harnessing natural ecosystems, [NbS can provide up to 37 percent of the
mitigation needed by 2030 to achieve the targets of the Paris Agreement
and give several benefits for climate adaptation and biodiversity
enhancement.2) Informed and well-structured NbS can reduce climate
change impacts on local communities and counter biodiversity
loss.]{.underline} However, effective NbS are complex and difficult to
design, especially in fragile ecosystems. Therefore, Indigenous
communities and their knowledges are crucial for finding effective
solutions to preserve and protect the Arctic.

[Combining NbS with Indigenous knowledge, also known as traditional
ecological knowledge, can greatly enhance the effectiveness of local
climate and conservation actions. Indigenous peoples, despite comprising
only a small fraction of the global population, manage between 13 and 20
percent of the world's lands, which contain approximately 80 percent of
the remaining global biodiversity]{.underline}. In the Arctic, this
includes communities such as the Sámi in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and
Northwest Russia; the Nenets, Khanty, Evenk, and Chukchi in Russia; the
Aleut, Yupik, and Inuit (Iñupiat) in Alaska; the Inuit (Inuvialuit) in
Canada; and the Inuit (Kalaallit) in Greenland.3) Since Indigenous
communities' livelihoods are often directly linked to the surrounding
land, northern Indigenous groups are particularly vulnerable to climate
change, experiencing its impacts more intensely and rapidly than many
other regions. For millennia, Arctic Indigenous groups like the Inuit
and Sámi have developed sophisticated land management systems and
ecological knowledge crucial for maintaining their ecosystems' delicate
balance.

[This article explores the importance of combining Indigenous knowledge
with NbS to address climate change impacts in the Arctic, highlighting
the indispensable role of Indigenous expertise in achieving successful
and sustainable outcomes]{.underline}.

[Are we heading for a **Sixth Mass Extinction**]{.underline}?

[Watching]{.underline} the **[populations]{.underline}** of our most
cherished animals [**dwindle** is **painful**]{.underline}. Year by year
we find fewer nests in the trees, fewer footprints in the soil and
smaller herds in satellite images. As tragic as a population decline is,
it's a realm away from the complete loss of a species. When we are
watching a species in decline -- when we have a downward sloping chart
-- we can cling to the hope that we will reach the trough and
[**numbers** will **climb** again]{.underline}. Indeed, [this has
happened **many times**]{.underline}. The [**African**
elephant]{.underline}, the [**Asian** elephant and the **blue whale**
were all on **course** for]{.underline} a **[wipeout]{.underline}**. But
[we **pulled** on the **handbrake** just in time]{.underline}, and
[**populations** have started to]{.underline} **[recover]{.underline}**.

[Over the **last decade**]{.underline} the number of African
**[elephants]{.underline}** in Namibia has doubled.27, 28 In Burkina
Faso they've increased by 50%. In Zambia, South Africa, Angola,
Ethiopia, Malawi and several other countries, populations [are on the
**up**]{.underline}. After enduring a steep decline there were just
15,000 Asian elephants left in India by 1980. Their [numbers
have]{.underline} now [risen]{.underline} to almost 30,000.

Whether a trend is sloping up or sloping down, there is no reason to
believe that it has to continue that way. [We nearly **always** have the
**opportunity** to **turn** things **around**]{.underline}. But when
that line hits zero -- as it does in an extinction event -- our hopes of
a turnaround vanish. It's done. It's finished. That loss hits
differently. [Yet it's one that the planet has experienced many times
over]{.underline}.

[**Ninety-nine** per cent of the 4 billion **species** that have ever
**lived** on Earth are now **gone**]{.underline}.29 [Extinctions have
been]{.underline} a **[natural]{.underline}** part of the planet's
evolutionary history. 30 [Without them, we wouldn't be here]{.underline}
today. [Species go **extinct**]{.underline}, [and **new species**

Brun et al. (2022) found that a few tall, high-SLA plant species had
stronger effects on primary productivity than any measure of functional
diversity. [We add data on species rarity to show that ongoing
biodiversity loss is **unlikely** to **hamper** ecosystem
productivity]{.underline}, a core insight we feel the authors missed.

Main text

Brun et al. (2022) present important new results regarding the
controversial relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.
Studying plant communities from the French and Swiss Alps, they assessed
if the presence or abundance of certain plant species were linked to
higher levels of pivotal ecosystem functions, here primary productivity.
They identified 'key' species, which have a decisive role in overall
productivity, and 'keystone' species, which have disproportionally large
productivity effects given their abundance, and which are a subset of
the key species. Out of 2918 plant species found, they identified 38 key
species, of which 11 qualified as keystone species. They found that the
five key species with largest effects on productivity jointly explained
more deviance in ecosystem productivity than any measure of functional
composition. The results provide evidence supporting the Trait Driver
Theory (Enquist et al. 2015), which is related to the 'mass-ratio
hypothesis' (Grime 1998; Garnier et al. 2004), and against the
'complementary resource use hypothesis' (Naeem et al. 1994). Key and
keystone species were found to be taller and have higher than average
specific leaf area.

Brun et al. (2022) state in their introduction that understanding the
relationships between species richness, functional traits and ecosystem
function "is pivotal for assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss".
Their study builds on solid empirical data, a strong analytical
framework and deals with real-world communities, shaped by abiotic
environmental filtering and non-artificial extinction processes,
something rarely undertaken (e.g. Vile et al. 2006; Mokanyet al. 2008).
Therefore, we miss an explicit evaluation of the assumptions underlying
the 'rivet-popper hypothesis' (Ehrlich & Ehrlich 1981). In this powerful
narrative, the popping rivets leading to the crash of the plane are
juxtaposed to species going extinct, leading to ecosystem collapse. The
metaphor has inspired and gained some support from the so-called random
deletion experiments (e.g. Tilman et al. 1997; Hector et al. 1999), in
which all species are assumed to have equal extinction probability.

We plotted a rank-abundance diagram of the species in the data of Brun
et al. (2022) based on their regional occupancy (using mean local
abundance yielded qualitatively equal results, with a strong positive
correlation between regional occupancy and local abundance; Spearman rho
= 0.93, p \<\< 0.001). [We categorized species as either key, keystone,
redlisted or other and superimposed species]{.underline} category on the
diagram (Fig. 1). Redlist status was derived from the redlists for
vascular plants of Switzerland (Bornand et al. 2016) and the French
region Rhˆone-Alpes (Kristo et al. 2015). We found that key and keystone
species strongly tended to be regionally widespread and locally abundant
species, whereas species threatened with regional extinction were found
in the tail of the rank-abundance distribution. [A one-way anova of
difference in log-transformed frequencies revealed that key and keystone
species did not differ in abundance but were both significantly more
abundant than all other categories and that redlisted species were
significantly less abundant than all other categories]{.underline} (p
\<\< 0.001, TukeyHSD). [It appears evident that the contribution of
**rare species** to ecosystem **productivity** is a weak argument for
conservation actions in their favour]{.underline}. In fact, Fig. 2a of
the original paper shows that many species leads to reduced ecosystem
productivity when present.

A revised version of Ehrlich's aeroplane metaphor could sound: The wings
are effectively attached to the body of the plane by a small number of
large rivets of key importance, while numerous small rivets, most of
which tiny as needles, serve no other function than mere decoration
(Gould & Lewontin 1979). [The biodiversity **crisis** and its derived
biotic homogenization **implies** that already common **key species**
increase in occupancy and **abundance**, while initially **un-common**
species decrease or vanish **completely**]{.underline} (Finderup Nielsen
et al. 2019; Kempel et al. 2020).

[There is solid **evidence** for **loss** of endangered species
**disproportionately** happening in **low-productive natural
ecosystems**]{.underline} (Walker et al. 2004; Wassen et al. 2005),
[which we show have **very low extinction risk**.]{.underline} Moreover,
[the plant **species** critical to human sustenance are all
**superabundant crops**, such as wheat, corn and rice]{.underline}. [We
propose it is time the scientific **community acknowledge** that
arguments for **biodiversity** conservation should not be sought in
**optimization** of **productivity**, decomposition rate or -- in
general -- in efficiency of ecosystem **processes**]{.underline}. [We
are]{.underline} not misanthropic, but rather [confident that
**disciplines** such as agronomy, forestry, technical sciences,
geophysics and medicine will look after the well-being of our own
species.]{.underline}

#### No [existential]{.underline} collapse.

Dr. Peter **Kareiva &** Valerie **Carranza 18**, Adjunct Professor,

Los Angeles; PhD, Environmental Sciences, University of California,
Riverside, \"Existential Risk due to Ecosystem Collapse: Nature Strikes
Back,\" Futures, Vol. 102, pg. 6-7, September 2018, ScienceDirect.

The interesting question is whether any of the planetary thresholds
other than CO2 could also portend existential risks. Here the answer is
not clear. One [boundary]{.underline} often [mentioned]{.underline} as a
concern for the fate of global civilization [is]{.underline}
**[biodiversity]{.underline}** (Ehrlich & Ehrlich, 2012), with the
proposed safety threshold being a loss of greater than .001% per year
(Rockström et al., 2009). [There is]{.underline} **[little
evidence]{.underline}** [that this]{.underline} particular [.001% annual
loss is a]{.underline} **[threshold]{.underline}**---[and it is hard to
imagine]{.underline} **[any data]{.underline}** th[at would allow one to
identify]{.underline} **[where]{.underline}** [the threshold
was]{.underline} (Brook et al., 2013; Lenton & Williams, 2013). A better
question is whether one can imagine any scenario by which the loss of
too many species leads to the collapse of societies and environmental
disasters, even though [one cannot know the]{.underline}
**[absolute]{.underline}** [number of extinctions that would
be]{.underline} **[required]{.underline}** [to create this
dystopia]{.underline}.

While there are **[data]{.underline}** that [relate]{.underline}
**[local reductions]{.underline}** [in species richness to altered
ecosystem function, these results]{.underline} **[do not point
to]{.underline}** substantial **[existential risks]{.underline}**. The
[data are]{.underline} **[small-scale]{.underline}** [experiments in
which plant productivity, or nutrient retention is reduced as species
number declines locally]{.underline} (Vellend, 2017), [or]{.underline}
are **[local]{.underline}** [observations of increased
variability]{.underline} in fisheries yield [when]{.underline} stock
[diversity is lost]{.underline} (Schindler et al., 2010). [Those
are]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** existential [risks]{.underline}.
[To make the link]{.underline} even more **[tenuous]{.underline}**,
[there is]{.underline} **[little evidence]{.underline}** that
[biodiversity is]{.underline} **[even declining at local
scales]{.underline}** (Vellend et al 2017; Vellend et al., 2013). Total
planetary biodiversity may be in decline, but [local and regional
biodiversity is]{.underline} often [staying the same because
species]{.underline} from elsewhere **[replace]{.underline}** [local
losses]{.underline}, albeit homogenizing the world in the process.
Although the majority of conservation scientists are likely to flinch at
this conclusion, [there is]{.underline} **[growing
skepticism]{.underline}** [regarding the]{.underline}
**[strength]{.underline}** [of evidence linking trends in biodiversity
loss to an]{.underline} **[existential risk]{.underline}** for humans
(Maier, 2012; Vellend, 2014). Obviously if all biodiversity disappeared
civilization would end---but [no one is forecasting the]{.underline}
**[loss of all species]{.underline}**. It seems plausible that the loss
of 90% of the world's species could also be apocalyptic, but not one is
predicting that degree of biodiversity loss either. Tragic, but
[plausible is the possibility our planet suffering a loss
of]{.underline} as many as **[half]{.underline}** [of its
species]{.underline}. If global biodiversity were halved, but at the
same time locally the number of species stayed relatively stable, [what
would be the]{.underline} **[mechanism]{.underline}** [for an
end-of-civilization]{.underline} or even end of human prosperity
[scenario]{.underline}? [Extinctions and biodiversity loss
are]{.underline} ethical and spiritual losses, but perhaps
**[not]{.underline}** [an existential risk]{.underline}.

What about the remaining eight planetary boundaries? Stratospheric ozone
depletion is one---but thanks to the Montreal Protocol ozone depletion
is being reversed (Hand, 2016). Disruptions of the nitrogen cycle and of
the phosphorous cycle have also been proposed as representing potential
planetary boundaries (one boundary for nitrogen and one boundary for
phosphorous). There are compelling data linking excesses in these
nutrients to environmental damage. For example, over-application of
fertilizer in Midwestern USA has led to dead zones in the Gulf of
Mexico. Similarly, excessive nitrogen has polluted groundwater in
California to such an extent that it is unsuitable for drinking and some
rural communities are forced to drink bottled water. However, these
impacts are local. At the same time that there is too much N loading in
the US, there is a need for more N in Africa as a way of increasing
agricultural yields (Mueller et al., 2012). While the disruption of
nitrogen and phosphorous cycles clearly perturb local ecosystems,
end-of-the-world scenarios seem a bit far-fetched.

Another hypothesized planetary boundary entails the conversion of
natural habitats to agricultural land. The mechanism by which too much
agricultural land could cause a crisis is unclear---unless it is because
land conversion causes so much biodiversity loss that is species
extinctions that are the proximate cause of an eco-catastrophe.
Excessive chemical pollution and excessive atmospheric aerosol loading
have each been suggested as planetary boundaries as well. In the case of
these pollution boundaries, there are well-documented mechanisms by
which surpassing some concentration of a pollutant inflicts severe human
health hazards. There is abundant evidence linking chemical and aerosol
pollution to higher mortality and lower reproductive success in humans,
which in turn could cause a major die-off. It is perhaps appropriate
then that when Hollywood envisions an unlivable world, it often invokes
a story of humans poisoning themselves. That said, it is doubtful that
we will poison ourselves towards extinction. [Data show]{.underline}
that [as nations]{.underline} **[develop]{.underline}** and increase
their wealth, [they tend to]{.underline} clean up their air and water
and **[reduce]{.underline}** environmental **[pollution]{.underline}**
(Flörke et al., 2013; Hao & Wang, 2005). [In addition, as economies
become]{.underline} **[more circular]{.underline}** (see Mathews & Tan,
2016), [environmental damage]{.underline} due to waste products [is
likely to]{.underline} **[decline]{.underline}**. The [key point
is]{.underline} that the pollutants associated with [the]{.underline}
planetary [boundaries are]{.underline} **[so widely
recognized]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} the
**[consequences]{.underline}** of local toxic events [are
so]{.underline} **[immediate]{.underline}**, that [it is reasonable to
expect]{.underline} national [governments to act]{.underline}
**[before]{.underline}** [we suffer a]{.underline} planetary
[ecocatastrophe]{.underline}.

Results

[Application of the average 2000--2019, hereafter 'recent', climatology
to Greenland's entire glacierized area of 1,783,090 km2 gives an
AAR/AAR0 (α) disequilibrium with the current ice configuration
corresponding with a 3.3 ± 0.8% committed area and volume loss. Taken in
perpetuity, this imbalance with recent climate results in
59 ± 15 × 10\^3 km2 of committed retreat of Greenland's ice area,
equivalent to 110 ± 27 × 103 km3 of the ice sheet volume or 274 ± 68 mm
of global eustatic SLR.]{.underline}

Over the 2000--2019 period, we found that [surface ablation through
meltwater run-off is the primary control on the trend and interannual
variability of the Greenland ice sheet mass budget.]{.underline} The
magnitude of the SMB trend is twice that of tidewater ice flow discharge
(D) and the variability in SMB is an order of magnitude greater (Fig.
2). SMB variability is dominated by that from meltwater run-off (SMB
versus R correlation: −0.855, 1 − P \> 0.999), with the SMB versus
precipitation (P) correlation = 0.528, 1 − P \> 0.983. Despite run-off
(R) averaging less than the ice flow discharge, its interannual
variability exceeds that of D by a factor of ten. [Indicative of an
intensifying hydrological system, the ice sheet has been undergoing
increased mass turnover, while paradoxically in a state of retreat and
thinning19]{.underline},20. The AAR to mass balance correlation holds
independently for both tidewater and land-terminating sectors,
demonstrating that [the impact of increasing surface ablation and
run-off is not limited to land-terminating sectors but prevails across
the entire ice sheet given that 84% of its volume is
marine-terminating]{.underline} (Extended Data Fig. 2).

T[he high-melt year of 2012 was driven by a persistent negative extreme
in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO index = −1.6),]{.underline}
[delivering excess atmospheric heat to Greenland21]{.underline},22,
which caused enhanced and sustained surface ablation and meltwater
run-off, for example3,23. [Taking this high-melt year as an analogue for
a projected late-twenty-first-century sustained warmer
climate]{.underline} (Tedstone et al.24), we found that the year 2012
AAR applied in perpetuity to Greenland [commits a minimum of 10 ± 2% ice
area (169 ± 29 × 103 km2) decline equivalent to 314 ± 54 × 103 km3 of
the ice sheet volume or 782 ± 135 mm eustatic SLR (Table
1).]{.underline}

[Conversely, summer 2018 was dominated by an extreme positive
NAO]{.underline} (index = +1.5) with cold polar air drawn along
Greenland's broad western flank, suppressing surface melt and resulting
in the lowest surface mass loss recorded so far this century3 (Fig. 1).
Across virtually all sectors, this low surface ablation year had an
AAR ≈ AAR0, indicating that the ice sheet was temporarily in a state of
mass budget equilibrium. [Western Greenland, which includes the large
tidewater outlet glaciers of Jakobshavn Isbrae, Rink, Upernavik and
Store (Mouginot et al.19) still had an implicit adjustment with net mass
loss]{.underline} [despite predominantly cool surface
climatology]{.underline} but which was insufficient to offset the mass
gains from snowfall and suppressed surface melting.

[The respectively high and low-melt years of 2012 and 2018 are useful to
represent future extremes that are becoming the hallmark of Arctic
amplified climate change25,26,27. Indeed, Greenland climate variability
is observed to be increasing28,29, yet it is not well captured by global
climate models30.]{.underline}

Given no area dependence on specific mass balance across the 473 sectors
(Extended Data Fig. 3), we may obtain ice mass closure for the missing
1% of ice area arising from areas smaller than 30 km2 not considered in
this study due to a 1-km resolution constrain on the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo grids by applying the mean
specific imbalance for land-terminating sectors of
−446 ± 309 kg m−2 y−1. That residual area has a recent climate (years
2000--2019) imbalance of 3.4 ± 2.7 mm sea level equivalent.

Regional imbalance

Strong regional patterns of Greenland ice disequilibrium and committed
SLR from the 2000 to 2019 climate are evident with the present-day
imbalance of western Greenland being four times that of eastern sectors
(Table 1). Such regional contrast arises from strong east--west
gradients in snowfall accumulation31, coupled with high eastern
topographic relief15 and proximity to high south-eastern (SE) snowfall
North Atlantic storms31 that altogether result in a 30% steeper SE ice
surface slope compared to the western ice sheet. [Hence, the gentler
western sectors of the ice sheet are generally more susceptible to
recent surface warming and yield larger melt volumes amplified by the
flatter elevation profile, thinner seasonal snow cover and a darker
ablation area]{.underline}32,33. The year 2012 high-melt case resulted
in a fourfold increase in disequilibrium from predominantly
land-terminating south-western (SW) sectors and a 186 ± 30 mm SLR
commitment, which is the highest of all Greenland sectors. Under the
anomalously low-melt year 2018 surface climate, the SW incurs a mass
budget surplus of 22 ± 13 mm equivalent sea-level drawdown. Although of
a smaller magnitude than the sea-level drawdown from the north-eastern
(NE) and central eastern (CE) regions, the magnitude of the difference
between the 2012 and 2018 scenarios is greatest for the SW, highlighting
the SW as a surface-climate-sensitivity hotspot region.

The predominantly marine-terminating north-western (NW) sector is most
out of balance with the 2000--2019 climate (Table 1 and Fig. 3),
committing 79 ± 12 mm equivalent SLR. The region is sensitive to climate
warming34 and meltwater run-off35 compounded by its marine-terminating
margin with a relatively high regional ice flow discharge. Under a
perpetual high-melt year 2012, this region's mass loss commitment
increases to 169 ± 28 mm equivalent SLR; under a perpetual 2018 climate,
the sector is in mass budget equilibrium. In contrast to the NW, the
relatively small SE sector, with just 8% of Greenland's ice volume,
yields just 4% of the recent ice imbalance (Table 1) despite this region
having the largest ice flow discharge; 20% of the total36. However,
under the 2012 climate applied in perpetuity, the mass loss commitment
from the SE increases substantially to 67 ± 8 mm equivalent SLR but has,
like for the NW, a stable mass budget under the low-melt 2018 climate.

The relatively high elevation, cold and dry CE region is in mass budget
equilibrium with the 2000--2019 climate (Table 1), a finding confirmed
by recent satellite altimetry3,20. Despite rising air temperatures
during the past two decades, a negative correspondence of mass balance
with NAO across the region has delivered increased snowfall while
limiting surface melt37. However, the CE region is vulnerable to future
sustained mass loss as represented by the high-melt year of 2012. The CE
region likewise exemplifies considerable climate sensitivity with an ice
mass budget surplus under the cool year 2018 climate, yielding a
substantial 44 ± 8 mm hypothetical sea-level drawdown.

Greenland's NE sector, despite including major outlet glaciers and ice
streams that are undergoing considerable dynamic changes19,38, yields a
relatively modest 24 ± 30 mm equivalent SLR under Greenland's recent
climate but which rises to 65 ± 8 mm under a perpetual 2012 climate.
Similarly, the northern (NO) sector with 14% of Greenland's total ice
area, is also mainly marine-terminating but contributes just 3% to the
recent mass imbalance due to much lower surface ablation across this
region, increasing by half to 72 ± 30 mm SLR under the high-melt year
2012 climate.

Although land-terminating sectors comprise around a quarter of
Greenland's glacierized area, they disproportionately account for 41% of
Greenland's recent ice imbalance (Table 1) and demonstrate the dominance
of surface ablation in currently committed ice loss. The
land-terminating versus tidewater sector contrast is strongest for the
SW sector, with the highest concentration of land-terminating ice flow,
accounting for two-thirds of the recent land-terminating SLR commitment.
Application of the extreme 2012 climate increases the land-terminating
SLR commitment threefold, underscoring once again the high sensitivity
of the SW mass budget to climate warming.

Our approach places no bounds on the timescale of Greenland's committed
ice mass loss, making direct comparison with coupled ice flow models an
apples to oranges exercise. Yet, while a linear reservoir assumption
suggests that Greenland ice sheet response times are up to approximately
2,500 years39, transient models indicate that the magnitude of response
to the present day committed ice loss could occur within approximately
200 years40.

Remarkable advances in ice flow modelling have been achieved in recent
years, for example, incorporating higher-order ice rheology, improved
treatment of tidewater dynamics and calving41, subglacial drainage42,
deforming beds43, basal heat dissipation44 and grid-resolution
dependence45. However, for application to Greenland, these have not yet
been fully integrated with sufficiently realistic atmosphere/land/ocean
forcing data nor with sufficient treatment of amplifying processes to
yield a sensitive sub-centennial response to intensifying climate
change6,46.

The Greenland ice loss commitment presented in this study is
complementary to process-based models, yet it is grounded in
observations and theory, albeit lacking a response timescale. [Our
assessed Greenland's ice disequilibrium with 2000--2019 surface climate
that commits the equivalent of 274 ± 68 mm SLR aligns with expert
judgement predicting a mean committed Greenland SLR contribution of
330--490 mm by 2100]{.underline} (ref. 47). Moreover, [application of
the anomalous 2012 melt year in perpetuity taken as a representative
analogue for sustained later-this-century climate yields a Greenland SLR
commitment of 782 ± 135 mm, which also resonates with expert
judgement]{.underline} of metre-scale SLR under the unabated SSP58
future climate scenario47.

The conservative lower bound and error budget (Methods) encompass how
our estimates of committed SLR neglect potential future changes to ice
discharge through fast-flowing outlet glaciers that are not the result
of geometric adjustment to climate but result from changes in fjord
circulation, oceanic heat delivery, calving front dynamics and/or
subglacial conditions.

By demonstrating how the low (2018) and high (2012) melt years encompass
a state of Greenland ice sheet stability on the one hand, or extreme ice
loss amplified by multiple feedbacks on the other, we underscore the
high sensitivity and susceptibility of Greenland's terrestrial ice to
extremes in atmospheric circulation that may not be implicit in global
climate model outputs, for example, Coupled Model Intercomparison
Project Phase 6 (ref. 48). Furthermore, the large interannual Greenland
surface climate variability represented by 2012 and 2018 is obscured
when presentation of mass balance accounting is made as multi-method
aggregates with a time-invariant uncertainty envelope3. Rather, given
that observations demonstrate increases in interannual variability28,29,
we contend that accounting for time-varying magnitudes of extremes may
be essential in obtaining a realistic envelope of future ice response
states.

[Newly emerging processes are driving rapid ice sheet response:
tidewater glacier acceleration and destabilization by submarine
melting49,50,51; loss of floating ice shelves52; accelerating interior
motion from increased melt and rainfall53; enhanced basal thawing due to
hydraulically released latent heat and viscous warming54; amplified
surface melt run-off due to bio-albedo darkening55; and impermeable firn
layers56 amplified by ice sheet surface hypsometry32,33.]{.underline}
Given the breadth and potency of those processes, we contend that known
physical mechanisms can deliver most of the committed ice volume loss
from Greenland's disequilibrium with its recent climate within this
century. Nevertheless, we underscore that [a SLR of at least 274 ± 68 mm
is already committed, regardless of future climate warming
scenarios.]{.underline}

#### Newly discovered microbes solves methane

[Microorganisms found in the ocean may play an important role in the
process of mitigating climate change by acting as "**methane sinks**" on
ocean floors, a new study has found.]{.underline}

Methane is a greenhouse gas that is 80% more effective than carbon
dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Interestingly, microbes on
the seafloor generate large quantities of methane --- often as a result
of breaking down organic matter that includes both dead plants and
animals, as well as the latter's excrements. However, [the same microbes
also act as methane sinks, preventing the gas from escaping into the
atmosphere and eventually warming up the Earth.]{.underline}

While the microbes' methane-trapping abilities were already known to
science, the new study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences, found that [microbes found in rocks underwater are **more
effective** at consuming methane. Microbes within under-sea carbonate
rocks --- like limestone and dolomite --- absorb methane **50 times**
faster than microbes found in the sediments, like rocks and
minerals.]{.underline}

Scientists have also deemed these specific carbonate rocks unusual: they
were not only more porous than other carbonate rocks, but also in the
shape of more than 50-inch-tall chimney-like structures, resembling
groups of underwater trees. Researchers believe the unique structures of
these underwater rocks commonly found in oceans may have a role to play
in rock-dwelling microbes consuming the gas faster than their
counterparts seafloor-dwelling counterparts.

[The scientific validity of the two-degree target has been
**questioned**]{.underline}.

Sustainability scientist Carl Jaeger describes how the two-degree limit
has evolved in a somewhat ad hoc and contradictory fashion: policy
makers have treated it as a scientific finding, and scientists treat it
as a political issue. [It has been presented as a threshold separating a
domain of safety from one of catastrophe,]{.underline} and as an optimal
strategy that balances costs and benefits.35 To avoid making value
judgments, the I[PCC does not define climate change in context of
dangerous; the IPCC Assessment Reports refer to "reasons for
concern."]{.underline} The 5th Assessment Report (AR5) (2014)
articulates five integrative reasons for concern36: • Risk to unique and
threatened systems (e.g., coral reefs, tropical mountain glaciers,
endangered species) • Risk of extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves,
floods, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes) • Disparities of impacts and
vulnerabilities (e.g., disproportionate harm to developing countries and
the poor) • Aggregate damages (i.e., net global market damages) • Risks
of large-scale discontinuities ("tipping points" resulting in rapid
sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and strong amplifiers of warming)
[Tipping points---abrupt or nonlinear transition to a different
state---become likely to occur once some threshold has been crossed,
with regional or global consequences that are largely uncontrollable and
beyond our management.]{.underline} In other words, tipping points are
points of no return, at least on the century timescale. The IPCC AR5
considered a number of potential tipping points, including ice sheet
collapse, collapse of the Atlantic overturning circulation, and carbon
release from permafrost thawing. Every single catastrophic scenario
considered by the IPCC AR5 has a rating of very unlikely or
exceptionally unlikely and/or has low confidence. 37 [The **only**
tipping point that the IPCC AR5 considers likely in the twenty-first
century is **disappearance** of Arctic sea ice **during summer**, which
**reforms** each winter even under extreme warming scenarios. There is
no actual large-scale threshold (or tipping point) in the climate that
has been clearly linked to 2°C global warming.]{.underline} Global
average warming is not the only kind of climate change that is
potentially dangerous, and greenhouse gases such as CO2 are not the only
cause of dangerous climate change. Some potential thresholds cannot be
meaningfully linked to global temperature change and are more regional
in nature; others are sensitive to rates of climate change, and some are
most sensitive to spatial gradients of temperature change. [Among the
greatest concerns about climate change are its impacts on extreme events
such as floods, droughts, wildfires, and hurricanes. However, there is
**little evidence** that the recent warming has worsened such events
(see Chapters Seven and Nine for a more thorough discussion). The first
half of the twentieth century had **more** extreme weather than the
second half, when human-caused global warming is **claimed** to have
been mainly responsible for observed climate change.38]{.underline} The
disconnect between historical data for the past 100 years and climate
model-based projections of worsening extreme weather events presents a
real conundrum regarding the appropriate basis on which to assess risk
and make policies when theory and historical data are in such
disagreement. [With regard to the perception that severe weather events
seem more frequent and more severe over the past decade, there are
several factors in play.]{.underline} [The first is increasing
vulnerability and exposure associated with increasing population and
concentration of wealth in coastal and other disaster-prone regions. The
second factor is natural climate variability. Many extreme weather
events have documented relationships with natural climate
variability.]{.underline} In the United States, extreme weather events
(e.g., droughts, heat waves, and hurricanes) were significantly worse in
the 1930s and 1950s.39 A recent analysis summarizing many studies finds
no evidence to support claims that any part of the overall increase in
global economic losses from weather and climate disasters can be
attributed to global warming. 1.3.3 [The Catastrophe Narrative "The
climate change debate has entered what we might call the Campfire Phase,
in which the goal is to tell the scariest story."]{.underline}
(Journalist and policy analyst Oren Cass)41 In spite of the challenges
associated with the Goldilocks dilemma and in providing a meaningful
definition of dangerous climate change, there is a widespread narrative
within the public domain of (near-term climate catastrophe absent deep
emissions cuts). Climate change is now routinely referred to as the
"climate crisis." This catastrophe narrative is not supported by
mainstream science, but rather propagates via emotive engagement.42
[**Climate catastrophe narratives** are emboldened by climate
reductionism (Section 1.1), whereby climate change is regarded as the
dominant cause of current and future societal problems.]{.underline}

### No Impact\-\--Ocean Acidification

[The concept of ocean acidification]{.underline}, and human-caused
global warming more generally, could be described as containing a grain
of truth embedded in a mountain of nonsense. Indeed, [the projected
large increase in atmospheric CO2 will at most cause a small reduction
in pH -- it **will not turn** the ocean **acidic**.]{.underline} Yet
this is what is implied by the term ocean acidification. True
acidification would require average pH to be reduced below 7.0, at which
point seashells would indeed begin to dissolve. [This is an **impossible
scenario**, however, because of the ocean's effectively **limitless**
buffering capacity.]{.underline} There is a newly published study by
Jeff Clements and team that concludes many of the published studies on
ocean acidification, [especially those studies published in high impact
journals and accompanied by sensational media reporting, have turned-out
to be **wrong**, or at least **exaggerated**.]{.underline} My colleague
Peter Ridd describes the situation: This problem with exaggeration of
threats applies to many areas of science and has a name: The Decline
Effect. The Decline Effect goes like this: an early report, usually
attracting huge media interest, predicts some sort of catastrophe. But
when follow up work is done, usually with far better experimental
procedure and far greater numbers of samples, the original report turns
out to be wrong. [Jeff Clements' team included Timothy Clark, Josefin
Sundin and Frederik Jutfelt who were involved in a study last year
proving that numerous reports by James Cook University's coral reef
centres on reef fish was **totally wrong**.]{.underline} I co-authored a
book chapter with John Abbot some years ago that explained: Initial
concerns about ocean acidification focused on organisms that construct
their shells or skeletons from calcium carbonate. Such organisms are
referred to as marine calcifiers and include not only corals, but also
crabs, clams and conchs (sea snails). [Theoretically, and according to
popular science magazines, all corals are already severely and
negatively affected by ocean acidification. But this is **not evident**
from methodologically sound studies undertaken at the Great Barrier
Reef.]{.underline} A review of the growth rates of six, hard coral
species at Lord Howe Island (Anderson et al. 2015) found marked
variation in the growth rates of branching coral, while growth rates of
the massive Porites coral were unchanged. The researchers suggested that
a decline in the growth rates of the branching species could be
attributable to a reduction in the calcium carbonate saturation state as
a consequence of higher summer temperatures. A study measuring
calcification rates for 41 long-lived Porites corals from seven reefs
from the central Great Barrier Reef (D'Olivio et al. 2009), showed good
recovery from the major 1998 bleaching event, with no significant trend
in calcification rates for the inner reefs. Corals from the mid-shelf
central Great Barrier Reef, however, did show a decline of 3.3%. While
most ocean acidification research has been focused on physiological
processes, in particular calcification, there have also been studies on
three common hard corals to look at their fertilisation, embryonic
development, larval survivorship, and metamorphosis (Chua et al. 2013a;
Chua et al. 2013b). These studies have found the early life-history
stages were unaffected by reduced pH; there was no consistent effect of
elevated CO2 alone, nor in combination with temperature. Studies of the
effect of very high CO2 levels (up to 2,850 ppm) on molluscs --
including oysters, clams, scallops and conchs -- have shown that these
species will generally build their shells more slowly as CO2 levels
increase (Ries et al. 2009). This same study showed that crabs and
lobsters respond quite differently to the same elevated CO2 levels,
showing a general increase in calcification rates. The varied responses
among different organisms reflect their differing abilities to regulate
pH at the site of calcification, and: the extent to which their outer
shell layer is protected by an organic covering the solubility of their
shell, or skeletal mineral the extent to which they use photosynthesis
(Ries et al. 2009). Of course, many marine organisms are not calcifiers,
and some of these organisms have also been tested for a response to
ocean acidification. When seagrasses collected from three locations in
the Great Barrier Reef region -- Cockle Bay, Magnetic Island, and Green
Island -- were exposed to four different CO2 concentration levels for
two weeks -- with water temperature and salinity in the experimental
tanks near-constant throughout -- all three seagrass species exhibited
enhanced photosynthetic responses (Ow et al. 2015). That is growth
rates, observed after two weeks of exposure to an enriched CO2
environment in an indoor aquarium, were higher. This suggests that ocean
acidification could mean more seagrass, which would be good for large
marine mammals like dugongs (dugongs are vulnerable to extinction
because of issues unrelated to changing ocean chemistry). Also, contrary
to expectations, laboratory investigations into the effects of three
different CO2 treatments on anemonefish (commonly known as the
clownfish) found that higher CO2 levels stimulated breeding activity
(Miller et al. 2013). The breeding pairs from the fringing reefs of
Orpheus Island on the Great Barrier Reef, where they are exposed to the
highest CO2 levels, produced double the number of clutches per breeding
pair, and 67% more eggs per clutch than the control. However, young
anemonefish that were bred in high CO2 levels and high temperatures
showed decreases in their length, weight, condition, and survival
(Miller et al. 2012). Though these effects were absent or reversed when
their parents also experienced the higher concentrations (Miller et al.
2013). We concluded: Most studies have been on single species in
contrived laboratory conditions. They have been of short duration, and
they have not considered the potential for adaptation. In the few
instances where adaptation has been considered, it has been shown to
significantly modify the impact of varying pH as a consequence of
elevated levels of CO2. All of this needs to be assessed against the
reality that along the length and breadth of the Great Barrier Reef
there are naturally occurring large daily fluctuations in pH, and that
it is unclear as to what extent the current trends of apparent pH
decline are part of existing natural cycles. Most of the articles
describe the effects of changes of pH on biological organisms; many of
the claims are based exclusively on laboratory experiments (Riebesell &
Gattuso 2015). However, a problem with laboratory experiments is that
they cannot capture the complexities of the real world, not even the
tremendous natural variability in ocean pH -- which is a measure of
ocean acidification. [Of course, Peter Ridd **lost his job** at James
Cook University for speaking truth to power. Those who continue to
publish studies on ocean acidification, especially those studies
published in high impact journals and accompanied by sensational media
reporting, have most recently been rewarded by the Australian government
with an additional \$1billion in funding. Some of this money will end-up
funding more **nonsense ocean acidification** projects at James Cook
University.]{.underline} It is unlikely that any of this grant money
will be used to ensure that there is some quality assurance of the same
research.

### No Impact\-\--Oil Spills

#### Ferrofluid mix is [significantly]{.underline} more efficient and productive than existing methods.

[MIT engineers have come up with a method of extracting clean water and
**reusable oil** from oil spills using nanoparticles that turn the oil
into magnetic ferrofluids.]{.underline} When oil spills occur, the
polluted surface is usually skimmed and a centrifuge system then used to
separate the oil and water, as [Ocean Therapy Solutions\' machines did
following the 2010 BP disaster.]{.underline} [According to the company,
it can clean up to 790,000 litres of oily water per day. Turning the oil
slick into a ferrofluid mix will, MIT is now suggesting, provide a
**faster** and **more efficient** alternative.]{.underline} \"After the
BP oil disaster about two years ago, I got the idea that if the oil were
magnetic we would be able to remove it with strong magnets and separate
it from the water,\" says engineering professor Markus Zahn, who will be
presenting a paper on the theory at the International Conference on
Magnetic Fluids in January 2013. Lead author on the paper and
postdoctoral student Shahriar Khushrushahi explains, \"[The current oil
technology like skimmers are very good in calm waters but in choppy
waters their oil recovery efficiency is about **50 percent**, so
whatever they recover from the water would be half oil, half
water.]{.underline} Our technology is supposed to improve that
efficiency and act as an add on.\" The engineering team tested their
theory by adding magnetic ferrous nanoparticles to test samples of oily
water and then using a series of cylindrical magnets to pull off the
newly magnetically charged contaminate. The method differs from other
experiments that separate oil from water in this way by partially
submerging the magnets in the murky water and ensuring they are
positioned perpendicularly to the flow. In past investigations the
magnets were held above water, but by submerging it the engineers
ensured the oil rushed to the top of the cylinder where it peaks out of
the water (a magnet\'s field is strongest at its edges, and since the
fluid could not reach the submerged bottom, it would inevitably rise to
the surface). In the above video you can see the fluid spring to life
and leap up and around the magnets after it is poured into the water
bath[. Traditional methods of separating oil and water in this way rely
on a system that pumps the mixture through a channel, with exterior
magnets manipulating the flow of the ferrofluid away from the water.
This, says Zahn, is not an entirely reliable method since it is
dependant on having accurate readings on the concentration of the
ferrofluid and in the context of an oil spill it is difficult to be able
to predict and measure this.]{.underline} Rather than relying on a
series of channels where pathways could potentially be infiltrated by
trace amounts of water or oil, the MIT team overcame the challenge by
using the cylindrical magnets, then removing the collected oil using a
Halbach array \-- an arrangement of magnets where one end has a field
near zero and the other has nearly double its usual magnetic field. MIT
tested the theory in small confined containers, and would like to see
oil companies doing the same \-- skimming the surface and opting to
carry out the rest of the water separation onboard a vessel on site,
before shipping it off to a refinery to be reused. It\'s hoped the
economical approach and process will outdo centrifuging in terms of
efficiency. \"You could think of separating oil from water by
centrifuging or something like that, but in a lot of cases, the fluids
are pretty much equal in density: Some of the oil sinks, some of it
floats, and a lot of it is in between,\" says former Exxon researcher
and author of Ferrohydrodynamics Ronald Rosensweig. \"[The magnetic hook
could, hopefully, make separation **faster and better**.]{.underline}\"
\"They often collect the oil and water in these big tanks and let it
separate due to density differences \-- but that takes a long time,\"
says Khushrushahi. [\"\[With our method\] you can separate the two
**very quickly** because the forces are so much stronger than density
\-- you can process this much faster and continuously, without any real
power being expended.\"]{.underline} [The team is investigating the
possibility that water molecules are becoming trapped in the
ferrofluids, as a precautionary measure, but preliminary tests **look
good**.]{.underline}

[Experts from AWI have not discovered any evidence of a global climate
tipping point related to permafrost; instead, they observe that
permafrost soils are thawing in alignment with global warming
trends.]{.underline}

[Permafrost]{.underline} soils contain substantial amounts of organic
carbon and are [frequently described as a crucial tipping
point]{.underline} in the Earth system, potentially collapsing suddenly
and globally once a certain degree of global warming is reached.
However, this [portrayal]{.underline} of permafrost [as a ticking
timebomb]{.underline} that activates abruptly at a specific warming
threshold is [contentious]{.underline} among researchers. A [recent
study led by the Alfred Wegener Institute reveals that this depiction is
misleading, according to the latest scientific evidence.]{.underline}

According to their findings, there **is** [no single global tipping
point; rather, there are numerous local and regional ones, which "tip"
at different times, producing cumulative effects and causing the
permafrost to thaw in step with climate change.]{.underline} As such,
taking decisive action today is all the more important if our goal is to
preserve as much permafrost as possible. The study was just released in
the journal Nature Climate Change.

Permafrost ground covers roughly a quarter of the landmass in the
Northern Hemisphere and stores tremendous quantities of organic carbon
in the form of dead plant matter. As long as it remains frozen, this
matter remains intact -- but when permafrost thaws, microorganisms begin
breaking it down, releasing large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere
as CO2 and methane. Accordingly, rising temperatures worldwide could
activate this massive reservoir and substantially worsen climate change
through additional emissions. Consequently, in the public debate, you'll
frequently encounter the idea of a ["ticking carbon
timebomb."]{.underline}

This is [based on the assumption that the permafrost, like the Greenland
Ice Sheet, is one of several tipping elements in the Earth
system]{.underline}. In this view, permafrost will initially experience
only gradual thawing in response to global warming; then, once a
critical threshold value is surpassed, the thawing processes will
suddenly begin amplifying one another, leading to the rapid and
irreversible collapse of permafrost across the Arctic. Though many have
speculated that this type of thawing scenario is possible, to date it
has remained [unclear whether there really is any such threshold value,
and if so, what the corresponding temperature limit is.]{.underline}

Research Findings on Permafrost Thawing

[An international research team led by Dr Jan Nitzbon from the Alfred
Wegener Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research
(AWI)]{.underline} has now gotten to the bottom of this question. "In
fact, the idea of permafrost being a global tipping element is a
controversial one in the research community. The [IPCC also pointed out
this uncertainty in its latest Assessment Report]{.underline}," says the
AWI expert. "Our goal was to close this gap in our knowledge. For our
study, we [compiled the available academic literature on those processes
that can influence and accelerate the thawing of permafrost. Combining
it with our own data analysis, we assessed all current findings on
thawing processes in terms of whether and, if so, on which spatial scale
-- local, regional, global -- they could lead to self-perpetuating
thawing and therefore to a 'tipping' in connection with a given level of
warming."]{.underline}

[The study's findings are clear:]{.underline} there are indeed
geological, hydrological, and physical [processes that are
self-amplifying]{.underline} and, in some cases, irreversible; however,
these [are acting only locally or regionally]{.underline}. [One example:
the formation of what are known as thermokarst lakes. Here, the ice
inside permafrost soils melts, creating depressions. The meltwater
collects at their surface, producing a dark lake that absorbs large
quantities of solar energy. This in turn intensifies the warming of
permafrost underneath the water, creating a self-sustaining
thawing]{.underline} process in and around the lake. They [also found
similarly amplifying feedback in other permafrost-relevant processes,
like the loss of boreal conifer forests due to fire -- but here, too,
only at the local to regional scale.]{.underline}

"[There is no evidence of self-amplifying internal processes that, from
a certain degree of global warming, affect all permafrost and accelerate
its thawing globally]{.underline}," Jan Nitzbon explains. "Moreover,
[the projected release of greenhouse gases wouldn't lead to a global
upsurge in warming by the end of the century.]{.underline} As such,
[portraying the permafrost as a global tipping element is
misleading."]{.underline}

#### It's too late -- Arctic permafrost and Albedo melt inevitable

Satherley, "Climate change: We\'re 60 years too late to stop global
warming, sea level rises -- study," 9/12/2020,

[We\'re perhaps between 50 and 60 years too late to prevent catastrophic
climate change simply by ceasing emissions]{.underline}, scientists say.

[Temperatures will continue to rise for a long time after we reach
carbon-zero, new research has found, and the only way to avoid the worst
will be to start actively taking carbon out of the
atmosphere.]{.underline}

But the research has been criticised by Kiwi climate scientists, saying
the findings are unrealistic and based on low-complex modelling, rather
than state-of-the-art systems.

Two Norwegian researchers ran simulations of the global climate between
1850 and 2500, looking at how different levels of greenhouse gas
emissions affected temperatures and sea level rises.

[Under the most likely optimistic scenario - emissions peaking in the
2030s before gradually declining to zero by 2100, by 2500 the seas would
be 3m higher and temperatures on average 3C warmer than in
1850.]{.underline} 1850 is when the concentration of carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere began to skyrocket, thanks to industrialisation.

Even if we stopped emissions today, \"global temperatures will still be
around 3C warmer and sea levels will rise by around 2.5 metres by
2500\", the modelling showed.

\"We have identified a point-of-no-return in our climate model ESCIMO -
and that it is already behind us,\" climate scientists Jorgen Randers
and Ulrich Goluke wrote in journal Scientific Reports.

\"In ESCIMO the global temperature keeps rising to 2500 and beyond,
irrespective of how fast humanity cuts the emissions of man-made
greenhouse gas emissions.\"

[There are three main drivers of this continued growth in temperatures
and sea level rises.]{.underline} The [first is a \"cycle of
self-sustained melting of the permafrost\". It\'s already melting,
releasing methane - a gas with an even stronger greenhouse effect than
carbon dioxide - which causes more temperature rises, and more
melting.]{.underline}

The [second is \"lower surface albedo\" - with less of the Earth\'s
surface covered by ice and snow, less of the sun\'s energy is reflected
back into space. This means it absorbs more, contributing to
warming.]{.underline}

And the [third is water vapour. A warmer atmosphere is a more humid one,
and water vapour is also a greenhouse gas.]{.underline}

Under the first scenario - [cutting emissions to zero by 2100 - the
model found temperatures would peak at 2.3C above 1850 around 2075,
before declining over the next 75 years.]{.underline}

[But then something unexpected happens - temperatures start going back
up again.]{.underline}

\"[The surprising fact is that this rise takes place 50 years after
man-made emissions have ceased]{.underline}, and after the concentration
of CO2 in the atmosphere has been significantly reduced through
absorption in oceans and biomass.\"

\"[The effect of surface albedo continues on its smooth upward path
throughout this period\... it has enough momentum to push the climate
system back onto a path of rising temperatures, with its secondary
effects of raising humidity and permafrost melting]{.underline}, which
then in turn help the system become warmer and warmer, even if man-made
greenhouse gas emissions are zero.

[\"A cycle of self-reinforcing processes is established\... The process
is self-sustaining, at least until all carbon is released from
permafrost and all ice is melted.\"]{.underline}

[Even if emissions are cut to zero right now, the same thing happens -
albeit about 75 years later. In other words, we\'re past the point of no
return.]{.underline}

[Mitigation and remediation efforts to address radioactive contamination
in the Arctic encompass]{.underline} a multifaceted approach that
integrates [international agreements, effective cleanup and containment
strategies, and the invaluable role of indigenous knowledge]{.underline}
\[39\]. [International agreements and policies, such as the United
Nations' Stockholm Convention and the Arctic Council's initiatives,
provide a framework for coordinated action and set binding commitments
for the reduction and monitoring of radioactive pollutants]{.underline}.
These agreements foster collaboration among Arctic nations, promoting
the sharing of data, technology, and best practices \[20\]. Cleanup and
containment strategies are pivotal to mitigating the environmental and
health S. O. Adeniran-Obey et al. 269 impacts of contamination. These
[strategies include the removal of contaminated soil and sediments, the
use of barriers to prevent the spread of radionuclides, and advanced
techniques such as phytoremediation]{.underline}, [which leverages
plants to absorb and sequester radioactive substances]{.underline}.
Additionally, the encapsulation and secure storage of radioactive waste
are essential to prevent further environmental release \[29\].
Indigenous knowledge plays a critical role in these efforts, offering
unique insights into local ecosystems and effective management practices
honed over generations. Indigenous communities possess a deep
understanding of the land and its ecological interconnections, which can
enhance the precision and cultural relevance of remediation activities.
Their involvement ensures that mitigation measures are not only
scientifcally sound but also socially and culturally acceptable,
fostering greater community engagement and cooperation[. Collectively,
these efforts underscore the importance of a comprehensive,
collaborative, and culturally informed approach to addressing the
challenges of radioactive contamination in the Arctic, ensuring the
protection and resilience of this vulnerable region.]{.underline}

Despite representing \~0.3% of Earth's biomass, wild animals can exert
oversized impacts on ecosystem carbon cycling via diverse mechanisms5.
For example, recent modelling efforts suggest that African forest
elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis) may increase above-ground carbon stocks
by \~7.5% through engineering habitat and promoting growth of
carbon-rich plants3. This research, among other studies, has generated
the argument that global rewilding can expand nature-based solutions to
prevent climate warming beyond 1.5--2 °C4. Yet, [the prospect of
leveraging animals for globally significant carbon capture should be met
with **caution**]{.underline} (Fig. 1a). A recent study4 estimated that
[conservation and rewilding]{.underline} of nine key animal groups
[could result in a net uptake of]{.underline} 6.41 Pg [CO 2]{.underline}
yr−1, \~64% of the Paris Agreement's natural climate solutions target.
However, despite emphasis of rewilding terrestrial and marine megafauna,
this estimate attributes \~90% of carbon capture benefits to conserving
marine fish populations 4.

[Media outlets have]{.underline} also [**skewed attention** heavily
towards large animals' positive roles in carbon capture]{.underline}
(Fig. 1b). Yet, [animal impacts on carbon cycling are **extremely
variable** and **context-dependent** among species and
environments]{.underline} 5,6 (Table 1). For example, unlike forest
elephants, savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) can decrease
above-ground carbon stocks by \~65% through herbivory, trampling and
tree toppling7. [Muskox]{.underline} (Ovibos moschatus)
[may]{.underline} similarly [increase carbon storage in Arctic mire, but
decrease carbon storage in tundra shrubland]{.underline}5. [Herbivore
impacts on carbon balance are]{.underline} further [**convoluted** by
the presence or absence of predators]{.underline}. For example,
predation by wolves may enhance carbon storage in boreal forest but
reduce carbon storage in grasslands due to the variable impacts of their
prey 5,6.

Additionally, [current predictions of]{.underline} rewilding [impacts on
carbon balance]{.underline} often [focus on **above-ground
carbon**]{.underline} 3,4 ; however, [animals can influence carbon
balance via numerous]{.underline} diverse [mechanisms]{.underline} 5.
For example, savanna elephants can increase below-ground carbon through
deposition of organic carbon in dung while escalating carbon emissions
by stimulating decomposition8. Animals can also influence carbon balance
through indirect effects on fire regimes and soil-carbon persistence9.
Ultimately, [animals can promote the capture or release of carbon **in
different settings**, exhibiting a **high degree of variability**,
particularly in response to rapidly changing environments]{.underline}6.
[**Increased carbon storage is not an inevitable outcome of healthy,
functional ecosystems**: current scientific knowledge indicates there is
**no straight-forward answer** when predicting wildlife impacts on
carbon balance]{.underline}.

The reality of scaling animal impacts on carbon balance

[Given the **uncertainty** and **context-dependency** of animals' roles
in carbon capture]{.underline} at the ecosystem level, [scaling
estimates globally bestows an incredible challenge]{.underline}. On
land, only \~11% of areas available for rewilding are formally
protected4. The [remaining spaces introduce numerous social
barriers]{.underline} (for example, human--wildlife conflict),
[complicating carbon capture outcomes]{.underline}6,10. These challenges
are [especially]{.underline} true for [apex predators and will be
particularly]{.underline} (and unjustly) [pertinent to the Global
South]{.underline}. Rewilding objectives may also counteract
revegetation efforts and convolute carbon capture goals. For example, a
recent meta-analysis 11 found that herbivory reduced vegetation stocks
by a mean of 89% at restoration sites globally. Consequently, [even with
sufficient investment, attaining the necessary spatial scale and
restoration outcomes to make carbon benefits meaningful for climate
mitigation may be **unrealistic**]{.underline}.

For wildlife conservation and rewilding to meaningfully contribute to
climate mitigation, they must also align with the goal of achieving
net-zero CO2 emissions by the mid--late twenty-first century1. [Even if
current biodiversity declines are halted, and large animal population
growth is rapidly initiated, most species will take **several
generations**, spanning]{.underline} decades to [**centuries**, to reach
their carrying capacity]{.underline} (Fig. 1c). [Large animals give
birth infrequently and to few young]{.underline}, and [population growth
is]{.underline} further [slowed by **apex predator rewilding, human
exploitation**]{.underline} (for example, poaching) [and **increasing
extreme climate events**]{.underline} (for example, fire, flooding).
[Where animal influence is mediated through tree biomass]{.underline}
(for example, forest elephants), [responses are]{.underline} further
[delayed by slow tree demographics]{.underline}. Thus, [animal effects
on carbon balance can range **from years**]{.underline} (for example,
herbivory) **[to centuries]{.underline}** (for example, seed dispersal).
Although these timeframes are valuable to consider for long-term carbon
balance 9, [rewilding is **unlikely to meet immediate climate mitigation
needs**]{.underline} (Fig. 1d).

### No Impact\-\--Sea Level Rise

#### Sea level rise is [wildly]{.underline} exaggerated, and even [worst-case]{.underline} scenario could be solve with adaptation.

**Lewis 21** \[Marlo Lewis; PhD, senior fellow at the Competitive
Enterprise Institute; 12-1-2021; "Why Carbon Taxes Are Anti-Growth,
Anti-Consumer, and Politically Dangerous for Conservatives"; Competitive
Enterprise Institute;
https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Marlo_Lewis\_-\_Carbon_Taxes_Are_Anti-Growth.pdf;
Accessed 7-2-2025\] HS 宋

First, as noted, a \$300 per ton CO2 tax would avert only 0.1°C of
global warming and one centimeter of sea-level rise by 2100, based on
EPA modeling. The tax would cause significant economic pain for no
discernible protection from sea-level rise.

Second, [adaptation can provide **substantial cost-effective
protection** from **sea-level rise**]{.underline}. However, [adaptation
is not free, and societies with stronger economies are more likely to
invest in adequate amounts of protection]{.underline}.

In his book False Alarm, Bjørn Lomborg provides a telling example of how
[adaptation can take the]{.underline} "[existential threat]{.underline}"
[out of sea-level rise]{.underline}. A 2014 study by European
researchers published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences includes [a **worst-case**]{.underline} RCP8.5 warming
[scenario in which sea levels rise six feet and flood]{.underline} up to
[350 million people]{.underline} every year by century's end, with costs
reaching \$100 trillion or 11 percent of global GDP annually.\[90\]
However, [those extraordinary damages are projected to occur only if
people do **nothing** more than maintain current sea walls.]{.underline}

If "enhanced" adaptive measures are taken, flood costs increase from
\$11 billion in 2000 to \$38 billion in 2100. Similarly, dike costs
increase from \$13 billion to \$48 billion. However, Lomborg notes,
"[the total cost to the economy will actually decline, from 0.05 percent
of GDP to 0.008 percent]{.underline}." Moreover, [the number of people
experiencing flood damages drops from 3.4 million in 2000 to
15,000]{.underline} in 2100---[a **99.6 percent**
reduction]{.underline}. In other words, [with adaptation investments
that keep pace with sea-level rise, people are projected to
be]{.underline} much safer, and the [global economy much less affected
by coastal flooding]{.underline} in 2100, [despite high-end
warming]{.underline}. \[91\]

#### Sea level rising claims are media [fearmongering]{.underline} and new tech solves.

**Watts 20** \[Anthony Watts; senior fellow for environment and climate
at The Heartland Institute; 5-11-2020; "Sorry, Alarmist Media, Sea Level
Won\'t Rise 4 Feet by 2100"; ClimateRealism;
https://climaterealism.com/2020/05/sorry-alarmist-media-sea-level-wont-rise-4-feet-by-2100/;
Accessed 7-2-2025\] HS 宋

[The news media today is breathlessly promoting a **ridiculous "study"**
claiming sea level will rise up to four feet by the year 2100. The study
and the many fawning media reports on the study are completely
ridiculous.]{.underline} With sea level currently rising at a pace of
approximately 1 foot per century, [sea level rise would have to --
immediately, starting today -- **quadruple** its pace and sustain that
quadrupled pace **without interruption** for all of the next 80 years.
That is simply preposterous.]{.underline}

To begin, here is how EcoWatch reports the study:

If nations fail to act, and current emissions lead to warming of 4.5
degrees, then sea levels are predicted to rise between 0.6 and 1.3
meters by 2100 and between 1.7 and 5.6 meters by 2300.

The predictions are based on a survey of 106 of the world's leading sea
level researchers, carried out by scientists from Nanyang Technological
University (NTU) and co-authored by researchers from the Potsdam
Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and published in the Nature
Partner Journal Climate and Atmospheric Science.

Key to the prediction is the assertion that many massive Antarctic ice
sheets will imminently collapse into the sea. Just last year, however,
scientists published research showing such a scenario is not likely to
happen anytime soon.

As pointed out by climate realists, and summarized by The Atlantic,
"\[collapse of\] ice cliffs might simply be a product of running a
computer model of ice physics at a too-low resolution."

[Then there's real-world data, reported in Climate at a Glance: Sea
Level Rise]{.underline}:

[Global sea level has been rising since at least the mid-1800s, and data
show there has been only **minor** recent acceleration.]{.underline}

NASA satellite instruments, with readings dating back to 1993, show
global sea level recently rising at a pace of merely 1.2 inches per
decade (1 foot per century).

[Human civilization successfully dealt with sea level rise utilizing
nineteenth and twentieth century technologies, and it will be able to
adapt to rising sea levels **even more successfully** in the coming
decades by utilizing twenty-first century technologies]{.underline}.

Global sea level has been rising at a relatively steady pace of
approximately one foot per century since at least the mid-1800s. [There
has been **no significant** recent acceleration. Yet the **media-hyped**
study claims sea-level rise will immediately quadruple and sustain that
pace for the rest of the century.]{.underline}

Not likely.

### No Impact\-\--Warming

#### No [existential]{.underline} climate impacts, [adaptation solves]{.underline}, AND [war]{.underline} turns it.

Hypothesized damaging consequences of global warming include (i) loss of
life from greater intensity and frequency of heat waves, hurricanes,
floods, droughts, and wildfires and (ii) economic losses from such
extreme-weather events and from sea-level rise due to melting polar ice
caps. [Assessments of the]{.underline} **[impact]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} **[human-caused warming]{.underline}** [are
complicated by]{.underline} the [difficulty of determining the extent to
which observed temperature increases are caused by]{.underline}
**[natural climate variability]{.underline}** -- [a difficulty that adds
to the]{.underline} **[uncertainty]{.underline}** [in estimates of how
much human-caused warming to expect]{.underline} over the 21st century.

*Warming over the past 120 years*

The question of whether global warming is dangerous (whatever its cause)
can be addressed by examining the behavior of the climate since before
the time human activity generated large amounts of greenhousegas
emissions. Human-caused global warming is typically measured with
reference to pre-industrial times; for practical reasons in terms of the
availability of data, the usual approach employs a baseline period in
the late 19th century. [Since the]{.underline} **[late 19th
century]{.underline}**, [Earth's average temperature has
increased]{.underline} by about 1.3o C (2.3o F). [During
the]{.underline} **[same]{.underline}** [period]{.underline}, average
global sea level has risen 8-9 inches, and [there has been]{.underline}
**[little or no detectable change]{.underline}** [in most types
of]{.underline} **[extreme weather]{.underline}** [events when measured
against the background of]{.underline} **[natural]{.underline}**
[weather and climate variability]{.underline}.

Since the late 19th century, with 1.3o C of global warming, [humanity
has seen]{.underline} **[unprecedented increases]{.underline}** [in
prosperity and well-being]{.underline}. **[Global
population]{.underline}** [has increased from]{.underline} about [1.6
billion]{.underline} in 1900 [to]{.underline} **[8.2
billion]{.underline}** [people]{.underline} in 2024. In 1900,
[the]{.underline} **[global average lifespan]{.underline}** [was 34
years; in]{.underline} **[2024]{.underline}** [the global average
lifespan]{.underline} **[more than doubled]{.underline}** to 73 years.
From 1961 to 2020, [global]{.underline} **[agricultural
output]{.underline}** [nearly quadrupled]{.underline}, with a 53%
increase in per capita output despite a 2.6-fold increase in global
population.

Since the early 1900s, [per capita mortality from]{.underline}
**[hurricanes]{.underline}**, **[floods]{.underline}**,
**[droughts]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[wildfires]{.underline}** [has decreased by]{.underline} **[almost
98%]{.underline}** (Koonin (2021, page 170)). These [favorable trends
in]{.underline} weather- and climate-related [mortality rates
reveal]{.underline} that [the world is now]{.underline} **[much
better]{.underline}** [at preventing deaths from extreme weather and
climate events than it was a century ago]{.underline}. The sharp
reduction in death rates has been accomplished through greater wealth
(driven by energy derived from fossil fuels), which provides
[better]{.underline} **[infrastructure]{.underline}**, superior
advance-warning **[technologies]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
greater **[capacity]{.underline}** [to recover from weather-related
disasters]{.underline}.

Although the role of higher temperatures and atmospheric CO2
concentrations in these favorable changes in mortality rates is open to
debate, two aspects of the increases are unambiguously beneficial.
First, **[sat]{.underline}**ellite [observations]{.underline} since the
1980s [indicate]{.underline} **[widespread greening]{.underline}** [of
the planet]{.underline}. The satellite data show that, over the last two
decades, [Earth has increased its green leaf area by]{.underline}
approximately **[5%]{.underline}**. This [greening reflects]{.underline}
**[increased]{.underline}** [CO2 fertilization, warmer temperatures, and
more rainfall]{.underline} (Chen et al. (2024)).

The [second aspect relates to]{.underline} **[heat]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[cold]{.underline}** [extremes]{.underline}. An
unambiguous consequence of global warming is more frequent heat
extremes, coupled with less frequent cold extremes. It is well known
that mortality is substantially greater (almost a factor of 10) for
extreme cold than for extreme heat (Zhao et al. (2021). Consequently,
[rising temperatures are associated with a]{.underline} ***[net saving
of lives]{.underline}*** [owing to the reduction of mortality from
extreme cold events]{.underline}. [Heat-related mortality
is]{.underline} also **[declining]{.underline}** [over time
(]{.underline}O'Neill et al. (2021)), [owing to]{.underline}
**[general]{.underline}** [improvements in]{.underline} **[health
care]{.underline}** systems, [increasing prevalence of]{.underline}
residential **[air conditioning]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[behavioral changes]{.underline}** -- [factors that have
dominated]{.underline} **[any impact of a warmer planet]{.underline}**
[on the risk of heat-related death]{.underline}.

Although the dollar value of damages from extreme weather events is now
greater than it was many decades ago, this increase is the result of
increasing vulnerability and exposure associated with greater population
and concentration of wealth in coastal and other disaster-prone regions.
A recent analysis summarizing many studies finds no evidence to support
claims that any part of the overall increase in global economic losses
from weather and climate disasters can be attributed to global warming
(Pielke (2020, 2023)).

*Prospective warming over the 21st century*

What about warming over the rest of the 21st century? Is there reason to
expect dire consequences for humanity going forward in time?

The Apocalyptic climate narrative and the [most extreme impacts are
driven by]{.underline} **[extreme]{.underline}** [emissions scenarios,
with]{.underline} **[4-5^o^ C]{.underline}** [of warming]{.underline} by
2100 (above a baseline in the late 19th century). However,
[since]{.underline} **[2021]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline}
**[UN]{.underline}**'s climate negotiators [have]{.underline}
**[abandoned]{.underline}** [extreme emissions scenarios as unrealistic
for two reasons]{.underline}. First, [they make]{.underline}
**[unrealistic assumptions]{.underline}**, [especially
about]{.underline} **[coal]{.underline}** [use]{.underline}. Second,
**[actual emissions]{.underline}** [have been tracking]{.underline}
**[well below]{.underline}** [their most extreme emission scenario, and
indeed slightly below their medium emissions scenario]{.underline}. The
**[UN]{.underline}** [is now working with an estimated]{.underline}
**[year 2100]{.underline}** [warming of **2.5°C**]{.underline} (UNFCCC
(2022)), [while the]{.underline} **[IEA]{.underline}** Roadmap to
NetZero [projects]{.underline} **[2.4°C]{.underline}** [of
warming]{.underline} by 2100 (IEA (2023)). [When plausible scenarios
of]{.underline} **[natural]{.underline}** climate
**[variability]{.underline}** [and values of]{.underline} **[climate
sensitivity]{.underline}** [on the lower end of the]{.underline} UN's
**[IPCC]{.underline}** likely **[range]{.underline}** [are considered,
the expected warming could be]{.underline}
**[significantly]{.underline}** [lower]{.underline} (Lee et al. (2021)).

If we work with 2.5°C projected warming by 2100, more than half (1.3°C)
of the predicted increase in temperature has already occurred. [There
are good reasons to expect]{.underline} **[continued
advances]{.underline}** [in prosperity and well-being over the remainder
of the 21st century -- and]{.underline} **[ample reasons]{.underline}**
such as AI to expect [such advances]{.underline} to
**[accelerate]{.underline}**. Moreover, [the]{.underline} so-called
[threshold of danger of]{.underline} **[2°C warming]{.underline}**
[since pre-industrial times is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [an
objective threshold of danger]{.underline}. [Rather]{.underline}, 2°C is
[a]{.underline} **[political]{.underline}**ly negotiated
**[target]{.underline}** [designed to motivate broad-based actions to
reduce emissions]{.underline} (Curry (2023, page 9)).

Importantly, [there is]{.underline} **[no credible case]{.underline}**
that [missing the]{.underline} **[2°C target]{.underline}** [would pose
an]{.underline} **[existential risk]{.underline}** [to
humanity]{.underline}. [Humans have]{.underline}
**[adapted]{.underline}** [to (and]{.underline}
**[thrived]{.underline}** [in) climates extremes far worse than in the
pessimistic extreme scenario]{.underline}, as summertime residents of
Phoenix and wintertime residents of Minneapolis demonstrate every year.

Two other risk-related points are relevant here. First, a basic
[assumption]{.underline} in the socioeconomic scenarios [used in
formulating]{.underline} the **[UN]{.underline}** climate-assessment
**[reports]{.underline}** [is that vulnerability to weather and climate
extremes]{.underline} **[decreases]{.underline}** with greater wealth
and economic development, [as]{.underline} **[adaptive
capacity]{.underline}** [increases]{.underline}. [All]{.underline} of
the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) **[scenarios]{.underline}**
[constructed for the most recent]{.underline} **[UN]{.underline}**
climate [assessment entail]{.underline} **[dramatic]{.underline}**
[growth]{.underline}, with global GDP in 2100 between four and ten times
larger than in 2010 (Dellink et al. (2017)). These
[scenarios]{.underline} **[do not imply]{.underline}** [any futures for
humanity that are worse than today]{.underline}.

Second, risks from human-caused global warming are difficult to separate
credibly from natural weather and climate variability and the risks are
dominated by the vulnerabilities of less-developed countries and poorer
populations generally. Increasing wealth and productivity will continue
to reduce humanity's vulnerability to weather- and climate-related
risks.

*Tipping points and surprises*

Uncertainty about the impact on humans of continued use of fossil fuels
is dominated by the difficulties of estimating the likelihood of
catastrophic outcomes from climate tipping points that could cause
severe and possibly irreversible damage.

Climate tipping points are defined as abrupt or nonlinear transitions to
a different climate state, which are hypothesized to occur once some
threshold has been crossed, with regional or global consequences that
are largely uncontrollable and beyond our management. In other words,
tipping points are points of no return, at least on the century
timescale. In recent geologic history, abrupt climate change has been
caused by changes in ocean circulation patterns and ice-sheet dynamics,
including (i) the Younger Dryas (12,900- 11,700 years ago) when global
temperatures dropped by up to 15o C in some regions, (ii) an unnamed
sudden cooling event that occurred around 8,200 years ago and that
lasted about 150 years, and (iii) the Dansgaard-Oeschger Events
(115,000-11,500 years ago) with a series of abrupt warmings and cooling
during the last Ice Age with temperature shifts of 5-10o C occurring
within decades.

The **[IPCC]{.underline}** Assessment **[Reports]{.underline}** [have
considered a number of potential]{.underline} **[tipping
points]{.underline}** [associated with global warming,
including]{.underline} **[ice]{.underline}**-sheet
**[collapse]{.underline}**, [collapse of the]{.underline}
**[A]{.underline}**tlantic **[O]{.underline}**verturning
**[C]{.underline}**irculation, [carbon release from]{.underline}
**[permafrost thawing]{.underline}**, [and destruction of
the]{.underline} **[Amazon]{.underline}** rainforest [and]{.underline}
**[coral reefs]{.underline}**. There are some preliminary climate model
simulations for some of these conjectured tipping points. However,
[climate models]{.underline} **[do not include]{.underline}** [the
appropriate physical, chemical, and biological processes to]{.underline}
**[adequately]{.underline}** [simulate such events]{.underline}. Hence,
[these hypothesized climate tipping points have been based largely
upon]{.underline} the [consideration of]{.underline} **[imperfect
analogues]{.underline}** [from the geologic past, process models, and
physically based storylines]{.underline}.

The [likelihood of]{.underline} **[any]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} above types of [hypothesized tipping points
occurring]{.underline} in the 21st century [under the]{.underline}
**[medium]{.underline}** [emissions scenario is generally regarded
as]{.underline} **[low]{.underline}**, although there is also low
confidence in any conclusions surrounding possible tipping points owing
to deep (Knightian) uncertainties in our understanding of the complex
climate system.

[Could something]{.underline} **[genuinely catastrophic]{.underline}**
[happen to the climate]{.underline} on the timescale of the 21st
century? **[Yes]{.underline}**, [although]{.underline} continued use of
**[fossil fuels]{.underline}** [is not the only possible
cause]{.underline}. For example, [a climate catastrophe
could]{.underline} also [be caused]{.underline} **[by nuclear
war]{.underline}**, a series of explosive volcanic eruptions, natural
shifts in ocean circulation patterns, and/or shifts in ice-sheet
dynamics driven by geologic processes.

It is impossible to remove all sources of climate-related risk, and it
would be unwise to attempt to try to avert low probability climate
catastrophes with policy actions that would themselves surely impose
massive near-term costs on humanity. There is no doubt that aggressive
near-term suppression of fossil-fuel use would impose significant costs
on humans until such time as viable replacements for fossil fuels were
found for the roles they play in the production of food, steel, cement,
and plastics.

The critical implication: [In terms of]{.underline} rational
**[risk]{.underline}** [management, there is]{.underline} **[no
case]{.underline}** [for policies that would suppress fossil-fuel use
aggressively simply because something bad]{.underline}
**[might]{.underline}** [happen]{.underline}. [For]{.underline} such
[suppression to be rational, we should have good reason to
think]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} **[low probability climate
catastrophe]{.underline}** we [would avoid would be far worse than the
catastrophe we would]{.underline} surely [induce by moving]{.underline}
**[aggressively]{.underline}** [to net zero]{.underline}. We have [yet
to see anyone provide]{.underline} **[credible support]{.underline}**
[for the latter argument]{.underline}.

Roger A. **Pielke 24**, Nonresident Senior Fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute and a professor in the College of Arts and Sciences
at the University of Colorado Boulder, 11/13/24, "Global Existential
Risks," https://rogerpielkejr.substack.com/p/global-existential-risks

[In 2022]{.underline}, on a bipartisan basis, the U.S. [Congress passed
the **G**lobal **C**atastrophic **R**isk **M**anagement
**A**ct]{.underline} of 2022 [requiring]{.underline} the [**D**epartment
of **H**omeland **S**ecurity to coordinate an expert assessment of
global catastrophic and existential risks]{.underline}. The Department
of Homeland Security published [the first Global Catastrophic Risk
Assessment]{.underline} two weeks ago, and [reached some important ---
and one surprising --- conclusions]{.underline}.1

The legislation provided key definitions:

The term ''[existential risk'' means]{.underline} the [potential for an
outcome that would result in human extinction]{.underline}.

The term ''global catastrophic risk'' means the risk of events or
incidents consequential enough to significantly harm or set back human
civilization

at the global scale.

The term ''global catastrophic and existential threats'' means threats
that with varying likelihood may produce consequences severe enough to
result in systemic failure or destruction of critical infrastructure or
significant harm to human civilization.

Congress requested that the assessment focus on six areas of risk:2

the use and development of artificial intelligence (AI);

asteroid and comet impacts;

sudden and severe changes to Earth's climate;

nuclear war;

severe pandemics, whether resulting from naturally occurring events or
from synthetic biology;

supervolcanoes;

Using the key definitions across these six categories, the table below
summarizes my reading of the report.

The report is well done, and each of the six risk areas are worth their
own focused post here at THB.3 In the remainder of this post, I
highlight what the report says about **[climate change]{.underline}**
--- which [the report does **not** identify as an existential
risk]{.underline}.

The assessment recognizes that [changes in climate have many significant
consequences for people and ecosystems, but]{.underline} the
[**corresponding risks are local and regional**, not
global]{.underline}:

"An important dynamic of climate change effects is that [any one
mechanism by which climate change creates risk]{.underline}, such as
those listed above, [although potentially devastating on a local to
regional scale, might not rise to the level of a global catastrophe or
an existential risk]{.underline}."4

The report acknowledges diplomatically that [activists often
**characterize** climate change as an existential risk, which reflects
"subjective values and worldviews" rather than scientific judgments of
real-world risks]{.underline}:5

"A [strong, international activist movement now exists that engages in
advocacy for addressing climate change. That movement
emphasizes]{.underline} the [urgency]{.underline} of climate change;
sponsors civic engagement efforts, including protest and civil
disobedience, particularly among youths around the globe; [and
argues]{.underline} that [climate change is a potential existential
risk]{.underline}. . . although [social movements]{.underline} reflect a
genuine and legitimate concern about climate change's potential risks to
society, they [are not necessarily grounded in **objective assessment**
of those risks]{.underline}."

The [report **acknowledges**]{.underline} some of the [**extreme
claims** found in the scientific literature from those in the
**catastrophist planetary boundaries community**]{.underline} as well as
some of the outlier work in climate econometrics. However, [the
assessment]{.underline} largely [**rejects these outliers** and is very
clear in its conclusion that climate change does not present a
catastrophic health risk]{.underline} --- **[even over the course of a
century]{.underline}**:

"Although there is no accepted determination of what would constitute a
global catastrophic health risk from climate change, authors of at least
one report defined it as a mass-mortality event taking the equivalent of
25 percent of the population. For the United States, based on the 2020
population (330 million), percent would mean approximately 80 million
people, or 2 billion for the estimated global population in 2022 of 8
billion. . . Mortality of this magnitude would effectively be ten times
that of the 1918 influenza pandemic. These values suggest a very high
bar for catastrophic risk. . . [**No published study** has suggested the
possibility of a singular mass-mortality event]{.underline} of this
magnitude, [nor is there evidence of an **indirect mechanism**, such as
collapse of global food supplies or climate-mediated pathogenesis, that
would result in such high rates of mortality]{.underline}. Even with
cumulative losses over a century, mortality would not meet these
thresholds."

The **[bottom line]{.underline}**: Climate change is important and poses
significant risks that will require continued policy development and
implementation in mitigation and adaptation --- but [**climate change is
not an existential risk**. The world does indeed face existential risks
and we should take care that concern over climate does not overshadow
these other risks]{.underline}.

Last night I had the chance to give a talk to a wonderful group of
thoughtful and informed normal folks in downtown Denver. After the event
a women came up to me and asked if I was afraid of climate change. I
responded that I was not, for the simple reason that despite the very
real risks of changes in climate, we are focused on those risks. I told
her that I worry much more about the things that we are not paying
attention to, noting that the COVID-19 pandemic arose following a long
period where there was little attention or concern about pandemics among
most scientists or policy makers.

In a paper I wrote almost a decade ago, I warned that the catastrophes
of the 21st century may --- like COVID-19 --- come from places not at
the center of our attention:

I suggest three types of catastrophes lie ahead. The familiar -- hazards
that we have come to expect based on experience and knowledge, such as
earthquakes and typhoons. The emergent -- hazards that are the product
of a complex, interconnected world, such as financial meltdowns, supply
chain disruption and epidemics. The extraordinary \-- hazards that may
or may not be foreseen or foreseeable, but for which we are wholly
unprepared, such as an asteroid impact, massive solar storm, or even
fantastic scenarios found only in fiction, such as the consequences of
contact with alien life. I will argue that our collective attention and
expertise is, perhaps understandably, disproportionately focused on the
familiar. The consequence, however, is a sort of intellectual myopia. We
know more than we think about the familiar and less than we should about
the emergent and the extraordinary. Yet our ability to deal with the
hazards of the future likely depends much more on our ability to prepare
for the emergent and the extraordinary.

The [first Global Catastrophic Risk assessment by the U.S. government is
an excellent starting point for a continuing discussion about
catastrophic risks]{.underline} and how we might better prepare for
them. It tells us that [where our focus lies may not be where we find
the greatest risks]{.underline}.

Another perspective on definitions of rapid and extreme climate change
are those global warming thresholds policymakers agree represent
critical thresholds. For example, the international policy community has
long used the concept of DAI as a benchmark for guiding efforts to
reduce GHG emissions. That benchmark is grounded, but not defined, in
Article 2 of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC). International scientific assessments have concluded
that an increase in global mean temperature of more than 1.5 to 2.0°C
(2.7 to 3.6°F) relative to preindustrial temperatures is the threshold
for dangerous climate change. Hence, the 2015 Paris Agreement commits
countries to limiting warming to well below 2°C and to aiming for 1.5°C.
Warming beyond this threshold is assumed to result in large and
widespread consequences for the Earth system.20 Therefore,
[exceeding]{.underline} **[1.5°C]{.underline}** [is often used as
a]{.underline} **[proxy]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} global
catastrophic or even **[existential]{.underline}** [risk]{.underline}.
However, [there is]{.underline} **[significant
uncertainty]{.underline}** about [how]{.underline} such magnitudes of
[warming would result in]{.underline} catastrophic or **[existential
risk]{.underline}** [to humanity]{.underline}.21 The
**[IPCC]{.underline}**'s special [report]{.underline}, *Global Warming
of 1.5°C*, for example, **[does not]{.underline}** [identify climate
change as an existential risk to humanity]{.underline}.22 Similarly, in
the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report, such [terms as]{.underline}
***[existential]{.underline}*** [and]{.underline} ***[catastrophic
risk]{.underline}*** [are used in the context of]{.underline}
**[specific]{.underline}** [geographies, such as small island states, or
vulnerable species or populations]{.underline}.23

A third perspective on catastrophic climate risk comes from a broader
civil discourse that reflects the public's concerns about the potential
implications of climate change. For example, U.S. polling data suggest
that people in the United States are increasingly concerned about
climate change and supportive of more aggressive actions to reduce the
risk.24 A strong, international activist movement now exists that
engages in advocacy for addressing climate change. That movement
emphasizes the urgency of climate change; sponsors civic engagement
efforts, including protest and civil disobedience, particularly among
youths around the globe;25 and argues that climate change is a potential
existential risk. Social movements emerge from awareness of the science
of climate change and the current state of progress on reducing climate
risk. However, the bases for such social movements are also grounded in
moral and ethical arguments and reflect the subjective values and
worldviews of those who participate.26 Therefore, although social
movements reflect a genuine and legitimate concern about climate
change's potential risks to society, they are not necessarily grounded
in objective assessment of those risks.

Probabilities of Rapid and Severe Climate Change

What would be required for such large-scale effects to be realized, and
how likely are those conditions to develop? [The]{.underline} **[latest
projections]{.underline}** [of future climate change are based on a set
of emission scenarios that result in]{.underline}
**[different]{.underline}** [levels]{.underline} of radiative forcing.
Those scenarios imply different economic development and technology
pathways, as well as different levels of global investment in
GHG-emission reductions. Those projections suggest that the world is not
on track to limit warming to less than 2.0°C, much less 1.5°C. That
level of warming is likely to be realized as early as the 2030s.27
Despite the focus on 1.5 to 2.0°C as a key global warming threshold,
greater magnitudes of global warming are possible and, given the current
state of emission reductions, even probable (Table 7.2).

[Some scenarios project warming of]{.underline} up to
**[2.5°C]{.underline}** (4.5°F) by 2050 [and]{.underline} **[4 to
5°C]{.underline}** (7.2 to 9.0°F) by 2100.28 These [increases
imply]{.underline} much **[larger]{.underline}** [effects]{.underline},
including up to 1 m (39 inches) of sea-level rise by 2100. Nevertheless,
[even at]{.underline} these **[more-extreme magnitudes]{.underline}**
[of climate change, it is]{.underline} **[not clear]{.underline}** that
**[these constitute]{.underline}** global catastrophic or **[existential
risks]{.underline}**. At present, [global GHG emissions are tracking
along a trajectory that would imply warming]{.underline} on the order
[of]{.underline} **[2 to 3°C]{.underline}** by 2100, [making
such]{.underline} **[worst-case]{.underline}** [scenarios]{.underline}
**[unlikely]{.underline}**, particularly by 2050.29

Any one or any combination of four developments would have to transpire
to drive greater magnitudes of climate change in the 21st century
(Table 7.3). First, a resurgence in GHG emissions would have to reverse
progress made in the past decade, particularly in wealthy countries.
Specifically, this could involve expanded use of coal, which has seen a
significant contraction in North America and Europe, combined with
continued exploitation of natural gas resources. This would cause
emissions to accelerate in the next few decades.

NOTE: [Probabilities represent the]{.underline}
**[likelihood]{.underline}** [of future global mean temperature
change]{.underline} in the 21st century [being]{.underline} **[within
each range]{.underline}** [based on]{.underline}
**[current]{.underline}** [climate mitigation policies and
commitments]{.underline} under the Paris Agreement. More-ambitious
actions to reduce emissions could significantly shift the probability
distribution toward fewer degrees of change.

\[Table omitted\]

Second, [the climate would have to be]{.underline} **[more
sensitive]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} GHG [emissions
than]{.underline} **[currently]{.underline}** [estimated from models and
observations]{.underline}. Climate sensitivity is often expressed as the
magnitude of global warming that would be realized from a doubling of
the preindustrial atmospheric concentration of GHGs. The best estimate
of climate sensitivity is 3.0°C.30 However, [there is a]{.underline}
**[wide range of uncertainty]{.underline}** [around this]{.underline}
estimate, [resulting in a long tail of potential
sensitivity]{.underline} that goes higher than 5°C. That higher
sensitivity could contribute to large magnitudes of climate change even
for more-modest emissions.

Third, social, ecological, and economic thresholds would have to be
exceeded despite the efforts to manage and adapt to climate change. An
inability for agricultural production to be managed in the face of high
rates of climate change, insufficient freshwater resources to meet human
demand despite conservation efforts, and rates of sea-level rise greater
than humans can retreat from the coastline would all be examples of
potential limits to adaptation.31

Fourth, although some of the direct effects of climate change can be
readily anticipated based on understanding of projected magnitudes of
climate change and systems' sensitivity to those changes, many effects
can be difficult to predict or even anticipate. In particular, climate
change has the potential to cause consequences that arise indirectly
through cascading effects that propagate among sectors or communities.32
For example, much of the concern about climate change's contributions to
national security challenges or conflict arise from the cascading
effects of drought, disasters, and other climate-related effects on
human security, migration, and resource scarcity.33 Similarly, the
degradation and loss of ecosystems and related services (including
agriculture, fisheries, and forestry) can destabilize communities and
entire regions.34 In addition to such indirect consequences, the
compounded hazard of multiple effects occurring simultaneously can yield
greater damage than a single effect in isolation.35 Compounded hazard
can undermine the ability to manage risk, thereby increasing the
likelihood adverse effects. Collectively, cascading and compounded
hazards act to increase the risk of catastrophic outcomes. However,
their complexity makes them difficult to predict or for anyone to assign
likelihood to potential outcomes. Hence, although cascading and
compounded hazards could pose global catastrophic or existential risk, a
lack of understanding of the pathways by which such consequences would
arise contributes to significantly more uncertainty than when assessing
the moredirect and -discrete effects of climate change.

In addition to the likelihoods of exceeding global average temperature
thresholds, the likelihood of catastrophic climate change is also
informed by the probabilities of exceeding specific thresholds for key
risks (see Table 7.4 for examples). For example, irreversible melting of
the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheet would reshape coastlines around the
world, permanently inundating existing population centers where economic
activity is concentrated. The simultaneous loss of multiple breadbasket
regions that produce much of the world's staple crops could
significantly undermine global food security, particularly if those
effects were sustained over multiple years. Existing literature is
consistent in reporting the plausibility of such scenarios but reflects
significant uncertainty about their likelihoods.36 This uncertainty is
attributed to multiple sources, including the method of probability
assessment (e.g., biological or physical modeling versus expert
elicitation), estimates of the sensitivity of key risks to global
warming, and the use of different climate scenarios to estimate effects.
However, Table 7.4 also indicates that the probabilities of exceeding
thresholds for key risks are relatively high. In almost every example in
Table 7.4, the low end of the probability range is greater than
1 percent; in most cases, the upper end of the probability range exceeds
50 percent, particularly for large magnitudes of warming and long time
horizons.

\[Table omitted\]

Probabilities have generally increased, rather than decreased, in
response to scientific advances over time. Although some of these
outcomes (e.g., melting of ice sheets) have direct implications for
global catastrophic risk, the consequences of other key risks (e.g.,
shifts in patterns of ocean circulation, such as ENSO) are less certain
because their consequences would manifest indirectly through effects on
other systems.

What Is the Risk from Rapid and Severe Climate Change?

Consequences: Mortality

An [extensive body of literature]{.underline} has [documented
the]{.underline} **[observed effects]{.underline}** [that climate
variability and change have]{.underline} on human health [and includes
projections of]{.underline} **[future]{.underline}** health
**[consequences]{.underline}** [of a changing climate]{.underline} under
different global warming scenarios. The first of these papers emerged in
the late 1980s and warned of catastrophic and existential risks.37 These
risks generally arise from direct pathways, such as exposure to extreme
weather events, including extreme heat, flooding, and severe storms.
However, climate change also indirectly affects human health through,
for example, changes in the geography of disease vectors, effects on
food and water security, or weather-related accidents.38 [Although
the]{.underline} **[risks]{.underline}** [of climate change
to]{.underline} **[human health]{.underline}** [are often cited as part
of the climate emergency]{.underline}, **[rates]{.underline}** [of human
injury and death]{.underline} associated with extreme weather events
[have generally]{.underline} **[gone down]{.underline}** [over
time]{.underline}.39

Overall, [society's capacity to]{.underline} **[cope with
threats]{.underline}** to health [is anticipated to continue to rise,
particularly within]{.underline} **[vulnerable]{.underline}**
[countries]{.underline}, provided sufficient investments are made in
adaptation, resilience, and economic development. Nevertheless, health
modeling suggests that climate change will contribute to increases in
mortality in the years ahead. One of the first global estimates of the
health effects of climate change came from WHO in 2014. The authors
estimated an additional 250,000  excess deaths per year by midcentury
caused by climate change.40 More-recent projections, also by WHO,
suggest climate change--related deaths of 529,000 per year by 2050, with
an upper confidence limit of 736,000.41 These mortality effects and
broader health effects of climate change could also contribute to
reductions in life expectancy.42

What is clear is that heat waves are the leading cause of
weather-related mortality in the United States, with past heat waves
associated with significant excess deaths and mass-casualty events. As a
result, increases in the heat-related death rate are projected to
outweigh decreases in cold-related deaths, particularly in response to a
high-emission scenario.43 Recent studies suggest that, if the global
mean temperature increase reaches 4°C, large regions of the world could
become uninhabitable because of heat stress unless significant
adaptations are made.44

Although there is no accepted determination of what would constitute a
global catastrophic health risk from climate change, authors of at least
one report defined it as a mass-mortality event taking the equivalent of
25 percent of the population.45 For the United States, based on the 2020
population (330 million), 25 percent would mean approximately 80 million
people, or 2 billion for the estimated global population in 2022 of
8 billion.46 The thresholds would be higher if one accounted for future
population growth, estimated to be almost 370 million in the United
States and 9.7 billion globally by 2050.47 Mortality of this magnitude
would effectively be ten times that of the 1918 influenza pandemic.48
These [values suggest a]{.underline} very **[high bar]{.underline}**
[for catastrophic risk]{.underline}. However, by comparison, in 2019, an
estimated 14 million people globally died from infectious diseases
alone.49 This [baseline mortality is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}**
generally [considered catastrophic, despite much of that mortality being
preventable]{.underline}. **[No published study]{.underline}** has
[suggested the possibility of a]{.underline} singular
**[mass-mortality]{.underline}** [event]{.underline} of this magnitude,
[nor is there evidence of an]{.underline} **[indirect
mechanism]{.underline}**, such as collapse of global food supplies or
climate-mediated pathogenesis, [that would result in]{.underline} such
**[high rates]{.underline}** [of mortality]{.underline}. [Even
with]{.underline} **[cumulative losses]{.underline}** over a century,
[mortality would]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [meet these
thresholds]{.underline}.

Consequences: Ecosystem Instability

The degradation and loss of global ecosystems is a major effect
associated with climate change. Significant changes have already been
observed in the structure, function, and geographic distribution of
plant and animal species around the world.50 Changes in temperature and
precipitation will expose existing ecosystems to climatic conditions
that are significantly different from those in which the system
evolved.51 For ocean ecosystems, ocean acidification caused by rising
atmospheric concentrations of CO2 poses an additional threat.52 Key
ecosystems at risk include the Amazon River basin, which is at risk of
conversion from tropical rainforest to grassland, the Arctic tundra, and
coral reefs around the world (Table 7.5).53 These ecosystem losses
reflect a broader concern about mass extinction and loss of
biodiversity.54 The risks become particularly high beyond 2.0°C.55

Ecosystem disruption can have significant downstream consequences for
valuable services on which people depend, including agricultural and
forestry products, water resources, nutrient cycling, and cultural
values. Climate change's effects on these services are difficult to
predict but are an important consideration in the assessment of
catastrophic risk.56 For example, 99 percent of coral reefs are
projected to be lost if cli mate change exceeds 1.5°C.57 Although the
loss of coral reefs is not a direct catastrophic risk to humans, the
indirect dependence that specific communities and local economies have
on coral reefs for livelihoods could result in significant damage.
Similarly, the eastern Bering Sea snow crab population declined abruptly
by more than 10 billion in three years, from 2018 to 2021.58 Scientists
found that the snow crab population crash was a result of starvation
caused by a series of marine heat waves in the preceding years, which
increased the species' caloric requirements. This, in combination with a
historically high abundance of crab and a restricted range, created
competition for a limited food source and ultimately led to this
high-mortality event. The fishery, valued at roughly \$150 million
annually, was closed for the 2022 season---a devastating economic effect
on the local, largely indigenous community, which relies heavily on
landing taxes from the fishery. In two years, the community's tax
revenues declined from approximately \$2.5 million to around
\$200,000.59

Consequences: Societal Instability

An extensive literature documents climate change's risks to physical
infrastructure, as well as the broader economy. Recent economic studies
suggest that climate change has already resulted in significant economic
losses. For example, the emissions attributed to global oil production
between 1988 and 2015 alone are estimated to have already caused
\$50 billion to \$200 billion in cumulative global economic damage by
2020.60 A recent comparison of dozens of studies of the macroeconomic
effects of climate change used global welfare as a common metric of
economic effect. In other words, they studied the relative change in
household income in response to a change in global average temperature
(Figure 7.2).61 These studies reflect the anticipated exponential growth
in risk in response to greater magnitudes of climate change but suggest
that effects are modest (less than a 10-percent reduction in household
income) for warming up to 5°C, and only a few estimates are available
for warming above 5°C.

Similarly, projections of future climate change--related effects on GDP
vary because of differences in methods. Most suggest GDP decreases in
the United States and globally on the order of 1 to 2 percent by 2100.62
Given economic growth, global GDP will be on the order of \$400 trillion
by that time,63 which translates into \$4 trillion to \$8 trillion per
year in 2100 in damage. Although substantial in absolute terms, this is
equivalent to only a few years of future GDP growth, so the world's GDP
would still be 3.5 times higher than it was in 2023, despite these
economic effects.

Nevertheless, recent years have seen several studies producing
more-pessimistic projections of future GDP effects, which is a function
of attempts to capture a broader array of consequences and learning
about the sensitivity that human and natural systems have to climate.
For example, researchers in some recent eco nomic studies have projected
effects on the order of 10 to 20 percent of GDP in 2100, and some have
suggested effects of more than 50 percent of GDP.64 These estimates are
an order of magnitude higher than traditional assumptions, suggesting
effects of \$40 trillion per year by the end of the century. Effects of
this scale imply weak economic growth (averaging less than 1 percent per
year) for the remainder of the 21st century and a large social cost of
climate change. Such weak growth while the population of the world is
rising suggests negative effects on poverty, consumption, and quality of
life. For example, although the implied scale of GDP by the end of the
century is higher than that of 2023, given a population of approximately
10 billion as soon as 2050,65 GDP per capita could be lower than it is
today. These global effects would be disproportionately larger in
low-income and vulnerable countries. For example, some studies suggest
effects on the order of 33 percent of developing-nation GDP, even if
warming is limited to 1.5°C, and as high as 64 percent for 2 to 3°C of
warming.66 The status of economic development is highly correlated with
state fragility, as well as a country's contributions to global GHG
emissions.

A significant fraction of the economic damage associated with climate
change is effects on infrastructure and the built
environment---including direct damage to infrastructure from extreme
weather events, which drives repair, replacement, and maintenance, as
well as associated loss-of-use costs associated with infrastructure
degradation. This damage to infrastructure affects such factors as the
costs and reliability of travel, water and power, and access to other
services. In some instances, these costs will be transient (e.g., storm
damage to a physical asset), but they can also be persistent because of
repetitive events or the permanent loss of an asset or opportunity
(because, for instance, of sea-level rise and permanent inundation of an
asset). Key risks would be associated with the loss of natural resources
needed to support an infrastructure service (e.g., decline of water
resources), effects on long-lived infrastructure that was designed or
sited during a different climate era, and infrastructure that is poorly
designed and hardened against climate and weather and is therefore
particularly vulnerable to failure. Until recently, most infrastructure
systems were designed to withstand historical climate variability and
not designed to account for future climate change. However, public- and
private-sector actors are taking action to shift infrastructure design
practices to account for future climate change and to include additional
safety factors to hedge against uncertainty. In addition, most physical
infrastructure is highly distributed and even decentralized, making it
difficult for climate change effects to scale to a global catastrophe.

Climate change effects on the built environment could be accompanied by
effects on governance systems and social institutions. Such erosion of
institutions could arise from multiple sources. One of the mostimmediate
challenges is the instability arising from climate change effects or
countries' responses to those effects. For example, the projections of
economic costs of climate change effects suggest the potential for
significant slowing of future economic growth. This translates into both
public and private institutions' ability to maintain budgets to invest
in public and private goods and services.67 Moreover, global efforts to
mitigate climate change effects through energy transitions could have
additional effects in resource-dependent economies that rely on fossil
fuel revenue for economic stability. For example, a synthesis of
modeling studies indicates that aggressive reductions in GHG emissions
to manage climate risk could also slow global economic growth and
countries' ability to address other social and economic challenges.68

Various experts have argued that measures of climate change's direct
effects on the economy underestimate the broader downstream consequences
for human society and the natural environment.69 For example, social
unrest could arise from civil society's concerns about the risks of
climate change and the ability of governments and other institutions to
adequately manage those risks. In many countries, climate change is now
a mainstream policy issue and, as a result, a litmus test for
policymakers. Responses to climate change shape political platforms and
campaigns, as well as the leadership of corporations, raising the
possibility of climate change being one element of a justification for
regime change.70 Hence, a civil protest movement is growing around
climate change that is using civil disobedience as a mechanism for
driving more-aggressive climate policies.71 This is likely to be more
significant in places where institutions are unable to provide people
with necessities, such as food, water, and energy security. These tend
to be low-income countries that are already fragile.72 At the same time,
many countries' efforts to advance climate actions to reduce the risks
of climate change have encountered public backlash. For example, public
protests in France, Italy, Argentina, and Germany have occurred in
response to increased costs of transportation, food, and energy, as well
as the retirement of fossil fuel assets and industry.73

Another potentially destabilizing force on global institutions is the
increasing use of the courts as a vehicle for shaping climate action.
One report indicates that the magnitude of climate litigation doubled
between 2017 and 2023, with such costs now distributed across
55 countries.74 This could include proregulatory litigation against
governments or the private sector for not taking sufficient action on
climate change or antiregulatory litigation for actions that are deemed
too costly or have negative effects on individual freedoms and civil
rights.75

Although this discussion identifies various pathways by which climate
change could undermine societal stability, understanding of how such
effects would translate into broader fragility or collapse of
nation-states remains quite limited. Thresholds for these societal
systems, such as the point at which failure for a government to satisfy
societal needs results in collapse of the government, are largely
unknown and likely only partially influenced by changes in the climate
system.

Consequences: Reduced Human Capabilities

Climate change has been named as one of the greatest threats to human
health in the 21st century.76 It is already undermining key social
determinants of human physical and psychological well-being, such as
access to basic needs (e.g., food, water, stable housing) and social
support institutions (e.g., health care), human security and freedom,
and health equity. The direct and indirect physical and mental effects
of natural disasters are well documented in the literature dating back
to at least the 1980s.77 Examples of direct effects include illness,
injury, or death resulting from extreme weather events, as well as other
effects, such as reduced work productivity. Indirectly, changes to
environmental conditions and extreme weather events can lead to poor air
quality (e.g., wildfire smoke) and respiratory illness; waterborne
diseases and other waterrelated health effects; zoonoses, vector-borne
diseases, malnutrition, and foodborne diseases; noncommunicable
diseases; and mental and psychosocial health.78

Although evidence unequivocally shows that climate change affects human
health, accurately measuring the scale and magnitude of these effects is
challenging. Individual and community vulnerability and the ability to
adapt to a changing environment are at the heart of this dilemma.
Moreover, understanding how these effects on health outcomes affect
well-being is equally challenging because the term *well-being* is used
to describe a diverse, and sometimes contradictory, set of
concepts---what constitutes an effect on well-being could differ by
culture and context.79 Direct elements of well-being, such as access to
basic needs (e.g., food, water, and stable housing), are easier to
measure than indirect elements, such as the symbolic or cultural
components of identity.

Nevertheless, identifying and measuring climate change's effect on
quality of life or well-being is a growing area of research. Discussions
in the literature center on a few concepts, including effects on the
pillars of living standards that undermine acceptable levels of
well-being, implications for human security and freedom, and climate
anxiety and effects on mental health.80 The concepts of human security
and freedom are a broad framing that arguably encompasses the other two
concepts. Effects on living standards that undermine well-being are
discussed in literature that has examined the links between climate
change and higher costs of living, including effects on agriculture and
related food shortages, infrastructure damage and supply chain
disruptions, and the implications of slower economic growth.81

Most of the research on climate change and mental health has been
conducted in high-income countries, which has implications for
generalizability across global populations. However, the evidence
strongly suggests a negative association between climate-related
exposure and mental health, including posttraumatic stress disorder,
anxiety, depression, psychiatric hospitalizations, and increased suicide
rates.82 There is also a small but growing body of literature on climate
change's effects on indigenous populations' mental health, particularly
from the perspective of sense of place and identity.83 There is evidence
to suggest that these populations are among those who are most acutely
experiencing effects on mental health from climate change.84 Culturally,
many indigenous communities define themselves by their environments. In
this sense, climate change could pose an existential threat to these
populations if their environments become uninhabitable or traditional
ways of life are no longer viable.

The geographic extent and duration of the effect on human well-being
depend on the nature of the climate stressor and the dimension of
well-being of concern. Additionally, because several drivers of good
health and well-being interact with one another, effects could cascade
and compound among these drivers, extending the acute effects of a
precipitating event much longer than expected. With extreme weather,
some effects on human health and well-being, such as acute stress and
posttraumatic stress disorder, can be felt immediately during or after
the event but can also be felt for years after the event. Researchers in
one study found that stress, anxiety, and fear persisted for at least
three years after a flood event.85 In the longer term, depression and
suicidal ideation can develop.86 For slower-moving climate stressors,
such as sea-level rise, for which the full extent of the physical
effects might not be felt for years, anxiety associated with the
awareness of climate change and the perception of risk might serve as a
proxy for understanding these stressors' implications for mental
health.87

Evidence shows that geographically vulnerable and socially disadvantaged
populations disproportionately experience effects on human health and
well-being stemming from climate change and that other risk factors,
including socioeconomic status, gender, and existing conditions, play a
key role.88 Because climate change acts as a multiplier on individuals'
and communities' existing conditions, one can expect to see these trends
continue without intervention. Individuals' and communities' ability to
cope with the mental health effects of climate change is uncertain. Very
few empirical studies have examined these coping mechanisms or the
efficacy and scalability of interventions and policies aimed at
addressing mental health effects.89

How the Risk from Extreme Climate Change Will Change in the Next Decade

The [scientific literature is]{.underline} **[quite clear]{.underline}**
that [the risks associated with extreme climate change will]{.underline}
**[continue]{.underline}** [to grow]{.underline} for at least the first
half of the 21st century, **[independently]{.underline}** [of efforts
made to]{.underline} **[reduce]{.underline}** [global GHG
emissions]{.underline}. This is [due to a certain magnitude
of]{.underline} **[lock-in]{.underline}** [in terms of future GHG
emissions, as well as]{.underline} **[time lags]{.underline}** [between
emissions and associated changes]{.underline} in the climate system.
Because CO2 can remain in the atmosphere for thousands of years,
**[past]{.underline}** [GHG emissions]{.underline} have **[committed
Earth]{.underline}** [to some degree of future warming]{.underline}. If
emissions were to cease, the global temperature would quickly
stabilize.90 However, [emissions would take]{.underline}
**[decades]{.underline}** [to return to]{.underline} their
[preindustrial levels]{.underline}. Meanwhile, some elements of the
climate system, such as ice sheets, sea levels, or the temperatures of
the deep ocean, would respond much more slowly.91 Therefore, the
consequences of climate change are anticipated to become more severe in
the next decade, and studies suggest that the rates of global mean
temperature change and sea-level rise are accelerating.92

Nevertheless, [even under the]{.underline} **[most-extreme
scenarios]{.underline}** [of climate change, large-scale temperature
shifts in the Earth system are]{.underline} **[not
anticipated]{.underline}** until toward the end of the 21st century.
This [suggests a]{.underline} **[low probability]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} global catastrophic or **[existential
risk]{.underline}** in the next decade. [Projected
trajectories]{.underline} of warming by 2050 [are]{.underline}
relatively **[similar]{.underline}** [among quite disparate assumptions
about]{.underline} **[rates]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} GHG
[emissions and]{.underline} **[feedback loops]{.underline}**, [resulting
in warming on the order of]{.underline} **[2 to 3°C]{.underline}** by
midcentury [given current progress]{.underline} on GHG-emission
reductions. Nevertheless, [that level of warming]{.underline}
**[exceeds]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} commonly used DAI threshold
of 1.5 to 2.0°C, as well as [thresholds for various]{.underline} **[key
risks]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[tipping points]{.underline}**
in the Earth system (Table 7.4). As a result, [there is a]{.underline}
**[moderate]{.underline}** to high [probability of]{.underline}
catastrophic or [existential risk during that time on a]{.underline}
**[local to regional]{.underline}** [basis for some particularly
vulnerable populations or communities]{.underline}. [Projections
of]{.underline} **[truly]{.underline}** catastrophic global or
**[existential]{.underline}** [risks]{.underline} by 2050 [are unlikely,
according to existing studies]{.underline}. That said, some scientists
are warning that warming of 2 to 3°C by midcentury could commit the
world to catastrophic risks later in the century because of such
warming's implications for positive feedback, such as ice-sheet melting,
and release of additional GHGs from the thawing of Arctic permafrost
(Table 7.4).93 Also, climate change could trigger other types of risk.
For example, the thawing of permafrost and melting of glaciers could
expose human populations to novel pathogens, suggesting a pathway for
pandemic risk (see Chapter 6).94 Therefore, even if climate conditions
in 2050 were not consistent with humans experiencing a global
catastrophic or existential risk, the conditions could place the Earth
system on such a pathway, directly or indirectly.

Much of the more-severe outcomes of climate change would manifest toward
the end of the 21st century. [Uncertainty in climate]{.underline}
**[policy]{.underline}** [and future]{.underline} GHG
**[emissions]{.underline}** [create]{.underline} large [uncertainty in
projections of climate change]{.underline} and sea-level rise by 2100
and beyond, [including]{.underline} global warming more than 4 to 5°C
under **[high-emission]{.underline}** [scenarios]{.underline}. Although
[such scenarios appear]{.underline} **[increasingly
unlikely]{.underline}**, the scientific community has failed to reach
consensus on their plausibility. Warming of this magnitude would
likelier than not trigger most of the Earth-system key risks listed in
Table 7.4. However, there are large uncertainties associated with the
downstream consequences of such key risks for human society and
well-being.

[Recent studies]{.underline}, from a variety of research groups and a
variety of methods, now [suggest]{.underline} that [the world is on a
path that would cause between]{.underline} **[2ºC]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[3ºC]{.underline}** [of warming]{.underline},
assuming mid-range climate sensitivity to emissions (more on this
below). Constant emissions from 2019 to 2100 would produce approximately
3ºC of warming by 2100,19 current policies would produce 2.6--2.9ºC of
warming by 210020 (similar to RCP4.5 or SSP2- 4.5),
[pathways]{.underline} consistent with stated policies [would
produce]{.underline} **[approximately 2.2ºC]{.underline}** [of warming
by]{.underline} **[210021]{.underline}** (similar to SSP2-3.4), and
countries meeting their pledges and targets produce pathways consistent
with limiting warming by 2100 to 2ºC or slightly less22 (similar to
RCP2.6 or SSP1-2.6). [Modeling studies]{.underline}
**[simulating]{.underline}** [continued changes in the sociopolitical
system]{.underline} that [are]{.underline} **[consistent]{.underline}**
[with recent]{.underline} history [project between]{.underline}
**[2ºC]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[2.5ºC]{.underline}** [of
warming]{.underline} by 2100.23 Figure 1 below summarizes some of these
pathways, compared to the SSP marker scenarios.

The [physical climate system adds]{.underline}
**[additional]{.underline}** [layers of uncertainty]{.underline}. There
are uncertainties regarding: how sensitive the climate is to forcing;24
the degree to which declines in anthropogenic **[aerosol
pollution]{.underline}** (which [has a]{.underline}
**[cooling]{.underline}** [effect]{.underline}) could accelerate
warming;25 and whether, when, and how fast tipping points (e.g., melting
permafrost releasing methane, sea ice melt reducing albedo)26 might
occur that accelerate warming beyond what models currently project.
These uncertainties [bring]{.underline} 2100 [warming levels
as]{.underline} **[low as 1.5ºC]{.underline}** and as high as 4ºC into
the realm of possibility.27

\[Figure omitted\]

The [human side]{.underline} also [carries]{.underline} **[deep
uncertainties]{.underline}** and potential for surprises. For example,
[climate feedbacks]{.underline} producing higher-than-expected warming
[could be negated by]{.underline} **[human-side feedbacks]{.underline}**
[of high warming causing]{.underline} **[lower emissions]{.underline}**
[via economic damage]{.underline}.34 [Feedbacks between]{.underline}
**[emissions reductions]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline}
**[political feasibility]{.underline}** [of climate
policies]{.underline},35 [or]{.underline} **[positive
feedbacks]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[economics]{.underline}** [of carbon-free energy]{.underline}36 could
[result in]{.underline} **[faster-than-expected]{.underline}**
[emissions reductions]{.underline}. Major [geopolitical events can cause
disruptions favoring]{.underline} higher or **[lower]{.underline}**
[emissions]{.underline} (or both at the same time in different regions
or sectors), as the war in Ukraine illustrates.37

The [plausibility of]{.underline} **[mid-range]{.underline}** [warming
scenarios (and the]{.underline} **[implausibility]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[extreme]{.underline}** [ones) has]{.underline}
several [important]{.underline} policy [implications]{.underline}.
First, consumers and users of climate impact studies (i.e., policy
makers, politicians, planners, private industry, etc.) should pay close
attention to which scenarios are used, since extreme scenarios still
predominate the scientific literature.38 Users of climate impact
research should emphasize results from mid-range scenarios (i.e.,
RCP4.5, SSP2-4.5, SSP2-3.4) in their assessments of most likely future
outcomes. Second and relatedly, policymakers and politicians should be
aware of the existence and abundance of climate misinformation in the
public sphere based on misuse of extreme scenarios (especially RCP8.5
and SSP5- 8.5) or miscommunication about exploratory studies using these
scenarios.39 This is a type of misinformation that may be less salient
than the well-studied types of misinformation that deny the physical
science of climate change.40 Since misuse of extreme scenarios
originates inside the scientific community (unlike denialism, which
mostly comes from outside), it risks exacerbating recent declines in
trust in the scientific community.41

But in two [important ways the]{.underline} **[climate
conversation]{.underline}** [has gone off the rails]{.underline}.

First, [people say]{.underline} --- **[wrongly]{.underline}** --- [that
global warming is an]{.underline} **[existential
challenge]{.underline}**, [risking the end of]{.underline} \[humankind\]
~~mankind~~. Of course, if the world is about to end, it follows that
any spending is justified. After all, if a world-obliterating meteor is
hurtling towards us, we don't ask about the costs of avoiding it.

Second, it is also often claimed --- somewhat contradictorily --- that
the green transition will make energy cheaper, societies safer and
everyone richer. In this "rainbows and unicorns" scenario, there are no
trade-offs and we can afford climate policy *and* everything else.

Both [claims are]{.underline} **[repeated ad nauseam]{.underline}** by
Canadian politicians and activists and spread by media hooked on selling
climate catastrophes and green utopias. [But]{.underline} both
[are]{.underline} **[quite]{.underline}** [untrue]{.underline}.

That is why I'm writing this series. I will outline how many of [the
most sensationalist, scary climate stories are]{.underline}
**[misleading]{.underline}** or **[wrong]{.underline}** [and ignore
the]{.underline} **[best]{.underline}** [climate science]{.underline}.
[Being]{.underline} **[data-driven]{.underline}**, I [will show you this
with the]{.underline} **[best]{.underline}** [peer-reviewed data and
numbers]{.underline}.

So: *Is* climate change the world's all-encompassing problem today? One
way to [test this is to look at]{.underline} **[extreme
weather]{.underline}**, [which we]{.underline} constantly [hear is
having an ever-larger impact on]{.underline} our
[societies]{.underline}. But [the]{.underline} **[data]{.underline}**
[paint a very different picture]{.underline} (see chart).

We [have]{.underline} **[good evidence]{.underline}** [for the number of
people killed in climate-related disasters, i.e.]{.underline},
**[floods]{.underline}**, **[storms]{.underline}**,
**[droughts]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[fires]{.underline}**.
(We'll look at temperature deaths next week.) A century ago, such
disasters routinely killed hundreds of thousands, even millions of
people in a single disaster. On average, about half a million people a
year died in such disasters. Since then, [the death toll
has]{.underline} **[declined precipitously]{.underline}**. The last
decade saw an average of fewer than 10,000 deaths per year, a decline of
more than 97 per cent.

Of course, [over the past century the world's population
has]{.underline} **[quadrupled]{.underline}**, [which means
the]{.underline} **[risk per person]{.underline}** [has dropped even
more, and is]{.underline} **[now down]{.underline}** [by more
than]{.underline} **[99 per cent]{.underline}**. Why this great success
story? Because richer, more resilient [societies with better technology
and forecasting are]{.underline} much better [able to]{.underline}
**[protect]{.underline}** their [citizens]{.underline}. That [doesn't
mean there is]{.underline} **[no climate signal]{.underline}** at all,
[but rather that **technology and adaptation entirely swamp its
impact**]{.underline}.

In the same way, [climate's impact on]{.underline} **[overall human
welfare]{.underline}** [is also quite small]{.underline}. In proportion
to the total economy, the cost of climate-related disasters has been
declining since 1990. Looking to the future, the best estimates of the
total economic impact of climate change come from two major meta-studies
by two of the most respected climate economists. Each shows that
end-of-century GDP, instead of being 350 per cent higher, will only be
335 per cent higher.

[Void of substantive and legitimate or actionable concerns, climate
radicals rely on inciting **fear** by fanning fiction]{.underline} --
including the latest news that ever-changing weather is lengthening the
time of a day at an "unprecedented" rate. By how much? Researchers in
Switzerland are suggesting that over the course of the next hundred
years, warming weather might add 2.62 milliseconds to a now 24-hour day.
2.62 milliseconds equates to 0.00262 seconds. Scientists explain that if
or when polar ice melts, the Earth's center of gravity could shift ever
so slightly, potentially slowing down the planet's rotation. If this all
sounds familiar, it might be because you've read or heard that the moon,
which controls the rise and fall of the oceans, causes something called
"tidal fiction." That reality has added 0.8 milliseconds to a day since
1990. Taken in totality, from changing temperatures to the rising and
falling of the tides, our days get longer by one 74,000th of a second
each year. It's unlikely that you've noticed. [Cataclysmic warnings
about the changing weather would be **comical** if they weren't so
reckless, irresponsible and expensive.]{.underline} Consumer Reports
indicated earlier this year that a child born in 2024 can expect to pay
between \$500,000 and \$1 million more in their lifetimes to deal with
expenses related to the changing weather. It was reported this past
November that extreme weather damage incidents cost the United States
\$1 billion every three weeks -- or just over \$17 billion a year.
That's up from \$3 billion in damages 40 years ago. What's never
reported is just how much more coastline is built up today than four
decades ago -- and how much more expensive and complicated everything is
to repair. What's also less clear is how much climate change policies
designed to alter the unalterable are costing the average consumer
today. From household products to cars and utilities, everybody is
paying more due to companies wanting to appear environmentally
responsible. The sad formula is simple and predictable: climate
alarmists stoke fear -- and consumers are forced to strike a check to
pay and try to stop the unstoppable. Ironically, those who may think
they're helping by sounding the alarm of changing weather are doing far
more harm than good. Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish author best known for his
book, The Skeptical Environmentalist, warns: [The science shows us that
fears of a climate apocalypse are **unfounded**. Global warming is real,
but it is **not the end** of the world. It is a manageable
problem.]{.underline} Yet, we now live in a world where almost half the
population believes climate change will extinguish humanity. [This has
profoundly altered the political reality. It makes us double down on
poor climate policies]{.underline}. It makes us increasingly ignore all
other challenges, from pandemics and food shortages to political strife
and conflicts, or subsume them under the banner of climate change... [If
we don't say stop, the current, false climate alarm, despite its good
intentions, is likely to leave the world much worse off than it could
be]{.underline}... [We need to **dial back** on the panic, look at the
science, face the economics, and address the issue
rationally.]{.underline} [There are many things posing an existential
threat to the world]{.underline}, from the attempt to corrupt the
exclusivity of male and female to the dearth of new births, [but the
ever-changing weather **isn't** one of them..]{.underline}

### No Impact\-\--Warming\-\--No War

#### No risk of climate or water wars. They're local, there's no evidence, and hostile parties might even work together to avoid disaster.

As climate itself is a heady mix of anthropogenic forcing and chaotic
behaviour, we still cannot speak with great confidence about how the
system will respond to greenhouse emissions past, present and future;
event attribution is fiendishly difficult (e.g. Stott et al., 2016).
Climate crisification is based on scenarios about what could go wrong --
which is where policy comes in. [The implications of climate hazards on
overall stability and security however are largely **indirect**,
multidimensional and changing over time (Adger et al., 2014). It is
**neither** a necessary nor a sufficient condition and may not even be
the most important source of violence]{.underline} (Ide and Scheffran,
2012). According to Barnett and Adger (2007), environmental degradation
caused by climate change undermines human security, therefore raising
grievances and lowering opportunity costs for violent behaviour. [The
most likely forms climate change-induced conflicts will take, they
claim, are **small-scale**, **subnational** conflicts in **poor,
undemocratic** regions with a history of violence and low climate
change-related adaptive capacity.]{.underline} Aggression is caused in
large part by the negative emotions of the actors towards someone or
society or system as they experience stressful events (Berkowitz and
Heimer (1989). However, as Raleigh et al. (2014) [have pointedly put it,
it is **outrageous** to assume that hotter weather makes people more
aggressive. In fact, warmer spells have seen **less violence** than cold
spells]{.underline} (Tertrais, 2011).

While Hsiang et al.'s (2013) meta-analysis confidently claims to find
strong evidence between climate and conflict, Salehyan (2014) [more
realistically notes that despite the alarmism in the media, the academic
field on this is still underdeveloped.]{.underline}

Recently, studies have come out warning of violence induced not by
climate but by climate adaptation (Eriksen et al., 2021). The Dutch
Clingendael think tank argued there will be more conflict potential due
to the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. The drive to comply with climate
goals can have serious collateral damage, such as displacement. Apart
from maladaptation, it sees 'adaptation conflict' notably due to the
increase in hydropower production and biofuel production (Vivekananda et
al., 2017). The German think tank Adelphi has developed design criteria
for 'conflictsensitive adaptation' (Tänzler et al., 2013).

The water wars thesis predicts war between states or communities as
increasing scarcity leads to violent competition; an existential threat
to states legitimising extraordinary actions. For classical realists in
international relations, the world is anarchic, and states will only
cooperate, and respect treaties, if their security is secured (Leb,
2009). For realist analysts, water can't be high politics, although some
have expanded security to include environmental security. But that
doesn't exclude for water to be instrumentalised. Almost every war,
including the occupation of the Crimea in 2014 and very recently near
Kherson, Ukraine, has seen tactical violence against water
installations. An emerging concern is that of the weaponisation of
water, whether in the form of hydro-terrorism or of water being taken
hostage by rebels. Those engaged in civil war have targeted
infrastructure or have taken dams hostage. There also appears to be some
evidence that engineers and water infrastructure have been targeted in
secretive 'proxy war' operations in enemy territory. This is however not
a fight over water, but a fight using water.

Water peace: water wars won't happen?

The above Malthusian climate wars thesis has been countered by an
optimistic Cornucopian counternarrative. [This idealist/institutionalist
counterfactual assumes water wars don't/**won't happen**, or at least
don't need to happen.]{.underline} This environmental peace perspective
[suggests that environmental problems exacerbated by climate change are
not sources of conflict; they are not problems but opportunities and can
even be catalysts for cooperation between individuals and
groups]{.underline} (Ide and Scheffran, 2016; Abrahams and Carr, 2017;
Abukhater, 2013). As water is life, this reasoning holds, it must
inevitably lead to cooperation rather than conflict. Individual and
social responses to rising resource competition can not only cause
conflict but also lead to adaptive migration, technological innovation
and cooperation.

[Water pessimism fell out of fashion for some time around the turn of
the century, when environmental modernisation became the dominant
discourse, arguing that reaching environmental limits makes societies
switch to more rational ways of dealing with water scarcity, i.e. demand
management (]{.underline}e.g. Ohlsson and Turto, 1999). Based on a large
historic database, Basins at Risk, [Aaron Wolf and his Oregon co-workers
showed that water wars haven't broken out for some **2,500 years**;
cooperation is the norm.]{.underline} Like others, Wolf proposes to zoom
in on transboundary basins as integrated ecosystems, overriding
political boundaries and sovereignty, and on that basis identify needs
in depoliticising water in the process, in this literature the
importance of mutual trust building and 'desecuritisation' is often
foregrounded, as securitisation freezes adversarial relations and
sharply reduces potential 'win-sets' (Rigi and Warner, 2020). Countless
projects and trainings were developed to move transboundary basin
relations from conflict to cooperation. Cooperation over transboundary
water, it was held, presents possibilities for development cooperation
beyond water (Sadoff and Grey, 2002): peace in the water domain is
expected to be the starting point for further peacemaking in other
domains and in promoting regional integration. The Senegal River
Development Organisation is held up as an exemplar of transboundary
river benefit sharing (Cooper, 2021). Joint investment has led to
multiple 'friendship dams', and the confidence gained by transboundary
cooperation has been hailed as a driver for peacemaking (e.g. Wolf,
2004).

To be sure, in 2018 3.6 billion people had inadequate access to water at
least one month per year, an unconscionable human rights infringement.
There is however no absolute shortage of water; we make it (seem)
scarce: it was already noted at the 2nd World Water Forum in The Hague
(2000) that there is enough water to go round; it is poor water
governance (especially distribution and access) that creates local
scarcities, suffering and tensions. In this sense mitigation of conflict
potential would seem to be within reach. As Allan (1997, 1) noted: 'The
optimists are right but dangerous, the pessimists are wrong but useful
because they bring attention to the issue'. Not all of the 'optimistic'
assumptions in his schema have so far been borne out. It doesn't help
that a current water optimism campaign is spearheaded by the chemicals
multinational Dupont, who gave us per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(PFAS) and covered up its toxicity (Richter et al., 2021). There is
however reason for some optimism. While some forecasts model a global
population growth increase to 13 billion by 2100, others predict a
levelling off in the 2060s (Adam, 2021). The rate of poverty, violent
conflicts and deadly disaster victims is trending down. The mass
availability of remote sensing data and ICTs obviates the need to
desecuritise water and weather information.

While institutionalists are not entirely sure water wars won't ever
happen, they see [institutions, 'social resources' (Ohlsson and Turton,
1999), ingenuity and/or technology as the drivers for these turns for
the **positive**.]{.underline} Conflict, it is argued, will happen after
sudden shocks that the institutions cannot accommodate. [As climate
change is expected to exacerbate shocks and stresses to the system,
institutionalists propose to increase institutional adaptivity to
shocks]{.underline} (both shocks to social infrastructure and between
states). European institutions have been put up as an example, having
been explicitly designed to rein in excesses of power to prevent a
repeat of the tyrannies of the past, though it should be noted that
cooperation, such as with the river Rhine Action Plan of 1987, is often
triggered by crises and shocks (Kaufmann et al., 2016).
Institutionalists believe by clarifying entitlements to resources,
exclusion can be counteracted, after Amartya Sen's capabilities
approach, whose starting point is the lack of access to strategic
resources (Sen, 1993).

This line of thought is often constructivist, rejecting the materialist
assumptions underlying both the Malthusian and critical (Marxist)
strands. It recognises that people ascribe meaning to others and to
objects, that these meanings are not fixed, and may change this
meaning-giving. This meaning can elevate water to an unassailable
national interest, as history plays a role in the mythmaking of national
identity and interest formation. Yet, when circumstances change, this
attribution can also be undone. It thus sees a possibility for actors to
change their identity and their perception of the problem, turning
enmity into friendship and conflict into cooperation. A constructivist
view also takes seriously that 'scarcity' and 'crisis' are constructs,
and can be reconstructed. Stetter et al. (2011) give the example of the
'new water culture' in Spain putting a stop to water scarcity as an
existential threat. Where this has not happened, as on the Nile, water
may still remain at the level of an issue conflict rather than escalate
into violence. [Faced with the prospect of crisis, even hostile parties
may **work together** if they face a common environmental threat
affecting the well-being of each party. This cooperation can prevent the
outbreak of hostilities and increase **mutual trust**, eventually
transforming the (adverse) identities of the groups
involved]{.underline} (Ide and Scheffran, 2016). There is of course no
certainty that the reinterpretation (and transformation) of conflict and
identity won't go the other way!

Julien (2013) laments the tendency to hydrocentric thinking making the
conceptual jump from water being essential to life to water being the
determinant of all decision-making and politics, let alone the bone of
inevitable contention between states. Lopez-Gunn et al. (2013) and
others have moreover argued conflict analyses are too water-centric, as
the majority of problems are neither created nor solved within the water
domain. Many water conflicts are not even about water (Warner and Vij,
2021; Roth et al., 2021; Wateau, 2000), rather, they are symbolic of
other issues and may escalate in the context of wider socio-political
conflict.

#### Warming [doesn't]{.underline} cause wars.

238-239.

This section has illustrated that the relationship between environment
and conflict could be conditional. The [intervening factors can
be]{.underline} socioeconomic **[development]{.underline}**, **[domestic
political]{.underline}** institutions, [and]{.underline}
**[international institutions]{.underline}**. Overall, low-income
countries, non-democracies, weak states, and states less involved in
international organizations are more vulnerable to environmental war.
That said, some scholars argue that [the]{.underline} real **[causal
mechanisms]{.underline}** [linking environmental changes and conflict
are]{.underline} **[not clear or robust]{.underline}**. The following
section briefly introduces some counterarguments of this field.

COUNTERARGUMENTS

A number of counterarguments, both theoretically and empirically, have
challenged the relationship between environmental changes and war. Some
scholars argue that [environmental changes only have]{.underline}
**[weak or indirect]{.underline}** [effects]{.underline} (Raleigh and
Urdal 2007; Theisen, Holtermann, and Buhaug 2012; Koubi et al. 2012). On
one hand, [whether environmental changes cause conflict]{.underline}
**[depends on]{.underline}** [socioeconomic conditions and political
institutions]{.underline}, and thus there might not be an unconditional
or direct relationship between environmental changes and conflict (Koubi
et al. 2012). On the other hand, [even if there is an]{.underline}
**[indirect]{.underline}** [effect, this effect appears to
be]{.underline} **[weak empirically]{.underline}** (Sakaguchi,
Varughese, and Auld 2017). Some [scholars]{.underline} further [suggest
that in conflict research other factors]{.underline} such as
socioeconomic development and state capacity [are]{.underline}
**[substantially more influential]{.underline}** [and should be
of]{.underline} **[higher]{.underline}** research [priority]{.underline}
(Theisen et al. 2011; Mach et al. 2019).

For example, Feitelson, Tamimi, and Rosenthal (2012) examine the tension
over freshwater between Israel and Palestine and argue that a
resource-induced conflict is unlikely. They point out that Israel, due
to its [strong state capacity and high economic
development]{.underline}, is [able to]{.underline}
**[address]{.underline}** the [potential damage]{.underline} caused by
climate change [through]{.underline} desalination and other **[public
polices]{.underline}** [and thus]{.underline} **[mitigate]{.underline}**
[the problem of resource scarcity]{.underline}. They further suggest
that although climate change could affect Palestinian farmers, urban
populations are unlikely to be affected. Hence they conclude that
climate change is unlikely to cause conflict between Israel and
Palestine directly.

Similarly, Theisen, Holtermann, and Buhaug's (2013)
[research]{.underline} on drought and civil conflict in Africa reaches a
similar conclusion, **[indicat]{.underline}**ing [that drought
has]{.underline} **[no direct relationship]{.underline}** [on conflict
onset]{.underline}. Instead, political exclusion plays a far more
influential role. Likewise, Koubi, Bernauer, Kalbhenn, and Spilker
(2012) [question the]{.underline} **[causal pathways]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} **[climate change]{.underline}** (deviations in
temperature and rainfall), economic **[growth]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} civil **[conflict]{.underline}**.

Moreover, some scholars point out that [the relationship between
environment and war is]{.underline} **[not empirically robust or
consistent]{.underline}** (Buhaug 2010; Theisen, Gleditsch, and Buhaug
2013; Koubi et al. 2014; Wischnath and Buhaug 2014). Theisen et al.
(2013) [present a]{.underline} **[comprehensive review]{.underline}**
[on recent studies on environment and conflict, including climate
variability, natural disasters, and forced environmental
migration]{.underline}. They find that [empirical evidence]{.underline}
in this field appears [to be]{.underline} **[inconsistent]{.underline}**
and they argue that better theories and empirical modeling are needed.
Similarly, Wischnath and Buhaug (2014), focusing on Asia, contend that
[there is]{.underline} **[little evidence]{.underline}** [supporting
the]{.underline} **[climate-conflict]{.underline}**
[argument]{.underline}. In their research [empirical results
are]{.underline} **[sensitive]{.underline}** [to research design,
suggesting]{.underline} that [the effect of climate variability on
conflict found in]{.underline} **[other]{.underline}** [studies
is]{.underline} **[not systematic or generalizable]{.underline}**.
Buhaug (2010) also challenges Burke et al.'s (2009) conclusion that warm
weather leads to increased probability of civil war in Africa by
applying a different research design, and he finds that Burke et al.'s
(2009) results do not hold when alternative measures and model
specifications are used. In short, a few scholars have pointed out that
the effect of environmental changes on conflict is not empirically
robust, and this field has not reached a consensus yet.

Civil war scholars have investigated many intervening variables between
the environment and conflict, and they have done so in a much more
systematic way than interstate scholars. Interstate conflict models that
focus on the environment would benefit from the identification of
factors that condition the relationships between resource competition,
climate change, and war.

RESEARCH CHALLENGES

One reason that the relationship between environment and conflict is
still debatable is that there are many research challenges in this
field. One of the challenges is to disentangle the causal chain (Nordås
and Gleditsch 2007). The [most common causal chain]{.underline},
**[suggested]{.underline}** [by the literature]{.underline} of this
field, [starts from environment-induced]{.underline} **[resource
scarcity]{.underline}**, [such as a shortage of]{.underline}
**[food]{.underline}**, fresh**[water]{.underline}**, [and
other]{.underline} **[life essentials]{.underline}**. Consequently,
[people who are affected by resource scarcity may]{.underline} **[fight
over]{.underline}** [the remaining resources, or]{.underline} they have
to **[leave]{.underline}** [the area]{.underline}. Migration could
further result in resource competition in the receiving area as well as
shift the demographic balance, creating conflicts between environmental
migrants and host populations. However, [testing this]{.underline}
**[causal chain]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[extremely]{.underline}** [difficult]{.underline}.

#### The [consensus of empirics]{.underline} disproves it.

Dr. Sara M. **Mitchell &** Yufan **Yang 25**, PhD, Professor &
Collegiate Scholar, Political Science, University of Iowa; PhD,
Political Science, University of Iowa, \"The Environment and Conflict:
Water Wars,\" in What Do We Know about War?, Chapter 13, 2025, pg.
234-235.

On the other hand, [global warming]{.underline} over the past few
centuries [may have been associated with the]{.underline} **[decline of
interstate warfare]{.underline}** (see Braumoeller, chapter 16 herein),
[reflecting the]{.underline} **[economic efficiencies]{.underline}**
that [globalization creates]{.underline} **[relative]{.underline}** [to
territorial conquest]{.underline} (Brooks 1999). Zhang et al. (2007)
[examine climate change and conflict over a]{.underline}
**[long]{.underline}** [historical period]{.underline} (1400--1900).
Their initial research focused on China and found that warfare periods
coincided with cold spells due to decline in agricultural production,
forced migration, and violent competition between groups for food and
other resources.

The authors discovered similar patterns in Europe, with periods of war
highly correlated with periods of cold temperature anomalies. Tol and
Wagner (2010) [confirm]{.underline} these [findings of]{.underline}
**[colder periods]{.underline}** [experiencing]{.underline}
**[more]{.underline}** [warfare]{.underline} (due to displacement from
bad harvests) [using rolling regression time series models of
temperatures and conflict]{.underline}. However, they find the effects
are getting weaker over time, such that it is difficult to infer that
warmer climate periods of the modern period will avoid warfare.
[Analyzing the]{.underline} **[systemic relationship]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} global [warming and war]{.underline}, Gartzke
(2012) argues that [it is]{.underline} **[important]{.underline}** [to
control for]{.underline} **[economic development]{.underline}** [in
these models, since]{.underline} growing
**[interdependence]{.underline}** [could increase the costs
of]{.underline} territorial [conquest]{.underline} (relative to trade).
Using a summed measure of MIDs in the system from 1816 to 2000 yearly
and a measure of global temperature anomalies (from the 1951--1980
baseline), Gartzke's [analyses show that]{.underline} **[temperature
anomalies have little effect on fatal MIDs]{.underline}**, while
economic development levels better predict the decline in conflict over
this period.

Schmidt et al. (2021) [find]{.underline} **[similar
patterns]{.underline}** [when studying the effect of climate factors on
diplomatic conflicts]{.underline} (using ICOW data),
[showing]{.underline} that [heat waves]{.underline}
**[reduce]{.underline}** [the likelihood of issue claim onset or
militarization]{.underline} (or the effects are insignificant).
**[All]{.underline}** these **[empirical studies]{.underline}** [suggest
that higher average temperatures from long-term climate change
are]{.underline} **[not likely to contribute]{.underline}** [to more
frequent warfare, reflecting]{.underline} perhaps [the]{.underline}
**[improving adaptation]{.underline}** [of human society to climate
change]{.underline}.

#### Resource scarcity is [not conflict-driving]{.underline}.

These [arguments have]{.underline} **[long been contested]{.underline}**
[by scholars]{.underline} in the Cornucopian tradition, [who
see]{.underline} **[other]{.underline}** [factors]{.underline} -- e.g.
bad governance, corruption, or inequality -- [as]{.underline} **[more
relevant]{.underline}** [for the escalation of violent
conflicts]{.underline} (see further Koubi, 2019: 347). In this
understanding, Malthusian [arguments remain locked in an]{.underline}
"**[overwhelmingly]{.underline}** [environmentally determinist
world-view" that]{.underline} "**[ascribes causal primacy]{.underline}**
[to environmental resources]{.underline}" (Selby and Hoffmann, 2014:
748). [Studying]{.underline} both the potential for constructive
environmental peacebuilding under conditions of resource scarcity and
resource abundance as a reason for more conflictive
**[climate-security]{.underline}** [relations]{.underline}, **[recent
research]{.underline}** [has introduced more nuance into debates about
natural resources and conflict]{.underline}. While countries with an
abundance of natural resources can be more prone to violent conflict
(Collier and Hoeffler, 2004, Koubi et al., 2014), [resource
scarcity]{.underline} **[does not have to lead to violent
conflict]{.underline}** [but is simply one factor influencing the
outbreak of war]{.underline}. At the same time, [natural resource
scarcity]{.underline}, such as water scarcity, [has]{.underline} at
times [led to]{.underline} **[increased]{.underline}**
[cooperation]{.underline} (see e.g. Ide et al., 2023). The [benefits
of]{.underline} **[cooperation]{.underline}** [outweigh the rationale
for violent conflict and the]{.underline} **[expectation]{.underline}**
[is that]{.underline} environmental [cooperation can]{.underline}
**[spill over]{.underline}** [into more]{.underline}
**[sustainable]{.underline}** [cases of peacebuilding]{.underline}
(Dresse et al., 2019). However, more research is needed here as the
evidence remains limited to a few isolated case studies. In the end,
[the]{.underline} established -- and contested -- [links between climate
and conflict "remain]{.underline} **[highly uncertain]{.underline}**"
[by design]{.underline} (Beaumont and de Coning, 2022).

Beyond this, Halstead notes, [the]{.underline} **[overall
trend]{.underline}** [in recent history has been a]{.underline} **[sharp
decline]{.underline}** [of interstate conflict]{.underline}. For
example, Halstead cites a report by Our World in Data which charts the
recent history of great power conflict:

\[Figure omitted\]

The [last few centuries have brought a]{.underline}
**[sharp]{.underline}** [decline of great power conflict, from
near-incessant conflict to]{.underline} **[very low]{.underline}**
[conflict]{.underline}.

[Even in]{.underline} more **[recent]{.underline}**
[history]{.underline}, despite increases in population and destructive
technology, [deaths in interstate conflicts have]{.underline}
**[declined]{.underline}** [sharply]{.underline}:

\[Figure omitted\]

The [suggestion implicit in these graphs has been echoed by]{.underline}
**[most recent scholars]{.underline}**: interstate conflict is declining
in severity, and great power conflict is declining even more rapidly.
This means that [even if]{.underline} other factors, such as **[climate
change]{.underline}**, [tend to exacerbate conflict, climate change will
have to contend with]{.underline} **[countervailing factors
that]{.underline}** have **[significantly reduced conflict in recent
history]{.underline}**, [and may continue to reduce future
conflict]{.underline}.

Now it is true that [some scholars think climate change may]{.underline}
**[exacerbate]{.underline}** [future conflict, although this finding
is]{.underline} **[controversial]{.underline}** (See Burke et al. 2015,
Koubi 2019, Saleyhan 2008). However, almost [all scholars agree that
climate change is]{.underline} **[far]{.underline}** [from
the]{.underline} **[most influential]{.underline}** [factor in driving
conflict]{.underline}. For example, a recent expert elicitation in
*Nature* found that [experts ranked climate change as among
the]{.underline} **[least influential]{.underline}** [factors driving
interstate conflict]{.underline}.

#### Other factors [outweigh]{.underline} AND data is [biased]{.underline}. [Even the IPCC]{.underline} concurs.

Vally Koubi: The **[climate-conflict]{.underline}** [debate emerged
because policymakers, journalists and academics were keen to link
conflicts]{.underline} (for example the Darfur war) [to
drought]{.underline}. In reality, [this relationship is]{.underline}
almost [always]{.underline} **[more complex]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[context specific]{.underline}**. For instance,
[although extreme climate events]{.underline}, climate variability and
climate change [have affected conflict, their]{.underline} direct
[impacts have been]{.underline} **[small compared to other
drivers]{.underline}**, including socioeconomic development, government
strength, inequalities, and a history of conflict1. However, when
climate affects these other drivers, conflict is more likely, moderated
by contextual factors such as economic development and political
institutions2, 3. Therefore, my position is that [climate
change]{.underline} **[does not]{.underline}** directly [cause
conflict]{.underline}, but indirectly increases conflict risk by
exacerbating existing social, economic and environmental factors, hence
acting as a 'threat multiplier'.

Jan Selby: The climate-conflict debate arose largely as a by-product of
politics, triggered by the release of several scenario reports on the
security implications of climate change under the George W. Bush
presidency. These [reports]{.underline} **[were extremely light on
evidence]{.underline}**, their [central purpose being
neither]{.underline} **[scientific]{.underline}** [nor motivated by
a]{.underline} **[concern]{.underline}** [with conflict, but instead
about]{.underline} **[dramatizing]{.underline}** the importance of
**[climate change]{.underline}** [to US domestic and policy
audiences]{.underline}. The [hope was that depicting climate change as
a]{.underline} **[vital 'national security' issue]{.underline}** [might
help build momentum for swifter action on emissions]{.underline}. [Only
in the]{.underline} **[wake]{.underline}** [of this politics
did]{.underline} a **[substantial]{.underline}** body of actual
**[research]{.underline}** [on the subject emerge]{.underline}. However,
[evidence from this research, is]{.underline} generally
**[weak]{.underline}**, and **[contradictory]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} in some cases, **[non-existent]{.underline}**, as

Ayesha Siddiqi: Knowledge is never "neutral". The politics of knowledge
production sustains an unequal relationship between power and those
subject to is control. Thus, applying Edward Said's thesis on
Orientalism almost directly to the case of 'climate conflict'
scholarship, I suggest that knowledge produced in the West about the
non-Western world provides a powerful example of "the affiliation of
knowledge with power"4. Mainstream ['climate-conflict'
literature]{.underline} **[continues]{.underline}** [to be
produced]{.underline} in the Western academy, dealing with climate
conflict 'out there', in the Global South. [It tends to]{.underline}
employ frameworks that [link variables]{.underline}, **[making
connections]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} forms of [climate
related scarcity]{.underline}, [or environmental destruction, and
violent conflict]{.underline}. While this scholarship might have robust
or accurate findings, [it is]{.underline} **[epistemologically
biased]{.underline}**. A disproportionate focus has been given to highly
visible conflicts of geopolitical significance, including Syria and
Darfur5, rather than the challenges people affected by climate-related
hazards and its political repercussions deal with in everyday life. This
overemphasis on visibility and significance (for the West) 2arginalizes
subaltern knowledge holders and their lived experience of 'climate
conflicts' in their everyday lives.

Equally, mainstream [knowledge produced on 'climate conflict'
is]{.underline} **[methodologically biased]{.underline}**. The
methodological techniques employed are generally positivist6 and largely
based on quantitative large-N studies7, once again, enabling this work
to fit into frameworks and concepts that have utility in Western
security circles. For the Global Majority, 'climate conflicts' are
taking place in their everyday lives against forms of climate
colonialism that is not being recognized and studied as such. Mainstream
climate conflict research suffers from a particular kind of
Eurocentricism that Orientalises the Global South as descending into war
and conflict because of climate variability.

The root problem here, fourthly, is that the HCN idea rests on flawed
and anachronistic environmentally determinist premises. [The claim that
only certain]{.underline} ''optimal'' [temperatures enable]{.underline}
''[human thriving]{.underline}'' 1 directly [mirrors]{.underline} the
views of Ellsworth Huntington and other [nineteenth]{.underline} and

too]{.underline}. Furthermore, [these claims are
**misleading**]{.underline} in their characterization of both the past

only is the idea of a temperature niche out of line with contemporary

The topic of [whales as carbon sinks has received much media
attention]{.underline} combining two popular subjects: whales and
climate change. A non-representative search in ProQuest using the terms
"whales" and "carbon" revealed 352 newspaper articles from over 45
countries between 2012 and 2022, with a strong increase of interest in
the topic in the past three years (Figure 2). An online search in Google
Scholar and ProQuest on peer-reviewed studies in international journals
over the same 10-year period resulted in six studies providing
observations or modelling studies on whales as carbon sinks mostly
focusing on the Southern Ocean (Figure 2, Supplementary Table 1). A
report that triggered a strong outreach in media was published by the
World Monetary Fund in 2019 by Chami et al. (2019) (e.g., "Protecting
whales to protect the planet" UNEP, 2019; "Restoring whales to their
pre-hunted numbers could capture 1.7 billion tons of CO2 a year",
EuroNews, 2021). The report used data from research publications
analyzed in the following sections (Lavery et al., 2010; Pershing et
al., 2010; Roman and McCarthy, 2010) to calculate a potential carbon
uptake by whales. An opinion published by (Pearson et al., 2023) further
underlined the gap between available scientific evidence on this topic
and also triggered a strong media response (e.g., "Whales can have an
important but overlooked role in tackling the climate crisis,
researchers say" CNN News 15/12/2022) [with many **news stories**
continuing to claim whales as climate savers or climate
engineers]{.underline}. The phenomenon of simplifying complex
relationships to gain readers attention is particularly common in the
"post-truth" era (Gobo and Marcheselli, 2022) amplified by the increased
use of social media.

A search of social media posts on varies platforms that contained the
key words "whales" and "carbon" using the analyst tool keyhole
(https://keyhole.co) showed that this topic has a high retention within
the social media domain (Figure 2). Over 10 days between 18th-27th
February 2022, 677 posts were reported, showing a sharp increase of
posts during and after World Whale Day on the 20th February. However, it
is important to notice that 88% of these were reposts and only 10% had
original content related to whales and carbon further underlining the
high retention of this topic from original posts. Retention of popular
topics is high across social media platforms even if the original
content is not updated (Kapoor et al., 2018). The sharing of content is
often driven by believes over accuracy (Pennycook et al., 2021). The
implications of a believe-driven process can result in a diversion of
attention towards well-established methods of carbon sequestration. It
can result in attention and resources drawn away from proven, effective
nature-based solutions to climate change.

Limitations of whale mediated carbon removal

There are five pathways identified by Roman et al. (2014) and further
outlined by Pearson et al. (2023) in which whales can potentially
enhance the removal of carbon from the atmosphere into the deep ocean
and/or deposition. They are summarized in Figure 3 and discussed in the
next paragraphs in the context and order of contribution to global
carbon export. [There are **difficulties** and **limitations** in
quantifying the impact of whales on carbon sequestrations]{.underline}
with the estimated contribution of each pathway being hypothetical.
Estimates are presented to provide a guidance and support the theory
that whales have a limited contribution to global carbon export.
Processes in the euphotic zone are generally faster and short lived
(days to weeks), whereas processes in deeper parts of the ocean take
much longer (years to millennia).

[Primary production is]{.underline} generally [limited in macro-nutrient
depleted oligotrophic oceans]{.underline}. Despite macro-nutrients
(nitrate and phosphate) are abundant in the in the Southern Ocean
(Marinov et al., 2008), micro-nutrients, prevalently iron (Fe), are
scarce in the so-called high-nutrient-low-chlorophyll (HNLC) regions of
the Southern Ocean, and in the equatorial and northern Pacific. This
results in a limited primary production in vast region of the global
oceans and associated CO2 drawdown from the atmosphere.

[In theory, the whale conveyor belt, whale pump, and whale bioturbation
are linked to the biological pump]{.underline} by increasing the
availability of nutrients and enhancing phytoplankton primary
production, thereby driving a positive feedback loop in the oceanic
carbon pump (Smetacek and Naqvi, 2008; Roman et al., 2014; Pearson et
al., 2022). Primary production in the sunlit surface ocean is limited by
nutrient availability. [Macro-nutrients]{.underline} (nitrate and
phosphate) [are abundant in the deep ocean]{.underline} and in the
Southern Ocean (Marinov et al., 2008), [while
micro-nutrient]{.underline}, prevalently iron (Fe), [are
scarce]{.underline} in the so-called high-nutrient-low-chlorophyll
(HNLC) regions of the Southern Ocean, and in the equatorial and northern
Pacific. For example, Roman et al. (2014) suggested that blue whales
(Balaenoptera musculus) in the Southern Ocean transported an estimated
88 t of nitrogen per year (estimated for 2001) from Antarctic feeding
grounds to tropical breeding grounds via nitrogen-rich urea released
through catabolism of lipids and proteins during fasting. Although [it
is difficult to demonstrate the excess production in lieu of the large
natural variability, this flux can be considered new production and
could lead to a carbon flux of up to 2,100 tons of CO2 per
year]{.underline} (equivalent to 572 tons of carbon) [by
phytoplankton]{.underline} (Martin et al., 2021). However, [this
quantity is then **released in the upper ocean where respiration
processes may rapidly release it back to the atmosphere**]{.underline}
(Bolaños et al., 2020). [Respiration of whales during their
migration]{.underline} also [add to **release** of **CO2 back to the
atmosphere**]{.underline} (Lavigne et al., 1986; Huntley et al., 1991).
[While nutrients]{.underline} directly recycled by whales within the
upper water column from distant regions [support primary production,
they **do not**]{.underline} necessarily **[stimulate downward particle
flux, which is required for carbon sequestration]{.underline}** (Lavery
et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2021).

The key micro-nutrient [iron]{.underline} that is [translocated via
whales]{.underline} is generally [scarce in open oceans]{.underline},
especially in the Southern Ocean (de Baar et al., 2005; Tagliabue et
al., 2017). [Whale-dependent recycling and relocation of iron is
suggested to play a key role in increasing primary productivity,
and]{.underline} in turn enhancing [the biological pump]{.underline} and
possibly carbon export (Smith et al., 2013; Ratnarajah et al., 2016).
Generally, the contribution of baleen whales to the iron flux is through
the spatial redistribution of iron in surface waters rather than through
the recycling of iron. [Given the extent of ocean where primary
production occurs, internal cycling of iron by phytoplankton degradation
is **much larger** than whale contribution]{.underline} (Maldonado et
al., 2016). However, whale feces do supply and distribute both macro-
and micro-nutrients to areas where external sources are limited (Roman
and McCarthy, 2010), for instance when crossing the Southern Ocean HNLC
region in the meridional migration. Whale feces are known to have high
iron concentration (146 ± 134 μg/g) (Nicol et al., 2010; Ratnarajah et
al., 2014) compared to Antarctic krill (65 ± 41 μg/g, Supplementary
Tables 2, 3). Whales provide biomagnification because they
preferentially store carbon in their muscles, but do not need all the Fe
found in the ingested krill biomass (e.g., 147 mg Fe/kg dry weight of
krill; Nicol et al., 2010). It is suggested that foraging whales
concentrate carbon in their muscles and release a majority of ingested
iron in a more bioavailable fraction through feces. Ideally bioavailable
iron stays at +2 stage, which is soluble. In contrast, iron +3 is
insoluble. Inside the whale stomachs digestion is an acidic (HCl) and
oxygen depleted environment, which would favor the reduction reaction,
i.e. Fe+3 to Fe +2 (Ratnarajah et al., 2014; Ratnarajah et al., 2017;
Ratnarajah et al., 2018), however, further evidence on the
bioavailability of whale feces is required. The iron concentration in
whale feces reaches ten million times that of the Southern Ocean surface
waters (Nicol et al., 2010) and can contribute 3 to 5 orders of
magnitude higher iron concentrations than that required for
phytoplankton growth (Wing et al., 2014). For instance, compared to
surface seawater dissolved iron concentration of \~ 0.1 -- 0.5 nmol/L in
the Southern Ocean (Tagliabue et al., 2012), humpback whale (Megaptera
novaeangliae) feces iron concentration ranges from 186 - 754 nmol/L and
from 5,026 -- 22,526 nmol L in dissolved (\<0.2 μ) and particulate
(\>0.2 μ) phases, respectively (Ratnarajah et al., 2017). Other factors,
such as the differences between soluble and colloidal iron, fraction of
lithogenic iron, and available organic matter, may also influence
bioavailability and ocean primary production (Ratnarajah et al., 2016;
Ratnarajah et al., 2018). Fin (B. physalus) and blue w[hale species are
likely the largest contributors to iron supply, due to their higher prey
consumption, and]{.underline} thus having [a greater potential for
enhanced carbon fluxes]{.underline} (Durfort et al., 2020). [Whether
this]{.underline} contribution to the natural ocean iron cycle [would
lead to enhanced sequestration of carbon is]{.underline} however **[not
demonstrated]{.underline}**. Iron relocation is one of the most likely
components of the biological pump that can be enhanced by whales'
activity in open ocean that otherwise lie barren. Modelling based on the
latest baleen whale prey consumption estimates suggested that in some
areas such as the Scotia Sea, iron from whale feces may have stimulated
more than 20% of net primary production prior whaling (Savoca et al.,
2021). Given that phytoplankton uptakes one quarter of iron released by
whales (Ratnarajah et al., 2016), for four whale species (blue, fin,
humpback and Antarctic minke whales - B. bonaerensis) in the Southern
Ocean could capture up to 0.215 Pg carbon annually during pre-whaling
period (Savoca et al., 2021) However, [whale feces driven carbon capture
is likely to vary among the global oceans based on]{.underline} the
nutri[ent availability in surface ocean and bioavailable fraction of
nutrients in whale feces]{.underline}. For instance, unlike the Southern
Ocean, the Southern Benguela upwelling system in the Southeast Atlantic
is a nutrient rich oceanic sector in a low latitude feeding area. Hence,
[the carbon capture potential through the whale pump in the Southern
Benguela feeding ground is likely lower compared to the estimations made
in the Southern Ocean]{.underline}.

[Similar considerations can be made for the whale pump]{.underline},
which describes the process of whales moving up and down the water
column for feeding, and transferring nutrients to surface waters in the
process (Nicol et al., 2010; Pearson et al., 2022). [Spatial and
temporal scales are]{.underline} much [smaller in this case than for
regional migrations]{.underline}, and [there is **no
quantification**]{.underline} in the literature [whether this process
may have an annual effect on the duration of the blooms or on net
ecosystem production]{.underline}. For instance, [there is **no
evidence** of how more effective whales could be in relocating iron from
the deeper Southern Ocean to the surface when compared to the typical
mixing rates]{.underline}. It has been reported that sperm whales
(Physeter macrocephalus) feeding in depth of 1,000 m can make nutrients
available when defaecating at the surface, coinciding with phytoplankton
blooms (Roman et al., 2014). Based on a population estimation from the
year 2000, Lavery et al. (2010) estimated that an additional 240,000 t
of CO2 (0.000066 Pg carbon) annually were exported into the Southern
Ocean through the promotion of phytoplankton growth (of which one
quarter is recycled by phytoplankton) from the nutrients provided by
sperm whale feces. These estimates are indicative of the contribution
exerted by whales to ecosystem functioning, but do not give a
comparative view of their role with respect to the background
physical-biogeochemical dynamics and also exclude the respiration of
whales during this process.

Whale bioturbation (Figure 4) is the process by which whales resuspend
bed sediments into the water column, when feeding on mollusks and other
organisms on the ocean floor. It is conceptually similar to the whale
pump, but involves a pool of nutrients that are assumed to be less
readily available to marine degradation. This process is commonly
observed in feeding of demersal fish, the main difference is their
smaller size compared to whales (Mariani et al., 2020). For example,
gray whales (Eschrichtius robustus) have been shown to remobilize
nutrients into the Bering Sea when foraging for amphipods (Nelson and
Johnson, 1987; Alter et al., 2007). However, this is non-selective
bioturbation, and the same process could release organic matter
previously buried in the sediments, thus enhancing the recycling of
carbon back to CO2. [The overall whale bioturbation contribution to
carbon export or sequestration has **not been quantified** to date and
may prove difficult to be disentangled from other bottom biogeochemical
processes]{.underline} but [its contribution to carbon export **if any**
is likely smaller than the whale pump contribution. Bottom feeding is
only known for a few whale species]{.underline} such as gray whales
**[restricted to small areas]{.underline}**.

[The long-life span and large body size of whales can contribute to
carbon storage]{.underline} over decades. Using whale populations of
eight baleen whale species from the year 2001, the living biomass stock
of carbon was estimated to be about 0.002 Pg (Pearson et al., 2023).
Commercial whaling has reduced the size of baleen whale populations by
an average of 70% since 1900 (Tulloch et al., 2019). Prior to whaling,
the carbon in living biomass was estimated to be five times higher (0.01
Pg). Other marine organisms like fish also accumulate carbon but over
shorter times scales with the removal of fish from the ocean causing an
estimated 0.00034 Pg of carbon release per year since 1950 (Mariani et
al., 2020). [The overall contribution]{.underline} of whales living
tissue to carbon storage [is **limited by their lifespan**]{.underline}
(at least several decades) [and **their own respiration** as for all
animals]{.underline}. However, [the value]{.underline} of animals [to
carbon sequestratio]{.underline}n in general also [needs to be assessed
in the context of their ecosystem function]{.underline} ((Schmitz et
al., 2023).

[Whales]{.underline} can [fall into the deep sea after death, where
their carcasses can take **hundreds of years to
decompose**]{.underline}, or millennia if buried in sediments, which
depends on sedimentation rate and available oxygen (Pershing et al.,
2010). However, [the overall contribution of whale falls to carbon
sequestration could be **relatively small**]{.underline} and might be in
the range of only 2% of estimated carbon export by whales (Durfort et
al., 2020). [The amount of biogenic carbon is **species specific** and
**depending on the region**. Whale species vary in size and some
species]{.underline}, such as southern right whales (Eubalaena
australis), [have a tendency to **float after death**]{.underline} and
are less likely to sink. The effect would be more marked in regions
supporting larger whale populations e.g. on the west coast of North
America where a study from marine sanctuaries off San Francisco claimed
that whale falls represent roughly 60% of the estimated total annual
carbon removal of the area equivalent to about 10 890 tons of carbon or
0.00001 Pg (Hutto et al., 2021). Should the population recover to
pre-whaling numbers, Pearson et al. (2023) estimated for baleen whale
species (blue, fin, humpback, southern right, gray and Antarctic minke
whales) a carbon sequestration potential through sinking carcasses of
0.000062 Pg carbon annually. Respiration rates of whales to atmospheric
CO2 would need to be subtracted from this calculation as well as any CO2
release during decomposition.

[Carbon buried under marine sediment within the deep sea is generally a
**long-term**]{.underline} (**[millennia]{.underline}**) [**removal of
carbon** from the atmosphere]{.underline} (Teng and Zhang, 2018).
However, [the burial rate of organic carbon is a function of
sedimentation rates]{.underline} (Betts and Holland, 1991), which is
less than 0.01 cm k per year for major ocean basins and the Southern
Ocean; (Restreppo et al., 2020). [Scavengers remove whale soft tissue at
high rates]{.underline} (40--60 kg per day), [and then the exposed bones
are colonized by dense assemblages of polychaetas and
crustaceans]{.underline} (Smith and Baco, 2003). Anerobic bacteria
decomposes bone lipids. [The scavenging process can **last up to 50
years**]{.underline} (Smith and Baco, 2003), [which prevents whale
carcasses from being buried under falling sediment]{.underline}.
Therefore, **[burial of organic carbon]{.underline}** (sequestration)
**[associated with whale falls is expected to be the least effective
pathway of carbon sequestration by whales will make only a small
contribution to carbon sequestration]{.underline}**.

Discussion

Based on the literature presented in the previous sections, [there is a
common understanding]{.underline} that baleen [whales contribute to
carbon uptake]{.underline}, as done by other marine life in the marine
ecosystem. [The **challenge remains to quantify** whether this
uptake]{.underline} at the whale's population level [translates into an
effective enhancement of carbon export and subsequent
sequestration]{.underline} that is [comparable with the known scales of
the global ocean. A **lack of comparable global data** for different
regions and species]{.underline}, has [led to **generalized
estimations**]{.underline} based on few observations with extrapolations
based on numerical models. Our analysis has demonstrated that only
**[relatively few studies]{.underline}** so far [have provided direct
observations]{.underline} on the baleen whales contribution to the ocean
carbon cycle on a locally limited scale, and that the majority of the
carbon sequestration potential estimates are obtained through model
parameterizations. Currently **[there is a lack of evidence showing that
whales make a significant contribution to global carbon export to alter
climate change]{.underline}**. We looked at whale carbon sequestration
pathways and available knowledge for each pathway suggests that the
influence of whales on carbon flux is small compared to the global
carbon flux. Nevertheless, public interest on this topic has steadily
increased over the past decade underlining the need for more research in
this field. **[The gap between media and available science to support
the theory of whales influencing global climate may distract falsely
portraying the role of whales as important]{.underline}** to increase
carbon sequestration from the atmosphere **[may distract policy from
other important issues]{.underline}**.

#### Their impact on phytoplankton is also overstated.

So, **[whale falls are not going to save us]{.underline}**. Nor are they
going to make a \$1 trillion carbon market. Maybe most of the whale
climate solution comes from the whale pump?

This is where the evidence gets a bit sketchy.

[Estimating the carbon stored in whales or from whale falls is
relatively easy]{.underline}. We need to make some assumptions about the
number of whales we have, what they weigh, and how many make it to the
deep ocean when they die. But we can get a reasonable range; certainly,
order-of-magnitude estimates we can be reasonably confident in.

It is much more difficult to calculate the extra phytoplankton growth
and productivity whales generate by recycling nutrients.

Some studies in this area suggest that the carbon potential for the
whale pump is roughly similar to that of whale falls. One paper
estimated that sperm whale populations remove around 875,000 tonnes of
CO2 from the atmosphere via this mechanism.9 This is for current whale
populations; if we were to restore them to pre-whaling levels, carbon
sequestration could be around an order of magnitude higher. Let's then
call it 9 million tonnes of CO2. This study was also for sperm whales in
southern oceans only, so the global total might be somewhere in the 10
to 20 million tonnes range. Yes, this is a bit hand-wavy, but we're
going for order-of-magnitude estimates here.

A couple of more recent studies caused a stir when they suggested that
the whale pump could capture 700 million to 1.7 billion tonnes a year.10
These were the papers that put the monetary value of whales at \$1
trillion.

These [figures rely on the assumption that whales would increase the
primary productivity of global phytoplankton by 1% to 2%]{.underline}.
One key problem, though, is that **[there is no empirical evidence to
support this]{.underline}**, and the [authors]{.underline} of these two
papers [give **no real justification**]{.underline} for it (more info in
the footnote).11

These numbers have been criticised by a number of researchers. As a
review by Pearson et al. (2024) highlights:

"Whales are proposed to increase primary productivity globally by 1%,
with no supporting empirical data. [Whales can increase primary
productivity, but the **magnitude** of this **varies** by species,
location, and season. Whales are **absent from vast areas**, with **no
indication** that they could increase phytoplankton productivity by
1%]{.underline}."

The authors go on to list several other concerns about the underlying
assumptions. One of the other key ones is that [even if whales do
increase the productivity of phytoplankton, we don't have a great
understanding of how much of that carbon actually falls to the deep
ocean. It could be]{.underline} the case [that a lot of it decomposes
near the surface, **where it's not a carbon sink at all**]{.underline}.

In short, [our understanding of how whales contribute to nutrient
recycling]{.underline} --- [and how much carbon that might save
us]{.underline} --- [is **far too limited to justify billion-tonne
claims**]{.underline}.

Of course, we don't have to disregard these papers completely. They add
something to the overall scientific literature. But it's important to
note that they are pretty far from the scientific consensus on this, and
we should be cautious about putting those findings into practice, by
investing money and deploying solutions (or non-solutions).
