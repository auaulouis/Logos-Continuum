[The Utility of Track II]{.underline} Dialogue

With a number of complex and interlinked strategic challenges ahead, the
sharpening of geopolitical divisions leaves few real opportunities for
their effective and holistic management. In [the absence of constructive
official diplomacy, there is a clear need for informal dialogue through
a neutral platform that sustains]{.underline} some threads of
[communication, and develops solutions]{.underline} to the most pressing
problems.

Aside from the High North Talks, [there have been]{.underline} other
[initiatives that promote dialogue on Arctic issues]{.underline}
(including the Atlantic Council's annual conference on Security in the
Arctic, the Arctic Circle hosted by Iceland, and the economic-focused
High North Dialogue), [though they largely exclude Russia, and usually
China]{.underline}---which, while not directly a regional actor, will
certainly become increasingly relevant to the region in the years ahead.
From a realist viewpoint, there is a sound logic in engaging not only
with likemindeds, but with anyone who can and will have an impact on the
ground.

[Discreet dialogue should address both areas of cooperation
and]{.underline} of potential [confrontation]{.underline}, so as [to
find]{.underline} their possible interplay; and aim to define viable
[confidence- and security-building measures]{.underline}. Ultimately,
informal [talks should contribute to unearthing opportunities for
renewed cooperation, and]{.underline} to developing mechanisms for
[averting confrontation]{.underline}.

At the same time, [any unofficial dialogue]{.underline} initiative [must
have realistic ambitions]{.underline}. It is highly unlikely that it
could affect or reconfigure the 'geopolitical triangle' (US-Russia,
US-China, Russia-China) on which so much depends, and thus to influence
those Arctic issues that are contingent on an improvement in big power
relations. Still, [Track II dialogue could **contribute**
in]{.underline} another way---[by **developing creative ideas** for
mitigating]{.underline} the practical [consequences of the lack of Track
I dialogue]{.underline}. These consequences are many; in the prevailing
atmosphere of zero-sum geopolitics, the Arctic governance system is on a
lose-lose trajectory, with mutually harmful consequences. The [lack of
constructive dialogue only **accelerates** that trend]{.underline}.

As a facilitator of dialogue between parties in disagreement with one
another, the mediator should come to the table not only with concrete
propositions, but also a set of incentives---in other words, a
compelling rationale as to why the protagonists should want to move away
from confrontation. [In the case of the Arctic, the sheer weight and
consequence of the issues that intersect there]{.underline} (for example
climate change, economic development, and the risk of conflict
spillover) [serve as a reminder of this region's
significance]{.underline} for the whole world, and the irreversibility
of certain problems if they are left unaddressed. Without a doubt,
[states have far more interests in common than reasons for
confrontation]{.underline}.

When [differences on fundamental matters]{.underline} of international
relations [prevent any convergence]{.underline} through [official
diplomacy]{.underline}, unofficial or '**[private'
diplomacy]{.underline}** [can serve as a discreet tool]{.underline}---a
deniable channel---[for discussing pressing issues that demand joint
attention. It can **protect** the participants **from public or media
scrutiny** and help them generate creative ideas that, in turn,
translate into viable policy options.]{.underline}

## 2NC Blocks 

### Solvency---Arctic---General 

#### Private, Track II diplomacy solves the plan---promotes communication and confidence building measure

Support in 2021, served as Project Manager in various roles at the

Law, International Relations, and International Policy Studies from the

Conclusion

Although the prevailing [geopolitical conditions do not augur well for
the near- to medium-term wellbeing]{.underline} of the Arctic, [there
are some openings and sources]{.underline} of hope that ought [to be
exploited through **quiet, private** diplomacy]{.underline}. [These are
to be found in the realms of security,]{.underline} the [environment,
economics and]{.underline}, perhaps most immediately, [scientific
cooperation.]{.underline}

This chapter has pointed to historical experience, and still-existing
pockets of cooperation, that together can serve as a model for efforts
to resume cooperation on the most pressing questions in the Arctic.
[Unofficial Track II dialogue can help identify ways to
build]{.underline} on these [educative]{.underline}
[examples]{.underline}, which [include emergency response]{.underline}
in the Bering Strait, [search and rescue operations]{.underline}, [and
collaboration on fisheries management]{.underline}.

As the above has shown, t[he Arctic is directly affected in multifarious
ways by the geopolitical schism]{.underline} over the war in Ukraine.
Apart from introducing new [and]{.underline} i[ncreasingly urgent
threats to security and the environment,]{.underline} it has also caused
something of a paralysis in governance, with no obvious replacement
architecture for managing West-Russia engagement on Arctic matters.
Moreover the current tendency to cut all ties between the West and
Russia is dangerous for the Arctic, and by extension for the global
environment.

Beyond the current crisis, [there is a longer-term challenge to find
ways to reshape Arctic governance so that it is not purely a framework
reflecting big power rivalry,]{.underline} and that progress is not
contingent on the quality of relations between those powers. [Perhaps a
greater role could be envisioned for other states, and certainly more
thinking should be done on how to compartmentalise issues]{.underline},
so that urgent threats in the Arctic are not sidelined while
geopolitical shocks elsewhere are addressed (or not).

[All of this points to a need and a niche for **'private diplomacy**' to
identify openings for constructive engagement, and to prepare ideas and
incentives]{.underline} that will help states to eventually reactivate
urgent collaboration. [Though constructive collaboration is unlikely to
resume in the near future]{.underline}, this chapter has illustrated
that [Track II diplomacy has a role in keeping the most
urgent]{.underline} threads of [communication alive, and bringing
creative options to the table]{.underline}.

Specifically, [Track II formats can help elaborate **confidence-building
measures** in the security sphere]{.underline}, and
[reconnect]{.underline} important [channels for scientific
exchanges]{.underline}. In such times of [deep distrust, geopolitical
collision, severed communications and tit-for-tat diplomatic
confrontation, often this type of unofficial dialogue]{.underline} [is
the most effective tool for maintaining]{.underline} some semblance of
[constructive dialogue and cooperation,]{.underline} and [for creating a
platform for the eventual resumption of official-level
diplomacy.]{.underline}

### Solvency---Generic 

#### Track II diplomacy is flexible, involves both outsiders and locals, and is focused on bringing change.

Affairs, University of Ottawa, "Track Two Diplomacy: The Way Forward",

We Need to Be Much More Rigorous in Defining What We are Doing and Why

Even though the field has devoted much effort over the years to defining
itself, there continue to be a variety of ways in which definitions
remain rather loose in their application. It is still necessary, for
example, to devote energy, both at the outset of a dialogue and
throughout its life, to defining whether one is engaged in a Track 1.5,
a Track 2 or a Track 3 effort and what that means in practice. §uhadar
reminds us that [we must examine critically our cognitive frames as we
embark upon such dialogues. Allen argues that it **is necessary to
consider carefully the extent to which an intervention should be led by
\"outside\" or \"local\" facilitators**. And the question of whether we
bias the management, resolution or transformation of conflicts through
our work is a serious issue,]{.underline} as Gamaghelyan reminds us.
These may seem obvious issues with which to occupy oneself as one
launches a dialogue, but they are tremendously important for
practitioners to grapple with. How one answers these questions has a
dramatic impact on what type of Track 2 one is running, what kind of
impact one wishes to have, and how one proposes to realize that impact
and why. As §uhadar finds, too often practitioners simply embark upon a
dialogue process without examining these issues. They simply operate on
the basis of unspoken and unexamined assumptions. Surely, a foundation
of best practice must be that [those who run such dialogues must
critically examine what they are doing and why. This is also the basic
proposition behind the model offered by Lengel and Jones: that
**practitioners need to reflect on their efforts in a way which is, at
the same time, both structured and flexible**, but that begins with
reflecting upon and outlining the basic assumptions they are taking into
the exercise.]{.underline} The field has been grappling with these
definitional issues for many years. Its understanding of their
importance has grown, as has its understanding of the various dimensions
of these matters. There is a rich literature from which to draw. As a
practical matter, there are few hard and fast answers to any specific
case. [Each **Track Two is so unique that it would be difficult to apply
hard and fast rules**]{.underline}. What Jones argues is that ethical
practice requires those who would undertake such dialogues to constantly
examine and re-examine their practices and motivations, both at the
beginning of the dialogue and as it unfolds.

We Need to Never Lose Sight of the Basics, Even as We Strive to Update
Them over Time

We must never lose sight of the fact that [what makes these kinds of
dialogues different from broader academic meetings is that they have
always focused on **bringing together influential people from the
conflict for facilitated dialogue aimed at producing actionable ideas
for change**]{.underline}. While critics are correct when they say that
the field has too often biased itself towards proposals aimed at Track 1
(and which are, therefore, biased towards elites), [**the key to the
field is that it seeks to use facilitated dialogue to help antagonists
develop ideas for change and get them to places where they can actually
matter.** The best practices checklist for transfer outlined by
d\'Estree and Fox is thus important across a wide variety of different
kinds of Track Two projects. How the different elements on their
checklist might be applied to different types of Track Two projects is
something that will vary across practic]{.underline}e. It is impossible
to preordain this as no two projects are the same. But [having such a
checklist as a tool, both at the outset of a dialogue and as it goes
along, is vital.]{.underline} Picking up on this idea of a checklist,
Lengel and Jones outline how such a tool is essential as a starting
point for any meaningful evaluation of what such a dialogue
accomplished. Their model, like the checklist provided by d\'Estree and
Fox, will vary in application, depending on the specifics of each
dialogue, but the framework is the key. It is intended to provide a
structured way of identifying and reflecting on the key issues and
questions which are unique to each intervention, both at the time and
over time.

### Solvency---Indigenous People 

#### Track II promotes cooperation with indigenous people in the Arctic

Perspective: Reflecting on the Obstacles and Opportunities for Renewing
Dialogue on the Arctic", Chapter from *The New Dynamics of Arctic
Governance* pg. 369-394, ResearchGate, 2025

The Importance of Inclusivity in Dialogue

In a number of forums and discussions about the Arctic---whether on
security, the environment, climate change, or
economics---[one]{.underline} constituency whose [voice is]{.underline},
regrettably, [often marginalised is]{.underline} that of [Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline} who are [native to the Arctic]{.underline} and
directly affected by regional or global political shocks.9 [A more
holistic and inclusive approach to such discussions]{.underline}---one
that takes into account the views and vast knowledge of local and
Indigenous communities---[would more likely produce positive and
sustainable results.]{.underline}

Along with its profound impact on other aspects of Arctic life, the war
in Ukraine has also eroded the role and contribution of Indigenous
Peoples to relevant international formats. [The Arctic Council is a
striking example]{.underline}; through this forum, [Indigenous
communities from Western states and from Russia had a fair opportunity
to have their concerns heard]{.underline} by all the eight Arctic
states. [Regrettably]{.underline} for them, and indeed for the whole
Council, [that platform no longer functions in the same way as a
dialogue between all Arctic states]{.underline} and their diverse
Indigenous communities.

[The]{.underline} sharpening of [geopolitical polarisation]{.underline}
since February 2022 [has accelerated]{.underline} some of the most acute
[problems that were already threatening the]{.underline} way of [life of
Indigenous Peoples, such as food insecurity, climate change, pollution,
and a deterioration of public health services]{.underline}. Moreover,
[Indigenous Peoples live at the epicenter of the tension between
preserving the surrounding environment and exploiting its untapped
economic potential]{.underline}. While new access to natural resources,
the opening of shipping routes and additional touristic areas, offer
exciting new opportunities for economic development, local communities
ought to be involved in determining how these openings are explored
(United Nations, 2008).

Among [many of the Indigenous Peoples of the Arctic,]{.underline}
post-February 2022 there is a sense that they [lack]{.underline} [an
adequate platform to convey the views of their
communities.]{.underline}10 To ensure that their concerns and interests,
but importantly also their unparalleled knowledge, wisdom and insight
are properly taken into account in international Arctic policy, [it is
important that **unofficial dialogue** efforts fill this gap, and
channel the perspectives and ideas of Indigenous Peoples'
representatives **to the policymaking level.**]{.underline} Again,
[Track II diplomacy can be a useful vehicle.]{.underline}

From the [perspective of Arctic States, and private actors too, it is
imperative]{.underline} that [robust]{.underline}
[modalities]{.underline} be [found for working with the peoples of the
Arctic, especially on environmental and climate change
issues]{.underline} that affect their lives and lands, and by extension
their countries. Apart from the obvious scientific and moral arguments[,
there is also a clear economic rationale; some rare earth minerals,
hydrocarbons and even uranium are to be found on Indigenous
land]{.underline}s and, from the socioeconomic perspective, [only an
equitable partnership between states and local communities can ensure a
sustainable and stable future for these areas]{.underline}.

#### Track II Diplomacy gives a platform for diplomacy with indigenous people on their terms.

Policy 1:

Restart Track 2 Diplomacy to Address Arctic Human Security Issues

[Restarting Track 2 diplomacy on Arctic human security issues will help
to foster a deeper understanding of the complex issues impacting
indigenous peoples in the Arctic, such as **sustainable resource
management, climate change, and preservation of traditional
practices**]{.underline}. [Track 2 and 1.5 initiatives provides a
platform **for dialogue, knowledge exchange, and promotes cross-cultural
understanding among indigenous communities, scientists, policymakers,
and civil society**. This enables stakeholders to develop innovative
solutions to challenges faced by indigenous peoples in the region,
especially in the face of the current limited cooperation in the Arctic
Council.]{.underline}

#### Track II Diplomacy is better suited to the Arctic, especially with respect to indigenous people.

3.2.3 Track II Diplomacy

Intellectual or [Track II diplomacy]{.underline}, a concept by many
names, [has been used for decades to infuence foreign
policy]{.underline}. Typically used to refer to informal events and
meetings between researchers, journalists, NGOs, concerned citizens, and
even current or former politicians, **[Track II diplomacy can help move
a confict toward resolution or a mutually benefcial
outcome]{.underline}**. Track II diplomacy, coined by Joseph Montville
in 1990, originally worked in tandem with Track I or traditional
diplomacy, and encompassed workshops meant to shift public opinion.
Think tanks embody the spirit of Track II diplomacy and are often
classifed as 'Track II organisations' (Homans, 2011). [Dialogues hosted
by **think tanks**]{.underline} are [frequently]{.underline} on topics
that [parallel government action]{.underline}, [but also **address
issues that are avoided or forgotten by states**.]{.underline} For now,
the sphere of [**Arctic** actors and **stakeholders remains a smaller
and more intimate community where connections and personal relationships
are especially important**]{.underline}. [The more **informal atmosphere
of think tank** conferences **allows for relationship building and an
unrestrained exchange of ideas**]{.underline}. Even connections between
nongovernmental and governmental actors are friendlier in other parts of
the world, lending to the almost 'Track 1.5' feeling of some Arctic
dialogues (Lanteigne, 2019). [Think tanks offer a space to **humanise
political issues**, especially concerning a region where **the
Indigenous peoples are the most affected** and most underrepresented
stakeholders]{.underline}. Recent years have seen a shift in both the
defnition of security and the actors who are identifying security
concerns. [With a growing number of problems]{.underline} under the
security umbrella, [including oil spills, resource exploitation and
village relocatio]{.underline}n, state governments are struggling to fnd
the time and the solutions to see to everything. Think tanks are able to
produce research and map potential scenarios that can fll in the lapses
in government attention**.**

### Solvency---Arctic Confrontation 

#### Track II solves Arctic confrontation---creates policy follow on

[Should geopolitical tensions]{.underline} continue to
[rise]{.underline} (in any of the bilateral relationships in the
US-China-Russia triangle), [the stage could be set for fierce big power
rivalry]{.underline} in the Arctic. Much depends on the outcome of the
war in Ukraine, and the trajectory of US-China relations in the years
ahead. As such, geopolitics will increasingly have an impact on the fate
of the Arctic, and while the big powers struggle to interact
constructively, the outlook is rather bleak.

[To avoid stumbling towards Thucydides' Trap, further thinking must be
done to identify]{.underline} '[guardrails' that can guide
state-to-state interactions and big power competition.]{.underline} For
those states that are geographically in the Arctic itself, this will
mean accepting that each of them will continue to defend its sovereign
territory---thus implying a strong military presence. In the current
circumstances, [this calls for urgent **work behind the scenes** to
prevent escalatory trends translating into miscommunication and
confrontation.]{.underline}

[Defining these guardrails through **informal dialogue** could help to
improve **predictability**]{.underline}, [avert escalation, and
**inject** creative ideas into **a policy landscape** that is currently
dominated by increasingly toxic official discourse]{.underline}. Now
that normal diplomatic engagement has dissipated, **[discreet
back-channel dialogue]{.underline}** [may be a useful contingency for
mitigating the associated dangers.]{.underline}

#### Track II promotes conflict avoidance---promote dialogue and avoid miscalculations

[Enhancing Mutual Confidence on Security]{.underline}

Despite the turbulent geopolitical landscape that underpins
international relations today, it is noteworthy that there is a
still-existing basis for [collaboration in the Arctic]{.underline}. In
that regard, [it is possible to build on those pockets of
cooperation]{.underline} that have not completely dissolved, which
include emergency response in the Bering Strait, search and rescue
operations, and collaboration on fisheries.

On security matters, it is another story, [given the rapid
militarisation]{.underline} of the region, [and]{.underline} the
[degrading]{.underline} of trust and official [communications
channels]{.underline} since the war in Ukraine. As such [it is
imperative to]{.underline} carefully [assess]{.underline} what
[methods]{.underline} may contribute [to decreasing military
tensions]{.underline} in the High North, possibly including the
elaboration of joint principles or 'rules of the road' between
adversaries. This may take the form of a military code of conduct, a set
of policy options for all sides, or another format. [Through an
impartial and skilled intermediary, tools can be developed to promote
reassurance rather than just deterrence]{.underline}, and [channels may
be established to manage tensions]{.underline}, as well as
[decrease]{.underline} the risk of [miscalculations and dangerous
incidents.]{.underline}

**[The High North Talks]{.underline}**, the [Track II dialogue
process]{.underline} facilitated by the Geneva Centre for Security
Policy, [aims to explore such options.]{.underline} While they appear
overly ambitious for the times, it may be that in the pursuit of such
outcomes, other [ideas emerge]{.underline} along the way [that can
be]{.underline} equally [helpful **in conflict-avoidance.**]{.underline}
[To define the scope of any such initiative, it is necessary to conduct
a stocktaking exercise that would]{.underline} (1)
[determine]{.underline} what
directives/[guidance]{.underline}/operational law already exist in this
domain; (2) [study]{.underline} other practices/[protocols that could be
applied to the Arctic]{.underline}, wholly [or]{.underline} partially;
(3) [identify gaps that still need to be addressed]{.underline}; (4)
[consider]{.underline} other good [examples]{.underline} (including from
different fields) [that could be applied to the Artic;]{.underline} (5)
[identify]{.underline} the distinctive [problems]{.underline} specific
to the region that would require a new approach.

In years past, [the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable (ASFR) was one
venue for such dialogue and ideas]{.underline} development. Since Russia
has not participated in the ASFR since its illegal annexation of Crimea
in 2014, in its current incarnation [the Roundtable is less a conflict
prevention tool than a coordination mechanism between the (Western)
Arctic allies.]{.underline} This has left an important gap in meaningful
dialogue on security matters between non-likemindeds, which [may be
filled at least partially through unofficial 'private
diplomacy]{.underline}'---ideally only temporarily, [until official
mechanisms for communication are once again properly
functioning]{.underline}.

A way forward

Geopolitical uncertainty is jeopardising years, if not decades, of
trust-building efforts amongst scientists and researchers across
countries, and directly impeding their work. The problems of the Arctic
have a direct connection with the rest of the world, and if not
addressed in a coordinated manner, may have harsh and irreversible
repercussions for global health and environmental equilibrium, not to
mention peace and stability. [With this in mind, the resumption of some
level of communication between relevant stakeholders on all sides of the
geopolitical divide is vital. There is no substitute for dialogue,
though in the short term it is unlikely to resume at the Track 1
level]{.underline}. As a fallback, [the informal High North
Talks]{.underline}, led Arctic Yearbook 2023 Diplomatic Deadlock in the
Arctic[:]{.underline} Science as an entry point to renewed dialogue 5

creative policy options aimed at addressing some of urgent problems in
the Arctic, and in sustaining unofficial communication links that help
avoid damaging misunderstandings. Whatever the geopolitical fallout from
the war in Ukraine, it is imperative that an accommodation be found to
jointly address the most pressing of the Arctic's challenges, which are
long-term and global in nature, and in some cases irreversible if left
unattended]{.underline}.

### Solvency---Conflict---Generic 

#### Other types of diplomacy fail -- interests, power and tensions prove.

The international relations landscape is becoming more intricate, and
traditional [diplomatic efforts are often inadequate in dealing with
long-lasting problems such as economic instability, two-state conflict,
cyber threats, transnational terrorism, climate change, etc. These
**issues transcend national borders and require global cooperation**,
yet the **international system is often hindered by competing national
interests, asymmetrical power dynamics, and geopolitical
tensions**]{.underline}. [**Traditional diplomacy**, grounded in
state-to-state negotiations and treaties, **struggles to address such
complex, long-lasting problems**]{.underline} (Harry, 2023). For
[example]{.underline}, the [Syrian civil wa]{.underline}r has been
prolonged due to the [involvement of multiple state and non-state actors
with conflicting agendas, rendering peace talks ineffective]{.underline}
(Sosnowski, 2020). Similarly, [climate change negotiations]{.underline},
like the Paris Agreement, have been [stymied by the conflicting economic
interests]{.underline} of developed and developing nations, (Carlson et
al., 2021). Thus, the international relations landscape is becoming more
intricate, making traditional diplomatic efforts often inadequate in
dealing with problems in the international community. [Track-Two
diplomacy]{.underline}, which refers to informal and non-governmental
discussions involving powerful private citizens, academics, and former
officials, [has become an **essential complement** to official
diplomatic endeavors in this particular situation]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, the [extent]{.underline} to which Track-Two activities are
integrated and effective in resolving conflicts has not been well
examined and is [not fully utilized]{.underline}, creating a [notable
deficiency in current international relations.]{.underline} Track-Two
diplomacy encounters various obstacles, such as concerns regarding its
legality, the need for collaboration with Track-One (official
government) diplomacy, and the ability to demonstrate tangible effects
on conflict settlement (Omeje and Nwaoha, 2021). The casual style of
Track-Two diplomacy may give rise to doubt regarding its credibility and
long-term viability. Furthermore, the interaction between Track-One and
Track-Two participants is frequently characterized by friction, as
government diplomats may view non-state entities as intruding on their
territory or weakening formal negotiations (Omeje and Nwaoha, 2021)

State actors have historically been in charge of international
relations, which involves navigating the complicated world of
international politics through formal talks, treaties, and diplomatic
channels. However, new strategies for diplomacy are required due to the
dynamic character of international conflicts and the growing
interdependence of nations (Nicholson, 2002). One such strategy is known
as "[Track-Two diplomacy," which is an unofficial, non-governmental
avenue for dialogue and discussion that supports official diplomatic
initiatives]{.underline}, or "Tracker-One diplomacy." In order to
resolve disputes and promote peace, [academics, retired officials,
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), religious leaders, and other
powerful people participate in conversation and problem-solving
exercises known as Track-Two diplomacy]{.underline} (Onditi, 2023).
Track-Two diplomacy originated during the Cold War due to the
limitations of regular diplomatic channels caused by inflexible
ideologies and mutual distrust (Ahmad, 2023). [Informal discussions
serve as a crucial forum for the exploration of innovative solutions and
the establishment of mutual understanding, free from public scrutiny and
political influences (]{.underline}Akindoyin, 2024a). This type of
diplomacy [functions based on the concept that individuals and groups
that are not part of the official government structures can help with
communication, build trust, and provide new and creative ideas that
official channels may not consider or are unable to pursue because of
political limitations]{.underline} (Akindoyin and Akuche, 2024).
Track-Two diplomacy is [essential for resolving conflicts as it
**creates an environment for more adaptable and transparent
dialogues**]{.underline} (Omeje and Nwaoha, 2021). It enables
participants to delve into delicate matters [without the concern of
immediate political consequences, hence facilitating more open and
productive discussions]{.underline}. Informal diplomacy frequently acts
as a preliminary step or supplement to formal negotiations, aiding in
the moderation of positions, the resolution of misconceptions, and the
establishment of the initial consensus required for official discussions
to be successful (D'Estree and Fox, 2020). Track-Two initiatives have
the [potential to **overcome impasses and generate prospects for peace
that may be unattainable only through conventional diplomatic channels
by tackling fundamental problems and grievances in a less formal
environmen**t]{.underline} (Omeje and Nwaoha, 2021). In addition,
Track-Two diplomacy utilizes the knowledge and ethical influence of a
wide range of individuals and organizations. Academic professionals
provide their profound understanding of the current concerns, while
former diplomats and military personnel offer practical expertise and
credibility. Non-governmental organizations ([NGOs) and civil society
organizations play a crucial role in offering viewpoints from the local
level and rallying support within communities for peace
initiatives]{.underline}. However, [religious and community leaders
frequently have the **confidence and respect of their communities**,
which allows them to **bridge gaps** and **promote reconciliation** on a
**societal scale**]{.underline}. [Track-Two]{.underline} diplomacy is an
important advancement in international relations, particularly in a
world where conflicts are becoming more intricate and diverse. It
[enhances traditional diplomacy by providing alternate methods for
resolving conflicts, promoting conversation and comprehension, and
ultimately helping to the establishment of a more peaceful and
collaborative global system]{.underline} (Palmiano, 2021). Thus, with
the exploration of track one diplomacy and track two diplomacy above, it
is important to note the clear distinction between track two diplomacy
and two track diplomacy. While Track two diplomacy denotes the informal,
nongovernmental dialogue and conflict resolution efforts between private
individuals, academics, NGOs, or civil society actors who are not
official government representatives, two track diplomacy denotes the
simultaneous use of both Track One (official, government-led diplomacy)
and Track Two (informal, non-governmental) diplomacy (Fon and Achiri,
2021). In TwoTrack diplomacy, the official and unofficial efforts work
in tandem. Track one focuses on formal negotiations between governments
or official actors, while Track Two engages informal 6 Perspective
Politice channels to complement or support the official process by
creating dialogue, reducing tensions, and fostering mutual

Introduction

In the decades since the end of the Cold War, science has regularly been
depicted as an entry point to dialogue aimed at alleviating political
conflict or diplomatic tensions. [Science is after all not politics; it
is a universal good, a common language, and a shared value; moreover, it
is grounded in widely-agreed fact rather than opinion, which means
that - at least in theory - it is less prone to ideological
influence.]{.underline} Even during the Cold War, [science diplomacy
helped to maintain threads of communication across ideological divides,
and provided the vehicle and substance for dialogue]{.underline} (see
for example Davis & Patman (eds), 2015). [**Thanks to science diplomacy,
despite geopolitical tensions the superpowers were able to find common
groun**d and work together where they perceived a mutual interest or a
shared threat.]{.underline} Convergence around the language of science
may have helped them to avert an even greater rupture, and perhaps more
dangerous escalations. Arctic Yearbook 2023 Dziatkowiec 2 Regrettably
today's geopolitical climate appears to be less amenable to constructive
exchange and joint, pragmatic problem-solving. [Russia's brutal attack
on Ukraine triggered an enormous counterreaction that has led to the
severing of West-Russia communications on multifarious international
issues and in various regions, including the High North]{.underline}. As
such, the Arctic is fast becoming a new theatre for great power
politics. The recent sharpening of geopolitical tensions introduces new
unknown variables into the international security landscape, and affects
a broad gamut of issues on which West-Russia coordination was once taken
for granted, including science. [**Without constructive
communicatio**n - which has almost completely ceased - **there are risks
that misunderstandings, miscalculations, or simple neglect may lead to
an environmental disaster** or a dangerous new conflagration. In the
absence of an adequate forum for addressing the urgent threats facing
the Arctic, in 2022 the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP)
launched a discreet dialogue process, the 'High North Talks', which has
met regularly since]{.underline}. [**The Talks offer an informal
platform for discussing** - in a neutral setting - **the threats and
challenges, potential solutions, and possible areas of renewed
cooperation in the Arctic**]{.underline}. [Attendees include experts
from states with a stake in the region]{.underline} - Arctic Council
members (including Russia), as well as other actors like China, the EU,
Japan and India. In the context of Russia's attack on Ukraine, the High
North Talks explore how Arctic affairs could be managed more effectively
in spite of the geopolitical turbulence. The Talks constitute one of the
few remaining venues where representatives from the countries most
invested in the Arctic can meet, in a safe and discreet environment, to
discuss the future of this region. One of the most urgent topics is the
need to restore some meaningful cooperation between the West and Russia,
at least on the most pressing issues like climate change monitoring.
While the rationale for the West's response to Russian aggression in
Ukraine is clear and understood, it is crucial that ways be found -
perhaps through policies that allow for targeted coordination in
'exceptional' cases - to manage ongoing problems of global significance

1/2 The unique potential of the Arctic as a point of potential
cooperation between the U.S. and Russia was the subject of an event,
"2025 Russia-U.S. Relations: Can Arctic Science Diplomacy Mend Strategic
Fences?", hosted by the Arctic Initiative at Harvard's Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs and the Davis Center for Russian and
Eurasian Studies. Cooperation on the Arctic between Russia and the U.S.
was one of the many casualties of Russia's full-scale invasion of
Ukraine in 2022. Arctic Initiative senior fellow Margaret Williams noted
at the beginning of the discussion that Russia's invasion and the nearly
three years of war that have followed have had a profound impact on
Ukraine's natural heritage. "Ukrainian people have suffered so deeply,
and Ukrainian natural areas, and the environment have suffered terribly
as well," Williams told the event, which took place on Dec. 5, 2024.
Moving on to the Arctic, Williams said some scientific studies indicate
that the area is warming three to four times faster than the rest of the
world, which in turn is causing a disastrous ripple effect, from
disrupted weather patterns to vanishing permanent sea ice, thawing
permafrost and rising sea levels. "[These are critical problems, and
Russia is key to solving them,"]{.underline} Williams said. Williams
reminded the event's audience that "Russia occupies half of the Arctic
coastline, more than half of the northern hemisphere\'s permafrost
occurs in Arctic in the Russian Arctic." Russia is inextricably bound up
in the critical problems facing the Arctic; however, Williams worries
that the rift between Russia and the West will only grow. Williams
highlighted the Bering Sea, the northern stretch of the Pacific Ocean
located between Russia's far east coast and Alaska, as the place where
"challenges are coming together." It is "a place where we share
tremendous cultural heritage, where people have been living for
thousands of years, where fish stocks are shared where wildlife migrates
back and forth. They don\'t pay attention to the boundaries. They don\'t
pay attention to the war," Williams said. "How can we move ahead at this
very, very difficult time ... finding ways to think of the long term
future and our own survival?" Russian marine biologist Masha Vorontsova,
founder of the Russia Office of the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, also spoke at the event , sharing her personal experience and
recent experience traveling to Russia. She [emphasized the vital role of
Track 2 diplomacy within the scientific community. "We should think of
track 2 right when cooperation is not possible at the level of the
government, when there \[are\] no dialogues between the diplomats. When
it was completely impossible to reach any agreements, we should think
about our contacts among civil society, among scientists, and try to
build on these contacts]{.underline}," Vorontsova said. 2/2 According to
Vorontsova, [5,000 or so scientists]{.underline} who signed a letter
against the war in Ukraine shortly after the full-scale invasion began
have found themselves on an unofficial blacklist. During her summer 2024
trip to Russia, she noticed that [Russians are constructing "bubbles" in
which to live and function, both at the familial and professional level.
"Scientists are building ... bubbles,"]{.underline} Vorontsova said[. "I
had been to several institutions. And it was like the 1980s when
everybody \[is\] actively working, because that was the small corner of
freedom to be in your lab in your institution and work." She stressed
the importance of reaching out to the Russian scientific community to
keep making holes in a new Iron Curtain.]{.underline} "If we\'re
speaking of collaboration, my suggestion is, look ... to the scientists
inside Russia whom you trust," Vorontsova said. "Pick them up, work with
them, exchange emails, make Zooms, invite them to participate in Zooms.
Invite them also out of Russia, try to get them to the conferences."
Pavel Devyatkin of the Institute of the Arctic agreed, but argued that
"there is no sweeping ban on cooperation from the side of the Kremlin."
"I agree with what Masha mentioned about holding on to small bubbles,
and [how important it is to still work with Russian scientists and
continue to invite Russians to participate in conferences and
projects,"]{.underline} Devyatkin said in a comment. ["There\'s a whole
generation of young Russian scientists who are interested in Arctic
cooperation."]{.underline} Marisol Maddox, a senior Arctic Policy fellow
at Dartmouth College's Institute of Arctic Studies, spoke to the
difficulty of re-building cooperative mechanisms once they've been
broken down. "We\'ve seen that if you lose a cooperative mechanism, [if
you kick Russia out of something, or Russia fully leaves a body, it\'s
much harder to then build back that basic cooperative
mechanism]{.underline} as opposed to something like the Arctic Council,
which I think has really masterfully handled the situation with Russia
in the Arctic," Maddox said. Maddox then [outlined some potential areas
for Track 2 cooperation of Western countries with Russia on the
Arctic.]{.underline} "How do we [promote cooperation]{.underline}? That
is [also respecting the safety concerns of our Russian colleagues in
Russia, because of the constraints that they are also dealing with from
the Putin regime," Maddox said. "But things like fisheries, permafrost
monitoring, biosecurity and pandemic prevention, radioactivity and the
whole kind of nuclear legacy of waste these are areas where it\'s really
in our interest to be working together." Despite the extreme low point
of U.S.-Russian relations, climate change and its effects on the Arctic
will continue to impact both the U.S. and Russia. "Russia has pretty
extensive exposure to climate hazards as well, and really needs this
cooperation]{.underline}," Maddox said. "But we all need this
cooperation."

### Solvency---Environment 

#### Track II dialogue promotes environmental cooperation in the Arctic

Perspective: Reflecting on the Obstacles and Opportunities for Renewing
Dialogue on the Arctic", Chapter from *The New Dynamics of Arctic
Governance* pg. 369-394, ResearchGate, 2025

Averting an Environmental Catastrophe

Separately but just as urgently, [Track II dialogue ought to investigate
the possibilities of resuming cooperation on environmental protection.
The Arctic is]{.underline} in many ways something of [a microcosm
of]{.underline} [the global environment,]{.underline} in that it
directly connects to and influences the most fundamental dynamics of the
earth system (climate, ocean currents, and others).

Given the global reach of the environmental crisis, [it is imperative
that science be freed from **political**]{.underline} and ideological
[frameworks]{.underline}. [The global character of the threat should
drive an international consciousness,]{.underline} and eventual
convergence, around obvious mutual threats and therefore interests. [If
and when that happens]{.underline}, [science could produce the most
compelling incentives to restart trust-building and
collaboration]{.underline}. Accordingly[,]{.underline} the
[environmental theme could become an '**anchor'** for Track II
dialogue]{.underline} that aims t[o restore some measure of
mutually-beneficial engagement.]{.underline}

Indeed '[science diplomacy' has historically proven to be an
indispensable tool for promoting renewed international
cooperation]{.underline}, notably by persuading policymakers to make
informed decisions based on hard evidence. During the Cold War, [science
diplomacy helped maintain communication across ideological
divides]{.underline}, and it provided the rationale and methodology for
continuing dialogue (see for example Davis & Patman (eds), 2015).

There are a number of channels through which science diplomacy on Arctic
matters is conducted, at multilateral and national levels. Apart from
the already-mentioned Arctic Council, they include the United Nations
(and within it the UN Environment Programme; the World Meteorological
Organization; and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization, to name a few), the Association of Polar Early
Career Scientists, the University of the Arctic, International Science
Council, International Arctic Science Committee, and GlobalArctic.

In the current geopolitical deadlock, [science diplomacy may help
impress upon decision-makers]{.underline} the notion [that environmental
crisis will not wait for political tensions to be resolved;]{.underline}
and accordingly that [collaboration between scientists should not be
equated with or dependent on trust between their
governments]{.underline}. Relatedly, the principle of '[open science'
can play a vital role in the Arctic;]{.underline} in acknowledging that
the problems of our planet do not respect sovereign borders, it
[encourages knowledge sharing, collaboration, and transparency among
researchers, indigenous communities, policymakers, and other
stakeholders]{.underline} (UNESCO, 2021).

[Re-establishing mutual acknowledgment]{.underline} of the universal
importance [of open science]{.underline} would allow for monitoring to
again occur in real time, which in turn [would facilitate early warning,
climate modelling, and adaptation strategies]{.underline} (Dziatkowiec,
2023). Critically, many of these important functions have been
discontinued over the Ukraine war, which harms not only the Arctic but
also other parts of the world affected by the knock-on effects of
climatic conditions in the Arctic.

Given the global impacts of this emergency, a failure to collectively
address climate change will be potentially catastrophic for all states.
It is worth recalling, also, that environmental problems in the Arctic
span well beyond the climate crisis; they include a range of other
pressing issues including threats to biodiversity, ocean acidification,
the introduction of new invasive species, and the permafrost thaw-carbon
emission cycle, among others.

Other themes worth examining in [a Track II format include the
environment-economic development nexus, and the role of the Arctic in
contributing to global food security]{.underline}. In addition,
solutions are needed to manage [the dangers associated with the
emergence of possibly dangerous pathogens]{.underline} (including
viruses) [from]{.underline} the melting [permafrost]{.underline} (Cohen,
2023), and the spread of radioactive waste (Miner et al., 2021). These
are just two examples of risks that will persist and potentially
undermine global safety and health, whether the war in Ukraine is
resolved or not.

Taking the latter issue further, there are thousands of radioactive
objects---including spent fuel and corroding nuclear reactors inside
sunken vessels---that were left abandoned at the bottom of the Arctic
seas during the Cold War. Today, [political tensions and international
sanctions hinder any retrieval and clean-up efforts as Russia lacks the
equipment and technical expertise to extract these vessels without
international assistance]{.underline} (Digges, 2022).

#### Track II hazard waste spills in the Arctic

Paul **Dziatkowiec 25**, appointed Director of Mediation and Peace
Support in 2021, served as Project Manager in various roles at the
Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (HD), Master's degrees in International
Law, International Relations, and International Policy Studies from the
Australian National University, the University of New South Wales, and
the University of Sydney respectively, Bachelor's degree in
International Business from Queensland University, "A Mediator's
Perspective: Reflecting on the Obstacles and Opportunities for Renewing
Dialogue on the Arctic", Chapter from *The New Dynamics of Arctic
Governance* pg. 369-394, ResearchGate, 2025

One possible method for [restarting a culture of
cooperation,]{.underline} and for testing whether [compartmentalisation
may work in the Arctic context]{.underline}, would be to agree [a small
pilot project that has relatively limited political
consequence,]{.underline} but [offers a clear mutual
benefit]{.underline} to all involved states. [A carefully selected joint
undertaking may imply small political cost]{.underline}--- certainly it
would not influence the course of the war in Ukraine, nor the balance of
power in the region---[but may bring **serious benefits** to the local
and surrounding environment.]{.underline}

An example of such a project could be [the extraction of hazardous waste
from sunken vessels in the Arctic Sea, which could be 'ring-fenced' as a
mutually-important exception to the current freeze in West-Russia
cooperation]{.underline}.8 [The severe impact that radioactive
contamination can have on the environment is undeniable.]{.underline} It
can harm plant and animal life, disrupt ecosystems, and potentially
impact human health through the consumption of contaminated food and
water. As such, the idea of resuming a discussion on extracting the
sunken vessels and their radioactive waste is one tangible and
universally valuable project that could prove the worth of decoupling
certain issues---even if only on an exceptional basis---from the
situation of the war in Ukraine.

There are a number of comparable ideas that may be worth testing with
policymakers, to assess the political appetite on all sides. But while
the needs are obvious, one major stumbling block is that for as long as
Arctic issues are viewed predominantly through a geopolitical prism,
there is unlikely to be meaningful progress. Given these realities, it
is useful for the mediator to imagine different constructs (for example,
new lead actors, or atypical groupings of states) that are issue-focused
rather than geopolitically driven. For example, a [new role could be
crafted for certain middle powers as champions for Arctic
governance,]{.underline} or even for other actors--- organisations and
coalitions---t[o do more to shield the Arctic from the collateral harm
of the geopolitical contest.]{.underline}

[Ultimately Track II dialogue must aim, through robust exchanges and
creative thinking, to produce actionable policy options]{.underline}. Of
course, whether it has any subsequent impact will depend on the
political will of relevant states to buy into any new initiative. [A
crucial aspect of the transmission of ideas to the decision-making level
is to also present clear incentives for adopting any course of action.
The most convincing of these incentives would surely be the realisation
that a new policy direction may help minimise existential risks and
avoid a dangerous escalation---an outcome that benefits all states and
their peoples]{.underline}.

### Track II Avoids Politics 

#### Track II diplomacy avoid drawbacks of track I diplomacy, including political consequences

//GBH

[What makes Track II Unique?]{.underline} The success of Track II
diplomacy in very contentious conflicts and delicate negotiations
springs from its unique character, which distinguishes it from
traditional diplomacy. Specifically, Track II:

• **[Avoids political grandstanding]{.underline}**. Because Track II
activities are often convened by NGOs and do not involve high-ranking
government individuals acting in an official capacity, [**there is
little need for the actors to focus on scoring political points** during
the discussions.]{.underline} The dialogue allows for deep exploration
of conflict drivers, and strategy for changing the current political
environment.

• **[Prepares the ground for official talks]{.underline}**. Track II has
a role in augmenting official diplomatic talks by identifying areas of
potential common ground before official talks start (or even
concurrently with official talks). The [initial discussions can help
official actors focus on areas that are most important to the parties of
a conflict, decide where there is common ground, and where negotiation
should begin among top-level actors.]{.underline}

• **[Recognizes all parties to a conflict]{.underline}**. Often
extremists, spoilers, and [armed groups are more willing to engage in
dialogue on an unofficial level]{.underline} than they are to take part
in an official political process. The ability of Track II to bring those
groups to the negotiating table is important to create lasting peace.

• **[Detects and evaluates conflict]{.underline}**. Once peace
agreements have been made, there is often the risk that violence can
return. [Because Track II practitioners are plugged into local networks,
they can detect the early-warning signs of renewed
conflict.]{.underline} [This allows for faster and more accurate
reporting of conflicts to official actors, enabling a speedier
response.]{.underline}

fear of losing constituencies because they are the

economically, and politically disenfranchised groups by giving them a
platform from which they can air their views on how peace can be
achieved in their own communities or nations. Fourth, Track Two is
effective both at the pre-violent conflict and post violent conflict
stages; therefore it is a very effective tool for violent conflict
prevention and post-conflict peacebuilding. Fifth, [Track Two involves

The principle of Open Science

An argument can be made that impeding science is equivalent to
restricting academic freedom and free speech within science. Moreover,
in a time of diplomatic tension a clear line should be drawn between
trust between scientists and trust between governments; while the latter
focus on matters of state, including security, scientists bear the vital
responsibility of finding solutions for the longterm wellbeing of the
planet. [Their work requires establishing facts, which demands
sustainable dialogue and cooperation, whatever the (geo)political
climate. In other words, there is a greater good, even a social
responsibility in 'ringfencing' this essential pursuit from the vagaries
of politics]{.underline}. In that context, [**science diplomacy is a
valuable tool for reopening dialogue on issues of common interest**, and
for enabling policymakers to better understand Arctic processes,
ecosystems, and environmental changes and to make informed decisions
based on evidence]{.underline}. '[**Open science' plays a vital role in
the Arctic**; it encourages knowledge sharing, collaboration, and
transparency among researchers, Indigenous communities, policymakers,
and other stakeholders]{.underline} (UNESCO, 2021). Through open
science, [**monitoring can occur in real time**, which constitutes the
basis for **early warning, climate modelling, and adaptation
strategies.**]{.underline} Critically, [these important functions have
been discontinued over the Ukraine war, which harms not only the Arctic
but also other parts of the world affected by the knock-on effects of
climatic conditions in the Arctic]{.underline}. Perhaps most
importantly, by focusing on shared scientific goals and objectives and
addressing common global challenges, scientists can transcend political
differences and work together towards a common purpose. In turn, abiding
by the principle of open science, scientists can pool their expertise
and resources to develop sustainable and impactful solutions that
transcend national boundaries. Reviving this sense of common purpose
requires a political choice to decouple geopolitical tensions (as least
on an exceptional basis) from the principle of open science.

162). Montville emphasized that Track Two Diplomacy is not a substitute
for Track One Diplomacy, but compensates for the constraints imposed on
leaders by their people's psychological expectations. Most important,
Track Two Diplomacy is intended to provide a bridge or complement
official Track One negotiations (Nan, 2004; Agha, Feldman, Khalidi,
Schiff, 2003). Examples of Track Two organisations are Search for Common
Ground, West African Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP), European Centre
for Conflict Prevention (ECCP), and many others. Strengths of Track Two
Diplomacy -- The strengths of Track Two Diplomacy have been discussed in
detail, but separately by Montville (1991), Ury (1999), Sanders (1991),
Ryan (1995), and Lederach (1997). First, [[Track Two parties are **not
inhibited by political or constitutional
power**]{.mark}**;**]{.underline} therefore, they can express their own
viewpoints on issues that directly affect their communities and
families. Second, Track Two officials do not have the fear of losing
constituencies because they are the constituency. Third, Track two
empowers the socially, economically, and politically disenfranchised
groups by giving them a platform from which they can air their views on
how peace can be achieved in their own communities or nations. Fourth,
Track Two is effective both at the pre-violent conflict and post violent
conflict stages; therefore it is a very effective tool for violent
conflict prevention and post-conflict peacebuilding. Fifth, Track Two
involves grassroots and middle leadership who are in direct contact with
the conflict. Sixth, Track Two is not affected by electoral cycles.

###  Exts. Track II v. Track I 

#### Track two dialogue is distinct from track one

But the term Track 2 is used in a narrower context as well, with
reference to a particular form of dialogue activity associated, during
the 1990s, with the promotion of cooperative security and multilateral
security regionalism. **[Paul Evans refers to this form of Track 2
activity as "blended" dialogues "involving meetings of academics,
journalists, and occasionally politicians and also ... government
officials]{.underline}** ... attending **[in their 'unofficial' or
'private' capacities]{.underline}**".17 The key components of Track 2
diplomacy are meetings organized to engage participants from several
countries in discussions concerning security issues of mutual concern.
These have come to be called multilateral "security dialogues". Here**[,
the term "dialogue" is used to distinguish such meetings from the
"negotiations" of Track 1 officials.]{.underline}** Simultaneously they
strive to be inclusive---that is, to engage parties from contending
perspectives---and non-confrontational. Their goal is to achieve a
mutual understanding of perceived threats and security goals. As such,
they do not tend toward highly technical or scientific treatments of
weapons systems and the like but seek to identify new perspectives,
develop innovative solutions, and advance confidence and security
building mechanisms (CSBMs).

When former U.S. diplomat Joseph Montville first used the term "Track
Two" diplomacy in 1982, he referred to "an unofficial, informal
interaction between members of adversary groups or nations that aims to
develop strategies, influence public opinion, and organize human and
material resources in ways that might help to resolve their conflict."
According to one of our interviewees, Track Two diplomacy assists
government officials "by exploring possible solutions out of public view
and without the requirements to formally negotiate or bargain for
advantage." Over the past few decades, a variety of perspectives on
nontraditional diplomacy have arisen, including the Institute for
Multilateral Diplomacy's eight track wheel which promotes a variety of
non-traditional strategies including business, faith groups, and
professional conflict resolution efforts. In short, while [Track One
diplomacy]{.underline}, or traditional diplomacy[, is defined as those
official relations between governments,]{.underline} Track Two
acknowledges that domestic factors like religion and ethnicity can
inherently change where power lies and that non-governmental actors can
be important influencers of society. Consequently, for the purposes of
this Report, [Track Two refers to any diplomatic effort]{.underline} of
a decidedly political nature [where **at least one of the parties is not
a government agency.**]{.underline} As this report is focused on
faith-based Track Two diplomacy, some examples include: a faith-based
organization working on development projects in partnership with a
national government, a NGO privately working with a national government
on behalf of religious freedom, adversarial governments turning to third
party religious actors to mediate conflict, and religious groups
engaging in peacebuilding outside traditional government channels. Based
on our interviews and research, there are a number of key points to be
made with regards to the promise and limitations of Track Two diplomacy.
The most essential is for whom they are working: government officials'
primary job is to safeguard and extend the interests of their home
government whereas Track Two diplomats often cite a spiritual vocation
or religious calling for their work. Moreover, Track Two diplomats have
a variety of tools available to them that are distinct from the tools
and methods of traditional state-to----particularly those unique to
faith-based mediators---will be discussed below.

USIP experts look at the increasing use of track 1.5 and [track 2
dialogues to address global challenges]{.underline}. If you asked
someone to [define diplomacy, chances are they would describe two
governments meeting, shaking hands, sitting at a table, and negotiating
an official agreement. But that more traditional view of diplomacy is
only one iteration, often called track 1 diplomacy]{.underline}.
Diplomacy can occur in a number of forms, or "tracks," that engage
various participants, from academics to policymakers to heads of state.
[In an increasingly complex global environment, peacebuilders and
diplomats looking to address difficult policy challenges are
increasingly incorporating]{.underline} track 1.5 and [track 2
dialogues]{.underline}---often referred to as ["back channel"
diplomacy]{.underline}---into their strategies. What exactly do these
alternate forms of diplomacy look like in practice? Track 1.5 dialogues
are conversations that include a mix of government officials---who
participate in an unofficial capacity---and non-governmental experts,
all sitting around the same table. [On the other hand, track 2 diplomacy
brings together unofficial representatives on both sides, with no
government participation. Neither track 1.5 nor track 2 discussions
carry the official weight of traditional diplomacy, as they are not
government-to-government meetings. What they offer is a private, open
environment for individuals to build trust, hold conversations that
their official counterparts sometimes cannot or will not, and discuss
solutions]{.underline}. Ultimately, such [multi-track diplomacy can
serve many purposes: it can help to incorporate grassroots and civil
society participation when these groups have otherwise been
excluded;]{.underline} it can support peace processes; it can maintain a
channel of communication when officials are not speaking to each other;
and it can be used as a [forum for discussing tough policy issues that
two or more countries are trying to address]{.underline}. USIP experts
with experience in track 1.5 and track 2 diplomacy discuss what accounts
for the use of these two tracks, the strengths of these approaches, and
what success means. What is behind the seemingly growing use of track
1.5 and track 2 diplomacy? Johnny Walsh: To some degree, this reflects
the fact that many gatherings that have always occurred---academic
exchanges, for example---now often receive the track 2 label. A
weightier reason, though, is the seeming [proliferation of intractable
civil wars, transnational security challenges, and other conflicts
around the world, which official diplomacy has struggled to resolve.
Peace agreements that formally end wars have, by most measures, become
rarer since the 1990s. A growing number of civil wars seem to drag on
indefinitely---]{.underline} as in many cases do the official diplomatic
efforts to resolve them. A variety of informal mediators have stepped
into this perceived void, often in cooperation with private individuals
who are close to the various rivals and belligerents, but "unofficial"
enough to speak freely. 2/3 This can be a powerful combination, [even if
there are almost always limits to what track 1.5 and track 2 discussions
can accomplish before governments and other "official" leaders must take
over. There are enough examples of breakthroughs that started with track
1.5 or track 2 dialogues---from the Oslo Accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, to the resolution of the Tajikistan civil war, to smaller
advances on, say, the North Korea or India-Pakistan
conflicts]{.underline}---to make this tool increasingly relevant and
popular. [What are the strengths of track 1.5 and track 2
dialogues?]{.underline} Jennifer Staats: First, let's look at the
strengths of track 1.5 dialogues. They provide a platform for government
officials to discuss sensitive issues in their personal capacity, where
they can go beyond government talking points and explore new ideas
without fear that their comments will be made public. These closed-door
discussions help policymakers better understand the motivations and
interests of the other actors and get a clearer sense of how their
policy initiatives are perceived by their foreign counterparts. Track
1.5 dialogues also provide an opportunity to solicit feedback on "trial
balloon" policy ideas and alternative approaches, so that they can be
refined and improved before they feed into the official policy process.
Perhaps most importantly, in the event that official track 1 talks break
down, track 1.5 platforms provide a valuable channel through which
policymakers can continue to share views in a private and unofficial
setting. Regarding the [strengths of track 2 dialogues: Although
government officials do not participate, this framework also allows for
deeper understanding of positions and perceptions, as experts outside of
government are able to share their independent and personal views in
ways that can later feed into the policy process. In most cases, these
participants are familiar with the positions of their respective
governments, but are not necessarily expected to assume or defend those
policy positions in the dialogue. The absence of government officials
can sometimes lead to more open discussions, with a greater likelihood
of breaking through a difficult impasse than would be likely if
officials were in the room. Further, track 2 dialogues can construct a
secondary channel of communication that can help build trust between the
same group of participants over a period of years.]{.underline} Both
track 1.5 and track 2 dialogues are most successful when they have some
connection to the formal policy process. To increase the utility of
track 1.5 and track 2 dialogues, government participants should take
what they have learned back to their respective agencies, and
non-government participants should be encouraged to share their insights
with government officials. [What does track]{.underline} 1.5 and [track
2 diplomacy look like in practice and how do you define
success?]{.underline} 3/3 Rosarie Tucci: [Track 2 processes provide
unofficial spaces and flexible settings to test ideas and shape
relationships.]{.underline} Such efforts can be critical to advancing
negotiations when parties are not yet committed to a process, or during
negotiations when parties are stuck and looking for alternative ideas to
overcome an impasse. There is wide variation in how this form of
diplomacy materializes in practice. Track 1.5 and track 2 dialogues
often look different depending upon the stage of the conflict (e.g.,
preventive, pre-negotiation, negotiation, post-conflict) and the level
of participants (e.g., civil society leaders, quasi-government
officials). The [objectives outlined by the dialogues may also differ,
as some are more focused on relationship building while others take a
problemsolving or outcome-driven approach]{.underline}, such as
establishing a draft agreement, joint statement, or new proposal. In any
instance, to be able to define success in track 1.5 and track 2
dialogues, it is important to be clear about the objectives and keep
them within achievable limits. [Track 2 processes that tend to be more
successful often sequence objectives at different phases of the dialogue
or upon changing country context and conflict dynamics.]{.underline} For
example, a track 1.5 or track 2 process may begin by creating a platform
for the opening of future negotiations, and then evolve into framing for
those same negotiations. More successful track 2 processes consider the
importance of diverse stakeholders, work to fill in the gaps of the
larger peace effort, and address power asymmetry among participants.
They'll also manage expectations across participants, and---increasingly
important--- establish and implement what are called "transfer"
mechanisms. In other words, the influential participants within a track
2 dialogue and the official mediators of the peace process can often
serve as effective transfer channels, exchanging information and ideas
developed within the groups to more formal processes, for example with
official actors through confidential briefings or memos or to the public
through speeches, op-eds, interviews or other inclusion initiatives such
as public consultations. Ultimately, we need to remember that track 1.5
and track 2 processes are part of a larger ecosystem of change, and
transfer mechanisms can link these dialogues to broader peace processes
or policy discussions underway at multiple levels---from local actions,
to the public opinion arena, to other track 2 processes, and to the
formal higher-level peace processes and policy discussions.

#### Track two diplomacy is comparatively more publicized that track one

international relations from John Hopkins. **(**Charles E. Morrison,
"Track 1/Track 2 symbiosis in Asia-Pacific regionalism", The Pacific
Review, 8/11/2006. Taylor and Francis Online)//ET

Why has Track 2 become so essential in regional economic policy-making
and diplomacy? What does it offer that could not be done by Track 1
itself? This may seem puzzling in that many Asian governments have been
reticent to share policy-making in the domestic context with
organizations from outside government. Moreover[, government officials
are often skeptical or even disdainful of Track 2,]{.underline} [which
they often see as full of 'wannabes']{.underline} or 'has-beens' seeking
to play intergovernmental roles themselves and dispensing unsolicited
advice. [Because of their **independent roles** and **media visibility**
Track 2 personalities]{.underline} can [often jump protocol hurdles
to]{.underline} have direct influence on Track 1 or **[affect the
political environment around Track 1,]{.underline}** again **[to the
annoyance of officials.]{.underline}** Perhaps the most striking example
came when C. Fred Bergsten, chair of the APEC Eminent Persons Group,
convinced President Suharto in 1994 to support free trade and investment
in the region as an APEC goal, thus reversing an established position of
the Indonesian bureaucracy. But despite the annoyances, Track 2 is often
(although not necessarily) valuable to governments, even those not noted
for providing much space for non-governmental groups.

### Track II Fails 

#### Track II Diplomacy is impossible without pre-existing good relations, which is the goal of Track II diplomacy, rendering Track II useless

University of Australia, "A Little Less Conversation? Track II Dialogue

8 Which Comes First: Cooperation Or Conversation?

Basins that, like the Ganges--Brahmaputra--Meghna, are low in both trust
and political will for increased cooperation seem ideal candidates for
Track II Dialogue. [But some impetus for cooperation and trust between
riparian states may be necessary for Track II Dialogue to succeed in
establishing mutually satisfactory solutions between conflicted parties.
Yet **if there is trust between riparians and political will to take
action, then there is no need for facilitated Track II
Dialogue**]{.underline} (although third parties may provide technical
assistance). [Track II Dialogue becomes an option for dispute resolution
only when those two factors are missing---but the absence of trust
between riparians and lack of political will for improving transboundary
water governance are also what undermines Track II Dialogue. Certainly,
Track II Dialogue may contribute to the development of one or both of
those conditions, but that is a long-term enterprise and **highly
unpredictable.**]{.underline}

As a recap, Track II Dialogue is used herein to denote 'unofficial
dialogues, generally between two antagonistic parties, and often
facilitated by an impartial Third Party and involving individuals with
some close connections to their respective official communities, focused
on cooperative efforts to explore new ways to resolve differences over,
or discuss new approaches to, policy-relevant issues'
(Jones [**2015**](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/app5.183#app5183-bib-0015)).

Track II Dialogue can also be understood as the informal, non-binding,
non-attributive discussions with government and non-state actors and as
such is the nexus between Track I Dialogue (formal,
government-to-government relations) and Track III (informal discussions
between non-state actors only such as NGOs and academia). These neat
definitions, however, are not easy to apply in practice; everyone
understands them differently. How and when these processes should be
pursued is also contested.

Some scholars see Track II Dialogue as the foundation of cooperative
transboundary interaction and argue that it is critical that it happens
before Track I processes begin because government negotiators and
diplomats in the Ganges--Brahmaputra--Meghna basin tend to have a
zero-sum approach to negotiations. Therefore, there is first a need for
talks between peers who can scope the problems and begin addressing them
from the perspective of shared interests. The logic is that engaging
with non-government stakeholders early on in a negotiation process
ensures that they can establish an agenda rather than have it imposed by
external or government actors.

[Others see less value in Track II Dialogue alone and instead believe
that what drives change is the collaboration between non-government
groups, that is, Track III Dialogue.]{.underline} This, however, is
difficult to facilitate by international organisations because it is in
essence a bottom-up and organic process. [But by focussing exclusively
on Track II Dialogue, international actors are limited in the
contribution they can make to improved transboundary water governance in
the Ganges--Brahmaputra--Meghna basin. This is especially so as SAWI in
particular engages only actors who already engage with government.
Because the transboundary water governance impasse in the

Weaknesses of Track Two Diplomacy -- Regardless of its advantages,
[Track Two Diplomacy also has **several weaknesses.**]{.underline} The
first weakness is that [Track Two participants have limited ability to
influence foreign policy and political power structures because of their
lack of political power.]{.underline} Second, [Track Two interventions
can **take too long to yield results**]{.underline}. Third, [Track Two
has limited ability to influence change at the war stage of a
conflict.]{.underline} Fourth, [Track Two participants rarely have
resources necessary for sustained leverage during negotiations and for
the implementation of agreements.]{.underline} Fifth, [Track Two is
**not effective in authoritarian regimes** where leaders do not take
advice from lower level leaders]{.underline}. Sixth, [Track Two
actors]{.underline} due to their lack of political power,
[are]{.underline} in most cases [not accountable to the public for poor
decisions.]{.underline} Seventh, because of their multiplicity Track Two
actors/organizations are notoriously known for their lack of
coordination.

Third, [forums such as the Arctic Circle]{.underline} (and perhaps
smaller gatherings such as the upcoming Arctic Frontiers meeting)
[could]{.underline} more robustly [aim for less formal, Track II
diplomacy]{.underline}. T[his may already be happening to some
exten]{.underline}t. The Arctic Circle especially [attracts diverse and
sometimes high-level government official participation. **It isn't
clear**, however, whether such a backchannel diplomatic approach could
be **sufficiently scaled up**]{.underline} [in a future Arctic where
there are more frequent and fast-moving issues on the
table.]{.underline}

[Dialogue on touchy military issues in the Arctic is becoming
increasingly important to avoid either the "military heavy" or "security
void" scenarios.]{.underline} An Arctic war would have no winner. Anyone
who ends up on top militarily in the region would be left with the
costly and time-intensive task of running security in a region too
devastated to enjoy what little economic gains are possible as more of
it becomes navigable.

The Biden administration's 2022 National Security Strategy pledged to
restore American leadership on the global stage while tacitly
criticizing the previous Trump administration's self-interested and
transactional approach to world affairs. However, when it comes to
Russian relations, neither the first Trump nor Biden administrations did
anything to rescind Obama's Kremlin ban. [[Decreased dialogue between
Washington and Moscow]{.mark} only degrades diplomacy, [exacerbates
tension]{.mark}, and increases the unknowns.]{.underline} Since the
beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, [the global
situation]{.underline} has gone from bad to worse. [It has become
particularly troubling in the Arctic where [military and commercial
activities continue to increase in scope and scale and where there are
no functioning forums---**at the official level**---enabling Washington
and Moscow to **deescalate tensions**]{.mark}. Absent a structured forum
for deescalation, [the **risk for miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation and
escalation [increase]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The Arctic presents an opportunity for the Trump administration to
pursue pragmatic and more open engagement between Washington and
Moscow]{.underline}, specifically in the military and security space.
[Such [a forum currently exists at the Track 2 level, but **absent
official participation** from Washington and Moscow decision makers,
this forum's efforts to curtail conflict will
struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Managing the Competition It can be [difficult to see past Russia's
rhetoric, deliberately provocative acts, and grandiose statements about
its Arctic plans and threats to them]{.underline}, and to acknowledge
that its [bark so far has been worse than its bite. Russia's ambitions
far exceed the resources it has to realize them]{.underline}. Thus,
while it is essential not to yield to Russia's posturing, it is [equally
important not to overreact to it.]{.underline} Notwithstanding the
seeming novelty of the situation---[changing climate, NATO's new
frontier in Eastern Europe, China's growing footprint in the Arctic, and
so on]{.underline}---Russia's drive to the Far North and the rationale
behind it are part of a long-standing historical pattern. Its
confrontation with the West is not a new development either, and the
[push for Arctic resources is crucial for its ability to sustain this
posture. From the perspective of the country's security establishment,
Russia is playing defense rather than offense.]{.underline} Moreover,
[Russia is confronting the West in vastly diminished circumstances. Its
economy is stagnant, its population is declining, and it is
diplomatically isolated in Europe and among the Arctic
states]{.underline}---almost entirely thanks to its own actions. It has
rebuilt its military capabilities after a long period of neglect and
decline, but even this utmost national priority is facing budget
constraints and technological challenges. In the years to come Russia's
Arctic pursuits and posture will likely be driven by concerns about
being able to sustain its already weakened position vis-à-vis the West.
[Rather than treat the Arctic as the next arena of great-power
competition with Russia, the United States and NATO's other Arctic
members should adopt a two-track strategy of diplomacy and
deterrence.]{.underline}

### Track II Fails---No Spillover

#### Track two diplomacy fails \-\-- lacks officials, substantive ideas, and openness

the University of Wellington. (David Capie, "When does track two matter?

The first 'supply side' explanation is that [the substantive ideas and
information coming out of track two dialogues are **less useful and no
longer resonate** with regional officials]{.underline}. To some extent
at least**[, track two participants concede this point.]{.underline}**
Senior Singaporean diplomat and former CSCAP co-chair, Barry Desker, has
bemoaned the lack of innovation in the organization, arguing that he was
consistently struck by the fact that CSCAP was less ambitious and less
innovative than equivalent officials' meetings in the region (personal
communication, Singapore, January 2008). Another senior Southeast Asian
participant noted that 'those of us involved for a long time have an
intuition that CSCAP has fallen behind the policy curve' (interviewee 7,
19 March 2008). **[A senior Chinese participant]{.underline}** in CSCAP
[complained that many meetings had become '**too
formulaic'**]{.underline} (interviewee 8, Beijing, September 2009). The
organization's 2004 reconstitution of its open-ended five working groups
into new 'study groups' with fixed sunset clauses was premised on the
need to inject new life into a process that was widely regarded as
moribund. Some of CSCAP's outputs, such as a 2005 memorandum on
'Enhancing Efforts To Address the Factors Driving International
Terrorism' were so watered down by the need to achieve consensus that
some members did not consider them sufficiently useful to be worth
forwarding to the ARF (interviewees 1 and 6).

A related explanation focuses on the role of the key individuals and
elites who press particular ideas. Peter Hall's study of Keynesianism
stresses the importance of administrative and political processes in
shaping the diffusion of economic ideas (Hall, 1989). Analyses of policy
networks similarly stress the role played by key individuals in
spreading ideas. Richard Higgott talks about the importance of
'understanding the dramatis personae of the policy process' (1994: 367).
Stuart Harris points to the critical role of a 'small group of
individuals or intellectual elites' in building support for regional
economic cooperation (1994: 384). This approach is picked up by many
accounts of ASEAN-ISIS and CSCAP. One author notes the crucial role
played by the 'Asia Pacific track two elite', a set of individuals
'whose commitment transcends national barriers and who, by virtue of
their advantaged positions as directors of think tanks, holders of
prominent academic posts and the like, have been remarkably effective in
coordinating their energies to advance institutional cooperation' (Job,
2003: 253). [Reliance on key individuals]{.underline}, however[, is a
double-edged sword]{.underline}. Well connected elites may 'whisper in
the ear of power' and help spread ideas and create domestic
constituencies for policy change, but [dependence on individuals can
also weaken networks if those people move on]{.underline} (Kao, 2003).
Job notes that '[the ebb and flow of regional track one and track two
innovation over the last several decades can be correlated to a
considerable extent with the appearance]{.underline} (and the inevitable
receding) [of figures from the regional political scene'
(]{.underline}2003: 253). Tay notes that within ASEAN-ISIS, some member
institutes have been weakened by leadership transitions and have 'lost
impetus and strength' (2006: 139). Carolina Hernandez (personal
communication, 20 March 2009) has said a 'generational shift' within
some ASEAN-ISIS member institutes has gravely weakened the network.
