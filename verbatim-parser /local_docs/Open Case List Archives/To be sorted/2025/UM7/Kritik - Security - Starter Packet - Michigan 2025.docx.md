# Kritik---Security---Starter Packet

### Notes

While the security K is a tried-and-true classic generic position, this
version is a little more topic-specific. The security K you may have
heard or read before is usually not very concerned with the mechanism of
the aff or the internal links; it's usually more about the aff's
representations or discourse. This version is still about those things,
but I tried to make the evidence as specific to the Arctic as possible,
because there's actually quite a bit of literature about securitization
theory in the Arctic context specifically.

On that note, it's worth mentioning that you will be most successful
with this K if you familiarize yourself with the background literature.
Often, the security K gets distilled down into "you talked about
threats, don't do that," which is both boring and unstrategic. The
security K is not just the argument that "threat discourse=bad," but a
more nuanced criticism of how we understand states' motivations and
policy choices. Some questions that I would encourage you to feel
comfortable answering before extending this in a 2NR include:

- What is the Copenhagen School?

- What is constructivism?

- What is realism (and what are classical realism, offensive/defensive
  realism, neorealism, etc), and why is it relevant to this K?

- Does the aff assume the tenets of realism, liberalism, or some other
  theory?

- What's the difference between discourse and epistemology?

A good starting point is this dissertation by Wilfrid Greaves (which
some cards in this file are from); it's long, but not all of it is
relevant for this K, and it has good background primers on many of the
above questions:
<https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/items/e0790f25-319a-401b-a8c2-3149989fbc22>

I've intentionally included fewer blocks and much less highlighting in
this file than I have in kritiks that I've written for starter packets
in previous seasons. This is because I wrote this K as a way of
practicing framework debates and link debates, as those are where this K
is won and lost. I think it's tremendously important to practice
adapting your blocks and highlighting to different affs and aff
strategies. If you put in the work to understand the literature and
spend some time thinking through what you're saying and why, rather than
just reading pre-written blocks, you will be much more successful over
the season and over the course of your career. When prepping this file,
my three biggest pieces of advice are:

1.  **Be intentional with how you write your framework frontlines.**
    What do debates look like under your interpretation? How does the
    aff win, and how does the judge decide that? Interpretations that
    answer these questions explicitly are usually stronger than things
    like "the 1AC is an object of study" or "the role of the judge is to
    reject securitization." Also remember that **this is not a K of
    fiat**, and it's neither necessary nor helpful to use this as a
    vehicle for a hidden fiat K in the block (which is why I
    intentionally avoided including cards for that in this file).

2.  **Your best links are case defense.** If you are right about your
    defense, then it proves that the 1AC has either inflated a threat
    and/or offered a hasty solution that may make the threat they've
    outlined worse rather than better. Either way, it proves the
    importance of figuring out how that happened before we decide on
    solutions.

3.  **Your best impacts are in the 1AC.** Following from #2, you should
    focus on "turns case" arguments, as they make it a lot harder for
    the aff to go for "link=non-unique" arguments (which are otherwise
    quite threatening).

For the aff, keep in mind that many of the cards here will probably not
be necessary. Your best defenses of your representations will likely be
in the 1AC! I'd also encourage you to press on link uniqueness. Think
about how your advantages/impact scenarios are examples of the links
occurring in the status quo, or otherwise represent alt causes to the
link. Depending on the aff, you can also press substantively on the
alt---this K is written to explicitly defend cooperative, demilitarized
engagement in the Arctic, so if your aff says that those things are
impossible, then the 1AC is 8 minutes of disads to the alt.

Whether you read US Army and Coastal Guard Strategies from other Arctic
states or the front page of the New York Times, [the Arctic is becoming
nearly synonymous with **fears**]{.underline} about Russia and China.
Military [strategists and journalists]{.underline} alike [write about
**Russian militarization** as well as unwelcome **Chinese
influence**]{.underline} in the High North. [While there are certainly
**geopolitical realities** to take into consideration when thinking
about Arctic policy]{.underline}, [in [**focusing too heavily**
on]{.mark} questions of]{.underline} "**[hard]{.underline}**"
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, [policymakers are **obscuring** other
transnational issues]{.underline}, [such as **climate change** and
**cyber security**]{.underline}, [where cooperation is not only desired
but also necessary]{.underline}.

In other words, [discussing interstate competition **too much** [leads
the Arctic]{.mark} on a **trajectory** [toward becoming]{.mark} a
**[securitized]{.mark} region**]{.underline}. [Yet]{.underline}, **[it
doesn't have to be this way]{.underline}**. [This trend can]{.underline}
--- [and should]{.underline} --- [be **reversed** to **mitigate**
possible consequences]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline}: [Focusing on
how cooperation can be used to **solve key issues** in the Arctic rather
than thinking solely about **military buildup**]{.underline}; [changing
the **framing** of the Arctic in official policies]{.underline},
[speeches]{.underline}, [and critical international
organizations]{.underline}, such as the Arctic Council, [and finding
**low-stakes issues** to encourage relationship-building]{.underline}
among actors in the Arctic.

So, can the Arctic be spared from securitization?

EARLY SYMPTOMS OF SECURITIZATION

[[Securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} is the process of something
becoming a security threat or a security issue. It [[happens when
something]{.underline}]{.mark} --- such as immigration --- [[is labeled
as]{.mark} **dangerous**]{.underline}, **[threatening]{.underline}**,
[and as [an **existential crisis**]{.mark} by someone]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} then [that framing is **accepted** by an
audience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Importantly, securitization implies that
security issues are not just out there. Instead, [by creating security
**threats** in the way we **speak**]{.underline}, [we create security
**issues**]{.underline}. While the Arctic might seem like a peripheral
region globally, there is evidence that it is beginning to rise in
importance. [[Concerns about **China**]{.underline},
**[Russia]{.underline}**, [and **resource competition** are causing
**real changes** to occur in]{.underline}]{.mark} [how states treat [the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States, for example, has
announced the establishment of the Arctic Regional Center, which will be
housed within the Department of Defense and focus on the "unique
challenges and security concerns related to the Arctic region."

As climate change has resulted in new shipping lanes and easier access
to resources in the Arctic, the interests of Arctic states --- United
States, Russia, Canada, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden
--- and non-Arctic states --- China, United Kingdom, and EU to name a
few --- have grown. The Arctic presents virtually untapped amounts of
oil, gas, and minerals that attract both Arctic and non-Arctic states. A
United States Geological Survey 2008 report also described the Arctic
continental shelves as potentially constituting "the geographically
largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth."
While it is true that some states, such as China, are finding investment
opportunities with Arctic states to build infrastructure as part of the
Polar Silk Road (part of the Belt and Road Initiative), [[it is **by no
means a necessity** to treat **Chinese** influence as **inherently
negative**]{.underline}]{.mark}. By the same logic,
[**[Russian]{.mark}** investment and military [actions]{.mark} in the
Arctic [might **seem**]{.mark} overtly [negative]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[but it is important to **contextualize**]{.mark} Russian interest in
the Arctic as not recent]{.underline}, [but historic]{.underline}.
[Instead]{.underline}, [the rhetoric around these issues has treated
them as **critical security risks**]{.underline}, [painting the Arctic
as the next theater of a **new Cold War**]{.underline}. But is the
Arctic really the next theater?

[Rather than focusing on these interstate threats]{.underline}, [[there
are **more serious concerns**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as **climate
change**]{.mark} and]{.underline} insecurities that stem from it ---
such as **[[food]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[water]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[environmental]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and [**health**
security]{.mark} concerns]{.underline} --- [that affect individuals and
impact their quality of life]{.underline}. For example, Alaskan
[communities are suffering from **food insecurity**]{.underline} because
sea ice is melting, causing traditional sea mammals that they would
otherwise hunt, to move elsewhere [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} decreasing
their protection from the large ocean waves that have in some cases
caused [devastating **[infrastructure damage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On
Little Diomede Island, for example, a late storm caused serious damage
to a water treatment plant, leaving the town without clean water and
without power. [By **[over-emphasizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}
"**[[hard]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[security]{.mark} issues]{.underline}
from Russia and China, therefore, [the rhetoric surrounding Arctic
politics **[ignores]{.mark}** other important [questions that impact
people on the ground]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly **Indigenous
people** whose livelihoods and societal resilience are threatened by
climate change]{.underline}.

[The most significant concern]{.underline} when it comes to treating the
Arctic as a theater of great power competition [is the
**danger**]{.underline} it presents [in putting the Arctic on a
**trajectory** of becoming a **securitized region**]{.underline}.
[[While]{.underline}]{.mark} it can be argued that as it stands, [[the
Arctic is not]{.mark} a **contested** region or a region **[fraught with
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as the Middle East and parts of
Africa, [[it **could be** if the trajectory]{.mark} of treating the
Arctic as this region of competition and security
**[continues]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Regions]{.mark} of the world [do
not become theaters of competition]{.mark} and conflict
**[overnight]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} instead
[become that way [after]{.mark} years of **[construction]{.mark}** that
involves a range of activities from **rhetoric** and to **military
buildups**]{.underline}. [[**Crimea** is]{.mark} a telling
[example]{.mark} of this]{.underline}, [[where]{.mark} both Ukraine and
Russia slowly began ratcheting up **[bellicose discourse]{.mark}** over
time which [was followed by **militarization**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Now, Crimea is a point of severe tension between the two states.

[The Arctic]{.underline}, however, [is not]{.underline} --- [and should
not]{.underline} --- [be destined for that end state]{.underline}.
[We]{.underline}, the journalists who report on our news, and the
policymakers who create reports, [have a **choice** in how we **frame**
issues]{.underline}. [Rather than always treating the Arctic as a place
where competition is **inherent**]{.underline}, [we can **instead** see
it as a place of possible **cooperation**]{.underline}. After all, [the
largest security threat in the Arctic is **climate
change**]{.underline}. [It impacts not only the people living in the
Arctic itself]{.underline}, [but also]{.underline} states surrounding
the Arctic, and the rest of [the **world**]{.underline}, [as sea and
ocean levels increase]{.underline}, [oceans become
desalinated]{.underline}, [and temperatures increase
worldwide]{.underline}. [There is a **choice** to focus on how states
can and have been **cooperating** on this issue]{.underline}, [thereby
**incentivizing further collaboration** down the line instead of
thinking solely on old-school ways of thinking about
security]{.underline}.

HOW TO AVOID THE SECURITIZATION TRAJECTORY

[While we **can** think and write about geopolitical hard security
issues in the Arctic]{.underline}, [we can do so in a way that **also**
gives airtime to **cooperation** and **collaboration** rather than
thinking solely about the latest **Russian military exercise** or most
recent scare about **Chinese investment** in Greenland]{.underline}.
[This is **not** to say that reporting on Russia and China is not
important or necessary]{.underline}, [but rather]{.underline},
[reporting in a **balanced** way that takes the responsibility of
reporting **all** sides of an issue seriously]{.underline}.

On a policy level, [policymakers]{.underline} and diplomats
**[can]{.underline}** --- [and **should**]{.underline} --- [**change the
framing** of the Arctic in official policies]{.underline},
[speeches]{.underline}, [and critical international
organizations]{.underline}, such as the Arctic Council. [Security
shouldn't be only about the]{.underline} construction of new ships,
submarines, and **[military]{.underline}** exercises. [Planners who are
thinking about the role of militaries and institutions should consider
how security also refers to]{.underline} the
**[individual]{.underline}** security of Arctic residents, focusing on
their ability to access food [and]{.underline} water, potential
insecurities arising from coastal erosion --- 70% of which in the Arctic
is built on currently thawing permafrost --- as well as [**societal**
insecurities]{.underline} that come about from a lack of community
resilience.

Lastly, [[there is a tendency]{.underline}]{.mark} in international
politics [[to focus on **conflict**]{.mark}**ual** issues [when]{.mark}
instead [we should]{.mark} be [find]{.mark}ing other]{.underline},
[[more **cooperative** issues]{.mark} to encourage relationship-building
among actors in the Arctic]{.underline}. [Instead of immediately
pivoting to trying to negotiate **arms control treaties** amongst Arctic
states]{.underline}, [countries could instead find issues]{.underline},
[[such as **transparency**]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**earch **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**nd
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**escue [cooperation]{.underline}, [[and
**pollution** clean-up]{.mark} that does not require as much political
capital]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} issues [might be framed as
**low-stakes** but they should not be]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly
if all stakeholders want [[to **ensure** that the Arctic is **not
securitized**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**[RHETORIC MATTERS]{.underline}** AFTER ALL

[[It **matters** how we talk about the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[**Whaling** is a great example]{.mark} of [where changing rhetoric has
**impacted policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While in the first half of the
20th century, whaling was considered a fairly normal aspect of the
economy, [anti-whaling discourse changed the depiction of
whales]{.underline} to intelligent mammals. [This **transformed** the
perception of whaling to morally repugnant]{.underline}. It goes to show
that [[the way we talk **matters**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and it can
matter **[more than material interests]{.mark}** that might seem more
logical]{.underline}.

[We can continue to use **[bellicose rhetoric]{.mark}** to describe
relations between states and [encourage **militarization**]{.mark} on
every side]{.underline}, [but [that will end]{.mark} **exactly** [the
way worse-case scenarios describe it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Instead]{.underline}, [[we]{.mark} can]{.underline} --- [and
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[**change** the way we **talk** and
**think** about the Arctic]{.mark} [to focus on
**cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [change the way we **frame** the
region]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} find low-stakes issues on which to
**cooperate** and]{.underline} hopefully [[**reverse** or]{.mark} at
least [**slow** the trajectory]{.mark} of securitizing the
Arctic]{.underline}.

### Impact---2NC

#### Preventing [competition]{.underline} from dominating Arctic narratives is key to [cooperation]{.underline} over [existential threats]{.underline}. Securitization's not [inevitable]{.underline} or [irreversible]{.underline}.

Arctic Realities: Analyzing Arctic Security through the Lens of Arctic
Exceptionalism and Great Power Politics,"
<https://skemman.is/handle/1946/45722>, dml)

Furthermore, [shared]{.underline} knowledge and [interpretations play a
**crucial role** in shaping the perceptions]{.underline},
[behaviors]{.underline}, [and interactions of actors in the global
system]{.underline} (Flockhart, 2016, p. 85). [The AC's success in
diplomatic negotiations and its ability to foster cooperation among
Arctic states is an example of how]{.underline} shared knowledge and
[interpretations **shape perceptions** of the Arctic as a region
requiring cooperative solutions]{.underline} (Jóhannesson, 2022). [This
success in the Arctic has implications for **global diplomacy** and the
importance of cooperative forums in addressing **shared
challenges**]{.underline}. Furthermore, the [scientific cooperation
within the AC aimed at better environmental protection and sustainable
development exemplifies how shared knowledge and interpretations
influence **global scientific collaboration**]{.underline} (Jóhannesson,
2022). [Research findings and knowledge sharing in the Arctic contribute
to **global efforts** to combat **climate change** and protect the
**environment**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the **exclusion** of **hard
security** matters]{.underline} from the AC agenda [reflects **shared
interpretations** among Arctic states that the region should remain
**primarily focused** on non-military cooperation and environmental
concerns]{.underline} (Exner-Pirot et al., 2019). It aligns with Wendt's
(1992) perspective regrading principles of norms and shared
understandings. [This constructivist perspective helps us recognize how
the Arctic cooperative narrative **emerges**]{.underline},
**[spreads]{.underline}**, [and becomes **internalized** as a framework
for understanding the region's security dynamics]{.underline}.

In relation to great power competition [the increasing interest of
**great powers**]{.underline} like the US, Russia, and China [in the
Arctic]{.underline} due to economic opportunities and strategic
considerations (Gross, 2020; Lopez, 2021; Humpert, 2022) [shows how
shared knowledge and interpretations about the Arctic's changing
landscape can **influence** their global strategies]{.underline}. [This
competition in the Arctic could have implications for **global power
dynamics**]{.underline} and international relations. Wendt's (1992)
argument that structures manifest through formal rules and norms is
particularly relevant. [States' behaviors and interactions are
influenced by norms and rules associated with their **identities** and
**social groups**]{.underline}. [In the context of great power
competition]{.underline}, [norms related to cooperation and rivalry are
**constructed** and **internalized** over time]{.underline}.
Furthermore, Wendt's perspective reminds us that [the
Arctic's]{.underline} evolving structure, influenced by [norms
associated with cooperation and rivalry]{.underline}, [plays a **pivotal
role** in shaping how states respond to the challenges posed by the
melting Arctic and the dynamics of great power competition]{.underline}.

5.1.3 Identity and Logic of Actions

In constructivism, identities establish order and predictability in
domestic society and international politics (Hopf, 1998). [The presence
of **inter-subjective identities**]{.underline}, characterized by
stability and consistency, [forms the basis for **enduring
expectations** among states]{.underline}, [guiding their
behavior]{.underline}. [Arctic cooperation]{.underline}, as viewed
through a constructivist lens, [is influenced by]{.underline} the
identities of the participating states. The concept of inter-subjective
identities, characterized by stability and consistency, creates [a sense
of **order** and **predictability** in the region]{.underline} (Hopf,
1998). [Arctic states share an identity as Arctic actors]{.underline},
[emphasizing their **common interests** in environmental
preservation]{.underline}, [sustainable development]{.underline}, [and
cooperation in relation to the melting Arctic]{.underline} (Arctic
Council, n.d.-a). [This]{.underline} shared identity [forms the basis
for **enduring expectations** among states]{.underline}, [guiding their
behavior within the Arctic context]{.underline}.

[Even though the **US** and **Russia** have been able to work as
cooperative Arctic actors]{.underline} within the AC, one could argue
that, [as **great power competition** reenters the Arctic
region]{.underline}, [these Arctic cooperative actors may evolve back
into **confrontational superpowers**]{.underline}. This is amplified by
the behavior of the states the US, Russia, and China within the region
and their pursuit of economic gain and strategic consideration (Gross,
2020; Lopez, 2021; Humpert, 2022).

5.1.4 Agents and structures

As illustrated by Flockhart (2016, p. 88), the concept of mutual
constitution underscores the dynamic nature of how perspectives in the
Arctic region are constructed, perpetuated, and potentially transformed.
In the context of the melting Arctic, the notion of mutual constitution
central to constructivism becomes apparent. This perspective emphasizes
that [structures **influence** actors and are simultaneously **shaped**
by their practices]{.underline} (Giddens, 1991). Archer (1995) expands
on this concept by introducing "structuration," highlighting that
[agents **reproduce** and **transform** structures through their
actions]{.underline}. Consider, for instance, the changing Arctic
identities. [Historically]{.underline}, [Arctic states viewed themselves
**primarily** as]{.underline} the AC members [focused on **cooperative
governance**]{.underline} (Lackenbauer & Dean, 2021, p. 327).
[However]{.underline}, [as the region's resources become **more
accessible** and the potential for **great power competition**
increases]{.underline}, [these identities are evolving]{.underline}.
[States]{.underline} like the US [are adapting their practices and
identities to **assert themselves more forcefully** in the
region]{.underline}, [challenging the existing cooperative
structures]{.underline} (Flockhart, 2016, p. 88). The norms governing
Arctic security have also undergone transformation. The Arctic was
traditionally seen as a zone of cooperation, with a focus on
environmental protection and peaceful coexistence. However, the changing
geopolitical landscape and resource interests are reshaping these norms.
[The emergence of new security concerns related to resource competition
and military presence reflects how practices and interactions can
**influence security perspectives**]{.underline} (Archer, 1995).

Furthermore, disruptive events in the Arctic, such as the opening of new
shipping routes and resource extraction projects, challenge shared
meanings and existing structures of governance. These events expose the
inadequacy of traditional cooperative structures in addressing emerging
security issues. Arctic states must adapt their practices and identities
to address these challenges effectively (Flockhart, 2016, p. 90). This
demonstrates how the constructivist perspective, emphasizing the mutual
constitution of structures and actors, can help us understand the
evolving dynamics of Arctic security and cooperation in the face of
environmental changes and shifting power dynamics.

5.2 Arctic Exceptionalism Perspective

Before diving further into the analysis, this section will start of by
addressing how Arctic exceptionalism will be utilized in the discussion.
The theory of Arctic exceptionalism offers an insightful framework for
comprehending the distinctive characteristics of the Arctic region
(Lackenbauer & Dean, 2021, p. 327). This understanding provides
researchers with the tools to effectively identify and predict security
threats unique to the Arctic. However, authors and scholars such as
Gjørv and Hodgson (2019) argue that Arctic exceptionalism's narrow view
of Arctic security prevents it from taking meaningful actions to protect
the environment and human security. Furthermore, Melchiorre (2022)
contends that the Arctic is not exceptional and is instead a reflection
of the international order, suggesting that the "exceptional" idea of
the Arctic was an illusion. Nonetheless, the concept of Arctic
exceptionalism has predominantly been interpreted through the lens of
Gorbachev's speech, where he characterizes the Arctic as a "zone of
peace" (Gorbachev, 1987). Instead, by revisiting the origin of the
theoretical framework, which emphasized the distinction from other
regions due to extraordinary characteristics and the perspective of the
Arctic as a "land of tomorrow" requiring exceptional protection, this
revised interpretation of Arctic exceptionalism could offer valuable
insights into the security dynamics of the region (Lackenbauer & Dean,
2021; Young & Osherenko, 1989; Young, 1992). Revisiting this
origin-based interpretation of Arctic exceptionalism not only offers
insights into the security dynamics of the region but also unlocks a
fresh perspective on how its exceptional characteristics shape both the
challenges and opportunities it presents.

Considering these insights, understanding the security dynamics in the
Arctic necessitates a shifting focus from the usual narrative of Arctic
exceptionalism in favor of a strategy that considers the region's unique
characteristics and vulnerabilities. Recognizing the intricate interplay
between environmental, human, and traditional security components, we
see the Arctic as more than just a "zone of peace." The updated or
revisited understanding of Arctic exceptionalism motivates researchers
to look at security issues from various approaches.

Viewed through the Arctic exceptionalist lens, the rapid sea ice loss
and tundra thawing in the Arctic, occurring at a rate three times higher
than the global average, exemplify the region's exceptional response to
global climate change (Arctic Council, n.d.-a; World Wildlife Fund
Arctic, 2023). This distinctiveness underscores the exceptional nature
of the Arctic environment, a critical area for climate study and policy.
The increased frequency of forest fires, transformation of the Arctic
landscape, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity in response to
these climate changes are further examples of the Arctic exceptional
nature (Gigova & Paddison, 2023; Struzik, 2020; Greenpeace USA, 2015).
Notably, Arctic exceptionalism highlights that the Arctic's response to
global climate shifts differs significantly from other regions by the
intricate connection of climate change, environmental security, human
security, and the rise of geopolitical competition. Moreover, the
concept underscores that [the consequences of the melting Arctic extend
**beyond** its borders]{.underline}, [affecting ecosystems
**worldwide**]{.underline}. [This interconnectedness]{.underline},
highlighted by Arctic exceptionalism, [emphasizes the need for
**international cooperation** and]{.underline} policy actions to address
Arctic climate change as part of broader **[global]{.underline}**
climate **[efforts]{.underline}** (GreenFacts, 2010). [The exceptional
vulnerabilities and global ramifications of Arctic climate change
underscore the imperative for **responsible governance** and
**sustainable practices**]{.underline}, recognizing the Arctic's pivotal
role in the broader climate system and its impacts on human security
globally.

The concept of Arctic exceptionalism underscores the importance of
collaboration concerning the interconnectedness of global ecosystems and
the shared responsibility to address environmental challenges. [The
urgency to adopt sustainable practices becomes evident when considering
the potential ramifications of the Arctic's vulnerabilities on a
**global scale**]{.underline}. [As the Arctic region continues to
experience rapid changes]{.underline}, [it serves as a call to
action]{.underline} for individuals, communities, and nations [to work
**collaboratively** in mitigating **climate change**]{.underline},
[preserving **biodiversity**]{.underline}, [and promoting **sustainable
development** practices]{.underline}. [By understanding and addressing
the unique vulnerabilities of the Arctic, we can better appreciate the
imperative for **immediate** and **concerted efforts** to secure a
resilient and harmonious future for the Arctic region and the **entire
planet**]{.underline}. This idea finds resonance in the statement by
Lackenbauer and Dean (2021, p. 328), who describe the Arctic as a realm
of "compelling opportunities and exhilarating risk." Indeed, these
dynamics extend beyond the Arctic region to influence the rest of the
world.

Viewed through the lens of Arctic exceptionalism, the challenges faced
by Arctic residents due to the changing Arctic climate take on a unique
and exceptional character (Bludd, 2022; Reist et al., 2006). Indigenous
peoples experience the profound impacts of these changes on their
traditional livelihoods. Arctic exceptionalism highlights that the
Arctic's response to global climate shifts differs significantly from
other regions, as it encompasses environmental changes and deeply
intertwined human and cultural dimensions. Kornhuber et al. (2023) state
that even though Arctic exceptionalism is "blocked" in geopolitics, the
challenges the region faces remains exceptional. Therefore, investing
more in remote sensing initiatives for independent scientific data
collection, free from geopolitical tensions, could be considered
(ibid.). Moreover, engaging Arctic Indigenous Peoples in co-producing
knowledge on ecosystems, climate change, biodiversity, and environmental
development is crucial. Their involvement can enhance the understanding
of the Arctic\'s unique challenges and contribute to more sustainable
solutions within the framework of Arctic exceptionalism.

Greaves (2019) on the other hand argue how growing geopolitical
competition are breaking up the unified Arctic and creating three
distinct security regions across the polar area. This change is similar
to how global warming is transforming the Arctic Ocean into something
more like the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, erasing the Arctic\'s
uniqueness. This shift marks the end of the post-Cold War era when the
Arctic was seen as separate from global power struggles. As the Arctic
warms and becomes less distinct from lower-latitude regions, its
politics and security increasingly mirror those in the south (ibid.).
Furthermore, Greaves (2019) state that this fragmentation does not imply
that more conflict will come from within the region but will most likely
be caused by external factors spilling into the region. As a result, the
Arctic will become less distinct and more influenced by global factors,
reflecting the dynamics of neighboring regions rather than its unique
characteristics.

However, the perspective of Arctic exceptionalism is still relevant.
Arctic exceptionalism recognizes the distinct vulnerabilities of the
Arctic due to its extreme environmental conditions, which cannot be
easily compared to other regions like the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans.
Arctic exceptionalism underscores the critical importance of addressing
the region\'s specific environmental and security issues, such as rapid
climate change and the need for sustainable development. Furthermore,
supporters of Arctic exceptionalism might argue that [even if there is
increasing interaction with neighboring regions]{.underline}, [this does
not **diminish** the Arctic\'s uniqueness]{.underline}. Instead, [it
highlights the need for **international cooperation** and **governance
structures** tailored to the Arctic\'s distinct
characteristics]{.underline}.

Moreover, as the case of the melting Arctic has illustrated, the Arctic
faces many intricate security challenges. However, Käpylä and Mikkola
(2015) argue against the concept of Arctic exceptionalism, which
portrays the Arctic as a uniquely isolated and peaceful region. They
contend that this view is overly limited, asserting that the
contemporary Arctic is deeply entwined with global political dynamics
and should not be perceived in isolation. They substantiate their
argument with empirical cases, such as the Arctic Sunrise protest and
the Ukraine crisis, illustrating the Arctic\'s susceptibility to
external influences, challenging the notion of inherent regional
tranquility. Moreover, the authors emphasize the shortcomings of Arctic
governance mechanisms when dealing with complex political scenarios and
underscore the historical precedent of international conflicts spilling
over into the Arctic. This argument has credibility from how the AC
cooperation froze as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

While Käpylä and Mikkola (2015) make a compelling case for the Arctic\'s
interconnectedness with global dynamics, proponents of Arctic
exceptionalism argue that these global linkages do not negate the
region\'s unique characteristics and cooperative nature. They contend
that [while external factors can influence Arctic affairs]{.underline},
[the region has historically exhibited a remarkable degree of
**stability** and **cooperation** among Arctic states]{.underline},
[**despite** global conflicts]{.underline}. Arctic exceptionalism
proponents point to the AC as a forum where Arctic nations engage in
collaborative efforts on various issues, emphasizing the Arctic\'s
capacity for peaceful multilateral governance. They argue that [while
the Arctic may not be **completely immune** to global
influences]{.underline}, [its distinct]{.underline} geographical,
environmental, and geopolitical [features continue to foster
**cooperation** and **dialogue** among its stakeholders]{.underline},
[**setting it apart** from more conflict- prone areas of the
world]{.underline}.

Furthermore, the lens of Arctic exceptionalism offers a unique
perspective through which to understand the intricate dynamics between
the Arctic's distinctive vulnerabilities and the realm of great power
politics. As previously discussed, the Arctic region stands as a beacon
of rapid environmental transformation, prominently featuring the
emergence of previously inaccessible resources and newly established
shipping routes as primary drivers of these profound shifts (Foreign
Policy, 2020; Brodka, 2021; Marsh, 2022). This intersection of
environmental metamorphosis and the pursuit of geopolitical interests
within the Arctic stage underscores the exceptional and nuanced nature
of the Arctic's response to the world's broader challenges. Lackenbauer
on the other hand, argue that the Arctic region is not a region of
exceptional cooperation nor conflict as nations interests can have both
a cooperative and competitive nature Teeple, 2021). This is exemplified
in the Arctic states' cooperation through the AC, simultaneously as
countries such as the US and Russia participates in geopolitical
competition in the Arctic.

The intense race to exploit the untapped Arctic resources, including
oil, gas, and minerals, has, in turn, amplified the tensions among great
powers as Russia, China, and the United States vie for dominance in this
fragile environment (Bordka, 2021; Gross, 2020; Lopez, 2021; Humpert,
2022). However, the scope of this competition extends beyond traditional
resource rivalry, delving into previously uncharted territories. For
instance, the revelation of valuable minerals in Greenland, now
accessible due to receding ice, holds immense significance for green
technologies, thereby attracting mining companies (Marsh, 2022). This
multifaceted contestation reflects the intricate balance that Arctic
exceptionalism illuminates---a delicate balance between economic
interests and environmental concerns unparalleled in any other context.
Furthermore, Young et al. (2021) state that it is one cannot ignore the
Arctic as a stage for future global competition, but rather provides the
perspective of the Arctic as a zone for peaceful competition.

Moreover, Arctic exceptionalism does not merely underscore [the
**environmental repercussions** of resource extraction and
infrastructure development in the Arctic]{.underline}; it also
[emphasizes the **unparalleled vulnerabilities** inherent to the
region]{.underline}. For instance, [the expansion of **oil drilling** in
this unique ecosystem poses not just risks but **dire
consequences**]{.underline}, [such as the potential for oil spills that
could inflict **devastating harm** upon the fragile Arctic marine
ecosystem]{.underline} (Borshchevskaia et al., 2022). Furthermore, [the
opening of Arctic **shipping** routes]{.underline}, while promising
economic gains, [ushers in the peril of increased maritime traffic that
introduces **noise pollution**]{.underline}---a disruption that imperils
Arctic marine mammals' communication and navigation (WWF Arctic,
n.d.-a). These instances underscore the extraordinary character of the
Arctic's vulnerabilities.

[Within this complex tapestry of challenges lies the predominant
necessity of **responsible governance**]{.underline}, firmly positioning
itself as the core of Arctic exceptionalism's application. [In the heart
of great power politics]{.underline}, [the AC is a **cooperative
platform** where states convene to collectively address the multifaceted
environmental and human security concerns]{.underline}, [even as
geopolitical rivalries play out]{.underline}. Arctic exceptionalism
recognizes the pivotal role of sustainable development in navigating
this ever-accelerating pace of Arctic transformation. [Responsible
governance would emerge as an **imperative** to forestall environmental
degradation and safeguard]{.underline} Arctic communities'
[well-being]{.underline}.

Resource [competition]{.underline}, as manifested [in the
Arctic]{.underline}, does more than reshape the region; it [transforms
it into an intricate theater where strategic calculations]{.underline},
[environmental imperatives]{.underline}, [and geopolitical rivalries
converge]{.underline}. Within this dynamic tapestry, [striking a
**balance** between economic interests]{.underline}, [environmental
preservation]{.underline}, [and human security becomes an
**extraordinary challenge**]{.underline}, uniquely expounded upon by the
framework of Arctic exceptionalism. [It underscores the **profound
importance** of]{.underline} prioritizing the Arctic's inhabitants'
welfare and the global environment's well-being in pursuing the region's
resource wealth. In navigating these labyrinthine intersections, great
powers could exemplify [leadership in addressing the **global
challenges** that transcend the Arctic while embracing the tenets of
**responsible governance** and **international
cooperation**]{.underline} within the exceptional Arctic context.

### Framework Cards---2NC

#### Debate is not just a game, but a [research apparatus]{.underline} in which debaters, speeches, and research are all [fundamentally entangled]{.underline} with the broader political context. The role of debaters and judges is to be [intra-actors]{.underline} who take ethical responsibility for [how]{.underline} we research and represent security.

**Murphy, 22**---Banting Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of
Political Studies at Queen's University (Michael, "Entangled observers?
A quantum perspective on authority in critical security studies,"
Critical Studies on Security, 10(3), 119--131, dml)

If the [research]{.underline} apparatus is not defined by its laboratory
instrumentation, then what is it? Well, for Barad, '[apparatuses are
specific material configurations]{.underline}, or rather, dynamic
(re)configurings of the world [through which bodies are **intra-actively
materialized**]{.underline} ... [apparatuses are not bounded objects or
structures]{.underline}; [they are open-ended practices]{.underline}'
(Barad Citation2007, 169--170). If [the apparatus is **fundamentally
entangled** with the matter under observation in a broader
phenomenon]{.underline}, then [the]{.underline} former [idea of
ontological objectivity **evaporates**]{.underline} with the notion of
definitive borders and boundaries. In its place we find a new agential
kind of objectivity, where what defines [the research
apparatus]{.underline} is that 'the apparatus [enacts an **agential
cut**]{.underline} ... [within the phenomenon]{.underline}' (Barad
Citation2007, 175). While Barad's new materialist commitments recognise
the agency of nonhuman actants, their key argument about the
experimental apparatus is that [the decision to **observe** should be
understood as an act of **agency** within a broader
context]{.underline}. [As researcher]{.underline}, [I am an
**intra-actor**]{.underline} Footnote5 [exercising agency within a
system and participating in the construction of measurements and
findings]{.underline}. [I am **responsible** and
**accountable**]{.underline} (Barad Citation2007, 382) [for the
**entanglements** and **collapses** that I help enact with the research
apparatus and social context]{.underline}. Because the researcher,
research apparatus and object of attention are all entangled with one
another and within a broader natural/cultural and social/material
phenomenon, [the researcher has an **ethical duty** to
intra-act]{.underline} responsibly in a manner that balances a respect
for nonhuman agency [without **deflecting** responsibility]{.underline}
onto other human or nonhuman entanglements (Barad Citation2007, 391).
Through the process of becoming researcher, I emerge from the
pre-existing relation of observation, and [my entanglement within this
system entails an **ethical responsibility** to the **full description**
of my]{.underline} social and experimental [positionality within
it]{.underline}.Footnote6

In addition to Barad's exposition of entanglement as it relates to the
ethical stakes of transparency in research as a natural/cultural and
social/material process, we find a more directly political reflection in
Patricia Noxolo's quantum-inspired work on entanglement in social,
spatiotemporal and emancipatory contexts. In her application of quantum
ideas to cultural analysis, entanglement (and superposition) provides a
more direct expression of the postcolonial and postdiasporic presents to
explain and futures to explore. Similar to the work of Karen Barad, we
encounter in Noxolo's work a quantum social theory that is dynamic,
relational and agential:

Just as the post- of postcolonial is about living with a continued
entanglement with the colonial, the post- of postdiaspora is about
living with the continued consequences of the diasporic move, within the
postcolonial conditions that have motivated a wider range of movements
to former colonial centres, and which determine the conditions of
settlement. Postdiaspora denotes a legacy of diaspora but also of the
colonial, and neither is yet settled. (Noxolo Citation2020, 137)

The colonial, like the diaspora, remains entangled with the social
system of its subsequent post- form, and like any entangled system, the
latter cannot be fully understood independently. While connectedness
need not always be framed in quantum terms, the non-locality of
spatio-temporality in Noxolo's social theory clearly connects quantum
ideas with the postcolonial and decolonial. While the Newtonian
assumptions of colonial politics (see Bowman Citation2021) are rife with
local-realist reductionism, a quantum postcoloniality radically rejects
this fixed spatial scale: 'reality is not actually determined at the
local scale: [each local reality is **inextricably linked** with very
many elsewheres]{.underline}' (Noxolo Citation2020, 136). [Transversal
connections bind]{.underline} homeland, hostland and global family
[relations **far exceeding** the local]{.underline} realism of Newtonian
social science. Similarly, Noxolo frames the temporal connectivity as a
temporally nonlocal entanglement with colonial violences and histories.
'There is a very intimate, entangled affect around place and identity in
indigenous and decolonial theories,' she says, which 'starts from the
embodied self in place, and the violences done to the body, to place, as
well as to the entangled relations between them' (Noxolo Citation2018,
803). Taking this political dimension of Noxolo's project seriously, we
come to realise that quantum social theory supports decolonial and
postcolonial politics both ontologically (insofar as its relationality
gives voice to colonial, diasporic and other relations ontologically
erased by Newtonian separability) and epistemologically (insofar as the
very possibility of a quantum social theory deflates the universalising
claim to knowledge found within the tacitly Newtonian social science).

But there is something even more fascinating to be found here, at least
in the context of [this]{.underline} special issue's theme on authorship
and authority is concerned, because Noxolo's account [emphasises the
creative authority of written expression in **forwarding political
goals**]{.underline}. [It is by]{.underline} creative
[expression]{.underline} -- the authority [of activist and academic
alike]{.underline} -- through a quantum worldview [that we can
contribute to the **broader emancipatory politics** of
critique]{.underline}.Footnote7 [Language serves as the **medium** for
non-local community-building and writing can thereby **directly
support** the pursuit of postcolonial political projects]{.underline}
(Noxolo and Preziuso Citation2012, 133). Furthermore, 'decolonial
writing ... reflects very acutely on these body-place entanglements, and
the epistemic questions they raise in and for academic work' (Noxolo
Citation2018, 803). Just as Barad calls for the rejection of a binary
between nature and culture, Noxolo similarly draws on quantum notions of
entanglement to express the connectivity of body and place. We find,
also, meaningful resonance of this account of decolonial writing within
Zanotti's (Citation2018, Citation2021) quantum IR, where agents are
called to recognise their embeddedness in material/cultural phenomena
and the radical, relational responsibility entailed by that
entanglement.Footnote8 Finally, I would like to suggest that Karen
O'Brien's (Citation2021) account of transformational change becoming
possible through a recognition of our entanglements helps us to
understand the agential dimension of this decolonial project. While
O'Brien's empowering call that '**[you matter more than you
think]{.underline}**' emerges in the context of an agent facing the
existential threat of climate change and certainly resonates there, we
find a new emancipation when we read O'Brien and Noxolo in a diffracted
manner: decolonial quantum social theory asserts that the marginalised,
colonised and displaced peoples matter; that their places in the world
matter; and that their actions matter. Let us not underplay the
emancipatory significance of this quantum move.

Critical security studies and entangled observation: three insights on
authorship

[The ways we **imagine** how the world is made **shapes** what we
consider **politically possible**]{.underline}. [Knowledge and how we
validate it are **political acts**]{.underline}. Quantum ontological
imaginary repositions us vis-à-vis the universe. In engaging the world
as agents, [we do not act as **monadic**]{.underline}, perpetually
[**divided** subjects endowed with a reason capable of **understanding
God's plan**]{.underline} and elevating us closer to him, [but as
**entangled** phenomena that are part of what-is]{.underline}. We do not
act upon the world. Instead, we have agency as part of it. (Zanotti
Citation2021, 458)

Quantum IR is not the first new imaginary to be proposed in critical
International Relations (e.g. Cohn Citation1987), though its particular
path is novel. The new research community at the nexus of critical and
quantum approaches describe the quantum world as offering a novel
imaginary that challenges the positionality of the human, the
researcher, and -- most importantly for the topic of this special issue
-- the author vis-à-vis the social world, if not the entire universe
(Zanotti Citation2018; Murphy Citation2021). [The inseparability of
observers from their social relations]{.underline}, [the
experiment]{.underline}, [and the observations **challenges
fundamentally** the positivist imaginary]{.underline} grounding much of
mainstream social sciences. To this end, quantum social theory's lessons
for epistemology, methodology, ethics and politics should come as no
surprise to many critical security studies scholars -- but that, as they
say, is a feature rather than a bug. Many of the arguments voiced in
earlier moments of critical security studies (such as the broadening and
deepening debate and the methods turn) are triangulated from the first
principles of a quantum perspective. Therefore, in addition to providing
a common language to describe the entanglement of the observer to the
observed and the author to the text, there is also a freedom from
Newtonian/positivist constraints that must first be fought back against
in the earlier efforts within critical theory. This section discusses
three conceptual intersections of critical and quantum thought to help
address the question, 'What is an Author?'

Full description of the apparatus includes the observerFootnote9

[Authorship is an **essential** part of the research
process]{.underline}, just [as the designer of the apparatus becomes
**entangled** with its construction through the choices
made]{.underline} and the observer effect entangles the observer with
the ontological (and/or epistemological, depending upon the
interpretation) status of the wavefunction. This is a concern expressed
well in the language of the methods turn, from Mutlu's repudiation of
sanitised methods sections that erase researcher's footsteps to
Leander's description of the embeddedness and embodiment of ethnographic
observation. The conceptual discussion of Bohr and empirical discussion
of the Stern--Gerlach experiment provide a clear argument from a quantum
perspective for the necessity of including the researcher in the
description of the experiment. And, given that the decisions continue
far into the process of writing, [entanglement of the researcher with
knowledge-production continues well into the stage of
authorship]{.underline}.

The social construction of knowledge extends into its social context

Barad's deconstruction of the Stern--Gerlach apparatus points out how
the conditions of possibility for the production of silver sulphide rely
not merely on the materiality of a particular cigar, but also on the
cultural influences of gender, class, social norms and myriad other
factors that influence the scholar's positionality in approaching the
research process. Like Stern's cheap cigar, [we may not
**expect**]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} post-hoc, we [may **naively
ignore**]{.underline}) [the importance of social factors in contouring
the **conditions of possibility** for the knowledge production in which
we participate]{.underline}, [but recognising the entanglement of
society into research is **paramount** to ensuring]{.underline} that the
[full description]{.underline} proposed so many decades ago by Bohr can
be ensured. Here, too, we uncover the utility of quantum concepts, as
Noxolo's use of entanglement to expresses identity, continued historical
influences and relationality in postcolonial, postdiasporic and
Indigenous theories.

Authorship enacts agential cuts into the broader socio-material context

[The broader **political implications** of scholarship are]{.underline}
already [documented in the]{.underline} broadening debate and methods
turn, with the Aberystwyth school arguing for the [**inherent political
stakes** of defining **security**]{.underline} and Mutlu highlighting
the emancipatory power of openly shared knowledge. Quantum transforms
this conversation both by expanding the scope of relevant agency while
also raising the ethical stakes of responsibility in becoming entangled
with the broader research context. The author does not have a monopoly
on agency in the research process (nor even authorship). Material
configurations of computers, servers and internet connections facilitate
the recording and sharing of the written word, while [social
constellations]{.underline} support research financially, incentivise
placement in prestigious venues and [**discipline debates** to privilege
**established** and **mainstream** perspectives]{.underline}. But [at
the same time]{.underline}, the agential cut that the author makes by
participating in the production of knowledge cannot be effaced by the
existence of agency beyond the self, and [the author bears an **ethical
responsibility** to their entanglements]{.underline}. While this may
seem to be a burden or a negative statement, Noxolo's discussion of the
ability of language to foster nonlocal community-building reveals that
ethical entanglement can be as emancipatory as it is daunting.

Conclusion

Approaching entanglement through language allows us to consider that
'**[meaningful]{.underline}**' [conversations can **influence** how we
**engage with social change**]{.underline}: [when we are **aware** that
we are entangled within]{.underline} a quantum system and part of [the
phenomena that we are measuring]{.underline}, [we have **greater
potential** to **open up inquiries** with others and **generate
insights** that are **truly transformative**]{.underline}. (O'Brien
Citation2021, 70)

In the end, then, what is an author [in critical security
studies]{.underline}? Inspired by quantum social theory, I argue that
[the critical author is an **entangled observer**]{.underline}, [an
**intra-actor** who recognises the agency that emerges from the
practices and processes of scholarship]{.underline} (beyond the self)
[and the **unerasable ethical responsibility** for the agential cuts
that the author helps to enact]{.underline}. [It is not only the
definition of **what counts as security** that has **ethico-political
implications** for authors and their contexts]{.underline}. [Nor
is]{.underline} the fulsome account of [methodology]{.underline} and
social positionality of research [relevant **solely** as a matter
of]{.underline} transparency, rigour, or [research ethics]{.underline}.
Quantum social theory suggests that [these considerations are **woven
together**]{.underline}, inseparably entangled and only fully
understandable in relation to the other. Quantum IR places the
broadening debate and the methods turn in superposition, challenging all
to recognise responsibility, transparency and agency in the production
of what Karen O'Brien calls truly transformative insights.

In an important way, this recognition of the ethical stakes of academic
creativity brings our conversation on authorship back to the common root
of authority. [When we take on the **authorial role**]{.underline}, [we
enact our authority in the word and in the world]{.underline}.
[Recognising this connectivity of word to world demands]{.underline}, in
turn, [the **acknowledgement** of our entanglement in our
surroundings]{.underline}. [This is true of our place in
**institutions**]{.underline}, [our connectedness to our **subject
matter**]{.underline}, [our embeddedness in the **research process** and
beyond]{.underline}. And, [recognising the **ethical imperatives** of
entanglement]{.underline} in quantum social theory (Barad Citation2007;
Zanotti Citation2018, Citation2021), it is precisely this recognition of
the fundamental connectivity between authorship/authority that [infuses
critique with a **transformational agency**]{.underline} (O'Brien
Citation2021). As scholarship continues to explore the quantum/critical
nexus, authors will help to enact a variety of agential cuts, embedded
and embodied in the research that they collaborate to produce.

#### Representations are [prescriptions]{.underline}, not just [descriptions]{.underline}. Excluding the consequences of our [discursive justifications]{.underline} from Arctic debates [internal link turns]{.underline} any benefit to their framework---it [distorts]{.underline} our research and [lowers]{.underline} the quality of your decisionmaking.

**Nabok, 22**---Senior Lecturer, Saint Petersburg State University
(Sergey, "Main Theoretical Approaches in the Arctic Policy Studies,"
Arctic and North, 2022, no. 47, pp. 119--135, dml)

In the scientific study of international relations, international
political processes and management systems, the role of theory is
characterized by two specific features that distinguish it from other
social disciplines. Firstly, the actual [political analysis used in the
study of specific issues]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} state
**[policy]{.underline}**, inter-state relations, or international
institutions, [**rarely** relies on a **well-defined** set of concepts
and propositions that establish key relationships between the phenomena
under study]{.underline}, [is **ad hoc** in nature]{.underline}, [and
claims to **generalize** conclusions]{.underline}. Although theory is an
indispensable element of scientific discourse, its factual usefulness in
political analysis is insignificant, and [theoretical
provisions]{.underline} (which are hypotheses in the epistemological
sense) [are often accepted as **implicit suppositions**]{.underline},
[**without** reflection and critical analysis]{.underline}.

Secondly, as F. Chernoff notes, [the **prescriptive** component is
**extremely important**]{.underline} in the theory of international
relations: [although some theories seek to describe only the
interrelations of phenomena]{.underline}, [theoretical analysis often
goes **beyond** a strict description and **explicitly** or
**implicitly** formulates certain political goals and **normative
criteria** used to **evaluate** a]{.underline} certain actual or
**[hypothetical course of action]{.underline}** \[1, p. 3--4\]. The
latter leads to the fact that political [theory acts as a **discursive
justification** of a certain political model and as a **basis** for a
political narrative that **legitimizes** a certain course of
action]{.underline}.

Let us [consider]{.underline}, for example, a simple theoretical
statement, corresponding to the position of [the **realist**
paradigm]{.underline}: "[The **only** type of actors whose actions
**matter** for]{.underline} [international politics and]{.underline}
international [relations are **states**]{.underline}". [Taking this
statement as an **implicit** assumption focuses political analysis
**exclusively** on the actions and decisions taken by the highest levels
of state power]{.underline}, without even allowing the question of the
possible role of non-state actors. [If such political analysis is faced
with the need to explain the behavior of **non-state**
actors]{.underline} (for example, NPOs), [they will be interpreted
either as **insignificant** or as **instrumental**]{.underline}, that
is, as [**tools** of state actors' decisions]{.underline}. [If this
theoretical premise becomes the **basis for
policy-making**]{.underline}, [the consequence is that **any meaningful
processes** in]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations [have to be interpreted as resulting from
the decisions of **state** actors]{.underline}. Any actions of non-state
actors are construed as being inspired by the governments of other
countries, and the actors themselves are deprived of subjectivity,
including in a practical political sense.

[Such **uncritical acceptance** of theoretical propositions and the
**failure to distinguish** between descriptive and prescriptive
elements]{.underline} of theory [have **important negative
consequences** for both]{.underline} the scientific
**[study]{.underline}** of political processes [and political
**practice**]{.underline}. In a practical sense, [this **incorrectly
evaluates** information]{.underline}, [makes **erroneous
decisions**]{.underline}, [and **narrows the range** of available
behavioral strategies]{.underline}. In analytical terms, [the focus of
attention is **distorted** and the risk of **misinterpretation** of the
observed phenomena **increases**]{.underline}. For example, the
systematic efforts of China to influence the regional policy in the
United States \[2, de La Bruyère D., Pikarsic N.\] in case of uncritical
acceptance of the postulate of the state as the only actor in the world
political arena should be recognized as meaningless and not having
rational justification.

[These problems]{.underline} of the theory of international relations
[are]{.underline} also [typical for the study of the
**Arctic**]{.underline}. The [authors of publications
citing]{.underline} the results of [empirical research and political
analysis do not always rely on **clearly formulated** theoretical
positions and analytical models]{.underline}, [and the descriptive
characteristics of the subject under study]{.underline} (for example,
the Arctic strategy of a particular state) [are **explicitly** or
**implicitly** based on the adoption of certain political
**goals**]{.underline}, in according to which the situation and
decisions are evaluated. At the same time, [**explicitly formulated**
theoretical provisions play an **important role** both in]{.underline}
scientific [**research** and in formulation of **practical
recommendations**]{.underline}. [Theory performs several important
functions]{.underline}: [defines the **focus** of research and the
**specific subjects** to be studied and analyzed]{.underline};
[establishes the **content** and **relationships** between key variables
used for explanation and prediction]{.underline}; [allows to **evaluate
alternative mechanisms** for achieving political goals]{.underline}
(without a priori determination of these goals).

and International Organizations at the University of Groningen
(Benjamin, "This world of tomorrow: sociotechnical imaginaries of
security in the Canadian Arctic," Critical Studies on Security, 12(2),
187--208, dml)

[From a security perspective]{.underline}, [**climate change** is
presented as a **threat multiplier**]{.underline} in a quantitative
sense [as it increases the scale of potentialities for the Arctic's
exploitation]{.underline} against Canada's interests and sovereignty.
Building on the New Arctic's ontological foundation as a sociotechnical
imaginary, [maritime **surveillance** of these actors and the expected
increase in Arctic traffic is of]{.underline} particular
[concern]{.underline} for Canada. From a defence standpoint, [one of the
**critical challenges** currently facing the successful monitoring of
this traffic is the lack of diversity in the **number** and **types** of
sensors in the region]{.underline}. The automatic identification system
(AIS) for monitoring marine vessels, coupled with radar and satellite
linkage (Satlink), can monitor vessels that conform to broadcasting an
AIS signature. However, there are several gaps in current surveillance
capabilities. [Within this framework]{.underline}, '**[dark
targets]{.underline}**' [constitute the **most urgent**
threat]{.underline} to the DND and CAF in the region because they 'are
not picked up on sensors or cannot be identified' (Lackenbauer and
Kikkert Citation2018, 25).

Consequently, [defence specialists and practitioners argue that there is
a clear need to develop **new technologies** and **methods** to locate
and identify these objects]{.underline}, including combining sensor
platforms through a system of systems approach into a 'multi-sensor
maritime domain awareness picture' (Lackenbauer and Kikkert
Citation2018, 25). [The threats associated with]{.underline} '**[unknown
unknowns]{.underline}**' [invoke a methodological need for **mapping**
behaviours in terms of an actor's]{.underline} '**[patterns of
life]{.underline}**' when individual events are disparate, unremarkable,
and difficult to link with one another. This behaviour exists below the
threshold of threat activity [that]{.underline} may be otherwise treated
as discrete and unimportant. However, this series of behaviours [may
demonstrate an **explicit security threat**]{.underline} when analysed
holistically. An example presented in the proceedings of a defence
roundtable on implementing Canada's Arctic priorities under SSE
illustrates this securitised logic: '[a small **fishing vessel** could
be carrying a **cruise missile** or bringing in illegal **foreign
fighters**]{.underline}' (Lackenbauer and Kikkert Citation2018, 25).
[The potential infiltration of overt security threats via these dark
targets represents a **Trojan Horse** analogue made more dangerous
through its **decentralisation** into networked
sub-components]{.underline}, which can infiltrate the state's sovereign
space at different nodal points. Individual events may appear
unexceptional when viewed independently but become more concerning from
a risk-based perspective when examined holistically and relationally.

Strategically, [extending **border** practices]{.underline} is crucial
to achieving Canada's Arctic goals identified within S.S.E. Lackenbauer
and Kikkert state that Canada needs to be 'pushing the borders outward'
and that '\[d\]efence, safety, and security requirements dictate that
Canada and its allies must detect, track, and identify vessels when they
leave a foreign port and operate in Canada's \[extended economic zone\],
not just when they enter into Canada's territorial sea (12 nautical
miles from the cost or our straight baselines)' (Citation2018, 21, 24).
The notion of pushing borders outward [highlights the dual process of
rationalisation by the state towards **sovereign control** over its
northern boundaries]{.underline}. DRDC emphasises a similar theme and
the role of technological development in their S&T strategy, which
states that 'the CAF also require additional time and space to react to
threats, for example by extending sensor coverage as far away as
possible from our forces and leveraging automation and stand-off
capacity of CAF weapon systems' (National Defence Citation2014, 15, my
emphasis).In particular, 'as globalization erased traditional concepts
of time and space, making borders porous and encouraging continental
integration, national sovereignty was reshaped and the power of national
governments to control events reduced' (Dean, Lackenbauer, and
Lajeunesse Citation2014, 24 my emphasis). [The **growing porousness** of
borders renders states **vulnerable** to many emerging threats that are
increasingly]{.underline} international, if not
**[global]{.underline}**, [in their orientation]{.underline}.

[Pushing sovereignty **outward**]{.underline}, therefore,
[embodies]{.underline} both spatial and temporal characteristics via
[technologically mediated practices of **surveillance** and
**intelligence**]{.underline}, [which are combined to form techniques of
**sensing**]{.underline}. [Sensing is a **crucial** state-led technique
of **sovereign power** for providing **situational
awareness**]{.underline} (SA) [that]{.underline} '[provides]{.underline}
the Government with [the ability to perceive the physical]{.underline}
(maritime, land, air, and space) [and non-physical]{.underline} (cyber
and human) [domains]{.underline}' while 'allow\[ing\] for the fusion,
evaluation, and dissemination of that information' [to
create]{.underline} '**[intelligence]{.underline}**' (Government of
Canada Citation2010, 30). In brief, [sensing is **acutely biopolitical**
in categorising]{.underline}, [filtering]{.underline}, [and reassembling
surveillance data from multiple sensors and deploying that reorganised
data as intelligence for **state action**]{.underline}. Thus,
[technology-enabled sensing is envisioned as a **core** feature of
**expanding** and **consolidating** the state's sovereign power in the
Arctic]{.underline}.

[Projecting security through a risk framework socially creates the
potential for a **much more comprehensive** range and volume of threats
in the form of potentialities]{.underline} (Amoore Citation2013; Coker
Citation2009).While Beck famously defines the risk society as one that
is socially 'preoccupied \[with\] the future' (Beck Citation1992, 21),
the increasing salience of risk as a framing mechanism for security
practices is a more recent thematic turn and signals the influence of
actuarial management and insurance schematics on security (Lobo-Guerrero
Citation2011). [These frameworks are specifically concerned with the
**unknown unknowns** of the more distant future]{.underline},
[especially as the Arctic's melting ice may lead to challenges
for]{.underline} Canada's **[sovereignty]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} de facto control over its **[territorial
borders]{.underline}** and adjacent waters (Grant Citation2016, 30;
Lackenbauer Citation2011, 80).

security in the Canadian Arctic," Critical Studies on Security, 12(2),

[Arctic security in the modern era is **bound** with **futurity**
because threats that undermine the state's sovereignty are considered
**potentialities** rather than clear and present dangers]{.underline}.
While the term 'threat' already implies what may happen rather than what
will, [the nature of those threats as potentialities is spatially and
temporally **expanded**]{.underline}. [The risks associated with threats
**increase** as threats are **projected farther** into the
future]{.underline}, [especially concerning state
sovereignty]{.underline}, [which offers a sense of **immediacy** to the
Arctic's security in the present]{.underline}. For instance, former
Prime Minister Stephen Harper drew explicitly from this Arctic imaginary
by insisting that, in an often-cited passage, Canadians in the 22nd --
century demand action in the 21st and that Canada was at risk of
'losing' the Arctic if it did not 'use' it (Dodds Citation2012, 994).

[There is a consistent thread that **permeates** the various **Arctic
imaginaries** over time]{.underline}, [from efforts towards **colonial
expansion**]{.underline} that rested on the themes of adventure,
mystery, and taming the Arctic's wildness as a frontier space [through
the mastery of **marine navigation** to the equally colonised
imaginaries of **northward expansion** in service of]{.underline}
Canada's **[nation-building]{.underline}** efforts [and the defence of
**sovereignty**]{.underline} throughout the Cold War and now. In all
cases, [the axes of sovereign control have rested **principally** on
notions of **scientific progress** and **technological
innovation**]{.underline}. [Science and technology are **critical
vectors** of modernisation as an **idealised practice**]{.underline},
[which have **consistently underpinned** political efforts by the state
to **rationalise** and **control** the Arctic]{.underline}. Thus, [the
**goal**]{.underline} of rationalising the Arctic's spatial and temporal
vectors [is not new]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, the specific
characteristic of networked complexity and [the **intensity** of
the]{.underline} spatial and temporal [components]{.underline} (i.e. the
degree to which time and space are collapsed as impediments to accessing
and controlling the Arctic) [underlying the New Arctic implies a
**novelty** in how the Arctic is understood concerning this complexity

**Fakhoury, 25**---Ph.D. candidate in Global Studies, University of
Massachusetts Lowell (Renato, "Peoples, States, and the Arctic: Identity
and Narratives in Arctic Security Dynamics,"
<https://www.proquest.com/docview/3216782700>, dml)

Traditionally, the United States is not considered a status-anxious
state, since it possesses primacy over most hierarchies in the
international system. Diverse composite indicators8 rank the U.S. as
number 1 in regard to its military and capabilities, far from
runner-ups, and its prestige - although an abstract concept - helped
build and maintain the world order for the last century. American
positioning in the Arctic, however, is more complex than that. [The
strategic significance of the Arctic as a frontier has **increased** due
to the region's receding ice]{.underline}, [opening up new sea routes
and potential for resource extraction]{.underline}. [This shift has made
the Arctic a **focal point** for geopolitical competition]{.underline}.
[The U.S. has been **slow** to respond]{.underline}, [especially
compared to **Russia**]{.underline}, [which has significantly advanced
its capabilities in the region]{.underline}. Russia's extensive
icebreaker fleet, robust military presence, and infrastructural
developments have positioned it as the leading power in the Arctic.
**[China]{.underline}**, too, [has made substantial
investments]{.underline}, viewing the Arctic as a critical area for
expanding its influence. **[Status anxiety]{.underline}**, in this
context, [refers to the **fear** of further losing **global dominance**
and **influence**]{.underline}. [For decades]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
been accustomed to a position of **unparalleled** geopolitical
power]{.underline}, [but the Arctic presents new challenges that
**threaten** this status]{.underline}.

[**Congressional hearings** on Arctic security **repeatedly highlight**
the anxiety underlying U.S. Arctic policy]{.underline}, [particularly
the fear of **falling behind** key competitors]{.underline}. [This sense
of **urgency**]{.underline}, largely absent before the 2010s, [has
become **increasingly pronounced** as lawmakers call for a **more robust
U.S. presence** to counteract the strategic advances of Russia and
China]{.underline}. [Records **consistently emphasize** the stark
disparity in capabilities]{.underline}, such as Russia's fleet of over
30 icebreakers compared to the United States' significantly smaller and
less capable fleet, exemplifying a critical gap in Arctic readiness.

[This anxiety is further reflected in U.S. **Arctic Strategy
documents**]{.underline} from 1994 to 2024, [which reveal a **dramatic
increase** in references to Russia]{.underline}, [China]{.underline},
[security]{.underline}, [and threats]{.underline}. Recent strategies
underscore the Arctic's transformation into a contested geopolitical
arena, [calling for enhanced U.S. capabilities and a heightened presence
in response to intensifying competition]{.underline}. The shift from
viewing the Arctic as a low-priority region to acknowledging its
critical importance [illustrates how anxiety about losing status and
influence has **driven a recalibration** of U.S. policy]{.underline}.
[These documents signal a recognition that the Arctic is]{.underline} no
longer a peripheral concern but [a **key battleground** for great power
rivalry]{.underline}, [necessitating a **more militarized** and
**proactive** approach to protect American interests and sustain
geopolitical standing]{.underline}.

Historically, the U.S.'s passive Arctic stance stemmed from its
strategic focus on other regions and a perception of the Arctic as less
immediately critical. However, the aggressive expansion of Russian and
Chinese investments and activities in the region has forced a
reevaluation. Now [faced with catching up in a region where its
competitors have gained significant footholds]{.underline}, [the U.S.
has embraced a **more assertive** Arctic policy]{.underline}. [This
shift exemplifies how status anxiety]{.underline}, [fueled by the rapid
advancements of rivals]{.underline}, [can **catalyze strategic
action**]{.underline}. [Congressional hearings and policy documents
**increasingly reflect** this anxiety]{.underline}, underscoring the
pressing need for the U.S. to strengthen its Arctic capabilities to
safeguard its geopolitical interests and maintain its global standing.

Conclusion

In this paper, I analyze how [the evolution of U.S. Arctic policy
reflects a **broader narrative** of status anxiety]{.underline}, [which
has served]{.underline} not as a paralyzing force but [as a **catalyst**
for **strategic recalibration**]{.underline}. Historically, the Arctic
was peripheral to U.S. foreign policy, viewed primarily through the
domestic lens of Alaska and rarely integrated into the country's global
strategy. However, [the changing geopolitical
landscape]{.underline}---marked by the rise of Russia and China as key
players in the region---[has **redefined** the Arctic as a critical
frontier for great power competition]{.underline}. The [analysis of U.S.
Arctic policy]{.underline} documents and Congressional hearings [reveals
a **pattern**]{.underline}: [the **increasing securitization** of Arctic
discourse aligns with a growing recognition of the region's strategic
importance]{.underline}. [Anxiety about losing influence in the Arctic
has propelled the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [toward **more proactive**
measures]{.underline}, [including alliance-building]{.underline},
[infrastructure investments]{.underline}, [and heightened military
engagement]{.underline}. This shift underscores the dual nature of
anxiety: while it signals vulnerability, it also motivates states to
adapt and innovate in the face of perceived challenges.

By reframing anxiety as a constructive force, this paper contributes to
a deeper understanding of the emotional drivers behind state behavior.
[Status anxiety]{.underline}, in particular, [offers a **compelling
lens** for interpreting how hegemonic powers like the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [respond to emerging
threats]{.underline} in contested regions. [The Arctic's
**transformation** from a zone of **cooperation** and **idealism** to a
theater of **competition** illustrates how anxiety can **reshape**
priorities]{.underline}, [**galvanize** action]{.underline}, [and
**redefine** geopolitical landscapes]{.underline}.

### Link---Climate---2NC---Arctic

#### The 1AC [disrupts]{.underline} desecuritized Arctic cooperation by narratively connecting Arctic climate change to the fate of the planet.

**Grassl, 22**---Master's Candidate, Development and International
Relations, Aalborg University (Theresa, "Disrupting 'Arctic
Exceptionalism'? A Qualitative Discourse Analysis of the Securitization
of Climate Change in the EU's Arctic Policy,"

dml)

Firstly, [the macrosecuritization of climate change]{.underline} can be
considered what Buzan & Wæver (2009:261) call a physical threat
universalism that [relates to the construction of a physical threat as a
**global danger**]{.underline}. [While this move has the]{.underline}
"[physical **fate of humankind**]{.underline}" (ibid:261) [as the
referent object]{.underline}, [it utilizes the physical changes that the
**Arctic** experiences due to climate change to **exemplify** the
dangers that arise]{.underline}. [The **securitizing move**]{.underline}
therefore inevitably also [contains a securitization of climate change
in the Arctic]{.underline}, depicting a physical threat, which can be
observed. The securitization of a threat depends on [its **acceptance**
by the audience]{.underline}, which [is **required** to establish
**exceptional measures**]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} the [Arctic
states **accept** the necessity of exceptional measures to combat
climate change]{.underline}, [the issue is **moved** from the stage
of]{.underline} politicization and its handling within [**normal
politics** to an **exceptional** space]{.underline}. [This equals a move
**away** from the state of **desecuritization** that is the
**foundation** for]{.underline} the concept of [Arctic
exceptionalism]{.underline}. Looking at the EU's Arctic policy, the
Arctic states have rejected such an attempt as part of the push for
"enhanced governance" (Damanaki 2011c:2f; European Commission 2008a:9f).

Secondly, [the]{.underline} EU's [securitizing move serves as a source
of insecurity **even if** the securitization of climate change is **not
accepted**]{.underline}, [as it creates **unpredictability** by
**deviating** from the rules that are established within the social
arrangement in the Arctic]{.underline}. The integration of both the EU's
Climate Change Discourse and the concept of Arctic Exceptionalism into
the relational ontological security framework is depicted in figure 7.

[Arctic Exceptionalism as a trust system traces back to the]{.underline}
cross-sectoral [**desecuritization** of Arctic relations that became
**institutionalized** in the Arctic Council]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} resulting [**silencing** of security matters and
**compartmentalization** of Arctic politics]{.underline} stand as
routines within the social arrangement that [result in **stability** and
**predictability** and enable **peaceful cooperation**]{.underline}. The
EU's [climate change discourse has the potential to
**threaten**]{.underline} Arctic Exceptionalism, which is built upon
[these routines]{.underline}, and creates unpredictability. In reaction
to this, Arctic states have three options on how to react, namely
refereeing, performative deference, and obstructive resistance. The 2008
initiative to enhance governance in the Arctic was resisted and the EU
referred to the upkeep of state sovereignty (Damanaki 2011c:2f; European
Commission 2008a:9f), thus preserving social arrangement and the
elements of Arctic exceptionalism.

#### Climate emergency frames [empower]{.underline} technocratic elites and provide [cover]{.underline} for exclusion and militarization.

Sustainability Governance at University of Toronto (Steven, "Existential
security and the governance challenge: Confronting the antinomies of

dml)

[The proliferation]{.underline} in practice [of]{.underline}
"**[emergency]{.underline}**" [frames in climate change
discourse]{.underline} illustrates this tension in a way that
[**mirrors** the more general logic of securitisation
moves]{.underline}. [Who gets to]{.underline} "**[speak]{.underline}**"
[security is]{.underline} often [the very issue at stake]{.underline},
[even when emergency narratives **claim** to be in the service
of]{.underline} "**[humanity]{.underline}**" and survival. As Patterson
et al. (2021, 841) write:

[Emergency frames may convey the **urgency** necessary to avoid further
destruction of the environment]{.underline} ... thereby opening up new
political possibilities for consensual sustainability action ...
\[[They]{.underline}\] [may **also** resonate with longer term patterns
of **inclusion**/**exclusion**]{.underline}. [Emergency frames demanding
**sweeping action** by the government could afford **political
coverage** for unpopular actions]{.underline} ... Yet, [poor and/or
minority communities may **lose voice** if emergency frames are oriented
towards **quick fixes**]{.underline}.

Specifically, [the]{.underline} "**[climate emergency]{.underline}**"
[frame may]{.underline} "[**empower** a **technocratic elite** and
**undermine**]{.underline} a plurality of [goals and]{.underline}
political [creativity necessary to address **justice** and
**well-being**]{.underline} concerns bound up in sustainability.
[Deploying emergency-as-strategy could **normalise** a pre-emptive logic
that could **close down debate** and **legitimise** otherwise
**unpalatable** options]{.underline}" (Patterson et al., 2021, 845).

[This is **not** an **abstract** debate]{.underline}. [Concerns that
macrosecuritisation will default to]{.underline} planetary solar
radiation management (a form of **[geoengineering]{.underline}**) [are
playing out in **real time**]{.underline}. They reflect concern about
solar geoengineering\'s uncertain, unequal or possibly self-undermining
effects. But even more so, they attack the legitimacy of great powers --
or worse, the US as the world\'s current leader in solar geoengineering
acting unilaterally -- to speak for humanity absent new governance
arrangements that confront "problematic structures that may currently
exist in some institutions and regions" (Táíwò & Talati, 2022: 13).
These debates are complex: [some worry explicitly about
increased]{.underline} "[risks of **militarisation**]{.underline} or
securitisation" (Stephens et al., 2021) [while others worry more about
incorporating relevant knowledge and voices]{.underline}, for example,
from the global south, [and more generally inclusive collective decision
making]{.underline} (Táíwò & Talati, 2022). [These are]{.underline} not
[debates]{.underline} "for" or "against" securitisation -- those arguing
for a plurality of voices assiduously avoid speaking securitisation or
desecuritisation for others -- but [about the **power dynamics** often
undertheorised in such moves]{.underline}.

#### Pandemic securitization is a [Trojan horse]{.underline} for the pharmaceutical industry. Their rhetoric causes [structural violence]{.underline}, [global imperial warfare]{.underline}, and makes disease and antibiotic resistance [worse]{.underline}.

Western Sydney University (Paddy, "Pharmatechnologies and the ills of

Justice*, Chapter 12, pp. 221-225, dml)

[In the]{.underline} commercially driven [process of securitizing
health, knowledge production plays a **crucial role**]{.underline},
operating both as a tool and a good. [Security as a commodity requires
the consumer (here the public, the state and the medical profession) to
**buy** (**literally**) into a belief that the security products offered
are effective in **obviating** or at least **weakening** the risk of
disease or illness. This further involves ensuring that any risk
involved in consuming the product]{.underline}, in this case the
vaccine, [is **overridden** by the threat posed by the disease against
which it is affording protection. Creating a **vigorous market** for
business in a **competitive environment**]{.underline}, as studies of
corporate crime have consistently shown, [can involve a **range of
deviant** and **criminal strategies** and **activities**, including
**fraud**, **corruption**, **intimidation** and **bribery**, activities
that are **ubiquitous** and]{.underline}, in some cases, [**systemic**
within industry. Historically 'Big Pharma' has a **poor track record**
for ethical behaviour]{.underline} (Braithwaite 1984; Dukes et al. 2014;
Gotzsche 2013; Griffin and Miller 2011). Healy observes that unlike
other health-risk businesses such as tobacco and the chemicals industry,
in which 'the best studies systematically point to hazards where they
exist' and where company studies tend to be a small component of
evidence-production, often viewed with suspicion as being partial, the
same does not pertain to the pharmaceutical industry:

[with pharmaceuticals often the **only studies** are those of the **drug
companies themselves**, and these studies]{.underline}, as one might
expect, [all seem to point to the beneﬁts of an **ongoing use** of the
**very chemicals** that **may in fact be causing the
problem**]{.underline}. (Healy 2012: 119)

Alongside vested-interest knowledge production, [the pharmaceutical
industry engages in other nefarious activities. These include
**obstructing the publication** of negative data]{.underline} from
clinical trials in medical journals, which are often ﬁnancially
dependent on industry for advertising and the sale of reprints;
[**intimidating whistle-blowers** amongst medical researchers and
doctors]{.underline} concerned about the safety of particular drugs;
[and the ubiquitous practice of **aggressively promoting products** to
the medical profession including providing **ﬁnancial inducements** to
win support]{.underline} for a particular drug (Gotzsche 2013; Healy
2012; Moynihan 2001). [Nor are these deviant and harmful practices
occasional aberrations, but instead reﬂect recidivist behaviour
**embedded** within the industry]{.underline} (Braithwaite 1984; Dukes
et al. 2014).

[Despite a **long history** of insalubrious behaviour in the
pharmaindustry, governments]{.underline} and intergovernmental
organizations such as the WHO [continue to focus on **pharmaceuticalized
solutions** to what are arguably **pharmaceutically constructed** health
risks]{.underline}. [While **obfuscating** or **down-playing** the
safety issues around the escalating administration of medical
interventions, the pharmaindustry's intensified participation in
research and policy-making enables it to **construct narratives of high
risk** around both the **nature** of diseases and their **prevalence**,
and **exaggerate the efficacy** of its products, thereby creating an
**ever-expanding market**]{.underline} (Healy 2012; Gotzsche 2013).
[This is especially the case in a product that is administered to a
population]{.underline}. The vaccine industry is highly proﬁtable not
only because of its numerical reach but because, in an increasing range
of jurisdictions, vaccines carry a mandatory status.

[These policies, which]{.underline} for critics of mandatory medical
intervention, [are regarded as a **blatant violation of human rights**,
have been **legitimized** through the **discursive modalities of
securitization**, in much the same way that **torture** and
**extraordinary rendition** were **reconstructed as necessary** for the
protection of the very phenomena they were consistently
eroding]{.underline} (Chossudovsky 2005). [In both cases, where the
market operates as a **crucial driver**, in which **defensive mechanisms
are for sale**, whether **vaccines** or **arms**, there must be **no
limitation to demand**. Creating demand through the security narrative
and ensuring supply through mandate enables the **constant
proliferation** of an industry which **simultaneously protects** and
**destroys**. Excessive protection **can only lead to
destruction**]{.underline} ([consider the **proliferation of nuclear
arms**]{.underline} during the Cold War in what was termed MAD ---
mutually assured destruction). Esposito captures this in his
consideration of [the process of **over-immunization** as a political,
juridical as well as bio-political phenomenon, whereby 'the warring
potential of the immune system is so great that at a certain point it
**turns against itself** as a **real** and **symbolic catastrophe**
leading to the **implosion of the whole organism**]{.underline}' (2011:
17). Yet, as has been made clear in the aftermath of the global
financial crisis, [the **voracious appetite** of the market in its
neoliberal manifestation **continues apace** ignoring the social and
economic cannibalism of excessive profit---seeking. For the
pharmaindustry that involves the presence, **real** or **imaginary**, of
a **constant threat** of **disease** and **infection**.]{.underline}

State of infection

In its 2006 action plan to 'increase vaccine supply' the WHO informs us
that 'Inﬂuenza vaccine development and employment are critical elements
of pandemic inﬂuenza preparedness'. In explaining how serious this risk
of a pandemic actually is, and the consequent justification for spending
billions of dollars on ﬂu vaccines globally, the WHO slips into
'Rumsfeldian discourse' describing the 'the global burden of seasonal
inﬂuenza' as an 'unknown' (WHO 2006). We are now familiar with unknowns
in their both knowable and unknowable states as being crucial to the
extension of state power with its affiliate abuses. The 'unknown burden'
of seasonal ﬂu has occasioned not only the mass manufacture of a vaccine
that, in its current stage of development has proven to be less than
effective (Gallagher 2015), but also the introduction of mandatory
policies around the inﬂuenza vaccine for health workers and other
professionals (Babcock et al. 2010). Indeed, mandating a range of
vaccines has now become established practice in a number of countries
including the US, Australia, France and Canada, with the UK being a
notable exception.

Mandatory creep has been occurring over the past few decades, overriding
the hitherto right to abstain from vaccination programmes on the basis
of religious or 'conscientious objection' (a term originally used for
nineteenth-century vaccine objectors and subsequently adopted by the
military for those who refused compulsory conscription on similar
grounds) in many cases leaving medical exemption the only acceptable
criterion for refusal. Vaccine programmes involve mass immunization or
herd immunity in which a large percentage of the population is required
to be vaccinated against a disease to ensure its control and hopefully
gradual eradication, thereby protecting those who cannot be vaccinated
against possible infection. Unlike other medical interventions, [the
focus here lies on the protection of the **population** rather than an
**individual**]{.underline}. For Foucault, immunization represents a
distinctive break from other medical relationships which seek to heal
the individual, but operates as 'a way of individualizing the collective
phenomenon of the disease, or of collectivizing the phenomena,
integrating individual phenomena within a collective field, but in the
form of the rational and identiﬁable' (2004: 60). [This brings another
dimension to the philosophy of reponsibilization that dominates the
neoliberal concept of health, a paradoxical position that transforms
individual accountability into **sacrifice**]{.underline} (for even the
strongest advocates of mandatory vaccination admit there is no such
thing as one hundred per cent safety). [It is a **subtly crafted moral
sleight of hand** that turns adherence to the market of and for
pharmatechnologies into an **abnegation of self**, where the self
operates not simply as **part** of the collective but as **subservient**
to it]{.underline}: capitalism functioning through a 'communist' guise.
Human rights can thus be dismissed as 'nonsense upon stilts' or perhaps
worse still, as the greatest threat to human rights itself.

Given that the 1948 Declaration of Human Rights emerged from inter alia
some of the most horriﬁc medical abuses ever recorded it is even more
ironic that the policy of mandatory vaccination is proliferating. It
contravenes human rights contained within a number of conventions which
establish individual autonomy regarding medical intervention. This
includes Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights on the
respect for one's private life, that is 'the right not to be physically
interfered with' (Liberty 2015) and more speciﬁcally, the International
Covenant on Political and Civil Rights protection against 'torture or to
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no
one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific
experimentation' (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
1966).

[The combined rhetoric of security and science, **fundamental** to the
**justification** and **waging of war**, not only **assuages** the
retraction of human rights obligations by the state but can render these
rights themselves as **presenting a threat**. As the war on
disease]{.underline}, together with that on terror, [has **no defined
end**, **no clear moment of victory**, being **non-territorial** insofar
as it has no physical jurisdiction]{.underline}, the suspension or
weakening of human rights will continue and further entrench the
'paradigm of security as the normal technique of government' (Agamben
2005: 14). In this environment vaccine [objection **easily slips into
criminalized activity** and criticism **appears as unpatriotic**.
Concerns over conﬂict of interest, data manipulation, bribery and
intimidation are turned into **politicized opposition** and those who
voice these concerns become **enemies of the people**, a **security
threat**, **health terrorists**]{.underline}. In this context,
[**punitive measures** against those who refuse, both for themselves or
on behalf of those under their guardianship, are also becoming **more
draconian** and can range from financial penalties, the exclusion of
children from day care centres, loss of jobs]{.underline} (within the
medical profession) [or even prison]{.underline} (Willsher 2014).

Informed consent lies at the heart of the numerous instruments for the
protection of the human body; the notion of bodily integrity underpins a
series of rights that have been allocated to citizens in democratic
states, including the right to abortion. When the information aspect of
informed is either denied or contains negative data concerning safety it
is rational to assume that consent might not be always forthcoming.
Collusion between industry and politics is a major concern, as
Eisenhower warned. Mary Holland's critique of mandatory vaccination lays
out the extent of these collusive relationships in the US, which were
even admitted by politicians themselves:

In 2000, a Congressional report on Conﬂicts of Interest in Vaccine
Policy Making identiﬁed notable conﬂicts of interests in the FDA
\[Federal\] and CDC \[Center for Disease Control\] advisory bodies that
make national vaccine policy. These include 'advisers' ﬁnancial ties to
vaccine manufacturers' as well as 'advisers' permitted stock ownership
in companies affected by their decisions'. (Holland 2012:77)

Declaring these activities in Congress has not deterred their
occurrence. In 2007, an attempt was made by the erstwhile Governor of
Texas, Rick Perry, to mandate the HPV vaccine in his state's schools, a
decision he was subsequently forced to overturn when it was revealed
that Merck, the company that produced the Gardasil vaccine, had given
donations towards his nomination (Eggen 2011). Nor will this be the last
cosy relationship between politics and industry as mandatory vaccination
policy continues to be applied to an increasing number of vaccines.

Conclusion

[Pharmatechnologies manifesting as]{.underline} medical research, drug
production and distribution, [epistemological paradigms determining how
health, disease and risk are to be conceptualized and negotiated, have
now become a mode of governance in an **increasingly authoritarian
environment**. This is **not to detract** from the benefits accrued from
medical progress through pharmaceuticals and the important role played
by vaccines in alleviating potential suffering. Yet, the **benign
discourses** within which they operate can often **obscure harmful
outcomes**, harms imposed as **structural violence**: **opaque**,
**unidentiﬁable** and **normalized**]{.underline} (Zizek 2009).
[Victimization remains **unseen** or as a **necessary price to pay** for
the **greater good**]{.underline}. In medical terms aspects of these
harms are referred to as iatrogenesis, the unintended, often injurious,
consequences of medical intervention. In this latter context it is akin
to what military circles euphemistically term 'collateral damage',
generally applied to the killing and maiming of non- combatants.
However, some scholars who study state and corporate harms are less
inclined to semantic generosity, not least when [the **majority** of
damage and injury inﬂicted falls on the same targets, the
**socio-economically vulnerable**, **gendered**, **racial**, **ethnic**
or **other minorities** whose lot it is to comprise the **ﬂotsam** and
**jetsam** of **ruthless markets** and the **politics of indifference**.
Intention, or lack of]{.underline}, as they argue, [**cannot disguise**
the power relations at play as the **usual suspects** emerge as
**perpetrators** and **beneficiaries of systemic abuses**.]{.underline}

[If]{.underline} we are to accept the argument put forward by Tombs and
Whyte that '[The problems caused by corporations --- which **seriously
threaten** the **stability of our lives** --- are **enduring** and
**necessary functions** of the corporation]{.underline}' (2015: 4), [a
position supported by a plethora of cases, then **all industry operating
within a capitalist framework is intrinsically pathological**. It is
essentially a **diseased entity**, **irrespective** of the **nature** of
goods and services produced or the **rhetoric** that designates it as
benign]{.underline}. Ironically, [this diseased entity in combination
with an increasingly diseased political system, proclaims and even
persists that it has both the authority and ability to produce and sell
health. Yet, so strong is the belief in pharmaceuticalized health that
so many literally buy into the 'truths' of pharmatechnologies **failing
miserably** to discern how the **contagion-riddled commodification** of
health is **actually the greatest danger** to health]{.underline}.

[No business thrives on the **elimination of demand** for its goods. The
**technologies of war** were justiﬁed through the eventual establishment
of peace; so too the pharmaindustry **legitimizes its existence**
through **claims to health** and **healing**. The existence of both is
**dependent** on the perpetuation of the **very phenomena they claim to
defend us from**, and in this they **must continue to be producers of
war** and **sickness**. No longer does the potential for the disastrous
rise of misplaced power exist]{.underline}, as Eisenhower warned, [it
has become **fundamental** to the industries of war and disease, to war
on disease.]{.underline}

and International Organizations at the University of Groningen
(Benjamin, "This world of tomorrow: sociotechnical imaginaries of
security in the Canadian Arctic," Critical Studies on Security, 12(2),
187--208, dml)

Local and regional [dynamics in the Arctic increasingly embrace a
**global security imaginary** as the **ontological root** of
contemporary threats]{.underline}. [The Arctic security imaginary can be
understood as a **securitised understanding** of the world mediated
by]{.underline} '**[endemic]{.underline}**' or 'environmental'
[threat]{.underline} (in the sense that threat is omnipresent, spatially
and temporally) (Massumi Citation2015, 27) [legitimating **pre-emptive
action**]{.underline} 'premised to a significant degree upon the
exercise of the imagination' (Stockdale Citation2013, 146). The Arctic
is often invoked as a site of significant interest given its potential
for future transportation routes and generating many of the planet's
remaining extractive resources (though that potential may be
overstated). Further, the Arctic invokes a sense of wonder through its
natural and atmospheric distinctiveness. Indeed, [the Arctic is often
portrayed as **terra nullius** primed for human
exploration]{.underline}, which has long been captured in adventure
stories and has served as a metaphor to illustrate the struggles of the
human condition. Likewise, the Arctic is often presented as [a
**homogenised** space divorced from history and the lived experiences of
those who call the North home]{.underline}. This reductionist
understanding of the Arctic is captured by Daniel Chartier's concept of
the 'imagined North'. The imagined North

falls into differentiated imaginaries -- the 'North', Scandinavia,
Greenland, the Arctic, the poles, even the winter -- that are often
presented as an amalgam supported by a simplification of forms --
horizontality -- and colours -- white, pale blue, pink hues --, by the
presence of ice, snow, and the complete range of cold, by moral and
ethical values -- solidarity --, but also, by its connection with a
'beyond' where the Arctic begins, at the end of the European ecumene and
the beginning of a 'natural', unknown, empty, uninhabited, and remote
world: the Far North. The entirety of these representations forms a
system of signs, what I call here out of convenience 'the imagined
North'. (Chartier Citation2018, 9--10)

For Chartier, the two dominant forces shaping the imagined North are
Indigenous colonialism and the Arctic's administration by governments
with capitals in the 'South, who administrate according to their
knowledge (seldom based on experience) and the circumstances of their
own needs' (Chartier Citation2018, 11). While the imagined North is
de-historicised and defined through the intersection of 'emptiness,
immensity, and whiteness' that strips 'the human experience of the
territory' (Chartier Citation2018, 15), [the Arctic]{.underline}, in
particular, [is]{.underline} also [**securitized** and
**futurized**]{.underline} ([in the sense that our dominant
conceptualisation of the Arctic is in terms of its **expected
future**]{.underline}) [through]{.underline} the fusion of these
characteristics with vulnerability, specifically to the proliferation of
global forces, including climate change (Dittmer et al. Citation2011).
Similar to the Anthropocene imaginary described by Harrington
(Citation2022), the New Arctic draws on some of the familiar tropes of
bareness and elemental life while simultaneously alluding to the
destruction of those qualities through Anthropocene politics, which rest
on [a cache of **spectacularized representations** of]{.underline} what
climate change means for [the future of the Arctic and]{.underline} its
representation [of a **dying world** writ large]{.underline}.

Futurizing the Arctic as a social and political imaginary is not
entirely new, as colonialist adventure and resource exploitation
narratives have fuelled the settler imagination since at least the late
19th and 20th centuries. Security was not the core feature of the
imaginary at this time, but [science and technology]{.underline} were
and [continue to be **critical narrative vectors** of this
sociotechnical imaginary]{.underline}. [Science and technology are
understood to be the tools of **conquest** and
**modernisation**]{.underline} while deploying epistemic actors (e.g.
scientists) as voices of authority who (re)shape sociotechnical
imaginaries through that authority.For instance, science was often
positioned as a core trait of modernisation and valued in its potential
to support northern expansionism for Canada's nation-building
endeavours. The Canadian Arctic and the Indigenous people that inhabit
it were often portrayed as inferior and southerners as civilising
colonial agents. A Globe and Mail article from 1937 illustrates this
portrayal, stating, 'Eskimos of the Arctic coast have benefited by
invasion of the white man' who 'taught Eskimos how to trap and have
improved the Arctic natives' standard of living' (Globe and Mail
Citation1937). The Arctic was imagined as an empty space, similar to the
way that colonialism imagined the 'New World' into existence. The
colonial-future imaginary was deployed more bluntly in another Globe and
Mail article published in the same year (Citation1937b). As that piece
argued,

Millions of the white race some day will find an invigorating home in
the Far North, a scientist about to embark on his fourth Arctic research
trip predicted today\[...\] The vast expanse of the Arctic can and will
in the future be occupied by millions of white people living in health
and comfort.

Likewise, the Arctic was principally framed through this colonial
imaginary towards the end of World War II as the source of Canada's
future wealth and expansion as a nation; an Arctic Eldorado that was
mischaracterised as a '"frozen waste" \[and\] useless and conquerable'
(Davies Citation1944, 79). As Davies further argued, 'that the Arctic is
difficult to win is granted. But not impossible' (1944, 79). The
reification of science and technology for northward expansion was
especially apparent during and the years after World War II as
communications and aviation technology improved dramatically and
positioned Canada's Arctic territory at the centre of a future global
aviation regime linking Toronto to the world's other major cities (see
Globe and Mail Citation1937, Citation1943a, Citation1943b, 1944). As the
Globe and Mail stated in 1944, "\[p\]lanes flying from Chicago to Moscow
would pass over \[the\] North Magnetic Pole and \[the\] North Pole,
while those bound for Bombay would cross Northern Quebec" (Globe and
Mail Citation1944).

[Technology as a **product** of and **tool** in service of Arctic
modernisation and nation-building was **routinely
mobilised**]{.underline} in the media. As with other examples, the Globe
and Mail illustrated this tendency in an early commentary on how
technology is 'opening up' the Arctic:

In 1782 the French fleet entered a desolate region, where fur trading
was the only activity. The British sloop steamed into a modern harbor,
in which, during the season of navigation, vessels from many countries
cast anchor \[...\] This is an amazing change also from the earlier
period when Sir John Franklin and his crew of 129 disappeared while
searching in Arctic waters for the northwest passage.Radio keeps
navigators informed of conditions on Hudson Bay; airships hover above,
and the peril of its icy waters is greatly minimized. The Arctic is
opening up. Northward also the course of Empire takes its way. (Globe
and Mail Citation1937)

[The]{.underline} post-war [dream of the Arctic's centrality to a
**modern global network** of metropoles is]{.underline} of the
liberal-modernist vein, where aviation and communications technology
represented part of what Miller describes as the 'post-war rise of
globalism as [a **technoscientific ideal**]{.underline}' (Citation2015,
278). Indeed, this technoscientific ideal was likewise [deployed as an
image of **control** and **mastery** over the Arctic's
frontier]{.underline} quality as part of the same nation-building
efforts. On this point, Davies argued [that]{.underline} 'Science must
be called upon to uncover the secrets of the Arctic. There is no
financial profit here for individuals. But there is a challenge to the
explorer, the scientist. Canada must stand the expense. The Northwest
Passage will only be opened by science' (1944, 81). The potential for
global air travel [signalled the Arctic's transformation]{.underline}
from a cultural imaginary infused with symbolic layers of mystery,
adventure, and elemental bareness [into a **sociotechnical imaginary**
of modernity and a space that could finally be **mastered** through
technological progress]{.underline}, a 20th-century conquest of nature.

The Arctic as a frontier for nation-building continued to excite the
post-war imagination, epitomised by Prime Minister John Diefenbaker's
'Canada of the North' speech in 1958 (Harrington and Lecavalier
Citation2014, 108), a vision that never materialised. However, the
Arctic's centrality as a potential aviation hub was also a critical
threat in the post-war years.The Arctic's transformation into a
geostrategic theatre became more pronounced after 1945, and the Cold War
broadly transformed east-west relations such that it provoked additional
calls for scientific research and technological development for North
American defence (Verrall and Heard Citation2022; Wiseman Citation2015,
Citation2022). [The **strategic reality** created by long-range bombers
capable of **nuclear payloads** required **early warning** capabilities
in the Arctic]{.underline} to protect and defend southern targets in
Canada and the United States.

This environment resulted in Canada's joint efforts with the United
States to build the Distant Early Warning (DEW) Line, [which required
new developments in **automatic detection**]{.underline} (Lajeunesse
Citation2007; Naka and Ward Citation2000).[Within this new strategic
calculus]{.underline}, [the Arctic occupied a pre-eminent position
within]{.underline} what Matthew Farish (Citation2010) calls
[the]{.underline} '**[cybernetic continent]{.underline}**'. According to
Farish, the Arctic was regarded as a frontier zone populated by the
intersection of military and scientific interests and actors supporting
the 'production of a cybernetic continent', which was a 'task of
projects that drew from physics, strategy, and much else, but did so at
the specific behest of Cold War imperatives' (Farish Citation2010, 150).
The Arctic was conceived as one strategic centre in a globalised world
that served to amplify science and technology as the primary solution to
this strategic reality. Notably, these Cold War efforts demonstrate an
important line of consistency with contemporary strategic thinking in
the Arctic as they rest on particular [sociotechnical imaginaries
of]{.underline} '**[presumed emptiness]{.underline}**' (Farish
Citation2010, 179) that [**underpin** the materialisation of **sovereign
control** through science and technology]{.underline}. [Sensing was a
**critical aspect** of this materialisation]{.underline} as
technological capabilities evolved on both sides of the Atlantic and was
represented by continental defence efforts, including the DEW line, and
developments in naval sensing technology supporting undersea
surveillance apparatuses to detect submarines (e.g. the Arctic Sound
Surveillance System project in the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) gap and
project Spinnaker in Canada) (Dean, Lackenbauer, and Lajeunesse
Citation2014, 9; Tamnes and Holtsmark Citation2014, 28; Weir
Citation2006).

Following the end of the Cold War and a brief lull in interest by Canada
and other states after the 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks, the
Canadian federal government signalled its continued interest in Arctic
defence research in the early to mid-2000s. This phase began as
Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper routinely spoke of the Arctic
as a core frontier of Canada's national boundaries (Dodds Citation2011).
Within the political zeitgeist of this time, the Arctic was (and at
times continues to be) routinely framed as a space ripe for capitalist
exploitation and interstate conflict over resources and transport routes
in the near-to-distant future. Such discourses have likened recent
geopolitical interest in the Arctic to the late 19th century's surge of
colonial expansion in Africa as European imperialism reached a crescendo
(Borgerson Citation2008; Huggan Citation2015; Steinberg and Dodds
Citation2015). While such comparisons have been challenged as
analytically ill-conceived for several reasons (see Claes and Moe
Citation2014), there are certain regional similarities in that both
Africa and the Arctic are represented through sets of overlapping and
often competing imaginaries that are historically contoured as othered
spaces.

Importantly, in this era, [the issue of]{.underline} '**[situational
awareness]{.underline}**' [found a more emphatic connection to Arctic
security and governance]{.underline}. There is also a clear continuity
between the Harper era and current Arctic surveillance initiatives being
pursued by the Trudeau Liberals, for instance, through the recent All
**[Domain]{.underline}** Situational **[Awareness]{.underline}** (ADSA)
programme (National Defence Citation2017a; National Defence
Citation2018), particularly as technological innovation relates to
intelligence products that contribute towards the visualisation and
rationalisation of Canada's Arctic territory. Sensing [practices are
designed to **illuminate** the Arctic using]{.underline} a range of
spectrum and sub-spectrum [imaging techniques]{.underline}, [which are
also productive in delineating the state's **territorial
boundaries**]{.underline} through these products.

[Within the]{.underline} logic of the [Arctic security
imaginary]{.underline}, [visualising the boundaries and dynamic
activities]{.underline} (including environmental patterns) [is
**critical** to achieving **all-domain awareness** and defending against
a **spectrum** of future threats]{.underline}. Within a security lens,
[this **futurized imaginary** is defined by overlapping
discourses]{.underline} and semiotic layers [that produce the Arctic as
a space requiring **securitised** forms of intervention and]{.underline}
'[structure the **conditions of possibility** for the management of
future uncertain events]{.underline}, and the limits of potential
intervention in the alleviation of future threats and dangers' (Salter
Citation2019, 4--5). The Arctic's natural, unknown, and empty qualities
as the imagined North lend themselves to a securitised understanding of
space by which the Canadian state must respond, given that its de facto
sovereignty is threatened (i.e. the state's material control of the
Arctic). Security practices represent one form of that response. They
are performances of sovereignty similar to that described by
Wood-Donnelly, who argues that states are materialised as political
actors 'through the repetition of rules, or norms, that the community of
states recognizes as legitimate behaviour. To do this, they borrow from
a toolkit of recognized symbols ranging from the spectacular to the
mundane' (such as postage stamps) (Wood-Donnelly Citation2019, 13).
Drawing on the symbols that underpin the imagined North constitutes one
(although not total) avenue of understanding the Arctic and shapes the
dominant forms of governance (including security practices), which are
likewise representative of the state's symbolic and material authority
across its territory.

[The sociotechnical imaginary is]{.underline}, therefore, [**more** than
imaginative]{.underline} in a figurative sense; [it is a **knowledge
matrix** that forms a **system of meaning** that contours the parameters
of **sovereign control** and **intervention**]{.underline} (Latham and
Williams Citation2013, 13, 27). Thus, while multiple semiotic systems of
representation mobilise a core set of symbols towards different
imaginaries, **[not all imaginaries are equal]{.underline}**. [Because
these representations are invested with and through **relations of
power**]{.underline}, imaginaries embody that power. Within a
securitised sociotechnical imaginary, [threats are constructed and
mobilised through]{.underline} core thematic drivers of
**[representation]{.underline}** and understanding, where space is
rendered in terms of vulnerability. In turn, [the future is **made
insecure** through specific systems of meaning that **directly
condition** the logic of sovereign intervention]{.underline}.

### Link---Hegemony, Leadership, Etc---2NC

#### The 1AC securitizes the threat of US decline, creating a [self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline} of status anxiety among great powers.

**Fakhoury, 25**---Ph.D. candidate in Global Studies, University of
Massachusetts Lowell (Renato, "Peoples, States, and the Arctic: Identity
and Narratives in Arctic Security Dynamics,"
<https://www.proquest.com/docview/3216782700>, dml)

Conversely, [**status anxiety** affects higher-ranked actors witnessing
a **decline** in]{.underline} one or more dimensions conferring [status
compared to a rising competitor]{.underline} -- in this case, the United
States and its perceptions of Russia and China. In such instances, these
actors perceive a threat to their overall rank, instigating a fear of
demotion or status anxiety. While ontological anxiety concerns internal
coherence and narrative disruption, status anxiety reflects fear of
diminished external recognition. In this paper, both are entangled: [the
U.S. fears losing not only **strategic influence**]{.underline}, [but
also its identity as **Arctic leader**]{.underline}. It is crucial to
note that [status anxiety is not merely **any** incongruity
in]{.underline} the [statuses]{.underline} of a high-ranked actor, as
even dominant actors seldom rank uniformly high across all dimensions.
Instead, [status anxiety pertains to a **specific** incongruity arising
from the **perceived competition** of an actor poised to surpass them in
one or more areas]{.underline} (Onea, 2014). For example, the post-Cold
War dominance of the United States is more pronounced in military
capabilities than in economics or prestige, without instigating status
anxiety. However, if the U.S. appears on the brink of being overtaken by
another state in any of these dimensions, status anxiety ensues.
Consequently, status inconsistency in one actor is likely to trigger
status anxiety in another, as an improvement in one dimension for the
former implies a simultaneous reduction in available status for the
latter, leading to perceived threats to self- esteem. In line with
Tajfel and Turner's (2010) argument, even [the dominant]{.underline} or
high-status [group may experience insecure social identity]{.underline},
[prompting them to **resist** perceived threats and **uphold** their
superior position]{.underline}. Therefore, [status anxiety serves as a
**motivating factor** for dominant actors to **impede** the progress of
new entrants]{.underline}, [**maintain** superiority]{.underline} in
areas where they excel, [and **recuperate** losses]{.underline} in those
where they have fallen behind.

Onea (2014) describes that three major hierarchies confer a polity
international status, and, in order for a state to dominate the others,
it would need to excel in all of them: military capabilities, economic
capabilities, and prestige. Whenever a state experiences a change in
rankings under these three aforementioned hierarchies, a discrepancy of
status and will to balance or rebalance them would occur. Additionally,
should a dominant state perceive a threat to its standing in any of
those three dimensions due to the ascent of a competitor, it would
experience [status anxiety]{.underline}. Consequently, this anxiety
[propels dominant states to **resist** assertions of equality or
superiority from emerging powers]{.underline}. This resistance can be
elucidated by the principles of prospect theory, which posit that status
anxiety is more keenly felt than status inconsistency. This is
attributable to the psychological tendency to resent losses more
intensely than gains, implying that a decline in status holds greater
significance for an actor than further advancement. Consequently,
[dominant powers are inclined to adopt a **more risk-acceptant** stance
compared to rising powers]{.underline}, [as they strive to **safeguard**
their established status]{.underline}. Conversely, rising powers tend to
be more risk-averse and, therefore, more inclined toward conciliation.

Besides the conceptualization of status anxiety, Onea (2014) also
describes the methods through which to identify it in international
relations through a three-step process. First, one should \"encounter
evidence that it was the dominant state's intransigence that affected
the initiation and the continuation of rivalry\" (Onea, 2014, p. 138).
Second, one should monitor primary sources from decision-makers, such as
official statements, speeches, correspondence, and memoirs. [The
**confirmation** of status anxiety is evident when decision-makers
express **apprehension** about]{.underline} the [decline]{.underline} in
their state's standing compared to a competitor and harbor concerns
about the potential displacement by the emerging power. Third, there
should be policies reflective of a heightened sense of physical threat,
indicating that the **[security language]{.underline}** employed by
policymakers was [**actually translated** into **material
action**]{.underline}.

### AT: Alt Causes/Can't Undo Securitization

#### Voting neg generates [uniqueness]{.underline}. As the audience of the 1AC's security narrative, your choice choice to accept or deny it has [material significance]{.underline}.

**Jacobsen, et al, 24**---Assistant Professor at the Royal Danish
Defence College's Centre for Arctic Security Studies (Marc, with Ole
Wæver and Ulrik Pram Gad, "Introduction: Analyzing Greenland in Arctic
Security," *Greenland in Arctic Security: (De)securitization Dynamics
under Climatic Thaw and Geopolitical Freeze*, Introduction, pp. 8-10,
ST=security theory, CSS=critical security studies, dml)

ST was born during the 1980s' polarized debate between traditional
security studies and various scholars arguing a 'widening' of what
counts as security, spearheaded by critical security studies (CSS)
(Wæver 2003). On the one hand, ST joined CSS in criticizing the
traditionalists for their understanding of security as only taking place
within military affairs and only involving states. Both agreed in
widening the concept to encompass things going on in spheres
traditionally seen as distinct from security, such as the economy, the
environment, and identity (Buzan 1983). On the other hand, the explicit
ambition of ST was to discipline this extension of what could count as
security, seeking "[to **avoid** the slippery slope of]{.underline}
'**[everything is security]{.underline}**,'" by formulating a precise
criterion delimiting when things happening outside traditional security
domains nevertheless qualified as having a security quality (Buzan and
Wæver 2003, 71). As part of a wider constructivist movement, [ST saw
security as being discursively and intersubjectively
constructed]{.underline} (Wæver 1995, 55) [in a self-referential and
contingent process **constantly open** for restructuration]{.underline}
(Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998, 204). Specifically, [ST defined
security as the result of **speech acts**]{.underline}: [something
becomes a security issue not by virtue of its inherent nature but
through the interplay between securitizing **actors** and
**audiences**]{.underline} (Wæver 1989, 1995).

Until then, critics of traditional security studies, such as CSS or
today 'human security', tended to base their case for change on pointing
to new threats---environmental, economic---as being more important to
actual human beings, and thus motivating a change beyond an order based
on traditional state security. But they thereby repeated the operation
of the analytical observer enacting 'threat measurement' and telling
people what were the 'real' security urgencies. As illustrated in figure
1.1 (adapted from Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998, 205), traditional and
critical security studies disagree fundamentally about whether social
relations in broad generality are given or constructed. These two main
opponents in IR theory, however, are alike in embracing a substantial
idea about what objectively constitutes 'security,' even if they
disagree about what that substance is. In contrast, ST posed a radical
constructivism regarding the substance of security: [Security pertains
to whatever an actor can **convince its audience** of]{.underline}. The
political import of [this approach]{.underline} was to [**raise
awareness** of **all** participants]{.underline} in the security field,
practitioners and analysts, [to be aware of their **responsibility** in
deploying the **powerful tool** of security talk]{.underline}, [rather
than assuming that they were just **reporting** on]{.underline}
'**[threats]{.underline}**' (Wæver 1999).

Speech Acts of Security, and Desecuritization

ST operates with a continuum for how a given society may deal with an
issue, ranging from nonpoliticized (when something is not an issue for
public policy or collective action) to overpoliticized (normal) to
securitized (allowing exceptional measures) (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde
1998, 23-- 24). Specifically, according to ST, a [securitization happens
when a securitizing actor]{.underline} with a significant ethos
[declares a valued referent object to be **existentially
threatened**]{.underline}, [and a **relevant audience** accepts the
possible use of extraordinary means to avert the threat]{.underline}
(Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998, 36). In a standard, Western setting,
with a liberal self-understanding, typical [extraordinary
means]{.underline} to avert existential threats to the standard referent
object---the sovereign nationstate--- include secrecy, surveillance,
border closings, deployment of violent force, and suspension of
democratic debate as well as civil and liberal rights that would have
been respected if the issue had remained on the lower discursive level
of normal politics (Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde 1998, 23--24). These
measures [are always in play to **some extent** already]{.underline},
and in some societies to a high degree, [so the point about
securitization is that a securitizing actor creates an opening for
measures that otherwise **would not have been possible** and that this
shift of the boundary of possibility is enacted with a reference to
**threat** and **necessity**]{.underline}. [Even the **most powerful**
actor declaring an emergency situation **cannot be sure** that it **gets
away with it**]{.underline}; [authority is **always put at stake** in
securitizing attempts]{.underline}. In this way, [the audience is both
**decisive**]{.underline} (Wæver 2003, 11) [and **passive** since
**only** if the audience **explicitly denies** the securitization
act]{.underline}, [it can be concluded that the attempt at
securitization was **unsuccessful**]{.underline} (Buzan, Wæver, and de
Wilde 1998, 26). The audience's receptiveness to the securitization
attempt is related to a series of facilitating conditions2 like the
authority of the securitizing actor, the historical precursors of the
articulated threat, and logics internal to the rhetoric of
securitization (Wæver 2003, 14-- 15).3

### AT: Debate Doesn't Spill Out

#### Debate is [co-constitutive]{.underline} with the realities we discuss. "No spill-out" arguments are [depoliticizing]{.underline}.

**Greaves, 16**---Ph.D. candidate, Department of Political Science,

CS=Copenhagen School, dml)

[This emphasis]{.underline} is ironic, however, because the CS
**[denies]{.underline}** the role of security analysts as securitizing
actors themselves, overlooking [how the identity of the analyst
**matters** to securitizing processes they examine]{.underline}. The CS
sees analysts and actors as "functionally distinct": the role of the
former is restricted to examining the actions of the latter in producing
securitizing moves or successful securitizations.244 They insist, "the
security analyst \[is\] in no position to assume the role of the
securitising actor at any point in the analysis."245 But
[this]{.underline} is inconsistent with the CS's own radically
constructivist approach, since it **[minimizes]{.underline}**:

[the role of the]{.underline} political ([social]{.underline})
[scientist in **co-constituting** political reality]{.underline} ...
[The]{.underline} securitisation [analyst in]{.underline} writing
(**[speaking]{.underline}**) [about a particular social reality is in
part **responsible** for the co-constitution of this very
reality]{.underline}, [as by]{.underline} means of her own [**text**
this reality is (re)produced]{.underline} ... [In]{.underline} writing
or [speaking security]{.underline}, [the securitisation
analyst]{.underline} herself **[executes a speech act]{.underline}**;
[this speech act is **successful** if the problem raised becomes
**recognised** as a security problem]{.underline} in the academic
literature and/or in the wider policy- making discourse.246

Certainly, analysts examine the securitizing moves of others, but while
doing so will either support the validity of the securitizing move,
(re)producing the issue as a security issue, or critique its empirical
validity or successful social construction, undermining its
security-ness. Clearly, "[when]{.underline} security
[analysts]{.underline} '**[observe]{.underline}**' [acts of security of
security moves]{.underline}, [the analyst has **immediately
contributed** to the politics of the process by
**recognizing**]{.underline} ([or **not recognizing**]{.underline}) [an
actor as a security actor and a securitizing move as being
**successful** or **not**]{.underline}."247 Especially when analysing
non-traditional security issues, [analysts **cannot avoid** challenging
or reproducing their security-relevance]{.underline}, as evidenced by
studies of such diverse phenomena as: gender,248 migrants,249 illegal
drugs,250 HIV/AIDS and other epidemic diseases,251 capitalist
consumerism,252 and human-caused environmental change.253

This conclusion is hard to avoid using the Copenhagen School's own
constructivist logic. [It is more **theoretically consistent** and
**intellectually honest** to consider analysts as securitizing actors
who help **construct** in/security by contributing **epistemological**
and **theoretical** innovations that **widen**]{.underline} ([or
**narrow**]{.underline}) [the field of security research]{.underline},
[and by articulating particular threats they consider **worthy of
investigation** or **urgently requiring action**]{.underline}.254
Conversely, [they may work to **desecuritize** issues they consider to
be inappropriately or problematically constructed as security
threats]{.underline}. [**Denying** the securitizing role of analysts
contributes to the **naturalization** of the security phenomena that
they study]{.underline}, and overlooks the role of experts in
co-constituting their fields of study. Just as important, acknowledging
expert analysts as co-constituting political reality recognizes the role
they play in conferring academic authority to particular conceptions of
in/security, and the influence they sometimes exert over political and
public opinion.

### AT: Extinction Outweighs

#### Artificially inflate the magnitude of our impact to the level of extinction. Justifying securitization because "extinction outweighs" legitimizes [genocidal violence]{.underline} which is [experienced as existential]{.underline} to marginalized communities.

**Hobson and Corry, 23**---Postdoctoral Research Associate at the Centre
for the Study of Existential Risk, University of Cambridge; Professor of
Global Security Challenges in the School of Politics and International
Studies at the University of Leeds (Tom and Olaf, "Existential security:
Safeguarding humanity or globalising power?," Global Policy: Next
Generation, 2023 (14): 633--637, dml)

Existential Security follows prominent thinkers in ERS (Bostrom, 2013;
Ord, 2020) in proposing that 'humankind' or 'civilisation' is
increasingly existentially threatened, largely as a result of 'our'
Pandoran relationships with technological systems we cannot comprehend,
or our Icarian hubris in developing artefacts that exceed our capacity
to control them. Sears correctly noted that 'security literature
currently lacks a theoretical and policy framework for existential
threats to humanity' (2020, p. 255), yet [the first step of this
securitising move]{.underline}---[the identification of]{.underline}
'**[humanity]{.underline}**' or civilisation [as the object to be
secured]{.underline}---[involves its own set of risks]{.underline}.
[Adopting humanity as a **referent object** potentially belies a
**multiplicity** of entities or identities]{.underline}; as a process,
[it **should not be done** without **engaging** with the history of
contestations concerning where the **boundaries** of
humanity]{.underline}---let alone civilisation---[lie]{.underline}
(Barnett, 2018). [A **singular** notion of humanity risks
**homogenising** all humans]{.underline} (Agier, 2010) [though the
question of **who qualifies** as]{.underline} '**[human]{.underline}**'
in the sense of being distinct from nature [has **historically
excluded** certain people]{.underline}, grouped instead with nature as
'savages' etc. (see Patel & Moore, 2017). Those included are articulated
as one vulnerable biological population and potentially one
species-agent of history. [Protecting a **singular**
humanity]{.underline} or civilisation---[increasingly a feature of
**debates** about global challenges]{.underline} and risks---[**glosses
over** and potentially **(re)produces** inequities and
asymmetries]{.underline}, [both in terms of **exposure** to extreme
risks and their **production**]{.underline} (Cremer & Kemp, 2021).
Aggregation of the world\'s human population---both present and
potentially also an unspecified number of future generations---into the
biological species category of humanity, or the cultural entity of
civilisation within ERS, is, therefore, a much more performative move
than many scholars in the field realise.

3 EXISTENTIAL RISKS -- OR THREATS?

In addition, to place a certain category of risk in the position
previously held by threats in [security discourse]{.underline}---as that
which renders the referent object in need of emergency assistance and
protection---also requires scrutiny. The tendency within both the
Existential Security framework and the field more broadly, to gloss over
differences between 'risks' and 'threats' elides the different
conceptual histories and connotations they carry. Where a threat
provides the urgency to security in its direct and 'looming' nature,
risks can be uncertain and distant. A threat implies a direct causal
chain of harm, while risk pertains more to second-order conditions of
possibility for future harm (Corry, 2012). Risk thereby [**broadens**
the scope of]{.underline} '**[security]{.underline}**' [to a **more
pervasive** politics of unease and a **proliferation** of security
measures and **generalisation** of the politics of the
exception]{.underline} (Aradau & van Munster, 2011). Cremer and Kemp
(2021) have drawn attention to the consequences of this conflation of
risk and security in Bostrom\'s (2019) 'Vulnerable World
Hypothesis'---with Bostrom [advocating for the **urgency** of extensive
exceptional measures in order to secure against the very **conditions of
possibility** of an existential threat]{.underline} being realised.

To roll preparedness against potential risks into the politics of
security may well aid preparedness against systemic or distant risks but
could also facilitate a deeper and wider securitisation than anyone
would originally have wished for. With [humanity]{.underline} or
civilisation [as the referent object]{.underline} and
[risks]{.underline} being a new threat, Sears effectively pointed to [an
emerging politics of **total risk-security** that potentially becomes
**all-pervasive**]{.underline}. This should prompt a questioning of the
politics of securitisation of this scale, at the very least asking what
is---and who defines---humanity, and how are uncertainty and ambiguity
translated into security logics?

4 UPSCALING SECURITISATION THEORY?

The framework proposed by Sears borrows the 'grammar' of security as it
evolved within a national and international security framework, as a
part of the reason of state, politics of necessity and exception (and a
Schmittian notion of politics), transposing it onto a 'planetary' level.
Doing so he assumed the logic or grammar of security is unchanging
despite fairly radical shifts in context: 'Ultimately, the theoretical
logic of security as protection from threats to the survival of some
referent object is unchanged by variation in its empirical content'
(2020, p. 257). But is it?

The origin of Securitisation Theory in conceptual history makes it
doubtful whether the grammar of security can be neatly changed from
sovereign to existential security. Although articulated as a formal
model or 'framework for analysis' (Buzan et al., 1997), for Ole Wæver,
the grammar of security is historically produced, albeit evolving with
great inertia. Securitisation theory is explicitly just a model
(simplification) that takes its point of departure in a dominant
emanation of security (in the 1990s). The point was precisely to
critique broader notions of security favoured by critical scholars by
taking seriously how the concept currently (or then) functioned (Wæver,
1995) namely in terms of post-World War II discourses of national
sovereignty and the emerging Cold War context of competing societal
models (not just clashing militaries). The shift from ministries of
'war' to institutions of 'national security' from around
1940---particularly in the newly hegemonic United States---provided the
context for Wæver\'s critique of those scholars who argued security
ought to be about non-military matters including environment, poverty,
or gender equality, without considering what the security-language game
and its 'us-and-them' logics would do to the politics of those fields.

We might therefore argue, on the one hand, that [the notion of
existential security **overestimates** once again how **plastic** the
concept of security really is]{.underline}---assuming not just that it
ought to be disconnected from the national security frame, but that it
necessarily or already is, perhaps due to the functional need to deal
better with global risks. [The danger here is a **grafting**
of]{.underline} what is essentially [national security practices onto a
planetary context]{.underline}. On the other hand, Sears\' proposition
of an existential security framework, by adopting the existing grammar
of security, helpfully poses the question: what form should security
discourse and practice take in an age where catastrophic hazards are
seen to proliferate, and where the impacts of these hazards will
necessarily transcend the boundaries of the nation-state. How dependent
is security as a practice on institutions and discourses of sovereignty,
raison d\'etat and exceptional measures? In the worst case, [declaring
security a planetary goal **smuggles in** an attendant global state
ontology]{.underline}. Sears\' proposition therefore forces us to ask:
is national security really obsolete, or do we only wish it to be so, in
relation to existential risks?

5 CONCLUSION

Essentially, what existential security does is not simply an innocent
recognition of a growing mismatch between the 'means of destruction'
(planetary scale) and the 'modes of protection' (national security) that
needs correcting in favour of the former. It is itself a securitising
move that constructs a universal humanity or civilisation in need of
security protections.

The question is then: will existential security bring necessary
emergency measures of a collective kind to bear on emerging catastrophic
global threats, or erode 'normal' politics of domestic and international
society (to the extent that these exist) and potentially legitimate a
pursuit, not of global interests, but of a hegemonic set of interests
posing as humanity? Again, we feel the Schmittian lesson ought to be
learned here: [in both defining humanity as an object of governance and
in deciding the means through which it might be secured
globally]{.underline}, [the **sovereign** is promoted as that which can
do the **choosing**]{.underline}. [Liberal order has already been marked
**not** by a **rejection** of **war**]{.underline},
**[violence]{.underline}**, [and **interventions**]{.underline}, [but by
these being **justified** in terms of securing life and the
human]{.underline} (Dillon and Reid, 2009). In simpler terms, [there is
a **danger** that existential security will be the practices of a
**global security elite** performed **within**]{.underline}, [and as an
**extension** of]{.underline}, **[existing international
hierarchies]{.underline}**.

[Others have argued that a common humanity could be located as a
**pre-political space** from which the **unity** needed to tackle global
threats could be located]{.underline}---an 'epochal consciousness' as
Dipesh Chakrabarty (2015) calls it. This is (perhaps) desirable, but
[**any** notion of collective global interest is **inevitably already
shot through** with particular]{.underline} (geo)political
[positions]{.underline} and interests. The persistence of 'the
international'---the division of the social world into multiple uneven
units (Rosenberg, 2006)---means that [**any** universal
category]{.underline} (of human or civilisation) [will be **partial** or
lodged in partial political communities]{.underline}. [Legacies of
**violence** and **extinction** perpetrated in the name of humanity and
civilisation make for a **bad track record**]{.underline}. Added to the
statist baggage of existing security practices and discourses, [the
potential **violence** of enacting security measures in the name of
protecting a planetary]{.underline} or species [category
**should**]{.underline} therefore [**not be overloo**ked]{.underline}.

### AT: Extinction Justifies Aff Reps

#### This [naturalizes]{.underline} securitization---"existential threats" need not be [security]{.underline} issues. The alt [solves]{.underline}, meaning their impacts [can't]{.underline} justify their reps.

**Kivimäki, 25**---Department of Politics, Languages and International
Studies, University of Bath (Timo, "Is Securitisation a Natural and
Useful Response to Existential Threats? Introducing the Idea of
Peacification," Social Sciences, 14(1), 43, January 2025, dml)

[The concept of security demands the definition of a referent
object]{.underline}, while the traditional understanding of security
also requires the identification of an intentional agent that poses an
existential threat to that object. [In this framing]{.underline}, the
[safety]{.underline} of individual countries, regions, alliances, or
groups [is **threatened** by geopolitical challengers]{.underline},
[terrorists]{.underline}, [or oppressive autocrats]{.underline}. [The
ability to]{.underline} deter, contain, **[stop]{.underline}**, [or
**destroy** such dangerous actors is]{.underline} therefore [seen as a
means to **ensure safety** from violence for the actors in
focus]{.underline}. [Existential threats **justify** such
measures]{.underline}, [and it is thus considered **natural** for
authorities to speak]{.underline} (inject via speech)
[issues]{.underline} of organised violence [into the realm of security
to **justify extraordinary measures** to repel such
threats]{.underline}.

While securitisation theory generally views securitisation as something
negative, it assumes that the choice to securitise or not is natural and
without alternatives. Although the theory often criticises the move from
a threat (or even an unfounded existential threat) to securitisation
(see, for example, Buzan 2006), it does not offer an alternative. For
instance, it does not suggest that [it is possible to speak an issue
area that constitutes an existential threat into the realm of
**peace**/**conflict** rather than
**security**/**insecurity**]{.underline}. Furthermore, while the theory
reveals how an issue area is spoken into the security realm, it does not
challenge the naturality of the way this realm is
constituted---specifically, how [defining something as a security issue
justifies **power-centric** and **secretive**]{.underline}, [rather than
**dialogical**]{.underline}, [approaches]{.underline}. Instead, the
theory implicitly accepts the naturalness of securitisation as a
response to existential threats. The very word "security" already
prescribes responses to securitised issue areas; if security is the
objective, we must define whose security is being discussed, and often
also identify the agent causing the existential threat. [It
is]{.underline} precisely [this **naturalisation** of the move from
**existential threat** to an agent-centric **security** realm that needs
to be **questioned**]{.underline}.

Instead of framing organised violence as an agent-focused security
matter, [we might consider viewing the referent object and the
threatening agent as parts of a **relationship** that causes both
parties to act in threatening ways]{.underline}. In this perspective,
[the security framing]{.underline} adopted by both parties [could
**constitute** the **threatening relationship**]{.underline}, [as each
side perceives the other as the threat whose behaviour must be changed
by resorting to security measures]{.underline}. [The **crucial
issue**]{.underline}, then, [is the **jump** from]{.underline}
"**[existential threat]{.underline}**" [to efforts at]{.underline}
"**[security]{.underline}**"---[a jump that must be **problematised** if
we seek alternative ways to address existential threats]{.underline}.

To address [this]{.underline}, the article [introduces an alternative
framing that may be **more effective** in reducing atrocious
violence]{.underline} and its associated threats. [Instead
of]{.underline} "**[securitising]{.underline}**" issue areas generally
linked with organised violence, the article proposes the
"**[peacification]{.underline}**" of such issue areas. The existence of
this alternative [**challenges** the naturalisation of security
framing]{.underline} in matters of organised violence. To demonstrate
that this alternative is not merely a naïve idea unsuited to the real
world, the article provides correlative evidence that undermines the
assumption that security framing is associated with containing organised
violence. On the contrary, [higher levels of **security** framing are
associated with higher levels of **violence**]{.underline}, [while
higher levels of **peace** framing]{.underline}---and a higher ratio of
peace to security framings---[are]{.underline} both [correlatively
associated with a **reduction** in violence]{.underline}.

### AT: Link=N/U

#### The alt can [undo]{.underline} existing securitization---empirics prove.

**Camicia, 24**---Master's candidate in International Security Studies,
Charles University (Martina, "Perceptions of Threat: Analyzing the
Security Dilemma in the Arctic Region through the Lenses of
Securitization," <https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/195267>,
dml)

In the United States' case study, [the security dilemma has deepened
**differently**]{.underline}. In fact, [**Obama**'s administration has
**deliberately chosen** **not** to securitize the Arctic]{.underline}.
Applying Lupovici's theory of the securitization of the SD to the
Obama's administration, it is noticeable how Obama deliberately choose
to securitize the environmental threats in the Arctic in place of
military issues. Furthermore, President Trump and Biden have started
identifying Russia (and China)'s military presence in the Arctic as
threatening and worthy of attention. However, [even if during
**Biden**'s Presidency securitization occurred]{.underline}, [there have
been signs of **mitigating** the SD]{.underline}.

[These findings comply with the notion of importance of the **social
construction** of threats]{.underline} in the SD. [The **drastic shift**
between **Obama** and **Trump**'s narrative is an example of how threats
are a result of the expression of **intersubjective thoughts** in a
given securitizing actor]{.underline}. The most interesting finding is
that [the change in perspective did not depend **solely** on the course
of international events but depended on the setting and prioritization
of the **political agenda**]{.underline}. [**Obama**'s
administration]{.underline}, even if it stretched until 2017, continued
seeking to achieve its goals and [**did not securitize** the Arctic in
military terms]{.underline}. [**Trump** and **Biden**'s
administrations]{.underline}, on the other side, [have depicted Russia's
activities in the Arctic as a national security issue]{.underline}.

Conclusion

To conclude, this research has shown how [the security dilemma is
affected by **threats** and **perceptions**]{.underline}, and how
historical events play a role when undergone a process of fuelling
insecurities and the social construction of threats. Starting with the
Russian Federation and conducting [a **qualitative
analysis**]{.underline} of the speeches and doctrines available from
2007 (the year used as a benchmark for Russia's activities in the
Arctic), focusing in 2014 and 2022 as major years, where a change was
expected. Starting from 2014 securitization is identified as both the
élite's discourse and the doctrines identify a threat and envisage
measures to counter it, but still room for international cooperation is
envisaged to keep the Arctic peaceful. With 2022, the securitization of
the Arctic increased, in parallel with the security dilemma. With little
to zero dialogue between the parties, the feeling of being threatened by
US/NATO's closeness increased. As regards the US, on the other hand, the
major change in the narrative occurred after Obama's Presidency, when
the focus on what threatens the national security shifted from climate
change to the necessity to increment the military expenditures and the
capabilities deployed.

This study [emphasizes how the **language** used is **fundamental** in
the creation of threats]{.underline}, [and how politicians have the
**choice** to construct the menace]{.underline}. [**Contrary** to the
**realist** view of the security dilemma as an **inherent** feature of
the international system]{.underline}, [the theory of securitization
shows that the threats are **socially constructed**]{.underline}, [and
how politicians have the **choice** to **mitigate** the security
dilemma]{.underline}. To answer to the initial research question, "How
does securitization in the Arctic region affect the security dilemma?",
the main takeaway of this work is that threats, perceptions and the lack
of dialogue contribute to the deepening of the SD. It outlines how
threats are constructed and the role played by fear and lack of trust.
Dual-use capabilities are at the centre of warfare and fear and
supposition of the 'adversary's use of them are a key element in
choosing whether or not securitize a certain geographical region. While
the transfer of findings of this thesis is not completely possible, it
increases the applicability of the theory of securitization. In fact, it
showed how historical events are not directly influencing the SD, but it
depends on the actor's choices and how they construct threats. In this
work, securitization is intended as a combination of processes, and
regrouping them by time frames and years has given an understanding of
how the élite framed the threat.

### AT: Neorealism

#### Neorealism is either [incomplete]{.underline} or [non-responsive]{.underline} to our threat construction arguments.

**Runesson, 24**---Master's Candidate in International Affairs, Linnaeus
University (Linn, "The Arctic: A Stage for Great Power Competition?,"
<https://lnu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1933832/FULLTEXT01.pdf>,
dml)

[The]{.underline} conventional [constructivist branch **agrees** with
several of the neorealist tenets as it]{.underline} connects
constructivism with rationality (Agius 2019: 84), and furthermore [seeks
to study actors]{.underline}, [norms interests and
identity]{.underline}, [and to uncover the **casual relationships** and
**deductive mechanisms** between them]{.underline} (Checkel 2008, as
cited in Cho 2012: 301). This means that conventional
[constructivism]{.underline} in a sufficient way [can]{.underline} work
to [**complement** neorealism and]{.underline} thus in the end
[contribute]{.underline} with [a **more holistic analysis** of the
**Arctic** security strategies and policies of **Russia** and
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Hopf
(1998) further states that conventional constructivism aspire to give an
account for how identities and their so called 'associated reproductive
social practices' result in certain actions (Hopf 1998: 183). In other
words, [**identities** are considered]{.underline} to be
**[foundational]{.underline}** [for feasible causes of
action]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} also [play a **crucial part** in
telling you and others who you and they are]{.underline}, [which results
in **different sets** of **interests** and **preferences** depending on
what actor they refer to]{.underline}. In contrast to neorealism
[constructivism also adds another layer]{.underline} to identity [by
arguing that a state identity is **not solely** based on
**self-interest**]{.underline}, [but that it also needs to be realized
within its own historical context]{.underline} (Hopf 1998: 175, 184).

[Similarly to neorealism]{.underline}, conventional [constructivism also
**agrees** that the state is a **central actor** when
theorising]{.underline} and that states ally against threats,
[but]{.underline} points to that although constructivism is susceptible
to the balance of threat concept, [the neorealist perspective **lacks**
a theory of **threat perception**]{.underline}, which is something that
the constructivist 'account of identity' can offer. Identities can
furthermore contribute to the production of a state's actions, both
domestically and internationally, as they are potentially partaking in
shaping the state's constitutive practices (Agius 2019: 85; Hopf 1998:
186--187, 193). Cho (2012) emphasises the same thing by stating that
[the changeable identity and interests of a state lays the
**foundation** for its actions]{.underline} (Cho 2012: 305). [A state's
identity also relates to]{.underline} so called role identity and rights
and behavioural norms which are based on [how the state is
**recognised** by other states]{.underline} (Wendt 1999: 228), where
"enemy" and "friend" are two prominent examples of role identity. Wendt
(1999) argues that when defining those roles, the most significant
factor to consider is the interdependence, or so called "intimacy"
between the Other and the Self. When the intimacy is high between the
Self and the Other, states can be unable to define their own roles as a
certain position might be forced upon them by the representation of
Others, Others that might do so in order to ensure that their own
identity is ensured. As this occurs it can thus be difficult for states
to abandon the role that has been enforced upon them (Wendt 1999: 228).
Cho (2009) follows along the same line by stating that [when cultures
and norms create a collective identity]{.underline}, [this]{.underline}
collective in turn [**shape** state's **interests** as well as its
**policies**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} that [it is a **must** that
the state act according to what its identity and interests
direct]{.underline} (Cho 2009: 81--82). Relating to this is the notion
of power, as conventional constructivists believe that [power
is]{.underline} to be [found **everywhere** since]{.underline} "[social
practices **reproduce** underlying power relations]{.underline}" (Hopf
1998: 185), and that many of the assets that are often attributed to
states such as egoism, the meaning of power and power-seeking, are all
in fact actually formed by the international system (Cho 2009: 88).

The concept of identity can further be connected enmity, which is the at
the end of the spectrum of roles regarding "relationships governing the
use of violence between Self and Other, distinct in kind from rivals and
friends" (Wendt 1999: 260). [By using this as a **starting point** in
understanding how the Other and the Self is represented]{.underline},
[one can **predict** and **explain** events within a certain social
system]{.underline}. An example of this is when the Others are
represented as an enemy, which means that they are not willing to limit
its violence against the Self since they do not consider that the Self
should have the rights to exist as an autonomous being. In a similar
fashion a rival opposes the Self by not recognising its rights to life
and liberty. [Depending on if the Other is an enemy or a
rival]{.underline}, [the level of violence one can expect from the Other
**changes**]{.underline}, [where violence between two enemies is only
limited by the]{.underline} so called 'inadequate capabilities' of the
states, which refers to exhaustion or a **[balance of
power]{.underline}** (Wendt 1999: 260--261). [The response of the states
is then built upon the concept of the Other and the perception of an
enemy]{.underline}, where they act to either conquer or destroy their
enemy. In those scenarios the decision-making process often put a strong
emphasis on worst case scenarios and negative possibilities, and as a
consequence of this tend to see military capabilities as crucial, which
makes it all the more unlikely to see cooperative moves from the enemy
(Wendt 1999: 262). Wendt thus argues that [realism gives an explanation
to power politics by using the perceptions of Other and Self as a
**reference point**]{.underline}, and furthermore that "[when the Other
is an enemy the Self is forced to **mirror back** the representations it
has contributed to the other]{.underline}" (Wendt 1999: 263).

When the Self is mirroring the Other, it is in other words becoming its
enemy in order to survive. In turn the hostile perceptions the Other had
about the Self will be confirmed, and as a result the Other will engage
in realpolitik as well. [This sequence of events in
realpolitik]{.underline} then [goes **round** and **round** and
can]{.underline} according to Wendt [be]{.underline} described as [a
**self-fulfilling prophecy**]{.underline} where the beliefs of an actor
"generate actions that confirms those beliefs" (Wendt 1999: 263), making
states existential threats by attributing hostile qualities to them
(ibid.). This means that states can help other states since it
identifies with it, or due to having a collective interest, which
relates to Wendt's statement about anarchy where he argues that an
[anarchy **does not necessarily** have to be a **self-helping** system
but could just as well be a **collective** security system]{.underline}
(Wendt 1994: 387--388, 240).

### AT: No Spillover To Broader Securitization

#### Arctic security imaginaries are a [testing ground]{.underline} for [global techniques]{.underline} of sovereign control.

**Johnson, 24**---Assistant Professor of Humane Artificial Intelligence
and International Relations in the department of International Relations
and International Organizations at the University of Groningen
(Benjamin, "This world of tomorrow: sociotechnical imaginaries of
security in the Canadian Arctic," Critical Studies on Security, 12(2),
187--208, dml)

Sociotechnical imaginaries are collective visions of the future
interlaced with notions of scientific progress and advancement towards
achieving or navigating that future. Sociotechnical imaginaries provide
a unique framing mechanism for understanding how the Arctic was
historically presented as a future frontier to be tamed through
scientific progress within a broader lens of economic expansion and
modernisation that populated the early 20th century and post-war vision.
The Cold War entailed a more overtly securitised imaginary, whereas the
21st-century Arctic entails different combinations of earlier
imaginaries within a contemporary field of expanded threats and
opportunities, ultimately culminating in the New Arctic. Others have
already defined [the **New Arctic**]{.underline}, but in this context,
it [is the sociotechnical expression of multiple **international** and
**global** trends underpinned by a particular interaction of
forces]{.underline}. Sociotechnical imaginaries involve ontological and
epistemological issues. State-led efforts towards enhancing sensing
abilities in the Arctic represent a specific epistemic approach to an
ontology of complexity, which resists easy and direct intervention. The
empirical material discussed in this paper is not exhaustive and should
not be seen as overly authoritative. However, as a whole, that material
demonstrates a consistent approach to understanding the contemporary
Arctic environment, and the interaction of efforts in the marine and
space domains illustrate this approach to Arctic security.

Thus, the Arctic imaginaries of the present echo some aspects of the
past. However, while the imaginary of the past portrayed the Arctic
frontier as a space that would ultimately be conquered through science
and technological superiority, the contemporary frontier dissolves in
the face of science and technology because it is those same forces that
undermine the Arctic's environmental integrity and expose it to
extra-sovereign interventions. As with any sociotechnical imaginary,
imagined futures often encounter the limits of technology, including its
socioeconomic valorisation in the world. The earlier sociotechnical
imaginary of a 'Canada of the North' never materialised for many
reasons, including the technical and economic realities of building
northern infrastructure. [It is within this wider sociotechnical lens
that sensing technologies **gain their currency** and
**form**]{.underline}, [especially as they are an **attractive policy
goal** that is malleable to multiple and possibly contradictory
sociotechnical imaginaries of the Arctic's future]{.underline}.

[Sociotechnical imaginaries thus amount to **more** than simple
**representations** and (re)produce relations of power that
**circumscribe** the dominant ontological foundations of the
world]{.underline}. Consequently, [the New Arctic is **shaping** forms
of **state intervention** and **governance**]{.underline}. This paper
has argued that the Arctic is a region considered within a relational
worldview premised on complexity and risk, which makes future threats
increasingly challenging to predict.Consequently, the New Arctic
requires techniques of sovereign power and governance that can make
sense of this environment. These techniques depend on technological
innovation related to advances in sensing capability because the sheer
complexity of this environment overwhelms human cognition.

This paper demonstrates how [the New Arctic is a sociotechnical
imaginary **shaping** the development of **sensing technologies**
designed for sovereign enforcement through]{.underline} the example of
[**space-based surveillance capabilities** and]{.underline} the use of
**[intelligence applications]{.underline}** like the BlueHawk product.
While [the Arctic represents a **unique space** where these technologies
are being **developed** and **deployed**]{.underline}, the proliferation
of sensing represents a much larger trend in geostrategic thinking.
However, [current efforts are **only possible** within the contemporary
security landscape's broader social and political context]{.underline}.
A recent evolution in that thinking flows from the Russian invasion of
Ukraine and involves the acceleration of debates on what it means for
Arctic governance. [This]{.underline} issue [speaks to the
**re-internationalisation** of Arctic security alongside its
globalisation]{.underline}, [intensifying]{.underline} the complexity
and intensity of those issues. Future research should engage with this
trend more substantially, particularly as Canada's focus on Arctic
sensing aligns with US and NORAD strategic thinking for continental
defence and as sensing technology intersects with other developments in
artificial intelligence and quantum. Overall, the cases discussed here
offer one example of [a much larger trend in **defence
thinking**]{.underline}, [and **technological development** centred on
integrating global sensor architectures to **pre-emptively secure** the
**Arctic** of today from the world of tomorrow]{.underline}.

### AT: Perm

#### Attempting to rehabilitate security remains locked within its terms\-\--attempting to redefine one example of a violent political order actively prevents resisting its very foundation

Chris **Rossdale 16**, Teaching Fellow, International Relations,
University of Warwick, "Activism, resistance and security," Chapter 14
of *Ethical Security Studies: A new research agenda*, eds. Nyman and
Burke, 2016, no page \#

The previous two sections have highlighted a number of ways in which
practices of resistance and activism engage the relationship between
ethics and security in different ways. [In]{.underline} producing
subjugated knowledges, revealing the exclusions and power relations of
established discourses, and [engaging in security practices which seek
to more directly respond to the insecurity faced by ordinary people,
they invite [an]{.mark} **[ethical response to security]{.mark}** and
insecurity]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, [it [limits our
engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} with practices of resistance [[if
we]{.mark} only [see them as exploring]{.mark} 'better' or '[more
ethical' ways of]{.mark} [providing security]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The
**more radical challenge**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the politics of
security [[comes]{.underline}]{.mark} when we see activism [[not simply
as refusing **particular orders** of security, but]{.mark} as [resisting
the **very**]{.mark} **conceptual and political [foundations of
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This final section explores such an
interpretation, looking at the ways in which the most substantive way to
engage the relationships between ethics, security, resistance and
activism comes when we view practices of resistance as (at their best)
working to deconstruct security. I begin by outlining some of the
arguments which suggest that the concept of **[[security cannot]{.mark}
so easily [be refashioned in a more ethical form]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and that thinking in terms of resistance might take us further. I then
look at how we might view such a resistance in the context of political
activism, looking at some examples from anarchist activist groups.

A number of writers have argued that the concept of [security is built
around a series of]{.underline} images, [codes and logics which render
it deeply problematic and a dangerous candidate for
rehabilitation]{.underline}. They have pointed out the ways in which
[our contemporary fascination with]{.underline} proliferating images of
[threat, danger and response]{.underline}, grounded in desperate but
impossible fantasies of control and mastery, [tends towards]{.underline}
authoritarian political formations and [the de facto legitimacy of
dominant power relations]{.underline} (Edkins 2003; Campbell 1998:
Shepherd 2008: 72--75). The pursuit of [[security serves to]{.mark}
**[contain subjects within the existing order]{.mark}**]{.underline},
promising protection in return for some level of compliance or obedience
in a manner not dissimilar to a protection racket (Spike Peterson 1992:
50--52). As Mark Neocleous notes, [[such dynamics]{.mark} serve to
**[neutralise radical]{.mark} political [action]{.mark}**]{.underline},
'encouraging us to surrender ourselves to the state in a thoroughly
conservative fashion' (2008: 4).

To understand how the pursuit of security intertwines with political
authority, it is important to recognise the dependent relationship
between security and insecurity. [Institutions and technologies of
[security can only]{.mark} [function in a context of
insecurities]{.mark}]{.underline}, which they may identify and seek to
pacify, but which they also need (and for which, of course, they are
often responsible). In Michael Dillon's terms, 'it is only because it is
contoured by insecurity, and because in its turn it also insecures, that
security can secure' (1996: 127). The nature and content of security
depends on its particular relationship with insecurity, with its
exclusions and violences and particular (political) designations of
threat. This regulative binary of security/insecurity intersects with
others that have similar effects, such as order/chaos, inside/outside
and sovereignty/anarchy. All of them regulate politics in a manner which
cements the place of political authority. On the latter dichotomy,
Richard Ashley's comments are pertinent:

On the one hand, the sign of 'sovereignty' betokens a rational identity:
a homogeneous and continuous presence that is hierarchically ordered,
that has a unique centre of decision presiding over a coherent 'self',
and that is demarcated from, and in opposition to, an external domain of
difference and change that resists assimilation to its identical being.
On the other hand, the sign of 'anarchy' betokens this residual external
domain: an aleatory domain characterised by difference and
discontinuity, contingency and ambiguity, that can be known only for its
lack of the coherent truth and meaning expressed by a sovereign
presence. 'Anarchy' signifies a problematic domain yet to be brought
under the controlling influence of a sovereign centre ... whether it be
an individual actor, a group, a class, or a political community.

(1988: 230)

As he identifies the conservatising regulation at the heart of the
sovereignty/anarchy dichotomy, so would I suggest that a similar process
is at work in the logic of security, privileging that which is
rationally bounded, coherent and compliant, and necessitating the
pacification or pathologisation of that which is not.

[Political imaginaries rooted in binary concepts limit our ethical
landscape in a variety of ways]{.underline}. As V. Spike Peterson
argues:

\[a\]s long as we remain locked in dichotomies, [we cannot accurately
understand and are less likely to transform social
relations]{.underline}: not only do oppositional constructions distort
the contextual complexity of social reality, [they set limits on the
questions we ask and the alternatives we consider]{.underline}. True to
their "origin" (Athenian objectivist metaphysics), the dichotomies most
naturalized in Western world views (abstract-concrete, reason-emotion,
mind-body, culture-nature, public-private) are both medium and outcome
of objectification practices. Retaining them keeps us locked in to their
objectifying-reifying-lens on our world(s) and who we are.

(1992: 54)

In such a context, **[[rather than seeking to rehabilitate
security]{.underline}]{.mark}** ([[and remain within this]{.mark}
security/insecurity [dichotomy]{.mark}]{.underline}), [[it might be more
productive to]{.mark} **resist, displace or [deconstruct
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This is not a simple prospect; [refusing the social fantasy of security
would]{.underline}, in Jenny Edkins' terms, involve 'facing, on a
day-to-day basis, questions many of us prefer to forget, if we can', and
'would involve a shift away from the notion of sovereign state and
sovereign individual ... would [entail the development of a new vision
of political community]{.underline}, one that was not based on the
coming together of discrete participles to produce closed systems'
(2003: 368--369). While [the violent politics of security
is]{.underline} enacted through social institutions, it is also (as the
discussion above shows) [embedded in categories of thought]{.underline}.
The binaries of security/insecurity, order/chaos, sovereignty/anarchy
and more impose a theoretical domination which conditions political
possibility in particular authoritarian ways. As such, the task of
resistance might be to break down such binaries. [This may take place
through]{.underline} mocking, subverting or outwardly refusing the
closures such binaries enact (Rossdale forthcoming-a; Rossdale
forthcoming-b), or through [embracing the proliferation of definitions
of security as a]{.underline}n aporetic [space in which 'to think and
create **new social, ethical and economic relationships** outside
the]{.underline} oppressive structures of [political and epistemological
order']{.underline} (Burke 2007: 30--31).

What I want to suggest here is that we can interpret many practices of
activism and resistance as engaging in precisely this kind of resistance
to security/insecurity; that is, not just as affirming 'more ethical'
securities (though they may also do this), but as mounting a challenge
to the conceptual and political order of security more generally. In a
sense, this is not surprising, so often is resistance framed as that
insecurity, chaos and anarchy which necessitates securing, ordering and
sovereign gestures. It is also an unstable series of interventions,
liable to recuperation within a set of security discourses which swiftly
reposition challenge as threat. Nonetheless, these
[[resistances]{.underline}]{.mark} hold [[open spaces for an]{.mark}
[ethical critique not only of **particular orders of security**]{.mark},
[but]{.mark} more generally [of **the ways**]{.mark} **in which
[security orders]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### AT: Realism

#### Realism's [inaccurate]{.underline} and [not inevitable]{.underline} in the Arctic---it's an [exceptional]{.underline} region, and [constructivist]{.underline} explanations of state behavior are more accurate.

**Heggelund, 23**---Master's candidate in International Affairs, School
of Social Sciences, University of Iceland (Ragna Mathiesen, "Thawing
Arctic Realities: Analyzing Arctic Security through the Lens of Arctic
Exceptionalism and Great Power Politics,"
<https://skemman.is/handle/1946/45722>, AC=Arctic Council, dml)

The findings from the discussion and analysis includes how [Arctic
exceptionalism **challenges** traditional]{.underline} security
theories, such as [great power politics]{.underline}, [by highlighting
the **unique vulnerabilities** and **interconnectedness** of security
issues]{.underline} in the Arctic region. [While great power politics
often prioritize **national interests** and
**competition**]{.underline}, [Arctic **exceptionalism** emphasizes the
need for **responsible governance** and **international
cooperation**]{.underline} to address environmental, human, and cultural
security concerns. The implications are that [security in the Arctic is
**not solely about military power or resource competition** but also
about preserving a fragile environment and safeguarding the well-being
of Arctic communities]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} approach
[underscores the importance of a **more holistic** and **cooperative**
security framework in the Arctic]{.underline}, [which can serve as a
**model** for addressing **global security challenges** that transcend
national borders]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [the emergence of great power competition in the
Arctic]{.underline} challenges the idea of Arctic exceptionalism as a
distinct security concept to some extent. While Arctic exceptionalism
emphasizes cooperation and environmental protection, great power
competition introduces elements of rivalry and resource-driven conflict.
This challenge [underscores the **complexity** of security dynamics in
the Arctic]{.underline}, [where both exceptional vulnerabilities and
geopolitical interests coexist]{.underline}. **[However]{.underline}**,
[Arctic exceptionalism can still play a **vital role** in mitigating the
negative consequences of great power competition by promoting
**responsible governance** and highlighting the **exceptional nature**
of Arctic challenges]{.underline}. It serves as a reminder that **[even
amid competition]{.underline}**, [the Arctic's unique vulnerabilities
must be addressed **collectively**]{.underline}.

In addition, an analysis of [Arctic exceptionalism as a distinct
security concept contributes to a **more nuanced understanding** of
security dynamics in the Arctic region and the global system by
acknowledging the **multifaceted nature** of security
challenges]{.underline}. It recognizes that [security is **not solely
about military threats** but also about **environmental**]{.underline},
**[human]{.underline}**, [and **cultural** vulnerabilities]{.underline}.
[This **nuanced understanding** helps policymakers and scholars address
security in a **comprehensive** manner]{.underline}, considering the
interconnectedness of global ecosystems and the shared responsibility to
protect them. Moreover, [it offers insights into how responsible
governance]{.underline}, [sustainable practices]{.underline}, [and
international cooperation can **effectively address** security
challenges]{.underline}, [not only in the **Arctic** but also in **other
regions** facing similar environmental and geopolitical
complexities]{.underline}. Therefore, Arctic exceptionalism serves as a
valuable framework for redefining security paradigms in a rapidly
changing world.

Also, in the analysis, [constructivism emerges as a **vital theoretical
framework** for comprehending the intricacies of Arctic security
dynamics]{.underline}. [It illuminates the power of **social
values**]{.underline}, **[norms]{.underline}**, [and **shared
assumptions** in shaping the behaviors and perceptions of states within
the Arctic region]{.underline}. [The inter-subjective knowledge and
shared interpretations among Arctic states **significantly influence**
their responses to environmental challenges]{.underline}, [driving
**cooperative efforts** and encouraging the pursuit of **common
interests** in environmental stewardship]{.underline}, [as exemplified
by the **AC**'s successes]{.underline}. Conversely, the lens of
[constructivism unveils the role of **shared interpretations** in great
power competition in the Arctic]{.underline}, [where states like
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates,
**[Russia]{.underline}**, [and **China** vie for untapped resources and
emerging economic opportunities]{.underline}. [Constructivism further
underscores the impact of shared knowledge and interpretations on
**global diplomacy**]{.underline}, as seen through the AC's
achievements, [and on **scientific cooperation**]{.underline},
contributing to global efforts to combat climate change. The evolving
identities and norms in the Arctic, influenced by practices and
interactions, highlight constructivism's capacity to elucidate the
changing landscape of Arctic security and cooperation. Ultimately,
[constructivism adds **depth** to the understanding of how shared
beliefs and identities **shape Arctic exceptionalism** and the responses
of states to the challenges posed by the melting Arctic]{.underline},
[offering **valuable insights** into the region's security dynamics and
implications for the broader global system]{.underline}.

### AT: Reps Don't Shape Reality

#### Yes they do. 

**Grassl, 22**---Master's Candidate, Development and International
Relations, Aalborg University (Theresa, "Disrupting 'Arctic
Exceptionalism'? A Qualitative Discourse Analysis of the Securitization
of Climate Change in the EU's Arctic Policy,"
<https://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/472820096/Theresa_Grassl_Master_Thesis_final.pdf>,
dml)

[The employment of the Arctic as a means to **advance**]{.underline} the
**[securitization]{.underline}** of climate change [on a **global
scale** points toward a **key aspect** in Arctic relations]{.underline}:
[The Arctic **is**]{.underline}, [what outsiders **make it to
be**]{.underline}. The Arctic as an area is comprised of parts of the
territory of eight different states, whose decision-makers reside
outside the Arctic. The concept of Arctic exceptionalism displays a
similar construction of the Arctic from the outside as the EU's climate
change discourse does and centers around the cooperative relationship
between the Arctic states in comparison with their relationship outside
the Arctic. Moreover, a key aspect of critiques of the concept of Arctic
exceptionalism is that it is a narrow view of inter-state security and
does not account for other kinds of threats that affect local people
directly. Instead, as already mentioned when conceptualizing Arctic
exceptionalism, it is a selective discourse about characteristics of the
Arctic that enable cooperation on the international level.

The EU employing an exceptionalisation of the Arctic as part of its
efforts for the securitization of climate change differs from the
concept of Arctic exceptionalism. Hence, [the construction of the Arctic
by outsiders depends on their **understanding** of the
Arctic]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, more importantly, [on whether a
certain depiction is **beneficial**]{.underline}. [For **Arctic
states**]{.underline}, [the **compartmentalization** of Arctic politics
and the depiction of the Arctic as **peaceful** is **essential** to
counter societal and environmental challenges]{.underline} and pursue
economic opportunities. [For the **EU**]{.underline}, [the depiction of
the Arctic as **severely affected** by climate change is
beneficial]{.underline}, as it serves to advance its aim for action
against climate change on a global scale.

[This shows how **differences** in the way that the Arctic is
**constructed** **affect inter-state relations** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [There are **direct discursive
effects**]{.underline}: firstly, in the case of the concept of Arctic
exceptionalism, the upkeep of desecuritized relations, secondly, in the
case of the EU's climate change discourse, the reinforcement of climate
change as a threat. Additionally, it serves to increase insecurity in
interstate relations. For the Arctic states, this takes place [on two
levels]{.underline}. [On the one hand]{.underline}, [through the
**construction** of a **potential threat**]{.underline}, [which is
**contingent** on them **accepting** the securitizing move]{.underline}.
[On the other hand]{.underline}, [the securitizing move is also aimed at
a **global audience**]{.underline} in the global sphere, where the
Arctic states have different amounts of influence. [Even if the
securitizing move is **rejected** on a global level]{.underline}, [the
transfer of the Arctic to the global level **increases
insecurity**]{.underline}.

### AT: Threats Real

#### Not responsive---we never said they weren't!

**Greaves, 16**---Ph.D. candidate, Department of Political Science,
University of Toronto (Wilfrid, "Constructing In/Security in the Arctic:
Polar Politics, Indigenous Peoples, and Environmental Change in Canada
and Norway,"
<https://utoronto.scholaris.ca/items/e0790f25-319a-401b-a8c2-3149989fbc22>,
dml)

In its aims, CS [securitization theory is **explicitly not concerned**
with identifying **real** or **objective** security
threats]{.underline}, [but rather the **discursive process** through
which security threats are established]{.underline}.188 Even conceding
the role of facilitating conditions, the CS remains "radically
constructivist"189 in that in/security is determined by the success of
particular securitizing moves in elevating an issue to the fore of the
audience's consciousness and the apex of political priority. [Whether or
not a material danger corresponding to a securitizing move exists is
**irrelevant** to the **construction** of security threats]{.underline},
[just as the normative or practical implications of **responding** to a
particular threat are **inconsequential** to its **validity** as a
successful securitization]{.underline}. To the CS,
"'**[security]{.underline}**' [is]{.underline} thus a
**[self-referential]{.underline}** practice, [because it is in this
practice that the issue becomes a security issue]{.underline} --
[**not** necessarily because a **real existential threat** exists but
because the issue is **presented** as such a threat]{.underline}."190
[Successful securitizations may represent **objectively dangerous**
material phenomena]{.underline}, [or have **little** or **no basis** in
materiality]{.underline}, with the latter emerging either from a
subjective perception of threat or from instrumental use of security
language.

The CS view of [security]{.underline} as self-referential means it [is
neither characterized by the **absence** of a threat]{.underline}, per
se, [nor understood as a **binary opposite** to insecurity]{.underline}.
Instead, "[insecurity is the situation when there is a threat and no
defence against it]{.underline}; [security is a situation with a threat
and a defence against it]{.underline}."191 [Security is **not**
constituted by the **absence** of threats]{.underline}, [but by the
**specification** of a **threat** and a suitable
**defence-response**]{.underline}. By contrast, the absence of threats
-- not their material absence, but lack of issues socially constructed
as such -- is a condition outside the realm of security the CS refers to
as "normal politics."192 As Wæver explains:

[When there is no security problem]{.underline}, [we do not
conceptualize our situation in terms of security]{.underline}; instead,
[security is simply]{.underline} an **[irrelevant]{.underline}**
concern. [The statement]{.underline}, then, [that]{.underline} security
is always relative, and [one never lives in **complete
security**]{.underline}, [has the additional meaning that]{.underline},
[if one has such complete security]{.underline}, [one **does not label**
it]{.underline} '**[security]{.underline}**.' It therefore never
appears. Consequently, [transcending a security problem by politicizing
it **cannot happen** through thematization in security
terms]{.underline}, [only **away** from such terms]{.underline}.193

The Copenhagen School envisions all possible social issues falling along
a spectrum ranging from depoliticized-politicized-securitized. Issues
can move from politicized to securitized, but also from security back
into the realm of normal politics through the reverse process of
desecuritization. Throughout their work, the CS is clear in their
preference for issues to be desecuritized rather than the opposite. For
them, "[security should be seen as **negative**]{.underline}, [as a
**failure** to deal with issues as normal politics]{.underline}.
Ideally, [politics should be able to unfold according to routine
procedures **without** this extraordinary elevation of
specific]{.underline} '**[threats]{.underline}**' [to a prepolitical
immediacy]{.underline}."194 While the CS acknowledges that
securitization may sometimes be necessary, they always consider it
regrettable because of the societal cost to the normal operation of
political institutions, protection of particular rights, and the rule of
law.

This preference for desecuritization is one of the central distinctions
between the Copenhagen School and other theoretical approaches to
security, including subsequent accounts of securitization. Both
[objectivist]{.underline} and critical security [theories tend to
emphasize **maximizing** the provision of security]{.underline}, whether
through the expansion of material power for sovereign states or the
pursuit of "positive security" for individuals and communities.195 Wæver
dismisses this position, arguing "[the trick was and is to move from a
**positive** to a **negative** meaning]{.underline} ... **[We want less
security!]{.underline}**"196 For the CS, rather than more security for
threatened referent objects, "[desecuritization itself]{.underline} --
[as the **absence** of a world framed in terms of security]{.underline}
-- [is the]{.underline} emancipatory **[ideal]{.underline}**."197 [Their
position exhibits an unqualified preference for the operation of normal
politics **lacking** the **emergency connotations**]{.underline} and
anti-democratic potential [of securitization]{.underline}. It also
suggests the radicalism of the CS position, especially in the early
post- Cold War context in which the theory was first articulated:
arguing for less security was, and remains, a bold and counter-intuitive
approach to ISS.

### AT: Ukraine Makes Competition/Militarization/Securitization Inevitable

#### This is [uniqueness]{.underline} for us. Ukraine conflict doesn't make desecuritized Arctic policy [impossible]{.underline}, but [does]{.underline} make it [more necessary]{.underline}.

**Heggelund, 23**---Master's candidate in International Affairs, School
of Social Sciences, University of Iceland (Ragna Mathiesen, "Thawing
Arctic Realities: Analyzing Arctic Security through the Lens of Arctic
Exceptionalism and Great Power Politics,"
<https://skemman.is/handle/1946/45722>, dml)

[The **Russia-Ukraine** conflict has further **strained** Arctic
cooperation and governance]{.underline}. [The conflict has led to the
**suspension** of Arctic cooperation platforms and the **interruption**
of projects]{.underline} within the AC (Schreiber, 2022). The resulting
pause in communication and collaboration has implications for addressing
regional issues, sustainable development, and the well-being of Arctic
communities.

Moreover, the Russia-Ukraine war has revealed vulnerabilities within the
Arctic region, particularly in the context of climate change and the
region's geopolitical and economic interests. [The conflict has
**further burdened** the already vulnerable Arctic system and its
inhabitants]{.underline}, [**emphasizing** the need for **responsible
governance** and **sustainable practices**]{.underline} (Almonte, 2023).
It has also highlighted Europe's dependence on Russian energy supplies
and the potential role of the Arctic in addressing energy transition
needs (ibid.). Furthermore, in discussions concerning the criticism of
Arctic exceptionalism, where the perception of the Arctic as a region
subject to the dynamics of the international order, [it is **essential**
to note that while external conflicts]{.underline}, [such as the
Ukraine-Russia conflict]{.underline}, [can]{.underline} indeed [have
**repercussions** in the Arctic]{.underline}, [the Arctic region tends
to maintain a **distinct identity** and is **seldom the direct
battleground** of conflicts]{.underline}. Instead, [it often presents as
**unique** and stays somewhat **separate** from the international
order]{.underline}.

### AT: Utilitarianism

#### Utilitarian calculations are [unethical]{.underline} and justify [existentially genocidal violence]{.underline}.

**Oliver, 23**---Department of Philosophy, Vanderbilt University (Kelly,
"The Limits and Dangers of Risk-Benefit Analysis: From the Refugee
Crisis to the Coronavirus Pandemic," *The Vulnerability of the Human
World: Well-being, Health, Technology and the Environment*, Chapter 2,
pp. 13--27, SpringerLink, dml)

In Carceral Humanitarianism (2017), I argue against
[[util]{.mark}itarian risk-benefit [calculations]{.mark}]{.underline} as
a principle of ethics. There, I argue that the utilitarian calculus used
by both humanitarian aid organizations and so-called humanitarian
military operations (with its surgical strikes and statistical
modelling) [**reduces** human life to **statistical calculations** of
risk or benefit]{.underline}---and **[not]{.underline}** just risk or
benefit [in the **absolute**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} rather risk
or benefit as defined by the organization or government doing the
calculations. Risks and benefits are [**always** defined with certain
goals in mind]{.underline}. [They [are **never**]{.mark} without
context]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} therefore [purely]{.underline}
"**[[objective]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [or **free** from]{.underline}
politics or **[bias]{.underline}**. Thus, any utilitarian calculus
assumes some good or goal beyond calculation such as pain or pleasure,
suffering or quality of life. [Even **survival**]{.underline}---life and
death---[are valued relative to particular goals that **defy** the
calculations of risk-benefit analysis]{.underline}. In other words,
employing risk-benefit and utilitarian calculations, requires making
assumptions about end goals and values that defy those very
calculations. It is not just that [there are **always** factors beyond
our control and variables we **do not know**]{.underline}, as the deadly
coronavirus makes painfully clear, but also that risk-benefit and
[[util]{.mark}itarian calculations [do not operate in a **vacuum**
but]{.mark} **[necessarily]{.mark}** make [assum]{.mark}ptions about
[the good]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In the West, risk-benefit analysis or [[util]{.mark}itarian calculative
reasoning]{.underline} has become the dominant mode of addressing social
issues, economic issues, and health issues. For example, Doctors without
Borders uses complex risk-benefit computer modeling to set policies
about where to send medical aid (Neuman, 2016).Footnote 9 And too many
hospitals dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic have had to resort to
triage medicine that uses risk-benefit analysis to distribute scarce
resources such as ICU beds, oxygen, and ventilators.

This type of calculative reasoning, however, [[treats]{.mark} human
[life as **fungible** and **exchangeable**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} thereby [makes acceptable]{.underline} so-called
[**collateral damage** and **death**]{.underline}. The way risk-benefit
analysis is used to calculate acceptable collateral damage in warfare is
a prime example of the costs of calculable reason, where utilitarian
arguments are used to justify acceptable levels of killing and death.
[The calculating machine at the heart of utilitarian risk-benefit
analysis is **dangerous** when it makes individual lives fungible and
exchangeable]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} approach [**does
not** and [**cannot** address the **singularity** of each living
being]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Both humanitarian aid and "humanitarian" warfare operate according to
logics of calculation. In fact, humanitarian warfare and humanitarian
aid operate in tandem. In a sense, nation states create refugees by
limiting citizenship, and then pay humanitarian aid organizations to
take care of them. National sovereignty and its concomitant notion of
citizenship are dependent upon so-called neutral humanitarian space,
which occupies an ambiguous space on the outskirts, and borders of, host
countries. Refugees are detained in camps and detention centers at the
borders in supposedly neutral humanitarian space free from politics and
war. Yet, this neutral humanitarian space, often guarded by state police
and military, is far from independent of state sovereignty.

To the contrary, humanitarian space is coopted to maintain national
sovereignty against the so-called threat of migrants, asylum seekers,
and refugees. In other words, within carceral humanitarianism, refugees
operate as both a threat to national sovereignty, and the justification
for shoring up borders.

The fact that the United States and the European Union pay other
countries to keep refugees from crossing into their borders makes clear
that the lives of these people can be bought and sold like so much cargo
to be held in port or lost at sea. For example, the recent crisis in
Belarus at the Polish border, where, according to migrants and refugees
are being used as political pawns. According to the New York Times:
"Europe has long paid other nations to keep refugees away from its
borders... This gives countries on the European periphery the leverage,
and incentive, to use those refugees as pawns" (see Fisher,
2021).Footnote 10

Policies that treat refugees as collateral damage or units of exchange,
where some lives are more valuable than others as calculated through
risk-benefit analysis, renders the lives of refugees fungible, and
therefore, ultimately, disposable.

Statistical models that compute [comparative valuations set out a
**hierarchy** of life]{.underline}, human and otherwise, [through which
violence is **justified**]{.underline}, [and some lives are
**valuable**]{.underline} (in this case, citizens), [while others are
**disposable**]{.underline} (in this case, refugees). Yet, [in **any**
risk-benefit or utilitarian calculation]{.underline}, [[there is
**always** a remainder that **cannot be
calculated**]{.underline}]{.mark}---not just in the arithmetic sense,
but also [a remainder beyond calculation and beyond
recognition]{.underline}.

[There is always [something we **don't know** that is]{.mark}
**necessarily [left out]{.mark}** of any calculation]{.underline}. [We
are **not masters** of the world and therefore there are always factors
**beyond** our knowledge and control]{.underline}. In addition, there
are elements beyond our comprehension. [It is **not**]{.underline},
then, [just a matter of **gathering all the relevant
data**]{.underline}, and that fact that we always fall short. [There are
elements that affect our calculations that we **aren't even aware
of**]{.underline}, [that we **can never know**]{.underline}. [There will
always be something **outside our comprehension affecting our
calculations**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [human
experience]{.underline}, and the experience of life itself, [**cannot be
reduced** to calculations or exchangeable units]{.underline}. [There is
always something about life that **transcends** even the most
sophisticated mathematical calculations]{.underline}. We might call this
the remainder left over when we attempt to translate ethics into
politics or the singular into the universal. There is always something
about the singularity of each living being that cannot be reduced to any
system of exchange value.

2.3 Justice Between Ethics and Politics

Justice requires continually renegotiating the relationship between
ethics and politics, singular and universal, precisely because there is
always something in excess, something beyond recognition.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} remainder [[is the **ethical imperative**
that]{.mark} should **keep us awake at night**]{.underline}. [[Rather
than]{.mark} lead to **inquietude** or **[apathy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the excess beyond our [recognition [keeps us]{.mark} **actively
[searching]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} better ways to approach
[justice]{.mark} **[without]{.mark}** resting on]{.underline} moral
rules or [[risk-benefit calculations]{.underline}]{.mark} or
self-righteous principles. [The remainder]{.underline} beyond
calculation, beyond recognition, [[demands that we]{.mark} continue to
**[question]{.mark}** our]{.underline} own principles and
**[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [that we continue to examine our
concepts of]{.underline} justice and **[fairness]{.underline}** and
equality.

An [ethical politics]{.underline} is one in which justice demands the
hyper-vigilance self-critical reflection on where any response---ethical
or political---necessarily falls short. It is an ongoing task that
[**cannot end** with risk-benefit analysis]{.underline}. [Despite the
**ethical insomnia** and **political vertigo** caused by this
interminable self-questioning]{.underline}, [we must
**act**]{.underline}---[even **leap**]{.underline}. Although ultimately
the gap between singularity and universality is impassible, [[the
impossibility of]{.mark} achieving [justice is **no excuse** for not
**attempting it every single day**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This tension between politics (which addresses itself to what can be
seen, and to the universal, what can be shared), and ethics (which
addressed itself to what cannot be seen, and to the singular, what
cannot be shared) is the knot at the center of justice.

[[Justice is **antithetical** to util]{.mark}itarian ethics insofar [as
individuals are **not fungible**]{.mark} **units** that can be
exchanged]{.underline}. [Utilitarianism relies on the **calculability**
of]{.underline} pain, suffering, **[survival]{.underline}**, [or the
quality of life]{.underline} itself. And the [utilitarian calculus
relies on determining **thresholds** that separate individuals into
groups]{.underline}, whether it is those who are members of the moral
community or the polis, and those who are not (for example animals), or
those [whose lives are **worth saving** and those whose lives are
**not**]{.underline}.

At some point, however, [this type of line-drawing **inevitably**
becomes either **political** or **arbitrary**]{.underline}. Take debates
over the basis for membership in the moral community. What are the
criteria for membership? Intelligence, language, reason, sentience, the
ability to suffer? And [whatever we decide should be the
criteria]{.underline}, [where do we **draw the line**?]{.underline} For
example, what counts as a language? Does the bees signal dance count?
Or, as some argue, is it merely a code and not a language? What counts
as intelligence? Peter Singer argues that great apes should be extended
rights or admitted to the moral community based on their intelligence,
which is greater than severely mentally disabled persons (see Singer,
1999; McMahan, 2009; Anstötz, 1993).Footnote 11 Some disability scholars
such as Eva Kittay have argued against this comparison, insisting that
human beings should be accorded special status regardless of their
mental abilities (Kittay, 1998a, b, 2009).Footnote 12 The controversy
over Singer's argument demonstrates how [utilitarian line-drawing is
always a **fraught endeavor** that ultimately rests on an **arbitrary
cut off point**]{.underline}.

For example, in Animal Liberation, Singer draws the line between calms
and shellfish, who supposedly cannot feel pain (Singer, 1990,
173--4).Footnote 13 But what if we learn that shellfish can feel pain?
In all these utilitarian endeavors, the liminal cases are unsettling
because they reveal the arbitrariness of borders and the inadequacy of
general classifications. This type of line-drawing or threshold not only
ignores the singularity of each individual, but also poses an arbitrary
or political dividing line as a natural border. The same is true of
national borders used to keep migrants out.

We see something similar in covid triage medicine where triage protocols
disadvantage whole classes of people. Old people, disabled people,
cancer survivors. The coronavirus lays bare the fantasy of calculable
criteria as an ethical way of life. Covid reveals gaping inequities in
the length and quality of life caused by social and economic
"pre-existing conditions." Celebrities and politicians from Madonna to
Andrew Cuomo called the coronavirus the "great equalizer." In March
2020, Cuomo tweeted "This virus is the great equalizer." In reality,
covid is the great unequalizer... Footnote 14

The pandemic forces doctors and nurses to make impossible decisions
about who is given the chance to live and who will die. But these
decisions exist in the context of pre-existing conditions of poverty,
racism, and unequal access to health care that skew any attempt at fair
or reasonable calculation. In a fair and just world, there would be
adequate resources available to everyone. Tragically, the real world is
not so fair or just. And [risk-benefit analysis and calculative
reasoning become the justification for **allowing some to
die**]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark} those [calculations]{.mark} pose as
**justice** or **fairness**]{.underline}, [and when they [allow us to
feel **certain**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even righteous, [[in our
**decisions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, then [[they risk a **slippery
slope**]{.mark} that leads us to a place [where **any** and **all life**
can become **disposable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The pandemic has made painfully clear the limitations of risk-benefit
analysis and calculative reasoning. Doctors and nurses report being
traumatized when forced to decide who will get life saving resources.
Face-to-face with patients, risk-benefit calculations are not as
straight forward as the mathematical or statistical modelling suggests.

A group of research physicians at the University of California,
describes the problem:

[Utilitarian approaches]{.underline} to ethical problems [often
**appear** to be **more practical** than many alternatives]{.underline}:
[we can **know** what the right course of action is by calculating
whichever choice will produce the **greatest good** for the **greatest
number**]{.underline}. Part of the appeal of utilitarian ethics is that
it seems like it should "work." [In the **real world**]{.underline},
however, [performing the relevant calculations can be **far from
easy**]{.underline}. This is especially true in crisis situations. [[It
may be **impossible** to collect]{.mark} the **[data]{.mark}**
needed]{.underline} as input for the calculations, it may be difficult
or impossible [to create the **decision rules**]{.underline} (predicting
prognosis or comparing outcomes) that constitute the calculations, [[the
calculator may be **impaired**]{.mark} by any number of different
factors]{.underline} (moral distress, fatigue, internal and external
pressures, etc.) [or **non-utilitarian moral constraints**]{.underline}
(such as superseding egalitarian policies, or even exponentially
increasing crisis severity) [can make utilitarian approaches
**infeasible**]{.underline}. (Fedyk et al., 2020)Footnote 15

2.4 The "Lessor of Evils"

[Rather than an ethical solution]{.underline}, [utilitarian risk-benefit
analysis]{.underline} in a triage medicine [is a]{.underline}
"**[lesser]{.underline}** of the **[evils]{.underline}**"
[approach]{.underline}. In fact, as I discovered doing research for
Carceral Humanitarianism, when discussing both humanitarian aid and
warfare, experts described risk-benefit and collateral damage
calculations as the "lessor of the evils" (Oliver, 2017). Some even see
these policies of assessing collateral damage as preventing the worst
evil by preventing massacre, genocide, and mass death. But as Hannah
Arendt reminds us, "[Those who choose the lesser evil **forget very
quickly** that they **still chose evil**]{.underline}" (Arendt, 2003,
30).Footnote 16

In Carceral Humanitarianism, I consider the question of "the worst"
violence. There, I argue that contemporary logics of proportionality
employed by both humanitarian aid organization and humanitarian military
operations are designed to mitigate and control violence and death to
avoid the worst violence and death, according to calculations of the
"lessor of evils." Thus, [we must ask what is [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
"most evil," or the [[**worst** evil]{.underline}.]{.mark} We may think
of genocide as the worst evil, and, in the West, "the worst" is often
shorthand for the "final solution" and the Holocaust. Since the end of
World War II, and the Cold War, "[the **worst**]{.underline}" [[has
become associated with]{.underline}]{.mark} the possibility of nuclear
war, even [the [destruction of the]{.mark} **entire
[planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[What if the worst is]{.mark} a result of [the **logic of calculation**
taken to the **extreme**]{.mark} at the expense of **all other
worldviews**?]{.underline} [What if the worst is [when this]{.mark}
calculable [way of thinking is used to justify
**massacre**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[genocide]{.underline}**, [and
**mass death**?]{.underline}]{.mark} [When lives become
**fungible**]{.underline} and exchange, then [we risk]{.underline} "[the
**worst**]{.underline}." Insofar as contemporary so-called
"humanitarian" warfare operates according to the logic of utilitarian
calculations of collateral damage that make some lives disposable, it
too risks "the worst."

[[The worst goes **beyond literal killing** and signals]{.mark} the
**[erasure]{.mark}**]{.underline} a way [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} seeing
the world---or we might as well say [[a **world
itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[by **covering it over** with another
worldview]{.underline}. In this regard, [comparative [models that
**reduce** life to]{.mark} units to be **exchanged** or **plugged into
[equations]{.mark}** [operate according to a **world-destroying
genocidal logic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is to say, when "the worst"
becomes part of the economy of "lessor of evils," life and death are
reduced to a logic of calculation that makes them fungible; one life is
weighed against another. Which is the lesser evil: One thousand four
hundred and twenty-two refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea in
2020 or the cost to citizens of the European Union of providing safe
passage to refugees? Which is the lesser evil: killing one civilian
infant or killing three soldiers in a surgical strike? Which is the
lessor evil: a 50-year-old diabetic and mother of two with covid dying
because she doesn't have access to a ventilator, or a widowed and
otherwise healthy 70-year-old man dying without access to a ventilator?
Etc. Etc.

What is an acceptable death? The death as collateral damage? [To be
**calculable**]{.underline}, [each life must be **reducible** to a
common denominator and **exchangeable**]{.underline}. [Each life becomes
a unit in an equation]{.underline}, a risk factor.

Yet, as the examples I just mentioned suggest, [these [decisions as
to]{.mark} which is **worse**]{.underline}---[or which is [the
**lesser**]{.mark} of the [evils]{.mark}]{.underline}---[are
**[always]{.mark}** made by **[privileg]{.mark}ing [one
context]{.mark}** over another]{.underline}. Citizenship over foreign
nations. Civilians over military. Diabetes over motherhood. [[How do we
**weigh** one life against another?]{.underline}]{.mark} [How do we
decide whose life is worth **more**?]{.underline} Whose life is worth
more and whose life is expendable as collateral damage? [[Which factors
are]{.mark} deemed **[relevant]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark}
which are **[not]{.mark}**?]{.underline} Which goals are deemed worthy,
and which are not? Ultimately, [[util]{.mark}itarian calculus **[cannot
give us the answers]{.mark}** to these questions]{.underline}.

### AT: "You-Link-You-Lose"=Bad

#### "You-link-you-lose" is a [circus caricature]{.underline} of our framework that [proves]{.underline} its necessity.

**Jacobsen, et al, 24**---Assistant Professor at the Royal Danish
Defence College's Centre for Arctic Security Studies (Marc, with Ole
Wæver and Ulrik Pram Gad, "Introduction: Analyzing Greenland in Arctic
Security," *Greenland in Arctic Security: (De)securitization Dynamics
under Climatic Thaw and Geopolitical Freeze*, Introduction, pp. 18-19,
ST=security theory, acronym expansion denoted by brackets, dml)

More important for our purpose, however, is that [the point of doing
analysis informed by a theory is **not** just to be able to **check a
box** by deciding that]{.underline} '**[yes]{.underline}**, [this
instance **lives up** to the criteria]{.underline} specified in the
theory, [so I **hereby declare it security**]{.underline}.' Rather, [the
point is to learn from **when** and **how** the empirical world **does
not quite match** the theory]{.underline}. In this view, "[a theory
is]{.underline} basically [a **model** that can be **held against
empirical instances** to assess structural similarity]{.underline}"
(Wæver 2011). [It is]{.underline}, of course, [**important** to know if
the]{.underline} melting of **[Arctic]{.underline}** ice [is
**securitized**]{.underline}. [It is **even more important** to know
**how** it is securitized]{.underline}, [both because it may inform our
**politics**]{.underline} in relation to climate change [and because it
may inform our **conception** of how who may be able to securitize
what]{.underline}. But [it is also important to know about **partially
successful** securitizations]{.underline}, **[surprising
misfires]{.underline}** (Åtland and Ven Bruusgaard 2009),
[and]{.underline} '**[weird]{.underline}**' [dynamics that resemble
those described as]{.underline} '**[standard]{.underline}**' by the
theory. When it comes to theory, [the **proof of the pudding** is not
just in the **eating**]{.underline}, [the proof]{.underline} of the
pudding [is also in the **making**]{.underline}. When asking ourselves
whether it makes sense taking ST on tour from its late 20thcentury
European point of departure, [the sense to be made comes not just from
deciding whether They do security as We do]{.underline}, [but also by
learning about how dynamics that resemble the core propositions of the
theory **come out differently** under circumstances]{.underline} further
and further removed from the theory's ideal type (in terms of sector,
geography, culture, age, etc.). Does ST tell us something about the
dynamics at hand, something new and unexpected that makes it possible
for actors to reorient their action? Or does ST's failure to capture a
case tell us something interesting about the core of the theory or about
the dynamics analyzed? Is it not the case [with a lot of
theories]{.underline} in both natural and social sciences that [we learn
by **applying** them and then **observing anomalies** that **could not
have been found** or **understood** had the theory just been **deemed
irrelevant**]{.underline}; [it is exactly the]{.underline}
'**[model]{.underline}**' [that allows one to see **what does not fit**
it]{.underline}. [This is why taking]{.underline} ST
\[[security]{.underline} theory\] [out of its]{.underline} '**[comfort
zone]{.underline}**' in European post--Cold War security [is
important]{.underline}. ST's ongoing world tour is important in telling
us both dynamics 'out there' that looks more or less like security, but
also in telling us about how Europe is more or less provincial and/or
how the world may or may not be in a process that will make ST obsolete.

**Silva, 24**---Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy,
University of Regina (Caroline Cordeiro Viana, "Securitization theory
and its empirical application: a literature review," Revista de
Sociologia e Política, Vol. 32, 2024, dml)

The theory explains the process by which a theme to enter a country\'s
security agenda and has become a reference point in international
[security studies]{.underline}. However, strong critiques [suggest the
existence of **challenges** in the **empirical operationalization** of
the theory]{.underline}. Therefore, the first research question guiding
this work was focused on these problems, assuming that the theory had
flaws. Nevertheless, after collecting and analyzing 260 articles, in a
process that will be described below, the research question was
redefined to identify the problems academic papers face in
operationalizing the theory: Why do [academic]{.underline}
paper[s]{.underline} in the field of international relations
[**struggle** to **empirically apply**]{.underline} the [securitization
theory]{.underline} of the Copenhagen School?

As mentioned above, the initial research path was based on the
hypothesis that securitization theory was flawed. With this in mind, we
selected, from among 260 articles that mentioned the term securitization
in their titles, abstracts, and keywords, 184 studies that specifically
addressed the empirical application of the securitization theory in
international relations. It was expected that the systematic analysis of
these articles would provide evidence of the points where there were
flaws in the empirical application of the theory, issues that would be
subject to criticism. However, the analysis of the studies revealed that
it was impossible to systematize theoretical flaws.

Therefore, the research changed focus, but not to claim that the theory
is perfect. It may have flaws in its empirical application. We do not
intend to suggest to the authors are exempt from responsibility for
failing when applying the theory or that there is no need for
theoretical updates and adaptations. Instead, [this]{.underline} work
[argues for the necessity of a **preliminary debate** **before**
asserting that the theory is **flawed**]{.underline}.

When reflecting on these initial questions, it is essential to resume
the concept of theory. Using the seminal work by Thomas Khun (2017),
every theory has two essential characteristics. First, its achievements
were unprecedented, to the point of attracting a lasting group of
supporters. Second, its accomplishments are open to contribute to
practitioners in the field, allowing them to address a wide range of
problems. Securitization theory undoubtedly embodies these two essential
characteristics, which lead us to the following concerns.

How rigorous is the application of the securitization theory in
international relations articles? How precise were the authors in
addressing securitization theory? Also, how much attention have
international relations analysts paid to methodology in their scientific
work? Finally, how can one assert that securitization theory is flawed
if it has not been applied as described by the scholars who developed
it?

This article was structured around these questions. Unfortunately, [many
studies that aim to demonstrate the existence of securitization
processes encounter **difficulties** with **empirical
verification**]{.underline}. These [issues relate to]{.underline} two
main aspects. The first is [the lack of precision in]{.underline}
adopting the concept of securitization and [carrying out the analysis as
determined by]{.underline} securitization theory. The second is [the
need for]{.underline} methodological rigour in studies published in
scientific journals.

Securitization Theory primarily involves hypothetical and counterfactual
arguments about future alternatives. The statements always include two
**[predictions]{.underline}**: [what will happen if securitizing action
are **not taken**]{.underline}, [and what will happen if they
**are**]{.underline}. Research on securitization is qualitative in
nature, involving the analysis of three stages: nonpoliticized,
politicized and securitized. In addition, [its development
requires]{.underline} (i) [identifying the **securitizing agent** and
the discourse they use to socially construct the threat]{.underline};
(ii) [analyzing the **capacity** of this discourse to **convince** a
**specific audience** of the risks of the threat]{.underline};
[and]{.underline} (iii) [studying the emergency **policies** and
**actions** that states adopt to confront the threat]{.underline}. In
other words, empirical evidence of securitization involves an analytical
roadmap that demands, from the researcher\'s perspective, a focus on
securitizing discourses and their ability to convince an audience of the
need to adopt emergency measures.

**Visoka, 19**---Associate Professor of Peace and Conflict Studies at
Dublin City University (Gëzim, "Critique and Alternativity in
International Relations," International Studies Review, Volume 21, Issue
4, December 2019, 678-704, dml)

Critical IR theory needs to make more space for self-reflexivity and to
open up to an epistemic transformation. The preceding discussion
demonstrated that although peace and conflict studies are more pluralist
than other [critical IR branches]{.underline}, they [are]{.underline}
still [affected by paradigmatic and disciplinary divides]{.underline}
within IR. [They operate in a conflictual theorizing logic that
**disregards** certain ontological, methodological, and epistemological
alternatives in order to **remain loyal** to one particular
disciplinarity]{.underline}. For Laura Sjoberg (2017, 163--67),
"disciplinarity has a narrowing effect," suggesting that "an
undisciplined IR would free space for more radical critique and more
radical experimentation." [[Disciplinary encampment]{.underline}]{.mark}
among different branches of critical IR [[has **suffocated** the search
for **achievable emancipatory possibilities**]{.mark} across a different
range of cases. Endorsing [alternativity requires]{.mark} a **fluid
onto-epistemology** that would make it possible to **bypass** the
epistemological entrapments caused by **rigid academic rules** of
thought and of knowledge production]{.underline} and by the academic
research process. Nonconflictual pathways of research would be
beneficial for overcoming paradigmatic contempt, bypassing
methodological holism and individualism, and [making space for
[**conciliatory heuristics** and **reality-congruent
inquires**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Archer 1995; Hamati-Ataya 2018).
Searching for nonconflictual critiques that are embedded in
postparadigmatic logic means generating conceptually novel and
reality-congruent knowledge about conflict-affected societies and the
broader politics of international interventions. This should not be seen
as an attempt to discipline the discipline of peacebuilding studies. On
the contrary, it would be an attempt to break away from disciplinary
entrenchments that have impeded a better understanding of complexity in
postconflict societies. It would also be an attempt to avoid the
normalization of entrenched research programs and open up the politics
of knowledge production on peace, conflict, security, justice, and
development.

More broadly, [alternativity in critical IR theory needs to be rescued
from **never-ending conceptual reifications**, which have ended up
making ontological assentation about the world become **completely
detached** from the world]{.underline}. In this regard, [there is a
growing realization]{.underline} in IR [that "[critique is]{.mark} a
[**necessary** but **secondary**]{.mark} task; [the priority is]{.mark}
to **return to [practical theory as quickly as
possible]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Levine 2012, 69). [Recalibrating the
purpose of alternativity in critical theory requires recalibrating
knowledge production, not only to **unmask** power relations and the
dynamics of dominance and to **create space** for a politics of
resistance but also to **generate practical knowledge** for political
action that challenges, confronts, and disrupts existing power relations
and **offers alternative solutions** for reshuffling social relations on
more emancipatory and inclusive terms]{.underline} (see Duvall and
Varadarajan 2003, 85; Murdie 2017; Deiana and McDonagh 2018). A feature
of critical peace and conflict studies is a congruence between the
emancipatory and problem-solving perspectives, which should be
predicated on the conciliation of knowledge, the expansion of
onto-politics of peace, and the pluralization of epistemological and
methodological approaches. The recent methodological work by J. Samuel
Barkin and Laura Sjoberg (2017) on interpretive quantification is a
promising move toward this much-needed pluralist fertilization within
critical theory. In particular, [a stronger linkage between criticality,
alternativity, and [practicality]{.mark} could]{.underline} help
critical security, peace, and conflict theories to [offer alternatives
that would **[maintain critical impetus]{.mark}** while **simultaneously
strengthening ties** to practical and societal problem-addressing
solutions]{.underline}. Genealogical [studies would blend well with a
critical analysis of conceptual and policy alternatives]{.underline}
(see Milliken 1999). Statistical analysis with an emancipatory
hypothesis coupled with critical analysis would contribute to subverting
policy practices and would normalize alternative knowledge about peace,
justice, and emancipation.

[The]{.underline} recent [practice-turn in IR offers new
bridges]{.underline} between scholars and practitioners, [making it
possible to translate critical knowledge into practice **without
compromising** the normativity and criticality of scholarly
works]{.underline} (see Bigo 2011). A forum on pragmatism published in
this journal has implicitly highlighted [the importance of
**alternativity**]{.underline} in understanding global politics and
generating impactful knowledge beyond the existing epistemological and
methodological divides (see Hellmann 2009). Friedrichs and Kratochwil
(2009, 701) have [argued for "the orientation of research toward the
**generation of useful knowledge**." Practicality is **essential** for
generating alternatives]{.underline}. For instance, Jonna Nyman (2016,
142) argues that "[a **pragmatic**, **practice-centred
approach**]{.underline} . . . [can help us gain practical knowledge of
how security works and understand the value of security better, as well
as help us to suggest alternative possibilities]{.underline}."
Similarly, Navnita Chadha Behera (2016, 154) argues: "[theorizing in IR
needs to step out of the rarefied atmosphere of its academe, develop a
healthy scepticism toward its canonical frames, and open up to the
possibilities of learning from everyday life]{.underline} and
experiences of people and their living traditions and practices."
Practicality shifts the focus from abstract criticality and normativity
to contextual critiques that account for everyday practices and
interactions. This would be essential for rescuing critique from
becoming a postempirical endeavor.

[Critical [knowledge that **engages with policy alternatives**]{.mark}
"is not only **pragmatic**, it [is also **politically enabling**: it
forces us **away from instrumental**]{.mark} **problem-solving
[perspectives]{.mark}** [towards a **wider framework**]{.mark} of
pragmatic thought where narrow instrumental goals are **overridden** by
wider normative and political concerns"]{.underline} (Kurki 2013, 260).
[Such grounded critiques are **crucial** in order to **expand
non-prescriptive alternativity** and **exploring practical
possibilities** for social emancipation and change]{.underline}. For
Steve Smith (2002: 202), "[[the **acid test** for the **success** of
alternative]{.mark} and critical [approaches is the **extent** to which
they have led to **empirically grounded work**]{.mark} that explores the
**range** and **variety** of world politics]{.underline}." This would
also be congruent with Daniel Levine\'s (2012, 30) concept of
[sustainable critique]{.underline}, which [entails [thinking in **both
practical** and **critical terms at once**]{.mark} so that "IR could
[create a **sustainably critical perspective**]{.mark} on global
politics [that might]{.mark} then [be **turned back onto**, and]{.mark}
**made to [inform]{.mark}**, **ongoing [policy
debates]{.mark}**]{.underline} and discourses." Behera (2016, 154)
further maintains that the "state-centric ontology of IR has effectively
ended up dehumanizing the discipline in a way so that normally it has
little to do with human relations, human needs, and the larger
imperatives of humanity." Generating practical alternatives would
therefore require endorsing situated knowledge as an epistemological and
methodological basis for any engagement with the real world. The work of
feminists such as Donna Haraway (1988, 584) on situated standpoints is
also relevant here because they offer "more adequate, sustained,
objective, transforming accounts of the world." Situated knowledge is,
mostly, nonrepresentational knowledge, in that it is not firmly mediated
through preexisting discourses. In this regard, promoting subjugated
knowledge discourses and practices could be central to rejuvenating the
emancipatory commitment of critical theory (see Doty 1996).

Situated alternatives could derive from emplaced and embodied knowledge
and could have a more emancipatory character as they "bring forth the
importance of recognizing, valuing, and employing marginalized voices by
working from this perspective, as well as by reshaping research to
include marginalized communities as part of knowledge production"
(McHugh 2015, 62). For Robson and McCartan (2016, 3), "[real world
[research]{.mark} looks to examine personal experience, social life and
social systems, as well as **related policies** and **initiatives**. It
[endeavours to **understand**]{.mark}]{.underline} the lived in reality
of people in society and its **[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Milja Kurki\'s (2013, 245) recent study of democracy promotion has
approached alternativity from the perspective of [policy
provocations]{.underline}, which [focus "on **not prioritising** one or
another perspective, but rather on encouraging
self-reflection]{.underline} by all practitioners, [which]{.underline}
in turn [is]{.underline} considered as [a key condition of seeking
adequately pluralism-fostering reforms [in **concrete policy
frameworks**]{.mark}."]{.underline} Kurki (2013, 248--51) further
maintains that "instead of relying on objective knowledge and criteria,
policy process can and should be attuned to the logic of interpretive,
politicised and participatory judgements." Her study is an excellent
example of [pragmatic]{.underline} congruence between criticality and
alternativity, whereby [policy alternatives are not geared toward
**totally improving** or **enhancing** the current system but openly
promote more pluralistic, reflexive, and emancipatory
policies]{.underline} for democratization and peacebuilding.

Moreover, for these new grounds of critical alternativity to be
introduced in practice, knowledge production should be decentered,
decolonized, and "de-methodolised" (see Lisle 2014). R. B. J. Walker
(2002, 265) has argued that "the key achievement of supposedly
alternative and critical literatures over the past two decades has been
to open up at least some possibility of asking questions about the
location and character of the political." As elaborated in this study,
knowledge production in peace and conflict studies is predominantly
based on Western epistemologies, which are shaped by specific cultures
of thought, self-perpetuated epistemological superiority, and codified
academic practices. Most of the international scholarship on
postconflict societies derives from an unrepresentative body of
knowledge, which tries to mediate, deviate, reinterpret, and,
consequently, construct a different social reality that is interpreted
through different measurements, reference points, and analytical
concepts (see Latour 2005). This has greatly limited the possibility for
proposing realizable alternatives. Due to these epistemological
anomalies, there are growing calls in scholarship to decolonize
knowledge from Eurocentric and Western dominance and instead to pursue
more pluralist and particularist modes of knowledge (Smith 2012). For
instance, Acharya and Buzan (2010, 2) have argued that IR theory should
be "an open domain into which it is not unreasonable to expect
non-Westerners to make a contribution at least proportional to the
degree that they are involved in its practice." Similarly, Andrew
Hurrell (2016, 151) has proposed that "the pathway to a global IR will
need to look beyond 'IR' and is likely to require new models for
organizing social science research and knowledge production."
Decolonized epistemologies of peace would reverse the order of
knowledge, placing the local first and then the regional and
international as spatial and ontological scales for understanding peace
processes (Visoka 2017). They would not operate in isolation but would
engage in shaping global IR knowledge. Therefore, a genuine search for
achievable alternatives should try to decolonize peace knowledge from
Western and Eurocentric frameworks, interrogate decolonized knowledge
and agencies, and explore the joint constitution of international
intervention and local resistance (see Smith 2012; Memmi 2006). Local
scholars often have rich knowledge, but the primary usage of it is not
for instrumental purposes or for transferring and sharing with audiences
of outsiders. Local knowledge is very much used to respond to narrow
practical and everyday interests and needs and, as such, is embedded in
the logic of generating sufficient knowledge to respond to specific
circumstances.

In the context of peacebuilding, as examined in this article, generating
alternatives from the ground up has the potential to bring about more
sustainable forms of peace and reconciliation for groups and societies
affected by violent conflict. Situated alternatives for emancipatory
peace are more prone to avoiding co-optation by positivist and
problem-solving epistemic predators, resulting thus in developing
pluriversal political and peace orders beyond liberal peacebuilding and
other Eurocentric impositions. From this situated perspective,
emancipation could take the shape of "the transformation of structures
and relationships of vulnerability through localized political action,
aimed at the creation of spaces in people\'s lives so that they are
enabled to make decisions and act beyond mere survival" (Basu and Nunes
2013, 69). [[Emancipatory alternatives **would not be
universal**]{.mark} in their applications because [such an attempt is
**not viable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rather [[the focus should
be]{.mark} on searching for **[practical]{.mark} emancipatory
[possibilities]{.mark}** [within a **given
context**]{.mark}]{.underline}, time, space, and place (see Fierke 2007,
24). In other words, [critiques with an adequate dose of alternativity
are more likely to generate **globally understandable** and **locally
impactful knowledge**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [alternativity does
not necessarily have to be predicated on]{.underline} representative
[**views** of the world---it can also be a by-product of
performing]{.underline} hope and [**imagined possibilities** in global
politics]{.underline}. Shapiro (2013, xiv) argues that critical thinking
helps to "create the conditions of possibility for imaging alternative
worlds." That said, as the purpose of critical theory is emancipatory
change, any alternative theoretical and empirical observation in service
of improving the human conditions should generate a morally and
practically acceptable standpoint. Because any attempt to establish an
alternative interpretation inevitably "empowers a particular social and
political standpoint" (Price and Reus-Smit 1998, 261). According to Ní
Mhurchú and Shindo (2016, 5), "critique can help us to develop different
ways of talking about, evaluating, doing and interrogating the changing
nature of politics, relations and experiences of the international in a
globalising world." Hence, critique is inevitably implicated in
world-making and, with a much clearer understanding of alternativity,
can steer the thrust for world-changing in a more emancipatory, just,
and inclusive direction.

Conclusion

[Emancipation is a central feature of critical IR debates, but scholars
often **fail to develop alternatives** or **solutions** achieving
emancipation in practice]{.underline}. This article has examined the
relationship between criticality and alternativity in IR in order to
shed light on some of the most contested issues of critical theory,
namely, the epistemological pathways for identifying the inconsistencies
and flaws in existing knowledge and practices and the extent to which
critical knowledge should generate alternative emancipatory
possibilities. The article has argued that alternativity provides an
opportunity for critical scholars to remain relevant without being
affiliated with positivist logics of inquiry. In unpacking the
conceptual contours, the article first explored how different branches
of critical IR engage with the episteme of alternativity. The analysis
found that although alternativity is often affiliated with
problem-solving epistemologies, it has played a major role in shaping
critical knowledge in IR. While this is acknowledged and endorsed at the
epistemological level by a branch of critical scholars who engage in
normative and reconstructive modes of critique, other scholars embedded
in deconstructive modes of critique have disregarded the merits of
alternativity in IR. The article has argued that, [**contrary** to what
is often assumed, [alternativity is **not incompatible**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} deconstructive or reconstructive
[[critiques]{.mark} across different subdisciplines of IR. [Yet
critical]{.mark} IR [debates]{.mark}]{.underline}, which have now become
the new mainstream in IR, [have **failed to engage** with the episteme
of alternativity in a more empirical and practical sense. They [preach
emancipation but **fail to develop tangible**]{.mark} **emancipatory
[alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As a result, there is a growing realization that, [without tangible
alternativity]{.underline}, [critical [theory risks **losing
its**]{.mark} **normative impetus** and its **[ethical]{.mark}** and
**emancipatory [commitment]{.mark}**, potentially becoming a
post-epistemological vocation **without politics**]{.underline}.
[Critical [knowledge]{.mark} without a dose of alternativity [may
**examine the causes**]{.mark} and **consequences** of subject matters
[but]{.mark} could [**fall short** of reaching out to the]{.mark} wider
[policy community]{.mark} and the affected subjects where power
relations reside]{.underline}, thus [[**missing the opportunity** to
transform the]{.underline}]{.mark} structural, discursive, and
performative [[practices that reproduce violence]{.mark}, inequality,
and injustice]{.underline} on human and nonhuman ecology. To bridge this
epistemological gap, the analysis in the second part of this article
examined how alternativity features in peace and conflict studies, a
disciplinary field known for adding normative, empirical, and practical
substance to critical IR debates. The analysis offered a conceptual
scoping of three modes of critique and alternativity in peace and
conflict studies. The three modes of critique showed that [a conjunction
between criticality and alternativity is possible]{.underline} and that
it is necessary to renew the practical and emancipatory potential of
critical theory in IR. The three modes of alternativity in peace and
conflict studies expose a spectrum of different critiques, ranging from
those perspectives that disengage completely from conceptual and
empirical alternatives, to more pragmatic and prescriptive approaches.

[Critique-without-alternative]{.underline} represents one strand, which
[tends to **avoid** offering normative and practical alternatives to
their critical reflections aimed at maintaining the conservative and
radical impetus of critical theory and **dissociating** from
problem-solving and policy-relevant methods of inquiry. This mode of
critique]{.underline} is committed to revealing the weaknesses of
peacebuilding interventions but [**refuses** to offer any emancipatory
and practical alternative]{.underline} on how to build sustainable peace
after violent conflict. If the end goal of critical perspectives is
achieving emancipation, then [[critique should **not only** be]{.mark}
directed toward [problematizing dominant]{.mark} discourses, practices,
and [policies but also needs to **envisage**]{.mark} **political** and
**[practical alternatives]{.mark}** rooted in ideational and material
elements]{.underline}. In turn, [[the lack of an explicit]{.mark}
emancipatory [agenda **limits their**]{.mark} **social** and **political
[impact]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **unintentionally [validates]{.mark}**
[the existing order]{.mark}]{.underline}. In response to this challenge,
a new mode of critique has emerged, namely,
[critique-as-alternative]{.underline}, which exemplifies the optimal
approach. Proponents of critique-as-alternative have remained committee
to critical analysis, but most importantly, they [have taken up the
challenge of]{.underline} offering emancipatory knowledge that has
[practical relevance]{.underline} for vulnerable societies in global
politics. [Their main flaw]{.underline}, however, [has been their
**inability to elaborate sufficiently** their practical and emancipatory
alternatives]{.underline}---a flaw that has opened up space for
epistemic contestation and policy co-optation. Finally, the third mode
of critique---critique-with-alternative---which is embedded in a
positivist, problem-solving, and policy-driven logic of inquiry, offers
alternatives that seek either to verify existing knowledge and the
existing interventionary order or to reject other critical alternatives.

Looking at different modes of critique through the lens of alternativity
in IR\'s subdiscipline of peace and conflict studies has provided
interesting insights on the promise and limits of critical IR in shaping
global politics. The analysis found that existing modes of critique have
failed to develop elaborative emancipatory alternatives at both the
conceptual and the practical levels. To infuse critique-with-alternative
with emancipatory elements, expand the epistemological scope of
critique-without-alternative, and operationalize further the practical
solutions offered by this mode of critique, substantial changes are
needed. This article has suggested exploring postparadigmatic approaches
of inquiry in order to avoid existing epistemological entrapments and
limitations, reclaiming the practical relevance of critical theory
through pragmatic, reflexive, and situated alternatives---across the
conceptual, normative, and empirical spectrums---and promoting
decolonized, bottom-up methods of knowledge production. The existing
modes of critique require pursuing more nonconflictual and
postparadigmatic epistemologies, embracing situated knowledge and
reclaiming and expanding its practical relevance, breaking away from
geo-epistemological hierarchies, and opening up to post-Western IR. To
conclude, [promoting [alternativity has the potential to **rejuvenate
critical scholarship**]{.mark} embedded in the ethos of impactful
engagement with the world [**without being co-opted** by the policy
world. The]{.mark}]{.underline} next [[challenge]{.mark} for scholars
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} not [[be]{.underline}]{.mark} whether
alternativity and criticality are congruent but
[[how]{.underline}]{.mark} emancipatory [[alternatives]{.mark}
can]{.underline} renew the social and political purpose of critical
theory and [**[make an impact]{.mark}** in the real world]{.underline}.

### Consequentialism---2AC

#### Consequentialism's the only way to make ethical decisions in [non-ideal]{.underline} situations---any alternative theory assumes [ideal]{.underline} conditions, which [obscures]{.underline} unjust results.

**Schmidt, 24**---Faculty of Philosophy, University of Groningen
(Andreas, "Consequentialism and the ideal theory debate in political
philosophy," Journal of Social Philosophy, August 7, 2024, DOI:
10.1111/josp.12586, language modifications denoted by brackets, dml)

Third, it is common to distinguish between "objective" and "subjective"
versions of consequentialism. Objective versions focus on
"fact-relative" consequences and rank options by the consequences they
will actually have. Subjective [[consequentialism]{.underline}]{.mark},
in contrast, [[assesses options based on]{.mark} how much good they do
in **[expectation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Subjective consequentialism
comes in at least two varieties: belief-relative versions focus on the
expectations constituted by an agent\'s actual beliefs, whereas
[evidence-relative versions focus on the expectations it is rational to
have [given the **evidence available**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I here
assume a subjective and evidence-relative version, for two reasons.

First, there are good (prima facie) arguments for it. For example, an
evidence-relative version is more action-guiding than a fact-relative
one. [When we enquire]{.underline}, ex ante, [which **policy option** to
choose]{.underline}, [evidence-relative consequentialism is **more
likely** to give us an answer]{.underline}, [given that we **do not
know** how facts will turn out]{.underline}.5 It also answers more
pertinent questions than a belief-relative version. Imagine a
consequentialist president withholding the COVID-19 vaccine, falsely
believing that its medical risks outweigh its benefits. Applied
political philosophers are probably more concerned with finding the
correct evidence-relative judgment ("making the vaccine available is
more choiceworthy") than with what the president ought to do given his
false beliefs. Finally, [belief-relative versions **struggle** with
collective]{.underline}, [corporate]{.underline}, [and multiple
agents]{.underline}: [whose beliefs should be **pivotal**?]{.underline}
And [how]{.underline}, if at all, [should we **aggregate** different
people\'s empirical beliefs?]{.underline}

Second, I here assume an evidence-relative version to make my task
manageable. But note that variations of my arguments likely still work
for fact-relative and belief-relative versions (although how is beyond
my scope). 6

Finally, I stipulated that [consequentialist]{.underline} political
[philosophy is about ranking]{.underline} practice-constituted
[options]{.underline}. [Such [options can include]{.mark}]{.underline}
(i) [specific public **[policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g.,
vaccination policies or tax reforms); (ii) largely [informal **[social
practices]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., informal gender norms, norms
around inclusive language); [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (iii)
[fundamental and broad **[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as
questions like: What is distributive justice? What is democracy? Should
we have direct or representative forms of democracy?7

Clearly, there is great consequentialist value in having social
practices and institutions, as many of them make the world much better
than it otherwise would be. Practices typically also come with immanent
or practice-internal normativity.8 For example, the rule of law,
democracy, and football matches include internal norms and normative
expectations about how participants should behave. This, in part,
constitutes what those social practices are.

Consequentialist political philosophy, as I argue elsewhere, should
focus on the normativity internal to the social practices that bring
about a lot of good (Schmidt, 2023a). [While a consequentialist might
**ultimately** only care about bringing about **good
outcomes**]{.underline}, she \[[they]{.underline}\] [must still set
**great store** by the]{.underline} institutional [**principles**
required to sustain valuable practices]{.underline} and institutions.
For example, [assume a given consequentialist believes that legal
justice and the rule of law are **not intrinsically
valuable**]{.underline}. But she \[[they]{.underline}\] [will still
recognize that those practices are **extremely valuable** in bringing
about good outcomes]{.underline}. Accordingly, she will endorse the
norms [and]{.underline} institutional principles necessary for legal
justice and the rule of law. So, a consequentialist political
philosopher can then write about those norms and institutional
principles because she would [regard them as **necessary** or at least
**helpful** in sustaining social practices that do good]{.underline}.

Note that [[I **do not assume** any particular theory of the
good]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, total
[**[util]{.mark}itarianism** [would be **one**]{.mark} **way** to fill
in the view]{.underline}. [[But my definition allows for a **much
broader range**]{.mark} of views]{.underline}, [[including]{.mark}
theories with a **wider theory** of wellbeing or with non-welfarist
axiologies]{.underline} that contain other personal goods (such as
knowledge, freedom, and achievement) [or]{.underline} impersonal
[values]{.underline} (like biodiversity). [It also allows for
[**non-utilitarian** ways to aggregate]{.mark} personal
[goodness]{.mark} into overall goodness]{.underline}, such as
prioritarianism.

Finally, I earlier mentioned that my arguments matter for theories that,
while not fully consequentialist, at least accept:

Instrumentalism: Of any two (partly) practice-constituted options
available to a set of agents A, A has weighty pro tanto moral reason to
choose the option that, in expectation, does more impartial good. 9

Here, [[instrumental reasons **weigh heavily** but can be
**overridden**]{.mark} by non-instrumental concerns]{.underline}.
Henceforth, I only write about consequentialism, but the arguments also
apply, mutatis mutandis, to instrumentalism: an evidence-relative and
comparative version of instrumentalism can avoid many of the worries
that have been raised about both ideal and non-ideal theories.

I now introduce the debate and show how consequentialism has a plausible
take on the central arguments in it.

3 \| ARGUMENTS AGAINST IDEAL THEORY

The ideal versus non-ideal distinction is complex, as several debates
run concurrently (Stemplowska & Hamlin, 2012; Valentini, 2012). Here is
a first approximation: when we ask "how ideal" our theorizing should be,
we ask how far such [[theorizing should be **empirically
constrained**]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is, constrained [[by
**facts**]{.mark} about the actual or nearby possible
worlds]{.underline}. However, two distinct senses of "ideal theory" are
sometimes run together.

First, in the limiting case, ideal theories enquire what a "perfect" or
at least perfectly just society would look like. The institutional
principles (or rules of regulation) that regulate such a society are
then the correct and core normative principles. Call this ideal theory
as utopianism. 10 Anti-utopian theories, in contrast, do not bother with
what is ideal but assess which feasible options are better or worse (or
less unjust).

Second, "**[ideal theory]{.underline}**" [can]{.underline} also [mean
that theorists make **unrealistic assumptions** so they can build a
normative model]{.underline}. [Such models might require
**simplification**]{.underline}, **[idealization]{.underline}**, [and
**abstraction**]{.underline}. Call this ideal theory as model
remoteness. For example, David Gauthier argues, roughly, that some
normative principles are justified because agents who act like rational
choice agents (or "constrained maximizers" in Gauthier\'s case) and have
non-tuistic preferences would agree to follow such principles (Gauthier,
1986). To construct his case, Gauthier works with a simplified and
abstract model of rational agency and social interaction. Or consider
Rawls. In A Theory of Justice, Rawls seeks to formulate principles of
justice for the basic structure of society. For this, he devises a model
[with many **unrealistic assumptions**]{.underline}. For example, he
assumes countries are fully closed and that all people are able-bodied,
in good health, and compliant with all laws (Rawls, 1971). 11

Now, utopianism and model remoteness are often related: some theorists
use models remote from our actual world to formulate institutional
principles that would result in ideal societies, or at least in
societies far better than those in nearby possible worlds. But
utopianism and model remoteness can come apart. For example, if you
adopt a picture like Gauthier and develop principles based on
self-regarding individual rational behavior, you might not end up with
anything close to an "ideal society." Gauthier would agree that a
hypothetical society of altruistic angels would be better. Similarly,
while Rawls assumes people have the two moral powers, he also assumes
their altruism is limited. For example, the "strains of commitment" that
participants would be willing to take on constrain which principles of
justice we can choose. 12 So, while Rawls idealizes in the model
remoteness sense, such idealization is not meant to support a
far-fetched utopian ideal.

3.1 \| The arguments

Before surveying arguments against ideal theory, let me add two
comments.

First, some such arguments contend that a given methodology results in
theoretical shortcomings. Other arguments are more practical and contend
that a given methodology makes theories insufficiently action-guiding.
Often enough, however, theoretical and practical concerns relate. In
normative political philosophy, [we]{.underline} typically [expect
theories to provide both]{.underline} (some) **[practical
guidance]{.underline}** (telling us what to do) [and a **theoretical
justification**]{.underline} (why we should do it). Even for more
applied questions, theorists are interested not only in "picking the
right option" but also in providing justificatory reasons for it. For
example, imagine a black-box AI system that would reliably tell us which
option is most choiceworthy but would never reveal justificatory reasons
for it. While useful, such an AI system would not count as a normative
theory.

Second, because theories can be ideal or non-ideal in different ways and
to different degrees, methodological challenges are really about
theories that are either too ideal or that idealize in problematic ways
(Stemplowska & Hamlin, 2012).

The first challenge affects utopianism:

Unnecessary: utopianism is unnecessary. When choosing between feasible
options in institutional design, we can sometimes say which one is
better without knowing what the ideal society would look like (Sen,
2006, 2009, chap. 4).13 I don\'t need to taste the perfect dish to know
that apple strudel tastes better than gruel. Similarly, [[we do not need
a theory of the **best** to judge what is
**better**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The next two objections apply both to utopianism and model remoteness.

Unhelpful: [[sometimes moving from]{.mark} ideal [theory to comparative
judgements about real-world options **does not
work**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[because]{.mark} the theory\'s [ideal
principles]{.mark} provide **little guidance** in cases **too
different** from the ideal model]{.underline}.

Some ideal theories start with formulating institutional principles (or
"rules of regulation") for a society in idealized or remote conditions.
[To]{.underline} then [**judge** between real-life options]{.underline},
[such views must judge which non-ideal option better **approximates**
the ideal]{.underline}. However, [that\'s when]{.underline}---according
to critics---ideal theories run into trouble. Distinguish two versions
of Unhelpful: theoretical and epistemic.

Theoretically Unhelpful: [some]{.underline} ideal [theories
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} sometimes [[**structurally unable** to provide
**comparative judgements**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [When non-ideal
phenomena]{.underline}, like criminal justice, [are **outside** a
theory\'s core]{.underline}, an ideal [theory might not contain a
**path** from the ideal towards a non-ideal approximation procedure to
assess options]{.underline} from a feasible set (see (Valentini, 2009)
for a discussion).

[This]{.underline} problem [gets **compounded** [when real-life
situations are]{.mark}]{.underline}
"**[[non-ideal]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [in several
dimensions]{.underline}. For example, Rawls\' theory might simply
contain no answer on how we can approximate Rawlsian principles in a
country marked by various "non-ideal" conditions [at once]{.underline},
[such as sovereignty conflicts]{.underline}, [systematic gender
inequality]{.underline}, [widespread health problems]{.underline},
[significant immigration]{.underline}, [speciesist
exploitation]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} widespread
noncompliance]{.underline}. Relatedly, [in real situations]{.underline},
ideal [theories often **fail to guide us** [when confronted with
**trade-offs**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Farrelly, 2007; Goodin, 1995a; Sen,
2009, 98--101; Wiens, 2020).

A second version of Unhelpful is epistemic and focuses mostly on
utopianism:

Epistemically Unhelpful: [social reality is both **complex** and
**unjust**]{.underline}. [We cannot rationally judge which of two
options is more inclined to bring us closer to the **ideally
just**]{.underline} long-term institutional [arrangement]{.underline},
[as social reality is just **too complex**]{.underline}. [The ideally
just outcome is **mostly unhelpful** as a guide for social
reform]{.underline} (Barrett, 2020).

Epistemically Unhelpful could allow that ideal theories contain within
them a theory for comparative judgments---based on the options\'
propensity to bring us closer to the ideal institutional
arrangements---but that epistemic complexity makes such judgments
practically unviable.

A slightly different objection holds that [sometimes ideal theory is
**actively counterproductive**]{.underline}.

Bad Rankings: [[the **best** can be the enemy of the
**good**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [ideal theorising might risk giving us
**bad rankings** when choosing among feasible options]{.underline}.

A common dictum, often expounded by an uncle during the holidays, is
that communism is a good idea in theory but does not work in practice.
However, [[trying to approximate]{.underline}]{.mark} communism---or
[[whatever is **ideal**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[in the real world might
make things **worse** rather than **better**]{.underline}]{.mark}. One
much-discussed problem is the "failure of approximation": [by using the
criteria for the **best** outcome to approximate a **good** outcome in
the real world]{.underline}, [we end up with a **worse**
outcome]{.underline} (Stemplowska, 2016; Wiens, 2015, 2020).

A related but slightly different objection, primarily applying to model
remoteness, is as follows:

Blind Spots: [[**abstracting away** empirical
facts]{.underline}]{.mark}, ideal [theories often **assume away**
normatively important issues from their theories]{.underline}. Thereby,
[they arrive at principles that **fail to fully account** for important
real-world issues]{.underline}.

Blind Spots raises an issue for model remoteness in three ways.
First---and related to Theoretically Unhelpful---[treating]{.underline}
"**[non-ideal]{.underline}**" [issues as]{.underline} being [**outside**
its core]{.underline}, ideal [theory might **fail to guide us** on how
to approach such issues in the real world]{.underline}. Second, which
issues to exclude in ideal settings is itself a normative question.
Ideal theorists might argue that all scientists must abstract and
idealize when building a model. However, in normative theory, excluding
certain real-world issues from a theory\'s core is rarely normatively
neutral. For example, excluding bad health, structural gender
inequality, or the domination of non-human animals from our theory\'s
core and treating those as peripheral issues requires a normative
justification. Finally, excluding such issues from the core model might
simply give us the wrong institutional principles. [If normative
principles fail to capture important real-world
problems]{.underline}---[or treat those as
peripheral]{.underline}---[are they the right principles?]{.underline}

Some critics make Blind Spot through worries around ideology:

Ideological Capture: [by including **blind spots** in their normative
theorising]{.underline}, [ideal theories [can]{.mark}]{.underline}
produce principles that [**[hide]{.mark}** rather than **draw**
attention to [real-world]{.mark} problematic power
relationships]{.underline}, [[injustices]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} so on. Thereby, ideal theory [can help
[**reproduce** status quo problems]{.mark} and privileges]{.underline}
(See (Mills, 2005) for example). 14

3.2 \| Consequentialist answers

I now argue that [consequentialism has **good answers** to all the above
challenges]{.underline}. 15 Several features of consequentialism, as
described in Section 2, allow it to meet the challenges posed to
(overly) ideal theory. I first describe two such features and then
address those challenges one by one.

3.2.1 \| Two features

First, [[consequentialism is]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[non-ideal]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [about normative]{.underline}
institutional [principles]{.underline}. In Section 2, I argued that
[consequentialist]{.underline} political [philosophy
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} primarily [[about]{.underline}]{.mark}
practices and institutions that bring about **[[good
outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Institutional principles tend to come
in when one wants to characterize the practice-internal normativity of
such practices. And what practice-internal normativity such practices
will have---say the practice of democracy---is in large part
[[determined by **empirical considerations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. So,
institutional [principles are thus [not]{.mark}]{.underline} "[**[ideal
a priori]{.mark}** principles]{.underline}" [[but]{.mark} are always
connected to]{.underline}, [and [contingent on]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**empirical [evidence]{.mark}** [about the
**effects**]{.mark}]{.underline} and practice-internal normativity [of
real-world practices]{.underline}.

Second, [[consequentialism is]{.mark} essentially
**[comparative]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Rather than starting out by
enquiring which]{.mark} institutions [are **fully**]{.mark} **just** or
**unjust**]{.underline}, [or [**good** or **bad**]{.mark}
simpliciter]{.underline}, [consequentialism [tells us which]{.mark} ones
[are]{.mark} **more [choice-worthy]{.mark}** than others]{.underline}.
16

Now, compare consequentialism with views in political philosophy, such
as Rawls or Gauthier, that rely on model remoteness. As mentioned
earlier, such views derive normative principles through an abstract and
idealized model. Call such theories privileging theories, because they
privilege a particular model relative to which they formulate their core
principles. For example, Gauthier develops a model of interactions
between rational agents. When we assess real-world institutions, we
assess them against the principles developed in this privileged model.
Or consider Nozick. Nozick posits principles for the just acquisition
and transfer of property. Imagining a hypothetical scenario of an
original acquisition along with principles for just transfer and
compensation, we can then assess real-life property distributions
against this privileged hypothetical model. Finally, Rawls has a
privileged model of society as a system of fair cooperation between free
and equal persons. The hypothetical contract behind the veil of
ignorance between able-bodied persons within a closed country is a
vehicle for articulating institutional principles for this privileged
model.

Consequentialism, in contrast, does not have a privileged model. The
standards consequentialism uses to assess outcomes and options do not
require such an idealized model.

The above two features help consequentialism meet the objections raised
to ideal theory. Start with Blind Spots.

3.2.2 \| Blind Spots

Blind Spots was the charge that by formulating institutional principles
relative to an idealized and remote model, ideal theories structurally
fail to give sufficient importance to important real-world issues. Given
its two features outlined above, consequentialism avoids this challenge.

First, [being non-ideal]{.underline} about institutional principles
[forces [consequentialism]{.mark} to [focus on]{.mark} **expected
effects**]{.underline}. And when estimating expected effects, [we must
consider **[all]{.mark}**]{.underline} axiologically [[relevant
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is, all factors [[that
influence]{.mark} the [expected value]{.mark} of an option]{.underline}.
And [such effects will include]{.underline}
"**[non-ideal]{.underline}**" [factors like structural gender
inequality]{.underline}, [disability]{.underline}, ill health, [partial
compliance]{.underline}, [disagreement about justice and the
good]{.underline}, [human irrationality]{.underline},
[migration]{.underline}, [speciesist exploitation]{.underline}, [and so
on]{.underline}. Accordingly, we cannot rank institutional set-ups by
ignoring such factors, because [they all influence how **likely** and
**good** different outcomes will be]{.underline}. [[Non-ideal factors do
not come in **after**]{.mark} the theorizing is done]{.underline},
[[they are **built into the theorizing itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Second, privileging theories have a remote model of society relative to
which they formulate their core institutional principles, which are then
used as standards to assess options. **[Inevitably]{.underline}**, [a
remote model must **idealize** and **abstract away** from important
real-life normative concerns]{.underline}, [which means core principles
will always either **entirely neglect** those concerns or treat them as
**peripheral**]{.underline}. [Consequentialism]{.underline}, in
contrast, does not formulate any core institutional principles relative
to a privileged remote model---it [is essentially
**comparative**]{.underline}. [Because it does not require a remote
model for its evaluative standards]{.underline},
[consequentialism]{.underline} also [**avoids** neglecting important
real-world issues]{.underline}.

### Link Turn---Diplomacy---2AC

#### Cooperative Arctic governance [alters]{.underline} state-centric security paradigms.

**Heininen, 16**---Professor, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of
Lapland (Lassi, "High Arctic Stability as an Asset for Storms of
International Politics -- an Introduction," *Future Security of the
Global Arctic: State Policy, Economic Security and Climate*, Chapter 1,
7-8, SpringerLink, dml) \[corrected "definite" to "define," change
denoted by brackets\]

The broader and more dark picture of the current state of the world
gives one more reason to value the high stability of the Arctic region,
that [[the Arctic is **not isolated**]{.mark} but]{.underline} keenly a
part of the globe and is heavily impacted by globalization and its
multifunctional effects; furthermore, that the globalized Arctic
[has]{.underline} its [**global implications** and [**drivers**]{.mark}
that [affect]{.mark} both the **region** and the **rest of [the
globe]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as it is described in the GlobalArctic
project (www.globalarctic.org). [Recent]{.underline} industrial
[developments, such as **aggressively expanding
exploitation**]{.underline} of minerals and (off-shore) hydrocarbon
resources [due to **increasing resource demand**]{.underline}, on the
one hand, [bring **new** and **more dangerous environmental** and
**societal risks** to the Arctic]{.underline} and its people(s) -- they
have already created the 'Arctic Paradox' -- [and]{.underline} on the
other hand, [have **feedbacks** related to global energy and natural
resource systems]{.underline}. From this we can conclude that on the
other hand, the 'Antropocene' is already at play in the Arctic, as
Finger discusses in his chapter, and on the other hand, what happens in
the Arctic matters on a global scale.

To conclude, the Arctic region with its high political stability, as
well as military structures based on the nuclear weapon systems of
Russia and the United States, and with a keen international (mostly
multilateral) cooperation, much initiated and supported by nonstate
actors, could be interpreted to be positively 'exceptional' and left out
of regional crises and wars and political and military tension. Here the
Arctic and [**[international]{.mark} Arctic [coop]{.mark}eration**
[would]{.mark} be]{.underline} and become a joint valuable, human-made
asset between the eight Arctic states, as the International Space
Station (ISS) acts for Russia and the United States and their space
cooperation. Furthermore, here the Arctic / international Arctic
cooperation would be [[a **reserve for the
future**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the moment, [[when it
is]{.underline}]{.mark}, again, [[needed to]{.mark} **calm down** and to
**press [reset]{.mark}**. The [situation might come]{.mark} **sooner
than later**, [when]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [world, including Russia and
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, is [facing]{.mark} **even [more
serious]{.mark} regional** and **irrational warfare**]{.underline} than
the threat by ISIS and the exposing middle East, that is, [**real big
[worldwide]{.mark} challenges** and **[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline},
such as immediate impacts of rapid climate change and the
'Anthropocene'.

[In this kind of situation, [the Arctic would act as a **test
ground**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} a [**workshop** to]{.mark} examine and
[test]{.mark} **soft ways of [governance]{.mark}** and brainstorm an
**alternative way** to]{.underline} definite [\[define\] security [by
causing a **paradigm shift**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Heininen in this
volume). Here the two discourses are far too much state-centric. A more
interesting feature of Arctic security is the coexistence of several
concepts of security and its transformation [from]{.underline}
traditional and [**state-controlled** security to **human** security
with an emphasis on the environment]{.underline}, or economic
development/security, and that they are closely related to each other
[making 'Arctic security' a **special kind of phenomenon** to influence
the region and its geopolitics]{.underline}. With regard to the future
securities of the global Arctic there are challenges, which go beyond
state sovereignty and nationalistic security thinking.

### No I/L---2AC

#### No internal link:

#### Speech acts in [debate]{.underline} don't change security [policy]{.underline}.

**Çetindişli, 24**---PhD candidate, Bursa Uludag University, Department
of International Relations (Özge Gökçen, "A Methodological Discussion on
Evaluating the Success of Any Securitizing Move," International Journal
of Social Inquiry, 17(1), 2024, pp. 1−16, dml)

However, as many authors have indicated, [there is **vagueness** around
the process by which the securitizer and audience **interact** to create
securitization]{.underline} (Bright, 2012). Yet, [scholars **have not
fully compromised** on the questions of]{.underline} ‟[**Which
audience** needs to be convinced of the legitimacy of a securitizing
move?]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} ‟[**How** or with **what effects**
does the intended audience engage in the process of
securitization?]{.underline}" In this sense, Williams (2011) portrays
the audience as a ‟radically underdeveloped" concept (p. 212). In this
context, it can be argued that the first problem is heavily rooted in
the uncertainty about who the addressee (the audience) will be a certain
securitizing move.

This paper assumes that [there is **little generalizability** regarding
the precise identity of the audience]{.underline}, bearing in mind that
[each state]{.underline}, [society]{.underline}, [or institution has a
**different form** of government]{.underline}, [culture]{.underline},
[and norms]{.underline}. In addition, it also supports the notion that
[any security policy requires the approval of **multiple audiences**
that may exist within a single securitization process]{.underline} and
that [audiences often possess **differential powers**]{.underline},
leading to effects on securitization outcomes.

Given this and drawing on Balzacq and Vuori's definitions, the work
posits that the portrait of the ‟engaged audience" can be designed in a
‟case-specific" manner. As claimed by Vuori (2008), ‟Audiences form
based on the function the securitization act is intended to serve" (p.
72). Similarly, Balzacq's reformulation of the concept of audience as an
empowering audience, divided into moral and formal, which enables the
securitizing actor to carry out the proposed action, is also valuable.
Therefore, it can be asserted that [a **case-specific** characterization
of audiences based on]{.underline} the form of government and rules of
the state in which they live and [their **direct connection** to the
problem]{.underline} (legitimization and authorization of security
rhetoric) (Balzacq, 2005, pp. 8--9) [or their potency to **authorize
security action** against the threat]{.underline} (Collins, 2005, pp.
572--573) or, [their position within **different phases**]{.underline}
or settings [of the securitization process]{.underline} rhetoric
(Salter, 2008, pp. 321--349) [would provide]{.underline} analysts with
[a **more comprehensive** analysis]{.underline}.

The precariousness of the audience's position within the theory persists
despite a growing number of case studies, which is another significant
issue closely related to the outcomes of securitization. This is
because, while some scholars keep arguing that the audience is the
enabler of the success of securitization, others, like Floyd, contend
that [there is **no definitive correlation** between audience approval
and the existence or success of securitization]{.underline}. This
ambivalence creates ambiguity about the audience's identity and purpose,
thus making the mechanism of intersubjectivity problematic (Cô té ,
2016, pp. 2--3). In addition, some argue that for successful
securitization, audience acceptance must encompass the securitization
discourse of the agents as well as the policy responses to the threat
proposed by them (Salter, 2010, pp. 116--132). For instance, Roe (2008)
states that [the relation between the **securitizer** and
the]{.underline} audience is constituted not only in agreement with
whether the support required is either formal or moral but also in
agreement with what the audience is being asked to approve: ‟This is an
**[existential threat]{.underline}** and/or given this is an existential
threat, these are the responses I proffer to block it (p. 622)."
However, in this study, this assessment [is]{.underline} regarded as
**[highly exaggerated]{.underline}**.

#### Securitization doesn't [automatically]{.underline} justify emergency actions---if so, it's [non-unique]{.underline}.

**Çetindişli, 24**---PhD candidate, Bursa Uludag University, Department
of International Relations (Özge Gökçen, "A Methodological Discussion on
Evaluating the Success of Any Securitizing Move," International Journal
of Social Inquiry, 17(1), 2024, pp. 1−16, ST=security theory, dml)

Furthermore, Bigo (2002) argues that contrary to the claims of the CS,
security is not a ‟field" that is the responsibility of any security
forces, and therefore there is no distinction between the political
sphere and the security sphere. Moreover, **[most]{.underline}** of the
[current security practices are **already** extraordinary]{.underline},
[and with **each passing day** the]{.underline}
‟**[extraordinariness]{.underline}**" [is brought into daily
politics]{.underline} via the practices of power (pp. 64--65), or the
de-formalized law and administration.

The [emphasis on]{.underline} ‟**[emergency]{.underline}**," which
refers to the suspension of responsibility, transparency, and
accountability, [is seen]{.underline} in the context of the study [as
a]{.underline} ‟purification **[ritual]{.underline}**" (Bigo, 2000, p.
325) [in which **everything is justified** in the face of a
threat]{.underline}.

However, [**sophisticated analyses** reveal that the response to a
securitized threat following any securitizing move is **not always
exceptional**]{.underline}, [sometimes it is a **routine
practice**]{.underline}, a normalized exception, and sometimes a
combination of both exceptional and routine factors (Bigo, 2000;
Bourbeau, 2014; Corry, 2012; Floyd, 2016; Floyd, 2023; Salter, 2010;
Trombetta, 2008).

6\. Concluding Remarks

[ST focuses on the process by which any issue]{.underline} that
constitutes the subject of the public sphere [is declared an
**existential threat** via the **speech act**]{.underline}, thus
established as a security concern. The original posit of [the
theory]{.underline} is that a securitizing move transforms a succeeded
security practice when the target audience accepts the arguments of the
securitizing agent, and the agent is freed from constraints. Thus, an
analyst who wants to evaluate the outcomes of any securitizing move has
two key factors to consider: ‟audience approval and adopting
extraordinary measures." However, the classical version [has been
**heavily criticized** for **failing** to adequately
determine]{.underline} the status of these constituents (audience and
exceptionalism) and for promoting a securitizer-driven and non-usual
process to address urgent threats.

This study seeks to provide analysts with an avenue, more specific than
before, of ‟[the **conditions** that need to be met for a]{.underline}
certain [securitizing move to occur **successfully**]{.underline}" which
was theorized in a non-rigid way in the classical cast. In this sense,
the paper begins by addressing ‟the politics of the audience." In
theory, the CS defines securitization as an intersubjective process and
delineates the audience as one of the main actors of this process.
However, [it did not sufficiently answer some **fundamental questions**
such as]{.underline} ‟**[who]{.underline}** or whom [this audience
consists of]{.underline}" [or]{.underline} ‟[how to **measure** the
reactions of the relevant audience]{.underline}," thus dragging
securitization ‟in practice" to a process that takes place only under
the patronage of the securitizer.

Given this, the study proposes an ‟effective and visible audience
portrait" to strengthen the intersubjective character that makes the
theory unique and addresses these ambiguities. An empowered audience can
be a counterbalance to the uncontrolled actions of securitizing actors.
It also argues that the ‟engaged audience" would be specifically
determined for each case study, as each society, state, or institution
has a different form of government, norms, and culture. To measure the
support or resistance of the engaged audience, the study suggests
observation of social events such as protests or riots, as well as
formal (voting on a particular issue or a general election) or informal
(opinion polls or surveys) methods, again depending on the context in
which securitization takes place (whether democratic or not).

[The second issue]{.underline} problematized in the study is [the logic
that **confines** securitization to an **exceptional** security
framework]{.underline}, reminiscent of fast-track procedures or coercive
methods such as military and police forces. ‟The logic of exception" [is
both **inherently risky** and **inappropriate** for real-world
securitizations]{.underline}. Indeed, [in recent years]{.underline}, the
[security]{.underline} perception [has **transcended** its conventional
boundaries]{.underline}, and besides conventional
[concerns]{.underline}, sophisticated ones [like epidemics or
environmental degradation have been added to the security
agenda]{.underline}. With this expansion, [in **many**
cases]{.underline}, [the securitizing move has been followed
by]{.underline} ‟[**unexceptional** responses]{.underline}." So, the
paper argues that [in addition to the]{.underline} ‟[**exceptional**
ways]{.underline}" of original ST [to deal with an **existential
threat**]{.underline}, ‟**[normalized]{.underline}** exceptional"
[and]{.underline}, more importantly, ‟[**routine**
responses]{.underline}" should be inserted into the functioning of ST.
‟Normalized exceptional" is what Neal (2012) calls ‟legislative
exceptionalism," which [are]{.underline} practices that were once seen
as an exceptional response but which, over time, transform into the ‟new
normal" thanks to legislation [enacted]{.underline} by governments. The
USA's 2001 Patriot Act and the UK's 2001 Anti- Terrorism, Crime, and
Security Act (ATCSA) exemplify the institutionalization of
exceptionalism through legislative measures against the relative
slowness of normal politics. ‟Routine responses" refer to any
‟action/observable change in behaviour that takes place in the ordinary
functioning of normal politics" (Floyd, 2016, p. 684) or established
mechanisms in liberal democratic states and is associated with the
securitizing movement. [**Contrary** to the]{.underline}
‟[**exceptionalism** of securitization]{.underline}," [the]{.underline}
‟[decision-making is **open** in the sense that legislatures and other
bodies are able to **scrutinize** the executive]{.underline}" (Roe,
2012, p. 251). In this sense, [the process is **accountable** and
**transparent**]{.underline}. For instance, a decision to impose a
sanction that follows established norms in response to the presumed
threat. Inspired by Foucault and Bourdieu, Bourbeau (2014, p. 190) calls
them the ‟logic of routine" and describes them as a set of routinized
and stereotyped practices carried out by bureaucrats and security
experts, in which technology plays an important role.

### No Prior Questions---2AC

#### Sweeping theories can't explain policy decisions---if they can, then our framework [link turns]{.underline} their offense.

**Rose, 21**---editor of Foreign Affairs (Gideon, "Foreign Policy for
Pragmatists," Foreign Affairs, March/April 2021, dml)

[[Theories]{.mark} of]{.underline} history, fundamental beliefs about
**[how the world works]{.underline}**, [[are]{.mark} usually
[**assumed** rather than **argued**]{.mark} and **[rarely]{.mark}** get
[subjected to]{.mark} **serious [scrutiny]{.mark}**. Yet these general
ideas **set the parameters** for]{.underline} all the **[specific policy
choices]{.underline}** an administration makes. Know an administration's
theory of history, and much of the rest is easy to fill in.

There are a lot of possible [theories]{.underline} of history, but they
[tend to fall]{.underline}, like Bush's and Trump's, [into two main
camps: **optimistic** and **pessimistic**]{.underline}. Thus, the
Clinton administration followed its own version of happy
directionality---think of it as Bush with less muscular Christianity.
And there have been earlier believers in Trump's dark and stormy night,
as well.

Unfortunately, [given the stakes of the question, **[no one]{.mark}
really [knows]{.mark}** [whether]{.mark} the [optimists or]{.mark} the
[pessimists have the better case]{.mark}]{.underline}. Political
[theorists have fought about that for **centuries**]{.underline}, with
neither side winning. A few generations ago, modern social scientists
joined in, [**generating** and **testing** lots of theories in lots of
ways, but still, **neither** camp bested the other]{.underline}. And
then, in the last few years, history got interesting again and erased
some of the few things the scholars thought they had learned.

As individuals, presidents have had strong views on these matters. As a
group, they have not. [[American]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign
[[policy]{.mark} is **notorious** for its **[internal
tensions]{.mark}**. Its fits and starts and reversals [**do not fit
easily** into any single theoretical framework]{.mark}. Yet this
pluralism has proved to be a **feature**, not a **bug**. Precisely
because [it **has not embraced any one approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}
to foreign policy [**[consistently]{.mark}**, Washington has managed to
**avoid the worst aspects** of all]{.underline}. Blessed with
geopolitical privilege, it has slowly stumbled forward, moving over the
centuries from peripheral obscurity to global hegemony. [Its genius has
been less **strategic insight** than an ability to **cut
losses**]{.underline}.

By now, [it seems fair to say that [the debate]{.mark} between the
optimists and the pessimists **[will never be settled]{.mark}
conclusively**, since each perspective knows something big]{.underline}
about international politics. [[Instead of **choosing**]{.mark} between
them]{.underline}, the new administration should [[keep **both**]{.mark}
truths in its pocket, [taking **each** out as
appropriate]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Learning in U.S. foreign policy has come largely across administrations.
President Joe Biden's goal should be to speed up the process, allowing
it to happen within an administration. Call it the Bayesian Doctrine:
rather than being wedded to its priors, the administration should
constantly update them.

[The way to do so is to [make theorists]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
principals, the administration's true team of rivals, forcing them to
[[make **real-world predictions**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[offer
**testable practical advice**]{.mark}, and then [seeing whose **turn
out**]{.mark} **to be [better]{.mark}** in real time]{.underline}. In
this approach, searching [[**intellectual honesty** is more important
than **ideology**; what people think **matters less** than whether they
can **change their minds**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Constantly calculating
implied odds won't always win pots. But it will help the administration
fold bad hands early, increasing its winnings over time.

### Particularity---2AC

#### They must contextualize their links to the plan. Generalizations [don't apply]{.underline} to the Arctic and our descriptions are [justified]{.underline}, but [don't necessitate]{.underline} violence.

**Østhagen, 20**---Senior Research Fellow at the Fridtjof Nansen
Institute (Andreas, "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Three Levels of
Arctic Geopolitics," *The Arctic and World Order*, Chapter 15, pp.
367-372, dml)

[It is]{.underline} therefore [**futile to generalize** about how Arctic
countries]{.underline} themselves [**perceive** and **respond**
to]{.underline} their [security interests and challenges]{.underline}
across the whole northern circumpolar region. Security and---essentially
defense---dynamics in the Arctic remain anchored in the sub-regional and
bilateral level. Of these, the Barents Sea/European Arctic stand out.
Here, [bilateral relations between **Russia** and **Norway** are
especially challenging]{.underline} in terms of security interactions
and concerns. Norway is a small state and NATO member bordering a
Russia---with its potent Northern Fleet based at Severomorsk on the Kola
Peninsula---intent on investing in the Arctic for regional and strategic
purpos- es. Since 2014, defense aspects have made relations increasingly
tense, with bellicose rhetoric and a surge in military exercises on both
sides.43 In other words: with Russia intent on re-establishing the
prominence of its Northern Fleet primarily for strategic purposes
(albeit with an eye towards regional development as well),
Norway---whose defense posture is defined by the situation in its
northern areas---faces a more challenging security environment.44

However, bilateral [dynamics]{.underline} in the case of Norway--Russia
[are **multifaceted**]{.underline}, [as the two]{.underline} states
[also engage in various types of **cooperation**]{.underline}, ranging
from co-management of fish stocks to search-and-rescue operations and a
border crossing regime.45 Furthermore, in 2010, Norway and Russia were
able to resolve a longstanding (almost four-decadesold) maritime
boundary dispute in the Barents Sea, partly in order to be initiate
joint petroleum ventures in the disputed area.46 [These cooperative
arrangements and agreements have not been revoked]{.underline} after the
events of 2014,47 [a **clear indication** of the **complexity**
of]{.underline} one of the most fraught bilateral relations in [the
Arctic]{.underline}.

Dynamics in bilateral [relations in the Arctic]{.underline}, even if
designated as "ugly," **[cannot simply be defined as good or
bad]{.underline}**. [They are influenced by what is taking place at the
regional and international levels]{.underline}, [but are **distinct
enough**]{.underline} so [that they warrant **scrutiny** and
**examination**]{.underline}.

Mixing Characters and Future Plot Twists

The separation between these three different levels is an analytical
tool for unpacking some of the dynamics at work in this specific part of
the world. [These dynamics are **not constant**]{.underline}, [but
**constantly evolving**]{.underline}. Two aspects are central in
assessing how the future of Arctic security might look: the interaction
between the "levels," and the way in which the global relationship of
the great powers, in which the non-Arctic state actor China plays a key
role, affects the region. The former draws attention to what happens
regionally and what from the bilateral or wider international plane
influences regional affairs. The latter concerns how great powers (and
great power competition) external to a region can impact region-specific
developments.

Starting with regional (intra-Arctic) dynamics, the central question is
how much developments at this level can be insulated from events and
relations elsewhere. If the goal is to keep the Arctic as a separate
"exceptional" region of cooperation, the Arctic states have managed to
do a relatively good job, despite setbacks due to the Russian annexation
of Crimea in 2014. This political situation is underpinned by the Arctic
states' shared economic interest in maintaining stable regional
relations.

Moreover, we cannot discount the role of an Arctic community of experts,
ranging from diplomats participating in forums such as the Arctic
Council, to academics and businesspersons who constitute the backbone of
fora and networks that implicitly or explicitly promote northern
cooperation. The annual conferences that have emerged over the past
decade, often gathering several thousand Arctic "experts," are one such
channel.48 Here we should also note the new agreements and/ or
institutions set up to deal with specific issues in the Arctic as they
arise, such as the 2018 "A5+5" (including China, Iceland, Japan, South
Korea and the EU) agreement on preventing unregulated fishing in the
Central Arctic Ocean, or the Arctic Coast Guard Forum that was
established in 2015.49 Such agreements and interactions among "epistemic
communities"50 have a socializing effect on the Arctic states,51 as
cooperation becomes the modus operandi for dealing with Arctic issues.

The most pressing regional challenge, however, is how to deal with and
talk about Arctic-specific security concerns, which are often excluded
from such cooperative forums and venues. The debate on what mechanisms
are best suited for further expanding security cooperation has now been
ongoing for a decade.52 Some hold that the Arctic Council should acquire
a security component,53 whereas others look to the Arctic Coast Guard
Forum or other more ad-hoc venues.54

The Northern Chiefs of Defense Conference and the Arctic Security Forces
Roundtable were initiatives established to this end in 2011/2012,55 but
they fell apart after 2014. The difficulties encountered in trying to
establish an arena for security discussions indicate the high
sensitivity to, and influences from, events and evolutions elsewhere.
Any Arctic security dialogue is fragile, and risks being overshadowed by
the increasingly tense NATO--Russia relationship in Europe at large.
Paradoxically, precisely what such an arena for dialogue is intended to
achieve (preventing the spillover of tensions from other parts of the
world to the Arctic) is the very reason why progress is difficult.

Let us now turn us to the international level and how it impacts Arctic
affairs. Primarily, this concerns the growing hostility between what
some refer to as "two poles"---the United States and its perceived
challenger China.56 [Some scholars have stressed the **anarchic state**
of the international system]{.underline}, [where **relative power
considerations** and **struggles** determine the path taken by
states]{.underline} and thus inexorably lead to conflict.57 However,
such [analyses focused on relative power **do not have to become
self-fulfilling prophecies**]{.underline}. [Measures to **alleviate**
concerns and possible rivalry can]{.underline} after all [be
taken]{.underline} at the international level---[by
**cooperation**]{.underline}, by putting in place agreements, or by
developing joint institutions, thereby fostering greater trust.58

If we transfer these theories to the Arctic situation, we note that
China's increasing global engagement and influence has in fact---thus
far---been rather subdued in the North. **[Beijing]{.underline}**, for
all its rhetoric about its in interests in a "Polar Silk Route" (2018)
[has used]{.underline} all the correct Arctic buzzwords about
cooperation and [restraint]{.underline} in tune with the preferences of
the Arctic states.59

[However]{.underline}, [there are **legitimate fears** that this may be
just be a mollifying tactic]{.underline}---[merely the beginning of a
**more assertive Chinese presence**]{.underline} where geo-economic
actions, i.e. financial investments with motivated by geopolitical
goals60---are part of a more ambitious political strategy aimed at
challenging the hegemony of the "West" and also the balance of power in
the North.61 The Arctic speech by U.S. Secretary of State Pompeo in 2019
fed directly into this narrative.62 The United States obviously has a
considerable security presence in the Arctic that ranges from an air
base in Thule, rotating ships and planes at Naval Air Station Keflavik,
U.S. military personnel in Canada as part of the NORAD exchange program,
rotational deployment of U.S. Marines to Norway, as well as its own
Alaskan Arctic component.63

[The **question** is **whether**]{.underline} Chinese [actions in the
region are **meant to challenge**]{.underline} this presence by an
engagement that appears to assumes predominantly soft-power
characteristics. At the same time, [shifting power balances and greater
regional interest]{.underline} from Beijing [**need not lead to
tension** and **conflict**]{.underline}---to the contrary, they might
spur efforts to find ways of including China in regional forums,
alleviating the (geoeconomic) concerns of Arctic states.64

The other Great Power with global (international) status as much as
Arctic influence is of course Russia, which in contrast to China is by
nature an Arctic state. As the by far largest country of the circumpolar
region and the most ambitious in terms of military investments and
activity, Russia sets the parameters for much of the Arctic security
trajectory. This is not likely to change, although exactly how the
future Arctic security environment will look like depends on the West's
response to Russian actions predominantly taking place in other regions
around the world.

However, [Russian military engagement]{.underline} in the Arctic **[does
not have a uniform regional effect]{.underline}**: even if old bases are
revived and new ones are built along its Northern shoreline and islands,
its emphasis is concentrated in the North Atlantic/Barents Sea portions
of the wider circumpolar area. This is where the bilateral arena comes
into play. [Geographic proximity does play a role]{.underline}.
[Neighbors]{.underline}, after all, [are forced to interact
**regardless** of the positive or negative character of their
relations]{.underline}. In turn, [**centuries** of interaction
**compound** and form **historic patterns** that influence relations
**beyond** the immediate effects of other crisis and
developments]{.underline}---on the regional or global levels.65 [It is
precisely the **complexity** of these relations and multiple multi-level
entanglements that make it **difficult to categorize** them in one way
or another]{.underline}.

Take Norway and Russia: the two countries collaborate on everything from
dealing with environmental concerns to cultural exchange and border
crossings, independent of events elsewhere. At the same time, these
relations are not immune to outside developments. The regional upsurge
in Arctic attention around 2007/2008 (because of flag plantings,
resource appraisals and Russia's re-focus northwards), had a positive
impact on bilateral relations. In 2010, a new "era" of Russo-Norwegian
relations was announced,66 after various forms of bilateral cooperation
had been established as the Cold War receded.

However, bilateral relations are also behest to power asymmetry,
rivalry, and the tendency of states to revert to power balancing (for
example, via alliance systems). Moreover, they are influenced by
international events. When events in Ukraine brought a deterioration in
NATO--Russia relations, Norway--Russia relations were negatively
affected.67 Indeed since then mistrust and accusations of aggressive
behavior have returned, reminiscent of Cold War dynamics.

At the same time, bilateral relationships are impacted by regional
relations (say, a new agreement signed under Arctic Council auspices),
and can in turn have an impact on the same relations (deterioration in
bilateral relations might, for example, make it more difficult to agree
on something in the Arctic Council). In other words, bilateral
relations, especially if so delicately balanced as Norway's relations
with Russia, can easily become funnels for issues and dynamics at
different levels in international politics.

Nonetheless, as we have mostly seen in their bilateral relations, the
Arctic states try time and again to take measures to deviate from
exogenous power-balancing behavior and influences. Through regional webs
of agreements and collaborative measures, they seek to reduce tension
and prevent conflict (even if disagreements persist over conflictual
issues elsewhere). This is the balancing act that Arctic states---like
states everywhere---must manage.

Conclusions

In this chapter, I have employed a stylized separation involving three
different levels---the regional, the international, and the bilateral,
or, if we wish, the "good," the "bad," and the "ugly." Crucially, what
happens in the Arctic does not remain solely in the Arctic, be it
environmentally or politically. Conversely [events and processes
**elsewhere** can]{.underline} in turn [impact the
Arctic]{.underline}---in terms of global warming, security, and desires
to exploit economic opportunities. Despite this apparent general
insight, there are some paradoxical dynamics---explaining the mix of
cooperation and tension if not conflict---that are best understood
through the threefold distinction presented here: international
competition (why the United States is increasingly focusing on China in
an Arctic context), regional interaction (why Arctic states still meet
to sign new agreements hailing the cooperative spirit of the North), and
bilateral relations (why some Arctic states, and not others, invest
heavily in their Northern defense posture).

That the Arctic is important for the Arctic states is not new. Indeed,
increasing attention has been paid for some time now to northern
security challenges by Arctic actors (including Russia, the United
States, and by proxy the EU) and those with a growing interest in the
Arctic, like China. Yet [the intensity of interests is
**novel**]{.underline}. Regional collaborative schemes have expanded in
response. [The **growing importance** of the region]{.underline} within
the international system [is]{.underline} also [becoming
apparent]{.underline}. This is, however, only partly linked to events in
the Arctic (ice-melt, economic ventures, etc.). For a large part it has
to do with the strategic position of the Arctic between Asia, Europe,
and North America. On the bilateral level, we can note some
intra-regional competition, as well as investments and cooperation.
However, here [it is **difficult to generalize** across the
Arctic]{.underline} "[region]{.underline}," precisely [because of the
**vastness** and **inaccessibility** of the area]{.underline} itself,
[and the **complex nature** of relations]{.underline}.

What these nuances imply is that [**simplistic one-liner descriptions**
of]{.underline} "[Arctic geopolitics]{.underline}" [must be taken with a
**pinch of salt**]{.underline}. This should inspire further studies of
security politics in a region that is at least as complex as any other
part of the world, but that has again become a focal point as the
present world order appears to be at a tipping point.

**Blagden, 18**---Senior Lecturer in International Security at the
Strategy and Security Institute, Department of Politics, University of
Exeter (David, "Realism, Uncertainty, and the Security Dilemma: Identity
and the Tantalizing Promise of Transformed International Relations,"

The previous section documented how [[social variables]{.mark} **might**
be taken [as]{.mark} having the **potential** to transform international
politics]{.underline}. This section now turns to an explanation of why
[it is]{.underline} so [**hard to fulfill** such seeming
transformational promise]{.underline}. Running throughout is the
argument that [while playing a particular social role or expressing a
particular cultural identity are certainly [state interests]{.mark},
they [are]{.mark} **necessarily [subordinate]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
political **[survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as a sovereign entity with
control over its own foreign policy), "physiological"
**[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}** (the safety from death and harm of
the state's population), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
**[[prosperity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (a baseline level of which is
necessary to ensure physiological security). Put simply, [if a state and
its population do not exist, it **cannot achieve anything
else**]{.underline}---such as fulfilling a social role or expressing a
cultural identity---either.36 And since survival, security, and
prosperity all have a material base---as Wendt recognizes via his "rump
materialism" (he simply does not think the material base yields
determinate outcomes)---so too must states necessarily put the defense
of such interests ahead of social role fulfillment if they want to be in
a position to play any sort of role in future.37 [[That is **not to
suggest** that states **do not**]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes---or,
indeed, often---[[make ideationally driven]{.mark} foreign policy
[choices]{.mark} that are **detrimental** to their other interests. [It
is]{.mark} simply a description of [states' **incentive structure**,
which **much of the time** they]{.mark} end up
[follow]{.mark}ing]{.underline}.

[It is necessary]{.underline} at this point [to defend the notion that
[there is]{.mark}, in fact, [a **material base independent of the social
world**]{.mark} and [that]{.mark} characteristics of that material base
[can yield **causal outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all,
[military technology does not descend as **manna from heaven**, but
rather is created via **human agency** in response to perceived
threats]{.underline}, and thus it necessarily contains a dose of
military culture and broader social identity from the outset. The same
goes for the overall share of national economic resources allocated to
defense, and indeed, money itself is a socially constructed store of
value, albeit one premised upon underlying materially underpinned
wealth.38 Any assessment of strategic priorities is necessarily filtered
through the strategic-cultural lens of the institution(s) doing the
assessing; asking one's navy for an analysis of the relative merits of
sea denial versus power projection, for example, necessarily delivers an
answer infused with that navy's historical trajectory, its sense of its
role in the nation and the world, its internal politics, and so forth.
The broader question of whether the sea--- like other geographical
features---constitutes a strategic barrier or a highway similarly
requires cultural interpretation.

Even technologies with such seemingly self-evident destructive power as
nuclear weapons are not self-evidently "good" or "bad," either morally
or strategically, absent social interpretation. One might see them as
"bad" because of the potential humanitarian consequences of their use
(or because of the constraints they impose on conventional military
options), or "good" because of the casualties in conventional war they
prevent (and deterrence that they enable at low relative cost). Their
political meaning is thus socially constructed, even if the
physiological effects on human bodies of their detonation have only one
possible outcome. If military technology and resources require a social
component to be both developed and meaningfully deployed, then Wendt's
contention that there is indeed a "rump" material base but that it is
simply indeterminate---in the absence of a friend/enemy distinction---as
a cause of international outcomes becomes alluring.39

Crucially, however, [each of these social choices involves a **decisive
material effect** that is **not open to interpretation**. It may be
debatable whether nuclear weapons are "**good**" or "**bad**," but the
**effect** that one will have]{.underline} on the city and its
population of frail, carbon-based human animals over which it detonates
[represents a **single**, **determinate outcome**]{.underline}---and a
state facing another state armed with them must therefore make certain
necessary calculations based around that capability.40 In the same vein,
[while]{.underline} the [strategic threat/opportunity]{.underline}
constituted by geographical features, such as the oceanic moats enjoyed
by the United States and United Kingdom, [may be a matter of
interpretation, the **underlying material
factor**]{.underline}---humans' inability to cross water without
spending resources on capital (ships) that could otherwise have been
spent on further ground forces---[yields certain **necessary
outcomes**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the very **foundation** of relations
between major powers]{.underline} after 1945---secure second-strike
nuclear deterrence and its disincentivization of conventional
aggression41---[rests on a physical "**fact**"]{.underline}: the
relative impenetrability of water to the electro-magnetic spectrum and
the associated survivability that it provides to ballistic missile
submarines.

[The same goes for the decision over what **share of**]{.underline}
national economic [**resources** to allocate to defense. Choosing a
proportion may indeed be a **socially** and **ideationally informed
political choice**, but the **underlying size** of the resource
pools]{.underline}---and the military potentiality that they underpin---
rests on the total size of the state's capital stock (both human and
physical), which [is **not a matter of social
interpretation**]{.underline}. And while military technology is indeed
developed in response to human agency, it is done so from within the
technical bounds of the feasible. Such rebuttals apply more widely:
[[while the balance of power]{.underline}]{.mark}, including resources
and technology, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed necessarily
[[interpreted through]{.mark} states' [social lenses, it]{.mark}
nonetheless **[conditions]{.mark} the bounds of [the possible]{.mark}**
even in the absence of social content]{.underline}. And when those
possibilities include hostile use, certain behaviors are necessitated by
prudent states seeking survival for their populations.

Realists should indeed be castigated if they infer predictions solely
from the balance of currently existing military hardware---a thin and
intellectually impoverished understanding of relative power---and
critics are correct to point out that a large stock of materiel is not
the same as being able to compel another to do that which they would not
otherwise have done, in line with the behavioral output understanding of
power commonly associated with Dahl (as distinct from the input
understanding).42 But [[viewing]{.mark} total [state power in terms of
**overall assets**]{.mark}]{.underline}, defined as the state's total
stock of physical,43 financial,44 and human capital,45 [[does a **better
job** of]{.underline}]{.mark} first [[encompassing]{.mark} all the
**[relevant resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}---equipment, stores of
value, human bodies and brains---[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, second,
[[providing an **effective measurable proxy** for the **underlying
causes** of behavioral power]{.underline}]{.mark} (given that [the
latter can only be observed **ex post**, and is therefore **not an
effective predictor** of outcomes]{.underline}). [[None of this is to
**deny**]{.mark} that there is [a **social element**]{.mark} to the
construction of all these power resources]{.underline}, or indeed that
the "material" itself involves a large dose of social input, and this
chapter is therefore not attempting to "settle" the debate over the
precise nature of the relationship. [It is simply to point
out]{.underline}, rather, [that [states' power]{.mark} resources [and
their effects are **not wholly socially constructed**]{.mark} and that
the nonsocial element **produces certain effects**]{.underline}.

Turning to specific arguments over states' pursuit of status, the notion
that achieving a particular elevated status and thus fulfilling a
certain international-social role might be a goal of states is
relatively uncontentious.46 For instance, one insightful recent
constructivist work on Britain's pursuit of international status
suggests at the outset that states' social roles are not the same as
their interests, ambitions, values, or capabilities.47 Yet the same work
later asserts that social role actually produces national interests,
thus implying that states cannot in fact have interests besides those
constituted by identity.48 Such conceptual tensions are symptomatic of a
theoretical dilemma: the more minimal former assertion is the harder to
refute, yet the more ambitious latter claim is necessary if
constructivists are to escape the realist retort that fulfilling a
social role is merely an interest of states---and a subordinate one to
materially underpinned survival at that---rather than the interest.
Escaping this retort is in turn necessary if constructivists are to be
able to claim that anarchy is indeed what states make of it socially,
since transforming the prevailing culture of anarchy would require
states to lower their guard against each other---and thus accept higher
risk to their survival, at least while the hoped-for transformation was
taking place---in pursuit of an international-social value.

The less contentious point---that playing a particular social role is
one of multiple interests---opens the way to conceding that the most
fundamental state interests remain "political" survival (of state
territory and institutions), "biological" security (of the citizenry's
bodies), and preserving some baseline level of economic prosperity,
since a state that cannot survive cannot achieve anything else. But if
that is the case, then from these materially underpinned vital interests
follows a need to be capable of defending them against potential
foes---and that, if it comes to it, means accomplishing certain military
missions.49 Such military capability is necessarily underpinned by
material resources, even as it also has a socially constructed
dimension. Such capability can be provided independently (internal
balancing), via allies (external balancing), or through some combination
of the two---prudent strategy, including eschewing avoidable
confrontation and aligning with the preferences of powerful allies, is a
key aspect of state success50---but either way, it rests on some
friendly actor's underlying resources. And reliance on external
balancing brings its own dangers, as recently experienced by European
NATO, when one's allies turn coercive.51

In short, [such an analysis]{.underline}---while conceding that social
role and status are important to states, all else held equal, and that
such concerns sometimes drive them to act in imprudent
ways---nonetheless [suggests that hedging]{.underline} against
abandonment, coercion, or outright destruction [via balance-of-power
positioning is **likely to remain pervasive**. This is **not to say**
that there will not be variation in the **extent** and **severity** of
such competition. All manner of ideational variables might exacerbate or
reduce tensions]{.underline}, as discussed above, and even in the
absence of such social forces, overt, intensive competition may yield
self-destructive outcomes if it increases another side's insecurity and
causes them to adopt a more offensively capable strategic posture in
response.52 [The point]{.underline}, rather, [is simply that conflict
will never be a **wholly absent possibility** and that that reality
**must condition states' calculations**]{.underline}---often to the
point of some level of defensive hedging, if the state has the resources
and technology to make that feasible---even in times of broadly
cooperative relations.

[[A similar retort can be made against the claims]{.mark} that threat
perception and military [doctrine are]{.mark} both [so]{.mark}
**fundamentally [skewed]{.mark}** [by culture that they may be]{.mark}
**commonly** and **wholly [disconnected]{.mark}** [from balance-of-power
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}, and which subsequently allow for an end
to military balancing, mutual threat, and security competition. While
this short chapter is clearly not the place for an extensive review, the
success of many states--- particularly resource-rich ones---in aping
military technological and professional best practice would seem to
suggest that much of the time states are able to achieve what Gray,
borrowing from marketing theory, dubs "good enough" force postures in
the face of strategic uncertainty.53 Similarly, when states do "die" in
the face of foreign aggression---a rare occurrence in post-1945
international politics---it is more often as a consequence of their
relative military weakness and geographical vulnerability than as a
consequence of a failure to perceive a looming threat.54 Indeed, a key
contribution of the neoclassical realist research program has been to
demonstrate that [while domestic-political variables may **filter
strategic behavior** in multifarious and often nefarious ways, there are
still **underlying balance-of-power structural pressures** at the
international-systemic level that states **usually respond to**, even if
they do so **belatedly** or **imperfectly**]{.underline}.55 In short,
while Waltzian "socialization" toward accurately perceiving threats and
formulating effective military doctrine may frequently be hindered---and
sometimes terminally compromised---by cultural factors, [[as a
description of]{.mark} the **workings of [the international
system]{.mark}** as a whole]{.underline} (as he intended his theory to
be), [[realist predictions]{.mark} of enduring concern and possible
competition over the distribution of material power [are **not
undermined** by]{.mark}]{.underline} this recognition.56 Tellingly,
despite their strong **[[ideational commitments]{.underline}]{.mark}**
toward democracy promotion and human rights enforcement under the banner
of upholding international order, Western states have recently had the
reprioritization of balancing against increasingly capable rivals forced
upon them by developments in the balance of power, whether that be
China's rise in Asia for the United States or Russia's (partial)
resurgence in Europe for the rest of NATO.57

Finally, [even **[national identity]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the
**[nationalism]{.underline}** it engenders---the ideational "master
variable" underpinning the nation-state system---[[is]{.mark} itself
[forged by]{.mark} the interaction of **political group identity** and
the **survival imperative** under structural anarchy]{.underline}. To
paraphrase Tilly, [war **makes the state**, and the state **makes
war**]{.underline}.58 [Modern nation-states may have **originated** as
political groups of individually weak human beings with some shared
identity connection, but their choice to **form states** as protective
war machines capable of generating]{.underline} the military
[power]{.underline} necessary [to defend]{.underline} against similar
political units, [and the subsequent mutual reinforcement of national
identity and state strength, is **very much consistent** with realism's
predictions of [the **consequences of**]{.mark} **international
[structural anarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, as noted earlier,
Mearsheimer uses these grounds to argue that nationalism and realism are
mutually supportive theories.59 In the post-- Cold War world, moreover,
mutually threatening political groups' need to generate the military
power necessary for security under anarchy---the security dilemma, in
short---helps to explain the explosion of ferocious ethnonationalist and
sectarian conflict within and between the new states emerging from the
collapse of previously multiethnic communist federations, secular Middle
Eastern autocracies, and so forth.60 Such conflict has in turn forged
the identity of the states and state-like entities emerging from it. In
short, [while it is **certainly not impossible** for national identities
to shift]{.underline}, as noted above, [the **process** of their
generation nonetheless suggests that they are **endogenous** to---rather
than **readily capable of exogenously shifting** to
transform---international systemic security competition and
balance-of-power positioning]{.underline}, that they are as much a
dependent variable as an independent variable.

Uncertainty and the Menacing Shadow of the Future

The previous section outlined why some of the otherwise most convincing
[constructivist variables]{.underline} at work in international politics
nevertheless [**cannot promise** to transform international politics
away from a world of "**realist**," **security-motivated
balance-of-power positioning**]{.underline}. This section turns to
discuss why [this is something that social variables will **continue to
struggle with** as long as there is an international
system]{.underline}.

[The **principal barrier** to states ever setting aside their
inclination to guard against each other and instead embrace each other
as "friends"---**no matter how strong** their]{.underline} leaders' or
citizens' [desire to **transform the culture** of international
anarchy---is **uncertainty** over others' intentions]{.underline},
particularly their future intentions.61 Following the logic of the
prisoners' dilemma, a state62 that trusts that another means it no harm
while the other state concludes that it now has an opportunity to pursue
advantage may be punished severely for its complacency, rendering such
trust perilous, particularly in security affairs, where defection from
cooperation could result in the end of the "game" for one party.63

The meaning and implications of this "uncertainty" assumption merit
consideration, however. Human beings are constantly trying to impose
certainty on a contingent world via cognitive heuristics and neural
shortcuts, for the sake of their own mental well-being.64 Indeed, since
humans derive meaning and value from the self-imposed certainty of
ideational reinforcement, so too they can derive benefit from the
entrenchment of both amity with and enmity against "others," even when
this creates other complications and dangers.65 As a result, much of
international politics is influenced by habit, both the habit of
friendship and the habit of animosity.66 "Uncertainty" also means
different things to different people: for realists, it is a condition
from which to infer fear about others' possible behavior; for
constructivists, by contrast, it may simply refer to the inherent
indeterminacy of information until it is imbued with social content.67
It may be possible to build trust in others' benign intent over time and
thereby escape security competition, meanwhile, through their costly
signaling: forgoing capabilities and policy options that a potential
aggressor would not want to do without.68 States can also have the
certain "friendship" of those with whom they are balancing against a
third-party threat, and if that threat is long-lived, then so too may be
the certainty of alliance.69

Illustrating this "uncertainty about uncertainty,"70 consider one of the
highest profile oft-invoked security dilemmas: the Cold War escalation
of U.S.-Soviet hostility, during which the most seminal security dilemma
theorization took place.71 Robert Jervis---one of the concept's foremost
progenitors---subsequently questioned whether the Cold War can be
understood as a security dilemma after all, understood as a tragic cycle
of mutual threat between nonrevisionist security seekers driven by
uncertainty over the other's intentions. Neither side was "uncertain"
over whether the other was an adversary. And as subsequent archival
revelations document, each side did want to destroy the other, and
correctly inferred as much of its opponent.72

Jervis's "recantation" of the Cold War-as-security-dilemma is itself
bounded, however, and this bounding sheds light on the ways in which
varieties of uncertainty can still operate even between states with
"certain" mutual intent. "Greedy" states versus "security-seeking"
states are themselves binary ideal types that mask an underlying
spectrum. Practically all states are greedy, in terms of wanting to
improve their lot, if the costs are low enough.73 Conversely, few states
are greedy to the point of total unconcern for security; not even Nazi
Germany desired limitless global war. While there may not have been
uncertainty over each side's Cold War intent, therefore---enmity-driven
desire to defeat and ultimately destroy the other---there was still
uncertainty over underlying motivations. 74 A desire to exterminate an
enemy population may entail quite different behavior than a desire for
ideological supremacy, for example, and the two may therefore merit
different policy responses, even though both fall within the domain of
"hostile" intent. Such doubt over motivations---even within the
cognitively "certain" domain of U.S.-Soviet enmity---still added up to a
variety of security dilemma: [[the **most salient question**]{.mark} for
Americans [was not "**is the Soviet Union an enemy?**" bu]{.mark}t
rather "[**what might Moscow do** about situation X, in Y circumstances,
at time Z?"]{.mark} The same is evident]{.underline} in major power
politics [today. Washington is not "uncertain" over whether or not China
and Russia are its "adversaries,"]{.underline} defined in broad and
obvious terms, [but there is a **high degree of uncertainty** over what
**types** of rivals they represent and their **associated future
strategic choices**. Recognition of uncertainty's nonbinary
nature]{.underline}, in short, [**does not undermine** the argument that
states' inability to know others' future behavior with perfect
reliability **incentivizes them to worry** about possible future
dangers]{.underline}. Realists disagree over prospects for avoiding
security competition through signaling motivations, of course,75 but all
variants are united by recognizing the enduring significance of the
balance of material power.76

On top of these qualifications to the uncertainty-over-intentions
assumption come disagreements over the most appropriate response to such
uncertainty. [Conceding that we can never know another state's future
intentions with mathematical certainty, and therefore that the
worst-case outcome]{.underline}---surprise attack by a concealed
aggressor---[will always remain a hypothetical possibility **does
not**]{.underline} necessarily [**imply** that security is **maximized**
by treating such a scenario as **likely**]{.underline}. Provoking war
for fear of possible future war is like committing suicide for fear of
death, and given the balancing often generated by hostile behavior,
provoking others into uniting against oneself through attempted power
maximization can ultimately reduce one's security.77 [While worst-case
contingencies **always merit consideration**, [policy
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}---particularly decisions over how much of
the national resource base to devote to defense ("guns") versus
consumption and productive investment ("butter")78---[[**necessitates
probabilistic calculations** of]{.mark} the relative dangers of
**[overarmament]{.mark}**]{.underline} (provoking balancing alongside
domestic economic immiseration) [[versus
**underarmament**]{.underline}]{.mark} (attack by a better-armed
adversary).79 Intense security competition can therefore be an
irrational and self-defeating response to mere uncertainty over future
intentions, in the absence of other threat data.80 Both "realist" and
"constructivist" variables can feature among this threat data and
therefore play a crucial part in determining the optimal strategic
response to such intentions uncertainty, and that in turn conditions
whether the potential threat posed by each side's capabilities, be they
latent or realized, manifests itself as a security dilemma. For many
realists, the offense-defense balance of technology and geography
determines whether uncertainty over others' intentions merits military
confrontation and determines the (in)stability of states' strategic
relations.81 For constructivists, the solidarity/enmity borne of
sociocultural similarity/difference may be equally decisive.

But [**neither** of these observations---that uncertainty neither
carries a single meaning nor prescribes a single strategy---undermines
the **core claim** that survival has a **material base** that
necessitates **continual security-motivated concern** for one's position
in the balance of power. Survival may]{.underline} indeed [be
"**multiply realizable**,"]{.underline} with social/ideational variables
informing the path taken, alongside various "realist" variables.
[But]{.underline} given all [states']{.underline} need to safeguard a
materially based hierarchy of interests without wholesale reliance on
others' politically contingent (and therefore capricious)
benevolence---whether that be potential abandonment by erstwhile allies,
potential attack by erstwhile neutrals, or potential coercion by
either---their [position in the balance of power will **always remain
relevant** to their future security]{.underline}. And [given that
situation, the conditions for **mutual threat** and an associated
**security dilemma** to re-emerge are **unlikely to be permanently
expunged**]{.underline}, despite such a deterioration going unrealized
indefinitely in many cases due to other overlying factors.82 [Fear of
future conflict]{.underline}---at least against some state, if not
against any specific state---thus [remains an **endemic feature** of
international politics]{.underline}. And much of that is still down to
the enduring concerns of structurally based realism:
international-systemic anarchy, its absence of a reliable sovereign
enforcer of global peace, and the associated dangers of offensively
capable peers of unreliably benevolent intent.

Tellingly, while many contemporary states have achieved mutual
"friendship," they have rarely sustained it once the strategic factors
holding them together---such as alliance against a mutual threat, shared
membership of a great(er) power's dependency network, or some other
mutually beneficial exchange---have disappeared. This suggests that such
"friendship" is as much a dependent variable (an outcome of realist
balancing behavior) as an independent variable (a transformational force
in international politics).83 Even within the zone of friendship that
had come to characterize the European "community" by the late 1980s, for
example---probably the deepest case of intersubjective recognition,
cooperation, and sovereignty pooling to date---Britain and France still
worried intensely about the potential power imbalances created by German
reunification, and they were not content until reunified German power
was subordinated via a restated US commitment to NATO.84 As noted
previously, moreover, via both Trump and Brexit---ideationally motivated
shifts in foreign policy orientation85---Euro-Atlantic security
relations have recently displayed a dramatic backsliding, raising the
specter of alliance breakdown and coercive confrontation. The relative
power of all sides is critical to their ability to resist/dispense such
coercion and safeguard future security even in the possible absence of
alliance support. Even within the EU, the ability of members to resist
or dispense coercion comes down to relative power: witness Greece's
experience at German hands in the context of the Eurozone crisis, and
contrast it with the lack of sanction for Franco-German breaches of EU
rules.86 And between NATO and Russia, a 1990s moment of optimism over
developing friendship has retrenched to coercive confrontation as an
outcome of each other's choices.87 All these developments---which can be
interpreted as negative movement along the spectrum between cooperation
and conflict---illustrate the continuing centrality of relative power to
safeguarding a hierarchy of national interests without dependence on the
changeable commitments of others.

As a consequence, [[the **base conditions** for the security dilemma
will **always exist**]{.mark} between sovereign states under anarchy,
[even if it lies]{.mark}]{.underline} wholly
**[[dormant]{.underline}]{.mark}** for most states most of the time,
thanks to overlying factors. [Interstate [friendship does not]{.mark}
render deterioration to [a security dilemma **impossible**, and neither
does]{.mark} interstate [animosity **preclude**]{.mark}]{.underline}
stable and durable **[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.88 [So while
identity---which]{.underline} in any case [is "**sticky**" and **slow to
change**---certainly matters to security relations, it is **unlikely to
trump** some combination of **power** and **informational
variables**]{.underline}.89 Of course, if international relations were
transformed by the emergence of a single world-state, the system would
no longer be anarchic and the units-formerly-known-asstates would not
need to rely on relative power for their security, and thus such
competition would end.90 That requirement, however, does not look likely
to be fulfilled anytime soon.

Conclusion

[Conflict and cooperation is not some binary "**either/or**" condition,
but]{.underline} rather [a **spectrum**]{.underline}. So too the
[security concerns]{.underline} borne of uncertainty over motivations
[are not some irreversible "on/off" switch]{.underline}, be that
permanently severe or permanently solved. There is certainly far more
peace in the world than the most pessimistic readings of realism would
seem to imply,91 and ideational similarity and solidarity---as well as
the power and informational variables beloved of realists---clearly have
something to do with this. [[Interests]{.underline}]{.mark} within the
parameters of continuing to survive [[are **socially
constituted**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and even the route to survival
itself represents an ideationally informed choice. [[But]{.mark} the
need to safeguard [a]{.mark} **[material]{.mark}ly underpinned
[hierarchy of interests]{.mark}** if states are to continue to
exist]{.underline}---a necessary prerequisite to performing any kind of
social role---[still [incentivizes]{.mark} them to **value their
position** in the [balance of power as a
**safeguard**]{.mark}]{.underline} against future dangers. Of course,
[[states **can** and **do** disregard certain incentive
structures]{.mark} in favor of others]{.underline}.92 [[But until
**all** states]{.mark} are known to [have done so---a **high
bar**]{.mark} **indeed**---[the potential for security competition to
re-emerge]{.mark}]{.underline} in the international system
[[will]{.mark} **continue to [exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And knowing
that, states will continue to prize the capabilities to provide for
their own security . . . and so on, creating enduring conditions for
security dilemmas to one day reappear, even though they go overlain by
other factors in most international relationships most of the time.

Both realists and constructivists therefore have work to do, in terms of
both refining their paradigmatic cores and recognizing the necessity of
analytically eclectic cross-pollination [to explain many of the **most
pressing questions** of real-world international politics]{.underline}.
Realists must do more to incorporate identity as a variable that
produces systemically significant variation in behavior rather than as
some adjunct bolt-on, whether that be via the post-1990s boom of
neoclassical theorization or attempts at microfoundationally elaborated
structural realism.93 Porter's work on the interaction of power and
habit in determining US grand strategy is a good recent example,
while---as noted earlier---Snyder's Myths of Empire remains a key
benchmark.94 Constructivists, for their part, must continue to
investigate the relationship between states' potentially infinite array
of socially constituted interests, their materially underpinned
hierarchy of core survival requirements, and the enduring concern for
relative power that the latter generates. Along the way, [both sides
must be **circumspect** in their appeals to allegedly "**smoking-gun**"
examples]{.underline}. For realists to claim that structure alone
explains World War II or the Cold War, for example--- missing the
universalist ideologies of German Nazism, Soviet communism, or US
liberalism---would be a stretch indeed. Equally, constructivists' most
beloved examples---amicable US-Canadian relations along an easily
passable land border, the relative underarmament of Germany and Japan,
greater American fear of a few North Korean atomic bombs than hundreds
of British thermonuclear warheads, the rise of European Union, and so
forth---can all be readily explained with reference to balances of
capability and information. "Analytic eclecticism" is easy to profess,
but the most pressing contemporary questions of world politics require
that theorists practice it too.

[For those **not interested** in resolving **paradigm wars** or
"**isms**" debates]{.underline}, meanwhile, [the intersection of
**material-structural pressures** on state behavior with socially
constituted foreign policy preferences **provides ample scope** for
investigating **crucial real-world questions** of our time]{.underline}.
Viewed in rationalist terms, this might involve investigating the role
of social variables in informing leaders' utility functions, and thus
their preference orderings under the overall structural constraint of
needing to ensure continued survival. Just how far could the United
States meddle in the Middle East at the behest of domestic interests,
for example, before it critically harmed its power position vis-à-vis
China? Extending the previous point, has US unipolarity created unique
space for a "crazy" foreign policy that disregards the balance of
power---both by the United States itself and by close US allies---and
will this change if or when unipolarity wanes?95 Relatedly, just how far
can the likes of Germany and Japan sustain their pacifistic foreign
policy orientations in the face of US relative decline or disengagement
and the likely associated need for them to provide more for their own
security? Changing tack, how does a small power like Sweden---say---make
its trade-off between providing mobile forces for an EU Battlegroup (a
cause it values), on the one hand, and maintaining large amounts of
conscripts and armor on its eastern border to hedge against Russia (a
threat that it cannot be rid of), on the other? Are UK efforts to
rebrand as an "aid superpower" facilitated by a nuclear deterrent and
the US alliance, say, providing leeway to follow an ideational foreign
policy under the cover of a "good enough" military umbrella? In short,
[[there is scope for]{.mark} **any number** of midlevel
[theories]{.mark} of foreign policy [under the **constraint of**]{.mark}
**still [recognizing]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} interstate
[balance-of-power considerations]{.mark} **continue to
[structure]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} international
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Realism---2AC---Arctic

#### Realism is true for both [America]{.underline} and [Russia]{.underline} in the Arctic.

**Runesson, 24**---Master's Candidate in International Affairs, Linnaeus
University (Linn, "The Arctic: A Stage for Great Power Competition?,"
<https://lnu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1933832/FULLTEXT01.pdf>,
dml)

**[Continually]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [declares that
the]{.underline} "[strategy is rooted in]{.underline} our **[national
interests]{.underline}**: to protect the security of the American
people" and "to expand economic prosperity and opportunity" (The White
House 2022b: 7; USDD 2022: 1). Continuing down the line regarding
interests, [the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**ational
**[S]{.underline}**ecurity **[S]{.underline}**trategy states that the
United States is a "world power with global interests" and that in order
to advance American prosperity the state will work to shape the
international world order in order for it to [align with]{.underline}
the American interests and values (The White House 2022b: 11), which can
be related to the US [seeing the Arctic as a]{.underline} "[new
strategic theatre for **competition**]{.underline}" (Gricius 2021: 19).
Additionally, the US aspires to reduce risk and prevent unnecessary
escalation in the region, as well as protecting "freedom of navigation
and determine the US extended continental shelf in accordance with
international rules" (The White House 2022b: 45).

[National defence]{.underline}, [homeland security and safe commercial
and scientific activities are further listed as American Arctic
interests]{.underline} (The White House 2023: 6), [and]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**epartment **[o]{.underline}**f
**[D]{.underline}**efence [will]{.underline} "[**deter threats** to the
US homeland from and through the Arctic region]{.underline}" (USDD 2022:
16). This can be related to the fact that [the US has given the Arctic
region **more attention** in recent years]{.underline}, [especially in
relation to **Russian** military efforts in the region]{.underline} (Bye
2020: 82--83, 93). [The]{.underline} United States' desired outcomes in
the Arctic region are to preserve its navigational rights and freedoms
in Arctic waters, monitor threats to the freedom of navigation and to
protect the global mobility of the US and its allies and partner forces
(USDD 2024: 16), [security interests have been **prominent** in American
Arctic strategies since the **Bush** administration]{.underline} in 2009
(Bye 2020: 86).

[When looking at the different Arctic]{.underline} aspirations,
[intentions]{.underline} and interests [of Russia and the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [one can **quickly
detect** several similarities in their]{.underline} 34 (63) respective
[strategies]{.underline}. [Both state that they seek to]{.underline}
preserve stability in the region, [increase **national
defence**]{.underline}, [ensure their Arctic **territorial sovereignty**
and **military security**]{.underline}, [as well as **economic
interests**]{.underline} relating to regional economic development and
navigational rights in connection to the Northern Sea Route and Arctic
waters. [Both states also declare that they intend to maintain their
status as **great powers** in the region]{.underline}. There are however
a few differences, where Russia for example aspires to stop the
delimitation of its continental shelf and has more specific economic
interests concerning natural resources in the region. United States on
the other hand focuses more on expanding economic opportunities, working
for more Arctic cooperation with the Arctic Council and to defend global
mobility in the region.

What [**all** of the strategies]{.underline} have in common is
nevertheless that they all seemingly [stem from the **neorealist**
perspective of **structural anarchy**]{.underline}. This means that the
Arctic aspirations, intentions and interests of Russia the United States
all can be interpreted as [goals]{.underline} that [are centred
around]{.underline} the concept of [**self-help** that will help the
states **survive** in the international system]{.underline}, [as there
is **no central authority** that rules over the system]{.underline}
(Smith 2021: 16--17). One can also argue that [the different aspirations
are not only motivated by a desire of **survival** and
**self-preservation**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} that [one can
detect a desire to **dominate** the region as both states refer to
themselves as great powers]{.underline} that defends the rights that
they think they are entitled to (Waltz 1979: 91, 118). [This also aligns
with the neorealist perspective that great powers often are concerned
with **ensuring their own security** for themselves]{.underline}, as
there is not higher authority that can work to protect them, which one
could say is reflected in that both Russia and the United States are
concerned with self-preserving interests such as economic opportunities
and national defence in the region (Parent & Rosato 2015: 52). It is
also clear that their respective identities, especially in regards to
being recognised as great powers, play a vital part in shaping their
Arctic interests, policies and strategies (Hopf 1998: 175, 198).

### Reps Not First---2AC

#### Reps don't determine policy outcomes.

**Mortensgaard, 20**---Research Assistant at the Centre for Military
Studies, University of Copenhagen (Lin Alexandra, "Contesting Frames and
(De)Securitizing Schemas: Bridging the Copenhagen School\'s Framework
and Framing Theory," International Studies Review, Volume 22, Issue 1,
March 2020, Pages 140--166, dml)

In reality [frames are **rarely clear-cut**.
[Frames]{.mark}]{.underline} in the media [[are often
**incomplete**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as [[they may define the
problematic effect]{.mark}/condition [in **one way** but endorse
**another**]{.mark} **type** of
[remedy]{.mark}/improvement]{.underline}.21 Additionally, news [items
[may contain **multiple**]{.mark} complete or incomplete
[frames]{.mark}]{.underline} (Steensland 2008). This means that [the
frame contest takes place [not only **between**]{.mark}]{.underline}
news [[items but]{.mark} also **[within a single]{.mark}**]{.underline}
news [[item]{.underline}]{.mark}. This, however, does not mean that one
frame cannot dominate the single news item, the particular media outlet,
or the media at large. It just means that [when analyzing]{.underline}
media sources, [we must [be careful **not to look for one complete
frame**]{.mark} contesting another complete frame]{.underline}.22

### Threats Real---2AC

#### The more we avoid debates over conventional security threats, the more terrain we cede to the real imperialists.

**Wertheim, 22**---Senior Fellow in the American Statecraft Program at
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (Stephen, "Responses to
Aziz Rana," Dissent, Volume 69, Number 3, Summer 2022, pp. 27-42, dml)

[Some discussions of left or progressive foreign
policy]{.underline}---Rana's not included---[dance around issues
of]{.underline} "**[hard]{.underline}**" political-military
**[power]{.underline}**, on the premise that more profound human
challenges pertain, say, to econom- ics, race, or the environment. [Even
if the premise were true]{.underline}, [the conclusion **would not
follow**]{.underline}. [By **avoiding conventionally defined security
questions**]{.underline}, [the left **cedes this terrain** to the
establishment]{.underline}, [which has made **global military
dominance** into the foremost priority of U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline}, [overriding all other goals]{.underline}. In this
context, [Americans who support global dominance]{.underline} are not
necessarily wrong to put a premium on security. They [need to hear how a
**different approach** will make them safer]{.underline}.

### AT: Arctic Reps Links/Arctic Realism Bad

#### Their links [invert the error]{.underline} by [marginalizing]{.underline} traditional security issues in the Arctic.

**Lackenbauer and Dean, 20**---Professor in the School for the Study of
Canada at Trent University; PhD Candidate in the Department of Political
Science at the University of Calgary (P. Whitney and Ryan, "Arctic
Exceptionalisms," *The Arctic and World Order*, Chapter 14, 331, dml)

In a tidy definition, Michael T. Bravo describes Arctic exceptionalism
as [scholars]{.underline} [treat]{.underline}ing [the
Arctic]{.underline} "[as a regional security complex with its
**own**]{.underline}, **[independent]{.underline}**, [political calculus
that is **poorly explained** by conventional realist
theories]{.underline} of international relations."17 The nature of
[this]{.underline} security complex **[remains open to
debate]{.underline}**. Exner-Pirot suggests that "the Arctic is
exceptional in that the environmental sector dominates circumpolar
relations," making it, in effect, a regional environmental security
complex.18 [By **marginalizing** traditional military and security
issues]{.underline}, the Arctic exceptionalism embedded in [these
articulations of an Arctic security complex]{.underline} also [**creates
vulnerability** in suggesting that the reintroduction of defence
considerations **inherently undermines them**]{.underline}. Furthermore,
[by **prescribing**]{.underline} that the logic of exceptionalism points
to [a certain type of regime]{.underline} predicated on liberal
institutionalism, [we might **overlook** different]{.underline} ways
that other commentators---rooted in other schools of thought---also
identify "exceptional" characteristics to justify or explain [national
behaviour and regional dynamics]{.underline}.

### AT: Endless War/Interventions

#### No [endless war or racial violence]{.underline}\-\--US has and will exercise [massive restraint]{.underline}.

**Mazarr '20** \[Michael; 2020; Ph.D. from the University of Maryland,
M.A. in Security Studies from Georgetown, senior political scientist at
the RAND Corporation; Washington Quarterly, "Rethinking Restraint: Why
It Fails in Practice," 43(2), pp. 7--32,
https://doi.org/10.1080/0163660X.2020.1771042\]

The [restraint [literature downplays the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[often-powerful [reluctance]{.mark}]{.underline}** [with
which]{.underline} successive [US administrations have grappled with
**most decisions** [to **intervene**]{.mark}]{.underline}. US [action
in]{.underline} cases like [the [Balkan]{.mark}]{.underline} wars
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[Libya]{.mark} only [came with]{.mark}
**great [hesitancy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and after fierce internal
debates.8 [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has [[shunned **many**]{.mark}
**opportunities**]{.underline} [for large-scale [interventions]{.mark}
in the last generation alone]{.underline}---in [[Somalia, Rwanda,
Syria]{.mark}, and elsewhere]{.underline}.9 US administrations did not
act in crises in [the Great Lakes region of [Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}
and two major examples of Russian aggression in [[Georgia]{.mark} and
[Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline}10 An infamous case of non-intervention
was the [[Darfur]{.underline}]{.mark} tragedy in the Sudan, when
credible accusations of genocide did not prompt US action.11 The United
States would never have invaded either Afghanistan or Iraq had it not
been for 9/11; indeed, then-NSC official Richard Clarke and others
begged two administrations to strike al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan for
months beforehand, to no avail.12 [In regard to humanitarian
intervention]{.underline} broadly speaking, [the
**[selectivity]{.mark}** of US action, [**rather** than a general
**impulse** to intervene]{.mark}, is the **dominant
lesson.**]{.underline}13

[Even with regard to Vietnam]{.underline}, two US presidents ([Kennedy
and Eisenhower]{.underline}) [struggled to avoid an open-ended US
commitment]{.underline}; when the United States did engage, it was
because Lyndon [Johnson]{.underline} felt a need to stand up to
communist aggression and protect his personal reputation, but he [was
hardly enthusiastic]{.underline} about the prospect. He was painfully
conflicted about the war and deeply regretted having to fight it.14 In
other words, [when US [interventionism]{.mark}]{.underline} [has
occurred]{.underline}, [it [has]{.mark} often [been **reactive**]{.mark}
**and halfhearted**]{.underline} [[rather than
**aggressive**]{.mark}**ly ambitious**.]{.underline} In fact, [the
**alleged epicenter** of US global military power]{.underline}---[[the
D]{.underline}]{.mark}epartment [[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f
[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}efense and the military services---have
**[forcefully [opposed]{.mark}]{.underline}** many
[[interventions]{.mark} in]{.underline} places like [the Balkans,
Somalia, and Libya]{.underline}, believing they should husband their
power for major wars. The two leading modern conceptual articulations of
criteria for going to war---the Weinberger and Powell Doctrines---came
from senior defense officials, and both represented efforts to
constrain, not liberate, the use of force.15 Former Secretary of Defense
Robert [Gates told]{.underline} a graduating class at [West
Point]{.underline} that ["any]{.underline} future [defense secretary who
advises]{.underline} the president to again send [a big American land
army into Asia or]{.underline} into [the Middle East]{.underline} [or
Africa should 'have his head examined,']{.underline} as General
MacArthur so delicately put it," 16 [reflecting a **widely held** view
at Defense]{.underline}---[one **far afield from the ideas of
unrestrained primacy.**]{.underline} [A similar **[impulse for
limits]{.mark}** has emerged [in major diplomatic
initiatives]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a recent essay outlining a
restraint agenda, Stephen Wertheim suggests that the United States
should "seek to normalize relations with North Korea" in part with a
nuclear deal, and that it should "end its grudge match" with Iran.17

In fact, the United States at one time embraced both these ideas in the
form of the Agreed Framework with North Korea and the Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran. The later US desertion
of these accords was prompted by hawkish factions in two Republican
administrations, not an indiscriminate national hegemonic inclination.18
[Nor can US involvement in foreign wars and interventions usually be
traced to a **hegemonic desire to spread liberal values**]{.underline}.
[A missionary attitude]{.underline} in foreign policy and liberal value
promotion agenda may help lay the groundwork or justify the public case
for unnecessary commitments and [may be responsible for a few of them.
But the **[largest interventions]{.mark}**]{.underline}---Korea,
Vietnam, the Gulf War, the Balkan wars, Afghanistan, and Iraq---[were
all]{.underline} primarily [motivated **by security**
considerations]{.underline}.19 Some of these actions may have been
excessive to begin with or become so over time, and the security
concerns that drove them may have been based on bad information or
inflated fears. But [they [were **not** fueled by]{.mark} the boundless
[commitment to **primacy**]{.mark} **and liberal value promotion**
described by many advocates of restraint]{.underline}.

### AT: Liberalism Bad

#### Liberal norms of law and sovereignty [reduce international conflict]{.underline}.

**Gill-Tiney, 22**---Lecturer, Department of Politics and International
Relations, University of Oxford (Patrick, "A Liberal Peace?: The Growth
of Liberal Norms and the Decline of Interstate Violence," Journal of
Conflict Resolution, 2022, Vol. 66(3), 413--442, dml)

This article shows that [[liberal]{.mark} interpretations of
**[sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which [emphasize]{.mark}
**[i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[free
[trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[democracy]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**individual [rights]{.mark}** and **freedoms**]{.underline}, [have
become **increasingly prevalent**]{.underline} in UN Security Council
resolutions since 1970. Given that two non-western states, Russia/Soviet
Union and China, are permanent members, I argue that the content of
these resolutions reflects broad consensus between major powers---both
western and non-western---as how these norms should be interpreted. This
is not the same as arguing that these states share preferences or
interests, rather, substantial differences remain, largely along the
cleavage between the United States, Britain and France on the one hand
and China and Russia on the other (Einsiedel and Malone 2018, 156-58).1
Yet, the collective positions of these states have evolved over time,
suggesting a shift in how sovereignty is understood. The dominant role
that these states have in shaping the international order means that
[their collective understandings may be taken as representative of the
**normative structure** of international society at any point in
time]{.underline}, [with the expectation that this impacts **all**
states in the system]{.underline}.2

I argue that [[as liberal]{.mark} interpretations of these fundamental
[norms **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the **likelihood
of**]{.underline}]{.mark} a dispute participant resorting to
**[[violence decreases]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Through content analysis
of all UN Security Council resolutions between 1970 and 2014 I first
create a measure of the strength of liberal interpretations of
sovereignty. This is then utilized in quantitative analysis of dispute
participants in the period to explain the variation in the level of
violence employed. [I find **statistical** and **substantive support**
for my theory]{.underline}, [showing **[empirically]{.mark}** that [the
growth]{.mark} in liberal norm interpretations [is **negatively
associated**]{.mark} with the likelihood of]{.underline} a state
resorting to [violence]{.underline} in an interstate dispute.

[This is [not]{.mark} to argue [that structural]{.mark}
[arg]{.mark}ument[s]{.mark} [are **wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}, far
from it, [nor is it to **reject** the roles of conventional and nuclear
capabilities]{.underline} in shaping interstate conflict behavior.
[[Rather]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[state power does
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is why the collective
interpretations of the permanent members of the UN Security Council are
used to understand the system. Domestic veto players, intergovernmental
enforcement mechanisms, and trade dependency all do shape the responses
of policymakers during an interstate dispute. However, [the
**intersubjective ideas** they carry with them into disputes
are]{.underline} also [**crucial** to understand why some disputes
**escalate**]{.underline}, [and others do **not**]{.underline}.

This article contributes to our understanding of the role that ideas
have in shaping interstate conflict in two ways. Firstly, I contribute
to the large literature which has sought to understand the role which
norms play in selecting for certain behaviors over others. Most of the
work within this area has been qualitative and has either charted the
development of specific bundles of norms over long periods (Keene 2012,
2013; Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999; Sandholtz 2007) or focused on the
life-cycle of specific norms (Eckstein 1988; Finnemore 2000; Finnemore
and Sikkink 1998; Krook and True 2012; Nadelmann 1990; Sandholtz 2007;
Sandholtz and Stiles 2008). I build upon these insights by arguing that
the norm of sovereignty has been re-interpreted over time, and that the
collective nature of reinterpretation means that it can be used to
examine its impact in interstate conflict.

Secondly, this article provides an innovative means of exploring ideas
in a quantitative framework. The quantitative interstate conflict
literature has heavily favored structural and power-based explanations
for actor behavior. This has come at the particular expense of norms.
Whilst there is widespread acceptance that norms matter amongst these
scholars, they have tended to set aside norm-based explanations given
the difficulty of objective measurement. This difficulty revolves around
the problem of having surety that multiple actors share an idea, that
is, intersubjective understanding. The most obvious sources of data to
assess this would be a survey of policymakers or the content of
international legal documents. This first avenue is incredibly difficult
to gain anything but anecdotal responses too. Policymakers are hard to
get access to and may misrepresent their own thoughts and actions to
show themselves in as best light as possible. Ensuring that any
respondents have understood the survey in the same way is difficult
given language differences, whilst response rates are likely to be so
low as to prevent a non-random sample from being acquired, even if the
potential pool of relevant participants is widened to include all senior
politicians and bureaucrats, both incumbent and preceding.

Some of these problems are resolved by utilizing the texts of
international legal documents. Given that these are generally carefully
and cautiously written the researcher is more certain that the drafters
actually share an understanding of the topic. Recent work by Allee and
co-authors (Allee, Elsig, and Lugg 2017; Allee and Lugg 2016) have
innovatively utilized content analysis of interstate trade deals to
explore how much is replicated in subsequent deals, which sheds light on
the relative power of the participants. This has certainly gained deeper
understanding of the topic, but is not a suitable approach for this
research questions for two reasons. Firstly, these deals are generally
drafted by small numbers of states, that is, they may not be assumed to
represent the preferences and interests of nonparties. Secondly, whilst
interpretations are spelled out, these may be mechanistic rather than
ideational, making it unclear what the broader normative position may
be. This is made more acute by the drafting being down by bureaucrats
and lawyers rather than policymakers themselves. Whilst some direction
is no-doubt given by the latter, assuming a high level is problematic.
Utilizing the content of UN Security Council resolutions addresses these
problems because the documents may be assumed to be political, that is,
though member states are represented by ambassadors, a high-level of
involvement by their state governments is typical given the importance
attached to security issues. Moreover, since the permanent membership is
diverse in interests and preferences, and these members can veto
unpalatable resolutions, they may be reasonably assumed to provide
insight into intersubjective understandings.

Existing Explanations of Interstate Conflict and the Role of Norms

Two existing literatures are built on here, firstly, the broad
democratic peace literature, including its offshoots and opponents, and
secondly, scholarship on the evolution of international norms. The
former literature initially focused upon regime type, and over time has
been widened to include more fine-grained analyses of domestic political
structures in any state (Bell and Quek 2018; Fearon 1994; Gries et al.
2020; Huth and Allee 2002; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020; Weeks 2012;
Weiss 2013; Weiss and Dafoe 2019). However, the approach in all of these
works is to examine structures, that is, formal institutional
constraints encountered by decision makers, rather than norms, that is,
the role of shared principles, perceptions and expectations of behavior.
The distinction between norms and structure is not rigid. This is most
clearly seen in the term "institution" which is commonly used to mean
both formal structures which limit the agency of decision makers, but
also a set of norms, rules, and practices which govern a specific area.
To clarify the distinction being made in this article, I adapt the
nomenclature used by Reus-Smit (1999) who distinguishes between
constitutional institutions, norms without which a society of states
could not exist, and fundamental institutions, which facilitate
cooperation. The former includes sovereignty, as well as the rights of
self-determination and nonintervention, and the latter contractual
international law and the organizations which enforce it (both internal
and external to states). In this article, I term the former "norms" and
the latter "structures."

The democratic peace literature has spurred several offshoots, the most
relevant of which are those which have argued that rather than regime
type the "peace" is generated by economic factors including trade
interdependency and level of development (Gartzke 2007; Hegre 2000; Kim
2014; Kinne 2012; McDonald 2009, 2010; Mousseau 2013; Schneider and
Gleditsch 2010) or shared intergovernmental organization membership
(Appel 2018; Kinne 2013a, 2013b; Prorok and Appel 2014). More general
critiques have argued that any effect seen is due to the prior
settlement of territorial disputes (Gibler 2012; Gibler and Tir 2014;
Owsiak 2012), nuclear weapons (Waltz 1990), alliances (Kydd 2005),
unipolarity (Monteiro 2014) or military power (Layne 1994; Rosato 2003)
instead. With the exception of the latter critiques, this debate has
broadly accepted the importance of norms (Doyle 1986; Moravcsik 1997;
Owen 1994; Russett and Oneal 2001), especially as the "good" functioning
of domestic and international structures, particularly veto players,
requires political actors to have the right norms.

This relationship between norms and structures has been more closely
addressed through the focus on contracts, that is, to hone in on
specific economic norms and structures characterized as allowing an
economic market to function "with extensive and regularized transactions
among strangers that require an element of trust" (Mousseau and Xiongwei
2018, sec. Emergence Contractualist Peace). This literature argues that
the relationship between peace and democracy is spurious, and rather,
that both are explained by "contracturalist" norms and structures (Gelpi
and Grieco 2008; Mousseau, Hegre, and O'Neal 2003), which builds upon
the work of (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Dahl 1997; North, Wallis, and
Weingast 2009). Yet, the literature still relies upon
operationalizations which are essentially structural, that is, whilst
recognizing the importance of norms, the empirical testing has fallen
short.

A comparatively small subset of the literature has examined norms as an
explanation for the democratic peace. For Deutsch (1957), though NATO is
understood as a structure, a security community is more crucially formed
around shared values (norms). Kahl argues that the basis of the
democratic peace is collective identity rooted in liberal democracy
interlinked by intergovernmental organizations (1998). For Risse, the
influence of NATO allies upon the foreign policy of the United States
demonstrates the importance of liberal norms, through a mechanism which
relies upon the similarity of domestic political institutions in these
liberal democracies and coalition-building (1995). Though valuable
additions to the literature, and in Deutsch's case systematic in its
treatment of the subject, these works fail to tackle the question of
whether the democratic peace is structural or norm based since the two
are entwined throughout. The difficulty in conceptualizing, isolating
and operationalizing norms is a clear problem. Broadly, it is hard to
isolate a norm from either the structure in which it exists or from
other norms for analysis. It is also a challenge to show that any norm
is truly intersubjective in understanding or to measure its effect upon
some outcome of interest. Yet, without attempts to do so we are left
with a partial picture, particularly for those emphasizing the
importance of structures---be these domestic or international---for
reducing interstate conflict. In short, the existence of a domestic
legislature, independent judiciary, or interstate treaties, is only
relevant if the individuals which employ them do so appropriately. To
understand this necessitates exploring the ideas in the heads of these
individuals, and particularly, how these ideas are shared.

In contrast to the large, predominantly quantitative, literature which
has examined the democratic peace and wider questions linking regime
type to the onset, conduct and termination of interstate disputes and
wars, the broader literature on interstate norms has tended to be
qualitative and highly focused. This has resulted in detailed work on
human rights (Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999), humanitarian intervention
(Wheeler 2000), and nuclear weapons (Rublee and Cohen 2018; Tannenwald
1999). There is no doubt that this has contributed to our understanding
of interstate relations, yet the clear shortcoming is generalizability.
That is, the specificity of these approaches, necessary to make any form
of causal claim, is in a sense also the undoing.

In this article I focus on the reinterpretation of the sovereignty norm
by powerful states. I argue that they have a dominant role in shaping
the normative landscape of the international system by being tasked with
the interpretation of norms and the maintenance of international society
(Hurrell 2007; Wight 1978; Saunders 2006). Operationalizing this, I
utilize UN Security Council resolutions as a means of assessing what the
consensus position of the permanent members is. Content analysis is used
to examine the normative framing of resolutions, allowing both an
exploration of change over time, and quantitative measures of the
relative strength of these ideas to be derived which can then be used in
regression analysis.

The Constraining Effect of Liberal Interpretations of Sovereignty

Norms are dynamic, and undergo processes of evolution, creation and
destruction. Change may occur gradually as actors shift their
understandings towards an alternative, or suddenly through systemic, and
thereby social, change. In international relations, the latter is
tightly linked to sudden shifts in great power authority, which has
typically occurred due to defeat and a subsequent realignment of
international order. War, and its aftermath, can lead to substantial
rearrangements of international order, meaning both a new distribution
of power, but also a re-interpretation of international society. In
examining change in understandings of sovereignty I term gradual change
"evolution" and sudden change "tectonic."

Interpretations of Sovereignty

The post-World War Two era allows examination of both evolutionary and
tectonic change in understandings of sovereignty. Evolution occurs
during relative peace, whilst tectonic change is part of major
realignments of international order. The end of the Cold War, though
non-violent certainly led to significant power shifts, resulting in a
tectonic change. The pre- and post-Cold War eras are eras of evolution.
Assessing rivalrous interpretation of norms is crucial to understanding
these changes. I outline a divergence between traditional and liberal
interpretations which are used to examine change in norms, and the
effect upon international conflict.

Over the post-World War Two period two interpretations of sovereignty
have existed, firstly, that emphasizing territorial sovereignty and
non-interference in the domestic affairs of others, and secondly, that
emphasizing international law, interdependence, free trade, democracy
and individual rights and freedoms in international affairs. I term the
former approach to sovereignty "traditional," and the latter "liberal."
A liberal interpretation of sovereignty, therefore, is one which places
emphasis upon the actions of states, particularly those between a
government and its citizens. Sovereignty in this understanding implies
not only the exercise of power over a territory and people (as in the
traditional understanding), but also that there are limits to the
exercise of power and duties to a people (Sandholtz and Stiles 2008,
287-88).3 This has been most clearly stated in the Responsibility to
Protect doctrine. I examine the relative balance between these two
interpretations over time, arguing that this balance alters how
sovereignty is understood, and thereby is related to the likelihood of
escalation in interstate disputes.

My expectation is that the relative balance between these two modes of
interpretation has shifted over the post-World War Two period to favor a
liberal interpretation. This does not mean that traditional
interpretations are irrelevant, rather, that they have been
de-emphasized in international discourse relative to the latter. A
spectrum in which purely traditional and purely liberal interpretations
mark the poles is conceived of as existing, with great powers occupying
positions between the two. The effect that this shift toward a liberal
interpretation of sovereignty has occurred on international conflict
escalation is now examined.

Understandings of Sovereignty and Conflict Escalation

How understandings of sovereignty impact international disputes may be
explored in terms of the conflict life-cycle, that is, why a dispute
emerges, why violent conflict breaks out, and how the conflict ends, or
in terms of participant conduct during war. Here, I examine the effect
of change in the collective understanding of sovereignty upon
escalation, meaning that I assume the prior existence of international
disputes. Whilst the effect of norms upon the onset of disputes is an
important question, very few disputes result in the use of violence,
that is, though onset is a necessary condition for violence, it is far
from sufficient. I examine escalation from a nonviolent dispute to a
violent dispute---the use of armed force in international
relations---because this is of greater substantive significance to state
leaders and their citizens. Moreover, whilst reducing the likelihood of
dispute onset would likely result in less international violence, [the
more normatively important question is how to avoid
**escalation**]{.underline}, [as this **reduces the costs** of
war]{.underline}: human death and economic destruction.

This is not to trivialize dispute onset, and logically we might expect
the growth of liberal understandings of sovereignty to also reduce onset
rates as well as escalation likelihood. However, there are two reasons
why we may doubt the substantive significance of this, firstly, dispute
onset is a relatively low threshold, and secondly, onset is often
triggered by events beyond the direct control of a state. To this first
point, a dispute simply means that two or more actors disagree over
something, oftentimes the behavior of the other side or the distribution
of some good (for instance, territory). This article utilizes
Militarized Interstate Disputes as the operationalization of dispute,
and many disputes are comparatively minor events, with the threshold
being that one of the two parties has a minimum level of militarization
as part of the dispute (for example, the issuance of a deterrent, or
compellent, threat). A focus on onset, therefore, would prevent
observation of substantively more important actions, that is, the actual
use of force against another. Secondly, many disputes begin due to
accident and/or the decision making of low-level military commanders or
political officials who are neither in the position to consider national
interests nor strategic interactions. This means that onset may
essentially be an apolitical decision which takes little or no account
of the broader strategic landscape nor the structural and normative
context. It is after onset, that is, when escalation is considered by
policymakers, that the stakes are higher and when causal mechanisms
common to this topic are most active.

[Escalation]{.underline} then, [is a **political**
decision]{.underline}. In making the choice to escalate, or not,
[policymakers are]{.underline} impacted by a range of strategic factors,
but crucially, are also [constrained by **norms**]{.underline}. [The
[use of force]{.mark} in international relations [must be
**justified**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and since 1945 the UN Charter
specifies just two: self-defense and collective peace enforcement. To
this, we might also add humanitarian intervention, though this remains
contested. As a baseline, therefore, when faced with dispute onset,
policymakers must justify their actions with reference to one of these
reasons. Moreover, [[in making the **decision to
escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[policymakers are]{.mark} also
**[constrained by liberal values]{.mark}** which emphasize
diplomacy]{.underline}, [cooperation]{.underline}, [international
law]{.underline}, [international organizations]{.underline}, [the rights
of the individual]{.underline}, [and to question the legitimacy of the
march to war]{.underline}. Taken [together]{.underline}, [[this **slows
the decision to escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[since legal
justification is **needed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[diplomacy is
**necessary**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and potential]{.mark} economic and
human costs **[understood]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**calculated** and
**defended**]{.underline}. [A shift toward liberal interpretations
thereby means a **reduced probability of escalation** to
violence]{.underline}, tacitly assuming that the risk of a dispute
arising in the first-place is unchanged. This leads me to my first
hypothesis, which relates to the evolution mechanism of change:

Hypothesis 1: [Given an international dispute]{.underline}, [the risk of
escalation **decreases** as liberal interpretations
**increase**]{.underline}.

An alternative explanation is that any impact of normative change is
actually a result of the end of the Cold War, that is, the
redistribution of power between great powers, typically resulting from
system-wide conflict results in qualitative differences in
interpretations of fundamental norms between peace-periods. Whilst the
end of the Cold War did not involve a system-wide war, it did mark the
end of sustained rivalry between great powers. The pre- and post-
periods can thereby be compared. Given the rivalry of the United States
and Soviet Union during the Cold War, and the relative dominance of the
United States post-Cold War, we might expect qualitative differences in
conflict behavior to be observable in the two time periods,
attributable, perhaps, to a greater emphasis upon liberal
interpretations in the post-Cold War era. The dramatic change in the
distribution of power triggered a significant change in the consensus
surrounding interpretation of fundamental norms of international
society. This leads me to my second hypothesis, which captures the
tectonic change mechanism:

Hypothesis 2: [The risk of dispute escalation decreases given a systemic
increase in **liberal interpretations of sovereignty**]{.underline}
attributable to the end of the Cold War.

Method

I use multiple logistic regression to estimate the effect of change in
the normative landscape on the use of force by dispute participants. To
address the underlying selection problem, that is, that dispute onset is
non-random, I also estimate maximum likelihood and twostep Heckman
selection models. Substantive significance from the logistic regression
is then explored utilizing the observed values for predicted
probabilities approach (Hanmer and Ozan Kalkan 2013). Standard errors
are robust and clustered by year, where model specification allows (that
is, not in the Heckman twostep model). This is to take account of the
data structure since years differ by the number of Militarized
Interstate Disputes (MIDs) which onset and the number of participants in
these MIDs. Because the independent variables are annual values, the
same value is given to all dispute participants in the same year. If
standard errors were not clustered by year then there would be
substantial withincluster correlation.

[This]{.underline} paper [models]{.underline} the hostility level of
interstate [disputes as a **monadic** phenomenon]{.underline}. [Much of
the literature]{.underline} on democratic peace theory [utilizes a
**dyadic** setup]{.underline}, either directed or undirected. I opt for
a monadic structure for three reasons, firstly, because [many of the
theoretical explanations for the democratic peace are]{.underline} in
essence, **[monadic]{.underline}** explanations, with a dyadic version
layered on top. For instance, the core claim of much of the literature
is that democracy reduces the hostility of foreign policy, a monadic
claim, because leaders are accountable to citizens who have a low
tolerance for the costs or war, and because legislatures and a free and
independent media provides greater scrutiny of policymaking, slowing the
march to war. The dyadic version of this---the interaction of joint
democracy---relies on the signals that these same processes provide to
another actor. It is puzzling, therefore, that empirical findings have
tended to show support for the latter, but not for the former. Secondly,
[the **difficulty** in finding empirical support for any monadic
explanation means that [a **higher threshold** is]{.mark} being
[set]{.mark} here [by]{.mark} using [a monadic
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thirdly, the argument I make, that
liberal norms reduces the hostility level of interstate disputes, may
have varying effects according to the regime type of dyads. However,
that claim is not made here, rather I argue that these norms exist for
all in international society, not for a subset, and that they act
directly upon policymakers, not only when policymakers interact with
their international counterparts.

### AT: Neorealism Wrong

#### Neorealism's [true]{.underline} in the Arctic.

**Stojkovic, 21**---M.A. Candidate, Governance and Public Policy,
Universität Passau (Dominik, "The Race for the Arctic: A Neorealist Case
Study of Russia and the United States,"
<https://www.e-ir.info/2021/05/17/the-race-for-the-arctic-a-neorealist-case-study-of-russia-and-the-united-states/>,
dml)

[Neorealism]{.underline}, as discussed, [predicts that states will
attempt to **maximize security** by using military power]{.underline}.
Therefore, they may pursue several strategies, including power
projection, increasing economic capabilities, and seeking alliances. To
pursue security in a self-help system, Moscow and Washington should
increase military and latent power to, ultimately, reach regional
hegemony. The brief case study shows that, [following the]{.underline}
largest [retreat of sea ice]{.underline} in 2007 ('the shock'), [Russia
began **increasing its Arctic activity** by claiming
resource-rich]{.underline} ([e.g.]{.underline}, **[Lomonosov
ridge]{.underline}**) [and strategically significant]{.underline}
([e.g.]{.underline}, [the **NSR**]{.underline}) [territory to boost its
national power]{.underline}. Besides, [it increased its partnership with
**China** and focused on **infrastructure development** to raise
economic performance]{.underline}.

As noted in Chapter I, Mearsheimer believes that all great powers strive
to accumulate power over rivals, with the ultimate goal of hegemony (cf.
Mearsheimer 2001, p. 40). While [the US]{.underline} is the most
powerful state in the system, it [**cannot dominate** the
**world**]{.underline}. Due to its minor role [in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}, [it motivates other states to increase their
power to secure their position in the system]{.underline}. With
Washington largely absent from the Arctic, Russia expanded its economic
investment and military activity, becoming the regional hegemon as
defined by Mearsheimer (2001, p. 232).

[Neorealism differentiates **latent** and **military**
power]{.underline} (cf. Keohane 1984, p. 55). [When calculated in
**both** terms]{.underline}, [the **balance of power** between Russia
and other Arctic states **drastically favors** Russia]{.underline}. With
the largest Arctic territory and population, [it generates a
**significant amount** of its latent power in this resource-rich
area]{.underline}. [This allows it to operate the largest fleet of
**icebreakers**]{.underline}, [Arctic **military bases**]{.underline},
[and **troops**]{.underline}. [In these **quantitative**
terms]{.underline}, [the power structure in the Arctic is
**clear**]{.underline}: [Russia is a **great power** in the High
North]{.underline}, [and the US]{.underline}, with only one functioning
icebreaker and not a single independent Arctic military base, [is
**not**]{.underline}.

[This has **substantial implications** for the Arctic
region]{.underline}. Mearsheimer states that [if the structure is
**multi-polar** and **unbalanced**]{.underline}, [it will be **much more
prone** to **conflict** since regional powers seek
dominance]{.underline}. Other states may then seek alliances (cf.
Mearsheimer 2001, p. 344). [This is where]{.underline} Walt's **[balance
of threat]{.underline}** approach [becomes a **useful analytical
tool**]{.underline}. In predicting the formation of alliances between
states, Walt (1987, pp. 21-22) defines threat perception as a crucial
determinant. The threat --in this structure-- comes from Moscow. [As a
**reaction** to Russian power projections and military
build-up]{.underline}, [neorealism would expect smaller powers to
**pursue security** by bandwagoning with Washington]{.underline}.

[This can be observed in **several collaborations**]{.underline}: [while
**Canada**]{.underline}, **[Denmark]{.underline}**, [and **Norway** have
collectively increased their Arctic military activity in partnership
with the US through **NATO**]{.underline}, [**Finland** and **Sweden**
are conducting regular Arctic military training with Norway and the
US]{.underline} (cf. Hultqvist 2020). Eventually, [**Denmark** and
**Iceland** grant US military presence on their territories]{.underline}
in Keflavik and Thule.

Finally, [although the Arctic is shaped by cross-national
**cooperation** through forums and regimes]{.underline} (e.g., UNCLOS,
AC), [we can find **evidence** that states **ignore** or **break** the
rules established by such institutions]{.underline}: while President
**[Putin]{.underline}** officially [claimed that]{.underline} "\[a\]ll
[decisions by the Arctic Council are nothing more than
**recommendations**]{.underline}" (Putin 2019), [**Canada** and the
**US** boycotted an AC meeting following Russia's intervention in
Ukraine]{.underline} (cf. Rahbek-Clemmensen 2017). Moreover, [**NATO**
issued a **general ban** on cooperation with Russia and]{.underline},
due to conflicting interests, [a total of **15 bilateral events**
between Oslo and Moscow were canceled]{.underline} (cf. ibid.).
[Although giving **lip service** to Arctic cooperation]{.underline},
[Russia increased **flights**]{.underline}, [violated NATO-states'
**border sovereignty**]{.underline}, [and conducted
unauthorized]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nter**[c]{.underline}**ontinental
**[b]{.underline}**allistic **[m]{.underline}**issile [**tests** in the
region]{.underline} (cf. ibid.). Finally, due to the denial of climate
change by the former US government, the AC was unable to release an
official declaration after their meeting in 2019 (cf. Lanteigne 2019).

Conclusion

[Although neorealism has been]{.underline} much [criticized]{.underline}
for its revisionist character and inability to explain change (cf.
Korab-Karpowicz 2017, Ch. 3.2), [it has provided **appropriate
assumptions** in an opening Arctic]{.underline}. The study found that
[thawing ice caps led the Arctic states to **pursue resources** to boost
their economic and military power]{.underline}. Moreover, this pursuit
of economic development has increased human activity and security
threats in the region, [leading to an **expansion** in Arctic military
capability]{.underline} by both Russia since 2007 and, more recently,
the US. Furthermore, the paper investigated Arctic power structures and
found that Russia's regional geographic, economic, and demographic
domination resulted in weaker Arctic states' bandwagoning behavior. This
was primarily observable in military cooperation through NATO and the
reopening and development of US bases on Icelandic and Greenlandic
territories. Finally, [as neorealism would **expect**]{.underline}
states to ignore the rules established by international regimes when it
is in their interest to do so, the illegal penetration of NATO airspace,
the boycott of AC meetings, and the refusal to make joint declarations
provided some grounds.

### AT: Realism Bad

#### Realism enables [radical resistance]{.underline} to domination---at [worst]{.underline}, there's [no link]{.underline} to their Ks because realism isn't a [monolith]{.underline}.

**Franceschet, 24**---Professor, Department of Political Science,
University of Calgary (Antonio, "A Realist Ethos of Resistance in Global
Politics," Global Studies Quarterly, Volume 4, Issue 2, April 2024, dml)

This article argues that [Realism contains an implicit ethos of
**resistance**]{.underline}, [which **reverses** the conventional image
of the tradition as **coldly accepting** the powerful dominating the
weak]{.underline}. Uncovering this ethos, however, requires three shifts
of perspective immanent to Realist debates. Disputes over the
possibility and significance of these shifts are longstanding and yet
have been the focus of much recent scholarship aimed at critically
reinterpreting a "classical" Realism in contrast to structuralist and
conservative variants. These shifts are (1) from an extreme to moderate
view of power politics; (2) from naturalizing the status quo to
envisaging progressive change from within the political domain; and (3)
from a horizontal view of politics among nations (or other like
entities) to a global view of power politics. In this article, a Realist
ethos of resistance is also articulated through a parallel engagement
with the philosopher Bernard Williams. His anti-moralist theory of
legitimate political power is an influential resource in new Realist
political theory. I extend his key concepts to a wider discussion---in
both IR and political theory---of the tradition's implicit ethos of
resistance. By engaging with classical Realist themes in IR in tandem
with Williams' ideas, [this]{.underline} article [illustrates Realism's
significance as a **challenger** to apologies for **domination** and
**injustice**]{.underline}. The contribution of this article is to
position a Realist voice about the realities of power politics in recent
debates over human rights to resist in global politics. Together,
classical and "new" [Realisms are **relevant** because they can
theorize]{.underline} such rights [within the context of knowledge about
the conditions and limits of legitimate power in **real-world
struggles**]{.underline}, [rather than **moralizing** resistance in the
**abstract**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} argument for a Realist ethos of resistance [builds
upon **extensive scholarship**]{.underline}, in both IR and political
theory, [**undercutting** the notion that Realism is a doctrine
of]{.underline} "**[might makes right]{.underline}**." As Vibeke Schou
Tjalve and Michael C. Williams state, "[From its
**origins**]{.underline}, political [realism has been based on being
**sociologically realistic** and **ethically responsible**]{.underline}"
(Tjalve and Williams 2015, 58). [The argument also builds on the
recovery of intellectual resources]{.underline}, [from **within** the
tradition]{.underline}, [concerning **morally illegitimate** forms and
uses of power]{.underline}, [in addition to the political ethics of
resistance struggles **against domination** and
**injustices**]{.underline}. That scholarship uncovers how
[exemplar]{.underline} mid-twentieth century classical
[Realists]{.underline}, such as Hans J. Morgenthau and Reinhold Niebuhr,
[**insisted** on the need to]{.underline}, in Morgenthau's words,
"[**regulate** and **restrain** the power drives that otherwise would
either tear society apart or deliver the weak to the arbitrary will of
the powerful]{.underline}" (Morgenthau 1985, 244). Indeed, [classical
Realist meditations on restraint and the limitation of power extend to
the **inevitability** and **necessity** of bottom-up challenges to
domination]{.underline} (Tjalve 2008; Hartnett 2021). This literature
complements recent applications of Realist ideas to the philosophy and
tactics of civil resistance and civil disobedience (Mantena 2012; King
2018; Sabl 2021). Building on these interventions, I develop a concept
of an ethos of resistance to frame and ground legitimate resistance
within the frictions and disagreements of the broader tradition, and
then situate a Realist voice in contemporary debates about resistance
rights in an era of global injustices.

This article proceeds in five steps: First, I outline how [the
tradition's core tenets are **not fixed**]{.underline}, and yet can
still be represented as a conversation about knowledge and truth about
the "reality" of politics and the challenges of formulating a political
morality appropriate to this reality. Second, I define Realism's
implicit relationship to an ethos of resistance through examples, both
the canonical and the unexpected, to provide a glimpse---and initial
description---of Realism's ethos. Third, I show how [an ethos of
resistance aligns with]{.underline} three **[shifts]{.underline}**
immanent to debates [within]{.underline} classical and "new"
[Realisms]{.underline} noted above---[toward
**moderation**]{.underline}, [embracing **progressive political
change**]{.underline}, [and a **global view** of power
relations]{.underline}. Fourth, I reinterpret the Realist philosopher
Bernard Williams' key concepts of the first political question and the
Basic Legitimation Demand as illustrations of an ethos of resistance
(Williams 2005). Finally, I situate this ethos in recent literatures
concerning a universal human right to resist domination and injustice.
By identifying Realism's internal resources for an ethos of resistance,
I show how the tradition both complements and critiques recent
non-Realist scholarship. Rather than advancing an applied ethics of
resistance, a Realist ethos focuses on how politics is about legitimate
power in contextual and real-world struggles.

A preliminary comment on resistance is in order. In this article,
resistance refers to a variety of political acts resulting from a
capacity to withstand or limit power (Barbalet 1985, 531). Resistance
comes in many forms and varies according to the nature of the power it
seeks to limit (Barnett and Duvall 2005). Depending on the context,
resisters seek a diversity of actions and outcomes, including
withdrawing cooperation and labor in support of a particular political
and social order, mobilizing political opposition, undermining a foreign
occupation, terrorism, and causing a revolution resulting in regime
change.1 In all its forms, resistance contests the legitimacy of power.
Acknowledging the variety of resistances, this article starts and ends
with a broad conception, and then narrows the topic by focusing on the
illegitimacy of domination.

What is Realism? From Axioms to Two Axes

[Realism is]{.underline} an "artificial construct" built from
asynchronous conversations about politics (Forde 1992, 62). As Jonathan
Haslam states, it is [a]{.underline} "[**spectrum** of
ideas]{.underline}" [and **not**]{.underline} "[a **fixed point of
focus** with sharp definition]{.underline}" (Haslam 2002, 249). In IR,
the history of political thought, and political theory, many seek to
define Realism's core tenets or axioms. Three general axioms from the
literature are (1) that politics should be understood on its own terms,
rather than through moral, idealistic, or religious categories (Galston
2010, 408; Finlayson 2017, 267); (2) that politics results from and
reflects intractable realities, namely "disagreement, contestation, and
coercion" (Rossi and Sleat 2014, 691; see also McQueen 2017, 297). And
therefore, (3) descriptively and prescriptively, Realists analyze the
"primacy of self-interest over moral principle" as a "necessity, and
therefore as a right" (Forde 1992, 62). It is possible to identify other
and more specific axioms but doing so risks having to concede exceptions
and internal disagreements. Rather than ignore the impact of these
divergences and incongruities, some point to the advantages of a
"reflexive" approach to Realist theorizing. Here, as Brent J. Steele
notes, "Reflexive [realism does not]{.underline}. . .[seek to
**reify**]{.underline} central modern realist [assumptions of
**power**]{.underline}, **[anarchy]{.underline}**, [or even]{.underline}
'**[the state]{.underline}**' [as **absolute**]{.underline} principles
of international politics, [but instead as contexualized artefacts that
**can** and **have changed**]{.underline}" (Steele 2007, 276--7).
Similarly, as Geróid Brinn argues, the problem in defining Realism in
relation to "shared tenets" is that "[even when different realists do
have shared commitments]{.underline}, [they will often mean **very
different things** to each]{.underline}" (Brinn 2020, 211).

To advance my argument about a Realist ethos of resistance, I focus on
two axes as virtual lines of conversation---both in agreement and
dispute---over the axioms that are commonly asserted:

Axis 1 (A1): Realism gravitates around the goal of advancing knowledge
claims about the fundamental nature of the political and power;

Axis 2 (A2): Realism confronts and advances questions of political
morality not in the abstract, but within the logic of A1 knowledge
claims.

The A1 axis involves claims about the nature and effects of the "given"
or limiting features of politics, and includes inter alia: human nature
and psychology; the insecurities and fears actors have in conditions of
anarchy or insecurity; and conflict and disagreement over fundamental
interests, values, and identities. An example of an A1 statement by a
classical Realist is Hans J. Morgenthau's: "the truth of political
science is the truth about power, its manifestations, its
configurations, its limitations, implications, its laws" (quoted in
Cozette 2008, 10). Another example from new Realist political theory is
Bernard Williams' assertion of the "universalism of negative
capabilities." He states, "the only certainly universal material of
politics: \[is\] power, powerlessness, fear and cruelty" (2005, 59). As
exemplars of classical and new Realisms, [neither Morgenthau nor
Williams assert that we must simply **take the world as it
is**]{.underline}. Rather, [knowledge claims are entangled with
practical and moral questions framed by the political]{.underline}; A1
statements raise A2 questions. [Seeking to **avoid wishful
thinking**]{.underline}, **[infeasible hopes]{.underline}**, [and
**abstract doctrines**]{.underline}, [Realists]{.underline}' A2
[discourse is]{.underline} distinctive.

Morgenthau follows his statement above [about uncovering
the]{.underline} "**[truth]{.underline}**" [about power's
manifestations]{.underline}, [configurations]{.underline},
[limitations]{.underline}, [and laws]{.underline}, with the A2 statement
that a Realist must tell "power what it can do and what it ought to do,
what is feasible and what is required" (quoted in Cozette 2008, 10).
Similarly, as William Galston writes, new "[Realists begin from where a
given political community **is**]{.underline}, [they assess the
**strength** of the bulwarks against the great evils of the human
condition that community has erected]{.underline}, [and they formulate
the **next steps** based on that assessment]{.underline}" (2010, 396).
At the same time, there are internal frictions within Realism because
the "universal" materials of politics (A1) and "next steps" are both
contextual and contested (A2). Defined in terms of a set of typical
axioms, Realism lacks a clearcut, paradigmatic, or shared perspective on
legitimate resistance to domination. However, when the tradition is also
understood relative to longstanding conversations about (A1) knowledge
claims of political reality, and (A2) the practical and moral
engagements that arise, we can see glimpses of an ethos of resistance.

Glimpses of a Realist Ethos of Resistance

Glimpses of a Realist ethos of resistance appear in revisiting and
reappraising some dominant narratives of the tradition. Thucydides'
famous "Realist" account of a dialogue in the Peloponnesian War
(431--404 B.C.E.) is often misunderstood (see Lebow 2003, 35). The
backdrop is Athens' wider war with Sparta. In the conversation between
the powerful Athenian generals and the weaker Melians, the former
demanded allegiance and submission. The Melian leaders maintain a right
of neutrality and independence, as a matter of justice (Thucydides 2008,
567). The Athenians' notorious response is that, among those unequal in
power, "the strong do what they can. . .the weak suffer what they must"
(2008, 566--7). When the dialogue ends, it is understood that the
Athenians "besieged the place" with the Melians being killed and
enslaved for their resistance (2008, 576).

The meaning and results of these words and actions are often depicted as
an instance of Realist intellectual and moral "honesty" (Forde 1992,
72). But "Thucydides leads his readers to regard this \[slaughter of the
Melians\] as an act of barbarism---that is, as morally reprehensible in
some sense," and one that eventually leads to Athens' breakdown into
"factious strife" (Forde 1992, 73). As Richard Ned Lebow argues,
Thucydides' narrative is not reducible to propositional axioms about
power, and the supposed futility of resistance. Rather, "Greek tragedy
and classical realists had a different understanding of knowledge" or
"tacit political knowledge," which engages "our intellect and emotions"
(Lebow 2003, 59). As he writes,

Thucydides is using the Dialogue to tell us that raw force can impose
its will at any moment, but no empire has the military and economic
capability to repress its subjects indefinitely. Allies who regard
themselves the objects of exploitation will rebel when the opportunity
arises. Oppression also leaves memories that inhibit future attempts at
empire building. (Lebow 2003, 125)

Indeed, an over-extended Athenian power, applied with needless cruelty,
was undercut by a deeper crisis of legitimacy (Lebow 2003, 216).

Many including Lebow highlight the parallels between Thucydides and
Morgenthau's Realist opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1960s (Lebow
2003, 125; Cozette 2008, 16--8; Scheuerman 2009, 164--95; Zambernardi
2011). Morgenthau believed it was unrealistic for the United States to
expect to convert its superior military power into victory in Vietnam,
and the elimination of communist influence in the region. But crucially,
he took seriously that the Vietnamese resistance was part of a longer
"national" struggle to drive out foreign and colonial dominators
(Morgenthau 1968, 32; Lebow 2003, 240; Zambernardi 2011, 1340). For the
Vietnamese, fighting for national independence was a grave interest,
although they were divided on how to achieve it. By contrast, the United
States had no similarly grave interest in the fight, despite what its
leaders claimed (Lebow 2003, 240). From an American perspective,
Morgenthau believed the war was unnecessary and could only undermine
influence among allies and national unity (Scheuerman 2009, 171--2).

These two widely discussed Realist vignettes are important examples of
disputes among Realists over core axioms. Consider the axiom of the
primacy of self-interest over moral principle. Were the Athenian
generals being "Realists" when they asserted that their self-interest
and superior power required dispensing with any notion of "justice"? Or
was Thucydides' observation that Athens' extreme and infamous slaughter
of the Melians epitomized a loss of ethical balance and restraint that
many believe should define the tradition? Morgenthau's Thucydides-like
"Realist" critique of the American War in Vietnam clashed with others
who saw the conflict as a necessary response to Cold War geopolitical
struggles, and with vital national interests at stake (Zambernardi 2011,
1352--3). Such disagreement raises again the awkward question of whose
Realism is more attuned to the "real" A1 truths and knowledge claims.
Morgenthau's protest of the American War on Vietnamese resisters has
become a new cautionary tale, particularly in the scholarship on [the
tradition's]{.underline} classical, [reflexive history]{.underline}, and
contemporary relevance (Lebow 2003, 234--54; Williams 2005, 193; Steele
2007, 286; Tjalve 2008, 2, 75, 118).

These two well-known vignettes also [offer suggestive glimpses
of]{.underline} this article's central concept, an ethos of
resistance---[an implicit attitude that resistance is a **legitimate
response** to domination by the powerful]{.underline}. Karuna Mantena's
article on Mohandas [**Gandhi**'s activism against British colonial rule
provides another]{.underline}, unexpected [glimpse of such an
ethos]{.underline}. He depicts Gandhi's leadership and philosophy as
[premised on]{.underline} "another" kind of **[Realism]{.underline}**
(2012, 457). Inverting the stereotype of naïve moralism, Mantena asserts
that key texts and events show a much different picture: "[Gandhi\'s
realist theory of politics was a **contextual**]{.underline},
**[consequentialist]{.underline}**, and moral-psychological [analysis of
a political world understood to be marked by inherent tendencies toward
conflict]{.underline}, domination, and violence" (Mantena 2012, 459).
[Gandhi focused on how non-violence is a]{.underline} "[**practical
orientation** and a set of **strategic responses** rather than simply an
**ethical stance** or standard of moral judgement]{.underline}" (Mantena
2012). Quite clearly, Gandhi was more than a dispassionate historical
observer, like Thucydides, and exercised an influence different than an
activist--scholar--citizen like Morgenthau, who was frustrated by his
country's reckless imposition of power in Southeast Asia. Yet Mantena
shows that Gandhi's leadership was based on a dispassionate
interpretation of the human passions and inclinations, such as pride,
honor, and reactivity to cycles of violence (along the A1 axis). At the
same time, Mantena's research shows how Gandhi dissolved the distinction
between the A1 and A2 axes: The active demonstration of truth
(satyagraha) through disciplined and restrained non-cooperation
demonstrated the irrational contradictions and illegitimacy of British
colonial rule (Mantena 2012, 462--4). This study recasts the events
surrounding Gandhi's moral leadership beyond their well-known effects on
transforming the real-world politics of colonial domination, as Realist
rather than moralistic. I suggest they also offer a glimpse of what is
meant here by an ethos of resistance.

I use [the term **ethos**]{.underline} to [underline that Realism's
political morality **eschews** a **universalist**]{.underline},
[**extra-political** concept of right and wrong that **takes
precedence** over the real-world political realm]{.underline}. Instead,
[an ethos is a disposition and attitude to this realm]{.underline}.
Indeed, recent scholarship on classical IR Realism often employs the
term ethos to point to distinctive versions of a non-moralistic
political morality.2 As Mark T. Lilla writes, [an ethos can inform and
overlay a morality or ethical code]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} by
doing so, it [becomes]{.underline} "[**more** than **abstract
reasoning**]{.underline}" (Lilla 1981, 14). Indeed, "\[e\]thical theory
is really the furthest thing from an ethos. . .\[[which
tends]{.underline}\] [towards abstract logical systems **quite
divorced** from the lives we live]{.underline}" (Lilla 1981, 10). [The
term can also be related to]{.underline} Max Weber's political ethos,
characterized by skepticism of moral absolutism and [recognition of the
need to]{.underline} "[make **consequentialist calculations** to help
determine the appropriateness of particular political
means]{.underline}" (Satkunanandan 2014, 169). Such an ethos accepts the
"'ethical irrationality' of the world and thereby rise\[s\] to the
fundamental, substantively unspecifiable, and inexhaustible
responsibility \[of political actors\] to respond to the world 'as it
really is'" (Satkunanandan 2014).

This article suggests that an ethos of resistance in Realism overlays
the specific political and ethical judgments and decisions of scholars
and actors. With such an ethos, resistance is understood as a blameless
response to those responsible for domination and injustices, rather than
as futile action. But not all Realists would adopt such an ethos; and in
the next section, I show how it only comes into focus within the
tradition because of three choices.

Three Realist Choices: Moderate, Progressive, and Global

These initial glimpses of a Realist ethos of resistance correspond with
three choices within the tradition's history. The ethos is activated by:
(1) choosing political moderation over extremism; (2) an openness to
progressive change to a status quo versus conserving extant power
arrangements; and (3) an expansiveness with respect to theorizing the
significance of resistance in politics, locating it globally rather than
horizontally among states or vertically between a state and its
subjects.

Extremist and Moderate Realisms

The most significant internal divide between Realists is often described
as the extremist versus moderate orientations to politics (A1) and the
morality (A2) of action (see Forde 1992; Mantena 2012, 455; McQueen
2017, 298). At the extremist end of the spectrum, Realism endorses might
makes right, a maxim that moderates reject in favor of making judgments
about the need to balance and modulate conflicting political objectives.

Extremist Realism argues that natural or objective forces create an
unyielding reality of struggles for power. In such struggles, those with
more power possess a "right" to dominate the weak (as an A1 claim). The
Athenian generals tell the Melians, "You know as well as we do that
right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power"
(Thucydides 2008, 566). As Walzer (1977, 5) observes, the logic of this
argument is that political necessity narrows and bifurcates the
political: For Athens, it is "reign or be subject," and for the Melians,
it is "yield or be destroyed." Extremist Realism "claim\[s\] to have
discovered an awful truth: what we conventionally call inhumanity is
simply humanity under pressure" (Walzer 1977, 4). Indeed, contemporary
structural Realists such as John Mearsheimer appeal to the so-called
awful truth to explain if not justify great power domination and
aggression: "The sad fact is that international politics has always been
a ruthless and dangerous business, and it is likely to remain that
way....the international system forces states which seek only to be
secure to nonetheless act aggressively toward each other" (Mearsheimer
2014, 2, 3). Recently, he applied this view to Russia's annexation and
invasions of Ukraine, as understandable responses to Western powers'
behavior, namely, attempts to check or limit Russia's sphere of
dominance (i.e., expanding NATO's membership) (Mearsheimer 2022). Not
unlike Athens' atrocities in Melos, Russia's attacks on Ukrainian
civilian targets are extreme. But for extreme Realists, real-world
politics will necessarily involve atrocities inflicted on the weak.

Challenging extremist Realist arguments is a necessary step to
identifying how and where an ethos of resistance can fit in the broader
tradition. Ido Oren (2009) challenges the contradictions in structural
Realism's approach to the relationship of supposedly objective realities
and prescriptive advocacy. On the one hand, Mearsheimer (2014, 3) argues
that the objective realities of power and anarchy cannot be altered to
appease an extraneous ideology or morality, such as justice or human
rights (Mearsheimer 2014, 46--8). On the other hand, when real-world
actors---whether victims or third-party powers---resist or push back,
the extremist version of structural Realism asserts prescriptive
language against irrational behavior, i.e., at odds with the actors'
objective interests. But as Oren asks, "if there\'s a 'real world'
impervious to political thought, why bother to try to influence it?"
(2009, 283). After all, the Athenians generals try to convince the
Melians that it would be better for all concerned if they simply
capitulated. As well, Mearsheimer criticizes Western policymakers for
insensitivity to Russia's geopolitical anxieties about NATO's eastward
expansion (Mearsheimer 2022). Unless significantly amended, extremist
Realism's descriptive (A1) and prescriptive faces (A2) become
paradoxical, leading to an "impossibility of being a consistent and
thoroughgoing realist" (Oren 2009, 296).

This impossibility is augmented by extremist Realism's ideas concerning
political (a)morality. As Mantena suggests, "if politics is understood
as determining, partly or wholly, its own internal standards, it opens
the door to harder edged realisms that dispense with the category of
morality altogether" (2012, 346). By fetishizing the strong's
ability/"right" to dominate the weak, extreme Realists go far beyond
steering clear of naive moralism. Instead, they advocate a kind of
solipsist amoralism for the most powerful actors. The position of the
Athenian generals is that the Melians ought to "have the good sense to
submit to the inevitable domination of the stronger" rather than
"moralizing the supposed 'injustice' of it" (Forde 1992, 72). Submitting
to the stronger power "without resistance. . .\[would minimize\] the
suffering on both sides" (Forde 1992). With such claims, and to Walzer's
point, extreme Realism hollows out and eviscerates any possibilities for
the meaningful moral argumentation (along A2).

[Closer examination of the tradition reveals the persistence of a
moderate alternative rooted in classical Realism]{.underline}. For
moderates, [politics is **not reducible** to the power to **dominate**
and **coerce** others]{.underline} (Lebow 2003, 275, 310; Barkin 2010,
19--20). Instead, [politics must entail perceptions of authority or
legitimacy]{.underline}, [as well as leadership or political
judgment]{.underline}, [which together provide
opportunities]{.underline}---[and responsibilities]{.underline}---[to
**temper** the most flagrant of excessive impulses of
power]{.underline}. Indeed, for moderates, [unrestrained
power]{.underline}, [and flagrant injustices **undermine** the
fundamental]{.underline} political and social [purposes that power is
meant to create and secure]{.underline}.3 While structuralist Realism
remains a dominant IR approach, a recent generation of reflexive,
broadly constructivist research shows how the tradition's history is
heavily populated with the arguments of moderate Realists. Thucydides,
Hobbes, Clausewitz, Morgenthau, and other classical Realists theorized
how the tensions among politics, power, legitimacy, and resistance
cannot be short-circuited in favor of extremist actions (Lebow 2003, 35;
Steele 2007, 273; Hom and Steele 2010, 272; Levine 2012, 26; Tjalve and
Williams 2015, 39; Hom 2018, 139). There is also a literature uncovering
how [many classical Realist reactions to power are rooted
in]{.underline} religious [conceptions of **human finitude** and
**social justice**]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} early modern
European and republican conceptions of [the need to **check** and
**limit** uncontrolled power and domination]{.underline} (Rosenthal
1991; Murray 1996; Williams 2005, 6, 18; Tjalve 2008, 5, 16; Tjalve and
Williams 2015, 39--40; Hartnett 2021). Indeed, [a moderate Realism
theorizes power in terms of legitimacy and limitation]{.underline}, [and
this introduces an **accepting**]{.underline}, [if not
**radical**]{.underline}, [advocacy for resistance to
domination]{.underline}. Moreover, [moderates see resistance to abuses
and injustices as **important** and **consequential**]{.underline},
[rather than futile and irrelevant]{.underline}.

Status Quo and Progressive Realisms

[It is axiomatic for Realism that]{.underline} disagreement, conflict,
and [power struggles cannot be eliminated through instituting a
universal set of moral values]{.underline} and legal norms. [But it is
an **ongoing debate** whether this skepticism]{.underline} ultimately
[reinforces status quo power relations]{.underline} and institutions,
[or whether Realism can envisage **progressive** and even **radical**
change]{.underline} (Finlayson 2017; Goodhart 2018, 81--106; Brinn
2020). As Duncan Bell writes, [Realism is]{.underline}
"**[not]{.underline}** (in any of its usual variants) [a **fully
fledged** political ideology]{.underline}, [with coherent and
determinate positions]{.underline} on a wide range of moral and
political issues" (Bell 2009, 12). Instead, [the tradition is a
**conversation** among ideologically and politically diverse
standpoints]{.underline}. Realist disagreement over the necessity and
possibility of reconciling power politics with purposeful social and
political change, even progress, occurs along both A1 and A2.

[In **contrast** to stereotypes of Realists as **complacent** and
**conservative**]{.underline}, [recent scholarship has shown how **key
thinkers** of the tradition sought **feasible challenges** to existing
power relations and institutions]{.underline}. For instance, Michael
Williams' (2005) category of "wilful" Realists, illustrated by Thomas
Hobbes, J.-J. Rousseau, and Morgenthau, paints a different picture. For
these thinkers, being realistic requires a political social construction
project; the constitution of actors capable of generating conditions for
legitimacy in liberal modernity (2005, 16, 20). Similarly,
**[Scheuerman]{.underline}** (2011) [contrasts more
**conservative-minded** Realists]{.underline}, who prioritize skepticism
of change to the point where support for a status quo is the only
"realistic" choice, [with **progressive** Realists]{.underline},
[who]{.underline} advocate for significant, yet gradual reforms.
Twentieth-century progressive Realists include E.H. Carr, Reinhold
Niebuhr, and Hans J. Morgenthau. Unlike the latter-day conservatives
Scheuerman mentions (such as Henry Kissinger, Kenneth Waltz, and
Mearsheimer), this earlier wave of progressives [argued that Realism
**errs** when it tracks **too closely** with the interests of status quo
power arrangements]{.underline}. For one thing, [endorsing a status quo
of great power relations **increases the possibility** of **nuclear**
and other **atrocities**]{.underline}. [The very **survival** of the
species]{.underline} and of the political domain, one for which there
are opportunities to preserve and advance human interests, [is at
stake]{.underline}. But [there is a more comprehensive set of
progressive interests at stake in **challenging injustices** and
**inequalities**]{.underline}.

On political and moral grounds, [classical Realists have **critiqued**
efforts to conserve **perverse power inequalities** or **social
domination**]{.underline}. Dissent and resistance to unjust power
structures were key themes in both Niebuhr and Morgenthau's
interventions. To be clear, neither claimed nor advocated that
revolutionary politics or violence is the best remedy for oppression or
domination. Yet [they **firmly rejected** passively accepting an unjust
status quo]{.underline}. [**Niebuhr** wrote against moralistic and
religious pacifisms that acquiesce to violent oppression]{.underline},
[whether in the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [with respect to **racial
discrimination**]{.underline}, [or **globally** in respect to
**imperialism**]{.underline} (Scheuerman 2011, 22; Hartnett 2021, 161).
As he wrote in his 1932 Moral Man and Immoral Society: "When collective
power, whether in the form of imperialism or class domination, exploits
weakness, it can never be dislodged unless power is raised against it.
If conscience and reason can be insinuated into the resulting struggle
they can only qualify but not abolish it" (Niebuhr 2021, 6). Similarly,
Morgenthau argued that "social conflict remained permanent features of
the human condition" and that justice and equilibrium among conflicting
groups were required to "eliminate the incentive to seek justice through
strife" (Scheuerman 2011, 24). [Far from a **complacent acceptance** of
power realities]{.underline}, [**Morgenthau** argued that a Realist
theory]{.underline} "\[a\]t its very best. . .[**cannot help** being a
**subversive** and **revolutionary** force]{.underline} with regard to
certain vested interests---intellectual, political, economic, social in
general."4Mantena's (2012) analysis of Gandhi's activist philosophy
echoes Scheuerman and others' treatments of mid-century American and
European progressive Realists. [For such Realism]{.underline},
[progressive change is **possible** and **necessary** for countering
injustices]{.underline}, [whether caused by **great power
hubris**]{.underline}, **[capitalism]{.underline}**,
**[colonialism]{.underline}**, [or other forces of **social
domination**]{.underline}.5

### AT: Root Cause

#### Great power war doesn't have a root cause, or it would occur [all the time]{.underline}, not [twice per century]{.underline}.

**Clare, 21**---Research Fellow, Forethought Foundation for Global
Priorities Research (Stephen, "Great Power Conflict," *Founders Pledge*,
November 2021, dml)

Having clarified what is meant by terms \"Great Power\", we now turn our
attention to the literature on the causes of war. [[Great Power war
is]{.underline}]{.mark} an intrinsically
**[[difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}** subject [[to
study]{.underline}]{.mark}. For one, [such [conflicts
are]{.mark}]{.underline} (fortunately) relatively
**[[rare]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [humanity has averaged **two** major
wars per century for the last **500 years**]{.underline}. [They also
have **many possible causes**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, researchers
have made many [attempts to]{.underline} tackle this issue and [identify
factors that **increase** or **decrease** the risk]{.underline} of wars
breaking out. These [are exercises in **probability**]{.underline}:
while factors that guarantee war have not been found, these research
efforts have identified many characteristics, contexts, and correlates
that make conflicts more or less likely.

Levels of analysis

[Many possible causes of war have been proposed]{.underline}. To
organize our analysis, we adopt a framework used by both Greg Cashman in
What Causes War and Jack Levy and William Thompson in Causes of War. The
[possible causes]{.underline} of war [are]{.underline} sorted into five
categories: the 28 **[individual]{.underline}** level, the
**[sub-state]{.underline}** level, the **[state]{.underline}** level,
the **[bilateral]{.underline}** level, [and]{.underline} the [**system**
level]{.underline}. [[**Different** causes]{.mark} of war [apply]{.mark}
in **different situations**]{.underline}, [**[multiple]{.mark}** causes
might exert an [influence]{.mark} in [the **same
situation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} there may be
interactions between causes [at **multiple
levels**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both the theoretical reasoning and
empirical evidence behind each of these causes are considered.

[**Rarely** does all the evidence point in the same
direction]{.underline}; instead, [a **range** of different causes apply
to different historical or hypothetical cases]{.underline}. [Studies can
also produce **different**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [sometimes
**contradictory** results]{.underline}, [depending on how they define
and operationalize concepts]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the **[evidence
[reviews]{.mark}]{.underline}** from Cashman and Levy and Thompson
[[highlight]{.underline}]{.mark} some important findings. In general,
territorial disputes, **[Great Power [tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
ideological conflicts, psychological biases, [[and
**escalatory**]{.mark} **foreign [policy]{.mark}
responses**]{.underline} all seem to [[**raise** danger]{.mark}
levels]{.underline}. In contrast, [the spread of
**[democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**de-escalation** of
rivalries]{.underline}, [and **resolution** of]{.underline} minor
[disputes]{.underline} like competing territorial claims seem to
[[advance **peace**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

An important caveat for all that follows is that it is difficult to know
when findings based on studies of conflicts in the past can be
generalized to make predictions about conflicts in the future.

Individual level

Researchers working at the individual level try to explain war [by
studying]{.underline} the nature and
**[[psychology]{.underline}]{.mark}** of people, especially the heads of
state who decide whether or not to take their country into war. Many
[thinkers]{.underline}, from St. Augustine of Hippo to Sigmund Freud,
[have hypothesized that war results from an **innate aggressiveness**
within humans]{.underline}. **[However]{.underline}**, [the **empirical
evidence** for this claim is **weak**]{.underline}. [Though
anthropologists]{.underline}, [historians]{.underline}, [and political
scientists debate the **roots** of]{.underline} violence and
[warfare]{.underline}, [they **generally agree** that aggression is
**mediated** by]{.underline} the [social and environmental
contexts]{.underline} in which people live.29 Moreover, [attributing the
existence of war to innate aggression [does **little** to explain why
wars occur **some**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but **not
all**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[of the time]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Researchers have identified **[several [features]{.mark}]{.underline}**
of state leaders [[that explain]{.mark} some of the
**[variance]{.mark}** in the incidence of warfare]{.underline}. The
cognitive revolution of the last several decades, which has emphasized
the role of subconscious and emotional processes in individual
decision-making, has undermined the idea that rational reasoning alone
determines outcomes in international relations.30 Factors that play a
role [[include]{.underline}]{.mark}:

**[[Personality]{.mark} traits]{.underline}**: Several studies have
presented evidence that leaders with more authoritarian, domineering,
extroverted, or risk-tolerant personalities are more likely to advocate
for the use of force, 31 though this literature is too thin to generate
any reliable conclusions about the size of this effect.

[**Heuristics** and **[biases]{.mark}**]{.underline}: Leaders use
shortcuts and simple models to make decisions, such as relying on
historical analogies to assess situations.32 Several experts believe
leaders are systematically overconfident when making decisions about
war, especially once the war has started or seems inevitable.

**[[Misperception]{.underline}]{.mark}**: It is difficult to accurately
obtain and process decision-relevant information during times of
conflict.34 Given this, leaders may be overconfident in their analyses
and predisposed to misperceive their opponents as aggressive yet
vulnerable.

**[[Stress]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Finally, biases are heightened during
times of stress, when people find it even more difficult to reason
systematically and clearly. Most, but not all, studies suggest that
stress has a significant, negative impact on decision-making ability
during times of conflict.35

Since many of these factors, such as personality traits or
stress-tolerance, vary among individuals, they can explain some of the
variance in the incidence of war. [A jingoistic leader **alone** can
make a state more likely to go to war]{.underline}.
**[However]{.underline}**, [**many other factors** at levels **beyond**
the individual also bear on this outcome]{.underline}, starting with the
influence of group decision-making processes.
