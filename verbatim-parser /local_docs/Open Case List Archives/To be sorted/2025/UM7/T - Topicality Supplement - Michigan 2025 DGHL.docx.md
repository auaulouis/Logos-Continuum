## Development 

### Development of the Arctic---3 Areas 

#### "Development of the Arctic" can only be three concepts: Resource Extraction, Scientific Research and Tourism

By now, we can examine [[three]{.mark} possible [concepts]{.mark} for
the development]{.underline} of the resource potential, which [can be
used [as the basis for]{.mark} the strategy]{.underline} of
socio-economic and scientific-technological [[development of
the]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}:

[1) **[resource-rental pattern]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[implying]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [**extraction of mineral resources**
and]{.mark} increasing]{.underline} commercial
**[[fishing]{.underline}]{.mark}** of northern fish in the exclusive
economic zone;

[2) [scientific research]{.mark} model]{.underline} that presupposes the
conservation of the Arctic ecosystem [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[deployment of specialized scientific landings]{.underline} in the
Arctic;

3[) [transport and tourism]{.mark} model]{.underline}, involving the
active exploitation of the NSR and the [development of
tourism]{.underline} in the Arctic region.

#### US past "development of the Arctic" is solely focused on economic gains---extraction of resources, boosting transportation, and science research

### Development of the Arctic---Minerals 

#### "Development of the Arctic" is the process of exploiting resources.

/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-81253-9_17#citeas, February 25, 2022

In this section, I examine how the Development of the Arctic will most
probably look like. [[We have]{.mark} already [seen]{.mark} that [the
**Development of the Arctic**]{.mark} will be [**mainly about** the
exploitation of resources,]{.mark} [particularly oil, gas, and
minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [There may also be Arctic shipping and
fisheries]{.underline}]{.mark} [exploitation for the (short) time that
there will be fis]{.underline}h. All of these [activities will require
investments into infrastructure for such exploitation, as well as access
and transport infrastructures]{.underline}. This may be accompanied by
broader construction projects for housing. [[However]{.underline}, [all
of these infrastructures will mostly **remain supportive of resources
exploitation**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**,** even though [they]{.mark} may
[generate]{.mark} important [economic activities]{.mark} in
themselves.]{.underline} Thus, I will only focus on resources
exploitation here. In order to do that, I will proceed in two steps. I
will first identify the main actors of such resources exploitation in
the Arctic, as well as reflect on their motives (States) and their
incentives (companies). In a second step, I will discuss what the
exploitation of such resources will look like from the perspective of
the peoples who are supposed to be the beneficiaries of "sustainable
development".

Actors of Arctic Development

Krivorotov and Finger (2018) identified the main actors of Arctic
resource exploitation and concluded that they are [mostly state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), either owned be the Arctic States themselves or by
governments of other countries interested in the Arctic]{.underline}
(such as China and France). [More private companies operate in the US
Arctic]{.underline}. However, their relationship with government is
similar to that of SOEs (Finger, 2013), a conclusion also supported by
Kaznatcheev and Balazeva (2016). Furthermore, Krivorotov and Finger
(2018) analyzed the strategies of the two most important SOEs operating
in the Arctic -- Russian Gazprom and Norwegian Statoil, now rebranded
Equinor -- and drew some interesting conclusions, that can be
generalized to other development actors in the Arctic, beyond oil and
gas and beyond Russia and Norway.

Overall, exploiting resources in the Arctic has been and remains a risky
business, which companies can rarely shoulder by themselves. Whatever
the companies, they will have to need government support in various
forms, be it in terms of financing supporting infrastructures (access
roads, ports, icebreakers), risk guarantees, preferential concessions,
preferential loans, tax brakes, operational subsidies, and others. Such
government support is ever more likely, the better the relationship of
the company with the government, something that favors SOEs.

However, this supportive relationship is reciprocal: government support
is more likely to be given to companies that a government trusts or more
easily controls than to private and foreign operators. This again leads
to SOEs, such as Gazprom and Equinor. But there are many others, such as
Rosneft and Novatek in Russia , as well as Petoro in Norway . In the US
Arctic, concessions are typically given to US companies; even though
they are not state-owned, they build on long-term trusted relationships
with government. There is naturally a need for particular technical
expertise, given the harsh Arctic environment. Such expertise is often
lacking among the Russian companies, so they team up (joint ventures)
with semi-state-owned companies (such as ENI, Total).

This reliance on SOEs is even more important for countries for which oil
and gas is of strategic economic importance. To recall, "more than 80%
of Russia 's exports are oil, natural gas, metals and timber,
approximately half of which stem from the Arctic region. Similarly,
Norway 's export of oil and gas constitute 45% of its total exports and
more than 20% of its GDP" (Krivorotov and Finger, 2018: 58). Quite
logically, government will be more likely to entrust their own with the
exploitation of such strategic resources than be reliant on companies
that are more subject to market dynamics with the risk of them
eventually leaving less profitable ventures.

Again, this relationship is reciprocal: foreign private companies that
would like to become active in the Arctic minimize their investment and
political risks by teaming up with SOEs or directly with governments.

These same considerations can also be [extended to mineral resources,
even though t[here are more mining than oil and gas companies active in
Arctic resource extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, this is
probably due more to the fact that there are very different types of
minerals available in the Arctic and many companies tend to be
specialized (such as nickel, cobalt, copper, zinc, lead, tungsten,
titanium, zirconium, gold, silver, platinum, palladium, diamonds, and
uranium). Fishing and tourism companies are mostly privately owned.

Despite the discourse on sustainable development, [this is [what
development in the Arctic is]{.mark} and will essentially be
about]{.underline}. This is also the kind of [development that
[governments prefer]{.mark}, as such development is [centrally
controllable]{.mark}.]{.underline} With the exception of Greenland and
Iceland, we do not really have Arctic States. Furthermore, Iceland has
no indigenous peoples and Greenland, despite being mainly indigenous, is
not totally independent from Denmark. The Arctic portion of all other
states is under the control of a center, located far more south.
Developing their periphery means devolving power, sharing revenues and
ultimately empowering local peoples, many of them indigenous, which is
an additional reason not to empower them. [[Natural resources
exploitation in the Arctic is certainly also **fully in line** with
wha]{.mark}t their respective [nation-states
prefe]{.mark}r]{.underline}. Since the Industrial Revolution,
[[renewable and especially non-renewable resources have been essential
for Development to proceed]{.mark} and there will therefore inevitably
be a market]{.underline}. Of course, there are companies, sometimes even
private ones, that do the job of extraction these resources. Mostly,
however, states will prefer their own SOEs, even though foreign capital
and expertise is always welcome. So, what can the Arctic peoples expect
from such development ?

### Development = Economic Oriented 

#### Development Projects in the Arctic are economic focused only 

Ksenija **Hanaček et al 22**, PhD in 2019, Institute of Environmental

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180 0921003062,
2022

Within this context, [[development projects and planning in the Arctic
are]{.mark} being [**driven** by]{.mark} ideas of [advanced
**tech**]{.mark}**nological [progress and economic
growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Egerman et al., 2003). Some of its
regions are integral parts of modern industrialized nation-states
(although this is not the case for Greenland, an autonomous territory
within the Kingdom of Denmark) (Muller-Wille, 1987; Nuttall, 2012).
[[These states cater to]{.mark} particular economic sectors and
corporations in different **[extractive sectors]{.mark}**]{.underline},
easing their access to Arctic Indigenous and other territories.

#### Development must be economic oriented

Donatella **Alessandrini 22**, Professor of Law, University of Kent,
Canterbury, United Kingdom, "A Not So 'New Dawn' for International
Economic Law and Development: Towards a Social Reproduction Approach to
GVCs", European Journal of International Law, Volume 33, Issue 1,
February 2022, Pages 131--162,
https://academic.oup.com/ejil/article/33/1/131/658276 4, May 9, 2022

The narrative about 'development' as 'insertion cum technological
upgrade and greater value-capture' has become stronger, with
participation in GVCs and value capture heralded as a 'new dawn for
development'.30 The first question therefore concerns the way in which
'development' and 'value added' are understood in these reports. Despite
references to a 'new dawn', the [concept of '[**development'** is still
**associated** with]{.mark} the **[process of]{.mark} actively
[promoting export-oriented economic growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [What
is unique to this development agenda is that export-oriented growth is
to be achieved not through the establishment of a whole industrial
base]{.underline} [or the support of specific national sectors but,
rather, through the creation of a regulatory environment that enables
firms to specialize in parts]{.underline}, components and tasks so to
link up with lead firms; upgrade thanks to the innovation [[made
possible by]{.mark} their [transfer of technology; and]{.mark},
eventually, move up the value-added ladder of economic activities,
[capturing]{.mark} greater [economic gains]{.mark}]{.underline}.31 [The
focus is therefore on **increasing domestic value added**.]{.underline}
Domestic 'value added' refers to the share of domestic content -- of
what is produced nationally -- that gets destined to export.32 The
assumption is that 'value added' will be shared between firms, through
profits, and workers, through wages, consequently increasing states'
income through taxation. Increasing domestic value added is therefore
key to the development potential of value chain trade. However, the 2019
GVCD report warns countries against policies aimed at increasing the
share of domestic content through import substitution because
substituting imported inputs -- which are assumed to be cheaper and of
better quality -- with domestic inputs is thought to compromise the
efficiency of the country's exports.33

## Its 

### Its = Ownership 

#### 'Its' is a possessive pronoun showing ownership

**Glossary of English Grammar Terms, 2005**

(http://www.usingenglish.com/glossary/possessive-pronoun.html)

Mine, yours, his, hers, [[its]{.underline}]{.mark}, ours, theirs
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[possessive
pronouns]{.underline}]{.mark} [used [to]{.mark}]{.underline} substitute
a noun and to [[show]{.underline}]{.mark} possession or
[[ownership]{.mark}.]{.underline}

EG. This is your disk and that\'s mine. (Mine substitutes the word disk
and shows that it belongs to me.)

#### That means the government must own and maintain the project

**Appelate Court of Illinois 80**

("Hulett v. Central Illinois Light Co.," 83 Ill. App. 3d 195, Lexis)//BB

The plaintiff responded to the motion for summary judgment to the effect
that as to who owned or controlled the wires is immaterial, since CILCO
was required to maintain and inspect all electric supply lines carrying
its electricity and had failed to do so. In support of this contention
the plaintiff relies upon Illinois Commerce Commission General Order 160
\-- Revised, and effective as of June 1, 1963, which provides as
follows:¶ \"9. General Maintenance Requirements.¶ [Each public
utility]{.underline} operating a system of power or communication lines
[shall maintain *its* \[italics in original\] system]{.underline} of
lines in such condition as will enable it to furnish safe, adequate and
dependable service.¶ Power and communication lines and their associated
equipment shall comply with the provisions of this General Order when
placed in service, and shall thereafter by systematically inspected, and
when necessary, be subjected to tests to determine their fitness for the
service required of them, and for conditions of safety. Any defects
revealed by such inspections and tests which could cause or create an
unsafe condition, shall be promptly corrected. If such corrections are
not immediately undertaken, a record of the condition found shall be
made in the proper plant office of the utility. Defective lines or their
associated equipment shall be placed in good operating condition, or
otherwise effectively disconnected or removed.\" (Emphasis added.)¶ The
purport of the trial judge\'s order is to this court clear in that a
question of law is presented, namely, whether or not the Commerce
Commission General Order 160 places a duty upon CILCO to maintain,
repair and inspect the electrical lines in question, even though they
are not and never have been owned or controlled by the power company. We
note, however, that the plaintiff attempts to challenge the sufficiency
of the Volk affidavit which denies ownership or control of the lines by
CILCO. It is the plaintiff\'s argument that the affidavit referred to
records as to premises located at 821 Tremont Township, Tremont,
Illinois, and that the described premises have not been established as
the place where the plaintiff was injured. We find no merit in this
contention since it is \[198\] patently clear from the record that there
was no concern on the part of the trial court or the parties to this
action concerning the Volk affidavit or where the plaintiff was injured.
It should be noted that the plaintiff did not file a counteraffidavit
and consequently admitted that CILCO did not own or control the
electrical line. (See Carruthers v. B. C. Christopher & Co. (1974), 57
Ill. 2d 376, 313 N.E.2d 457.) To raise on appeal the question of
ownership appears to be an effort on the part of the plaintiff to
obfuscate the true issue, to-wit, the meaning and effect of General
Order 160.¶ We have set forth the pertinent provisions of the order and
[attention should be directed to the word **its** located in the first
paragraph and which we have emphasized. The word its as used is a
pronoun and is being used in its **possessive** form. By the use of the
word it is clear that each public utility]{.underline} system
[shall]{.underline} **[maintain]{.underline}** the power [lines which it
**owns**]{.underline}.

#### 'its' is possessive meaning belonging to

**Supreme Court of Oklahoma 34**

(Swindall v. State Election Board, 168 Okla. 97, Lexis)//BB

However, I view another phase of the act which is not considered in the
majority opinion. It is my opinion that the expression, \"its
nominees,\" should have been construed by this court. Had this court so
construed those words, it would have assisted the State Election Board
in the furtherance of its ministerial duties, and would have set to rest
the immediate question. It is my theory that the correct interpretation
to place upon those words, \"its nominees,\" is to the effect that those
words do not mean all the nominees of any particular party. [The word
\"its\" is the possessive case]{.underline}, or the possessive adjective
[of \"it\", meaning]{.underline} of or **[belonging to
it.]{.underline}** Webster\'s International Dictionary. In other words,
the expression, \"its nominees,\" as applied to the Republican party,
means nominees of it (the Republican party). The words, \"nominees\" of
the \"Republican party,\" do not and necessarily cannot mean all the
nominees of the Republican party. Those words, however, do mean more
than one nominee. It seems reasonable to conclude, in the absence of an
expression like \"all of its nominees,\" or words of similar import,
that it was not the intent of the Legislature to make those words, \"its
nominees,\" all inclusive. It seems to me that a fair and reasonable
interpretation would be that those words support and embrace the thought
expressed by the New York statute, to wit, that it is the intention of
the candidate to support generally at the next general election the
nominees of the party from which he seeks his nomination, or that it is
his intention to support a majority of the candidates of that party.

### Leases/Permits =/= Federal 

#### Granting of leases and permits isn't a 'federal agency activity'---doesn't meet development

**CFR 06** (Code of Federal Regulations, amended January 5, 2006, "15
CFR 930.31 - Federal agency activity,"
http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/15/930.31, alp)

\(a\) The term "[Federal agency activity" means any functions performed
by or on behalf of a Federal agency in the exercise of its statutory
responsibilities]{.underline}. The term ["Federal agency activity"
includes a range of activities where a Federal agency makes a proposal
for action initiating an activity or series of activities when coastal
effects are reasonably foreseeable]{.underline}, e.g., a Federal
agency\'s proposal to physically alter coastal resources, a plan that is
used to direct future agency actions, a proposed rulemaking that alters
uses of the coastal zone. "[Federal agency activity" does not include
the issuance of a federal license or permit to an applicant or
person]{.underline} (see subparts D and E of this part) [or the granting
of federal assistance to an applicant agency]{.underline} (see subpart F
of this part). (b) [The term federal "development project" means a
Federal agency activity involving the planning, construction,
modification,]{.underline} or removal [of public works, facilities, or
other structures, and includes the acquisition, use, or disposal of any
coastal use or resource.]{.underline}

#### Licensing of private development is distinct from federal development

**Bender 14** -- operating division of the LexisNexis Group, publishes
analytic legal research information authored by experts in the legal
community (Matthew & co., Water and Water Rights, 4-39 Waters and Water
Rights § 39.02, "§ 39.02. Special Problems in Project Planning,
Construction and Operation," Lexis)

[Section 470f]{.underline} to date [has had its greatest impact on
[federal licensing of **private development**]{.mark}]{.underline},22
and additional federal statutes have been enacted to increase the
control of federal agencies over private use of archaeological
resources.23 [[With regard to federal development of its own
projects]{.underline}]{.mark}, additional
[[protection]{.underline}]{.mark} for historic and archaeological
interests [[may be afforded]{.mark}]{.underline} under NEPA24 [[or
specific authorization statutes]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} and in 1986
the Secretary of the Army was generally authorized to "preserve, restore
and maintain" historic properties located within water project
boundaries that are in the National Register of Historic Places.25

#### Permitting doesn't mean it's federal

Counsel, Griffin Industries LLC

(Bradley, ALI-ABA COURSE OF STUDY MATERIALS, "Wetlands Law and
Regulation," Cosponsored by the ABA Section of Environment, Energy, and
Resources and the Environmental Law Institute, Lexis)

[See Colorado River Indian Tribes v. Marsh]{.underline}, 605 F. Supp.
1425 (C.D. Cal. 1985); [Sierra Club v. Marsh]{.underline}, 769 F.2d 868
(1st Cir. 1985). [These cases were cited]{.underline} by the EPA as
support [for]{.underline} its objections to [the]{.underline} Corps\'
[proposed scope of]{.underline} analysis [regulations]{.underline} in
1984. In the former case, a developer planning a 156-acre residential
and commercial development applied for a Corps permit to stabilize an
adjacent river bank, which was necessary for the development to proceed.
The court there required the private development to be evaluated in the
NEPA document as a likely occurrence resulting from the issuance of a
permit. See, generally, 605 F. Supp. at 1428-1434. The latter involved
the proposed construction of a causeway from the mainland to an island,
and required the NEPA analysis to include among the effects of permit
issuance the industrial development on the island that would be
stimulated by construction of the causeway. 769 F.2d at 877-78. As noted
by the Corps in its response to EPA\'s objections: [[These cases did not
hold]{.underline}]{.mark} the Corps [[permits \"federalized\"
the]{.underline}]{.mark} unregulated [[private development so as to
render the private action Federal]{.underline}]{.mark} actions for NEPA
purposes. Rather, among the numerous legal problems found by each court,
the cases required the Corps to consider the private development likely
to occur as a result of the issuance of the Corps permit. Such analysis
is part of an accepted NEPA requirement to consider the environmental
effects of Federal action . . . . Quoted in Colorado River Indian
Tribes, 605 F. Supp. at 1428-34; see also Landmark West! v. U.S. Postal
Service, 840 F. Supp. 994, 1010 (S.D.N.Y. 1993) (skyscraper not indirect
effect of Postal Service participation in project where building would
be built regardless of Postal Service decision); Natural Resources
Defense Council v. EPA, 822 F.2d 104, 121 n.27 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (impacts
of siting of private facility are not \"effects\" of EPA issuance of
NPDES permit). Cf. Greater Yellowstone Coalition v. Flowers, 359 F.3d
1257, 1272 n.15 (10th Cir. 2004): The appeals court observed that the
distinction made in the NEPA/404 scope of analysis between the impacts
of permitted discharges and those of independent upland developments (as
set forth in Wetlands Action Network and Sylvester) does not properly
apply to the alternatives analysis under Section 404. In this case, the
court observed that, although portions of the subject residential and
golf development located on uplands were arguably independent of the
portions for which a Section 404 permit was required, the Corps\'
404(b)(1) analysis properly took into account the impact of the
development as a whole on bald eagle nesting and foraging habitat,
including upland areas, because that habitat is part of the overall
\"aquatic ecosystem,\" which must be considered under the 404(b)(1)
Guidelines.

### Federal land = Private 

#### Use of federal lands is private development

**Craig 13** -- William H. Leary Professor of Law, University of Utah
S.J. Quinney College of Law

(Robert, "From the 35th Public Land Law Conference: Balancing Act and
Paradigm Shift: The Role of Public Lands in America\'s Energy Future:
Oceans: Treating Offshore Submerged Lands as Public Lands: A Historical
Perspective," 34 Pub. Land & Resources L. Rev. 51, Lexis)

Nevertheless, in the context of natural resource - and especially
energy - development, [Congress views the OCS as federal public lands on
which **private**]{.underline} mineral [**development** is to be
encouraged]{.underline}. While oil spills and environmental concerns
have tempered the offshore oil rush since 1953, Congress has never
fundamentally changed the idea embedded in the OCSLA that [the federal
government holds the OCS primarily for disposal to private
development]{.underline} of petroleum, natural gas, and other minerals.
As such, the OCS comprises federal lands for which, at least until
reservation or withdrawal, the United States can dispose of private
property interests, rendering the OCS meaningfully indistinguishable
from any other federal public lands.

###  AT//Leads to Private Development

#### Action that facilitates private development still violates 'its'

**Conboy 93** -- Judge on United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York

(Kenneth, "Landmark West! v. United States Postal Serv.," 840 F. Supp.
994, Lexis)

Conclusion

As the USPS has emphasized, [the ubiquitous actions and inactions of
federal agencies affect]{.underline} the likelihood of [private
undertakings]{.underline}, as well as their benefits and burdens, [in
innumerable ways]{.underline}. In this context, [it would make no sense
to require federal agencies to assess the]{.underline} environmental
[impact of private actions over which they have no
**control**]{.underline}, [solely on the basis of the]{.underline}
incidental [effects of federal action on the private
action]{.underline}. Fortunately, there is no indication that in
enacting NEPA Congress intended to do so.¶ [In this case, the
USPS]{.underline} has [participated]{.underline}, on an arms-length
basis, [in a **private development**]{.underline}. Factually, [its
actions were]{.underline} merely incidental to the private development
and, [legally]{.underline}, the development has been [insulated
from]{.underline} USPS [control]{.underline}. Accordingly, this Court
holds \"reasonable under the circumstances\" the USPS\'s implicit
determination that the environmental impact of the Project as a whole
did not have to be considered in the environmental assessment underlying
the FONSI.

###  AT//Funded By Government 

#### Federal funding doesn't change ownership---that's the key variable 

**Paget 7** -- JD, long and widely recognized as one of this country\'s
leading practitioners of environmental law and litigation

(David, ALI-ABA COURSE OF STUDY MATERIALS Environmental Impact
Assessment: NEPA and Related Requirements Cosponsored by the
Environmental Law Institute, Lexis)//BB

\- [Nonfederal Projects Eligible For Federal Assistance]{.underline}¶ -
Citizens Alert Regarding the Environment, 102 Fed.Appx. 167, 2004 WL
1336644 (D.C. Cir. June 15, 2004). [The plaintiffs sought an injunction
to prohibit the construction of a sewer pipeline]{.underline} by the
Jefferson Township Sewer Authority [until after EPA completed its
review]{.underline} of the project pursuant to NEPA. [The federal action
in question was a proposed]{.underline} \$ 1.5 million [grant from
EPA]{.underline}. Most funding for the \$ 15 million project had come
from the State of Pennsylvania, which in turn had received a grant
through a state-administered revolving fund program funded by EPA.¶ At
the time of the suit, EPA\'s direct grant had not yet been issued
pending review of the project under NEPA. The Authority decided to begin
construction, using the state revolving fund grant. Plaintiffs sought an
injunction barring any construction until EPA completed its NEPA
review.¶ [The D.C. Circuit held that EPA\'s participation was not
substantial enough to federalize the entire project. First]{.underline},
with respect to the state revolving fund, **[EPA lacked substantial
control]{.underline}** over the distribution of funds by the state. The
plaintiffs challenged EPA\'s approval of Pennsylvania\'s program for
disbursing the funds, but this challenge was time-barred under the
six-year statute of limitations for actions against the United States,
as the approval had occurred in 1991.¶ [The court went on to hold that
the direct grant by EPA was also **insufficient to federalize the
project,** because the withholding of the grant would present no legal
impediment to the sewer]{.underline} pipeline, which was under the
discretionary jurisdiction of state and local agencies. Nor would the
denial of the funding prevent construction of the sewer line as a
practical matter, as it represented only a small fraction of the overall
cost of the project.
