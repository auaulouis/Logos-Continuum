# Neg\-\--Counterplan\-\--Cooperation

This file is designed to have advocates for a variety of different
scenarios that you can read as planks to a cooperation CP. Some solve
arms racing, some create general engagement, some have internal net
benefits. These cards are largely designed to be read alongside an
encirclement DA against a military affirmative and also rely on winning
that Russia will behave positively toward cooperative activities. The
appeasement DA is a natural answer to the CP mechanism, so I didn't
include any of those cards in this file since they already exist.

Russia Policy: An Agenda for the Trump Administration \| Russia
Matters." Russiamatters.org, 2025,
[www.russiamatters.org/analysis/toward-new-russia-policy-agenda-trump-administration](http://www.russiamatters.org/analysis/toward-new-russia-policy-agenda-trump-administration).\]//neev

The Agenda 

The agenda should be broad, given the scope of geopolitical competition
and each country's importance to the resolution of urgent transnational
issues.

Given Russia's blunt, aggressive negotiating style,[ skill, patience,
tenacity, and
resolve](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5048428-trump-russia-relations/) will
be required to make progress. Initial expectations should be low, given
the mutual lack of trust. Success should not be measured in the number
of maximal goals achieved. Rather, the task is to accumulate incremental
advantages over time and to limit the damage of inevitable setbacks in
pursuit of the United States' broader vision of a just and stable global
order. 

Expanding on an[ earlier
proposal](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5048428-trump-russia-relations/),
a [[notional agenda]{.underline}]{.mark} could look as follows:

**[[Strategic Stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The [[two countries share]{.underline}]{.mark} an abiding [[interest in
avoiding]{.underline}]{.mark} **[nuclear [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The nuclear [[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} architecture, which was
built up during the Cold War largely based on bilateral U.S.-Russian
treaties, will [[end with]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[expiration]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[New START agreement]{.underline}]{.mark} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
February [[2026]{.underline}]{.mark}. While there is insufficient time
and likely interest to negotiate a follow-on treaty, the two countries
still need to discuss how to manage the nuclear equation going forward.
A combination of parallel unilateral steps, tacit codes of conduct, and
bilateral agreements regarding distinct elements of the nuclear
relationship, all monitored by national technical means, might prove the
best possible option for the moment.     

Eurasian Security

Both the United States and Russia have a keen interest in the future
Eurasian security ecosystem---Russia because of the long history of
invasions by Eurasian great powers, the United States because only the
domination of the most advanced regions of the supercontinent by a
hostile power could pose a serious threat to its security. The challenge
will be to develop a set of understandings on how to promote peace,
stability, and security in discrete subregions---Europe, the Middle
East, Northeast Asia, and the Arctic---that can be combined to form an
overarching security ecosystem for the supercontinent.    

Europe-Ukraine 

Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine dealt a fatal blow to European
security as a cooperative effort between Russia and the West. The
immediate task is to develop a framework for future European security
that reduces the risk of conflict along the NATO-Russia frontier and
defines the limits of non-threatening interference in the domestic
affairs of other countries (on the assumption that in an interconnected
world, some interference is inevitable). This framework will set the
parameters for the steps needed to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war.  

**[[Sanctions]{.mark} ]{.underline}**

The [[Russians]{.underline}]{.mark} will [[insist on
discussing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates' **[[anti-Russian
sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Despite repeated boasts that Russia
has thwarted them and grown stronger, the reality is that [[they
have]{.underline}]{.mark} [[distorted]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[econ]{.underline}]{.mark}omy and raised obstacles to long-term growth.
As a rule, the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates should only **[[offer
relief]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} discrete sets
of [[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[in
exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} concrete
[[steps by Russia that advance American goals]{.underline}]{.mark} on
strategic or geopolitical matters.      

### Solvency\-\--New START\-\--2NC

The New START treaty [limits]{.underline} nuclear warheads AND fosters
[cooperation]{.underline}.

On April 8, 2010, in Prague, Presidents Obama and Medvedev signed the
**[[New START Treaty]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a strategic [[offensive
arms reduction]{.underline}]{.mark} treaty to follow-up on the START
Treaty, which expired on December 5, 2009.  The New START Treaty
[[reduces]{.underline}]{.mark} limits on [[U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}. and
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n deployed **[[strategic
warheads]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} approximately
[[one third]{.underline}]{.mark}.  The Treaty provides the flexibility
needed for the United States to structure its forces at the reduced
level to meet national security and operational requirements.\
\
 The Treaty limits each side to 1550 deployed strategic warheads, 700
deployed strategic delivery vehicles, and 800 deployed and non-deployed
ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers and heavy bombers equipped with nuclear
armaments.  The Treaty has a **[[strong verification
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}** to allow each party to
[[confirm]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [[other
party]{.underline}]{.mark} is **[[in compliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[treaty limits]{.underline}]{.mark},
including on-site inspections, data exchanges, exhibitions, and
notifications about the movement and production of strategic systems, as
well as a provision on non-interference with National Technical Means of
verification.\
\
In their June 24 Joint Statement on Strategic Stability, President Obama
and President Medvedev acknowledged their commitment to continuing the
development of a **[[new strategic relationship]{.underline}]{.mark}**
based on [[mutual trust, openness, predictability and
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} by following up on the New START
Treaty.

to [[increase trade and investment relations with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, which could help build a foundation for a
more sustainable relationship. While Moscow's decisions about its
business and investment climate---for example, to strengthen rule of law
and tackle corruption---are the most important factor in this regard,
Congress should now **[[graduate Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[provisions of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[Jackson-Vanik]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[amendment]{.underline}]{.mark}, an action that is long overdue.

### Solvency\-\--Jackson-Vanik\-\--2NC

#### Repealing the Jackson-Vanik [agreement]{.underline} is the [only way]{.underline} to solve [international trade]{.underline}.

**Pomeranz '11** \[William; Senior Fellow and Former Director at the

Ludmila Alexeeva emphasized that the **[[Jackson-Vanik
Amendment]{.underline}]{.mark}** still upheld a fundamental human right
-- the right to travel -- that remains as relevant today as it was
during the Cold War. While no one supported the amendment\'s outright
repeal, several speakers questioned its immediate relevance to
post-Soviet Russia which was (nominally) a market economy and, more
importantly, allowed for unrestricted emigration rights. According to
Blake Marshall, Jackson-Vanik had served its original purpose and its
continuing application to Russia was both \"anachronistic\" and a
distortion of the amendment\'s legislative intent. Marshall added that
[[if Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} were to [[accede
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[WTO]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[without]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[lifting]{.underline}]{.mark} of

### Solvency\-\--CBMs\-\--1NC

#### US and Russian confidence building measures prevent military miscalc\-\--that escalates

//CGP

Alongside clear responses, [**trust**- and **confidence**-**building**
measures are essential. For example, improving regular
military-to-military contacts between the United States and Russia will
provide avenues for firm, **predictable**, **consistent**, and clear
**responses**.]{.underline} Currently, the U.S. Congress prohibits
military-to-military cooperation, but not contact. Expanded regular
contacts can help to avoid strategic surprise and initiate the long
process of trust between militaries.

Further, if conditions warrant, the congressional prohibition against
military cooperation could be lifted in certain circumstances. U.S. and
Russian navies might consider a passing exercise (PASSEX), which are
usually conducted to practice communications between ships. [Such
**ship**-to-**ship** **communications** may become more **essential** as
Arctic commercial and **naval** **traffic** increases, and the real risk
of a maritime accident increases. Similarly, another potential area for
cooperation is in maritime search and rescue drills between navies.
Ultimately, if conditions warrant, the United States could consider
re-starting its **good** **will** **visits** to Russian Arctic
**ports**,]{.underline} conducted periodically in the 1990s and 2000s.
As Commander Patrick Kulakowski, the commanding officer of USS Carr,
noted during a port visit to Baltiysk in Kaliningrad, "It is important
that we get to know each other as people. Only then will we ensure
future peace and cooperation between our great nations."87

[A greater appreciation of Russian military theory and geo-economic
interests is critical to **helping** U.S. **policymakers** **grapple**
with the **Arctic**]{.underline}. Such an understanding will help when
crafting informed policy and military strategy as the United States
increases its presence in the Arctic. Firm, predictable, consistent,
[and clear Arctic responses can serve as reminders to Moscow that
Washington will not tolerate destabilizing activities, but may help keep
a **lid** on **escalatory** **responses**]{.underline}.

Improved Oil Spill Response Coordination

As the ice melts, previously inaccessible hydrocarbons can now more
feasibly be extracted by offshore drilling rigs, but this raises the
risk of an oil spill. [The US and Russia share an **interest** in
**preventing oil spills** and in continuing to expand their capacity to
work together effectively]{.underline} under the auspices of Article 13
in the Arctic Council's 2013 "Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil
Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic."

Why?

Oil spills would have negative effects on Arctic fish stocks, research,
and shipping that would damage the interests of all Arctic nations.
Potential research breakthroughs in the fields of environmental science,
biology, and ecology can be lost forever due to oil spills;
transnational fish stocks can be damaged or made poisonous to consume,
and maritime travel through oil spills is dangerous. Article 13, Section
1 of the Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution states that,
"[The Parties shall promote **cooperation** and **coordination** by
endeavoring to carry out joint exercises and training, including
alerting or call-out **exercises**, table-top exercises, equipment
deployment exercises, and other relevant activities]{.underline}."
[Building **interoperability** between US and Russian disaster response
groups can **build trust** by increasing **intergovernmental contact**
and potentially limit the damage of future oil spills]{.underline} by
improving international response times and procedures. Sharing
best-practices and specific technologies can prevent oil spills in the
future from ever occurring, and a framework for doing so has already
been developed by the Arctic Council.

This plan is low risk

[The **apolitical** and largely **civilian nature** of preventing and
responding to oil spills makes **cooperation** on this issue
**attractive**]{.underline} and unlikely to be targeted by domestic
politics in either country. The main risk associated with this plan
comes from the potential export of specific technologies meant to
prevent oil spills from occurring. There is a chance that certain
technologies would also increase Russia's capacity to exploit offshore
hydrocarbons, which would undermine one aspect of current US and EU
sanctions against Russia. The provision of technology is not required to
improve prevention and response capabilities between the US and Russia.
If there are not any technologies that could be exported without
undermining other US foreign policy objections, that provision can be
safely ignored without making cooperation useless.

Improved Fisheries Management

Although previously inaccessible, [climate change is **increasingly
opening up** Arctic waters to the world's **fishing
fleets**]{.underline}. In 2015, due to the lack of knowledge on Arctic
fishing stocks and the fear of overfishing, the five nations bordering
the Arctic Ocean (including the US and Russia along with Canada,
Denmark, and Norway) voluntarily adopted a prohibition on fishing in the
"high seas" of the Arctic until further notice (this does not affect
fishing within any country's territorial or Exclusive Economic Zone
waters, where fishing has occurred for many decades). [Since then, there
has been an international effort to establish a binding agreement to
**safeguard Arctic waters**]{.underline} until its ecology is better
understood. [It is within the interest of both the US and Russia to
ensure that a **binding agreement is adopted** so that the Arctic's rich
fish stocks do not get destroyed by overfishing.]{.underline}

Why?

Without a binding agreement to mandate and enforce a prohibition on
fishing in the Arctic high seas, there is a real risk that fishing
fleets in waters not covered by the previous prohibition could devastate
traveling fish stocks through overfishing. A similar issue occurred in
the 1980's when a "donut hole" of international waters in the Bering Sea
resulted in a massive crash in fish populations. Protecting fish
populations throughout Arctic waters until sustainable fishing practices
can be established, or until clear legal rights to all Arctic waters is
established, is essential to maximizing the long-term economic gains for
the American and Russian fishing industries. Additionally, preserving
the ecology of those waters is important for ecological and biological
research.

[A binding agreement **temporarily banning Arctic fishing** can also
serve as a future framework for common fishing practices to avoid a
situation where uncoordinated national fishing policies lead to the
inadvertent overfishing]{.underline} of transboundary stocks. While the
current prohibition has been effective, its non-binding status means
that the cooperation could give out unexpectedly to the detriment of
American interests.

This plan is low risk

Arctic cooperation has historically been resilient to growing tension in
other arenas between the US and Russia, and [this particular policy area
is **relatively apolitical and requires cooperation** to
succeed]{.underline}. The penalties for cheating in arrangements to
prevent overfishing have a very high chance of ultimately resulting in
overfishing, the destruction of fish stocks, and the near-complete loss
of economic and scientific benefits for all countries. Furthermore,
there is no current fishing within the high seas area of the Arctic, so
there remains time. Given the costs associated with cheating, the
historical precedence for US-Russian cooperation in this area, and the
potential benefits that require cooperation, this is an ideal area for
US-Russian cooperation.

Joint Research Initiatives

[The US and Russia should pursue **joint research initiatives** in the
Arctic that would be **mutually beneficial** to both
countries]{.underline}. One possible research initiative could be
expanding support for the Russian-American Long-term Census of the
Arctic (RUSALCA), which has been ongoing since 2004.

Why?

Th[e Arctic holds important opportunities for advancing the fields of
**biology**, environmental **science**, **ecology**, **oceanography**
and **geology**]{.underline} that could lead to a more robust
understanding of climate change, discovery of new fuel reserves, and the
improvement of best practices in the fields of deep sea extraction,
fishing, and shipping. [These fields are likely to yield **economic and
scientific benefits** for both countries, and are not likely to have a
military dimension that would otherwise lead to further
competition]{.underline}. Historically, research agreements have served
as important platforms for trust building and as a channel for track-two
talks between the two powers. Expanding the number of research
agreements would increase these diplomatic dividends while also
providing beneficial research. The agreements can also function as an
additional lever of influence; judging by significant shifts in its
security policies, Russia has demonstrated a greater interest in the
Arctic than the US, which means that research agreements regarding the
Arctic are relatively more value to them than to the US. This can
potentially be used as a negotiating carrot.

This plan is low risk

[Arctic research is **difficult to militarize** and research agreements
can be **tailored to specific topics** that are not dual-use in any way
shape or form]{.underline}. Just as the US could hypothetically threaten
to end a research agreement as a foreign policy response, Russia could
also make similar threats. Russia's greater apparent interest in the
Arctic means that they would have relatively more to lose from ending
any such agreements, which means that it would be less likely to pursue
such an option.

Improved Search-and-Rescue Coordination

[The US and Russia should pursue increased cooperation in **establishing
search-and-rescue interoperability**]{.underline} in Arctic waters
through the auspices of Article 9, Section 3 of the "Agreement on
Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the
Arctic". This cooperation should take the form of joint exercises to
build contacts between both countries' maritime forces and reduce risk
in future emergency situations.

Why?

Running search-and-rescue exercises between [the US and Russia can
**build trust and relationships** between the two forces that can reduce
risk in future situations]{.underline}. Russia has an extensive body of
knowledge on carrying out Arctic maritime operations, especially ones
which may require the use of ice breakers, that could benefit US
search-and-rescue operations, Additionally, because this cooperation
would be carried out under the auspices of a pre-existing agreement and
the mission is humanitarian in nature, it should not be politically
costly to pursue.

This plan carries some risks

Russia remains sensitive to increases in US military assets in the
Arctic, but the use of Coast Guard assets for the purposes of a
Russo-American search-and-rescue exercise should not result in further
degradation of American-Russo relations. Any such exercises will be used
by the Russia to gather intelligence on US capabilities, but they will
also provide a similar opportunity to the US. That being said, the US
can minimize this risk by ensuring any assets deployed to the exercises
do not contain sensitive equipment, intelligence, or capabilities. This
could mean completely restricting the use of unmanned aircraft
technology.

#### Cooperation over energy projects (hydrocarbons) is good.

**Busvine '25** \[Douglas; February 18; Europe's Agriculture & Trade

[Russia and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[discussed **possible cooperation** on energy projects in the Arctic at
a meeting in Saudi Arabia]{.underline} Tuesday, a top Russian negotiator
told POLITICO.

[Kirill **Dmitriev**]{.underline}, who heads the state-owned Russian
Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), [said the **economic conversations** had
been about **broad strokes**]{.underline}, but that the two sides had
discussed some "specific areas of cooperation."

"It was more a general discussion --- maybe joint projects in the
Arctic. [We specifically **discussed** the **Arctic**]{.underline},"
[Dmitriev said]{.underline} by phone as he boarded a flight home after
the talks in Riyadh.

The negotiations, which sidelined Ukraine and Europe, have sparked angst
and urgency in key European capitals as U.S. President Donald Trump and
Russian leader Vladimir Putin look set to decide on Ukraine's future
without substantial input from Kyiv or its Western allies.

For his part, [Trump aims to **expand American influence** in the
Arctic]{.underline}, having repeatedly mused about acquiring Greenland
from Denmark --- and has refused to rule out using military force or
economic coercion to seize control of the massive island with its vast
mineral wealth and key strategic location.

U.S. oil major [**ExxonMobil** had partnered with Russian state oil
major **Rosneft** to explore for **hydrocarbons** in the high
Arctic]{.underline}, [but **pulled out** in 2018 following the
**imposition** of Western **sanctions**]{.underline} in response to
Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

Dmitriev was part of a Russian delegation that included Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov and was in
Saudi Arabia for initial discissions on Ukraine. Tuesday's talks were
the first contact between officials from the two sides following a call
between Trump and Putin last week.

He commented on the economic track of the talks, which he described as
good, but declined to go into detail on the political discussions.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S. delegation, accompanied by
National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve
Witkoff.

"Positive after the Biden administration destroyed all of the
communication, destroyed all of the discussion," he said.

In further remarks, Dmitriev said he had presented an estimate by the
RDIF that [U.S. **businesses** had lost around **\$300 billion** as a
result of **leaving Russia**]{.underline} following Putin's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

"There is an understanding that [**bad relations** between Russia and
the U.S. actually **cost a lot** to American business]{.underline}, and
there are ways to have productive cooperation benefit both Russia and
the U.S." he said.

"I would not want to have unrealistic expectations for the process going
forward, but I think [**joint investments** between Russia and the U.S.
are now **more likely** after this meeting than
**before**]{.underline}," he added.

On next steps, Dmitriev said [the **two sides** had **agreed** to set up
**working groups** and have regular high-level
**contacts**]{.underline}. No further meetings have yet been scheduled.

The RDIF was set up in 2011 to partner with foreign investors on
projects in Russia, and later backed a Covid-19 vaccine. The sovereign
fund was sidelined following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as
foreign investors pulled out or scaled back their exposure to Russia.
Shortly before Putin ordered in Russian troops, the RDIF issued a
statement calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

#### Russia [wants]{.underline} to monetize their energy resources.

What Are the Key Areas for US-Russia Business Cooperation?

[The]{.underline} potential [**post-war** economic **relationship**
between the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**Russia** centers around two strategic sectors]{.underline} that could
reshape global markets: [**energy** and **critical
minerals**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} areas
[represent]{.underline} both [geopolitical **leverage** and economic
**opportunity**]{.underline} in a complex international landscape where
US-Russia joint business in energy and metals could fundamentally alter
supply chains and regional influence.

Energy Sector Collaboration

The energy partnership framework being discussed involves unprecedented
cooperation across multiple domains. [**Joint projects** in the Arctic
region for oil and gas exploration **stand** at the
**forefront**]{.underline}, with [American **companies** potentially
gaining **access** to some of the world\'s largest **untapped**
**hydrocarbon reserves**]{.underline}. Before Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine, the country exported approximately 155 billion cubic meters of
natural gas annually to Europe, creating a massive supply gap when
imports were reduced by over 80% following the conflict.

[American **involvement** in Russian natural gas deliveries to Europe
represents a **significant pivot** in energy **diplomacy**]{.underline}.
The proposal includes [potential **US participation** in Gazprom PJSC
projects]{.underline}, [which could **revitalize** stalled
**initiatives** like Nord Stream 2]{.underline}. This pipeline, halted
in 2022, had the capacity to supply 55 billion cubic meters annually to
European markets.

Perhaps most controversial is the [proposed US **control** of Ukraine\'s
**Zaporizhzhia** Nuclear Power Plant]{.underline}, currently under
Russian occupation. [This facility]{.underline}, which [generated
**20%** of Ukraine\'s **electricity**]{.underline} before the war,
[would operate under **American management**]{.underline} with its
electrical output distributed to both Russia and Ukraine. Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has expressed concerns about this
arrangement, noting that \"US management of Zaporizhzhia requires
Ukrainian technical expertise, raising security and access concerns.\"

The restoration of Russia\'s energy exports to Europe with American
investor participation could reshape European energy security. However,
this faces headwinds from the EU\'s REPowerEU plan, which aims to phase
out 90% of Russian fossil fuels by 2027 through \$300 billion in
alternative infrastructure investments.

Critical Minerals and Rare Earth Elements

The second pillar of potential cooperation focuses on [**r**are
**e**arth **m**ineral**s** and **critical
metals**]{.underline}---resources essential for the clean energy
transition and advanced manufacturing. China currently dominates this
space, accounting for 60% of global rare earth production, while [Russia
possesses significant **undeveloped reserves**]{.underline}.

[**US investment** in Russia\'s **Tomtor** deposit in Yakutia represents
a **strategic opportunity** to counter Chinese market
control]{.underline}. This deposit contains approximately 19% of the
world\'s niobium reserves, critical for aerospace alloys and
superconducting magnets. [**Development stalled** in 2022 when
**sanctions** blocked access to Western extraction
technology]{.underline}. The remote Yakutia location requires an
estimated \$2 billion in infrastructure investments before full-scale
operations can begin.

This collaboration addresses China\'s growing dominance in the
sector---Russia\'s trade with China reached \$146 billion in 2021,
approximately 70 times larger than the \$36 billion in US-Russia trade
during the same period. By developing stalled projects requiring
technologies currently restricted by sanctions, both nations could
establish a counterbalance to Chinese critical mineral export
restrictions.

[**Putin\'s** November **order** to ensure **development** of
**Tomtor**]{.underline}, either by current owners or with help from
other investors, [signals Russian **eagerness** to **monetize** these
resources]{.underline}. If sanctions on dual-use technologies are
lifted, AI-driven exploration tools could potentially reduce development
costs by 25%, making the project more economically viable.

climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, [Kirill
**Dmitriev**]{.underline}, [CEO of the Russian Direct Investment
Fund]{.underline}, [**named** the region as a **potential setting** for
US-Russia cooperation]{.underline}: "We need to pursue joint projects,
including, for example, in the Arctic." The Arctic region makes sense as
a setting for cooperation as t[he two sides have explicitly **expressed
interest** in exploring **cooperation** in **energy**, **investment**,
and **geopolitical** issues]{.underline}. Western sanctions on Russia
have led Moscow to step up its cooperation in the Arctic with China in
joint energy ventures and grand plans for Arctic shipping. [US officials
now see **Arctic cooperation** as a potential **means** to "**drive a
wedge**" between **Moscow** and **Beijing**]{.underline}.

In my meetings in Moscow with American and Russian [diplomats and
**businessmen**]{.underline} over the past few weeks, it is clear that
many [are **interested** in diverse forms of Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}, from cultural diplomacy that celebrates the
commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the Bering Strait,
to scientific diplomacy to understand and adapt to climate hazards faced
by both nations. Business interests, however, are at the top of the
agenda.

[Trump's **suggestion** to **acquire Greenland**]{.underline}, not
ruling out military or economic coercion, [has
**reignited**]{.underline} global [**concerns** over Arctic
stability]{.underline}. Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally,
have caused alarm in the Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian
state media pundits celebrated Trump's statements, [Russian **diplomats
criticized** the **destabilizing** effect of the
**proposal**]{.underline} and said that [Trump's plan]{.underline} "[can
only bring **uncertainty** and **tension** to the region]{.underline}."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear [that **r**are
**e**arth **m**inerals are a **key focus** of Trump's political
**worldview**]{.underline}. Greenland has large deposits of rare earth
elements and is strategically positioned alongside Arctic shipping lanes
and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer to open Russian rare earth
minerals to joint exploration with the US may also have implications for
Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

[The announced plan to **revamp diplomatic relations** and **restore**
the staff of the countries' **diplomatic missions** will significantly
**reduce** the current **obstacles** to US-Russia]{.underline}
scientific [cooperation]{.underline} in the Arctic. By making it easier
to issue visas and travel between the two countries, Americans and
Russians will again be able to conduct joint research, expeditions, and
scientific conferences and build models to better understand the
unfolding climate emergency. [Scientific **cooperation** to
**understand** the changes affecting **sea ice**, **permafrost**,
**ecosystems**, and local communities has been **blunted** by the
political fallout of the war in Ukraine]{.underline}.

[Cooperation]{.underline} in the Arctic [can help build **regional
stability**]{.underline}. More importantly, Arctic cooperation will
[build **trust** between the US and Russia that could]{.underline}
complement or [**spill over** into]{.underline} other crucial fields of
cooperation such as [**arms control**, Middle East peace, and **global
health**]{.underline}.

American Grand Strategy

The 2009 [**[Arctic]{.mark}** Region [Policy]{.mark}]{.underline}
shifted away from the apathetic post-Cold War US Arctic strategy,
[recogniz[in]{.mark}g]{.underline} the [Arctic as an emerging critical
region but only identified two focal points: **[energy]{.mark}** and
security]{.underline}.19) The 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic
Region was comprehensive, addressing the Pillars of security, climate
change/environmental protection, sustainable development, and
international governance. [Changes in the physical, financial, and
geopolitical landscape have shifted American grand strategy in the
Arctic, **[end]{.mark}ing** the previous three decades of
**[stability]{.mark}** following the Cold War [and reflect]{.mark}ing
rising [**geopolitical tensions** between **Russia**]{.mark} and Arctic
stakeholders.]{.underline}

Energy

Th[e [US]{.mark} is [vested]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the Arctic's [**oil**
and]{.mark} natural **[gas]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with Alaska's Prudhoe
Bay Oil Field being North America's most prominent; in the 2000s,
Prudhoe Bay typically produced about 8% of America's domestic oil.20)
The importance of Arctic oil to America's energy independence was
demonstrated in 2006 when a leak in a critical pipeline at Prudhoe Bay
forced the line's shutdown while the US and Iran were in a dispute. At
the same time, [tensions in the Middle East made it difficult for the US
to buy reasonably priced foreign oil.]{.underline} The total cost of oil
increased 3% domestically.21)

The 2009 Arctic Region Policy [aimed to increase US oil independence by
accessing Alaskan oil deposits]{.underline}. While it received support
from energy independence advocates, it was [also [met with
**resistance**]{.mark} from environmentalists, thus hindering
implementation]{.underline}.22) This debate persisted over the years,
shaping subsequent approaches to Arctic resource development. The [Trump
administration]{.underline} (2021) [issued drilling leases on more than
400,000 acres in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge]{.underline}.23) In contrast, the 2022 National Strategy for the
Arctic acknowledges the region's economic reliance on hydrocarbon
production while advocating for economic diversification, a transition
to green energy and environmental protection.24) In 2024, the US
Department of the Interior denied commercial access to a copper deposit
through Gates of the Arctic National Park. It banned oil drilling in
half of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.25) Environmentalists and
tribal leaders praised these decisions, but Alaska's officials
criticized them.26)

The [relationship between environmentalism and energy
[complicates]{.mark} the US grand [strategy]{.mark} in the Arctic,
[creating inconsistency]{.mark}]{.underline} due to fluctuating
politics, public opinion, and stakeholder support. This [[makes
**long-term planning**]{.mark} for Arctic energy
**[difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as leadership changes can shift
priorities between resource extraction and environmental protections and
alter the trajectory of US Arctic strategy[. Such volatility hampers
coherent, long-term policies]{.underline} essential for the region's
energy security and ecological sustainability, making it a contentious
issue influenced by electoral outcomes and shifting public opinion.

#### 3. U.S energy expansion cuts off any U.S-Russia cooperation\-\--it jolts Russia's economy.

On Ice", https://fpa.org/energy-keep-us-russia-ties-ice/\]

Tillerson has also previously expressed his skepticism with regard to
the sanctions imposed on Russia. Indeed, the sanctions just so happened
to stall a massive investment framework that Tillerson had negotiated.
The Wall Street Journal reported in 2011 that [Tillerson worked on a
\$500 billion **[Arctic]{.mark}** oil contract]{.underline} between
ExxonMobil, the Kremlin, and the Russian state-owned Rosneft oil
company.

At Exxon's 2014 annual meeting, Mr. Tillerson said: "We do not support
sanctions, generally, because we don't find them to be effective unless
they are very well implemented comprehensibly, and that's a very hard
thing to do." That statement was made before the Obama administration
leveled new sanctions against nine Russian entities, restricted access
to two properties in the U.S. and removed Russian individuals.

How will the new secretary of state and President handle U.S.-Russia
relations going forward?

Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)[Despite Mr. Trump's current efforts to
rekindle a collegial relationship with Russia, natural [gas]{.mark}
could [lead to **conflicts** during]{.mark} the potential
[**reconciliation** efforts]{.mark}. Natural [gas]{.mark} exports
provide a [major]{.mark} stream of [revenues for **Russia's economy**
and any further **jolt** will affect]{.mark} its already struggling
[finances]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Today, about 30% of the world's consumed gas is traded internationally.
[**Russia** is a **dominant supplier** of natural gas to
Europe,]{.underline} which is something many European nations have been
working to move away from (it is important, however, to note that
Germany has moved forward with the Nord-Stream 2 pipeline). Russia's
proven natural gas reserves, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration (EIA) data, are the largest in the world with nearly
1,688 trillion cubic feet (tcf)---compared to Iran's 1,201 tcf and
Qatar's 866 tcf.

However, as experienced in 2006 and 2009 in Eastern
[Europe]{.underline}, Russia can limit the amount it exports despite
contracts, during times of turmoil and turn off the figurative spigot.
This background threat further stimulated the desire for those nations
to [search for alternative sources in order to reduce their reliance on
Russian gas.]{.underline}

The **[[LNG]{.underline}]{.mark}** market could provide a solution.
Indeed, [it eliminates the need for sprawling pipeline networks and
[**reduces energy reliance** on **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. LNG is
natural gas that undergoes a liquefaction process at specially
constructed plants, is loaded on special tankers and shipped to
regasification terminals where the new energy feedstock can be
distributed to consumers. The global market for LNG increased about 7%
per year between 2000-2012, according to Ernst and Young. LNG export
capacity is forecast to increase by 45% between 2015 and 2021, 90% of
which would originate from the U.S. and Australia, according to the
International Energy Agency (IEA).

The [American LNG industry]{.underline} is in its infancy stages but, as
noted by the IEA forecast, is predicted to [grow [and]{.mark} increase
market competition]{.underline}. Advocates believe Trump will expedite
the current permitting and approval process where about 30 applications
are pending (there is 1 operating export terminal in Louisiana---Sabine
Pass---and others in the Gulf Coast and Maryland under construction).

The EIA states that by 2020, the U.S. is set to become the world's
third-largest LNG producer, after Australia and Qatar. This is where the
rub with Russia could start, granted it would take years to develop a
large industry. Indeed, the [U.S. increased natural gas supply on the
international market would **cut** into Russia's **market
share**.]{.underline}

In the past, it was thought that increasing consumption of natural gas
in Europe would mean greater reliance on Russia. However, LNG loosens
those constraints. And having the U.S. as a reliable trading partner
could cement that expansion, as the [new natural gas could also serve as
a baseload power supply with the large amount of **[renewables]{.mark}**
being [integrated]{.mark} across Europe to counter the currently
accompanying intermittency]{.underline}. Thus far, the U.S. has exported
to Spain and Portugal with companies capable of establishing floating
LNG terminals in other European markets, as regasification terminals are
costly and are long-term construction projects.

Russia does have LNG plans of its own, but its gas export business will
continue to be pipeline dominant, limiting its flexibility. Today there
are over 30 global markets for LNG, and possibly doubling by 2030. There
is one large LNG project operating in Sakhalin, led by Gazprom, and
construction is underway for a massive LNG facility, Yamal, potentially
with a price tag of \$27 billion, helped with funding from the Chinese.
Even then, Russia still may need to discount their gas price to meet
rising competition.

Shipping

To be transported, as noted, LNG needs a specially designed ship. Thus,
as demand has grown, LNG has added a new dimension to the maritime
industry. Maritime shipping is vital for trade and the global economy.
More than 50,000 ships are in operation around the world, trading across
waterways and carrying 90% of all goods, commodities, and products,
according to the International Maritime Organization. The new vessels
enable LNG to be transported across large swaths of ocean to buyers. Of
course, being able to transform the gas to a liquid eliminates the
constraint of needing a pipeline for transit to specific points.

With LNG being shipped out from the Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana,
the new expansion of the Panama Canal, completed in 2016 after many
delays, can facilitate those vessels and offer competitive prices
enabling efficient transit to Asian markets. Indeed the old Panama Canal
locks were too small for these vessels.

The route provides the ability for a shipment from the Gulf Coast to
Japan to be reduced from the current 34 days to 20. In fact, the Panama
Canal Authority instituted separate tolls for LNG vessels in order to
promote route attractiveness.

Avoiding any need for canals, Europe, and potentially the west coast of
Africa in the future, is a natural fit for LNG shipments leaving the
Gulf Coast and Maryland.

All and all, [with]{.underline} [the increased natural gas demand and
new sources of production, **[U.S]{.mark}. industry** could [**cut**
into Russia's **economic lifeline**]{.mark}, potentially
**[impeding]{.mark}** bridging the sought after closer [national
**ties**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Security

The 2009 US [**[Arctic]{.mark}** Region **[Policy]{.mark}'s** focus on
security has evolved significantly.]{.underline} Previously, the US
emphasized unilateral security and preferred bilateral agreements to
regional cooperation while ignoring Arctic issues.27) Post-Cold War,
Russia expanded its presence in the Arctic, reverting to Cold War norms.
In response, the 2022 [National Strategy]{.underline} now
[**[prioritizes]{.mark}** American people and **[sovereign
territory]{.mark}** and rights, [committing to enhance
capabilities]{.mark} through infrastructure improvements, including an
expanded icebreaker fleet, and strengthening cooperation with Arctic
allies **[against Russia]{.mark}**n aggression.]{.underline}28)

In his 1987 Murmansk speech, Mikhail Gorbachev described the Arctic as a
"peace and cooperation zone," emphasizing collaboration over
competition.29) However during the 2000s, in response to an increased
perception of NATO's Arctic presence and strategic importance, [Russia
began **militarizing** the region, seeking to reclaim its superpower
status]{.underline} after the Soviet Union's collapse.30) By 2019,
Russia had established 14 airfields, six military bases, refurbished 16
Soviet-era deep-water ports, and 10 border posts in the Arctic, with its
Northern Fleet boasting an estimated 120 ships, including 40
icebreakers.31) Russia allowed PRC to construct docks at five of the
most significant ports along Russia's Arctic coastline.32) In contrast,
the US needs to develop a centralized command structure in the Arctic, a
crucial aspect of its security policy.33) It has only one significant
base at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, with two additional bases
south of the Arctic Circle in Alaska.34) The US has only two ocean-going
icebreakers. There is a stark disparity in military presence between
Russia and the US, a potential security dilemma. Russia's action, and
the US's inaction, underscore the Arctic's strategic importance and the
urgency for a comprehensive security strategy.

[[Russia]{.mark} has **[fortified]{.mark}** the **region** to protect
future strategic and economic interests]{.underline}.35) The
[[US]{.mark} has interpreted this as an attempt to achieve regional
dominance, [prompt]{.mark}ing numerous [military operations]{.mark} in
the area.]{.underline}36) [[Moscow **views** US actions as **aggressive

In April this year, the Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said that
Russia "will continue developing its military infrastructure in the
Arctic and on the coast of the Arctic Ocean." According to him, "It is
important to say that the Northern Fleet is constantly practicing
employing fighter aviation from the airfields of the Arctic
archipelagos. The military infrastructure continues to be developed on
Arctic islands and the coastline of the Arctic Ocean".11)

Plausibly, the U.S. and the [[**NATO** allies are set to become
**increasingly** **active** in the region]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S.
contends that [the Arctic is now caught in an economic and [**military**
**competition** from **Moscow**]{.mark} and Beijing.]{.underline} The
emerging role of China in the region12) is also viewed with increasing
suspicion, particularly after the announcement of its news Arctic
policy.13) Beijing's self-styled status as a "near-Arctic state" with
its "Polar Silk Road" project raised new concerns in the West,
particularly in the background of mounting tensions between the U.S and
China.14)

Meanwhile, [[Moscow was **increasingly** **worried**]{.mark} about the
attempts to make the region a potential location [for the **West's**
**military** exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [**Russian**
**Embassy**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Washington [[said:]{.mark} "The
Arctic Challenge [military exercises involving the United States are
"**provocative**]{.mark}," ["do not establish any framework for
**mutual** **trust**]{.mark} in Europe[, and **contradict** (the)
**peaceful**]{.mark} and **sustainable** [development of the
Arctic]{.mark} **region**."]{.underline} The drills are held twice a
year under the auspices of Nordic Defence Cooperation, which included a
contingent of 250 US Marines, ten F/A-18 Hornet multirole combat jets,
as well as KC-130 tankers and transport aircraft. [**Defence**
**Minister** Sergei Shoigu said that a total of 40,000 troops and 15,000
pieces of **weapons** and **equipment**, including strategic
**aviation**, were **"concentrated near Russia's borders**]{.underline}
in the west and south, even as the NATO reconnaissance flights had
doubled in the first three months of 2021 compared to 2020".15)

The [challenge]{.underline} of all this has [not been purely
logistical]{.underline}. As the permafrost thaws, the structural base
for roads, buildings and other [key **infrastructure** has
**collapsed**]{.underline}. **[Russia]{.underline}** is [trying to
**deploy**]{.underline} [huge amounts of]{.underline} infrastructure and
[**military capacity** to build structures]{.underline} on land that [is
disintegrating]{.underline}, across roads that are disappearing. In
December 2022, it passed a new law requiring 90-day notification for any
warship transiting the northern sea route. It has also legislated that
there be no more than one warship allowed in these waters at any one
time and that any submarine be required to surface and show its flag
along the internal waters of the route.

Recent experience in the Pacific suggests that the [US]{.underline} or
Nato will seek to **[assert rights]{.underline}** of navigation under
the UN convention on the law of the sea. This [is inherently
**risky**]{.underline}. [Russia could see]{.underline} such [attempts to
declare freedom]{.underline} of navigation [as a
**provocation**]{.underline}. But failure to enforce these freedoms
carries an opposite risk: without maintaining a presence in the region,
Nato members would be allowing Russia's new law** **to become
normalised. A [**careful balancing** act is **essential**]{.underline}
[to maintain presence]{.underline} and not allow Russia to close off
this region of the Arctic as its private domain.

[**Moscow sees** **Nato** borders expanding]{.underline}. It **[fears
encirclement]{.underline}**. Its experience of [humiliation in
**Ukraine**]{.underline} has [**increased** this
**tension**]{.underline}. Two [Arctic brigades]{.underline} have been
[deployed]{.underline} to Ukraine [with disastrous
consequences]{.underline}; the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies
estimates that more than 1,000 personnel have been lost. As Russia's
conventional land forces have been depleted in the Arctic, the [Kremlin
will turn to]{.underline} its naval and **[submarine
capacity]{.underline}**. The [potential to inflict damage to undersea
cables]{.underline} and pipelines [is a lever]{.underline} that [Putin
could use]{.underline} against his opponents.

At the moment, it seems our politicians are not looking beyond the
Ukraine war. They need to. A weakened and **[resentful
Russia]{.underline}** [does **not** make]{.underline} for [a **stable**
global order]{.underline}. We have already seen Putin pivot to China and
use the Arctic as a bargaining chip to strengthen that relationship. It
is scarcely a month since the two countries' coastguards signed
a memorandum in Murmansk about cooperation in the Arctic. China's price
for providing Russia with support over Ukraine could be requesting naval
access to Russian bases in the Arctic.

On a recent visit to the Ny-Ålesund international research station on
Svalbard, it was depressing to hear that scientific cooperation with
Russia on climate matters has effectively ceased. The [Arctic is an
environment where]{.underline} [**cooperation** is
**essential**]{.underline}. Arctic [science must be]{.underline} done
over the [long term]{.underline}, and the
**[relationships]{.underline}** and trust built up between partners
**[offer]{.underline}** predictability and [greater
**stability**]{.underline}. In a region that is becoming
over-securitised, [**every opportunity** to]{.underline} minimise
accidental misunderstandings and [**avoid** a **military** response
should be seized]{.underline}.

A [militarised Arctic would undermine]{.underline} scientific
[cooperation]{.underline} and [pose an **existential
threat**]{.underline}. Somehow, [we need]{.underline} a [**diplomatic
effort** to separate]{.underline} the [politics of war from]{.underline}
the imperatives of **[climate research]{.underline}**. During the cold
war, the USSR and the west had cultural and scientific exchanges that
kept back-channels of communication open when political temperatures
were running high. Now, more than ever, [we need]{.underline} similar
[initiatives to **thaw**]{.underline} the [**permafrost** between
Russian and western]{.underline} [research efforts]{.underline}.

Sullivan and Burns,» «Naryshkin and Burns,» «Shoigu and Austin,» and
«Gerasimov and Milley.»

Experience of Interaction: Military Conflicts and «Red Telephones»

[**Post-Soviet** [relations]{.mark} between Russia and the United States
have **[weathered]{.mark} [numerous severe
crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly when the two nations found
themselves on opposing sides of armed conflicts. The [2008 war
in **[Georgia]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[Syria]{.mark}n**
conflict,]{.underline} which began in 2015, stand out as vivid examples.
These cases underscored the complexity of diplomatic engagement and the
limited opportunities for coordinating actions, even in critical
situations threatening direct clashes.

During the August [2008 war in Georgia,]{.underline} [**several
[telephone]{.mark} [conversations]{.mark}** took place between Russian
and U.S. leadership]{.underline}. U.S. President George W. Bush and
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev discussed the situation in South
Ossetia and prospects for [[halt]{.mark}ing [military
operations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Initial contacts occurred on August 9,
with [Bush urging Russia to **cease** military actions and respect
Georgia's territorial integrity.]{.underline} [That same day,
**[active]{.mark} [negotiations]{.mark}** [unfolded]{.mark} at the
diplomatic]{.underline} level between U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.

Exchanges between Moscow and Washington continued on August 10 and 11.
During these days, the White House publicly condemned Russia's actions
as «disproportionate,» and Bush emphasized the need for all troops
to return to their pre-August 6 positions. Russia maintained that its
military intervention was a necessary response to Georgian forces'
actions in South Ossetia. In phone calls, Medvedev argued that the
operation aimed at «coercing peace» and protecting Russian citizens.

On August 12, [Medvedev announced the **end** of the military
operation]{.underline}---a decision reportedly discussed in phone
contacts with U.S. leadership, according to some sources. [Washington
continued to press for a **full [withdrawal]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} [Russian forces]{.mark} from Georgia]{.underline} and
adherence to the promised ceasefire. During this period, the Bush
administration [actively engaged **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} allies
and European leaders, including French President Nicolas Sarkozy, [who
**[mediated]{.mark} the [crisis]{.mark}** resolution]{.underline}.

#### And [avoids]{.underline} U.S. Russia war.

[[Avoiding]{.mark} U.S.-Russian Conflict]{.underline}

Avoiding a conflict between the United States and Russia, and
[especially **[nuclear]{.mark} [war]{.mark},** should be]{.underline}
the [**[paramount]{.mark}** U.S. [priority]{.mark} in the bilateral
relationship]{.underline}. Arguably, there is a [much [greater risk
of]{.mark}]{.underline} an **[[inadvertent]{.mark}
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}** between the two countries [arising from an
**accident** or **[miscalculations]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[miscommunications]{.mark}**]{.underline}---for example, a [military
reaction to a **false warning** of attack]{.underline}---than from a
premeditated attack.5 The [highest risks]{.underline} are in the
[**Baltic and Black Sea** regions]{.underline}, [where]{.underline}
[alliance members]{.underline} are [most vulnerable to an
attack]{.underline} with little warning and NATO and Russian forces
operate in close proximity. By the end of the next decade, if not
sooner, [the [alliance]{.mark} [and Russia]{.mark} [should]{.mark}
**mutually [aspire]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [deter]{.mark}rent and
defensive force postures in both regions]{.underline} that have
eliminated or [reduced to near **[zero]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
[[risk]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} between
them. However difficult to imagine, [restoring a measure of
trust]{.underline} is [necessary]{.underline} to improve the bilateral
relationship. One way to do this is for the [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} to
[[restore]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**serious and [strategic]{.mark}**
[high-level]{.mark} [dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline},
[focused]{.underline} initially [on [build]{.mark}ing **[mutual
security]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Euro-Atlantic region.6 The two
sides should address several questions.

[The broader picture of Putin's **duplicity**]{.underline}.

[[The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has]{.mark}
its]{.underline} own long [**historical [record]{.mark}** [of
negotiations with **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which can be summed
up by Ambassador Charles "Chip" Bohlen's famous axiom that [the
fundamental [Russian]{.mark} negotiating [stance
is]{.mark}]{.underline}, "[[What's **mine** is
**mine**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[what's yours is
**negotiable**]{.underline}]{.mark}." The late Secretary of State George
P. Shultz (for whom one of the authors worked as a junior diplomat)
amended Bohlen's adage by declaring that "What's mine is mine, and
what's yours is mine too."

[The Russian **record** of **adherence to accords**
negotiated]{.underline} during or after the Cold War [makes for
**depressing reading** and underscores the necessity of
**vigilance**]{.underline} and prudence [when it comes to **any** effort
to **negotiate**]{.underline} not just an end to the war in Ukraine but
to any broader U.S.-Russian arms control or geopolitical agreements.

During the Cold War, [the **A**nti-**B**allistic **M**issile
Treaty]{.underline}, [along with the **SALT I** agreement]{.underline},
was regarded as the cornerstone of strategic stability, but [the
**USSR** was in **violation**]{.underline} of the treaty for years. Its
[construction of the **Krasnoyarsk Radar** contravened]{.underline} both
[the **letter** and spirit of the **treaty**]{.underline} because it was
built not on the periphery of the country (for defensive purposes,
allowable under the treaty) but in the center (for battle management).
[The Russians]{.underline} for years **[denied]{.underline}** that [the
radar was a treaty violation before finally giving up in
**1989**]{.underline} and dismantling it.

[Under]{.underline} Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**, [[Russia has
**violated**]{.underline}]{.mark} or disregarded [**nine**
separate]{.underline} arms control [[**agreements** and
**treaties**]{.mark} he]{.underline} either [**inherited** or
**signed**]{.underline}, including:

- [The Helsinki Final Act of 1975]{.underline}, also known as [the
  **[Helsinki Accords]{.mark}**]{.underline}, wherein signatories
  pledged not to use military force to change borders in Europe

- [The]{.underline} aforementioned [**[Budapest Memorandum]{.mark}** of
  1994]{.underline}

- [The **[Istanbul Document]{.mark}** of 1999]{.underline} (in which
  [Russia pledged to withdraw its military forces]{.underline} from
  [Georgia and]{.underline} Transnistria in [Moldova]{.underline})

- [The **[P]{.mark}**residential **[N]{.mark}**uclear
  **[I]{.mark}**nitiatives of 1991 and 1992]{.underline} (in which
  [Russia pledged to withdraw]{.underline} from [active
  service]{.underline} various naval [**t**actical **n**uclear
  **w**eapon**s** and to eliminate]{.underline} all [ground-launched
  **t**actical **n**uclear **w**eapon**s**]{.underline})

- [The 1992 **[Open Skies Treaty]{.mark}**]{.underline} (in which
  [Russia blocked U.S. access to parts of Russia clearly provided for
  under the treaty and]{.underline} also [**deviated** from agreed
  flight paths over the U.S.]{.underline} that were mandated by the
  treaty)

- [The 1999 **[Vienna Document]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([Russia
  **falsified**]{.underline} and concealed [military exercise
  **info**rmation]{.underline} which it had agreed to provide)

- [The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces]{.underline}
  (**[[INF]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [Agreement]{.underline} (which
  [**Russia** violated by **covertly** developing and]{.underline} then
  [deploying a missile which **exceeded** the permissible
  range]{.underline} limits established by the treaty

- [The 1997 **[C]{.mark}**hemical **[W]{.mark}**eapons
  **[C]{.mark}**onvention banning]{.underline} retention of
  [**chem**ical **warfare** agents]{.underline}, and

- [The 2011 **[New START]{.mark} Treaty**]{.underline}
  ([Russia]{.underline} has [withdrawn from
  **participation**]{.underline} in treaty-mandated working groups and
  inspections)

Additionally, **[Russia]{.underline}** is [almost certainly violating
the]{.underline} 1972 [**[B]{.mark}**iological **[W]{.mark}**eapons
**[C]{.mark}**onvention by maintaining]{.underline} an **[active
bioweapons]{.underline}** capability.

[Russia]{.underline} also [routinely violates the]{.underline} 1972
[**[Incidents at Sea]{.mark}** Agreement [and the]{.mark}]{.underline}
1989 [[**Dangerous Military Activities** Agreement]{.underline}]{.mark},
including buzzing the USS Donald Cook in the Baltic Sea and unsafe
approaches to U.S. aircraft operating in the Black Sea. Recent
revelations of intelligence suggesting that [[Russia]{.mark} might be
[prepared to violate the **O**]{.mark}uter **[S]{.mark}**pace
**[T]{.mark}**reaty by putting a **nuc**lear weapon into
**orbit**]{.underline} are yet [[another indication of **Moscow's
contempt** for]{.underline}]{.mark} solemn **[[international
obligations]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Given this deliberate and well-documented track record, [the bar for
holding Moscow **accountable**]{.underline} for its actions under any
agreement it might sign regarding Ukraine's future, much less the kinds
of nuclear arms control agreements in which President Trump has also
shown an interest, [should be **exceedingly high**]{.underline}. Indeed,
the first Trump administration demonstrated it would check Russian bad
behavior when it removed any constraint that the INF Treaty and Open
Skies Treaty imposed on the U.S. after Putin had gutted those pacts. The
second Trump administration would do well to review the policies it
pursued during the first term in office when it understood those
dangers.

[**[Russia]{.mark}**'s modern history [is built on]{.mark} a
**foundation** of **[lies]{.mark}** and **[broken
promises]{.mark}**]{.underline} about peace. [It's a long list of
**[violated treaties]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[fake
**ceasefires**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and **deceptive guarantees**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[friendly relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**".
As the war against Ukraine rages on, the question of peace talks remains
a complicated one for outside observers. What would be the preconditions
for negotiations? Would Russian peace guarantees provide any actual
safety in Europe? [We have no way of **predicting** the
future]{.underline}. However, [recent history shows]{.underline}
numerous [examples of how Moscow handles its **international
obligations**]{.underline}. If we believe that [[past behavior is a good
**indicator** of **future actions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, we have a
solid basis for analysis.

[[For every act of]{.underline}]{.mark} military
[[aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**Russia** has
committed]{.underline} in the last 30 years, [[there is a
corresponding]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian [[lie about **peace**]{.mark}
**talks**]{.underline}, peacekeeping, [[or
**negotiations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Russian [invasion of Georgia
resulted in a]{.underline} so-called [peace **settlement** that
threatens Georgia's **borders**]{.underline} to this day.
[Russia's]{.underline} fake "**[peacekeeping]{.underline}**" [mission in
Moldova turned an entire region of the country into an **isolated
island**]{.underline} with no prospects. The peace agreement promised by
Moscow to Ichkeria (known as Chechnya in Russian sources) ended with
50,000 to 80,000 people dead under brutal shelling.

[The]{.underline} complete [list of]{.underline} horrific
**[consequences]{.underline}** of "Russian peace" [could fill an entire
book]{.underline}. [The only thing that has **resulted**]{.underline}
from these Kremlin promises [is a]{.underline} human [tragedy with no
**stability**]{.underline}, prosperity, [or **final
resolution**]{.underline} in sight. Some of the conflicts frozen by
Moscow have lasted for decades and are still a threat to European
security.

Furthermore, in every case from Georgia to Ukraine itself, [Russia's
[**peace offerings** have proven to be a **stalling method** that leads
to **further escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[History leaves
little]{.mark} room for **[doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline}: given years to

[[Russia's foreign policy on the Arctic]{.mark} has long
[reflected]{.mark} the same insecurities and **[dual
agendas]{.mark}**---economic and military---that shape its domestic
approach to the region. [Before]{.mark} the full-scale [invasion]{.mark}

states. At the same time, it tried to attract Western companies to
invest in the Russian Arctic, but at a safe level, avoiding any
possibility of losing control.]{.underline}

[The Russian-hosted International Arctic Forum (IAF) held on March
26--27 painted a vision of Russia as a responsible and constructive
Arctic player. The high-profile event included Russian President
Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} as a speaker and [framed]{.mark} the [Arctic
as]{.mark} a [region for cooperation]{.mark} between both Arctic and
non-Arctic states. During his speech, Putin [claimed]{.mark} that
[Russia]{.mark} has "[advocated]{.mark} and continues to advocate
[for]{.mark} equal [cooperation]{.mark} in the region" [and that]{.mark}
"unfortunately, international cooperation in the northern latitudes is
currently going through difficult times" as "many [Western
countries]{.mark} have [taken]{.mark} a **[confrontational
course]{.mark}**" (Forum Arctica, March 27). [This image]{.mark} of
Russia seeking cooperation in the region, however, [is belied by]{.mark}
an [increasing military buildup]{.mark} in the Baltic and Arctic, as
evidenced by exercises and provocative language (DIIS, February 14).
While this two-pronged approach is not new, [Russia]{.mark} has been
**[intensifying]{.mark}** its **Arctic [military operations]{.mark}** in
recent months, [while continuing to]{.mark} [maintain]{.mark} a
[rhetoric]{.mark}al commitment [to]{.mark} peace and
[cooperation]{.mark} in the region (see EDM, March 31).]{.underline}
Responding to this approach is difficult as Western states must
acknowledge that responding militarily to Russia's Arctic strategy risks
legitimizing Moscow's narratives of Western aggression and expansion
into the Arctic, which in turn could fuel Russian disinformation that is
meant to weaken alliances across the other Arctic states (Topwar.ru,
April 3).

[During his speech at the IAF, Putin announced that "the number of
\[Russian\] military personnel \[in the region\] will be increased" in
accordance with the annual federal budget, to strengthen Russia's
military presence in the Arctic (see EDM, October 3, 2024; President of
Russia, March 27). This buildup is part of a pattern of expanded Russian
military presence in the Baltic Sea and Arctic region (High North News,
August 20, 2024).]{.underline} Hybrid attacks are growing more prevalent
since Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including rising
hybrid attacks on undersea cables (European Leadership Network, December
8, 2023; see EDM, February 5). While military exercises in the Barents
Sea are not necessarily increasing in quantity, it is notable that
exercises now include military personnel who have served in Ukraine (The
Barents Observer, March 18). Russia is also upgrading its submarine
capabilities, with Putin recently officiating a ceremony launching the
multi-role Perm nuclear-powered submarine, part of the Project 885/885M
Yasen class (see EDM, March 31). The Perm has a dual hunter-killer role
as well as the ability to vertically launch cruise missiles (President
of Russia, March 27; The Barents Observer, March 28). It is the first
Project 885M submarine to carry Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles, which
reportedly carry a 300-kilogram warhead originally designed to be an
anti-ship missile but has been used against Ukrainian cities in Russia's
war against Ukraine (Kyiv Independent, March 30, 2024).

[Russia's military [build-up]{.mark} is [reinforced by the narrative
that]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is an aggressive
actor]{.mark} in the Arctic and that Russia is merely responding to
imperialist behavior. This is evident in Putin's responses to U.S.
President Donald Trump's recent rhetoric regarding the purchase of
Greenland (see EDM, January 21). During his speech at the IAF, Putin
claimed that the United States' plan to "annex" Greenland is part of
plans to "systematically advance its geostrategic, military-political,
and economic interests in the Arctic" (President of Russia, March 27).
Beyond the headlines on Greenland, however, Russian officials have also
accused other Arctic states such as Norway and Finland of seeking
confrontation with Russia. For example, one official claimed recently
that Norway is seeking to militarize Svalbard (Aftenposten, December 19,
2024; see EDM, March 20). Another recent example is Russian presidential
aide Nikolai Patrushev's accusation that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's (NATO) naval forces are seeking to block Russia from the
Baltic Sea and conducting cyber operations on Russian ships in the
region (Kyiv Independent, March 13).  ]{.underline}

[[In tandem]{.mark} with these accusations, [Russia promotes itself as a
cooperative actor]{.mark} in the Arctic. The vast majority of panels at
the [IAF described Russia as a central actor for]{.mark} future Arctic
[business]{.mark} investment, particularly emphasizing the Northern Sea
Route (Forum Arctica, accessed April 3).  The event also highlighted
Russia's efforts to protect the Arctic [environment and]{.mark} its
[humanitarian]{.mark} cooperation with other states. Beyond the IAF,
Russian officials have pushed a narrative of the necessity of
U.S.-Russian economic cooperation and rapprochement in the Arctic
(Arctic Today, February 27; The Barents Observer, March
12).]{.underline}

[[Russia has]{.mark} the [opportunity to use]{.mark} the increasing
[division]{.mark} between the United States and its European Arctic
allies on issues such as Greenland [to create confusion]{.mark} over its
intentions in the Arctic and Baltic regions (see EDM, January 21). This
[presents Moscow with an excuse to frame **any**]{.mark} **Western
[responses]{.mark}** to its actions in the Arctic [as aggressive]{.mark}
(Arctic Today, February 19).]{.underline} Such responses would further
justify, in Moscow's eyes, an increased Russian military presence in the
Arctic. For example, Poland and the Baltic states said they would
recommend withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention, an international
treaty banning anti-personnel mines, to prepare for Russia's growing
military threat in the Baltic space (Euronews, March 18). Such a policy
response will certainly be framed in Moscow as an aggressive anti-Russia
approach that warrants increased Russian military build-up. On the other
hand, Moscow uses engagement by Western actors, such as Norway's virtual
participation in the IAF, as a calling card that Russia is a legitimate
partner in the region (Forum Arctica, March 26; The Barents Observer,
March 27). Responding to Russia's double game of
cooperation-confrontation discourse in the Arctic will come with a
cost.

[Arctic Cooperation on the Sidelines of War Diplomacy]{.underline}

What began as negotiations on Ukraine in Riyadh between Russian and U.S.
delegations also quietly included discussion on Arctic energy and trade
cooperation. Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund
(RDIF), confirmed that joint Arctic projects were explicitly discussed,
although details remain sparse. U.S. representatives, including
Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz,
reportedly viewed this engagement as a chance to "drive a wedge" between
Russia and China.

[This strategic outreach, while shrouded under economic cooperation,
indicates an evolving U.S. posture toward Arctic governance. [Trump's
willingness to engage with Putin outside]{.mark} the
[traditional]{.mark} [frameworks upsets Europe]{.mark}an capitals,
already concerned about being excluded from geopolitical decisions
affecting the region. [The Arctic]{.mark}, once a domain of scientific
collaboration and environmental diplomacy, [risks becoming a **theatre
of transactional deals**]{.mark} and territorial
bargaining.]{.underline}

[Geopolitical Realignment]{.underline}

[Trump's Arctic strategy reflects his broader foreign policy
posture---transactional, bilateral, and resource-driven. With Trump's
backing, the U.S. is pushing for Arctic Security Cutters to bridge the
icebreaking capability gap and counterbalance Russian and Chinese
expansion in the region. Yet, his growing [closeness to Putin]{.mark}
complicates this military buildup---[hinting at]{.mark} a scenario
[where Washington and Moscow divide]{.mark} Arctic [interests]{.mark}
for mutual economic gain.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, Russia's Arctic diplomacy has evolved to exploit this
opening. Sanctioned and isolated by Western powers, Russia seeks limited
cooperation with the U.S. to ease pressures on its Northern Sea Route
ambitions while simultaneously resisting China's growing Arctic
influence.

The Russia-China engagement in the Arctic is particularly delicate.
While Beijing has deepened its Arctic footprint---declaring itself a
'near-Arctic state' and investing in infrastructure along the Northern
Sea Route---Moscow remains cautious. China's increasing dominance in
financing Arctic energy projects and ports has begun to tilt the balance
of power in favour of Beijing. That Russia was reportedly hesitant to
grant China a stronger role in Arctic governance highlights this unease.

[[Russia]{.mark}, in turn, is trying to reassert sovereignty and
rebalance its foreign policy. Its move toward bilateral engagement with
non-Arctic partners and [plans to develop **alternative Arctic
governance**]{.mark} **forums** reflect its intention to diminish
Western influence in the region. Moscow's expansion of its Arctic and
Antarctic strategies suggests a long-term ambition [to]{.mark}
**dominate polar geopolitics** and **[reshape global
governance]{.mark}** norms.]{.underline}

[End of Circumpolar Consensus?]{.underline}

[The [A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil, established in 1996 to coordinate
peaceful cooperation among Arctic states (A8), now [stands at a critical
juncture]{.mark}. Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine already suspended
much of its work. Now, with Trump's possible withdrawal from
international institutions, the **very [foundation of circumpolar
cooperation]{.mark}** is [at risk.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This emerging [U.S.-Russia rapprochement]{.mark} could [render]{.mark}
the [A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil [obsolete]{.mark}, marginalize
smaller Arctic nations, and [destabilize existing legal
frameworks]{.mark} like the Central Arctic Ocean fisheries agreement and
the Spitsbergen Treaty. The [result]{.mark} could be [a new Arctic
order]{.mark}, [governed]{.mark} not [by]{.mark} collective interests
and environmental norms but by [hard power politics]{.mark} and economic
extraction.]{.underline}

[[Europe]{.mark}, especially Denmark and Norway, [risks being
sidelined.]{.mark} If Trump supports a revision of the Spitsbergen
Treaty or pushes forward on Greenland, it would fragment existing Arctic
legal architecture. [Indigenous communities]{.mark}---often champions of
environmental stewardship and cultural autonomy---may find their voices
[drowned]{.mark} in a race for resources.]{.underline}

[Meanwhile, [climate]{.mark} science [and biodiversity]{.mark}
preservation---hallmarks of previous Arctic cooperation---are [likely to
be casualties]{.mark} of a transactional geopolitics that privileges
fossil fuel extraction over environmental integrity. As Arctic ice melts
and new shipping lanes open, the [region]{.mark} will [become]{.mark} a
new **[axis of rivalry]{.mark} and contestation.**]{.underline}

China and NATO Arctic States

A potential U.S.-Russia Arctic collaboration will also cast a long
shadow over China's ambitions in the region. While China has
aggressively branded itself a 'near-Arctic state' since 2018, much of
its influence has hinged on investments in Russian energy and logistics
infrastructure---particularly in the Northern Sea Route (NSR). Beijing's
strategy has been to use economic partnerships to expand its strategic
footprint without provoking direct geopolitical confrontation. However,
a Trump-Putin rapprochement could dramatically alter these calculations.

With Russia potentially rekindling energy and logistical cooperation
with the United States, China could find its economic leverage in the
Arctic significantly diminished. The mutual suspicion between Moscow and
Beijing is already evident in Russia's reluctance to grant China greater
influence in Arctic governance mechanisms. Trump's strategy to "drive a
wedge" between Moscow and Beijing might inadvertently succeed if Moscow
perceives greater strategic and technological gains in partnering with
Washington instead of relying exclusively on Beijing's capital.

Such a shift would put China on the defensive, forcing it to rethink its
Arctic investments and potentially seek new bilateral alliances with
smaller Arctic states or increase engagement with Arctic Council
observers like South Korea and Japan. More broadly, it may reduce
China's capacity to shape Arctic norms and infrastructure development to
its advantage. China's Arctic presence has so far been largely economic
and scientific, avoiding military entanglements---but a weakening of its
strategic positioning may compel Beijing to rethink its posture.

At the same time, NATO-aligned Arctic states---Canada, Norway, Denmark
(through Greenland), and Iceland---face the dual challenge of
geopolitical marginalization and strategic uncertainty. Trump's previous
disregard for NATO, coupled with his preference for bilateralism over
institutional frameworks, leaves these countries in a precarious
position. If the U.S. pursues a transactional partnership with Russia,
NATO's role in Arctic security could be significantly undermined.

For instance, Canada and Norway---two pillars of Arctic defence
architecture---may find themselves sidelined in major decisions about
Arctic resource governance, shipping regulations, and military
posturing. Denmark, already rattled by Trump's Greenland remarks, could
face a new reality where its geopolitical relevance is diminished not
just by U.S. unilateralism but also by a Russian move toward alternative
Arctic alliances. The existing framework of Arctic cooperation through
the Arctic Council and various NATO exercises in the High North could
suffer serious erosion.

Moreover, such a U.S.-Russia collaboration might embolden Russia to
press for revisions of historical agreements, such as the 1920
Spitsbergen Treaty, thereby challenging Norway's sovereignty over
Svalbard. If Trump tacitly supports such moves in exchange for strategic
gains elsewhere, it could destabilize the northern European security
environment.

As NATO Arctic states reevaluate their positions, they may seek to
deepen internal EU-Arctic security cooperation or strengthen trilateral
frameworks with like-minded partners such as the UK or Japan. However,
without clear support from Washington, their ability to shape Arctic
policy and resist Russian strategic advances will be considerably
weakened.

Conceivably, a Trump-Putin axis in the Arctic could create a
three-tiered polar order: U.S.-Russia as primary actors, China in a
recalibrating secondary role, and NATO Arctic states grappling with
diminished strategic influence. The resulting fragmentation of Arctic
governance would mark a historic rupture in how the region has been
managed for decades---replacing cooperative multilateralism with
flexible power alignments and hard-edged competition.

Conclusion

[The Arctic is witnessing a new realignment of geopolitical forces.
Donald Trump's return to the White House, coupled with growing
[U.S.-Russia engagement]{.mark}, is reshaping the region's geopolitical
setting. What began as diplomatic overtures in Riyadh could now
**[catalyse]{.mark} the [decline]{.mark}** [of multilateral]{.mark}
Arctic [governance.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A new bilateral axis between Washington and Moscow may sideline
existing frameworks like the Arctic Council, while elevating
resource-driven partnerships.]{.underline} China, once gaining ground
through Arctic investments, could find its influence constrained.
[NATO-aligned Arctic states such as Canada, Norway, and Denmark face
growing marginalization, especially as Trump's approach weakens
collective Western leverage.]{.underline}

[The [result]{.mark} may be a fragmented Arctic order---driven more by
great power bargaining than consensus-building. Whether this represents
a lasting shift or a temporary realignment, its impact will stretch
beyond the polar circle---[reshaping global power equations]{.mark} and
testing the depth of cooperative governance norms.]{.underline}

[U.S. **Concessions** Have **Not Moderated Russian
Behavior**]{.underline}

[[Russia **interprets** U.S. concessions as **weakness** that provides
opportunities to]{.mark} further **[pursue its
ambitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, [Russia's [goals
extend]{.mark} **beyond minimizing** any threat]{.underline} posed by
the United States [[to]{.mark} actively **[improving]{.mark}** Russia's
[status as a **great power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A **weakened**
United States will not persuade Russia to back down]{.underline};
[rather]{.underline}, [it will allow Russia to further **propel** its
ambitions **forward**. The **history** of U.S.-Russian relations is
**replete** with examples of this occurring]{.underline}.

Indeed, [Russia [historically]{.mark}]{.underline} continued to
[**[build up]{.mark}** its forces [and pursue]{.mark} its **[adventurist
ambitions]{.mark}**]{.underline} even [[when]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates **reduced** its own forces and **[backed off]{.mark}**
the international stage]{.underline}. For example, as part of the Obama
administration's attempted reset, the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR)
asserted that Russia and the United States were no longer adversaries
and emphasized the reduction of the role of U.S. nuclear weapons. In
fact, since the Cold War, the [United States **drastically reduced** its
nuclear stockpile]{.underline}, unilaterally [**removing thousands** of
non-strategic nuclear weapons from its arsenal]{.underline}, halting
nuclear weapons testing, and allowing its nuclear enterprise to atrophy.
Today, there is no room to delay building back necessary capabilities.

If, as one theory of victory posits, Russian aggression were solely a
response to the U.S. threat, then the [United States'
decision]{.underline} to shrink its nuclear capabilities [**should
have** assured Russia it had no need to further expand its
arsenal.]{.underline} **[However]{.underline}**, [[Russia]{.mark}
instead [**dramatically increased** its **number** and **types**]{.mark}
of nuclear capabilities]{.underline}. The 2018 NPR stated, "While the
United States has continued to reduce the number and salience of nuclear
weapons, others, [including Russia]{.underline} and China, [have moved
in the **opposite direction**]{.underline}. [They have added **new
types** of **nuclear capabilities** to their arsenals]{.underline},
[[increased]{.mark} the **salience** of nuclear forces in their
**strategies** and **plans**, and engaged in **increasingly [aggressive
behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline}..."

[Moscow argues that]{.underline} U.S. [[missile defense]{.mark}
capabilities hamper]{.underline} Russia's [ability to
**retaliate**]{.underline} against a U.S. nuclear strike [and uses
this]{.underline} flawed logic [to [justify **new**]{.mark} **nuclear
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2018, Putin cited U.S. missile
defense as his impetus for developing six exotic new nuclear delivery
systems, even though the United States has made only minor upgrades to
its missile defense system over the last two decades. By that logic,
were the United States to limit its missile defenses, Russia would not
advance its offensive systems. Yet history illustrates that the exact
opposite occurs. [From 1972 to 1982, a time [when the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates **completely [dismantled]{.mark}** [its]{.mark} existing
homeland **[missile defense]{.mark}** system,]{.underline} [the [Soviet
Union **added 10,000 warheads**]{.mark} to its deployed
arsenal]{.underline} -- [one of [the **largest force
increase**]{.mark}**s** in its history]{.underline}. As famously stated
by former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown during the Cold War, "[When
**we build**, **they build**. [When **we stop**]{.mark}, **[they
build]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

President Joe [Biden's]{.underline} administration [has made **multiple
concessions** for Putin to **exploit**]{.underline}. In response to
Russia's buildup of military forces near the Ukrainian border in the
spring of 2021, the United States announced it would send warships to
the Black Sea. Concerned with escalating tensions with Russia, Biden
recalled the ships, and just days later, [Moscow]{.underline} announced
it would [**restrict access** to the Black Sea for six
months]{.underline}. The Biden administration's [[extension of **New
START**]{.underline}]{.mark} also feeds into Putin's hands because it
[[allows]{.mark} [Russia to]{.mark} continue **[exploitin]{.mark}g** the
treaty's flaws and provides **no incentive** to halt its nuclear
buildup]{.underline}. In fact, [Putin already
**[deploy]{.mark}ed**]{.underline} to the Middle East [a **Kinzhal
[hypersonic missile]{.mark}**]{.underline}---a new weapon [not limited
by New START]{.underline}---[[while the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
**[draws down]{.mark}** its forces in the region and **negotiates with
Iran**]{.underline}.

The [**number of examples** of Russia **exploiting**]{.underline} U.S.
[concessions to pursue its ambitions]{.underline} exceeds the scope of
this paper. These cases demonstrate that [Russia's ambitions
are]{.underline} such [that it sees [**windows of opportunity**
when]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [exhibits
**weakness**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The policy point on the 'special responsibility of the Arctic states for

[[all]{.mark} the [**regional formats** with the
**participation**]{.mark}]{.underline} of Western states --- the Arctic
Council, the 'Arctic Five' and the Barents Euro-Arctic Council ---
[[have **disappeared**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Just a month prior,
Russia's Fundamentals of State policy in the Arctic for the Period up to
2035, [[Russia's **official Arctic strategy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, was
amended.3) The changes [[included **removal** of **all**]{.mark} the
mentioned [**multilateral formats** from]{.mark} the paragraph on
**[international cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The strategy was
updated to emphasize the 'development of relations with foreign states
on a bilateral basis, within the framework of relevant multilateral
structures and mechanisms.' However, despite some media alleging Russia
removed all mentions of the Arctic Council, Russia's Arctic strategy
retained the point of 'the Arctic Council as the key regional platform
coordinating international activities in the region'.4) This shows that
Russia has no intention of creating alternative platforms and remains
committed for the time being to constructive international cooperation
within the framework of established and proven regional mechanisms. In
the aftermath of the 2022 Arctic Council pause, some experts feared
Russia or the seven other Arctic states would create its own regional
institution without the participation of the party, but this is not
likely to materialise in the near future. Nevertheless, it must be noted
that this commitment endures until Russia is treated as an equal party
whose interests are taken into consideration seriously. After Norway had
taken on the chairship of the Council, the Russian Arctic ambassador
Nikolay Korchunov expressed that Moscow could leave the Council if its
rights were violated.5)

### Cyberattacks

#### Russian leadership accelerates [hacktivism]{.underline} --- causes [cyberattacks]{.underline}.

[Power [relations]{.mark}]{.underline} between states [have been
[changed by]{.mark}]{.underline} the integration of the
**[[cyber]{.mark}world]{.underline}** into facets of daily life. Joseph
Nye predicts that [[gov]{.mark}ernment[s will **not be able to
contro**]{.mark}**l** cyberspace]{.underline} as closely as physical
spaces, such as attacks by land or sea22. He [emphasizes the roles that
**n**on-**s**tate **a**ctor**s** will play]{.underline}, due to [the
[**low cost** of]{.mark} cyber [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}[22]{.mark}.
The [barriers]{.underline} that have traditionally kept non-state actors
from engaging in conflict with states, such as the lack of armed forces
or military resources, [are made **irrelevant**]{.underline} with the
possession and use of offensive cyber technology. These [actors do **not
require** the **capital**]{.underline} normally needed when launching an
offensive; in addition, [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} that do not have
traditional means of military or coercive power [can also [**benefit**
through]{.mark} the [use of **cyber warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Russia's developments]{.underline}]{.mark} in cyber technology [[make
them just as **significant a threat**]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
the U.S. Department of Defense, as China, a close hegemonic contender to
the U.S. These factors argue for the need for increased funding to
programs regarding cyber security issues.

As cyberspace expands its reach, the strength of a state's cyber
defenses and technological advancement could become a more accurate
measure of 21st century military capabilities, due to the range of
cyberattacks20. [The United States]{.underline}, as the current hegemon,
[has the **most to lose**]{.underline} by such a reassessment of power.
The inclusion of cyber capabilities in military preparedness has the
potential to shift the current measures of power, greatly changing the
hegemonic competition in favor of China. [States]{.underline} that may
not have traditional measures of power, such as a large standing army or
high military spending, [could gain power through their **development**
of **cyber technology**]{.underline}, [as well as by developing
relationships with **n**on-**s**tate **a**ctor**s**]{.underline}.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUMED\]\]

In order to prevent a major security attack such as that experienced in
Estonia, laws and principles must be established to create and maintain
order among digital consumers. Establishment of these policies should
target different forms of cybercrime and create guidelines for internet
use within state borders. The International Governance Forum held by the
UN focused on cybercrime, with topics including how to combat fake news
and other dangers in cyberspace. The intended outcomes of the forum were
to provide strategies to better protect international cyberspace,
limiting the potential sources of cybercrime25. States could voluntarily
agree to participate in these agreements as they see fit for their
constituents, with the option to opt in and out of treaties and
agreements. As the structure of the internet grows to accommodate its
increasing base of users, the way cyberspace is treated should also
reflect its size and stature. The internet is used by a majority of
citizens in the nations in which it is available, and establishing
safety standards for its use are critical. Governing the internet could
be done in the form of a UN-style council. In a forum such as this,
states could have the ability to contribute to the rules affecting this
arena of world power. This would then provide states that hold
significant activity in cyberspace, in addition to those that aim to
become more engaged, with a way to set international rules that are
universally agreed upon and reflect fairness. With the establishment of
global cyber rules, the supervision of the use of cyber technology in
state borders could become more transparent. The use of non- state
actors to carry out proxy cybercrimes for states could be lessened with
higher accountability on the use of cyberspace between state borders.

PS:[Can this analysis also be applied to **Russia** and **Putin's
regime**]{.underline}?

IB:Yes, [[Russia]{.mark} has gone through **exactly** this process and
[is now an **ultra-authoritarian regime**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the
last 25 years of the Putin government, [the Russian [regime has
**changed fundamentally**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the first decade, in
the 2000s, [Russia was [more]{.mark} of an **[authoritarian]{.mark}**,
**[technocratic]{.mark}**, [**neoliberal** regime]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The global [[econ]{.mark}omic]{.underline} [[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}
from 2007/08 onwards [[led to a]{.mark} general **[political
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} not only in the Arab world, but also in
Russia. Massive protests against Putin's re-election took place in
Moscow and other Russian cities in 2011/12. These civil society protests
were perceived as a political and ideological threat and led the Russian
elites to believe that an authoritarian transformation of their rule was
necessary.

PS:What impact has this transformation had?

IB:The idea that social movements from below could overthrow a
government is an existential threat to autocratic regimes. This is why
[Putin's return]{.underline} to the presidency in 2012 [was [linked to
a]{.mark}n **ideological [shift]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}wards so-called
**traditional**, **[anti-democratic values]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And
these [anti-democratic elements]{.underline} were [based on]{.underline}
the idea that the [Russian state was not the result of a social
contract]{.underline}, but the result of history. The Russian Federation
is the direct continuation of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union.
This means that [[Putin]{.mark} does **[not]{.mark}** have to be
[elected **by the people**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [but is **destined by
fate** to lead the country]{.underline}. Putin [sees himself as the
**direct successor** to **Peter the Great** and **Stalin**]{.underline}.
These [[ideas]{.mark} were **ultimately
[enshrined]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Russian constitution in 2020.
At their core, these beliefs are also responsible for the violent
reaction to the events in Ukraine during the Maidan protests in 2013/14.

Punitive social policy, encompassing the dismantling of the welfare
state with the [[expansion of the **penal state**]{.underline}]{.mark}
and its associated institutions, as nicely stated by Elias Nosrati and
Michael Marmot in their Perspective,1 might [indeed be [considered
a]{.mark}n **upstream social [determinant]{.mark}** [of
**health**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nosrati and Marmot\'s analysis relates
to the [findings]{.underline} described by Navarro and colleagues,2
[[linking]{.mark} **political [ideology]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} policies
aimed at [reducing **social inequalities**]{.mark} such as
welfare]{.underline} [state and labour market policies]{.underline}.

The [increasingly [**punitive** policy]{.mark} environment]{.underline}
in North America, Europe, and some South American countries (eg, Brazil
and Argentina) [is probably [related to]{.mark} the [**spread** of an
**authoritarian ideology**]{.mark}]{.underline} that has xenophobia at
its core.

However, [a trait]{.underline} of those repulsion speeches that is often
missed [is how]{.underline} immigrants or [strangers are]{.underline}
[referred to as **parasites** or **contagious agents**]{.underline}.
Recent examples include the xenophobic and, in some cases violent, acts
committed against Asiatic citizens in Western countries since the
coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began,3 or Donald Trump\'s statement
that "tremendous" infectious disease is pouring across the Mexican
border into the USA.4 Constant [upheavals by the **Trump** and
**Orbán**]{.underline}5 administrations about migrants, some of
Brexit\'s collateral effects,6 and statements about refugees by the
Italian politician Matteo Salvini7 and the Spanish far-right Vox party8
can be [understood in this context]{.underline}.

[It is **not** that foreigners cannot transmit threatening infectious
diseases]{.underline}; actually, one of the earliest and most
devastating examples of how strangers can bring an infective threat was

### Econ

#### [Globalizing]{.underline} Russia's economic model collapses [every facet]{.underline} of the economy --- inflation, unemployment, GDP, and bankruptcies prove.

[The [Russian economy is facing]{.mark} **significant
[challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While extensive public spending and
domestic consumption are sustaining growth, the [rate of [expansion
is]{.mark} **steadily [declining]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Domestic
consumption, in particular, serves as a means of mitigating inflationary
pressures \[1\]. According to IMF forecasts, economic growth in 2025 is
projected to reach just 1.3%. Russia's [[reliance on **high**]{.mark}
**levels** of government [spending]{.mark}]{.underline} [means any
significant [reduction in]{.mark} such [spending]{.mark} could [trigger
**unemployment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [a [**decline** in
GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or]{.mark} even a
**[recession]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A potential recession could [have
**severe repercussions**]{.underline} for the Russian economy and its
political regime, potentially destabilizing the country's political
landscape. Living standards are declining significantly, with Rosstat
data revealing sharp year-over-year price increases for staple goods:
potatoes are up by 81%, cabbage by 37%, red onions by 46%, and butter by
36.5%. [[Inflation reached **8.9%**]{.underline}]{.mark} in November
2024. In response, the [[interest rate]{.mark} has been [**raised** to
**21%**]{.mark},]{.underline} a [move that could [trigger a **wave of
bankruptcies**]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly among companies not
engaged in defense contracts \[2\]. Additionally, rising tax burdens,
increased customs duties, and escalating costs are eroding the
profitability of businesses. However, the inflation data presents a
mixed picture. According to an index published by ROMIR, inflation in
September 2024 stood at 22.1% year-over-year, whereas official figures
for the same period reported a significantly lower rate of 9.67%
year-over-year \[3\].

### Food Insecurity

#### Russia will [utilize]{.underline} its hegemonic status to [cut off]{.underline} non-authoritarian states from food --- that causes [more]{.underline} food insecurity.

**Wegren 24** --- Stephen K. Wegren, Department of Political Science,
Distinguished University Professor, Professor of Political Science,
Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA, 2024 ("Russia's support
for authoritarian regimes through food trade," *Post-Communist
Economies*, Vol. 36, No. 6, March 13^th^, Available Online at

[[Russia's hegemonic position]{.underline}]{.mark} in food production
and trade [[is used to **support authoritarian**]{.mark}
**regime[s]{.mark}** [and **food security** in **authoritarian
states**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia's food trade is [used to
[support]{.mark} **political stabi[lity]{.mark}** [in **like-minded**
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Food exports allow Russia to
[convert]{.underline} resource [power to desired **behavioural**
outcomes]{.underline} -- to support other authoritarian regimes -- which
in turn has additional benefits: generating or maintaining markets for
other exports and sources for imports; bolstering political support and
influence for Russia; creating the possibility for broader economic
linkages; and [[supporting an **authoritarian
ecosystem**]{.underline}]{.mark} that fits with Putin's anti-Western
crusade, in which he sees himself and China as leaders.

The ramification of [politicised food trade]{.underline} is that such
behaviour [has little to do with the liberal trading system]{.underline}
embodied by GATT and the WTO. This global trading system which, despite
imperfections, has led to increased food security in most regions of the
world. Politicised food trade represents a significant non-tariff
barrier to trade. Free trade is supposed to be about open markets and
comparative advantage. The liberal trading order is not supposed to be
based on who is friendly. [When a food **hegemon** uses]{.underline} its
[food [trade as an **instrument** of]{.mark} its [fo]{.mark}reign
[po]{.mark}licy]{.underline}, [it [undermines]{.mark} the **function**
of [markets]{.mark} and **comparative advantage**]{.underline}.
Politicised food trade may also exacerbate food insecurity in regions
that are food-needy, as we saw in the early weeks of Russia's blockade
of Ukrainian ports that prevented grain exports. [Russia's anti-liberal
trade behaviour may **extend** to **other commodities**]{.underline} for
which it does not yet have hegemony, but its production and export
trajectories are upward: fish, flour, vegetable oil, sunflower oil,
beef, poultry meat, and other grains, thereby raising the likelihood
that access to these commodities may also become politicised. [Russia's
**[hegemonic behaviour]{.mark}** in food trade therefore [is
**consequential**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### I-Law

#### Russian hegemony [normalizes]{.underline} Authoritarian International Law --- that's [far worse]{.underline}.

**von Gall** interviewed by Kipp **25** --- [Caroline von
Gall]{.underline}, Senior Fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies, and
Konstantin Kipp, interviewer, 2025 ("Transnational Authoritarian
Repression -- In Conversation with Caroline von Gall," *RevDem*, March

Accessed 07-02-2025) rj

With these measures, the [[authoritarian Russia]{.mark}n
state]{.underline} not only [**[violates]{.mark}** individual
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [also German [**sovereignty**
and]{.mark} the **principle** of **[non-interference]{.mark}** in
internal affairs]{.underline}. Through transnational repression against
people, [the repressive state uses **authoritarian
measures**]{.underline} to influence the society of the targeted state.

The [Russian [law]{.mark}]{.underline} on extremism [has long been
[abused as]{.mark} a **tool of [repression]{.mark}** against religious
and ethnic minorities]{.underline}. [Individuals]{.underline} have been
[sentenced to **harsh penalties**]{.underline} under this law with the
aim of silencing other members of these minorities and [**preventing**
them from **publicly promoting** their traditions and
beliefs]{.underline}. For Putin, such minorities represent a significant
threat of disintegration. Later, the law on extremism was applied more
broadly. For instance, recently, it was [used to **[prohibit]{.mark}**
the **Russian LGBTQ** [movement]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
Anti-Corruption Foundation of Alexei Navalny.

While we were generally aware of the abuse of the law, the listing of
the DGO as a foreign academic institution was entirely unforeseeable.

It is inherent in political repression that it is arbitrary and that it
is impossible to know in advance when one is committing a punishable
offence. On the other hand, research shows that [Russians can
**identify** the conditions under which they are at **risk of
persecution**]{.underline}. Roughly speaking, [the **yardstick** for
when repression is applied are the **power interests** and the
**survival** of the authoritarian regime]{.underline}.

[[**Repression** Through **Authoritarian International
Law**]{.underline}]{.mark}?

Similar to your observations, Prof. Tom [Ginsburg]{.underline} has
[identified changes in]{.underline} the [behavior of modern
authoritarians]{.underline}. According to Prof. Ginsburg,
[**supranational** [authoritarian cooperation results in **Authoritarian
International Law**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which aims
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[extend the **survival** and **reach**
of]{.mark} authoritarian [rule across **space and
time**]{.mark}]{.underline}." This [law **primarily** [serves to
ensure]{.mark} **regime [survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which also
appears to be the goal of the transnational repression you highlight. Do
you believe that the transnational repression of academic freedom and
freedom of expression could evolve into a domain of Authoritarian
International Law? [Or [do such]{.mark} tendencies **already
[exist?]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**[[Yes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we can see that [international law and
authoritarianism are **not contradictory** in terms]{.underline}, but
that [[autocrats **exploit** the]{.mark} international [legal
sphere]{.mark} for **their own purposes**]{.underline}. To this end,
alternative organizations, such as the Eurasian Economic Union, have
been created.

### Military AI

#### Russian leadership normalizes [weaponized AI]{.underline} in the military --- triggers the impact.

Though never before stated so frankly by a head of state, [[Putin's
**views**]{.mark} on AI [are]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly
[[shared]{.mark} by national security leaders]{.underline} in the United
States, China and around the world. As I wrote in a report published by
the Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, AI
research is likely to [[deliver a **revolution** in **military
tech**]{.mark}**nology** on par with the invention of aircraft and
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. In other words, Musk is correct that
[[each]{.mark} country [is pursuing **AI superiority**]{.mark} and that
this pursuit brings **new risks**]{.underline}.

But in spite of Putin's ambitious goals, [Russia's pursuit of [**AI
domination** is unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline} to come [in]{.underline}
the form of [generating AI **tech**nological
**breakthroughs**]{.underline}. [Both]{.underline} the United States and
China possess digital tech industries that are larger, more
sophisticated and growing faster than Russia's.

However, [[Russia could]{.mark} be a **[lead]{.mark}er** [in
**weaponizing AI** in pursuit of]{.mark} its [grand
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which is [to **end US hegemony**]{.mark}
in the international system [and **re-establish Russian

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} was never a leader in internet technology

### Racism

#### Russia is [racist]{.underline} --- allowing them to [disseminate]{.underline} it ensures [global]{.underline} racism.

[[Scope]{.underline}]{.mark} and characteristics [[of **systematic
racist violence** in Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}

One of the most visible social movements in contemporary Russia,
especially following the invasion of Crimea under the [pretext of saving
ethnic Russians from the allegedly 'fascist' Ukrainian
government]{.underline}, [is the **extreme nationalist** or 'skinhead'
movement]{.underline}. After the fall of the Soviet Union, many
observers worried about a so-called 'Weimar Russia' scenario (Brubaker,
1996; Luks, 2008; Yanov, 1995), noting the similarities between Germany
after the First World War and Russia after the Cold War. Both cases
featured legends about an internal enemy, a rejection of the West as a
model of development, an ethnic diaspora living outside of the country,
a transition from a highly regimented to a more open society, and the
revenge of former elites. Although this analogy should not be overdrawn
(see Luks, 2008), a further parallel between the two cases lies in the
explosion of Russia's skinhead subculture from about the year 2000.
Shnirel'man (2007, 28; citing Tarasov, 2006: 19) estimates the number of
skinheads in Russia in 1996 at between 7000 and 8000.5 By 2007, this
number had grown to 60,000--65,000, or, as noted above, roughly half the
world's total skinhead population, with organized groups in some 85
Russian cities.

Moreover, [**[racist violence]{.mark}** by skinhead groups]{.underline}
now [[occurs]{.underline}]{.mark} in Russia [on a **[near-daily]{.mark}
basis**]{.underline}. Although there are no official published
statistics, annual reports from a major NGO, Moscow's SOVA Center
(Verkhovskii, 2005, 2006, 2007; Verkhovskii et al., 2010, 2012, 2013),
[catalogue incidents of skinhead violence]{.underline}. The level of
racist violence was highest between 2005 and 2009, after which (as I
describe below) the state belatedly stepped up its policing efforts. In
2007, SOVA recorded skinheads as killing 97 people and beating 623. In
2009, the respective numbers were 94 and 443. This number may be an
underestimate, as SOVA compiles its data from reports in regional
newspapers and regional networks of monitoring experts (Arnold, 2010b).
It is likely that many incidents of racist violence do not get included
in these regional data, and thus in SOVA reports, because victims are
afraid to report their attacks. To measure the scale of underreporting,
Amnesty International conducted a survey of ethnic minorities in Moscow,
finding that just 61 of 204 racist attacks were reported to the police
(McClintock, 2005: 70).

[These [**data** make Russia the **most violent
country**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the former Soviet Union [for
**ethnic** and **racial** minorities]{.underline}, [**far
[outstripping]{.mark}** [the next]{.mark} most dangerous
country,]{.underline} Ukraine, where, even accounting for the difference
in population size (roughly one-third of Russia's), the statistics are
much lower. In 2006, for instance[, 522 people were beaten]{.underline}
in Russia and 66 killed in racist crimes. For comparison, in Ukraine
there were [12 **beaten** and two **killed**]{.underline}. In 2008, in
Russia 434 people were beaten and 97 killed. In the same year in
Ukraine, there were 79 beaten and four killed (Umland and Shekhovtsov,
2013: 48). While there has been a decline in racist violence since its
peak in 2008, skinheads still remain a potent force in Russia, with 187
deaths and 206 people wounded in 2012 (Verkhovskii et al., 2013:
130--137). [**[Racist groups]{.mark}** still **[thrive]{.mark}** in
Russia]{.underline} and form a substantial portion of the social support
for Putin's 'Novorossia' policy of reuniting ethnic Russians in eastern
Ukraine (see Arnold, 2014c).

[Comparisons with the West are more **difficult**]{.underline}. The best
available resource, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) report on systematic racist violence for 2012, recorded
nine violent hate crimes in Austria, 98 hate crimes of violence in
Germany, one case in the United States, and 10 in the United Kingdom.
The same report estimated violent racist crimes in Russia at over 120.
The level of racist violence in contemporary Russia is thus the highest
in the OSCE. These statistics are almost certainly undercounted for
every country and especially so in Russia.6 In looking for historical
parallels, one author reports that 'during the 1980s ... the tally of
skinhead violence \[in the United States\] included 121 murders of
blacks and gays in urban areas across the nation, 302 racial assaults,
and 301 cross burnings' (Bowling, 1998; Wooden, 1991, cf. Hamm, 1993:
3). The level of racist violence for one year in Russia is thus higher
than the entire decade in the United States where Americans were most
concerned about this violence. Thus, Russia experiences a very high
level of racist violence compared to other OECD countries.

[[Stat]{.mark}istic[s]{.mark}]{.underline} on the number of racist
crimes, moreover, [[do not capture]{.mark} the **[qualitative
differences]{.mark}**]{.underline} between them,
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[reveal]{.mark} the
**[systematic]{.mark}** nature of Russian **[racist
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Elsewhere (Arnold, 2009), I have
disaggregated the concept 'ethnic violence' (of which racist violence is
a part) committed by skinheads into four ideal-types: symbolic violence;
lynching; pogrom; and massacre. Symbolic violence refers to
non-widespread property damage such as graffiti, and pogrom to
widespread property damage. Lynching refers to the murder or physical
injury of persons. Finally, massacre refers to widespread physical
injury and killing of persons. The type of skinhead violence varies by
the ethnicity of the subject. Most symbolic violence is used against
Jews, as in the spate of anti-Semitic signs erected in Russia by the
side of highways from 2002 to 2005. Most lynching is used against
Africans, as in the 2002 beating of an African-American US embassy
guard. Most pogrom-style violence is used against migrants from the
Caucasus and Central Asia, as in the 2002 skinhead raid on the
Tsaritsino open-air market in Moscow, the 2006 pogrom in the town of
Kondopoga, and the 2013 pogrom in Birulyevo, a Moscow suburb.
[**Massacre** is **most commonly used**]{.underline} against the Roma,
as in a 2006 incident outside Volgograd when skinheads armed with iron
bars beat eight Roma in their camp. This use of racist violence [to send
such **inter-community messages**]{.underline} reflects its systemic
nature.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONDENSED\]\]

Explaining the proliferation of skinheads in Russia and abroad Several
aspects of post-Soviet social change contribute to racist violence and
skinhead proliferation. Part of the attraction of the skinhead
subculture in Russia comes from (mainly) young people's problems of
anomie and alienation. One of the most commonly cited causes of skinhead
groups in the West is economic decline (Bowling, 1998: 54; Hamm, 1993:
215--216). Unemployed youths with time on their hands need outlets for
their frustration. Just as the rise of the skinhead movements in Britain
and the United States coincided with industrial decline, Russia
experienced an even more precipitous economic decline in the 1990s.
Despite economic recovery in the 2000s, unemployment, poor career
prospects, and lack of entertainment options remain a problem for many
Russian young people. Without the ideological glue of communism, social
bonds have frayed as Russian society struggles to find new social
legitimations. Elsewhere in the world, racist ideas have historically
appealed to young men unhappy with their prospects, as studies of white
supremacism in the United States have shown (Hamm, 1993: 211--213). In
Russia, however, the 1990s economic and ideological collapse was more
severe than any analogous transformation in contemporary western
societies, so that organized racism truly emerged as an 'alternative to
Communism' (Shnirel'man, 2007: 58). As with homicide (see Lysova and
Shchitov, this issue), Russia's persistently high levels of racist
violence thus reflect not so much temporary economic hardship as the
continuing failure to create an appealing alternative to the communist
system. As in other developed countries, Russian skinhead groups
violently reject immigration (and internal migration) by ethnic
minorities. Extremist groups regularly refer to a 'genocide' of ethnic
Russians,7 playing on widespread racialized fears of demographic
decline. In 1993 Russia's population stood at 148.6 million but by 2012
had declined to 143 million, the largest peacetime population decline
ever recorded in any modern country (Heleniak, 2013). The decline is
largely explained by low fertility rates and a low male life expectancy
(which in the 2000s fell to 57.5 years). To make up for the labor
shortfall, Russia has experienced increased immigration from other
post-Soviet countries, most of whom are drawn from non-Russian ethnic
groups, such as Armenians, Azeris, and Georgians from the Caucasus, and
Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, and Tajiks from Central Asia. Heleniak offers the claim
(which Russian officials are fond of repeating) that Russia now has the
second-largest number of immigrants in the world after the United
States, including some five to six million undocumented immigrants. The
official Muslim population grew from 7.9 percent of the total in the
1989 census to 10.2 percent in 2012, a likely underestimate, given
heavily Muslim undocumented immigration from Central Asia. Could one,
then, argue that Russia's skinhead violence was somehow directly
produced by higher levels of immigration and resulting ethnic and
cultural changes? To be sure, immigration clearly figures into the rise
of Russian skinheads, just as the original skinhead movement itself grew
out of the 'Teddy Boy' subculture that emerged in post-Second World War
Britain in part as a reaction to what was then a new phenomenon,
large-scale non-white immigration from the Commonwealth (Hamm, 1993:
15--17). However, the 'fact of' immigration should be distinguished from
the 'response to' it in seeking to explain the extreme growth of
systematic racist violence in post-1991 Russia. If immigration itself,
or even large-scale non-white immigration, produced such violence, then
countries of immigration such as Canada and Australia would today be
world leaders in such violence. Thus, as an analytical matter, Russia's
skinhead problem is puzzlingly large even for a major
immigration-receiving country. In consequence, it is more promising to
consider how immigration is received in a given society than to treat
immigration as an objective cause of racist violence. Only a discursive
and political analysis can explain why Russian society has become
particularly fertile ground for such violence.

\[\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUMED\]\]

[**Discursive** and **ideological** factors]{.underline}

[[**Pseudo-scientific racism** has a **long**]{.mark}**er
[pedigree]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Russia than one might suppose.
Although in the USSR such racism was largely constrained by the regime's
official 'socialist internationalism', racist ideas entered Russian
intellectual life even before the fall of communism. The '[Soviet Theory
of Ethnos]{.underline}', formulated in the late 1970s, [[claimed]{.mark}
that ethnic [distinctions were **real**]{.mark} and
**immutable**]{.underline}, and had evolved in dialogue with the local
environment (Tishkov, 1997). Thus, Lev Gumilev (1990) theorized in
Ethnogenesis and the Biosphere that the behavior of ancient nomadic
tribes could be traced to fluctuations in solar radiation based on their
geographic location. This was [[**fertile soil** for]{.mark} more
**[doctrinaire racist thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By 1997, there
were 10 neo-pagan groups in Moscow and Leningrad alone. The neo-pagans
and in particular their most prominent figure, Aleksandr Dugin,
preserved theories espoused by Nazi thinkers. Dugin is a former
professor at Moscow State University, the chief ideologist of the
'Eurasian' movement in Russia, a consultant for the Kremlin, and
frequent participant in televised debates.8 In this milieu, the idea of
the 'Great White Race' appeared with specifically Eurasian
characteristics (Moroz, 2005).

In the post-Soviet era, such [[views]{.mark} have [become]{.mark} **more
[widespread]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} have [won **official
backing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed,

since the 1990s, the idea of the Aryan origin of the Russian people has
discreetly entered into academic studies of history ... In 1999
\[several individuals\] founded an organization Biblioteka rasovoi mysli
('library of racial thinking') which publishes nineteenth and twentieth
century works on physical anthropology, some of them by Russians but
primarily by Western authors.

(Laruelle, 2010: 26)

These Aryan ideas have evidently played out in at least some documented
acts of racist violence. For example, anti-Semitic neo-pagan literature
was found in the possession of a young man who walked into a synagogue
in 2006, [**shouting 'I will kill Jews'**, and stabbed several
congregants]{.underline} (Shnirel'man, 2007: 88--89). Such [ideas may
also **[influence]{.mark}** Russian government
**[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as [**think-tanks** espousing racist
ideas]{.underline} have emerged.9

[two]{.mark}]{.underline} countries [[were]{.underline}]{.mark}
"[**[true friends]{.mark}** who have been [through **thick** and
**thin**]{.mark} together]{.underline}".

approach]{.mark}, **[global warming would exceed
4°C]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [main indicator of the weakness]{.underline} of Russia's climate
policy [are [its **unambitious**]{.mark}]{.underline} emission reduction
[targets]{.underline}. The 2020 Presidential Decree on the Reduction of
Greenhouse Gas Emissions sets a target of reducing emissions to 70% of
1990 levels by 2030. The NDC under the Paris Agreement reflects this
target. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and
Russia's de-industrialisation, however, GHG emissions fell to 69% of
1990 levels by 1997. Looking at total emissions minus net absorption by
forests and other ecosystems, this would actually allow emissions to
increase from current levels. Internationally, Russia, like many
forest-rich countries, has pushed for maximum recognition of its
forests' absorptive capacity to reduce its emissions commitments. In
September 2022, [Russia set a net-zero]{.underline} emissions
[target]{.underline} for 2060, [based on the [**assumption** that
forests]{.mark} will **[absorb twice]{.mark} as much** carbon
dioxide]{.underline}. [There is **[no]{.mark}** transparent
[info]{.mark}rmation [to **support this**]{.mark}]{.underline} increase
or to demonstrate that it is based on a technical approach to removing
carbon dioxide. Based on this assumption, other emissions need only to
be halved to reach net zero. [[This **reduces** the motivation to reduce
**emissions** in]{.mark} sectors such as Russia's **[high-emitting
energy]{.mark} industry**]{.underline}, [and [ignores]{.mark} the
**high** levels of [**illegal logging** and]{.mark} other
**[defo]{.mark}restation** activities]{.underline}, as well as the
effects of [recent **large wildfires** in Siberian forests]{.underline}.
Overall, Russia's [NDC is]{.underline} more about somehow [merely
complying]{.underline} with international environmental agreements [than
setting an ambitious]{.underline} national climate [policy]{.underline}.
