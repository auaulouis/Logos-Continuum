This affirmative say the United States should develop an Arctic Joint
Command center, likely in Alaska with another sister station hosted by
another NATO ally. The advantages have a lot of modularity and can be
mixed/matched. I would recommend either the resilience or the extraction
advantage.

Since the Cold War, the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and]{.mark} many of its
**[N]{.mark}**]{.underline}orth **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**tlantic
**[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization [[allies]{.mark} have [regarded
the Arctic as]{.mark} a barren [wasteland with no]{.mark} **geopolitical
[significance]{.mark}**. [But China's rise an]{.mark}d its **strategic
[alliance]{.mark}** [with Moscow]{.mark} have [made the region a
**tinderbox**]{.mark} that could redefine **global
security**]{.underline}. [[By ignoring the Arctic, NATO risks rendering
itself **irrelevant**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the face of rising Russian
and Chinese ambitions.

At the 2025 NATO summit in The Hague, leaders focused on presenting a
united front at a time of mounting internal arguments over how to
prioritize growing security challenges from actors such as Russia,
China, terrorists, and migrants. The difficult decisions on how to spend
the 5 percent of GDP that the alliance's member states agreed to
allocate for military expenditures by 2035 have yet to take place. When
these difficult talks take place, [[NATO must]{.mark} prioritize
[build]{.mark}ing a **credible [defense]{.mark} force** posture
[in]{.mark} the [**Arctic**, as **Russia** and **China** expand]{.mark}
their **strategic presence** in the alliance's northern
flank]{.underline}.

Economically, [Russia's Arctic coastline has tremendous potential for
**shipping**, **energy**, and **fishing ventures**]{.underline}. In
2024, the Arctic accounted for 7.5 percent of the country's GDP. This
figure is likely to increase. As sea ice is melting, [Moscow is
advertising the **[N]{.mark}**]{.underline}orthern
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea **[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**oute as a
time- and money-saving link for the shipping industry, logging 38
million tons in 2024. [The route is Russia's national maritime waterway,
[generating **substantial revenue** from oil and
**l**]{.mark}]{.underline}iquefied **[[n]{.underline}]{.mark}**atural
**[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**as extracted in the Arctic region and
transported to Asia with costly icebreaker assistance. At an estimated
\$19.2 billion in 2025, Arctic fisheries are also an important source of
revenue.

Rising Arctic commercial traffic creates control problems, threatening
Moscow's strategic assets. Russia has therefore been transforming its
Arctic coast into a modern maritime fortress. Its [growing [fleet of
**sub**]{.mark}**marine[s]{.mark}**, including nuclear-powered
**ballistic missile** subs]{.underline} lurking near the Barents Sea,
[[poses]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**direct [threat]{.mark}** not just
[to]{.mark} **regional [stability]{.mark}** but to the U.S.
homeland]{.underline}. Moscow is also [[investing]{.mark} heavily [in
**a**]{.mark}]{.underline}utonomous
**[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**nderwater
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle[**[s]{.mark}** and upgrading its
**[Northern Fleet]{.mark}**]{.underline} bases, aiming for sea denial
and nuclear deterrence---trends that should concern Western defense
officials.

Meanwhile, [China]{.underline} is evolving from a distant observer to an
[**active participant** in the Arctic. Russia is a leading exporter of
**l**]{.underline}iquefied **[n]{.underline}**atural
**[g]{.underline}**as (LNG), oil, and fish from the Arctic to China, and
[China has invested heavily]{.underline} in these industries. As the EU
is phasing out Russian LNG, cargoes are increasingly shipped to the
Chinese market. [[Moscow relies on Beijing's]{.mark} **financial
[resources]{.mark}** [and **tech**]{.mark}**nological prowess** to build
a **credible Arctic defense**]{.underline}. The two are [connecting
Russia's Arctic ports to China's **Polar Silk Road**, forging
**logistical networks** that enhance interoperability]{.underline}. In
2024, a Russia-Chinese joint venture announced plans to build and
operate five ice-class container ships with dual-use potential all-year
round on the Northern Sea Route. While China currently maintains a
limited military footprint---just a handful of icebreakers and polar
research vessels---the potential for strategic expansion is evident.
[Next-generation [**submarines**, **hypersonic**]{.mark} **missiles**,
and **[space-based systems]{.mark}** could someday [allow China to
project power]{.mark} across the Arctic]{.underline}.

[[NATO]{.mark}'s Arctic member states are **[woefully
unprepared]{.mark}** for this new reality]{.underline}. Only recently
has the alliance truly begun to prioritize Arctic security, through
exercises like Dynamic Mongoose and Nordic Response. [Yet NATO still
[lacks]{.mark} the **[critical]{.mark}
[infra]{.mark}structure**]{.underline}---polar-capable [[**ships**,
**surveillance**]{.mark} systems, **[missile]{.mark}** defense, and
**[sealift capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}---that would make it a
credible force in the Arctic. The alliance's [[approach]{.mark} is
**[reactive]{.mark}** rather than **strategic**]{.underline}. NATO
nations has announced some promising Arctic defense investments such as
Canada's plans to acquire missile defense systems and Denmark's
commitment to strengthen surveillance around Greenland. But
[[NATO]{.mark} nations [need]{.mark} to demonstrate **real-world
capabilities** and **[increased]{.mark} [coordination]{.mark}** [with
allies before they]{.mark} can truly [restore credibility to]{.mark} the
alliance's [Arctic]{.mark} **force [posture]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Their posture is the [worst of both worlds]{.underline}\-\--encirclement without any [operational alignment]{.underline} or [strategy]{.underline}.

As the Russian invasion of Ukraine is reshaping NATO\'s strategy in
Eastern Europe, [mounting [tensions are]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[plaguing the]{.underline}]{.mark} neighbouring
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The transformation of this
once-peaceful area into a geostrategic flashpoint unfolded in three
acts, but [[**NATO** could]{.mark} help **[defuse]{.mark}** the
situation]{.underline}.

First, global warming over the past decade has had an outsized impact on
the region, increasing temperatures at the highest rate in the world
and, as the ice cap melts, making the Arctic ocean easier to navigate.
Second, this is increasingly opening the ocean to maritime activities
including fishing, trade, tourism, and military operations, particularly
in the summer months.

[The [**potential** to exploit]{.mark} the Arctic\'s vast **oil** and
**gas** [reserves is]{.mark}]{.underline} still a
[[remote]{.underline}]{.mark} prospect, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} seems
[[sufficient to stoke]{.mark} the [interest of **Russia** and
**China**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Third, [Russia\'s]{.underline}
full-scale [invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2022
[considerably **[worsened relations]{.mark}** with the West,
including]{.underline} with [its]{.underline} seven [Arctic
counterparts, [rendering coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline} in the region
[more **[difficult]{.mark}** than ever]{.underline}, even through the
apolitical-by-design Arctic Council. [In reaction]{.underline} to
heightened tensions, [[**Finland** and **Sweden**]{.underline}]{.mark}
successively [[joined NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2023 and 2024,
[making all Arctic countries except Russia part of the
alliance]{.underline}.

The genesis of NATO\'s turn of attention to the Arctic goes back to
Ukraine\'s Maidan Revolution in 2014 and Russia\'s annexation of Crimea.
[[Russia\'s **aggression** and **willingness to redraw the map**]{.mark}
of Europe not only irremediably **antagonised** Ukraine and most of
Eastern Europe, but]{.underline} also [[soured]{.mark} the Kremlin\'s
[relations with]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[Arctic counterparts. The
region]{.underline}]{.mark}, once seen as a beacon of peaceful
cooperation, returned to an inimical status quo reminiscent of the Cold
War while NATO, after more than a decade of intervention in remote
Afghanistan, [[saw]{.mark} the [prospect of **high-intensity warfare**
back]{.mark} at its gates]{.underline}. Arctic states which had
previously resisted a bigger role for NATO in the region, particularly
Canada, reconsidered their position.

In this context, the alliance\'s defence ministers released a statement
in 2015 that sought to bring territorial defence back to centre stage
with the "360-degree approach," a strategic framework envisioning NATO
as a geographically coherent bloc with surrounding \'flanks\' to defend
against potential aggression. The debate on how to close the
Greenland-Iceland--United Kingdom (GIUK) gap, which gives Russia access
to the North Atlantic, was revived. Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in
2022 has since focused attention on the eastern and northern flanks.

One could interpret the accession of Finland and Sweden to full
membership as a victory for NATO\'s 360-degree approach in the Arctic.
Although both countries were already NATO Enhanced Opportunity Partners
with high levels of force interoperability with the alliance, [[NATO now
presents a more]{.mark} formally **[unified front]{.mark}** to its
northern flank]{.underline}. In practice, [this will give more weight to
Arctic voices within NATO]{.underline}, rebalancing its centre of
gravity towards the High North in the absence of a dedicated Arctic
Command. [[However]{.mark}, the accession of [**Finland** and
**Sweden**]{.mark} to NATO had the **unintended consequence** of
[feed]{.mark}ing into [Russia\'s **rhetoric of
encirclement**]{.mark}]{.underline} (PDF) [in the Arctic. Russia\'s
[stakes]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic [[are]{.mark} hard to deny:
[its Northern Fleet and]{.mark} sea-based [**nuclear deterrence** rely
on]{.mark} Murmansk\'s **[deep-water ports]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
addition of 1,340 kilometres of NATO border at the footstep of Murmansk
Oblast and the Kola peninsula was unsurprisingly excoriated by Russia,
accusing the alliance of dangerous escalation. To help in countering
such narrative, [[NATO should **avoid**]{.mark} **strategic
[ambiguity]{.mark}** in the Arctic [and develop]{.mark} a
**[clear]{.mark}** and **transparent [deterrence]{.mark} posture** for
the region]{.underline}.

[[Unfortunately, NATO\'s new status]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} arguably [the **[worst of both
worlds]{.mark}** in its current state. [The alliance
combines]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[theoretical]{.underline}]{.mark}
position of [[dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}, thanks to the membership
of seven of the eight Arctic states, [[while]{.underline}]{.mark}
simultaneously [[lacking]{.mark} proper strategic and [operational
alignment]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Since]{.underline} the end of [the Cold War, the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and **Canada** have
considered the Arctic]{.underline} primarily [as a North
American]{.underline} Aerospace Defense Command
[jurisdiction]{.underline} due to Russia\'s persistent missile threat
compared to relatively diminished naval forces. [[The U.S.]{.mark} Navy
[has]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[seen]{.mark} its]{.underline}
anti-submarine warfare (**[ASW]{.underline}**) [capabilities reduced and
a **[rebalancing]{.mark}**]{.underline} effort [[towards the]{.mark}
**Indo-[Pacific]{.mark}** [taking its attention]{.mark}
away]{.underline} from the GIUK gap.

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom, centrepiece of
the GIUK complex, currently operates the smallest attack submarine fleet
in its history, with six platforms at the time of writing compared to
almost 30 at the end of the Cold War, and [cannot afford to bear the
brunt of GIUK defence alone]{.underline} despite the welcome additions
of modern Type 26 and P-8 Poseidon to its fleet.

[Other players are in]{.underline} comparably [challenging
positions]{.underline}. For instance, [Denmark must patrol its vast
**e**]{.underline}xclusive **[e]{.underline}**conomic
**[z]{.underline}**one [around **Greenland**]{.underline} and the Faroe
Islands [with four ice-reinforced hull frigates]{.underline} designed in
the 1980s [that do not meet]{.underline} NATO [readiness
standards]{.underline}. Situational awareness in the Arctic is
consequently fragmented across different national forces with disparate
capabilities and incommensurate operational requirements.

In their 2023 Vilnius Summit Communiqué, NATO leaders recognised these
issues and pledged continuing joint exercises and Arctic surveillance
coordination. These pledges have already been partly enacted with a
recent ASW exercise in the Norwegian Sea but are hardly sufficient to
adequately secure NATO\'s northern flank.

[[NATO\'s]{.mark} Arctic [strategy should]{.mark} fully
[acknowledge]{.mark} the **[spatial redefinition]{.mark}** of the region
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the accession of [[**Finland** and
**Sweden**. Securing the **Norwegian Sea**]{.mark} and the [**GIUK** and
**Bear gaps**, as well as]{.mark} the **protection of critical
[infrastructures]{.mark}**[, **coastal defence**, and]{.mark} access
to]{.underline} the Norwegian **[[Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark}**
archipelago, [[should be]{.mark} defined as **[strategic
priorities]{.mark}** for]{.underline} all [NATO\'s Arctic
members]{.underline}, plus the United Kingdom, which styles itself as
"the Arctic\'s nearest neighbour."

[[NATO should]{.mark} act as a **coordinating force** to [ensure]{.mark}
ongoing [**physical presence** of]{.mark} **military [assets]{.mark}**
[and **monitoring**]{.mark} of [its]{.mark} vast and austere
[Arctic]{.mark} maritime space]{.underline}. The United Kingdom, as the
most capable military power with direct access to the European Arctic
and leader of the Northern European Joint Expeditionary Force, should be
a driving force, focusing its ASW assets on the GIUK gap. It should also
invest jointly with Arctic states on platforms that can reinforce
presence and situational awareness north of the Arctic circle more
efficiently or cheaply, such as ice breakers and large uncrewed
underwater vehicles.

[[Only]{.mark} with]{.underline} such [[decisive actions]{.mark} will
NATO]{.underline} be able to [[**capitalise** on its
**enlargement**]{.mark} in the Arctic and **truly secure** its northern
flank]{.underline}.

#### Heightened [geopolitical tensions]{.underline} and [international competition]{.underline} make [nuclear conflict]{.underline} in the Arctic inevitable\-\--it's [try-or-die]{.underline}.

[The [Arctic]{.mark} has long been a **potential [arena]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} war, especially **[nuclear war]{.mark}**. American and
**[Russian]{.mark}** **[sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}** stationed there
boast
**[i]{.mark}**]{.underline}nter**[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ontinental
**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**allistic
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**issile**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** and act
as strategic nuclear deterrents. For Moscow, the **[[Kola
Peninsula]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Russia's far north-west
[[forms]{.mark} a [**gateway** for vessels]{.mark} from its massive
fleet of mainly nuclear-powered submarines. [Through]{.mark} the
so-called **[GIUK gap]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the gap between Greenland,
Iceland and the UK, Russia's [[subs]{.mark} can [reach]{.mark} the
**[Atlantic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Should the [Kremlin]{.mark} ever fire **cruise [missiles]{.mark}**
toward **North America**, they [would fly over]{.mark} the
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Likewise, Canada and America's warning
system, stretching from Alaska to Newfoundland and Labrador, would pick
up the attack in the Arctic. And, partly to atone for missing
the Chinese surveillance balloon that reached Alaska in January this
year, America and Canada are set to build new Arctic-scanning radar
bases in the north-western US and Ontario. The main aim of which will be
to detect the new hypersonic cruise missiles that Russia has already
used in Ukraine and could one day fire at Canada and America, via the
North Pole.

The Arctic is also the site of potential non-nuclear disputes between
Russia and NATO members. The Kremlin's feared 200th Motor Rifle Brigade
is located only a few kilometres from Russia's short border with Norway
and its much longer one with Finland. Other Russian marines are also
based in the region, including the spetsnaz (special forces). Both units
have suffered severe losses in Ukraine, but their location and their
likely future revival continue to worry Norway. After all, over in
Ukraine, at least seven soldiers from the 200th Motor Rifle Brigade
are wanted for war crimes.

There have [[already been]{.mark} **potential [flashpoints]{.mark}**[.
When Moscow invaded Ukraine, Norway blocked]{.mark} Russian exports to
**[Svalbard]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a Norwegian Arctic archipelago with
a population of just 2,600 -- including 400 Russians. That [[led]{.mark}
Russia [to]{.mark} threaten unspecified '[**retaliatory
measures**']{.mark}]{.underline}. Since then,
Russo-Norwegian [[relations]{.mark} have
**[deteriorated]{.mark}**]{.underline} still further. Indeed, [[northern
Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}, home to nearly 500,000 people and a
significant Russian-speaking minority, is reportedly now a [[hotbed
of]{.mark} **Russian [espionage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [presence of
Russian **drones** and **spies**]{.underline}, surveilling key Norwegian
ports, as well as fibre-optic cables and pipelines,
[indicates]{.underline} that the [[Kremlin]{.mark} is]{.underline}
already [[waging]{.underline}]{.mark} low-level **[[hybrid
warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

New NATO member Finland also has problems with Russia that stretch into
the Arctic. In November, Finland claimed that Moscow was using asylum
seekers from the Middle East and Africa to infiltrate its borders. It
promptly diverted them all to the remote Raja-Jooseppi border post, 300
kilometres north of the Arctic Circle. Finland has since announced that
it will shut down all border crossings with Russia.

The role of China in the Arctic Circle is also increasing
tensions. [**Chinese** investments and technologies **underpin** Russian
**fossil-fuel extraction**]{.underline} and transport in the Arctic.
And, although China has no land or sea claims on the Arctic, it declared
itself a 'Near-Arctic State' in 2018, invoking the impact of changes in
the Arctic's ecology on China's own ecology.

The [Arctic is not just some frozen, **neglected backwater**. Everybody
**wants in**]{.underline}. And with that comes the [risk of further
state-to-state **disputes** and **conflict**]{.underline}.

From cooperation to antagonism

The Arctic hasn't always been a site of international tension. After the
Cold War, inter-state relations were carried out in a spirit of
compromise. In 1996, the eight Arctic nation states formed the Arctic
Council, which was explicitly designed to promote cooperation between
the states involved, and also included representatives from the Arctic's
indigenous peoples.

In 2007, a Russian sub planted Russia's national flag on the seabed
beneath the North Pole, but it did so mostly as a joke. As late as
December 2014, the Financial Times felt that competing claims over the
Arctic had been conducted 'in a relatively benign and co-operative
spirit', even if Putin was becoming more aggressive.

International relations have since rapidly deteriorated. In February and
March of 2014, Russia annexed Crimea. And in April of that year, Putin
announced that Russia was to step up its presence in the Arctic. As
Reuters reported at the time, Russia had 'staked its future economic
growth on developing the Arctic's vast energy resources and reviving a
Soviet-era shipping route through the ice'. That same month, Russia's
state-owned oil and gas company, Gazprom, began the first ever shipment
to Europe of oil from offshore Arctic waters.

The old days of cooperation among the eight Arctic nations were
certainly numbered after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. But they
only finished decisively with Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
2022. The Arctic Council suspended its operations that year, and since
then there has been a step-change in the US's approach.

In September 2022, the Biden administration established a new Arctic
Strategy and Global Resilience Office. Early next year, the US defence
department will publish its first strategy for the Arctic since 2019.
Referring to more military activity in the region by Russia and China,
the Arctic Office's Iris Ferguson said:

'We see increasing alignment between them -- particularly off the coast
of Alaska. There is [[**no decline** in activity]{.mark} in the Russian
Arctic **[despite]{.mark}** the war in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**. This says
something about the **significance** of the region]{.underline}.'

The US, however, is struggling to keep up with its competitors in the
Arctic. In May this year, a top US Air Force general, Glen D
VanHerck, told the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic
Forces that the greatest risk for the US stemmed 'from our inability to
change at the pace required by the changing strategic environment... In
an era of incredible innovation and technological achievement,
inflexible, outdated processes are a greater impediment to success than
many of our competitors' advancements.' The slow reflexes of the US are
as evident in the Arctic in 2023 as they were during its botched
withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.

The melting Arctic?

While international competition and potential conflict has been rapidly
escalating in the Arctic, Western political and cultural elites have
continued to understand the Arctic principally as a site of
'environmental catastrophe'. Indeed, footage of Arctic ice breaking up
has become a hackneyed metaphor for runaway climate change.

In October, COP28 president Dr Sultan Al Jaber warned that Arctic
temperatures were rising about four times faster than the rest of the
planet (though the previously accepted figure was twice as fast). Later
on, at a summit of heads of state and scientists in Paris, French
president Emmanuel Macron said he would spend €1 billion on research
into the melting of the Arctic and the Antarctic. At the summit, Pam
Pearson, founder and director of the International Cryosphere Climate
Initiative (ICCI), said that 'politicians think that the ice is far
away. The ice does not care. It will continue melting until carbon
dioxide levels stop rising and come down.'

Western environmentalists seem to care far more about the Arctic ice
than they do about the people that live on it. On top of the eight
nation states that own bits of the Arctic, it is also home to several
indigenous peoples, including: the Sámi of Scandinavia and the Kola
Peninsula; the Greenland Inuit; First Nation peoples in Canada and
Alaska; and Russian Arctic communities, such as the Chukchi and Evenk.

You will barely find mention of indigenous peoples' actual interests in
environmentalist reports on the Arctic. In one published in November,
the ICCI instead concentrated on ramping up the alarm over climate
change. It claimed that the Arctic Ocean will soon be free of sea ice
almost every summer for up to four months (July-October). In turn, said
the ICCI, open water in the Arctic will absorb more heat from polar
sunlight, accelerate the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet and
irreversibly increase the thaw of coastal permafrost, whose peatlands
are close to or have already passed a 'tipping point'.

Tipping points, irreversible changes... Even if some of the scenarios
mooted come true, the answer to climate change in the Arctic, the answer
that will help the people who live there, is more economic development.
This is what ultimately will fortify them against the whims of nature.
Moreover, the climate-change alarmism of Western elites obscures the
fact that the threat posed by war around the Arctic is much higher, more
lethal and more immediate than the threat posed by climate change.

The new world map

The [melting of the Arctic]{.underline} may not pose the environmental
threat the Western doom-mongers claim, but it could
[**[exacerbate]{.mark}** the [threat of **war**]{.mark}. By
[destabilising **trade**, **transport**]{.mark} and general
**[infra]{.mark}structure**, a slow thawing of the Arctic ice could make
international relations]{.underline} still more
**[fraught]{.underline}**. Not least because [**Russia** and **China**
look set to take advantage]{.underline}.

A more liquid, less icy Arctic would certainly be in Russia's interests.
It would help ice-strengthened Russian tankers ship Liquefied Natural
Gas from vast fields in Yamal, northern Siberia, to European and Asian
destinations. [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} said in 2022 that it would
[spend almost **\$30 billion**]{.underline} by 2035 on
[[developing]{.mark} its **[N]{.mark}**]{.underline}orthern
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea **[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**oute (NSR).
This runs across the top of Russia from Murmansk to the Bering Strait
and Alaska, and it has become more viable as sea ice in the Arctic has
declined.

Indeed, at a conference of BRICS nations in August this year,
Putin announced that [Russia]{.underline} is [planning to build new
**ports**, fuel **terminals** and **icebreaker** ships]{.underline} in
the Arctic. The following month, Russia dispatched the first-ever
conventional oil tanker along the NSR, with a cargo of a million tonnes
of crude oil destined for Ningbo, China. Now, after the 7 October attack
by Hamas on Israel, China and others might well prefer the fast, cheap,
8,000-mile passage of fossil fuels going from Rotterdam to Asia via the
NSR over the increasingly dangerous 13,000-mile route via the Suez
Canal, Yemen and the Straits of Malacca.

China will certainly benefit from more maritime routes produced by
Arctic melting, given that about 90 per cent of Chinese exports go by
sea. And Russia, which is exporting a lot of energy and raw materials to
China, would also clearly benefit. In October, Putin told Chinese
president Xi Jinping that Russia plans to run 'ice-class' cargo ships,
which have thicker hulls than conventional ships, throughout the NSR all
year round. This is not unfeasible, even though a maritime breakthrough
in the Arctic won't be easy.

A green goldmine?

While there might be a maritime interest in a melting Arctic, that alone
doesn't explain why so many different nations are now competing over
this frozen wasteland. In Imperialism (1902), the economist JA Hobson
wrote an early and influential account of what he called the 'economic
taproot' of imperial conquest. He argued that its three wellsprings are
nations' search for markets, labour and raw materials.

These look weak as explanations for what is going on in the Arctic
today. The Arctic's demand for externally supplied construction
equipment, infrastructure and housing is limited and its own market for
fish, ice and tourism is modest. It also offers relatively few workers
for foreign investors to exploit.

So that would seem to leave only raw materials as the real target for
international interest in the Arctic. It is estimated that 30 per cent
of the world's undiscovered gas and 13 per cent of its undiscovered oil
lie in the Arctic. After the invasion of Ukraine, Western extractors
such as ExxonMobil, Shell and BP pulled out, opening the door for
Russian and Chinese operations to expand.

Furthermore, there is growing interest in the Arctic's minerals,
especially as more melting in the region may one day make them easier to
access. Some even argue that minerals are 'the main drivers of the
Arctic resource rush' -- especially the rare-earth metals, neodymium,
praseodymium, terbium and dysprosium. These are held to be 'key to the
world's electric-vehicle and renewable-energy revolutions'. There are
also deposits of copper, which is vital to electricity grids, wind
turbines and photovoltaic systems. The Arctic could then be of special
interest to nations determined to dominate the green economy.

But this may be overstating it. The Arctic's resources are hard to get
at. As one review of critical minerals in the Arctic explains, the high
transportation and energy costs involved are a significant economic
barrier to development in the Arctic. And it is by no means guaranteed
that worldwide demand for Arctic minerals will remain high. If interest
in the so-called green-energy transition wanes, then demand for those
minerals will fall.

The Arctic is neither a fossil-fuel paradise nor a green goldmine. It is
best understood as a gladiatorial arena in which nations are battling it
out for regional domination.

The potential for conflict

[Growing **[geopolitical volatility]{.mark}** is [intensifying]{.mark}
**international [competition]{.mark}** over the Arctic. [Wars rage
in]{.mark} **[Ukraine]{.mark}** and **[Gaza]{.mark}** and tensions
simmer in the **[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**ast
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea. In a
little-noticed development in September, Taiwan denounced new plans by
Beijing to build a high-speed rail link from the province of Fujian, in
China's south-east, to two groups of Taiwanese islands located right by
the Chinese coast. More recently, Chinese coastguard vessels have again
fired a water cannon at Filipino boats in the South China Sea, first
around the Scarborough Shoal and then around the Spratly Islands.

These kinds of [[skirmishes in]{.mark} the maritime Far [East]{.mark}
are [spreading to]{.mark} the maritime **Far
[North]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A full-scale Arctic war is not imminent,
but the [[clouds]{.mark} are certainly **[darkening]{.mark}** and
serious [**confrontations** are possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. As two
Russian authors observed in 2022, Russia, Denmark and Canada all have
claims lodged with the United Nations over ownership of the Lomonosov
Ridge, near the Geographic North Pole.

As with the South and East China Seas, [[disputes]{.mark} in the Arctic
are]{.underline} more [[about **power**]{.mark}
**projection**]{.underline} than what lies beneath the ground. For
example, Moscow knows that if and when Turkey allows Sweden to join
Finland in entering NATO, Russia will be the only Arctic state not to be
a NATO member. Indeed, the [[Kremlin]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[moved
to]{.mark} restructure Russia's military posture so that it can fight
**[full-scale land operations]{.mark}**]{.underline} all the way down
from Arctic Finland to Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. In June, the
Kremlin announced the reactivation of the Leningrad Military District,
centred around St Petersburg, to put the Russian military on a long-term
war footing against the West and Ukraine.

Over the next decade, the [[Arctic]{.mark} looks like it [will be
disturbed]{.mark} much [more by **military encounters**]{.mark} and
provocations [than]{.mark} by **[drilling]{.mark}** or **[climate
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [battle]{.underline} for the Arctic
[is **just beginning**]{.underline}.

#### Escalation is likely and revisionism is [true]{.underline}\-\--Putin's shredded [arms control]{.underline} and [scaled up]{.underline} nuclear weapons.

Increased military activity in the Arctic and Nuclear escalation

[[Russia's]{.mark} **main focus**]{.underline} now is [to **confront**
the West]{.underline}. Most of the nuclear legacy comes from past
military programs, but [**[nuclear militarization]{.mark}** in the
Arctic is still [ongoing]{.mark}]{.underline}. By early 2025, the
[Russian Northern Fleet had [accrued]{.mark} around 30 **[nuclear
ships]{.mark}** and **[submarines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Navy
remains the main operator of nuclear installations in the Russian
Arctic. Among those are some [40 **nuclear
[reactors]{.mark}**]{.underline}---many more than the 25 reactors
operated in a civilian capacity within the nuclear icebreaker fleet and
at nuclear power plants.

And no less important are the [[**300 nuclear warheads** on **combat
duty**]{.mark} on **strategic submarines**. Russia spends **\$10
billion** a year on its nuclear weapon programs]{.underline}. In recent
decades, Russia has built over 10 new nuclear submarines and is
developing new nuclear weapon carriers. This will [create a new
**nuclear legacy** in the future and poses risks of
**accidents**]{.underline} during testing and operation today.

Among accidents with nuclear vessels over the past few decades, we must
note the tragedy of the Kursk nuclear submarine, the sinking of the
K-159 submarine, and a fire aboard the top-secret Losharik submarine. In
2019 the Burevestnik cruise missile, equipped with a nuclear reactor,
suffered an accident that caused a radiation release in the Arkhangelsk
region and killed five Rosatom engineers. These tests have now been
moved to another site in the Arctic --the Novaya Zemlya Archipelago.

The Novaya Zemlya test site has seen 132 nuclear explosions.
Fortunately, no full-scale nuclear tests have been conducted here since
1990. However, the site has never been officially closed and is
deliberately kept open and ready for use. This is a part of [[Putin's
strategy to **intimidate**]{.mark} the West]{.underline}. In recent
years, [he has [taken]{.mark} many of [steps toward]{.mark} **nuclear
[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Last year, in fact, [Russia [withdrew]{.mark} its ratification of the
**[C]{.mark}**]{.underline}omprehensive
**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**uclear **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**est
**[[B]{.underline}]{.mark}**an **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**reaty. And in
a year, the **[[New START]{.underline}]{.mark}** treaty between the
United States and Russia [will expire]{.underline}. This means that,
likely next year, for the first time in decades, we will [find ourselves
in a situation where there are **[no treaties]{.mark}** between the two
largest nuclear powers **[limiting]{.mark}** their **nuclear
[arsenals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Potentially, this will [[allow Russia
to]{.mark} quickly [place]{.mark} up to **100** additional
**[nucl]{.mark}ear warhead[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} on existing
submarines [[in]{.mark} the **[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Independently, the plan is key to build [joint operations]{.underline} that check back against [Sino-Russian]{.underline} revisionism.

[The [Arctic]{.mark} has reemerged as a **priority [front]{.mark}** [for
**great power competition**]{.mark}. Warming]{.underline} temperatures
[and]{.underline} decreasing [**subsea permafrost** make [new maritime
**trade routes**]{.mark} and [access to untapped **natural gas**]{.mark}
and **[mineral deposits]{.mark}**]{.underline} increasingly [[possible.
China]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[expanding]{.underline}]{.mark} its
**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**phere **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfluence [into the **High
North**]{.underline}, while [Russia remains **protective**]{.underline}
of its northern border and sea routes. [The **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates by **itself** [lacks]{.mark} the [resources]{.mark}
[necessary]{.mark} to sustain a **military presence** in the
Arctic]{.underline} and relies on partners in the region to achieve its
goals.1 

After the Cold War, the Arctic stood out as one of the last regions in
the world where cooperation was the established norm, as the result of
intergovernmental forums such as the Arctic Council.2 But some
strategists argue this period of "Arctic exceptionalism" is over.3 By
analyzing the Arctic through Mahanian and Corbettian lenses, the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** allies
[can [confidently position]{.mark} their [naval]{.mark} [forces to
**offset**]{.mark} the efforts of [**Russia** and
**China**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Chinese and Russian Mahanian Strategies

Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan had a useful shorthand for the importance of
sea power: "Whoever rules the waves rules the world."4 To achieve such
dominance, Mahan "stressed the need for harbor infrastructure in remote
regions to support mercantile and naval endeavors."5 Maintaining a
strategically positioned military force safeguards national economic
agendas even as it deters potential conflicts. In peacetime, this
post-Mahanian strategy means using technological advancements and
diplomacy to police the seas and project power ashore. These efforts set
the foundation for success should war arise. As growing naval powers,
China and Russia use post-Mahanian means to achieve the Mahanian
objective of ruling the waves.6

[[China uses]{.mark} its [partnership with Russia to
**legitimize**]{.mark}]{.underline} Beijing's national [**economic
[objectives]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. At
the 2015 Arctic Circle Assembly, then-Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming
classified China as a "near-Arctic state," claiming the changing
environment has a "direct impact on China's climate, environment,
agriculture, shipping, and trade, as well as social and economic
development."7 That same year, Chinese President **[Xi]{.underline}**
Jinping [announced a **Maritime Silk Road**]{.underline} as a venue for
its economic influence under the broader Belt and Road
Initiative.8 China's 2018 Arctic Policy specifically outlines a northern
component---the Polar Silk Road (PSR)---which crosses the Arctic Ocean. 

[China and Russia have poured research into [nuclear-powered
**icebreakers**, ice-enhanced **l**]{.mark}]{.underline}iquid
**[[n]{.underline}]{.mark}**itrogen **[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**as
[[ships]{.mark}, and [polar]{.mark} deep-sea **exploration
[vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and
sanctions imposed on Moscow by the Arctic 7, China recognized its need
to balance its cooperation with Russia and among the other Arctic
countries. The growing polarity within the Arctic Council has slowed
China's ambitious Arctic projects, limiting the effectiveness of its
overall strategy and allowing Russia to retain its status as the leading
Arctic stakeholder.

[[Russia holds]{.mark} just over **[half]{.mark}** of [the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} coastline and population, and [[Moscow
embraces]{.underline}]{.mark} post-Mahanian [[means to]{.mark}
[maintain]{.mark} its [status as]{.mark} the current **Arctic
[superpower]{.mark}**]{.underline}. President Vladimir [Putin
recognizes]{.underline} the [[need to balance]{.mark} **[strategic
partnerships]{.mark}**]{.underline} in such a way as supports its own
economic interests while maintaining its superiority in the region. 

The Kremlin has emerged as the gatekeeper to China's desired PSR.
Initially, Russia was not very receptive to China's role in the
region---Moscow was the last Arctic Council member to approve China's
status as an observer nation, believing non-Arctic states do not belong
in Arctic affairs.9 But China's consistent commitments to Arctic
research facilities and icebreaker escorts solidified a mutually
beneficial relationship with Russia. Sanctions resulting from Russia's
annexation of Crimea in 2014 further strengthened the partnership.10 

The contentious dynamic in the Arctic Council undermined Moscow's
framing of its 2020 Arctic Strategy, which describes military strength
in the Arctic zone as a means to preserve cooperation.11 Ominous signs
that Soviet-era stations reopened in the Arctic Circle---for both
military and commercial use---have further raised concerns.12 As discord
shapes the dynamics of the Arctic, military strength emerges as crucial
for the U.S. and its allies to safeguard regional strategic objectives.

Corbett-Inspired U.S. Strategies

Sir Julian Corbett emphasized the value of an effective political system
to achieve sea power while deterring war. Corbettian theory echoes
throughout A Blue Arctic, the U.S. Navy's 2022 strategic blueprint for
the region, and in Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti's
priorities for the fleet. Blue Arctic aims to "maintain enhanced
presence; strengthen cooperative partnerships; and build a more capable
Arctic Naval Force." Admiral Franchetti expands on these objectives with
her priorities of warfighting, warfighters, and the foundation that
supports them. Normalizing Arctic exercises with NATO allies embodies
the Corbettian emphasis on effective political systems.

Corbett observed that a fleet with command of the seas can "control the
maritime communications of all parties concerned."13 The remote and vast
Arctic region, however, has insufficient sea lines of communication
(SLOCs) and undersea cables. Tensions between Russia and other Arctic
states have indefinitely stalled SLOC projects such as the Russia
Optical Trans-Arctic Submarine Cable System, Arctic Connect, and Polar
Express. The U.S. and its NATO allies can mitigate this lack of
essential infrastructure by combining their naval resources to increase
maritime domain awareness, thus using existing Arctic resources to
maintain a competitive edge at the northern frontier.

Under the Ice Lie Chilling Threats

During the Cold War, a high operational tempo of testing tactics and
technology helped the U.S. submarine community become the leading
service in Arctic operations. Returning to this state of proficiency
will solidify deterrence in the Arctic.

The Soviet Union believed the Arctic's unique and complex environmental
factors, such as its isolation and changing ice bodies, rendered it an
ideal base for nuclear-powered submarines.14 Moscow\'s mindset quickly
shifted. On 17 March 1959, the USS Skate (SSN-578) became the first
submarine to surface at the North Pole.15 Arctic submarine operations
became routine. On 5 May 1986, during Ice Exercise (ICEX) 86-1, three
nuclear-powered attack submarines simultaneously surfaced at the North
Pole.16 The Soviets learned they could not hide strategic nuclear
bastions under the Arctic ice. Submarines moving beneath the surface of
the Arctic reaffirmed a resilient nuclear deterrence.

Cold War imperatives also compelled U.S. and NATO nations to
aggressively modernize their antisubmarine warfare (ASW) capabilities.
From 23 February to 12 March 1986, Operation Anchor Express shed light
on the capabilities and limitations of military technology in the High
North. To facilitate new research, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman
established the largest Navy ice camp ever, the Applied Physics
Laboratory Ice Station. Scientists and engineers tested new ASW sensors
and tactics with attack submarines, maritime patrol aircraft, and
surface ships.17 Presence operations further highlighted the advanced
ASW capabilities and enduring joint doctrine equipped by U.S. and NATO
naval vessels and aircraft. 

In 2020, four U.S. Navy ships and one Royal Navy ship conducted
freedom-of-navigation and ASW operations in the Barents Sea, the first
such operations since the 1980s. In Dynamic Mongoose 2022, another
ASW-focused exercise, nine NATO nations dedicated 3 submarines, 11
surface ships, and 16 maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft to
train in the Norwegian Sea. Today, ICEX, renamed as Operation Ice Camp,
includes representatives from all branches of the U.S. military, in
addition to the Royal Canadian Navy, the French Navy, the British Royal
Navy, and the Royal Australian Navy. Participating squadrons practice
navigation, communication, and maneuvering skills unique to the
operating environment. Conducting joint integrated ASW operations
demonstrates both commitment and the capability to operate in the harsh
Arctic theater.

Operational Partnerships in the Arctic

[Safe [operations]{.mark} in this **expeditionary theater**
[require]{.mark} the [U.S. and NATO to combine critical]{.mark}
[infrastructure with environment]{.mark}al familiarity]{.underline} in
the Arctic. Successful [[exercises]{.mark} can [**weaken**
Russia]{.mark}'s [and]{.mark} [China's **military**]{.mark}
**footprints**]{.underline}.

A [longstanding [partnership between]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.S.
[[Marines and]{.mark} the [**Norwegian** military highlights]{.mark} the
[importance of **amphibious operations** to strengthen
**alliances**]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the 1986 Operation Anchor
Express, Norway hosted the U.S. Fourth Marine Amphibious Brigade.
Approximately 20,000 troops representing eight countries tested the
limits of their equipment in cold weather and conducted exercises that
would protect NATO's northern flank.18 The U.S. amphibious fleets
continue to anchor themselves in this relationship to reaffirm
partnerships with Scandinavian countries who specialize in Arctic
operations. 

NATO recently launched Exercise Steadfast Defender 24, the largest
Arctic drills since the Reforger Exercise in 1988. One component,
Exercise Nordic Response 2024, focused on high-end amphibious
operations, including beach landings on Norwegian shores. These
exercises aim to reaffirm joint doctrine and ensure successful
operations in the Arctic's harsh environment. They establish tailored
Arctic tactics while reinforcing safety of personnel.

The Russian Navy has also attempted amphibious exercises with the
objective of showing its tactics as superior to NATO's. Ocean Shield
2023 consisted of more than 30 military vessels, 20 support vessels, 30
aircraft, and 6,000 personnel. Because of a redistribution of forces to
Ukraine, however, Russia's "Baltic Fleet has lost its ability to
conduct a large-scale offensive amphibious operation." Russia's Arctic
naval posture has weakened.

Assemble the "A" Team.

Fleet commands consist of staffs responsible for a designated operating
area. In 1943, Admiral Ernest J. King established the Ninth Fleet
Command, which was responsible for military operations in the High
North. After World War II, the Ninth Fleet dissolved into the Atlantic
numbered fleet commands. In 2017, Admiral James Stavridis proposed
reserving the Ninth Fleet for the High North by establishing a staff
specialized in naval operations at the northern front.19  The [Russian
Navy's **Northern Fleet**]{.underline} Joint Strategic Command is
[responsible for the **western** and **central Arctic**]{.underline}.
Its naval component includes the Northern Fleet's Submarine Command and
fleet, and the Kora Flotilla's Arctic surface combatants. [For the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [a more proportional
response]{.underline} for peacetime is [to provide mission tasking
to]{.underline} a destroyer [squadron]{.underline} (DesRon) with
experience sailing in the Arctic. 

[Squadrons can be tasked to specialize in **specific missions**
applicable to the Arctic]{.underline}. In September 2021, Rear Admiral
Brendan McLane, then-Commander of Naval Surface Force Atlantic, and Rear
Admiral Brian Davies, then-Commander of Submarine Group Two, created
Task Group Greyhound (TGG). With TGG, Arleigh Burke--class
guided-missile destroyers stand ready to support sustainment operations
and counter Russian undersea threats. Through training, practice, and
real-world experience, TGG ships became model ASW platforms.

Sailors of all ranks and rates likewise can [specialize in **tactical
operations** and **strategy** for the Arctic region]{.underline}.
Historically, the Navy has established foundations for officers to
become instructors in specialized warfare areas. The best example of
this is the Naval Aviation Warfighting Development Center, or TOPGUN. It
was created in 1969 with the aim to train aircrew in all aspects of
aerial combat. When reporting to a squadron, graduates are expected to
teach what they learned to their squadron mates. The surface navy
similarly established the Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development
Center (SMWDC) in 2015. The center trains junior surface warfare
officers to become specialized Warfare Tactics Instructors. 

Rear Admiral Jim Kilby, founder of SMWDC and its commanding officer in
2016, emphasized the importance of doctrine and tactics: "We need to
focus on telling our ships how to use and employ capability correctly
and writing the doctrine from the perspective we would like to receive
it as operators, not technical writers." Breaking down the barriers to
understanding for all warfighters increases mission success. However, a
general warfighting doctrine does not always apply to the Arctic
environment.

Exchange opportunities among Arctic states can bolster interoperability.
In 1971, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt announced the
Personnel Exchange Program (PEP). The program aimed to strengthen U.S.
alliances by challenging junior officers and enlisted personnel to
better understand and appreciate allied military cultures. Of the 20
foreign nations within PEP, Norway is the only Arctic state that hosts
U.S. service members. While the opportunity to learn alongside navies
that regularly operate in the Arctic is limited, the experience and
strengthened partnerships gained from each successful tour are
undeniable. On their return to the U.S. Navy, sailors share familiarity
and experience with their shipmates, enhancing the confidence to conduct
successful missions in the High North.

Warfighter specialization can happen at all levels of command. From an
experienced DesRon commodore to the humble sailor living amid a foreign
community, there is no substitute for specialized experience. 

Thaw the Arctic Naval Theater

The U.S. and partner NATO naval forces are prepared to [[**confidently
engage** in Arctic]{.mark} conflict and **[win]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
That confidence should be anchored in joint exercises grounded in
Corbettian theory, and in [[fostering subsurface **cold-water
operations**]{.mark}; amphibious **[cold-weather operations]{.mark}**;
and [expertly trained **warfighters**]{.mark}. Leveraging these
capabilities [**does not** diminish]{.mark} the **shared aspiration**
for **[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} among all Arctic states.

#### It prevents military [overstretch]{.underline} and allows the U.S. to [pivot]{.underline} towards Asia.

NATO's Valuable Arctic Expertise

[[Converging **Russian** and **Chinese** interests]{.mark} both
[in]{.mark} and beyond the [Arctic requires]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[to
work]{.mark} by, [with]{.mark}, and through **[allies]{.mark}** to
counter **threats** in the region. Traditionally, the United States has
enjoyed **unrivaled** military dominance]{.underline}, but in the
Arctic, it [now faces an **emerging alliance**]{.underline} between two
formidable competitors. [This [situation underscores]{.mark} the [need
for]{.mark} a [**collaborative approach** with **NATO**]{.mark}
**allies** [to ensure preparedness]{.mark} for a **crisis** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. American dominance cannot be taken for granted. In
the Arctic, [[U.S. capabilities are **not enough**]{.mark} to counter
Russia, let alone a **Sino-Russian alliance**]{.underline}.

Per our recently published research, [[successful]{.mark} **military
[op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}** [in the Arctic require]{.mark} not only
specialized **[equipment]{.mark}** but also dedicated
**[training]{.mark}** and [doctrine for **polar warfare**]{.mark}.
Arctic [op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} are uniquely [challenging, with
**complex logistics**]{.mark}, extreme **[weather]{.mark}**, and
**seasonal shifts** like polar days and nights]{.underline}.
Accordingly, building Arctic-ready forces requires "the deliberate
education and development of Arctic-minded leaders alongside
collaboration with allies and partners to foster enhanced cold weather
war-fighting capabilities across the spectrum." Arctic warfighting
requires more than just specialized equipment --- rather, it demands the
dedicated attention of those troops who will be assigned to conduct it.
Lessons learned from previous Arctic conflicts include the need for cold
weather warfare training and equipment, dedicated polar war-fighting
doctrine, joint operations, interoperability, mobility in Arctic
conditions, planning for increased supplies and unique logistics, Arctic
domain awareness and intelligence, space weather disrupting command and
control, inimitable polar weather issues associated with polar days and
nights, controlling Arctic sea lines of communication, and ensuring
unity of command.

Fortunately, [[NATO already has]{.mark} much of the **necessary
[infra]{.mark}structure** [in place]{.mark} with the
**Nordics**]{.underline}. For instance, the [[British-led
**J**]{.mark}oint]{.underline} **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**xpeditionary
**[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}**orce [was [established in
2014]{.mark}]{.underline} and emphasized Arctic warfare capabilities
with Nordic military forces in the High North. More recent developments
include the establishment of a NATO Multi-Corps Land Component
Command in Finland, the formation of a Nordic Air Force, and the
creation of a NATO Commander Task Force Baltic in the German port city
of Rostock. All reflect a boost in NATO's cohesion, capability, and
communication, helping establish the "3 Cs of Deterrence" around the
Arctic Circle.

NATO's role in defending the Arctic has grown increasingly vital, and
the alliance can capitalize on the polar expertise of its Arctic
countries. Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Sweden, and Finland are
highly trained in cold-weather warfare, have a deep understanding of
Arctic operations, and are geographically positioned to respond quickly
to threats in the region. Moreover, the Nordic countries are jointly
negotiating the procurement of an infantry fighting vehicle specifically
for the subarctic climate.

Finland's expertise in Arctic warfare can be traced to the Winter
War (1939--1940), when it held off a numerically superior Soviet
invasion force longer and better than expected due to superior tactics
adapted to its unique Arctic environment, before ultimately losing.
Finland's contributions to NATO include substantial ground forces
and long-range fires. Likewise, Norway hosts the NATO Centre of
Excellence for Cold Weather Operations. Sweden's recent ascension to
NATO bolsters the air capabilities and industrial base of the alliance
while Denmark's Joint Arctic Command provides critical presence,
experience, and capability. Canada has long been a key U.S. partner in
the Arctic as a part of the bi-national North American Air Defense
Command.

Filling Gaps in the Ice

While Canada and the Nordics specialize more in Arctic warfighting,
[[NATO still faces **significant military capability
gaps**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic. [To effectively counter
**potential aggression** from Russia and China in the Arctic, NATO needs
to strengthen its ability to conduct a range of **specialized military
operations**]{.underline} in the Arctic including long-range fires,
multi-domain awareness, air and missile defense, attack aviation,
amphibious operations, and the logistical sustainment of resilient
forces capable of enduring prolonged engagements in harsh polar
conditions.

NATO faces specific challenges in Arctic naval readiness, particularly
in ice-capable vessels and icebreakers, which are an "important element
of Arctic sovereignty." Russia holds a clear advantage with 46
icebreakers, Project 22100 Ocean Patrol Vessels, and its new
ice-capable Project 23550 ships. These vessels offer Russia a massive
Arctic advantage enabling superior presence and mobility. NATO should
focus on building additional vessels like Canada's Harry DeWolf Arctic
Offshore Patrol Ships and an updated version of Denmark's Thetis-class
frigates. The recently penned collaborative ICE Pact between the United
States, Canada, and Finland is a step in the right direction for
bolstering their respective industrial bases to build more icebreakers.
Additionally, partnerships with non-NATO allies that have icebreakers,
such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia, could support NATO operations
in the Arctic if needed in a crisis. For current gaps in Arctic
coverage, NATO needs more anti-access and area denial capabilities to
pose a credible threat to Russian operations. NATO needs to embark on a
sustained investment campaign to bolster its Arctic deterrence
capabilities both on land and at sea in the Arctic.

Minimal Arctic Capabilities

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[needs NATO for]{.mark} Arctic **[stability]{.mark}**, due to struggles
in committing tangible resources to the Arctic besides more **hollow
strategies**. [Increasing **Arctic-specific training**]{.mark},
expanding icebreaking capabilities, [and enhancing
**interoperability**]{.mark}]{.underline} with Canada, the Nordics, and
Arctic-minded countries (such as the United Kingdom) are [[essential
steps for **projecting force** in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Training exercises like Arctic Edge and the Joint Pacific Multinational
Readiness Center Rotation 24-02 demonstrate progress but should be
scaled up to counter the threat posed by the growing Sino-Russian
alliance. The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates also [[maintains critical Arctic
installations --- including **Pituffik**]{.mark} **Space Base** in
Greenland, which serves as a critical hub for **missile defense** and
**satellite communications**]{.underline} --- but more Arctic bases are
needed to effectively compete in the region. Similarly, the U.S. Army
established the 11th Airborne Division ["**[Arctic Angels]{.mark}**" in
2022 at Anchorage, Alaska, with 11,000 soldiers focused on extreme cold
weather operations]{.underline}. However, it is problematic that this
unit maintains "readiness for global deployments ... \[and\] for
large-scale combat operations" when it should be wholly focused on polar
warfare. Worse, the unit struggles with numerous internal morale issues.

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[ought to go **further**]{.underline}]{.mark} in building its Arctic
capabilities, by [[ramp]{.mark}ing [up]{.mark} its
[Arctic-specific]{.mark} training [programs]{.mark}]{.underline} and
investing in research and development aimed at enhancing cold-weather
operational capabilities. This includes expanding its fleet of
icebreakers, which is currently insufficient to conduct the necessary
peacetime missions, let alone support a potential conflict in the
region. However, these initiatives are unlikely due to the Arctic being
a low priority under current global force management postures. Ruthless
defense prioritization means the Arctic will likely continue to be
neglected, despite growing risks. Thus, the United States should
[[foster **greater cooperation** with its NATO Arctic
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly Canada and the Nordics, [[to
ensure]{.mark} a [**coordinated** and **effective response** to any
potential crisis in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. Undergirding that
should be civil society engagement with indigenous populations around
the Arctic Circle in a mutually beneficial way to ensure their security
and to partner with them to increase Arctic domain awareness.

A Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for the Arctic

Canada, the Nordics, and other Arctic-minded allies should lead NATO in
Arctic defense as the United States pivots to counter China in the
Indo-Pacific. The [[combined **Sino-Russian threat** is
**global**]{.mark}, and the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[needs allies to **share the burden**
of defense]{.underline}]{.mark}. The **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **NATO** should [leverage]{.mark} the
[**expertise** of Arctic allies]{.mark} to [establish]{.mark} a
Nordic-led Arctic-focused [Combined **J**]{.mark}]{.underline}oint
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**xpeditionary
**[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}**orce [[within NATO, allowing the alliance to
establish]{.mark} a]{.underline} dedicated force as a [**[credible
deterrent]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}.

Forming a Nordic-led Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for the Arctic
would [[reduce]{.mark} the [**strain** on **U.S.
forces**]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO lacks an Arctic strategy other than
an October 2024 statement about defending "Allied interests in the
Arctic." [[NATO needs]{.mark} a **[comprehensive]{.mark}** Arctic
[strategy]{.mark} that leads to investments in **infrastructure**,
**training**, and **equipment** to match Russian power]{.underline} in
the Arctic. Without proper resourcing, Russia will keep dominating the
Arctic, making it less safe for international trade, freedom of
navigation, and rule of law. [[Sino-Russian
dominance]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Arctic [[has **severe
implications** for global security]{.underline}]{.mark} and economic
stability. [[Through **collective action**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
improved Arctic-specific readiness, [[NATO can **deter** Sino-Russian
aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic while supporting a U.S.
shift to the Indo-Pacific.

preparing to invade Taiwan,"

[[China\'s attempt to **conquer Taiwan**]{.mark} by **force** \"[could
be **imminent**]{.mark}]{.underline}\", US Secretary of Defence [**Pete
Hegseth** has warned]{.underline}.

\"There\'s no reason to sugarcoat it: [the [threat]{.mark} China poses
[is **real**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" he said, speaking at the
2025 Shangri-la Dialogue defence summit in Singapore. [[Beijing]{.mark}
is \"[credibly **preparing** to]{.mark} potentially [use]{.mark}
**military [force]{.mark}** to alter the **balance of power** in the
**Indo-Pacific**]{.underline}\". And, \"to be clear: any attempt by
Communist China to conquer Taiwan by force would [[result in]{.mark}
[**devastating consequences** for]{.mark} the **Indo-Pacific** and the
**[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\"

[[Beijing views Taiwan as]{.mark} a rogue **breakaway** [territory to be
brought back under **control**, by **force**]{.mark} if necessary,
making it]{.underline} arguably \"the [[**most dangerous** place on
**Earth**]{.underline}]{.mark}\", said The Economist.

Experts \"disagree about the likelihood and timing of a Chinese
invasion\", said the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.

[[China]{.mark} has been [engaging in]{.mark} \"**unprecedented
[aggression]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **military
[modernisation]{.mark}**\",]{.underline} Admiral Samuel Paparo, the
commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, told the US Congressional Armed
Services Committee in April. Underscoring the seriousness of this
escalation, he said [China\'s [drills]{.mark} around Taiwan are \"[not
just **exercises**]{.mark} -- they are
**[rehearsals]{.mark}**]{.underline}\".

While \"alarming\", said the Atlantic Council, this \"unfortunately
reflects a broader, consistent trend\" of escalating activities by the
People\'s Liberation Army (PLA), including persistent crossings of the
Taiwan Strait\'s median line.

Data from Taiwan\'s Ministry of National Defence found that sorties
across the Taiwanese-declared dividing line between Taiwan and China
have increased from 953 incidents in 2021 to 3,070 in 2024.

There are other indications Beijing is preparing to move on Taiwan.
[[China]{.mark} has been [stockpiling record]{.mark} amounts of
**[gold]{.mark}**, which could be part of a [strategy to
**defend**]{.mark} itself [from]{.mark} Western **[sanctions]{.mark}**
in the event of an attack on Taiwan]{.underline}. It has also been
[[building]{.mark} a solid **[legal ground]{.mark}** for a potential
invasion, aiming to [frame]{.mark} the [attack as]{.mark} a
**[legit]{.mark}imate** internal matter]{.underline}.

\"This will [[help]{.mark} the country to **[delay]{.mark}** a
collective **[security]{.mark}** and [**economic** response]{.mark} from
the West]{.underline},\" said The Sun.

When could an invasion happen?

Paparo told members of Congress that the [**[PLA]{.mark}** are
\"[stretching]{.mark} their [legs\" to meet]{.mark}]{.underline}
President [Xi Jinping\'s military **[readiness goal]{.mark}** of being
capable of taking Taiwan [by]{.mark} force by
**[2027]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That year is seen as \"magical\" because
it [marks the **centenary** of]{.underline} what was to become [the
**P**]{.underline}eople\'s **[L]{.underline}**iberation
**[A]{.underline}**rmy, said Robert Fox in London\'s The Standard.

\"Others believe 2049 is a critical date,\" said the CFR, as Xi
Jinping has \"emphasised that unification with Taiwan is essential to
achieving what he calls the Chinese Dream, which sees China\'s
great-power status restored by 2049\".

How could an invasion start?

Chinese military drills last year surrounded Taiwan\'s main island with
joint exercises by all branches of the PLA and \"for the first time, the
increasingly militarised Coast Guard\", said The Guardian.

In January, Naval News first reported the construction of new amphibious
barges at Guangzhou Shipyard, in southern China.

[These [new]{.mark} barge-like **Shuiqiao [ships]{.mark}** are
potentially a [**game-changer** for Beijing]{.mark} and provide
\"insight into China\'s integration of its **military**,
**paramilitary** and **civilian** operations]{.underline} -- and its
plans for a potential invasion\", said The Guardian.

The barges feature [**[bridges]{.mark}** that could be used to
[transport **tanks** and **supplies**]{.mark} over previously
**uncrossable** land]{.underline}, said The Telegraph, giving them
multiple fronts for an invasion and \"thinning out\" Taiwan\'s line of
defence.

The likely strategy is to [[**overwhelm** Taiwan with]{.mark}
a **massive attack** with **[little warning]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

That would mean in the early hours of a Chinese invasion, the narrow
strait separating the island from the mainland would likely be
\"transformed into a ferocious battlefield\", said Business Insider.
[Aside from deploying]{.underline} more traditional weapons such as
[**[missiles]{.mark}** or **[warships]{.mark}**]{.underline}, \"vast
fleets of unmanned aerial and naval [**[drones]{.mark}** will likely
**[darken the skies]{.mark}** and [**hide** beneath
**waves**]{.mark}]{.underline}, bringing with them a deadly threat that
Taiwan and its allies are ill-prepared to counter\". During Joe Biden\'s
presidency, the US strategy to counter this -- dubbed \"Hellscape\" --
hinged on deploying thousands of new drones that would swarm the Taiwan
Strait and keep China\'s military busy until more help could arrive.

How would it play out?

[Chinese action against Taiwan]{.underline} would be an \"act of war
that [[sparks a **global crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark}\", said The Wall
Street Journal. \"It would [[provoke]{.mark} a **[military
response]{.mark}** by Taiwan, [force]{.mark}]{.underline} President
[[Trump to decide whether]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark} military**
[should]{.mark} [help]{.mark} **defend** the island, [disrupt]{.mark}
global **[trade]{.mark}** and [impel]{.mark} European nations to impose
punishing **[sanctions]{.mark}** on Beijing]{.underline}.\"

If a conflict were to break out it would be \"a catastrophe\", said the
Economist. This is first because of \"the bloodshed in Taiwan\", but
also because of the [[risk]{.mark} of \"[**escalation** between two
**nuclear powers**]{.mark}\", namely the **US** and
**China**]{.underline}.

Beijing massively outguns Taiwan, with estimates from the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute showing that China spent about 23
times more on its military in 2021. The PLA also boasts more than two
million active soldiers. The US is bound by the Taiwan Relations Act to
\"provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character\" and discourage
China from using force or coercion to achieve its goals regarding the
island. This could see Washington drawn into any conflict -- although
there is growing scepticism in Taipei that Trump would intervene
militarily in the event of a full-blown Chinese attack.

That means any [invasion \"would be one of the [**most dangerous** and
**consequential** events of the **21st**]{.mark}
**[century]{.mark}**]{.underline}\", said The Times, and \"[would
[make]{.mark} the Russian attack on [**Ukraine** look like a
**sideshow**]{.mark} by **comparison**]{.underline}\".

#### Invasion spirals into a [wave]{.underline} of [global catastrophes]{.underline}\-\--extinction.

Fall," no. 23.2\]

American policymakers and military leaders are increasingly convinced
that the [[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait is the strategic **nerve center** of
the **world**. **No other** [flashpoint is]{.mark} as structurally
**[unstable]{.mark}**, as]{.underline} politically vexing, and as
[likely to **draw** the world's leading **superpowers** into a
war]{.underline}. Through both word and deed, Chairman Xi Jinping and
the Chinese Communist Party ([[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}) elite [are
signaling their intention to [**annihilate**
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}'s government [[through]{.underline}]{.mark}
the use of overwhelming **[[force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is a
growing concern in Washington that it may no longer be a question of if
a Chinese attack on Taiwan will occur, but when and how.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

Of course, it is debatable whether the CCP high command is operating
according to a cast iron timeline. While prudent U.S. defense planners
might assume that the countdown to war has already begun (and argue that
countervailing American and Taiwanese preparations should proceed
accordingly), wise strategists will not close their minds to other
possibilities. It may very well be the case that Xi Jinping's plans and
intentions for Taiwan are elastic and changeable. For all we know, Xi is
convinced that a long-term campaign of coercion will succeed at
crumbling the Taiwanese government's ability to resist annexation. It
may even be the case that several politicians in Taiwan have been
secretly cultivated by Chinese intelligence, and they might one day
collaborate with the CCP to affect a takeover. The purpose of this
paper, however, is not to discuss such analytic problems, but rather to
explore what lies beyond the compass of the current discourse. An
understudied aspect of the Taiwan defense debate is what would happen
after an invasion was over. What might happen, for example, if the
People's Republic of China (PRC) succeeded in conquering Taiwan? How
would that impact U.S. national security? If Taiwan (Republic of China,
ROC) falls, what would the implications be for regional and global
security? In the following pages, we will examine these questions and
attempt to come to grips with an overlooked aspect of the most
consequential foreign policy problem of our time. Into the Great Unknown
It is axiomatic that there is no way for us to know how the future will
unfold. Unlike a code, puzzle, or cipher, the future cannot be solved.
There is no master key that can crack open the door and give us a look
at the scenes that will appear weeks, months, and years from now. At the
present time, we stand at the entryway of the here and now straining to
peer ahead, but we see nothing because there is nothing to see. That
world has yet to exist. Since accurate prediction is impossible and the
science of time travel remains speculative, we must exercise our
imaginations and, to a certain degree, our logic. We must think about
the unthinkable and accept that any thoughts we think will almost
certainly be falsified by events. Indeed, we will cherish the hope that
the future plays out in different ways entirely. With luck, the
following scenarios will prove wrong. Tens of millions of lives are at
stake, and the fates of billions of people could be irrevocably altered
by war in ways that we are ill- equipped to forecast. For the sake of
keeping our thought exercise within reasonable bounds, we will explore
only two of the manifold scenarios that are available or could be
conjured. In the first of our imagined futures, Taiwan is invaded by the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) and falls with no outside assistance from
the United States or others. In the second imagined future, Taiwan is
stormed and occupied by the PLA in spite of belated U.S. and allied
attempts to forestall that eventuality. In scrutinizing both cases, our
main concern will not be the finer details of how the storyline
unspools, but rather what the situation looks like once it does and what
the implications are for the United States and the region. But before we
plunge into our two nightmare scenarios, let us first take stock of what
it would mean for the United States to lose Taiwan as a democratic
partner and strategic bulwark against PRC expansionism. The Constants If
Taiwan falls, several implications will remain constant irrespective of
how it happens. Taiwan has outsized strategic value due to its
extraordinary political character, its unique military and intelligence
capabilities, its critical role in global high-tech supply chains, and
its geographic location in the heart of East Asia. Regardless of how
Taiwan is captured by the Chinese authorities, the region and the world
will have lost a leading democracy, and the security architecture of the
region will be altered. This would be a traumatic---and potentially
catastrophic---event in the history of American foreign policy. When a
Democracy Dies At the time of this writing, Taiwan is ranked among the
top 10 democracies in the world.1 Freedom House gave Taiwan a composite
score of 94 out of 100 when it came to measures of global freedom (in
comparison the United States ranked 83 and China ranked 9).2 Reporters
Without Borders recently said that Taiwan has a remarkably high level of
press freedom. Taiwan ranked 38 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom
Index (in comparison the United States ranked 42 and China ranked 175).3
Since its transition to democracy, Taiwan has not had a seat at the
United Nations or other international organizations. The United States
and many other countries nonetheless have robust unofficial
relationships with Taiwan, and Taiwan is widely considered by
governments across the democratic world to be a responsible, like-minded
partner and a model of good governance. Today, Taiwan can be counted on
to advance democratic values and human rights. If Taiwan was conquered,
it would become an occupied territory ruled by China's one-party
dictatorship. Its politics would fundamentally change. The free and
independent country that used to be Taiwan (ROC) would disappear, and a
repressive police state would emerge. The Chinese military would
establish an overwhelming presence on Taiwan alongside the CCP's
multi-layered internal security forces (MSS, MPS, PAP, Chengguan, etc.).
The Communist Party can be expected to employ terror tactics against the
local Taiwanese population. The mass surveillance and control complex
that is omnipresent in Xinjiang and Tibet would likely be exported to
Taiwan. A local proxy government under the direct control of Beijing
would rule the islands, and all territory formerly administered by the
ROC government would be harshly policed. Patriotic education and mass
propaganda campaigns would be launched in Taiwan to spread "Xi Jinping
Thought" and imprint "Chinese socialist values" onto the minds of the
vanquished population. A number of Taiwan's film, television, and
Mandopop stars can be expected to amplify Beijing's messages (many
already do). The post-invasion media environment would be characterized
by its high levels of censorship. Taiwan would exist on the brink of an
informational blackhole. While international reporters would not have
open access to Taiwan, it seems almost certain that scattered pieces of
information would emerge out of occupied areas in the form of grisly
pictures, video recordings, and refugee testimony that show violations
of human rights were underway.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONTINUE\>\>

Having lost one of its leading representatives, the [**free world**
would likely be in the presence of]{.underline} a
**[growing]{.underline}** sense that [**illiberal** forces]{.underline}
were on the march and **[[authoritarianism]{.underline}]{.mark}** was
[[spread]{.mark}ing in an **[unchecked]{.mark}** fashion]{.underline}.
The loss of Taiwan could [lead many democracies to experience a **crisis
of confidence**. Many]{.underline} observers might [draw the conclusion
that China's]{.underline} Marxist-Leninist [model was
**superior**]{.underline}---or at the very least ascendant---and liberal
democracies too weak to resist the new world order that Beijing was
creating.

Lost Military and Intelligence Capabilities

Taiwan's military stands watch over the vulnerable flanks of Japan's
southwestern approaches, protecting Japan and other East Asian countries
from the threat of PRC expansionism. Indeed, the ROC armed forces patrol
and monitor some of the world's busiest lines of communication. The air,
water, and electromagnetic spectrum around Taiwan are dense with all
manner of military and commercial traffic. Although often
unacknowledged, Taiwan's military has long been a reliable partner to
the United States on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
operations. The U.S. and ROC governments reportedly share intelligence,
which the Americans are well positioned to collect with sophisticated
satellites, aircraft, and submarines, and the Taiwanese collect with
human agents, listening posts, and surveillance radars.4

If Taiwan falls, its military bases and intelligence facilities would be
occupied by the PLA. The Chinese navy can be expected to base its ships
and submarines in Taiwan's deep-water ports. The naval bases at Su'ao
and Keelung would be especially valuable for the PLA, which for the
first time in its history would have unencumbered access to the deep
waters of the Pacific. The American, Japanese, and Taiwanese
surveillance systems that currently track Chinese submarines in the
shallow waters off the East Asian littorals would be rendered less
effective (or completely neutralized in Taiwan's case).

By invading and occupying Taiwan, the [PLA would breach the **center**
of the First Island Chain]{.underline}. After the invasion, Chinese
bombers and missile units based on Taiwan would be able to
[hold]{.underline} U.S. forces in [**[Okinawa]{.mark}** and [**Guam** at
risk of]{.mark} **surprise [raids]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Chinese
special forces and amphibious units [could use Taiwan to
**[invade]{.mark}** Japan's **Ryukyu**]{.underline} islands
([**Yonaguni**, **Ishigaki**]{.underline}, etc.) [and Luzon, the
**[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline}' largest and most populated
island. PLA Navy surface action groups and aviation units based in
Taiwan and the Penghu islands could [threaten a **blockade** of Japan
and South **[Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline} by cutting off their primary
sea lines of communication. The [top of the
**[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea [would be
"**corked**"]{.underline}---providing PLA ballistic missile submarines
with a maritime bastion and further [reinforcing China's military
**dominance**]{.underline} of Southeast Asia.

The United States would lose access to a critical intelligence gathering
hub, and the American analytic community would lose their primary window
into China. Taiwan is an irreplaceable source of Mandarin language
training and all-source intelligence on China. Without Taiwan, the
Pentagon and CIA would likely begin producing flawed analytical
products, which could leave policymakers ill-informed and prone to
making strategic mistakes. In the wake of the successful Chinese
invasion of Taiwan, U.S. intelligence failures could be expected to
increase.

Shattered Supply Chains

Today, Taiwan is the United States' 8th largest trading partner.5
According to the State Department: "U.S. exports of goods and services
to Taiwan supported an estimated 188,000 American jobs in 2019 \...
Taiwanese cumulative investment in the United States was nearly \$137
billion in 2020. Taiwan's direct investment \... directly support an
estimated 21,000 jobs in the United States and \$1.5 billion in U.S.
exports."6 A cross-Strait war would cost hundreds of thousands of
Americans their jobs, and hundreds of billions of dollars would be lost.

Further deeper economic pain would likely follow the initial blow to
American prosperity. "U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Taiwan
(stock) was \$31.5 billion in 2020, a 8.8 percent increase from 2019.
Reported U.S. direct investment in Taiwan is led by manufacturing,
finance and insurance, and wholesale trade," according to the Office of
the United States TradeRepresentative.7

[The loss of Taiwan would]{.underline} negatively impact the health of
the U.S. economy and could [[trigger]{.mark} an economic
**[recession]{.mark}**]{.underline} in America and [[across]{.mark} the
**[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A recent report asserted that "[Taiwan
may be the **most critical link** in the entire **tech**nology
ecosystem]{.underline}," [due to its **dominance** in]{.underline} the
**[chip sector]{.underline}**, original equipment manufacturing,
original design manufacturing, and role as a central hub for producing
technology-related materials. The report found, "Taiwan currently serves
as a [key supplier]{.underline} and partner [to]{.underline} many
leading [U.S. **tech**nology **firms** like Apple, Nvidia, Texas
Instruments, and Qualcomn, as well as to many U.S. allies
globally]{.underline}."8 [That would all **disappear**]{.underline},
forcing companies to suffer massive profit losses at the very moment
they needed to invest in costly new facilities.

It is possible that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would cause a 21st
century version of the **[Great [Depression]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
any event, globalization would probably cease to exist, as the world
[[splinter]{.mark}ed into **[hostile]{.mark}**]{.underline} trade and
[security [blocs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Supply chains]{.mark}**,
already]{.underline} significantly [impacted by]{.underline} the
COVID-19 [pandemic]{.underline}, the Russian invasion of [Ukraine,
and]{.underline} instability in the [Middle East, would be
**[shattered]{.mark}**. [Prices]{.mark} would
**[skyrocket]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Panic buying and hording would be
followed by a [[surge]{.mark} in [**nativism** and]{.mark} strong
impulse toward]{.underline} trade
**[[protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and self-sufficiency.

Harsh Geostrategic Realities

By seizing Taiwan, the [PRC would have]{.underline} effectively
[**carved** out a **s**]{.underline}phere **[o]{.underline}**f
**[i]{.underline}**nfluence for itself in Asia using violent methods.
This invasion would [have grave implications for **i**nternational
**law**]{.underline}, the ideal of national self-determination, and the
principle of state sovereignty. The fall of Taiwan [would undermine
**perceptions** of U.S.]{.underline} global diplomatic and **[military
leadership]{.underline}**, straining (and possibly
**[[break]{.mark}ing]{.underline}**) [the [America]{.mark}n
**[alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} system [and]{.underline} the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations System. [China would
be]{.underline} viewed as [the **most powerful** nation in the
**world**]{.underline} and the primary mover of the 21st century.
Leaders would experience trepidation as Beijing marched
[toward]{.underline} its vision of a **[new]{.underline}** centralized,
[**authoritarian** world order]{.underline}.

[[Nuclear **arms racing**]{.underline}]{.mark} would start and [could
easily rapidly **[spiral]{.mark}** out of control]{.underline}. The
likelihood of **[[World War Three]{.underline}]{.mark}** breaking out
could [[climb]{.mark} **higher**]{.underline} than anything previously
seen. It can be expected that the [**world** would begin sliding
toward]{.underline} the brink of an **[abyss]{.underline}**, and human
[**[civilization]{.mark}** would risk being **[knocked]{.mark}
backward**]{.underline} in its developmental story. Abstract ideas like
international law and universal values would increasingly appear quaint,
even faintly ridiculous. This would be a new age of empires; might would
once more make right.

In such circumstances, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} could be expected to
go nuclear and [become heavily **[militarize]{.mark}d**]{.underline}.
Tokyo would likely be in the grip of a profound sense of insecurity and
disillusionment with U.S. defense guarantees. It is possible that
[Japanese politics could [swing in]{.mark} a **right-wing**,
[**authoritarian** direction]{.mark}. Alternatively]{.underline}, it is
possible that far left-wing politicians could gain power, and Japan
might [end up **band wagoning** with China]{.underline}. In either
event, there would be an increasing risk that Japan's democracy would
erode, and the country could experience a wave of political violence.
Over time, it may even be [possible]{.underline} that [Japan would
become a **dictatorship**]{.underline}.

South Korea would almost certainly feel itself being pulled into China
orbit, and policymakers in Seoul would face the unpalatable choice of
losing of their freedom and sovereignty or resisting CCP influence
alongside the United States and Japan. [**South [Korea]{.mark}** would
likely [go **nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} and attempt to save their
nation from takeover by [building an independent **deterrent
force**]{.underline}. South Korea may experience an even deeper domestic
political crisis than Japan. It seems likely that the [**Philippines**,
**Indonesia**, **Malaysia**]{.underline}, and other Southeast Asia
nations that are currently hedging their bets would conclude that they
had no choice but to **[align]{.underline}** themselves [with
Beijing]{.underline} against the United States.

[**[North]{.mark} Korea** would likely be
**[emboldened]{.mark}**]{.underline} by a successful Chinese invasion of
Taiwan and reconsider long-dormant **[plan]{.underline}**s
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} weaken and, if possible, [**destroy** South
Korea's government and affect a **[takeover]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
the peninsula. With the power and prestige of the United States
drastically reduced and South Korea acutely vulnerable, it seems
probable that North Korea would seek to obtain China's help in attacking
South Korea. [Beijing]{.underline} is likely to [see the situation as an
**opportunity** to drive American forces **off** the Asian mainland.
China's government would]{.underline} probably
**[encourage]{.underline}** and support some degree of [North Korean
aggression]{.underline}. At a minimum, an unprecedented campaign of
coercion would likely result, which could escalate to war. At the same
time, CCP influence over Pyongyang would grow, and North Korea would
struggle in vain to maintain its independence from the new PRC empire.
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}** would almost certainly see the loss of
Taiwan as a national security disaster and [quickly **[expand]{.mark}**
its **[nuc]{.mark}**]{.underline}lear weapons [arsenal and further
**build up** its conventional **military** along the
**border**]{.underline}. With Taiwan gone, the [PLA would likely focus
on **re-taking** territories controlled by **Delhi**]{.underline} as its
next major mission. [**[Australia]{.mark}** will [fear]{.mark} being
**[encircled]{.mark}**]{.underline} and isolated as the Chinese military
pushes across the South Pacific. [**Canberra** might opt to
[develop]{.mark}]{.underline} its own independent [[**nuclear**
armaments]{.underline}]{.mark} program and accelerate plans to acquire
nuclear-powered submarines. The Quad would be at a distinctive
crossroads; it may become the foundation for a collective security
organization like NATO, but it could just as easily fall apart.

A similar crossroads would be reached in Europe. With the United States
distracted humiliated by China, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
countries might rally together in common cause and redouble their
efforts to bolster collective security. It seems at least as probable,
however, that the post-war bonds that have long tied together the great
democracies of Europe [would **fray**. Combined Chinese and Russian
**influence**]{.underline} campaigns might [**succeed** in getting
countries such as **Germany**, **France**, and **Italy** to
[embrace]{.mark} **pro-[Beijing]{.mark}** policies]{.underline} that
drive them against the United States [[and **fatally fracture**]{.mark}

[[As the **Russia-China axis**]{.mark} further [aligns itself against
the **U.S.** and]{.mark} its **[NATO]{.mark}** allies, the power
struggle has [expanded to]{.mark}]{.underline} a new, previously
ice-locked frontier: [the **[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

When [American [fighters intercepted]{.mark} two Russian and two Chinese
[**bombers** in]{.mark} the]{.underline} U.S. **[A]{.underline}**ir
**[D]{.underline}**efense **[I]{.underline}**dentification
**[Z]{.underline}**one (ADIZ) [over **[Alaska]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
July, the [[**unprecedented** move underscored]{.mark} this increasingly
**[assertive]{.mark}** and [**expansive**
partnership]{.mark}]{.underline}. And while Beijing [and Moscow have
been working to establish a **strategic foothold** in the region for
more than a **decade**]{.underline}, Washington and Brussels are just
now waking up to the threat.

[The clock is **ticking**, and the West is on **thin ice**]{.underline}.

[[Just how important]{.mark} the [Arctic is to Russia in terms
of]{.mark} maintaining its threatening **[nuclear posture]{.mark}**
toward the U.S. [cannot be overstated]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a nuclear
exchange, [[Moscow]{.mark} would likely [fire]{.mark} long-range
**[ballistic missiles]{.mark}** --- from]{.underline} ballistic missile
submarine [[bases near the **Kola Peninsula**]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
through the poorly surveyed airspace over Greenland. And hindered by low
visibility in the Arctic, U.S. [[forces]{.mark} would be
**[ill-prepared]{.mark}**]{.underline} to detect and counter the strike.

Russia has been building up this Arctic force since its 2014 invasion of
Crimea. In its efforts, melting sea ice has presented both opportunities
and challenges for the country. On the one hand, the economic importance
of Russia's Arctic coastline is growing because of its commercialization
as a feasible shipping route, allowing Moscow to profit from providing
short shipping routes for commercial vessels carrying cargo between Asia
and Europe. However, more traffic also means Russia's control of its
vast Arctic coastline --- stretching from the Barents Sea in the west to
the Bering Strait in the east --- is now threatened.

So, using a dense network of air defense, aviation and ground forces at
its Northern Fleet bases, Russia has been focusing on closing off access
to the Kola Peninsula at the Barents Sea to protect its strategic
submarine force and preserve the fleet's year-round access to the
Atlantic. It has also invested heavily in precision-guided missile
technology to threaten distant targets and achieve sea denial without
having to deploy traditional naval or air forces.

Additionally, in order to maintain and operate a strategic submarine
force near Alaska without relying on Northern Fleet repair facilities at
the other end of Eurasia, Russia has constructed new hardened submarine
shelter pens and repair and maintenance facilities south of the Bering
Strait near Vladivostok.

[Amid all this]{.underline}, as further evidence of its "no-limits"
partnership with Russia, [**[China]{.mark}** has been
[developing]{.mark} its **[dual-use]{.mark}** Arctic
[capabilities]{.mark} too, [**bolstering** Russia's ability to
**threaten**]{.mark} the **U.S.** and]{.underline} its [**NATO** allies
while [diverting]{.mark} [attention from]{.mark} the
**[Indo-Pacific]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It has also increased its
regional civilian and military cooperation with Moscow, linking its
polar Silk Road to the Russian Arctic by investing in infrastructure.

As it stands, China's [polar [**satellites**,
**u**]{.mark}]{.underline}nmanned **[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**nderwater
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle[**[s]{.mark}** and research
**vessels**]{.underline} --- three of which are icebreakers --- [[give
Beijing an **edge**]{.underline}]{.mark} in terms of tracking shipping
routes, mapping the Arctic seabed and monitoring sea-ice and aerial
movements. And with the joint venture between Russia's state-owned
nuclear energy firm Rosatom and China's Hainan Yangpu NewNew Shipping
company, the two countries will now cooperate on building infrastructure
and ice-class container vessels to operate a year-round Arctic route.
The [[collaboration empowers Moscow to **monitor** and **control**
activities]{.mark} along its Arctic coastline]{.underline}, and to
better protect Russian ballistic missile submarines as well.

Taken altogether, [Russia's and China's [**maritime**, **cyber** and
**space** capabilities]{.mark} in the Arctic now **[threaten]{.mark}**
NATO's [sparse **communications** and data
**infra**]{.mark}**structure**]{.underline} in the region.
Communications [[cables weren't built to withstand **hybrid
warfare**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Plus, [[insufficient **radars**]{.mark},
surveillance **[drones]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [**unmanned**
aircraft,]{.underline}]{.mark} [anti-submarine capable
**[warships]{.mark}** and [**satellite** coverage make the U.S.
**vulnerable**]{.mark} to Russia's nuclear threat]{.underline}. It
simply isn't enough for America to develop capabilities of its own.

Thus, as noted in the U.S. Department of Defense's 2024 Arctic strategy,
cooperation with NATO's Arctic allies is essential to catch up with both
Russia's and China's presence in the region. But given that the U.K.'s
defense industrial base is already struggling to deliver on its AUKUS
obligations to the U.S. and Australia; that Finland and Sweden need to
focus on security in the Baltic Sea region; and that Iceland is reliant
on the U.S. for its defense, the only Arctic-adjacent NATO allies
currently sharing significantly in this security burden are Canada,
Norway and Denmark.

And while these countries are committed to expanding their inventories
of icebreakers, submarines, unmanned vehicles, and communications and
data infrastructure, they're also fairly small nations with conflicting
demands on their defense contributions: Denmark has major defense
responsibilities in the Baltic Sea and must accommodate the defense
priorities of Greenland and the Faroe Islands to retain influence over
defense decisions that directly affect it. Canada is spending much of
its defense budget on getting its faltering warship project off the
ground. And though Norway is an important partner, having announced the
acquisition of five warships and five submarines, Oslo has yet to commit
large sums toward ice-strengthened vessels that would ensure fitness for
submarine hunting across the western Arctic.

On top of this, all three countries invest heavily in strengthening
Ukraine's force posture toward Russia.

[Negotiating]{.underline} an [Arctic defense plan that can deter
**Russia** and **China** within the next decade is a **tall
order**]{.underline}. And with such a small group of reliable allies and
their competing priorities in other theaters and domains,
[[developing]{.mark} a **[credible]{.mark}** [NATO force posture]{.mark}
in the Arctic [will require a **delicate balancing
act**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### It also [modernizes]{.underline} the North Warning System (NWS).

The **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**orth **[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}**arning

and short-range [**radars** dotting]{.mark} the North American
**[Arctic]{.mark}** and Greenland [in support of **air defense**]{.mark}
and **[frontier control]{.mark}**, is [reaching]{.mark} its **[end
of]{.mark} serviceable [life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The American and
Canadian defense industries are racing for a chance to provide both
militaries with the latest technology to replace the old radars. But to
what ends? [[More sensors]{.mark} are **[not]{.mark}** [the]{.mark}
**magic [solution]{.mark}**]{.underline} to "modernizing" NORAD.
[[Sensors]{.mark} are but [one]{.mark} **very [small part]{.mark}** [of
a **wider effort**]{.mark} to reconsider what it means to **defend**
North America]{.underline} --- beyond technology and the North Warning
System.

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
is [[engaged in a **pivot** to the **Arctic** because of]{.mark}
increased [**competition** with **Russia**]{.mark} and [**China**,

implications** for]{.mark} Canada and for other partners, including
Arctic **[NATO]{.mark} allies**]{.underline} such as Denmark (Greenland)
and Norway, to contribute to air, surface, and subsurface situational
awareness beyond what the North Warning System provides. [[**NORAD**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States **[[Northern
Command]{.underline}]{.mark}** are [[responsible for defending North
America, but]{.mark} they [can no longer do so
**independent**]{.mark}**ly** [of]{.mark} the other U.S. combatant
commands and **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} allies. [The
[defense]{.mark} of North America [needs to be thought of as a **global
effort**]{.mark}]{.underline} reimagined for the 21st century.

NORAD and the North Warning System

[**[NORAD]{.mark}** has [always]{.mark} been [**closely associated**
with]{.mark} defending the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Its crest includes a broad sword facing due north, suggesting that the
avenue of potential attack against North America is through the Arctic.
Now 62 years old, [[NORAD identifies **air** and **maritime
threats**]{.mark} and provides air defense for North America. [One of
its key assets is]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**]{.underline}orth
**[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}**arning **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ystem.
The system was completed between 1986 and 1992, using 1970s technology.
It was designed to detect air bomber threats from the Soviet Union
travelling in a north-south direction.

[Washington and Ottawa are rethinking how to defend North America.
Adversaries, especially [**Russia**, have access to **advanced
tech**]{.mark}**nologies** and capabilities and [can strike from
**multiple directions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States and
Canada need to focus on increasing "all-domain" awareness, improving
command and control, and enhancing targeting capabilities for a new
security environment and peer adversaries.
[[Upgrading]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**orth
**[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}**arning **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ystem
[[**exclusively** in a NORAD context]{.mark} is **[not
sufficient]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Canada and the United States need new
sensors capable of dual-use data and information collection for military
and civilian government agencies and allies in multiple domains
including land, space, maritime, and subsurface zones, in addition to
the aerospace domain. And these sensors --- which will be subject to
probing, denial of service, and cyber attacks --- are but one layer in
an ecosystem (beyond even system of systems) informed by a
reconsideration of what it means to defend North America. Canada and the
United States should embrace a posture that includes active and direct
defenses (i.e., anticipating attacks by pooling and analyzing multiple
sources of data from a variety of sources and systems at much longer
ranges vs. responding to attacks via system-specific information) of
North America. This will enable the simultaneous deterrence from attack
and defense of North America rather than simply the latter.

The impetus for the creation of NORAD and for the North Warning System
was the recognition that the Canadian and continental U.S. airspace were
functionally indivisible. They still are, but so too are the other
domains. NORAD, however, operates in the aerospace domain and only warns
in the maritime domain. New systems need to provide information and data
that can be analyzed through what the outgoing NORAD and U.S. Northern
Command commander Gen. O'Shaugnessy called "predictive analysis."

Governments and industry are focusing too narrowly on technology and a
North Warning System 2.0 as the solution to modernize NORAD. What is
more, the dependence on technical solutions from the defense industry to
provide solutions may contribute to confining modernization efforts to
the North Warning System only, at the expense of a more strategic
overview of what it means to defend North America globally.

Changing Geopolitics

[[Russia's growing]{.mark} **military [capabilities]{.mark}** and
**assertiveness** [mean that NORAD]{.mark}'s detection, deterrence, and
defeat mandate has **[never been so important]{.mark}**. The
[Arctic]{.mark} is still the [**fastest** avenue of approach to North
America]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. [pivot to the Arctic is set to
**endure** for the foreseeable future]{.underline}.

NORAD, U.S. Northern Command, and Canadian Joint Operations Command ---
the tricommand of North American defense --- deter key threats to the
region. All-domain awareness, therefore, is paramount to detect those
threats. After ignoring the region for years, Washington is now more
focused on the Arctic. The Obama and Trump White Houses have
produced five major Arctic strategies, in addition to strategies for the
various armed forces including the first-ever U.S. Department of the Air
Forces' Arctic Strategy under President Donald Trump. The document
anticipates a larger role for the space domain and, eventually, for the
newly established Space Force to defend the Arctic and contribute to
homeland defense. Given the harsh operating conditions, geography and
curvature of the earth which limit the usefulness of ground-based radars
in the extreme north, space-based satellites are essential for providing
a better picture of what is happening on the ground, at sea, and in the
air.

[The [defense of **North America**]{.mark} is [**indivisible**
from]{.mark} the [defense efforts of **NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
the other U.S. combatant commands, especially Northern Command, European
Command, Indo-Pacific Command, and Space Command --- all of which have a
role in the Arctic. [[The area of
**responsibility**]{.underline}]{.mark} seams created by the U.S.
Unified Command Plan [[and **national jurisdictions** of]{.mark} key
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} Arctic allies [[mean]{.mark} that
[NORAD]{.mark}'s missions are [part and parcel of **global efforts** to
**compete** with **China** and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Current
NORAD systems can warn of attacks --- for example, a ballistic missile
attack --- but this information is not available to other systems that
are responsible for a target's defeat. This means that precious time and
information can be lost in the translation to other systems and that
allies may be left out of the loop, including from important
intelligence that may aid in decision-making. This stovepiped approach
to defense represents a vulnerability to exploit. Nevertheless, the
North Warning System is the main set of "eyes" for NORAD. At a minimum,
its serviceable life needs to be extended while wider, strategic
discussions take place.

Industry Challenges

The North Warning System was built during the Cold War. Replacing it
will be a very different challenge. The effort will be hamstrung by
cumbersome procurement systems, an overreliance on the defense industry
for solutions, and new actors with a say in military activity,
especially in the North American Arctic.

The first challenge is the complicated procurement processes of both
Canada and the United States. While resources are often pooled to fund
joint solutions such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Project, there are
few examples of truly binationally conceived and built projects. Trying
to plan and deliver major capital projects tied to politically charged,
lengthy, and cumbersome procurement systems is bound to be a Sisyphean
task. Per the exchange of notes in 1985 for the current North Warning
System, the costing split between the United States and Canada is 60-40.
This split may be revisited, especially in light of the
worldwide recession from COVID-19. Both countries use big capital
projects to benefit domestic firms and U.S. and Canadian interests may
not always overlap.

During the Cold War, militaries could depend on governments to fund much
of the research and development and infrastructure associated with a
project like the North Warning System. The reliance on industries to
come up with solutions can release militaries from the burden of their
internal bureaucracy, but it may also make militaries too dependent on
how industry interprets a problem and conceives of the solution, as well
as on their supply chains. For example, current requirements for a new
North Warning System are for it to contribute vital information to feed
the "kill chain." This elegant but linear thinking leads to one ultimate
solution: a system that ends with defeating a target. As necessary as
that capability is, what if NORAD wants to exploit, track, or gather
intelligence on the target? If defense firms are not intimately involved
in understanding requirements, including those of other actors,
combatant commands, and allies, the technology could limit NORAD's
options. In other words, more is at stake than just new equipment. New
technology designs can introduce single points of failure or limit
redundancy and backups. When billions of dollars are at stake,
simplicity is often favored and safety add-ons the first to be
jettisoned.

Finally, Canadian and U.S. policymakers need to be cognizant of their
obligations toward indigenous peoples in the Arctic. New sensors,
infrastructure, training, or other military activity in the region will
likely be on indigenous land in Alaska, Canada, Greenland (Denmark), and
potentially in other NATO Arctic states. Not only does Article 30 of the
U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples enshrine an
obligation of militaries to consult with indigenous peoples, it is the
right thing to do and makes good business sense. Even if a new North
Warning System does not include land-based radar sites, the old
equipment needs to be decommissioned safely, requiring an extensive,
meaningful consultation and a plan for local involvement. The
environment should also be considered. No one will tolerate abandoning
old equipment to leach chemicals as was done in the past. It is cheaper
to clean up sites sooner rather than later.

Looking Ahead

America's renewed emphasis on the Arctic has placed new attention on
homeland defense, and with it, NORAD's role and assets. NORAD
modernization is far more complex and wider in scope than solely a North
Warning System renewal. Rather, Canada and the United States need to
think in terms of an evolution in North American defense writ large,
which will require dual-use technology that contributes to all-domain
awareness and action. Given the economic impact of COVID-19, there will
be pressure to spend money judiciously to benefit national economies,
which could make defense cooperation between Canada and the United
States more difficult.

For the foreseeable future, the key threats to North America will be
associated with great-power competition, including increased activity in
the Arctic. In response, Ottawa and Washington need to invest in
all-domain awareness, embrace the notion of deterrence and defense in
conjunction with allies, and focus on delivery and implementation of
workable solutions, perhaps with a view to redundancy and backups ---
not technological perfection. The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, Canada,
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** allies, and their respective defense
industries [[should **work together**]{.mark} to achieve situational
awareness [across the entire Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and consider
homeland defense anew.

#### That [caps nuclear threats]{.underline}.

Geopolitical Strategic Considerations

[A new era dominated by **Great Power**]{.underline}, but now termed
near-peer, competition and rivalry [is evident with]{.underline}
concomitant regional [**inter-state** territorial
conflicts]{.underline}. [This requires]{.underline} a
[refocus]{.underline} (or rediscovery) [of **nuclear
deterrence**]{.underline} and strategy under new conditions .

For the time being, the U.S. will remain the dominant global,
political-military power with global power projection capabilities but
both [Russia and China]{.underline} [have]{.underline} the [means to
**modernize**]{.underline} [and develop **advanced military
capabilities** that challenge the U.S.]{.underline} and the West. India
remains a country to watch.

The relatively simple and straightforward geopolitical/strategic
environments of the Cold War, and post-Cold War eras are being replaced
by a much more complicated and challenging environment of multiple peer
competitors.

[The potential]{.underline}, if not fear, [of]{.underline} the
**[escalation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} a local/regional
**[conflict]{.underline}** [between peers]{.underline} today [to a
**major nuclear exchange** will remain]{.underline} affecting decisions
regarding the threat and use of force. [Advanced]{.underline},
integrated **[surveillance]{.underline}**, [reconnaissance]{.underline},
[targeting]{.underline} [and strike complexes]{.underline} have
**[revolutionized]{.underline}** the [world of **strategic
deterrence**]{.underline}. Defences, particularly at the tactical and
theatre level, serve to complicate calculations regarding deterrence
requirements.

Natural disasters are growing in number and scope. What decades ago were
relatively rare in terms of the employment of military force in support
of civil authorities abroad and at home has increasingly become a
regular phenomenon challenging the capacity of civil and military
forces.

The [new generation of]{.underline} long range [Russian]{.underline} a

ir launched [cruise missiles]{.underline} (ALCMs), [**nuclear** or
conventional]{.underline}, [is]{.underline} the immediate **[pressing
concern]{.underline}** [for NORAD's ability to deter]{.underline},
detect [and defend North]{.underline} [America]{.underline}. [The North
Warning System]{.underline} (**[NWS]{.underline}**) [lacks]{.underline}
the [**range** to identify]{.underline} [and track Russian]{.underline}
long range [aviation]{.underline} ([bombers]{.underline}) prior to their
ALCM launch points over the Arctic Ocean, and the capability to identify
and track ALCMs in flight.

The opening of the Arctic due to global warming necessitates the
development of surveillance, and reconnaissance capability integrated
across air, land, sea, and space.

[The NWS]{.underline}, which [is a **primary source**]{.underline} of
surveillance [information for **NORAD**]{.underline}, [cannot be looked
at in isolation from North American requirements]{.underline} as a
whole. **[Future technologies]{.underline}** [enabling]{.underline}
[cruise missiles to operate at]{.underline} [even **higher speeds** and
exploit]{.underline} **[sub-orbital space]{.underline}** also [need to
be considered]{.underline} [in relation to]{.underline} the
[NWS]{.underline} and NORAD's [capability to deter]{.underline}, detect
and defend a wide range of threats [from a **360o axis**]{.underline}.

#### Lack of [NATO presence]{.underline} in the Arctic [cedes]{.underline} the Svalbard region of [Norway]{.underline} to [Russia]{.underline}. That causes [global draw-in]{.underline} AND [nuclear conflict]{.underline}\-\--extinction.

The Disputed Status of Svalbard

[**[Svalbard]{.mark}** is a **[group of islands]{.mark}**
with[in]{.mark} the **[Arctic Circle]{.mark}**, 400 miles [north
of]{.mark} mainland **[Norway]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The archipelago
has a polar climate but is influenced by the Gulf Stream and some areas
around the islands remain ice-free, although permafrost, glaciers and
snowfields cover most of the land. [Natural resources include **coal**,
**iron ore**, **copper**, **zinc**, **phosphate**, **wildlife** and
**fish**. **Oil** and **gas** reserves are believed to be present
offshore]{.underline}. Spitsbergen, the largest island, has the main
population centres, with around 2,500 permanent residents as of
2016.Footnote4 Coal mining is the only industrial activity, although its
importance is declining. Scientific research, higher education, tourism
and space-related activities are becoming more significant. Norwegian
nationals make up the largest community, but there are residents from
all over the world. The majority of people live in the capital,
Longyearbyen. The second largest settlement is Barentsburg, the coal
mining centre, where most of the archipelago's Russain population lives.
Under the terms of the Svalbard Treaty (originally the Spitsbergen
Treaty) of 1920, citizens of the 46 signatory states do not require work
or residence permits to settle in Svalbard.Footnote5

Article 1 of the [[**Svalbard Treaty** grants Norway]{.mark} 'the
**[full]{.mark}** and **absolute [sovereignty']{.mark}** [over
the]{.mark} [archipelago]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote6 However, this
[[sovereignty comes with]{.mark} certain [limitations]{.mark} imposed by
**international law**]{.underline} on Norway's right to exercise
authority. The treaty allows all signatory states equal rights to fish
and hunt on the land and in territorial waters. Nationals of contracting
parties have equal access and entry 'for any reason or object' subject
to local laws and regulations.Footnote7 Article 7 allows equal status
for property ownership and mining rights. Article 9 deals with military
restrictions and states that: 'Norway undertakes not to create nor to
allow the establishment of any naval base in the territories specified
in Article 1 and not to construct any fortification in the said
territories, which may never be used for warlike purposes'.Footnote8

Norway's White Paper on Svalbard maintains that the country 'has the
exclusive right to exercise authority over all nationalities and
companies ... throughout the territory'.Footnote9 The [[Norwegian
interpretation]{.mark} of Article 9 of the Svalbard Treaty
[**prohibits** all **foreign military activity**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, [it does not prevent access by the Norwegian armed forces in
the exercise of Norway's sovereignty]{.underline} and the protection of
the environment.Footnote10 This includes visits by Norwegian military
forces, especially coast guard vessels, and permits Norway to undertake
defensive measures, including activities under NATO's Article
5.Footnote11 [In the **absence** of a **military base** on Svalbard, the
**[overstretched coast guard]{.mark}** provides the **[only]{.mark}**
constant Norwegian maritime **[security presence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
on the archipelago.

[The Norwegian interpretation of the Svalbard Treaty is **disputed** by
**other signatories**]{.underline}. In the case of
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, it [has [provided]{.mark} a [frequent
source of **diplomatic friction**]{.mark}]{.underline} since Soviet
times.Footnote12 [**[Maritime disputes]{.mark}** have been
**particularly [contentious]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The UN Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides demarcations and establishes access
rights in both coastal and high seas areas. In 1920 territorial waters
were just three nautical miles, but [[Norway **unilaterally**
extended]{.mark} its territorial [waters around
Svalbard]{.mark}]{.underline} to the UNCLOS norm of 12 nautical miles in
2003, a change only accepted by Canada and Finland.Footnote13 The
question of an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is even more controversial.
UNCLOS allows a state to claim an EEZ on its continental shelf that can
extend up to 200 nautical miles from its coast. An EEZ gives a state
'sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring it and exploiting its
natural resources'.Footnote14 No other state can exploit the natural
resources of a recognised continental shelf without the consent of the
relevant coastal state.

As the Svalbard Treaty predates UNCLOS, its terms do not mention the
area outside territorial waters. Therefore, Norway maintains that it has
exclusive rights under UNCLOS to the continental shelf as the treaty
does not apply there.Footnote15 [[Russia]{.mark} and several other
signatory states **[disagree with]{.mark}** Norway's claim and
[**question** its entitlement to **maritime zones** around
Svalbard]{.mark} without their agreement]{.underline}.Footnote16 Despite
Norway's claim to a full EEZ around Svalbard, it has chosen not to
establish one. Rather it introduced a fisheries protection zone (FPZ) of
200 nautical miles in 1977.Footnote17 The legitimacy of the FPZ has also
been a source of dispute and not just with Russia. Several EU countries
also maintain that the terms of the Svalbard Treaty apply outside
territorial waters and on the continental shelf.Footnote18

Despite frequent disagreements over details, Russia has generally
accepted Norwegian jurisdiction over Svalbard, although it claims
special status among treaty signatories because of its long historical
association with the archipelago.Footnote19 Since the late 1990s,
Norwegian action to protect declining fishing stocks around Svalbard has
caused a number of clashes with Russian fishermen and officials. These
incidents, which had the potential to escalate, were handled by
diplomatic means.Footnote20 Russia and Norway signed a treaty in 2010
which established a maritime delimitation zone in the Barents Sea and
Arctic Ocean.Footnote21 This removed many of the wider problems
associated with fishing rights in the region, but Russia stressed that
the treaty did not resolve disagreements with regard to the delimitation
of waters around Svalbard.Footnote22 In 2015, Russia objected when
Norway opened three new blocks for oil and gas exploration near Svalbard
because it argued that this action ignored other states' rights in
accordance with the Svalbard Treaty.Footnote23

The seas around the archipelago are not the only source of disagreement.
In 2001, [[Russia objected to]{.underline}]{.mark} the introduction of
the **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**valbard
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**nvironmental
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**rotection **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ct,
[which it [claimed was an attempt]{.mark} by Norway [to
challenge]{.mark} its **[mining rights]{.mark}** on the islands [and
**impede**]{.mark} the **[Russian presence]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the
archipelago.Footnote24 Svalbard did not escape diplomatic fallout
following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. A row occurred in 2015
when Russian Deputy Prime Minister [**Dmitry [Rogozin]{.mark}**
[made]{.mark} an [**unannounced** visit to Svalbard despite being
**sanctioned**]{.mark} by Norway for his part in the Ukraine
conflict]{.underline}.Footnote25 In turn, Russia objected to a
fact-finding visit by NATO parliamentarians in 2017.Footnote26 Russia
condemns NATO's involvement in Svalbard, which it claims undermines what
it regards as the archipelago's demilitarised status. Russia's
longstanding complaints include the integration of the islands into
NATO's command structure and visits by Norwegian warships and military
cargo aircraft.Footnote27 The installation of scientific facilities,
including Svalbard Radar (1996) and the Svalbard Satellite Station
(1997), have provoked the greatest Russian ire, with perhaps justifiable
objections that these could be used to monitor ballistic missile flight
paths.Footnote28 Russian commercial helicopter operations and the
transit by Russian military personnel through Svalbard during an
exercise in 2016 have also caused disquiet on the Norwegian side. As
noted above, the Svalbard White Paper states that the Norwegian armed
forces can visit Svalbard to exercise Norway's sovereignty and protect
the environment, while foreign military activity is prohibited. Unless
it involves 'innocent passage' through territorial waters, Norway
requires any foreign military and civilian government vessels wishing to
enter the territorial waters around Svalbard to apply in advance for
diplomatic clearance.Footnote29 This policy also applies to port calls
and landings at airports.

Recently, [[diplomatic relations]{.mark} between Norway and Russia [have
**deteriorated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov raised specific complaints about Norway's Svalbard policy at a
meeting of the Barents Euro-Arctic Council in October
2017.Footnote30 The same month, [a [Russian **maritime threat**]{.mark}
**assessment** [cited Norway's attempts to establish]{.mark} 'absolute
**national [jurisdiction']{.mark}** over the archipelago as a
**[potential cause of war]{.mark}**]{.underline}.Footnote31 [[Russia
threatened **'consequences'**]{.underline}]{.mark} following the
announcement of plans to double the number of US marines training in
northern Norway from 2019 and argued that the deployment reversed the
unilateral decision made by Norway in 1949 not to base foreign troops
permanently on its territory.Footnote32 In response, Norwegian Foreign
Minister Ine Marie Eriksen Søreide denied that there were US bases in
Norway and, somewhat disingenuously, that the increased US Marine
presence was aimed at Russia.Footnote33

Security and Russia's Arctic Ambitions

Russian government statements stress constructive dialogue, development
and cooperation in the Arctic. Russia observes international agreements
to maintain maritime safety and is an active member of the Arctic
Council and other non-military regional organisations. At an Arctic
forum in 2017, President Putin declared that 'Russia believes that there
is no potential for conflict in the Arctic. International law clearly
specifies the rights of littoral and other states and provides a firm
foundation for cooperation'.Footnote34 The latest Russian National
Security Strategy also states that '\[t\]he development of equal and
mutually beneficial international cooperation in the Artic is of
particular significance'.Footnote35 The Arctic has long been a strategic
priority for Russia both economically and militarily. The Northern Sea
Route, in particular, is important for Russia's energy and industrial
development.Footnote36 However, Western sanctions following the
occupation of Crimea have had a negative impact on planned growth, which
arguably reduces Russia's incentive to cooperate in the
region.Footnote37

[**[Collaboration]{.mark}** has generally [characterised
Russia]{.mark}'s relationships with other Arctic states, [but
recently]{.mark} there is [evidence of]{.mark} a more
**[competitive]{.mark}** and [**antagonistic** approach. **Renewed
rivalry** between **NATO**]{.mark} and **[Russia]{.mark}** has
**[undermined cooperation]{.mark}** and [made disputes]{.mark} both
**[harder to resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline} and potentially more
dangerous. [[Russia]{.mark} has been [building up]{.mark} its
**[military muscle]{.mark}** in the region, with [enhancements
to]{.mark} the **[Northern Fleet]{.mark}**, two new [Arctic **infantry
brigades**, new]{.mark} and rebuilt **[military infra]{.mark}structure**
[and more]{.mark} frequent
**[exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline}.Footnote38 This build-up reflects
the security priority accorded to the Arctic by Russia at a time when
the region is on the threshold of unprecedented change and development.
However, it is also a response to Russia's growing perception of NATO as
a threat. The Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation in 2014 listed
NATO as the main external military danger.Footnote39 The Russian
National Security Strategy also described NATO as a security threat,
highlighting, in particular, the Alliance's military proximity to
Russia's borders, missile defence systems and alleged violations of
international law.Footnote40

The Kola Peninsula remains critical to Russia's national security, not
least because most of Russia's maritime strategic nuclear deterrence
forces are based in the Murmansk oblast. The Severomorsk Naval Base is
the primary home for the Northern Fleet, which accounts for around
two-thirds of the Russian Navy. Many of the fleet's ships date from the
Soviet era, but new ships, aircraft and infrastructure are being
introduced and an exercise programme has sought to improve operational
readiness. New bases have been established on Novaya Zemlya and Franz
Josef Land, while rearmament has focused on long-range anti-ship
missiles, ground-based aviation, submarines, coastal cruise missile
batteries and mines to support a layered defensive strategy intended to
keep NATO navies at a distance.Footnote41 Analysts differ over the
extent to which these developments pose a military threat to NATO. Some
have argued that Russia's military enhancements are primarily defensive.
They reflect a need to rebuild national capabilities following the deep
spending cuts of the 1990s and to address potential security challenges
in the Arctic Zone of Russia arising from increased economic activity in
the region.Footnote42 Other commentators, including NATO officials,
regard Russia's increased military capabilities, infrastructure and
activities in the Arctic as indicative of a determination to seek
military dominance.Footnote43

Norway maintains a dichotomous relationship with Russia. Its
longstanding policy is characterised by a delicate balancing act that
combines both deterrence and defence through NATO with bilateral efforts
to accommodate and reassure its giant neighbour. Norway continues to
cooperate with Russia on fisheries, border security, search and rescue
and incidents at sea. Coast guard cooperation was sheltered from the
restrictions put in place in 2014 and there is also a hotline between
the Joint Operational Headquarters at Bodø and the Northern
Fleet.Footnote44 Still, most military cooperation was suspended after
the annexation of Crimea, and Russia and NATO currently exchange less
information about exercises and deployments than during the latter part
of the Cold War.Footnote45 Norway was not informed, for example, about a
major Northern Fleet exercise in May 2018. In the case of Svalbard, no
institution currently exists to arbitrate on disagreements over alleged
illegal military activities on or around the archipelago. Annual
meetings of the Arctic chiefs of defence staff and the Arctic Security
Forces Roundtable were suspended in 2014, along with confidence-building
bilateral and multilateral exercises.Footnote46 The Arctic Council, the
primary intergovernmental forum for promoting cooperation in the region,
explicitly excludes matters of military security from its mandate.

The official Norwegian government position is that Russia does not pose
a military threat.Footnote47 Norway's strategic goal in the Arctic
region remains to ensure 'predictability and regional stability' through
respect for international law.Footnote48 There appears to be a marked
reluctance to abandon the principle that the Arctic region is 'low
tension'. However, Norway is increasingly mindful of Russia's military
capabilities in the High North and has started to increase its combat
readiness, procure new equipment and host Allied exercises,
including Trident Juncture in October 2018. Norway has urged NATO to pay
more attention to the High North and recommends strengthened maritime
capabilities, improved command structure and increased training,
exercises and presence to reinforce regional deterrence and collective
defence.Footnote49

The Russian Threat to Svalbard

In the last decade, the [[Russian armed forces]{.underline}]{.mark} have
been [[modernised to create]{.mark} a well-trained and technologically
**[advanced force]{.mark}**]{.underline} that has gained combat
experience in Ukraine and Syria. [[Recent **military
exercises**]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as Zapad 2017, [have
[demonstrated Russia's **growing**]{.mark} **military
[capabilities]{.mark}** and **alarmed** the West]{.underline}. A
Norwegian commentator even claimed that Zapad operations included
simulated attacks on Svalbard for which the Norwegian intelligence
service was completely unprepared. Footnote50 Norway's military
intelligence denied that any such 'attack' took place and Russia also
dismissed the reports.Footnote51 Some predictions about Zapad 2017 were
exaggerated or inaccurate.Footnote52 However, more sober analyses
concluded that the exercise was designed to prepare Russian forces for
major state-on-state conflict and was on a larger scale than the Russian
authorities claimed.Footnote53 The Northern Fleet (Arctic) Military
District played a major role in Zapad operations, including a simulated
intercontinental missile launch and a missile strike against an enemy
naval force.Footnote54

[[Russia]{.mark} has [revitalised]{.mark} its concept [of **'bastion'
defence**]{.mark}, which [seeks to create]{.mark} a **heavily
[defended]{.mark}** [area]{.mark} [where]{.mark} its naval
[forces]{.mark} can [operate
**unchallenged**]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote55 Norwegian defence
planners speculate that [[Russia]{.mark} might [**seize Svalbard** to
enhance]{.mark} its [ability to protect]{.mark}]{.underline} strategic
[**[nuclear sub]{.mark}marine base[s]{.mark}** and [deny NATO]{.mark}
naval forces [**access** to]{.mark} the **[northern
seas]{.mark}**]{.underline}.Footnote56 Hypothetically, an [[**attack**
on Svalbard could occur under]{.underline}]{.mark} cover of a snap
exercise by the **[[Northern Fleet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, possibly
spearheaded by the 80th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade, which is trained
for extended, independent operations in the Arctic.Footnote57 [**[Air
defence]{.mark}** systems, short-range **[ballistic]{.mark} missiles**
and [sea-launched **cruise missiles**]{.mark} would then be employed to
[create **A2/AD coverage**]{.mark} to [counter]{.mark} any
[military]{.mark} [response]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote58 Discussion
of Svalbard's vulnerability is a confidential matter. Norwegian
officials approached by the author were unwilling to be drawn on the
issue and a recent security assessment by the Norwegian Intelligence
Service made no mention of Svalbard.Footnote59 However, a non-official
Norwegian study in 2016 presented a scenario in which the archipelago
was occupied by Russian forces following spillover into the High North
from a crisis in the Baltic region. The study, set in 2030, highlighted
the difficulties Norway would have in dealing with such an incursion,
especially alone. It concluded that [[Norway's **only chance** of
deterring]{.mark} such an attack [would be]{.mark} a [**substantial
investment** in **submarines**]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[**aircraft**
equipped with]{.underline}]{.mark} long-range anti-surface and
land-attack cruise [[missiles]{.mark}, which would [raise the]{.mark}
military **[stakes]{.mark}** involved [for Russian
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote60 The current Norwegian defence
plan puts strategic emphasis on intelligence and surveillance, strike
capability, and maritime and airpower assets.Footnote61 Given the
importance of early warning and intelligence, Norway is spending
significant resources on improvements to the Norwegian Intelligence
Service,Footnote62 new maritime intelligence-collection capabilities and
P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft. Striking power is being enhanced
by 35 F-35A Lightning aircraft and new German-built submarines. Despite
substantial investment, Norway's defence spending is still recovering
from a post-Cold War low and is not expected to meet NATO's 2% spending
pledge until 2024.Footnote63 To pay for the above capabilities, Norway
plans to shrink its surface naval force over the next decade, which
means it could lack the patrol units necessary to maintain sea
control.Footnote64

Yet overt Russian military action to absorb Svalbard into a defensive
bastion would provoke a direct confrontation with NATO and could lead to
a major war. It seems a doubtful course of action unless undertaken as a
defensive measure in the early stages of a broader conflict. Hostile
action in Svalbard is more likely to take a covert, asymmetrical form,
as discussed below. Russian analyst Pavel Baev, among others, has
recently warned of Svalbard's vulnerability in this
respect.Footnote65 Duncan Depledge and James Rogers note that the
conflict in Ukraine demonstrated Russia's ability 'to modulate the
strategic balance through acts of rapid escalation and de-escalation
using forces that do not fit traditional classifications of
military/non-military'.Footnote66 They suggest that similar activity
could occur in the Arctic region. As discussed above, the peculiar
status of the archipelago provides a range of possible pretexts for
Russian intervention. Russia could claim that it was forced to act to
protect the rights of its fishermen, to maintain access under the
Svalbard Treaty to mineral resources or in response to an alleged breach
of Article 9 of the treaty. As the seizure of Crimea provided a
significant boost to President Putin's domestic popularity, it is not
unreasonable to suggest that he might be tempted to use the same ploy in
the future by changing the status of Svalbard in Russia's favour.

In Ukraine in 2014, Russian military and intelligence operatives
infiltrated targeted territory to mobilise local activists. They also
employed a sophisticated deception and disinformation campaign to hide
Russian intentions as well as the timing and scale of operations. It can
be assumed that efforts would be made to keep any hostile intentions in
Svalbard vague and activities below the threshold of NATO's collective
defence guarantee for as long as possible. Russia would also be anxious
to avoid casualties among foreign nationals based in research facilities
on Spitsbergen, especially those from NATO states and China. Russian
operations might include a mix of subversion, sabotage and low-level
violence involving Russian special forces, private military contractors
and resident Russian citizens. The temporary population of Svalbard
swells in the summer with tourists and scientists. Christian
Keyser-Amundsen suggested that a Russian operation could start with the
hidden militarisation of Barentsburg through a large intake of
'researchers' and the arrival of supply ships with large civilian
containers holding military equipment, including ballistic
missiles.Footnote67 In this scenario, the Svalbard version of Crimea's
'little green men' might seize the airport, occupy Norwegian government
buildings, and spread confusion in Norway and elsewhere by severing or
jamming electronic communications. Russia could be expected to launch a
concurrent diplomatic and informational offensive to justify its
actions, state the limited nature of its objectives and discourage NATO
intervention.

Russia's takeover of Svalbard could take the form of a raid, a temporary
seizure to 'punish' Norway for alleged breaches of the Svalbard Treaty,
before agreeing to withdraw its military forces following humiliating
Norwegian concessions on sovereignty.Footnote68 Another possibility
would be for Russia to revive the idea of a 'military condominium' on
Svalbard. The idea of a joint Norwegian-Russian base was first mooted by
Russia in 1944, but subsequently dropped at the beginning of the Cold
War.Footnote69 Punitive action against Svalbard would certainly provoke
a political crisis in NATO, cast further doubts on collective security
and further Putin's objectives of dividing the West, arguably without
the risks associated with military action in the Baltic region.

Acceptance, Escalation or Deterrence: Addressing Russian Belligerence in
Svalbard

During a speech before the NATO 2018 Brussels Summit, Secretary General
and former Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg repeated the
oft-quoted mantra that the Arctic was a place of 'low tensions' and
explained that he wanted to maintain this status by dialogue with Russia
through agencies like the Arctic Council.Footnote70 Notably, the Arctic
was not mentioned in the summit declaration and was not on the
conference agenda as a specific region of NATO concern.

[[Norway]{.mark} unequivocally [regards Svalbard as **sovereign
territory** where]{.mark} **any [hostile]{.mark} Russian
[action]{.mark}** would [trigger]{.mark} an [**Article 5**
response]{.mark} from **NATO**]{.underline}.Footnote71 However, the 2018
Brussels Summit suggests that the Alliance as a whole does not yet
regard the Arctic as a high priority and there is no available evidence
that NATO is looking at possible Crimea-type scenarios in Svalbard or
elsewhere in the High North. Some Norwegian analysts have already
expressed doubts about Alliance solidarity during a crisis over
Svalbard.Footnote72 Both its isolation and unique legal status might
provide politically expedient justifications for Allies to spurn Article
5 military options and expose the hollowness of collective defence
guarantees. NATO solidarity has, of course, already been called into
question. Policy is not determined by opinion polls, but a Pew Research
survey in 2015 alarmingly suggested that NATO publics in major states
were reluctant to support collective defence. Majorities in Italy,
France and Germany did not support the use of military force by their
country to defend a neighbouring ally involved in a military conflict
with Russia.Footnote73 US President Donald Trump's criticism of and
ambivalence towards NATO has cast further doubts about alliance
cohesion. An Economist/YouGov Poll in July 2018 suggested that a
substantial minority of Americans share Trump's doubts about the
Alliance with only 47% replying positively to a question that asked
whether the US should remain a NATO member although only 17% actually
advocated US withdrawal.Footnote74

[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} effectively [[abandoned]{.underline}]{.mark}
by its allies, [[Norway would face]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**unenviable [choice]{.mark}** [of either **refraining**]{.mark} from
**military action** and **accepting** the Russian occupation of Svalbard
[or **deliberately escalating**]{.mark}]{.underline} the conflict to a
level that might force at least its major allies to act. Unfortunately,
due to the reductions in force levels after the end of the Cold War,
[[NATO is militarily unprepared for]{.underline}]{.mark} major air-sea
[[operations in the **High North**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A proposed
military operation to retake Svalbard could also pose insurmountable
political obstacles for NATO, especially if, as in the hybrid scenario
outlined above, Russia's objectives were limited and offensive military
action could provoke an all-out war. Nathan Freier of the US Strategic
Studies Institute recently described such a situation as 'risk
confusion': circumstances where the risks of action and inaction appear
equally dangerous. Action would be provocative and escalatory, [but
[inaction represents **appeasement**, which]{.mark}]{.underline}, while
seemingly preferable as a short-term option, [could [**irretrievably
change** facts on the ground]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote75

[[The best option for Norway and its allies is to **deter**]{.mark}
Russian adventurism on **Svalbard** in the first place]{.underline}.
Norway's key bilateral strategic partnership is with the US. The US
provides technical and financial support to Norwegian intelligence and
surveillance activities and stores military equipment on Norwegian
territory. US Marines have been exercising with Norwegian troops since
2017 and this cooperation is being expanded at Norway's
request.Footnote76 Norway also holds joint exercises with the US Army,
the UK's Royal Marines and the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps. In
response to a growing perception of threat in the Arctic, the UK also
recently decided to bolster the number of Royal Marine and British Army
commandos deployed annually to Norway.Footnote77 The focus of Allied
activities is the defence of northern Norway against a possible Russian
attack across the land border. However, [[**NATO forces** could]{.mark}
also [be]{.mark} [employed to **deter** hybrid operations against
**Svalbard**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Norwegian and Allied special
operations forces (SOF) would have a particularly important role,
although, with understandable understatement, a Norwegian analyst
contacted by the author described discussion of this topic as 'a bit
sensitive'.Footnote78 Currently, US SOF regard the Arctic as a secondary
priority given the wide range of other special operational commitments,
although this stance is currently under review.Footnote79 A small SOF
presence on Svalbard could provide a deterrent effect out of all
proportion to its numbers and firepower. Some elite NATO units are
trained for the exigencies of Arctic operations and SOF are particularly
suited to the ambiguities of hybrid warfare environments when an
aggressor exerts overt and covert pressure below the level of a formal
armed conflict.Footnote80 The White Paper on Svalbard provides a clear
statement regarding Norway's right to defend the archipelago. It claims
that Norway has 'full right of control of military and defence matters'
and may 'individually and collectively implement defensive measures in
wartime or under the threat of war', notwithstanding recognised treaty
restrictions.Footnote81 A covert military presence on Svalbard during
peacetime would be a questionable proposition for both political and
logistic reasons, but a company-sized deterrent force could be airlifted
to Svalbard during a crisis given political will to act on warning
indicators. Such a move by NATO would not be without risks as the
deployment of Alliance troops would be interpreted as a breach of the
terms of the Svalbard Treaty and might trigger a Russian military
response. However, [the [**presence** of]{.mark}]{.underline} elite
Norwegian, US and other [**[Allied troops]{.mark}** in Longyearbyen
would [**prevent** Russia from]{.mark} undertaking a **[successful
hybrid operation]{.mark}** and, like NATO's multinational battlegroups
in the Baltic states, [act as a **tripwire** to threaten escalation to a
**broader armed conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Tensions are [rising now]{.underline}\-\--a [single spark]{.underline} can set [everything ablaze]{.underline}. Only [cooperation]{.underline} between the [United States]{.underline} and [NATO]{.underline} solves.

SVALBARD, NORWAY---Even in summer, the air is clear and cold in
Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost inhabited town, which is located
above the Arctic Circle in Norway's Svalbard archipelago. The message
from officials we recently spoke with there was clear, too, but also
chilling: In the High North, the geopolitical dynamics are shifting, and
the tensions are getting worse. 

[The "**High North**" is a somewhat **fluid** concept, but it generally
encompasses the space between **Norway's Arctic**, west to
**Greenland**, and east to one of the **most nuclearized** places in the
**world**, Russia's **Kola Peninsula**]{.underline}. It also usually
includes northerly regions of NATO allies Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and
Iceland, as well as surrounding waterways. 

Although the High North was not a focus of the recent NATO Summit in The
Hague, [the [situation in **Svalbard** should be]{.mark} **[squarely
in NATO's focus]{.mark}** going forward]{.underline}. Russian President
Vladimir [[**Putin** appears to view]{.mark} the [High North as]{.mark}
**increasingly [important]{.mark}** [to Russia's **military
security**]{.mark} and as an [**evocative element** of]{.mark} Russia's
**[national identity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is the [[home to]{.mark}
the **core** of [Russia's nuclear **second-strike
capability**]{.mark}]{.underline}: Russia's [submarine-launch
**ballistic missile-capable** fleet]{.underline}. This fleet is based in
Severomorsk, Murmansk, tucked behind the Kola Peninsula, about 990 miles
from Svalbard. Russian submarines must cross the shallow waters of the
Barents Sea through the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) Gap to
gain access to the depths of the broader Atlantic Ocean, where detection
is far more difficult.

The complex Arctic

"The Arctic" is not a monolithic place. The term covers vast distances,
geographic variations, and geostrategic spheres of influence. There is
the European High North and the Siberian Arctic. There's also the
Pacific Arctic, which includes Alaska and far eastern Russia, as well as
the Canadian Arctic. China is not an Arctic nation, although it serves
as an observer of the Arctic Council and refers to itself as a
"near-Arctic state." China relies on Russian passage heading north
through the Bering Strait (past Alaska and, therefore, NATO territory)
and along Russia's northern coast to transit the Arctic. 

Then there is the vast North Pole waterways and ice. Although
shipping increased by 37 percent between 2013 and 2023, the Arctic
remains a dangerous place. It is not yet a fully functioning trade and
military superhighway, or "the new Suez," as it is sometimes portrayed
in the press. There is little immediate help for a disabled ship in
distress in the most northerly Arctic routes. The Polar Code, which is
mandatory in the polar regions and implemented by the International
Maritime Organization, aims to reduce accidents and protect the
environment. Still, there are frequent reports of ships getting stuck
for weeks, such as the Sparta III, which became stranded for a month off
Dudinka, Russia, in late 2020. Scientists have also recorded severe
weather events and phenomena, such as atmospheric rivers that make
navigation unpredictable and treacherous. Consequently, shipping
insurance rates remain very high. And the distances are vast. From
Longyearbyen (a three-hour flight from Oslo), it is still another 817
miles to the North Pole. 

Heat rises

Svalbard itself is as beautiful as it is dangerous and inhospitable, and
one needs to be armed against polar bear attacks even on the outskirts
of Longyearbyen. But our conversations with local officials in the town
revealed just how active Russia and, to a lesser extent, China, are in
the High North. [[Russia]{.mark} has been trying to [**systematically
spread** narratives to **diminish respect**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} and
**acknowledgement** of [Norway's **clear sovereign control** of]{.mark}
the **[Svalbard]{.mark} archipelago**]{.underline}, which is as large as
Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg combined.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has been [[dusting off **Soviet
nostalgia**]{.mark} by hosting **Victory Day parades** in
Barentsburg]{.underline}, an isolated and nearly [defunct Russian
**mining town** located more than an hour by boat from
Longyearbyen]{.underline}. Russian residents there have been observed
wearing Soviet-era coal mining uniforms. Through binoculars, we saw a
tattered Soviet flag flying; another Soviet flag has reportedly been
placed atop a mountain peak at the nearly abandoned Russian settlement
of Pyramiden. All these [acts]{.underline} are [[intended]{.mark} both
[to antagonize]{.mark} the **[Norwegian hosts]{.mark}** and to
[cultivate **evocative messaging**]{.mark} back home in
Russia]{.underline}. While Russia does have a limited history in
Svalbard, some observers we spoke with felt that Moscow has been
contriving deeper cultural and historical connections than are reflected
by the facts. It is [hard to imagine that these are simply **isolated
examples**]{.underline} of nostalgic revivalism [rather
than]{.underline} an [**[intentional]{.mark}** and **[coordinated
initiative]{.mark}** by the **Kremlin**]{.underline}.

Provocatively, over the past year, [[Russia]{.mark}'s deputy prime
minister has appeared to [draw **veiled parallels** between]{.mark}
**[Ukraine]{.mark}** and **[Svalbard]{.mark}**. Russia also prominently
[featured Svalbard in]{.mark} its [**national strategy** for
**minerals**]{.mark}]{.underline}, approved by Putin in 2020, zeroing in
on Svalbard's oil- and mineral-rich continental shelf. In addition,
Moscow has proposed establishing an international research center on the
island staffed by members of the BRICS group of emerging economies as
another effort to "internationalize" the island chain. [There are
[accusations of]{.mark} sabotage as part of **[asymmetric
warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline} tactics by Russia, [[with]{.mark} an
**[undersea cable]{.mark}** from Svalbard [being]{.mark}
**mysteriously [damaged]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2022. 

Russia has also accused Norway of militarizing Svalbard. Moscow cites
the Svalbard Treaty, which gives Norway sovereignty over the island
while restricting activity for "warlike purposes." Perched atop a hill
near Longyearbyen, the sprawling KSAT satellite field (known as SvalSat)
has been a source of Russian complaints, as has the Norwegian Coast
Guard's activities around Svalbard's waters. Citizens of signatory
countries, including the United States, China, and Russia, can live on
Svalbard without visas, but Russia has exploited this ambiguity to
create confusion over the treaty's intentions. 

China also has a presence in Svalbard. China's Yellow River Station at
Ny-Ǻlesund, part of the Polar Research Institute of China, was
established in 2003. In addition, China has access to a remote sensing
station in Sweden. Chinese nationals are sometimes observed trying to
buy property in Longyearben, but none of them have been successful to
date (real estate and land purchases are tightly restricted in
Svalbard). For its part, China has also referenced the Svalbard Treaty
to bolster its Arctic rights. Although Russia is the main focus for
Oslo, Norwegian analysts and policymakers acknowledged to us that
China's ambitions in the Arctic appear to include Svalbard.

"Our neighbor to the east"

As world leaders gathered in The Hague for the NATO Summit this past
month, the Alliance's approach toward Russia was far from unified or
resolved. NATO has emphasized its strategic approach vis-à-vis the High
North, but places such as Svalbard could test the Alliance in unexpected
ways. US threats against Greenland have also piqued concerns about the
United States' posture toward Svalbard. Norway has emphasized its
sovereignty over Svalbard and its view that the Article 5 collective
defense clause of the North Atlantic Treaty applies to the archipelago. 

Strategically, [[Russia wants to preserve]{.mark} its [ability to
**threaten**]{.mark} and **[reach]{.mark}** the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[using]{.mark} its [fleet on]{.mark} the **[Kola
Peninsula]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It has [designs on extensive
**modernization** and **recapitalization**]{.underline}. According to a
public report released by Norway's intelligence service in February,
Russia's navy has struggled to modernize its fleet due in part to
Moscow's war against Ukraine. Moscow's plans have also been stymied by
mismanaged resources and project schedules, Western sanctions, the
difficulty of replacing key parts and equipment, and production issues.
Russia aims to build up its troop presence in its newly reestablished
Leningrad and Moscow military districts, but as a recent
open-source Finnish military intelligence assessment notes, the war in
Ukraine will temper that ambition for now. The Nordic and Baltic
countries also rightfully remain sharply focused on Russian and, to a
lesser extent, Chinese hybrid actions in the Arctic, but this problem
should not be theirs alone to bear.

Meanwhile, [[deteriorating]{.mark} **international [relations]{.mark}**
have [made]{.mark} some national [governments **wary** of sending
their]{.mark} most precious [seeds **abroad**]{.mark} --- even to
**ultra-secure** Svalbard]{.underline}, where nobody can enter other
than technicians making deposits. 

Norway may still be regarded as a good guarantor of seed sovereignty.
But [[Russia has a **long-standing settlement** there]{.mark}, where its
residents recently conducted **military-style parades**]{.underline}.
Meanwhile Vladimir Putin has accused Norway of militarizing the
archipelago by allowing visits by its naval frigates. Such
saber-rattling "follows Moscow's playbook in Ukraine," says Elisabeth
Braw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, an American think tank.
The concern is that Russia's plans to expand its activities in the
Arctic may one day include territorial ambitions at Svalbard. 

Other analysts doubt this, however. But [[if]{.mark} such [fears
**escalate**]{.mark}, Ukraine and **other [nations]{.mark}** [could
become **nervous**]{.mark} [about depositing]{.mark} their [**seeds** in
Svalbard]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would be a tragedy if the geopolitical
ambitions of Russia, the country that established the first seed banks
to protect world food supplies, should end up undermining that ambition.

#### It's key to prevent [food insecurity]{.underline} AND maintain [biodiversity.]{.underline}

**Craciun '24** \[Adriana; November 16; Institute Associate at the Scott
Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge, Professor at Boston

In An Unpredictable Future,"

Today, [**[seed banks]{.mark}** around the world are [doing much of the
work]{.mark} of [saving crop varieties that could be **essential
resources**]{.mark} under future growing conditions]{.underline}.
The [[Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark} Global Seed Vault in Norway
[[supports them **all**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is the world's most
famous backup site for seeds that are more precious than data.

Tens of thousands of new seeds from around the world arrived at the seed
vault on Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean, in
mid-October 2024. This was one of the largest deposits in the vault's
16-year history.

And on Oct. 31, crop scientists Cary Fowler and Geoffrey Hawtin, who
played key roles in creating the Global Seed Vault, received
the US\$500,000 World Food Prize, which recognizes work that has helped
increase the supply, quality or accessibility of food worldwide.

The Global Seed Vault has been politically controversial since it opened
in 2008. It is the most visible site in a global agricultural research
network associated with the United Nations and funders such as the World
Bank.

These organizations supported the Green Revolution --- a concerted
effort to introduce high-yielding seeds to developing nations in the
mid-20th century. This effort saved millions of people from starvation,
but it shifted agriculture in a technology-intensive direction. The
Global Seed Vault has become a lightning rod for critiques of that
effort and its long-term impacts.

I have visited the vault and am completing a book about connections
between scientific research on seeds and ideas about immortality over
centuries. My research shows that the Global Seed Vault's controversies
are, in part, inspired by religious associations that predate it. But
these cultural beliefs also remain essential for the vault's support and
influence and, thus, for its goal of protecting biodiversity.

Backup for a global network

[[**Several hundred million** seeds from thousands of species]{.mark} of
agricultural plants [live inside the Global Seed Vault]{.mark}. They
come from **80 nations** and are **tucked away** in special metallic
pouches that keep them **dry**]{.underline}.

The [[vault]{.mark} is [designed to **prolong**]{.mark} their
[**dormancy** at zero degrees]{.mark}]{.underline} Fahrenheit (-18
degrees Celsius) in three ice-covered caverns inside a sandstone
mountain. The air was so cold inside that when I entered the vault, my
eyelashes and the inside of my nose froze.

The Global Seed Vault is owned by Norway and run by the Nordic Genetic
Resources Centre. It was created under a U.N. treaty governing over
1,700 seed banks, where seeds are stored away from farms, to serve as
what the U.N. calls "the [[**ultimate insurance policy** for the
**world's food supply**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

This [[network enables **nations**,
**n**]{.underline}]{.mark}on**[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**overnmental
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
scientists, [[and **farmers** to save]{.mark} and [exchange seeds for
research, breeding, and replanting]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [vault is
the **backup collection** for all of these seed banks]{.underline},
storing their duplicate seeds at no charge to them.

Why The Seed Vault Matters

The vault's Arctic location and striking appearance contribute to both
its public appeal and its controversies.

Svalbard is often described as a remote, frozen wasteland. For
conspiracy theorists, early visits to the Global Seed Vault by
billionaires such as Bill Gates and George Soros and representatives
from Google and Monsanto signaled that the vault had a secret purpose
or benefited global elites.

In fact, however, the archipelago of Svalbard has daily flights to other
Norwegian cities. Its cosmopolitan capital, Longyearbyen, is home to
2,700 people from 50 countries, drawn by ecotourism and scientific
research -- hardly a well-hidden site for covert activities.

The vault's entrance features a striking installation by Norwegian
artist Dyveke Sanne. An illuminated kaleidoscope of mirrors, this iconic
artwork glows in the long Arctic night and draws many tourists.

[[Because of]{.mark} its [mission to **preserve seeds**]{.mark} through
potential disasters, [media regularly describe]{.mark} the Global Seed
Vault [as]{.mark} the "**[doomsday vault]{.mark}**]{.underline}" or a
"modern Noah's Ark." Singled out based on its location, appearance,
and associations with Biblical myths such as the Flood, the Garden of
Eden and the apocalypse, the vault has acquired a public meaning unlike
that of any other seed bank.

The politics of seed conservation

One consequence is that the vault often serves as a lightning rod for
critics who view seed conservation as the latest stage in a long history
of Europeans removing natural resources from developing nations. But
these critiques don't really reflect how the Global Seed Vault works.

The vault and its sister seed banks don't diminish the cultivation of
seeds grown by farmers in fields. The two methods complement one
another, and seed depositors retain ownership of their seeds.

Another misleading criticism argues that storing seeds at
Svalbard prevents these plants from adapting to climate change and could
render them useless in a warmer future. But [[storing seeds in a
**dormant state**]{.mark} actually [mirrors plants' own **survival
strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[**[Dormancy]{.mark}** is the mysterious plant [behavior that
"**protects** against]{.mark} an **[unpredictable
future]{.mark}**]{.underline}," according to biologist Anthony Trewavas.
[[Plants]{.mark} are [**experts** in coping with **climate**]{.mark}
**unpredictability** [by]{.mark} essentially
[hibernating]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Food wars go [nuclear]{.underline}\-\--extinction.

**Karagül '22** \[Ibrahim; January 1; Turkish journalist, former editor
in chief of the newspaper Yeni Safak, J.D. from Dokuz Eylül University;
"The food wars have begun! This constitutes both an external and
internal threat! Food prices are an issue of national security. A state
of emergency must be declared in agriculture,"

[[Prices]{.mark} will]{.underline} **[[rise
globally]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including in the U.S. and Europe; a
significant portion of lower-income states will be doomed to famine. The
fact that the U.S. and Europe are gravely concerned about inflation for
the first time is an indication that this process has already started.

A horrific power struggle

The **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 pandemic [drove global]{.underline}
**[production]{.underline}** [to a halt, cutting]{.underline} **[supply
lines]{.underline}**. The world stood still for two years. Surely this
would lead to grave consequences. However, this is not what we are
discussing here. It goes much beyond that.

Within the global economy, conflicts and battles arise more so than
production and supply crises. This [[conflict]{.mark} will
be]{.underline} **[[prolonged]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[through]{.underline} **[resources]{.underline}**, markets, and trade
corridors.

This new situation will be [a]{.underline} [**[geopolitical]{.mark}
showdown**, a]{.underline} [horrific]{.underline} power
**[[battle]{.underline}]{.mark}** sustained **[through]{.underline}**
[the economy]{.underline}.

Reliable basins of solidarity

Great pressure will form over countries. No state will have the strength
to resist on its own. They will be driven to seek asylum in regional
solidarity basins. Every country will seek new and reliable refuges.

This is the reason underlying Europe's withdrawal, the U.S.'s
contraction, African countries' search for new asylums, and rapid
convergence with Turkey.

This is why Middle Eastern countries have suddenly shifted their axis
and Russia took advantage of the opportunity and returned to its former
imperial region.

Food wars: Both an internal and foreign threat

[We now have a]{.underline} **[[new]{.underline}]{.mark}** sort of
**[[security threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that
[spells]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[doom]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[for
countries experiencing]{.mark} **[production]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
resource **[[issues]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This will pose both an
internal and external threat.

[As]{.underline} **[price hikes]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[food
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}** within [[lead to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**mass [eruptions]{.mark}**, [those]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[abroad]{.underline}**]{.mark} [will [take]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[advantage]{.underline}**]{.mark} of this situation. **[Foreign
threats]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[attacks]{.underline}** [will
be plotted through these social explosions. Weak [countries]{.mark} may
[experience]{.mark} major **[plundering]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[We will witness]{.underline} **[appalling]{.underline}** state
**[brutality]{.underline}**. This signifies [**[war]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline}]{.mark} **[countries]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[[regions]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- and it has
already begun. [Countries will]{.underline} **[disperse]{.underline}**;
new partnerships will be established; the human race's greed will peak.

Kazakhstan is the first global example. Countries may be divided.

The unrest in Kazakhstan is an internal conflict scenario in which price
hikes and income inequality will be utilized as weapons, leading to that
country's division and border changes.

Kazakhstan is currently under attack, both internally and externally. If
it fails to overcome this, the central government will atrophy, leading
to the country's collapse. The threat truly is this great, and tells the
world a great deal.

Kazakhstan is the first such example, and many countries face the same
threat. This is the primary concern for all Central Asian countries.
[**[Russia]{.mark}** and **[China]{.mark}** will not let this
opportunity]{.underline} **[pass]{.underline}** them
**[by]{.underline}**. Furthermore, [the [**U.S.** and
**Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline} will fully exploit this weakness.

Our opposition's aim is the same, but it's miscalculated

Strangely, the political opposition in Turkey has also been reformatted
within the scope of this plan and in accordance with this conflict.
Their political theories, their discourse, their use of the country's
weaknesses as weapons are all within the scope of this project.

This is the reason behind their heedless partnerships with the terrorist
organizations fighting Turkey within, and their submission to those
threatening Turkey from abroad. Turkey's issue is certainly not internal
politics, but the clash of global scenarios. But they have
miscalculated.

[The number of **global [superpowers]{.mark}** has]{.underline}
**[grown]{.underline}**. Turkey is a central country, as well as a hub
of attraction. There will be clustering around Turkey as well. Hence,
Turkey will not be affected by this formatting process.

Food prices are a national security issue

Let us get to more concrete matters.

1\. [[Food will be]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[most [critical reason
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** conflict -- and in fact
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [in]{.underline}
**[2022]{.underline}**. The greed of rich countries, their preparations
for the future will drive some countries to famine and poverty. Thus,
this will pose both an internal and foreign threat to some countries.

2\. Turkey must take very strict measures to protect its food resources.
It must increase its reserves and prepare for the future.

3\. If necessary, it must determine very strict principles regarding
food prices. Regulations regarding producers, suppliers, and grocery
stores must be made a national security issue.

The Ministry of Agriculture must take action like the defense industry

An emergency process must be launched in terms of utilizing agricultural
areas. Even the tiniest parcel of land must be put to use. It must
become obligatory through tight control to process agricultural areas.

4\. Strong incentives, measures, and control must be introduced to
individual and corporate production. Special regulations and
facilitations should be introduced for countries involved in
agricultural activities.

5\. The Agriculture Ministry should declare mobilization. Revolutionary
regulations should be introduced to guarantee the next decades of our
country.

6\. The great breakthroughs made in the defense industry are necessary
in agriculture as well. The next new leap after defense and technology
must take place in this field.

7\. The food issue should not be perceived as limited to trade and
economy alone. It should be considered as the defense of a nation, its
survival, as well as internal and external security.

Food requires the same alarm as our fight against terrorism

Food and agriculture require the same struggle we are putting up against
terrorism. It requires the same determination, the same state of alarm.

Just as we are fighting to keep the economy upright and protecting our
borders and seas, we must make the same extraordinary preparations in
agriculture and food.

[The world is being driven into]{.underline} **[extremely
critical]{.underline}** **[food]{.underline}** crises and conflicts, and
in fact **[[wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is not a trivial concern.
Countries will be divided, regions will be driven into chaos, and maps
will change.

Nuclear powers of the future

Countries that have their bases covered in the fields of agriculture and
food [[will **be**]{.mark}**come**]{.underline} the
**[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}** powers of the future.

#### Biodiversity [collapse]{.underline} causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--defense doesn't assume knock-off effects of climate change.

**Forthomme '21** \[Claude; January 13; M.A. in Economics from Columbia
University; Impakter, "The World Needs to Wake Up: At Risk the Survival
of Humanity,"
https://impakter.com/world-wake-at-risk-survival-of-humanity/\]

At a time when the world, battered by COVID-19, is watching with dismay
the rocky transition from Trump to President-Elect Biden, a group of 17
world scientists reminds us that maybe all our worries are futile. [What
is at **[risk]{.mark}** is something far more important: The very
**[survival of humanity]{.mark}**. The **prognosis** is **dire** and it
comes in a just-released major perspective paper]{.underline}:
"Underestimating the challenges of avoiding a ghastly future" published
in Frontiers in Conservation Science. 

On the basis of a comprehensive yet concise assessment of the state of
our civilization, these scientists -- experts from major institutions
including Stanford University, UCLA, and Flinders University -- are
telling us in no uncertain terms that the very survival of all species,
ours included, is threatened. 

And that the outlook is far more dire and dangerous than is generally
understood.

[The causes are well known: A **[loss of biodiversity]{.mark}** and
**accelerating climate** change in the coming decades]{.underline}
coupled with ignorance regarding the state of our environment and
political inaction across the planet. 

In the researchers' view, world leaders need a 'cold shower' to come to
their senses and plan and act in time to avoid a "ghastly future".
Professor Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University noted that no political or
economic system, or leadership, is prepared to handle the predicted
disasters, or even capable of such action:

"Stopping biodiversity loss is nowhere close to the top of any country's
priorities, trailing far behind other concerns such as employment,
healthcare, economic growth, or currency stability.

While it is positive news that President-elect Biden intends to reengage
the US in the Paris Climate accord within his first 100 days of office,
it is a minuscule gesture given the scale of the challenge.

[Humanity is running an **ecological Ponzi scheme** in which society
**[robs]{.mark}** nature and **[future
generations]{.mark}**]{.underline} to pay for short-term economic
enhancement today".

A year ago, Paul Ehrlich was adamant that our civilization is about to
collapse:

His conviction that we, as a species, are headed for disaster, hasn't
changed, on the contrary.

The lead author of the paper, Professor Corey Bradshaw of Flinders
University in Australia says he and his colleagues have summarised the
state of the natural world in "stark form" to help clarify the gravity
of the human predicament:

"[Humanity is causing a **rapid loss** of **biodiversity** and, with it,
Earth's ability to **support** complex **[life]{.mark}**. But the
mainstream is having difficulty grasping the **magnitude** of this loss,
despite the **steady [erosion]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the fabric of
**[human civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In fact, the scale of the threats to the biosphere and all its lifeforms
is so great that it is difficult to grasp for even well-informed
experts."

Difficult to grasp for them? Imagine how hard it is for us. This kind of
information however helps to bring home the magnitude of the threat. 

They found that major changes in the biosphere are directly linked to
the growth of human systems (summarized in Figure 1, reproduced below).
While the rapid loss of species and populations differs regionally in
intensity, and most species have not been adequately assessed for
extinction risk, certain global trends are obvious:

\<\<FIGURES OMITTED\>\>

The red color in the above diagram is a striking visual warning of the
extent of the damage to our biosphere. [No area has escaped, and the
greatest **[damage]{.mark} proportionately** has been
**[wrought]{.mark}** to **wetland** areas and free-flowing **rivers**,
both worse off than the **[oceans]{.mark}** that are certainly not doing
well]{.underline}.

Overall, perhaps 1 million species are threatened with extinction in the
near future out of an estimated total of 7--10 million eukaryotic
species on the planet, with around 40% of plants alone considered
endangered. Today, the global biomass of wild mammals is less than a
quarter of that estimated for the Late Pleistocene, while insects are
also disappearing rapidly in many regions.

[**Freshwater** and **marine** [environments]{.mark} have also been
severely damaged]{.underline}. More than two-thirds of the oceans have
been compromised to some extent by human activities, live coral cover on
reefs has halved in less than 200 years, kelp forests have declined by
some 40%, and the biomass of large predatory fishes is now less than a
third of what it was only 100 years ago.

As a result of these disastrous losses in biodiversity, [we are now
getting inter alia [**reduced** carbon
**sequestration**]{.mark}, reduced **[pollination]{.mark}**, **[soil
degradation]{.mark}**, [**poorer** water]{.mark} and air
**[quality]{.mark}**, more frequent and **intense
[flooding]{.mark}** and worse **[fires]{.mark}**]{.underline}. All this
of course directly [**[compromises human]{.mark}** health]{.underline}.

Yes, the COVID-19 pandemic did not appear out of nowhere. It came
directly from the impact of humans on the Earth's ecosystem.

It should come as no surprise that we are on the path of a sixth major
extinction, a fact that is now scientifically undeniable. How is
humanity behaving under the circumstances?

Projected population growth tells us what is the future we should
expect. We already know that the impact of population growth, combined
with an imperfect distribution of resources, leads to massive food
insecurity. By some estimates, 700--800 million people are starving and
1--2 billion are micronutrient-malnourished and unable to function
fully, with prospects of many more food problems in the near future.
Large populations and their continued growth are also [drivers of soil
degradation and biodiversity loss]{.underline}.

Populations growth also [[increases]{.mark} the [**chances** of
**pandemics**]{.mark} that fuel ever-more desperate hunts for **scarce
resources**]{.underline}. Population growth is also a factor in many
social ills, from crowding and joblessness to deteriorating
infrastructure and bad governance. There is mounting evidence that when
populations are large and growing fast, they can be the
[**[sparks]{.mark}** for both internal and **[international
conflicts]{.mark}** that lead to **war**]{.underline}. We all know that
this "[massive **[ecological overshoot]{.mark}** is largely enabled by
the **increasing** use of **fossil fuels**]{.underline}."

Vulnerabilities in Arctic Security

[Addressing several **vulnerabilities**]{.underline} in particular
[would effectively bolster Arctic security]{.underline}. While most
European **[[NATO members]{.underline}]{.mark}** already
[[agree]{.underline}]{.mark} with and have begun to answer the need for
a general increase in defense expenditure---particularly in naval power
for Arctic states---since February 2022, [[there remain points
of]{.mark} [weakness]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Arctic]{.mark} geography [is **vast** and **remote**]{.mark}, [making
it hard to]{.mark}]{.underline} establish and [[maintain]{.mark}
a]{.underline} [comprehensive [**surveillance** and
**communications**]{.mark} **network**]{.underline}. A [cold and rugged
climate]{.underline} [subject to rapid environmental
changes]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} in [ice conditions, make
the Arctic a challenging operating environment and constrains
options]{.underline} for building [**robust
infrastructure**.18]{.underline}

In the [absence of]{.underline} a [redundant communications network,
long-range communications in the Arctic primarily rely on **[undersea
cables]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a dependency that is [[a
vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}.^19^ [Undersea cables offer little
resistance to sabotage, acting as low-hanging fruit for an
[adversary]{.mark} to [exploit though **physical damage**,
**cyberattacks**, or **espionage**]{.mark}]{.underline}.^20^ For zones
like **[Svalbard]{.underline}**, which [is dependent on two fiber-optic
cables for outside communications]{.underline}, [the situation is
precarious. A loss of both cables would carry strategic implications, as
transmissions to and from the **K-SAT satellite
station**]{.underline}---[the world's largest satellite ground station
and of strategic importance to satellites in polar
orbit]{.underline}---[would effectively be **lost**]{.underline}.^21^

[[Svalbard's]{.mark} fiber-optic cable dependence was tested
in]{.underline} January [2022 when one of the [cables]{.mark} was
[cut,]{.mark}]{.underline} rendering the archipelago entirely reliant on
reserve capacity from its one remaining cable. Although the cause of the
incident remains unconfirmed, **[[Russian
trawlers]{.underline}]{.mark}** [were [spotted]{.mark} by the
cable]{.underline} shortly beforehand.^22^ Similarly, [in]{.underline}
April [2021]{.underline}, a 4.3-kilometer section of [an undersea cable
outside the Norwegian coast disappeared]{.underline}, with no
information on how or on the actors involved.^23^ In addition, while
outside of Arctic territory, [the 2022 Nord Stream Pipeline sabotage in
the Baltic Sea strongly resembled]{.underline} the
[Svalbard]{.underline} incident.^24^ With [all of these
[incidents]{.mark}]{.underline} left unattributed, albeit doubtlessly
caused by human interference, they [[reflect]{.mark} both the
**[vulnerability of]{.mark} critical [subsea infrastructure]{.mark}**
[as well as]{.mark} the [need for maritime **situational
awareness**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}.

The [same [vulnerabilities]{.mark} can be [applied to Arctic **petroleum
infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As [**[Norway]{.mark}** has
[become the largest]{.mark} petroleum [supplier in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}---in tandem [[with]{.mark} European [states
**reducing**]{.mark} **their [reliance]{.mark}** [on Russian
energy]{.mark}]{.underline}---[the Nordic country's [**strategic
importance** as]{.mark} an [exporter has]{.mark} greatly
[increased]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [security dimension of energy
production has become more visible]{.underline}. This also makes
[Norwegian [**energy infrastructure** in Arctic]{.mark} waters
[an]{.mark} increasingly [attractive **target for Russian
sabotage**]{.mark}]{.underline}.^25^ Furthermore, [Norway]{.underline}
has [recently permitted exploration of mineral extraction further
in]{.underline}to the [Arctic]{.underline}, which may [lead to
additional **geopolitical importance**]{.underline} for the Norwegian
continental shelf.^26^ [Additional maritime infrastructure incentivizes
[increased awareness]{.mark} to [safeguard these assets]{.mark}
against]{.underline} potential **[threats]{.underline}**.

While space-based communication is the most capable alternative to
undersea cables, the [Arctic is hampered by]{.underline} significant
[[**shortcomings** in satellite capabilities]{.mark}. Conventional
SATCOM from geosynchronous orbit is unstable or unusable in large parts
of the Arctic due to limited coverage above 70 degrees
latitude]{.underline}.^27^ As a result, satellite coverage in the Arctic
largely relies on satellites in polar or highly elliptical orbits.
Currently, [Arctic SATCOM mainly encompasses narrowband frequencies with
constrained data rates and high latency, thereby limiting
functionality]{.underline}. The United States possesses military
satellites with encrypted communications, such as the Enhanced Polar
System, but the [existing pool of Arctic satellite capabilities is
insufficient for current operational requirements]{.underline}.^28^ The
accuracy of precision, navigation, and timing (PNT) systems, such as
GPS, is also limited in the Arctic, causing potential challenges for
precision-based munitions and navigational awareness.^29^ [Even with
fully functional PNT systems, Arctic states can still expect [Russian
**GPS-jamming**]{.mark} as [an asymmetric tool]{.mark} to impact states'
abilities to utilize **advanced munitions** and
**vehicles**]{.underline}.^30^

STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 26 (Reuters) - [Security services from
[seven]{.mark} European [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} on Monday
[[briefed **Norwegian** ]{.mark}**energy** executives and
[officials]{.mark}]{.underline}, including from Equinor (EQNR.OL), opens
new tab, [Europe\'s **largest gas supplier**, [about]{.mark} what they
see as [Russian threats to **critical
infrastructure.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [closed-door meeting attended by]{.underline} national security
services from [Norway, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland,
Sweden and Iceland highlighted [Norway]{.mark}\'s role as [the **key
energy supplier** to Europe.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"We see a developing story which addresses not only Germany or
Norwegian colleagues but all of us,\" Sinan Selen, the vice president of
Germany\'s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, told
Reuters after the meeting.

[\"This is a [threat]{.mark} which comes [from]{.mark}]{.underline} some
counterparts like [[Russia]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} not only
**[espionage]{.mark} [operations]{.mark}** [but also]{.mark} the **[risk
of sabotage]{.mark}**]{.underline} in some fields,\" he added, declining
to discuss specific cases.

In April, two German-Russian nationals were arrested in Germany on
suspicion of plotting sabotage attacks, including on U.S. military
facilities, in what officials called a serious effort to undermine
military support for Ukraine.

The Russian Embassy in Germany has dismissed allegations that it was
behind the plans as \"absurd and ridiculous\".

The [Norwegian intelligence agencies have]{.underline} also [highlighted
what they term as the potential threat of **Russian
sabotage.**]{.underline}

\"[When we are talking about sabotage today, we are talking about
Russia]{.underline},\" Beate [Gangaas, the head of Norway\'s
counterintelligence agency]{.underline} PST, which organised the meeting
on the sidelines of the ONS energy conference, [told]{.underline}
Reuters.

[Norwegian intelligence agencies said]{.underline} earlier this year
that [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[may]{.underline} find it prudent\"
to [[carry out **physical** or **digital**]{.mark} **acts of
[sabotage]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} targets in [Norway]{.mark},
[with]{.mark} its **[petroleum]{.mark} sector** being [the **prime

[[After]{.mark} Moscow\'s]{.underline} full-scale [invasion of
[Ukraine]{.mark}, [Norway, a **NATO**]{.mark} **[member]{.mark}
country** [that **shares a border with Russia** in the Arctic]{.mark},
[has become Europe\'s largest supplier of natural gas, which is
delivered via a]{.mark} vast **[subsea pipeline]{.mark}**
system]{.underline}.

\"[Russia is in a lasting confrontation with the West, and it\'s a
regime that is willing to take **more risk**,]{.underline}\" Vice
Admiral Nils Andreas Stensoenes, the head of Norwegian Intelligence
Service, told an open-door meeting earlier on Monday.

\"So, even though we haven\'t seen any concrete evidence on plans to do
anything in Norway, [[it\'s wise to]{.mark} be **prudent** and
**[increase the level of security]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" he added.

For decades, [[Norway]{.mark} has been]{.underline} Britain's
**[[leading source of imported energy]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[However, that]{.underline} relationship [may]{.underline} be set to
[[come **under strain** after]{.underline}]{.mark} the Scandinavian
nation warned that its [vast [oil and gas fields]{.mark} are in
**[decline]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [threat of **[dwindling production]{.mark}**]{.underline} would
[[herald a]{.mark} potential **[energy crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
the UK, [which]{.underline} last year [relied on Norway for half its gas
and a quarter of its oil.]{.underline}

[Worse]{.underline} still, [a drop in Norwegian output would
[**strengthen Russia's grip** on the **global**]{.mark} **gas
[market]{.mark}**, [posing a **geopolitical nightmare** for]{.mark}
governments across [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[According to a new report from the Norwegian Offshore Directorate
(NOD), the country's oil and gas supplies **peaked last year** and are
expected to dwindle from now on.]{.underline}

Its findings revealed Norway produced about 230m standard cubic metres
of oil and gas in 2024, although that could fall to as low as 110m cubic
metres by 2035.

Experts claim extra investment could help slow the decline, although
there is no escaping from the fact that Norway's best oil and gas fields
are becoming increasingly depleted.

"[We expect overall production to **decline**]{.underline} in the later
2020s," the report from the Norwegian Offshore Directorate said.

["In order [to slow]{.mark} this [decline, **exploration**]{.mark} will
[need to take place]{.mark} close to **infrastructure** [and]{.mark} in
more frontier areas, in addition to making more **[investments
in]{.mark} fields**, **discoveries** and
**[infrastructure]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"[Failure]{.underline} to invest [will lead to **rapid dismantling** of
petroleum activities."]{.underline}

While an obvious concern for Norwegian households, the latest warning
from the NOD will also send a chill through Ed Miliband's Energy
Department.

Last year, Norway became Britain's primary source of gas after supplying
29bn cubic metres, whereas the UK's North Sea output shrank to 26bn
cubic metres.

Over the next decade, UK production is expected to decline by a further
70pc, meaning reliance on costly imported gas will increase in the
coming years.

Norway has long been expected to be the primary source of that gas.

However, the UK and the rest of [[Europe]{.mark} now [face the prospect
of being **forced into the arms** of]{.mark} countries like
**[Russia]{.mark}** if Norway starts to turn off the taps]{.underline}.

["**[Dusk for Norway is dawn for Russia]{.mark}**," says]{.underline}
Andreas [Schroeder, head of energy analytics at the Independent
Commodity Intelligence Service]{.underline} (ICIS).

"[Russia]{.underline} is unlikely to [[**dominate** Europe]{.mark}
again]{.underline} as in the past when it had nearly 40pc market share.

"But [the call to open]{.underline} the [pipes and gates for cheap
Russian gas will get louder over time [as **gas prices increase** with
dwindling Norwegian output]{.mark}.]{.underline}

["It [creates a case for]{.mark} more [**cooperation with Russia**
and]{.mark} will [encourage **Russia-friendly politicians** in]{.mark}
[countries]{.mark} like **Slovakia** and **Hungary**."]{.underline}

#### That funds a [victory]{.underline} in Ukraine. Energy independence [now]{.underline} is key.

Heel"
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/russias-economically-vital-energy-sector-is-vladimir-putins-achilles-heel/\]

The full-scale [Russian [invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} is now
[[approaching the three-year mark]{.mark}, with [**no end** in
**sight**]{.mark}]{.underline} to a war that is widely recognized as the
largest European conflict since World War II. So far, the [[Western
response]{.mark} to]{.underline} the [invasion]{.underline} has focused
on providing military aid to Ukraine while imposing economic costs on
Russia. This approach has **[[clearly failed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[to]{.underline} produce the desired effect of [ending the
war]{.underline}, and requires significant strengthening if it is to
prove effective.

[[Russia's ability to sustain **military operations**]{.underline}
[depends]{.underline}]{.mark} **[largely]{.underline}** [[on
**revenues** generated by]{.mark} the country's [energy
exports]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, due to Russia's significant share
of global oil and gas markets, [[West]{.mark}ern leaders]{.underline}
have been [**[reluctant]{.underline}** [to impose]{.underline}]{.mark}
[comprehensive [bans]{.mark}]{.underline} on Russian energy exports
[[amid concerns]{.underline}]{.mark} that [this could lead
to]{.underline} **[[price spikes]{.underline}]{.mark}** and global
economic instability.

As a compromise, the West has allowed Russia to continue oil and gas
sales while attempting to cap the amount of income the Kremlin can
receive. While this approach is well intentioned, it has proved
difficult to implement in practice and has produced limited results. In
order to undermine Putin's war machine, the West needs to impose
additional restrictions while also exploring ways to improve
implementation.

The importance of **[[energy exports]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the
Russian economy is well documented. In 2023, for example, oil and gas
revenues [accounted for more than **[one-third]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of Russia's **federal budget**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As the third
anniversary of the full-scale invasion draws near, there are now
**[[mounting indications]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that [Russia's
**economy** is **under strain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To curb rampant
inflation, Russia's Central Bank recently raised interest rates to 21
percent. The growing costs of the war and the damage done by sanctions
measures are adding to these pressures. [[If energy exports]{.mark} were
[further curtailed, Russia's war]{.mark} effort could be **[severely
impacted]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [with Vladimir [Putin forced to choose
between]{.mark}]{.underline} sustaining the [[**invasion**
or]{.underline}]{.mark} avoiding **[[economic
collapse.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Despite these reflections, in February 2022 I was shocked [when Vladimir

[repercussions for Russia]{.underline} itself, [and for the whole of

\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS PAUSE\]

This is a tragedy, especially as the past few decades have shown that
war isn't an inevitable force of nature. It is a human choice that
varies from place to place and time to time. Since 1945, we have not
seen a single case of war between great powers, nor a single case of an
internationally recognized state noannihilated through foreign conquest.
More limited regional and local conflicts remained relatively common; I
live in Israel, so I know this perfectly well. But the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank notwithstanding, countries have rarely tried
to unilaterally expand their borders through violence. That's one reason
the Israeli occupation has drawn so much attention and criticism. What
was the norm for thousands of years of imperial history has become
anathema. Even when taking civil wars, insurgencies, and terrorism into
account, in recent decades wars have killed far fewer people than
suicide, road accidents, or obesity-related diseases. In 2019, about
70,000 people were killed in armed conflicts or police shootings, about
700,000 people committed suicide, 1.3 million people died in road
accidents, and 1.5 million people died from diabetes. Yet peace has not
been just a matter of numbers. Perhaps the most important change in
recent decades has been psychological. For thousands of years, peace
meant "the temporary absence of war." For example, in between the three
Punic Wars fought by Rome and Carthage were decades of peace, but every
Roman and Carthaginian knew that this "Punic Peace" could be shattered
at any moment. Politics, economics, and culture were all shaped by
constant expectations of war. During the late 20th century and early
21st century, the meaning of the word peace changed. Whereas the Old
Peace meant only "the temporary absence of war," the New Peace came to
mean "the implausibility of war." In many (though not all) regions of
the world, countries stopped fearing that their neighbors might invade
and annihilate them. Tunisians stopped dreading an Italian invasion,
Costa Ricans didn't think that the Nicaraguan army might make a dash to
San José, and Samoans didn't fear that a Fijian war fleet might suddenly
emerge from beyond the horizon. How can we tell that countries weren't
concerned about these things? By looking at their state budgets. Until
recently, the military was the expected No. 1 item on the budget of
every empire, sultanate, kingdom, and republic. Governments spent little
on health care and education, because most of their resources went to
paying soldiers, constructing walls, and building warships. The Roman
Empire spent about 50 to 75 percent of its budget on the military; the
figure was about 80 percent in the Sung Empire (960--1279); and about 60
percent in the late-17th-century Ottoman Empire. From 1685 to 1813, the
share of the military in British government expenditure never fell below
55 percent and averaged 75 percent. During the great conflicts of the
20th century, democracies and totalitarian regimes alike plunged into
debt to finance their machine guns, tanks, and submarines. When we fear
that the neighbors might at any moment invade, loot our cities, enslave
our people, and annex our land, that's the reasonable thing to do. State
budgets in the era of the New Peace make for far more hopeful reading
material than any pacifist tract ever composed. In the early 21st
century, the average government expenditure on the military has been
only 6.5 percent, and even the United States, the dominant superpower,
has spent only about 11 percent to maintain its supremacy. Because
people no longer lived in terror of external invasion, governments could
invest far more money in health care, welfare, and education than in the
military. Average expenditure on health care, for example, has been 10.5
percent of the government budget, or about 1.6 times the defense budget.
For many people today, the fact that the health-care budget is bigger
than the military budget is unremarkable. But if we take the New Peace
for granted and therefore neglect it, we will soon lose it. The New
Peace was the outcome of three main forces. First, technological
changes, and above all the development of nuclear weapons, greatly
increased the price of war, especially between superpowers. The atomic
bomb turned superpower war into a mad act of collective suicide, which
is why superpowers have not gone to war directly against one another
since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Secondly, economic changes greatly
decreased the profits of war. Key economic assets were once material
resources that could be conquered by force. When Rome defeated Carthage
in the Punic Wars, it became rich by looting its defeated rival, selling
its people into slavery, and taking over the silver mines of Spain and
the wheat fields of North Africa. In recent decades, however,
scientific, technical, and organizational kwledge have become the most
important economic assets in many places. Silicon Valley has no silicon
mines. Trillion-dollar businesses such as Microsoft and Google are built
on what's in the minds of engineers and entrepreneurs rather than what's
in the ground under their feet. And whereas seizing silver mines by
force is easy, you cannot acquire knowledge that way. This economic
reality led to a sharp decline in the profitability of conquest.
Although wars over material resources continue to characterize certain
parts of the world---such as the Middle East---the big economies of the
post-1945 period grew without imperial conquest. Germany, Japan, and
Italy saw their armies broken and their territories shrink---but after
the war, their economies boomed. The Chinese economic miracle was
achieved without engaging in any major war since 1979. As I was writing
these lines in early November, Russian soldiers were looting the
Ukrainian city of Kherson, sending back to Russia trucks full of carpets
and toasters that they'd stolen from Ukrainian homes. This will not make
Russia rich, and it will not compensate the Russians for the enormous
cost of the war. But as Putin's invasion of Ukraine proves,
technological and economic changes by themselves were not enough to
produce the New Peace. Some leaders are so power-hungry and so
irresponsible that they might begin a war even if it is economically
ruinous to their country and pushes the whole of humanity toward nuclear
Armageddon. Accordingly, the third essential pillar of the New Peace has
been cultural and institutional.

\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\]

[Human societies were long dominated by militaristic
cultures]{.underline} that viewed war as inevitable, and even desirable.
Aristocrats in both Rome and Carthage believed that military glory was
life's crowning achievement and the ideal route to power and riches.
Artists such as Virgil and Horace concurred, devoting their talents to
singing of arms and warriors, glorifying bloody battles, and
immortalizing brutal conquerors. [During **the New Peace**
era]{.underline}, artists turned their talents to exposing the horrors
of war, while politicians sought to leave their mark by initiating
health-care reforms rather than by looting foreign cities.
[[Leaders]{.mark} throughout the world---[influenced
by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**fear of [nuclear war]{.mark}**, by the
changes in the]{.underline} nature of the [economy, and by]{.underline}
new [cultural trends---[joined]{.mark} forces [to build a]{.mark}
**functioning [global order]{.mark}** that allowed countries to
develop]{.underline} peacefully [while restraining]{.underline} the
occasional **[warmongers]{.underline}**.

[This global order has been based on liberal ideals,]{.underline}
namely, [that all humans deserve the same basic liberties; that
no]{.underline} human [group is inherently superior]{.underline} to all
others; and that all humans share core experiences, values, and
interests. [These ideals encouraged leaders to **avoid war**
and]{.underline} instead **[work together]{.underline}** to protect our
common values and to advance our common interests. [The [liberal]{.mark}
global [order linked]{.mark} the [belief]{.mark} in universal values
[to]{.mark} the **[peaceful functioning]{.mark}** of global
institutions.]{.underline}

[Although this global order was far from perfect, it improved the lives
of people not just in the old imperial centers]{.underline} such as
Britain and the United States, [but also in many other parts of the
world]{.underline}, from India to Brazil and from Poland to China.
[[Countries]{.underline}]{.mark} in all continents [[**benefited**
from]{.mark} the rise in global [trade]{.mark} and
investments,]{.underline} and almost all countries enjoyed a peace
dividend. Not only could Denmark and Canada shift resources from tanks
to teachers---Nigeria and Indonesia did the same.

\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS PAUSE\]

Anyone who rants about the defects of the liberal global order should
first answer one simple question: Can you please name the decade in
which humankind was in better shape than in the 2010s? Which decade is
your lost golden age? Is it the 1910s, with the First World War, the
Bolshevik Revolution, Jim Crow, and European empires brutally exploiting
much of Africa and Asia? Is it perhaps the 1810s, with the Napoleonic
Wars reaching their bloody climax, Russian and Chinese peasants crushed
by their aristocratic overlords, the East India Company securing its
control of India, and slavery still legal in the United States, Brazil,
and most other parts of the world? Perhaps you are dreaming of the
1710s, with the War of the Spanish Succession, the Great Northern War,
the Mughal succession wars, and a third of children everywhere dying
from malnutrition and disease before reaching adulthood? The New Peace
didn't result from some divine miracle. It was achieved by humans making
better choices and building a functioning global order. Unfortunately,
too many people took this achievement for granted. Perhaps they assumed
that the New Peace was guaranteed mainly by technological and economic
forces, and that it could survive even without its third pillar---the
liberal global order. Consequently, that order was first neglected and
then attacked with growing ferocity. The attack started with rogue
states such as Iran and rogue leaders such as Putin, but by themselves,
they were not strong enough to end the New Peace. What really undermined
the global order was that both the countries that benefited most from it
(including China, India, Brazil, and Poland) and the countries that
built it in the first place (notably the U.K. and the United States)
turned their backs on it. The Brexit vote and the election of Donald
Trump in 2016 symbolized this turn. Those who have challenged the global
liberal order mostly didn't wish for war. They just wanted to advance
what they understood as the interests of their country, and they argued
that each nation-state should defend and develop its own sacred identity
and traditions. What they never explained was how all of these different
nations would deal with one another in the absence of universal values
and global institutions. The opponents of the global order did not offer
any clear alternative. They seemed to think that somehow, the various
nations would just get along fine, and the world would become a network
of walled-but-friendly fortresses. Fortresses are seldom friendly,
however. Each national fortress usually wants a bit more land, security,
and prosperity for itself at the expense of its neighbors, and without
the help of universal values and global institutions, rival fortresses
cannot agree on any common rules. The network-of-fortresses model was a
recipe for disaster.

\[PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\]

And disaster was not long in coming. The pandemic demonstrated that in
the absence of effective global cooperation, humanity cannot protect
itself against common threats such as viruses. Then, perhaps because he
observed how COVID further eroded global solidarity, [Putin concluded
that he]{.underline} [could mete out the coup]{.underline} de grâce [by
breaking **the biggest taboo**]{.underline} of the New Peace era. [Putin
thought that if he **conquered Ukraine**]{.underline} and absorbed it
into Russia[, some countries would gasp in disbelief]{.underline} and
condemn him---[but nobody would take any effective action]{.underline}
against him.

The argument that Putin was pushed unwillingly to invade Ukraine to
preempt a Western attack is nonsensical propaganda. Some vague Western
threat is not a legitimate excuse for destroying a country, looting its
cities, raping and torturing its citizens, and inflicting untold
suffering on tens of millions of men, women, and children. Anyone who
believes that Putin had no choice should name the country that was
preparing to invade Russia in 2022. Do you think the German army was
massing to cross the border? Do you imagine that Napoleon got out of his
grave to lead the Grande Armée yet again to Moscow, and Putin had no
choice but to preempt the imminent French onslaught? And remember that
Putin actually first invaded Ukraine back in 2014---not in 2022.

[[Putin]{.mark} **prepared his invasion** for a long time. He [never
accepted]{.mark} the breakup of the Russian Empire,]{.underline} and [he
never saw Ukraine, Georgia, or any of the other post-Soviet [republics
as **legitimate**]{.mark}]{.underline} independent nations. Whereas---as
noted earlier---[average military expenses have been about 6.5 percent
of government budgets]{.underline} around the world [and 11 percent in
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [in Russia they have been
**far higher.**]{.underline} We don't know exactly how much higher,
because it is a state secret. But [estimates put the figure]{.underline}
somewhere [in the vicinity of]{.underline} 20 percent, and it may even
be **[more than 30 percent.]{.underline}**

[[If Putin]{.mark}'s gamble [succeeds, the result will be the]{.mark}
**final [collapse]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the global order]{.underline}
and of the New [[Peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Autocrats]{.underline}]{.mark} around the world [will learn that wars
of conquest are]{.underline} again [possible, and
democracies]{.underline}, too, [[will]{.mark} be forced to
**[militarize]{.mark}**]{.underline} themselves for protection. [We've
already seen Russian aggression prompt countries]{.underline} such as
Germany [to sharply increase]{.underline} their [defense
budget]{.underline} overnight, and countries such as Sweden to reinstate
conscription. The money that should go to teachers, nurses, and social
workers will instead go to tanks, missiles, and cyberweapons. At 18,
young people all over the world will do their mandatory military
service. [The whole world will look like Russia---]{.underline}a country
with an oversize army and understaffed hospitals. [[A new era of **war,
poverty, and disease** will result.]{.underline}]{.mark} Alternatively,
[[if Putin is]{.mark} [stopped]{.mark} and punished, [the]{.mark} global
[order]{.mark} **won't be broken**]{.underline} by what he did[---it

But before we even get to that very worst of the worst-case scenarios of
a direct collision between a NATO ally and Russia, [even the
**[slight]{.mark}est [escalation]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
region, considering its vital [**[energy]{.mark} resources**, could have

[As market economies evolve and integrate]{.underline} by engaging
commerce and leveraging technology, [the [blend between]{.mark} national
[security and]{.mark} socio-[economic]{.mark} imperatives
[becomes]{.mark} **even more [prescient]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
carries with it both advantages and disadvantages. Traditionally, NATO
military forces have relied on critical civilian infrastructure such as
communications, food and water, industrial capacity, civil transport and
energy supplies to conduct operations. The additional rise of
non-kinetic asymmetric threats -- cyberwarfare, information warfare, EMP
attack -- against non-traditional targets, such as banks or major
multinational corporations that comprise key components of this critical
infrastructure, adds an entirely new dimension to the defense
requirements of the 21st century. In addition to dealing with more
conventional kinetic threats from traditional and emerging adversaries,
[NATO must prepare itself]{.mark} for this new era of invisible warfare
through deeper strategic cooperation with the private sector and
corporate entities.

[Great Powers and non-state [actors]{.mark} alike can now
[conduct]{.mark} non-kinetic [attacks]{.mark} **just as devastating** as

#### Scenario \[X\]\-\--[GREY ZONES]{.underline}. 

#### Russia is increasing [grey zone attacks]{.underline} on critical infrastructure. 

Anna **Ribeiro '25**\-\--News Editor at Industrial Cyber. (\"Russian
hybrid threats likely to escalate around 2025 NATO Summit, putting
European critical infrastructure at high risk\", *Industrial Cyber*,
https://industrialcyber.co/reports/russian-hybrid-threats-likely-to-escalate-around-2025-nato-summit-putting-european-critical-infrastructure-at-high-risk/,
6-23-2025). Accessed 7-23-2025 by NT-RM.

Recorded Future warns that [[Russian **hybrid threats**]{.mark},
[including **sabotage of critical infrastructure**,]{.mark} vandalism,
weaponized migration, and military intimidation, are highly [likely to
**intensify**]{.mark}]{.underline} around the 2025 NATO Summit. These
[[activities]{.underline}]{.mark} are [expected to]{.underline}
particularly **[[target European countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
especially if the summit produces decisive outcomes on Ukraine. The
[Baltic states, Poland, and Germany face]{.underline} the highest
[risk]{.underline}.

In its research report titled 'Threats to the 2025 NATO Summit,'
Recorded Future observed that the [complex [geopolitical
environment]{.mark}]{.underline} surrounding the summit also
[[make]{.underline}]{.mark}s [[it]{.mark} an [attractive target
for]{.mark}]{.underline} various [threat actors]{.underline}, [including
state-backed influence operations, **[cybercriminals]{.mark}**,
**hacktivists**, and advanced **cyber threat groups**]{.underline}.
[Researchers assessed that [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} is highly likely
to [[continue]{.mark} targeting European critical infrastructure through
**[hybrid cyber-kinetic operations]{.mark}**,]{.underline} irrespective
of ongoing Ukraine peace negotiations. [Submarine [**cable
infrastructure** was]{.mark}]{.underline} also [flagged as a **[key
vulnerability.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"While these operations are unlikely to directly target the summit event
itself, [[threats to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [critical infrastructure
of **[NATO member countries]{.mark}** are]{.underline} likely
[heightened as Moscow seeks to **destabilize member states** and
**exploit divisions** within the alliance]{.underline}," Recorded Future
identified in a post last week. "[Hybrid threats will]{.underline}
almost certainly [increase their targeting of NATO member]{.underline}
countrie[s]{.underline} [following the summit]{.underline} if it results
in significant action regarding Ukraine, such as a joint commitment to
further military aid to Kyiv."

In January, the Finnish Defence Forces assessed that
[Russia]{.underline} '[will]{.underline} likely [increase the use of all
hybrid methods]{.underline} as it seeks to cause disunity within NATO
and the European Union,' [[including **cyber**]{.mark} and
**info**rmation influencing, **[coercive]{.mark} use of [energy
exports]{.mark}**, targeting of **energy** and other **critical
infrastructure**, weaponizing **immigration**, and **intelligence
operations.**]{.underline}

Based on recent incidents, the 2025 NATO Summit report revealed that
countries neighboring Russia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and
Poland, likely represent the most attractive targets for sabotage
operations. Additionally, countries providing the strongest support to
Ukraine, such as Germany and Poland, are almost certainly at greater
risk of physical threats than countries that do not provide significant
aid, such as Hungary, which Moscow is unlikely to directly target.

The [[research identified]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Russian]{.mark}-directed sabotage [attacks targeting]{.mark} the
[c]{.mark}ritical [i]{.mark}nfrastructure [and]{.mark} key [government
and military facilities]{.mark} of European countries have]{.underline}
almost [certainly **[increased]{.mark}** since 2022]{.underline}. Recent
incidents suggest that these operations largely involve
low-sophistication tactics with a degree of plausible deniability and
obfuscated links to Moscow, often initially appearing as accidents or
single criminal events, complicating attribution and identification of a
larger strategic trend.

[Sabotage operations **targeting submarine cables** off the coast of
Europe]{.underline} almost [certainly represent a]{.underline}
relatively [low-effort, high-reward vector for targeting European
**critical infrastructure.**]{.underline}

In June 2023, Insikt Group assessed that [Russia's ongoing war against
**[Ukraine]{.mark}** was]{.underline} very likely [[fueling **physical
attacks** and **intelligence collection**]{.mark} efforts against the
submarine cable system [to undermine]{.mark} the [**economic**,
**diplomatic**, and **national security objectives** of]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark} and its NATO allies]{.underline}. Specifically,
[Russia]{.underline} almost certainly [presents the
greatest]{.underline} direct [threat]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
submarine [cables in]{.underline} the [North and Baltic
Seas]{.underline}.

"While none of these incidents caused prolonged outages or communication
disruptions due to the availability of alternate routes for data
transmission, increased societal concerns about the vulnerability of
critical infrastructure had a clear psychological impact on northern
European populations," the 2025 NATO Summit report added. "A [[more
coordinated attack]{.mark} on]{.underline} submarine [critical
infrastructure could cause **disruptions to business operations**,
**financial losses**, and **communications disruptions**,
[rais]{.mark}ing the [risk of **economic
ramifications**]{.mark}]{.underline} to northern and eastern Europe."

In conclusion, Recorded Future wrote that the June 2025 NATO Summit in
The Hague is a high-value target for [adversaries like [**Russia** and
**China**]{.mark}]{.underline}, who [are expected to
escalate]{.underline} [influence operations]{.underline} to exploit
internal alliance divisions and weaken NATO's credibility. These efforts
may involve AI-generated deepfakes, fake leaks, and voice cloning to sow
doubt about unity on Ukraine, Arctic policy, and burden-sharing.

[Both nations]{.underline} are also likely to [[conduct **cyber
espionage**]{.mark} to gather sensitive information]{.underline} about
summit discussions and outcomes, [using **phishing lures** and **spoofed
domains**. Russia]{.underline} may [**[weaponize]{.mark}** any obtained
**[data]{.mark}** or fabricate it [to disrupt NATO coordination]{.mark}
and discredit member states.]{.underline}

[In parallel, [**hacktivists** and **cybercriminals**]{.mark} are
[expected to launch]{.mark} **coordinated attacks**, including
distributed denial-of-service (**[DDoS]{.mark}**), extortion, and
defacement campaigns aimed at embarrassing host-nation
authorities]{.underline} during the summit's peak visibility. Even in
the absence of a successful attack, [a well-timed false claim could fuel
a [**perception hack** and **shift the narrative**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### [Probing]{.underline} in the Arctic causes [nuclear escalation]{.underline}\-\--resiliency is key.

Russian Federation

[[Russia\'s **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [arsenal]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
strike capability [[remains]{.mark} an]{.underline} enduring,
**[[existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the United States,
democracy, and our peaceful Allies and Partners. [A [central concern
is]{.mark} Russia\'s non-strategic **nuclear [weapons

to use]{.mark} these [weapons in **crisis**]{.mark} **or

[Russia pursues **[malign activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including
**[military aggression]{.underline}**, [aimed at **undermining
democracy**]{.underline}, the [rules-based **international
order**]{.underline}, [and has]{.underline} a [willingness to use force

and threaten peace]{.underline} and stability in Europe.

Russia employs [[grey area]{.mark} activities]{.underline} to

**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfluence, [and [attempts to coerce]{.mark}
**neighboring [sovereign nations]{.mark}**]{.underline} and form
fractures between Allies at NATO. Russia meddles in European politics,
abrogates its responsibilities under the Treaty on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe, engaged in an unprovoked and unjustified armed attack
against Ukraine, and retains a military presence on sovereign soil in
Moldova and Georgia against the will of those nations. Russia maintains
a large conventional force presence along NATO\'s borders and conducts
snap exercises to increase instability. Russia employs unconventional
tools, ranging from disinformation campaigns, malicious cyber
activities, and the manipulation of energy markets to support Moscow\'s
efforts at political subversion and economic intimidation. These tools
and others are intended [to coerce]{.underline}, weaken, [and divide our
Allies and Partners in the European **theater and beyond**]{.underline}.
[Russian leadership habitually misinterprets warnings]{.underline} and
has [directly **instigated armed conflict** with Ukraine]{.underline},
while [continuing to expand the space below the level of **armed
conflict**]{.underline} in other Allied and Partner nations.

Beyond Ukraine, [[Russia continues]{.mark} its military [modernization
while displaying]{.mark} its **[destabilizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}
capabilities during [operations in Syria]{.underline}, [and
Libya]{.underline}. As a result, the [Russian government has growing

People\'s Republic of China (PRC) The PRC seeks to increase its access,
presence, and influence in Europe and globally to achieve its objective
of being socially-stable, economically prosperous, and militarily
powerful by 2050. The PRC engages in aggressive and subversive economic
and diplomatic activities in the USEUCOM AOR not only to find markets to
strengthen the Chinese economy, but also to establish presence at key
transportation nodes and increase its political influence. China\'s
foreign direct investment, government-backed business ventures, and
infrastructure deals not only secure the PRC\'s advantage in global
trade, market access, and technological standards, but also provides
Beijing an avenue to assert influence at the expense of enduring U.S.,
Allied, and Partner interests. The PRC primarily pursues bilateral
deals, as well as engagements, through PRC-led forums such as the 16+1
Cooperation Framework (Lithuania withdrew in 2021) with Central and
Eastern European nations. European nations are growing increasingly
skeptical of these engagements and have identified the formats as
divisive. The PRC focuses on seizing the \"high ground\" in critical and
emerging technology sectors with military application, including
Artificial Intelligence, advanced robotics, quantum technologies, and
hypersonic systems, and at the same time it seeks to export its national
technology standards globally. The PRC\'s efforts to expand 5G networks
throughout Europe via state-backed firms, such as Huawei and ZTE, pose
significant security risks to the interests and military forces if the
U.S., Allies, and Partners. These networks place intellectual property,
sensitive information, technology, and private personal information at
heightened risk of acquisition and exploitation by the Chinese
government. PRC continues to invest significantly in European ports and
transportation nodes, as well as other critical infrastructure in
Europe. USEUCOM works closely with our European defense counterparts to
articulate risks and establish a shared understanding of the security
environment. We also support the U.S. interagency in highlighting the
shared values, interests, and equitable business practices that
distinguish the current rules-based international order. European
nations are becoming increasingly aware of, and concerned about, the
strings attached to capital and investment from the PRC, and are
recognizing that the PRC is a systemic rival. Together, we must hold the
PRC accountable for its predatory and unfair practices and ensure that
Western technologies do not facilitate the PRC\'s military buildup.
Several countries have removed Huawei from their networks, imposed new
investment screening mechanisms, and have decided not to choose Chinese
investments particularly because of the threat this poses to European
security. More than at any time in recent years, our European Allies and
Partners recognize the risk PRC presents to European security. Eastern
Flank NATO\'s Eastern Flank remains a strategic focal point. It remains
at risk of Russian aggression and lies on the territorial periphery of
Russia\'s invasion of peaceful Ukraine. The geopolitical alignment of
the Bucharest 9 - Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary,
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia - reminds Russia of its
limited sphere of control and NATO\'s appeal to regional states. These
states have made significant contributions to assist Ukraine against
Russia\'s aggression. Collectively, they have provided both lethal and
non-lethal assistance, have opened their borders to Ukraine refugees,
closed their air space, and supported economic sanctions against Russia.
In the Baltics, the Russian government actively targets ethnic Russian
population with extensive propaganda and malign influence operations,
while conducting cyber operations to weaken Alliance resolve. Russian
forces along NATO\'s periphery in its Western Military District and
Kaliningrad hold a geographic and numerical advantage over regional
military and NATO enhanced Forward Presence forces. This imbalance
emphasizes the importance of timely indications and warnings that enable
the positioning of combat-capable forces to deter and respond if
deterrence fails. NATO Allies continue their commitment to collective
defense. Enhanced Forward Presence bolsters NATO\'s posture in the east
with four multinational battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and
Poland. Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Slovakia are all currently
working on additional posture plans within a NATO context. In the face
of Russia\'s aggression, the United States and our NATO Allies have
committed additional forces demonstrating our collective resolve. NATO
air and missile defense forces reinforce collective security and
stability through Baltic air policing operations and air defense
exercises. Each of these states contributes to their own defense and the
three Baltic States have expanded their efforts to control the maritime
domain in their littoral. Poland continues to meet Alliance commitments
through defense budget increases, infrastructure improvements, and
logistical support via the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement, and
its modernization efforts include Abrams tanks, Patriot air defense, and
F-35 weapon system acquisitions. Poland also hosts the U.S. Army\'s
Fifth Corps forward headquarters in Poznan, providing a needed level of
command and control to synchronize multi-national tactical formations
operating in Europe. Poland also demonstrates its commitment to
collective security by hosting additional U.S. forces during the current
crisis. Black Sea Region Russia continues to exert malign influence and
demonstrate its willingness to use overt force in the Black Sea region
to include use of its Black Sea fleet to attack Ukraine. The war in
Ukraine, instigated solely by Russia, continues to destabilize Ukrainian
security and the entire region. In addition to armed attack against
Ukraine, Russia continues to subvert the Ukrainian government through
malicious cyber activities and information operations, illegally
recognizing Ukraine\'s eastern areas of Donetsk and Luhansk as sovereign
states, and continuing to illegally occupy Crimea. Contrary to Russia\'s
intent, these coercive actions reinforce Ukraine\'s aspirations of
membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions. Russia\'s aggression also led
to a deployment of U.S. forces in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The Russian government exerts influence
over South Caucasus countries by exploiting regional tensions and
unresolved military conflicts, and employing economic levers and
provocative information activities. Russia maintains leverage over
Georgia by occupying the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia,
blocking free movement of people and goods within Georgia\'s territory,
detaining and harassing civilians living in and near occupied areas, and
undermining the NATO membership aspirations of Georgia and other partner
nations. After brokering a ceasefire arrangement between Armenia and
Azerbaijan in November 2020, Russia increased its military presence in
the region by deploying 2,000 troops to Nagorno-Karabakh as
\"peacekeepers.\" Since the early 1990s, Russia has continued to occupy
the Transnistria region of Moldova with 1,500 \"peacekeepers\" without
host nation consent. Moldovan President Sandu has called for the
withdrawal of Russian troops and we continue to support a peaceful
resolution to the Transnistrian conflict and full reintegration of
Transnistria with Moldova.

[Atlantic and the **Arctic Region**]{.underline}

[As part of the **global ocean**]{.underline}, the Atlantic and
[**[Arctic]{.mark} Oceans** [must remain open]{.mark} and [free to
**facilitate commerce**]{.mark} between Europe]{.underline}, **[North
America]{.underline}**, [and other international markets]{.underline}.
We ensure these vital sea lines of communication remain open by securing
the Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom gap, enabling access between the
Atlantic and Arctic. USEUCOM coordinates with U. S. Northern Command
(USNORTHCOM) in these regions ensuring a comprehensive approach between
Euro-Atlantic and homeland security. Collaborating with our European
defense counterparts, we work to [enhance interoperability and
proficiency]{.underline}, [while demonstrating **collective
resolve**]{.underline} to counter malign behavior.

In the Arctic, [[Russia continues to develop]{.mark} its **[Northern Sea
Route]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the [PRC seeks increased access to
expand its **Polar Silk Road**]{.underline} initiative. [The Chinese
government continues to invest in **Russian energy**]{.underline} and
[seeks economic footholds among **Arctic nations** to gain influence
over **regional governance**]{.underline}. To ensure openness, USEUCOM
joint forces maintain near persistent North Atlantic and Arctic presence
while strengthening all-domain relationships with Allies and Partners.
Alongside our UK, French, Norwegian, and Canadian counterparts, U.S.
maritime forces continue to demonstrate maritime capability and
credibility presence in the region.

The [[existing]{.mark} rules-based international [order benefits
**all**]{.mark} **Arctic [nations]{.mark}** by [facilitating
sustainable]{.mark} **economic [development]{.mark}**]{.underline},

**[U.S.]{.mark} Homeland**]{.underline}, Europe, [and the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. In concert with other Arctic advocates, [via
a **[whole-of-gov]{.mark}ernment approach**]{.underline}, USEUCOM [[must
continue to maintain]{.mark} a **[credible]{.mark} Arctic
[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline} to [ensure that growing competition

Network (NAADSN) and Ph.D. (\"Hybrid Attacks Rise on Undersea Cables in
Baltic and Arctic Regions\", *Eurasia Daily Monitor*,

The [Silver Dania, a [Russian]{.mark}-crewed [cargo ship]{.mark}, was
[detained]{.mark} by Norwegian authorities]{.underline} on January 31
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} suspected [**acts of [sabotage]{.mark}**
after reports that a **[fiber-optic cable]{.mark}** linked
between]{.underline} the Swedish island of [Gotland and Ventspils in
Latvia had been **[damaged]{.mark}**]{.underline} (TheLocal.no, February
1). After no evidence was found connecting the ship to the damaged
cable, the crew was released, and the Russian Embassy in Norway called
for an inquiry into the incident (Politiet.no; TASS, January 31).
[This]{.underline}, however, [is not an isolated incident]{.underline}.
[[**Russian hybrid attacks** on]{.mark} critical undersea infrastructure
(**[CUI]{.mark}**), particularly fiber optic cables]{.underline}, [[are
on the **rise**]{.mark}, particularly in the]{.underline} Baltic and
[Arctic]{.underline} seas. These [[cables]{.mark} are]{.underline} not
only [[crucial for **internet access**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but they
are [also [**essential communication** tools]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their
[[sabotage]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore, [[is **highly
disruptive**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [These types of attacks are an easy
and cheap strategy for Russia to cause disorder]{.underline} in northern
Europe. Unfortunately, deterring Russia is easier said than done.

This [**[rise in Russian attacks]{.mark}** has been a trend [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and Baltic areas [since 2021, when a LoVe
Ocean Observatory cable went out of service in northern
Norway]{.underline} (Institute of Marine Research, November 26, 2021).
[In 2022, a communications [fiber optic cable]{.mark} connecting
Svalbard to the Norwegian mainland was]{.underline} also suspiciously
**[damaged]{.underline}** (NRK.no, May 26, 2024). [This cable was key
for Norwegian communications]{.underline} to the mainland [and essential
for]{.underline} Norwegian **[[space
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Ibid). Neither incident, however,
was immediately labeled as an attack.

While the 2021 and 2022 cases could have been accidental, [in
2023]{.underline}, [a gas pipeline and data cable of the Baltic
Connector pipeline were damaged]{.underline} (Yle.fi, April 22, 2024).
[Investigators]{.underline} quickly [determined]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} the New Polar Bear, [a **Chinese container ship**,
was responsible for]{.underline} dragging its anchor along the ocean
floor and [damaging both cables while traversing between Russian
ports]{.underline} (ERR News, August 12, 2024). While Chinese officials
admitted that the vessel was responsible, they claimed it was an
accident (Ibid). [[In 2024, **two cables** in the Baltic]{.mark} Sea
[were **cut**]{.mark}, one connecting Germany to Finland and a second
connecting Lithuania to Sweden [by the Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline}
vessel Yi Peng 3 (ERR News, November 26, 2024).

[The]{.underline} 2023 and 2024 [incidents]{.underline} involved Chinese
vessels, which could [[indicate **increasing Russian-Chinese
cooperation**]{.mark} [on **hybrid attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There
is no evidence, however, to suggest that this cooperation exists,
particularly as experts have noted that Russian-Chinese cooperation in
the Arctic at large is still relatively limited (IFS Insights, May 2024)

Outside of these direct cable damage incidents, [concerns have been
raised about Russia using a **[shadow fleet]{.mark}** to **[map
CUI]{.mark}** in the Baltic Sea]{.underline} (DR.dk, April 19, 2023).
[This shadow fleet is made of military]{.underline} and civilian
[ships]{.underline}, allegedly [designed to **[disrupt]{.mark} wind
farms** and **communication cables** and **sabotage** the [Nordic
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The question remains about why Russia would use hybrid attacks in the
Baltic and Arctic. The [rise of attacks on sub-sea infrastructure,
particularly in the]{.underline} Baltic and [Arctic]{.underline}
regions, [is beneficial for Russia]{.underline}'s overall strategy. [Not
only is [direct attribution **extremely
difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which makes effective deterrence even
more challenging, [but]{.underline} such [[tactics fall beneath the
threshold of **armed conflict**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In remaining
underneath this threshold, [Russian actions present a **dilemma** to
Western governments]{.underline}. If they respond aggressively, Russia
can claim it is being harassed. By not responding, however, [Western
states may incentivize increasing attacks of this kind. Particularly in
the case of sub-sea infrastructure, where it takes time to investigate
the cable rupture, it is hard for]{.underline} a Western [government to
claim]{.underline} that [an attack was intentional and]{.underline} even
more challenging to [attribute the damage to a specific
actor]{.underline}. In other words, [[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} can
simultaneously employ plausible deniability and avoid outright war while
also [[causing **serious disruption**]{.mark} to Western
societies]{.underline}.

[Hybrid attacks]{.underline} also [allow Russia to **test** and
**[probe]{.mark}** the [defenses in the]{.mark} Baltic and
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [aim is to see how
resilient]{.underline} northern European [countries are to
**non-traditional attacks**]{.underline}. [From Russia's
perspective]{.underline}, such [attacks are]{.underline} relatively
[cheap and easy to conduct]{.underline}. It is difficult to prevent
ships from dragging their anchors, particularly if the ship does not
immediately cause suspicion.

As deterring Russia's behavior directly remains difficult, [there is no
reason to assume that hybrid CUI attacks will not continue]{.underline}.
Some evidence exists, however, that states in the Baltic and Arctic
areas are experimenting with new methods to disincentivize such hybrid
attacks. For example, the European Union released a statement on
December 26, 2024, claiming it would strengthen its efforts to protect
undersea cables using better detection technology (European Union
External Action, December 26, 2024). Additionally, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**) announced on
January 14 the deployment of a new Baltic Sentry "to [**[deter]{.mark}**
any [future attempts]{.mark} by a state or non-state actor [to damage
c]{.mark}ritical [u]{.mark}ndersea [i]{.mark}nfrastructure]{.underline}"
in the Baltic Sea (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, NATO,
January 14). Individual states can also deter Russian behavior (European
Union External Action Service, December 26, 2024). For example, when the
Finland-Estonia electric link was disrupted in December 2024, the
Finnish Border Guard quickly detained an oil tanker flying the Cook
Islands flag and brought it into Finnish territorial waters (Yle.fi,
December 26, 2024).

Whether [these]{.underline} or other [[deterrence]{.mark} measures
[**discourage Russia's will** to engage in hybrid
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline} is still an open question. While the effort
continues to be lower than the cost, [Russia has **every rationale** to
continue disrupting CUI in the]{.underline} Baltic and
[Arctic]{.underline} regions.

While users' experience of the Internet is always local,1 [[**Internet**
infrastructure is]{.mark} **truly [global]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
unfolds across diverse material forms: light pulses under the sea, radio
waves through the air, electricity through copper wires under the earth.
There is nowhere on our planet where this infrastructure isn't. [You can
get an Internet connection **anywhere** on the surface of the
earth]{.underline}.

For me, this image of the planet evokes both wonder and anxiety. It's
something incredible, but [[it's]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[something
that can destroy us]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Like our **planet**, the Internet is **in danger**. And, **like the
planet**, our **species** could go **down with the ship**]{.underline}.2
[If the Internet were to **destabilize**, **industrial collapse** could
well follow]{.underline}---locally, regionally, or

Without hyperbole, [how we **steward** the Internet will **determine the
fate** of our **species**. We cannot approach **climate change** without
a global internet, let alone manage a **global system** of
**trade**]{.underline}.3 [A **changing [climate]{.mark}**[, aging
**infrastructure**, and **a**]{.mark}]{.underline}n increasingly
[**[multi-polar]{.mark}** international [stage]{.mark} has [produced a
**recipe for**]{.mark}]{.underline} disaster---or rather, for
**[numerous [disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}**---which I expect would
fall differentially along the usual lines of power and privilege.4

Yet no one (at least, no one we know of) can tell us what exact risks
the Internet faces. What would happen if Russia hit Cloudflare with a
Stuxnet-level cyberattack? What would happen if large and increasingly
frequent storms brought down power in major cities worldwide? In these
scenarios, who would be affected, and how? Our inability to answer these
questions signals our difficulty in protecting against---or prioritizing
between---the risks they invoke. It testifies to a broader inability to
assess risks about the Internet.

Like scientists building models of the climate in the 1960s and 1970s,
we need models of the Internet

[When it comes to the Internet, **what we lack** is this: a **structural
model** that describes how the whole thing fits together]{.underline}.
Like scientists building models of the climate in the 1960s and 1970s,
we need models of the Internet both to stave off disaster and shepherd a
stable and global internet into the future.

How do we build such a model? That's the question I'll puzzle through
over the next few weeks.

First, we'll have to understand why the Internet is in such danger. See
the next post in the series: Why is the Internet in danger?

Thanks to Sean Beld---you know why.

[Why is the **Internet** in **danger**?]{.underline}

Part 2. Toward a structural model of the Internet

Nick Merrill

Last week, I told you that the Internet is in danger. A fight for
control threatens to destabilize and fragment the Internet, and the
stakes are existential.

This week, I'll tell you why the Internet is in danger.

It's best to start with an example:

[A **storm** hits the **mid-Atlantic**]{.underline}. A big storm, ten or
a hundred times bigger than Ida. [[There are **mass**]{.mark}ive power
[**outages**, more **widespread**]{.mark}]{.underline} and harder to
recover from than those during Hurricaine Sandy. [[Data centers]{.mark},
Internet [exchange]{.mark} points, [and]{.mark} service [providers are
**offline**]{.mark}]{.underline}. What will happen to the global
Internet?

The received wisdom is, "Internet traffic will route around the failure.
Eventually, when power restores, the Internet will heal, bringing people
in affected regions back online."

Prove it! [Prove]{.underline} to me that Internet routing will heal in a
reasonable amount of time. That [the failure won't **cascade** to other
regions of the U.S., or to **other countries**]{.underline}.

That's our problem. [No one can argue with any **empirical certainty**
about **which kinds** of events **will or will not** cause the Internet
to **collapse** (bringing global **industrial production** down with
it)]{.underline}. The rest of this post elaborates on this predicament.
I address it from two angles: first, that we can't assess risks to the
Internet; and second, that we can't prioritize between opportunities to
improve it.

1\. We can't assess risk

During Superstorm Sandy, BGP1 did not heal the way we expected. That was
2012. I shudder to think what would happen now, in an Internet that's
more complex, interdependent, and privately-held2 than that one. (Now,
add in more frequent and severe storms in a changing climate).

Meanwhile, [[a **small number** of]{.underline}]{.mark} content
distribution networks (**[[CDNs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[serve]{.underline}]{.mark} most of the content on [[the Internet. CDN
service is]{.mark} **highly [centralized]{.mark}** among a few players
and absolutely ubiquitous]{.underline}; you can't use the Internet (let
alone host a service) without them. [[Centralization produces]{.mark}
**central [points]{.mark}** [of **failure**]{.mark}, and the opacity
caused by privatization confounds **oversight** and **risk
management**]{.underline}. Imagine a Stuxnet-level attack on Cloudflare.
What would happen?

While catastrophic internet failure remains unlikely, it's both more
likely than it should be and hard to estimate the exact likelihood of,
in part because we cannot articulate what types of events could
precipitate it.

What would happen if a storm bigger than Ida hit New York? If there were
widespread power outages in the Los Angeles Metro area? If Cloudflare
went down? No one knows how long it would take for BGP to heal in those
situations, let alone any downstream effect. That alone should terrify
you. While catastrophic internet failure remains unlikely, it's both
more likely than it should be and hard to estimate the exact likelihood
of, in part because we cannot articulate what types of events could
precipitate it.3

2\. We can't prioritize upgrades

[[The Internet]{.mark}, generally speaking, [is **fragile**]{.mark}
**and [insecure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many of the risks I mentioned
above stem from issues with its basic design.4 [Unfortunately, [starting
from **scratch**]{.mark}]{.underline} on this whole "internet" thing
[just [**isn't in the cards**: due to **global reliance**]{.mark} on the
Internet for trade, pricing, finance, healthcare, and pretty much
**everything else**]{.underline}, radical or disruptive change to the
Internet is not a practical option. Incremental change is the only way
to preserve a singular, globally shared Internet like the one we have
today.

We may only get one chance in a generation to upgrade any given
protocol.

As a result, the global Internet governance community is awash in
proposals to upgrade the Internet's fundamental operation. Replacing the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) with Secure BGP, upgrading the Domain Name
System (DNS) with DNSSEC, and the transition from IPv4 to IPv6 are just
a few examples of ongoing and proposed upgrades for the global Internet.

But performing these upgrades isn't as straightforward as it seems.
Here's why.

Upgrades take time---lots of time

[[As the]{.mark} globally uneven and still-ongoing
**[transition]{.mark}** from IPv4 to **IPv6**
[demonstrates]{.mark}]{.underline}, we may only get one chance in a
generation to upgrade any given protocol. And maintaining backward
compatibility---a necessary evil as upgrades roll out unevenly---raises
its own security challenges.5 We must pick strategically among upgrades,
given the high costs of performing them.

If the IPv6 upgrade happens at its current pace, will Africa run out of
IP addresses? If we fail to secure inter-domain routing, [could
[**Russia**, **China**, or the **U.S.** disrupt]{.mark} the **world's
[Internet]{.mark}** during a **conflict**?]{.underline}

Upgrades are political

[[**Internet upgrades** are]{.mark} political, especially in an
internet]{.underline} that, while still hegemonically dominated by the
U.S., [is increasingly **splintering** into **national internets** in
places like China, Russia, and the E.U. In practice, any internet
upgrade acts either as a **power-grab**]{.underline} (Huawei's NewIP is
an infamous example) [or an **implicit endorsement** of continued **U.S.
hegemony** over the network]{.underline}.

[As the Internet **increasingly** becomes [a site of **geopolitical
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}, 6 [we must articulate the political
risks of new upgrades]{.underline}, and weigh them against the upgrades'
projected upside. Currently, we lack an empirical foothold to do so: we
lack models that help us advocate for one upgrade over another.

As the Internet increasingly becomes a site of geopolitical conflict,
how do we articulate the political risks of new upgrades, weigh them
against their projected upside?

The Internet is opaque

We cannot effectively advocate for upgrades partly because we cannot
account for their effect on the contemporary Internet's most critical
infrastructure: privatized cloud services.7 Despite these
infrastructures' vital importance, we don't know how they connect to the
global Internet or one another. In an opaque network, operator upgrades
could matter more or less than we might expect them to.8

Is it prudent or wreckless to break up CDN monopolies? What about using
content-addressed protocols to supplant them?

Alternatives to our Internet are quickly emerging

Alternatives to the Internet stack are bubbling up with or without input
from the global Internet governance community. Rising interest in
blockchain technologies is yielding alternatives to core
application-layer technologies like DNS and TLS.9 New physical
infrastructures, be they in Brooklyn or Havana, afford the opportunity
to create parallel Internets from the ground up. Alternative physical
and logical internets threaten to fragment the global Internet in
unpredictable ways and with unforeseen consequences.

We have existing global governance mechanisms on one hand, and we have
radical change through the grassroots on the other. How do we weigh the
risks of revolution against the dangers of upgrading an insecure and
hegemonic Internet through its existing bodies?

Pivotal moments

Melting freshwater from Greenland's ice sheet is slowing down the AMOC
earlier than climate models suggested.

Melting ice in Greenland is slowing down the Gulf Stream more quickly
than expected, threatening its collapse. Exactly when the Gulf Stream
might collapse, and what might happen if it does, is impossible to
forecast precisely. Yet our models are good enough to tell us that such
a collapse would cost millions of lives. Photograph: Ulrik
Pedersen/NurPhoto/REX/Shutterstock

At the beginning of this post, I used the term "existential risk."
Forget that.

Consider this:

Climate crisis: Scientists spot warning signs of Gulf Stream collapse \|
The Guardian

Climate scientists have detected warning signs of the collapse of the
Gulf Stream, one of the planet's main potential tipping points.

\[\...\]

Such an event would have catastrophic consequences around the world,
severely disrupting the rains that billions of people depend on for food
in India, South America and West Africa; increasing storms and lowering
temperatures in Europe; and pushing up the sea level off eastern North
America. It would also further endanger the Amazon rainforest and
Antarctic ice sheets.

\[\...\]

The complexity of the AMOC system and uncertainty over levels of future
global heating make it impossible to forecast the date of any collapse
for now. It could be within a decade or two, or several centuries away.
But the colossal impact it would have means it must never be allowed to
happen, the scientists said.

Events like the Gulf Stream collapsing are granular, interim events.
Pivotal moments between today and possible tomorrows. Colossal events
that must not be allowed to happen. The goal of climate science is to
identify these moments and guide us to avoid them.

This is what we need to do for the Internet.10

Next week, I\'ll talk about how we might do it. I hope you\'ll join.

Forecasting a storm

Part 3 of a series

I'm a researcher at the UC Berkeley Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity
where I direct the Daylight Lab. This newsletter is my work as I do it:
more than half-baked, less than peer-reviewed. This post is part of a
series on building a structural model of the Internet. Find the
beginning of that series here.

No one can argue with any empirical certainty about which kinds of
events will or will not cause the Internet to collapse. Without
empirical arguments, we can't identify which risks might cause global
chaos, let alone which upgrades would help protect against them. So how
could we make such arguments?

Only one method has stood the test of time: creating a model of the
environment in question and comparing its outputs to empirical
observations. By determining the model's errors and residuals against
observed data, researchers improve the model. Rinse and repeat. This
process is, broadly speaking, how we learned how to predict the weather.

Business Blackout

Here\'s an example of this concept executed well. In 2015, Lloyd\'s bank
constructed a scenario called Business Blackout, which assessed the
economic impact of widespread Internet failures.

The authors imagined a coordinated cyberattack on a series of power
stations in the Northeastern United States. Using various assumptions
about dependencies across different industries, they projected both
direct and indirect losses, projecting long-term GDP hits to the tune of
trillions of dollars.\[1\]This scenario highlights, if anything, that
turning the Internet off even for a few days can produce unbelievably
large costs to society. So the costs of the global Internet collapsing
are unfathomable. But I take it you already believe me the stakes are
high here, or you wouldn't be reading the footnotes.\[/1\]

Comparing observations to expectations

Business Blackout is a careful and defensible economic analysis. But
there's a critical difference between this model and a weather model.
With a weather model, I can make a projection for the next day and go to
sleep. I'll wake up the next morning and see how I did. By repeatedly
"diffing" my projection against observation, I can iteratively improve
my model. Multiply this process across every inhabited location on
Earth, and you're getting a lot of corrective cycles in.

We can't compare Business Blackout to anything! What am I supposed to
do, wait for a cyberattack on the Northeastern power grid? How are we
supposed to improve our ability to make such models in any general sense
without some empirical grounding in observed outages?

In general, how can we compare model errors and residuals when we
simulate the impact of black-swan events?2 By intentionally causing
outages in order to refine our models. I'll be talking a lot more about
this concept in the coming weeks. But hold onto it for now, as there are
some other components to cover first.

Tweak, update, reproduce

Let's cover a few more downsides of the Business Blackout model.3 The
model is hard to reproduce or update. What if I need to try different
model parameters? There's no code to run! As the world and Internet
change (as they both have since 2015), [the [ability to]{.mark}
**flexibly [update]{.mark}** [models is]{.mark} increasingly
**[important]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[4\]As I\'ve already argued, [a
**stable [Internet]{.mark}** [is a **prerequisite** for]{.mark} **global
[stability]{.mark}**. We're pretty "locked-in" to this Internet, so
disruptions to it would be **mega-bad**]{.underline}, as I've argued.
But even beyond that historical circumstance, I believe a singular,
shared system of communication is a global, pre-competitive good,
conceptually similar to global trade.

\[/4\]

What can we do to make this kind of structural analysis accessible and
reproducible enough to guide and inform diverse decision-makers
(government, industry, civil society, and beyond)? We need an open,
structural model on top of which different simulations can be run and
their results shared for reproducibility. As we'll discussing in the
coming weeks, this 'spec' sometimes collides with legitimate needs for
privacy and secrecy, which range from individual privacy to national
security. Again, hold on to this idea. There's one more thing to cover.

Control points and systemic risk

One last critique of the Business Blackout model. While its approach to
calculating economic reverberations of an Internet outage is
fine-grained, its approach to the Internet itself is relatively coarse.
The authors imagine an Internet-based attack, which is itself realistic,
but the attack simply turns the power off. This sort of analysis might
be helpful for Internet shutdowns of the sort we\'ve seen in India and
beyond, but the most dangerous Internet disruptions are more complex
than the Internet being on or off.

Consider: On the morning of Thursday, June 8, 2021, Amazon.com was down.
CNN was down. HBO, Pinterest, Spotify, GitHub, Reddit, Twitch,
StackOverflow were all down. So was gov.uk, the UK\'s government
website. What happened? A coordinated cyberattack? No, just human error
at Fastly, the world\'s second-largest content delivery network (CDN).

[[CDN **downtime**]{.mark} can [cause **cascading**
failures]{.mark}]{.underline}---what Welburn & Strong (2019) call
systemic risk. For example, even if the Financial Times does not
directly use Fastly on their user-facing webpage, a build tool in their
engineering supply chain may require a library that\'s stored on a
Fastly server. As a result, a Fastly outage will bring down the
Financial Times via its supply chain. Think of it this way: billions of
web pages use thousands of different software supply chains, using some
combination of the same hundreds of common tools, which are in turn
delivered by some eleven CDNs. [[Disruptions]{.mark} at the base of this
inverted pyramid can [cause]{.mark} **massive**, and
difficult-to-predict **patterns of failure**]{.underline} at the levels
above.

[This class of errors---**[systemic risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}---are
our primary concern. And CDNs are a wonderful example of how they
[happen: [through **interruptions**]{.mark} or **unexpected behavior**
[in]{.mark} which]{.underline} David Clark calls [["**control
points**"]{.underline}]{.mark}---entities on whom downstream actions and
services [depend]{.underline}.

#### Communication shortfalls triggers [miscalculation]{.underline} and [unintentional Arctic war.]{.underline} 

Sandra **Erwin '22**\-\--Sandra Erwin writes about military space
programs, policy, and technology at SpaceNews. She has covered the
military, the Pentagon, Congress and the defense industry for nearly two
decades as editor of NDIA's National Defense Magazine and Pentagon
correspondent for Real Clear Defense. (\"Melting Arctic ice opens new
front in strategic power competition\", *SpaceNews*,
https://spacenews.com/melting-arctic-ice-opens-new-front-in-strategic-power-competition/,
5-12-2022). Accessed 7-27-2025 by NT-RM.

[There is a [huge need in the Arctic for **reliable surveillance** and
**communications**]{.mark} systems because
[**miscommunications**]{.mark} could [trigger **unintended
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Lt. Gen. S. Clinton Hinote, deputy
chief of staff for Air Force Futures, said at a Wilson Center panel
discussion.

"[Awareness]{.underline} about what is going on [in the Arctic is a key
part of **preserving peace**]{.underline}," he said.

For example, in military wargames, the "[[avenues]{.mark} of approaches
[over the Arctic]{.mark}" [for **enemy missiles**]{.mark} or **bombers**
[are]{.mark} [a]{.mark} major [concern]{.mark}. "The [Arctic is]{.mark}
the [**shortest route** between]{.mark} our [competitors and
us]{.mark}."]{.underline}

The U.S. Air Force has operated in the Arctic for decades, Hinote said.
"But our [use of the Arctic as a strategic buffer is eroding
for]{.underline} all the reasons that have been talked about, especially
[**[climate change]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} especially with some of
[the activities]{.underline} that [we see [**Russia** and
**China**]{.mark} engaging in]{.underline}."

[As the Arctic melts,]{.underline} "[[**competition** for **resources**
and **influence**]{.mark} in the region will
[increase]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

Hinote said the U.S. Air Force in recent years has intercepted and
warned away a growing number of Russian military planes flying near the
edge of Alaska's restricted airspace. These security concerns "drove our
focus on the Arctic and the release of a strategy."

Wargames organized by the U.S. military and allies typically have
focused on "countering great powers specifically in Europe and in the
Asia Pacific," Hinote said. "And one of the things that we felt like we
did not understand as well was how that competition would spill over
into the Arctic."

Live military exercises like NATO's Cold Response, NORAD's Operation
Noble Defender, and Northern Command's Arctic Edge are helping the U.S.
and allies "understand the nature of the competition," he said. The
submarine-focused Ice Exercise (ICEX) has been held since the 1960s,
making it the longest-running Arctic exercise.

To bolster the U.S. posture in the Arctic, the Air Force is stationing
54 F-35 advanced fighter aircraft at Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska.

"[[Alaska is]{.mark} an [incredibly **well-positioned**]{.mark} **base**
[of operations]{.mark} for defending the northern approaches to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, and this is why so many of the
intercepts that happen when an adversary's aircraft is coming from the
north are done with assets that are stationed in Alaska," Hinote said.

The Department of the Air Force's Arctic strategy also recommends
greater use of space assets to support military and homeland defense
efforts.

"Space capabilities are tailor-made to support a region where there is
sparse ground infrastructure," Lt. Gen. William Liquori, deputy chief of
space operations for strategy, plans and programs for the U.S. Space
Force, said at the Wilson Center panel.

"The satellite command-and-control capabilities that we have at Thule,
those are there because military operations are going to happen in the
Arctic," said Liquori. "And that means we're going to need to have
satellite coverage in the Arctic."

To fill gaps in satellite communications coverage over the Arctic, the
Air Force worked out a deal with the Norwegian Space Agency subsidiary
Space Norway to launch two U.S. military communications payloads on
Norwegian satellites. The payloads, developed by Northrop Grumman, will
be integrated into the Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission satellites,
projected to launch on a SpaceX rocket in 2023.

[Any Arctic strategy has to consider the importance of the space
domain]{.underline}, said Mir Sadat, a nonresident fellow at the
Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security.

[The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [is
[**not doing enough** to "prepare for the **new
frontier**]{.mark}."]{.underline} In contrast, [Russia and
China]{.underline}, by increasing their activities in the region, [are
positioning to one day take advantage of **shorter sea
lanes**]{.underline}, Sadat said. A key goal for China and Russia is to
"reach global markets or military targets faster and much more cheaply,"
he said.

Satellites to watch what Russia and others are doing on the ground is
another critical capability that the United States might need to expand,
said Scott Herman, CEO of Cognitive Space.

The company participated in the recent Arctic Edge 2022 exercise as a
military contractor, orchestrating collection opportunities across
commercial satellite operators.

Today, many commercial remote-sensing constellations can't support
Arctic activities because they can't reach those high latitudes, said
Herman. But if the [[Arctic]{.mark} becomes [a **geopolitical
flashpoint**]{.mark}]{.underline}, "you may see some adjustments to some
of the satellite constellation plans to make sure they've got sufficient
northern exposure."

In its strategy, the Department of the Air Force said there is a need
for "domain awareness through new technologies ranging from over the
horizon radar to space assets."

[FEARS OF 'MISCOMMUNICATION']{.underline}

Michael Sfraga, chair and distinguished fellow of the Wilson Center's
Polar Institute, said an imminent war in the Arctic is unlikely.

"I think that's a low probability," said Sfraga, who is based in Alaska.
But he believes the risk will increase as countries step up activities.

"[The [high]{.mark}er [probability]{.mark}]{.underline}, unfortunately,
[is a **miscommunication**]{.underline}: [[An exercise gone wrong, a
**missile fired by mistake**, **Russian bombers**]{.underline}]{.mark}
are [escorted out of our airspace [and]{.mark} there's a
[miscommunication between **pilots**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

[Russia's invasion of **[Ukraine]{.mark}** now [casts things in a
different light]{.mark}]{.underline}, he added. "No one thought
something like Ukraine would actually happen. If anybody would have told
you 20 years ago that [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} would have [[built
islands in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}
and claimed that territory, I would have said that seems pretty
far-fetched." The [lesson for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is to remain "**vigilant** and
**diligent**."]{.underline}

[It's well known that [Russia derives]{.mark} a [significant]{.mark}
portion of its [GDP from natural resource development]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}, Sfraga said. It's also continuing to expand its
military presence and capabilities in the region. "[[China]{.mark},
which]{.underline} sometimes [forgets that it's not actually an Arctic
state, is doing everything it can to [establish]{.mark} its own
[**influence** in]{.mark} **Arctic [governance]{.mark}** [and **economic
development**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}"

"While there's no imminent threat of conflict in the Arctic, the
[[increasing activity]{.mark} and proximity [of]{.mark}]{.underline}
these [[aggressive powers requires]{.mark} the U.S. to maintain
[**situational awareness** and **operational capacity**]{.mark}**," he
said.**]{.underline}

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has to be better prepared
to operate in the Arctic]{.underline}, Sfraga said, and noted that
satellite-based services are sorely needed in the area.

"Satellite **[[communications]{.underline}]{.mark}**, imagery, all of
those things [are very [important to]{.mark} our [national]{.mark} and
civil [security]{.mark}]{.underline}, search and rescue," he said.
"There's just limited capacity."

"**[[Presence equals influence]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said.
"[Showing potential adversaries that you can]{.underline} actually
[conduct operations and protect your own interests in]{.underline} a
landscape like [the Arctic [serves as a **deterrent**]{.mark} and is
**incredibly important.**]{.underline}"

## Extraction

### Extraction\-\--1AC 

#### Advantage 2 is [EXTRACTION]{.underline}:

#### China is currently monopolizing the REE chain -- Arctic mines will solidify their claim

[Rare earth elements ([REEs) are vital for communications]{.mark}, the
[green energy]{.mark} transition [and defense,]{.mark} [but]{.mark} are
[produced]{.mark} almost [exclusively in China.]{.mark}]{.underline} As
the projected REE mines in southern Greenland inch closer to
realization, Denmark and its EU partners remain sidelined from future
supply chains for raw materials.

[Two [mining projects]{.mark} in Greenland, Kvanefjeld and
Kringlerne]{.underline}, locally known as Kuannersuit and Killavaat
Alannguat, have [[revealed]{.mark} some of the [largest resources
of]{.mark} [r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lement[s]{.mark} [in
the world.]{.mark}]{.underline} If final approval is obtained from the
Greenlandic authorities and funding is secured, the [sites could [become
significant suppliers of raw materials]{.mark} essential to the growing
electrification of transport, green energy, communications and defense
systems]{.underline}. It remains to be seen, however, to what extent
future mining of REEs in South Greenland will strengthen and secure
European energy independence, [or if REE mining in Greenland will
[galvanize the]{.mark} almost [exclusive China dominated production and
market.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

In early September 2020, Tanbreez Greenland A/S was granted a mining
lease for the Kringlerne REE project. Just a few weeks later, Greenland
Minerals A/S reported that the Kvanefjeld REE project, just eight
kilometres north of Kringlerne, had submitted a successful Environmental
Impact Assessment and been cleared for its public hearing, the last step
before a mining license can be issued. 

Locally, there are concerns about the environmental impacts of future
mining operations. In particular the Kvanefjeld project, which involves
mining uranium as a by-product, is being criticized, as uranium mining
remains a controversial and divisive subject in Greenland. However, many
members of the Greenlandic political establishment see both projects as
an opportunity to create much needed jobs and economic development, as
well as being a long-term stepping-stone on the path to independence.

[[China]{.mark} as [a green-energy superpower]{.mark}]{.underline}

[China's role as the world's leading REE producer took off in the early
1980s,]{.underline} when the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission tightened
restrictions on the mining and production of REE metals, causing the
American industry to collapse. [China stepped into the void and
[acquired the technology and the IP rights,]{.mark} while subsequently
launching a national strategy [to dominate]{.mark} production and the
market in the [REE]{.mark} sector.]{.underline} As a result, China today
[[has the expertise]{.mark}, IP rights [and production
facilities]{.mark}, as well as its own REE-consuming
industries]{.underline}. China also [manufactures a significant and
growing share of goods containing REEs, [making it practically
impossible for competing]{.mark} companies [outside China]{.mark} to get
a foothold.]{.underline} \
 \
China is [[making great efforts to maintain]{.mark} [this]{.mark}
economically important [position,]{.mark} and it classifies the REE
industry and related exports as strategic.]{.underline} As a result of
this de facto monopoly, [[Western]{.mark}]{.underline} countries
classify REE raw materials as critical, and various [[political
initiatives]{.mark} have been launched [to establish independent
REE]{.mark} value [chains]{.mark}. So far, however, they [have been
unsuccessful,]{.mark} and many [European companies engaged in]{.mark}
the current [green transition rely on]{.mark} continuous
[Chinese]{.mark} supplies of products containing REEs. ]{.underline}

\[map omitted\]

REEs essential for green and defense technology

[[REEs occur everywhere in modern technology]{.mark} and [are
indispensable]{.mark} for the transformation of the energy and transport
sectors]{.underline}. With the effects of climate change gathering pace,
[the [demand for]{.mark} sustainable energy and [REE-dependent
products]{.mark}, which are [vital to renewable]{.mark} energy
solutions, is [only]{.mark} likely to
[increase]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} REEs are also [[essential for
magnets in electric vehicles]{.mark}.]{.underline} The market share of
electric vehicles is still small but growing fast. [By 2040, electric
vehicles are projected to make up more than half of all new vehicles
sold.]{.underline} Although all types of vehicles use REEs in electronic
equipment, an electric car uses about a kilogram of REE for the engine
alone, and offshore wind turbines about 200 kilos per megawatt. 

Furthermore[, REEs are [playing]{.mark} increasing [roles in European
and US military technology]{.mark}, being used in [warships,]{.mark}
fighter [planes, aerospace]{.mark} technology, [surveillance, lasers,
etc]{.mark}.]{.underline} [According to a 2020 NATO report on energy
security](https://enseccoe.org/data/public/uploads/2020/03/nato-ensec-coe-operational-highlights-no13.pdf),
an American submarine of the Virginia class requires about 400 tons of
REEs, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer more than two tons and an F-35
fighter plane 400 kilos. This demand may in fact be even more
challenging than it looks in relation to yearly global production, since
certain sector-specific REEs are in greater demand than others. [As the
[NATO]{.mark} report [states, 'The more sophisticated]{.mark} the
military [equipment becomes, the more]{.mark} diverse is the [demand for
rare earths]{.mark} for the armed forces (\...) However, at present,
[NATO's]{.mark} import [dependency on China's REE is]{.mark} nearly [100
percent.']{.mark} ]{.underline}

What are rare earth elements?

Rare earth elements comprise a group of seventeen elements that occur
jointly in nature due to their chemical and physical similarities. REEs
are in fact less rare than many commonly mined metals such as gold,
silver and platinum. Their misleading label dates back more than two
hundred years, when the first REE (yttrium) was discovered in Sweden, at
a time when 'rare' simply meant 'extraordinary'. 

Hundreds of individual REE minerals are known, although only a few are
commercially attractive.  Economically the magnet sector dwarfs the
other REE-consuming sectors, as it represents 79 percent of the global
market value of REEs, which is worth USD 2.2 billion, but only about 29
percent of global volumes. Consequently, the mineral prospects that
attract the greatest investment interest are those projects that are
most closely aligned with the specific demands of the magnet sector.
Production of REEs thus entails both high-priced and low-priced elements
due to the natural distribution of REE. This fact is a key economic
parameter for any new REE mining project.

[The REE market is a specialty market, characterized by
business-to-business trade -- and dominated by domestic Chinese
trade]{.underline} -- rather than by the metals exchanges. REE raw
materials and products are tailored to fit the specific demands of
REE-consuming sectors, such as transport, communications and defense,
and generally no substitutions are applicable. [The vast majority of
these products are manufactured in China, and subsequently the vast
majority of REEs are exported embedded in high-tech components and
goods, thus [boosting]{.mark} both their value and [the Chinese
economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The firm Chinese grip on the global REE market, including control of
REE technologies, production capacities, IP rights, comprehensive value
chains, export quotas and price controls, are efficient obstacles to the
development of a free market in REEs]{.underline}

Why the Next War Will Be Won or Lost in the Arctic

[[The Arctic is insufficiently prioritized]{.underline}]{.mark} amidst
the United States' competing global interests. [The future battlefield
is melting and [demands US attention]{.mark},]{.underline} as a
partnership between Russia and the People's Republic of China fuels
strategic competition in the Arctic. [Thus, [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates must adopt a proactive Arctic strategy, [working
with]{.mark} its [NATO]{.mark} Allies to [ensure that the Arctic
remains]{.mark} [stable]{.mark} and free from conflict.]{.underline} The
US's 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) outlines that the United
States "seeks a stable Arctic region characterized by adherence to
internationally agreed upon rules and norms."^1)^ To achieve a secure
Arctic, [the 2024 Arctic Strategy, produced]{.underline} by the U.S.
Department of Defense, follows a "monitor-and-respond" approach.
However, [this [reactive]{.mark} [strategy is
inadequate]{.mark}.^2)^]{.underline}

[Russia's 2022 invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark} provides [evidence that
Moscow]{.mark} will]{.underline} not adhere to the current global order
and will [continue to [challenge Western]{.mark} international
[norms]{.mark} wherever possible, [including in the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} NATO's growing appeal among European states
suggests that [NATO may also be called upon to guarantee the future of
Arctic stability.]{.underline} Instead of dividing Europe, isolating
Ukraine, and expanding its influence, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has
resulted in a closer alliance between the United States and its Arctic
NATO allies. Moreover, NATO, with the accession of Finland and Sweden,
has expanded, and now [s[even out of the eight Arctic nations are NATO
members.]{.mark} The alliance offers [an opportunity for the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates to strengthen its [position in the
Arctic]{.mark} region while [not having to go it
alone.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The current US Arctic Strategy insufficiently counters Russian and
Chinese strategic Arctic ambitions, though the makings of a more
effective Arctic Strategy already exist in the pages of the 2024 Arctic
Strategy. Washington must build on this foundation, shifting its mindset
towards the Arctic. [A proactive Arctic Strategy is needed, in which the
United States and its NATO partners are not afraid to define the rules
and laws governing the north]{.underline}. Critics of this approach will
claim that taking a more assertive position in the Arctic will further
antagonize Russia and divert important resources from the Indo-Pacific
region and China. This is simply not the case. [[Russia and
China]{.mark} have [already]{.mark} taken steps to claim and [militarize
the Arctic]{.mark}. By [acting now,]{.mark} the US and its NATO [allies
will be better positioned]{.mark} to counter the threat posed by Russia
and China in the Arctic and beyond.]{.underline}

Why [[the Next War Will Be Won or Lost in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Climate change]{.mark} has accelerated strategic
competition]{.underline} in the region among both Arctic and non-Arctic
nations, such as China. Melting sea ice from rising global temperatures
has [[created new]{.mark} military and economic [opportunities]{.mark}
in the region. Since 1979, the Arctic has warmed four times faster than
the rest of the world,]{.underline} according to an August 2022
scientific study published in *Nature*.^3)^ As ice rapidly melts in the
Arctic, [[increased access to critical rare earth elements]{.mark}, such
as [platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel]{.mark} emerge.
Moreover, [melting ice]{.mark} is [open]{.mark}ing more easily traversed
Arctic waters, which has led to [a surge of]{.mark} both [military and
commercial ship]{.mark} activity in the region]{.underline}. These two
developments have increased the potential for conflict in the Arctic.

[Any [nation that can effectively mine, process, and refine]{.mark} the
[materials]{.mark} will [have a strategic
advantage.]{.mark}]{.underline} These minerals are [[required
for]{.mark} developing technologies ranging from [renewable]{.mark}
energy systems [to]{.mark} electronics used for [national
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} According to the World Bank, [the
[demand to produce minerals,]{.mark} many of which are found in the
Arctic, could [increase by]{.mark} nearly [500 percent by 2050 to
meet]{.mark} the growing [demand f]{.mark}or clean energy
technologies.^4)^ China already dominates the global supply chain for
critical materials. [The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [depends on
these materials]{.mark} for its economic competitiveness and national
defense.^5)^]{.underline}

As ice melts[, [new routes are emerging]{.mark} that are more
navigable]{.underline}. This has resulted in more ship activity in the
region. For instance, the Arctic Council Working Group on the Protection
of the Arctic Marine Environment reports that [there has been a 37
percent increase in ship numbers and distance sailed in the Arctic over
the past ten years]{.underline}.^6)^ While much of this activity is
commercial[, [Russia and China]{.mark} have also [taken
advantage]{.mark} of the new sea routes [to project t]{.mark}heir [naval
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. They have carried out numerous regional
deployments and patrols, [demonstrating their ability to execute
military operations in the austere Arctic climate.^7)^]{.underline} The
expanded presence of Russian and Chinese ships in the region [poses [a
growing threat to NATO]{.mark} member states]{.underline}. In October
2023, Finnish investigators suspected the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar
Bear of dragging its anchor over the seabed and [severing three Baltic
telecom cables and one pipeline.]{.underline} While the international
community has not assigned blame wholly to China, [[China]{.mark} later
admitted to accidentally [destroy]{.mark}ing an [important gas
pipeline]{.mark} connecting Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea in
2024. These examples suggest [that incidents of this nature]{.mark}
could [become more likely as military activity increases]{.mark} in the
region.^8)\ ^]{.underline}

//AChiong

Why [the [U.S. Needs its Arctic NATO Allies]{.mark}]{.underline}

The United States has already begun to take a more active approach in
the Arctic; however, the region must become an even greater priority.
[Following [Finnish and Swedish accession]{.mark} to NATO, the
alliance's center of gravity,]{.underline} its primary source of
strength and stability[, [shifted North]{.mark} and closer to the
Russian border.]{.underline} This is not the first instance of NATO
borders moving closer to Russia. In 2007, Putin provided a final
"friendly" warning that NATO expansion "represents a serious provocation
that reduces the level of mutual trust."^25)^ The National Defense
Strategy (NDS) reaffirms its commitment to NATO, underscoring the
importance of collective defense aimed at deterring Russian aggression.
Despite this stated commitment, the NDS does not directly address how it
will respond in the event that Russia attacks a NATO member state,
forcing the alliance to respond. While the current NDS and Arctic
Strategy offer assurances of protection to the U.S. homeland, [a
[proactive Arctic posture]{.mark} will [mitigate future conflict]{.mark}
in the region.]{.underline}

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates already views itself as a leader in
the European Arctic]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War, the
United States has [[sought to uphold i]{.mark}nternational [law,]{.mark}
close gaps in [governance, and]{.mark} protect [sovereign
rights]{.mark}]{.underline} in the European Arctic.^26)^ The United
States was [integral in developing multiple intergovernmental
institutions, including the Arctic Council]{.underline} in
1991.^27)^ With growing competition in the European Arctic, [the United
States should]{.underline} continue to use its great power status to
[[insert itself as a lead actor]{.mark} in the region [through]{.mark}
the establishment of a proactive Arctic Strategy coupled with enhanced
[economic and military cooperation with]{.mark} its Nordic [NATO]{.mark}
Allies]{.underline}. Today, while Russia is engrossed in its war against
Ukraine, the United States and its allies have [the opportunity to
remain one step ahead.]{.underline}

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, [the United States has begun
to increase its presence in the European High North.]{.underline}
Underscoring the importance of collective defense, the United States has
entered into several new bilateral Defense Cooperation Agreements (DCA)
with Nordic nations. In 2022, the United States signed a DCA with
Norway, which acknowledges that the presence of U.S. forces in Norway
contributes to strengthening the security and stability of the region
and permit American forces unimpeded access to four Norwegian military
bases.^28)^ Since the establishment of the defense agreement, Norway and
the United States added an amendment, allowing U.S. forces and NATO
allies to access eight additional facilities in Norway for military
purposes, emphasizing the growing security threat in the European
Arctic.^29)^ Following Norway's lead, Denmark signed its DCA with the
United States in 2023 followed by Finland and Sweden in 2024.^30)^ DCAs
such as these offer increased and mutually beneficial opportunities for
the United States and its Nordic NATO Allies to prepare for any future
hostilities.

As part of the US's proactive Arctic Strategy, [Washington should
[prioritize economic investments]{.mark} in companies owned by NATO
members.]{.underline} Through these investments[, energy security within
NATO can be improved, and the [nations can decrease]{.mark} their
[dependence on rare earth]{.mark} materials [from
China]{.mark}.]{.underline} The United States has already [taken initial
steps to secure critical mineral and clean energy supply chains, but
[more can be done]{.mark}.]{.underline} In September 2024, the United
States signed a [Critical Minerals Agreement]{.underline} with Norway,
demonstrating both countries' commitment to working together [to ensure
energy security]{.underline}.^31)^ Another such opportunity for the U.S.
to further support its Nordic Allies exists in Sweden. In 2024 the
Swedish mining company LKAP discovered Europe's largest deposit of rare
earth elements in the northern city of Kiruna, Sweden. Norway and Sweden
have already begun collaborating to increase energy security through
[the [Norwegian company]{.mark}, REETec, which has [developed technology
to separate rare earth metals]{.mark} that [competes with China's
production]{.mark} of these materials.]{.underline}^32)^ According to
the CEO of LKAB, Jan Moström, this cooperation provides the foundation
[to develop a "strong and sustainable Nordic value chain for rare earth
metals."^33)^ A proactive U.S. Arctic Strategy that takes into
consideration [increase]{.mark}d [NATO energy security]{.mark} through
Nordic investment further bolsters the United States' ability to
decrease dependence on China and should be pursued.]{.underline}

Increased cooperation between the United States and its Nordic NATO
Allies [provides an opportunity for the U.S. to couple a new proactive
Arctic Strategy with tangible training goals for forces at the tactical
and operational levels.]{.underline} For example, U.S. forces and their
Norwegian counterparts have benefited from a [mutually supportive
military alliance for decades.]{.underline} During the Cold War, [Norway
was a critical U.S. ally [for power projection, defense, and
deterrence]{.mark} in the north. Its geostrategic location was [optimal
for protecting]{.mark} NATO's [northern flank from Soviet
aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} so much so that [the United States
stockpiled weapons, vehicles, and ammunition in strategic locations
across Norway]{.underline}.^34)^ These stockpiles were crucial for
increasing U.S. power projection and [[enhancing NATO's operational
responsiveness]{.mark} in the European arena.]{.underline}
Additionally[, Norway's proximity to the Soviet Union and the adjacent
Norwegian and Barents Seas allowed NATO to challenge the Soviets'
ability to deploy nuclear-powered submarines if the Cold War turned
hot.]{.underline}

The U.S.--Norwegian Alliance has only grown since the end of the Cold
War. In 2017, the United States Marine Corps began sending a battalion
of Marines to Northern Norway as part of a rotational deployment. The
United States Marine Corps continues to deploy thousands of forces to
train alongside its Norwegian Allies annually. Moreover, in 2018, Norway
hosted Exercise Trident Juncture, [a NATO-led military exercise based on
a fictitious Article 5 collective defense scenario.]{.underline} It was
the largest exercise of its kind in Norway since the 1980s, and 31
nations participated.^35)^ [[Large-scale multinational exercises]{.mark}
of this kind increase [force proficiency operating in Arctic
environments]{.mark} and [enhance]{.mark} NATO member states' [ability
to work with each other]{.mark} in wartime.]{.underline}

The United States has been increasing its ability [to work with its
Swedish and Finnish counterparts in the case of war.]{.underline} The
United States [should [establish bilateral training exercises]{.mark}
with Sweden and Finland in order to give these new NATO nations a
greater understanding of how to operate in a NATO
construct.]{.underline} Conversely, cooperation with allies and partners
[improves U.S. forces' understanding of how to operate effectively in an
Arctic environment,]{.underline} making it a more reliable and efficient
partner for Arctic allies. This operational experience [[ensures]{.mark}
that allied forces are [familiar with strategic terrain]{.mark} that may
be [leveraged during a conflict]{.mark} with Russia.]{.underline}

Conclusion: How a Proactive Arctic Strategy Supports America's Focus on
the Indo-Pacific

The United States publication of the 2024 Arctic Strategy provides a
transparent approach aimed at reducing the possibility of escalation in
the Arctic. Moreover, the current strategy recognizes Russia's and
China's Arctic ambitions and that the growing collaboration between
Russia and the PRC have "the potential to alter the Arctic's stability
and threat picture."^36)^ [The strategy presents a tangible and
realistic way forward for the U.S. to [enhance the Joint Force's Arctic
capabilities]{.mark}, engage with Allies and partners, and [demonstrate
an ability]{.mark} to work together across defense forces.]{.underline}
Although the strategy indicates increased U.S. involvement in the
Arctic, it remains reactive. The 2024 Arctic Strategy already outlines a
tangible way for the United [States to commit energy and resources to
the region]{.underline}. Although a deliberate shift in messaging will
not change the U.S. footprint in the Arctic, it will change the U.S.
mindset towards the region. By making the Arctic a priority, [the U.S.
[demonstrates its commitment to supporting its Allies]{.mark} in the
event that Russia or China attacks.]{.underline}

Furthermore, by shifting to a proactive Arctic Strategy, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is not abandoning]{.mark} its [focus on
the Indo-Pacific,]{.mark} because [the PRC envisions itself as a polar
power]{.mark} and intends to reshape the international system in its
favor. [Future conflict]{.mark} with the PRC will [not]{.mark} be
geographically [constrained to the Indo-Pacific.]{.mark}]{.underline} By
shifting to a proactive Arctic Strategy now, the United States [can
[deter China]{.mark} [from expanding its control over]{.mark} the Arctic
and its [critical resources]{.mark}. The future battlefield is melting
and only by taking actions today can the United States and its NATO
allies win tomorrow's war in the Arctic.]{.underline}

The great power competition unfolding in [[the Arctic is a]{.mark}
complex and dynamic [geopolitical chess game. China has emerged as a key
player]{.mark}]{.underline} alongside traditional Arctic powers,
specifically the United States and Russia. From China's perspective, the
Arctic is not merely a source of valuable resources or a region
experiencing dramatic environmental change; rather, it is [a crucial
theater for [asserting]{.mark} [its]{.mark} growing global
[influence,]{.mark} shaping the future of Arctic governance, and
managing the intricate web of relationships]{.underline} with other
major actors, thereby rendering the region as one of the New Strategic
Frontiers.

\[map omitted\]

China's Arctic policy is a [carefully calibrated [strategy that balances
its economi]{.mark}c needs, [security]{.mark} concerns, [and
ambition]{.mark} for global recognition and leadership.]{.underline}
Despite being geographically distant from the Arctic Circle, China has
[[declared itself a "near-Arctic state."]{.mark}]{.underline} This
claim, although met
with[ skepticism](https://2017-2021.state.gov/looking-north-sharpening-americas-arctic-focus/) by
former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, serves a crucial purpose: it
legitimizes China's involvement in Arctic affairs. China argues that
[the cascading effects of climate change in the Arctic---particularly
the accelerating melting of ice and the rising global sea levels---have
far-reaching consequences.]{.underline} Even distant nations like China,
where major coastal cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin face the threat
of being potentially submerged, are impacted. By [[positioning itself as
a]{.mark} responsible [stakeholder]{.mark} with a vested
interest]{.underline} in the region's stability, sustainable
development, and climate change mitigation, China justifies its
expanding presence in Arctic affairs. Thus, it advocates for broader
international participation and a more inclusive approach to Arctic
governance, allowing it to engage in discussions without appearing as an
outsider or opportunist. However, in doing so, [[China]{.mark} subtly
[challenges the existing governance framework]{.mark}, controlled mainly
[by the Arctic Council]{.mark} and its member states.]{.underline}

The Arctic Council is a highly effective international forum composed of
the eight states located above the Arctic Circle: the U.S.A., Russia,
Canada, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, and Sweden. In addition to
these member states, the Arctic Council includes observer states and
representatives of indigenous peoples in the Arctic. Five of these
states--- the U.S.A., Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark---are littoral
members of the Arctic Ocean and are thus referred to as the A5. One of
these states, Russia, comprises 53% of the Arctic and is notably
different from the other Arctic Council members. Consequently, the
remaining seven Arctic Council members are collectively known as the A7.

Despite the differences between Russia and the A7, the Arctic Council
was historically one of the more effective international forums,
operating on consensus and explicitly barring discussions of military
affairs. However, the longstanding principle of "high latitude, low
tensions" came to an end in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. In
response, the A7 decided that under such circumstances, business as
usual could not continue, and effectively suspended Russia from the
council.

[[A key aspect]{.mark} of the great power rivalry in the region is [the
competition for access to]{.mark} the Arctic's abundant [natural
resources]{.mark}. According to the ]{.underline}[[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [Geological
Survey]{.mark}](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2008/3049/)[[,]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} is believed to [hold vast,]{.mark} largely untapped
[reserves of oil, natural gas, and critical minerals]{.mark} such as
[rare earth elements]{.mark}, titanium, and lithium]{.underline}. As
climate change melts the Arctic ice, these resources are becoming
increasingly accessible. [[Given]{.mark} its rapidly growing economy and
[voracious demand for energy and raw materials, China]{.mark}
[views]{.mark} securing access to these [resources as a]{.mark}
strategic [imperative.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Although China and Russia have formed a pragmatic partnership in the
Arctic---partly driven by shared concerns about US global
dominance---their ambitions could eventually clash. Despite challenges
from Western sanctions and geopolitical pressures, [China remains
committed to securing access to Arctic resources. Its [involvement in
large-scale projects]{.mark} like the ]{.underline}[Yamal LNG
project](https://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/csr2014enhms/201807/771c0549950f4420ad6de3972fe27073/files/88c8e515fb734e6984ef3599ab2255c2.pdf)[,
which extracts and then liquefies gas from Russia's Arctic Yamal
Peninsula,]{.underline} underscores its determination to become an
Arctic player. However, projects like [LNG
2](https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/china-acquires-20-percent-stake-novateks-latest-arctic-lng-project),
which takes gas from a Russian Arctic area adjacent to the Yamal
Peninsula, have been stalled due to Western sanctions. Nonetheless,
[China seems determined to help LNG 2
proceed ]{.underline}[covertly](https://gcaptain.com/final-chinese-module-arrives-at-russian-arctic-lng-2-plant-as-u-s-snoozes-on-sanctions-action/)[.]{.underline}

[China's approach to securing resources is often [marked by a long-term
perspective]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is willing to invest in projects
that may not yield immediate returns but [are [crucial for future
resource access]{.mark} and long-term energy security]{.underline}.
Another important element of the Arctic [competition [is **control over
critical infrastructure**]{.mark}. As sea ice retreats, [new shipping
routes]{.mark} like the Northern Sea Route (NSR) [are opening]{.mark},
transforming the region into a vital hub for maritime trade, potentially
depriving the Suez Canal.]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark} has [expressed]{.mark} a strong [interest in the
NSR]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} which offers a significantly shorter
route between Asia and Europe than the Suez Canal. The NSR is [a key
component [of]{.mark} China's ambitious [Polar Silk
Road]{.mark}]{.underline}, which seeks to connect Asia and Europe while
strengthening global trade. [Gaining influence over this crucial
shipping route would provide substantial economic benefits and increase
China's geopolitical power.]{.underline} To secure its position in the
Arctic, [China has [proposed investments in Arctic and near-Arctic port
facilities]{.mark}]{.underline} like [Arkhangelsk,
Russia](https://www.portseurope.com/arkhangelsk-port-as-chinas-cargo-transport-hub/),
as well as transportation infrastructure such as Russia's [Arctic
Express](https://splash247.com/china-and-russia-form-arctic-express-route/) No.
1,
and [nuclear ](https://jamestown.org/program/moscows-cutback-on-icebreaker-construction-opens-door-for-china-in-the-north/)and [non-nuclear ](https://news.usni.org/2024/09/03/chinese-icebreaker-mission-to-arctic-clear-signal-of-beijings-polar-ambitions-says-expert)icebreaker
technology. While these projects face scrutiny and resistance from some
Arctic states, they [underscore China's [strategic intent to establish a
foothold]{.mark} in this emerging maritime corridor and could also
enable it to [project naval power]{.mark} in the Arctic [while
securing]{.mark} vital [trade routes.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The competition for influence in the Arctic also involves international
partnerships. China's approach often emphasizes economic incentives,
offering attractive investment opportunities to Arctic states, such as
its attempts to [develop
railroads ](https://www.reuters.com/article/arctic-railways/finland-norway-rail-link-planned-to-fit-arctic-sea-routes-idUSL5N22L2ZA)in
the Scandinavian Arctic. China's efforts, however, have met resistance,
especially from Arctic states closely aligned with the United States and
wary of China's growing assertiveness. The Nordic states---particularly
Sweden and Norway---have been at the forefront of this pushback. The
United States has sought to limit China's influence in the Arctic,
pressuring allies to reject Chinese investments such as its attempts
to [mine ](https://kinacentrum.se/en/publications/china-already-left-so-what-is-trumps-greenland-gambit-about/)in
Greenland and implicitly encouraging them to voice concerns about
China's intentions, as seen in the case of Chinese investment in the
Kirkenes Port.

As the Arctic's strategic importance grows, competition for partnerships
will likely intensify and competition for its resources and influence
will escalate. Greenland, for
example, [denied ](https://www.reuters.com/article/business/china-withdraws-bid-for-greenland-airport-projects-sermitsiaq-newspaper-idUSKCN1T5190/)China's
request to modernize its airport infrastructure, ultimately turning to
Denmark instead. This competition has occasionally created headlines,
such as when President Trump expressed
his [desire ](https://agmetalminer.com/2025/01/21/trumps-push-for-greenland-rare-earths/)to
annex Greenland, indicative of the great power competition in the
Arctic; [Greenland's numerous rare earth elements are vital for American
national security.]{.underline}

The great power competition in the Arctic also extends into science and
technology. China expresses its commitment to scientific research in
numerous ways, including [substantial investments in its icebreaker
fleet, which
already ]{.underline}[surpasses ](https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/09/03/arctic-nato-russia-us-china-icebreakers/)[that
of the United States in number, and could challenge Russia's icebreaker
monopoly]{.underline} along the NSR. Chinese research vessel
expeditions---including those that have conducted research off the US
coast to explore the potential of deep-sea mining---demonstrate its
interest in Arctic exploration. [China's Arctic [research
facilities]{.mark} in Norway, Iceland, and Sweden also [reflect
its]{.mark} commitment to expand its [scientific
presence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Although ostensibly focused on climate change and other useful science,
China's scientific research activities may also have military
applications. The [vast [data gathered by Chinese]{.mark} research
[vessels,]{.mark} monitoring [stations, and underwater sensors]{.mark}
can [improve navigation]{.mark} in ice-covered Arctic
waters, ]{.underline}[[track submarine]{.mark}
movements](https://www.eurasiantimes.com/china-to-deploy-listening-devices-in-the-arctic-ocean-to/)[,
and [develop advanced radar systems]{.mark} that can track objects at
long distances.]{.underline} This dual-use nature of scientific research
underscores the interconnectedness of China's Arctic [economic,
strategic, and scientific interests---an approach rooted in
civil-military fusion]{.underline}. The fact that some Arctic research
programs are run by groups affiliated with
the [PLA ](https://features.csis.org/hiddenreach/china-polar-research-facility/)further
proves the dual-use nature of their research. China's research also
[provides [valuable information]{.mark} about the Arctic's ecosystem,
resource potential, and environmental changes, all critical [for safely
navigating]{.mark} its [waters and exploiting]{.mark} its
[resources.]{.mark}]{.underline} Furthermore, Chinese [scientific work
in ]{.underline}[Norway ](https://thewatch-journal.com/2024/09/12/prc-expands-arctic-presence-with-dual-use-research/)[on
the ionosphere could [improve missile detection capabilities]{.mark},
while its research on sea salinity sampling could also help [enhance
submarine stealth operations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Arctic Council, the primary forum for Arctic governance and
cooperation, faces increasing challenges in maintaining its relevance
and effectiveness as geopolitical tensions rise. Russia's suspension
from the Council and its subsequent response---cutting off
funding---illustrates this complexity. These evolving dynamics will not
only affect the fate of the Arctic's resources, environment, and
indigenous cultures but will also have broader geopolitical
implications. The future of the great power competition in the Arctic
thus remains uncertain.

[While NATO and Russia have traditionally dominated the region, China's
rapid economic growth, expanding military capabilities, and increasing
assertiveness have made it a significant force in the
Arctic.]{.underline} The evolving interaction between these powers will
shape the Arctic's future as each seeks to maximize influence, secure
strategic and economic interests, and advance its regional vision. From
China's perspective[, it is a rising global power with legitimate and
growing interests in the Arctic]{.underline}. It is determined to play a
prominent role in shaping the region's future and contributing to a new,
multipolar world order where China plays a leading role. The competition
in the Arctic between China and the United States has already begun, but
it will likely accelerate once the Northern Sea Route picks up in the
next decade.

#### An Arctic Command would deter military aggression and establish control over flow of resources 

**Motolla 23** \[Lee; January 17; author at the Arctic Institute;
"**N**ATO\'s Arctic Command: A Case for the Expansion of NATO's Mission
in the High North," The Arctic Institute,

//AChiong

The Arctic as we know it is changing at an unanticipated pace. In all
but the most optimistic outlooks, the geophysical state of the world's
most northern region will be irrevocably altered within the next
century. With rapid change comes incredible opportunity and risk for
countries interested in the region. [By forming a new command, [NATO's
Arctic Command (ARCCOM)]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} with the purpose
of fostering discussion and deterrence in the High North, [NATO can
[demonstrate its commitment to]{.mark} ensuring [the region]{.mark} does
not become a flashpoint for international conflict.]{.underline} This
command would be structured in similar fashion to other tactical
commands such as MARCOM, to concentrate the particular expertise,
technology and strategy necessary to operate in this singular threat
environment. In this manner, [NATO will be able to [safeguard the
security of its northern borders]{.mark} and deter the expansion of
future conflict into the Arctic.]{.underline}

The North Pole of the future

The radical geophysical alterations that will critically alter the
security landscape in the Arctic are a strong impetus for NATO to
increase its involvement in the region. [The most drastic change to the
High North will be the disappearance of the polar ice cap]{.underline}.
Satellite observations from NASA determined that [[sea-ice]{.mark}
extent [is regressing at \~13% per]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[decade]{.mark}.]{.underline}^1)^ The IPCC concluded that in all
scenarios sea-ice will decrease at this rapid pace, and in extreme
cases, they think it is likely the Arctic will be reliably ice free by
2050, while more optimistic scenarios give it until 2070.^2)^ Regional
sea-level rise is likely to be between 0.3-0.4m, and combined with
permafrost melt, could threaten huge swathes of the arctic
coastline.^3)^ Because of the significant investment of time and capital
into the establishment of ARCCOM, it would be prudent for NATO to invest
in the most extreme scenario.

NATO's northern competitors

[NATO's most important competitors from a security standpoint are
undoubtedly the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of
China.]{.underline} Russia's polar territories have become a national
focus under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin. Though polar
development has been a longtime endeavor for Russia, Putin's 2035 Arctic
Strategy refocusses the nations efforts to exploit vast northern riches
that are becoming more accessible.^4)^ [[Through]{.mark} the development
of [the]{.mark} Northern Sea Route ([NSR),]{.mark} improvement of
[regional infrastructure]{.mark} [and]{.mark} expansion of business
[opportunities, Russia]{.mark} has [stated]{.mark} its [intention to
remain a]{.mark} pivotal [power]{.mark} in the Arctic
region.]{.underline}

[A lack of Arctic territory has not hindered China from expressing
interest]{.underline} in extending its growing influence into the High
North. [Beginning with a 2018 declaration wherein the People's Republic
of China identified itself as the "near-Arctic power",^5)^ while
designating the polar region for considerable investment. [Russia
appears a potential partner for Chinese]{.mark} regional
[ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline} as their individual attempts in
Greenland were relatively ineffective because of US
intervention.^6)^ Working together, they represent a powerful bloc
[challenging the stable cooperative order NATO should seek to protect in
the High North.]{.underline}

Geopolitical flashpoints

As the Arctic changes physically, so will the strategic calculations of
the powers interested in the region. Before Russia's invasion of Ukraine
earlier this year, [the [potential economic booms]{.mark} were by far
[the largest draw to the region]{.mark}. There are a few critical
sectors that are receiving attention for near-future development:
[shipping and transport, and resource extraction]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This, alongside the more overt concerns of Russian aggression[,
significantly [increases potential securitization]{.mark} of the polar
region as Russia, China, and NATO attempt to safeguard their national
interests.]{.underline}

For the last decade, [the potential for creating reliable alternative
shipping lanes]{.underline} between Europe and Northern Asia has been
thoroughly investigated by economists and researchers. The
aforementioned [NSR,]{.underline} which traverses the general area of
the Russian-controlled Eurasian Coastline, [has garnered much attention
because it is significantly shorter when compared to traditional voyages
between northern ports that must traverse the Suez Canal.]{.underline}
Since 2007, cargo ships have plied variations of this northern route
with increasing ease and seasonal length, however the inconsistency of
ice melt and other navigational challenges has lead some researchers to
posit that the economic primacy of this path is not set in stone, or in
this case ice.^7)^

[[If]{.mark} the [NSR becomes]{.mark} a [vital]{.mark} link in global
shipping, [Russia's]{.mark} near complete [control of the route]{.mark}
would [hand them an economic and diplomatic lever]{.mark} with which to
extend their regional influence.]{.underline} To ensure this, the
Russian Northern Fleet has stepped up its surface and underwater
monitoring of the route.^8)^ It is not difficult to imagine Russia
exploiting global transport through this route. [Russia has not shied
away from using its gas exports to Europe as an economic weapon in past
and current conflicts,^9)^ a vital global trade route would likely be no
different.]{.underline}

[While shipping and transportation routes are a major potential economic
benefit in the mid-future, the [extraction of hydrocarbon and mineral
resources]{.mark} from the Arctic [remains]{.mark} perhaps [the most
lucrative opportunity in the near-term]{.mark}]{.underline}. Critical
for the geopolitical balance of the region, a majority of these
resources are thought to be located in Russia's Siberian territory.
Russia's "Strategy for Developing the Russian Arctic Zone and Ensuring
National Security through 2035" plan devotes major attention to this
area because of its massive strategic import; "the Arctic accounts for
more than 90 percent of Russia's natural gas production and 17 percent
of its oil."^10)^ [The [North Pole]{.mark} also [contains sizable
concentrations of rare-earth and other critical minerals]{.mark} for
modern production, such as phosphate, bauxite, iron ore, nickel,
palladium, and vanadium.]{.underline} Some western estimates think "the
total value of mineral resources in Russia's North [[exceeds 22.4
trillion US-Dollars]{.mark}",]{.underline} all but ensuring its vital
relevance to Russian national security in the future.^11)^

NATO's interest in the Arctic

Because [NATO operates through consensus]{.underline}, advancing
priorities for the benefit of the entire organisation can be scuppered
by individual nations lacking the knowledge or interest in particular
regions. While such divisions occasionally slow the coordination of
NATO, [there is no question that the [future of the Arctic is a
priority]{.mark} for its member states.]{.underline} The alliance has
directed increasing attention to the North Pole with joint military
exercises such as Trident Juncture in 2018 and a Norwegian-sponsored
operation in 2022, Cold Response. The addition of Sweden and Finland
will only bolster the resources NATO has to dedicate to the Arctic
issue. [However, escalating [exercises is not enough]{.mark} to
demonstrate the importance of the Arctic to NATO.]{.underline}

Danoy and Maddox, authors of a recent article compiled for NATOs 20/2020
review, discuss further expansion of the NATO footprint in the
Arctic.^12)^ In their opinion, for NATO to contend with the enlargement
of Russian and Chinese influence resulting from the changing climate, it
must build political consensus on Arctic policy, enhance domain
awareness, ensure allies can operate effectively, and maintain stability
through discussion and, if necessary, deterrence.^13)^ Without a doubt,
"Finland and Sweden together would vastly expand the alliance's presence
in the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Circle.^14)^ [Establishing [a new
command]{.mark} to coordinate these efforts [would send a strong
signal]{.mark} that NATO is seriously invested in the future of the High
North.]{.underline}

With additional uncertainty surrounding energy security during the
ongoing shift to renewable energy, NATO must acknowledge that Russia,
and to a lesser extent China, will continue to increase its focus in the
securitization of strategic energy reserves. Russia first used the
threat of oil shipments to Europe as a diplomatic tool during its
Crimean invasion^15)^ and because the energy sector remains a cut-out in
the current sanctions regime of Europe demonstrates the Russian power
projection it remains. NATO 2030, a recent analysis authored by a
Working Group assigned by Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg,
acknowledges that NATO must redouble its efforts to coordinate political
and military deterrence of such actions^16)^ and [[ARCCOM would be a
perfect vessel]{.mark} through which to do so in the High
North.]{.underline}

The other future priority of NATO outlined in "NATO 2030" that has
extreme relevance to future Arctic operations is climate and green
defence. All NATO members are likely to face serious security and
economic impacts from climate change, so of [prime concern is how it
will redefine "the intensity of geopolitical competition, freedom of
navigation in the High North]{.underline} and migration streams from the
south, all of which involve vital Allied interests."^17)^ The potential
outgrowths of these changes are likely to be felt throughout the
alliance.

The Working Group [exhorts NATO to "enhance its situational awareness
across the High North and the Arctic and... develop a strategy that
takes into account [broader deterrence and defence]{.mark}
plans."]{.underline}^18)^ ARCCOM represents a solution to address these
goals in the near future while establishing NATO as an irrevocable polar
power to balance possible Russian aggression.

Importance of Arctic focus

[The Arctic represents a dynamic arena for geopolitics because of its
susceptibility to climate change.]{.underline} Foremost amongst those
ready to capitalize on this change is Russia, which is considering
critical infrastructure and security measures to ensure continued
regional dominance.^19)^ Alongside this already present actor [lies
[China's long standing ambition]{.mark} to be recognized as a
circumpolar power]{.underline}, evidenced by their declaration as a
"near-Arctic state" in 2018.^20)^ [Russia's 2022 invasion of eastern
[Ukraine is a significant flashpoint]{.mark} for the region, elevating
tensions already growing at a slow albeit steady rate since the Crimean
invasion]{.underline} in 2014. In light of this action, countries
sharing borders with Russia are right to be more concerned for their own
territorial integrity. In an Arctic region where many borders have only
recently been determined, [[the desire to extend]{.mark} one's
[influence]{.mark} to areas of particular interest through economic
coercion or physical force may [become]{.mark} quite [tempting,]{.mark}
especially [if there is a perceived lack of deterrence]{.mark} against
such action.]{.underline}

[With the billions of infrastructure and economic investment to advance
Russia's northern territory]{.underline} comes Putin's predilection to
protect what is in effect a newly vulnerable external border from
outside aggressors. To ensure the safety of both its territorial
boundaries and economic interests, [[Russia has been
reactivating]{.mark} Soviet-era [bases and constructing new
ones]{.mark}.]{.underline} This includes "ten search and rescue bases,
sixteen deepwater ports, ten new air bases...and ten air defence
installations."^21)^ Though Russia has indicated that many of these
installations have cooperative purposes, like polar S&R, [[provocative
actions such as]{.mark} mock [aerial assault]{.mark} on radar
installations in Norway, [GPS signal-jamming]{.mark} in Finland, and
[increased submarine patrols intimate a]{.mark} far more [aggressive
stance.]{.mark}]{.underline}[^22)^]{.mark}

\[map omitted\]

Alongside Russia, [China wishes to advance its maritime power and
economic influence through the founding of a "polar silk
road]{.underline}," an addendum to the Belt and Road Initiative. The
prime concern driving this is the desire to [decouple yet more of
China's vast economic power from what it perceives as outside
interference by the United States]{.underline}, manifested by US control
of important geopolitical chokepoints of global shipping like the
Straits of Malacca and Gibraltar.^23)^ [The NSR,]{.underline} under the
control of an increasingly agreeable Russia, would not only impart its
already described economic benefits but [would also be a strong step in
asserting Chinese maritime independence and accelerate their rise as a
"great]{.underline} [maritime power]{.underline}."^24)^ Continuing
Sino-Russo cooperation on economic and strategic factors is a serious
reason for NATO to redouble its efforts and attention in the North
through ARCCOM[. If [NATO]{.mark} wishes to cement itself as a relevant
actor in polar security it [must demonstrate similar investments in
capabilities]{.mark} and attention through the founding of
ARCCOM.]{.underline}

NATO's Arctic Command

NATO's goals have already been discussed: to use discussion and
deterrence to moderate competition within this latent geopolitical
hotspot. Establishing ARCCOM is a strong potential solution to the
myriad security concerns and objectives which fall underneath this
objective. Since 2016, the United States has had a national strategy for
the Arctic which engages many of the same issues that ARCCOM will
tackle: evolving strategic capabilities, promoting international law and
freedom of the seas, and safeguarding US energy security.^25)^ Likewise,
the UK Ministry of Defense commissioned a report in 2019 to study the
security implications of climate change which highlighted the need for
collaborative decision making.^26)^ Other countries like Iceland and
Norway have also spurred increased NATO attention in the region by
hosting training exercises.

[So why should NATO address their goals in the Arctic with an entirely
new tactical command? Because [the nature of competition]{.mark} in the
High North [is so unique it]{.mark} will [require an individualized
focus.]{.mark}]{.underline} The "U.S. Coast Guard frequently notes that
[physical presence in the Arctic equals influence.]{.underline} Presence
can take the form of a heavy polar security cutter, a deep-water port, a
scientific observation center, a sustainable economic investment, or a
significant investment in a diplomatic outcome in a multilateral
negotiation format."^27)^ Therefore, [NATO should establish [a]{.mark}
dedicated [command]{.mark} to be the motive force of the alliance's
efforts to [advance discussion and deterrence]{.mark} in all things
Arctic, be they [diplomatic, informational, or military]{.mark},
allowing it to pursue all of these goals at once.^28)^]{.underline}

Foremost, the alliance should be [committed to finding diplomatic
solutions to the forthcoming security concerns. ARCCOM's role would be
that of [a central forum for]{.mark} alliance-wide discussion on [arctic
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Discussions led by ARCCOM would
focus on forging consensus *within* the alliance in order to present
diplomatic unity at other such summits. Its greatest potential in this
arena lies as a forum for alliance members to iron out the specifics of
NATO's Arctic policy.

This will be [significantly [bolstered by]{.mark} the [Arctic research
and expertise]{.mark} the command should seek to
proliferate.]{.underline} As LANDCOM, AIRCOM, and MARCOM are the
preeminent authorities on the alliance's traditional capabilities, so
should ARCCOM become the preeminent authority relevant to NATO
operations in the Arctic. [One of [NATO's greatest assets]{.mark} is
[the range of talent and ideas]{.mark} within the diverse composition of
its member states. Combining the [regional knowledge of long-standing
arctic countries]{.mark} like Norway, Iceland, Finland, and Sweden,
[with]{.mark} the [technical expertise of countries]{.mark} [such as
Italy]{.mark}, a major [producer of cold-weather
equipment]{.mark},^29)^ would [provide multifaceted]{.mark} novel
[approaches]{.mark} to the challenges arising in the rapidly changing
region.]{.underline}

ARCCOM should seek to emulate the major successes the alliance has had
in establishing similar centres of expertise on areas of emerging
security concerns by supporting an Arctic Working Group. A model to
consider is the Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE)
in Tallinn, Estonia. Since its establishment, CCDCOE has grown in
prestige and hosts annual training for alliance members with the goal of
sharing and expanding knowledge of the fifth domain of warfare. In its
role as the premier body for arctic security concerns, [ARCCOM's mission
would be bolstered by a similar expansion and distribution of expertise
in various aspects of the Polar region and therefore support a
specialised Arctic Working Group.]{.underline}

Both of the political and informational aspects of ARCCOM are meant to
be mutually reinforcing to its kinetic security mission. [Certainly, the
unique nature of conflict within the High North merits its own expert
coordinating command.]{.underline} History is well situated with
examples of military campaigns reduced to failure because of improper
knowledge and [[preparation for cold-weather warfare,]{.mark} victims of
the great "General Winter."]{.underline}

Traditional military tactics, logistics, and equipment will likely be
unsuited to the challenges of combat in the High North. Much of [NATO's
land f[orces would require special modification and training]{.mark} to
operate in the region]{.underline} if they intend to maintain the
flexibility and rapid response abilities that make them so potent.
Alternatively, [new investment could be made to [develop additional
cold-weather combat platforms]{.mark} specifically for this
arena.]{.underline} Likewise, the issue of polar seas would restrict the
usage of traditional naval forces that have come to characterise NATO's
global reach. [From unpredictable [sea ice movements]{.mark}, to topside
[icing and combat system degradation]{.mark}, much of [NATO's
current]{.mark} naval [assets are unprepared]{.mark} for extended combat
in polar conditions]{.underline}. While the US is developing two
specially designed icebreakers for the Coast Guard and its
search-and-rescue efforts in the Arctic, they are unlikely to enter
service until 2023.^30)^ [In the meantime, naval assets sent to the
Arctic would benefit from a specialized command dedicated to
understanding this specific theatre of combat and the impacts it will
have on naval force projection]{.underline}. While air power projection
may be the least affected by the polar theatre, maintenance of air bases
and infrastructure could become an issue should weather patterns become
more erratic and permafrost melt erodes the foundations of bases. The
invasion of Ukraine has certainly heightened NATO's attention to the
Arctic and the alliance has recently announced publicly a desire to
invest in an Arctic Command similar to what has been proposed
here.^31)^ [If [NATO]{.mark} hopes to be a significant polar presence,
to be able to support its diplomatic and informational efforts with the
deterrence of capable kinetic forces, it [must]{.mark} consider
[creat]{.mark}ing [ARCCOM,]{.mark} or as a command to coordinate these
efforts.]{.underline}

Conclusion

While NATO's current arctic capabilities are considerable because of its
individual member's contributions, [it [can only stand to gain through
increased cooperation and coordination]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
establishment of ARCCOM can achieve many of the alliance's regional
goals in a single stroke while capitalizing on renewed support from its
members following the invasion of Ukraine. The "NATO 2030" report
stated, "[It is paramount for NATO to have an accurate understanding of
the threat environment and of the intentions, capabilities and
operations of its potential competitors, including Russia and
China]{.underline}. ... The Group encourages NATO to focus on measures
that will strengthen all domain awareness, conduct extended cold-weather
operations among interested Allies and share a common Arctic operating
picture."^32)^ To achieve these multiple goals, the alliance will
benefit from a polar presence emboldened by a powerful, new command
focused specifically on NATO's priorities in the Arctic, ARCCOM.

despite its complete lack of territory in the Arctic Circle.

[But is [the Arctic destined to be the most likely flashpoint for a
nuclear war]{.mark}? Let's look at the possibilities.]{.underline}

[[Despite being]{.mark} so [cold, the Arctic is no stranger to military
conflict]{.mark}, holding major strategic value and serving as a
passageway to both the Atlantic and Pacific]{.underline}. During World
War II, the Battle of the Atlantic extended into the Arctic and ships
carrying American war supplies to the Soviet Union traversed the
Northern Sea Route. Germany invaded Norway, and the Soviet Union invaded
Finland in the Winter War of 1940. As the Cold War evolved, the Arctic
became a major theater for submarine activity.

Today, President Trump's insistence on acquiring Greenland ["one way or
the
other"](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/trump-says-the-us-will-take-greenland-one-way-or-the-other.html) highlights
the growing importance of the Arctic to the security interests of the
United States. Greenland's geographic location, combined with the U.S.'
operation of Pituffik Space Base in the high north, provides
key ["missile warning, missile defense, and space
surveillance"](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5341505/greenland-pituffik-space-military-base) capabilities.
[The [shortest flight paths for nuclear missiles between the U.S. and
Russia]{.mark} exist [over the Arctic Ocean]{.mark}, and the loss of
this base on account of a diplomatic blunder could open [a key blind
spot in America's]{.mark} strategic [defense.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Alternatively, the loss of this base to a Russian attack aimed at
disabling American missile detection infrastructure is unlikely due to
the danger of immediate retaliation and escalation.

Currently, [the [most likely path to a potential nuclear
exchange]{.mark} in the Arctic would be [through a conventional or "gray
zone]{.mark}"]{.underline} Russian attack on a NATO member. [Border
[skirmishes]{.mark}, [cyber-]{.mark}attacks, airspace
[incursions,]{.mark} reckless [military intercepts]{.mark}, and support
to [separatist groups]{.mark}]{.underline} intentionally sit in the
"gray zone" between peace and outright war, but could ultimately [[lead
to open conflict that escalates to nuclear war]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Conceivably, [a [gray zone or overt attack]{.mark} on other Greelandic
infrastructure, or an ]{.underline}[[information operations
campaign]{.mark}](https://www.americansecurityproject.org/fact-sheet-russian-social-media-information-operations/)[ ]{.underline}aimed
at dividing the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, [are [not outside]{.mark}
of the realm of [possibility.]{.mark}]{.underline}

With NATO's addition of Sweden and, more importantly, Finland---which
shares a [1,343 km border with
Russia](https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2024/09/russia-finland-border-security?lang=en)---[there
is [increased opportunity]{.mark} that [a NATO Arctic state could be
attacked]{.mark}.]{.underline} Highlighting this risk, American forces
in Alaska recently staged a drill in which [hundreds of troops were
flown to
Finland](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/12/world/europe/prepping-for-war-with-russia-at-36-degrees-below-zero.html?rsrc=flt&smid=em-share) to
defend against a mock Russian invasion. Yet rather than an overt
invasion of a NATO member, [[Russia]{.mark} is far more likely [test the
waters]{.mark} by conducting provocative and destabilizing small-scale
gray zone activities]{.underline}. The disastrous results of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine have likely raised doubts in Moscow about its
ability to achieve its objectives in a direct attack on a nuclear armed
country, let alone a large NATO ally, making a direct attack unlikely.
[It is [not entirely clear where the red line]{.mark} on gray zone
activities would be for Finland or what [would trigger an Article
5]{.mark} collective [defense]{.mark} declaration short of a direct
attack across the border.]{.underline}

Though the threat of American nuclear weapons has long-served to deter a
Russian attack on the European NATO members, [President [Trump's]{.mark}

his willingness [to defend a NATO

about America's commitment.]{.underline} As a result, [France and the UK

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), which includes satellite

What China's Rare Earths Dominance Means for the US," Baker Institute,

Geopolitical Implications

[[U.S. dependence on China for REE]{.mark} and downstream rare earth
products [is]{.mark} especially [strong,]{.mark}]{.underline} as very
little REE mining and magnet production and none of the REE processing
is done in the U.S. [To mitigate China's stranglehold on the rare earth
industry, the U.S. industry and policymakers face the [challenge of
developing]{.mark} a [domestic rare earth]{.mark} ecosystem]{.underline}
--- from extraction to midstream processing to further downstream
manufacturing[. China currently is the only country in the world with a
fully integrated permanent magnet supply chain]{.underline}. In total,
Chinese production accounts for [approximately [58% of rare earth
mining]{.mark}, [89% of]{.mark} rare earth [separation,]{.mark} 90% of
metallization and 92% of NdFeB global
markets.]{.underline}[\[60\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn60)

Figure 6 and Figure 7 detail U.S. imports of various products along rare
earth permanent magnet value chains, with slight variance due to the
differing data collection methodologies between the U.N. Comtrade and
the United States Geological Survey. It is important to note that these
figures do not take into account rare earth products integrated directly
into goods further downstream before they are imported into the U.S. For
example, these figures do not account for rare earth magnets
manufactured in China and integrated into Chinese-made smart phones that
are then exported to the U.S. [Therefore, American commercial reliance
on Chinese rare earth products is likely significantly
understated.]{.underline}

\[figures omitted\]

Besides China, the U.S. imports REE from Estonia, France and Japan, but
these flows are misleading. In fact, Estonia procures its rare earth
feedstocks from Russia, while France and Japan are simply processing
links with no domestic mine production of their own, using feedstocks of
mixed sources including China and Russia. [Because U.S. allies in Europe
and Japan currently only possess downstream manufacturing capabilities
with no mining output, potential [supply disruptions from China]{.mark}
could [affect allied supplies]{.mark} of downstream rare earth
products.]{.underline}

Currently the only domestic producer is MP Materials from its Mountain
Pass facility in California (at the edge of the Mohave Desert), which
primarily supplies light REE, though there is a planned expansion into
heavy REE processing as well as metal conversion, alloying, and magnet
manufacturing in their new facility in Fort Worth,
Texas.[\[61\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn61) Mountain
Pass sends the 42,000 tonnes of REO contained in the concentrate it
produces to China for further processing due, in part, to the absence of
domestic customers. The company is actively upgrading processing assets
on-site as it moves to integrate further down the rare earths value
chain.[\[62\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn62) Additionally,
Noveon (formerly known as the Urban Mining Company), the only
operational U.S.-based permanent magnet manufacturer, produces a small
amount of NdFeB permanent magnets.

Besides MP Materials, there are other American enterprises working to
develop the domestic rare earth industry. The Texas Mineral Resources
Corporation (TMRC) is actively working to develop a rare earth project
at Round Top in South Texas, which looks to extract light and heavy REE
to be processed
on-site.[\[63\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn63) According
to the company's site, the project is still in extremely early stages,
as TMRC is still "focused on the exploration and development" of their
deposit.[\[64\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn64) Developing
domestic separation and other processing capabilities on-site
simultaneously cuts down logistical costs and will chip away at China's
current dominance of entire global rare earth value chains.

While [the second coming of the U.S. rare earth industry is still in its
early stages,]{.underline} this burgeoning activity is encouraging.
Still, [permitting challenges as well as scaling up to sizeable domestic
production and processing will take a good deal of time.]{.underline}
For the necessary industrial rare earth cluster to develop,
[[nodes]{.mark} all [along rare earth]{.mark} supply chains [must
develop simultaneously]{.mark}]{.underline}, so they can be pieced
together once fully operational. The current high prices of rare earths
are conducive to developing the rare earth industry. [However, in the
event of depressed prices, due either to typical price fluctuations or
to Chinese price manipulation, U.S. policymakers must look to other
means to encourage development.]{.underline}

[[Chinese officials are]{.mark} highly [conscious of the geopolitical
advantage they derive from]{.mark} their [REE]{.mark}
[dominance.]{.mark}]{.underline} The 2010 incident over REE shipments to
Japan was a wake-up call to import-dependent customers. Almost a decade
later in 2019, [[threats of restricted supply
returned]{.underline}]{.mark}.[\[65\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn65) Xi's
visit to a REE magnet production facility in Ganzhou in 2019 was widely
regarded as a sign that restricting REE supply is on the
table.[\[66\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn66) A
week later, the People's Daily posted an article explicitly threatening
that if "the U.S. side wants to use the products made by China's
exported rare earths to counter and suppress China's development," the
U.S. should not "underestimate the Chinese side's ability to safeguard
its development rights and
interests."[\[67\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn67) The
more recent MIIT draft controls list proposed in January 2021 also
suggests that international policy responses significantly influence
Chinese domestic policies toward rare
earths.[\[68\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn68) Officials
in Beijing are particularly focused on how quickly the U.S. would secure
alternatives if REE were included on the control list.

Therein lies a paradox: China's state-supported rare earth enterprises
remain at the behest of international market dynamics. Overburdening
policy changes and perceived supply insecurity would push buyers away
from Chinese suppliers. Any restrictive moves would likely spur
proactive value chain restructuring away from Chinese REE. Therefore,
Chinese officials would be unlikely to directly restrict trade for
political reasons and calls for such are primarily just sword rattling
to disguise domestic policies and production controls that bear a more
long-term effect on supply coming out of China.

[Considering the [recent flare-up]{.mark} in U.S.-China tensions [over
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, occurring against the backdrop of global
turmoil caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine[, it is important to note
that the current dynamics over rare earth trading would not hold in the
event of China's invasion of the island.]{.underline} Will Chinese rare
earth enterprises' responses resemble those of Russia's Gazprom in the
first half of 2022, a game of limbo to balance their own revenue with
geopolitical bridge-burning? Or will [[China]{.mark} act swiftly to [cut
off rare earth supplies to its adversaries given]{.mark} their
[end-use]{.mark} applications [for]{.mark} defense technologies that
maintain [U.S. military technological superiority]{.mark}]{.underline}?
How would these actions [[carry across to]{.mark} other alliances such
as the [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}tlantic [T]{.mark}reaty
[O]{.mark}rganization and member countries? China's deep economic
integration with the West suggests that any decisions to alter trade
will [carry heavy implications for all]{.mark} involved.]{.underline} As
a result, their response will be highly dependent on the level of
support, especially militarily, that the U.S. and its allies give to
Taiwan. In any case, [as Chinese officials continue to consolidate the
major rare earth SOEs, they [gain greater]{.mark} control over the
industry and more [leverage]{.mark} in their ever-evolving power plays
with the West.]{.underline}

The U.S. Policy Response

Key government initiatives in the U.S. are worth highlighting for their
focus on developing domestic rare earth capabilities. Only relatively
recently did U.S. policymakers start to pay attention to the
intersection between geopolitics and market dynamics in the REE industry
--- primarily starting during the Trump era. In July 2019, then
President Trump made a series of presidential determinations (PDs) under
Section 303 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA) that domestic
production, separation and manufacturing of rare earths is "essential to
the national defense" of the United
States.[\[69\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn69) These
designations freed up funding from the Department of Defense (DOD) to
pursue increased production. On February 24, 2021, President Biden
signed Executive Order 14017 on Securing America's Supply Chains, which
requires the secretary of defense to submit a report identifying risks
in critical minerals supply chains, including REE, and policy
recommendations to address these
risks.[\[70\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn70)

Title III of the DPA, which is dedicated to ensuring the timely
availability of essential domestic industrial resources, can help
buttress domestic rare earth industrial
development.[\[71\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn71) Funding
from the DPA is essential to sustaining capital flows to highly
intensive rare earth extraction and processing projects. In addition,
support from the DPA is seen as [a signal of legitimacy for projects and
companies, from a security and business standpoint, which can spur
supplemental investment]{.underline}.

Pursuant to the PDs on rare earth permanent magnet supply chains, the
DPA Title III program has issued several awards. Under the PD covering
light rare earth separation, the DOD awarded Australia's Lynas Corp an
investment worth \$30 million in February 2021 to establish U.S.-based
processing capabilities for light
REM.[\[72\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn72) The
facility will be located in Hondo, Texas, as part of partnership with
San Antonio's Blue Line Corporation. The DOD also awarded \$10 million
to MP Materials to upgrade their on-site rare earth separation assets
and a \$35 million contract to MP Materials Corp in February 2022 to
design and build a heavy REM processing facility in Mountain Pass. This
falls under the PD covering medium and heavy rare earth separation and
processing, with the end goal of producing permanent magnets
domestically.[\[73\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn73) Additionally,
the DOD granted \$30 million to Noveon to expand NdFeB magnet
production, under the PD for NdFeB production. The DPA has not yet made
awards to address the remaining PDs on rare earth metal reduction and
alloy processing, or on samarium-cobalt rare earth permanent magnet
production.

While these steps are encouraging, [many investments are in extremely
early stages, and it will likely take several years to deliver products
to markets with an unspecified projected demand.]{.underline} With these
actions in mind, during the recently concluded Section 232 investigation
on the "Effect of Imports of NdFeB Permanent Magnets on the National
Security," the Department of Commerce found that current capacity
development may satisfy 51% of domestic direct NdFeB demand, under
current projections that are set to increase, due primarily to
alternative energy applications such as wind power and battery electric
powertrains, which make intensive use of permanent magnets. Moreover, it
remains to be seen whether REE production outside of China can compete
with their unparalleled low-cost
structure.[\[74\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn74) We
note that the issue of cost to "reshore" or "friend-shore" critical raw
materials and components, as represented by the Lynas procurement,
represents an enormous uncertainty in outlooks, ultimately affecting the
affordability of many technologies and products deemed essential for
energy applications and defense systems well into the future.

The 117th Congress is also focusing on developing domestic rare earths.
The CHIPS (Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) and
Science Act of 2022 and the Inflation Reduction Act, passed in late July
and early August 2022, respectively, include provisions designed to
better commercialize American rare earths. Legislative highlights
include tax refunds on production costs, increased funding authority for
R&D grants and further increases to DPA funding.

For the U.S. to secure a sustainable rare earth supply chain, rare earth
processing and manufacturing technologies must be commercially viable.
Herein lies the U.S. government's main role: mitigating China's
non-market approach that is causing U.S. and allied rare earth
industries to hollow out in favor of subsidized and incentivized
operations in China. This requires a meticulous approach, utilizing
public funding as a jumping-off point for a rebounding domestic rare
earth industry rather than a long-term funding scheme that more closely
resembles the Chinese command-economic approach. Funding opportunities
like the recent DOE-directed grant for rare earth processing from
industrial by-products, which holds little commercial potential, should
not be regarded as viable industrial strategies for the industry as a
whole.[\[75\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn75) While
it is worthwhile to explore various avenues to secure a domestic rare
earth value chain, more funding should be directed toward advanced novel
capabilities that do not play into the Chinese industrial stronghold,
given the latter's dominance of legacy technologies.

In the quest to compete with Chinese rare earth producers' low-cost
structures, a slippery slope will likely emerge in cost-cutting efforts.
These same dynamics contributed to the Mountain Pass mine's closure in
2002 due to a tailings pipeline discharge of thorium under the
supervision of the previous owner, Molycorp Minerals,
LLC.[\[76\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn76) Where
regulatory ambiguities and logistical loopholes exist to circumvent
higher-cost sustainable resource management, domestic miners must
consider the long-term consequences of these decisions, which can easily
ruin promising projects while endangering the surrounding communities
and environment in the process.

While long-term supply resilience is a goal, "industrial planners" must
proactively mitigate the risks of immediate rare earth product supply
disruptions from China. [Manufacturers and designers may opt to use REE
substitutes, but [substitutes do not perform]{.mark} nearly as
[well.]{.mark}]{.underline}[\[77\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn77) Designers
looking to shift away from China-dominated REE may face the task of
engineering their products without these materials as the more viable
alternative. [[Recycling]{.mark} offers possibilities, especially from
permanent magnets, but [a long path lies ahead]{.mark} for this to
become viable.]{.underline} Recycling too often is overstated given the
outlook for raw materials requirements. Recyclers face the same delays
and conundrums in achieving regulatory reviews and permits to move
forward as mining and other industrial projects.

Rare earths occur with phosphates in the U.S., which could become a
potentially alluring
option.[\[78\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn78) Phosphates
are extracted for a variety of uses and are of interest for developing a
competing battery chemistry (lithium-iron-phosphate or
LFP[\[79\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn79)).
However, phosphates and REE-containing minerals in sands deposits also
bear the radioactive elements thorium and uranium. This presents a
persistent dilemma since existing U.S. regulations limit the extraction
of these radioactive elements and thereby discourage the pursuit of
REE.[\[80\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn80) REE
can be harvested from other sources, such as agricultural wastes, and
could be captured from deepwater seabeds, affording an exploration
frontier. Overall, however, [REE exist within an inadequate framework
for nonfuel minerals]{.underline} --- especially given how [critical
they are to both legacy and alternative energy
technologies]{.underline}, much less non-energy and defense uses.

The U.S. government, of course, has its own part to play. First,
strategic planners must honestly distinguish rare earth demand for
defense and other strategic purposes from non-strategic demand. While
both strategic and non-strategic demand must be balanced in order to
stabilize supply, [[delivery delays]{.mark} for defense purposes [carry
significant implications for combat readiness]{.mark}, especially [in an
era of heightened]{.mark} major-power [tension.]{.mark} It is also
[crucial that the U.S]{.mark}. government [ensure]{.mark} its strategic
stockpiles of [REE are filled]{.mark} to aid in these
efforts.]{.underline}

Conclusion

The [recent merger that created the China Rare Earth Group is a major
development for the global rare earth industry.]{.underline} It is the
most recent chapter in the Chinese government's efforts to quell an
industry that has been unruly at times. Given that Chinese efforts to
directly control exports have been blocked by bodies like the WTO,
[officials are now opting for domestically oriented policies to manage
the industry.]{.underline} The merger of China's largest rare earths
operators is the most recent iteration of decades of forced industrial
consolidation meant to cut down on inefficiencies and increase central
oversight. These internally facing policies, which carry significant
consequences for global REE industries, are more difficult to challenge
in international dispute systems than their externally-facing
precursors.

Through the reorganization, [Chinese regulators can better enforce
central policies and mitigate friction with local officials who often
encourage and permit rare earth production counter to central
regulations.]{.underline} From China's perspective, consolidation is a
means to produce rare earths in a more sustainable fashion by deploying
more uniform production and environmental practices, as well as reducing
speculative capital flows that increase domestic rare earth prices in
China. Greater oversight from the SASAC over the China Rare Earth Group
[creates more leverage for Beijing's officials to influence prices by
further bifurcating the domestic and international prices of rare earth
products and stabilizing the former.]{.underline} It is also likely that
demand will increase, propelled by China's goals to increase alternative
energy and defense capacity. Thus, we anticipate this merger will not be
the last and that China's leaders will eventually fold the remaining
three northern rare earth SOEs into their own mega-conglomerate, absent
any significant deviations in industrial ideology. 

[Two [geopolitical dynamics]{.mark} properly [contextualize the
risks]{.mark} associated [with China's REE dominance:]{.mark} 1)
[Chinese tensions with the U.]{.mark}S. and its allies over trade
[and]{.mark} 2) Chinese [positioning on
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}.[\[81\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn81) Given
China's REE dominance as a stable global supplier, would Chinese
officials self-sabotage during periods of relative peace, pushing
Western countries to develop alternatives proactively? Indeed, despite
aggressive posturing and threats from Chinese officials and tabloids,
China has yet to restrict REE exports as leverage in its trade war with
the United States. [Aggression toward Taiwan would likely be a
completely different story]{.underline}, especially if the U.S. provides
military equipment or combat support to Taiwan. With more centralized
state oversight and a leadership structure more amenable to central
coordination, the China Rare Earth Group increases the state's ability
to influence and possibly even restrict rare earth exports for political
reasons.

Whether [China would [weaponize their leverage over rare earth]{.mark}
supply chains [in direct conflicts]{.mark} with the U.S. and/or its
allie]{.underline}s is a matter of speculation and debate. However, one
thing is for sure: In such an event, [the U.S. must minimize China's
ability to limit sanctions and other collective global responses against
potential coercive action.]{.underline} Taking the invasion of Ukraine
as an example, Russia's VSMPO-Avisma's strong positioning as the leading
global aerospace-grade titanium supplier caused several EU member states
to oppose sanctions on the company, despite its role in maintaining
Moscow's force
posture.[\[82\]](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/chinese-behemoths-what-chinas-rare-earths-dominance-means-us#_edn82) In
order to respond adequately to Chinese military belligerence, [the U.S.
must ensure that China's consolidated rare earth industry does not grant
Beijing undue influence over an international response.]{.underline} The
U.S. and its allies [[must act]{.mark} accordingly [to divorce]{.mark}
their strategic industries [from Chinese rare
earths]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As a result of these dynamics, U.S. government officials are under
pressure to take significant steps. [They must mitigate short- and
medium-term supply risks from potential disruptions in Chinese supply
and simultaneously take a long-term approach to developing a domestic
rare earths ecosystem.]{.underline} The former relies more on filling
strategic stockpiles, securing alternative supplies from allied
countries like Australia and decreasing product reliance on rare earths
from an engineering standpoint where possible. The latter involves a
more [holistic approach of bolstering several nodes along rare earths
value chains simultaneously]{.underline} (so they can be connected once
fully operational) [and [involving foreign capital]{.mark} in these
efforts when the opportunities present.]{.underline} Private-sector and
government funding from allies like Australia, Japan and South Korea can
be used to develop "friendly" rare earth supply chains with more secure
supply. However[, the United States' sole reliance on allies to correct
domestic industrial deficiencies in rare earths would not provide the
more robust REE supply chains that are envisioned.]{.underline}

#### Taiwan war escalates\-\--extinction

danger is nuclear war," The Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/04/17/china-united-states-nuclear-conflict-danger/\]

["It seems odd that war with China over Taiwan seems a comfortable
assumption for so many]{.underline} when the U.S. and NATO remain
cautious about Russia's war in Ukraine precisely because of the
perceived risk of nuclear escalation," [John K.
Culver](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/expert/john-k-culver/), a CIA
veteran and former national intelligence officer for East Asia, told me.

Even [many [worst-case scenarios about China are too sanguine]{.mark}
about the outcome of a conflict.]{.underline} In March, for example,
House Republicans took part in a U.S.-China war game organized by
retired Rear Adm. [Mark
Montgomery](https://www.fdd.org/team/radm-ret-mark-montgomery/), a
senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. After the
exercise was first reported by my Post colleague [Olivier
Knox](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/28/gop-wargames-chinese-attack-taiwan/),
I reached out to Montgomery to ask how it unfolded and whether it
included a nuclear exchange.

He said, "The war game ended up with China having a lodgment on Taiwan,
but not having defeated the Taiwan Army." The United States suffered
"significant casualties" and Taiwan "awful casualties." Montgomery
explained that the scenario "did not escalate to nuclear, although that
is certainly a possibility in this sort of contingency."

[The lack of a nuclear exchange]{.underline} is quite common in
U.S.-China war games, at least those conducted at the unclassified
level. (A senior defense official told me this is no longer the case
with top-secret Pentagon war games.) A recent [war
game](https://www.csis.org/analysis/first-battle-next-war-wargaming-chinese-invasion-taiwan) organized
by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), like the
congressional war game, had the United States and its allies defeating a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Victory came at "high cost" --- "The United
States and its allies lost dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and
tens of thousands of service members" --- but not at the *highest* cost:
i.e., the destruction of U.S. cities. CSIS senior adviser Mark F.
Cancian told me that, although he would pursue "a follow-on project that
looks at nuclear operations," he wanted to focus specifically on
conventional operations.

That's a perfectly legitimate choice, but it [inadvertently risks
reinforcing [assumptions that a U.S.-China conflict could avoid nuclear
escalation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even a New York
Times [op-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/27/opinion/a-war-with-china-would-reach-deep-into-american-society.html) in
February written by an Australian scholar, headlined "A War With China
Would Be Unlike Anything Americans Faced Before," focused on
cyberwarfare and economic warfare --- not nuclear warfare.

And yet [[China]{.mark} is [in the midst of a]{.mark} rapid
[nuc]{.mark}lear [buildup.]{.mark} The latest Pentagon report
on ]{.underline}[Chinese military
power](https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/29/2003122279/-1/-1/1/2022-MILITARY-AND-SECURITY-DEVELOPMENTS-INVOLVING-THE-PEOPLES-REPUBLIC-OF-CHINA.PDF)[ projects
that its nuclear stockpile will grow from 400 warheads today [to 1,500
warheads by 2035.]{.mark}]{.underline} The report also warns that, while
China nominally adheres to a "no first use" policy on nuclear weapons,
"[[Beijing]{.mark} probably would ... [consider nuclear use to restore
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} [if]{.mark} a conventional military
defeat gravely threatened PRC survival." Given that [a [failed invasion
of]{.mark} [Taiwan]{.mark} could threaten the CCP's power, it's
reasonable to worry that China could up the ante by going
nuclear.]{.underline}

The risk of nuclear escalation is all the greater because, as a senior
U.S. admiral explained to me, [it would be [difficult for the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to win]{.mark} a [war over
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline} by attacking only Chinese ships at sea and
Chinese aircraft in the skies. [The United States could [find itself
compelled]{.mark}, as a matter of military necessity, [to attack bases
in China. China,]{.mark} in turn, could [strike U.S.
bases]{.mark}]{.underline} in Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Guam,
[even Hawaii and the West Coast.]{.underline}

Culver, the former intelligence officer, told me, "Even if Beijing
announced that its retaliatory strikes against Hawaii or the West Coast
of the U.S. were conventionally armed, [it would [risk immediate]{.mark}
U.S. [escalation.]{.mark} Can a U.S. president refuse to launch in the
30 minutes between missile launch from China and impact in the
U.S.?"]{.underline}

[When [two nuclear-armed powers attack each other's territory]{.mark},
it would be [difficult to keep]{.mark} the [conflict contained]{.mark}
at a conventional level.]{.underline} Both sides, admittedly, would have
an incentive to avoid "mutual assured destruction," but
[[countries]{.mark} often [act rashly]{.mark} in the heat of
battle,]{.underline} particularly after they have suffered significant
casualties and [feel the need to ensure that their troops did not die in
vain.]{.underline}

### Extraction\-\--Renewables\-\--1AC 

#### Securing REEs is also key to a renewable transition without worsening reliance on China 

**Frederiksen 23** \[Mads Qvist; executive director of the Arctic
Economic Council; "If we want an energy transition, we must have more
mining," The Arctic Economic Council,

//AChiong

[The [demand for raw materials]{.mark} is expected to [increase by
500%]{.mark} between now and 2050,]{.underline} according to the World
Bank[, [due to the energy transition]{.underline}]{.mark} [that the
world is going through.]{.underline}

There was a watershed moment in history when the earth was first "turned
inside out" and humans started to exploit the raw materials that make up
the primordial foundation of our planet. Today [we once again [look
underground for the solutions]{.mark} to our challenges.]{.underline}

[[In the Arctic]{.mark} region, we can [find many of the metals and
minerals needed for the green transition]{.mark}.]{.underline} On
January 12th 2023, the Swedish mining company LKAB announced that around
700 meters below the ground, they had discovered the largest known
deposit of rare earth elements in Europe -- [a raw material that is it
is critical for our transition to new, green technologies but is [not
currently being mined]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe.

\[diagram omitted\]

All across the Arctic, the local communities have for centuries been
involved in the mining sector. The region has been mined throughout
history to attain the building blocks for a more modern and developed
civilisation globally. Yet, people's understanding of the importance of
mining has decreased over time as new mines have been placed in remote
and distant locations with different regulatory frameworks than in the
Arctic. However, now the world needs Arctic mining again because the
region has many of the raw materials needed in the green transition and
in places with fair and transparent jurisdictions.

[Politicians are awaking to the need of mining for a clean and greener
future]{.underline}

In early March 2023, the European Union (EU) published their new
Critical Raw Materials (CRM) Act. It may not have made a lot of
headlines around the world, but it is important for industries, remote
Arctic communities, and the wider population.

The president of the European Commission Ursula de Leyden highlighted
the importance of mining at the beginning of the year when she said:

Simultaneously in the US, President Biden earlier announced an increase
in the development of green technologies. [The new Inflation Reduction
Act
(IRA)](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it) also
includes large tax breaks for mining companies that can produce the
required critical raw materials. Last year, the US also launched a \$30
million initiative to research and secure the supply chain of domestic
raw materials.

[[Both the EU and]{.mark} [the US]{.mark}A have recognised that they
[risk]{.mark} simply [replacing fossil fuel dependency to mineral
dependency from authoritarian states if they don't act
now.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[China --]{.mark} who today is processing most of the world's raw
materials and thus [holds a competitive advantage,]{.mark}]{.underline}
is also moving into new mining regions such as Madagascar and deep-sea
mining off the coast of Mozambique. Some Chinese companies have also
[shown an [interest in mining]{.mark} projects [throughout the
Arctic]{.mark} region.]{.underline}

[Mining has become [an issue of security]{.mark} but it is also just [as
much about]{.mark} the future of [planetary health;]{.mark}]{.underline}
the unavoidable fact is that [our sustainable future begins deep
underground]{.underline} in a mine. Yet, there were no references to
mining in the most recent report of the International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC).

[We [cannot afford to slow down with mining]{.mark}. It is clear that we
are going to need a vast amount of green energy in the future, and for
that, [we will need]{.mark} a [vast amount of critical
minerals.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the coming two decades, we will require a 500% increase in the
production of lithium and graphite in order to meet demand. Some people
estimate that our activity [will necessitate the opening of more than
330 new mines in the near future,]{.underline} and with one mine
normally taking more than 15 years to become operational, we have no
time to waste.

We need to invest more in new mining projects

[[Today's]{.mark} mineral [supply]{.mark} and investment plans [fall
short of what is needed]{.mark} to transform our energy
sector.]{.underline} A growing and more resource-hungry population means
larger quantities of CO2 emissions unless we are able to change our
basic technologies.

[If you want to build a battery to store energy, [you need lithium,
nickel, cobalt, manganese,]{.mark} and [graphite]{.mark} to ensure high
performance, longevity and, energy density]{.underline}.

\[diagram omitted\]

[If you want to expand your electricity network, you need
[copper]{.mark} and [aluminium.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[If you want to build permanent magnets that are used in wind turbines
and electric vehicles, you need r[are earth
elements.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In 2019, Finnish geologist Simon Michaux estimated that [the [world has
to increase]{.mark} the production of several raw materials several
times,]{.underline} above all total historical production to date, to
reach our climate ambitions. Therefore recycling will not take us all
the way.

A typical electric car requires six times more mineral inputs than a
conventional car, and an onshore wind turbine requires nine times more
minerals than a gas-fired plant of the same capacity. Since 2010, the
average amount of minerals required for a new unit of power generation
capacity has increased by 50%.

\[diagram omitted\]

[It is also the [critical raw materials which we need in]{.mark} our
[satellites, computers,]{.mark} and connectivity
i[nfrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}. The defence industry also needs
the minerals that we are currently sourcing from authoritarian states.
[Each F-35 [jet]{.mark} contains more than 400 kilos of yttrium,
terbium, and other rare earth elements. Nuclear [reactors]{.mark} and
[lasers]{.mark} use samarium, [missile guidance systems]{.mark} need
neodymium, [night vision goggles]{.mark} need lanthanum]{.underline},
etc. In the autumn of 2022, the [Pentagon temporarily halted deliveries
of F-35 jets after discovering that the raw materials used for a magnet
had been made with a cobalt and samarium alloy from China.]{.underline}
As such, they had to find a place closer to home in their supply chain.
Today, [the majority of rare earth mining, refining, and processing
takes place in China.]{.underline}

In 2010, China and Japan entered a trade dispute when the former
suddenly halted all shipments of rare earth elements to Japan. The
dispute began when the Chinese government reduced its export quotas by
40% which resulted in import prices rising quickly. China argued that
this decision was made to protect the environment, but the West called
it protectionism in disguise. The dispute was later resolved in the WTO,
but it caused western governments to begin looking outside of China for
rare earth elements.

[[For the climate, for security, and for jobs]{.underline}]{.mark}

As we can see, [[we must diversify our raw materials supply and develop
mining operations in]{.mark} new places]{.underline}, instead of
outsourcing to developing countries. [[The Arctic]{.mark} region
contains many of the minerals that are currently mined elsewhere, even
though the [quality of the ore]{.mark} could possibly be [better in the
north.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Renewables are key to solve climate change 

**Morris 23** \[Jennifer; February 2; Principal Research Scientist at
MIT Energy Initiative and the Center for Sustainability Science and
Strategy, Phd in Engineering Systems Division, MIT; "Renewable Energy,"
MIT, https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/renewable-energy\] //AChiong

[[Renewable energy]{.mark} is energy [from sources we cannot run out
of]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some types of renewable energy,
like [wind](https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/wind-energy) and [solar
power](https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/solar-energy), come from
sources [that are [not depleted when used]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Others, like biomass, come from sources [that can be
replenished]{.underline}. Common types of renewable energy are wind,
solar, hydropower, biomass
and [geothermal](https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/geothermal-energy)[.]{.underline}

[Renewable energy has [two advantages over the fossil fuels]{.mark} that
provide most of our energy today.]{.underline} First, [[there is a
limited amount of fossil fuel resources]{.underline}]{.mark} (like coal,
oil and natural gas) in the world, [and if we use them all we cannot get
any more in our lifetimes.]{.underline} Second, renewable energy
[[produces]{.mark} far [less]{.mark} carbon dioxide ([CO~2~) and]{.mark}
other [harmful ]{.mark}]{.underline}[greenhouse
gases](https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/greenhouse-gases)[ and
[pollutants]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most types of renewable energy produce
no CO~2~ at all once they are running. For this reason, [renewable
energy is widely viewed as [playing a central role in climate
change ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[mitigation]{.mark}](https://climate.mit.edu/explainers/mitigation-and-adaptation)[ and

[We are [on the brink of]{.mark} an [irreversible climate
disaster]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is a global emergency beyond any
doubt. Much of the very [fabric of [life on Earth is imperiled]{.mark}.
We are stepping into a critical and unpredictable new phase of the
climate crisis.]{.underline} For many years, scientists, including a
group of more than 15,000, have sounded the alarm about the impending
dangers of climate change [[driven by increasing
g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}as emissions and ecosystem
change]{.underline} (Ripple et al. [2020](javascript:;)). For half a
century, global warming has been correctly predicted even before it was
observed---and not only by independent academic scientists but also by
fossil fuel companies (Supran et al. [2023](javascript:;)). Despite
these warnings, [[we are]{.mark} still [moving in the wrong
direction]{.mark}; fossil fuel emissions have increased to an all-time
high,]{.underline} the 3 hottest days ever occurred in July of 2024
(Guterres [2024](javascript:;)), and current policies have us on track
for approximately 2.7 degrees Celsius (°C) peak warming by 2100
(UNEP [2023](javascript:;)). Tragically, we are failing to avoid serious
impacts, and we can now only hope to limit the extent of the damage. We
are witnessing the grim reality of the forecasts as climate impacts
escalate, [bringing forth scenes of unprecedented disasters around the
world and human and nonhuman suffering]{.underline}. We find ourselves
amid an abrupt climate upheaval, a dire situation never before
encountered in the annals of human existence. We have now brought the
planet into climatic conditions never witnessed by us or our prehistoric
relatives within our genus, *Homo* ([supplemental figure

Our aim in the present article is to communicate directly to
researchers, policymakers, and the public. As scientists and academics,
we feel it is our moral duty and that of our institutions to alert
humanity to the growing threats that we face as clearly as possible and
to show leadership in addressing them. In this report, we analyze the
latest trends in a wide array of planetary vital signs. We also review
notable recent climate-related disasters, spotlight important
climate-related topics, and discuss needed policy interventions. This
report is part of our series of concise annual updates on the state of
the climate.

Recent trends in planetary vital signs

In 2023, [various historical temperature and ice extent records were
broken by enormous margins]{.underline} (figure [1](javascript:;);
Ripple et al. [2023a](javascript:;)). Both global and North Atlantic sea
surface temperatures were far above their 1991--2024 averages for much
of the year---a pattern that has continued well into 2024
(figure [1a](javascript:;), [1b](javascript:;)). Although Antarctic and
global sea ice extent have now come into range of previous years, they
remain well below their 1993--2024 averages
(figure [1c](javascript:;), [1d](javascript:;)). Global daily mean
temperatures were at record levels for nearly half of 2023 and much of
2024 (figure [1e](javascript:;)). On our current emissions trajectory,
we may regularly surpass current temperature records in future years
(Matthews and Wynes [2022](javascript:;)).

\[figure omitted\]

Of the [[35 planetary vital signs]{.underline}]{.mark} we track annually
(figures [2](javascript:;) and [3](javascript:;)), 25 [are [at record
levels]{.mark}]{.underline} ([supplemental table
S1](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/bioscience/74/12/10.1093_biosci_biae087/2/biae087_supplemental_files.zip?Expires=1756444723&Signature=MvVDo~eQtpR~CvN4eB5OCnXvEmgixE0FTbjF7aB5JO78srOg-Sg6RBFR8vsik7zahJd5iJF25V8KdkNQueMnFXu556bAUQUzmv6rfS1zYomwty~FlIPMv9kj0VKiMhZ-5Dwlb~9t0PVHVH0yWHmxjSJhqy5GCE3Y0L2u99YABV9W2YdPfVrakb3J06CMHBostFpHOzFWIh0hQznJKtQtMb~PyWgNkmfzach76tYyG5gTPhcNZxH5Yb~cGg1Rn34bAN~soZojBCSDD~idXshpWxpZAW3DNRWJbguHCMU7p4KwpDIFD-8mWKncKsjZMeUCWWxi1dmLUFOcUJlOdHZEjQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)).
The global failure to support a rapid and socially just fossil fuel
phasedown has led to rapidly escalating climate-related impacts
(table [1](javascript:;)). Below, we focus on variables that have either
changed greatly or are at record extremes.

\[figures omitted\]

\[table omitted\]

*Note:* We list numerous recent disasters that may be at least partly
related to climate change. This list is not intended to be exhaustive.
Because of the recent nature of these events, our sources often include
news media articles. For each event, we generally provide references
indicating that the likelihood or strength of such an event may have
increased because of anthropogenic climate change. References to
scientific articles are given directly in the table, and links to news
articles are provided in supplemental file S1. Some of these climate
disasters may be at least partly related to changes in jet streams
(Stendel et al. [2021](javascript:;), Rousi
et al. [2022](javascript:;)).

The human enterprise

Our graphical account illustrates how humanity\'s collective size and
consumption patterns continued to accelerate on multiple fronts.
Although fertility rates were down slightly to a record low in 2023,
other variables set all-time record highs, including human population,
ruminant livestock population, per capita meat production, and gross
domestic product (GDP; figure [2a--2e](javascript:;)). Human population
and ruminant livestock population have been increasing at approximately
200,000 and 170,000 per day respectively. Decoupling the growth in all
of these variables with greenhouse gas emissions may be difficult
(Ripple et al. [2024](javascript:;)).

Energy

Fossil fuel consumption rose by 1.5% in 2023 relative to 2022
(figure [2h](javascript:;)), mostly because of substantial increases in
coal consumption (1.6%) and oil consumption (2.5%;
figure [2h](javascript:;)). Renewable energy use also grew in 2023, with
solar and wind consumption together rising 15% relative to 2022
(figure [2h](javascript:;)). Much of this growth can be attributed to
the fact that renewable energy is often cheaper than comparable new
fossil fuel alternatives (Roser [2020](javascript:;)). However, [fossil
fuel consumption remains roughly 14 times greater than solar and wind
energy consumption]{.underline} (figure [2h](javascript:;)) and recent
growth in the renewable share of electricity generation mostly covered
increased demand, instead of replacing fossil fuels
(REN21 [2024](javascript:;)).

Forests

[[Global tree]{.mark} cover [loss]{.mark} rose from 22.8
megahectares]{.underline} (Mha) per year in 2022 to 28.3 Mha per year in
2023, reaching its third-highest level (figure [2f](javascript:;)); this
was at least [[partly because of wildfires]{.mark},]{.underline} which
caused tree cover loss to reach a record high of 11.9 Mha
(figure [3n](javascript:;)). High rates of tree cover loss [can [drive a
set of related feedback loops]{.mark}, wherein the [loss of forest
carbon sequestration]{.mark} leads to additional warming, which can
drive further losses in carbon sequestration]{.underline} and so on
(Ripple et al. [2023b](javascript:;), Goldman and
Carter [2024](javascript:;)). This type of climate carbon feedback
process could limit the success of some natural climate solutions. In
2023, there was also a [dramatic decline in the land carbon
sink]{.underline} according to Ke and colleagues
(<https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2407.12447> \[preprint: not peer
reviewed\]). On a more positive note, the deforestation rate in the
Brazilian Amazon continued to decline, dropping from 1.16 Mha in 2022 to
0.90 Mha in 2023 (figure [2g](javascript:;)). This decrease may be
partly because of the shifting policies of Brazil\'s government (Vilani
et al. [2023](javascript:;)) and comes at a critical time given that the
[[Amazon]{.mark} may be [nearing a tipping point]{.mark} where a loss of
resilience and positive feedback loops contribute to large-scale forest
dieback]{.underline} (Boulton et al. [2022](javascript:;), Flores
et al. [2024](javascript:;)).

[Global greenhouse gases and temperature]{.underline}

Annual energy-related [[emissions]{.mark} i]{.underline}ncreased 2.1% in
2023, and [are now [above 40 gigatons]{.mark} of
carbon-dioxide-equivalent for the first time]{.underline}
(figure [2k](javascript:;)). The top three emitting countries are China,
the United States, and India, which, together, account for over half of
global emissions ([supplemental table
S2](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/bioscience/74/12/10.1093_biosci_biae087/2/biae087_supplemental_files.zip?Expires=1756444723&Signature=MvVDo~eQtpR~CvN4eB5OCnXvEmgixE0FTbjF7aB5JO78srOg-Sg6RBFR8vsik7zahJd5iJF25V8KdkNQueMnFXu556bAUQUzmv6rfS1zYomwty~FlIPMv9kj0VKiMhZ-5Dwlb~9t0PVHVH0yWHmxjSJhqy5GCE3Y0L2u99YABV9W2YdPfVrakb3J06CMHBostFpHOzFWIh0hQznJKtQtMb~PyWgNkmfzach76tYyG5gTPhcNZxH5Yb~cGg1Rn34bAN~soZojBCSDD~idXshpWxpZAW3DNRWJbguHCMU7p4KwpDIFD-8mWKncKsjZMeUCWWxi1dmLUFOcUJlOdHZEjQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)).
Anthropogenic emissions of aerosol pollutants are declining; because
these aerosols have a net cooling effect, this reduction may be causing
the rate of global warming to accelerate (Hansen
et al. [2023](javascript:;)). On the basis of global year-to-date
averages, the concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane are at record
highs (figure [3a](javascript:;), [3b](javascript:;)). Carbon dioxide
levels were recently observed to be surging (NOAA [2024](javascript:;)).
Furthermore, the growth rate of methane emissions has been accelerating,
which is very troubling (Shindell et al. [2024](javascript:;)). Nitrous
oxide is also at a record high (figure [3c](javascript:;)); annual
anthropogenic emissions of this potent long-lived greenhouse gas have
increased by roughly 40% from 1980 to 2020 (Tian
et al. [2024](javascript:;)).

[Surface temperature is at a record high,]{.underline} and 2024 is
expected to be one of the hottest years ever recorded
(figure [3d](javascript:;)). Each 0.1°C of global warming [places an
extra 100 million people (or more) into unprecedented hot average
temperatures]{.underline} (Lenton et al. [2023](javascript:;)). On our
current trajectory, future years will almost certainly be even hotter,
because our climate continues to shift away from conditions associated
with human thriving for much of Earth\'s population (Vecellio
et al. [2023](javascript:;)). Even in the most optimistic scenarios,
[large-scale [climate adaptation]{.mark} efforts will be
[needed,]{.mark} particularly for the most vulnerable
populations]{.underline} (Ripple et al. [2022](javascript:;)).

Oceans and ice

[[Ocean acidity and]{.mark} ocean [heat]{.mark} content are both at
record extremes]{.underline}
(figure [3f](javascript:;), [3g](javascript:;)), which has led to
various ocean-related climate impacts. For example, heat waves in 2021
and 2023 caused marine animal mass mortality events (White
et al. [2023](javascript:;), Goreau and Hayes [2024](javascript:;)). In
addition, the average global sea level is presently at a record high,
mostly because of both overall warming and a strong El Niño in 2023 and
part of 2024 (figure [3h](javascript:;); Lee [2024](javascript:;)).
[Continued sea level rise has the potential to [displace hundreds of
millions]{.mark} of people over the course of the century]{.underline}
(Kulp and Strauss [2019](javascript:;)). [Melting continental ice
contributes about half to sea level rise]{.underline} (Horwath
et al. [2021](javascript:;)), and the latest data indicate that
Greenland's ice mass, Antarctica's ice mass, and the average glacier
thickness are all at record lows
(figure [3j](javascript:;)--[3l](javascript:;)).

Climate impacts and extreme weather

[Climate-related [extreme weather and disasters]{.mark} are
[contributing greatly to human suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}
(figure [4](javascript:;)). Increasing heat and rainfall extremes are
now far outside the historical climate (Robinson
et al. [2021](javascript:;)). The rapid increase in average global
temperatures (figure [1e](javascript:;)) has led to a massive rise in
the incidence of heat extremes (figure [3p](javascript:;)). This is
[linked to many adverse human outcomes, including [direct
mortality]{.mark}, increased [healthcare costs, mental health]{.mark}
issues, and deaths from cardiorespiratory [diseases]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(]{.mark}Ebi et al. [2021](javascript:;)). Climate change has already

Climate spotlight

In the present section, we spotlight recent developments in various
different climate-related areas: [coral bleaching, toxic orange
rivers]{.underline}, solar radiation modification (SRM) research,
climate scientists' opinion on global temperatures, climate change as a
social justice issue, climate feedback loops and tipping points, and the
risk of societal collapse.

Coral bleaching

Coral reefs benefit millions of people by providing a wide range of
ecosystem services, including coastal protection, improved water
quality, fisheries, and tourism opportunities; they also provide habitat
for many species (Woodhead et al. [2019](javascript:;)). Climate change
is a particularly serious threat to coral reefs (Hoegh-Guldberg
et al. [2017](javascript:;)). Warm-water coral death is sometimes
preceded by bleaching---the loss of a symbiotic relationship with
microalgae (figure [5a](javascript:;); Hoegh-Guldberg
et al. [2017](javascript:;)). When a sharp spike in sea temperature
unfolds well above the long-term average summer maximum, many corals die
quickly within a week or two without having time to bleach. Others
bleach and either die more slowly over a period of a few months or
regain their color and survive (Hughes et al. [2018](javascript:;)). As
of 2024, extraordinarily warm ocean temperatures
(figure [1a](javascript:;)) are driving the fourth global-scale coral
bleaching event ever recorded (previous events: 1998, 2010, 2014--2017;
Thiem [2024](javascript:;)).

\[figure omitted\]

Toxic orange rivers

Climate change in the Arctic is altering watershed hydrology and water
biogeochemistry. Recently, researchers have observed an emergent threat
in Arctic streams that turned orange because of increased iron and toxic
metals (figure [5b](javascript:;)). This discoloration began in the last
decade, coinciding with rapid global warming and permafrost thaw
(O\'Donnell et al. [2024](javascript:;)). Compared with clear streams,
orange streams are more acidic, have higher turbidity, and have elevated
sulfate, iron, and trace metals. This discoloration correlates with
declines in macroinvertebrate diversity and fish abundance, affecting
drinking water and subsistence fisheries in rural Alaska (O\'Donnell
et al. [2024](javascript:;)).

Solar radiation modification research

SRM research, also known as *solar geoengineering research*, has been
dramatically increasing in recent years (figure [5c](javascript:;)). It
involves potentially risky techniques to reflect sunlight away from
Earth to mitigate climate change effects. General categories of SRM
include atmospheric, terrestrial, and space-based applications
(Keith [2020](javascript:;)). Specific methods, for example, include
injecting aerosols into the stratosphere or brightening marine clouds.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that
stratospheric aerosol injection is the most-researched SRM method, but
there are a number of environmental concerns (IPCC [2018](javascript:;),
Visioni et al. [2020](javascript:;)). SRMs are also controversial
because of potential unintended consequences and ethical concerns.
Critics argue that it is misguided and may disrupt weather patterns and
deter emissions reduction efforts (Whyte [2018](javascript:;)). However,
research continues to explore its feasibility and risks. SRM is often
seen as a temporary, potentially important solution to both reduce
warming and corresponding damages including for the highly important and
fast-warming subpolar regions (Smith et al. [2022](javascript:;)).
Research into solar geoengineering needs to focus on understanding the
potential environmental, social, and geopolitical impacts, as well as
assessing effectiveness and safety on both regional and global scales
(Sovacool et al. [2022](javascript:;)). In addition, interdisciplinary
research is required to explore ethical, legal, and governance
frameworks, along with public perception and acceptance, while
emphasizing the critical importance of drastically reducing greenhouse
gas emissions. There is a consensus study available as a roadmap for
solar geoengineering research and research governance (National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [2021](javascript:;)).

Climate scientists' opinion on global temperatures

A [2024 opinion poll has unveiled the predictions of hundreds of
prominent climate scientists of the IPCC, senior authors, and review
editors]{.underline} (380 respondents). From a personal perspective,
[nearly [80% of]{.mark} these [scientists anticipate]{.mark} global
[temperatures increasing by at least 2.5°C]{.mark}]{.underline} above
preindustrial levels by the end of the century
(Carrington [2024](javascript:;)). Nearly half of them foresee a rise of
at least 3°C. A mere 6% believe that the internationally agreed-on limit
of 1.5°C will be achieved (figure [5d](javascript:;)). This parallels an
earlier survey of IPCC scientists, which showed that approximately 60%
expected warming of at least 3°C (Tollefson [2021](javascript:;)).
[These projections [paint a bleak picture]{.mark} of the future, with
many scientists envisioning [widespread famines, conflicts, mass
migration, and]{.mark} increasing [extreme weather]{.mark} that will
[surpass anything witnessed thus far]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
posing catastrophic consequences for both humanity and the biosphere
(Carrington [2024](javascript:;)). It is important to keep in mind,
however, that such characterizations can suffer from conflation of
matters of science (i.e., how much warming are we committed to for a
given emissions pathway) and matters of policy (what pathways are still
possible and what the obstacles are). There is no way to know, for
example, whether the polled IPCC physical scientists based their
assessments on the science or simply on their views of the political
prospects for action (Mann and Hayhoe [2024](javascript:;)).

One of the numerous challenges for scientists is how to communicate
about climate change (Guenther [2024](javascript:;)). Some have argued
that attitudes of pessimism and resignation can be obstructive to
climate action. Moreover, some say those who oppose action have resorted
to alternative strategies including the propagation of pessimism,
because embracing a sense of helplessness can undermine the motivation
for action (Mann and Hayhoe [2024](javascript:;)). Conversely, it has
also been suggested that optimism gives rise to inaction, if people
think things are fine and therefore action is not needed
(Wilson [2021](javascript:;)). In any case, the importance of tone may
be overstated in this context, and more research is needed to better
identify motivating factors for climate action (Bamberg
et al. [2018](javascript:;)).

With the increasingly undeniable effects of climate change, a dire
assessment is an honest assessment. Denying the existential threat posed
by climate change is becoming increasingly less plausible. The fact is
that avoiding every tenth of a degree of warming is critically
important. Rather than presenting a climate change prognosis
pessimistically or optimistically, we just want to act truthfully and
tell it like it is. We must emphasize both urgency and agency when it
comes to our characterizations of the needed action on climate
(Mann [2023](javascript:;)).

Climate change as a social justice issue

Climate change is a matter of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI),
because the wealthy people that emit the most greenhouse gases are
generally less vulnerable to climate impacts
(figure [5e](javascript:;)). Although the ramifications of emissions are
global, they are particularly severe in the Global South
(Ngcamu [2023](javascript:;)). [Vulnerability to climate change is
shaped by a complex interplay of social, economic, and political
factors, leaving historically diverse, underserved, and [marginalized
communities disproportionately affected]{.mark}]{.underline} (Levy and
Patz [2015](javascript:;)). DEI principles underscore the urgency to
address these disparities. Embedding climate change within the framework
of organizational DEI activities may help to foster comprehensive and
meaningful progress toward equity and sustainability. By recognizing the
disproportionate impacts of climate change on marginalized communities,
organizations can work toward rectifying historical injustices by
funding countries in the Global South to maintain decarbonization while
addressing urgent climate change concerns. In addition, DEI
considerations are relevant to international climate policy; for
example, they can help guide efforts to rapidly and equitably phase out
fossil fuel extractions (Muttitt and Kartha [2020](javascript:;)).

The ethical dimensions of climate change have led many faith leaders to
speak out on the issue (e.g., Nhat Hanh [2015](javascript:;), Pope
Francis [2023](javascript:;)). This represents an opportunity for
diverse communities to build alliances around the issue.

Climate feedback loops and tipping points

Awareness and research need to increase on climate feedback loops.
[[Feedback loops]{.mark} are processes that can either [amplify]{.mark}
or reduce the [effects o]{.mark}f greenhouse gas emissions.]{.underline}
Many significant feedback loops enhance warming. At least [28 amplifying
feedback loops have been identified]{.underline}
(tables [2a](javascript:;), [2b](javascript:;)). A particularly
concerning feedback loop is [the permafrost feedback loop, which
involves rising temperatures causing permafrost thawing.]{.underline}
This process [releases more carbon dioxide and methane, leading to
further warming]{.underline}. Areas of active climate feedback loop
research include permafrost--cloud interactions (de Vrese
et al. [2024](javascript:;)), glacier meltwater (Pelle
et al. [2023](javascript:;)), and biodiversity (Weiskopf
et al. [2024](javascript:;)). Because feedback loops are not yet fully
integrated into climate models, current emissions reduction plans might
fall short in adequately limiting future warming.

\[table omitted\]

Some climate feedback loops are linked to tipping points, potentially
triggering major and irreversible changes in the Earth system without
further pushing by human activities. Tipping elements are biophysical
systems on Earth with tipping point behavior that contribute to
regulating the climate system (Lenton et al. [2008](javascript:;)). They
have recently been assessed for their tipping sensitivity. Five of
sixteen climate tipping elements are likely to cross their tipping
points at 1.5°C: the Greenland ice sheet, the West Antarctic ice sheet,
boreal permafrost, low-latitude coral reefs, and the Barents Sea Ice
(Armstrong McKay et al. [2022](javascript:;)). Several climate tipping
elements are connected, and if one tips, others may tip, triggering a
tipping point cascade (Wunderling et al. [2024](javascript:;)). Overall,
this points to a complex situation where climate controlling feedback
loops and tipping point systems are interconnected in a way that could
trigger self-perpetuating processes that amplify warming beyond human
control. Therefore, we recommend the IPCC publish a special report on
feedback loops and tipping points.

[[Risk of societal collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [climate emergency is not an isolated issue.]{.underline} Global
heating, although it is catastrophic, is merely one aspect of a profound
polycrisis that includes environmental degradation, rising economic
inequality, and biodiversity loss (Hoyer et al. [2023](javascript:;)).
[Climate change is [a glaring symptom of]{.mark} a deeper systemic
issue: [ecological overshoot]{.mark}, where human consumption outpaces
the Earth\'s ability to regenerate]{.underline}
(Rees [2023](javascript:;), Ripple et al. [2024](javascript:;)).
Overshoot is an inherently [unstable state that [cannot persist
indefinitely]{.mark}.]{.underline} As pressures increase and the risk of
Earth\'s climate system switching to a catastrophic state rises (Steffen
et al. [2018](javascript:;)), more and more scientists have begun to
research the possibility of societal collapse
(Brozović [2023](javascript:;)). Even in the absence of global collapse,
[climate change could [cause many millions of]{.mark} additional [deaths
by 2050]{.mark}]{.underline} (WHO [2023](javascript:;)).

Along with the broader danger of overshoot, [climate change could
contribute to a collapse by [increasing the likelihood of catastrophic
risks]{.mark} such as [international conflict or]{.mark} by causing
multiple [stresses]{.mark}, resulting in [system-wide]{.mark}
synchronous [failures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kemp
et al. [2022](javascript:;)). The number of published articles
using *climate change* and *societal collapse* language has been
dramatically increasing (figure [5f](javascript:;); supplemental
methods). Climate change has already displaced millions of people, and
has the potential to [displace hundreds of millions or even billions
more, leading to [greater geopolitical instability]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}([Table

By the end of the century, roughly one-third of people worldwide could
be outside the human climate niche, [facing increased risk of illness
and early death, famine, and a host of other adverse
outcomes]{.underline} (Lenton et al. [2023](javascript:;)).

Conclusions

Despite six IPCC reports, 28 COP meetings, hundreds of other reports,
and tens of thousands of scientific papers, the world has made only very
minor headway on climate change, in part because of stiff resistance
from those benefiting financially from the current fossil-fuel based
system. We are currently going in the wrong direction, and our
increasing fossil fuel consumption and rising greenhouse gas emissions
are driving us toward a climate catastrophe. We fear the danger of
climate breakdown. The evidence we observe is both alarming and
undeniable, but it is this very shock that drives us to action. We
recognize the profound urgency of addressing this global challenge,
especially the horrific outlook for the world\'s poor. We feel the
courage and determination to seek transformative science-based solutions
across all aspects of society ([table
S4](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/bioscience/74/12/10.1093_biosci_biae087/2/biae087_supplemental_files.zip?Expires=1756444723&Signature=MvVDo~eQtpR~CvN4eB5OCnXvEmgixE0FTbjF7aB5JO78srOg-Sg6RBFR8vsik7zahJd5iJF25V8KdkNQueMnFXu556bAUQUzmv6rfS1zYomwty~FlIPMv9kj0VKiMhZ-5Dwlb~9t0PVHVH0yWHmxjSJhqy5GCE3Y0L2u99YABV9W2YdPfVrakb3J06CMHBostFpHOzFWIh0hQznJKtQtMb~PyWgNkmfzach76tYyG5gTPhcNZxH5Yb~cGg1Rn34bAN~soZojBCSDD~idXshpWxpZAW3DNRWJbguHCMU7p4KwpDIFD-8mWKncKsjZMeUCWWxi1dmLUFOcUJlOdHZEjQ__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)).
Our goal is to provide clear, evidence-based insights that inspire
informed and bold responses from citizens to researchers and world
leaders.

[Rapidly [phasing down fossil fuel use]{.mark} should be [a top
priority.]{.mark}]{.underline} This might be accomplished partly through
a sufficiently high global carbon price that could restrain emissions by
the wealthy while potentially providing funding for much-needed climate
mitigation and adaptation programs. In addition, pricing and reducing
methane emissions is critical for effectively mitigating climate change.
[Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and unlike carbon dioxide, which
persists in the atmosphere for centuries, methane has a relatively short
atmospheric lifetime]{.underline}, making reductions impactful in the
short term (Shindell et al. [2024](javascript:;)). [Drastically cutting
methane emissions can slow the near-term rate of global warming, helping
to avoid tipping points and extreme climate impacts.]{.underline}

In a world with finite resources, unlimited growth is a perilous
illusion. We need bold, transformative change: drastically reducing
overconsumption and waste, especially by the affluent, stabilizing and
gradually reducing the human population through empowering education and
rights for girls and women, reforming food production systems to support
more plant-based eating, and adopting an ecological and post-growth
economics framework that ensures social justice ([Table

Climate change instruction should be integrated into secondary and
higher education core curriculums worldwide to raise awareness, improve
climate literacy, and empower learners to take action. We also need more
immediate efforts to protect, restore, or rewild ecosystems.

The surge in yearly climate disasters shows we are in a major crisis
with worse to come if we continue with business as usual. Today, more
than ever, our actions matter for the stable climate system that has
supported us for thousands of years. Humanity\'s future depends on our
creativity, moral fiber, and perseverance. We must urgently reduce
ecological overshoot and pursue immediate large-scale climate change
mitigation and adaptation to limit near-term damage. Only through
decisive action can we safeguard the natural world, avert profound human
suffering, and ensure that future generations inherit the livable world
they deserve. [[The future of humanity hangs in the
balance.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Additionally, sanctions are restricting Russian military capabilities and budget in Ukraine now

The Efficacy of Sanctions on Russia's Economy

[The [sanctions imposed]{.mark} by Coalition nations have unequivocally
[impaired Russia's economic capabilities, constraining]{.mark} its
[capacity]{.mark} to sustain [its military endeavors in
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2022, Russia's [GDP experienced
a ]{.underline}[contraction](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/impact-sanctions-russian-economy/#:~:text=The%20Russian%20economy%20is%20shrinking&text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20in,continue%20to%20shrink%20in%202023.)[ of
2.1 percent]{.underline}, and while it was able to [regain
growth]{.underline} as the war dragged on, this growth [was the result
of its shift to a war economy built on the production (followed by
destruction) of weapons of war.]{.underline}

The [[breadth and depth]{.mark} of these sanctions have been
[unprecedented]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As of January 2024, over
[16,000 restrictions have been placed]{.underline} on Russian
individuals and entities, making Russia the most sanctioned country in
the world. Approximately [[70 percent of assets]{.mark} within the
Russian banking system [are]{.mark} now [under sanctions, crippling its
financial sector]{.mark}.]{.underline} Key figures in the Russian
government, military officials, and oligarchs have [faced [asset freezes
and travel bans]{.mark}, further [limit]{.mark}ing Russia's [economic
maneuverability.]{.mark}]{.underline} Between these frozen assets and
[the impact of [the oil price cap,]{.mark} the Coalition has already
[deprived Russia of more than \$500 billion]{.mark} that [it could have
put]{.mark} [toward]{.mark} its [war effort]{.mark}.]{.underline} On top
of this, sanctions and export controls on coalition products have
[reduced Russia's access to critically needed components and have [made
it pay markups]{.mark} upwards of 10 times world prices for key
industrial inputs.]{.underline}

As a result of these Coalition actions[, [inflation and interest
rates]{.mark} have [surged]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Russia's
central bank has raised interest rates to [21
percent](https://www.cbr.ru/eng/press/keypr/) as of February 2025 to
counteract inflation, which has [[eroded purchasing power]{.mark} and
weakened domestic demand]{.underline}. Additionally, [workforce
shortages have emerged as skilled laborers have either fled the country,
been absorbed into the military production sector, or have become active
participants in the war.]{.underline} The Center for European Policy
Analysis [estimates](https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/addicted-to-war-undermining-russias-economy/) that
"between 10,000 and 30,000 workers join the army every month, about 0.5
percent of the total supply."

#### However, Arctic resources allow Russia to circumvent sanctions while boosting their economic and military power, wrecking deterrence power in Ukraine

//AChiong

[[Russia\']{.mark}s full-scale [invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} has
[reestablished the relevance of NATO]{.mark} and its commitment to
[deterring]{.mark} Russian [aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline} An increase
in weapons sales and allied training drills represents a renewed
interest by European countries in the continent\'s security. Yet, even
as Russia\'s military has become bogged down through operational and
strategic failures in Ukraine, its navy has been able to operate freely.
While some losses have occurred in the Black Sea due to Ukrainian drone
strikes, the impact on Russia\'s operational ability is relatively
insignificant if not humiliating.

[The [capability of]{.mark} the Russian [navy]{.mark}, coupled with the
evident effects of climate change in the Arctic which has
[reduced]{.mark} the [ice pack, opens]{.mark} the potential for [a new
battleground]{.mark}]{.underline} and strategic challenge for Europe
that NATO has been reluctant to engage in for decades. The growing
threat of Russian influence in the Arctic Circle means that NATO must
adapt its way of thinking to address this growing security concern. 

[Vladimir [Putin\'s]{.mark} 2035 [Arctic Strategy refocuses]{.mark} the
nation\'s [efforts to exploit vast]{.mark} [northern riches]{.mark} that
are becoming more accessible due to melting permafrost caused by climate
change]{.underline}. Putin [hopes to use these Arctic resources [such as
oil and heavy metals to boost the economy]{.mark} and renew, [expand,
and develop military facilities]{.mark} across its Arctic
territory,]{.underline} mainly but not exclusively [[centered on
the]{.mark} [N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea [R]{.mark}oute]{.underline}.
In October of 2023, Russia\'s Northern Fleet was stripped of its title
as an \"interspecific strategic territorial association,\" and Russia
transferred its four constituent regions to the reformed [Leningrad
Military
District.](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-nato-finland-baltic-states-war-1833010) The
recreation of the Leningrad Military District, stationed close to
Finland and NATO territory, suggests that [Russia is preparing for
possible conflict with the Baltic States
and ]{.underline}[NATO](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-nato-finland-baltic-states-war-1833010/)[.
Finland shares an 800-mile border with Russia, making it the most
vulnerable but also strategically threatening NATO country to Russian
aggression in the Arctic region.]{.underline} Following the invasion of
Ukraine, there was concern that Finland would be the next target.
However, those fears have mostly alleviated given Finland's new NATO
protection and the fact that many of the Russian troops once stationed
along the border were sent to Ukraine, leaving a scarce Russian military
presence in the North. 

Multiple Arctic and near-Arctic islands like Svalbard (Norway), the
Faroe Islands and Greenland (Denmark) operate with a high level of
autonomy but do not have their own national defence. In each case,
[[Moscow has expanded its influence]{.mark} with little resistance from
Oslo or Copenhagen. The 1920 Svalbard Treaty gave Norway sovereignty of
Svalbard Island, but allowed Russia to legally mine coal since Russia
was a
treaty ]{.underline}[signatory](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/arctic-mining-svalbard-russia/?cf-view).
However, [Russia has [invited Chinese companies to partake in these
mining operations,]{.mark} which [increases the influence of another
autocracy in strategically sensitive
areas]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Currently, [Svalbard is home to
China\'s Yellow River
Research ]{.underline}[Station](https://www.mining-technology.com/features/arctic-mining-svalbard-russia/?cf-view)[.]{.underline}
Although it is understandable that NATO is more concerned with the
ground and air operations in Ukraine, [[a renewed focus and]{.mark}
overwhelming [show of force must be conducted in the Arctic]{.mark} that
[establishes NATO dominance to discourage further incursion]{.mark} by
Russian warships and joint economic ventures between the Kremlin and
China. ]{.underline}

[Past views that the Arctic did not fall within NATO\'s strategic
concern]{.underline} due to a limited number of countries having
significant Arctic territory [are now outdated]{.underline}, with the
induction of Finland into the treaty and Sweden likely to soon follow.
This [new NATO presence and the increased access to shipping lanes in
the Arctic will inevitably lead to a rise in transatlantic
competition]{.underline} among corporations and countries seeking to
exploit this economic opportunity. A focus on keeping the ships of
Russia and its allies out of Arctic waters is important. [[Arctic
resources provide economic commodities for Russia]{.mark} that pose the
potential [to undermine global sanctions aimed at weakening its economy
after]{.mark} the full-scale invasion of [Ukraine.
]{.mark}]{.underline}[If]{.mark} Russian-allied ships could enter
Russian ports through the Arctic lanes, Russia would have an increased
ability to import and export goods necessary for their war effort.

[NATO\'s strategic planning would be wise to incorporate additional
joint allied operations in Arctic conditions]{.underline}, as well as
allow Finland and Sweden to play an influential role in defensive
planning for Northern territory due to the military capability in that
region. [[Containing Russian]{.mark} influence and [expansion is vital
in]{.mark} securing a peaceful future for Europe and [depriving Russia

#### Russian victory in Ukraine sparks global hotspots and proliferation

There are human activities in which both sides can win. War is not one
of them.
[Either ]{.underline}[Ukraine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine)[ wins
this war or Russia does. Ukraine's former foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba
says bluntly that unless the current trajectory is changed, "we will
lose this war."]{.underline}

To be clear: [this is still avoidable]{.underline}. Suppose the roughly
four-fifths of Ukrainian territory still controlled by Kyiv gets
military commitments from the West strong enough to deter any further
Russian advances, secure large-scale investment in economic
reconstruction, encourage Ukrainians to return from abroad to rebuild
their country, and allow for stable, pro-European politics and reform.
In five years, the country joins the EU, and then, under a new United
States administration, starts the process of entering NATO. Most of
Ukraine becomes a sovereign, independent, free country, firmly anchored
in the West.

[[The loss of]{.mark} a large amount of [territory, the
suffering]{.mark} of at least 3.5 million Ukrainians living under
Russian occupation [and the toll of dead,]{.mark} maimed and traumatised
[would amount to a terrible cost.]{.mark}]{.underline} This would not be
the complete victory Ukrainians have hoped for and deserve; but it would
still be a victory for Ukraine and a historic defeat
for [Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia). A majority of
Ukrainians could come to see it as such. In polling the Kyiv
International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) has shared with me in
advance, Ukrainians are asked if to end the war they could (albeit with
difficulty) accept the combination of economic reconstruction and
European Union and NATO membership for the current territory. In just
the past six months, the proportion saying yes has jumped from 47% to
64%.

However, to get to this outcome with Donald Trump in the White House
would require a European coalition-of-the-willing to make security
commitments of a size and boldness not seen so far. There is a growing
understanding of this among European leaders, but the democratic
politics in most European countries are miles away from empowering them
to do it. To try to persuade Europeans to support the necessary
policies, but also to understand the consequences if---as seems most
likely---they don't do so in time, the question we have to ask is: what
if Russia wins?

[[If Russia wins]{.mark}, we should realistically expect the following
consequences for Ukraine, Europe, the US, and world peace]{.underline}.
Ukraine would be defeated, divided, demoralised and depopulated. The
money would not come in to reconstruct the country; instead, another
wave of people would leave it. [The [politics would become
rancorous,]{.mark} with a strong anti-Western trend. New possibilities
for Russian [disinformation and political destabilisation]{.mark} would
[emerge.]{.mark}]{.underline} Necessary reforms would stall, and hence
also progress towards EU membership.

[Europe as a whole would see an [escalation of the hybrid war]{.mark}
that [Russia is already waging]{.mark} against it,]{.underline} still
largely unnoticed by most blithely Christmas-shopping western Europeans.
Not a week passes without some incident: [a Russian

a top German arms manufacturer]{.underline}. Not all can definitely be
traced back to Moscow, but many can.

[Full-spectrum hybrid warfare includes [election
interference.]{.mark}]{.underline} In Georgia, the election was rigged.
In the [[Moldova]{.mark}n EU referendum]{.underline}, about 9% of the
votes were directly bought by Russia, [according to the
president](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2024/10/21/moldovas-president-alleges-vote-buying-tainted-eu-referendum-results),
Maia Sandu. [In [Romania,]{.mark}]{.underline} the first round of the
presidential election will be re-run, because [a court

cries the complacent Christmas shopper in Madrid, Rome or Düsseldorf.
[But the head of Germany's domestic security
service ]{.underline}[recently
warned](https://www.thelocal.de/20241217/election-bound-germany-braces-for-russian-disinformation-threat)[ that
Russia will try to interfere in February's German general election,
which is hardly marginal to the future of Europe.]{.underline}

In December we saw president [Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} again
supremely confident in his annual end-of-year marathon press conference
cum Call-the-Tsar phone-in, despite the [recent Ukrainian
assassination](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/dec/17/lieutenant-general-igor-kirillov-russian-general-killed-moscow-explosion-chemical-weapons) of
his WMD general. [His [is]{.mark} now [a war economy, dependent
on]{.mark} [military production for]{.mark} sustaining [growth]{.mark},
and a dictatorship [defined by confrontation with the
West]{.mark}.]{.underline} It would be [beyond [naive to hope]{.mark}
that [diplomacy]{.mark} can [achieve]{.mark} some [magic]{.mark}al
moment [when Putin's]{.mark} Russia will suddenly become "[satisfied"
with]{.mark} an outcome in [Ukraine,]{.mark}]{.underline} and return to
peacetime business as usual. [When [NATO planners]{.mark} say we should
be ready for possible Russian aggression against NATO territory by 2029,
they [are not]{.mark} simply [peddling horror stories]{.mark} so as to
increase military budgets.]{.underline}

Maga voters in the US may say "well, what's all that to us? You
Europeans look after yourselves! We have to worry about China". [But
[Russia is]{.mark} now [working]{.mark} more [closely]{.mark} than ever
[with China, North Korea and Iran]{.mark}.]{.underline} Putin may be
indicted by the international criminal court, but he still travels half
the world as a welcome guest. [He himself has [talked of a]{.mark} new
"global majority" and "the formation of a completely [new world
order]{.mark}." In that new order, [war]{.mark} and territorial conquest
are entirely acceptable instruments of policy,]{.underline} on a
continuum with [[poisoning, sabotage, disinformation and election
interference]{.underline}]{.mark}. Victory for Russia in Ukraine will
[[encourage China]{.mark} to step up its pressure [on Taiwan and North
Korea]{.mark} its [needling]{.mark} of [South
Korea.]{.mark}]{.underline}

That brings us to [the [most serious consequence]{.mark} of all:
[nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. Remember that
[[Ukraine]{.mark} voluntarily [gave up]{.mark} its [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapons in 1994, in return [for security assurances]{.mark} from the US,
the United Kingdom and Russia]{.underline}---and then got hammered by
one of the powers that promised it security[. In the [latest]{.mark}
KIIS [polling, 73% of Ukrainians support]{.mark} Ukraine "[restoring
nuclear weapons]{.mark}".]{.underline} Remarkably[, 46% say they would
do so even if the West imposed sanctions and stopped aid.]{.underline}
In effect, Ukrainians are saying to the West[: [if you won't defend us,
we'll]{.mark} \[expletive deleted\] [do it
ourselves]{.mark}.]{.underline} On recent visits to Ukraine I've been
told several times, "It's NATO or nukes!" [But this is not just about
Ukraine. [Vulnerable countries around the world]{.mark}, also [looking
at what is happening]{.mark} in the Middle East, will [draw the same
conclusion. The more]{.mark}]{.underline} countries---and possibly
[non-state [actors---acquire nuc]{.mark}lear weapons, the more certain
it is that one day [they will be used.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the [German election, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been shamelessly and
shamefully trying to exploit the fear of nuclear war for electoral
advantage]{.underline} over his [chief
rival](https://ecfr.eu/article/the-likely-lads-why-merzs-new-political-generation-will-decide-germanys-future/),
the Christian Democrat Friedrich Merz. In fact, [it is precisely the
consequences of the West's self-deterrence for fear of Russian nuclear
escalation in Ukraine]{.underline}, personified by Scholz and skilfully
exploited by Putin, [that are [increasing]{.mark} the likelihood of
nuclear proliferation and therefore the [long-term risk of nuclear
war.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The conclusion is clear, and depressingly familiar. European
democracies' reluctance to pay a high price now means that the world
will pay an even higher price later.

Weapons Is A Bad Idea,"

There is nothing automatic about the [[nuclear domino
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}, and it has been successfully countered in
some regions, but the theory [[is]{.mark} generally
[correct]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[Soviet Union]{.underline}]{.mark}
got the bomb because, as Stalin told his scientists after Hiroshima,
"[The balance has been broken]{.underline}. Build the bomb. [It will
remove the great danger from us." [Britain]{.mark} and [France]{.mark}
got the bomb because the Soviets (and the U.S.) had it. [China]{.mark}
did the same, then [India]{.mark} got the bomb because China did;
[Pakistan]{.mark} because India did.]{.underline}

Nuclear competition in Asia would not end if South Korea decided to
build a nuclear arsenal. [[Others in the region]{.mark} would likely
[follow suit]{.mark}.]{.underline} Japan, Taiwan, perhaps Vietnam.
Similarly, a Saudi bomb would likely beget an Iranian bomb, a Turkish
bomb and even an Egyptian bomb. Far from making the region --- and the
United States --- safer, these [[arms races]{.mark} would [blanket the
globe with nuclear tripwires]{.mark}, each primed to [unleash]{.mark}
unprecedented [destruction at the slightest twitch.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Where you stand determines what you see. Kennedy and the other
presidents stood atop the chain of command, and their own experiences
with that awful responsibility (particularly with the near-miss of the
Cuban Missile Crisis) colored how they saw [nuclear
politics.]{.underline} They recognized the limitations of theory in a
world characterized by imperfect information and the frictions of human
interaction. They understood what the nuclear theorists could not ---
[that [more]{.mark} countries having [nuc]{.mark}lear weapons would only
[increase the risk]{.mark} of their use, [not lessen
it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Three months before the Cuban Crisis, Kennedy's Secretary of Defense,
Robert McNamara, gave a speech in Ann Arbor, Michigan where he laid out
this danger. "[The mere fact that no nation could rationally take steps
leading to nuclear war does not guarantee that a nuclear war cannot take
place]{.underline}," he said. "Not only do nations sometimes act in ways
that are hard to explain on a rational basis, but [[even when
acting]{.mark} in a ['rational' way]{.mark} they sometimes, indeed
disturbingly often[, act on the basis of misunderstandings]{.mark} of
the true facts of a situation. They misjudge the way others will react,
and the way others will interpret what they are doing."]{.underline}

[Any [attempt to rationalize nuclear relationships]{.mark} --- treating
adversaries like two sides of a balanced equation --- [removes the human
factor]{.mark}: the [tendency towards irrationality]{.mark} and error.
In [a world with]{.mark} just a handful of [nuclear states,]{.mark} that
factor has already nearly led to apocalypse. In a world with a dozen
more, those [risks]{.mark} would [go up
exponentially.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It does not have to be this way. For over 50 years, since the signing of
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, successful diplomacy, security
assurances, and global norms have largely kept nuclear proliferation at
bay. [[The nightmare scenario]{.mark} of dozens of nuclear
states]{.underline} has so far been averted, in no small part through
the conscious and continual effort of American presidential
administrations of both parties. Yes, there will always be those who
advocate for more nuclear weapons in more hands. But the forces of
restraint, and with it, survival, have prevailed and can continue to
prevail if U.S. policy leads the way.

[Discussions of escalation in the war between Ukraine and Russia have
become more frequent in recent months.]{.underline} One such discussion
occurred in September during Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's
latest visit to Washington, when some government officials and analysts
emphasized the risk of nuclear war between NATO and Russia.

[The [possibility of nuclear war growing out]{.mark} of this conflict
[is a serious concern]{.mark}. But an [all-out nuclear war is
not]{.mark} necessarily [the only,]{.mark} or most likely,
[means]{.mark} by which [this war could]{.mark} expand and
[escalate]{.mark} up [to nuclear use]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
controversy surrounding Ukrainian demands for permission to use NATO
long-range missiles for attacks deeper into Russia poses a major risk of
escalation. Likewise, changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine as the war
continues---and its interpretation by Western allies---could make a
nuclear first use more likely. Finally, non-nuclear forms of expansion
of the war---whether they have already occurred or not---could pose
significant challenges in moving toward de-escalation and an eventual
peace agreement.

[As the [war drags on]{.mark}]{.underline} and pivots to a war of
attrition, [[non-nuclear forms of expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}---be
they horizontal, informational, technological, or
moral---[[increase]{.mark} the [likelihood of inadvertent use of]{.mark}
[nuc]{.mark}lear weapons or other weapons of mass
destruction.]{.underline}

[[Muddling with Western]{.mark} long-range
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In September, US Secretary of
State Antony Blinken and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy came to Kyiv
to show support for Ukraine. When they arrived, the two officials were
handed an open letter signed by 17 former British and American officials
and other experts calling for urgent changes to the policy concerning US
and UK missiles provided to Ukraine for use against Russia.

The specific issue was that the [United States and the United
Kingdom]{.underline}, which made available to Ukraine ATACMS (Army
Tactical Missile System) and Storm Shadow long-range missiles, [placed
restrictions on the use of these missiles against targets deep into
Russian territory]{.underline} and that these restrictions [allegedly
reduce the effectiveness of these missiles at a critical time in the war
for
Ukraine.]{.underline}[^\[1\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn1)

These [[experts and diplomats]{.mark} are not alone in
[criticiz]{.mark}ing the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and its NATO
allies [for]{.mark} mistakenly [softening]{.mark} their level of
[commitment to support Ukraine]{.mark} in its war against
Russia.]{.underline} According to Anastasia Edel, a Russian-born
American writer and social historian, Putin has victory within reach
because of insufficient US and allied commitment to a winning strategy.
"By first casting its lot with Ukraine and then failing to follow
through, America has lost its place as the bulwark of the West that can
guarantee protection and peace to its allies," Edel
wrote.[^\[2\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn2)

For his part, Russian President Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} again
[warned]{.mark} in early September that [allowing Ukraine to use]{.mark}
long-range [missiles provided by NATO]{.mark} to attack targets deeper
into Russia would redefine the political character of the war. According
to Putin, allowing Ukraine to fire Western weapons deep into Russia
[would mean]{.mark} nothing short of [direct
involvement:]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[This will mean that [NATO countries]{.mark}]{.underline}---the United
States and European countries---[are [at war with
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. And if this is the case, then, bearing in
mind the change in the essence of the conflict, we will [make
appropriate decisions in response to the threats that will be posed to
us.]{.underline}"[^\[3\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn3)

Putin offered two reasons for his contention. First, NATO member states
would have to provide Ukraine with the targeting data on Russia from
NATO satellites. Second, NATO specialists would have to enter the
targeting data into missile targeting systems because Ukrainians cannot
do it themselves. On the other hand, since 2023, Ukraine has been using
UK Storm Shadows and French-made Scalps against parts of Ukraine
controlled by Russian forces and/or places Russia claims as its
territory, such as Crimea.

Putin's concern, therefore, might be that the capabilities of the most
advanced versions of Storm Shadow and similar missiles would enable more
devastating attacks against Russian air bases and command facilities as
well as critical infrastructure deeper into Russia's mainland. According
to Simon Saradzhyan, the founding director of the Russian Matters
Project at Harvard University:

"It is the damage that Storm Shadows and Scalps could cause to Russia's
military-political infrastructure, as well as to the Kremlin's efforts
to make sure the war stays in the background of most Russians' lives so
that they remain content with his rule, [that may [cross Putin's red
line,]{.mark} triggering his 'appropriate' response to NATO
countries."]{.underline}[^\[4\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn4)

As Saradzhyan points out, [a Russian response might take the form of an
attack against transit facilities for these missiles in a NATO European
country]{.underline}, such as an air base in Poland. Such an attack
[could activate NATO's Article 5, effectively expanding the conflict to
a war between Russia and
NATO.]{.underline}[^\[5\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn5)

Russia could also move military assets, including depots and air bases,
even deeper into its territory as a passive instead of active response
to longer-range missile attacks.

[Changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine. Putin's comments are a reminder
of the numerous threats from the Kremlin since the beginning of Russia's
attack on Ukraine]{.underline}, especially over the possibility of a
nuclear first use. For example, in a September 1 interview, Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov noted that Russia is in the
process of [revising its doctrine on the use of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} and accused the West of fueling an "escalation" of
the war in
Ukraine.[^\[6\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn6)

However, some US experts, including generals and diplomats, dismissed
the possibility of Russian nuclear first use as lacking in credibility,
arguing that:

"After more than 900 days of war, we can safely assert that Russian
President Vladimir Putin's repeated threats are nothing less than an
attempt to deter Ukraine's partners from properly arming her. Easing the
restrictions on Western weapons will not cause Moscow to escalate. We
know this because Ukraine is already striking territory Russia considers
its own---including Crimea and Kursk---with these weapons and Moscow's
response remains
unchanged."[^\[7\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn7)

[[To restore deterrence credibility, Russia]{.mark} might [adjust its
military doctrine]{.mark} concerning justifications [for nuclear first
use]{.mark} to include Ukrainian attacks on critical military and civil
infrastructure targets with long-range conventional
weapons.]{.underline}

Russia's nuclear doctrine on "Basic Principles of State Policy of the
Russian Federation on Nuclear Deterrence" was adopted in 2020. The
document provided for two main scenarios under which Russia can use
nuclear weapons: first, [in response to an attack on the Russian
Federation]{.underline} and/or its allies with nuclear or other weapons
of mass destruction; or, second, [[in response to]{.mark} an attack with
[conventional weapons]{.mark} when the very survival of the Russian
state is at
risk.]{.underline}[^\[8\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn8)

In a meeting with the Russian Federation Security Council standing
conference on nuclear deterrence on September 25, Putin proposed several
updates to Russia's nuclear doctrine. First, he suggested that [nuclear
strategy should [treat "aggression against Russia by]{.mark} any
[non-nuclear state]{.mark}, but [with]{.mark} the participation and
support of [a nuclear state," as a joint attack]{.mark}]{.underline}
that could motivate Russia to cross the nuclear threshold. He then added
that, after having received reliable information about any "massive"
missile attack against Russia or its ally, Belarus, Russia would also
consider resorting to a nuclear
option.[^\[9\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn9)

Russian academic and nuclear policy expert Alexei Arbatov has argued
that [prolonging the war in Ukraine has led to a widespread
misconception about escalation,]{.underline} both in the West and in
Russia.[^\[10\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn10) The
first mistaken assumption deals with the view of experts and officials
in Western allies that [there is no upper limit to NATO-supported
Ukrainian attacks into Russian territory with conventional weapons
without producing a nuclear response from Russia.]{.underline} In short,
Russia has no red line. The second erroneous assumption, widely held
among an "active political and expert lobby of fans of nuclear weapons"
in Russia, Arbatov suggests, is that a very selective use of nuclear
weapons by Russia will not be followed by a major war with NATO. The
West will be sufficiently scared and back down.

But for Arbatov, what would follow even a limited Russian nuclear first
use may be very different from what Russian leaders have in mind:

"NATO will openly enter the war and carry out at least a massive strike
with conventional high-precision long-range weapons on both new and old
territories of the Russian Federation. This will be followed by group
nuclear strikes from the Russian side on NATO countries. In response,
there will be a massive nuclear and conventional strike on Russia. We
will not even be able to determine what is flying at us, and we will not
have time to call the White House---contrary to the scenarios of Russian
enthusiasts of a limited nuclear strike. It will be impossible to
control the course of
events."[^\[11\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn11)

Of course, much of this speculation is scenario-dependent.

[Russian [military expert and deterrence theorist]{.mark} Dmitri Adamsky
[analyzes Russian threats of nuclear escalation]{.mark} as part of a
[cross-domain "coercion cocktail]{.mark}"]{.underline} that accompanies
conventional war-fighting without necessarily committing the Kremlin to
any specific future action. According to Adamsky, a Russian slide from
nuclear rhetoric into the reality of nuclear first use would not
necessarily be abrupt. [It might go through several phases of
demonstrative "muscle flexing" and "strategic gestures" designed to
signal preparedness for escalation]{.underline}, if necessary, but in
gradual, and potentially reversible, steps---if favorable indications
come from the other side. In this view, the West would need to take
notice of these measures, process that information, and act
accordingly---that is, as desired by Russia---to de-escalate the
situation.[^\[12\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn12)

[Other forms of war expansion.]{.underline} The prevailing assumption in
many discussions about the expansion of the war in Ukraine is that it
would necessarily be [[a vertical escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, that
is, an increase in the level of destruction imposed on one side's
military or other assets by another. But this assumption is too
restrictive concerning military or other options available to NATO and
Russia.

First, either side might resort to horizontal escalation. [[Horizontal
escalation]{.mark} occurs when one or [both parties to a war extend
military actions or capacity]{.mark} for coercive bargaining and
deterrence into another country or territory.]{.underline} Russia has
already done this once by [deploying some of its military forces into
Belarus, including nuclear-capable tactical launch systems. From
Russia's standpoint, NATO's extension of its membership, which now
includes Sweden and Finland, might be considered a form of horizontal
escalation,]{.underline} especially given Finland's elongated border
with Russia.

Russia's [[increasing]{.mark} military and diplomatic [ties with
China]{.mark} provide another [possible example of horizontal
escalation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Although China has no intention to get
involved in direct military action in Ukraine or elsewhere in Europe, it
supports Russia's efforts to push back against the rule-based
international order dominated by the United States. According to the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence, China has become an
even more critical economic partner for Russia since February 2022,
providing Russia with a variety of economic support mechanisms to
mitigate the impact of Western sanctions and export controls. In
addition, [[China is]{.mark} probably [supplying]{.mark} Russia with
[key technology]{.mark} and dual-use equipment for the war in
Ukraine.]{.underline}[^\[13\]^](https://thebulletin.org/2024/10/how-the-fog-of-war-in-ukraine-increases-the-risk-of-escalation/#_ftn13)[ Russia
has [also]{.mark} received significant military assistance [from North
Korea and Iran.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [war could also expand through]{.mark} other forms, including
[disinformation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Both Russia and Ukraine have
extensive networks of information warfare at their disposal, and [their
governments, allies, and other supporters blanket the internet with
reports favorable to their respective sides]{.underline}. A war of
memes, trolls, bots, and other artifacts of the information age has
become intertwined with the kinetic war of infantry, armor, artillery,
and air strikes---back and forth.

Sometimes [[military tactics]{.mark} appear to have been [dictated by
the information war]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} as was the case of
Ukraine's sudden strike into Kursk oblast with the objectives of shaking
the Kremlin's self-confidence and preparing an improved bargaining
position in possible peace negotiations. For its part, Russian
information warfare seeks to undermine the confidence of the American
population in Ukraine and even in the US democratic political system,
especially during a presidential election year.

[The **security landscape** of the [Arctic]{.mark} is
**[changing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After almost three decades as an
afterthought in the eyes of U.S. policymakers, Arctic security is
finally catching the attention of American leadership. [[Rapid **climate
change**]{.mark} and [increased **military**]{.mark} and non-military
[interest]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region, even from non-Arctic
nations, [[calls for **increased coordination**
between]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} in
order [to maintain **strategic** initiative in]{.mark} the **high
[north]{.mark}**. This should be done through a **unified
command**]{.underline}: a NATO-led Arctic Command.

Finland's ascension and Sweden's bid for NATO membership mean that soon
-- hopefully -- [[all Arctic nations]{.mark} aside from
**Russia**]{.underline} will be [[members of]{.mark} the
[Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [[countries have]{.mark} **deeply
[vested]{.mark}** security [concerns in]{.mark} the [region]{.mark} and
most consider it a **cornerstone** of their security
policy]{.underline}. Even the United States is starting to realize the
importance of the area, as shown by the publishing of its new Arctic
Security Strategy last year, the first one in almost a decade. The
United States' establishment of the position of Ambassador-at-large to
the Arctic further indicates that it is prioritizing Arctic security.
The [[increasing importance]{.mark} of the Arctic region]{.underline}
for the security policy of many countries, particularly NATO members,
has [[resulted in]{.mark} a [**renewed focus** on Arctic
security]{.mark} and [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although
Alliance member countries may differ on matters such as Arctic
environmental policy, resource development, and fisheries control, their
security strategies all reflect a similar tune of threat
deterrence, economic development, and cooperation.

A [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} Arctic [[Command]{.mark} could
[help]{.mark} to realize and **[coordinate]{.mark}** most of the
[Arctic]{.mark} countries' **[strategic]{.mark}** and
**[national]{.mark} security** [goals for the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their [[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}
could be [**[pooled]{.mark}** and [**utilized** in]{.mark} a more
**[cohesive]{.mark} [manner]{.mark}**]{.underline} similar to other NATO
commands such as the Joint Force Commands in Brunssum or Naples or the
Allied Maritime Command. The command could help [[facilitate]{.mark} and
[streamline **info**]{.mark}**rmation sharing**, **[intel]{.mark}ligence
analysis**, and **[collaboration]{.mark}** among the member nations. It
could also [provide]{.mark} a [platform for]{.mark} more
[extensive]{.mark} joint **[exercises]{.mark}** and
**[training]{.mark}**]{.underline} than has been seen before in the
region, as has been the case for NATO's Allied Maritime Command.

NATO's Competitors

NATO's most immediate adversary in the region is the Russian Federation.
Despite being only one of eight Arctic countries, [[Russia
controls]{.mark} roughly [**53%** of the Arctic]{.mark}
coastline]{.underline}. They [consider the Arctic their **[core]{.mark}
[territory]{.mark}**]{.underline} and have been hesitant to work with
others on regional projects. Russia has its own
[[ambitious]{.mark} Arctic [policy]{.mark} where it [aims to
become]{.mark} the **[pivotal power]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the
region. [Russia [plans to achieve this through]{.mark} expansive
[infra]{.mark}structure and development]{.underline} projects with the
[final goal of [gain]{.mark}ing [access to]{.mark} strategically
important **[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} both on land and in the
Arctic Sea. A secondary aim of the policy also seems to be to [improve
the **[N]{.mark}**]{.underline}orthern **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**oute, making Russia a key player in trade
between Asia and Europe. If fully realized, this would improve Russia's
strategic position even further and leave most of Europe vulnerable to
potential future Russian sanctions.

The [[region]{.underline}]{.mark} is also [[home to]{.underline}]{.mark}
most of [[Russia's
**nuclear-powered** vessels]{.underline}]{.mark} including its two
Kirov-class battlecruisers, [all its **nuclear [icebreakers]{.mark}**,
and eight out of eleven active ballistic missile submarines
(**[SSBNs]{.mark}**). This means much of its [**second-strike**
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} are located in the Arctic, mostly
[[around]{.mark} the **[Kola peninsula]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
north-western Russia. Such a large force presence in the Arctic [[gives
Russia **significant**]{.mark} strategic
[advantages]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the ability to project power
and influence in the region and to potentially [[control]{.mark} key
**[sea lanes]{.mark}** and **[shipping]{.mark}** routes]{.underline}.
Areas like the strategically important GIUK gap could be left severely
vulnerable if these forces are not properly monitored.

A [[second competitor]{.mark} that has started to dip its toe into the
Arctic is **[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite holding no Arctic
territory, [China has [persistently pursued]{.mark} active
**[participation]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Arctic affairs. Since 2013,
China has been an observer state to the Arctic Council and has
participated in the Arctic Circle forum since its inception. U.S.
scholars have noted that China is actively [[building up]{.mark} its
[capacity]{.mark} to "enforce its **perceived rights** and protect its
**interests** through an [increasingly **security-focused** Arctic
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} that is [[backed up by]{.mark} the
**[military]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Multiple NATO member states
have raised concerns over China's high aspirations in the region,
singling them out as a threat to Arctic stability. The country even
[[considers itself]{.underline}]{.mark} to be a "near-Arctic power" that
deserves **[[equal]{.underline}]{.mark}** representation and status
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates and **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in Arctic affairs.

**[[No country]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even the United States, [[wants
to face these]{.underline}]{.mark} competitors [[alone. This is
where]{.mark} the [unified]{.mark} Arctic [Command comes
in]{.mark}]{.underline}.

NATO's Interest in the Arctic

The Arctic is fast becoming a new hotspot for geopolitics. The region
has historically been free from conflict, even during the Cold War. This
is no longer the case. With the potential ascensions of Sweden and
Finland into the Alliance, seven out of the eight Arctic countries will
be NATO member states. This doesn't necessarily make the Arctic NATO's
backyard, but it is definitely in NATO's neighborhood. The Alliance has
been making a note of this, as member states have paid more attention to
the region in recent years at both the national and international
levels. Last year, for example, saw the United States re-designate its
U.S. Army Alaska Command to be upgraded to division level, the 11th
Airborne Division, along with the NATO Secretary General making
a dedicated visit to the Canadian Arctic for the first time.

[[NATO's interest]{.mark} in the Arctic is [twofold:
**proximity**]{.mark} and **[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
Arctic has [[two main sea lanes]{.mark} of entry and exit,
[through]{.mark} the **[North Atlantic]{.mark}**]{.underline} between
Greenland, Iceland, and Norway, [and the [Bering Strait]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} Russia and **[Alaska]{.mark}**. Entering through
**either** of these means]{.underline} passing through **[[NATO
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}**, highlighting the region's proximity to
member nations and strategic importance for NATO. The region is becoming
increasingly more accessible to both Arctic and non-Arctic countries due
to melting sea ice, which is opening up new shipping routes and easing
access to natural resources such as oil, gas, and rare earth minerals.
This has increased interest and competition in the region, giving NATO a
reason to bolster its own regional presence to monitor the situation.

NATO's more prevalent interest in the Arctic is deterrence, primarily
aimed at Russia. As interest in the region has increased,
[[Russia]{.mark} has been more [aggressively asserting]{.mark} its
[claims]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region and increasing its military
activities. This is most frequently done through [[**airspace**
violations, **naval** encroachment]{.mark},
and **[intel]{.mark}**ligence gathering]{.underline}. Although these
efforts are understandable to an extent, NATO should not let them pass.
These [[aggressions]{.underline}]{.mark} are mainly [[aimed at
NATO]{.mark} member [states]{.mark}]{.underline}, which need to develop
an effective counter. This would be the [[Arctic Command's primary
goal]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region, [[to **counter**]{.mark}
Russian [aggression and **deter**]{.mark}]{.underline} them from further
encroachment, provocations, and other antagonistic actions.
[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[see]{.underline}]{.mark} this approach
[as **[escalatory]{.mark}** but]{.underline} we must keep in mind that
the [[individual Arctic countries]{.mark} [are **already doing
this**]{.mark}]{.underline} at a smaller, national level.
[[Enhancing]{.mark} the [scope]{.mark} of these sorts of actions will
**[send a message]{.mark}** to Russia]{.underline} and other actors
about how committed NATO is to respect for territorial integrity and
security in the Arctic.

Arctic Command Structure

The Arctic [[Command]{.underline}]{.mark} would primarily [[consist of
**naval**]{.mark} and [**air assets** stationed in]{.mark} and around
the **[Arctic]{.mark}** Circle]{.underline}. The Command would be
[[headquartered out of]{.underline}]{.mark} two
[[locations]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [[in **Alaska**]{.mark}
and]{.underline} another in either eastern
**[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark}**, northern
**[[Iceland]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or
**[[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Additional [[bases strewn
around]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[Canadian
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Norway, Alaska, and Greenland would also
fall under the Command's control. The main tasks of the Command would be
[[**naval patrolling**, subm]{.mark}arine [**monitoring**,
**intel**]{.mark}ligence gathering]{.underline}, and **[[air
policing]{.underline}]{.mark}** along with secondary tasks such as
search and rescue as needed. It would also serve to [[ensure]{.mark} the
**[interoperability]{.mark}** of NATO forces stationed in the
Arctic]{.underline}, acting as the main voice of Arctic affairs in the
Alliance at the tactical level.

The goal of the Command would be to [[better coordinate
**activities**]{.mark}, **actions**, and **responses** to developing
situations in the Arctic on both sides of the ocean and to
**[streamline]{.mark}** the [flow]{.mark}]{.underline} of Arctic-related
information between allies. Arctic-specific training, especially at sea,
would also be an important aspect of the Command. Its structure would
closely follow that of NATO's Maritime Command, incorporating elements
from the Allied Air Command as well.

Through the Arctic Command, NATO would [[**consolidate** multinational
**security concerns**]{.mark} regarding the region and facilitate a
**coordinated** and **collaborative** decision-making
process]{.underline} for member states to resolve them. This
[[cooperation could even extend to]{.underline}]{.mark} collaborative
efforts outside the Alliance, such as joint [[resolutions on the
**Arctic Council**]{.mark} and [scientific **research
initiatives**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, the mere existence of
the Command and presence of NATO personnel in the region would hold
significant influence and send a strong message to the Alliance's
adversaries. Although [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} would always seek a
diplomatic solution first, the Alliance [[needs to be able to **credibly
enforce**]{.mark} a [**coherent** Arctic policy that
respects]{.mark}]{.underline} the international
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**ule **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[l]{.underline}]{.mark}**aw and institutional norms. [For this, the
[Arctic Command]{.mark} is a [perfect tool]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### NATO has [empirically]{.underline} been able to develop [cyber capabilities]{.underline} in the Arctic, but further [international cooperation]{.underline} is [key]{.underline}.

On 27-30 January, 2019, forty-five scholars and practitioners of
resilience, cybersecurity, and the Arctic met in Rovaniemi, Finland for
a NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme (SPS) Advanced Research
Workshop (ARW). Participants came from over 20 different countries,
including [[**NATO** member states]{.mark} as well as NATO [partner
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. The workshop [[brought together **top
scholars** in cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark} risk assessment,
governance, and resilience [[to discuss]{.mark} potential analytical and
governing **[strategies]{.mark}** and offer perspectives [of how to
improve]{.mark} critical **[digitalized Arctic infra]{.mark}structure**
[against]{.mark} various **anthropological** and **natural
[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It will discuss threats to digitized
infrastructure include anthropological (i.e. cyber-attack or misuse) as
well as natural (i.e. space weather or other extreme weather events).
Workshop participants were organized into three working groups: (A)
Arctic cybersecurity infrastructure and its threats; (B) metrics, tools,
and methods to understand and analyze Arctic cyber resilience, and (C)
legal frameworks and governance options to promote Arctic cyber
resilience.

Groups were challenged to address critical questions related to
resilience and Arctic cybersecurity (Figure 3). The sections below
include a brief synthesis of discussion found within each group. More
detailed analysis is included within each of the 'Working Group'
chapters (Chapters 4, 9, and 15).

[\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\>]{.underline}

Physical Infrastructure

[The [**melting** of]{.mark} Arctic [**ice** presents]{.mark} both new
opportunities for growth and new **[challenges]{.mark}** to overcome as
Arctic nations expand into this largely unexplored
territory]{.underline}. In the private sector, shipping and tourism
efforts benefit greatly from access to the Northwest Passages through
Canada and the Northeast Passages and/or Northern Sea Route above
Russia. [The [thaw]{.mark} also [exposes **oil**]{.mark} and **natural
[gas]{.mark}** [fields]{.mark}]{.underline} that could house up to a
quarter of the Earth\'s obtainable petroleum, [[offering]{.mark} an
[**incentive** for]{.mark} oil and natural gas [companies to **move
north**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And in the public sector, military
transportation, defense, and search and rescue operations will need to
keep pace with private sector growth. As these interest groups, both
civil and military, seek to operate in the Arctic, they will bring with
them the [[need for **expanded**]{.mark} **Arctic
[infra]{.mark}structure**, both temporary and permanent]{.underline}.

This additional infrastructure brings with it the [[potential for
**larger disasters** due to **cyber disruption**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
As one example, the **[Kolos Data Center]{.underline}** to be built in
Ballangen, Norway [plans to both take advantage of **hydroelectric
power** and use the **cold climate** to cool its servers]{.underline}.
However, the [[large amount of **data** stored]{.mark} there [makes
it]{.mark} a **prime [target]{.mark}** [for **hacking**]{.mark} or
**physical [attack]{.mark}**, and **[damage]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
the facility, whether cyber or physical, will be [[**difficult to
repair** due to]{.mark} the facility\'s **[remote location]{.mark}**.
Even **temporary infrastructure** could potentially pose
risks]{.underline}; consider the voyage of the American Crystal
Serenity, which in 2016 became the largest cruise ship ever to navigate
the Northwest Passage. While this voyage was successful, the potentially
disastrous results of the ship\'s onboard computer being hacked are
numerous, including loss of life of the passengers and spillage of oil
and other foreign materials into Arctic waters.

[The **[traditional]{.mark}** security [response to]{.mark} an
[attack]{.mark} by an outside enemy [is to \"**harden**\"]{.mark} the
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}, in order to prevent the enemy from
penetrating it. However, [[this approach]{.mark} to cyber security is
generally **[ineffective]{.mark}** in the long run; [more
necessary]{.mark} is **[resilience]{.mark}**, the ability for a system
to **recover** from **disruption** or **failure**]{.underline}. In terms
of the previous examples, resilience for the cruise ship means building
check-in stations along the ship\'s path and having search-and-rescue
and oil cleanup boats nearby to minimize damage. For the data center, it
means employing extra staff to correct errors introduced by hacking and
developing evacuation plans in case of physical emergency. [The
**[challenges]{.mark}** of Arctic]{.underline} infrastructure are not
unique to the Arctic, but they are certainly [[exacerbated by]{.mark}
its **[harsh conditions]{.mark}** and [must be handled
differently]{.mark} from challenges at **lower latitudes**]{.underline}.

Analytical Methods and Tools

In the modern era, all missions survive on data. A correct knowledge of
current environmental conditions, incoming threats, and available
resources is critical to any mission. In the case of Arctic operations,
where an error as innocuous as overestimating the outdoor temperature
could mean the difference between life and death, preserving the
integrity of critical data is especially vital. An instrument could
break, a detector could miss an incoming attack, or an adversary could
breach security and compromise the reliability of measuring systems. For
these situations, having a data collection system in place that is both
hard -- able to resist attack -- and resilient -- able to recover from
partial or total failure -- is essential.

Also worth considering is how to tell whether an Arctic operation is
sufficiently resilient in these types of disaster scenarios before the
operation even begins. [With improved **modeling** and **resiliency**
standards, Arctic missions could be assessed during their planning
phases to account for these conditions]{.underline}. Additionally, as
Arctic conditions become increasingly favorable to commercial activity,
resiliency standards could play a significant role in determining the
Arctic economic environment. Unfortunately, to date, [[there are **no
international standards** for Arctic **cyber
resilience**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [[lack of standards]{.mark} does
more than **[complicate modeling]{.mark}**; it [leaves]{.mark} Arctic
facilities with [**no clear guidelines** for what data they
need]{.mark}]{.underline} to collect to maintain operation and [[gives
them **no way** to validate that they are **operating
safely**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### [Info-sharing]{.underline}, establishing uniform [rules of engagement]{.underline}, and providing [technical assistance]{.underline} through an [Arctic Joint Command Center]{.underline} builds cyber resilience for [all NATO members]{.underline}.

Alongside investments in technology, [[allies need to **strengthen
education in cyber**]{.underline}]{.mark} matters, not only in
engineering, but also [in strategic thinking and social
use]{.underline}. [All military personnel have to be involved to [ensure
**greater** ]{.mark}**cybersecurity [awareness]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} a
[better integration]{.mark} of cyber capabilities [into military
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [most important challenge
for **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} as an alliance [is to [**bridge the
gap** between]{.mark} those [states]{.mark} with first-rate cyber
capabilities and awareness and those [that lag
behind]{.mark}]{.underline}. Currently, [a handful of member states are
pulling away]{.underline} from the others [in terms of the **mass
integration** of connected devices, quantum computing, and
a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence--[based
systems]{.underline}. This [gap]{.underline} could [have a major impact
on **burden sharing** in NATO]{.underline}, because a low level of
spending by one or more countries would need to be compensated by the
others to maintain a satisfactory global level for the alliance.

[Allies [should draw]{.mark} up national [**cyber rules of
engagement**]{.mark} for **offensive operations** in accordance
with]{.underline} principles of [international law]{.underline}.
[[Certain policies]{.mark} espoused by some member states, [such as
**hack-back**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which allows private firms to pursue
attackers into other companies' networks, [or cyber deterrence, could
[lead to **uncontrolled escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.67
International law tends to limit this escalation to mainly economic
responses, such as sanctions and countermeasures. All [NATO
allies]{.underline} also [need to ensure that their **rules of
engagement** are compatible with the [**alliance's agreed approach** to
cyber defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. [At present, different countries
have different views on offensive cyber policies]{.underline}, in
particular.

The [alliance should [give **technical assistance** to member
states]{.mark} that]{.underline} are willing to [**[share
info]{.mark}**rmation [and]{.mark} **national best
practices**]{.underline}. [NATO should [expand its **rapid-response**
]{.mark}**system** to cover attacks that blur the line
between]{.underline} the [military and nonmilitary]{.underline} realms,
such as an attack on critical nonmilitary networks in the context of a
NATO military mission.

[[Unity is important]{.mark} when it comes to **external
communications** by]{.underline} the [allies]{.underline}, [or by NATO's
secretary general, on **attribution**]{.underline}. While the decision
to attribute an attack to a particular entity remains a sovereign and
political one, [allies]{.underline} [should discuss any]{.underline}
such **[[communication]{.underline}]{.mark}** from individual capitals
before it is made. This [would]{.underline} not only [[prevent
**uncontrolled escalation**]{.underline}]{.mark} but [also preserve the
**strength** and **unity** of the alliance.]{.underline}

[[NATO should]{.mark} [develop **standards** on]{.mark} the security of
**[emerging]{.mark} cyber [tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nologies in close
partnership with the EU. [Allies could address the interoperability and
security of connected devices in the defense sector by **devising a
common policy** in the alliance]{.underline}. [NATO should also [impose
a minimum standard of]{.mark} **cyber[security]{.mark}** [in
products]{.mark}, [such as connected]{.mark} devices and [systems;
computer-based technologies; and]{.mark}]{.underline} command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (**[[C4ISR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [systems]{.underline}
during the acquisition process.

#### NATO says [yes]{.underline}\-\--prefer [official statements]{.underline} from the [chairman]{.underline} of their [military committee]{.underline}.

**NATO '23** \[North Atlantic Treaty Organization; October 20;
Intergovernmental transnational military alliance quoting Rob Bauer,
Chair of the NATO Military Committee; NATO, "'Arctic remains essential
to NATO's Deterrence and Defence Posture,\' says Chair of the NATO
Military Committee,"
<https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_219529.htm>\] nikhil

In his keynote speech for the Arctic Circle Assembly, [**Admiral
[Bauer]{.mark}** started by [sharing **NATO's view**]{.mark} on the
current security environment in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. "The
[[increased]{.mark} **competition** and [**militarisation** in]{.mark}
the [Arctic]{.mark} region, especially [by **Russia**]{.mark} and
**[China]{.mark}**, is **[concerning]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The melting
ice in the Arctic is creating new sea routes that would facilitate the
movement of large vessels and shorten navigation times.  We
[[cannot]{.mark} be naïve and [ignore]{.mark} the potentially
**[nefarious intentions]{.mark}**]{.underline} of some actors in the
region. We [[must remain **vigilant**]{.mark} and prepare for the
**unexpected**]{.underline}", he noted.

He then proceeded to explain the implications of the new Regional Plan
North, highlighting that "this plan specifically sees to the Atlantic
and European Arctic, and falls under the command of our newest Allied
Joint Force Command in Norfolk". "[**JFC Norfolk** sees to it that
[NATO]{.mark}'s force posture [**supports** Arctic operations]{.mark}
and [provides greater]{.mark} Arctic defence
**[coherence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}s
that [**[forces]{.mark}** and **[equipment]{.mark}** can [flow between
the continents]{.mark} in conflict and peace]{.underline} and protects
our freedom of navigation", the Chair also noted in his remarks.

In his meeting with the Icelandic Chief of Defence, Mr Jonas Allansson,
Admiral [[Bauer commended **Iceland**]{.mark} [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
its support and [[contributions]{.underline}]{.mark} to NATO.
"[[Iceland]{.underline}]{.mark} is a smaller nation with a smaller
population, but you still contribute meaningfully to our Alliance.
Amongst other things, you [[host]{.mark} strategic [NATO]{.mark} and
[Allied assets]{.mark}]{.underline}, you have personnel
[[deployed]{.mark} on our **[Eastern Flank]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
you [[increase]{.mark} our situational **[awareness]{.mark}** in the
**North Atlantic**]{.underline}. In addition, you show true leadership
on the Women, Peace and Security agenda. And you support key partners,
including Ukraine", he highlighted. 

Sitting down with Mr Bjarni Benediktsson, the Icelandic Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Admiral [[Bauer]{.underline}]{.mark} reiterated the key
role Iceland plays in the region, as a NATO Ally but also as a member of
the Arctic Council. "When Sweden joins, following in the footsteps of
Finland, seven of the eight members of the Arctic Council will be NATO
Allies. We are [[**grateful** to]{.mark} our [**Nordic Allies**
for]{.mark} their [enhanced cooperation, investment]{.mark} and
[vigilance]{.mark} in the region. The [Arctic]{.mark} has [always
had]{.mark} a **strategic [importance]{.mark}** [to
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, and we must ensure it remains free and
navigable", he added. Admiral Bauer and Minister Benediktsson also
exchanged views on security issues outside of the Arctic region,
especially those related to the war in Ukraine and the volatile
situation in the Middle East. 

Meeting with the Chairman of the Arctic Circle Assembly, Mr Ólafur
Ragnar Grímsson, Admiral [[Bauer praised]{.mark} the
**[quality]{.mark}** and [**value** of]{.mark} the
**[A]{.mark}**]{.underline}rctic **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ircle
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ssembly, as a platform officials, regional
actors and industry to come together and discuss key issues relating to
the Arctic. "In the last decade, the [**[growing]{.mark}
[importance]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} has been
**[undeniable]{.mark}**, especially [due to]{.mark} its natural
[**resources**, maritime **potential**]{.mark} and strategic
**[location]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, it is also a fragile
ecosystem on the planet and has been suffering from the effects of
climate change. Bringing experts from a variety of fields together to
share ideas, studies and discuss the varying interests in the region,
hopefully, helps leaders make better choices and builds understanding",
underscored the Admiral.

Why the Arctic matters

[[The Arctic is]{.mark} no longer]{.underline} an [indiscoverable and
frozen]{.underline} area [but a [**strategic arena** for]{.mark}
**global [energy]{.mark}** [and **trade**. The]{.mark}
region]{.underline} is estimated to hold 13% of the world's untapped oil
and 30% of its undiscovered natural gas reserves, a [[resource
base]{.underline}]{.mark} that [surpasses [Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia['s]{.mark} known]{.underline} petroleum [[deposits]{.mark}.
Simultaneously, **climate change** is accelerating **ice melting**,
making the Northern Sea Route]{.underline} (**[NSR]{.underline}**) [a
viable alternative for trade]{.underline} between Asia and Europe.

[For Russia, the Arctic]{.underline} is not just about energy and
shipping, but [is a **core component** of its **geopolitical strategy**.
[Moscow views the region as **essential** for]{.mark} **national
[security]{.mark}**, **economic [growth]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark} **global
[power projection]{.mark}**[. But]{.mark} Russia\'s]{.underline}
full-scale [invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2022, and the
ongoing war, have [significantly [reshaped]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia's
[[Arctic ambitions]{.mark}. Western [sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[[hindered]{.mark} Arctic]{.underline} energy [[projects, NATO]{.mark}
has [expanded]{.mark}]{.underline} its northern presence, [[and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[shifted]{.mark} its focus eastward,
[**strengthening ties** with **China**]{.mark}]{.underline} and other
Asian nations.

Russia's pre-war Arctic strategy

Before 2022, Russia's Arctic policy was guided by two key documents: the
2008 Arctic Strategy and the 2020 Arctic Policy. These documents
emphasised the region's role in Russia's economic security, and
geopolitical strategy.

[One pillar of Russia's]{.underline} Arctic [ambition is resource
extraction. The Arctic is rich in **oil**, **gas**, **minerals**, and
**rare earth metals**, and Moscow has invested heavily]{.underline} in
developing these reserves. State-backed energy giants such as Rosneft
and Gazprom have launched massive Arctic exploration projects. The NSR,
which Russia aims to develop into a competitive global shipping
corridor, controlling access and generating revenue from transit fees,
has also been a strategic focus.

[[Beyond economic ambitions, Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[prioritised **military security**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}.
In recent years, [Moscow has [reopened]{.mark}]{.underline} Soviet-era
[**military [bases]{.mark}**[, deployed]{.mark} advanced
**[radar]{.mark} systems**, [and expanded]{.mark} its fleet
of]{.underline} nuclear-powered **[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The Kremlin explains this military buildup as its response to growing
NATO presence in the Arctic.

Environmental protection has been part of Russia's Arctic rhetoric, but
economic and military priorities have often overshadowed sustainability
efforts. While Moscow claims to support Arctic conservation, Western
analysts argue that Russia's industrial activities pose significant
environmental risks.

[Despite]{.underline} geopolitical [tensions, [Russia previously
maintained cooperation]{.mark} with Arctic states]{.underline} such as
Canada, Norway, [and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. [The [Ukraine]{.mark} war [changed this
dynamic, **isolating Russia**]{.mark} from Western Arctic
institutions]{.underline}.

Postwar changes

[Russia\'s]{.underline} full-scale [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} in
2022 [triggered three significant shifts in Russia's Arctic policy:
**economic disruptions**]{.underline} as a result of Western sanctions,
[**increased militarisation**, and a **strategic pivot** towards
**Asia**]{.underline}.

First, Western sanctions devastated Russia's Arctic energy sector.
Companies like ExxonMobil and BP withdrew from Russian projects,
disrupting key oil and gas developments. Sanctions also restricted
Russia's access to Western technology, slowing energy extraction
efforts. In response, Russia has sought new partnerships with China,
which has expressed growing interest in Arctic investments. However,
Chinese technology cannot fully replace Western expertise, and this
creates challenges for Russia's Arctic ambitions.

Second, [[NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} northern [[expansion]{.mark} has
[heightened]{.mark}]{.underline} military [[tensions]{.mark} in the
Arctic. The accession]{.underline} to NATO [of [Finland and
Sweden]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[transformed]{.mark} the [regional
security]{.mark} landscape]{.underline}, forcing Moscow to reinforce its
military presence in the Arctic. Russia has increased Arctic military
exercises, expanded its air defence systems, and deployed new
Arctic-based military units. [These actions suggest a shift from
economic prioritisation to **military dominance** in the
region]{.underline}.

Third, [[Russia has]{.mark} **intensified** its **cooperation with
China** under the \'Polar Silk Road\' initiative]{.underline}. As
Western shipping companies reduce operations along the NSR, Russia has
turned to Chinese investments to sustain Arctic infrastructure projects.

The Ukraine war has shifted priorities towards security and military
dominance, with economic and environmental concerns becoming secondary.

The future of Russia's Arctic strategy

Russia's Arctic strategy has traditionally balanced economic ambitions
with military and geopolitical considerations. However, the
[Ukraine]{.underline} war has [forced a recalibration:
[**militarisation** and]{.mark} reliance on [**Asian partnerships** now
define Moscow's]{.mark} Arctic [approach]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The long-term [success]{.mark} of Russia's Arctic ambitions [depends on
several]{.mark} factors. Can Russia sustain its Arctic]{.underline}
economy without Western investment and technology[? Can [China
and]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}other Asian partners [fill the
gap]{.underline} left by Western companies[? How will
[NATO's]{.mark}]{.underline} Arctic [[presence]{.mark} shape Russia's
security policies?]{.underline} These questions will determine whether
Moscow can maintain its leadership in the region.

[With]{.underline} Donald [Trump's return]{.underline} to the White
House, [Russia's]{.underline} Arctic [strategy may have to grapple with
new geopolitical dynamics. [Trump's]{.mark} past]{.underline} foreign
[policy [favoured **bilateral**]{.mark} **deals [over multilateral
alliances]{.mark}**[. This could]{.mark} lead to a
**[loosen]{.mark}ing** of [US Arctic commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}
and, potentially, make room for limited US-Russia cooperation in energy
and trade. However, [[if Trump maintains]{.underline}]{.mark} his
[[scepticism toward NATO, **Russia might feel emboldened to further
militarise**]{.mark} the Arctic, [exploiting]{.mark}]{.underline}
potential [[**fractures** in]{.mark} Western **[security
coordination]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The growing]{.underline} military-technical [[**partnership** between
**Russia**]{.mark} and **[China]{.mark}**]{.underline} has become an
[increasingly **[influential]{.mark}** factor [in shaping **global
security**]{.mark} dynamics]{.underline}, particularly in the context of
Russia's ongoing full-scale war against Ukraine. Since February 2022,
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has gradually [become one of the [**key
enablers** of]{.mark} sustaining [Russia's **war effort**]{.mark},
particularly when it comes to the **defense industry**]{.underline}.
However, to understand this change, it is necessary to study the earlier
periods of military relations between Beijing and Moscow, because many
elements of their contemporary cooperation were built on foundations
laid down well before 2022.

This paper assesses the depth and dynamics of Russian-Sino military
cooperation, by comparing the era that preceded the breakout of the
Russia-Ukraine war in 2014 to the 2014-2022 period and to the one that
followed the full-scale escalation. The "fog of war" means there is very
limited reliable information about the details of contemporary
military-technological cooperation between Moscow and Beijing. This
particularly concerns details about ongoing weapons and arms component
transfers. Nevertheless, we can draw some conclusions about the general
trends of military cooperation between the two countries, especially
given the absence of certain actions and commitments, which are
indicative of the limits of their military cooperation.

The Beginning: A Pragmatic, Practical Partnership

The military [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} of post-Soviet Russia
and China [[began as]{.mark} a relatively straightforward **[arms
trade]{.mark}** [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1990s and has
[[evolved into a **complex partnership**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beijing
needed weapons and military equipment from Russia to increase and
modernize its armed forces. Meanwhile, Russia desperately needed export
markets for the survival of its large military-industrial complex
inherited from the Soviet era. The massive stockpiles of ex-Soviet
weaponry enabled Moscow to provide Beijing with less advanced weapons,
but in huge numbers. China particularly needed Russian technology for
modernizing its air force, air defense, and navy.

[\<\<CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>]{.underline}

According to data published by the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), between 1992 and 2014, Russia supplied China
with over 100 combat aircraft, including Su-27 and Su-30 fighters.
Russian specialists also contributed to the development of Chinese
aircraft such as the J-10, JF-17, and L-15 trainer.1 Additionally, China
received construction blueprints for the Su-27SK, leading to the
licensed production of the J-11 in Shenyang starting in 1998. Leveraging
this acquired knowledge, China later developed carrier-based fighters
like the J-15, incorporating both Russian and Ukrainian aviation
technology. Russia also shipped more than 300 Mi-17 transport
helicopters, at least 12 S-300 air defense systems, a minimum of 35 Tor
M1 air defense systems, and several hundred air-to-air missiles for the
Su-27 fighters to support China's ambition to develop its air forces. In
terms of naval capabilities, Russia delivered altogether 12 diesel
submarines (10 Project 636E "Varshavyanka"-class submarines and two
Project 877E "Lada"-class vessels), hundreds of torpedoes and Kh-59
anti-ship missiles, and even some 120 AK-176 naval guns and air defense
missiles for China's newly built destroyers. China also obtained two
decommissioned ex-Soviet aircraft carriers --- the Minsk and the Varyag
--- to develop its own aircraft carrier program.2 Albeit the latter was
sold by Ukraine, the transfer could not have taken place without at
least the tacit consent of Russia. In this period before 2014, the two
sides had asymmetric, but conveniently complementary, motivations to
cooperate: China needed Russia's military-technological know-how, while
the Russian defense industry was eager to sell weaponry to China.
\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\> For China, acquiring Russian technology has long
served a dual purpose: It enhances Beijing's military capabilities and
provides a foundation for the development of indigenous weapons systems
through military-industrial cannibalization. China has historically
reverse-engineered Russian technology, adapting and improving upon it
for its own needs --- a situation that has irked the Kremlin and led to
setbacks in the relationship. For instance, the J-11, derived from the
Su-27 and the HQ-9 air defense system, and modeled after the S-300,
exemplifies this approach. More recently, Chinese advancements in jet
engines, radar systems, and missile technology can be traced back to
Russian designs. Meanwhile, Russia did not show much interest in China's
own defense technological solutions, as Moscow deemed them less advanced
than what Russia could domestically produce. This was particularly so
because Russia built its defense reform on the assumption that
technological cooperation with the West would remain uninterrupted: The
State Armament Program 2010-2020 envisioned ambitious defense
cooperation programs with the West, not paying much attention to
technologically inferior China.3 All in all, before 2014, Russia was an
important provider of military hardware for China, dominantly based on
commercial motivations. Deepening Cooperation in the Context of the
Post-2014 Sanctions The international sanctions gradually introduced
against Russia following the 2014 occupation and illegal annexation of
Crimea started to change the overall dynamics of Russian-Sino military
cooperation and the motives behind it. This affected both the political
and military-technological dimensions of their cooperation, motivated by
Russia's sudden loss of access to Ukrainian defense industrial products,
such as ship engines and missile technology, as well as Western
sanctions against the Russian defense industry. Hence, from 2014 to
2022, military cooperation between Russia and China witnessed
significant developments, marked by a rapid expansion in several key
areas, as China became Russia's only remaining alternative for
technology imports. This period was characterized by the growing
institutionalization of military-technological cooperation, joint
exercises, and military diplomacy, which laid the foundation for the
robust yet complex relationship between the two countries witnessed in
2025.4 The most notable phase of expansion occurred between 2014 and
2019, when both countries increased their military collaboration across
multiple fronts. The establishment of regular high-level consultations
and bilateral security dialogues, such as annual meetings among the
heads of the security councils and the semiannual Northeast Asia
Security Dialogue, strengthened the political and military foundations
of their relationship. These meetings were complemented by five-year
roadmaps, starting in 2017, which charted the course for their military
cooperation. By 2021, the most recent plan, which extends through 2025,
demonstrated continued commitment to deepening their strategic military
ties. \<\<IMAGE OMITTED\> During this period, military-technological
cooperation grew at a rapid pace. China emerged as an increasingly
important consumer of Russian military technology, particularly in the
realms of air defense, aircraft, and advanced weaponry.5 While China has
made strides in developing its domestic defense industry, it continues
to acquire advanced Russian military hardware, including missile systems
and cutting-edge aircraft. Unlike in the pre-2014 era, in this period,
Russia already supplied China with some of its most advanced weaponry
and equipment. In May 2018, China procured at least 8 pieces of the
S-400 missile defense system, further enhancing its air defense
capabilities. Additionally, Russia supplied China with 10 Su-35
fighters, completing an earlier contract that was fulfilled through
deliveries in 2016 and 2017. Besides, according to SIPRI, among other
data sources, Moscow also shipped more than 20 Ilyushin Il-76M
modernized heavy military transport aircrafts.1 In 2014, a new dimension
of bilateral military cooperation emerged: Russia importing technology
from China. The sanctions introduced gradually after 2014 isolated
Russia from most of the Western defense industrial partners that Moscow
intended to cooperate with in modernizing its armed forces. Some
projects were scrapped entirely, for example, the plan to buy the
Mistral-class helicopter-carrier attack ships from France. In other
cases, the termination of contracts resulted in Russia being deprived of
crucial Western components necessary for building its own systems. This
significantly affected the Russian fleet. The building of several ship
classes had to be either rescheduled or redesigned because the
Western-made ship engines (primarily the German MAN and Finnish
Wärtsilä) had become unavailable due to sanctions. The situation was
further worsened by the fact that the attack against Ukraine also
terminated Russia's access to engines produced by Ukraine's defense
industry. As a substitute, Russia tried to import the necessary
technology from China, but the experiences were mixed at best. For the
Buyan-M corvettes, Moscow originally planned to use German engines, and
the first five vessels of the class were built with these. After 2014,
Moscow had to rely on Chinese-made engines for the remaining four
corvettes. However, though these engines were built in China using
Western licenses, they were still hardly suitable for the task; they
seriously underperformed in terms of power, flexibility, and fuel
consumption.6 Russia had similar experiences with smaller Chinese
engines built into the Karakurt-class corvettes and Rubin-class patrol
boats: Their overall performance was much lower than it would have been
with the originally planned Western engines.7 However, by the end of the
2014-2022 period, there was a shift in the trajectory of Russian-Sino
military cooperation. China's growing self-sufficiency in defense
technology, along with the Western sanctions imposed on Russia, led to a
plateau in arms sales. Despite this, joint technology projects, such as
advanced radar systems and helicopter development, continued to form a
crucial aspect of the bilateral military cooperation. Although the
volume of arms sales diminished, the partnership evolved into one based
more on the exchange of technological components and co-production of
military systems. In other words, the dynamics changed: Instead of China
unilaterally importing Russian technology, while Russia worked with the
West, Beijing and Moscow engaged in joint development projects. This,
however, did not prevent China from continuing to reverse-engineer
various Russian systems: This reached such a level by 2019 that in a
rare move Rostec, Russia's state arms corporation, publicly criticized
China for this practice, claiming that there were more than 500 cases of
illicit technology transfers.5 \<\<FIGURE OMITTED\> In parallel, joint
military exercises and operations saw a significant uptick. From the
mid-2010s onward, Russia and China increased the frequency and global
reach of their joint military activities, shifting from basic training
exercises to more complex operations designed to enhance operational
coordination. These joint exercises were intended to demonstrate
Moscow's and Beijing's willingness to improve interoperability between
the two militaries and served to demonstrate their growing cooperation
to the world. The People's Liberation Army used joint exercises to
enhance its operational capabilities, learning from Russia's military
expertise. In contrast, Russia's military, while advanced in certain
areas, found less to learn from China's comparatively less experienced
armed forces.8 However, one needs to add that, in reality, joint
exercises were still more about their symbolic value than about
enhancing live combat interoperability. China never had its soldiers
deployed alongside Russian troops in any real missions, whether
anti-terror operations in the North Caucasus or high-intensity combat in
Ukraine. Hence, in terms of improving interoperability, the two sides
never crossed the boundary from exercising in drills to fighting
together in live combat. However, after 2019, the pace of these joint
exercises began to slow, primarily due to the geopolitical constraints
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and, more importantly, Russia's invasion
of Ukraine in 2022.

[\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>]{.underline}

The Post-2022 Period: A Deepening, but Not Unlimited, Partnership

[The [**February 2022 attack** changed]{.mark}]{.underline} the dynamics
of [Russian-Sino military [cooperation by significantly]{.mark}
**[amplifying]{.mark}** the [trends]{.mark} since 2014]{.underline}.
Almost three weeks before the attack, on February 4, 2022, Russian
President Vladimir Putin visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in
Beijing, and the two [leaders announced the [creation of a
"**no-limits**]{.mark} [partnership"]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 The
statement charged that the advocacy of democracy and human rights by the
US is merely a form of exercising political influence, condemned any
kind of economic sanctions, and pledged that China and Russia work
together to counter the Western liberal world order.10

However, the limits of the "no-limits" partnership were put to a hard
test by the launch of the full-scale invasion. Russia waited until the
Beijing Winter Olympics ended on February 20 and, the next day,
unilaterally recognized the "independence" of the two Russia-backed
separatist entities in eastern Ukraine, the so-called Donetsk People's
Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. As the recognition also included
military assistance to the separatists, this move paved the way for a
direct, large-scale military escalation.

[As]{.underline} the rapidly introduced Western [[**sanctions** hit
Russia's economy]{.underline}]{.mark}, including its military industry,
[[China]{.mark} was [**quick** to step]{.mark} [in]{.mark} and
**satisfy** Russia's growing **demands**]{.underline}. The sanctions
circumvention mechanisms established in 2014 [enabled Beijing to rapidly
[provide Russia with]{.mark}]{.underline} its much-needed
[[**military-technological** components, **parts**]{.mark}, and **[raw
materials]{.mark}**]{.underline}. China has delivered shipments of goods
sanctioned by the West to Russia both directly and via intermediaries,
such as Hong Kong, Kazakhstan, and Turkey. 

[\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>]{.underline}

One demonstrative example is the case of semiconductors necessary for
military equipment and weaponry. Compared with the pre-war level,
China's [[export of **semiconductors**]{.mark} to Russia [rose]{.mark}
significantly]{.underline}, and as of 2023, China [accounted for **89%**
of Russia's microchip **imports**. Beijing also played a **key role** in
Russia's **domestic** chip production]{.underline}: Some 47% of the
chip-making equipment and 58% of spare parts used in Russia were of
Chinese origin.11 The importance of semiconductor shipments was tacitly
[confirmed by the February 2024 meeting of **Putin** and **Xi**, during
which they pledged to "maintain the **stability**" of **industrial
trade** as a reaction to newer **Western sanctions**]{.underline}.11 

The [same key role is present regarding **[critical
minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline}: As of 2023, [[China was]{.mark}
Russia's **[sole]{.mark} external [supplier]{.mark}** of **gallium** and
**germanium**]{.underline}. Another critical mineral, antimony, is
supplied only by China and the United Arab Emirates.12 Further, Russia's
importation from China of nitrocellulose, a crucial component of
gunpowder and explosives production, has surged since 2022. Before the
full-scale invasion, China shipped practically no nitrocellulose to
Russia. However, [deliveries have **skyrocketed**]{.underline} since May
2022: [In 2022, some 700 tons were transported, increasing to **1,300
tons** by 2023]{.underline}.13

[\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark} also [supplies Russia with]{.mark} a huge
variety]{.underline} and number [of **dual-use** goods, the most
important being]{.underline} **[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**nmanned
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**erial
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That
said, in response to Western criticism, in September 2023, Beijing
introduced restrictions on the export of drones to conflict zones,
though regulations still permit drone exports for civilian use. This
loophole regarding dual use is actively used by Beijing and Moscow:
Russia has imported millions of light drones manufactured in China,
primarily of the Mavic series from DJI. While the Ukrainian military
also uses Mavics, anecdotal evidence suggests that China tends to
deliver more developed versions of the same Mavic drones to Russia than
to Ukraine. In addition to these, Chinese components are playing a key
role in supporting Russia's domestic drone production.13 [There is also
growing evidence that China is producing **[armed drones]{.mark}** for
Russia]{.underline}.14

China apparently does not mind if its civilian products shipped to
Russia are used for military purposes. The Russian army has been widely
using the DesertCross 1000-3 light all-terrain car at least since autumn
2023. Roles vary from logistics to weapons platforms; sometimes
DesertCross vehicles, colloquially nicknamed "golf cars,'" are even used
for mechanized assaults.15 Despite the huge amounts of public evidence
about the combat deployment of these vehicles, China continues exporting
them to Russia, claiming that the shipments are only for civilian end
users.

[\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>]{.underline}

Meanwhile, China has almost completely refrained from exporting heavy
weapons and ready-made arms to Russia.16 The few exceptions documented
so far include supplying Russia with a limited number of Shaanxi Baoji
Tiger armored vehicles, which in 2023 were used by the Chechen leader
Ramzan Kadyrov's Akhmat special unit.17 The successor of the Wagner
Group also obtained some Chinese armored fighting vehicles: Following
the attack on a Wagner convoy in Mali by Tuareg groups, the victorious
rebels captured at least one Norinco VP11 armored vehicle; however, it
is possible that this vehicle was originally purchased by the Malian
army and then transferred to the Russian mercenaries.18 In addition to a
small number of armored vehicles, there have also been cases where
Russian troops were documented using Chinese-made anti-drone
weapons.16 However, as of March 2025, there were no known cases of
Chinese heavy weaponry getting supplied en masse to Russia's regular
armed forces. 

Strategic Depth of Russian-Sino Military Cooperation

In addition to military and dual-use shipments, one of the most visible
aspects of Russian-Sino military cooperation is the [increasing
[**frequency** and **scale** of]{.mark} joint [military
exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}. These drills serve multiple purposes:
For Moscow, they [[demonstrate]{.mark} that Western [attempts to
**isolate** Russia]{.mark} **have** [failed]{.mark}]{.underline}, while
for Beijing, they [[reinforce **strong ties**]{.mark} with a **key
military partner**]{.underline}. Exercises such as the annual Vostok,
Zapad, and Joint Sea drills [[highlight]{.mark} the growing
**[interoperability]{.mark}** between Russian and Chinese forces,
including their [ability to coordinate]{.mark} complex [**naval** and
**air**]{.mark} [operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For NATO and the United States, [these exercises present a **strategic
concern**. They [enhance]{.mark} China's **military
[preparedness]{.mark}** and allow it to test Russian **tactics** and
**equipment** in **real-world scenarios**]{.underline}. Moreover, they
[[send]{.mark} a strong **[geopolitical message]{.mark}**]{.underline},
particularly [[in]{.mark} regions]{.underline} of shared interest [such
as the]{.underline} **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, [the
**[Pacific]{.mark}**, and]{.underline} even [the
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, where both nations seek to challenge
Western dominance.

[\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>]{.underline}

[[Despite]{.mark} **occasional [tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
military [[partnership]{.mark} between Russia and China remains
[**advantageous** for]{.mark} **[both sides]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
Russia, [[arms exports]{.underline}]{.mark} to China [[provide]{.mark}
much-needed **[revenue]{.mark}** for its defense industry]{.underline},
especially in light of Western sanctions. This [[collaboration
ensures]{.mark} **continued [investment]{.mark}**]{.underline} in

The [last factor is **[offensive intentions]{.mark}**, which can be
[seen through]{.mark} the **[expansion of China's economy]{.mark}** that
[is supported by **Russia** in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Also
mentioned in the previous section, the 2019 statement coming from US
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo can be inferred that the [[US]{.mark}
feels [threatened]{.mark}]{.underline} and/or challenged [[by
the]{.mark} increasing and [**aggressive** presence]{.mark} of China in
the Arctic]{.underline}.54 Even though it currently does not possess
sustained military assets, [[Chinese scientific or economic
activities]{.mark} in the Arctic could [serve as a **Trojan
horse**]{.mark} for Russia's defense activities in the
Arctic]{.underline}.55 Moreover, [the US]{.underline} also [cannot be
certain whether or not China's presence in the Arctic [will turn
into]{.mark} a **[military deployment]{.mark}** in the
future]{.underline}. [The [sense of insecurity]{.mark} also [contributes
to]{.mark} the [**growing tension** between the US and]{.mark} the
non-Western powers, especially [Russia and China]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Although a primary international legal framework for the Arctic has been
provided through several [[international treaties]{.mark} such as
UNCLOS]{.underline}, it is [[still unable to serve as a forum for
**addressing security concerns**]{.mark} related to increased
**commercial activity** and **military presence**]{.underline}.56 State
sovereignty birthed uncertainty in the international anarchical system,
forcing states to obtain as much power as possible. Since the US cannot
predict what Russia might do in the Arctic region, the country will
subsequently always try to ensure its survivability through increasing
its power.57 [The increase of Russia's presence and its military
capabilities in the Arctic]{.underline} also [raises concern for US
officials in terms of **losing its power** and **domination** throughout
the region]{.underline}. Per the alliance formation theory in balancing
behaviour, it explains that once states realize that they cannot
materialize national security on their own, they tend to form alliances
in an attempt to increase their capabilities to protect themselves from
states, coalitions, even other allies whose superior resources could
pose a threat and reduce their presence in their region.58

[[**NATO** is]{.mark} one of [the **most favorable allie**]{.mark}**s**
[for the US]{.mark}. Besides that [five]{.mark} of the eight [Arctic
states are]{.mark} also [member]{.mark} state[s]{.mark} to NATO, the
prominent position of Russia as one of the Alliance's "rival" has
subsequently [made]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} allies [to
[respond to Russia's activities on many fronts]{.mark}, including the
**construction of new icebreakers**, improvements to **US Navy's Second
Fleet**, and renovating and making use of **Keflavik
facilities**]{.underline}.59 [[As Russia and]{.mark} other powers such
as [China]{.mark} continue to [escalate their presence]{.mark} within
the Arctic, [further **regional security concerns** will arise]{.mark},
fueling states in the Arctic to take measures in an effort to
counter]{.underline} said [concerns]{.underline}. The
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} alliance is believed to be [able to help
[defend]{.mark} the **Arctic\'s security** and **[stability]{.mark}**,
especially [due to]{.mark} the increasing role of countries such as
Russia and China, as well as [the inability of the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates (or any other

**international [norms]{.mark}**]{.underline} wherever possible,
including [in the Arctic. NATO]{.underline}'s growing appeal among
European states suggests that NATO [may]{.underline} also [be called
upon to guarantee the future of Arctic stability]{.underline}. Instead
of dividing Europe, isolating Ukraine, and expanding its influence,
[Moscow's **invasion of Ukraine**]{.underline} has [resulted in a closer
alliance between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its
Arctic NATO allies]{.underline}. Moreover, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[with]{.mark} the accession of [**Finland** and **Sweden**, has

[[ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}, though the makings of a more effective

which the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and]{.mark} its [NATO]{.mark} partners]{.underline} are not afraid to
[**[define the rules]{.mark}** and **laws** [governing the

[The failure of the fulfillment of 2% GDP for NATO's defense
spending]{.underline} by most of NATO's member states, however,
[shouldn't stop the US from supporting its contribution towards the
Arctic because of [Russia\'s **increasing presence** and
**capabilities** in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [alignment
of]{.mark} the [**US** and **NATO**]{.mark}**'s member states**
[has]{.mark} a [great potential to **reduce the presence** and]{.mark}
the **[domination of Russia]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}. The
[Arctic has]{.underline} always [remained a vital strategic region for
Euro-Atlantic security. [Five]{.mark} of the [A]{.mark}rctic
[C]{.mark}ouncil's [members are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[part of
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, which are: [Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway,
and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [NATO
Allies]{.underline} also [have conflicting views about Russia's
intentions]{.underline} in the Arctic [and **increasing military
presence** in the region and have reached a consensus on the importance
of the region to **NATO security**]{.underline}. Moreover, although
there is no formal role of NATO in the Arctic, the Alliance has
reaffirmed its willingness to improve security at all of its borders,
including in the North Atlantic at the Warsaw Summit in July 2016.

The communiqué of the [2016 Warsaw Summit acknowledged evolving security
challenges in the North Atlantic, particularly regarding NATO-Russia
relations]{.underline}. The alliance considered **[[Russia\'s aggressive
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [[include **provocative military
activities**]{.mark} in the periphery of NATO territory]{.underline},
and [emphasize]{.underline}d [**deterrence** as well as the need to
strengthen **NATO's defense posture**]{.underline}. At Warsaw, NATO
Allies also agreed to enhance the Alliance's situational awareness in
the North Atlantic in response to Russia's military presence. It is
worthwhile noting that the North Atlantic is bordering the Arctic;
therefore, any change in the security of the former is likely to have an
impact on the High North as well. [Thus, it becomes [important for NATO
Allies to increase **situational awareness**]{.mark} in the Arctic
aswell]{.underline}.71

When states are confronted with emerging challenges, they either turn to
existing international organizations and governing norms or create new
organizational structures to respond.72However, the exclusion of Russia
from NATO, with the exception of the NATO-Russia Council, presents a
fundamental dilemma that NATO's role in the Arctic can be muted. But
[[for the US, NATO]{.mark} can be [considered as **central** to]{.mark}
their [**general defense** and **security strategies** to
fulfill]{.mark}]{.underline} its [**[national security]{.mark}**
priorities in the Arctic]{.underline}.73 [Therefore, The US [can
increase its presence as]{.mark} the **[great power]{.mark}** in the
Arctic, **[backed up by NATO]{.mark}**, [which is perceived by Russia as
a]{.mark} **big [threat]{.mark}** to its security.]{.underline}

[The fact that]{.underline} five out of the [seven Arctic
States]{.underline} (aside from Russia) [are the members of
NATO]{.underline}, and the other two (Finland and Sweden) are NATO
enhanced opportunities partners, [it is believed that the allies created
between the US and NATO are more likely to have **bigger power to
control** the Arctic compared to Russia]{.underline}. Following the
hegemonic stability theory, great powers tend to seek domination over
all parts of the international system in every aspect, and that can be
seen through Russia and the US presence in the Arctic.74 [As two of the
most powerful states in the Arctic, [Russia]{.mark} and the US are
[trying to **maximize** their capability in the Arctic to show]{.mark}
their [**domination** in the international realm and seek]{.mark} status
as a **[hegemonic power]{.mark}**. The US domination in NATO in this
sense gives a higher possibility for the two to cooperate to suppress
Russia's domination,]{.underline} especially [when most of [NATO's
member states]{.mark}]{.underline} also [share the same perspective and
[see]{.mark}s **[Russia as a threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to their
stability in the Arctic. [Therefore]{.underline}, if the [[cooperation
of]{.mark} the [US with NATO can **deter Russia**]{.mark}**'s presence**
and **increasing capabilities** in the Arctic]{.underline}, the US is
likely to be a dominant state that can create hegemonic stability in the
Arctic.

This is how seriously the [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} has taken its
presence in the Arctic --- it [[currently has]{.underline}]{.mark} just
**[[two]{.underline}]{.mark}** functional [[icebreakers]{.mark},
[compared to Russia's fleet of]{.mark}]{.underline} at least
**[[46]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Addressing this disparity has become an
**urgent**, **strategic necessity**.]{.underline}

And [yet]{.underline} the [contract to build three new vessels is five
years behind schedule and **costs have ballooned**]{.underline} to
\$5.1bn from \$2bn. [The first ship was due to be operational this year,
but that is now **delayed to 2029.**]{.underline}

The US this year agreed with Canada and Finland for a consortium to
build more vessels and share expertise, which will be critical in
producing what American sources say will be a need for 70 to 90 allied
vessels in the coming years.

[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Arctic ice melt]{.mark}ing at
unprecedented rates, [**new shipping lanes** and vast reserves of
**natural resources**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [oil, gas, and rare
minerals]{.underline} --- [[are becoming

[raised]{.underline} the [Arctic's strategic value, drawing in **global
powers**]{.underline} seeking to establish or expand their footholds.

The [[US]{.mark}, Canada [and]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[NATO]{.mark}
allies [are in a **high-stakes race** with **Russia** and **China** to
secure]{.mark} access, resources and [influence]{.mark} in this rapidly
evolving territory.]{.underline}

The [allies say they aim for a cooperative Arctic, but [Russia]{.mark}
is taking a starkly different approach]{.underline}. [[**Expansive
claims**, **military fortifications** and **joint initiatives** with
China indicate]{.mark} a [push to **consolidate
control.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [**Russo-Chinese partnership** threatens to disrupt the Arctic's
**fragile balance**, highlighting the **urgent need** for a NATO
response]{.underline}. The alliance's [member states, particularly those
with direct Arctic borders, face the challenge of asserting sovereignty
and maintaining security while fostering **international cooperation**
and respecting **indigenous rights.**]{.underline}

[Estimates indicate]{.underline} as much as [13% of the world's
undiscovered [oil]{.mark}, 30% of its untapped [natural gas]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} a wealth of [r]{.mark}]{.underline}are
[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}arth [[m]{.underline}]{.mark}ineral[[s]{.mark}
are locked beneath the Arctic seabed]{.underline}. The [importance of
such resources for energy security and]{.underline} the
[tech]{.underline}nologies of tomorrow [[make the]{.mark}
region]{.underline} a [[critical]{.underline}]{.mark} arena [[for
**economic influence**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

The [Arctic is]{.underline} also [poised to [reshape global trade as the
**N**]{.mark}]{.underline}orthern **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**oute [[becomes]{.mark} more
[navigable]{.mark}, shortening shipping distances between Asia and
Europe by]{.underline} as much as [40%.]{.underline}

[[For **NATO**]{.mark}, this [shift presents]{.mark} both [an
**opportunity** and a **risk**]{.mark}. An open, secure Arctic could
bolster]{.underline} economic [stability for all the alliance's members,
while a contested or militarized Arctic under Russian and Chinese
control could stymie trade, hinder access to resources, and restrict
freedom of navigation]{.underline}.

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[taken an]{.mark} increasingly
[**aggressive** stance]{.mark}, claiming large swathes of the Arctic
seabed as its sovereign territory. It]{.underline} has [**[fortified the
Kola Peninsula]{.mark}**, [established]{.mark} an array of Arctic
**[bases]{.mark}**, [and expanded]{.mark} its **[icebreaker
fleet]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [Kremlin]{.underline} has also [conducted large-scale military
exercises in the region]{.underline} --- some with China --- [signaling
its intent to assert control over the Arctic and its
resources]{.underline}. [Meanwhile, [China]{.mark}, which has [declared
itself a "**near-Arctic state**,"]{.mark}]{.underline} is [making its
own inroads]{.underline} --- [funding **infrastructure projects**,
conducting **research**, and **[partnering]{.mark} [with
Russia]{.mark}** to develop and access the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}.

The burgeoning [alliance between Moscow and Beijing threatens to upend
regional stability as both nations pursue interests **contrary to
NATO**]{.underline}'s values of transparency, the rule of law and shared
access.

The Western alliance did seek an agreed path through the Arctic Council,
which looked for joint agreement on a range of issues including the
environment. Seven of the eight members are NATO members and Russia also
had a seat. But the body's activities were frozen once Russia launched
its all-out war on Ukraine in 2022.

[[NATO]{.mark} members [must]{.mark}]{.underline} now accept that times
have changed, and [[adapt]{.mark} their Arctic [strategies]{.mark}
accordingly. [For]{.mark}]{.underline} Canada and the [[US]{.mark}, this
[means bolster]{.mark}ing [investment in **icebreaking**, **enhancing
surveillance**, and fortifying]{.mark} Arctic
**[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Increased [surveillance]{.mark} is]{.underline} also [[essential to
monitor Russian and Chinese activity]{.mark} in the region. [**Satellite
reconnaissance**, **maritime patrol aircraft**]{.mark} and **[unmanned
systems]{.mark}** would help NATO better understand and respond to
developments in real time, while improved [**radar installations** and
**e**]{.mark}**arly [w]{.mark}arning [s]{.mark}ystems** will be critical
to [enabling a rapid response to]{.mark} any
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[NATO]{.underline} allies are also working to expand and [modernize
Arctic infrastructure. [**Airstrips**, **ports** and **bases** in the
High North serve as]{.mark} essential [**logistics hubs**,
enabling]{.mark} forces to operate in such a challenging environment and
allowing for quicker deployments and [sustained
operations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

And it's [[not just a military priority]{.mark}. Improved
[infrastructure]{.mark} is]{.underline} also [[vital for **search and
rescue**]{.mark} operations, [**scientific research**, and
**environmental monitoring**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- all of which
underscore a commitment to a peaceful, stable Arctic.

The [alliance must]{.underline} also [ensure the **rights of indigenous
communities** are respected]{.underline}. Indigenous peoples have
inhabited the Arctic for millennia and possess invaluable knowledge
vital for sustainable development and environmental stewardship in the
region.

[NATO nations must engage indigenous communities as partners, consulting
them on policies that affect their lands and livelihoods. Respecting
indigenous rights]{.underline} and incorporating their perspectives [is
essential not only for ethical reasons but also for ensuring stability
and trust.]{.underline}

The [[Arctic is]{.mark} one [of the world's most **vulnerable
ecosystems** and]{.mark}, while Russia and China pursue resource
extraction with little regard for environmental impact, [NATO's]{.mark}
Arctic strategy [must prioritize
**sustainability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This means setting high
standards for Arctic operations, limiting ecological disruption and
investing in research to better understand climate change's effects on
the region.

[[To]{.mark} [address these]{.mark} multifaceted [challenges]{.mark},
[NATO must]{.mark} present a unified Arctic strategy,
[emphasiz]{.mark}ing [**deterrence**, **cooperation**, and
**resilience**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A security framework [that
prioritizes shared access, respects territorial sovereignty, and
mitigates risks is essential to counter Russian and Chinese
ambitions.]{.underline}

[[As the **biggest authoritarian states** seek to redraw]{.mark} the
[rules in the High North]{.mark}, **NATO must take decisive action**,
investing in infrastructure, enhancing surveillance, and building
partnerships with indigenous communities]{.underline}. [[Only]{.mark} by

Implications for the West

[[Cooperation]{.mark} between **Russia** and **China**]{.underline} has
gradually evolved into a much more intricate and multifaceted strategic
alignment that [[has **far-reaching implications** for]{.mark} both
**regional** and **global [stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
burgeoning cooperation not only serves to significantly enhance the
military capabilities of both nations but also [[presents]{.mark} a
[direct challenge to]{.mark} Western **[security]{.mark}
[structures]{.mark}**[, particularly **NATO** and]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. As
Russia and China deepen their defense ties, the [[balance of **power**
in key]{.mark} geopolitical [regions, including **Eurasia**]{.mark}, the
**[Pacific]{.mark}**, and the **[Arctic]{.mark}**, is
shifting]{.underline}, raising new concerns about the stability of the
international order.29 The growing [coordination between Russian and
Chinese armed forces]{.underline} raises the theoretical [[possibility
of]{.mark} coordinated **military [operations]{.mark}** [across
**multiple theaters**]{.mark}]{.underline}, from Eastern Europe to the
Pacific, should the necessary political will from both sides manifest.
This, if realized, could [[complicate]{.mark} **Western military
[planning]{.mark}**]{.underline} and response strategies, forcing NATO
and its allies to rethink their deterrence measures. However, at
present, there is no indication that the Russian and Chinese militaries
have reached the level of interoperability necessary for a full-fledged
military operation. 

[\<\<IMAGE OMITTED\>]{.underline}

The intensification of Russian-Sino military-technical cooperation over
the past few decades has also posed a significant challenge to NATO and
broader Western security interests. At its core, the most notable
benefit of this collaboration for both states has been the mutual
political support they provide each other on the international stage. In
return, this partnership has allowed China to bolster its military
capabilities, acquiring advanced Russian technology, while
simultaneously helping to sustain and strengthen Russia's defense
industry, particularly in light of ongoing Western sanctions. Beyond the
bilateral military exchanges, the broader strategic implications of
their cooperation cannot be understated. Together, Russia and China
[[present]{.mark} a [powerful **counterweight** to **Western
influence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [undermining the United States's and
NATO's abilities to [shape **security outcomes** in regions of **shared
interest**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This growing alignment not only
solidifies their individual defense postures but also offers a
[formidable **geopolitical challenge**]{.underline} to the West's global
interests.

In response, the West must strengthen its own military alliances,
enhance intelligence-sharing, and invest in next-generation defense
technologies to counterbalance this emerging bloc. Additionally, NATO
and its partners should take proactive measures to limit the transfer of
advanced technology to both Russia and China, preventing further
military advancements that could threaten global security.

Conclusion: Russian-Sino Military Cooperation Will Remain Short of an
Alliance

China's perception of Russia's war in Ukraine is complex and shaped by a
combination of strategic calculus, ideological affinity, and pragmatic
reassessment --- particularly regarding the effectiveness of Russian
military technology and doctrine.

Russia is both a European and an Asian country, stretching across 11
time zones from west to east. It shares the world's longest land border
with China. [[Historically]{.mark}, the [relationship]{.mark} between
the two countries [was **tense**]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly
following Russia's annexation of some Chinese territories in the late
19th century. During the Czarist era, the Russian elite was culturally
oriented toward Europe, and the country expanded westward, ultimately
reaching its greatest territorial extent as the Soviet Union in 1945. 

The collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s -- and the loss of vast
territories in Central Asia, the Caucasus, Ukraine and the Baltics -- is
seen not only by President Vladimir Putin as a historic catastrophe, but
is also widely regarded as such within Russia. 

Today, [[Moscow claims]{.mark} that [**trust** in]{.mark} the [West has
been **lost**]{.mark}]{.underline} for a number of reasons. Its current
[**[political]{.mark} [doctrine]{.mark}** [includes a **pivot** to
**Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even while it seeks to reclaim lost
territories in Ukraine and the Baltics. There is also ongoing concern
over NATO's strong presence in neighboring countries. 

[[Siberia]{.mark} is [now a **strategic priority**]{.mark}]{.underline}
for Moscow. From the Kremlin's view, this is entirely reasonable. There
is a [[perception]{.mark} that [this]{.mark} vast, sparsely populated
[region, with]{.mark} its [abundant]{.mark} **natural
[resources]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} expanding **agricultural
[potential]{.mark}**[, could be **threatened**]{.mark} by spillover from
the 1.4 billion Chinese]{.underline} living just south of the border.
However, such [[fears]{.mark} appear increasingly
**[unfounded]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as China -- like Russia -- is
facing a rapid demographic decline. 

Currently, [[relations between **Moscow** and
**Beijing**]{.underline}]{.mark} at the government level are [[very
**strong**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} the two countries rely on each
other. For now, the [idea of driving a **wedge** between them seems
**unlikely**]{.underline}. 

## Deterrence\-\--Svalbard

### U\-\--Invasion\-\--2AC

#### Absent [NATO stance]{.underline} in the Arctic, Russia will [attack Svalbard]{.underline} -- that causes [draw in]{.underline}.

[[Given]{.mark} Moscow's **bellicose [rhetoric]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[about]{.underline}]{.mark} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[and threats to
attack]{.underline}]{.mark} one or more of its [members]{.underline} [if
the West]{.underline} [continues]{.underline} [to **support
Ukraine**]{.underline}, [many]{.underline} in Russia and the West [have
been speculating about where]{.underline} such [a]{.underline}
[**Russian move** might occur]{.underline}. Most have focused on Poland,
the Baltic countries, and Finland as possible targets, but perhaps [the
most likely]{.underline} [one]{.underline} [is]{.underline} elsewhere:
[the **Svalbard** archipelago]{.underline}. [Svalbard]{.underline} is
part of Norway, a NATO member, but [is **demilitarized**]{.underline}
[by the]{.underline} provisions of the 1920 [Svalbard
Treaty]{.underline}, which has currently been signed by 46 countries,
including the United States, Norway, and France. [Because of that
agreement]{.underline}, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[remains]{.underline} deeply [[**divided**]{.mark} as [to
whether]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [case of [a
Russian move]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [all]{.underline} the
[[members]{.underline}]{.mark} of the alliance [would want to
[invoke]{.mark} the]{.underline} provisions of **[[Article
5]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the NATO charter, which requires alliance
members to view an attack on one as an attack on all. [That
division]{.underline}, of which Moscow is well aware, may [[lead]{.mark}
the [Kremlin]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to decide]{.mark} that [an
**attack**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[on Svalbard is]{.underline} **[less
risky]{.underline}**]{.mark} than an attack on any other NATO country.

The Svalbard archipelago, often referred to as Spitsbergen, the largest
and only populated island in this group, lies approximately 1,000
kilometers (about 620 miles) northwest of Norway and covers 22,000
square kilometers (about 8,500 square miles) of territory. The island
has fewer than 3,500 residents, of whom approximately a fifth are
Russians and a handful are Chinese. Because of its isolation, Svalbard
was one of the last European territories whose status remained undefined
into the 20th century, with various countries, including Norway, Sweden,
and Russia, using it as a base for shipping and mining and even claiming
it as their own. In 1920, however, the Western powers, without Russia's
participation, signed a treaty that declared that Norway had sovereignty
over the islands but required that [[Oslo]{.mark} kept the archipelago
demilitarized]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[[permitted]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[development of]{.mark} **other
national [communities]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
[including]{.underline}]{.mark}, most prominently, **[the
[Russians]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (On these unusual arrangements and
their consequences, see Christopher R. Rossi, "'A Unique International
Problem': The Svalbard Treaty," Washington University Global Studies Law
Review 15-1 (2015).)

After the demise of the Soviet Union, Moscow continued to expand its
presence on the archipelago. By the early years of the 21st century,
there were nearly 4,000 Russians there, most of whom were engaged in
coal mining. The closure of these mines due to others elsewhere being
more cost-effective and the fall of the demand for coal, however, led to
a rapid decline in the number of Russians in Svalbard over the last 15
years. There are now fewer than 700. In the summer of 2022,
[they]{.underline} [became]{.underline} the [**center** of a
controversy]{.underline} [when [Norway **imposed sanctions**]{.mark} on
Russia because of Russian]{.underline} President Vladimir Putin's [war
in Ukraine]{.underline}. [Oslo]{.underline} [said it would
**[restrict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Moscow's]{.underline}
[[ability]{.underline} [to **supply**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} [**[Russian community]{.mark}** in
Svalbard]{.underline}. [That [sparked **outrage** in
Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline} and even suggestions by Russian
parliamentarians that their country should use military means to defend
its rights under the 1920 treaty. Fortunately, this conflict was
resolved without any direct use of force (see EDM, July 7, 2022).

That [clash]{.underline} also **[highlighted divisions]{.underline}**
[in Europe]{.underline} that may now be more critical.
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said then
and has [[repeated]{.underline}]{.mark} that [any [attack on
Svalbard]{.mark}]{.underline} would be [treated as an attack on **the
Alliance**]{.underline} as a whole [and]{.underline} thus
[[trigger]{.underline}]{.mark} an **[[Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}**
response. However, he is Norwegian, and his words appear to reflect
Oslo's hopes more than the position of all NATO countries. Many in the
alliance, including the United States, have not adopted an unequivocal
position. Thus, in a crisis, [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} [might be
[**tempted** to **test the West**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in a
place]{.underline} [few have]{.underline} [thought about]{.underline}.
(On these divisions and especially on the ambivalent US position, see
National Defense University Press, November 8, 2018.)

[Such a crisis now appears to be brewing]{.underline}, the result of an
extraordinary mix of developments coming together:

First, [[Moscow is]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly [[**angry**
about]{.mark} the [West's]{.mark}]{.underline} growing
[**[projection]{.mark} of power** [in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline},
one the Kremlin believes [Russia has [no choice but
to]{.mark}]{.underline} oppose to [**[defend]{.mark}** the [entrance to
the N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea [R]{.mark}oute]{.underline} and
support its expansive claims to the Arctic seabed (see EDM, June 7,
2022; Korabel.ru, May 20; Fond Strategicheskoi Kul'tury, May 24;
Live24.ru; Segodnia.ru, May 27).

Second, ever [more [Russian officials]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
comparison to two years ago, [are [suggesting]{.mark} that
[Norway]{.mark} has [allowed]{.mark} the [West to **militarize
Svalbard**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} thus]{.underline} has
[**[lost]{.mark} the [right]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} claim]{.underline}
**[[sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the archipelago (Svobodnaya
Pressa, May 11; Segodnia.ru, May 27).

Third, [the Russian Federation]{.underline}, for the first time,
[enjoys]{.underline} the [**support of China** on this]{.underline}
issue. Beijing has now called for the development of a seed vault in
Russia to replace the one in Svalbard and has simultaneously dispatched
a new research expedition to the Norwegian archipelago to show the flag
(T.me/first_arctic, May 5; TASS, May 7; Yakutiya24, May 8; NewsX, May
18; Vybor Naroda, May 28).

Fourth, [international [demand for **coal**]{.mark} has been
rising]{.underline}, and the [rapid warming of Svalbard]{.underline},
currently running at twice the rate of the Arctic in general, [is making
mining there]{.underline} an **[[increasingly
attractive]{.underline}]{.mark}** option [[for
Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which sees]{.underline} such [sales as
helping to]{.underline} maintain its economy and project
**[power]{.underline}** (RG.ru, May 7).

Fifth, in what may prove the black swan of this trend, a [parcel of
private land in Svalbard]{.underline} larger than Manhattan [has been
put up **for sale**, sparking]{.underline} [fears]{.underline} [that
whoever purchases]{.underline} [it will **use it against**
the]{.underline} interests of one side or the [other]{.underline}
(Bloomberg, May 10; Svobodnaya Pressa; Fontanka.ru, May 11).

So far, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has largely limited its response
to patriotic actions among Russians in Svalbard beyond propaganda
campaigns in Russia about the Svalbard situation. However, it has
[[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} its [**[military]{.mark} actions**
in]{.underline} [the area [around the archipelago]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Izvestiya, May 10; Smotrim.ru, May 21; The Barents Observer, May 26,
29; Info24.ru, May 29). Some may assume that the current upsurge in
tensions will ease and be resolved in much the same way the crisis was
two years ago, especially as some Russian businesses are very publicly
talking about organizing Russian tourism to Svalbard, visits that,
because of the 1920 treaty, would not require visas but could be used to
test Norway's position (Epigraph, April 5). Such an outcome is certainly
to be desired, but it is far from certain, especially given the
[overheated atmosphere]{.underline} [in the Kremlin]{.underline} [and
Putin's search for **new targets**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
threaten and [undermine the West]{.underline} [and]{.underline} its
[support for Ukraine.]{.underline}

[[To]{.underline} [ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark}, a place mostly known, if at all, in the
past for having more polar bears than people, [[does not become a
**casus belli**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[NATO needs to adopt a **common
position**]{.underline} [regarding]{.underline}]{.mark} the [defense of
[Svalbard]{.mark}]{.underline} against any Russian attack. A
[[failure]{.mark} to do that will]{.underline} only [[increase]{.mark}
the **[likelihood]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that [Putin
will]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[target]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[this]{.underline} isolated archipelago [as the next step in his
campaign to **weaken the West**]{.underline}.

### U\-\--Invasion\-\--1AR

#### Russian [accusation]{.underline} of Western [militarization]{.underline} greenlights [invasion]{.underline}.

Elisabeth **Braw 25**, Swedish security expert and former journalist
active in Great Britain. She leads the Modern Deterrence project at the
defense and security think tank RUSI in London, \"We need to pay closer
attention to Svalbard," POLITICO,
https://www.politico.eu/article/we-need-to-pay-closer-attention-to-svalbard/,
3-26-2025//ILake-AW

The facts, however, are these: [[Svalbard **isn't involved** in
Norway's]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[military]{.underline}]{.mark} and
political [planning]{.underline}." [There's no Norwegian military use of
the archipelago]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline} especially [no such
use by **NATO** or the **U.S**.]{.underline} [The]{.underline}
[[Svalbard Treaty **prohibits**]{.underline}]{.mark} naval bases and
**[military fortifications]{.underline}**, and there are no such
installations on any of the islands --- though Norwegian naval vessels
do patrol the waters around the archipelago, and the Norwegian armed
forces assist local authorities' crisis response, as happened in 2017,
when a Russian helicopter crashed near Svalbard's largest town,
Barentsburg.

Rather, [the party upsetting]{.underline} [the apple cart is
**[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} seems to
[**[resent]{.mark} the [demise]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} its Soviet [glory
da]{.mark}ys]{.underline} on Svalbard. More troublingly, [the
Kremlin]{.underline} also seems to [[view]{.mark} the
[archipelago]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as]{.mark} a [place
to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[test]{.underline}** new [ways of **asserting
itself** and **[undermin]{.mark}ing [the West]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A
sanctioned Russian official arriving on Svalbard without permission, the
head of Arktikugol [[planting a **Soviet flag** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
a **[[Victory Day parade]{.underline}]{.mark}** (even though the Nazis
never occupied Svalbard) --- these [are [all]{.mark}]{.underline}
unsubtle [[provocations]{.underline}]{.mark} the Norwegian government
can do little about.

And now the Kremlin has upped the ante.

[[In **accusing** Oslo of **violating**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**Svalbard Treaty**]{.underline}, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[given]{.mark} itself [the option]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of
**responding** to this]{.mark} alleged violation. It's a move that
[follows]{.mark} Moscow's [playbook in **Ukraine**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[where]{.underline} [it]{.underline} has, at various points, [claimed to
be **responding** to Ukrainian misdeeds]{.underline}. And while Norway
can insist it's not violating the Svalbard Treaty, that's hardly going
to convince a regime that's operationalized peddling untruths.

### IL\-\--Svalbard\-\--1AR

With tensions simmering in the High North, and Russian aggression a

[[to]{.mark}]{.underline} help [**[secure]{.underline}** [the

Double-edged cooperation

[[Norway can count]{.underline} [on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[US]{.mark}A [and NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[event of]{.mark}]{.underline} a possible
**[[attack on Svalbard]{.underline}]{.mark}**, believes Stian Bones,
History Professor at UiT The Arctic University of Norway. Yet, he also
problematizes the defense cooperation with the USA in light of the Trump
Administration\'s behavior.

\"[**[Everything]{.mark}** the USA]{.underline} has [[done]{.mark} in
the Nordic region and]{.underline} the [Arctic]{.underline} also [[after
Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} became president this winter
[[indicates]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[the country **still**
prioritizes]{.underline} [**military presence** in the
North]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} The reason for that is very
clear: [[the US]{.mark}A [has]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the world\'s
strongest military power, a [[**permanent interest** in keeping watch on
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although the US focus is pivoting more
toward Asia, the [**[nuclear submarines]{.mark}** on the **Kola
Peninsula** [remain a threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to the US,\" Bones
points out and continues:

### Impact\-\--Svalbard\-\--AT: Defense

[This is a fragile, **tense situation**]{.underline}
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[Russia and
Norway]{.mark},]{.underline} where [the chance]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} an accident or

Forgotten history

[Norway]{.underline}, a founding member of NATO, [borders Russia on the
Barents]{.underline} [Sea]{.underline} in the Arctic Ocean. A look at
the map will show the City of Murmansk, [Russia's only ice-free
port]{.underline} [and **sole access**]{.underline} [to the
Atlantic]{.underline} [Ocean]{.underline}. [The [Russian Navy's
**nuclear**]{.mark} **submarine [fleet]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the [inlets
**[nearby]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They are armed with nuclear ballistic
and cruise missiles [[targeted at the **U**]{.mark}**nited
[S]{.mark}tates.**]{.underline}

[Russian heavy bombers]{.underline}, similar to American B-52s, now
[fly]{.underline} the 1200-mile [route]{.underline} [from **Murmansk**
to drop]{.underline} their [payloads in Ukraine]{.underline}. In return,
Ukraine sends attack drones to Murmansk. The social media photos from
Murmansk show grieving mothers clutching flowers in front of fresh
graves at new cemeteries full of the area's sons killed by the fighting
in Ukraine.

Based on American technology, a [Norwegian mobile air
defense]{.underline} [system]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [being
tested]{.underline} [at]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [new]{.underline}
Andøya base [for long-range drones.]{.underline} This is a variant of
the surface-to-air system that shoots down the Russian drones attacking
Kyiv.

The Russian [[invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
the subsequent [[**threats** of]{.mark}]{.underline} the use of
**[[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** by President Putin
has [[brought Norway]{.mark}]{.underline} back [[to **Viking
mode**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

All of [this is in reaction]{.underline} [to
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} [building]{.underline} [up]{.underline} its
[nuclear]{.underline} [submarine fleet]{.underline} [and
[**provocative** nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline} war
[[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark} by its navy [near Norway.]{.underline}

[[Adding to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} [of
conflict]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the recent [malicious
[damage to **undersea cables**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in
Norwegian]{.underline} [waters]{.underline}, including the main
communication link to Evenes airbase in north Norway, NATO's first line
of defense nearest Russia.

Alas, the [Russians]{.underline} have now [**ended cooperation**
on]{.underline} the [safekeeping]{.underline} [of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} and waste relating to the Russian Navy based in
Murmansk in place since 1997.

I had a hand in negotiating the original agreement and made many trips
to Murmansk. On each trip, I passed by the Valley of Glory, where
thousands of Soviet (and German) troops died over the five-year battle
to prevent Adolf Hitler from taking the port of Murmansk.

The Soviet Red Army liberated northern Norway from the German
occupation. After the war, the Soviets left, went home, and closed the
border again. Only in the early 1990s---after the dissolution of the
Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War---did a new border crossing
open. It was a symbol of the optimistic years of the 20th century for
America and Europe.

Ferdinand the bull could be found again in his field of flowers.

But memories are short, and things fell apart again in the Arctic after
the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Norwegian health authorities sent stockpiles of iodine pills to all
parts of the country to be taken in case of radioactive fallout from a
nuclear weapons accident. Iodine tablets block the absorption of
radioactive material by the thyroid gland and reduce the risk of
contracting cancer.

Moreover, on January 10, 2025, [the [P]{.mark}rime
[M]{.mark}inister's]{.underline} office [[issued]{.underline}]{.mark} a
white [[paper]{.underline}]{.mark} to local governments and the general
populace [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} "total
[[preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark}...[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} crisis
and **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

"We are taking steps to ensure that civil society is equipped to deal
with a crisis or war. Our civil society must be able to back up military
efforts and withstand complex threats," said Prime Minister Jonas Gahr
Støre.

The [document addressed]{.underline} the recent "pandemic, extreme
weather events and cyber attacks," Norway faced, but also [Russia's
**threats to NATO** and its allies]{.underline}.

Almost World War III

Amid all this reckless Russian saber-rattling, we can count on the
Norwegians to do the right thing. They have dealt with the Russians on
their border for a thousand years. But [it all can go wrong, just **by
accident**]{.underline}.

I spent January 18-20, 1995, at the Andøya Rocket Range to witness the
launch of an American research rocket.

The [[launch]{.underline}]{.mark} was [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} powerful [**[Black Brant XII]{.mark}**,]{.underline}
which would peak at 1,400 kilometers [over]{.underline} the Norwegian
island of **[Svalbard]{.underline}**. It was part of a research project
by Cornell University to gather daytime data on the northern lights.
They had obtained the US rocket under a NASA program.

Bad weather at the Range delayed the launch, and I returned to Oslo for
meetings with the departing Russian Ambassador. On January 25, the
launch went off---and within seconds, the Russian early warning radar
system near Murmansk tagged it as a possible nuclear missile attack by
the United States.

This rocket\'s speed and suspicious trajectory
[[triggered]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[mid-level **automated
alert**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} the [first steps of the
Russian response began]{.underline}. The missile stayed on its course,
with the last stage dropping into the sea 320 kilometers northeast of
Svalbard. It did not enter Russian airspace, and [the alert was **over**
before the Russian]{.underline} [general]{.underline} [in charge could
get]{.underline} from his nearby office [to the command-and-control
center]{.underline}.

Word of this alert reached the Russian news service Interfax. It was
first reported that a rocket had been shot down. This was quickly
corrected, but the next day, Russian President Boris Yeltsin was quoted
as saying he had been given the "black box," the instrument with the
keys to launch a nuclear counterattack.

The Russian economy and government were in shambles at this time, and
there were domestic political reasons for the mercurial president to
appear strong and in charge.

Within two days, the world press treated the incident as a farce and an
example of Russian incompetence. It was not a joke, and we are all
lucky. A lot could have ended in tragedy.

Fortunately, the Black Brant remained on course and did not enter
Russian airspace, and the Russian early warning system and those in
control of it that day acted appropriately. Had the missile been
perceived as a threatening nuclear missile, the outcome could have been
disastrous.

On January 26, the day after the incident, I was with the Russian
ambassador for his farewell reception. I certainly did not mention to
him (and saw no reason to report to the State Department) that I had
been at Andøya just before this launch. We said goodbye and wished each
other good luck and, with a full-throated "Nostrovia!" ("Cheers!") threw
down a shot of vodka.

It's time to stop this cat-and-mouse game in which both sides think they
are the cat. [[Both sides]{.underline} [believe]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[potential for]{.mark} an **[accident]{.mark}al nuclear incident** [is
high]{.mark}]{.underline}---obviously, Norway's Prime Minister thinks
so. [It's important to recognize]{.underline} the essential [role of
**diplomacy** and **cooperation** with]{.underline} our
[allies]{.underline}---and even our enemies---when it comes to nuclear
security.

We need to learn from the past, and [[the **US** needs to]{.mark} again
[take a **leadership role** in avoiding **nuclear
annihilation**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

NATO's Response to Strategic Normalization of the Arctic Region

[How are **NATO's**]{.underline} Arctic member [states]{.underline}
**[positioned to match]{.underline}** the [growing Russian-Chinese
**strategic presence** in the Arctic]{.underline} [and
provide]{.underline} **[credible deterrence]{.underline}** of Russia and
China? In principle, they dominate the region with more advanced
economic, technological, and military resources. Since 2014, NATO has
enhanced its strategic reach, readiness, and deterrence in the Arctic.
The US has prioritized protecting freedom of navigation and coordination
with its European allies, and deployed additional troops and equipment,
especially in Norway and Iceland. In addition, NATO has increased its
exercise and training tempo, enhanced its intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance capabilities, and strengthened intelligence-sharing
among allies and partners.21

Nevertheless, [when]{.underline} [compared to Russia's]{.underline}
**[militarization]{.underline}** of [and]{.underline} [**collaboration**

[**neglected** by the US]{.underline} [and its NATO allies]{.underline}.
Following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, [NATO]{.underline}
[countries]{.underline} [thought]{.underline} that [Russia would be
**too preoccupied** in Ukraine]{.underline} [to develop]{.underline} its
economic and military [presence in the Arctic]{.underline}.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has burdened the Russian economy, including
its Arctic projects. The target deadlines of many projects have been
postponed. However, [Arctic **energy resources**]{.underline} [and
**military-strategic control** along the Northern Sea Route is **too
significant** for Russia's economic]{.underline}
[development]{.underline} [and]{.underline} its [**geopolitical
influence** to relinquish]{.underline} its [Arctic development
plans]{.underline}. The [**economic** and **strategic importance** of
the Arctic]{.underline} has [prompted Moscow to **align**]{.underline}
its [regional agenda]{.underline} more [closely with **Chinese
interests**]{.underline} to attract more resources and collaboration
from Beijing. Officially, some Chinese companies have withdrawn from
some Arctic projects because of Western sanctions, such as the LNG-2
project. However, [**hybrid activities** such as]{.underline} [grey-zone
vessels]{.underline} [transporting]{.underline} [energy]{.underline}
resources from Russia [to China]{.underline} [and continued]{.underline}
[export of **dual-use components**]{.underline} from China to Russia
that can be used [for military purposes]{.underline} are [frequently
detected]{.underline}. And [China]{.underline} still [plays a
major]{.underline} economic [role in the **LNG-2** project]{.underline}.
[Russian and Chinese]{.underline} [interests in **circumventing
sanctions** to strengthen]{.underline} their [Arctic
cooperation]{.underline} [trump concern]{.underline} about the
consequences of breaching sanctions. This has [allowed]{.underline}
[Moscow to]{.underline} continue to [strengthen]{.underline} its
economic engagements, technological [development]{.underline} efforts
[and **defense posture**]{.underline} in the region, although at a
slower pace than before Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.22

[NATO]{.underline} has [been **slow**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
[recognize]{.underline} [that the Arctic]{.underline} [has developed
into an area of security]{.underline} and defense concerns, [writing off
Russia's gradual military build-up as]{.underline} necessary for
**[patrolling]{.underline}** its increasingly busy territorial waters
and protecting its legal claims to the seabed. The High North was not
mentioned in the alliance's summit communiqués until the 2021 Brussels
Summit. Even then, NATO agreed merely to continue to undertake
necessary, calibrated, and coordinated activities in support of the
alliance's security interests in the High North.23 NATOs 2024 summit
communiqué merely states that the historic accession of Finland and
Sweden makes them safer and our alliance stronger, including in the High
North.24 Like the term "North Atlantic," which loosely encompasses the
ice-free part of the Arctic, "High North" is a somewhat nebulous
political concept.25 By using the term, [NATO **avoided committing** to
the security]{.underline} of a particular geographical area. This
[reflects]{.underline} **[intra-alliance disagreement]{.underline}** [on
the role of NATO]{.underline} [in the Arctic]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [hence]{.underline} [the **absence** of a **NATO
strategy** for the region.]{.underline}

Among NATO member states with coastlines on the Arctic Ocean, Canada has
been the most critical of alliance engagement in the Arctic. Ottawa has
shared the Russian view that, as Arctic coastal states, Canada, Denmark,
Norway, Russia, and the US have territorial and maritime rights and
obligations that entitle them to a special role in Arctic governance.
Both Canada and Russia, however, claim exclusive rights over the sea
routes that would traverse through waters adjacent to their coastline,
the Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route, respectively.

Canada's position is that, under the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Northwest Passage constitutes internal
waters. Under the same UNCLOS provision, Russia asserts the right to
administer the Northern Sea Route as an ice-covered area and regards the
route as internal waters. The United States challenges both positions,
arguing that the two passages are straits through which states enjoy
transit rights.26

If NATO became recognized as an institution with legitimate Arctic
interests, it would be harder for Canada to sustain the argument of
special territorial and maritime rights and obligations. But NATO is
unlikely to be able to agree on a unified approach to the Arctic any
time soon. Nevertheless, the alliance is playing a de facto role in the
Arctic by virtue of its defense commitments to Arctic member states. In
addition, NATO's political status as a North Atlantic alliance
legitimizes its protection of the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom
(GIUK) gap and the Scandinavian coastline, which together constitute the
supply route between North America and Northern Europe and are situated
in ice-free parts of the Arctic.

[As an **Arctic power**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} a potential
[**target** of Russia's]{.underline} **[nuclear posture]{.underline}**
[in the Arctic]{.underline}, [the United States]{.underline}
[published]{.underline} a new [**defense strateg**y for]{.underline} the
Arctic twelve days after [the]{.underline} [2024 NATO
summit]{.underline}, [signaling that]{.underline} although the alliance
does not have an Arctic strategy, [Washington]{.underline} [is
determined]{.underline} [to make it a **priority**]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} the [Arctic NATO]{.underline} [member
states]{.underline}. The US Department of Defense
[emphasizes]{.underline} the [need for]{.underline} effective
**[oversight]{.underline}** over activity in the region
[through]{.underline} strengthened monitoring and [enhanced all**ied
cooperation**]{.underline} [to establish **credible deterrence** of
Russia and China]{.underline}.27

To counter Russian and Chinese influence, at the NATO summit [the US
announced]{.underline} [agreement on an **ice pact** among]{.underline}
[it]{.underline}, [Canada, and Finland.]{.underline} Both the US and
Canada have allocated resources to invest in new icebreakers.28 This is
just the beginning of allied cooperation to provide credible deterrence
in the Arctic region, if the US has its way. The ice pact
[demonstrates]{.underline} [that **allied cooperation**]{.underline} [on
establishing credible]{.underline} [deterrence]{.underline} [**trumps
different views** on the **rights and obligations**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [Arctic coastal states]{.underline}.

[Another priority is to]{.underline} [strengthen]{.underline}
**[monitoring]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} activities in [the
Arctic]{.underline}. [Satellites]{.underline} and [unmanned
systems]{.underline} play a [key]{.underline} role [in]{.underline} this
part of the [US strategy]{.underline}. In the space domain, the
[US]{.underline} has [**allocated resources** to upgrade]{.underline}
the Pituffik [Space Base]{.underline} in northwest Greenland. In
addition, new missile warning and tracking and communications and
weather satellites are on the agenda. However, polar specific systems
are required for adequate coverage, requiring research, development, and
testing. This is also the case with another priority area: uncrewed
systems designed for polar conditions and tasked with sensing missions
and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The US Space Force
has invested in overhead persistent infrared polar-orbit satellites for
missile warning, and the Space Development Agency is putting many of its
satellites in polar orbit. The US Air Force is working with commercial
companies such as SpaceX and OneWeb to invest in polar coverage and
field hybrid satellite communications terminals for commercial companies
to access multiple satellite constellations in polar orbit.29

[Norway]{.underline} [is]{.underline} an **[important]{.underline}**
cooperation [partner in the]{.underline} [**space domain**. The US
Department of Defense]{.underline} [is working with Oslo to put a
communications payload]{.underline} on a Norwegian satellite scheduled
[to be launched]{.underline} [soon]{.underline}. It also recognizes a
need for more ground stations to create redundancy regarding
communication assets that are critical for the national security of
NATO's Arctic member states. Norway and the United States may therefore
host additional ground stations in the future.

As Russia and China step up their military exercises and activities in
the Pacific in and near the Bering Sea, the Bering Strait has become a
critical choke point on a par with the Barents Sea near northern Norway.
Within a decade, China is likely to transit the strait with near silent
ballistic missile submarines. A [stronger monitoring]{.underline}
network [by means of **fiber-optic acoustic**]{.underline} sensors in
locations such as St. Lawrence Island and Svalbard to [detect submarine
traffic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} other transits would [help NATO
allies improve]{.underline} their [**situational
awareness**.]{.underline} Secure communications infrastructure across
the Arctic is [essential to **safeguard** maritime]{.underline}
[**transportation routes** and protect critical assets from **hybrid
warfare**.]{.underline}

[Another focus]{.underline} area [is **maritime surface
capabilities**]{.underline}. Here, [allied cooperation]{.underline}
[will]{.underline} also [be **essential**]{.underline}. The US defense
budget for the Arctic focuses on capabilities designed to protect the US
homeland. Capabilities for defense and deterrence outside of US Arctic
territory and maritime zone claims and US-controlled bases such as
Pituffik Space Base in Greenland will most likely have to be paid for by
other NATO allies.

The announcement at the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. in July 2024 of
a trilateral Icebreaker Collaboration Effort ([ICE) pact]{.underline}
among the US, Canada, and Finland to build icebreakers and other polar
capabilities for the Arctic region [is an **important first step**
to]{.underline} [demonstrate allied defense industrial
collaboration]{.underline} on upgrading the maritime deterrent of NATO's
Arctic allies. Finnish shipyards have built icebreaker hulls, primarily
for Russia until its invasion of Ukraine when sanctions put a stop to
the trade. The pact promises that Finnish and Canadian shipyards will
have new customers from the NATO alliance. Both the US and Canada need
new icebreakers. The US Coast Guard has announced that it needs eight to
ten. Part of the ICE pact involves Canadian shipyards building two
icebreakers in Vancouver and six in Quebec, and they may also be
producing new US icebreakers in the future.30

The US has announced that they would host a roundtable to discuss how to
strengthen allied cooperation in the Arctic,31 no doubt including which
capabilities Norway and Denmark are to acquire to patrol the area from
the Barents Sea to the GIUK Gap where Russian submarines transit, often
without being detected. NATO's Arctic supply lines between North America
and northern Europe that run through the Bear gap between Svalbard and
Scandinavia and the GIUK gap between Scotland and Greenland are crucial
to deter Russia from attacking Europe. Russia is testing NATO defenses
in this area, and they are often found wanting. And it is not just
Russian submarines that transit without being detected. At regular
intervals, Russian warships are intercepted as far down as Faroese
waters without prior notification from Norwegian authorities.32

[**Insufficient communication** and capabilities **leave big gaps** in
NATO's]{.underline} [maritime Arctic]{.underline}
[defenses]{.underline}. [Neither **Norway** nor **Denmark** has
capacities such as **ice-strengthened frigates**]{.underline} with
anti-air and helicopter-based anti-submarine equipment [that can detect
and **pursue submarines** and defend themselves]{.underline}. In 2024,
Norway announced the acquisition of five new frigates and five
submarines. Details of the frigates have not been disclosed, but it
would be surprising if they are not equipped to hunt submarines. Denmark
has yet to decide which ships to invest in. Greenland has demanded that
Denmark invest in coastguard vessels. Greenland worries that warships
will ramp up tension levels and leave the country in the middle of
high-intensity conflict. On the other hand, [warships]{.underline}
[capable of submarine hunting are a **high priority** for the US because
it is a homeland **security issue**]{.underline}. The issue of surface
vessel acquisition is therefore likely to be a central topic for
discussion at the Arctic roundtable.

In addition, acquisition of **[unmanned underwater
vehicles]{.underline}** designed [for the Arctic climate]{.underline} to
[ensure improved situational awareness and communication between
allies]{.underline} is also likely to be a topic for roundtable
discussion. All Arctic NATO countries have difficulties persuading
defense and coastguard personnel to take up positions in the Arctic
because of its remoteness and extreme weather conditions. It leads to
frequent changeovers of staff and, as a result, many people on duty lack
the training to perform key tasks. Unmanned vehicles can make a big
difference to solve this issue. However, they require resources not only
to acquire, but also to research, develop, and test equipment. And
unmanned vehicles also require personnel with specialized skills to be
operated. This adds significantly to the cost of these capabilities.

[NATO's **inability to agree** on]{.underline} an [Arctic
strategy]{.underline} [means]{.underline} that [NATO **lacks**
Arctic-capable]{.underline} [capacities]{.underline}. With so much focus
on defense budgets of two percent as a minimum target that may soon be
increased, [all]{.underline} the [Arctic NATO member states]{.underline}
[**except for the US** have]{.underline} **[difficulties justifying
spending]{.underline}** [on capabilities that **do not** count as
**contributions** to NATO capabilities targets]{.underline}. Another
topic for the Arctic roundtable might be how to revise the capabilities
targets so they acknowledge expensive investments in capabilities that
are of central importance to North-Atlantic security.

### IL\-\--1AR

#### NATO cooperation [contains]{.underline} Russia.

Thus, [Washington]{.underline} [prefers to keep]{.underline} its
[European allies in]{.underline} a [**waiting mode**,]{.underline}
[not]{.underline} [blocking]{.underline} the [Arctic line of
communication, but also **not supporting it**]{.underline} with an
interested dialogue. However, it does quite clearly outline the key
interests of the United States, which will underlie American decisions:
"The [activities of **China** and **Russia**]{.underline} [in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} their [**growing
cooperation**, NATO expansion, and]{.underline} the growing [impacts of
**climate change**]{.underline}, [foreshadow]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} new, more [**dynamic** Arctic security
environment]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} changes, as well as
increased cooperation between Russia and China, [have]{.underline} the
[potential to change]{.underline} the picture of
**[stability]{.underline}** and threats in the Arctic. [They also
provide the **Department of Defense**]{.underline} [with]{.underline}
the [ability to enhance]{.underline} regional [security by **deepening
cooperation**]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [allies]{.underline} and
partners" (2024 Arctic Strategy... 2024).

In the situation of NATO's Arctic swings, the European camp of
supporters of the alliance's involvement in the Arctic is seeking to
strengthen its position by consolidating its own contribution to
collective defense. **[Finland]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**Sweden** have]{.underline} [strengthened]{.underline} their [course
on defense cooperation with the United States]{.underline}, including
[on]{.underline} the [basis of bilateral agreements]{.underline} [on
defense cooperation]{.underline} in December 2023. The NORDEFCO format,
which had previously allowed NATO to develop interoperability programs
using the alliance's partnership mechanisms with the northern neutral
states, has proven to be very convenient. Now that all five members of
the Nordic Defense Cooperation are members of NATO, the military
component of coordination and cooperation in NORDEFCO has been
significantly strengthened. The emphasis is not only on compatibility
with NATO, but also on planning "northern cooperation" within the
framework of NATO concepts and strategy, as confirmed by the Danish
NORDEFCO Chairmanship (since January 1, 2024) (Denmark, Chair... 2024).

The [appointment of Mark Rutte]{.underline} as Secretary General of the
Alliance on 1 October 2024 can also be seen as an additional resource
for [moving]{.underline} the [discussion of NATO policy]{.underline} [in
the Arctic towards]{.underline} the [preparation of **practical
decisions**]{.underline} and conceptual guidelines, [especially
in]{.underline} the [context of]{.underline} a [**change** in the
**American administration**]{.underline}. It is significant that Rutte,
during his visit to Germany at the beginning of November 2024, stated
that if Russia wins in Ukraine, it "will not stop there," and "the
movement of the front in this war is no longer limited to Ukraine, the
front is increasingly moving beyond the borders to the Baltic region,
Western Europe and the Far North." (Rutte decided to convince... 2024).

With his apparent inability to defeat Russia in Ukraine,
[Rutte]{.underline} faces the increasingly acute [dilemma of finding new
transatlantic balances and]{.underline}, above all, [**demonstrating**
to the]{.underline} new [US]{.underline} administration [why they **need
Europe**]{.underline}. He will, of course, look for additional arguments
to convince European allies to increase their contribution to NATO and
is already doing so, and to convince in such a way that it would be
interesting to North America, the United States. "Whether the Arctic
agenda will enter the matrix of these interests is not yet clear.
However, it is clear that the North of Europe will be included: The
Baltic region, the North..." (Danilov, Vyakhereva 2024). It cannot be
ruled out that [both Europeans and Americans will be interested in
establishing]{.underline} **[containment]{.underline}** there. In
practice, we are talking about [potential systems for
limiting]{.underline} the [capabilities of Russian **air
defense**]{.underline} [and **missile defense** systems]{.underline},
and about [providing]{.underline} the alliance with information,
intelligence, and electronic [**coverage** of the northern
Arctic]{.underline} [space]{.underline}. [NATO's
advancement]{.underline} in this direction is entirely possible, but it
[depends on **how interested**]{.underline} [the United]{.underline}
[States]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [in these resources]{.underline},
[or whether it will **continue to use**]{.underline} traditional
[bilateral channels]{.underline}, primarily without NATO's direct
involvement.

THE CASE FOR NATO

Currently, [[the Arctic lacks]{.underline}]{.mark} a single
**[comprehensive [governance]{.mark}]{.underline}** regime [focused on
regional **security issues**]{.underline}, [making]{.underline} the
[management of]{.underline} [the region's]{.underline} rapid
[transformation a]{.underline} major [**challenge** for the Arctic
states]{.underline}. While [the **[Arctic Council]{.mark}**]{.underline}
has "promoted cooperative governance in the region,"1 [its]{.underline}
[flexible structure and]{.underline} legally [[non-binding norms]{.mark}
are [**insufficient** to ameliorate]{.mark} the **[governance
gap]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the long-term. [[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} [presently **[lacks]{.mark}**
crucial]{.underline} [capabilities]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
regional [[**leverage** to keep]{.underline} [pace]{.underline}]{.mark}
[with]{.underline} the rate of [transformation to provide]{.underline}
regional [stability]{.underline}. Compounding the issue, "[[the
rest]{.mark} of the Arctic states]{.underline}\...[[cannot]{.mark} **by
themselves**]{.underline} [[balance]{.underline}]{.mark} [competing
**[great powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the region."2 [To
ensure]{.underline} that [the Arctic remains a domain built on
**cooperation** and **diplomacy**, [the West needs]{.mark} to
commit]{.underline} to [a **coherent [security
strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline} to address growing competition and
uncertainty. [Otherwise, [they risk]{.mark}]{.underline} [having
[**insufficient means** to]{.mark} regulate]{.underline} interstate
[relations or **[deconflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} geopolitical
[tensions.]{.underline}

[[NATO]{.mark} has]{.underline} a [**significant interest**
in]{.underline} preserving and [[enhancing]{.mark}]{.underline} the
Arctic's **[[rules-based order]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
[includes]{.underline} open [access to global]{.underline} sea [lines of
**communication**]{.underline}, protecting transatlantic communications
cable networks, and [[preventing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Russia]{.underline} from [exercising unilateral **[military
control]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the region. In the pursuit of these
interests, [[NATO is]{.mark} the **[ideal]{.mark} candidate** [to
promote]{.mark}]{.underline} regional [stability and
**[norm-setting]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[due to]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[foundational principles]{.mark}, strategic]{.underline}
[mission]{.underline}, **[multilateral authority]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.mark} defensive and **[deterrence]{.mark}**
capabilities]{.underline}. NATO was founded in part as a norm-building
institution, to promote European security and stability through the
development and formalization of political relationships between states
both inside and outside of the alliance.3 By including the Arctic in
NATO's purview [the]{.underline} [alliance]{.underline}
[can]{.underline} [use]{.underline} its [norm-building role to [impress
**rule of law**]{.mark} and promote the]{.underline} peaceful
[settlement]{.underline} of disputes. Moreover, the current [NATO
strategy incorporates]{.underline} a 360-degree [approach]{.underline}
that seeks [to]{.underline} "acknowledge and [[address]{.underline}
[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} and challenges from diverse actors and
[[from **all directions**]{.underline}]{.mark}."4 It is through this
approach that NATO expanded its purview to include Eastern Europe, North
Africa, and the Middle East. [As Russia]{.underline} continues its
[military]{.underline} [modernization]{.underline} efforts in the
Arctic, [concerns over **instability**]{.underline} and geopolitical
competition [grow]{.underline}. A [strategic reorientation]{.underline}
[toward the polar]{.underline} [region]{.underline} would [serve
as]{.underline} a legitimate [**progression** for NATO]{.underline},
given five of the eight internationally recognized Arctic states are
members of NATO. To be certain, [[NATO]{.mark} could
[wield]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}**[immense [multilateral
authority]{.mark}]{.underline}** in a region which is strategically
important to Euro-Atlantic security.5 Ultimately, [NATO's defense and
deterrence [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[provide]{.underline} the most **[compelling
justification]{.underline}** for it [to [counter
Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} expansive
[[militarization]{.underline}]{.mark} efforts in the Arctic, [enabling
it to [strengthen]{.mark} the]{.underline} region's [[rules-based
order]{.underline}]{.mark}. For NATO, "Russian militarization risks
transforming Arctic relations, and \[the alliance\] will not want to be
left unprepared."6 In this case, [[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} [may
[prove **ineffective**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and [legal
**ambiguity**]{.mark}]{.underline} could [[incentivize **Russian
revisionism**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Deterrence\-\--AT: Cooperation\-\--2AC

#### NATO-Russia relations have empirically failed

**NATO 24**. \[North Atlantic Treaty Organization. "Relations with
Russia". 08/05/2024.
https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50090.htm#response\] NRout

[For more than 30 years, [**NATO tried to build a partnership** with
Russia]{.mark}, developing dialogue and]{.underline} practical
[coop]{.underline}eration [in areas of common interest]{.underline}.
Today, [[however, relations]{.mark} between NATO and Russia [are at
their lowest point]{.mark}]{.underline} since the Cold War.

\<\<\<TEXT CONDENSED\>\>\>

NATO-Russia relations began after the end of the Cold War and the
dissolution of the Soviet Union, when Russia joined the North Atlantic
Cooperation Council (1991). This forum for dialogue was succeeded in
1997 by the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, which brings together
Allies and partner countries in the Euro-Atlantic area. Practical
cooperation started after Russia joined the Partnership for Peace
programme (1994) and deployed peacekeepers in support of NATO-led
peace-support operations in the Western Balkans in the late 1990s. The
1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act provided the formal basis for bilateral
relations, including by establishing the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint
Council (PJC) as a forum for consultation and cooperation. Russia froze
its relations with NATO because of differences over the Kosovo crisis in
1999, but resumed cooperation activities -- including participation in
the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) -- and meetings within the PJC
following the end of NATO's air campaign in Kosovo. Dialogue and
cooperation were strengthened in 2002, when the PJC was replaced by the
NATO-Russia Council (NRC), established by the 2002 Rome Declaration to
serve as a forum for consultation, consensus-building, cooperation,
joint decision-making and joint action. Within the NRC, the individual
NATO member states and Russia have worked as equal partners on a wide
spectrum of security issues of common interest. To facilitate regular
contacts and cooperation, NATO and Russia agreed to create political and
military channels of communication. To that end, Russia established a
diplomatic mission to NATO in 1998. NATO opened an Information Office in
Moscow (NIO) in 2001 and a Military Liaison Mission (MLM) in 2002. The
NIO served as the focal point for disseminating information within
Russia on NATO, contributing to the Russian public's understanding of
evolving relations between the Russian Federation and NATO. The NIO
contributed to these objectives by distributing NATO official
information through print and digital channels to the Russian public,
sponsoring communications projects by Russian non-governmental
organisations and providing information on NATO's educational and
scientific programmes for Russian institutions and potential Russian
applicants. It also organised visits for Russian visitors to NATO
Headquarters in Brussels and other NATO sites, as well as for NATO
representatives to the Russian Federation. The MLM contributed to
NATO-Russia relations by maintaining an open channel of communication
between NATO\'s Military Committee in Brussels and the Ministry of
Defence of the Russian Federation. Maintaining a channel of
military-to-military communication helped to increase predictability and
reduce the risk of misunderstandings that could lead to conflicts.
Russia\'s disproportionate military action in Georgia in August 2008 led
to the temporary suspension of formal meetings of the NRC and
cooperation in some areas; meetings and cooperation resumed in spring
2009. Allies continue to condemn Russia's decision to recognise the
Georgian regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states and
call on Russia to reverse its recognition of these regions.

\<\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>\>

[[All]{.mark} practical civilian and military [coop]{.mark}eration with
Russia [was suspended]{.mark} in]{.underline} April [2014, [in
**response to**]{.mark} **Russia's military intervention**]{.underline}
and aggressive actions [in [Ukraine, and]{.mark}]{.underline} its
illegal and illegitimate annexation of [[Crimea]{.mark}, which
NATO]{.underline} Allies [do not and will never recognise]{.underline}.

[In]{.underline} October [2021, Russia suspended the work of its
diplomatic mission to NATO]{.underline}, and required NATO to close down
the NATO Information Office in Moscow and suspend the work of the NATO
Military Liaison Mission in Moscow. [NATO regrets Russia's decision to
curtail]{.underline} political [channels of communication and
dialogue]{.underline}. [[NATO remains committed to]{.underline}]{.mark}
making use of the existing military lines of communication between both
sides to [promote predictability and [transparency]{.mark}, and to
reduce risks, and calls on Russia to do so as well.]{.underline}

Throughout its war of aggression against Ukraine, [**[Russia has
rejected]{.mark}** the path of [diplomacy and dialogue repeatedly
offered]{.mark} to it [by NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} and Allies. It has
[fundamentally violated i]{.underline}nternational [law]{.underline},
including the United Nations Charter. [Russia's actions are also
a]{.underline} flagrant [rejection of the]{.underline} principles
enshrined in the [NATO-Russia Founding Act]{.underline}; it is
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[has **walked away from its
commitments**]{.underline}]{.mark} under the Founding Act. [[Any]{.mark}
[change]{.mark} in the NATO-Russia relationship [depends
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n Federation
[[halting]{.mark} its [aggressive behaviour]{.mark} and fully complying
with international law]{.underline}.

[The last time Russia and the US tried a reset was in 2009]{.underline},
under presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama. But today Russia has
no interest in dusting off its playbook from back then. It has more
patience, less goodwill and an altogether different measure of success.

[In 2009, the Kremlin's wish list was ambitious]{.underline}. Badly hit
by recession, Russia hoped for American investment in the country's
economic modernisation. [Medvedev]{.underline} also [wanted]{.underline}
Washington's [support for Russia's WTO accession]{.underline}, [an
agreement on]{.underline} European [missile defence systems,
and]{.underline} progress on [arms control]{.underline}. 

In return, [[the Kremlin was willing to engage]{.mark} with US
priorities]{.underline}. It supported UN sanctions against Iran in 2010.
It also banned the delivery of the S-300 missile defence system to
Tehran, which at once dumbfounded and delighted White House officials.
While Russia had its own concerns vis-à-vis Iran, it also calculated
that there was merit in building up goodwill with the US. [The
dynamic]{.underline} at play [was one of diffuse
reciprocity]{.underline}, a process [in which Russia was open to giving
and fostering a genuinely more co-operative relationship that would pay
off over time.]{.underline}

Vladimir [[Putin's vision]{.mark} for today]{.underline}'s reset [[is
different]{.underline}]{.mark}. In last week's negotiations,
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n officials [[disguised demands as
concessions]{.underline}]{.mark}. They injected calls for sanctions
relief in return for agreeing to a Black Sea ceasefire --- a truce
Russia does not actually need since it already enjoys access to grain
and fertiliser markets. While **[[Russia has no interest in real
reciprocity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its expectations for US gives may
also be lower than in 2009. [Putin]{.underline} and his acolytes
[understand that Trump is fickle]{.underline} and that deals with his
administration could be fragile. 

That said, [**[Russia has much to gain]{.mark}** from]{.underline}
engaging the US in [an open-ended reset]{.underline}. First[, [it is a
tool]{.mark}]{.underline} for Moscow [[to buy time in
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}. [By dangling the benefits]{.underline}
that the US can expect from making up with Russia, and pandering to
Trump's ego, [[Putin can look]{.mark} like the [reasonable]{.mark}
party]{.underline}. That puts him in an advantageous position to blame
Ukraine for any future lack of progress towards a ceasefire, let alone
comprehensive settlement. Even if it yields no US concessions on
specific dossiers, an endless reset thus brings Russia closer to
defeating Ukraine --- whether through war or diplomacy. As Putin told a
group of Russian sailors in Murmansk last week, he is entirely prepared
for both options.

Second, [[Trump]{.mark}'s]{.underline} enthusiastic [embrace of Putin
will allow Russia to]{.underline} fully [shed its pariah
status]{.underline}. Russia's isolation was always more myth than
reality. But [by]{.underline} suggesting that it be readmitted to the
G7, or [blocking efforts to hold it]{.underline} [accountable
for]{.underline} war crimes in [Ukraine, Washington [will]{.mark}
further [normalise]{.mark} international [engagement with
Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Lastly, a reset with Washington will give Moscow opportunities to
alienate the US from its transatlantic allies, bringing Putin closer to
his long-term goal of fragmenting European security. To be fair, the
apparent hostility vis-à-vis Europe among members of the Trump
administration seems entirely endemic, rather than somehow orchestrated
by Moscow. Still, Russia has rapidly reversed course to benefit from
America's chill towards Europe. Its diplomats have muted their criticism
of the US, instead zeroing in on Europe and Britain. If he plays his
cards well, Putin can use the thaw in US-Russia relations as a vehicle
for widening transatlantic fissures.

There is one risk, which is that Russia is overplaying its hand on
Ukraine. Trump has recently started to notice that Putin is dragging his
feet, threatening secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian oil if no truce
is agreed. The chances of Trump recognising Russia's reset ploy for what
it is, and doing a U-turn, may be very small. But they are not nil.

A potential US détente with Moscow today will not be like that in 2009.
[[Steeled by years of confrontation]{.mark},]{.underline} and convinced
that it enjoys geopolitical tailwinds, **[[Russia will not give
up]{.underline}]{.mark}** just [anything in hope of future
reciprocity]{.underline}. Still, entertaining the US in a drawn-out
reset promises great rewards. At a minimum, [Russia buys time to win
against Ukraine]{.underline} on the battlefield. At best, [[Trump ushers
in **a world order more amenable to Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, while
Putin cheers him on from the sidelines.

## Resilience\-\--Norway

### Norway\-\--IL\-\--2AC

#### Stable Norwegian energy exports [reverse causally solve]{.underline}. 

Sebestyen **Horvath '25**\-\--Author at Oeconomus Economic Research
Foundation. (\"Norway, a Winner in the Russia-Ukraine War\", *The
European Conservative*,
https://europeanconservative.com/articles/analysis/norway-winner-ukraine-war-energy-supply-oil-gas-sanctions/,
3-12-2025). Accessed 7-23-2025 by NT-RM.

[Following]{.underline} the [escalation of the **Russo-Ukrainian**
war]{.underline} in 2022, the [landscape of **European energy supply**
fundamentally changed. While Russia was the continent's **main
supplier** of fossil fuels until three years ago]{.underline}, the
country's energy exports to the EU have now been made impossible by the
sanctions imposed due to the invasion of Ukraine. Although Russia has
been able to successfully circumvent trade sanctions with its so-called
ghost fleet, [it has]{.underline} nevertheless [**fallen significantly
behind** on the list of Europe's energy suppliers]{.underline}. In most
analyses the United States is highlighted as the number one winner of
this reshuffling of the market that occurred over the past three years,
forgetting about **[Norway]{.underline}**, [the **EU's largest supplier
of natural gas**.]{.underline}

Divestment from Russian energy resources

The price cap on Russian crude oil came into effect in December 2022,
and other restrictions on liquid gold were introduced in February 2023
as part of the sixth sanctions package.

[As a result of the **sanctions** policy, **Russia's share** of crude
oil among EU suppliers has **decreased** from an average of 25% before
2022 to 2% by 2024]{.underline}. Typically, Central European countries
still buy Russian crude oil. [A similar trend has occurred with regard
to natural gas, with Russia's EU market share of 30-45% in the 2010s
falling to 15% after the outbreak of full-scale war.]{.underline}

Currently, only Austria, Hungary, Italy and Slovakia buy Russian natural
gas in gaseous form, as no other cheap alternative is available to these
countries. Russian LNG was purchased exclusively by Belgium, Spain and
France. Based on data from June last year, these three EU member states
purchased around 54% of all Russian LNG exports. They are followed by
China and Japan with 22% and 18%, respectively, according to CREA
(Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air).

Norway, the EU's number one energy supplier

[Due to the **restructuring of the energy markets** since the outbreak
of the war in Ukraine]{.underline} 2022, [Norway now supplies **30%** of
Europe's energy needs]{.underline}, thus [contributing greatly to the
**continent's energy security**.]{.underline} According to Eurostat, in
the third quarter of 2024, [Norway was the second largest supplier of
crude oil to]{.underline} the [E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion
[member states, with a share of]{.underline} nearly [14%]{.underline}.
[In the case of LNG, the Nordic country was in fifth place with 7.1%,
which is an increase of more than 70% compared to]{.underline} the same
period in [2023]{.underline}. As [for gaseous and liquefied natural gas
combined, Norway's **market share is 30.3%**, making the]{.underline}
Scandinavian [country the **EU's largest supplier** in three
years.]{.underline}

The birth of an energy giant

According to the Observatory of Economic Complexity database, in 2022, a
year characterized by extremely high energy prices, the share of energy
carriers within Norwegian exports approached 75%, but the product group
had a 60% share in the previous year.

Norway's energy production peaked in 2001 at 3.4 million barrels of oil
equivalent per day. Production volumes fell by an average of 5% annually
until 2011, when production stagnated. Despite the fact that Norwegian
oil and gas production volumes have stagnated since 2019 (figure above),
high inflation, also driven by geopolitical risks, led to exports
quadrupling in the first year of the war and more than doubling in 2023
compared to the last peaceful year before the COVID-19 pandemic (figure
below). [Norway is Europe's **largest oil producer**, accounting for
nearly 60% of continental production in 2021. In 2023, 2 million barrels
of crude oil were produced per day, 85% of which was exported, so Norway
met 2% of the world's crude oil needs]{.underline}. Currently, the
Nordic country is the 12th largest oil producer in the world.

From an energy perspective, Norway is one of the greenest countries in
the world. In 2023, 90% of newly registered vehicles had an electric
drive. Despite the slowdown in the spread of electric cars last year,
their popularity in the Scandinavian country remains unbroken. In
addition, electricity generation comes almost entirely from renewable
energy sources, with hydroelectric power plants accounting for 88% and
wind power plants accounting for a tenth of electricity generation. In
terms of the total energy mix, the share of fossil fuels was 44% in
2023, one of the lowest in the world. In Norway crude oil accounts for a
quarter of the energy mix, while natural gas accounts for 16%. The
latter is primarily used for agricultural fertilization and heating
residential buildings. Due to low domestic consumption, the vast
majority of the crude oil and natural gas produced is sold. The primary
destination for crude oil produced in the offshore economic zone was the
United Kingdom in 2023, followed by the Netherlands and Poland.

[In addition to crude oil, Norway is also one of the **largest natural
gas producers**. Like crude oil, natural gas consumption in Norway is
extremely low, so the vast majority of the production volume
is]{.underline} also **[exported]{.underline}**. [The main destinations
for]{.underline} liquefied natural gas (**[LNG]{.underline}**), which
accounts for only one twentieth of total gas exports, [are the
**Netherlands**, **Belgium** and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom.

[In 2023, nearly **a third of the EU** and UK's combined natural gas
imports came from the Nordic country, making a significant contribution
to European energy security and **replacing**]{.underline} some of [the
**declining Russian energy sources**]{.underline}. Two years ago, Norway
was the world's fourth largest supplier of liquefied and gaseous natural
gas, behind only Russia, Qatar and the United States.

Since the turn of the millennium, oil production has fallen by 41%,
while natural gas production has increased by 124%. However, by
mid-century, oil exports are estimated to fall by a further 15%. Only
40% of the available gas reserves are estimated to have been extracted
so far, ensuring high levels of production for the next ten years.
Investments are flowing steadily into the sector, reaching \$21 billion
last year, a new record, surpassing the peak of 2014. [Last year, Norway
produced **55% of Europe's gas production.**]{.underline}

[The state generates **significant revenues** from fossil fuel exports.
In 2022, energy export revenues were close to **half of the entire state
budget**, thanks to **extremely high energy prices.**]{.underline}

### Norway\-\--IL\-\--1AR

#### Russia's [oil exports]{.underline} to European countries are [increasing]{.underline} due to [dependence]{.underline}, which finance the [war in Ukraine]{.underline}.

West is helping Russia to fund its war on Ukraine\", *BBC*,

[[Russia]{.mark} has continued to [make **billions** from **fossil fuel
exports**]{.mark} to the West, data shows, [helping]{.mark} to
[**finance** its]{.mark} full-scale **[invasion of
Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- now in its fourth year.

[Since]{.underline} the start of that invasion in February [2022,
[Russia]{.mark} has [made]{.mark} more than [**three times** as much
money by **exporting hydrocarbons**]{.mark} [than Ukraine has received
in **aid**]{.mark} allocated by its allies.]{.underline}

Data analysed by the BBC show that Ukraine\'s Western allies have paid
Russia more for its hydrocarbons than they have given Ukraine in aid.

Campaigners say governments in Europe and North America need to do more
to stop Russian oil and gas from fuelling the war with Ukraine.

How much is Russia still making?

[[Proceeds]{.mark} made from selling oil and gas are key to keeping
**Russia\'s war machine going**]{.underline}.

[[Oil and gas account for]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**[a third
of]{.mark} Russia\'s [state revenue]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **more than
[60% of]{.mark} its [exports]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[In the wake of]{.underline} the February 2022 [invasion, Ukraine\'s
allies imposed sanctions on Russian hydrocarbons]{.underline}. The US
and UK banned Russian oil and gas, while the EU banned Russian seaborne
crude imports, but not gas.

[Despite this]{.underline}, by 29 May, [[Russia]{.mark} had
[made]{.mark} more than **[€883bn]{.mark}**]{.underline} (\$973bn;
£740bn) [in revenue from fossil fuel exports since the start of the
full-scale invasion, including **€228bn** from the sanctioning
countries]{.underline}, according to the Centre for Research on Energy
and Clean Air (CREA).

[The [lion\'s share]{.mark} of that amount**, €209bn**, [came from **EU
member states**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[EU states continued importing pipeline gas directly from
Russia]{.underline} until Ukraine cut the transit in January 2025, and
Russian crude oil is still piped to Hungary and Slovakia.

[[Russian gas is still piped to Europe in increasing quantities]{.mark}
via Turkey]{.underline}: [CREA\'s [**data** shows]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [its **[volume rose by 26.77%]{.mark}** in January and February
2025 over the same period in 2024.]{.underline}

#### Russia will leverage energy exports as [blackmail]{.underline} against other European nations, forcing [support for its Ukraine invasion]{.underline} and fostering [internal instability.]{.underline}

Russia's Strategy

[[Russia's strategy]{.mark} to [use **energy blackmail** to influence
Eu]{.mark}ropean [politics]{.mark}, remove **Ukraine** as a critical
transit state for Russian energy exports, [and force Ukraine back
into]{.mark} Russia's **[s]{.mark}**phere **[o]{.mark}**f
**[i]{.mark}**nfluence was a long time in planning]{.underline}. Russia
cut off gas exports to Ukraine in 2006 and 2009 in price and debt
disputes. The [[2009 cutoff **spooked**]{.underline}]{.mark} European
Union (**[EU) [states]{.mark}]{.underline}**, when Bulgaria, an EU
member, was forced to enact rationing. Subsequently, [Russia began work
on]{.underline} several pipelines designed to bring its products to the
West while avoiding Ukraine. These included the [[Nord Stream]{.mark} 1
and 2]{.underline} pipelines in 2012 and 2021, [and South
Stream]{.underline}, which morphed into Turkish Stream when the European
Union blocked its original intended route under the Black Sea to
Bulgaria.\[2\] The Turkish Stream pipeline was completed in 2020.
Central and East European states warned that the [construction of these
[pipelines]{.mark}]{.underline} would [[enable Russia to]{.mark} conquer
Ukraine and [**drive a wedge** between Western and Eastern
Europe]{.mark} by allowing Russia to continue **supplying West European
customers** while dominating East European states]{.underline}.\[3\]

The [[present]{.mark} conflict [demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline}d [that
Central and East European [**warnings** were]{.mark} startlingly
[accurate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the run-up to the war]{.underline},
in the summer of 2021, [Russia **limited gas supplies** to
Europe]{.underline}, claiming technical problems. Russia cut supplies
routed through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline from 170 million cubic meters
per day in May 2021 to 33 million in July, and stopped them entirely in
August.\[4\] In hindsight, [it seems clear that [Russia]{.mark} planned
to [limit European countries']{.mark} ability to store [gas for the
winter]{.mark}, [making them]{.mark} more [**vulnerable** to]{.mark}
**energy [blackmail]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In doing so,
[Russia]{.underline} hoped to [[pose a **stark trade-off**]{.mark} for
Europe: [**support Ukraine** and **freeze** or **tolerate**]{.mark}
**Russia's [invasion]{.mark}** [and **remain
warm**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, this strategy failed, causing one
Russian analyst to speculate that Russia might have had more success had
it not signaled its use of energy blackmail so early, but rather by
surprise attack, "just before the onset of cold weather."\[5\]

[[By **cutting supplies** and **elevating prices**, Russia]{.mark}
sought to [**mobilize mass protests** in European
capitals]{.mark}]{.underline}, similar to the 2018 "yellow vest"
movement in France. In November 2018, up to 280,000 yellow vest
protesters took to the streets when French President Emmanuel Macron
initiated a new carbon tax, demanding cheaper gas and protesting
out-of-touch elites.\[6\] The yellow vests' slogan: "Macron is concerned
with the end of the world; we are concerned with the end of the
month."\[7\] Initiated by rural Frenchmen, the movement gained support
from the urban middle and working classes and energized extremist
parties on the right and left.

[Russia may have calculated that this winter's crisis would be far
**deeper**.]{.underline} Rather than a carbon tax in one country, [all
of Europe faced **sharply higher prices** and **lower supplies of
energy** thanks to Russia's invasion, European **sanctions** that ban
Russian fossil fuel imports, and Russian
**countermeasures**.]{.underline} While opinion polls show that most
Europeans support Ukraine, [Russia]{.underline} had hoped, and probably
still [hopes]{.underline}, [that extremist parties would **capitalize on
discontent** to break Europe's boycott of Russian fossil
fuels]{.underline}, ending a green energy transition that would decimate
Russia's largest market.

[Indeed]{.underline}, already [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} September
[[2022]{.underline}]{.mark}, some [[**70,000 protesters**
gathered]{.mark} in Prague's Wenceslas square [to **protest higher
energy prices**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[8\] Organized by Eurosceptic
parties of the far-right and far-left, protesters called for Czechia to
exit the European Union and NATO and resume importing fossil fuels from
Russia. Some of these parties had long-standing ties to Russia.\[9\]
[Meanwhile, [**Hungarian** Prime Minister]{.mark}]{.underline} Viktor
[Orbán]{.underline}, whom some have described as a "trojan horse" for
Russia within the European Union, [[vetoed additional EU sanctions
against Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [slow-walked the ratification of
Finland's and Sweden's entry into NATO, and advocated against further
restrictions of Russian fossil fuel trade in Europe]{.underline}.\[10\]
Germany's Alternative for Deutschland party increased its support from
10 to 15 percent of voters between June and November 2022, while support
for the governing Social Democratic Party dipped. [**[Germany]{.mark}'s
pro-Russia** Left party joined]{.underline} Alternative for Deutschland
in [[protest]{.mark}s [against]{.mark}]{.underline} arming
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} this fall.\[11\]

While it is impossible to say whether [[Russia had a **direct hand** in
**organizing discontent**]{.mark} in Europe]{.underline}, it has
organized protests in Europe in the past (e.g., the "Lisa case" protests
in Germany during the immigration crisis of 2015--2016).\[12\]
[Sponsoring [protests to **undermine European governments** is part of
Russia's **hybrid war** toolbox]{.mark}, often [used **in conjunction**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} other methods, such as
**[[cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as in the case of Estonia in
2007.\[13\] [Breaking]{.underline} even [one major European government,
or causing it to **fall**, could force the European Union to abandon its
sanctions regime against Russia.]{.underline}

[These operations]{.underline} --- [in Norwegian waters marked by

[energy,]{.underline} the war in [Ukraine has helped add]{.underline}
about [**\$100 billion** to Norway's oil and gas earnings]{.underline}.

Many in Norway have mixed feelings about this reliance on fossil fuels,
and tensions over climate change and further exploring for petroleum
dominated the last national election, in 2021. But [[the]{.mark}
**sudden [importance of energy supplies]{.mark}** appears to have [given
rise to a consensus]{.mark} that [the country should
continue]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least for a few years, [[producing

[[US oil production]{.mark} is [about to
peak]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but the world is unprepared for the
[[tremendous economic and political consequences.]{.mark} The [only
path]{.mark} through [is energy]{.mark} and economic
transformation.]{.underline}

[The [global economy]{.mark} is currently [teetering on]{.mark} the edge
of [a banking crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. The IPCC has just released
its final major report warning that global carbon emissions need to peak
and decline immediately if we are to avoid plunging into dangerous
global warming by breaching the 1.5C 'safe limit'. And in recent weeks
and months, industry leaders have announced [that the US shale [oil and
gas revolution is over.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Yet few if anyone is talking about why these things are happening at the
same time, and what they really mean.

One of our biggest problems is that [we tend to think in silos and
sectors]{.underline}. But [in the real world,]{.underline} the sectors
we assume operate separately [are in fact fundamentally
interconnected]{.underline}. We ignore and downplay these systemic
interconnections at our peril.

The persistence of global inflation has taken many economists by
surprise. While they recognise that the impact of Russia's war in
Ukraine on energy and food supplies has been the biggest driver, that
silo-ed assumption has led to a failure to understand why inflation is
unlikely to simply disappear anytime soon.

[We have good reason to believe that the [underlying drivers of
inflation go beyond]{.mark} just the war in
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although it's extremely difficult to
quantify[, [climate change]{.mark} and environmental degradation
[is ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[driving
inflation](https://kraneshares.com/climate-change-is-a-growing-and-persistent-driver-of-inflation/?ref=ageoftransformation.org)[ by
eroding agricultural productivity]{.underline}]{.mark} [leading to
higher food costs.]{.underline} The impact of [extreme weather events is
also [creating]{.mark} larger and [larger damages to
infrastructure]{.mark} which in turn is incurring greater
costs.]{.underline} As these costs feed into the system, the
[[supply]{.mark} of goods and services [becomes]{.mark} more
[expensive.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Less difficult to quantify is the fact that inflation is historically
linked to energy price hikes. And there is mounting evidence that the
world is experiencing a major shift in the global fossil fuel system
that entails rising costs and diminishing returns, which will end up
having a major inflationary effect for far longer and deeper than
conventionally assumed.

[The end of the shale boom]{.underline}

Since late last year, there have been a [growing number of reports
pointing out that the US [shale revolution is]{.mark} coming to [an
end]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Yet the massive global consequences
of this are not being discussed.

["US Shale Boom Shows Signs of Peaking as Big Oil Well
Disappear"](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-shale-boom-shows-signs-of-peaking-as-big-oil-wells-disappear-2adef03f?ref=ageoftransformation.org) read
one headline in the *Wall Street Journal*. "The aggressive growth era of
US shale is over," Scott Sheffield, CEO of top independent shale firm
Pioneer [told](https://www.ft.com/content/60747b3b-e6ea-47c0-938d-af515816d0f1?ref=ageoftransformation.org) the *Financial
Times*. "The shale model definitely is no longer a swing producer."
And [according
to](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/peak-oil-fears-cast-shadow-224403506.html?ref=ageoftransformation.org) Bloomberg:
"The specter of peak oil that haunted global energy markets during the
first decade of the 21st century is once again rearing its head".

[US industry executives are now openly acknowledging that US oil
production is likely to peak within the next five or six years, or
perhaps in 2030. But there is mounting evidence that
[the ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[peak will come much
earlier]{.mark}](https://bylinetimes.com/2022/11/28/the-great-contraction-how-the-end-of-cheap-money-and-energy-will-degrade-or-renew-civilisation/?ref=ageoftransformation.org)[,]{.underline}
with some industry observers pinpointing its arrival as early as within
the next one or two years.

What's extraordinary about these admissions is how little they are
impacting public debate. [The [implications are
seismic]{.mark}.]{.underline} They contradict bullish overinflated
forecasts of the industry made two decades ago -- in 2005, for instance,
Washington DC think-tank RAND Corp was forecasting that the US had
enough shale oil to [last some 400
years](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2005/RAND_MG414.pdf?ref=ageoftransformation.org);
and in 2012, a senior ExxonMobil
executive [claimed ](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/newsroom/speeches-and-blog-posts/2012/0920_shale-gas-an-american-success-story?ref=ageoftransformation.org)that
the US has "about 100 years of natural gas supply".

These grand claims were often breathlessly reported as unimpeachable
fact by some of the most respected media institutions in the world.

Naysayers (like myself) warning that shale oil and gas would offer at
best a temporary boost that was bound to peak and decline in the
near-term with major global economic consequences, were dismissed as
'doomers'.

Now, it turns out, we were right all along.

Mistakes of forecasting

That's not to say that the [traditional 'peak oilers' at the time were
spot on. They wrongly expected that following the plateauing of
conventional oil around 2005, oil prices would rocket up permanently
into triple digits]{.underline} as global oil production would go into
terminal decline. That didn't happen. Instead, [global demand shifted to
the more expensive forms of unconventional oil and gas -- especially US
shale -- which made-up much of the short-fall as conventional oil
production slowed down.]{.underline}

But this was a recessionary environment, so [global demand was much
lower than expected]{.underline}. The massive 2005-2008 global oil price
spikes helped induce a banking collapse. After the 2008 financial crash,
this meant that there was much less demand for oil -- but as oil
production projects are planned years in advance pegged to expectations
of demand, [the [oil]{.mark} just [kept pumping despite]{.mark} much
[lower demand]{.mark} due to economic recession.]{.underline}

The result was a glut of shale oil and gas on world markets that allowed
oil prices to drop and fuelled widespread belief in a new era of 'Made
in America' cheap oil.

The US shale boom had a good run, no doubt about it -- but its 'healthy'
lifespan appears to be around two decades. [If US shale oil and gas is
about to peak and decline in the next few years, what does this mean for
the US and global economy?]{.underline}

Coming economic contraction

Given that the US shale revolution played the key role in keeping global
oil prices down and lubricating the energy requirements of continued
economic activity, [the retraction of the US shale revolution will have
[massive economic impacts.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[US production has ]{.underline}[accounted
for](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/american-shale-boom-energy-trends-charts/?ref=ageoftransformation.org)[ around
70% of the total increase in global oil capacity since 2019, and 75% of
growth in liquified gas supplies. So]{.underline} as US shale oil and
gas peaks, plateaus and declines, global oil and gas production will do
so too very shortly after.

[Gulf oil and gas producers, however, will not be able to step-in to
fill the shortfall. US oil production is currently averaging around 11
million barrels per day (mbd).]{.underline}

A [2022 analysis of production
data](https://www.mei.edu/publications/opec-and-maximum-production-what-sustainable?ref=ageoftransformation.org) among
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) which include
the biggest powerhouses such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, suggests that
the maximum OPEC could collectively increase production is around 4.5
mbd -- that is, *less than half* of current US shale production.

[[It's]{.mark} also [not clear how long OPEC]{.mark} can [deploy spare
capacity to maintain]{.mark} [max]{.mark}imum levels of
[production]{.mark}.]{.underline} This suggests that OPEC will not be
able to meaningfully fill the supply gap as US shale declines, which is
a clear indicator that total global oil production will eventually begin
to peak and decline.

In 2017, I assessed these trends in [*Failing States, Collapsing
Systems*](https://www.academia.edu/34816514/Failing_States_Collapsing_Systems_BioPhysical_Triggers_of_Political_Violence_SPRINGER_BRIEFS_IN_ENERGY_?ref=ageoftransformation.org).
I predicted that US oil and gas production would probably peak and
plateau around 2025, and that major Middle East producers would peak and
plateau around the 2030s. This scenario now appears to be unfolding
before our eyes. Yet no one is talking about it.

[The [near-term]{.mark} economic and financial consequences will be
devastating, [and]{.mark} they could lead to [permanent]{.mark}
long-term [consequences]{.mark} without significant transformative
action. The impact on the US economy will be profound.]{.underline}

[[Shale]{.mark} production [accounted for ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[10% of
GDP]{.mark}
growth](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/economics/2019/0820?ref=ageoftransformation.org)[ in
the United States]{.underline} from 2010-2015, which means that the next
decade of shale's plateauing and decline will gradually wipe this out.
This will be [experienced as a protracted inflationary economic crisis
which, in turn, will [contribute to volatility in global financial
markets.]{.mark}]{.underline} Pundits will likely fail to understand
these systemic interlinkages, focusing instead on failing banks,
financial institutions and debt, without understanding its energetic
triggers.

All this implies that [we are [sleepwalking into a global energy
crisis]{.mark} that will, [without accelerating]{.mark} the
[clean]{.mark} transformation of the [energy]{.mark} system, create
severe economic and financial consequences by undercutting the
fundamental energetic basis of global economic flows. This will
[compound accumulated vulnerabilities]{.mark} in the banking system
[linked to unsustainable]{.mark} forms of [debt.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The reverberations]{.underline} and bailouts seen in the cases of the
Silicon Valley Bank, Credit Suisse and others [are merely the opening
cracks, that will become widening fissures in the absence of
root-and-branch economic restructuring linked to the rapid development
of a new energy system]{.underline}.

While that new system is still emerging, it is perhaps unavoidable that
we will hit a number of bottlenecks. The danger is that instead of using
these bottlenecks to restructure and adapt positively, we may end up
regressing, with a loss of capital and energy that forestalls the full
potential of transformation.

[The window for action is extremely short: we need to act within this
decade]{.underline}. Along the way, we need to be aware of the major
trends which are likely to emerge as a result of the end of the US shale
boom:

1\. [The illusion of [cheap oil is evaporating]{.mark}]{.underline}

While we may still see fluctuating prices, it is becoming clearer that
the glut of cheap oil this last decade was not a permanent feature of
the energy system, but a temporary symptom of highly specific
circumstances as the energy system moves deeper into a state of
increasing inputs and diminishing returns. The immediate impact of the
peak and plateau of US shale will be sustained high oil prices.

2\. The near-term beneficiaries of this will be Gulf oil and gas
producers

They currently appear to be the only fossil fuel energy suppliers with
sufficient capacity to maintain production. They will therefore not only
begin to dominate market share, they will also of course continue to
reap higher profits from this more advantageous market position amidst
high oil prices.

[3. Some capital will move into OPEC for safety, but this is a
mirage]{.underline}

Just as this last decade created the illusion of fossil fuel abundance
due to the US shale boom, we may see that OPEC's near-term ability to
ramp up spare capacity as shale production declines perpetuates this
illusion. We can expect to see lots of bullish statements from Gulf oil
producers vindicating grand plans to expand their oil and gas
production. Capital will move rapidly into OPEC countries, seen as a
last safe space for investors looking for stability and growth. However,
OPEC producers will also begin experiencing their twilight very shortly
after the decline of US shale, [which means that investors will begin to
make serious losses as a result far sooner than they
imagine.]{.underline}

[4. [Oil prices will fluctuate]{.mark} within a higher range as US shale
peaks]{.underline}

While we can expect significant oil price volatility due to the
recessionary impact of high oil prices which would lower demand and
therefore allow prices to drop, as we move further into the era of
plateau and decline across US and OPEC production[, the overall decline
in supply is likely to lead oil price fluctuations to narrow within a
far higher range which will become a 'new normal' as long as oil demand
remains high.]{.underline} This may also incentivise near-term
conviction in the idea that new oil and gas investments are economical.
That would be a colossal mistake, though, as we will see below due to
coming reductions in oil demand in the latter half of this decade that
will ameliorate high prices and make fossil fuel enterprises
increasingly unprofitable.

5\. We can [expect [heightened political
polarisation]{.mark}]{.underline}

Incumbent industry ideology will likely blind many energy actors from
recognising the writing on the wall -- [which explains the [regressive
self-defeating actions of]{.mark} the Biden administration in committing
to [Arctic drilling.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is like [betting on the
losing
horse](https://ageoftransformation.org/the-next-decade-will-be-the-most-pivotal-in-history/) after
being told it's about to be overtaken by cars. It illustrates the power
of America's oil lobbies in their last ditch desperate attempt to stay
alive on the back of taxpayer subsidies -- flying in the face of hard
economic realities (a few years ago I broke the story of the British
military study
which [concluded](https://www.vice.com/en/article/yp33nm/future-operating-environment-2035?ref=ageoftransformation.org) that
Arctic drilling was pointless for economic reasons because the costs are
so high and returns so low as to make it commercially infeasible). That
in turn suggests [the political [battleground between fossil fuel
lobbies and clean energy advocates]{.mark} will [become]{.mark} more
[fraught a]{.mark}s the incumbency seeks to double-down in demanding
more government subsidies. [Millions of jobs]{.mark} will be [at
risk]{.mark} as the US shale industry declines, and this could create
further negative economic and cultural consequences as the US returns to
net import status.]{.underline}

[6. [Clean energy]{.mark} transformation will be [critical to
stabilise]{.mark} the global [economy]{.mark} and restore
prosperity]{.underline}

[The only viable pathway through this crisis will be to accelerate the
clean energy transformation focused on the [deployment of]{.mark}
exponentially improving [technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} which are
already scaling [because they are cost-[competitive with fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline} -- namely, solar, wind and batteries. This
will lay the groundwork for other potential applications such as e-fuels
or green ammonia from green hydrogen. [This [transformation]{.mark} is
[already underway]{.mark},]{.underline} and provides the opportunity for
the US and others to [produce larger quantities of
energy](https://rethinkdisruption.com/unimaginable-clean-energy-abundance-could-be-ours-ending-the-age-of-resource-scarcity-part-2/?ref=ageoftransformation.org) at
a fraction of the costs of fossil fuels. In *Rethinking Climate Change*,
a [RethinkX
report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/585c3439be65942f022bbf9b/t/6107fd0ed121a02875c1a99f/1627913876225/Rethinking+Implications.pdf?ref=ageoftransformation.org) for
which I was contributing editor, we found that even in the absence of
appropriate policy-decisions and major institutional barriers, [economic
factors will inevitably drive incumbent industries to collapse by 2040
as they are replaced by new solar, wind and battery
systems.]{.underline} [Unfortunately, while this is far faster than
conventional analysts acknowledge, this [is not]{.mark} [fast
enough]{.mark} to avoid dangerous climate change.]{.underline}

7\. Oil demand is going to haemorrhage, because the clean energy
transformation is now unstoppable

The data examined by RethinkX implies that oil demand is likely to peak
far earlier than incumbent energy agencies predict, and decline far more
rapidly following the peak. The RethinkX report suggests that oil demand
will likely peak sometime between 2025 and 2030, followed by an
escalating drop out to 2040. It's critical to recognise that the
economic drivers of this approaching decline in oil demand are not
confined to disruptive energy technologies, but include the disruption
of the transport and food systems by electric vehicles, autonomous
electric vehicles, precision fermentation and cellular agriculture. This
also shines a light on the knife-edge civilisation is moving into this
decade: [as the incumbent energy industry declines, bringing with it the
economy]{.underline}, [there is [a risk that]{.mark} it [derails]{.mark}
the economic factors currently driving the exponential adoption of
[clean energy]{.mark} technologies. Which means that we need to
accelerate adoption this decade.]{.underline}

8\. High volatile oil prices will be followed by crashing oil prices
once demand peaks and declines

In the late 2020s, then, we will likely see [[oil demand begin to
peak]{.mark}. This will be exacerbated by the fact that the global oil
industry is going to [become economically unsustainable by around
2030,]{.mark} when it will begin [consuming a quarter of its own
energy]{.mark} just [to]{.mark} keep [pump]{.mark}ing out [more
oil.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even the *Journal of Petroleum
Technology* published by the Society of Petroleum Engineers is [taking
this prospect
seriously](https://jpt.spe.org/plummeting-energy-return-on-investment-of-oil-and-the-impact-on-global-energy-landscape?ref=ageoftransformation.org).
As oil demand declines, oil prices will also decline. At this point,
assuming the accuracy of the latest EROI studies, the collapse of the
global industry will begin to accelerate because [once prices go below a
certain point and with [EROI levels]{.mark} already
[unsustainable]{.mark}, the industry will simply become impossible to
sustain economically.]{.underline}

#### Oil demand is unsustainable\-\--even if snapshots show high data points now, supply will inevitably outpace demand 

**Pearcey 24** \[Ed; July 12; author at Power Technology; "IEA sees
slowing oil demand for 2024 as China's consumption drops," Power
Technology,
https://www.power-technology.com/news/iea-sees-slowing-oil-demand-for-2024-as-chinas-consumption-drops-2/\]
//AChiong

[The [current slowdown in global demand for oil]{.mark}
looks]{.underline} set to continue as China's "post-pandemic rebound"
[seems to [have run its course, according to the latest]{.mark} data
from the International Energy Agency [(IEA).]{.mark}]{.underline}

The growth in global oil demand will [[slow to]{.mark} around [one
million barrels per day]{.mark}]{.underline} (mbbl/d) this year, and
then into 2025 as China's economic issues such as inflation and weak
confidence become more apparent, said the July 2024 Oil Market Report.

The energy group added that global demand in the second quarter of 2024
rose 710,000 barrels per day (bpd) on the year, one of the lowest
quarterly increases seen in years.

"[[Oil consumption in China]{.mark}, long [the engine of global oil
demand]{.mark} growth, [contracted]{.mark}]{.underline} in both April
and May, and is now assessed marginally below year earlier levels in
2Q24," said the report, a "stark contrast to annual gains of 1.5mmbl/d
\[million barrels per day\] in 2023."

It added that [[demand for]{.mark} industrial [fuels
and]{.mark} ]{.underline}[petrochemical
[feedstocks]{.mark}](https://www.offshore-technology.com/features/strong-oil-and-petrochemical-demand-likely-to-2030-despite-iea-globaldata/)[ was
particularly [weak]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} although "delivery
data of gasoil and naphtha for OECD economies came in higher than
expected, potentially signalling a budding recovery in Europe's ailing
manufacturing sector".

The energy body argued that while the bounce "temporarily pushed
quarterly OECD demand growth back into positive territory, non-OECD
countries will account for all this year's global gains".

For 2024 as a whole, global oil supply growth is forecast to average
770,000bpd, which will boost oil supply to a record 103mbbl/d, it added.

Meanwhile, non-OPEC+ output is expected to rise by 1.5mbbl/d, while
OPEC+ production will fall by 740,000bpd year-on-year, if existing
voluntary cuts are maintained.

OPEC still foresees reasonably strong economic growth around the world
for the rest of this year and into 2025, prompting steady demand for its
oil.

Earlier this week, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries [said global oil
demand](https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/opec-raises-2024s-economic-growth-projection-sees-rising-oil-demand/) would
jump by 2.25mbbl/d in 2024, writing in its monthly report.

Global oil demand would also rise again by 1.85mbbl/d the following
year, with both estimates almost unchanged from figures released last
month, the oil body added.

The IEA's latest report also stated that overall global supply growth in
2025 is projected at a much stronger 1.8mbbl/d, with non-OPEC+, mainly
in the [US,
Canada](https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/us-energy-department-wants-4-miliion-barrels-oil-for-its-spr/), [Guyana](https://www.offshore-technology.com/analyst-comment/oil-growth-guyana-suriname-globaldata-poll/) and [Brazil](https://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/maromba-field-development-brazil/),
leading gains for a third consecutive year.

In mid-June, the [IEA said global [oil demand is expected
to ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[reach its highest point by
2030]{.mark}](https://www.offshore-technology.com/news/global-oil-demand-will-peak-by-2030-iea-says/)[ and
[start to decrease]{.mark} the following year, and [oil supply
capacity]{.mark} will [significantly exceed demand]{.mark} by the end of
this decade.]{.underline}

Economic Impact

[[Following]{.mark} the implementation of [the price cap policy,
Russia's oil revenues have fallen]{.mark} substantially]{.underline}
compared to both pre-war levels and the elevated level at the onset of
the war[. According to the]{.underline} [Russian Ministry of
Finance]{.underline}, federal government oil revenues from
January--March of 2023 were over [[40 percent lower than a year
prior. Before]{.mark} the [war]{.mark}, oil [revenues constituted 30--35
percent]{.mark} of the total Russian budget. [In 2023,]{.mark} oil
revenues have [fallen to just 23]{.mark} percent of the Russian
budget]{.underline}. This decline in revenue has occurred despite
Russia's exporting roughly 5 to 10 percent more crude oil in April 2023
compared to March 2022.

\[chart omitted\]

Despite selling a consistent volume of oil, [Russia makes far less
revenue on each barrel because its [oil now trades at a significant
discount]{.mark} relative to Brent crude]{.underline}, the global
benchmark oil price. Before the war, Russian crude oil traded at a
discount of just a few dollars per barrel relative to Brent. In recent
months, official price reporting agency data has shown that Russian
Urals crude oil has traded at a discount of as much as \$25-\$35 per
barrel less than Brent. [The price cap mechanism [gives importers
leverage to negotiate steep discounts]{.mark} on their trades with
Russia, evidenced in public reporting.]{.underline}

In response to the price cap, [Russia has been [forced to alter the way
it taxes oil]{.mark}]{.underline} such that it institutionalizes the
discounted value of Russian crude---essentially writing into law the
steep discount the price cap has helped cement. This new taxation has
the potential to [threaten Russia's future oil production capacity by
reducing the incentive for companies to invest in equipment,
exploration, and existing fields. This change comes [on top of the
impacts]{.mark} already [being felt by U.S. sanctions and export
controls]{.mark} against Russian energy firms.]{.underline}

Lastly, [[senior Russian economic officials]{.mark} have openly
[acknowledged that]{.mark} the [price cap is hurting their ability to
fund their war]{.mark} and prop up the Russian
economy]{.underline}. [Finance Minister Siluanov
cited](https://www.reuters.com/markets/oil-price-cap-may-widen-russias-2023-budget-deficit-says-finmin-2022-12-27/) the
[price cap as a driver of reduced tax revenues and the expanded 2023
budget deficit.]{.underline} Analysts at Russia's central bank
have [admitted that the price cap and EU
sanctions](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/russia-central-bank-western-oil-price-cap-eu-ban-economy-2022-12#_blank) present
"[new economic shocks" that could "significantly reduce" Russia's

"difficulties" from the EU embargo and price cap had not impeded overall
volumes for crude oil exports and shipments, signaling that [the lower
price Russia is receiving is reducing revenues.]{.underline}

NATO's more prevalent interest in the Arctic is deterrence, primarily
aimed at Russia. As interest in the region has increased,
[[Russia]{.mark} has been more ]{.underline}[[aggressively
asserting]{.mark}](https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/03/29/russia-in-arctic-critical-examination-pub-84181)[ its
[claims]{.mark} in the region and increasing its military activities.
This is most frequently done
[through ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[airspace]{.mark}
violations](https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2023/02/14/air-force-jets-intercept-russian-aircraft-near-alaska/)[, ]{.underline}[[naval
encroachment](https://www.icelandreview.com/politics/russia-gives-no-explanation-of-navy-ships-off-icelands-coast/)[,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and ]{.underline}[intelligence
gathering](https://www.newsinenglish.no/2022/10/05/norway-tracks-russian-spy-ship/).
Although these efforts are understandable to an extent, NATO should not
let them pass. These aggressions are mainly aimed at NATO member states,
which need to develop an effective counter[. This would be [the Arctic
Command's primary goal]{.mark} in the region, to [counter Russian
aggression]{.mark} and [deter]{.mark} them from [further
encroachment]{.mark}, provocations, and other antagonistic actions. Some
may see this approach as escalatory but we must keep in mind that [the
individual Arctic countries]{.mark} are ]{.underline}[[already doing
this](https://www.wsj.com/articles/norwegian-f-16-in-near-miss-with-russian-fighter-jet-1417449268)[ at
a smaller, national level.]{.underline}]{.mark} Enhancing the scope of
these sorts of actions will [[send a message to
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and other actors about [how committed NATO
is to respect for territorial integrity and security in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

Arctic Command Structure

The Arctic Command would [primarily [consist of naval and air
assets]{.mark} stationed in and around the Arctic Circle.]{.underline}
The Command would be headquartered out of two locations, one in Alaska
and another in either eastern Greenland, northern Iceland, or Norway.
Additional bases strewn around the Canadian Arctic, Norway, Alaska, and
Greenland would also fall under the Command's control. [The main tasks
of the Command would be [naval]{.mark} patrolling, [submarine]{.mark}
monitoring, [intelligence gathering, and air
policing]{.mark}]{.underline} along with secondary tasks such as search
and rescue as needed. It would also serve to ensure the interoperability
of NATO forces stationed in the Arctic, acting as the main voice of
Arctic affairs in the Alliance at the tactical level.

The goal of the Command would be to [better coordinate activities,
actions, and responses to developing situations]{.underline} in the
Arctic on both sides of the ocean and to [[streamline the flow]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} Arctic-related [information]{.mark} between allies[.
Arctic-specific training]{.mark},]{.underline} especially at sea, would
also be an important aspect of the Command. Its structure would closely
follow that of NATO's Maritime Command, incorporating elements from the
Allied Air Command as well.

Through the Arctic Command, [NATO would consolidate multinational
security concerns regarding the region and [facilitate a coordinated and
collaborative decision-making process]{.mark} for member states to
resolve them.]{.underline} This cooperation could even extend to
collaborative efforts outside the Alliance, such as joint resolutions on
the Arctic Council and scientific research initiatives. Additionally,
the mere existence of the Command and presence of NATO personnel in the
region would hold significant influence and send a strong message to the
Alliance's adversaries. Although NATO would always seek a diplomatic
solution first, the Alliance needs to be able to credibly enforce a
coherent Arctic policy that respects the international rule of law and
institutional norms. For this, the Arctic Command is a perfect tool.

### AT: Arctic Stays Conventional/MAD checks 

#### The Arctic is the sole unique region for nuclear escalation\-\--it's an indict to deterrence theory 

**Rempe 23** \[Rebecca; May 9; BA Honours Specialization in Political
Science from the University of Western Ontario, orked as an intern with

//AChiong

[Deterrence and Arctic Nuclear Relations]{.underline}

[Classic [nuclear deterrence is steeped in]{.mark} Cold War
[bipolarity]{.mark} and [relies on two rational
actors]{.mark}]{.underline} basing their decisions on what they believe
their opponents\' actions will be \[15\]. Classic deterrence is
expressed through the *Chicken Game* \[16\]. As seen in the figure
below, a player's options are to defect and pursue a foreign policy
objective or to cooperate and maintain the status quo \[17\]. The best
outcome for an actor is to defect against a cooperating partner;
however, this runs the risk of both players defecting, leading to
nuclear annihilation \[18\].

\[chart omitted\]

[This classic deterrence game [does not contend with]{.mark} the
possibility of [conflict between multiple nuclear actors]{.mark}, which
is [a key feature of Arctic security]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}\[19\]. Though a [three-player chicken game]{.underline} has
been applied to theoretical problems, such as two out of three players
needing to complete a task that all would rather not complete, this
model has [yet to be applied to nuclear relations]{.underline} \[20\].
[China, NATO, the U.S., and Russia's [nuclear doctrines are informed by
deterrence theory,]{.mark} which is [problematic due to]{.mark} the
theory's [assumption of a bipolar world order]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[21\]. 

[[Nuclear]{.mark} [multipolarity in the Arctic is
unstable]{.mark}]{.underline} because it no longer falls within the
traditional game theory matrix, and [there is an [increased risk of
nuclear action due to]{.mark} a larger number of nuclear actors and
[significant regional tension]{.mark}]{.underline} \[22\]. [[Preemptive
nuclear strikes are more prevalent]{.mark} in multipolar nuclear
politics [due to a greater perception of threat]{.mark} from other
actors]{.underline} \[23\]. Though China promotes itself as a No First
Use (NFU) state, meaning that it will not strike unless struck upon in a
nuclear capacity, Russia has threatened to strike first, and America's
position on NFU is vague \[24\]. NATO is a nuclear deterrent
organisation in the Arctic region, only Sweden is not yet a full NATO
member and Finland has just recently gained NATO membership \[25\]. [In
multipolar deterrence, regional conflicts are more likely to [escalate
into total nuclear warfare]{.mark}, and de-escalation relies on
political bargaining as opposed to rationality modelling.]{.underline}
Thus, it is unclear how political bargaining will take place in an
increasingly polarised Arctic \[26\].

Though the U.S., China, and Russia have all acceded to or ratified the
Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NNPT), both Russia
and the U.S. have backed out of data-sharing obligations under the New
START treaty \[27\]. [This [breakdown in communication between Arctic
actors due to]{.mark} Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Russia's [recent
threat to use nuc]{.mark}lear weapons [against the U.S.
indicates]{.mark} that future regional [disputes over Arctic]{.mark}
resources, navigation, and territory may [give rise to nuclear
crises]{.mark}]{.underline} \[28\].

### AT: Renewables Fail/bad\-\--Short 

#### Renewables are environmentally effective, economically beneficial, and coming now -- but only the aff prevents Chinese dominance 

**UN 23** \[United Nations; global intergovernmental organization;
"Renewable energy -- powering a safer future," UN,
https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/raising-ambition/renewable-energy\]
//AChiong

[[Energy](https://www.ipcc.ch/2020/07/31/energy-climatechallenge/)[ is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[at [the heart of]{.mark} the [climate challenge]{.mark} -- and [key to
the solution.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A large chunk of [the [g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}ases that
blanket the Earth and [trap the sun's heat]{.mark} are [generated
through energy production]{.mark}, by [burning fossil
fuels]{.mark}]{.underline} to generate electricity and heat.

Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, are by far [the largest
contributor to global climate
change](https://productiongap.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Production-Gap-Report-2019.pdf),
[[accounting for]{.mark} over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas
emissions and [nearly 90 percent of]{.mark} all [carbon dioxide]{.mark}
emissions.]{.underline}

The science is clear: to avoid the worst impacts of climate change,
[[emissions need to be reduced]{.mark} by almost half by 2030 and reach
net-zero by 2050.]{.underline}

To achieve this, [we [need to end]{.mark} our [reliance on fossil
fuels]{.mark} and [invest in]{.mark} alternative sources of [energy
that]{.mark} are [clean,]{.mark} accessible, affordable, sustainable,
and reliable.]{.underline}

[Renewable energy sources]{.underline} -- which are available in
abundance all around us, provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and
heat from the Earth [-- are [replenished by nature]{.mark} and emit
little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.]{.underline}

Fossil fuels still account for more than 80 percent of [global energy
production](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2022/key-findings),
but cleaner sources of energy are gaining ground. About [29 percent of
electricity](https://www.iea.org/reports/global-energy-review-2021/renewables) currently
comes from renewable sources.

Here are five reasons why accelerating the transition to clean energy is
the pathway to a healthy, livable planet today and for generations to
come.

1\. [Renewable energy sources are [all around us]{.mark}]{.underline}

About [80
percent](https://www.irena.org/-/media/files/irena/agency/publication/2019/jan/global_commission_geopolitics_new_world_2019.pdf)[ of
the global population]{.underline} lives in countries that are
net-importers of fossil fuels \-- that's [about [6 billion
people]{.mark} who [are dependent on fossil fuels]{.mark} from other
countries]{.underline}, which [[makes them vulnerable to geopolitical
shocks and crises.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In contrast, renewable energy sources are available in all countries,
and their potential is yet to be fully harnessed. The International
Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that [90 percent of the
world's
electricity](https://www.irena.org/newsroom/pressreleases/2021/mar/fast-track-energy-transitions--to-win-the-race-to-zero) can
and should come from renewable energy by 2050.

[[Renewables offer]{.mark} a [way out of import dependency]{.mark},
allowing countries [to diversify]{.mark} their [economies]{.mark} and
[protect them from]{.mark} the unpredictable [price swings of fossil
fuels]{.mark}, while [driving]{.mark} inclusive economic
[growth,]{.mark} new [jobs,]{.mark} and [poverty
alleviation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[2. [Renewable energy is cheaper]{.mark}]{.underline}

Renewable energy actually is the [cheapest power
option ](https://www.irena.org/-/media/files/irena/agency/publication/2022/mar/irena_weto_summary_2022.pdf?la=en&hash=1da99d3c3334c84668f5caae029bd9a076c10079)in
most parts of the world today. Prices for renewable energy technologies
are dropping rapidly. The cost of electricity from solar power fell by
85 percent between 2010 and 2020. Costs of onshore and offshore wind
energy fell by 56 percent and 48 percent respectively.

[[Falling prices]{.mark} make renewable energy more attractive all
around -- including to low- and middle-income countries,]{.underline}
where most of the additional demand for new electricity will come from.
With falling costs, there is a real opportunity for much of the new
power supply over the coming years to be provided by low-carbon sources.

Cheap electricity from renewable sources could provide [65
percent](https://www.irena.org/Digital-Report/World-Energy-Transitions-Outlook-2022) of
the world's total electricity supply by 2030. [It [could decarbonize 90
percent of the power sector]{.mark} by 2050, massively cutting carbon
emissions and helping to [mitigate climate change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Although solar and wind power costs are expected to remain higher in
2022 and 2023 then pre-pandemic levels due to general elevated commodity
and freight prices, [their competitiveness actually
improves ](https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-may-2022)due
to much sharper increases in gas and coal prices, says the International
Energy Agency (IEA).

 

3\. [Renewable energy is [healthier]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to the World Health Organization [([WHO]{.mark}),
about ]{.underline}[[99 percent of]{.mark}
people](https://www.who.int/news/item/04-04-2022-billions-of-people-still-breathe-unhealthy-air-new-who-data)[ in
[the world breathe air]{.mark} that [exceeds air quality limits]{.mark}
and [threatens their health]{.mark}, and more than [13 million
deaths]{.mark} around the world [each year]{.mark} are [due to]{.mark}
avoidable environmental causes, including air
[pollution.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide
originate mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. [[In 2018,]{.mark}
air pollution from fossil fuels [caused \$2.9 trillion
in ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[health and economic
costs](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/cop24-special-report-health-climate-change)[,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[about \$[8 billion a day.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Switching to clean sources of energy, such as wind and solar, thus helps
address not only climate change but also air pollution and health.

 

4\. Renewable energy creates jobs

[Every dollar of investment in renewables ]{.underline}[[creates three
times](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/speeches/2021-09-24/opening-remarks-high-level-dialogue-energy)[ more
jobs than in the fossil fuel
industry]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} The IEA estimates that the
[transition towards net-zero emissions will lead to
an ]{.underline}[overall increase in energy sector
jobs](https://www.iea.org/commentaries/the-importance-of-focusing-on-jobs-and-fairness-in-clean-energy-transitions)[:]{.underline}
while about 5 million jobs in fossil fuel production could be lost by
2030, [an estimated 14 million new jobs would be created in clean
energy, resulting in [a net gain of 9 million jobs.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In addition, [energy-related industries would require]{.underline} a
further 16 million workers, for instance to [take on new roles in
manufacturing of electric vehicles and hyper-efficient appliances or in
innovative technologies such as hydrogen.]{.underline} This means that a
total of [[more than 30 million jobs]{.mark} could be created [in clean
energy, efficiency]{.mark}, and low-emissions technologies by
2030.]{.underline}

Ensuring [a just
transition](https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_emp/---emp_ent/documents/publication/wcms_432859.pdf),
placing the needs and rights of people at the heart of the energy
transition, will be paramount to make sure no one is left behind.

 

5\. [Renewable energy [makes economic sense]{.mark}]{.underline}

[About ]{.underline}[[\$7
trillion]{.mark}](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/08/24/fossil-fuel-subsidies-surged-to-record-7-trillion)[ was
[spent on subsidizing]{.mark} the [fossil fuel]{.mark}
industry]{.underline} in 2022, including through explicit subsidies, tax
breaks, and health and environmental damages that were not priced into
the cost of fossil fuels.

In comparison[, about ]{.underline}[[\$4.5
trillion](https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/6d4dda5b-be1b-4011-9dad-49c56cdf69d1/NetZeroRoadmap_AGlobalPathwaytoKeepthe1.5CGoalinReach-2023Update.pdf)[ a
year]{.underline}]{.mark} [needs to be [invested in renewable]{.mark}
energy]{.underline} until 2030 -- including investments in technology
and infrastructure -- to allow us to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

The upfront cost can be daunting for many countries with limited
resources, and many will need financial and technical support to make
the transition. [But investments in renewable energy will pay off. The
reduction of pollution and climate impacts alone could [save the world
up to ]{.mark}]{.underline}[[\$4.2
trillion](https://www.irena.org/-/media/files/irena/agency/publication/2016/irena_remap_externality_brief_2016.pdf)[ per
year by 2030.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Moreover, [efficient, reliable renewable technologies can create a
system less prone to market shocks and improve resilience and energy
security by diversifying power supply options.]{.underline}

[The [industry's disinformation campaign]{.mark} dovetailed with the
decades-long effort [by]{.mark} [corporate
Americ]{.mark}]{.underline}[a]{.mark}---business leaders, their trade
organizations, and thinktanks---to promote an anti-governance,
anti-regulation agenda that asserted that climate change (and other
matters) should be left to the market to sort out, and that government
was not---and could not be---the solution \[[427](javascript:;)\]. The
reality, as economist Nicolas Stern has aptly noted, is that climate
change is a market failure where "[those who damage others by emitting
greenhouse gases generally do not pay]{.underline}," which requires
government action to address \[[428](javascript:;)\]. Yet by the
mid-1990s, in large part [[due to]{.mark} the [duplicity and
disinformation]{.mark} of the fossil fuel industry and allies, many
[American citizens and]{.mark} political [leaders]{.mark} had been
[persuaded "to trust the market"]{.mark} and eschew regulation on
climate change.]{.underline}

In the mid-2000s as the consensus on climate change strengthened, [the
[fossil fuel industry]{.mark} [shifted]{.mark} its public affairs
strategy from outright public denial of climate change [to]{.mark} more
[subtle,]{.mark} insidious forms of [propaganda]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[414](javascript:;), [419](javascript:;), [429](javascript:;)\]. Among
their key tactics, fossil fuel companies routinely [[cast climate change
as a ''risk'']{.mark} rather than a reality]{.underline}, even after the
scientific community had stated that climate change was "unequivocal"
\[[414](javascript:;)\]. [They [use]{.mark} "[greenwashing"]{.mark} in
advertising to portray companies as environmentally conscious
\[]{.underline}[430](javascript:;)[\] and committed to low-carbon
technologies [when]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in fact, from 2008 to
2022 oil and gas [companies [never spent more than 1% of]{.mark} their
collective annual [budgets on low-carbon projects]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[431](javascript:;)\]. [Many companies have made empty pledges to
reach net-zero emissions that their business models cannot
achieve]{.underline} \[[432](javascript:;)\]. They deploy rhetoric on
"individualized responsibility," in which they [[shift blame]{.mark} for
climate change from producers [to consumers]{.mark}]{.underline} and
their role [[in sustaining "demand," even though]{.mark} much of this
demand [could be answered by renewable]{.mark} energy.]{.underline} They
promote "fossil fuel solutionism," [[presenting]{.mark} their [industry
as]{.mark} an essential and [inevitable]{.mark} part of the solution to
the climate crisis, in contradiction to the scientific evidence that
continued fossil fuel production and use will worsen the climate
crisis.]{.underline} And they use "[[technological shell
games]{.underline}]{.mark}" in which they downplay the climate harms
from fossil fuels, for example by falsely marketing methane as "clean,"
and [[promote ineffective, expensive]{.mark} fossil fuel [technologies
such as CCS]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[433](javascript:;)\]. As the cost of
solar and wind energy continues to drop, [the fossil fuel industry is
[falsely casting]{.mark} clean, [renewable]{.mark} alternatives to
fossil fuels [as unreliable and inviable]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[[434](javascript:;)\]. Alongside these propaganda tactics, [climate
disinformation remains rife]{.underline} on social media, much of it
apparently [emanating [from sources connected to]{.mark} the [fossil
fuel industry]{.mark}]{.underline} \[[435](javascript:;)\].

[These tactics continue to be [pervasive and highly influential]{.mark}.
The IPCC in 2022 concluded that misinformation and politicization of
climate-change science]{.underline} in the USA by vested interests "[has
sowed uncertainty and impeded recognition of risk]{.underline}" and
"limited climate action" \[[436](javascript:;)\]. Polls consistently
show that many Americans---and significant portions of populations in
other countries as well---continue to doubt the reality or significance
of climate change \[[437--439](javascript:;)\]. As of 2024, 29% of
Americans ascribed the observed warming to "natural changes in the
environment," rather than to human activities, while 22% of Americans
still think there is "a lot of disagreement" among scientists as to
whether global warming is happening \[[440](javascript:;)\]. And the

Introduction

Climate change has caused the polar ice caps to melt, increasing
international interest in the Arctic. In 2018, [[China claimed to
be]{.mark} a "[near-Arctic state]{.mark}," showing [continued interest
in the mineral reserves and shipping routes]{.mark} that climate change
has opened up]{.underline}. With a near-monopoly on rare-earth elements
(REEs), and a history of using natural resources as political leverage,
[China's interest in the Arctic has [implications for Canadian Arctic
sovereignty]{.mark}.]{.underline} This policy brief argues that [China's
interest in the Arctic [poses a]{.mark} real [threat to]{.mark} Canada
due to both China's behaviour and [Canada's
vulnerability]{.mark}.]{.underline} Specifically, this brief focuses on
[the implications of China's REE dominance and its increased interest in
the Arctic for Canadian Arctic security]{.underline}. After providing a
brief overview of China's interest in the Arctic, I will detail the
nature of this threat, [[focusing on]{.mark} China's recent Arctic
advancements and [Canada's green energy goals]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Next, I will discuss [Canada's unique vulnerability to an Arctic threat
from China.]{.underline} Finally, I will conclude with policy
recommendations for the Department of National Defence.

Why is China Interested in the Arctic?

There are three main reasons why China might want to secure greater
access to the Arctic. The first is natural resources. [The [Arctic is
home to]{.mark} many [untapped]{.mark} natural resources, including
[oil, hydrocarbons and critical minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S
Energy Information Administration estimates that [about [22% of the
world's undiscovered oil resources]{.mark}, as well as immense
[reserves]{.mark} of gold, diamond, iron ore, base metals and
[r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lements, are found in the
Arctic]{.underline} (Oddleifson, Alton & Romaniuk 2021). While the
majority of the Arctic's natural resources are located in Russia's
Arctic territory, [Canada has significant reserves of oil, gas, and most
notably rare earth elements.]{.underline} Rare earth elements are
[[necessary for]{.mark} the [transition]{.mark} [to green energy]{.mark}
sources, with important usage in electric vehicle batteries, permanent
magnets and wind turbines (]{.underline}Government of Canada 2024).
These green minerals also have [important [military uses]{.mark}, not
limited to radar systems, jet engines and nuclear
submarines.]{.underline} China currently has a near monopoly over
producing and refining rare earth elements, which remains important for
Canada's Greening Government goals.

The second motivation for China's interest in the Arctic is improved
shipping routes. As polar ice melts, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and
the Northwest Passage (NWP) garner attention as more productive
alternatives to traditional shipping routes. For instance, it is
estimated that a ship travelling from Western Canada to continental
Europe through the NWP would reduce travel by around 1000 nautical miles
and save an estimated \$80,000 USD in fuel costs when compared with the
Panama Canal route (Oddleifson, Alton & Romaniuk 2021). Canada deems the
NWP "internal waters," which prohibits such free passage. However[,
[Chinese officials]{.mark} have repeatedly [emphasized the Arctic
as]{.mark} the "[common heritage of mankind]{.mark}," indicating [an
interest in]{.mark} the [internationalization]{.mark} of Arctic shipping
routes [and a disregard for Canadian sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Fadeev et al. 2024, 25).

Finally, [the [Arctic provides]{.mark} China with a [useful vantage
point to the West]{.mark}. The current geopolitical environment has seen
greater East-West polarization]{.underline}, especially following
Russia's 2022 ongoing invasion of Ukraine, wherein [China has [de facto
sided with Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline} With NATO gaining new members
Finland (2023) and Sweden (2024) and continuing to move eastward, a
greater foothold in the Arctic could reassure some of China's security
worries and [provide [a]{.mark} better [opportunity for]{.mark}
gathering [intelligence on the U.S and Canada.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Why is the [Threat of China Imminent]{.mark}?]{.underline}

[For more than 20 years, China has increased activity in the
Arctic.]{.underline} Between 1999 and 2017, China made nine arctic
expeditions (Biedermann 2020, 586). In 2013, China became an observer of
the Arctic Council. Indeed, [China has [made]{.mark} numerous
[investments in the Arctic]{.mark} nations, totaling [approximately
\$1.4 trillion USD]{.mark} between 2005 and 2017]{.underline}
(Oddleifson, Alton & Romaniuk 2021). In 2017, [China [launched its
"Polar Silk Road]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} program as a part of its
Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at improving shipping routes and opening
up access to natural resources. Since then, Chinese officials have been
[[cooperating]{.mark} closely [with Russia on mining]{.mark} projects in
the Arctic]{.underline} (Biedermann 2020). The bottom line is that China
wants to [become a major player in the Arctic.]{.underline}

What does increased Chinese investment in the Arctic mean [for
Canada?]{.underline} Chinese officials have maintained that they are
committed to adhering to international law in the region and seek Arctic
access for peaceful "scientific exploration". However, [the link between
scientific and military innovation should not be understated. Indeed,
[China]{.mark} has [previously used "scientific cooperation" as a cover
for projects that serve a dual-use]{.mark}]{.underline} (Puranen & Kopra
2023, 246). Further, China has [successfully [developed]{.mark} [and
tested underwater gliders and listening devices in the Arctic]{.mark},
with [stated peaceful purposes]{.mark}]{.underline} to chart the sea
floor and monitor water salinity and ice levels. However, these devices
[can [also track allied submarines]{.mark}, which positions them as
[a]{.mark} good [surveillance tool]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially
given that Canada lacks such technology to surveil its own regions.
Additionally, China is continually developing deep-diving submersibles,
which could be used for espionage via underwater cables, which Canada
would have a tough time detecting due to its lack of deep-diving
capabilities (Huebert 2023).

As China ramps up its activity in the Arctic[, it is also [gaining
leverage over countries]{.mark} that aim [to transition to green
energy]{.mark} sources. [China controls]{.mark} most of the world's rare
earth elements, that are essential to the "green transition" away from
carbon]{.underline}. In 2022, China accounted for [[70% of global
mining]{.mark} production and [87% of]{.mark} global
[refining]{.mark}]{.underline} (Government of Canada 2024). They have
[[long held]{.mark} a [competitive advantage]{.mark} in amassing REEs
due to their financial prowess, which allows them to [mine and refine
the costly elements]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as their poor
corporate social responsibility (CSR), resulting in their continued
extraction of the elements despite the environmental costs. [They have
even set up [mining contracts with Russia in the Arcti]{.mark}c,
increasing their near-monopoly.]{.underline} The bottom line is [that
countries trying to transition to a green economy will likely have to
answer to China. [Canada is one of these countries]{.mark}]{.underline},
with Canada's Greening Government Strategy hinged on the achievement of
"net-carbon zero by 2050" (Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat 2017).
Given that the average electric vehicle requires six times the mineral
inputs of a conventional car, Canada will need REEs to complete a green
transition (IEA 2021). [While Canada has domestic REE reserves, they are
commercially off limits due to proximity to Indigenous land,
environmental degradation and the difficulty of extraction.]{.underline}
Thus, if Canada cannot diversify its supply chains fast, it might be
[[left to rely on China for REEs.]{.underline}]{.mark}

If Canada must turn to China for REEs, it could create trouble in the
Arctic. [China could [weaponize]{.mark} the trade of [REEs to pursue
their Arctic interests]{.mark}.]{.underline} Global REE demand is
projected to double over the next fifteen years, and there are currently
limited viable alternatives (IEA 2024). China could demand greater
access to the Canadian Arctic in return for REEs. With Canada's current
Arctic capabilities, granting greater access to China would create more
security risks and further soften Canadian sovereignty over the NWP.
Currently, Canadian Arctic resources are protected as a part of Canada's
exclusive economic zone (EEZ). However, if the NWP was accepted as
international waters, increased transit could enhance Canada's
vulnerability to having its EEZ violated. This is especially relevant
given the contestation of the NWP as Canadian "internal waters." Many
nations, including the United States, have previously opined that it
should be considered an international strait. A revival of such
contestation is certainly not off limits, amid declining Canada-U.S
relations and Donald Trump's recent undercuts to Canadian sovereignty[.
Since [Canada's sovereignty]{.mark} is already contested, it could be
[easily challenged by China]{.mark} soon, worsening the risk of China's
REE monopoly and relative power increasing.]{.underline}

Canada's Vulnerabilities

What makes Canada vulnerable in the Arctic? [The first [vulnerability
lies in declining Sino-Canadian relations. ]{.mark}]{.underline}Despite
a previously strong relationship, Sino-Canadian relations have declined
since the Huawei dispute. In 2018, Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, was
detained and arrested in Vancouver on fraud charges (Chen 2023, 37).
Beijing retaliated by arresting two Canadian nationals, who were only
released upon Wanzhou's release. The entire dispute resulted in Canada
banning Huawei and other Chinese companies from Canada's 5G networks. In
2021, Canada placed sanctions on various Chinese businesses and
individuals for the human rights violations perpetuated against the
Uyghur minority in Xinjiang (Global Affairs Canada 2021). [Since 2022,
Canada and China have found themselves on opposite ends of the
Russia-Ukraine conflict]{.underline}, with China being one of the few
countries refusing to impose sanctions on Russia. Further, in 2023,
China flew a high-altitude balloon across North America, which was shot
down by the US Air Force and rumoured to be an act of espionage (Huebert
2023). [Deteriorating relations between the two states exacerbate
worries that China could weaponize trade or pursue its interests more
aggressively in the Arctic.]{.underline}

With declining Sino-Canadian relations, [there is an increased risk of
Chinese revisionism in the Arctic due to their aggressive
precedent.]{.underline} Despite Beijing's official claims that they
adhere to international law when conducting their Arctic activities,
they have frequently flouted international law in the South China Sea,
largely in pursuit of natural resources. For instance, in 2016, China
ignored the Hague Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling in favour of the
Philippines and continued to pursue its aggressive territorial claims
(Center for Preventive Action 2024). China has also built islands and
maintained the ambiguity of their 'nine-dash line' to assert control
over most of the South China Sea. [If China is willing to aggressively
pursue its economic interests in the South China Sea, there is a
possibility that it will do the same in the Arctic.]{.underline}

Further, [[China has a history of natural resource
weaponization]{.mark}, especially during disputes with other nations[.
In 2010, following]{.mark} a [fishing dispute]{.mark} between a Chinese
trawler and the Japanese coast guard, [China suspended all shipments of
r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lements]{.underline} to Japan for
two months (Kullik 2019, 4). The incident completely disrupted the
Japanese automotive markets, increasing prices globally and sparking a
frenzy to diversify supply chains, which proved unsuccessful. Japan is a
reminder that China could leverage its REE dominance again to achieve
its political goals[. If China attempts to use REEs to gain access to
the Canadian Arctic in the near future, [Canada lacks
diversified]{.mark} enough [supply chains to]{.mark} confidently [reject
China]{.mark} as an REE supplier,]{.underline} and the Canadian Greening
Government goals echo this fact. This threat might seem far away for
many Canadians; however, it is not one to discount, especially with the
recent developments in the U.S. Most recently, in retaliation to the U.S
export restrictions on artificial intelligence technology, China
announced that it will ban several critical minerals exports to the U.S,
including those important to military and electric vehicle technology.
Evidently, Beijing is willing to withhold important goods to achieve its
national goals. Canada should be actively working to prevent Canadian
dependence on China, especially as the Arctic opens up.

[Seven Arctic states are **NATO allies**]{.underline} (Canada, Finland,
Denmark--- by virtue of Greenland--- Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the
US--- by virtue of Alaska), and Arctic nations make up five of the
sixteen founding NATO members.

Despite [the]{.underline} current [U.S. administration's]{.underline}
**[skepticism]{.underline}** [of the Alliance, [it is]{.mark} in
[America's **best interest**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to
**reinforce**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **strengthen**]{.underline}
[this]{.underline} strategic [[alignment]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[The [Alliance]{.mark} is [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[bulwark]{.underline}** [against nations]{.underline}]{.mark}
[that]{.underline} [seek to advance]{.underline}
[ideologies]{.underline} [[**antithetical** to
democratic]{.underline}]{.mark} values and
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, [to use tools of **national power**
to dismiss sovereign borders]{.underline}, to

[countries]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} to [disrupt]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[the]{.underline} **[international]{.underline}**
]{.mark}[**rules-based [order]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[The United States]{.underline} [should]{.underline}
[strengthen]{.underline} **[the transatlantic alliance]{.underline}**
[by reaffirming]{.underline} an unwavering **[commitment]{.underline}**
to it. Collectively, the seven Arctic NATO member nations, alongside
other members of the Alliance, form a potent security, economic, and
research partnership that benefits us all.

Look at a map of the Arctic. Find Alaska, my home state, and run your
finger from there through Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden,
and Finland. You've just identified what I call the transarctic
alliance.

In the aftermath of the Second World War these [[nations]{.underline}
[formed]{.underline}]{.mark} [an [arc of
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} [[based on]{.mark} shared **[democratic
values]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a commitment to the rule of law, the
[recognition of sovereign borders]{.underline}, and with Finland and
Sweden recently joining NATO, the collective defense of all Arctic
allies.

From the Bering Sea to the Beaufort Sea, from the Barents Sea to the
Baltic Sea, [Arctic allies]{.underline} are [navigating]{.underline} a
[new **geopolitical landscape** and a host of]{.underline} evolving and
[escalating **military**]{.underline} and security
[threats]{.underline}.

[[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark} are [increasingly
[concerned]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[persistent [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[posed
by]{.underline}]{.mark} an emboldened [[Russia and
China]{.mark}'s]{.underline} expanding [interests]{.underline} and
activities throughout the region. As the 2024 U.S. Defense Department's
Arctic Strategy identified, the ways in which Russia and China are
cooperating "across multiple instruments of national power" is of
increasing concern.

While serving as U.S. Ambassador, our Arctic allies reaffirmed to me a
commitment to further invest in their security that will also enhance
our collective defense. They [underscored]{.underline} the [importance
of **U.S. security capabilities**]{.underline} and assurances and
[[called for]{.mark} sustained [U.S. **diplomatic
leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region.

[[The U.S. should **reaffirm**]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} [to]{.underline} our [Arctic allies
[and provide]{.mark} **reliable [leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
predictable support; the U.S. must remain the unequivocal ally -- in the
Arctic and around the world.

[Our Arctic allies actively defend U.S. interests in the]{.underline}
[region]{.underline} and around the globe. Iceland, Greenland and the
Faroe Islands as part of the Kingdom of Denmark, Norway, and fellow NATO
members monitor [and defend the]{.underline} strategic **[GIUK
Gap]{.underline}** (the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom Gap).

[This]{.underline} region [contains]{.underline} strategic [**military**
and **civilian** shipping]{.underline} [lanes]{.underline} from the
North Atlantic to the Barents Sea. In the Arctic, Russia's Northern
Fleet gains access from the Barents Sea to the North Atlantic, the
Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the globe beyond.

[With Finland and Sweden]{.underline} [these [partners
monitor]{.mark}]{.underline} and confront [threats]{.underline} [from
adversaries]{.underline} and competitors in the inherently linked Baltic
Sea region that [includes]{.underline} **[overt]{.underline}** military
[activity as well as **[grey zone tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[cyber-attacks]{.underline}, [electronic warfare, shadow
fleets]{.underline} evading sanctions and posing environmental risks,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[targeting of critical]{.mark}
**undersea [infra]{.mark}structure**.]{.underline}

[To counter threats]{.underline} by adversaries and competitors, [the
United States]{.underline} [should]{.underline} reevaluate and
[prioritize]{.underline} its [foreign and **defense policies** in the
Arctic]{.underline}, starting with respectful engagements of longtime
allies Canada and the Kingdom of Denmark.

more follow online in nine languages, from English to Japanese.

On any other night, NORAD is scanning the heavens for potential threats,
such as last year's Chinese spy balloon. But on Christmas Eve,
volunteers in Colorado Springs are fielding questions like, "When is
Santa coming to my house?" and, "Am I on the naughty or nice list?"

"[There are screams and **giggles and laughter**]{.underline}," said Bob

I'm staunchly in the pro-make-believe-camp, mainly because for me,
[Santa]{.underline} [represents]{.underline} [the possibility of
**magic**]{.underline} [and **miracles** in the world,]{.underline} and
frankly, [I want my kids to]{.underline} [throw]{.underline} their [lot
in with **the incredible**]{.underline}: Reindeer can fly, one guy can
be everywhere in the world at once, and somehow he knows exactly what
our secret dreams are for what will be under the tree.

[Kids]{.underline} will [spend the]{.underline} vast [majority of their
lives with the world]{.underline} aggressively **[marking the
line]{.underline}** for them [between what's "**true**" and what's
**fantasy**]{.underline}. They will endlessly be told to "get a grip"
and (horrors) to "get real." [They will become **jaded** and
**cynical**]{.underline} soon enough, so why hurry them along? How does
that help, or more importantly change, anything?

[What **humanity needs** is more people who've]{.underline} [practiced
being certain that just because you can't believe it -- **doesn't mean
it's not true**]{.underline}.

Magic is effortless for the young: Animals can talk, toys come alive at
night, crossing your fingers protects you from cooties and a guy like
Santa is possible. We all start out this way, believing impossible
things are possible. Time and age cause us to stumble down the hill and
further away from our naturally-born faith; it gets educated,
disciplined and disappointed out of us. The burdens of death, failure
and all manner of heartbreak cause us to lose track of magic's
possibility; our so-called superior and hyper intellects crowd it out.

Except as adults, [breathing life]{.underline} [into]{.underline} the
[possibility of **magic is everything**]{.underline}: [The]{.underline}
[person who discovers]{.underline} a [**cure for cancer**, **global
warming** or **world economic disparity**]{.underline}; [the person who
**innovates**]{.underline}, who launches a never-seen-before product or
business; the person who figures out how to dive more than 7 miles below
the ocean to see what's there -- these [will]{.underline} [be
people]{.underline} [who]{.underline} fundamentally [believe that
**"impossible" isn't a thing**]{.underline}. The ability, as Jaqueline
Wooley says, [to "engage the border]{.underline} [between]{.underline}
[what is **possible**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} what is
**[impossible]{.underline}**," [is at the root of **all scientific
discoveries**]{.underline} and inventions, "from airplanes to the
Internet."

A beautiful and hopeful [**future** is in the hands]{.underline} [of
those]{.underline} [able]{.underline} [to]{.underline} actively [hold
space for **miracles**]{.underline}, and [if once believing]{.underline}
[**reindeer could fly** gives them something to draw on]{.underline},
then **[I'm all in]{.underline}**. I'm thinking now of a line from a
Roald Dahl book: Those who don't believe in magic, will never find it.

In the future, [NATO should **broaden its approach** to the
north]{.underline}. [With the alliance's center of gravity shifting
northward following the accession of Finland and Sweden, NATO should
**enhance its ability** to **deter** and **defend** its northern
flank]{.underline}.

[Unprecedented **climate change**]{.underline} has [converged with
**Russian belligerence** and **strategic competition** to reshape the
security environment of the north]{.underline}. [Warming trends are a
key enabler for **regional activity,**]{.underline} [which]{.underline}
will [yield]{.underline} potential for [both **competition** and
**friction**. The U.S. Geological Survey]{.underline} released a
Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal in 2008, [estimating]{.underline} the
presence of about [**90 billion barrels of oil** and **1,669 trillion
cubic feet of natural gas** in the Arctic. That's about 22 percent of
the world's undiscovered conventional oil and natural gas, including 13
percent of global oil reserves and]{.underline} more than [30 percent of
the world's natural gas]{.underline}, though about 84 percent is
estimated to be located offshore. The [Arctic is also a region with
trillions of dollars' worth of **minerals**]{.underline}, such as
silver, copper, gold, nickel, iron ore, [and **r**]{.underline}are
**[e]{.underline}**arth **[e]{.underline}**lement**[s]{.underline}**.

[With tremendous natural resources and potential as a transpolar bridge
connecting the trade centers of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the
region is emerging as a key arena for **strategic
competition**.]{.underline} [Not only are]{.underline} the eight [Arctic
states]{.underline}---Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark (Greenland),
Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and the United
States---[exploring economic opportunities, but]{.underline} a number of
[non-Arctic states have also begun developing **commercial** and
**military capabilities**]{.underline} to operate [in the
region]{.underline}. In particular, [China]{.underline} has
[demonstrated significant Arctic ambitions and has a **robust scientific
research** and **foreign investment plan** in the Arctic. An
**increasing Sino-Russian partnership** should alarm the
West]{.underline}.

During the Cold War, NATO's role in the Arctic was limited. While
submarines were active under the ice---particularly near Russia's
strategic bastions---and airspace was monitored for intercontinental
ballistic missiles and strategic bombers, the inhospitable climate
precluded significant military or economic activity. The collapse of the
Soviet Union marked a period of remarkable cooperation among all eight
Arctic nations, with the establishment of the Arctic Council and other
cooperative bodies.

Yet [Russia's war in Ukraine **froze Arctic relations**
among]{.underline} the [eight Arctic states]{.underline}. Indeed, [NATO
welcomed two additional Arctic states into the alliance, resulting in
seven of eight Arctic state]{.underline}s---about half of the
Arctic---[falling under Article 5.]{.underline}

Conflict in the Arctic is not new. Norway has defended its coastline
from attacks since the twelfth century. During World War II, the U.S.
Aleutian Islands of Attu and Kiska were occupied by the Japanese, while
Germans expanded their reach to occupy a large portion of Northern
Europe's strategic ports and mines. Allied convoys fought their way
across the North Atlantic, with Iceland serving as a strategic base and
resupply missions entering the ice-free port of Murmansk. The Arctic
became a dangerous battleground during the Cold War, albeit
predominantly under the ice or in the airspace marking the shortest
flight path between the two superpowers.

After the peace dividend years enabled years of "high north, low
tension," [Putin's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} has **[shattered
Arctic cooperation]{.underline}**. Indeed, [China is]{.underline} now
[**filling an economic investment gap** in Russia's Arctic
zone]{.underline}. In addition to [increased economic and technological
cooperation]{.underline}, the "[no limits friendship" is]{.underline}
also [seeing a greater frequency of **Russian** and **Chinese warships**
operating together, as they did off Alaska last year]{.underline}. Even
the Russian Federal Security Service has signed a memorandum of
understanding with the Chinese coast guard to enhance maritime security
cooperation.

[NATO should accept the realities of a **warming Arctic** and the
**emerging Sino-Russian partnership**. It is time to reinvigorate the
alliance's approach to the defense of the northern flank]{.underline}.
Critically, [key enablers should]{.underline} be [fund]{.underline}ed
[and develop]{.underline}ed [to ensure **successful deterrence** and
**defense**.]{.underline}

First and foremost, [NATO should reexamine command and control in the
north]{.underline}. [With]{.underline} the [accession of Finland and
Sweden, it is necessary to reevaluate the **Allied Joint Force Command**
structure and responsibilitie]{.underline}s to ensure that no seams are
present between Brunssum and Norfolk.

[**Communications** and **domain awareness** should also be enhanced in
a region that experiences unique polar atmospheric conditions that
diminish the]{.underline} spartan [capabilities that exist. The lack of
a **robust communications infrastructure** diminishes the capabilities
of units operating in the region]{.underline}. [Systems must be
optimized for **northern latitudes**]{.underline}---[and **extreme
cold**]{.underline}.

Further, [NATO should prepare to respond to a **wide array of threats**,
from **hybrid activities** that threaten critical infrastructure such
as]{.underline} data [**cables** and **pipelines** to **high-end
warfighting**]{.underline}. [The **Kola Peninsula** is home to some of
Russia's most advanced naval assets---and NATO forces must be prepared
to counter them.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} warming [waters of the north will further challenge
the ability to find **Russia's high-end sub**marine**s**]{.underline} as
the water profile evolves with the influx of fresh water and warming
temperatures. [It is critical that NATO redoubles its efforts to advance
its skill sets in a demanding environment against a **determined** and
**capable threat.**]{.underline}

Above all, [NATO forces should be equipped to excel in the Arctic.
Extreme cold, inhospitable weather conditions, darkness, and a **lack of
infrastructure** demand expertise]{.underline} in order to survive---let
alone [to deter and defend]{.underline}. The Arctic is not a pickup game
and requires tailored systems, training, and tactics.

[Increasing the size and frequency of NATO's northern exercises will be
critical to ensuring that allied forces hone the unique skill sets
required for **Arctic warfighting**. While]{.underline} exercises and
[operations like Dynamic Mongoose]{.underline} and Nordic Response [are
excellent starting points, they should be **expanded in scope** and
**complexity**.]{.underline}

[Though warming, the Arctic will continue to be a challenging region.
NATO should recognize the future challenges posed by **strategic
competition** in the region and an **emerging Sino-Russian partnership**

Establishing Legal Frameworks and Governance Options That Promote Arctic
Cyber Resilience," *Cybersecurity and Resilience in the Arctic*, ISBN:

The lack of prioritization of Arctic cyber resilience is at least partly
attributable to a poor understanding of cybersecurity needs by
stakeholders. Additionally, the Arctic has a multitude of actors at
different levels, which may leave authority and responsibilities around
cyber resilience unclear.\[156\] Agreement and cooperation do not always
come easily, especially in times of rapid and uncertain transformation,
such as that occurring in the modern Arctic. Trust is paramount,
especially when trying to establish consensus around a policy topic that
so many countries view as critical to their national security. Before
governance frameworks can be established, trust needs to exist between
all of the relevant actors. Using a mixture of different trust
mechanisms can help provide an avenue for compliance and consensus (see
Table 2). Additionally, better data analyses are needed to track and
assess effectiveness of solutions, to make informed policy decisions,
and to implement meaningful standards and guidelines. Cyber security is
not the same at every scale of governance in the system. The type of
cyber security needs depends on the level of a sub-system.
[[Shared]{.mark} cyber security [principles are
**necessary**]{.mark}]{.underline} in order [to ensure]{.underline} safe
baseline [security standards for known and unknown categories of risks.
[Integrated **reporting**, **info**]{.mark}rmation [**sharing**, and
**certificate programs**]{.mark} are]{.underline} a few [ways of
[ensur]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that [**baseline [standards]{.mark}**
[are met]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[100\] Agencies around the world have
proposed various standards and frameworks for cybersecurity. NIST has
proposed a cybersecurity framework for critical infrastructure in
response to United States Executive Order 13636.\[157\] Microsoft has
also provided six norms that the public and private sectors could adopt
to minimize cyber conflict and ensure cyber security (see Box 3).\[158\]
However, [[**countries** have **yet** to agree]{.mark} up[on
**international standards** that apply to the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and few are willing to share
cybersecurity specifics with other actors. The process of establishing
governance, frameworks, and norms for cybersecurity in the Arctic will
not be a linear process. This initiative will require compromise and
cooperation from multiple stakeholders---from individuals to
organizations and across the public to private sectors. Whether this
falls within the scope of the Arctic Council is unknown.

4\. 21st Century Solutions for 21st Century Problems

Characterized by low population densities, a lack of infrastructure,
extreme natural environments and specific cultures, including the
cultures of indigenous peoples, Arctic regions pose particular
challenges for effective governance. Tools, networks, concepts and
frameworks which have been developed for the mid-latitudes may not be
appropriate for the Arctic, in particular rural parts of the Arctic.
Effective governance requires taking into account the specific reality
of the life of those who are governed. In the case of the Arctic there
are often more similarities between a rural community in Canada and one
in Norway than between a remote rural community and the national capital
city. International efforts at Arctic governance, for example in the
Arctic Council, are noteworthy not only due to their ability to cross
political divides but also because of the role afforded to non-state
actors, such as indigenous peoples' organizations.

[**Cyberthreats** are an **emergent risk** in the Arctic]{.underline}.
Currently, [governance]{.underline}, including that [of cybersecurity,
relies on norms and principles developed in the]{.underline} post-Cold
War [**20th century**. Cybersecurity threats are]{.underline} distinctly
a **[modern]{.underline}**, 21st century threat. Dominant players can
include non-state [actors]{.underline}, adversarial activities [can
be]{.underline} hidden and [difficult to detect]{.underline}, and
targets include both tangible (e.g., physical infrastructure) and
intangible (e.g., knowledge) assets. It remains unknown whether
governance norms developed for the 20th century are reflexive enough to
adequately address such emergent threats.

[There is a [need for **resilience**]{.mark}**-based solutions** [to
guide]{.mark}]{.underline} planning and [[preparation for]{.mark} novel,
and unpredictable [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as those
[[presented by **cyber security failures**, so]{.mark} that Arctic
[systems can]{.mark} **absorb shocks**,
**[recover]{.mark}**]{.underline} from damage, [and **adapt**
to]{.underline} constantly changing hybrid [threats]{.underline}.

Existing tools and indicators used extensively in risk analysis (see Box
4) can provide a foundation from which to build from. But they are not a
solution in and of themselves for achieving cyber-resilience. As
globalization continues to connect the world in a myriad of surprising
ways, [shrinking sea ice]{.underline} in the Circumpolar North [is
driving]{.underline} emergent [global **opportunities**, **risks**, and
**conflicts**]{.underline} with no historical analogue. Emerging
challenges such as a changing climate are causing mass migration,
economic instability, disease, terrorism risk, and cybersecurity risks.
These threats and their consequences are largely studied in a
midlatitude context, and may be amplified or distorted whey they occur
wholly or partly within the Arctic. A combination of risk and
[**[resilience]{.mark} strategies** are needed]{.underline} in policy
and governance mechanisms [to [ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that [a
["safe-to-fail"]{.mark} approach is possible [in the
**long-run**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here, safe to fail means that small,
local failures can be embraced to reveal larger potential system
weaknesses, provide opportunities to innovate and adapt, and ultimately
expand the resilience of the whole Arctic system. [This is in contrast
to traditional "**hardening**"]{.underline} that seeks to avoid and
prevent all failures. This [hardening]{.underline} often [**undermines**
system **resilience** by hardening a **subset** of highly managed
feedbacks at the expense of **whole-system reflexivity**]{.underline}.
The challenges concerning Arctic cybersecurity do not have
straightforward solutions nor are they completely addressed through a
resilience framework. [A robust and [safe cyber]{.mark} system [will
require **coop**]{.mark}eration, **[universal
standards]{.mark}**]{.underline}, diverse perspectives, including
Indigenous voices; [and]{.underline} mutual [trust among
actors]{.underline} while simultaneously balancing geopolitical tensions
and individual state and community interests \[160\]. Despite the
difficulties, [**Arctic cybersecurity** should be a **policy
priority**]{.underline} as opportunities and threats emerge, amplify,
and distort in a rapidly transforming Circumpolar North.

#### [Streamlining commands]{.underline} and [increased communication]{.underline} between NATO members is [key]{.underline}\-\--it uniquely [builds resiliency]{.underline}.

What kind of NATO? Relations with allies and command structures

Another [set of [issues **NATO** must approach is]{.mark}]{.underline}
the exact perimeter of [[**Arctic operations** and]{.mark} the internal
[division of labor among **command structures**]{.mark}, **military
forces**, and Arctic-specific concepts of **operation**]{.underline}.
Even though the Arctic region remains peripheral in NATO thinking, it is
now taking up more space, especially from a maritime command point of
view. The exact division of labor remains undetermined but will shape
NATO's role in an Arctic context.

The [[accession of **Sweden** and **Finland** impacts how NATO should
approach **c**]{.mark}**ommand [and]{.mark} [c]{.mark}ontrol** (C2)
organization as well as the future]{.underline} force
[model]{.underline} and structure [for the Arctic]{.underline}.36 The
debate on C2 organization must consider the balance between Arctic and
Baltic security --- in command structure terms, between JFC Norfolk and
JFC Brunssum. [Further policy planning is something Nordic policymakers
are particularly eager to determine as it will impact the division of
responsibility and area of operation within NATO.]{.underline}

The debate has been somewhat closed now as Sweden and Finland will join
JFC Norfolk, under US command, to streamline North Atlantic and
potentially Arctic operations. Yet the exact perimeter of interaction
with JFC Brunssum remains to be determined. These boundaries between
both JFCs need to be clear and understood early in the process to ensure
that they can act effectively in a potential crisis.

[An important aspect of the discussion relates to the interconnection
between NATO and NORAD. NORAD modernization must go **hand in hand**
with further **integration** and **cooperation** with NATO
structures]{.underline}49 --- not least because the Supreme Allied
Commander Europe's area of responsibility (AoR) blends into NORAD's and
vice versa.

A [final aspect]{.underline} of the debate [is]{.underline} the
[[integration of **US command structures** within NATO in]{.mark} an
[Arctic]{.mark} context. As [**more dialogue** and
**info**]{.mark}rmation **[sharing]{.mark}** will be [necessary among
allies]{.mark}, the [US]{.mark} [must]{.mark} find]{.underline}
appropriate [ways to **[streamline]{.mark}** the [different
commands]{.mark} responsible for various aspects of Arctic
operations]{.underline} --- Northern Command ([NORTHCOM]{.underline}),
European Command ([EUCOM]{.underline}), Indo-Pacific Command
([INDOPACOM]{.underline}) --- [[and **coordinate** them]{.mark}
efficiently within NATO to avoid overlaps]{.underline}. Of particular
relevance is the interaction between US NORTHCOM and NATO JFC Norfolk in
the context of NATO's Regional Plan Northwest. These aspects are clearly
identified in the US DoD "2024 Arctic Strategy."50

Overall, [the [NATO]{.mark} 7 [must increase]{.mark} their
**collaborative** and [**cohesive approach** to Arctic security]{.mark}.
This will [require]{.mark} **more info**rmation and **[intelligence
sharing]{.mark}**, and ultimately better **coordination**. NATO members
must better [**coordinate military exercises** and **strategic
communication**]{.mark} around Arctic operations]{.underline}. For
instance, US NORTHCOM's Arctic Edge,51 Canada's Operation Nanook,52 and
NATO's Cold/Nordic Response exercises took place within weeks of each
other, yet with a striking and regrettable lack of coordination.

Another key question relates to finding the balance of response between
national and collective defense in an Arctic context. [Since the Arctic
is a question of homeland security for circumpolar states, [there is a
need to expand]{.mark} it to layered, [allied defense in an **integrated
way**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[It is worth highlighting the strengthening factor represented by the

[[maintains a significant]{.underline}]{.mark} the Coast Guard
[[icebreaking fleet]{.mark} comprising two heavy, seven medium, and nine
light icebreakers.]{.underline} [To replace its aging
fleet]{.underline}, [[**additional icebreakers** are]{.mark} currently
[under construction]{.mark}]{.underline}. For this purpose [the
Government of Canada announced the construction of **two new polar
icebreakers** in 2021]{.underline}, [with an estimated delivery date of
2030]{.underline}. Additional, the Arctic regions of Canada are
patrolled by ships and vessels of the Royal Canadian Navy (Government of
Canada, 2022). Furthermore, [it is worth noting [other countries with
icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Finland boasts a **fleet of 10
icebreakers**]{.mark}, including four heavy icebreakers. [Norway has two
icebreakers]{.mark} and [Denmark has four

[[Norway]{.mark}, [Canada]{.mark}, and [Iceland highlight]{.mark} the
**[importance of NATO]{.mark}** and the United States in their Arctic

[crucial]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the country\'s
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} the alliance\'s
[responsibility extending to the North Pole]{.underline}. Similarly,
[[Iceland\'s Policy]{.underline}]{.mark} on Matters Concerning the

[emphasizes]{.underline} close [cooperation with Scandinavian countries
and NATO allies to [monitor **security
developments**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[counteract
militarization]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [**[maintain peace]{.mark}**
and stability]{.underline} in the region. [Canada\'s Arctic]{.underline}

the Arctic\'s significance in terms of air and sea
approaches]{.underline} to North America [and commits to working closely
with the US]{.underline} to ensure the safety of both countries from
threats originating from the north. The Kingdom of [[Denmark
Strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} for the Arctic (Denmark, Greenland and the

The United States and the partners involved in these lanes of
cooperation should not only pre-approve transfers of relevant
technologies to other countries in the group --- they should also
pre-approve the re-export of those technologies within the group.
Despite the impetus to enhance allied interoperability, U.S. re-export
restrictions often prevent the sharing of American defense technology
between allies, even when such sharing is in U.S. interests. Such
expedited procedures do not need to be a one-size-fits-all approach.
Close allies with similar export control systems, such as those involved
in AUKUS, may have expedited procedures for a broad range of
technologies subject to the cooperative effort. Other partnerships might
use expedited procedures for less sensitive technologies or
current-generation capabilities, while maintaining tighter restrictions
over the more sensitive aspects of cooperation. Finally, if the
Department of Defense is serious about attracting the participation of
foreign defense firms to enhance **[defense cooperation]{.underline}**,
it [should be open to working with foreign partners across [**its**

[With **[Sweden]{.mark}** and **[Finland]{.mark}** as [**new members**
of NATO]{.mark}, the Arctic [region becomes **more prominent**
for]{.mark} the [Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Traditionally, the
Arctic---or the "High North" as it is called in the NATO context---has
primarily been managed by Arctic states such as Norway, Denmark,
Iceland, Canada, and the United States. [[NATO]{.mark} as an
organization [has **not been involved**]{.mark}]{.underline}, aiming to
create room for maneuver for the smaller states geographically close to
Russia and to avoid the risk of unwanted escalation between Russia and
the United States. Additionally, the [[absence of]{.mark} military
[threats]{.mark} in the High North after the Cold War has naturally
[**minimized** NATO's role]{.mark}]{.underline}. 

However, [[this dynamic]{.mark} is [changing]{.mark} now that
**[Sweden]{.mark}** and **[Finland]{.mark}** have [become]{.mark} **new
[members]{.mark}** of the Alliance]{.underline}. Referring to Russia's
military buildup in the region, as well as China's ambitions to increase
its investments and presence there, NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg has announced that "NATO must increase its presence in the
Arctic." The chairman of NATO's Military Committee, Admiral Rob Bauer,
pointed out in October 2023 that NATO could not be naïve about certain
actors' intentions in the area and that the organization must be
prepared for the unexpected.

A. Delegation, Blame-Shifting, and Statutory Junk

First, however, I need to deal with arguments that delegation does not
increase the extent to which [Congress can **[shift blame]{.mark}** to
agencies]{.underline} and so does not help cause statutory junk. The
allegation that [delegation lets legislators shift
blame]{.underline} bothers defenders of delegation in general, and
Deacon in particular, because his forbearance authority would increase
the scope of delegation. [He denies]{.underline} that delegation lets
legislators shift blame and cites three defenders of delegation for
support: Professors Jerry Mashaw, Eric Posner, and Adrian Vermeule.34
The passages of their work that Deacon cites consist of several
paragraphs of suppositions about how legislators and voters behave.35
These suppositions are supported by neither systematic descriptions of
the behavior of legislators and voters nor citations to the work of
political scientists, the social scientists who do systematically
describe the behavior of legislators and voters.36 [The conclusions in
**political science lit**erature based upon descriptions of the
**behavior** and incentives of legislators and voters]{.underline} are
massively contrary to the suppositions of these three law professors.37
In addition, [**[researchers]{.mark}** have used experimental subjects
to **[test]{.mark}** whether delegation of authority enables legislators
to shift significant amounts of blame to
agencies and **[found]{.mark}** that **[it can]{.mark}**]{.underline}.38

These observations and experimental results make sense because
journalists usually address five questions:

• Who did it?

• What happened?

• Where did it take place?

• When did it take place?

• Why did it happen?

[By delegating, legislators **[make the agency]{.mark}** rather than
themselves **[the "who" that took]{.mark}** the **[action]{.mark}** that
produced **unpopular consequences**]{.underline}. The statute that
delegated to the agency is one part of "why" it happened, but only one
part along with the facts and circumstances that led the agency to act
as it did. [[If]{.mark} the [statute]{.mark} is [mentioned]{.mark} at
all in the news account, [those **who voted**]{.mark} for it will
usually **[not]{.mark}** be **[listed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Their
opponents in future elections may seek to pin blame on those who did
vote for the statute, [but they [can]{.mark}]{.underline} in
turn [**[blame]{.mark}** the **[agency]{.mark}** for how it exercised
its **discretion**. They generally have **["plausible
deniability."]{.mark}**]{.underline} Moreover, even where the statute
gives the agency no discretion to avoid the blameworthy action, thereby
rendering the denial implausible, the case against the incumbent is
attenuated. Indeed, one set of experiments found that [delegation lets
legislators **shift significant blame** to an agency even when the
experimental subjects were **informed** that the legislators had enacted
**[direct orders]{.mark}** that compelled the agency to act in a certain
way]{.underline}.39

[The **poli**tical **sci**ence
**[lit]{.mark}**erature also suggests that politicians]{.underline} can
more [**[easily fool]{.mark}** "discrete,
atomized **voters**"]{.underline} than organized interests such as big
corporations and trade associations because the organized interests have
more information and longer attention spans.40 Such discrete,
atomized [voters are likely to [see through]{.mark} congressional
blame-[shifting **only** in **unusual
circumstances**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Senator Muskie did feel pressure
to produce new air pollution legislation in 1970, but Congress in the
pre-1970 air pollution statute openly left the critical decisions to an
agency. In contrast, Congress in many other statutes on the books today
has covered its tracks by issuing detailed commands. Moreover, Nader's
criticism in 1970 came at a time when millions of people rallied on the
streets to protest pollution, but few regulatory issues today would get
such a rise out of the public. Finally, in 1970, Muskie was a candidate
for President. In contrast, in the individual races for Congress, voters
are far less conscious of blame shifting.

[Legislators are experts at designing statutes to take
advantage]{.underline} of the blind spots of "discrete, atomized
voters." Not only is the 1970 Clean Air Act a case in point, but
subsequent [amendments to it reflected new twists to **[maximize
credit]{.mark}** and **[minimize]{.mark} blame**]{.underline}.41 Unlike
the pre-1970 air pollution statute, the current version is full of
detailed statutory commands such as the 940 instances of "shall" in the
Clean Air Act that protect Congress from accusations that it handed a
blank check to the agency.

Even Deacon does not seem to really believe Mashaw, Posner, and
Vermeule's arguments that Congress cannot shift blame to agencies
through delegation. Seven pages after invoking them, he asserts that
Congress may sometimes delegate forbearance authority to shift blame to
agencies: "With any kind of delegation, [Congress]{.underline} sometimes
may not appear to be harnessing the advantages associated with agency
decision making; instead, it may be [[engage]{.mark}d in **[political
buck-passing]{.mark}**]{.underline} 'in an attempt [to shift
responsibility]{.underline} for the negative impacts of
law [to **[other]{.mark}** governmental **[branches]{.mark}**]{.underline}.'"42

#### It's [especially true]{.underline} for national security [institutions]{.underline} 

**Dalal '14** \[Anjali; 2014; J.D. from Yale University; Michigan State
Law Review, "Shadow Administrative Constitutionalism And The Creation Of
Surveillance Culture," vol. 59\]

The evolution of the Attorney General Guidelines suggests that the
deliberation that Eskridge and Ferejohn demand in response to agency
norm entrepreneurship naturally occurs only in those rare instances when
we find ourselves in a national conversation\--when the entire country
is galvanized around a major reinterpretation of our rights framework.
Outside of these moments, our [[**national security** **institutions**
are insular organizations]{.mark} often **[operating under the
radar]{.mark}**]{.underline} of meaningful checks and balances. They
operate with an institutional proclivity towards mission creep and the
norms developed become entrenched through a process of path-dependency
and faith in historical practice. This corrupted process of agency norm
entrepreneurship and entrenchment is what I call shadow administrative
constitutionalism. It is a process in which [agency norm]{.underline}
entrepreneurship does not reflect public values and is not met with the
dialogic process assumed by Eskridge and Ferejohn, but nevertheless
leads to the entrenchment of norms that are far from democratically
obtained. Furthermore, I argue that [[shadow]{.mark} administrative
[constitutionalism]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[in the national security
arena is inevitable]{.underline}**]{.mark} without the manufactured
interventions of deliberation-forcing mechanisms.

Betsy **Reed 25**, editor-in-chief of Guardian US, \"Congressional
Republicans threaten revolt over Trump-led defence shake-up,\" Guardian,
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/20/defense-senate-house-republicans-nato,
3-20-2025//ILake-AW

[Republicans]{.underline} on Capitol Hill are [threatening]{.underline}
a [**revolt** against a defence **shake-up**]{.underline} reportedly
[planned by]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration [that
could see the US **relinquish**]{.underline} its [command of **Nato
forces**]{.underline} in Europe.

The two top Republicans on the Senate and House of Representatives armed
services committees, Roger [Wicker and]{.underline} Mike
[Rogers]{.underline}, [signaled]{.underline} their
**[opposition]{.underline}** [in an extraordinary joint
statement]{.underline} [warning]{.underline} that [the
change]{.underline} would "[risk undermining **American deterrence**
around the]{.underline} [globe]{.underline}".

[The]{.underline} statement -- a [**rare display** of
congressional]{.underline} [Republicans]{.underline}
**[rebelling]{.underline}** since Donald Trump's return to the White
House -- followed an NBC report that the Pentagon is considering giving
up the role of Supreme Allied Commander Europe (Saceur), a
[position]{.underline} [held]{.underline} by an American general [since
the Nato alliance was **formed**]{.underline} in 1949.

The proposed shake-up could also include folding separate US Europe and
Africa military commands into a joint command structure based in Germany
and the scrapping of plans to expand American forces in Japan as part of
a military buildup in the far east.

Wicker and Rogers said such changes would not be accepted without
recourse to Congress, which holds the "power of the purse" under US
constitutional norms.

"[US combatant commands]{.underline} [are the **tip** of the **American
warfighting**]{.underline} [spear]{.underline}," they said. "Therefore,
[we are **very concerned** about reports]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
claim [DoD is considering]{.underline} unilateral [changes on **major
strategic issues**]{.underline}, including significant reductions to US
forces stationed abroad, absent coordination with the White House and
Congress.

"We will not accept significant changes to our warfighting structure
that are made without a rigorous interagency process, coordination with
combatant commanders and the joint staff, and collaboration with
Congress. Such moves risk undermining American deterrence around the
globe and detracting from our negotiating positions with America's
adversaries."

Trump has already floated the idea of refusing to defend any Nato member
that is attacked -- an obligation enshrined under Nato's article five --
if it is deemed to have fallen short of its defence spending
commitments.

The two [congressional leaders]{.underline} said they
**[supported]{.underline}** [Trump's calls for **Nato alliance
partners** to raise defence]{.underline} [spending]{.underline} "[to
strengthen]{.underline} our **[alliance partnership]{.underline}**" and
pointedly added: "[We support continuing **America's leadership**
abroad."]{.underline}

The Punchbowl news website said the statement reflected Republican
defence hawks' "longstanding frustrations" with the Trump
administration. It represents a jarring departure from Republicans' meek
acceptance of White House encroachment on congressional prerogatives
over spending in the two months since Trump returned to office, which
has seen Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" impose brutal
cuts on government.

The plans stem from proposed 8% cuts in the Pentagon budget floated by
Pete Hegseth, last month.

[Defence experts]{.underline} and retired generals [say giving
up]{.underline} [the Saceur role]{.underline} would [signal]{.underline}
a wider [**abandonment** of the US leadership role in Nato, which
**Trump** has **frequently criticised**.]{.underline}

From Moscow's viewpoint, [the perceived '**[enlargement']{.mark}** [of
NATO to **Finland and Sweden** is fueling]{.mark}]{.underline} both [a
sense of **[vindication and vulnerability]{.mark}**]{.underline} across
the AZRF -- geographically extending from the North Atlantic and the
European High North, to North Pole approaches in the Central Arctic, to
the North Pacific and the Bering Strait.

On the one hand, [Russia's self-inflicted fear of 'encirclement'1) by
the Atlantic Alliance has been validated by **Finland and Sweden joining
NATO**.]{.underline} The double accession [[represents]{.mark}
a]{.underline} fait accompli for the Kremlin, honed by a
[self-reinforcing propagandistic [narrative that the Alliance is turning
the Arctic into a]{.mark} '**[conflict zone]{.mark}'2**]{.underline}) or
that there is a 'new Cold War'3) in the region [because of Western
policy]{.underline}.

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} narrative [[is compounded by]{.mark}
the]{.underline} recent [[release of the US National Strategy]{.mark}
for the Arctic Region]{.underline} (NSAR) [[in 2022 and]{.mark} the [US
Department of Defense Arctic Strategy in 2024]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[which]{.mark} are]{.underline} also denounced as 'deciding the
region's future by force'4) or '**[[inviting
confrontation]{.mark}'5]{.underline}**) [[in the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Finland and Sweden]{.mark} joining the Alliance further [fuels]{.mark}
the Russian [logic that]{.mark} the [**non-Russian Arctic** has
become]{.mark} '**[NATO territory]{.mark}'**]{.underline}.
[[This]{.mark} ends up [creati]{.mark}ng [a]{.mark} '**[NATO 7 vs.
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}'6) approach, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark}
tends to [[**securitize Arctic affairs** and shape
discussions]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly [[in **military
terms**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The policy consequences are that Moscow is
planning more than ever for all contingencies, including open military
confrontation in the Arctic.

On the other hand, from a previous perception of relative regional
strength and assertive force posture, [[the impact of the war]{.mark}
has [led Moscow to **feel vulnerable**]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}. This vulnerability is strategic (with the perceived
'expansion' of NATO) and military, especially with regards to the impact
of climate change and receding sea ice across the AZRF.

The [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}n leadership
[[fears]{.underline}]{.mark} that [a more accessible Arctic will
bring]{.underline} along more **[[military activity from
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its allies in the European Arctic and
above North Pole approaches. [It also fears there will be **more
military presence** from the US]{.underline} and Canada in the Pacific
Arctic -- [alongside Chinese inroads in circumpolar governance and
presence]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} July [2024]{.mark} Ukrainian [drone
strike]{.mark}]{.underline}7) on the Olenya air base [in
the]{.underline} northwestern Russian [Arctic]{.underline}, where
strategic bombers are stationed, also **[[reinforces]{.mark} their sense
of [vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- not least by defying the
genuine effectiveness of Russian regional air defense capabilities.

Ultimately, [[Moscow **does not want to be dispossessed**]{.mark} of its
control]{.underline} over the AZRF. The fact that [NATO's direct borders
with Russia have increased in size in the Arctic]{.underline} and Baltic
theaters [will undoubtedly push the Kremlin to **adapt its force
projection**.]{.underline}

In an interview with RIA Novosti on Sunday, Nikolay Korchunov, [the
Russian ambassador]{.underline}-at-large, [lamented the **growing

described as the uncooperative policies of the United States and its
allies.

Korchunov also [pointed out that [NATO\'s efforts to incorporate
Finland]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has already become a full member of
the alliance, [[and Sweden]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[indicate]{.mark} the
bloc\'s endorsement of]{.underline} \"[**[forceful]{.mark}

[Korchunov cautioned that [Moscow would]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[react

[implementing]{.mark}]{.underline} \"[a set of **[necessary
measures]{.mark}**, including **preventive ones**]{.underline},\" while
considering the objectives outlined in Russia\'s foreign policy concept
and Arctic strategy.

Simultaneously, [the diplomat conveyed [Russia\'s commitment to]{.mark}
fostering]{.underline} mutual [trust in the polar region to promote
**[stability, cooperation, and dialogue]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} declaration [comes shortly after]{.underline} Russian
President Vladimir [[Putin declared the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark},
along with the Far East, as [a strategic priority]{.underline} for the
country. [He emphasized the region\'s [**significance to Russia** in

T[he backdrop for these developments is [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg\'s [[assertion]{.mark} last year
[that Russia presents a]{.mark}]{.underline} strategic [**[challenge to
the alliance]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}, [[prompting a call

Ukraine conflict. While Helsinki officially became a member of the
US-led military alliance in April, Stockholm\'s application remains
pending. Türkiye and Hungary have been hesitant to endorse the bid due
to unresolved issues in bilateral relations.

Russian communication strategies on NATO in the Arctic

In recent years, **[[NATO's presence in the Arctic]{.mark} has [become
a]{.mark} prime [target for Russian disinformation
campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Russian communication [strategies
towards NATO]{.mark} in the Arctic have
[highlighted]{.mark}]{.underline} a series of [[narratives designed to
**undermine**]{.mark} **the alliance's [image]{.mark}** [and **divert
attention** from Russian actions in the region]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Researchers P. Whitney Lackenbauer, Troy Bouffard and Adam Lajeunesse
have highlighted Russian communications tactics associated with NATO in
the region. Using this analytical framework, a study of articles
published by TASS and Sputnik between 2020 and 2023 reveals that 80% of
content mentioning the keywords "NATO" and "Arctic" incorporates at
least one of the six themes identified by the researchers. Three of
these themes are central to the press articles studied.

Firstly, [[at the heart of]{.mark} the Russian press's communication
[strategy is]{.mark} the idea [that **NATO acts as a destabilizing
force**]{.mark}, threatening the balance of the Arctic and fuelling
perceptions of regional disruption. In 205 articles, the circumpolar
region is presented as a space where geopolitical tensions are
intensifying due to the significant increase in NATO's presence and
exercises.]{.underline}

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} theme [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} frequently
[[associated with the absurdity of the Russian
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}, [aimed at discrediting concerns
about]{.underline} the power's [military activity]{.underline}.
[[Moscow's]{.underline}]{.mark} muscular [[presence
is]{.underline}]{.mark} deliberately [[reduced to **harmless
gestures**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, [the articles [emphasize
**Russia's military activities as non-threatening**]{.mark} or in
compliance with international law, [while]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[stressing the superior number of NATO military
installations]{.underline}]{.mark}** compared with those of Russia.
[However, [observations by the]{.mark}]{.underline} International
Institute for Strategic Studies ([[IISS]{.underline}]{.mark}) and
Reuters [[point]{.underline}]{.mark} to a strategic reality favorable to
[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}, whose [[military presence in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} Circle notably [[exceeds that of NATO by
around a third]{.underline}]{.mark} in terms of bases.

A third [[major theme highlights]{.mark} the idea that the [Arctic
states are under]{.mark} the direct [influence of the United
States]{.mark}, describing these countries as pawns in a power game
where Washington imposes its interests. In this vision, **[NATO
members]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including Canada, [**[are depicted as
lacking autonomy]{.mark}** and entirely subject to American
hegemony]{.underline}. This simplistic but recurring hierarchical
framework (72 articles) denounces the subordination of NATO allies to
Washington's will, creating a clear opposition between the United States
and its allies on the one hand, and Russia on the other.

In press articles, [the three themes are frequently juxtaposed and
combined to offer a coherent image of the Arctic]{.underline}: [a space
where NATO]{.underline}, as an external actor, [exacerbates
tensions]{.underline} and where Russian initiatives are systematically
demined and legitimized. Added to this are three secondary themes:
[sanctions by Arctic states harm their own interests, the USA and **NATO
are poor guests**, and American colonialism.]{.underline} These are
combined with the three main themes and serve to accentuate the idea
that [NATO, led by the USA, is the instigator of unjustified regional
escalation.]{.underline} Thus, the sanctions imposed by the Arctic
countries on Russia are portrayed as being dictated by the USA and
unjustified due to the absence of a Russian threat. Similarly, the
[Russian press links the theme of Arctic states' subordination to
Washington to the idea that the US and NATO are bad hosts]{.underline},
accusing the White House of imposing military installations on the
territory of their allies and worsening environmental degradation.

[[During]{.mark} [the Cold War]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[Soviets
erected **thousands of monuments**]{.mark} and memorials [related to the
war]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Baltic states, Ukraine, Poland, and
throughout the Eastern Bloc. [Nowadays]{.underline} among the non-
Russian majority, [[these]{.mark} memorials]{.underline} largely
[[represent decades of]{.mark} Soviet [oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}.
As a result, they are sometimes vandalized, or local governments decide
to remove them from public spaces, and Russia exploits this as proof of
its neo-Nazi and Russophobia narratives. Russian deputy Foreign Minister
Mikhail Bogdanov alleged in May 2021 that "the Baltic region has become
a real hotbed of historical revanchism...They are trying to eradicate
the memory of the Soviet soldier-liberator from the consciousness of
ordinary Europeans...A direct consequence of this is the ever-growing
number of acts of vandalism against Soviet memorials abroad."\[27\]
[Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the same meeting, [[outlined
the role these]{.mark} cultural heritage [sites play in Russia's
historical propaganda policy]{.mark}]{.underline}: "[[We are]{.mark}
increasingly [faced with attempts to slander, distort
history]{.mark}]{.underline}, reconsider the role of the Red Army in the
defeat of Nazism... **[[We cannot leave such actions without reaction,
without a worthy response]{.underline}]{.mark}**... I am talking about
the work on the \[preservation\] of graves and memorials of Soviet
soldiers and officers who died during the Great Patriotic War." This
work is led by the Ministry of Defence, who in 2019 introduced new
legislation criminalizing the destruction, damage, or desecration of
Soviet military memorials in foreign states.\[28\] Consequently a major
component of Russian WWII propaganda output is devoted to Soviet
cultural property located in foreign states that Russia is in conflict
with.

After claiming that Lenin created modern Ukraine, Putin complained about
the treatment of Lenin statues in Ukraine.\[29\] [[Propaganda]{.mark}
around alleged vandalism of Soviet WWII memorials in Ukraine [has
been]{.mark} [ongoing]{.mark} since 2014]{.underline}.\[30\] Cultural
heritage exploitation also plays a role throughout other phases of
conflict. In September 2021, [[UNESCO]{.underline} [reported that since
the annexation of Crimea]{.underline}]{.mark} [in 2014,
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} "illegally **[[exports art artifacts
from]{.mark} the occupied [Crimea]{.mark},]{.underline}** [[which it
then exhibits in Russia]{.mark} in accordance with its own curatorial
narratives; cond[ucts **unauthorized archaeological
excavations**]{.mark}; [erases traces of the cultural presence]{.mark}
of the Crimean Tatars on the peninsula]{.underline}."\[31\] Also, since
2014, [[new monuments]{.underline}]{.mark} (commemorating both WWII and
the 2014 war) [[have been]{.mark} [installed]{.mark} in prominent
locations]{.underline} in the self-proclaimed DPR and LPR.\[32\]
[[Similar activities are likely to occur]{.mark} in any new Ukrainian
territory Russia occupies for the medium or long term. During the
present war, mounting evidence indicates negligent destruction and
deliberate targeting of civilian areas by Russian forces, including
those containing cultural heritage sites]{.underline}.\[33\]

understandable [reason for]{.mark} the]{.underline} public [[silence of
**Russia\'s**]{.mark} **top [elite]{.mark}**]{.underline}. All of my

is happening---either on [the war, or]{.underline} on
[[Russia\'s]{.mark} political [situation]{.mark}]{.underline} as a

impossible to foresee how **dangerous these**]{.mark} [**discussions

But some did agree to talk to this writer, on condition of anonymity.
[Many of them say that [those who left Russia]{.mark}, let alone

"[[There is a lot more fear now]{.underline}]{.mark}. People who left
two years ago don't understand it. [**Fear is swirling around**

[arrest as many people as Stalin]{.mark} did]{.underline}. [[**The
horror of being unprotected** is created by far fewer
examples]{.underline}]{.mark}," a former high-ranking official who
remains in Russia tells me.

He believes that one can leave Russian civil service only "amicably,"
that is, by mutual consent of the parties, which takes time and a lot of
informal agreements. This official began preparing an exit strategy
several years before 2022 and believes that had he not left the service
before the invasion began, he would not now be able to leave.

"To you, [an [anti-war stance]{.mark} may look moral and
justified]{.underline}," an official explains to me, "[but [to the

with a political decision when it has already been made]{.underline}."

The decision made is an important circumstance. Discussion of decisions
before they are made, outside the public eye, is quite possible, but
[[discussion]{.mark} after they are made, particularly in public, [is
not accepted]{.mark}. [Whatever move an official makes, it should never
look]{.mark} [like]{.mark} a political statement of
[disagreement]{.mark}. "[Otherwise, **you will be

[Russian [elites are]{.mark}]{.underline} reportedly

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/how-russian-elites-made-peace-war\]
SC

[[When the war in Ukraine began]{.mark}, the [Russian elite entered a
state of shock]{.mark}. As the West imposed sanctions and]{.underline}
travel [bans]{.underline}, [Russia's rich and politically connected
citizens became convinced that their previous lives were
over]{.underline}. Battlefield losses quickly piled up, and many deemed
the invasion a catastrophic mistake. "The Russia we deeply love has
fallen into the hands of idiots," [Roman Trotsenko, the former [head of
the country's largest shipbuilding company, told]{.mark}]{.underline}
another businessperson during a phone conversation that was leaked in
April 2023. "They adhere to bizarre, outdated nineteenth-century
ideologies. This cannot end well. **[[It will end in
disaster]{.underline}]{.mark}**." In [[another leaked]{.underline}
[conversation]{.underline}]{.mark}, the famous music producer Iosif
Prigozhin (not related to Yevgeny Prigozhin)
[[called]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark}
and his government]{.underline} "fucking
**[[criminals]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [Some of the [oligarchs who were
abroad]{.mark} at the time of the invasion [**refused to return** to
Russia]{.mark},]{.underline} including Mikhail Fridman, the owner of the
country's largest private bank.

[But that was then.]{.underline} [[As 2023 wound on, **elites started
endorsing the war**]{.underline}]{.mark}. More musicians began traveling
to perform in the occupied territories. In October, [Fridman [returned
to Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}from London, having
[[decided]{.underline}]{.mark} that life in the West under sanctions was
unbearable and [[that the situation in Russia was]{.mark}
**comparatively [comfortable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And [[there
have]{.underline} [been **no new recordings** of oligarchs grousing
about the war]{.underline}]{.mark}[. In fact, it is hard to imagine such
conversations happening.]{.underline}

[That is because [Russian elites have learned to stop worrying]{.mark}
about the conflict]{.underline}. [[They have concluded]{.mark} that the
invasion]{.underline}, even if they do not support it outright, [is a
tolerable fact]{.underline} [of life]{.underline}. As a result, [[the
odds that they might challenge the Kremlin's
decisions]{.underline}]{.mark}---which were always slim---[[have gone
away]{.mark} entirely]{.underline}. And instead of debating whether to
support Putin, [Russian elites are now discussing]{.underline} a
different question: [how the war might end]{.underline}.

They have different answers. Some believe that a big battlefield win
would allow Putin to claim a partial victory and, therefore, pause the
war. Others think that Putin will not stop until he has gone all the way
to Kyiv. Some are convinced that what truly matters to Putin is
confrontation with the West, not victory in Ukraine, and that he will
thus attack another state in Europe irrespective of what happens with
the current conflict. But a few pessimists maintain that the premise of
the question itself is wrong. As they see it, the war suits Putin's
political interests, and so he will keep fighting for as long as he
lives.

HOW THEY LEARNED TO STOP WORRYING

[There are multiple reasons why Russian [elites]{.mark} have shifted
toward Putin]{.underline}. One is that **[they [have become]{.mark} more
[cautious as Moscow cracks down on dissent]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Another, relatedly, is that they understand it is meaningless to
protest. But perhaps the biggest reason for their change is they have
begun to see the invasion in a fundamentally different light. Today,
they believe Russia is prevailing. Moscow, after all, is making steady,
if slow, battlefield gains. Ukraine is battered and outgunned, operating
with a massive artillery-shell disadvantage. And Western support for
Kyiv is waning, jeopardizing Ukraine's access to military supplies.

"It's bad to be an outcast as a winner, but it's worse to be an outcast
as a loser," one Russian oligarch, who had criticized the war before but
now seems to understand it, told me. (He, like others, spoke on the
condition of anonymity, to protect his safety.) [The oligarch said that
**[everything in Russia has changed]{.mark}**: [attitudes toward
Putin]{.mark}, [views of Ukraine]{.mark}, [and outlooks on the
West]{.mark}. "[We must win this war]{.mark}," he told me.
"[Otherwise]{.mark}, **[they won't allow us to live]{.mark}**. And, of
course, Russia would collapse]{.underline}."

[The [factors that hinder the formation of a **collective policy**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} the strengthening of [[**NATO activity**
in]{.mark} the **[Arctic]{.mark}** generally remain
relevant]{.underline}. What is at issue is, first of all, [[the
**divergent interests** of member states]{.mark} with regard to the
prospect of NATO's **Arctic strengthening**]{.underline}. Previously,
there was no opportunity to agree on any collective agenda. The Alliance
could not initiate the development of its own Arctic policy due to the
lack of prospects for a reliable internal consensus, as well as the
different status of the Arctic states (the neutrality of Sweden and
Finland). [[NATO]{.mark} continues to be [characterized]{.mark} [by
**transatlantic imbalance**]{.mark}]{.underline}: The
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates

[The **[dilemmas]{.mark}** of NATO's presence in the **Arctic** are
[becoming **more acute**, but]{.mark} have [not]{.mark} yet been
**[resolved]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are [[**strong motivations**

[escalation of]{.mark} the conflict in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}
increases the [[risks]{.mark} of a [**direct military conflict** between

scenarios, including [[strengthen]{.mark}ing the **[northern
flank]{.mark}**]{.underline} with the integration of Finland and Sweden,
[[but also taking]{.mark} the [**limited deployment capabilities**
in]{.mark} the northern [Arctic]{.mark} zone into account]{.underline}.
NATO's operational [[strengthening]{.mark} there [must be formalized by
**clear political directives**]{.mark}, which have obviously **[not yet
been developed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is evidenced by the official
conceptual and doctrinal documents of the alliance, in which the
NATO-Arctic theme is outlined, although increasingly noticeably, but not
clearly, in the format of political and diplomatic swings. The
insistence of a number of member countries on including the Arctic in
the alliance's sphere of operational activity faces a number of
significant limitations.

We are talking, first of all, about the [[**unwillingness** of the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates (and
Canada) [[to build]{.mark} a [system of]{.mark} strategic
[defense]{.mark} in the north together [with]{.mark} the [Europeans,

[[risks of violating]{.underline}]{.mark} the strategic [[balance
between]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} in favor
of Moscow. The official presentation of the US DoD Arctic Strategy (June
2024) places emphasis on ensuring "our"2 territorial defense. "The
United States is an Arctic country and this region is of critical
importance for the defense of our homeland, protecting the national
sovereignty of the United States and our obligations under defense
treaties. I am initiating this 2024 Arctic Strategy to guide the United
States Department of Defense toward a coordinated approach to
maintaining the Arctic as a stable region where US territory remains

for NATO to be stronger, not weaker. [To help [secure]{.mark} those
goals, the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[must remain]{.mark} the
**[leader]{.mark}** of the NATO alliance]{.underline}. But there are
reports that new advisers inside the Pentagon are advocating for the
president to surrender a key U.S. military role, that of Supreme Allied
Commander Europe (SACEUR). This would [[make]{.mark} the [U.S. less
**powerful**, render it less **influential**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
European forces, and [[increase]{.mark} the [risk of
**deterrence**]{.mark} **[failure]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[When America assumed its place as **leader** of **NATO**]{.underline},
President Harry Truman appointed Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower as the
alliance's first SACEUR. After America fought alongside the Allies to
liberate Europe, its hand at the helm at SACEUR visibly [demonstrated
its **commitment** to preserving the **peace** in
Europe]{.underline}---and, more specifically, its indispensable role as
the ultimate security guarantor of the alliance's nuclear weapons. The
SACEUR determines the overall direction of the military alliance, and
plans and directs all NATO military operations. This American four-star
general is also the Commander of U.S. European Command, and he is
physically located in Mons, Belgium, at the Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe (SHAPE).

[[American **control**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the SACEUR position has
not only been good for Europe, it has also been good for the United

**moral**---[as the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, and this [**remains true** even in an
age of chest-thumping "**realism**" trending toward
cynicism]{.underline}. The **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[remains]{.mark} the [**coalescing** force

world [with the]{.underline} hard-earned [[ability to drive
**consensus**]{.underline}]{.mark} across disparate democratic nations

**[forces]{.mark}** and **[capabilities]{.mark}**, and [make a more
**credible** and **effective**]{.mark} integrated [NATO]{.mark} military
architecture]{.underline} is keeping the SACEUR position in American
hands, not vacating it and submitting American forces to the command of

power, but it does court disaster.

Former President [**Donald [Trump]{.mark}** has [long been **critical**
of **NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the post-World War II alliance between
the U.S. and many European countries, [[because]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited

portion** in **defense spending**]{.mark}]{.underline} among member
countries [[while]{.underline}]{.mark} the majority of the [[others
contribute a]{.mark} [much **smaller share**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Trump\'s view can be controversial \-- most recently when he
[[said]{.underline}]{.mark} during a campaign rally this month that [he
would \"**[encourage]{.mark}**\" [Russia \"to do **whatever**]{.mark}
**the hell [they want]{.mark}**[\" to **NATO allies**]{.mark} who don\'t
spend enough]{.underline} defense funds.

[NATO\'s secretary-general said]{.underline} that [comment
\"**[undermines]{.mark}** all of our [security]{.mark}, including that
of the U.S.,\"]{.underline} and Trump\'s primary rival Nikki Haley
called it \"bone-chilling.\"

\"We have to start waking up to what this means,\" Haley said on ABC\'s
\"This Week.\"

[[Trump]{.mark} has **[dismissed backlash]{.mark}** from his critics
[and **doubled down**]{.mark} on his claim that he **would not protect**
allies]{.underline} who don\'t meet their share of defense spending
while not going as far as suggesting he\'d urge Russia\'s aggression
toward them.

\"President Trump got our allies to increase their NATO spending by
demanding they pay up,\" a campaign spokesperson previously said,
adding, \"When you don\'t pay your defense spending you can\'t be
surprised that you get more war.\"

Trump\'s allies and some of his critics alike say his concerns about
NATO defense spending are \"legitimate\" and an issue that has been
raised by his predecessors (and other politicians) over the years.

But detractors also say [Trump\'s [rhetoric sends a **troubling
signal**]{.mark} about an alliance that many have credited with
deterring another **continent-wide war**]{.underline}.

In the absence of time-travelling capability that would enable
counterfactuals to be tested, determining the optimal approach to a
given situation is essentially impossible. Consequently,
[[selecting]{.mark} the [**right policy** from]{.mark} the [**plethora**
of]{.mark} available [options]{.mark} is a **[timeless
challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the [**[uncertainty]{.mark}**
surrounding the **Arctic** [renders]{.mark} the [problem **particularly
acute**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accepting this reality, continually
seeking to improve the decision-making processes is vital. Notably,
while enhancing situational awareness is beneficial, increasing the
quantity or quality of information available to decision-makers is not
in itself a comprehensive guarantee of optimal policy. As a result,
[[improved **decision-making** requires]{.underline}]{.mark} an
examination of the way in which decisions are made rather than relying
solely on increasing the quantity of information and data available.
This examination requires [**[careful]{.mark}** self-reflection and

priors that underpin what we see as our own knowledge]{.underline}, and
the lenses through which we assess and analyse the information that we
receive.\[xxi\] Without this reflection, we leave ourselves open to
foundational misunderstanding about what is occurring in the Arctic and
in the international community more broadly, both of which limit our
ability to accomplish our objectives efficiently.

#### Clear signaling is key to [relations]{.underline} AND [conflict prevention]{.underline}.

**Åtland '14** \[Kristian; April 28; Senior Research Fellow, Norwegian
Defense Establishment; Comparative Strategy, "Interstate Relations in
the Arctic: An Emerging Security Dilemma?" vol. 33\]

This is not to say there is no potential for military tensions in the
Arctic. Unlike Antarctica, [[the **Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark} is not,
and unlikely to become, a demilitarized zone. The region still [[plays
an important role in]{.mark} the **nuclear [deterrence]{.mark}**
[strategies]{.mark} of **Russia** and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, and all of the Arctic coastal states attach
great importance to their economic and national security interests in
the region. If challenged by their neighbors or outside actors, they may
be willing to go to great lengths to defend their interests, if
necessary by the display or use of military force.

Thus, the Arctic coastal states seem to find themselves in a classic
security dilemma: If they do not uphold or strengthen their military (or
homeland security)5 capabilities in the region, there is a risk that
other and more powerful actors may try to exploit their weakness and
threaten their economic and/or security interests in the region. On the
other hand, if they do strengthen their military capabilities in the
Arctic, there is a risk that their neighbors may feel intimidated or
threatened by their measures, and eventually initiate similar ones. This
may in turn necessitate additional measures and heighten the level of
military tension in the region.

[[The]{.mark} **underlying [problem]{.mark}** [seems to
be]{.mark}]{.underline} a persisting [[**lack of certainty**
about]{.mark} other actors']{.underline} peaceful
[[intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Judging from the official political
rhetoric, none of the Arctic coastal states expects the region to become
a conflict arena, at least not in near future, and most of them--
particularly Russia and the United States--appear to have more pressing
security challenges elsewhere. [Yet [no]{.mark}]{.underline}ne of the
coastal [[states excludes]{.mark} the possibility of **interstate
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Arctic, for instance
[[over]{.mark} access to **natural [resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}
located in areas under their jurisdiction [[or]{.mark} strategic
**[shipping]{.mark} lanes**]{.underline} transiting through their
coastal waters. As indicated by examples derived from mainstream
political discourse in these countries and the content of
region-specific strategy documents adopted in recent years, [the
**[states]{.mark}** that surround the Arctic]{.underline} have a
tendency to [justify or [explain their]{.mark} defense]{.underline} and
security policy [[moves]{.mark} in the region [by referring
to]{.mark}]{.underline} (not always [**accurate [accounts]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline}) [[what]{.mark} their neighbors]{.underline},
[and sometimes **outside [actors]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [do or [have
done]{.mark}]{.underline}. One's own measures, which may include the
acquisition of new capabilities, increases in the number of sea and air
patrols, or changes in the scope or pattern of military operations, are
typically presented as being of a defensive/reactive nature. Similar
measures undertaken by other actors are frequently perceived as being of
an offensive nature, potentially signaling revisionist intentions and
justifying adequate countermeasures.

[[Uncertainty about]{.mark} the **[intention]{.mark}** of
others]{.underline}--whom to trust--[[is]{.mark} an [inescapable]{.mark}
feature of]{.underline} human and [international relations]{.underline}.
But uncertainty is not always synonymous with insecurity. [[In the
**Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as elsewhere, [[there may be
ways]{.mark} to **[mitigate]{.mark}** the **negative [effects]{.mark}**
of the dilemma outlined above]{.underline}. [[Central]{.mark} in this
regard [are]{.mark}]{.underline} the actors' willingness and ability to
consider [[how]{.mark} their]{.underline} defense and **[security
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}** moves in the region [[are **perceived**
by others]{.underline}]{.mark}, and how they may [[reduce]{.mark} the
risk of [**miscommunication** through]{.mark}]{.underline} increased
transparency and **[proper [signaling]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Enhanced
military-to-military [cooperation in the management of]{.underline}
common [security challenges can contribute to [creating an atmosphere
of]{.mark} **mutual [trust]{.mark}**]{.underline} and provide favorable
conditions for the development of a viable and lasting Arctic "security
community."6

## Canada

### Canada CP\-\--2AC

#### Canadian defense is [dead]{.underline} which [wrecks cooperation]{.underline}. Increased funding can't solve.

College, \"Justin Trudeau and NATO: The problem with Canadian defence
isn't cash, it's culture,\" Conversation,

A recent [open letter signed by]{.underline} 61 Canadian retired
[security professionals]{.underline} [called on Canada to meet
its]{.underline} [commitment to **[NATO's goal]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of two per cent of GDP in defence]{.mark} spending]{.underline}. It
was quickly followed by a Washington Post revelation that [[Canada will
**never meet that**]{.mark} target.]{.underline}

The ongoing Discord security leak of classified files includes this
admission by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to NATO officials.

It illustrates the slow-motion crisis in Canada's defence and security
policy. Canada has long sought to paper over its failure to meet NATO's
targets through the excellence of its military personnel and a series of
operational commitments over the years, where it has often assumed
significant leadership roles.

These [[initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[hidden]{.underline}]{.mark} the [internal [**organizational
rot**]{.mark} of aging equipment [and **shrinking readiness**]{.mark}
for military conflict.]{.underline}

Demands for Canada to step up

The Washington Post revelations have resulted in calls for Canada to
step up its spending and meet the goals it agreed to in 2006 and again
in 2014.

It doesn't matter that the goal of spending two per cent of GDP is an
artificial standard that makes no sense from a defence capability
perspective --- and is cynically manipulated by all players in terms of
what gets counted. NATO agreed on it as a baseline, Canada made
commitments to meet it and our allies are watching.

Still, as important as [[money]{.underline}]{.mark} is for the overall
health of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF), [it's [not the]{.mark} **real
[problem]{.mark}** affecting]{.underline} [defence in this
country]{.underline}. [[Rather]{.underline}, [it's]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a combination]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [factors revolving
around]{.underline} the issue [of **[culture]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

1\. Culture concerns

The CAF is currently understaffed by about 16,000 personnel out of a
total of 101,500 authorized positions.

Many of those missing personnel are at the middle-management level.
[[There's been]{.mark} a massive [**exodus of talent** following]{.mark}
years]{.underline} [of **[poor leadership]{.mark}** and
management]{.underline}, [[with]{.mark} back-to-back [heavy]{.mark}
**operational [deployments]{.mark}**]{.underline} and constant family
disruption --- all in an environment where average Canadians have little
idea or concern about the sacrifices service members make.

The often [[harsh demands]{.mark} of]{.underline} [military life [on
top]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [revelations of
**[sexual misconduct]{.mark}**]{.underline} have
**[[dissuaded]{.underline}]{.mark}** many young [Canadians from
[enlisting]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Personnel shortages]{.underline}]{.mark} have also
**[[reduced]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [number of [staff
available]{.mark}]{.underline} to manage ongoing programs, meaning that
[despite]{.underline} the [increases]{.underline} [to defence
spending]{.underline} made recently, **[[billions go
unspent.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

2\. No strategic thinking

The **[[public service]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is]{.underline} also
[part of the problem]{.underline}, [[lacking]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[experience to understand]{.underline}]{.mark} the interaction between
[[war and diplomacy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[Few officials]{.underline}** outside of the Department of National
Defence (DND) **[understand]{.underline}** the [issues of
war]{.underline}, nor are there many opportunities for them to gain such
knowledge. Given the need to move between multiple departments for
career advancement, even some within the DND lack a broad perspective on
this.

#### Lack of [domestic support]{.underline} tubes solvency.

4-23-2023//ILake-AW

3\. Complacent Canadians

But perhaps [the [**greatest threat** to Canada's defence is **Canadians
themselves**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Canadians]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[long]{.mark} been]{.underline} [[assured by]{.mark}]{.underline} our
geographical expanse and [**[remoteness]{.mark}** that there
are]{.underline} [few military threats]{.underline} facing the country.

Sen. Raoul Dandurand expressed this best when he noted in 1924 that
"Canada is a fireproof house, far removed from inflammable materials."

Even as far back as 1875, one politician noted "...situated as we are,
not likely to be involved in war, and having a large demand upon our
resources for public improvements, it was highly desirable to have our
military affairs conducted as cheaply as possible."

[Canadian attitudes towards]{.underline} [defence have]{.underline} long
[historical legs]{.underline} firmly [situated in]{.underline} the
geopolitical realities of a continent dominated by only [three friendly
states]{.underline} --- one of which is a superpower --- endowed with
rich natural resources and separated from the rest of the globe by three
enormous oceans.

Canadian [politicians]{.underline} [take]{.underline} their [cues from a
[public]{.mark} that]{.underline} [[remains]{.underline}]{.mark} more
[[concerned about **domestic issues**]{.underline}]{.mark} of inflation,
health care and education [than **defence**.]{.underline}

[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} three issues, however, [[will **not** be
solved by **greater**]{.underline}]{.mark} amounts of **[[defence
spending]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

A non-issue for Canadians

Indeed, Canadian complacency assures that the prime minister's admission
to our allies won't haunt him in any real domestic sense beyond a couple
of bad news days. Nor is it likely to be an election issue.

And should the Conservatives succeed this government, they likely won't
do anything different --- [[there is]{.mark} simply **[no]{.mark}
domestic [political reward]{.mark}** [for solving these]{.mark}
problems]{.underline}.

There are enormous international political risks, however, for Canada to
continue on this course. [[Its "brand]{.mark}" among its closest allies
[is taking]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[significant
hits]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

While United States President Joe Biden's administration is far more
diplomatic than its predecessor on this matter, it's [evident
that]{.underline} [[the U.S. **no longer feels** Canada]{.underline} [is
serious about]{.underline}]{.mark} its **[international
[roles]{.mark}]{.underline}** and commitments and has begun the process
of sidelining us.

This was spectacularly evident in the omission to discuss the trilateral
AUKUS deal with Canada prior to its signing by the U.S., the U.K. and
Australia. As international tensions increase, alienating those we need
to work with is a poor strategy for success.

Canadians were shocked by how fragile their health-care system was under
the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. But our military is under similar
stresses and we cannot simply assume it will be ready for the challenges
of the emerging international environment.

[[Canada's under-investment]{.underline}]{.mark} in its security [is
excused by **strong cultural issues**]{.underline} [that [can't be
**easily wished away**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sadly, [[only a **major
disaster**]{.underline} [can teach]{.underline}]{.mark} [critical
lessons]{.underline} [[about]{.underline} [**failing to address** this
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[**Clearly**, [a change from]{.mark} a transatlantic intercontinental
deterrence with the [US to]{.mark} a **regional** [European]{.mark} one
[would **fundamentally destabilise** Europe's security]{.mark}
order]{.underline}. [[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark}, for its part,
[[has]{.mark} almost [**no institutional capacity** for nuclear
planning]{.mark}, and the public debate [remains **emotionally** and
**politically** fraught]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless, politicians
in Berlin are beginning to speak about the need for a "European
solution" to concerns over deterrence, as Merz repeated in his inaugural
visit to Paris on 7 May. It is not yet clear what form this might take,
but it signals a dramatic shift in mindset. The very fact that strategic
thinkers are now modelling what deterrence without the US might look
like is itself a sign that Europe is entering a new era.

However, [an emboldened new [Germany]{.mark}, at the head of the EU,
[faces a **harsh world** and]{.mark} an even **harsher** set of
**[realities]{.mark}**. The country [will]{.mark} not only [have to
increase]{.mark} its military [capacity, bring about bloc-wide]{.mark}
military [cooperation and]{.mark} perhaps even [station troops]{.mark}
in Ukraine, but it will also have to [**pay** for all of
this]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This will [[require overhauling]{.mark} Germany's strict
[ceiling]{.mark} on public borrowing]{.underline}, the so-called
Schuldenbremse (debt brake) [**enshrined** in the
**constitution**]{.underline}. Merz has now begun that process; on
Tuesday, his party struck agreement with its prospective coalition
partners, the SPD, on the creation of a special €500bn (£390bn) fund to
boost defence and infrastructure spending that would be exempt from the
debt constraint. If approved by the German parliament, [this would
amount to a dramatic and some critics warn risky **loosening** of the
budgetary **straitjacket**]{.underline}.

[[Merz will]{.mark} also [have to **rally** the EU]{.mark}]{.underline}
(though Trump's harrying of Europe and Zelenskyy is already pushing
European leaders toward his vision), [as well as [face down
**Trump**]{.mark}-friendly far-right parties, many of them in ascendence
across the bloc]{.underline}.

At a recent meeting in Madrid of the rightwing radical bloc of the
European parliament, [the Patriots for Europe]{.underline}, Geert
Wilders, leader of the far-right PVV in the Netherlands,
[[praised]{.mark} Trump [as a "**brother in
arms**"]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Slovakia's]{.underline} prime minister,
Robert Fico, [expressed his [support for]{.mark} Trump's [pro-Russian
policy]{.mark}]{.underline} at the rightwing Conservative Political
Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland last month. AfD co-leader Alice
Weidel has said that "[Trump is implementing the policies that [the
**AfD**]{.mark} has been demanding for years]{.underline}".

[These rightist politicians seem willing to risk Europe's security and
prosperity for political gain. The US turn toward Russia and away from
democracy will be an **[existential]{.mark}** test [for the European
project]{.mark} and Europe's commitment to law and
democracy]{.underline}. The art of European cooperation has long been to
achieve the possible in unforeseen circumstances. [Germany,

[[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark} too [**pledged** to boost its
[defense]{.mark} spending]{.underline}. Scholz declared that Germany
would put the 2 percent goal "in writing," and created a special fund of
roughly \$108 billion to raise military spending.

However, those public promises have [[**failed** to
**materialize**]{.mark} into **long-term** results. The **special fund**
remains largely [untouched]{.mark}, as does **[military
spending]{.mark}**. [Following]{.mark} the [Russian invasion]{.mark},
the German [defense]{.mark} budget **actually
[shrunk]{.mark}**]{.underline}, following the tradition of cuts
initiated by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder in the early 2000s.

[Even with the special fund, Germany is expected to **[miss]{.mark}**
its [2 percent]{.mark} target [until]{.mark} at least [2027]{.mark}, at
which point defense spending will **fall** back below **1.2 percent** of
GDP]{.underline} unless the German government takes drastic action.

A report from the German Parliament, or Bundestag, in 2019 [paints an
**[alarming]{.mark}** picture of the [state of readiness]{.mark} of the
German military. [Troops]{.mark} said they [lacked]{.mark} **boots,
clothing, modern helmets, night vision devices**, and protective
vests]{.underline}.

Another report from 2023 found that [[Germany is devoting]{.mark} only
[**20 percent** of]{.mark} the [necessary resources to funding new
projects]{.mark}, including the procurement of new weapons]{.underline}.
Former German Defense Minister Rupert Scholz called the report
["**catastrophic**,"]{.underline} saying that "[[the entire defense
capability]{.mark} of the federal republic [is **suffering**]{.mark},
which is **irresponsible**]{.underline}."

[Germany is also [lacking in \[**personnel**\]]{.mark}]{.underline}
~~manpower~~, with just 178,000 active-duty personnel. Italy, which has
more than 22 million fewer people than Germany, has a fighting force of
183,000.

Meanwhile, [it is **U.S. taxpayers** that have picked up the tab for
[Germany's]{.mark} shortfall]{.underline}. There are nearly 40,000 U.S.
troops in Germany, infusing billions into the German economy.

[Berlin has also been [**reluctant** to back Ukraine]{.mark} with
weapons and ammunition, again **[leaving]{.mark}** most of the
[**burden** to]{.mark} the United States and other [NATO]{.mark}
members]{.underline}. In another development that proved former
President Donald Trump exactly right, [Germany faced a major
**[crisis]{.mark}** early in the war [as Russia **threatened** to cut
off energy]{.mark} supplies to German cities]{.underline}.

[**Instead of** established economic powerhouses like **Germany**, [it
is new NATO members]{.mark}]{.underline} who joined the alliance after
the Cold War -- [which largely make up]{.underline} what former Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld called ["New Europe" -- [who are
**leading**]{.mark} the way]{.underline}. Along with Poland, most of
these nations like Finland are spending well over 2 percent of their GDP
on defense. These countries have also stepped up to come to the aid of
Ukraine in its war against Russia.

BERLIN, Feb 13 (Reuters) - [The [German]{.mark} army\'s
battle-[readiness is **less** than]{.mark} when Russia invaded
[Ukraine]{.mark} in 2022]{.underline}, military officials, lawmakers and
defence experts told Reuters.

[**[Even if]{.mark}** a [new]{.mark} government boosts defence
[spending, it will remain \[impeded\]]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~hamstrung~~
[[for **years**]{.mark}, particularly [by a lack of air defence,
artillery and soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}, they said.

\"Before Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, we had eight brigades at around
65% readiness,\" Colonel Andre Wuestner, head of the German Armed Forces
Association, told Reuters in an interview. [Sending weapons, ammunition
and equipment to **[Ukraine]{.mark}**, as well as accelerating
Germany\'s own drills, [took a **toll**]{.mark} on the available
equipment]{.underline}, he said.

\"Together, this means the [German land [forces are **down** to a
readiness of]{.mark} around **[50%]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" he said.

Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised after Russia\'s invasion to overhaul
Germany\'s decrepit military, but three years later a pledge to provide
the NATO alliance with two divisions -- typically around 40,000 troops
-- by 2025 and 2027 faces major setbacks, more than a dozen military
officials, lawmakers and defence experts said.

The details revealed by the sources, some of whom spoke on condition of
anonymity as they discussed classified military information, [underscore
Berlin\'s **precarious** position as Europe faces a new geopolitical era
under]{.underline} U.S. President Donald [Trump]{.underline}.

Germany, alongside Poland, is tasked by NATO with providing the bulk of
ground forces that would act as first responders to any Russian attack
on the alliance\'s eastern flank.

Scholz\'s historic pledge to bring about a Zeitenwende, or [turning
point, in [Germany\'s approach]{.mark} to its military **[has not
worked]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the sources said, [blaming a
**[lack]{.mark}** of a sense of **[urgency]{.mark}**, a **[dysfunctional
procurement]{.mark}** system [and **strained
finances**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Berlin has **failed**]{.mark} to fully equip troops for a division for
NATO by the start of this year, and in any case has no air
[defences]{.mark} to support them]{.underline}, the sources said.

[Its pledge for a NATO division by 2027 is \"**[long out of]{.mark}**
our **[reach]{.mark}**,\" said a military source]{.underline}.

That second division is only about 20% equipped, according to opposition
lawmaker Ingo Gaedechens, a defence expert on parliament\'s budget
committee.

\"[[**Even if** we were to order everything now, we would not get it
equipped]{.mark} in time]{.underline},\" said Gaedechens. Polls suggest
his Christian Democrats (CDU) party, headed by candidate chancellor
Friedrich Merz, will lead a new government after Germany\'s February 23
election.

The Bundeswehr also has a second **[[severe
deficit]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which relates [[to munitions
stockpiling]{.underline}]{.mark}, similarly [not taken into account in
the special fund]{.underline}. Beyond major modernisation projects, the
Bundeswehr's [greatest **weaknesses** continue to be its ammunition and
spare parts stockpiles, which have **thinned out** over the
decades]{.underline}. The Bundeswehr's [inventories are currently [**so
short** that in a]{.mark} high-intensity [war]{.mark} against a
symmetrical opponent, some branches of the armed [forces]{.mark}, such
as the Luftwaffe, [would run out of munitions on]{.mark} just [the
**second day**]{.mark} of fighting]{.underline}. Although the Chief of
Defence, General Eberhard Zorn, put the necessary investments for
munitions and spare parts at about 20 billion euros in the run-up to the
special fund negotiations, these items were not included in that fund;
instead, they are to be covered in future by the regular defence budget.
This puts the [urgently needed replenishment of Bundeswehr munitions and
spare parts stockpiles [in danger of being **cut** during future
budget]{.mark} negotiations, further **[impairing]{.mark}** the
[viability]{.mark} of the German armed forces]{.underline}.

Significant Deficiencies in the Implementation of the Special Fund

[In addition to the planning gaps]{.underline} in the special fund, [the
[greatest threat]{.mark} to the fulfilment of Germany's commitments to
NATO [lies in]{.mark} the **sluggish [implementation]{.mark}** [and
**expenditure**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the special fund. [The
cumbersome and inefficient military **[procurement]{.mark}** system
[remains a **bottleneck**]{.mark} for accelerated Bundeswehr
modernisation]{.underline}. In order to fulfil Germany's extensive
obligations to NATO, some of which have deadlines that have been moved
up, procurement projects would have to be set in motion at a
correspondingly vigorous pace. But the fact that in 2022 not a single
cent of the special fund will be spent, and that current budget planning
provides for less than a tenth of available funds (just 8.5 billion
euros) to be spent in 2023 shows that policymakers will not succeed with
regards to swift procurement in the foreseeable future.
[[Whether]{.mark} the military [contributions to NATO]{.mark}, to be
fulfilled by 2025, [will]{.mark} indeed [occur is]{.mark} thus **[more
than questionable]{.mark}**. The target of **[two per cent]{.mark}** of
GDP for defence spending]{.underline} that Chancellor Scholz personally
committed himself to [[is **not likely**]{.mark} to be
achieved]{.underline} until 2024, and possibly even later.

[The reasons for the Bundeswehr's bureaucratic procurement process are
partly [due to]{.mark} the **complicated legal
[framework]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which has already been addressed with
the passing of a law to accelerate procurement procedures. However,
[there are also **structural** reasons as to why the Bundeswehr is using
the special fund in bits and pieces, and far too **slowly**. Germany's
Federal Office of Bundeswehr Equipment, Information Technology and
In-Service Support (BAAINBw), which is responsible for [procurement,
cannot keep up with **awarding**]{.mark} procurement
**[contracts]{.mark}** to industry, and needs to be
reorganised]{.underline} in order to ensure more efficient outflow from
the special fund. In addition, [the BAAINBw also has about 1,300
[unfilled posts]{.mark}, accounting for about eleven per cent of its
personnel, which helps [explain]{.mark} the [sluggishness]{.mark} with
which the agency is transacting the increased volume of
orders]{.underline}. Additional personnel is urgently needed.

German policymakers have to explain that peace and stability must be
defended even with military force when necessary.

Finally, [there is also **[insufficient]{.mark}** practical
[**implementation** of]{.mark} joint European armament
[projects]{.mark}]{.underline}. An example of this problem is the
German-French-Spanish project for developing a future combat air system
(FCAS), comprising especially a next-generation fighter aircraft -- a
project that Scholz mentioned in his 27 February address. [FCAS is
currently [so **gridlocked** because of infighting]{.mark} among [the
companies]{.mark} involved over exchange of sensitive technologies that
many observers [no longer rule out]{.mark} the project's **[complete
failure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is here that German policymakers, and
above all the German chancellor, should be called upon to assume a
degree of responsibility not only for the announcement, but also for the
successful implementation and full execution of these ground-breaking
joint armament projects to secure European technological superiority for
decades to come.

Beyond 100 Billion Euros: [A **Cultural** Zeitenwende Is
Needed]{.underline}

[In order for Germany [to fulfil]{.mark} its obligations to
[NATO]{.mark}, a reworking of the implementation and design of the
special fund is [required]{.mark}, as are [**fundamental shifts**
in]{.mark} German security policy, as well as a **strategic
repositioning** of Germany itself]{.underline}. The Zeitenwende must
therefore not limit itself to financial and procurement policy aspects
of Bundeswehr modernisation; it must be more comprehensive and
sustainable. In addition to the shift in equipment, [this]{.underline}
should also [entail a shift in personnel policy for the German military
-- and]{.underline}, crucially, [a fundamental rethinking of security
policy, a shift in strategic **[culture]{.mark}**, and closer meshing of
military, politics, and society]{.underline}.

STUTTGART, Germany --- [[Germany's military is]{.mark} **virtually
[undeployable]{.mark}** and security experts say [it is]{.mark} **too
weak** to meet its obligations to its allies]{.underline}, as it
prepares to assume command of NATO's crisis response force next year.

[Pressure on Berlin is mounting after a series of revelations has
exposed the German military as one of [the **least combat ready** in
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite its economic heft.

"[The readiness of the German military is **abysmal**]{.underline},"
said Jorge Benitez, a NATO expert with the Atlantic Council in
Washington. "[For years, [German leaders have known that]{.mark} major
elements of their armed forces, such as tanks, submarines and fighter
jets, are not fully operational and **can't be used** for actual
military missions]{.underline}."

[The military dysfunction is likely to re-emerge as a **flashpoint**
between Berlin and Washington]{.underline} when President Donald
[Trump]{.underline} attends a NATO summit in July.

Berlin's persistent shortcomings and resistance to meeting NATO spending
targets is [[**likely** to further **strain** relations with]{.mark}
Washington and risks a standoff that could eventually test the unity of
the alliance and the American commitment to it]{.underline}.

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, long ambivalent about the value of NATO,
[remains fixated on Germany as a **security free-rider**]{.underline}:
The alliance "helps them a hell of a lot more than it helps us," Trump
said in December.

[New German capability gaps have been brought to light in recent weeks,
piling up on top of old ones that Berlin has failed to fix]{.underline}.

Among the failures: [[**none** of Germany's sub]{.mark}marine[s is
**operational**]{.mark}, only four of its 128 Eurofighter jets are
combat-ready and the army is short dozens of tanks and armored vehicles
needed for NATO missions]{.underline}.

In addition, [[troops are **short** on the
**basics**]{.underline}]{.mark}: body armor, night vision gear and
cold-weather clothing.

[The situation is so dire that 19 helicopter pilots from Germany's
Bundeswehr were forced to turn in their flight licenses because of a
lack of training time]{.underline}.

The reason: [not enough helicopters for the pilots to fly]{.underline}.

A low priority Internal military documents and investigations by German
media have cast a spotlight on [Berlin's failure to reverse the steady
slide in combat readiness, which comes as concerns about a more
aggressive Russia increase demand for more agile NATO
militaries]{.underline}.

Yet [there is [**little sign** that]{.mark} Germany's political
[leadership will do much]{.mark}, with parliament [locked in
**partisan**]{.mark} budget **[disputes]{.mark}** about defense
spending]{.underline}.

On Monday, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen said she expected
military spending to reach 1.5 percent of economic output in 2025, which
means that short of a dramatic change, [[Berlin will **renege**
on]{.mark} a pledge it made to the U.S. and NATO allies in 2014 when
members agreed to hit the [2 percent]{.mark} mark within a
decade]{.underline}.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union has
historically been the mainstream party that advocates for stronger
defense spending. On Monday, Merkel conceded [[German]{.mark}
"**[credibility]{.mark}**" was **[at stake]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
that defense expenditures must increase.

Yet Merkel also vowed during last year's election campaign that
[spending on Germany's **[welfare]{.mark}** state]{.underline} ---
including a national pension plan, public health care and nursing care,
generous unemployment benefits, social welfare and education --- [would
continue to [**take precedence** over]{.mark} the increased
[military]{.mark} expenditure demanded by Trump]{.underline}.

Von der Leyen is requesting a \$14 billion [[boost]{.mark} over current
budget plans]{.underline}. The request [[is facing
**resistance**]{.underline}]{.mark} from Germany's finance ministry,
which has planned a roughly \$6.6 billion increase over four years.

Von der Leyen's office called the current plan "inadequate in view of
the huge accumulated needs and required modernization, particularly in
the medium term."

While Germany has slowly increased its defense spending in recent years,
the \$37 billion budget is only about 1.24 percent of its GDP.

"[[Germany]{.mark} has the largest economy in Europe, but [has been
dragging its feet on fixing]{.mark} its **scandalous [defense]{.mark}
problems**]{.underline}," Benitez said. "[Part of the problem is
political and [reflects]{.mark} the [willingness]{.mark} of German
leaders [to]{.mark} consistently [inhibit]{.mark} defense
[spending]{.mark} for the sake of other priorities]{.underline}."

[One obstacle to boosting defense spending could be [Trump]{.mark}
himself. The U.S. president [is deeply unpopular]{.mark} in Germany and
[appearing to **kowtow**]{.mark} to Trump's demands in the form of
ramping up military investment could be **[politically
damaging]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In August, Germany's foreign minister at the time, Sigmar Gabriel,
[[equated]{.mark} answering Trump's spending demands [with]{.mark}
"kneeling" in **[submission]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Little demand for a better force]{.underline}

[Another aspect of the country's reluctance to ramp up military
investment is a **[broad]{.mark} cultural [discomfort]{.mark}** [with
the idea of trying to re-establish]{.mark} itself as a military
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}, which conjures memories of Germany's
defeats in two world wars.

Once home to some of the world's most sophisticated military thinkers---
19th century Prussian Gen. Carl von Clausewitz is still required reading
for every American general --- the Germany of today tends toward
pacifism.

A recent survey in Germany by the Pew Research Center found that 51
percent of those polled want defense spending to hold steady, while 13
percent want cuts. Only 32 percent want to increase spending.

[There are also **[bureaucratic obstacles]{.mark}** to increasing
military expenditures. The Germany defense budget is the only part of
the government where any expenditure of over 25 million euros, or about
\$30 million, requires parliamentary approval. Bureaucratic **logjams**
also have [hindered]{.mark} defense [procurement]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In early 2019, Germany is slated to lead NATO's Very High Readiness
Joint Task Force, a 5,000-strong unit designed to deploy within days to
potential hotspots in Eastern Europe.

Responsibility for leading the task force rotates among alliance
members.

German defense ministry documents, obtained by the German Die Welt
newspaper, revealed that the brigade slated to deploy on the NATO
mission only has nine of the 44 Leopard 2 tanks and three of the 14
Marder armored personnel carriers that are required.

German defense officials have said they are working to address the
shortfalls and said the unit will be ready to lead the NATO task force.
But the military's problems run deeper than manning one brigade for a
single NATO mission.

"[The army's [readiness]{.mark} to deploy has not improved in recent
years, but [instead has gotten]{.mark} **even
[worse]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Parliamentary Armed Forces Commissioner
Hans-Peter Bartels said in February upon release of an annual report on
the state of the armed forces.

GÖRLITZ, Germany---When the Cold War ended, [European governments
**[slashed]{.mark}** their [military budgets]{.mark}]{.underline} and
spent a windfall of several trillion dollars on social programs---[a
**[popular]{.mark}** policy [with voters]{.mark}]{.underline} when
Europe faced few external threats and enjoyed the security protection of
the U.S.

Now, [European [nations]{.mark} are finding it **difficult** to give up
those peacetime benefits]{.underline}, even as the war in Ukraine has
revived Cold War-era tensions and the U.S. tries to shift its focus to
China. [Most are [**failing** to get their armies in]{.mark} fighting
[shape]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The lesson: It was easy to swap guns for butter; reversing the trend is
far more challenging.

That means---despite promises to raise military spending---defense
ministers say they are struggling to get what they need. [In
**[German]{.mark}**y]{.underline}, Europe's largest economy, [[military
bases are crumbling or have been converted to **civilian use**]{.mark},
including sports centers, old people's homes and pension fund offices.
The **army**]{.underline}, which numbered half a million in West Germany
and 300,000 in East Germany during the Cold War, [has today just
**180,000**. It now has a few hundred operational tanks]{.underline},
compared with more than 2,000 Leopard 2 main battle tanks its West
German predecessor had in the late 1980s.

"That's frustrating to me," German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told
journalists recently, after getting much less than he had requested for
next year's military spending. "It means [there are certain **things I
can't do** at the pace that...the level of threat
requires]{.underline}."

[It is also likely to **[frustrate U.S.]{.mark} hopes** that Europe will
finally begin relieving some of the burden from Washington]{.underline},
which accounts for two-thirds of military spending among North Atlantic
Treaty Organization allies. Both U.S. presidential candidates have said
they want Europe to shoulder more of its security costs.

If Donald Trump wins in November, the call for Europe to do so would
likely grow louder. Trump said in February the U.S. wouldn't defend
allies that don't meet NATO's minimum target of spending 2% of gross
domestic product on their militaries, saying Russia could "do whatever
the hell they want" with those that missed the target. In recent days,
he said allies should be spending 3%---matching U.S. levels.

Few European nations, with the exception of Poland or the Baltic states,
are close to spending 3% of GDP on their militaries. The U.K. had vowed,
under the previous Conservative government, to raise military spending
to 2.5% of GDP by 2030 from about 2.3%. But new Prime Minister Keir
Starmer has refused to put a date on it. Military spending in Italy and
Spain, meanwhile, sits under 1.5%.

[At the current pace of rearmament, [it would take Germany **100 years**
to return its]{.mark} artillery howitzer [stockpiles]{.mark} to their
**2004 levels**]{.underline}, according to a report published earlier
this month by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, an independent
think tank.

Guns vs. butter

During negotiations for Germany's 2025 budget earlier this year,
[Finance Minister]{.underline} Christian Lindner [wanted to free up
[money for defense]{.mark} by **freezing social spending** for three
years]{.underline}---letting it lag inflation. [The move [was
**rebuffed** by other parties]{.mark} in the governing
coalition]{.underline}, and the underlying defense budget was increased
by just 1.2 billion euros, equivalent to around \$1.3 billion, compared
with 2024---just enough to cover the latest pay hike for military
personnel. Spending on military aid for Ukraine was cut to €4 billion,
about half this year's level.

What the coalition parties did agree on was a €108-a-year increase over
two years in Kindergeld---an annual €3,000 payment per child to all
families, regardless of income. Today, that benefit alone, payable for
offspring up to age 25, costs more than €50 billion a year, as much as
Berlin's annual Defense Ministry budget.

"[**The idea**---we are dismantling the welfare state because we need
more money for the military---**I would find fatal**]{.underline}," said
Economic Affairs Minister Robert Habeck.

The Polish town of Zgorzelec, seen across the border from Görlitz,
Germany. Zgorzelec was the eastern part of Görlitz until Soviet forces
redrew the border in 1945.

Habeck argued that [[Germany]{.mark} not only [faced]{.mark} an
**external** threat from **Russia**, but an **internal** threat from
[people getting disillusioned with
**democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}---a jab at the ascendant far-right
AfD party.

"[Social spending is necessary to keep the country
together]{.underline}," said Habeck.

In the mid-1980s, West German military spending stood at around 3% of
GDP and over 5% in East Germany. In 2022, the now-unified country spent
around 1.4%. As a result, the country saved a total of €680 billion that
was put toward rebuilding the formerly communist East and extending the
welfare state there, according to Ifo, a Munich think tank. Europe as a
whole has saved about €1.8 trillion since 1991 by spending less than 2%
of GDP on its armed forces, Ifo calculates.

The meticulously restored town of Görlitz in Germany's far southeast, a
setting for Hollywood movies such as "The Grand Budapest Hotel" and
"Inglourious Basterds," shows the fruits of the country's peace
dividend.

In baroque town squares, pensioners sip flat whites. Students study free
of charge at an airy, revamped university campus overlooking the river.
The train station is being refurbished, a central square remodeled and
the local hospital is building a new wing for the elderly.

The town also shows why [[politicians are **leery** of swapping butter
for guns]{.underline}]{.mark}, economists' term for the trade-offs
states must make when choosing between military and social spending.
[With an **elderly population** and **weak economy**]{.underline}, the
city receives the second highest regional transfers of taxpayer money in
the form of subsidies and welfare benefits of any German district. Even
so, spending pledges by the central government are straining the
resources of Görlitz, which shoulders some of the costs, including
support for children, said district administrator Stephan Meyer.

The district received a €40 million bailout late last year from the
state government to cover a budget deficit. Meyer said he expects the
gap between revenues and expenditures to grow to around €100 million by
2028.

"[**Everybody understands** that we are at a very special juncture. [The
question is where will the money **come from**]{.mark}]{.underline},"
said Christian Mölling, a defense expert and director of the Europe
program at the Bertelsmann Foundation in Berlin.

The turning point

Days after Russian President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion of
Ukraine in 2022, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised a "Zeitenwende,"
or turning point. He pledged Berlin would raise military spending above
2% of GDP, and unveiled a special €100 billion off-budget investment
fund for rearmament. Military experts welcomed the move, but warned [the
**2%** threshold **wasn't enough** to strengthen the military quickly
given Germany's chronic underspending]{.underline}.

Two years later, however, Germany's underlying defense budget sits at
1.3% of GDP, and overall military spending is only meeting the 2%
threshold thanks to the off-budget investment fund. [When that runs out
in **2028**, [Germany]{.mark} will have [to hike its]{.mark} underlying
[defense budget]{.mark} by **60%** that year to keep it above 2%---which
analysts say [is **unlikely**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Not including the special fund, [the share of the underlying defense
**budget** that goes into procuring new weapons and ammunition **has
fallen** from €10 billion in 2022 to €3 billion this year]{.underline},
according to Hans-Peter Bartels, president of the German Society for
Security Policy, an armed forces lobby organization. The rest goes
mainly to personnel, maintenance, training and building costs.

"[The **Zeitenwende** has **failed**]{.underline}," said Benjamin
Tallis, a senior fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations,
calling [the effort to [rearm Germany "too little, too slow, too
uncertain]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Görlitz receives the second highest regional transfers of taxpayer money
in the form of subsidies and welfare benefits of any German district.

The country's public social safety net, meanwhile, totaled €1.25
trillion last year, an eye-popping 27% of GDP---higher than Denmark and
Sweden and compared with around 23% for the U.S. in 2022, according to
data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

[Government officials counter by pointing to the rearmament fund and say
[**strict budget rules** mean Germany can't borrow to spend more]{.mark}
and [**cutting welfare** risks]{.mark} endangering public [support for
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Unpopular with voters

Economists say there are many welfare measures that could be pared back
to beef up military spending. A heavily subsidized €49-a-month ticket
that gives access to public transport and regional trains nationwide
costs the state €3 billion a year. Another €5 billion goes for training
the unemployed despite an economy that is close to full employment, says
Moritz Schularick, president of the Kiel Institute.

States such as Saxony, where Görlitz is located, offer additional perks,
such as tens of thousands of dollars in subsidies for families who want
to purchase their first home, and subsidized vacations for low-income
families.

[Raising Germany's military spending to 3% of GDP would require finding
an extra €40 billion a year, equivalent to **France's entire** annual
defense **budget**. A study by Mölling and colleagues published this
month estimates that [**plugging** the gap in Germany's defenses]{.mark}
by 2030 [would cost €**103 billion**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[I'm not sure \[cutting welfare spending\] is the
solution]{.underline}," said Michael Kretschmer, the conservative
governor of Saxony, where Görlitz is located, saying the country needs
to spend more on defense, but also on schools, infrastructures, and
other items. "[I think what [we need]{.mark} is [an economy that
**grows** faster]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[The far-right **[AfD]{.mark}** party has [performed well]{.mark} in
state elections in East Germany, in part [by **opposing**]{.mark} more
military [spending]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Upstart political parties, such as the AfD, have been **betting** that
[there is **little appetite** among the public for increasing military
spending]{.mark}]{.underline}. The party won the eastern German state of
Thuringia and almost won in Saxony state elections on Sept. 1---in part
by pledging new benefits such as free school meals, while promising to
seek reductions in military spending.

"Ukraine and refugees are more important than school food?" said Mike
Moncsek, an AfD member of the German Parliament from Saxony.

The new far left BSW party also scored well in the election by promising
butter over guns. "[We don't want to prepare for war, we want to
**prepare for peace**]{.underline}," said Zaklin Nastic, the party's
defense policy expert in parliament. "[And above all, we need to
**preserve social peace** here in Germany]{.underline}."

Meanwhile, [[military projects]{.mark} have [faced local
opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Last summer, not far from Görlitz,
[**hundreds of protesters and local politicians** from the far right and
far left protested close to a disused air base]{.underline} where
Manfred von Richthofen, the World War I flying ace known as the Red
Baron, once trained.

[The protesters wanted to **block** the country's leading arms
**manufacturer**, Rheinmetall, from building a new ammunition factory on
the site that would supply Ukraine and restock German **stockpiles**.
Many [feared]{.mark} the factory [could become a **target** of
Russia]{.mark}. Within weeks, the company said it would add capacity to
an existing plant in **Bavaria** instead]{.underline}.

North of the city lies one of [the largest military **training grounds**
in Germany]{.underline}. Görlitz Mayor Octavian [Ursu would like to
expand the facility, but local [politicians are opposing]{.mark} the
move]{.underline}.

"[Residents complain that **too much** is being done for
**Ukraine**]{.underline}," Ursu said.

[Calls to 'anchor the **Zeitenwende at home**']{.underline}

[[Germany has a **constitutional prohibition** of high deficits]{.mark},
meaning higher defence [spending would **have to** come from]{.mark}
politically sensitive [social programmes]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Social Democrats]{.underline}, like Cremer, [are **against**
that]{.underline}.

"I think it would be a mistake to try to play off Zeitenwende against
social security," he said. "[We can only anchor the Zeitenwende at home
and create a resilient society if we understand security
**holistically** -- we need to think of investments in defence as
intrinsically linked to investments in infrastructure, which is falling
apart, and in social security]{.underline}."

Schlaga thought otherwise. "[As long as we are told by politicians that
whatever we need to do, this will not affect our social spending, we are
on the **wrong path**]{.underline}."

[These [**disagreements** are emblematic]{.mark} of the fundamental
choices Germans are facing]{.underline} for the first time in their
post-war history. They have been swaddled in NATO, an organisation
created in 1949 to protect Germany, whose [[army]{.underline}]{.mark}
had been disbanded even as the country lay dissected by the Iron
Curtain.

"The [Bundeswehr]{.underline} was always integrated within NATO. [It was
never to operate on its own throughout the Cold War. It
**[never]{.mark}** would have been [fully functional as a
**stand-alone**]{.mark} force]{.underline}," said Graf.

[That has [led to **reliance**]{.mark} on US strategic
direction]{.underline}.

"[[Germans are **very risk averse**]{.mark}. That will really be the
litmus test for the coming years -- whether the Germans will finally
[accept the role of leader]{.mark}. And **[I don't think they
will]{.mark}**]{.underline}," said Graf.

"[I [don't think that this change will come **quickly** enough]{.mark}
considering the challenges we're facing. [Other countries]{.mark} ...
the Baltic states, they should [provide Germany with]{.mark} the
strategic **[guidance]{.mark}** it would otherwise lack]{.underline}."

Tallis agreed that [events were overtaking Germans' capacity to change
their mindset, and **other** NATO **allies** like [France]{.mark} or the
[UK]{.mark} may end up [taking a leadership role]{.mark} among Nordic
and Baltic states and in Eastern Europe]{.underline}, where concern over
security is immediate.

"[\[[The Baltics\] are moving on]{.mark} and they're saying, 'regardless
of what you do, we are going forward, [we're setting the
pace]{.mark}']{.underline}," he said. "[The big message to Berlin is,

If only. Just hours after German Chancellor Olaf Scholz cleared the way
for the export of German-made tanks to the country, the focus shifted to
the who, what, where and when of supplying fighter jets to Ukraine. Once
again, Scholz was the first to slam on the brakes, repeatedly warning in
recent days of the dangers of "escalation," while insisting that NATO
would not become directly involved in the conflict. If you feel like
you've seen this movie before, join the club.

There is a new wrinkle though. It turns out that an [even bigger
[fear]{.mark} for Scholz than escalation is [that NATO, and]{.mark} in
particular [the U.S., wouldn't get involved if Russia were to retaliate
against]{.mark}, say [Germany]{.mark}. That worry]{.underline} ---
according to an adviser to the German government --- is the reason that
Scholz insisted that Washington agree to supply Ukraine with M1 Abrams
tanks before the chancellor would lift his veto on delivering
German-made Leopard 2 tanks.

What's an article worth? While the NATO treaty's [[Article
5]{.underline}]{.mark} calls on alliance members to support one another
in the event of an attack, it [[doesn't require]{.mark} allies to
respond with military [force]{.mark}. "If the U.S. is involved directly
it's more likely to use military force to defend its allies in
Europe,"]{.underline} Carlo Masala, a German military expert with strong
ties to the country's political establishment, said this week on German
public television. "That's a very strong rationale for Scholz and why he
insists that the U.S. is involved."

In other words, [[Scholz doesn't trust the U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Given that Washington has about 40,000 troops in Germany and has already
committed roughly \$30 billion in military aid to Ukraine (more than 10
times the German total), one might reasonably question the logic
underlying Scholz's argument.

### Germany CP\-\--Say No\-\--Public\-\--Ext

But [all this **talk of militarization** --- of [Germany]{.mark} once
again [rising as Europe's]{.mark} **strongest [power]{.mark}** ---
[and]{.mark} especially of [using **debt** to pay for it]{.mark}, [is
causing]{.mark} **serious [consternation]{.mark}** including
[among]{.mark} some officials in **[Merz]{.mark}'s governing
coalition**, who worry **[things are going too
far]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To accommodate the military push, Germany's
parliament in March approved a constitutional amendment to relax the
country's strict debt brake and created a \$585 billion special fund.

Some of the gravest misgivings are among prominent members of the
center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a junior partner to Merz's
Christian Democrats in the government. [Several prominent
Social]{.underline} Democrats this month signed a controversial
manifesto [declaring that there was "[**no** security]{.mark} policy
[**justification** for]{.mark} a fixed annual [increase in the defense
budget]{.mark}]{.underline} to 3.5 or 5 percent of gross domestic
product."

"[Military **alarm [rhetoric]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} massive
**[rearmament]{.mark}** programs [do not create greater security for
Germany]{.mark} and Europe, [but]{.mark} rather [lead to
**destabilization** and strengthening of]{.mark} the [**mutual threat**
perception]{.mark} between NATO and Russia]{.underline}," the manifesto
declared.

Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, a Social Democrat and architect of the
military ramp-up, denounced the "peace circles" rebellion in his own
party as a "denial of reality." Merz has insisted the coalition is
unified in its defense of Ukraine.

Stefan Meister, a senior political scientist at the German Council on
Foreign Relations, said some spheres of German society still confuse
modern-day Russia with the former Soviet Union --- a misconception
rooted in historical memory and national identity.

"[[It's always about **history**]{.mark}, it's always about
[guilt]{.mark} in **World War II** [and thankfulness]{.mark} with the
**German unification**]{.underline}," Meister said, pointing to the
lingering gratitude toward the former Soviet Union for its role in
defeating Nazi Germany and the close ties to Russia in eastern Germany.

"[[They]{.mark} just [will **not understand** \[the Russian
threat\]]{.mark} because they're **projecting** their own history and
the past onto the present and the future]{.underline}," Meister said,
adding that [[disarmament and reeducation]{.mark} of Germans after World
War II also [made]{.mark} segments of [society **more pacifist**]{.mark}
than other neighboring European powers]{.underline}.

[In any case, the buildup **won't come easily**. One of the greatest
challenges will be recruitment to a [military]{.mark} that [is not
held]{.mark} universally [in **high esteem** in German
society]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pistorius has said Germany needs up to
60,000 more active troops, and Carsten Breuer, the German army's
inspector general, sees need for 100,000 more reservists by the end of
the decade.

The German armed forces, the Bundeswehr, now has about 182,000 troops.

As a result, leading German politicians have begun speaking seriously
about the potential need for a return to conscription and compulsory
service.

Conscription was a cornerstone of Germany's postwar defense, introduced
in 1956 during the Cold War. German men were required to serve six
months in the military or opt for civilian service. But shrinking
defense budgets and changing threat perceptions led compulsory service
to be suspended in 2011, under Chancellor Angela Merkel.

[Reinstituting [conscription]{.mark} would [mark]{.mark} a **significant
reversal** after more than a decade of an all-volunteer force. **Public
opinion** is mixed, with]{.underline} polls showing rising support for
some form of compulsory service, particularly among older generations,
but [[skepticism among the young]{.underline}]{.mark}.

At its party conference in May, Merz's Christian Democratic Union voted
for a gradual return to conscription. Pistorius told the German
broadcaster ARD on Sunday that he was preparing legislation to boost
military service, including provisions to reintroduce a draft if
voluntary recruitment falls short of targets.

The Social Democrats, however, are warier.

"We don't categorically rule out the reintroduction of conscription,"
Falko Drossmann, the party's defense policy spokesman in parliament,
told German daily Tagesspiegel last week. "But [the [SPD will **not
agree**]{.mark} to such a serious intervention in the life plans of this
country's young men [until everything has been done]{.mark} to create a
more attractive military force that we don't have to force people
into]{.underline}."

The left-wing Die Linke, a traditionally pacifist party, accused
Pistorius of breaking his word on military service.

"He and his party assured Germany's children and young people that
military service would remain voluntary under this government; this is
even stated in the coalition agreement," Left Party lawmaker Desiree
Becker said last week. "Now, however, Boris Pistorius wants to initiate
compulsory military service and is rightly encountering resistance not
only from us, but also within his own party."

"[[Military]{.mark} service [is **always associated** with
violence]{.mark}, and obliging our young people to do so is **by no
means the solution**]{.underline}," Becker added.

The German Greens also argue that a modern, professional military should
be built through voluntary enlistment, not coercion.

Merz said Monday at an event for a German industry association that
building up the number of troops "probably" would not happen on a
voluntary basis alone. "Money is not the key problem we have for the
Bundeswehr," he said. "[The [**key** problem is]{.mark} **qualified
[personnel]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

In an effort to boost [enthusiasm for the
**[military]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Germany celebrated its first
official nationwide Veterans Day last week. Merz marked the occasion
with a statement on X declaring: "Service to our country belongs at the
heart of our society."

But the event [[attracted **protests**]{.underline}]{.mark}, including a
fake ad campaign for the Bundeswehr [inviting would-be recruits to "hang
out with **Nazi preppers**]{.underline}," a reference to scandals
involving far-right extremists.

Merz has said he wants to make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional
military force in Europe. Already, it is making its presence felt on the
continent.

Last month, Merz traveled to Lithuania to celebrate Germany's deployment
there of its first permanent military force on foreign soil since World
War II --- a brigade that is intended to grow to 5,000 troops. It is a
remarkable development for a country that last had a military presence
in Lithuania as occupiers more than eight decades ago.

"[For a very long time, the [German **mantra** was: Where German troops
have been, German troops should **never** be
again]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Claudia Major, a senior vice president
and international security expert in Berlin at the German Marshall Fund,
a policy institute that focuses on transatlantic affairs.

BERLIN --- When Chancellor Friedrich Merz visited the Oval Office
earlier this month, President Donald [Trump unwittingly channeled the
psyche of a [German public]{.mark} that is [deeply conflicted
over]{.mark} plans for a huge [increase in defense spending]{.mark} and
military capabilities]{.underline}.

"I think it's a good thing," Trump said of the giant ramp-up in military
spending, which he demanded from NATO allies. "But, you know, at least
to a certain point," Trump added. "There'll be a point when I'll say,
'Please don't arm anymore.'"

Facing Russia's continuing war in Ukraine and Trump's repeated
intimations that the United States can no longer be relied upon to
defend Europe, [[Merz]{.mark} has [led a]{.mark} broad [push to
rearm]{.mark}]{.underline} a country that for 80 years had been allergic
to anything resembling militarism, following the horrific destruction
Nazi Germany caused during World War II. [This includes not just plans
to [acquire **new**]{.mark}**, advanced [weapons]{.mark}** but also to
[increase]{.mark} the **[ranks]{.mark}** of the military by 60,000 and
potentially a [return to **conscription**]{.mark} of young people for
mandatory service]{.underline}.

At a summit in The Hague on Wednesday, NATO leaders formally approved a
plan to lift their annual military spending target to 5 percent of GDP.

For Germany, Europe's largest economy, that will mean a massive increase
--- to \$177 billion in 2029 from \$100 billion in 2025, to meet NATO's
target of 3.5 percent on "core" military expenditures like troops and
weapons, and the need for a further \$76 billion in related spending,
such as on upgrading roads and bridges to support armored convoys.

Taken together, [the increases will [mark]{.mark} the country's [**most
significant** rearmament initiative]{.mark} since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}.

[Following the 2022 invasion, the German government **announced**
a]{.underline} Zeitenwende, or turning point, in military policy.
Chancellor Scholz declared a [[**revitalization** of Germany's]{.mark}
warfighting [**posture** and **d**]{.mark}efense **[i]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[b]{.mark}**ase. His government [created a \$**100 billion** dollar
fund for modernizing]{.mark} the military -- even [changing the
**constitution**]{.mark} in the process. Subsequently, it initiated an
effort to [invest in "key"]{.mark} defensive **[tech]{.mark}**nologies,
committed to [stationing]{.mark} a **brigade** [in Lithuania]{.mark},
and explored the possibility of [expanding]{.mark} the [armed
**forces**]{.mark} from 180,000 to 200,000]{.underline}.

But despite these lofty aspirations, [the German government's turning
point has largely [consisted of **spinning its wheels**]{.mark}. The
\$100 billion [fund will be spent]{.mark} in two to three years [with
no]{.mark} additional [funds having been allocated]{.mark}. This [lack
of]{.mark} **long-term [planning]{.mark}** has [hampered]{.mark}
industrial and private sector [efforts to increase]{.mark} the country's
defensive [production capacity]{.mark}. Beyond this, the agreed-to
[brigade]{.mark} in Lithuania [remains unfunded]{.mark}]{.underline},
although Lithuania has begun work on the required construction.
Similarly, [without dramatic increases in funding, Germany's substantial
[aid to Ukraine has **hollowed** its own]{.mark} defensive
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to a report by the Kiel
Institute for the World Economy, [it would take Germany **one hundred
years** to return to 2004 levels of **military readiness** at current
levels of funding]{.underline}.

[[Germany's]{.mark} **stance matters** in economic, industrial and
political terms]{.underline} because it has the European Union's biggest
budget, one of its largest defence industries and a powerful voice in
consensual decisions.

But critics say [it is [**refusing** to deploy]{.mark} these [strengths
and]{.mark}, worse, [has used them to **hold back** others]{.mark} more
enthusiastic than itself]{.underline}.

The Kiel Institute for the World Economy, which tracks aid to Ukraine,
says Germany has spent a total of 14.6 billion euros (\$15.85bn) on aid
to the war-torn country, putting it in second place globally after the
United States in nominal dollar terms.

But in terms of expenditure as a proportion of the economy, [[Germany
ranks **15th** in the Western military alliance]{.mark}, well behind
smaller economies such as Estonia (first), Denmark (second), Lithuania
(third), Latvia (fourth) and Finland (fifth), all of whom have
cumulatively spent about 1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) on
Ukraine]{.underline}.

Estonia and Latvia have this year committed to spending 0.25 percent of
their GDP per year on Ukraine for the foreseeable future. If Germany had
spent at Estonia's level since the Zeitenwende speech -- 1.6 percent of
GDP -- its cumulative expenditure on Ukraine would now have reached 70
billion euros (\$76bn).

Caution, cover and hedging

[[Germany]{.mark} has [earned its **foot-dragging reputation** since it
has not been the **first to move** on]{.mark} any significant new
armament to [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[It **opposed**]{.mark} the [deployment]{.mark} of European heavy
armour]{.underline} when the Czech Republic and Poland sent their
Soviet-era T-72s to Ukraine in March and April 2022, respectively. The
US had to send High Mobility Army Rocket Systems (HIMARS) in May 2022
for Germany to agree to send its equivalent MARS II.

The United Kingdom had to commit Challenger 2 tanks and the US M1 Abrams
tanks in January last year for Germany to agree to allow NATO allies to
export German-made Leopard tanks to Ukraine.

Last month, Germany backed Dutch former premier Mark Rutte as NATO
secretary-general over Estonian premier Kaja Kallas, an example of the
rift its caution has opened with Baltic and Nordic states concerned for
their own security should Ukraine fall.

But [[Germany]{.mark}'s strategic posture toward Russia [continues to
**hedge**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scholz has refused to deliver
much-needed Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine and previously stalled on
supplying Leopard tanks and other higher-end weapons. [Scholz's aim to
be a "peace chancellor" appears admirable, but it seems [**ill-suited**
to]{.mark} an ongoing war in which either [Ukraine]{.mark} and the West
will prevail---or Russia swallows Ukraine and prepares for the **next
stage** of its war. If [this is]{.mark} European leadership, it is
[leadership **without** a goal or strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[A]{.underline} third [**model** of [leadership is emerging in
Poland]{.mark}, where a new government has [combined]{.mark} **strong
[rhetoric]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **vast
[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Five years ago, then-European Council
President Donald Tusk linked the future of Ukraine with the future of
Europe in a speech at the Ukrainian Rada. Since becoming Polish prime
minister last year, he [has been **very [clear]{.mark}** [about Europe
needing to adopt a]{.mark} **prewar [posture]{.mark}** as it prepares
for further attempts by the Kremlin to reestablish its former
empire]{.underline}. Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has been
similarly clear in arguing for Europe's long-term rearmament. He also
warned Russia that it "is not we, the West, who should fear a clash with
Putin, but the other way around."

Sikorski has also floated innovative policy proposals, such as [the
creation of an all-volunteer **European Legion**]{.underline}, 5,000
soldiers strong. This force would be authorized for missions by
consensus within the European Council and operationally controlled by a
European commander. It would be mobilized outside the national military
channels and financed out of the EU budget. Most importantly, it [would
be deployable on high-risk missions]{.underline}, such as countering
Russia's Wagner Group in Africa, counterterrorism missions in the Sahel,
or stability operations in Libya---[[**bridging** the interests
of]{.mark} Southern and Central European [EU
members]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Warsaw is putting its **money where its mouth is**]{.mark}, launching
a major rearmament that will [make Poland]{.mark} one of [Europe's
leading **military power**]{.mark}s. It already spends more than 4
percent of GDP on defense and is expanding its already formidable force.
In 2023, the Polish defense budget increased by 75 percent over the
previous year---by far the **largest** annual **increase** of any
European state. Warsaw plans to **double** its land **forces** to
300,000 troops. With major defense orders from the United States and
South Korea, as well as **expanding** domestic **production**, Poland is
[on track]{.mark} by some estimates [to have more]{.mark} tanks [than
Britain, France, Italy, and Germany **combined**]{.mark} **by
2030**]{.underline}. Just last week, the Pentagon confirmed that Poland
will acquire \$2 billion worth of F-35 stealth fighters, Patriot missile
systems, and additional Abrams tanks.

Warsaw has also allocated 0.7 percent of its GDP to Ukraine, including 3
billion euros (\$3.3 billion) in military aid, and has spent more than
22 billion euros (\$24 billion) on the roughly 1 million Ukrainian
refugees that the country has taken in.

[[Poland has a **clear, actionable** vision]{.mark} of the need to
prevent Russia from conquering Ukraine and deter it from further wars.
[This is **leadership**]{.mark} **by necessity**]{.underline}.

Who will [[other EU countries **rally around**]{.underline}]{.mark}?
Some European leaders and citizens recognize the Russian threat but are
unwilling to make the tough choice to shift resources from social
spending to defense, not to mention putting their societies and
economies on a prewar footing. Others may be attracted by the approach
of speaking softly while slowly, incrementally arming up. But [the
necessity of Europe's circumstances---with an aggressive Russian regime
bent on changing borders and already fighting an indefinite European
war---will likely compel the EU to **gravitate toward
[Warsaw]{.mark}**'s approach]{.underline}.

High-end defense

[Europe can **produce** just about **anything**]{.underline}, but within
its borders, [[Germany is]{.mark} country **[leading]{.mark}** land
warfare [production. It has an **unrivalled advantage**]{.mark} when it
comes to putting its money where its mouth is: it has [Europe's

vehicle to Poland, the Scandinavian countries, and beyond, [Germany

upgrades]{.underline} for Leopard 2 tanks, enhancing both protection and
firepower to meet the latest standards. Above all, [the German industry

just recently re-signed four of the most high-tech versions]{.underline}
of the Leopard 2, the 105 A8-standard to equip a future German brigade

significant development involves Germany and Canada, with [plans for
Canada to urgently acquire German artillery systems]{.underline} to
support its Enhanced-Forward Presence (eFP) Battle Group in Latvia. A
contract is already advancing for the initial delivery, paving the way
for a larger, long-term agreement under the Indirect Fire Modernization

stance]{.mark} as it strives [to **cement**]{.mark} its position as

Today, [Germany produces some of the world's most high-performance,

warfare. This promises to be a heavy, mechanized, armored, tracked form
of warfare, in which the latest technological solutions are designed to
cope with new threats such as drones and electronic warfare. [These
employment conditions create a wide avenue for Germany's cutting-edge
industrial traditions to flourish, as it seeks to establish a **new

[[I]{.mark}ndian [O]{.mark}cean has been a vital strategic trade
route]{.underline} since the early medieval period, but was
substantially exercised by the Europeans in the 16 to 19th century to
gain an economic and political foothold within the region. During the
Cold War, India's non-aligned foreign policy enacted by Prime Minister
Nehru effectively dismantled the permanent shadow of superpower presence
in the Indian Ocean. However, attempt to contain China's 'peaceful' rise
and eager stare towards the Indian Ocean signifies warning signs for
Indian diplomacy and security. The unfolding events and environment seem
to validate the statement by David Kaplan that "the Indian Ocean could
be the 21st century playing field for the major powers." The shadow of
the Cold War in India's backyard could be inevitable if New Delhi fails
to respond effectively to both Beijing and Washington. Under Prime
Minister Modi's direction, the foreign ministry's articulation of
foreign policy has the solid mind-set of "the Indian Ocean is India's
Ocean". Modi's visits to the Indian Ocean Islands can be seen in this
regard, with the world closely monitoring the diplomatic engagements of
the tour; from the renewed relationships within the Indian diasporas to
Modi's dress code, to the broad range of military and civilian
assistance being offered to the strategically significant islands to
veer Chinese influence from the Islands' current security embrace.
Cancelling his visit to the Maldives during his Indian Ocean tour, the
Prime Minister citied political turmoil and arrest of opposition leader
and former President Mohammed Rasheed as the main consideration. With
mounting speculation of the Male governments' intentions to prohibit
Nasheed from participating in the next general election, along with
Nasheeds vocalized criticism of Chinese influence in the region, India's
response was discouraging. With the long term objective of decreasing
Chinese Naval presence in the region, New Delhi's non-interference and
non-intervention in the Maldives political situation is an appropriate,
rationale and safe long term strategy, however over-looking and
neglecting the issue entirely is a disappointing strategy to employ. The
potential forge of political tensions is exacerbated by the
controversial Maldiven President Abdullah Yameen's strategic trajectory
toward China and the growing influence via the recently ratified law
that allows foreign ownership of land. In a speech Yameen reassured
intentions of maintaining the Indian Oceans demilitarized status;
however, concerns mount in New Delhi as the move attracts significant
commercial expansion from Beijing, with the inevitability of a Chinese
naval presence following to protect economic interests. At the moment it
is unclear exactly how much this will impact Modi's policy, but
[rhetoric grows surrounding]{.underline} the Indian Ocean Islands
becoming vital ground for [regional competition]{.underline} between the
two dominant Asian powers. Amidst the race for great power status, the
question rises of India's action towards China's influence and presence
in the Indian Ocean. [With]{.underline} [**decades of warm diplomatic**
relations between Modi and Beijing]{.underline} officials [coupled
with]{.underline} [the]{.underline} '**[all weather
friendship']{.underline}** [between China and Pakistan]{.underline}, the
Indian Ocean cannot solely remain India's Ocean. With China extending
diplomatic relations and financial assistance to smaller and more
distant islands, it is clear that Beijing does not intend to stop
flexing its political and economic muscles. Modi's current policies that
seek to renew regional engagement and provide a more stable security
role is proving effective, particularly as more Asian nations tilt from
the increasingly aggressive influence of China. As naval expansion
becomes the prominent strategy for Chinese containment, India's position
in the Indian Ocean is jeopardised by accusations of multi-lateral
Chinese alienation and isolation tactics; such as the Quadrilateral
Security Initiative. For New Delhi, this remains a contentious and
complex issue of balancing security engagements with Indo-Pacific
neighbours, as well as embracing China economically but simultaneously
attempting to restrain their maritime influence, creating a fragile
environment in the Indian Ocean. India's fears of permanent Chinese
expansion into the Indian Ocean have been validated with the \$20
billion dollar 'Maritime Silk Road' project announcement by Beijing.
With commercial and military infrastructures already a primary concern
for New Delhi, the project aims to fully expand into the Indian Ocean to
utilize the lucrative trade routes and protect Chinese commercial
interests and vital energy lines from Africa and the Gulf. This will
inevitably sharpen regional tensions as India continues to rapidly
modernize and expand its navy along with embarking on more naval
exercises with East and South Asian nations. As China and Pakistan's
relationship tightens; with Pakistan gaining more advanced military
hardware from China, China will gain complete access to Pakistan's
coastline and the peripheries of the Indian Ocean. New Delhi is greatly
aware of the growing significance that the Indian Ocean strategically
offers in international politics. Coupled with China's continued
attempts to gain hegemony within the region, Modi has made a decisive
break from New Delhi's decades-old foreign policy and ambivalence, to
the insistence that India becomes primarily responsible for ensuring
regional peace and stability. The reinvigoration of stagnant diplomatic
relationships and application of more ambitious strategic policies by
Modi, is building a foundation for India to regain the Indian Ocean
sphere of influence without relying on geographic advantage. The
multi-faceted relationship between Russia and India continues to ensure
the strategic vision for India's backyard. The second largest market for
sales for the Russian defence industry, India is also the only recipient
of Russian strategic weapons. New Delhi also continues to be held in
high regard within Moscow through a combination of history, political
relations, expansion of cooperation, and commonalities within global
policies and interest. Russia has noted the benefits India can provide
regionally and globally in becoming a strong military centre, and is
willing to support and supply New Delhi to ensure this rise of power and
influence. [As the Indo-Pacific region transcends to become a central
hub]{.underline} for global economics and strategy, Prime Minister Tony
Abbot and Prime Minister Narendra Modi are also developing and deepening
their already warm relationship to ensure regional stability. Both
[[nations aim to]{.underline}]{.mark} secure trade routes and
**[[reduce]{.mark} the [risk of]{.mark} regional
[destabilisation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [by
[supporting]{.mark}]{.underline} for **[[econ]{.mark}omic
[interdependence]{.mark}]{.underline}** between emerging and major
nations in the Indo-Pacific area. By [[building]{.mark} a solid
foundation of]{.underline} **[[shared values and

dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[the potential for]{.mark}

but [[is]{.underline} **[significantly lowered]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

#### No instability.

Ameya Pratap **Singh 20**, DPhil Student in South Asia at the University
of Oxford. "Why Another Sino-Indian War Is Unlikely", 6/1/2020,
https://thediplomat.com/2020/06/why-another-sino-indian-war-is-unlikely/

However, [contrary to **widespread fears**, another Sino-Indian [war is
**unlikely**]{.mark}]{.underline} to be in the offing. [[In]{.mark}
**the [shadow of nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**, a limited
conventional [war]{.mark}]{.underline} on the Sino-Indian border ---
somewhat akin to the month-long clash in 1962 -- [[can be
**avoided**]{.underline}]{.mark} for several reasons.

First, this is because of the nature of the dispute and the lack of
ideological fundamentalism and issue indivisibility. Unlike the United
States, which has increasingly begun to view the geopolitical
competition with China as a battle for values such as freedom of
navigation or democracy or the preservation of the liberal international
order, [India and China do not see each other through]{.underline} such
[**an ideological lens**. The authoritarian regime of the
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunity [P]{.underline}arty [is not
perceived to be **antithetical** to India's democratic
character]{.underline}, and vice versa. India's long-term strategy, as
former Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale puts it, is to retain its
strategic autonomy, and pursue alignments based "on issues, not
ideology."

Hence, while [both parties]{.underline} have been cautious of each
other's maneuvers on the border, they [have refrained from
linking]{.underline} these to **[existential attributes of national
identity]{.underline}**, which are notorious for inflating the
significance of disputed territories --- for example in the case of
Kashmir, Tibet, or Taiwan. In fact, Beijing has long held that the
border dispute is a remnant of British colonialism and its reckless
cartographic practices, rather than being driven by India's territorial
expansionism. On the Indian side, Army Chief General Manoj Mukund
Naravane, in a break from traditional bouts of recrimination between
adversaries, accepted that due to differing notions of the LAC, "both
sides" were guilty of aggressive behavior in Eastern Ladakh and North
Sikkim. This choice of words effectively yielded the use of any
victimhood narratives that could be mobilized to create moral
justification for retaliatory action.

Second, [the [risks of]{.mark} **inadvertent [pre-emption]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} nearly as
[[high]{.underline}]{.mark} as they were in 1962, when Nehru's ill-fated
"forward policy" was met by overwhelming Chinese military force. This is
because of a series of five [agreements signed between India and China
to address]{.underline} disputes arising over the LAC: 1) the [1993
Agreement]{.underline} on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along
the LAC; 2) the [1996 Agreement on
C]{.underline}onfidence-[B]{.underline}uilding
[M]{.underline}easure[s]{.underline} in the Military Field Along the
LAC, 3) [the 2005 Protocol]{.underline} on Modalities for the
Implementation of Confidence-Building Measures in the Military Field
Along the LAC; 4) [the 2012 Agreement]{.underline} on the Establishment
of a Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China
Border Affairs; [and]{.underline} 5) [the 2013 Border]{.underline}
Defense Cooperation [Agreement]{.underline}.

These [[agreements provide]{.mark} **a modus operandi** for **diplomatic
[engagement]{.mark}** [at]{.mark} **the [military and political
levels]{.mark}**, as well as **a set of ["s]{.mark}tatus [quo"]{.mark}
commitments** [both sides]{.mark} can [return to]{.mark} in case of
escalation. [They proved **effective** during]{.mark} the 16-day
stand-off between]{.underline} Indian and Chinese forces
[in]{.underline} eastern Ladakh near the village of [[Chumar]{.mark},
the military confrontation]{.underline} at Burtse in the Depsang plains
in northern [[Ladakh]{.mark} in 2015, [and]{.mark} the [Doklam]{.mark}
crisis in 2017]{.underline}.

Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Anurag Srivastava has
also affirmed New Delhi's intention to de-escalate the current stand-off
based on these agreements. He stated that "the two sides \[already\]
have established mechanisms to resolve such situations peacefully
through dialogue." Similarly, the Chinese official statement also
reiterated Beijing's commitment "to uphold peace and tranquility in
border areas." [**Summit [diplomacy]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} **likely [to
return]{.mark}** [if]{.mark} the [crisis escalates]{.mark}
further]{.underline}.

Third is [**the element of [ambiguity]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **the
["fog"]{.mark}** [**surround**]{.mark}ing the details of **the military
[stand-off]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Typically, analysts have viewed
"nationalist strongmen" as promoters of aggressive state behavior. But,
[in this case]{.underline}, the ability of [both
governments]{.underline} to control national media, and the
inscrutability of the facts related to the dispute, [aided efforts to
manage **domestic audience costs**]{.underline}. For instance, media
reports of 15-20 personnel of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police force being
detained by the Chinese were categorically refuted by the Indian side.
[This [meant]{.mark}]{.underline} that [**[no domestic pressure for
retal]{.mark}iation** arose [and **no**]{.mark} **great [reputational
damage]{.mark}** was suffered]{.underline}. In the aftermath of the
Doklam crisis, similar [[ambiguity allowed both]{.mark} sides [to
claim]{.mark} **tactical [victories]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
themselves [[and **diffuse**]{.mark} the situation
successfully]{.underline}. In India, criticism has been incrementally
rising with respect to the Modi government's lack of transparency on the
matter, but it is unlikely to reach electorally harmful proportions.

Lastly, [**the material [costs]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **limited
[war]{.mark}** for both parties **far [outweigh]{.mark}** potential
[gains]{.mark}]{.underline}. For [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, conflict
on the border with India [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} diminish its
ability to [[meet]{.underline}]{.mark} key security challenges in the
South China Sea, thus making it vulnerable to [the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
which Beijing considers its primary security competitor. [It seems
**unlikely**]{.underline} that [Beijing would]{.underline} want to [risk
**a two-front war**]{.underline}. Additionally, [[**reputational
damages** suffered due to **COVID**]{.mark}**-19**, **pre-existing
[fears]{.mark}** [surrounding]{.mark} China's [rise, and India's]{.mark}
**conventional and nuclear deterrence [capabilities]{.mark}** will all
[temper **Beijing's**]{.mark} **pre-emptive use of military
[force]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similarly, [for India, **the primary
security challenge** remains Pakistan]{.underline}-based terrorist
infiltration on the Kashmir border. More importantly, beyond the
protection of vital strategic points on either side that allow military
forces to effectively defend and patrol their territories in challenging
high-altitude mountainous regions, [the vast tracts of disputed
land]{.underline} along the LAC [do not hold **any important material
resources**]{.underline} such as oil, precious mineral reserves, or
ethnic-kin populations. [The benefits of **territorial aggrandizement**
are]{.underline} therefore, [limited to **deterrence
value**]{.underline} and [**the natural terrain** offers **few
advantages** to offensive forces]{.underline}.

### Germany CP\-\--AT: Impact\-\--Ukraine

#### Russia is [bluffing]{.underline}\-\--[no incentive]{.underline} to use nuclear weapons.

**Shedd '23** \[David; 2023; Former acting director of the U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency during the Obama administration; Foreign Policy;
"With Nuclear Threats, Putin Plays the West Like a Fiddle,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/09/06/putin-nuclear-war-ukraine-russia-biden-west-armageddon-psychology-influence-operations-disinformation-manipulation/\]

While Russia's nuclear threats make many Western policymakers
uncomfortable, [[Ukraine's]{.mark} [military]{.mark} intelligence
[chief]{.mark}]{.underline}, Kyrylo [Budanov, believes that Russia [is
**bluffing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[He is]{.underline}]{.mark} probably
**[[correct]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially [given the **very high
priority** given to **influence operations** in Russian
thinking]{.underline}. The Russian Defense Ministry website officially
states: "Information war is the confrontation between two or more states
in the information space ... a massive psychological manipulation of the
population to destabilize the state and society, as well as coercion of
the state to take decisions for the benefit of the opposing force."

Of course, we do not know what Putin is willing to do. CIA Director
William Burns said "potential desperation" could lead Putin to order the
use of tactical nuclear weapons. [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[has **no rational incentive** to use nukes]{.underline}]{.mark}.
First, in absence of outright victory, [[his main strategy]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **[settle]{.mark} in** [for]{.mark} a
**[protracted war]{.mark}**, either **exhausting** the West's **desire**
and **ability** to support Ukraine or **waiting** for the U.S. and other
elections to produce a **more Russia-friendly leader**]{.underline}, and
[a **nuclear standoff**]{.underline} could **[get in the
way]{.underline}** of that preferred outcome. Second,
[**[China]{.underline}** [and **India**]{.underline}]{.mark}---two
important partners on which Russia relies---appear to have [[**warned**
Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[**against** using nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. And third, [[any]{.mark} [radioactive
fallout]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
likely **[[float into Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** [given **short
distances** and the]{.underline} region's prevailing westerly
**[winds]{.underline}**.

Ukraine," The International Institute of Strategic Studies,
https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis//2022/10/russia-is-unlikely-to-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine)

Russian nuclear threats against Ukraine are not credible

The [[**fear** that Russia]{.mark} might [use]{.mark} 'tactical'
[nuclear weapons in Ukraine reflects]{.mark} a
**fundamental**]{.underline}, but completely understandable,
[[**misinterpretation** of]{.mark} what Putin has said]{.underline}
(attempting to deter direct Western intervention) [and [**how** Russia
**thinks**]{.mark} about nuclear weapons in war]{.underline}. While it
is tempting to believe that Russia's latest nuclear threats are directed
against Ukraine, it is worth noting that, on the one hand,
[[Russia]{.mark} has **annexed territory** it does not currently hold,
and]{.underline} on the other, [Putin has [**refrained** from]{.mark}
**issuing a direct** [nuclear threat]{.mark} to Ukraine if it did not
take up his **offer for talks**]{.underline}. Rather, [his
**[messaging]{.mark}** was [**intended** to]{.mark} push the West to
**[coerce]{.mark}** Ukraine into **[negotiations]{.mark}** and to
**freeze the battlefield**]{.underline} as it is now, which would give
Russia time and space to reconstitute its land forces. If Russia's
threat against Ukraine had been serious, surely the raid on Belgorod,
the attack on Saky Air Base or the bombing of the Kerch Bridge -- in
addition to the regular fighting proceeding along the front lines --
would have been sufficient to trigger retaliation.

But [such [concerns are **not consistent** with]{.mark} Russian
**nuclear [doctrine]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **force [posture]{.mark}**.
Russia's **[operation]{.mark}**al]{.underline} nuclear
[doctrine]{.underline} (as opposed to the published version) [[focuses
on employment **against**]{.mark} **the possibility** of a [**small**
nuclear conflict escalating]{.mark} to a theatre or general
war]{.underline}, and the force posture of Russia's non-strategic
nuclear arsenal reflects that mission. [Russia sees non-strategic
nuclear use in such escalation-prevention scenarios]{.underline} -- as
well as near-peer theatre-level conflicts -- [as a prescribed '**dose**'
of violence to '**soberise**' the adversary, **prevent it** from
**escalating** or **coerce** it into **capitulating**]{.underline}.
Thus, [it is **highly unlikely** that Russia would use nuclear weapons
**against Ukrainian targets** in this war]{.underline}. It may be
helpful to illustrate the underlying principles of this conclusion by
thinking about tactical nuclear weapon use. This is not to say that
doctrine is determinative, given that in this war Putin has acted in
ways contrary to any rational military doctrine. But most analysts
expect that he would only use nuclear weapons in Ukraine if he something
to gain from doing so.

In order to use tactical nuclear weapons in the current conflict, Russia
would have to answer four questions:

1\) What is the intended target of a nuclear strike?

2\) What is the intended effect on the target?

3\) What type of nuclear weapon would create the intended effect with
the highest efficiency?

4\) What happens next?

As Hoffman and I argued in April, [there are three types of potential
uses for Russian nuclear weapons in]{.underline} its war on
[Ukraine]{.underline}: [1) a **[demonstration]{.mark}**
strike]{.underline} against an unpopulated area such as the Black Sea;
[2) a **[counter-force]{.mark}** battlefield strike]{.underline};
[[and]{.mark} 3) a **[counter-value]{.mark}** strike]{.underline}
against a population centre to seek a political termination of the war,
or possible to decapitate Ukraine's government. [Scenarios 1 and 3 are
**vanishingly unlikely**, as]{.underline} 1 would probably [[have **no
effect** on Ukraine]{.underline}'s]{.mark} will to fight or on Western
support for Ukraine [[but]{.mark} would [give **rise** to]{.mark}
**massive global political [opprobrium]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Scenario
3 would obviously increase Ukraine's will to fight and it would also
increase global support for Ukraine's struggle and make Russia and Putin
himself a target for defeat for a massive coalition of countries
including states that are currently neutral or even supportive of the
war effort. And, for all three of these scenarios, the question of what
happens next looms. If scenarios 1 and 3 do not end the conflict on
Russia's terms, Moscow might well be on the receiving end of political,
economic, and possibly even military retaliation.

[This leaves scenario 2]{.underline}. Put simply, [however, [there are
**no attractive** military targets]{.mark} for Russian nuclear weapons
in Ukraine. Ukraine does not operate with a **large-enough
concentration**]{.underline} of forces [to **justify** a **10--100
kiloton blast**]{.underline}. Smaller nuclear weapons would be of even
less use, as below 10 kilotons, their effects are overtaken by those of
high-end precision mass-effect artillery, such as the Tornado-G and -S
and the TOS-1M/1A and TOS-2, especially when using thermobaric warheads.
As Janne Korhonen describes in an excellent Twitter thread, tactical
nuclear weapons are far less decisive in their effects than one might
think, and conventional artillery strikes such as the one at
Zelenopillya in July 2014 demonstrate similar levels of effectiveness in
combat without breaching the nuclear taboo, risking global opprobrium,
unleashing dangerous radioactive fallout, or demoralising the soldiers
on one's own side. So Putin has two bad nuclear options before him:
either employ multiple small warheads to achieve a significant
battlefield effect (with a real threat of intervention and escalation),
or employ one larger, theatre nuclear weapon to achieve a political
effect (and still risk intervention and escalation).

[**[Defeating]{.mark}** the Ukrainian army on the battlefield would
[require **dozens** of tactical]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark} to
achieve a **decisive military effect**]{.underline} -- not just a single
strike. In fact, the US Army planned to use 136 nuclear strikes to
achieve a decisive result over a 60-mile-long front -- and the
frontlines between Ukraine and Russia now stretch for almost 400 miles.
[The risks of **[radiation]{.mark}** from this many strikes, not to
mention the **[psychological effects]{.mark}** on Russian
soldiers]{.underline} of witnessing destruction on such a scale, [[would
be **considerable**]{.underline}]{.mark}, reducing their combat
effectiveness and their already-low ability to exploit gaps in Ukrainian
defensive lines. The radiation effects are not to be ignored, with
immediate effects on all soldiers in the open regardless of their
loyalty, as well as the [**spread of [fallout]{.mark}** into occupied
Ukraine, and into Belarus and Russia, which would **[cause panic among
populations]{.mark}**]{.underline} already made wary by Ukraine's
strikes in Russia and occupied Crimea. Further, if the intent is to
break Ukraine's will or the West's resolve, any such strikes would fail
utterly. [Breaking the **77-year taboo** on nuclear use in war would
only **galvanise** Ukraine and the West's **support** for it while
**rallying more countries** to the cause]{.underline}.

### Germany CP\-\--AT: Impact\-\--LIO

#### No LIO impact.

**Glaser, 19** (Charles, PublicPolicy@Harvard,
ProfPoliSci@GeorgeWashington, A Flawed Framework: Why the Liberal
International Order Concept Is Misguided, International Security, 43:4,
51-87)

[To improve analysis and debate of U.S. foreign policy,
scholars,]{.underline} policy analysts, [and [policymakers should
**discontinue use of the term "liberal international order**"]{.mark}
and its variants]{.underline}, including "hegemonic liberal order."
First, for reasons discussed above, [the LIO concept provides little
analytic leverage; it is inward looking, and]{.underline} certain of
[its arguments are theoretically weak]{.underline}. Second, the [LIO
discourse is a source of significant confusion]{.underline} about both
the evolution of global politics and U.S. policy. As I argued at the
outset, [[scholars]{.mark} and commentators [do not have an agreed
understanding about what the LIO includes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [More
important, [the **LIO terminology clouds analysis of international
policy** by obscuring what is actually occurring]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consider, for example, the common observation that the LIO faces growing
threats as a result of China\'s rise and Russia\'s assertive foreign
policies. These dangers, however, have actually strengthened U.S.
alliances and, in turn, the LIO. At least until the Trump
administration, China\'s rise was increasing the depth and cohesion of
U.S. alliances in Northeast Asia. Similarly, Russia\'s increasingly
aggressive behavior in Ukraine and elsewhere was helping reinvigorate
NATO. In short, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is facing
growing threats to its security, not to the LIO]{.underline}. Although
perhaps counterintuitive, it was the early post--Cold War decades that
posed the greatest threat to the security elements of the LIO---the lack
of major power threats to U.S. security weakened U.S. alliances. It
should also be noted that China is much more integrated into the
international economy, including importantly via the WTO, than the
Soviet Union ever was. Whether China\'s economic inclusion is a net
positive for the United States remains an open question, but it
certainly strengthens the economic pillar of the LIO. Third, [framing
analysis of U.S. policy in terms of the LIO builds in a significant
status quo bias]{.underline}. Much of the [discussion of the LIO starts
from the premise that it is desirable and needs to be
preserved]{.underline}.95 [During periods of significant change in the
distribution of power,]{.underline} however, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should be reconsidering whether to preserve
its]{.underline} international [commitments and exploring how best to
achieve its]{.underline} fundamental [interests]{.underline} in the
decades ahead.96 Fourth, [by viewing the LIO as an unalloyed good, U.S.
leaders]{.underline} risk [fail]{.underline}ing to
[appreciate]{.underline} fully [that adversaries of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [view central pillars of the
LIO]{.underline}---its alliances, in particular---[as a source of
competition and threat.]{.underline} [For example]{.underline}, the LIO
perspective contributed to U.S. enthusiasm for [expanding
NATO]{.underline} eastward to spread democracy, while giving too little
weight to Russia\'s understanding of expansion\'s negative implications.
Similarly, it likely contributes to U.S. underappreciation of the threat
that the U.S.-Japan alliance, especially the [broadening of Japan\'s
responsibilities]{.underline} in the alliance, poses to China.
[These]{.underline} U.S. [misperceptions [increase the probability that
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will
misinterpret adversaries' policies by failing to understand them as
**reactions to threatening U.S. policies.**]{.mark} **[The LIO\'s status
quo bias and its contribution]{.mark} t**o]{.underline} these [U.S.
misperceptions are]{.underline} potentially [dangerous, because they
[encourage]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
[exaggerate the]{.mark} threats it faces and to pursue unduly
competitive policies]{.underline}. [Framing China as a threat to the LIO
reflects and combines both of these dangers,]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} thereby **[[unnecessarily aggravates U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**.97 For all of these reasons, [scholars
and policymakers should use LIO terminology, at most, for descriptive
purposes]{.underline}. The LIO [would simply refer to the international
situation, including]{.underline} the [key]{.underline} international
[institutions]{.underline}, the [rules]{.underline} that support them,
[and the regime types of its members]{.underline}. [It **would not imply
desirability or the ability** to]{.underline} generate, [even contribute
to, specific international outcomes, beyond those generated by its
individual elements]{.underline}. **[Even this usage has
disadvantages]{.underline}**, among others [that there is **no agreement
on which elements the LIO includes**.]{.underline} ADVANTAGES OF A
GRAND-STRATEGIC LENS [To generate]{.underline} greater [clarity
about]{.underline} the [international challenges facing the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its options for
confronting them, **[analysts should employ a grand-strategic
lens]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [By grand strategy, I mean [the broad
policies---military, diplomatic, and economic---that a state pursues to
achieve its vital interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.98 **[[The LIO is
simultaneously a product of]{.mark} U.S. grand strategy [and a part of
U.S. grand strategy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The U.S. Cold War grand
strategy of containment called for protecting Western Europe from the
Soviet Union; NATO was created for this purpose and is a key component
of the LIO. The economic dimension of U.S. grand strategy is the liberal
international economic system, which is a second key component of the
LIO; it reflects long-held U.S. beliefs in both the economic benefits of
openness and the potential of openness to support peace. [[Adoption of a
grand-strategic lens would improve]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[analysis]{.mark} of issues raised by the LIO discourse]{.underline} by
[[placing them in the wider context of U.S. options]{.mark} for dealing
with current geopolitical challenges.]{.underline} It would have three
specific advantages. First, [it would improve analysis of U.S. interests
and threats to those interests]{.underline}. [The initial
step]{.underline} in any analysis [of grand strategy is to [identify a
state\'s fundamental interests]{.mark}]{.underline}; typically, security
and prosperity rank highest. [The next step is to [consider threats to
these interests]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [The **LIO
lens**]{.underline}]{.mark} essentially [**[skips these steps]{.mark}**
by [assuming that the LIO is a fundamental U.S.
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}; [anything that threatens the LIO is
therefore a threat to U.S. interests]{.underline}. As I explained at the
outset, however, **[[the LIO is not an end/interest; instead, it is a
means for achieving U.S. interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[Shifting to
a grand-strategic framework]{.mark} should [impose]{.mark} the
**[analytic discipline]{.mark}** required to avoid these
errors.]{.underline} Second, [adoption of a grand-strategic framework
[would require]{.mark} [engaging with]{.mark}]{.underline} theories and
[[theoretical disputes relevant to]{.mark} the formulation of
[U.S]{.mark}. international [policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Grand
strategy reflects]{.underline} beliefs/[theories that play a central
role in identifying threats and provide the logical connection between a
state\'s interests and the available means for achieving
them]{.underline}. [The LIO concept includes some
theories]{.underline}/mechanisms about the nature of threats to U.S.
interests and about possible solutions: [authoritarian regimes are
dangerous,]{.underline} democracies are not; [economic engagement can
reduce]{.underline} incentives for [war]{.underline}; economic growth
will convert authoritarian regimes to democracies; [and so
on]{.underline}. The [[LIO discourse **proceeds as though these theories
are widely accepted**]{.mark}**,** [when in fact scholarly
debate]{.mark} over them [continues]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition,
[[a range of **additional theories must be employed to adequately
analyze U.S.**]{.mark} **international [policy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
including those [that address deterrence, power transitions, alliance
formation, the security dilemma, and other causes of war]{.underline}.
Employing [a [grand-strategic framework should result in]{.mark} this
**[more complete and transparent theoretical
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}.99 Third[, a grand-strategic framework
would identify the full spectrum of]{.underline} broad [options for
achieving U.S. security]{.underline} and prosperity, [ranging from
neo-isolationist policies]{.underline} that would terminate U.S.
alliances [to global hegemony]{.underline} that requires intense
military and economic competition with China. In contrast, [[the LIO
lens starts with **a single option and the assumption that it is
desirable**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A [[grand-strategic lens would
generate **comparisons and assessments** of the range of
possible]{.mark} grand [strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

concerned about]{.mark} a **[nuclear-armed Germany]{.mark}**. Only a
few]{.underline} attention-seeking [experts on the political **fringe**
made the case]{.underline} for Berlin going nuclear. One prolific
proponent, the UK-based German academic Maximilian Terhalle, argued that
"the answer to the lack of strategic protection for \[Germany's\]
national security must ... be that Germany needs nuclear weapons"
(Terhalle 2017, translation Oliver Meier). Like the retired history
professor Christian Hacke (Hacke 2018), Terhalle maintains that the
French and UK nuclear arsenals would be too small to effectively deter
Russia and that, ultimately, decisions about the use of nuclear weapons
must not and cannot be shared. So, these experts reasoned, Germany would
need nuclear weapons to defend itself. While a few other think tankers
(for example Benner 2017; Ischinger 2018) occasionally mused about the
pros and cons of German nuclear weapons, [the [argument got **zero
traction** among **decision makers**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[German]{.underline} acquisition of [[nuclear weapons]{.mark} would
[require]{.mark} multiple **[costly]{.mark}** and **[radical
shifts]{.mark}** of Berlin's foreign and security policies. Germany
would have to [**withdraw** from]{.mark} the **[NPT]{.mark}** and
[violate]{.mark} **legal obligations** under the]{.underline} 1990 2 + 4
[**[Treaty on Unification]{.mark}**, in which it agreed not to possess
nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons of mass destruction. That
on]{.underline} hard [security issues Germany must "**[never act
alone]{.mark}**" is a theme to which German [decision makers]{.mark}
have been **[socialized]{.mark}** ever since the end of World War II.
Germany's [**constitution** reflects]{.mark} Berlin's **internationalist
orientation**, stating that rules of
**[i]{.mark}**]{.underline}nternational [**[law take
precedence]{.mark}** over national laws]{.underline} (Meier 2001).
[Establishing a [nuclear fuel cycle]{.mark}]{.underline} to support a
German nuclear weapons program [would require a [**reversal** of]{.mark}
the national [decision to **phase out nuclear energy**]{.mark}
generation by 2022 -- [a policy]{.mark} that has been [supported by
**all**]{.mark} mainstream parties. Even Germany's **far-right**
national **populists**]{.underline} of the Alternative für Deutschland,
which advocates a withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Germany, [do not
favor German nuclear weapons]{.underline} (AfD 2017).

**[Nuclear Non-Starters]{.underline}**

Let us be clear: [a number of]{.underline} options and [scenarios should
be **taken off the table** of **strategic forecasting**, given that
[they have]{.mark} almost **[zero chance of becoming real]{.mark}** in
the coming two decades. These include [a **German
bomb**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a French-German one, a EU-wide common
deterrent, and a British-French deterrent.

A German Bomb

In the past two years, several [German [officials]{.mark} and experts
have]{.underline} publicly [[toyed with the idea]{.mark} of a national
nuclear program. [However, they do not include **any highly influential
figures**]{.mark} and are **hardly representative** of the German
debate. Such [statements reflect]{.mark} more the **[current]{.mark}
national [insecurity]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the **[future of the U.S.
guarantee]{.mark}** than anything else]{.underline}---as well, perhaps,
as a laudable effort to lift thought taboos in German strategic
thinking.3

[**[Germany gave up any nuclear option]{.mark}** on]{.underline} no less
than [three different occasions]{.underline}, in different legal forms.
[In 1954, [it promised not to produce nuclear]{.mark}, biological or
chemical [weapons on its soil.]{.mark}]{.underline} True, up until the
late 1960s, a national nuclear option was openly discussed in Bonn's
ruling circles and with allies. But [a [**set of institutions** and
**mechanisms**]{.mark} was then set up that [**killed this option for
good**. Germany subscribed to the]{.mark}]{.underline} Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
[[(**NPT**)]{.underline}---]{.mark}a treaty whose support by the Soviet
Union was in no small measure driven by the need to avoid a German bomb.
In parallel, [**NATO** set up structures and procedures for nuclear
policymaking and nuclear use sharing, including the Nuclear Planning
Group (**[NPG]{.mark}**)]{.underline}, a body through which Bonn's
influence on NATO strategy would become significant. Finally, [Germany
gave up its nuclear option for the third time through [the "**Four Plus
Two**" treaty]{.mark} of 1990]{.underline} which led the way to
unification. [[There is **zero appetite**]{.mark} **today** [in]{.mark}
**mainstream German [policy circles]{.mark}** [for a]{.mark} national
[nuclear program]{.mark}]{.underline}---and, indeed, continued
skepticism in parts of the left for NATO nuclear sharing.

Furthermore, [**[Germany does not have]{.mark} the [required wherewithal
for]{.mark} even [a]{.mark} rudimentary
[program]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Not that it would have to
start from scratch: [it has superb scientists and
engineers]{.underline}, and the country is a world leader in machine
tools. [But]{.underline} contrary to Japan, [[it neither has]{.mark} any
strictly **indigenous [uranium enrichment]{.mark}** [nor]{.mark} does it
have **[fuel reprocessing capabilities]{.mark}** any
longer.]{.underline} Germany's two enrichment plants located in Gronau
belong to the Urenco international consortium created after the treaty
of Almelo (1970).4 The German share in Urenco is not government-owned
but belongs jointly to two utilities companies, E.On and RWE. And even
though their products serve the market and not only German plants, the
future of these plants remain uncertain after Berlin's decision to give
up nuclear power and phase out its existing reactor

### Germany CP\-\--AT: Impact\-\--Power Vacuum

#### European conflicts won't escalate -- no vacuum of power.

The trend is apparent on every continent. The only conflict raging in
the entire Western Hemisphere in 2010 was the ongoing civil war in
Colombia, and even that was far less bloody than a decade prior. Cruise
ships have returned to Caratagena. Despite the fact that there are no
nuclear weapons south of the United States, the states of Central and
South America act as if they do not fear an attack from their neighbors.
**[The rules of realpolitik no longer seem to apply.
[Europe]{.mark},]{.underline}** which of course has been the most
war-prone of continents for most of human history, [**[is entirely calm,
without even the threat of interstate conflict]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
More than one scholar has noted the rather remarkable fact **[that [no
serious war planning now goes on among the European
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}\'; All over Europe and the
Americas,\" John Keegan has observed, \"[**armies are withering
away**.]{.underline}\"\" The situations in Bosnia and Kosovo, while not
settled, are at least calm for the moment. And in contrast to 1914, the
great powers have shown no eagerness to fill Balkan power vacuums; to
the contrary, throughout the 1990s. they had to he shamed into
intervention, and were on the same side when they eventually did so.
International reactions to turmoil in the Balkans in 1914 and in 1992
demonstrate the extent to which the international system had changed.
**[[Today\'s power vacuums]{.mark} seem to [repel far more than they
attract]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

## NATO

NATO's inability to agree on an Arctic strategy means that [[NATO
**lacks** Arctic]{.mark}-capable]{.underline}
[[capacities]{.underline}]{.mark}. With so much focus on defense budgets
of two percent as a minimum target that may soon be increased,
[[all]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Arctic [NATO]{.mark} member
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[except]{.mark} for [the US]{.mark}**
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[difficulties justifying
spending]{.underline}** [on capabilities that **do not** count as
**contributions** to NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} [capabilities
[targets]{.mark}]{.underline}. Another topic for the Arctic roundtable
might be how to revise the capabilities targets so they acknowledge
expensive investments in capabilities that are of central importance to
North-Atlantic security.

Despite the destruction that the NATO military alliance has caused in
Europe and Asia, we [progressives face an **uncomfortable
truth**]{.underline}: [we **need** a]{.underline} [military
powerful]{.underline} [enough]{.underline} [to **stand
against**]{.underline} the many [threats that **Russia** and **China**
pose to]{.underline} democracy around [the world]{.underline}. As well,
we must never let our opposition to the threat that America poses to
global democracy make us patsies for Russian or Chinese control.

The [most potent threat to]{.underline} our own
[democracies]{.underline} [is]{.underline} the [**destabilization** of
our democratic societies]{.underline}. A [foundation of modern Russia's
foreign policy is to aflame **social conflicts**]{.underline} inside of
democratic polities, [and use weapons of cyber-warfare,]{.underline}
such as viruses [and **disinformation**]{.underline}.

China has taken a more traditional route to global dominance. Chinese
investments in massive resource extraction projects across Africa follow
the model of the old British East India Company. Take almost all profit
from mines and oil wells, while trapping their African partner states in
unsustainable debt from project financing.

[How do we]{.underline} progressive and other ordinary people [escape
this triple]{.underline} [squeeze between **three militarized**,
aggressive superpower states]{.underline} run by mafiosi and billionaire
power brokers? **[Anti-capitalist]{.underline}**,
**[socialist]{.underline}**, and democratic [organization]{.underline}
and agitation [across the world is really our **only
answer.**]{.underline}

[**We need NATO**,]{.underline} but only [because socialist]{.underline}
and democratic [movements are **closer** to taking some measure of
**control** away from the corrupt]{.underline} [in Europe and the
Americas]{.underline}, pessimistic though even these prospects often
feel. A socialist Europe and North America would stand against Russia
and China as the weapons of war move to the internet and public
political movements themselves.

[If]{.underline} the [NATO]{.underline} states of Europe and North
America [could unite in an **aggressive cyberwar** to encourage popular
**resistance** to the]{.underline} brutal mafia [totalitarianism of
Russia and China]{.underline}, [then we will have a]{.underline}
[chance]{.underline} [for **global democracy**,]{.underline} [socialism,
a green economy, and a **sustainable civilization** on
Earth.]{.underline}

Until those revolutions happen, we remain in our triple bind. But
collapsing our military entirely, while geopolitical enemies expand and
consolidate theirs, is a recipe for our enslavement. We remain slaves
under neoliberal capitalism, our opportunities ground to dust.

[But states with the power]{.underline} [of Europe's]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [North America's]{.underline}, [run on
genuinely]{.underline} egalitarian [**socialist principles** and
policies, allied to fight for]{.underline} actual [freedom]{.underline}
and dignity of all people, [will be a **greater threat** to]{.underline}
the menace of [totalitarianism]{.underline} [than]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [cash-sick **militarism** of the]{.underline} old
[United States ever could have been.]{.underline}

The Case for NATO in the Western Balkans

[While **Western imperialism**]{.underline} [should be
**condemned**,]{.underline} [so should the **non-Western
variety**]{.underline}. In Eastern Europe, it was [the Soviet
Union]{.underline} that [embodied]{.underline} the [**worst** of
imperialism]{.underline}. [Today it is **Russia**]{.underline}, with its
numerous military invasions and occupations in the region since 1999.

[In the]{.underline} Western [Balkans]{.underline}, [the United States
and NATO]{.underline} [have **not** posed an]{.underline} **[existential
threat]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} the [citizens]{.underline} of
Albania, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, and Kosovo.
[Instead]{.underline}, [these citizens]{.underline} [worry about

Even Anti-Imperialists Cite Imperialist Solutions

[Discussing **NATO enlargement**]{.underline} within Eastern Europe and
the Balkans [without delving into]{.underline} the
**[complexities]{.underline}** [of regional history and
politics]{.underline} [is an **imperialist project**]{.underline}. [When
Western actors]{.underline} [explain NATO]{.underline}
[membership]{.underline} [through]{.underline} the lens of **[Western
machinations]{.underline}** [and blame European states for]{.underline}
their [NATO aspirations]{.underline}, [they are]{.underline} really
[saying]{.underline} that Eastern [European and Balkan]{.underline}
[countries]{.underline} [should]{.underline} be content to [serve as
**buffer**]{.underline} states [between empires]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [accept]{.underline} [their lot as **second-class
