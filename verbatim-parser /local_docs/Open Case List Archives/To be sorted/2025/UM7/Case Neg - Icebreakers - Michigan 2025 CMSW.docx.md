#### Icebreakers aren't key to heg -- it's a bad metric

For many, the United States is woefully behind, with serious
implications for national defense. [One of the most common and
consistent metrics to make this case is a comparison of the numbers of
U.S., Russian, and Chinese icebreakers]{.underline}. As Lindsay Rodman
highlights, when comparing Russian military advantages relative to the
United States in the Arctic, "the most often cited example is
icebreakers." By this standard, Washington is losing to Moscow --- and
it's not even close. While Russia has at least 40 icebreakers in its
fleet, China and the United States have two icebreakers apiece.

[However, using [relative icebreaker fleet sizes as a]{.mark} key
[metric]{.mark} for the state of strategic competition in the Arctic [is
**flawed**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While they are an important platform,
[icebreakers do little to create or address the most commonly identified
defense challenges in the region]{.underline}. Instead, [analysts should
focus on the nature of the military risks in the Arctic, the role of
allies and partners, and economic interests in a broader geopolitical
context rather than comparing specific capabilities]{.underline}. Doing
so is important to avoid mischaracterizing the scope of the danger or
emphasizing the wrong types of solutions.

The Icebreaker Fleets

If relative icebreaker counts are the right way to measure competition
in the Arctic, then the United States is in trouble. Russia possesses
more than 40 icebreakers and plans to build more, with a goal of 13
heavy-duty icebreakers in operation by 2035. China recently acquired its
second, and first domestically built, icebreaker and has aspirations for
a nuclear-powered variant. By contrast, the United States has one aged
heavy icebreaker and one medium version in operation. While there are
plans to build six more (including three heavy icebreakers at an
estimated total cost of \$2.6--2.95 billion), funding is largely limited
to the first one and it will not be available until 2023 or 2024. Unlike
past fears that the United States was on the wrong side of a bomber gap,
missile gap, or the dreaded mine-shaft gap, an icebreaker gap does
indeed exist.

Most analysts who warn about the gap distinguish the Coast Guard's role
--- which operates U.S. icebreakers and is part of the Department of
Homeland Security in peacetime ---from the Department of Defense mission
set. Yet placing the icebreaker discussion alongside threats from Russia
and China makes an implicit or explicit connection between icebreakers
and U.S. military vulnerability.

The Consequences of an Icebreaker Gap

[Thankfully for Washington, the consequences of this icebreaker gap for
U.S. defense are often misunderstood or overstated]{.underline}. First,
many of the specific [military challenges that China or Russia might
pose in the Arctic are independent of icebreakers]{.underline} and best
dealt with in other ways. [These include denying the United States
access to the region, missile strikes against the homeland, the ability
to move forces from the homeland, and demonstrating U.S. strength
against challenges.]{.underline}

It is [not clear how Russia or China would leverage icebreakers to
exclude the United States]{.underline} from the region, [or how the
United States would utilize icebreakers to overcome such
attempts]{.underline}. Take [the concern of [Russia]{.mark}
[denying]{.mark} [access]{.mark} [along the]{.mark} [N]{.mark}orthern
[S]{.mark}ea [R]{.mark}oute]{.underline} (setting aside the limited
trans-Arctic shipping to date and modest future projections). The
[Russian ability to do this [stems]{.mark} primarily [from]{.mark} their
growing [missile, air, and surveillance
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} deployed within their own territory.
As Mathieu Boulègue observes, the Russian Northern Fleet will likely be
able to perform some sea denial missions "at a limited operational
tempo." Yet "the majority of its assets are not Arctic-specific,
operating beyond the region and in other strategic directions[."
[Increasing]{.mark} the numbers of U.S. [icebreakers would not
overcome]{.mark} the Russian shore-based area-denial
challenge.]{.underline} In the event of a crisis, [[naval]{.mark}
surface [vessels]{.mark} operating [behind slow]{.mark}-moving
[icebreakers would be]{.mark}, Andreas Kuersten notes, "[sitting
**ducks**]{.mark} for aerial, undersea, and shore-based enemy
forces."]{.underline}

[Icebreakers would play a marginal role in countering other military
challenges]{.underline} to the United States emerging from the region.
[[Missiles fired from]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n Arctic toward the
United States would [traverse over the Arctic]{.mark}. The status of
what the DoD terms the "aging North Warning System" is a greater concern
from this perspective than a lack of icebreakers.]{.underline}
Similarly, [while Russia's icebreakers are important for its Northern
Fleet's ability to operate in and through the Arctic, the number of U.S.
icebreakers has little bearing on this.]{.underline} Addressing Russia's
ability to project power into the North Atlantic, the DoD Arctic
strategy focuses on other capabilities. These include [cooperation with
Great Britain and Norway on P-8 patrols, NATO air policing missions from
Iceland, and a recognition that establishment of Joint Force Command
Norfolk helps to protect the North Atlantic sea lines of communication
to Europe.]{.underline}

[[Nuclear weapons]{.mark} remain a perennial problem, but their
[strategic value is **little** affected by]{.mark} the relative number
of [icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}. The 2019 DoD annual report on
China worries that Chinese civilian research --- presumably some of
which would be undertaken by icebreakers --- could support efforts to
deploy "submarines to the region as a deterrent against nuclear
attacks." Turning to Russia, the bulk of its naval nuclear deterrent
capability is based in the Kola Peninsula. Much of Russia's military
activity in the Arctic is dedicated to defending this capability. As
Austin Long and Brendan Green show, during the Cold War the United
States relied on a combination of sensors, information processing,
submarines, and other anti-submarine warfare assets to track Soviet
nuclear-powered submarines armed with ballistic missiles (SSBNs). To be
sure, technology has not stood still. Yet tracking Russian and Chinese
SSBNs in or in transit to the Arctic today would involve a variety of
U.S. capabilities beyond or already with access to the Arctic. If
anything, diminishing sea ice might undermine the ability of SSBNs to
remain hidden. [More generally, the U.S. has relied on its nuclear
arsenal for decades to deter nuclear threats. It is unclear why Russia
or China possessing more icebreakers would undermine that
deterrent.]{.underline}

Others have argued that U.S. icebreakers are necessary to signal
resolve. For instance, Sabrina Shankman reports that more than a dozen
polar and military experts concluded that "if a rival state decided to
encroach on the U.S. exclusive economic zone . . . or step up a military
show of force," then the "presence --- or absence --- of an icebreaker
could . . . be a telling message of strength or weakness." Presumably,
though, a U.S. ability to respond with more lethal subsurface or aerial
assets would constitute a telling message.

Second, the implications of relative numbers of icebreakers look
different when considering the vastly different Arctic contexts,
particularly for the United States and Russia. According to the Arctic
Institute, Russia has roughly 24,140 kilometers of coastline and two
million inhabitants in the Arctic. The Economist highlighted that, all
told, Russia has "at least half of the Arctic in terms of area,
coastline, population and probably mineral wealth." The Russian economy
depends heavily on oil and natural gas, including from the Arctic, for
its federal budget and exports. As noted, a sizeable portion of Russia's
strategic nuclear deterrent is based in the Arctic. Russian interests
dictate a large number of icebreakers. By comparison, the United States
has roughly 4,057 kilometers (2,521 miles) of Arctic shoreline and
approximately 68,000 people living in the Alaskan Arctic. Oil and gas
extraction, even when including the non-Artic portion, makes up a very
small percentage of the U.S. economy. The U.S. nuclear triad is not
dependent upon basing or SSBN patrols in the Arctic.

A third problem with [[focusing]{.mark} solely [on counts of U.S.
capabilities]{.mark} is that it [ignores]{.mark} the role of U.S.
[allies]{.mark} and partners.]{.underline} Seven [of the eight [Arctic
nations]{.mark} are either NATO allies or NATO enhanced opportunities
partners ([six]{.mark} of which [have]{.mark} some icebreaking
[capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}). Non-Arctic allies, such as the United
Kingdom, have interests and assets relevant to the region as well. These
states' capabilities and geographic locations shape the Arctic security
environment. For example[, Canada currently operates two heavy and four
medium icebreakers]{.underline} and the Norwegian Armed Forces' Joint
Headquarters is located in the Arctic. Rebecca Pincus explains how,
"carefully calibrated," the "NATO-Russia Council could be a useful forum
for dialogue on security topics in the Arctic." The contribution of
specific allies and partners will no doubt be more relevant to some
problems than others. Even if they are not able to directly contribute
to a particular issue, allies and partners can free up U.S. time and
resources to focus elsewhere. They can also help improve situational
awareness and manage tensions more broadly to minimize dangers and
create opportunities in and near the North American and European Arctic.

Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine is the latest punctuation in Putin's
pattern of bellicosity. US strategists and policymakers cannot afford to
overlook what Russia's hubris may mean for North America's future
national security. This is not to say that Russia will soon add Alaska
to its list of invasion targets. It is to say, however, that Russia's
invasion of Ukraine highlights the fundamental truth that defending
one's homeland remains the chief priority of every sovereign nation on
earth. The problem: the United States cannot reliably deter aggression
or defend the homeland via its most vulnerable avenue of approach. To
deter and defend, Washington needs to demonstrate commitment to and be
visibly present in the Arctic. And being more present requires a
different approach.

Arctic Apathy Begets Arctic Action

After the Cold War and the Soviet Union's collapse, the over-the-Arctic
threat eroded. With the creation of the Arctic Council in 1996 and the
United States as the world's only superpower of the time, the region's
importance waned as Washington became entrenched in conflicts elsewhere
at the outset of the twenty-first century. After twenty years of
sustained conflict in Iraq and Afghanistan, American influence and
hegemony is no longer what it was, raising the stakes of Washington's
polar policy stagnation. A combination of strategic apathy and
indecision has created a reactive security dynamic for the United States
in the Arctic, where proactivity is deeply needed.

Post--Cold War American Arctic apathy created a regional dynamic where
the United States lacks comparable Arctic capabilities to Russia and
China, principally in the form of dedicated polar vessels capable of
operating in Arctic ice. The so-called icebreaker gap is a microcosm of
the bigger problem: the United States has a known shortfall in polar
capabilities with insufficient plans to address it and meet the demands
of future strategic competition. Unable to sustain Arctic surface power
projection and demonstrate a visible regional commitment to strategic
competitors, the US position will erode where Russia and China seek to
exploit Washington's absence. [[The solution to **sustained** US
Arctic]{.mark} hard and soft [power projection]{.mark}, presence, and
influence]{.underline}---at least in the near term---[[is not in
icebreaker construction]{.mark}.]{.underline} Defense acquisition moves
at glacial speeds[. It will be years before the United States meets the
icebreaker target mandated in the 2021 National Defense Authorization
Act. Rather, [the solution rests with]{.mark} better [federal resource
utilization of available assets to achieve a more **consistent** Arctic
presence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Polar Vessels, Then and Now

The US Coast Guard's Polar Star and Polar Sea were commissioned as the
first two heavy-lift icebreakers in 1977. In 1999, the Healy was
commissioned as the third icebreaker (medium) in the US portfolio. When
built, a ship's initial design life is thirty years. By this measure,
2007 marked the conclusion of the initial life of both the Polar Sea and
the Polar Star. Routine preventive maintenance and service-life
extensions can extend the design life beyond this limit, and between
2008 and 2012 the Polar Star underwent a \$57 million overhaul. During
that time, however, in 2010, the Polar Sea experienced catastrophic
engine failure. This left the United States with only one operational
icebreaker in its fleet inventory for nearly two years---hardly enough
to safeguard the Arctic or achieve any meaningful presence and power
projection.

Last year marked the beginning of a series of service-life extension
programs for the Polar Star, expected to cost \$75 million to extend the
vessel's operational life and capability through 2027 to align with the
anticipated arrival of the new Polar Security Cutters. When the Polar
Star retires in 2027, the ship will be fifty years old after having
operated in some of the harshest environments. [[Future US icebreaking
capability looks **slim**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Here the United States sits. It has two available polar-capable vessels
(excluding the National Science Foundation's two vessels, the Nathaniel
B. Palmer and the Laurence M. Gould) in the current fleet inventory. The
Healy is twenty-three years old; the Polar Star is forty-four. The
United States has plans for upwards of six new icebreakers in the coming
decade, but this delivery target is unlikely given past construction
timelines of far less capable vessels. In 2019, the Coast Guard awarded
the contract to build the Polar Security Cutters. Assuming no delays,
the first cutter is expected in 2024 and the second in 2025. But these
are only delivery dates. Once the Coast Guard accepts the ship, another
twelve to eighteen months are required before the ship is operational
and mission ready. At best, the soonest the United States can expect the
first of the new vessels is 2025. Knowing that the Polar Star and Polar
Sea reached the end of their initial thirty-year lifecycle in 2007, and
that the Polar Sea experienced a subsequent engine failure in 2010, the
United States has had no sense of urgency to invest in new Arctic
capabilities. Ship design to commissioning is a decade-long process, yet
Washington still waited until 2019 to start addressing the gap.

The Coast Guard icebreaker woes encapsulate the bigger issue: despite
years of mandates and renewed focus on a geostrategic vulnerability, the
Navy and Coast Guard cannot execute sufficient US power projection.

Do Something Different for Homeland Defense

Despite the Arctic vulnerability, the United States' lead command for
defending the homeland, US Northern Command, "has few permanently
assigned forces" to execute its mission to "defend our homeland" and
"deter, detect, deny, and defeat threats to the United States." Instead,
the command gains forces from the military services when needed or
requested---which often, if not always, means in response to something.
But response is not deterrence. Responding does not deny. The United
States is militarily vulnerable, and the command responsible for the top
national security priority is an insufficient active deterrent.
Washington needs to do better.

Though the US military operates submarines in the Arctic and is
increasingly active in the space domain, these are not visible forms of
military power projection. Deterrence is difficult without a visible
presence; denial is impossible without a visible deterrent. If the
United States is serious about homeland defense, it must dedicate forces
to its homeland defense command and pursue unconventional alternatives
to achieving a greater Arctic presence, and thus a more visible
deterrent.

More broadly, the United States needs a different approach, one that
utilizes available assets now while it works to acquire specific assets
later. [[To expand Arctic presence]{.underline}]{.mark} and contribute
to deterrence and homeland defense, [[Washington must leverage the
**current** capabilities of supporting scientific agencies like
the]{.mark}]{.underline} National Science Foundation, the United States
Academic Research Fleet scheduled through the University National
Oceanographic Laboratory System, the Office of Naval Research, and the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Federal Fleet Assets and Utilization

Considering its economic and security relevance, the United States
cannot afford to be Arctic absent. In the last nine years, Russia built
fourteen new icebreakers, ten million tons of goods transited the
northern sea route, and the first cruise ship transited the Northwest
Passage. The Arctic region is booming with activity and the potential
for more is rapidly growing. Despite the economic value and increased
foreign activity, US Coast guard assets alone are not enough to do what
is necessary to maintain the needed presence and secure US interests in
the harsh, remote, and challenging environment.

The US government's oceangoing assets extend beyond just the
capabilities of the Coast Guard and Navy. Together, the vessels of the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science
Foundation, the Office of Naval Research, and the Coast Guard comprise
the Federal Oceanographic Fleet. As of 2016, the fleet numbered
thirty-five vessels. Of these, the United States has four
polar-designated vessels: the Coast Guard's Polar Star and Healy and the
NSF's contracted vessels, Nathaniel B. Palmer and Laurence M.
Gould---both of which provide dedicated support to the US Antarctic
Program.

While not icebreakers, both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (**[[NOAA]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the National Science Foundation
(**[[NSF]{.underline}]{.mark}**) have vessels capable of limited polar
region operations. [[The Sikuliaq]{.underline}]{.mark}, [owned by the
NSF]{.mark} and operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks, [[can
operate in ice two and a half feet thick while many NOAA ships can
operate in first-year ice.]{.underline}]{.mark} Despite funding
constraints, agency-specific mandates, and legislation, [[there remain
**ample** opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark} to leverage the shared
federal assets and capabilities to bridge the icebreaker gap and
[[ensure US]{.mark} soft [power]{.mark} presence [throughout the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

There are signs that the US government is beginning to appreciate these
opportunities. In 2020, President Donald Trump issued a memo about
safeguarding US interests in the polar regions. The memo directs the
Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies to look for
options to bridge the gap in polar vessel capability until the new Polar
Security Cutters are online. This presents the opportunity for the
Federal Oceanographic Fleet, not DoD, to fill the gap. As Coast Guard
Commandant Admiral Karl L. Schultz has argued, "If we're not present, if
we don't own the environment today, guess who owns it tomorrow---our
competitors." While Russia and China race to build icebreakers and work
to grow their Arctic influence and strategic advantage, the United
States does not have to be a bystander limited by aging infrastructure
and competing operational demands. Turning to the Federal Oceanographic
Fleet for soft power presence bridges the gap until modern
polar-dedicated vessels come online.

Scientists are clamoring to work in these remote polar regions, which
means these ships can be there for presence and also to enable work of
scientific and economic significance to the United States. The assets
are there and available. If Admiral Schultz is right and presence today
is key in the Arctic, then [[the solution lies within the **Federal
Oceanographic Fleet.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

The NOAA Option

NOAA's fleet vessels, in particular, are operated by NOAA Corps
officers, a commissioned officer corps and one of the eight US uniformed
services. NOAA ships sail the world's oceans conducting scientific
research. NOAA is a capable fleet that provides a visible US soft power
presence option for contributing to an active Arctic deterrent. NOAA
ships have sailed into the Arctic and in pirated waters off the coast of
Africa and in the Indian Ocean. NOAA routinely operates in contested
international waters and provides a visible US presence. Its fleet
vessels have been redirected in response to the BP oil spill, aided the
search and recovery efforts for the TWA 800 disaster, and even operated
off the coast of Kuwait in the first Gulf War. The gray hulls of the US
Navy can't do it all. Washington can leverage the white hulls of the
NOAA fleet---commanded by NOAA Corps officers---for future Arctic
presence, contributing to deterrence, and ultimately enhancing defense.

The NOAA Corps mission, in part, provides officers for leadership in the
armed forces during national emergency. It's difficult to argue that if
the security situation in Burma constitutes a US national emergency,
increasing Russian activity in the Arctic closer to US sovereign
airspace and waters---coupled with Russia's international
belligerence---is not conceivably also an emergency. As a scientific
research agency with an operational fleet led by commissioned uniformed
officers who have affirmed their commitment to defend the constitution
against all enemies, NOAA is uniquely suited to contribute to an active
defense.

While NOAA Corps officers can be transferred into the armed forces
during national emergencies, in accordance with the NOAA Corps mission,
doing so at this point is premature. We do not need to realign NOAA
Corps officers for the Arctic threat via service in the armed forces,
provided we acknowledge that it exists and take preemptive and
preventive action in defense of the homeland. Instead, Washington
[[policymakers and strategists should consider NOAA's **untapped**
homeland defense utility and]{.underline} [seek]{.underline}
[ways]{.underline}]{.mark} to more deliberately align Arctic research
missions with those that can offer corresponding value by way
[[of]{.underline} [presence and deterrence.]{.underline}]{.mark}

America's fourth coast is its forgotten coast. Washington has
effectively locked its front door while leaving the back door wide open.
The years of Arctic apathy and defense investment elsewhere offer Russia
and China an avenue for exploitation. As Washington realizes the gravity
of its strategic omission, it is scrambling to draft Arctic strategies,
create Arctic security centers, and acquire new platforms for Arctic
power projection.

However, strategy is just words on paper without the necessary means to
achieve desired ends. [[Icebreakers take **years** to
build]{.underline}]{.mark}. And, at present, the United States has no
viable plans for sustained surface presence in the Arctic---just
acquisition plans and platitude-laden strategies. The Arctic is
happening now. As Admiral Schultz said, "Just being there and accessing
the Arctic is a projection of national sovereignty. It is a national
security mission." [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[cannot afford to
wait]{.underline}]{.mark} to establish sustained surface presence in the
Arctic. The region is a national security imperative with a widening
presence gap. [[Washington must act now and leverage its F]{.mark}ederal
[O]{.mark}ceanographic [F]{.mark}leet [capabilities to fill the
gap.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Icebreakers are overhyped by the media -- there's better ways to project power in the Arctic other than building ice breaker "warships"

Presence & International Appearances

Icebreakers are an interesting platform to study because there appears
to be something special about their place in the international
consciousness. [[When comparing]{.mark} strategic [competition in the
Arctic]{.mark}, the most [commonly-cited example is the U.S.']{.mark}
relatively [small number of icebreakers]{.mark}.65 [Submarines,
aircraft, and infrastructure all play vital roles in establishing power
projection capabilities in the Arctic. But all receive far less
attention than icebreakers do in the media and the political
realm.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This is [because [icebreakers are]{.mark} seen as [the **"bare
minimum"** for serious participation in the Arctic]{.mark}
region]{.underline}, argues one Arctic researcher in the Washington
area. Within the American policy community, icebreakers are seen as [the
ante to establishing a legitimate claim to the region.]{.underline}

Some, like one prominent member of a national security think tank in
Washington, argue [[icebreakers are]{.mark} simply [unimportant from
national security and international relations perspectives.]{.mark} This
analyst argues that the U.[S. national security]{.mark} schema [is
sufficiently supported by the presence of submarines in the
Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} [In interviews with members of the USCG,
however[, **"having presence**" was of the **highest
priority**]{.mark},]{.underline} more so than fully fulfilling statutory
missions. Shannon Jenkins of the USCG said that "it's to our favor to
start with presence" and build from there, indicating [the USCG views
presence as the foundational goal [to be accomplished by icebreaking
vessels]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mr. Jenkins acknowledged the presence of
several U.S. fast-attack (SSN) and guided-missile (SSGN) submarines
operated by the United States Navy as a U.S. military presence in the
Arctic but argued these assets, alone, were insufficient to represent an
American presence in the region. For the vast majority of the time,
submarines operate beneath the water and are invisible to both domestic
and international audiences. [He argued vessels capable of a constant
presence above the water were needed. "You have to show the
flag,"]{.underline} said Mr. Jenkins, ["[to **enforce**]{.mark} **your
own [sovereignty]{.mark}** [and **protect freedom of**]{.mark}
**[navigation]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

As demonstrated by China's rise as an Arctic state, appearances do
matter. [China]{.underline}, as a non-arctic state, [did not need
icebreakers.]{.underline} Rather[, China intentionally produced
them]{.underline} and intentionally deployed them to the Arctic [to
support its claim to being an Arctic state and signal to the
international community that it intended to associate itself with the
Arctic.]{.underline} In essence, [China recognized the symbolic power of
icebreakers and has been exploiting this]{.underline} power. For China,
icebreakers were an integral part of their overall strategy of Arctic
identification. It is one thing to declare oneself a near-Arctic state,
gain membership in the appropriate international bodies, and announce
plans for the construction of a Polar Silk Road.66 It is another to
utilize icebreakers to establish a presence in the Arctic to demonstrate
the capacity to follow through with these claims.

[The presence [argument holds for national security]{.mark}
matters]{.underline}. National security is largely a question of
perception. [[In]{.mark} geostrategic [competition with Russia,
the]{.mark} U.S.' northern maritime [region will be **more secure if the
Russians perceive them** to be so.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A marine presence in the Arctic extends beyond near-peer competition
defense purposes. In the international arena, there are three possible
classifications of the identity of the U.S. as an Arctic nation. The
first manner in which the U.S. could engage the Arctic is as an inactive
participant. Such engagement with the Arctic would entail behavior and
capabilities such as a lack of means to engage, access, and command the
Arctic. This would mean that, even if the U.S. desired to send civilian
and military personnel into the Arctic, they could not. This would
entail a lack of icebreaking capabilities among domestic naval forces.
It would also include a lack of internationally articulated intent to
engage, access, and command the Arctic.

The second manner in which the U.S. could engage with the Arctic is as
an active participant. Such engagement with the Arctic would involve
having the capabilities to access the Arctic, but not making the Arctic
a strategic priority. In this scenario, the U.S. would regularly engage
with international bodies designed to govern the Arctic but fail to lead
them.

The third manner in which [[the U.S. could engage with the
Arctic]{.mark} is [as a leader]{.mark}. Such engagement would entail
having the most or nearly the most advanced and capable means of
accessing and commanding the U.S.' Arctic region. [It would entail
leadership in international Arctic governance
forums.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Currently, the U.S. is barely an active participant. While policymakers
have articulated the importance of the Arctic as a current and future
strategic domain[, the U.S. is sorely lacking in capabilities to access
and command the Arctic. The U.S.' icebreaker fleet is small and outdated
in comparison to the U.S.' near-peer competitors and most Arctic allied
states.]{.underline} The infrastructure to service commercial activity,
the needs of Arctic communities, and the demands of potential military
engagements in the Arctic is sorely lacking[. [If the U.S. is to be a
**leader in the Arctic**, it must invest in]{.underline}]{.mark} [Arctic
capabilities to,]{.underline} first, [demonstrate a commitment to the
region and]{.underline}, second, gain the ability to [perform basic
tasks in the region by [increasing icebreaking
capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

How icebreakers are structured and marketed to the international
community matters, too. Governments make conscious decisions with
regards to the capabilities of each nation's icebreaker platform.
Governments can choose to militarize icebreakers or maintain them as
purely economic, scientific, and commercial platforms. Regardless of
capabilities, how a government speaks about an icebreaker largely
impacts how that platform is perceived by domestic and international
audiences. How governments navigate these two choices is largely
representative of the countries in the region.

Chinese icebreakers, for example, are portrayed by the Chinese as purely
scientific research vessels. They are non-militarized and the Chinese
government ensures the platforms are portrayed as such. Icebreakers,
according to the 2018 Chinese Arctic whitepaper, are built exclusively
"for scientific purposes."67 Chinese icebreakers are postured in this
way because Chinese goals in the region are for the most economic.

In contrast, [[the next generation of American icebreakers is clearly
and intentionally defined as "warships"]{.underline}]{.mark} by the USCG
[as [the U.S. seeks to counter]{.mark} what it perceives to be [a
**growing Russian military threat**]{.mark} in the region. [Russia
icebreakers are]{.mark} very much [militarized]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[the U.S. seeks to respond to this posturing]{.underline} in both
endowing its next generation of icebreakers with combat capabilities and
defining them as warships.

To be sure, [[icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline} are necessary to access
polar areas even as ice cover diminishes. They are an important element
of Arctic sovereignty as a result. However, the number [[that other
countries possess does not affect the number that the United States
requires]{.mark} to provide access to its exclusive economic zone. [It
is also **unlikely**]{.mark} [that a country would use icebreakers to
stake a claim to the U.S. Arctic]{.mark}. If it did, [**capabilities
other than icebreakers would be better suited** to dislodging them
should diplomacy fail]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### No UQ, no arctic race, and icebreakers are useless, even if they are important, they aren't important how the aff specifies.

[[Icebreakers]{.mark} are integral to the security of the American
Arctic]{.underline}, but the media, pundits, and policymakers have
become confused as to how. [In a maritime region covered by ice for
substantial portions of the year, these vessels are the only means to
ensure year-round marine access to northern communities and sea
lanes.]{.underline} As such, they allow for emergency response, law
enforcement, and commercial activity in one of the harshest regions on
earth. [Icebreakers]{.underline} are, however, of [very
limited]{.underline} value for defense purposes, and, yet, it is in
military terms that their procurement has increasingly come to be
framed. This creates more than [[simply a **problem** **of
semantics**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as casting [[icebreaker]{.mark}
[construction]{.mark}]{.underline} in such language [[risks **negative
practical impacts**]{.mark} on the Arctic and national
security]{.underline}.

Despite their indispensable role in the far north, [the American
icebreaker fleet --- the responsibility of the U.S. Coast Guard --- has
been severely neglected]{.underline}. It currently consists of one heavy
icebreaker (recently refurbished but due for decommissioning sometime
"between December 2019 and December 2022") and one medium icebreaker. A
second heavy icebreaker has been out of service since experiencing
engine failure in 2010. Meanwhile, studies commissioned by the Coast
Guard put forth that three of each class are required for the year-round
fulfillment of northern responsibilities --- although the Coast Guard
vice commandant has said that the service only "needs at least two heavy
icebreakers" given current demands. Regardless of the recommendation
relied upon, there exists a gap between American [icebreaking]{.mark}
need and the Coast Guard's icebreaking capability, creating a northern
vulnerability.

Yet after substantial delay, [p[rogress is **finally** being
made]{.underline} ]{.mark}[toward the funding]{.underline} of a new
heavy icebreaker. The Obama administration and members of Congress have
taken up the banner of icebreaker fleet recapitalization, and the \$[1
[billion needed]{.mark} for such a vessel has been [added to a]{.mark}
proposed bipartisan funding [bill]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Navy will
also be joining forces with the Coast Guard for the acquisition process
given its far greater expertise in large-scale ship procurement. (It
remains to be seen whether this process will churn out a ship before the
icebreaker fleet is reduced to a single unit and the gap between needs
and capacity expands).

Despite the aforementioned positive steps, [however]{.underline},
[[popular]{.mark} and governmental [icebreaker discourse]{.mark} is
**[increasingly framed in inappropriate terms]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Beyond human, economic, and environmental security --- and often in
their absence --- [[icebreaker procurement is **increasingly advocated
in terms of defense**]{.mark} operations.]{.underline} As an example,
Representative Duncan Hunter (R-CA), a key Congressional proponent of
icebreaker construction, recently said:

My concerns continue to lie with current mission gaps in the Arctic,
particularly defense readiness, due to the inability of assets to
support year-round missions in the region.

And these concerns are driven by the conception of the Arctic as a
region of coming conflict and ominous comparisons between America's
depleted icebreaker fleet and Russia's fleet, which boasts more than 40
vessels. It is widely contended that the [[United
States]{.underline}]{.mark} suffers an "icebreaker gap" [with [regard to
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} that it must close to adequately defend its
northern interests and win the "race for the Arctic."

But **[[there is no race to be won]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Most Arctic
territory and resources are solidly within the jurisdictions of Arctic
states, and disputed continental shelves are in the process of being
amicably apportioned under the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (UNCLOS) (Although not party to this treaty, the United States
accepts the majority of it as customary international law "binding on
nations that do not specifically decline to adhere to them"). Arctic
states have been operating under this body of law for roughly 15 years.
Contrary to what many in Washington might expect, [[Russia has
been]{.mark} an [active]{.mark} participant in this process from the
beginning]{.underline}. Indeed, Russia has the most to gain from an
adhered-to, rules-based Arctic international regime (or lose if this
regime degrades). As such, it is [[unlikely]{.mark} that the spirit of
[cooperation]{.mark} that pervades northern relations will [evaporate
any time soon]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[**Even if** there were a race]{.mark} for the Arctic that involved
military forces, icebr[eakers would be of limited
benefit.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Russian **[icebreakers add little
military value]{.mark}** in terms of any theoretical Arctic naval
combat.]{.underline} Strategic theaters where icebreakers must operate
are largely unfit for surface warfare and warships. These vessels would
be confined to paths carved, and routes already plowed would refreeze
without constant icebreaker traversal. In addition, icebreakers turn
solid ice sheets into dangerous stretches of large, floating chunks of
ice, so even cleared paths are not without risk. Surface warships would
therefore lack freedom of movement and be sitting ducks for aerial,
undersea, and shore-based enemy forces. Moreover, [[even if icebreakers
**were to be armed**]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves, [[they would be
ineffective]{.mark}]{.underline} warships. They are massive and ungainly
beasts, built for power and to crush ice rather than to maneuver ably.
This lack of inherent maneuverability is compounded by the presence of
ice in any environment in which icebreakers are needed. (The Navy has
stated that even the complete loss of icebreaker support in the Arctic
would have "minimal impact" on its responsibilities).

[Russian [icebreakers are **not critical** to the country's
navy]{.mark}]{.underline} because they facilitate Arctic naval surface
warfare. Rather, they are strategically essential because Russia's
principal shipyards, Northern Fleet, and only access route to the
Atlantic Ocean without a major chokepoint are all located in or traverse
the Arctic. Icebreakers allow Russian surface warships to enter and exit
the country's most important naval bases and reach the Atlantic Ocean.
This is a necessity that has no comparison for the United States.

Furthermore, [the bulk of Russian [icebreakers]{.mark} and icebreaker
missions [carry out non-military duties]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
economy and shipping activity of the Russian Arctic dwarfs that of
America's far north. And, as a petro-state, Russia is keenly interested
in developing Arctic fossil fuels to maintain future revenue streams. As
such, Russia's icebreakers are integral to maintaining Arctic shipping
lanes and port access as well as providing emergency response, rescue,
and law enforcement capacity. These are the core functions for which
such vessels are needed in the U.S. Arctic as well, but in much smaller
numbers.

In many respects, talk of an "icebreaker gap" emulates the "missile gap"
fervor of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Alarmed by the launch of
Sputnik and reports of the speedy development of Soviet intercontinental
ballistic missiles in the face of perceived U.S. stagnation, Americans
became hyper-focused on comparing missile counts between the two
countries. But, as noted by Greg Thielmann of the Arms Control
Association, this "focus on simple side-by-side numerical comparisons
was misplaced; the more important question was whether the U.S. ability
to threaten devastating nuclear retaliation was really in jeopardy."
That is, the key policy locus was not how many missiles the Soviets had,
but how many the United States needed to achieve its goals and best
maintain national security. (It must also be noted that the missile gap
did not actually exist at all). Similarly, the number of icebreakers
possessed by Russia has no significant bearing on the number the United
States needs, nor on how these vessels should be deployed. The unique
character of its own Arctic territory is the critical metric.

A defense impetus for the construction of U.S. icebreakers is, however,
more than just spurious grounds for icebreaker procurement: [[poor issue
framing]{.mark} can beget [poor policy]{.mark}, and poor policy can
[**exacerbate existing vulnerabilities or create new
ones**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[First, if [expensive icebreakers]{.mark} are purchased and built with
the expectation that they contribute to U.S. defense, the [Navy]{.mark}
will be pressured to [utilize them]{.mark} [regularly]{.mark} for Arctic
surface [warfare exercises]{.mark} and the sailing of warships through
the Arctic]{.underline}. Given the lo[w military tension in the region
and the general impracticality of surface warships in icy waters, this
[would entail **significant** waste of naval assets and]{.mark} [funds
that could]{.mark} more fruitfully [contribute]{.mark} to national
[security **elsewhere**]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly if Duncan's
vision of a year-round Arctic defense presence is realized.

Second, [constructing icebreakers with prominent defense expectations
risks meaningfully diverting them from their core functions once built,
which are: emergency response, law enforcement, research, and
facilitating northern commerce. [If an icebreaker has to]{.mark} take
several weeks to be party to a naval exercise or [lead a warship on a
simple Arctic]{.mark} "sail through," [that is time the vessel is
unavailable for what it is actually needed for.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Icebreakers contribute]{.mark} to U.S. Arctic security by providing
human, economic, and environmental security, [**not** by meaningfully
enhancing]{.mark} northern [defense capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consequently, efforts to frame these vessels in military terms risk
degrading American security both in the Arctic and elsewhere.

The Consequences of an Icebreaker Gap

[[Thankfully for Washington, the consequences of this icebreaker gap for
U.S. defense are often **misunderstood or
overstated**]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, many of the specific military
challenges that China or Russia might pose in the Arctic are independent
of icebreakers and best dealt with in other ways. These include denying
the United States access to the region, missile strikes against the
homeland, the ability to move forces from the homeland, and
demonstrating U.S. strength against challenges.

[It is **not clear** how Russia or China would leverage icebreakers to
exclude the United States from the region, or how the United States
would utilize icebreakers to overcome such attempts.]{.underline} Take
the concern of Russia denying access along the Northern Sea Route
(setting aside the limited trans-Arctic shipping to date and modest
future projections). The Russian ability to do this stems primarily from
their growing missile, air, and surveillance capabilities deployed
within their own territory. As Mathieu Boulègue observes, the Russian
Northern Fleet will likely be able to perform some sea denial missions
"at a limited operational tempo." Yet "the majority of its assets are
not Arctic-specific, operating beyond the region and in other strategic
directions." [I[ncreasing the numbers of U.S. icebreakers would **not
overcome** the Russian shore-based area-denial challenge.]{.mark} In the
event of a crisis, naval surface [vessels]{.mark} operating behind
slow-moving icebreakers [would be,]{.mark}]{.underline} Andreas Kuersten
notes, [["**sitting ducks**]{.mark} for aerial, undersea, and
shore-based enemy forces."]{.underline}

[[Icebreakers would play a marginal role in countering other military
challenges to the United States emerging from the region]{.mark}.
Missiles fired from the Russian Arctic toward the United States would
traverse over the Arctic. [The status of what the DoD terms the "aging
North Warning System" is a **greater concern** from this perspective
than a lack of icebreakers.]{.mark}]{.underline} Similarly, while
Russia's icebreakers are important for its Northern Fleet's ability to
operate in and through the Arctic, [the number of U.S. icebreakers has
little bearing on this. Addressing Russia's ability to project power
into the North Atlantic, the DoD Arctic strategy **focuses on other
capabilities**. These include cooperation with Great Britain and Norway
on P-8 patrols, NATO air policing missions from Iceland, and a
recognition that establishment of Joint Force Command Norfolk helps to
protect the North Atlantic sea lines of communication to
Europe.]{.underline}

Nuclear weapons remain a perennial problem, but [their strategic value
is little affected by the relative number of icebreakers.]{.underline}
The 2019 DoD annual report on China worries that Chinese civilian
research --- presumably some of which would be undertaken by icebreakers
--- could support efforts to deploy "submarines to the region as a
deterrent against nuclear attacks." Turning to Russia, the bulk of its
naval nuclear deterrent capability is based in the Kola Peninsula. Much
of Russia's military activity in the Arctic is dedicated to defending
this capability. As Austin Long and Brendan Green show, during the Cold
War the United States relied on a combination of sensors, information
processing, submarines, and other anti-submarine warfare assets to track
Soviet nuclear-powered submarines armed with ballistic missiles (SSBNs).
To be sure, technology has not stood still. Yet tracking Russian and
Chinese SSBNs in or in transit to the Arctic today would involve a
variety of U.S. capabilities beyond or already with access to the
Arctic. If anything, diminishing sea ice might undermine the ability of
SSBNs to remain hidden. [[More generally, the U.S. has relied on its
nuclear arsenal for decades **to deter nuclear threats**. It is unclear
why Russia or China possessing more icebreakers would undermine that
deterrent.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Others have argued that U.S. icebreakers are necessary to signal
resolve. For instance, Sabrina Shankman reports that more than a dozen
polar and military experts concluded that "if a rival state decided to
encroach on the U.S. exclusive economic zone . . . or step up a military
show of force," then the "presence --- or absence --- of an icebreaker
could . . . be a telling message of strength or weakness." Presumably,
though, a U.S. ability to respond with more lethal subsurface or aerial
assets would constitute a telling message

Second, [the implications of relative numbers of icebreakers look
different when considering the vastly different Arctic contexts,
particularly for the United States and Russia. According to the Arctic
Institute, Russia has roughly 24,140 kilometers of coastline and two
million inhabitants in the Arctic. The Economist highlighted that, all
told, Russia has "at least half of the Arctic in terms of area,
coastline, population and probably mineral wealth." The **Russian
economy depends** heavily on oil and natural gas, including from the
Arctic, for its federal budget and exports.]{.underline}  As noted, a
sizeable portion of [Russia's strategic **nuclear deterrent is based in
the Arctic**. Russian interests dictate a large number of
icebreakers.]{.underline} By comparison, the [United States has roughly
4,057 kilometers (2,521 miles) of Arctic shoreline and approximately
68,000 people living in the Alaskan Arctic. Oil and gas extraction, even
when including the non-Artic portion, makes up a very **small
percentage** of the U.S. economy. The U.S. nuclear triad is not
dependent upon basing or SSBN patrols in the Arctic.]{.underline}

A third problem with focusing solely on counts of U.S. capabilities is
that it ignores the role of U.S. allies and partners. Seven of the eight
Arctic nations are either NATO allies or NATO enhanced opportunities
partners (six of which have some icebreaking capacity). Non-Arctic
allies, such as the United Kingdom, have interests and assets relevant
to the region as well. These states' capabilities and geographic
locations shape the Arctic security environment. For example, Canada
currently operates two heavy and four medium icebreakers and the
Norwegian Armed Forces' Joint Headquarters is located in the Arctic.
Rebecca Pincus explains how, "carefully calibrated," the "NATO-Russia
Council could be a useful forum for dialogue on security topics in the
Arctic." The contribution of specific allies and partners will no doubt
be more relevant to some problems than others. Even if they are not able
to directly contribute to a particular issue, allies and partners can
free up U.S. time and resources to focus elsewhere. They can also help
improve situational awareness and manage tensions more broadly to
minimize dangers and create opportunities in and near the North American
and European Arctic.

[Finally, [icebreakers do not give states the ability to claim resources
that will become available as climate change leads to less ice
coverage.]{.mark}]{.underline} [["]{.mark}Most Arctic territory and
resources are solidly [**within the jurisdictions** of Arctic
states]{.mark},"]{.underline} writes Kuersten. This is not the 19th
century, when prospectors or military forces could stake claims to new
territory. For example, Douglas Porch recounts how preoccupation with
"effective occupation" led French military forces in Africa to sacrifice
basic prudence in a "desire to steal a march on international
competition." There should be no rush --- and is no need --- to repeat
these mistakes. [Indeed, the Pentagon's recent Arctic strategy notes
that even "Russia has generally followed international law and procedure
in establishing the limits of its extended continental
shelf."]{.underline}

To be sure, icebreakers are necessary to access polar areas even as ice
cover diminishes. They are an important element of Arctic sovereignty as
a result. However, [the number that other countries possess does not
affect the number that the United States requires to provide access to
its exclusive economic zone.   [It is also **unlikely** that a country
would use icebreakers to stake a claim to the U.S. Arctic.]{.mark}  If
it did, capabilities other than icebreakers would be better suited to
dislodging them should diplomacy fail.]{.underline}

A Better Way to Think About Arctic Defense

As the United States approaches the potential of competition extending
to the Arctic, it should place the region in a broader geopolitical
context, consider a broader set of tools to advance U.S. interests, and
carefully weigh the opportunity costs of pushing the Coast Guard to take
on a central role in regional competition

The best way to deal with China and Russia in the Arctic is to address
disputes in their own backyards. Most of the pathways to a great-power
crisis that could end up affecting the Arctic stem from crises outside
the region. [Engaging Russia and China elsewhere rather than focusing on
specific capabilities in the Arctic, including icebreakers, will thus
have **salutary effects**]{.underline}. [The nominal Defense Department
approach is to enhance a combat-credible forward presence in Eastern
Europe and the Indo-Pacific. By deterring a conflict there, the logic
goes, the Arctic is **less likely** to suffer negative "strategic
spillover." A fixation with the number of icebreakers, or ice-hardened
vessels more generally, as part of competing with Russia or China in the
Arctic can **lead to unnecessary investments** and divert military
assets better utilized elsewhere.]{.underline} Alternative approaches
might focus on some form of grand bargain or a more restrained U.S.
foreign policy to alleviate tensions. The hope of this approach is that
it might broadly reduce competition. That would then also have benefits
for the Arctic.

#### Non-UQ \-- Trump wants Finland's big icebreakers

Institute with a research focus on Arctic shipping, 6/25/25, "U.S. in
Talks to Buy 15 Icebreakers from Finland, Trump Says at NATO Summit,"

U.S. efforts to expand the country's icebreaker fleet continue to pick
up steam.

[[At the NATO summit]{.underline}]{.mark} in The Hague President [[Trump
confirmed that the U.S. was in negotiations with Finland to buy up to 15
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark} from the country, including acquiring a
used vessel currently available.

[["I want to buy icebreakers, you are very good at
icebreakers,"]{.underline}]{.mark} he said in response to a media
inquiry from Finland during a press conference.

[["You are the 'King of Icebreakers', you make 'em good, really
good]{.mark}. So we negotiated for 15 icebreakers, one of them is
available now, it's 5-6 years old, and we are trying to buy it, and
trying to make a good deal."]{.underline}

Recounting his meeting with Finnish President Alexander Stubb in March
2025, [[Trump said:]{.mark} "I actually made him an offer. There is a
used icebreaker, and we negotiated. [We need icebreakers in the
U.S]{.mark}. and if we could get some inexpensive ones then I would like
to do that, they'll fix it up and make it good."]{.underline}

#### Trump's icebreaker plan solves the aff -- it's possible and already in motion.

SEA AIR SPACE 2025 --- While [[it's "exciting" to hear]{.mark} President
Donald [Trump **promise dozens** of new, big
icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, current assessments show that eight or
nine of that size are necessary for polar operations, a senior Coast
Guard officer said this week.

"Whenever your boss is interested in 40 icebreakers, you are very happy,
right? I mean, this has been something that we've been trying to do for
a long time," Vice Adm. Thomas Allan, the Coast Guard's acting deputy
commandant for operations, said at the Sea Air Space conference Monday
in response to a question from Breaking Defense.

"I will tell you that when you look at what the strategic studies have
said for the Coast Guard, I kind of go back to that eight or nine
\[number\], right? Eight or nine big, heavy icebreakers --- at least
three of them in that role," he said, echoing a fleet size determined in
a 2023 analysis.

In addition to the "at least" three heavy icebreakers, Allan said
elsewhere during a polar security panel that the Coast Guard would need
at least another three or so "medium" polar-capable icebreakers.

Still, he emphasized, "I'd just say [it's very exciting to see your boss
point towards a vision that we've had for a long time."]{.underline}

The US currently operates a single heavy polar icebreaker, a medium
polar icebreaker, a recently acquired converted commercial polar
icebreaking vessel, and more than two dozen smaller icebreaking-capable
vessels down to tugboats that operate in the Great Lakes and elsewhere
in North America.

[[The Coast Guard]{.mark}, together [with the Navy, is]{.mark} in the
beginning **stages of [reconstituting its heavy icebreaker
fleet]{.mark}** for the high north [through the P]{.mark}olar
[S]{.mark}ecurity [C]{.mark}utter program]{.underline}, which aims to
eventually deliver four or five ships. [[\[and\]]{.mark} A separate
[A]{.mark}rctic [S]{.mark}ecurity [C]{.mark}utter initiative is
envisioned as adding another four or five medium polar
icebreakers.]{.underline}

[But [Trump raised the prospect of the US building or buying 40]{.mark}
"big" [icebreakers]{.mark} back in January]{.underline}, amid his call
for Canada to become America's 51st state.

"So, we take care of their military. You know, we ordered --- we're
going to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers. Big ones. And all
of a sudden, Canada wants a piece of the deal. I say, 'Why are we doing
that?' I mean, I like doing that if they're a state, but I don't like
doing that if they're a nation," Trump said in a speech in North
Carolina on Jan. 24.

Then [in March, Trump said the US was "**in the process of ordering** 48
icebreakers,"]{.underline} again followed by a reference to Canada
becoming a state. In the same remarks, he noted that Russia has "about
40" icebreakers.

After those comments the White House declined to provide details to
Breaking Defense about what the 40-something-ship acquisition ---
presumably a multi-billion-dollar project, and one not currently in any
public projected budget plans --- would look like, but National Security
Council spokesperson Brian Hughes said, "[President Trump's [statement
sends a clear signal]{.mark} to industry and the world [that America
is]{.mark} **serious about [maintaining a presence]{.mark}** [in the
Arctic]{.mark} to secure our economic and national
security.]{.underline}

"[[This administration is prioritizing building icebreakers]{.mark} as
part of their initiative [to **revitalize America's**]{.mark} **maritime
and [shipbuilding industries]{.mark}**,]{.underline}" Hughes said.

A few days later, [the White House listed a contract from the Coast
Guard for "dozens of heavy icebreaker ships]{.underline}" as among its
weekly "wins," but linked to a story from Breaking Defense about a
nearly \$1 billion contract to Bollinger Shipyards for the design and
construction of the first ship in the Polar Security Cutter program. (On
the outside, the Congressional Budget Office said in August it would
take about \$15 billion total to procure a maximum of nine Polar
Security Cutters.)

On Monday, Allan did not address a question about any recent
conversations between the Coast Guard and the White House, and an NSC
spokesperson did not respond to a request for additional information for
this report as of press time.

But Allan did suggest that [[it's possible to get to the 40-ship
figure]{.mark} Trump has used if you take into account other vessel
types from America's full icebreaker fleet]{.underline}, including those
smaller ships used for continental operations, which are not suitable
for the high north.

Adding aspirational numbers of new hulls of those ships along with
larger heavy icebreakers, he said, "well, you get to that 40 number
pretty quick. Because that's what we need, we think, to make sure that
domestic operations continue and that we are poised to have that
presence in the Arctic and Antarctic."

After this report was published, the Coast Guard provided a statement to
Breaking Defense on Thursday suggesting the 40-something figure would
come from a mix between large and smaller icebreakers.

"[[The **Coast Guard will deliver** on the President's intent]{.mark} to
acquire at least 40 new icebreakers]{.underline}," the statement said.
"The Coast Guard is the sole federal agency responsible for icebreaking
to assure U.S. access and sovereignty in the polar regions and enable
the flow of maritime commerce in the Great Lakes and America's inland
waterways.

WASHINGTON --- In late June, [the [US Coast Guard announced]{.mark} that
[one of]{.mark} its [two]{.mark} premier [icebreakers]{.mark}, Polar
Star, [had entered dry dock]{.mark} to undergo work that will extend its
service life]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the Coast Guard's other
icebreaker, Healy, was preparing for its upcoming voyage to patrol the
Arctic.]{.underline}

Then, disaster: Towards the end of July, [[Healy suffered an electrical
fire]{.underline}]{.mark}, derailing the ship's planned patrol and
forcing it to return to Seattle. And just like that, [[the entirety of
America's]{.mark} polar [icebreaking]{.mark} [fleet had been
sidelined]{.mark},]{.underline} hampering its ability to project power
and maintain a visible presence in the High North for the foreseeable
future.

It's a [[worst-case scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the fact the [[US
is on thin ice]{.mark} with its fleet of ships capable of navigating the
[Arctic has been a concern for a long time]{.mark}]{.underline} --- a
concern that earlier this summer helped drive the White House to
announce a new pact aimed directly at strengthening the icebreaker
fleet.

In a July 10 trilateral announcement, [the [leaders of the United
States, Canada and Finland said they will work together to build and buy
icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, a type of ship uniquely designed to
clear out the kinds of polar ice that would otherwise sink or severely
damage unprepared vessels. Under the likely-backronym of the Icebreaker
Collaboration Effort Pact, [[or ICE Pact]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
agreement fits into the kind of region-specific, bi- and tri-lateral
agreements the Biden administration has pursued in recent years.

But where [[ICE Pact stands out is its nature as the rare strategic
pact]{.mark} in which the United States' capabilities lag behind that of
its partners]{.underline}. For the US, it's an outreach to two NATO
allies, both of whom are highly proficient in polar navigation, [for
[help in a race with Russia and China]{.mark} for a stronger presence in
a region that experts have for years predicted will become vital to
economic success and national security.]{.underline}

"Our partnerships in the Arctic are unique because there is such a
concentration of like-minded and highly capable allies such as Canada
and Finland. They have a wealth of experience operating in the Arctic
and do so with a high level of proficiency," Navy Adm. Daryl Caudle, the
four-star officer in charge of US Fleet Forces, told Breaking Defense.

"[ICE Pact is just another example of how our partnerships with our

he continued. "By leaning on our partners who have a longer history and

During the NATO summit, the three leaders offered only preliminary
details about ICE Pact, promising a joint memorandum of understanding
would be released later this year outlining future plans. But the
agreement reflects how seriously Washington and its allies are taking
future transits in and through the High North.

Asked about U.S. trade relations with Britain, Trump gave his thoughts
on why Canada should become the 51st U.S. state. The U.S. is losing too
much money to Canada on trade deficits, he said, and joining the U.S.
would mean lower taxes (and no U.S. tariffs) for Canadians.

\"Why are we paying all of that money to Canada when, you know, we ---
we could use it ourselves, right? You know, we ordered --- [[we're going

deal. I say, \'Why are we doing that?\'\" Trump said. \"I mean, I like

annual Operation Deep Freeze deployments to resupply McMurdo Station in

### 1NC\-\--Navy Fails

#### The Navy is washed -- poor performance for a list of reasons

Shelby **Oakley 25**, Director of the US Government Accountability
Office, 4/8/25, "U.S. Navy Shipbuilding Is Consistently Over Budget and
Delayed Despite Billions Invested in Industry,"
https://www.gao.gov/blog/u.s.-navy-shipbuilding-consistently-over-budget-and-delayed-despite-billions-invested-industry,
Troh

[[Despite nearly **doubling** its shipbuilding budget over the last 2
decades, the U.S. Navy hasn't increased its number of
ships]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Navy and Department of Defense work with
private companies to build ships and have invested billions of dollars
to support the shipbuilding industrial base. But even with this
investment, the industry has not been able to meet the Navy's
goals---jeopardizing the Navy's ability to protect the U.S. from growing
maritime threats and competition.

Why are shipbuilders not keeping up with the Navy's goals?

Private companies play a key role in building and repairing Navy ships.
But for decades, these companies haven't met the Navy's goals for
increasing the size of its fleet. This contributes to the Navy's
shipbuilding programs being consistently over budget and behind
schedule. [[Estimated delays for some ships are as much as **3
years.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Navy Shipbuilding Delays in Months for Ships Under Construction, as of
September 2024

In our February report, we found that shipbuilders face two key
challenges in meeting the Navy's goals:

[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}, some [[shipyards lack the physical
**space** needed to complete the volume of work the Navy wants in the
time it wants.]{.mark} Some [shipyards]{.mark} also [have **aging
infrastructure** that can delay efforts.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[shipbuilders don't have enough
**workers** to meet the Navy's demands]{.underline}.]{.mark} These
companies struggle to recruit and retain staff, especially those with
the skills needed to do the work.

The Navy is aware of these challenges, but it consistently plans to
build more ships for the fleet than the private shipbuilders have been
able to achieve. The Navy isn't considering shipbuilders' capacity in
its plans for growing and maintaining its fleet.

The Navy and the Department of Defense are taking steps to help private
companies with shipbuilding. For example, they've invested billions to
help increase shipbuilding capacity, such as helping with infrastructure
improvements at shipyards and workforce development.

DOD Investments and Budget Requests for the Shipbuilding Industrial
Base, FY 2014-2028

But when we looked closer at these efforts, we found that the Navy
hasn't fully assessed whether its investments are working as intended,
yet it continues to expect that the shipbuilders will achieve different
results. Without this assessment, [[the Navy is **poorly** positioned to
address shipbuilding challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} that are affecting
its mission.

in referring to an autonomous "Arctic order," even if the region has
separate institutions and arrangements that can be conceptualized as a
regional regime complex or governance system. [The rules‐based, liberal
international order has also been the order of the Arctic. Hence,
Russia's assault on the liberal international order, with the
prohibition against the use of force at its core, was inevitably, but
apparently unintentionally, also an attack on the formal and informal
arrangements that consolidated Russia as an Arctic
superpower.]{.underline}

Evidently, [[Russia was more successful in diminishing its Arctic status

than revising them.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Moscow's
failures]{.underline}]{.mark} may not be permanent, and **[the [worst

encouraging more involvement from the non‐Western BRICS group in Arctic
affairs (see, e.g., Edvardsen, 2023d) and finds cautious support in
China, which may have its own ambitions in a China‐led "Belt and Road
order" (Flockhart & Korosteleva, 2022, p. 471). Globally, the
rules‐based international order is in a deep and perhaps irreversible
crisis. International relations theory, as well as somber historical
lessons, warn that the profound structural changes in the world may well
result in an entirely new world order---or, to Russia's liking, in
multiple orders.

Its Arctic Fleet Needs to Function in Eastern Arctic;

[[Russia has more icebreakers than any other
country]{.underline}]{.mark} but far fewer than it needs to ensure
passage in the Eastern portions of the Northern Sea Route critical to
its trade with China as well as to ensure that the Russian navy can
continue to dominate the North.

[Moscow has announced an ambitious icebreaker construction
program]{.underline}, but both longstanding problems in Russian
shipyards and Western sanctions make it unlikely to achieve its
much-ballyhooed goals.

[As a result, some Russian navy ships in the north are now forced to
drift at night to avoid running into ice or aground in inadequately
mapped portions of the Northern Sea Route, opening the way for China to
take the upper hand.]{.underline}

Russia has more icebreakers than any other country, something it
celebrates and that most other countries see as guaranteeing Russian
dominance in the region. [[Most of these ships,]{.mark} however, [are
small and diesel,]{.mark} rather than nuclear, powered and [lack the
most advanced electronics]{.mark} and are [incapable of helping
ships]{.mark} far from the Russian coast]{.underline} (see EDM, November
25 \[1\], \[2\]). [This means that [Moscow's ability to keep the]{.mark}
Northern Sea Route ([NSR]{.mark}) [operational]{.mark} year-[round is
still far from guaranteed]{.mark},]{.underline} and [Russia [faces
particularly serious difficulties]{.mark} in the route's Eastern portion
and to its North]{.underline} (see EDM, June 12, 2023). These areas are
now cooling rather than warming, given the irregular pattern of climate
change, undercutting Moscow's ability to trade with China and, more
generally, advance its expansive claims to the Arctic seabed (The
Barents Observer, August 6; AANII, August 8).

[Moscow's [challenges with its shortage of]{.mark} deep-sea [icebreakers
have become increasingly evident]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
underscored by its much-ballyhooed icebreaker construction program,
which Russian experts acknowledge is unlikely to materialize in the near
future. Additionally, Deputy Commander of Russia's Northern Fleet Vice
Admiral Oleg Golubyov recently admitted that ships in the eastern Arctic
often drift at night to avoid sea ice or the risk of running aground in
poorly surveyed areas. This occurs because they lack the necessary
icebreaker escorts to operate safely 24 hours a day (IAREX.ru March 31;
Profile.ru, November 9; Arctic Today, November 22). [[Such a danger is
very real]{.mark} and was [highlighted several years ago]{.mark} when a
[large number of ships]{.mark}, civilian and naval, were [trapped in the
ice for weeks]{.mark}]{.underline} (The Barents Observer, November 9,
2021; Window on Eurasia, December 30, 2021).

Golubyov's admission is indicative of Russia's often ignored problems
with the NSR, the Arctic Ocean more generally, and its fleet of
icebreakers. In an interview with that fleet's newspaper, Na Strazhe
Zapolyarya, Golubyov says that this year, ships under his command
encountered heavy sea ice in the Eastern Arctic waters between Wrangel
Island and the Russian Federation as well as beyond toward the Bering
Strait. Lacking icebreaker support, these Russian naval vessels had no
choice but to drift at night and move only when the two helicopters
accompanying them could survey a safe route forward during daylight
hours. Neither he nor others want to rely on such an arrangement and it
is one that Moscow hopes to overcome by building more icebreakers,
despite all suggestions that global warming will make that costly
exercise unnecessary. Such problems are compounded, Golubyov continues,
by the fact that in the region, much of the seabed remains unmapped and
shallow waters can trap ice, posing particular dangers to ships.

The Russian admiral's words call attention to environmental issues in
the NSR that are all too often ignored. While global warming has left
the Western half of the NSR ice-free for most of the year, the situation
in the Eastern half is very different. In fact, temperatures have cooled
in recent years, and ice has become a larger problem (Profile.ru, May
31, 2022; The Barents Observer, November 16, 2022; Window on Eurasia
August 8). To counter the cooling temperatures, keep the NSR open and
trade with China flowing, and allow Russia to project power far into the
Arctic, Moscow has announced an ambitious program of icebreaker and
ice-capable ship construction (see EDM, September 11, 2018, September 4;
Profile.ru, May 31, 2022; East Russia.ru, August 1, 2022). Longstanding
and intractable problems in its shipbuilding branch, including
corruption and the impact of sanctions, and cutbacks in government
financing as a result of the war in Ukraine, however, means that Russia
is unlikely to be able to build anything close to the number of needed
vessels, Moscow experts say (Kommersant, October 12, 2023; EDM, December
12, 2023; Window on Eurasia, April 4). All the more so due to the
development of its shore-based support facilities along the NSR, which
has nearly stopped (see EDM, September 11, 2018, June 4, 2022).

This has created a new geo-economic and, therefore, geo-political
situation, as far as icebreakers and the Eastern Arctic are concerned.
[While [Russia maintains a dominant position]{.mark} internationally, as
far as icebreakers are concerned, [its dominance is increasingly a
facade more than real]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the one hand, most of its
icebreakers are smaller and capable of handling ports but not open sea
routes, as Golubyov acknowledges. On the other, Moscow is increasingly
concerned with keeping the Eastern Arctic, where ice remains and even is
currently on the increase, and thus needs more icebreakers to maintain
trade with China and lend credence to Moscow's expansive claims to the
Arctic Ocean and its mineral-rich seabed (see EDM, October 29, 2019).
Both these claims and the kind of difficulties Golubyov's remarks
suggest Moscow is facing in the eastern Arctic, however, are leading
other countries to consider building more icebreakers of their own and
be in a position to challenge Russia in the future. Among those doing so
are Canada, Finland, the United States, and China (The Barents Observer,
July 10, July 12; TRT Russian, July 15; see EDM, November 25). All of
them can see that Russia is overextended as far as icebreakers are
concerned, not only keeping vessels in service long after they should be
scrapped but also failing to meet deadlines for building new ones
(Window on Eurasia, July 18). The Russian dominance that intimidated
them earlier is now dissipating (see EDM, June 12, June 26, 2019).

Among these countries, the one that has made the most rapid progress is
China, which has not only built more icebreakers in recent years than
any of the others but, even more importantly, has significantly reduced
the time it needs to construct each of them (see EDM, July 23, 2020).
For now, Moscow hopes that China, its ally against the West, will help
it maintain its presence in the Arctic, given Chinese interest in
Russia's use of the NSR. Russian officials fear that at some point,
China will assume a dominant position in the Arctic and be able to elbow
Russia aside (see EDM, July 12, 2018, June 12, 2019, March 6, 2021,
February 1, 2022). That is all the more likely in the coming years,
given that Moscow experts say that Russian yards will not be able to
build anything compared to the number of ships, icebreakers in
particular, that Moscow needs to maintain its current status (Window on
Eurasia, July 18).

[[Russia's inability]{.mark} to reliably send ships through the ice in
the Eastern Arctic [is a clear sign]{.mark} of the beginning [of a major
geopolitical shift]{.mark}.]{.underline} Western governments will have
little choice but to deal with it if they do not take timely action and
[expand their own icebreaker fleets as well.]{.underline}

To replace its aging icebreakers with a new, larger fleet of ships, in
2013 [[the Coast Guard initiated its **Polar Security Cutter**]{.mark}
program [to construct]{.mark} a series of new heavy
i[cebreakers]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} The Coast Guard solicited bids in
2017, and the first contract was awarded in 2019, to VT Halter Marine,
with an expected delivery date of 2024 for the first ship. **[[But the
program has gone poorly]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [While most icebreakers
are custom designed using proven concepts, the team of TAI and Halter
Marine used a German icebreaker that has yet to be built as a 'parent
design', intending to modify]{.underline} it for Coast Guard needs.
[**[After five years]{.mark},** this modification still isn't complete;
as of July 2024 **[the design was only 59% done]{.mark}**, and
**[construction has not yet started]{.mark}.** While the original
delivery date for the first ship was 2024, that has now been pushed back
to 2029.]{.underline}

In a report and testimony, [the GAO described some of the problems
during the program:]{.underline}

[[U.S.-based]{.mark} designers and [shipbuilders]{.mark} generally
**[lacked experience]{.mark}** designing and building heavy polar
icebreakers.]{.underline}

[[The ship design is complex]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} that it used [a
**specialized steel alloy**]{.mark} that **required technical study and
development of new welding** procedures before use.]{.underline}

[[The shipbuilder]{.mark} overestimated the extent to which it could
leverage the original design and had to make significant design changes
to meet government specifications]{.underline}, according to program
officials. The shipbuilder also made some design errors, such as
selecting the wrong height for the lowest deck of the ship, which
required significant, late redesign to correct.

COVID-19 restrictions limited the extent to which the shipbuilder could
collaborate and consult with its domestic and international partners.

[Notably, VT Halter Marine [lost **\$256 million**]{.mark} between 2017
and 2021, after which it was bought for a song (just \$15 million) by
Bollinger, which took over the icebreaker contracts.]{.underline}

[Originally, the Polar Security Cutters were expected to cost
\$800-\$900 million per ship (\$1.1-\$1.3 billion in 2024 dollars), but
[current cost estimates are closer to \$1.7-1.9 billion]{.mark}, and
given that construction hasn't started yet, [this is likely to
rise]{.mark}]{.underline}. And it's unclear if that 2029 date will be
hit either. The GAO report notes that "[the shipyard is completing, on
average, approximately three percent of functional design and six
percent of transitional design every six months. [At that design
completion rate**, it would take the shipyard approximately eight years
to complete functional design."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[By contrast, a Finnish shipyard can build a]{.mark} heavy [icebreaker
for]{.mark} just [a few hundred million]{.mark} dollars, [and]{.mark}
deliver it [within two years]{.mark}, instead of 10 or more.
[However,]{.mark} [the Coast Guard opted]{.mark} not to pursue a foreign
manufacturer, instead [choosing a U.S. shipyard]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The culprit here isn't the Jones Act, but another protectionist
shipbuilding law that requires Naval and Coast Guard ships to be built
in U.S. shipyards. It's possible to waive this requirement via
presidential authorization, but there hasn't appeared to be much
interest in this. Waiving this requirement and allowing the Coast Guard
to buy icebreakers from Finland would likely save over a billion dollars
per ship, as well as years of construction time.

ballooned to \$**5.1** billion]{.mark} **from an initial estimate of
less than \$2 billion**, according to projections from Congressional
Budget Office and other watchdogs.]{.underline}

["The Coast Guard originally aimed to have the first PSC (polar security

been **delayed repeatedly**]{.mark} and is now expected to occur no
earlier than fiscal year 2029]{.underline}," Ron O'Rourke, a specialist
at the Congressional Research Service, testified Tuesday at the House
Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security.

[[The new cost estimate]{.mark} from the Congressional Budget Office [is
**60% more**]{.mark} than the estimate the Coast Guard gave in
March.]{.underline}

It gets worse. Shelby Oakley of the Government Accountability Office
testified that the functional design is not close to completion.

The U.S. battle to build an icebreaker

[Polar [icebreakers are expensive and complex]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
the U.S. hasn't built one since the Polar Star. The U.S. awarded a
contract to build a new heavy icebreaker, the Polar Sentinel, in 2019.
[[The first of three]{.mark} new planned ice breakers, it [isn't
expected to be finished until **after 2030**]{.mark}. The
[C]{.mark}]{.underline}ongressional [[B]{.underline}]{.mark}udget
[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}ffice [[estimates]{.mark} that [the
cost]{.mark}]{.underline} for the three ships [[will reach]{.mark} \$5.1
billion, [**60% higher** than original projections]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The U.S. icebreaker program has fallen so far behind Russia partly
because the Arctic faded as a U.S. priority after the Cold War. That
began to change around a decade ago, said Rebecca Pincus , director of
the Polar Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank.

But [momentum on building icebreakers has been hampered by the Coast
Guard's **small budgets** and lack of political power]{.underline}, said
Pincus, who has worked on Arctic policy at the Coast Guard and the
Defense Department. The Coast Guard has moved from department to
department before most recently becoming a part of Homeland Security.

"Ice breaking was very far away from the Homeland Security focus after
9/11," she said.

Russia has maintained greater focus on the region in recent decades, in
large part because the country's economy depends on it. The Arctic
accounts for over 80% of Russia's natural-gas production and around 20%
of its crude-oil production, according to the International Energy
Agency. The world's largest nickel producer is based in a former Russian
Arctic gulag. Russia has been opening the Northern Sea Route , which
connects Asia to Europe, to move these raw materials to markets and
develop offshore energy fields.

[[America's ability to catch up is hampered by a **domestic shipbuilding
crisis**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the past three years, China has built
47% of all the world's ships , and the U.S. just 0.1%, according to
United Nations data. The lack of commercial shipbuilding means [there
are [few]{.mark} established domestic [supply chains]{.mark} for naval
vessels, which are routinely built late and over budget]{.underline} in
shipyards [suffering from [recruitment shortages, high costs]{.mark}, a
lack of investment]{.underline} and other issues.

Mika Nieminen , the chief executive of Rauma Marine Constructions, a
Finnish shipyard that makes icebreakers, said there is a lot of interest
in icebreakers but [[not many shipyards that can make
them]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"The capacity will be the question---where are they going to be made,"
he said.

[Few shipyards have expertise on how ships react in winter conditions
and behave on the ice]{.underline}, he said. [Many don't have experience
working with the thickness of the steel required for
icebreakers,]{.underline} which has to be able to resist fractures in
extremely low temperatures.

The company that is building the Coast Guard's new Polar
icebreaker---Bollinger Shipyards, based in Lockport, La.---had to invest
\$20 million in facilities and infrastructure to make the vessel after
taking over construction from another company it had bought. That
company---VT Halter Marine, based in Pascagoula, Miss.---had racked up
more than a quarter billion dollars in losses on the project without
starting construction.

A number of shipyards in the U.S. have closed since 1976, when the Polar
Star was built, including the ones that built that icebreaker and the
Healy. Many senior shipyard workers from that era have retired.

"If we're building icebreakers every 30 years, all the know-how goes
away," said Åke Rohlén , who ran the icebreaking divisions of several
commercial shippers and is now at Arctic Marine Solutions.

As [the [United States]{.mark} approaches the potential of competition
extending to the Arctic, it [should]{.mark} place the region in a
broader geopolitical context, consider a broader set of tools to advance
U.S. interests]{.underline}, [and **carefully [weigh the opportunity
costs]{.mark}** of pushing the Coast Guard to take on a central role in
regional competition.]{.underline}

[[The best way to deal with China and Russia]{.mark} in the Arctic
[is]{.mark} to **address disputes [in their own backyards]{.mark}**.
Most of the pathways to a great-power crisis that could end up affecting
the Arctic stem from crises outside the region. **[Engaging]{.mark}
Russia and China** **[elsewhere]{.mark}** [rather than]{.mark} focusing
on specific capabilities in the Arctic, including [icebreakers]{.mark},
**[will thus have salutary effects]{.mark}.**]{.underline} The nominal
Defense Department approach is to enhance a combat-credible forward
presence in Eastern Europe and the Indo-Pacific. By deterring a conflict
there, the logic goes, the Arctic is less likely to suffer negative
"strategic spillover." [A fixation with the number of icebreakers, or
ice-hardened vessels more generally, as part of [competing with
Russia]{.mark} or China in the Arctic [can]{.mark} lead to **unnecessary
investments and [divert military assets better utilized
elsewhere]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Alternative approaches might focus on
some form of grand bargain or a more restrained U.S. foreign policy to
alleviate tensions. The hope of this approach is that it might broadly
reduce competition. That would then also have benefits for the Arctic.

Local defense challenges in the Arctic will remain, of course. Those
should be addressed using political and economic diplomacy and refining
military concepts and capabilities as necessary[[. Resisting]{.mark} the
temptation [to engage in]{.mark} numerical comparisons of
[icebreakers]{.mark} [will help avoid]{.mark} **alarmist views that may
contribute to [tensions]{.mark} [and]{.mark}, at worst, the
[militarization]{.mark} of the region** if the Pentagon deploys new
resources in response to that perceived vulnerability.]{.underline}
Other concerns, such as China's interest in building airports in
Greenland, are best dealt with by diplomatic, information, and economic
tools rather than military platforms (though trying to buy Greenland
probably isn't the best approach). Even if a larger defense role in the
Arctic is warranted, the United States should focus first on developing
concepts for existing assets, determining what infrastructure requires
modernization, and carefully examining how initiatives elsewhere can
benefit regional security and minimize challenges emerging from the
region.

As the climate changes, human activity in the Arctic (and Antarctic)
will increase. There is a need for additional icebreakers to augment the
Coast Guard's law enforcement, search and rescue, disaster response,
situational awareness, and scientific support missions, among others.
Indeed, "polar icebreakers support 9 of the Coast Guard's 11 statutory
missions." The only two not currently supported are "illegal drug
interdiction and undocumented migrant interdiction." Many of these tasks
clearly advance U.S. national security.

[But placing [icebreakers]{.mark} in a central defense role [comes with
**opportunity costs**]{.mark}. If the United States does field multiple
new icebreakers, those ships may find **[defense missions tak]{.mark}ing
[up more]{.mark} and more of their [time]{.mark}.** As a result, [they
will be **less able to support the myriad of homeland security and
important scientific missions**]{.mark} they will be increasingly called
upon to perform. It is worth noting]{.underline} the Coast Guard
identified a need for six new icebreakers in 2013 (and gaps in support
for polar missions in 2010), before the public discussion in Washington
shifted to the return of great-power competition broadly and in the
Arctic specifically[. Coast Guard polar security cutters will have
plenty to do without additional tasks to offset a perceived military
vulnerability arising from Russian and Chinese icebreakers.]{.underline}

[The underlying science has been well understood since before World War
II, when [scientists discovered]{.mark} that [sound]{.mark}, which
travels faster through warmer water, [tends to bend toward cooler
layers]{.mark}, where it moves more slowly.]{.underline}

[This means that [as the surface of the water is warmed]{.mark} by
climate change, **[sound]{.mark} [will]{.mark} begin [mov]{.mark}ing
more [sharply downward]{.mark} toward cooler layers of water**. [This
will make it **harder** for sonar operators]{.mark} [listening for
sub]{.mark}marines at a distance to hear noises generated by their
targets.]{.underline}

According to Dr. Gilli, who has worked at ETH Zurich and is taking up a
new research position at the Hertie School in Berlin, [[this effect
could have important strategic implications]{.mark}. He said countries
like [Russia and China]{.mark} could [take **advantage**]{.mark} of
these environmental shifts to [deploy submarines]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
parts of the [oceans where the changes are more
pronounced]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Dr. Gilli noted that other methods of detecting submarines, like
tracking the tiny disturbances in Earth's magnetic field that occur when
the submarines move through the water, are effective only at shorter
distances

"If it becomes even more difficult to detect them," he said, "then the
result is that things become harder for navies that are on the
defensive."

**[[There could be consequences in terms of nuclear
deterrence.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[The United States, Russia, China and other nuclear-armed [states **base
their defenses on**]{.mark} **[the idea that]{.mark} ballistic missile
[sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark} [are hard to find]{.mark} and destroy**. If
climate change makes it even easier for them to hide, then the threat
they represent, and thus their deterrence value, may be seen as more
credible.]{.underline}

But some experts caution against overstating the effects caused by
climate change. Tom Stefanick, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings
Institution, notes that [[submarine operators]{.mark} must [grapple
with]{.mark} so many other environmental factors, from **[shipping
noises to crackling Arctic ice]{.mark}**, that it is not practical to
focus only on climate change when making strategic
predictions.]{.underline}

"The amount of variability is so great that a long-term trend of the
sort they are talking about would be washed out," Dr. Stefanick said.

[Russian state-owned nuclear energy corporation]{.underline} [Rosatom
and]{.underline} [Chinese shipping company]{.underline}
[Hainan]{.underline} Yangpu NewNew Shipping [announced]{.underline} in
2024 that [they would cooperate on operating an all-year-round container
shipping route through the Arctic]{.underline}. Since then, shipping
interruptions at flashpoints from the Panama Canal to the Red Sea have
thrown the global economy into turmoil. Worse, [[increasing
military]{.mark} and technological [collaboration between Beijing and
Moscow has escalated]{.mark} the [security threats]{.mark} facing the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies.

[To counter this cooperation, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[should consider]{.underline}]{.mark}
working with its Canadian allies to open and maintain an equivalent
shipping route --- [[an]{.underline} "[Ice Canal]{.underline}" [across
the Northwest Passage]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [to bolster their
commercial and strategic presence in the region.]{.underline}

All-[[year-round shipping]{.underline}]{.mark} through the Arctic [would
require]{.underline} [significant infrastructure]{.underline} and
promises high costs for fuel, equipment, and manpower. But these
investments would generate considerable economic returns. The Northwest
Passage can reduce shipping distance between London and Tokyo by about
3,780 nautical miles, or approximately 7,000 kilometers. And
[[the]{.mark} priceless [strategic benefits]{.mark} of bolstering U.S.
and allied nuclear security should [incentivize public cooperation with
the private sector]{.mark}]{.underline}, defraying costs further.

Moscow and Beijing recognize the region's significance. Their agreement
involves building five ice-class container ships and investing in
infrastructure such as deep-water ports and refueling and repair
facilities along the Northern Sea Route along Russia's Arctic coastline.
These [container ships are dual-use]{.underline}, meaning they can be
used for commercial purposes and military sealift operations such as
weapons systems and troop transport. [The initiative signals that Russia
and China prioritize regional mobility, allowing them to cooperate on
increasing the profitability of Russia's Arctic coastline and on
strategic interoperability across the region.]{.underline}

[[A competing dual-use project]{.underline}, [led by the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} [and Canada, [would help engage Japan,
South]{.mark} Korea, and other Arctic NATO allies [in strategic and
economic cooperation across the region]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[The first step to opening this route is to find out what we do not
know]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Because very few people have been to the
Northwest Passage in winter, [[assessments are largely based on
theoretical models]{.mark} and historical and satellite
data]{.underline}. [These means of data collection are insufficient to
create a reliable and detailed map of the geographical and seasonal
shipping challenges]{.underline}. [[Shipping along the Northwest Passage
will require initial efforts to]{.underline} **[map sea ice
movements]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[wind
patterns]{.underline}**]{.mark} throughout the year.

Canada has 20 vessels in its icebreaker fleet, two of which are heavy
icebreakers. These are expected to be replaced with two new polar
vessels capable of operating in moderate multiyear ice conditions in
2030. To complement research, approximately five years of all-year-round
icebreaker presence is needed to map the geographical locations and
timing of choke points created by multiyear ice and wind patterns.

The data collected by the icebreaker presence will be used to identify
locations for deploying unmanned aerial vehicles or helicopters
supplying ice and weather data to vessels and aircraft transiting the
Northwest Passage. Icebreakers will be on call all year round to assist
vessels transiting ice choke points. This would allow for safe
all-year-round passage of container ships and give U.S. and Canadian
forces invaluable real-world experience operating jointly and across
domains in Arctic conditions.

Additionally, a permanent Western presence along the Northwest Passage
would give U.S. and allied militaries invaluable situational awareness
and the ability to respond swiftly to the outbreak of conflict in
critical strategic areas. This is particularly important because the
shortest routes for Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles are
through the poorly surveilled airspace north of the Arctic Circle.

In the Atlantic, [the Greenland--Iceland--United Kingdom gap and the
Barents Sea are the primary strategic locations for Russian
nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarines]{.underline}.
**[[Insufficient underwater surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}** in these
areas, [as well as the Bear Gap between Norwegian Svalbard and
Scandinavia and along Greenland's east coast]{.underline}, [[allows
Russian SSBNs]{.underline} [more freedom to operate
undetected]{.underline}, [strengthening Russia's second-strike
capability toward North America and]{.underline} ]{.mark}[therefore
[weakening U.S. deterrence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

On the eastern end of the supercontinent, [the Bering
Strait]{.underline} --- the entrance to the Pacific between Russia and
Alaska --- [has become a critical chokepoint]{.underline}. [Russia has
fitted submarine bases near its eastern port]{.underline} city of
Vladivostok [with hardened shelter pens]{.underline} and additional
repair and maintenance facilities to avoid dependency on Barents Sea
facilities. [Russian-Chinese base-sharing arrangements]{.underline} at
the entrance to the North Pacific [strengthen
interoperability]{.underline}. [And Beijing and Moscow have signaled
their willingness to extend cooperation to their strategic nuclear
forces with a joint air patrol with four nuclear-capable bombers in
Alaska's air defense identification zone.]{.underline}

CHINA ANGLING FOR 'INCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH GREENLAND,' INTEL COMMUNITY
SAYS

A container route along the Northwest Passage would do much to establish
presence, connectivity, and interoperability between Canada, the U.S.,
and other allies with Arctic interests and represent an important
countermove to Russia-China collaboration. Canadian leadership in
establishing and operating the new container route is advisable to avoid
ramping up international tensions, thanks to its rights and
responsibilities as a coastal state.

[[As Moscow and Beijing prepare for dual-use
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} from the Barents Sea to the Bering
Strait, [[it is imperative for purposes of deterrence and situational
awareness to establish an all-year-round North American strategic
presence]{.underline}]{.mark} from the North Atlantic to the North

[[The U.S. needs to better secure]{.mark} its [Arctic]{.mark}
territories and waters]{.underline}, while working more with its allies
to better secure theirs. [Although the Arctic has been relatively
peaceful since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}---a recurring mantra
has been "high latitude, low tensions"---[U.S[. military forces need to
be prepared for **unexpected conflicts** that can **erupt
quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline}, like Putin's full-scale invasion of
Ukraine and Hamas' devastating attack on Israel.

The U.S. military's ability to operate effectively in the Arctic is
impeded by various factors. As we described in a recent report, chief
among these are the fact that it has so few assets that can operate in
the region and so little infrastructure there, particularly in
comparison with Russia. [Increased investments in platforms,
infrastructure]{.underline}, equipment, [communications, [multidomain
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}, and enhanced tactics and training [would
[enable the U.S. to better secure its critical interests]{.mark} in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

These interests span the vast Arctic region: the U.S. needs to work
alongside NATO allies to secure North America's Arctic approaches and
its European allies' long, vulnerable Arctic coastlines and borders with
Russia. It also has a key interest in countering Russian submarines at
the Arctic's edge, where the gaps between Greenland, Iceland, and
Britain are gateways for Russian submarines to enter the Atlantic. The
U.S. also has homeland security responsibilities within its own Arctic
territory and waters, where thousands of Americans live. This area also
harvests roughly half of the nation's seafood, plus substantial amounts
of oil, zinc, and other resources. As sea ice abates during parts of the
year, the Arctic's maritime routes are becoming increasingly important
shortcuts between oceans.

The importance of the region to overall U.S. interests is highlighted in
the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for the Arctic Region,
released in October 2023, and in the 2022 National Security Strategy. It
was also underscored by the U.S. Coast Guard's publication of its Arctic
Strategic Outlook Implementation Plan just a week ago. Although Coast
Guard operations in the Arctic are particularly visible to civilians,
the Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Space Force also conduct
training, exercises, and operations there.

[[Challenges from both Russia and China underscore the urgency of
improving Arctic military capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Russia was
building up its Arctic military and civilian capabilities in the years
before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. [This included
re-opening Arctic bases]{.underline} that had closed after the Cold War,
[conducting more]{.underline} extensive training and
[exercises]{.underline}, [stationing more forces in the
Arctic]{.underline}, and operating more throughout the region[. It also
has over 50 polar icebreakers]{.underline}, far more than any other
country. The U.S., by comparison, currently has two, though more are
being acquired.

[China has also become increasingly involved in the region.]{.underline}
Both of its polar icebreakers have been extensively collecting
information on the Arctic's physical environment. [It has
invested]{.underline}, or tried to invest, [in Arctic
propertie]{.underline}s from Greenland and Europe to Siberia, and has
secured the diplomatic status of an observer at the Arctic Council. In
an effort to achieve a greater role in the Arctic, China has alternately
referred to itself as a "near-Arctic state" and to the Arctic as a
shared environment belonging to all nations, neither of which is
accurate. [Beijing's increasing collaboration with Moscow across all
areas has also been deepening in the Arctic.]{.underline} The two
countries have operated naval vessels together in the approaches to

law enforcement agreement that facilitates further Arctic collaboration.

[For the U.S., [**Arctic-specific** capabilities are needed because of
the effect of the region's unique environment on
operations.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Any system that was not specifically
designed for that environment is likely to fail]{.underline}: fuels gel,
materials shatter, lubricants freeze, and batteries do not work. The
environment is even harder on people, who struggle to just to survive in
extreme temperatures. Arctic operations are further impeded by the
region's tremendous internal distances and its remoteness from the rest
of the world. Sparse infrastructure that is relentlessly battered by the
elements, limited satellite coverage, and unique electromagnetic effects
that degrade communications also contribute to challenges. Climate
change is also degrading coastal infrastructure and contributing to less
predictable conditions.

U.S. military services can also make themselves more effective by more
extensively emulating the tactics, training, and equipment choices of
allies that specialize more in Arctic operations than the U.S. does.
These include Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and even
non-Arctic Britain and the Netherlands. Expanding already substantial
training, exercises, and operations alongside these nations can improve
both U.S. capabilities and interoperability.

Our report on the U.S. military's ability to protect U.S. national
interests and people in the Arctic primarily focused on the Coast
Guard's operations there, but also considered those of other services.
It recommends investing in additional Arctic-capable platforms and
infrastructure. Beyond vitally needed icebreakers, other investments
include a deepwater port in Nome, more ground transportation
infrastructure, more communications infrastructure, and systems that
contribute to [[multidomain]{.mark} awareness]{.underline}. Given the
destructive power of the Arctic environment, these investments [[will
require more intensive and frequent maintenance]{.underline}]{.mark}
than is required for comparable systems at lower latitudes.

\"[[**Trade-related developments** are evolving]{.mark} and uncertainty

[[Worries over future]{.mark} U.S. [tariffs are **clouding the

being imposed on trade.

### 2NC\-\--Trump kills Trade

#### Trade war is ongoing because of tariffs, retaliation from tariffed allies means the possibility of trade growth is 0

Francesco **Conteduca** et al **25**, Senior Economist and Directorate
General for Economics, Statistics and Research, Economist in the
Emerging Markets and World Trade division at the Bank of Italy, 5/6/25,
"Roaring tariffs global impact 2025 US trade war",

//maeve

On 2 April 2025[[, following tariff increases in February and
March]{.underline}]{.mark} on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China
covering steel and aluminium and cars[, [the US announced]{.mark}
sweeping so-called "[reciprocal" tariffs affecting most of its trade
partners]{.mark}]{.underline}. The structure of these new measures,
rather than being driven by actual discrepancies between US tariffs and
those imposed by trade partners, is instead guided by the ratio of trade
deficits to imports, with a minimum increase of 10 percentage points --
far exceeding market expectations (Baldwin and Barba Navaretti 2025,
Evenett and Fritz 2025).

[[Understanding the implications of these measures requires a clear view
of the tariff landscape]{.mark} prior to President Trump's second
term]{.underline}. Yet accurately measuring applied tariffs remains a
challenge (Caliendo et al. 2023, Teti 2024). To overcome the limitations
of the widely used WITS database -- [[particularly its omission of
tariffs imposed through trade disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} -- we use as
a starting point the 2019 CEPII MAcMap-HS6 database (Guimbard et al.
2012) and incorporate detailed data on tariff escalation between the US
and China during Trump's first term from Fajgelbaum et al. (2024), as
well as tariff reductions granted under Biden's term.

Crucially, the 2 April tariffs do not align with the levels that would
close the gap between US import tariffs and those faced by US exports
abroad, as computed using our dataset. In fact, the new tariffs are
consistently higher than what would be required to achieve genuine
reciprocity (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Tariff increases based on reciprocity versus the 2 April tariff
increases

Source: own elaboration based on data from CEPII MAcMap-HS6, WITS,
Fajgelbaum et al. (2024), CEPII BACI, and official US documents.\
Notes: tariff increases based on reciprocity are obtained by taking the
difference between the sector-level effective tariff rate faced by the
US in foreign markets and the sector-level effective tariff rate on US
imports.

Southeast Asian economies such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia would
be among the most heavily affected. For the EU, the 2 April tariffs
would raise the effective tariff rate to around 17%, up from below 2%
before the beginning of Trump's second term[[. China's initial
retaliation to the US' announcement triggered a tit-for-tat
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} of symmetric tariff hikes, **[[which led
the two countries to reach a bilateral tariff rate of around
125%.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

On 9 April, Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs were partially suspended for a
90-day grace period. During this window, a flat 10 percentage point
increase will nevertheless apply to all trading partners -- excluding
Mexico, Canada, and China, which are the targets of country-specific
measures. Imports of pharmaceutical goods and electronics -- including
semiconductors and a range of consumer products -- were temporarily
exempted, but sector-specific measures have already been announced and
are expected to be implemented in the coming months. The exemptions also
extend to many refined and raw mineral products, for which no additional
tariffs have been proposed so far.

Given their magnitude -- exceptionally high even by historical standards
-- [[the new tariffs are likely to have significant effects on
macroeconomic aggregates]{.underline}]{.mark}, trade patterns, and the
structure of global value chains (GVCs). Drawing on our own database, we
construct baseline tariff levels reflecting the period before Trump's
second term. From this baseline, we design three scenarios to assess the
potential impact of the 2025 measures.

The first is a milder scenario involving the February and March
measures, the observed tariff escalation with China, and the suspension
of the reciprocal tariffs announced on 2 April. In this 'status quo'
scenario, we also include the retaliation implemented by China and
Canada. This reflects the situation as of the time of writing (20
April).

[[The 'full' scenario,]{.underline}]{.mark} instead, assumes no
suspension of the 2 April tariffs, combined with the extension of
tariffs to pharmaceuticals and electronics, as already announced. We
assume that these products [[will face tariff increases in line with
those previously imposed on steel, aluminoum, and
cars]{.underline}]{.mark} -- i.e. a 25 percentage point hike.

Lastly, [**[we also evaluate the possibility that affected countries
retaliate]{.underline}** **[by matching US tariff
increases]{.underline}**]{.mark} at the sector level ('full +
retaliation').

[There is no greater current threat to the liberal economic order than
the trade war between China and the United States.]{.underline}
America's prohibitive tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, emulated by
the European Union and others, are the most recent salvo. If President
Trump is re-elected, he promises an additional 60% tariff on China, and
10% on all trading partners, which may deliver the coup de grace to a
struggling World Trade Organisation. The outcome is difficult to
predict. A trade war between superpowers will not end in one of the
parties submitting. Nor will China disappear like the Soviet Union. That
leaves [two possibilities: compromise or escalation that results in
economic separation.]{.underline} Outright decoupling would not end
trade battles on third markets, but would upend global production chains
and carry huge economic costs. Cooperation on climate between the two
largest emitters would become even more fraught than it is already.
Ominously, the widening schism could strain alliances, embolden
revanchists, allow regional arms-races to accelerate and make it harder
to contain nuclear proliferation -- all trends that are already
painfully evident today. In the worst case, a conflict in Taiwan, the
South-China Sea or Ukraine could widen to global war. A major conflict
among nuclear powers would, in Henry Kissinger's words "bring casual­ties
and upheavals impossible to relate to calculable objectives." Yet,
unfortunately, decoupling is where the trade war appears headed. So, is
a trade deal that avoids that outcome possible? [Both the US and China
remain vitally interested in trade, including with each other. That
suggests the answer is yes. The US remains an open economy, inextricably
bound up with the rest of the world. Despite egregious protectionist
measures directed at China, US tariff revenue is still only 3% of
imports, lower than that of the EU. Some 41 million US jobs are tied to
international trade. The largest US firms derive over 40% of their
revenues overseas, rising to over 60% in the technology sector. The
Americans public is more supportive of trade than the French or Germans.
Furthermore, the economic peril of China's rise is not what many in
Washington have come to believe. The US economy has outgrown the other
advanced countries over the last two decades, reflecting its innovative
capacity and ability to attract and integrate migrants. In contrast,
China's economy, where income per capita (adjusted for purchasing power)
is still just one-third of the US,]{.underline} may be nearing the
limits of what its large state sector can deliver[. The International
Monetary Fund projects China's GDP to grow at just 3%-4%, about 1.5%
faster than the US over the next five years. But that gap may narrow.
China's population is aging fast and projected to fall by 100 million by
2050, and by 600 million by 2100, so it may never establish a meaningful
economic lead over the US. China has become the workshop of the world
but is also far less reliant on exports than it once was]{.underline}.
Although China's share of world export markets has increased by 1.5
percentage points since the start of the pandemic, the sharp
housing-induced demand slowdown in China and the fiscal-induced demand
acceleration in the US account for nearly all the increase. Adjusting
for the cycle, China's exports are no longer on an explosive path, and
its share of world markets appears to have stabilised near 14%, a level
it achieved eight years ago. Sectors such as electric vehicles may prove
an exception, but the 'China Shock' on global industry has almost
certainly peaked. **[China's global current account surplus, once the
main source of global imbalances, has declined sharply.]{.underline}**
It helps that China has liberalised its trade regime: its most-favoured
nation average applied tariff is only 7.5% (the EU's is 5.1%). China has
concluded trade agreements covering about 46% of its trade, a proportion
in line with the EU and the US, and is now the largest export market for
most countries. [In 2020, a new Chinese law eliminated joint venture
requirements and opened vast new service sectors to foreign investors.
China has consistently conformed with WTO panel rulings that found
against it and has joined a compulsory arbitration agreement, a strong
signal that it is committed to multilateral rules]{.underline}. The
significance of these trends, some of which are quite recent, is still
sinking in. Hawks in Washington have certainly not been swayed by them
and nor has China's slowdown prompted big reforms in Beijing. But
provided the rivals remain engaged with the world, the conditions for a
deal on trade could materialise. Its essence would be rules that make
subsidies transparent and less trade-distortive, in exchange for a
phased tariff reductions. Such a deal could mark a return to enforceable
multilateral disciplines and reactivation of the WTO Appellate Body.
Faced with climate crisis, nuclear proliferation, the constant risk of
escalation and miscalculation, and many other common threats, China and
the US do not have long to resolve their differences. Refraining from
trade adventurism would be a good start.

### 2NC\-\--No Free Trade

#### Free trade under Trump will always be unsuccessful 

Simon **Schropp 24,** Simon Schropp is an International Trade Policy
Analyst for Sidley Austin LLP, a leading law firm in international trade
law and WTO litigation. He has previously worked for the WTO Secretariat
and as a research fellow investigating legal and economic issues of the
WTO, 6/19/24, "International trade policy under Biden: The new
Washington consensus and its discontents",
https://www.wita.org/atp-research/trade-biden/ //maeve

After four years of President Trump's slash-and-burn trade policy, the
bar for the incoming Biden administration could hardly have been lower.
Trump's "America First" bravado was an ungainly amalgam of tax hikes
(against foes and friends alike), bilateral power plays (for example,
Trump ordered the "renegotiation" of the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement
\[KORUS\], otherwise threatening termination of what he termed "a
horrible deal"), and a retreat from international trade cooperation
(among others, spurning the megaregional Trans-Pacific Partnership
\[TPP\] and undermining the World Trade Organization \[WTO\]). [[Trump's
trade policies]{.mark} not only [ruffled the feathers]{.mark} of many
[of America's closest trade partners,]{.mark} but they [were also
economically ineffective.]{.mark}]{.underline} Notably, they failed to
benefit even those sectors and locations that his tariffs were supposed
to protect. Ironically, the Trump tariffs did not change China's
behavior one bit.

It came as no small surprise when President Biden, despite calling
Trump's trade actions "disastrous" and "reckless," not only failed to
repudiate those policies, but actually amplified them. This is not to
say that Trump's and Biden's versions of economic nationalism are
equivalent. [[Trump's style was]{.mark} all sticks and no
carrots---[belligerent, scattershot, and ad hoc]{.mark}. Biden's
version, albeit no less fervent, is soft-footed and polite---more
carrots than sticks; commentators have called it "polite protectionism"
or "pragmatic unilateralism." Most notably, Biden provides a coherent
intellectual superstructure that ties his administration's trade policy
to its overall international economic strategy.]{.underline}

In a scarcely noticed but consequential speech in July 2023, National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan outlined the Biden administration's
economic ideology. Sullivan blamed the United States' most pressing
challenges---namely, a hollowed-out industrial manufacturing base,
dramatic economic inequality between rich and poor and between coast and
heartland, the economic and military rise of China, and the climate
crisis---on a number of factors including hyperglobalization, unfettered
deregulation, naive beliefs in trickle-down economics and market
efficiency, and trade liberalization as an end in itself. Drawing a
sharp contrast to the 1990s-era policy package known as the
"[[Washington Consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}"---championed by the US
Treasury, IMF, and World Bank---that according to Sullivan
[[encapsulates **the idolatry of free markets and liberalized
trade**]{.mark}, he declared that the Biden administration stood for a
"New Washington Consensus." To address the above-mentioned challenges,
the administration's novel paradigm is aimed at achieving supply-chain
resilience in strategically important sectors, a return to former
manufacturing grandeur, more equitable growth that benefits American
workers, rapid decarbonization and a successful transition to green
technologies, and a containment of China's military and economic
might.]{.underline}

Few Americans would disagree that these are worthy goals. It is,
however, the implementation of these goals that warrants scrutiny:
Sullivan stated that this "New" Washington Consensus was to be
effectuated by a policy bundle including (1) a "modern American
industrial strategy," (2) selective partnerships with economic allies,
and (3) various policies aimed at curbing the ascent of China. In the
following, I argue that [each of these three strategies is fraught with
peril]{.underline}. In addition, I show that [[this alleged new
"consensus" does not reflect unanimity]{.mark} between the United States
on the one hand and its trade allies on the other, but rather
constitutes a unilateral move to undo over six decades of trade
liberalization.]{.underline} In the final section, I propose an
alternative to the so-called "New" Washington Consensus---[[an
alternative set of policies that achieves better results]{.mark} for the
United States [and remains in the four corners of a rules-based global
trading order.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The economic and political environment doesn't meet the requirements for stable free trade 

Mark **Glick and** Gabriel **Lozada 25**, Mark Glick is a law and econ
professor at the University of Utah. Gabriel Lozada is an associate
professor of economics at the University of Utah, particularly in
microeconomic theory, 4/2/25, "The failed assumptions of free trade",
https://www.thesling.org/the-failed-assumptions-of-free-trade/ //maeve

[[There are five assumptions]{.underline}]{.mark} (two explicit and
three implicit[) [needed to support the free-trade
argument]{.mark}]{.underline} as depicted in the diagram above.

[[The first]{.mark} explicit [assumption is that there is full
employment in the domestic economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is assumed
that when workers are displaced by imports, they can easily become
re-employed at the same wages. If this is not the case, then removal of
a tariff causes a loss of social surplus (a loss of economic rent) in
the domestic labor market, which the analysis based on the above figure
misses because it only depicts the output market.

[[Yet the assumption]{.mark} of full employment [does not hold
empirically]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the contrary, here is a revealing
graph from an article by Paul Krugman (2019).

[[Trade job loss has been 74 percent in
manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[is one of the few sectors
where non-college-degree-holding males could earn a good
living]{.underline}]{.mark}. Contrary to free trade theory, the U.S.
lost jobs, primarily in high tech, computer parts, electronics, and
durable goods manufacturing. Between 2001 and 2018, EPI estimates that
the U.S. lost 1,132,500 jobs to Chinese imports but only gained 175,800
jobs to exporting industries to China.

In their work on the China Syndrome, Autor, Dorn and Hanson (2013) show
that the impact on labor comes "less from its economy-wide impacts than
from its disruptive effects on particular regions." These disruptions
would not have occurred if full employment, and frictionless
re-employment, characterized the economy.

[[The second]{.mark} explicit [assumption]{.mark} that undergirds the
free trade theory is that there are no externalities]{.underline}.
Pisano and Shih (2012) analyze the total impact of the loss of
manufacturing jobs in particular regions. The impact can be enormous,
stretching far beyond a manufacturing plant. [[Entire]{.mark} towns [or
cities can be hollowed out. A plant closure can destroy numerous small
businesses]{.mark}, the tax base, and many complementary
businesses]{.underline}. In addition, workers in the nontraded sector
are hurt by an increased labor supply, and their bargaining power is
undermined. None of these changes in social surplus are captured in the
Samuelson and Nordhaus figure above.

Besides these two explicit assumptions, policy analysts who advocate
free trade often make three more implicit assumptions, as enumerated by
Fletcher (2011). These are also flawed.

[[The first implicit assumption is that comparative advantage results in
short-run efficiencies]{.mark} that cause long term growth and
development]{.underline}. [[The problem with this idea]{.mark} in
practice [is that comparative advantage is a static
theory]{.mark}]{.underline}. The inside joke among economists is that
each country should do what it is best at doing, and what underdeveloped
countries are best at is underdevelopment.

The evidence is strongly contrary to this assumption. Indeed, no country
has successfully developed under free trade. In his book Kicking Away
the Ladder, Ha-Joon Chang reviews the development history of every
developed country and shows that every one of them used significant
tariffs as part of its development strategy. Joe Studwell, in How Asia
Works, shows that all of the Asian Tiger countries used trade protection
with government industrial policy to develop. So free trade is not a
development strategy. It is a static policy that can impede development.

[[The second implicit assumption that undergirds free trade theory is
that freely-floating currencies will keep trade balanced,]{.mark}
limiting imports and ensuring that benefits exceed loses. [This is not
true, as trade with the U.S. has not been balanced for many
decades]{.mark} per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.]{.underline}

After the U.S. liberalized capital markets in the 1980s, trade deficits
were supported by capital movements into the United States. Foreigners
have used their dollars to purchase U.S. securities and real estate,
which does not increase U.S. productivity because it generates no new
capital formation (at least directly).

[[The third implicit assumption is that the U.S. provides adequate
compensation for job losses]{.mark} caused by international trade. **[On
the contrary,]{.mark}** Lori Kletzer (2001) analyzed [the U.S. policy
response to trade-induced job losses]{.mark} and found it to be
[woefully inadequate]{.mark}.]{.underline} By contrast, countries that
have strong labor support policies (like strong social safety nets) are
generally much better able to garner the benefit from international
trade without suffering social and political costs from it.

[**[In the absence of these five assumptions, the free trade argument is
completely undermined]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

mechanism. [[How Trump handles]{.underline}]{.mark} North Korea, [[China

**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[trilateral

emerging at Munich. The Japanese and South Korean foreign ministers
spoke jointly about the connectivity of the Euro-Atlantic and
Indo-Pacific security theatres, noting that the nature of a peace
settlement in Ukraine will directly affect East Asian security. Trump's
team, meanwhile, could not have gone farther to stress how it considers
the two theatres as unambiguously separate. Trump's
[[penchant]{.underline}]{.mark} [[for dealing]{.underline}]{.mark}

[**[whittle]{.underline}**]{.mark} the

'Commitment to Consult' agreed at Camp David. Second, US willingness to
mediate between Japan and South Korea has previously created space amid
the two nations' historic animosities and contentious political issues.
With the US in the room, the Japan--South Korea relationship can be
framed on more strategic grounds where they can converge. Polling also
suggests strong domestic support in both countries for security
cooperation with a US presence to stabilize the Korean peninsula and
contain China's rise. However, unlike his predecessors, Trump [[did not
facilitate diplomacy between]{.underline}]{.mark} the two
[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2018, relations between Japan and
South Korea had reached their lowest point since normalization in 1965.

The political scene in Canada is changing as I write. With the key

are asking themselves which of the candidates to replace Justin Trudeau

Trump.]{.underline}

The End Game

What is the end game of the trade wars that Trump is initiating with
Canada, Mexico, China, and, coming soon, the E.U.? The U.S.'s allies are
open to an honest and truthful discussion of ways to build a better
alliance. [[Trump]{.mark} seems to be intent on [building an **American
Empire**, in which the U.S.]{.mark} dominates economically and
[seizes]{.mark} [territory]{.mark} as it pleases. The U.S. will face
economic resistance, as Canada and Mexico are demonstrating, as will
Europe. [There will be **growing opposition** to]{.mark} this costly
imperial vision within **[the U.S.]{.mark}** As a Canadian from birth
and an optimist by nature, I will bet on the alliance.]{.underline}

U.S. President [Donald [Trump is pushing his allie]{.mark}]{.underline}s
in North American and Europe [[to the brink of a]{.mark} global [trade
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} More than anyone, Canada finds itself under
the gun: Facing not only 25 per cent steel and aluminium tariffs but
general 25 per cent tariffs on top of those. Its leaders are on a
lobbying blitz to avert economic warfare.

[One of [Canada's best offers to America is one that has gotten]{.mark}
precious [little attention]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ottawa, alongside
Helsinki, hopes to usher in a new era of American
shipbuilding---building a new fleet of modern icebreakers to help North
America defend its Arctic waters. But [[Trump's trade]{.mark} jingoism
[could throw that whole plan into doubt.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In the [[president's rationale for his]{.mark} bellicose trade [policies
with his]{.mark} northern [neighbors]{.mark}, he has [repeatedly
insisted that control over the Arctic is an urgent priority]{.mark} for
his White House.]{.underline} Access to the critical minerals in the
high north and a desire to counter Chinese control of the ice-laden
waters are both reasons, the administration has said, to annex Canada
and seize Greenland.

But [[Trump has inherited a plan to help America access]{.mark} and
defend the resource-rich north [and]{.mark} [compete with Beijing's
strategic ambition]{.mark} in the Arctic without needing to expand its
borders at all.]{.underline}

This agreement, if followed through, could even help the United States
build out a new shipbuilding yard to produce exactly the kind of ships
its navy desperately needs. [[But if the]{.mark} White [House decides to
pursue its trade war, these places could be put on
ice]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In July, then-President [Joe [Biden announced the signing of the ICE

[[Trump]{.mark} has]{.underline} done more than that -- he has
[[opened]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[Pandora's box]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that might, in time, give the chief justice pause. [The president
has]{.underline} indicated that he has [another target]{.underline} in
his sights: [the]{.underline} very [judiciary]{.underline} over which
Roberts presides.

"He who saves his Country does not violate any law," Trump posted on
Musk's X earlier this month, channeling Napoleon Bonaparte. The comment,
combined with overt threats that Trump and his people have made against
judges who dare stand in their way, have prompted a question that
previously would have been unthinkable: is the president willing to defy
the rule of law itself?

"We've seen the many ways in which [[Trump]{.mark} has sought to
[undermine]{.mark} Congress]{.underline}, [and now he's
seeking]{.underline} to undermine [[the judicial
bench]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Nancy Gertner, a Harvard law school
professor. "[This is a president who is arrogating to himself the powers
of a dictator]{.underline}."

For 17 years, until she retired in 2011, Gertner sat as a federal judge
in the district court of Massachusetts. There she dealt with the
defiance of individual defendants.

"I had people who had been sentenced and didn't follow the rules of
their release, for sure," she said.

Not once in almost two decades of service, however, did she have to
confront a public officeholder openly flouting her authority.
"Governmental officials defying the court? It never came up. Literally,
never happened."

Now Gertner is observing [[Trump's belligerence towards the
courts]{.underline} [unfold]{.underline}]{.mark} with mounting concern.
"**[[There's been nothing like this in American
history]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There have been people who threatened
not to obey the law, especially post the civil war, but [[this is
a]{.underline} **[sustained attack on the courts]{.underline}**]{.mark}
we haven't seen before."

### 1NC\-\--No ! To Authoritarianism

#### 5. Authoritarianism isn't an existential threat -- their evidence misunderstands modern autocracies -- empirical data shows that economics and international relations constrains illiberal regimes 

Daniel **Treisman**, 6/3/**25**[,]{.underline} \[Professor of Political
Science at UCLA\], The Conversation, "Autocrats don't act like Hitler or
Stalin anymore - instead of governing with violence, they use
manipulation,"

mm

President Donald Trump's critics often accuse him of harboring
authoritarian ambitions. Journalists and scholars have drawn parallels
between his leadership style and that of strongmen abroad. Some
Democrats warn that the U.S. is sliding toward autocracy -- a system in
which one leader holds unchecked power. Others counter that labeling
Trump an autocrat is alarmist. After all, he hasn't suspended the
Constitution, forced school children to memorize his sayings or executed
his rivals, as dictators such as Augusto Pinochet, Mao Zedong and Saddam
Hussein once did. But [[modern autocrats don't]{.mark} always [resemble
their]{.mark} 20th-century [predecessors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead,
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} project a polished image, [[avoid overt
violence and speak the language of democracy]{.underline}.]{.mark} They
wear suits, hold elections and talk about the will of the people. Rather
than terrorizing citizens, many use media control and messaging to shape
public opinion and promote nationalist narratives. Many gain power not
through military coups but at the ballot box. In the early 2000s,
political scientist Andreas Schedler coined the term "electoral
authoritarianism" to describe regimes that hold elections without real
competition. Scholars Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way use another phrase,
"competitive authoritarianism," for systems in which opposition parties
exist but leaders undermine them through censorship, electoral fraud or
legal manipulation. In my own work with economist Sergei Guriev, we
explore a broader strategy that modern autocrats use to gain and
maintain power. We call this "informational autocracy" or "[spin
dictatorship."]{.underline} These leaders [don't rely on violent
repression]{.underline}. Instead, they craft the illusion that they are
competent, democratic defenders of the nation -- protecting it from
foreign threats or internal enemies who seek to undermine its culture or
steal its wealth. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor [Orbán exemplifies
this approach.]{.underline} He first served from 1998 to 2002, returned
to power in 2010 and has since won three more elections -- in 2014, 2018
and 2022 -- after campaigns that international observers criticized as
"intimidating and xenophobic." [[Orbán]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[preserved the formal structures of democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} --
courts, a parliament and regular elections -- [but]{.underline} has
[systematically hollowed them out]{.underline}. In his first two years
he packed Hungary's constitutional court, which reviews laws for
constitutionality, with loyalists, forced judges off the bench by
mandating a lower retirement age and rewrote the constitution to limit
judicial review of his actions. He also tightened government control
over independent media. To boost his image, Orbán funneled state
advertising funds to friendly news outlets. In 2016, an ally bought
Hungary's largest opposition newspaper -- then shut it down. Orbán has
also targeted advocacy groups and universities. The Central European
University, which was registered in both Budapest and the U.S., was once
a symbol of the new democratic Hungary. But a law penalizing
foreign-accredited institutions forced it to relocate to Vienna in 2020.
Yet [Orbán has mostly avoided violence]{.underline}. Journalists are
harassed rather than jailed or killed. Critics are discredited for their
beliefs but not abducted. His appeal rests on a narrative that Hungary
is under siege -- by immigrants, liberal elites and foreign influences
-- and that only he can defend its sovereignty and Christian identity.
That message resonates with older, rural, conservative voters, even as
it alienates younger, urban populations. In recent decades[, [variants
of spin dictatorship have]{.mark}]{.underline} appeared in Singapore,
Malaysia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Ecuador and Venezuela. Leaders such as
Hugo Chávez and the early Vladimir Putin [[consolidated power and
marginalized opposition with minimal violence. Data confirm this
trend]{.underline}]{.mark}. Drawing from human rights reports,
historical records and local media, my colleague Sergei Guriev and I
found that **[[the global incidence of political killings and
imprisonments]{.mark} by autocrats [dropped significantly]{.mark} from
the 1980s to the 2010s]{.underline}**. Why? [In an interconnected world,
**overt repression has costs**.]{.underline} [[Attacking
journalists]{.mark} and dissidents [can prompt]{.mark} foreign
governments to impose economic [sanctions]{.mark} [and
discourage]{.mark} international companies from
[investing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Curbing free expression risks stifling
scientific and technological innovation -- something even autocrats need
in modern, knowledge-based economies]{.underline}. Still, when crises
erupt, even spin dictators often revert to more traditional tactics.
Russia's Putin has cracked down violently on protesters and jailed
opposition leaders. Meanwhile, more brutal regimes such as those in
North Korea and China continue to rule by spreading fear, combining mass
incarceration with advanced surveillance technologies. But
[overall]{.underline}, [[spin is replacing terror]{.mark}.]{.underline}

## Arctic Tribes

#### Icebreakers pose a threat to indigenous lands

Ashoka **Mukpo**, 11-3-20**20**, \"Ice breakers in the Arctic: Let's
talk Inuit safety (commentary),\" Mongabay Environmental News,
https://news.mongabay.com/2020/11/ice-breakers-in-the-arctic-lets-talk-inuit-safety-commentary/
//nishant

The solitude of the north is changing. George Angohiatok noticed this
quite graphically a decade ago when, after returning to Iqaluktuuttiaq
(or Cambridge Bay, as it was renamed by settlers), he observed an ice
breaker moving through the same frozen waterways he had travelled by
snow machine the day before.

[If the vessel had smashed that open lead through the frozen veneer of
ice a day earlier, he would have been **cut off for at least a few
weeks** until the ice refroze.]{.underline} George wonders whether, even
with his headlights, he would have detected the steam that signals the
transition from ice to water in winter through his goggles.

[The growing presence of **ice breakers worries**]{.underline} George.
[His Inuit ancestors moved east across the Arctic coast of North America
thousands of years ago. Since that time, the waterways have been their
highways, both in summer and winter. Traveling between camps and
villages, the Inuit have followed the wildlife at the heart of their
food security.]{.underline}

The caribou herds of the far northern islands---the Dolphin and Union
herd and the Peary herds---also stride out onto the sea ice during their
migrations between summer and wintering areas. The herds contribute
heavily to the Inuit's essential needs---providing both a source of
"country food" and clothing with fur that is warm beyond compare. In the
past elders have used the leg bones for carving and to build shelters.

[Use of the sea and ice by people has been relatively predictable over
past millennia. Harsh winters and only a few months of open water warded
off all but the most determined visitors.]{.underline} Even a casual
read of Pierre Berton's The Arctic Grail provides a clear picture of
just how challenging these areas are. Unprepared visitors throughout
history have perished.

[But things change. The powerful Finish Polar Class
icebreakers]{.underline} MSV Fennica and MSV Nordica passed this way in
October of 2015, returning home from supporting oil exploration off
Alaska in the Chukchi Sea; both vessels [capable **of ramming** their

### Nuclear Icebreakers bad\-\--1NC

#### Nuclear-powered icebreakers collapse marine ecosystems through radioactive waste.

Qiuwen **Wang** etal. **23**, 2/8/23, Professor, School of International
Law, East China University of Political Science and Law, "Using Nuclear
Energy for Maritime Decarbonization and Related Environmental
Challenges: Existing Regulatory Shortcomings and Improvements," PubMed
Central (PMC), 10.3390/ijerph20042993, :)

[Using [nuclear power]{.mark} to propel [ships offers]{.mark}
"]{.underline}both benefits for regional economic and social development
and risks of nuclear [and **radiological [accidents]{.mark}** and
concerns about radioactive wastes]{.underline}" \[16\]. Although the
prospect of rapid achievement of maritime decarbonization may be very
attractive, [[nuclear reactors on]{.mark} board [ships]{.mark} may also
[pose]{.mark} **potential [risks to]{.mark} the marine
[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[23,45,46\].

First, [the daily operation of nuclear-powered merchant ships not only
brings environmental concerns of perimeter contamination and thermal
pollution but is also not completely free from low-level radiation
release]{.underline}. [A [ship equipped with]{.mark} a nuclear
[reactor]{.mark} is equivalent to a mobile nuclear installation and
carries risks of low-level radiation release, which may **[cause]{.mark}
[persistent]{.mark} low-dose radioactive [contamination of]{.mark} the
marine [environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Fish]{.mark} and marine
mammal [pop]{.mark}ulation[s]{.mark} might **[experience increasing
mortality]{.mark} rates**]{.underline}, as long half-life isotopes
accumulate in the food chain \[47\]. [At the same time,
nuclear-[contaminated]{.mark} sea[water]{.mark} may **[further
contaminate]{.mark} coastal [ecosystems]{.mark}**, such as mangroves,
because of tidal action]{.underline}. [[Moreover]{.mark}, nuclear
reactors on board ships can **[produce large amounts of heat]{.mark}
energy**]{.underline}. [Thermal pollution arising from nuclear ships may
**[affect marine]{.mark} flora, fauna, and [ecosystems]{.mark}** in
nearby waters as water temperature changes can **[fatally damage]{.mark}
marine [life]{.mark}**, change the chemical composition of seawater, and
cause ecological imbalance]{.underline} \[48,49\].

Second, [[nuclear]{.mark}-powered merchant [ships]{.mark} that
[experience]{.mark} maritime [accidents]{.mark} can **[lead to]{.mark}
nuclear [disasters]{.mark} at sea**]{.underline}. [In certain
circumstances such as ship collision, severe machine damage, fire, or
explosions, nuclear-powered merchant ships can experience nuclear
leakage, [causing **severe harm to the**]{.mark} **marine
[environment]{.mark}**, marine ecosystem, and human health]{.underline}
\[37\]. During its maiden voyage, the Mutsu, a Japanese nuclear-powered
merchant ship had experienced a nuclear leakage problem, making local
inhabitants, port authorities, and fishermen strongly oppose its
continued operation \[17\]. After emergent nuclear incidents occur at
sea, the radionuclides may be dispersed near the sea surface: "The
airborne nuclides will diffuse to other area with the atmospheric
motion, and cause the environmental pollution and hazardous results to
human health" \[39\]. Although the likelihood of leakage or spillage
from an overheated reactor is relatively small, negligence in or the
mismanagement of the reactor or the failure of the ship's nonnuclear
components could lead to a rupture of the reactor compartment \[50\].
Research shows that human errors are responsible for most shipping
accidents \[51\]. The working conditions on board ships are more
stressful than those in land-based nuclear installations, and
consequently operators of nuclear-powered ships are more prone to make
errors that lead to nuclear accidents \[52\]. Sometimes, nuclear leakage
from reactors on board ships result in the emergency dumping of nuclear
fuels \[16\].

Third, [radioactive waste from [nuclear]{.mark}-powered merchant
[ships]{.mark} may also be a problem]{.underline}. Although
nuclear-powered merchant ships can achieve zero GHG emissions, in the
course of their operation, [they also **[generate]{.mark} nuclear [waste
that]{.mark} may [cause]{.mark} radioactive marine
[pollution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The use of nuclear propulsion poses
risks regarding the "safe storage for spent nuclear fuel and
decommissioned on-board power plants]{.underline}" \[7\]. In its first
year of operation, [the NS Savannah released **115,000 gallons of
low-level waste** into the ocean]{.underline} \[53\]. "[Radioactive
[wastes are]{.mark} [not biodegradable]{.mark}, [no]{.mark}r is there
any [possibility of removing them]{.mark} from the sea once they have
entered it. These substances vary in their effect, but in general, they
are [absorbed by]{.mark} marine [organisms]{.mark}, often becoming
concentrated as they move up the food chain, and **[affecting]{.mark}
the [growth]{.mark}, reproduction [and mortality]{.mark} of marine
life**]{.underline}" \[47\]. [Research has shown that most of the
pollution damage nuclear power does to the environment arises from the
process of refueling and the disposal of radioactive wastes]{.underline}
\[54\]. Nevertheless, the potential to reduce waste generation and
storage through advancements in nuclear technology remains a promising
aspect. Generation IV technology, in particular, has been designed with
this objective, incorporating features such as increased fuel
utilization and passive safety mechanisms to minimize waste
\[55,56,57,58\]. For instance, sodium-cooled fast reactors can recycle
used fuel, thus reducing waste and bringing benefits of integral
recycling in nuclear waste management in a closed fuel cycle \[59\].
Generation IV and other advanced nuclear technologies present a
promising outlook for addressing waste management challenges in the
future.

[[**International conflict** over fish]{.mark}ery resources]{.underline}
is considered to be a [[growing **security
concern**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Ongoing, [high-profile interstate
fishery disputes]{.underline} are [[sparking]{.mark} concerns of future
**[global fish wars]{.mark}**]{.underline} (note: for the remainder of
this thesis, terms such as fishery conflicts refer to marine fishery
conflicts, excluding conflicts over fresh water species). One of those
ongoing interstate disputes is the so-called 'mackerel war' between
Norway, the European Union (EU), Iceland and the Faroe Islands, which
erupted in 2007 when the northeast Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus)
stock shifted its distribution towards the north-west of the Nordic Seas
and their surrounding waters. The [conflict]{.underline} has had
[**disruptive** social and ecological **consequences**]{.underline}: it
[resulted in the **overfishing**]{.underline} of the mackerel stock,
[undermined the coastal states' management]{.underline} plans, and even
[[contributed to Iceland **withdrawing**]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[**application** to become an [EU]{.mark} member state]{.underline}
(Spijkers & Boonstra 2017). Another prominent example is that of the
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, where [fishers]{.underline} often find
themselves on the [[frontlines of **international disputes**]{.mark}
over **fishery resources** [as **China**]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the
**[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark},
[**[Malaysia]{.mark} and [Brunei]{.mark}** fail to resolve competing
claims over parts of the area]{.underline} (Dupont & Baker 2014).
Although these [fisheries conflicts are **[linked to]{.mark}** a
**larger [territorial struggle]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline}
(with China [increasingly **[militarizing]{.mark}**]{.underline} what it
has determined to be [its]{.underline} [[maritime **s**]{.mark}**phere
[o]{.mark}f [i]{.mark}nfluence**]{.underline}), the [rich fishing
grounds are an important]{.underline}, [strategic commodity for
surrounding states given that fisheries play a **vital role** in
ensuring **food security**]{.underline} in the region (Dupont & Baker
2014). Some scholars even claim [[fish is an]{.underline}]{.mark}
'**[[overlooked destabilizer]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [in the
region]{.underline}, and [that **China's militarization** efforts are a
**power move** intended to dominate marine harves]{.underline}t (Baker
et al. 2016, Thomspon 2019)

Moreover, [environmental conditions]{.underline} that might
[[trigger]{.underline}]{.mark} or [**exacerbate** fisheries
**[conflict]{.mark}** are likely to become more **widespread** in the
future]{.underline}, further [**[heightening worries]{.mark}** about
[impending **security challenges** for **ocean
governance**]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, [changing ocean conditions are
[caus]{.mark}ing [shifts in]{.mark} fisheries [resource]{.mark}s\'
[distribution]{.mark} patterns]{.underline}, 3 [[affecting]{.mark}
potential yields of and **[revenues]{.mark}** generated from exploited
marine species]{.underline} (Lam et al. 2016, Sumaila et al. 2011). This
[redistribution of resources is expected to result in **more** fishery
**disputes**]{.underline}, as current fisheries management is predicated
on the assumption that the geographical distribution of fish populations
is largely static (Pinsky et al. 2018, Cheung et al. 2010). However,
climate change will lead to a redistribution of resources and a loss of
revenue for the global fishing industry (Lam et al. 2016, Sumaila et al.
2011). Such [shifts in resources]{.underline} might become a particular
[**menace** for countries with a high dependence on fish protein for
**nutritional security**]{.underline} with countries such as Tuvalu and
Kiribati likely to experience the largest decreases in their maximum
catch potential due to climate change (Blasiak et al. 2017, Lam et al.
2016). Depending on how the impacts of anthropogenic climate change play
out in the global ocean, 23-35% of global Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZs) are projected to receive new transboundary fish stocks by the end
of the century (Pinsky et al. 2018). In some EEZs in the already
troubled maritime region of East Asia, 10 new stocks are projected to
enter as a consequence of climatic changes (Pinsky et al. 2018). In
summary, the changes fishery systems will undergo due to climate change
are likely to cause disruption to fisheries management globally, and are
[[feared to **spark conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Second, [the [global decline in catches]{.mark}]{.underline}, largely as
[a **consequence of overfishing**]{.underline}, is also
[[considered]{.mark} to be]{.underline} an [[**accelerating driver** of
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [abundance of available fishery
resources has **decreased substantially**]{.underline}: 33.1% of fish
stocks were fished at biologically unsustainable levels in 2015 (in
1974, this was 10%), and 59.9% fished at their maximally sustainable
level (FAO 2018). While effort has increased since the 1950s, catches
have stagnated and then slowly declined since the late 1980s (Pauly &
Zeller 2017, Pauly & Zeller 2016, Watson et al. 2013). Simultaneously,
[consumption of and demand for fish is steadily increasing,]{.underline}
and the average [annual increase in global fish consumption]{.underline}
(3.2%) [**outpaced** population **growth**]{.underline} (1.6%) between
1961 and 2016 (the average annual increase in meat consumption, for
example was 2.8% during that 4 same period (FAO 2018)). [In
**combination** with disputed **maritime boundaries**, this increased
competition may contribute to **volatile situations**.]{.underline}

[[International fisheries conflicts]{.mark} are [considered a **threat**
to]{.mark} **maritime [security]{.mark}** as they can have [far-reaching
impacts on **marine safety**]{.mark}, **resource
sustainability**]{.underline}, [[**geopolitical relations** and **food
security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, geopolitical stability and
marine safety (safety of seafarers and passengers (Bueger 2015)) were
compromised during the infamous Cod Wars that occurred between Great
Britain and Iceland during the 1950s and 1970s. The two countries were
embroiled in a string of confrontations over fishing rights in the North
Atlantic, where Iceland wanted to extend its fishing limit, but Great
Britain did not recognize their right to do so. [The consequences for
**geopolitical stability** and]{.underline}, at certain stages,
**[marine safety]{.underline}** (Bueger 2015) were
[[severe]{.underline}]{.mark}: [**[flash points]{.mark} of the
conflict** included the [use of **military vessels**]{.mark} to patrol
the area and defend fishing boats]{.underline}, [patrol boats cutting
the nets of trawlers, ships ramming trawlers and frigates]{.underline},
and, ultimately, [Iceland **threatening** to **leave NATO**]{.underline}
(Bakaki 2017). An [example of **compromised resource sustainability**
due to]{.underline} an **[international fisheries
conflict]{.underline}** is the previously discussed northeast [Atlantic
mackerel dispute]{.underline}. [As a result of the
conflict]{.underline}, there are [no comprehensive management plans for
the stock]{.underline}, and the [mackerel]{.underline} has become
**[severely overfished]{.underline}**. With countries setting unilateral
quotas, their combined catch in 2018 was twice that recommended by the
International Council for Exploration of the Sea (ICES), and the
fisheries had their Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certifications
retracted (Ramsden 2019, Seamon 2018). Lastly, [**food security** has
also been **jeopardized** due to **international fisheries
conflict**]{.underline}, as [exemplified by the incidents taking place
in the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea. [Fishermen from contending countries that operate
in the **troubled waters**]{.underline}, and whose [livelihoods depend
on the rich fishing grounds]{.underline}, have at times decided to leave
their occupation all together, afraid of going out into the waters
without any protection (Patience 2013). Moreover, [failure to address

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia dramatically reduced its
military operations in the Arctic. As a result of the quick move from
socialist to capitalist institutions during Yeltsin's presidency in the
1990s, Soviet nuclear infrastructure, including spent nuclear fuel,
solid and liquid radioactive waste, and even nuclear submarines, [was
abandoned **[without proper precautions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To
address this problem, a large Global Partnership (GP) Program of Western
donors arose at the beginning of the 2000s to provide financial and
technical assistance to the Russian Government to reduce its Soviet
"nuclear legacy."27 The GP helped Russia to dispose of all its 198
decommissioned nuclear submarines, handle safely spent nuclear fuel and
radioactive waste, and clean up some of the relevant sites. Currently,
international nuclear rehabilitation programs in the Arctic region of
Russia are gradually coming to an end. By 2028, according to current
plans, three more nuclear submarines, four nuclear icebreakers, and four
support vessels will be dismantled. Tentatively, all work will be
concluded by 2030--2032.28 The GP and the European Union's Northern
Dimension Environmental Partnership projects have successfully
contributed to the improvement of environmental quality in the Arctic
region and reduced the danger of radiological contamination in Arctic
waters. [Dumped radioactive contaminants]{.underline}. [An even more
acute problem]{.underline} is the fate of a large mass of dumped nuclear
facilities and materials in the northwestern Russian Arctic. These
[include \~17,000 containers with solid **radioactive waste**, 16
nuclear reactors from submarines and icebreakers, and two dumped
nuclear-powered submarines containing reactors]{.underline} (K-278 in
1989 in the Norwegian Sea and K-159 in 2003 in the Barents Sea). During
2020--2023, four Russia-Norway expeditions have been planned to analyze
the seabed of the Russian Arctic to evaluate the most dangerous nuclear
sites. The expeditions will determine next steps: either to lift some of
these objects or, in the case of an ecological threat, to conserve
them.30 In 2020, the President of the Russian Federation signed a Decree
adopting a new Strategy for the Development of the Arctic. The Strategy
anticipates "completion of the rehabilitation of areas of flooded and
sunken facilities with spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste."31

nuclear safety, [[there are potential issues pertaining to nuclear

If a non-state group realized that the possession of nuclear weapons
could trigger a total catalytic war between two or more major
nuclear-armed states, what possible situations might set these dynamics
in motion? [The potential success of a catalytic nuclear detonation by a
terrorist group during a crisis between two nuclear-armed
states]{.underline} (i.e., the original target of the nefarious attack
and the victim of a subsequent inadvertent retaliatory strike), when
tensions are running high, and a heightened state of alert is in place
-- at a nuclear or sub-nuclear level -- [would likely be
amplified]{.underline}. That is, **[a broader nuclear exchange would
likely occur]{.underline}**. Moreover, [a non-state actor might exploit
a tense situation by making provocative false claims that its attack had
been sanctioned]{.underline} [by the state with which the victim of the
attack was already in a crisis]{.underline}, or worse still, nuclear
brinkmanship. Against the backdrop of fear, acrimony, and paranoia --
when decision-makers are more susceptible to misperception and
misunderstanding -- any denials or assurances would fall on deaf ears.24
[If a repeat of the 1999 Kargil crisis or the more recent
Indian-Pakistani stand-off in 2019, a non-state nuclear
detonation]{.underline} (or the credible threat of one[) could spark an
accidental or **inadvertent nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. 25 Thus,
any confidence Indian or Pakistani has in their ability to manage a
conflict below the nuclear-level would likely be unreliable in the event
of a non-state nuclear attack. Absent unambiguous and incontrovertible
evidence to the contrary, an unprovoked non-state attack may compound
mutual suspicions about the other side's intentions and behavior, and in
turn, confirm worst-case scenario assessments. 26

The solitude of the north is changing. George Angohiatok noticed this
quite graphically a decade ago when, after returning to Iqaluktuuttiaq
(or Cambridge Bay, as it was renamed by settlers), he observed an ice
breaker moving through the same frozen waterways he had travelled by
snow machine the day before.

[If the vessel had smashed that open lead through the frozen veneer of
ice a day earlier, he would have been **cut off for at least a few
weeks** until the ice refroze.]{.underline} George wonders whether, even
with his headlights, he would have detected the steam that signals the
transition from ice to water in winter through his goggles.

[[The growing presence of **ice breakers worries**]{.underline}]{.mark}
George. [His Inuit ancestors moved east across the Arctic coast of North
America thousands of years ago. Since that time, the waterways have been
their highways, both in summer and winter. Traveling between camps and

Until recently, the Arctic was not considered a very promising field for
economic activities and especially for endeavors of maritime transport.
The Arctic Ocean was kept virtually isolated by very harsh environmental
conditions associated with thick multiyear ice and strong winds; polar
darkness during winter should also be considered among other
discouraging factors for shipping operations in this region. [As the ice
coverage within the Arctic maintains a downward trend, **extraordinary
opportunities** to capitalize on its plethora of untapped resources are
clearly looming. The extraction of various types of minerals and vast
quantities of energy resources (oil and gas) is standing out; touristic
and fishing activities could also benefit from an Arctic with less ice.
More importantly, the promise for **shorter voyages from Asia** towards
Europe and/or the Americas (and vice-versa) is already influencing the
future planning of various shipping companies.]{.underline} For those
entities looking to reap the benefits of these 'Arctic Passages', the
fact that navigation along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and/or the
Northwest Passage (NWP) is now more and more feasible, is deemed as a
predominant factor. But, it is also necessary to emphasize that the
influence of ice and ice-pacts upon transiting ships will remain a point
of concern; icebreakers' operations/escorts will continue to be a
requirement for safety reasons. But, there are potential vulnerabilities
in the capability of certain countries to effectively support safe(and
secure) shipping operations and future viable development in the Arctic
region. Russians are clearly leading the way; the U.S. and Canada are
clearly trailing behind. After examining the current state of the
icebreaker fleet along with future projections of resource allocation
amongst the Arctic countries, there are still important questions to
investigate further, such as 'Is the Russian economic investment in the
Arctic region going to pay off?' Why are the Russians building so many
icebreakers when no other country can begin to compete and the current
supply of Russian icebreakers are underutilized? [[Russia is]{.mark}
**clearly [leading the way]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} a plethora of
ice-capable [vessels already operational and a clear strategy]{.mark}
for the future. [They have]{.mark} [used their experience]{.mark} such
as lessons learned for ship types best poised [to]{.mark} operate in the
Arctic region, clearly stated political goals and ambitions, and a vast
amount of invested capital and resources to [develop the Arctic]{.mark}
area **[ahead of any other country]{.mark}**.]{.underline} However,
these economic investments come as Russia is faced with many setbacks
starting in 2015 that dampen their hopes of expanding Russian
sovereignty and shake the foundation of their 'grand Arctic plans.' In a
series of setbacks that sent signals of the reduced value of natural
resources trapped beneath the Arctic shelf, the Royal Dutch Shell, in
September 2015, announced they abandoned the Arctic search for oil after
failing to find enough crude (Schaps, 2015) followed by Exxon Mobil,
Chevron, and British Petroleum (BP). Furthermore, U.S. and EU sanction
shave made it tough for the Russian state-owned oil company, Rosneft, to
continue Arctic exploration without the backing of large U.S. and
European oil companies. [However, Russia has opted to forge ahead
[fueled by the desire to further their geopolitical agenda]{.mark},
fight severe unemployment in the high north, and refine their
technological advances. Going hand-in-hand with significant economic
investments in icebreakers, [the Russian government has made]{.mark}
large [strides]{.mark} to [protect their]{.mark} massive
[investment]{.mark} in the Arctic region [through]{.mark} the formation
of [military bases and]{.mark} [airfields]{.mark}. Under the leadership
of Vladimir Putin, Russia has issued numerous policy documents
prioritizing the Arctic region]{.underline}, to include: 2008 Arctic
Strategy, 2009 National Security Strategy, and a revised 2014
MilitaryPOLAR GEOGRAPHY 15

doctrine tasking Russia's armed forces with protecting Russia's national
interests. [Current plans include new and **[upgraded]{.mark} military
[bases]{.mark}** in the Arctic, among them Kotelny Island and the Franz
Josef Land, which [will house up to]{.mark} [250]{.mark} and 150
military [personnel]{.mark}/officers respectively (Staalesen, 2015).
While some have criticized Russia for grand actions and even more
ambitious rhetoric as a showy assertion to simulate sovereignty,
[shipments to ports along the Russian]{.mark} Arctic sea [route]{.mark}
in the first 11 months of 2016 [increased to]{.mark} 6.9 million tons,
[a]{.mark} new **[post-Soviet high]{.mark}** (Staalesen,
2016).]{.underline} While the NSR has seen increased maritime traffic in
2016, the shrinkage of Arctic ice has not advanced as fast as the
Russian government would have expected and the old Soviet infrastructure
is so rotten that navigation remains too risky. This has degraded the
confidence of many analysists to endorse the NSR as a safe and viable
connection between China and Europe, thereby resulting in many Russian
icebreakers not being put to projected use. Perhaps the latest blow is
the New Suez Canal, swiftly constructed by Egypt, which offers a far
more reliable route for tanker and container traffic. Conversely, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates seems to be [in the **infant stages of
development**]{.mark} when it comes to their future Arctic policy
compared to Russia]{.underline}. Only in April 2015, the United States
International Security Advisory Board (ISAB) on Arctic Policy undertook
a study of Russia's interests, intentions, and capabilities including an
increased presence both military and civilian- in the Arctic (U.S.
Department of State, 2016). [[This]{.mark} ISAB [study
recommended]{.mark} six key [areas]{.mark} that [the U.S. should
focus]{.mark} as it develops its future Arctic policy. All six
recommendations are applicable to this analysis and urge the United
States to: (1) [continue]{.mark} U.S. [leadership]{.mark} in the Arctic,
(2) [speed ratification of UNCLOS]{.mark} as an urgent imperative for
U.S. national interests, (3) advance [increased presence]{.mark} and
domain awareness [in the Arctic region]{.mark}, (4) increase and
[continue cooperation]{.mark} among the Arctic nations, (5)
[adopt]{.mark} appropriate [policies]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}n interests, policies, and activities in the Arctic,
[and]{.mark} (6) [strengthen]{.mark} possible 'Transparency and
[Confidence Building Measures]{.mark}' in the Arctic. A viable way to
meet all of the recommendations highlighted above by the ISAB is
tobolster the U.S. icebreaking fleet and **foster partnerships with
other Arctic countries**]{.underline} to build international SAR
facilities. [Polar [Icebreakers could]{.mark} also [enable the U.S. to
**maintain readiness**]{.mark} **in the Arctic** and Antarctic regions,
enforce treaties and other laws to safeguard industry and the
environment, provide ports, waterways and coastal security; and provide
logistical support]{.underline} --including vessel escort --to
facilitate the movement of goods and personnel necessary to sustain
scientific research, commerce, national security activities and maritime
safety (U.S. Coast Guard, 2017). [However, until the U.S. icebreaking
fleet is recognized as assets of national significance aimed at
protecting vital national interests in the polar region, this is an
uphill battle for the U.S.]{.underline} According to U.S. Coast Guard
Commandant, Admiral Zukunft, [at the end of the day [it]{.mark} really
[is a national]{.mark} [asset]{.mark}, where it's not just Coast Guard,
it's the National Science Foundation, the Arctic Research Council, the
Department of the Interior, Transportation, Defense Department,
Commerce, a number of others, that have equities in heavy
icebreakers.]{.underline} Canada, an important Arctic country partner,
together with Russia controls three-quarters of the Arctic Region.
Recently, Canada has shifted political tactics looking to cooperate with
Russia rather than maintain a more confrontational approach.16 M.
DREWNIAK ET AL.

However, they are in a similar predicament as the U.S., lacking suitable
icebreaking capabilities, adequate maritime infrastructure, or response
capabilities to consider the North-west Passage as a viable navigable
route compares to both the Suez and Panama Canal. In conclusion, [[the
current state of the]{.mark} icebreaking [ﬂeet]{.mark}, maritime
infrastructure, and available response capabilities in the Arctic region
[is **not adequately prepared**]{.mark} for the current sea-ice retreat
and projected increase of maritime shipping and human activity in the
north, **[especially for the U.S.]{.mark}** and Canada. Therefore, [it
is imperative]{.mark} that additional [resources are devoted]{.mark} to
further study the necessary response assets, inter-national policies,
and joint SAR facilities needed to provide the possibility of safe and
efﬁcient Arctic marine shipping for the future]{.underline}

Thereafter, [[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should

deterrence is credible. This is especially so if China and Russia

This article has argued that Canada's Arctic defence strategy focusing
on surveillance and technological development is sensible from a policy
standpoint because surveillance technologies and practices are both
defence-oriented (in a narrow military sense) and security-oriented (in
a broadened sense). [[Surveillance tech]{.mark}nologies [possess a
"dual-use" character that]{.mark} occupies multiple aesthetic
categories. Additionally, dual-use technology [possesses]{.mark} a
common-sense [appeal through]{.mark} its [link to "protecting"
sovereignty]{.mark} (as an inviolable right of all states) without
risking provocation in a way that offensive development may lead towards
a military spiral]{.underline}. Technological development for Arctic
situational awareness is understood to be both fiscally conservative and
economically productive in its own right. While often experimental[,
surveillance technologies are [**relatively cheaper** than other forms
of defence]{.mark} investment and support economic development by
contracting Canadian firms and expertise]{.underline}. Lastly,
surveillance has a practical character in that it lends itself well to a
whole-of-government approach by distributing capacity and burden across
multiple departments. This strategy enjoys the benefit of servicing
Canada's more immediate security needs in the Arctic while remaining
sufficiently flexible to adapt to medium- and long-term goals as these
technologies advance and Canada's role in North American defence becomes
clearer, including its possible contribution to missile defence.

Despite the pragmatic role that surveillance offers, policymakers must
be wary of any deterministic accounts of how technology will save us
from an increasingly threatening world. In particular, any role that
sensor technology will play in the modernization of continental defence
systems through NORAD must be considered within the broader political
context outside of narrow instrumentalist reasoning derived from a
technological focus. [[Remaining cognizant of tech]{.mark}nology's
political and social context [is]{.mark} **especially
[important]{.mark}** [concerning]{.mark} the strategic [emphasis
on]{.mark} all [domain awareness]{.mark}, [which prioritizes]{.mark} the
[development of]{.mark} [a]{.mark} technological [ecosystem with]{.mark}
the [potential for global reach]{.mark} by integrating numerous sensor
networks and data sets]{.underline}. The operational logic of SHIELD and
the current NORAD/USNORTHCOM strategy enjoys a broader symmetry with US
strategic thinking. [The [strategic approach]{.mark} of these cases
[stresses **the role of tec**]{.mark}**hnology**, especially artificial
intelligence, [in]{.mark} producing the material capabilities for
**[dominating]{.mark} future [conflicts]{.mark}** [through
surveillance]{.mark}, information superiority, and decision cycle
dominance within an all domain battlefield.]{.underline} Undoubtedly,
current trends within the international sphere are worrisome and invite
serious attention to the defence needs in the Arctic and North America.
Whatever solutions are delivered in the coming years, [an enhanced
[surveillance]{.mark} capacity supported by technological development
[will]{.mark} undoubtedly [**factor heavily** into those
measures]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, we should not be so bold as to
assume that technology will automatically deliver the promised salvation
that geostrategic thinking might suggest when divorced from the messy
reality that any Arctic future may entail.

Council has not discussed matters of military security because of a
clause added to its founding document at the insistence of the US
(Greaves and Pomerants 2017, 36). But given that military security is
now incredibly relevant to the region and the Council is the only
platform that all of the Arctic states have to cooperate together, it
needs to pass a resolution to amend its operating structure to include
security matters. It has already ventured into soft security and certain
operations of militaries in the region, and it is likely that an
agreement to include all security matters could be reached. Doing so
would allow the discussion of the Arctic states to be much more
transparent and all encompassing, both of which, as the quote at
beginning of this section demonstrated, are vitally important to
preventing escalation and miscalculation. In addition, right now the
most common platform for the discussion of Arctic military issues is
NATO, which is ineffective because Russia is not a party to those
discussions. [The **[lack of transparency]{.mark}** inherent [in
discussions of security]{.mark} [excluding Russia]{.mark} can only
**[exacerbate tensions]{.mark}** and misinterpretation [and
increase]{.mark} the [possibility of a]{.mark} security
[dilemma]{.mark}.]{.underline} NATO should not be the main platform- it
needs to be the Arctic Council.

Second, the governance of the Northern Sea Route is one of the most
pressing issues in the Arctic right now, and has significant escalatory
potential. The Arctic states cannot agree on who should govern the two
passages that make up the NSR- the Northeast Passage and the Northwest
Passage- or how. Russia, China, the US, and Canada especially have
differing stances. However, the NEP falls mostly in Russia's territory
and the NWP falls mostly in Canada's territory and they each have the
most resources to govern the passages. In fact, both have been de facto
doing so for years as the NSR slowly becomes navigable. Before it is
fully navigable and Loeber 56 becomes a popular international shipping
route, its governance needs to be settled in international law to
prevent territorial, legal, military, and economic disputes that could
escalate. Russia and Canada should each declare their passages as
international straits, which would give them the ability to govern them
while also giving the rest of the world the right of transit to pass
through them. And the governance would be grounded in international law,
which all of the Arctic states have advocated for.

These recommendations are based on an analysis of the Arctic states' and
China's published Arctic Strategies and consider how to fulfill their
stated goals so as to make them acceptable and possible while also
effectively decreasing tension and preventing escalation[. The
[potential for conflict in the Arctic is **real and dangerous**]{.mark},
but [it can be avoided if]{.mark} a conscious, [good]{.mark} faith
[effort is made]{.mark}]{.underline} by all of the Arctic states.

However, it is clear deep-sea mining has its risks as well, and these
risks arguably far outweigh the benefits. As recently discovered,
polymetallic nodules have been linked to oxygen production (Sweetman et
al. 2024), so removing them could have detrimental effects to marine
life, especially as there is still so much scientists do not know about
the ecosystems of the deep sea. What we do know, however, provides
reason for concern. The deep sea is the largest habitable space on the
planet and is home to tens of thousands of species, with 5,000 new ones
recently discovered in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone alone (Ashford et al.
2024). Deep-sea mining could directly harm these species through contact
with mining equipment and sediment plumes the machines create, which
could smother and suffocate deep-sea organisms and inhibit food sources
(Ashford et al. 2024). Warm mining wastewater could also kill marine
life through overheating and poisoning (Ashford et al. 2024). Of course,
damage to these species would have long-term ecosystem effects as well.
Light and John sound pollution as well as the removal of the
polymetallic nodules, which serve as the habitat for many of these
species, could lead to species extinction, devastating these
slow-developing ecosystems (Ashford et al. 2024). Additionally, waste
discharge from mining vessels could spread miles across the water,
threatening fish populations (Ashford et al. 2024). The socioeconomic
impact of this must also be considered, as fishing drives the economies
of many small islands in the Pacific. Deep-sea mining would also require
shoreline facilities, which would require developing land, leading to
potential terrestrial habitat loss (Ashford et al. 2024). Current
regulations also promote more revenue flow to developed countries and
shareholders of mining companies, once again leaving developing
countries out of the picture (Ashford et al. 2024). Ultimately, the
biggest impact will most likely be a decrease in deep-sea biodiversity.
Many microscopic organisms play a role in absorbing around 25% of the
world's carbon dioxide emissions, so the loss of any of the contributing
species could affect the ocean's carbon cycle, the impact of which will
be seen in global temperature rises (Ashford et al. 2024). [These **high
risks** are the reason [regulation of deep-sea]{.mark} strip mining [is
**so important**]{.mark}. The United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea, abbreviated to [UNCLOS]{.mark}, and the 1994 Agreement
established the regulations regarding water beyond national jurisdiction
that the world still follows today, as well as organizations to
implement these rules (United Nations).]{.underline} Though deep-sea
strip mining is a newly developing process, regulation actually dates
back to the 19th century. In March of 1874, the British ship HMS
Challenger collected the first known deposits of manganese nodules.
Analysis of these samples in 1891 revealed the metallic makeup known
today. In the 1950s, numerous companies began exploring known nodule
hotspots to estimate their economic potential, discovering what is now
known as the Clarion-Clipperton zone. It wasn't until 1970, however,
that the UN General Assembly began to regulate these expeditions. They
declared that resources of the seabed beyond the limits of national
jurisdiction to be "the common heritage of mankind" (United Nations
2024). The Seabed Committee in 1968 and the nine-year Third United
Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea led to the adoption of the Law
of the Sea Convention in 1982 (United Nations 2024). [The UN [continues
to help nations]{.mark} understand the convention and [utilize their
marine resources with minimal conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea (DOALOS) helps
coordinate the UN's programming concerning marine activity (United
Nations 2024). The United Nations also gives assistance to the two newly
created institutions - the International Seabed Authority, or the ISA,
and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. In 2021, the
two-year rule was established, requiring the ISA to "consider" and
"provisionally approve" applications to mine after two years of the date
of an initial notification in 2021 (Ashford et al. 2024). In 2023, at
this two-year mark, the ISA still had not determined a final rule. The
council is working to adopt official regulations by 2025. The ISA also
sponsors a Contractors' Training Program. Contractors have a legal
obligation to provide and fund training opportunities for personnel from
developing States and those of the ISA in order to provide operational
expertise for deep seabed mining (International Seabed Authority). These
advancements leave the UN with a lot of work on their plate as the world
of deep-sea strip mining is beginning to seriously be explored. Their
focus will be working with nations to uphold UN guidelines, monitoring
their deep-sea activities, and assisting developing countries in taking
full advantage of their rights. Most recently, the 29th session of the
International Seabed Authority in Jamaica and the seventh ISA annual
contractors meeting in Korea were hosted to discuss evolving policies.
The seventh ISA annual contractors meeting occurred in the city of Busan
in the Republic of Korea from September 30 - October 2, 2024 (Cooper &
Dingwall 2024). The theme was "Fostering dialogue and collective actions
for effective regulatory compliance of activities carried out in the
Area." The meeting was held in collaboration with the Korea Institute of
Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST). Dr. Do-Hyung Kang, Minister for
Oceans and Fisheries of the Republic of Korea, emphasized the importance
of balancing resource development with environmental protection. He also
notably presented the vision of the deep seabed as "the last frontier"
of Earth (Cooper & Dingwall 2024). The ISA has also issued the Mining
Code, which comprises rules, global regulations and procedures to
regulate prospecting, exploration and exploitation of marine minerals
(International Seabed Authority). There are three sets of exploration
regulations in place that cover the prospecting and exploration for
polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulfides, and carbon-rich
ferromanganese crusts. Their exploitation regulations ensure that
economic needs are not prioritized at the expense of environmental
protection. [However, the focus on environmental protection set by
[UNCLOS]{.mark} [only applies to]{.mark} international territories and
[those who have ratified]{.mark} the Law of the Sea, [which the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **notably [has
not]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In 1982, with the passing of UNCLOS,
President Reagan announced the United States would not sign, stating,
"We recognize that world demand and markets currently do not justify
commercial development of deep seabed mineral resources, and it is not
clear when such development will be justified... When such factors
become favorable, however, the deep seabed represents a potentially
important source of strategic and other minerals. The aim of the United
States in this regard has been to establish with other nations an order
that would allow exploration and development under reasonable terms and
conditions" (SAIS Review of International Affairs 2023). [However, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has **[continue]{.mark}d [to

when incentivizing less powerful allies to participate (rather than
"free ride") in the provision of increased security in the South China
Sea. In this context, no-regret policies include "strengthening port
security measures, tightening crew screening, and coordinating coastal
patrols and emergency response efforts"---all steps that would provide
benefits in and of themselves, regardless of whether the overall
security situation improved.50

[Improving [Arctic]{.mark} SAR [capabilities]{.mark} is a no-regret
policy [because]{.mark} the personnel and [equipment will save]{.mark}

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} new trilateral Icebreaker Collaboration
Effort Pact ([[ICE Pact]{.underline}]{.mark}) announced last week
between Canada, Finland, and the United States [[provides a **leap**
forward in closing the icebreaker gap between Russia and the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}. Finland is a net contributor to the NATO
alliance, as was stressed at the recent NATO Summit in Washington.
Lending the country's icebreaking know-how is a tangible benefit for the
countries participating in the new partnership, as well as for NATO as a
whole. As a new NATO Ally, [[Finland brings important icebreaker and
Arctic expertise]{.mark} to the Alliance]{.underline}. Finnish President
Alexander Stubb remarked that NATO membership was essential to begin
this trilateral cooperation.

[[Finland is an icebreaker **superpower**]{.underline}]{.mark},
primarily because its ports freeze over every winter. Icebreakers keep
Finnish ports open year-round and ensure that imports and exports flow.
[[Finland]{.mark} is also the world\'s leading icebreaker designer,
having [designed **80%** of the world's icebreakers and built **60%** of
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. It has championed breakthroughs in using
liquefied natural gas (LNG) in its newest icebreakers. The Polaris,
which debuted in 2017, is the most environmentally friendly icebreaker
in operation and is powered by both LNG and diesel. Climate change has
added unpredictability and new challenges to the operating conditions of
icebreakers in recent years.

More details will be known later this fall. What is known of the ICE
Pact is it is modeled after the AUKUS nuclear submarine trilateral
arrangement between Australia, the UK, and the US. [The US and Allies
are seeking to build between 70 and 90 new icebreakers in the next
decade]{.underline}. [[Finnish shipyards can deliver a]{.mark}
[polar-class]{.mark} [vessel]{.mark} [within 24 months]{.mark} once
ordered [for at least a **quarter** of the cost of what it would take to
build them in the US]{.mark}]{.underline}. This partnership will likely
benefit all three partner countries, with Finland receiving a
considerable economic influx as a result of sharing its icebreaker
expertise. This should bring new jobs and more work, both to its
shipyards and US shipyards as it shares it technology.

The ICE Pact also provides an opportunity for Canada, which was
criticized at the Washington Summit for not investing more in its Arctic
capabilities or being close to the minimum 2% spending of GDP on defense
nor planning on reaching 2% until 2032 (while some NATO Allies are at
3%). Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair noted that by 2050, [the
Arctic Ocean could be the most efficient shipping route between Europe
and East Asia]{.underline}, so it is important for Canada, the US, and
Europe to have icebreaking capabilities to ensure safe passage through
the region.

[[The ICE Pact is a **win**]{.mark}-win [for]{.mark} [the]{.mark} three
[members]{.mark} of the new trilateral agreement]{.underline}. Finland
shares its finely honed proficiency in icebreaker building and further
cements its value to the NATO Alliance. Canada also shares its
icebreaker knowledge--with the second-largest icebreaker fleet (behind
Russia)--and can invest more in its Arctic capabilities. Meanwhile, [the
US can]{.mark} play catch-up and [update]{.mark} [its massively outdated
icebreaker fleet]{.mark}, thereby closing the icebreaker gap between the
West and Russia. [More icebreakers in the region will ensure that North
America and Europe can operate effectively in the Arctic]{.underline} in
the future.

[[Along with]{.underline}]{.mark} China and [[South

pos[sible avenue for cooperation is Japan's inclusion in an extended
version of the early-stage Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE
Pact). ]{.underline}The ICE Pact is a partnership between the U.S.,
Canada, and Finland to enhance the production of icebreaker ships and
bolster shipbuilding capacities in these countries.

[[Japan's inclusion in]{.mark} an extended [ICE Pact]{.mark} is
[**bolstered** by]{.mark} its [strategic engagement in the
Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite its geographical distance from the
region, [[Japan has]{.mark} developed a comprehensive [Arctic

(Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden), [[reflect its
**growing interest and active involvement**]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}. [As an active stakeholder in Arctic governance,
Japan participated in the negotiations for the legally binding 2021
Central Arctic Ocean Fishing Agreement]{.underline}. Its role in Arctic
Circle conferences further underscores its potential as a strategic
partner. Additionally, Japan's experience with vessels like the Shirase
icebreaker strengthens its shipbuilding capabilities. [These [efforts

[[making it a natural fit for the ICE Pact]{.mark} and broader

Act.]{.underline} This [synergy not only addresses U.S. deficiencies in
Arctic shipbuilding but also [leverages Japan's **industrial strengths**

[[Japan's]{.mark} expertise [could help the ICE Pact expand its capacity

for the design and construction of icebreakers and ships would be
necessary. [Furthermore, [extending the ICE Pact to include Japan would

Why [[Korean Collaboration Is **Key**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Hanwha's acquisition of Philly Shipyard could prove to be the decisive
factor. [[South Korea brings]{.mark} to the table [**vast experience**
in]{.mark} building **[advanced vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline}---from
LNG carriers and naval ships to icebreakers---both swiftly and
cost-effectively. [[If the United States is willing]{.mark} to [broaden
its scope]{.mark} beyond the ICE Pact and formally integrate Korean
expertise, **[several clear advantages emerge]{.mark}**:]{.underline}

1\. **[[Accelerated Icebreaker Construction]{.underline}]{.mark}**

\- By tapping into Korea's proven technologies[, the [United States
could acquir]{.mark}e much-needed [icebreakers **sooner** and at
a]{.mark} more **[manageable cost]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

2\. **[[Revitalization of Domestic Shipbuilding]{.underline}]{.mark}**

\- [[Maintaining production]{.underline}]{.mark} at Philly Shipyard
[[while integrating advanced Korean methods would]{.mark}
[**enhance**]{.mark} overall [competitiveness,]{.mark} potentially
**[reinvigorating American shipyards]{.mark}** that have struggled to
keep pace.]{.underline}

3\. **[[Enhanced Strategic Posture]{.underline}]{.mark}**

\- As Russia and China continue their Arctic push, [a [collaboration
with Korea]{.mark}---[already adept in]{.mark} polar
[shipping]{.mark},]{.underline} LNG transport, [[and icebreaker]{.mark}
technology]{.underline}---[[would **strengthen America's presence**
in]{.mark} both [the Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctic.]{.underline}

A Way Forward

It is [now evident that the [ICE Pact alone **will not** solve every
challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}. The troubled [[PSC program
reveals]{.mark} the [need for a **broader approach**]{.mark}---one that
welcomes outside expertise and streamlines the path to additional
icebreaking capacity.]{.underline} By capitalizing on Hanwha's newly
established foothold in the U.S. market, Washington can chart a course
that ensures success on multiple fronts.

[Such an initiative would [not only shore up America's]{.mark} polar
[defense]{.mark} [but]{.mark} also provide a [**vital** boost to]{.mark}
the [nation's shipbuilding industry]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For
policymakers looking to achieve multiple objectives with a single
initiative, expanding cooperation with Korea stands out as a pragmatic
and forward-looking step. [[Failure to seize this]{.mark} opportunity
[could leave the United States **lagging** in]{.mark} the polar
[competition]{.mark} at a time when strategic dominance in these regions
has never been more crucial.]{.underline}

In short, the Philadelphia acquisition has created a unique chance to
meld America's industrial legacy with Korea's shipbuilding prowess. If
harnessed effectively, [this [partnership]{.mark} could well be the
[**key** to ensuring that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [maintains

#### Mass producing Icebreakers crosses the environmental threshold.

Brian **Czech**, 4-14-20**22**, \"Icebreakers in the Arctic: An
Overlooked Environmental Concern,\" Center for the Advancement of the
Steady State Economy,
https://steadystate.org/icebreakers-in-the-arctic-an-overlooked-environmental-concern///nishant

Little information is available about the environmental concerns that
icebreakers pose. [[Literature highlights the perceived
"positives"---]{.mark}scientific exploration, search and rescue, trade
and shipping, and competition amongst nations---[as being more important
than considering **environmental degradation**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
However, here's what we know.

Icebreakers break ice. [As the broken [ice melts]{.mark}, sunlight is
absorbed, [lead]{.mark}ing [to increased temperatures]{.mark}, and [thus
**more** ice melting]{.mark}]{.underline}. An icebreaker cruising
through the ice for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), leaving an ice-free
wake of ten meters (33 feet), would open an area of water ten square
kilometers (3.9 square miles) over the entire cruise. [Although the
Arctic Sea covers about 4,000 kilometers (2500 miles[), any amount of
ice breaking **harms the environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With the
continual use of icebreaker ships, [the Arctic will continue to look
more like ice cubes melting in a glass of water.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Arctic: melting ice cubes bobbing in a glass of water.

As melting endures, we will continue to see environmental effects around
the world. Changes in the Arctic Sea ice pattern leads to a rise in sea
levels globally. Low-lying developed areas in the Gulf Coast and the
mid-Atlantic regions are especially at risk from sea-level rise. The
recent growth of coastal areas has resulted in larger populations and
more valuable coastal property being at risk from sea-level rise.
[[Major physical impacts of a rise in sea level include erosion of
beaches, inundation of deltas as well as flooding and **loss of many
marshes and wetlands**.]{.mark} Increased salinity will likely become a
problem in coastal aquifers and estuarine systems because of saltwater
intrusion.]{.underline}

[Changes in Arctic ice patterns are also leading to more frequent
extreme weather.]{.underline} In the past few years, such extreme
weather has been seen particularly across the east coast of the USA,
western Europe, and central Asia. [These [regions will continue to
experience more extreme weather]{.mark} because of Arctic
amplification]{.underline}, the enhanced sensitivity of high latitudes
to global heating. Arctic ice melt has also been shown to distort the
flow of and weaken the jet stream, resulting in more frequent periods of
intense heat and ferocious cold.

[There's also evidence that the [**sound** emitted from icebreakers is
detrimental to marine animals,]{.mark} particularly whales [and]{.mark}
other large mammals. The [sound interferes with their ability to
communicate]{.mark} with their pods. Additionally, sound pollution
[likely has long-term effects that are difficult to
predict.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Most of the Russian icebreaker fleet is nuclear-based due to the fuel
costs of running an icebreaker. [On average, an icebreaker working in
regions with three-meter-thick ice uses more than 100 tons of fuel per

[[Beluga whales]{.mark} can [hear ships transiting through sea ice
]{.mark}]{.underline}over very long ranges of 35 to 78 kilometres and
[tend to [exhibit a "flee" response]{.mark} as soon as they detect
them]{.underline}.2 [This response [includes l]{.mark}arge herds
undertaking **long dives** close to or beneath the ice edge, the
[**breakdown of pod integrity** and **asynchronous
diving**]{.mark}.]{.underline}3 [[Belugas]{.mark} tend to avoid the area
where icebreaking was heard for one to two days.]{.underline}4 The
[**avoidance of belugas**]{.underline} from icebreaking means that
t[h]{.underline}ey usually do not get close enough for potentially
harmful effects to occur, such as masking of their communication signals
or damage to their auditory system. However, if belugas are engaged in
important behaviours, such as mating, nursing or feeding, they [[might
not leave the area]{.mark} immediately but tolerate louder and possibly
harmful noise]{.underline}.5 It is assumed that narwhals detect
icebreaking noise at similar distances to belugas.6 However, [a 1990
study by Finley and colleagues described [**a "freeze" response** of
narwhals ]{.mark}]{.underline}when in the presence of a ship breaking
ice. This shows that the reaction of both [narwhals and belugas are
[highly variable]{.mark} and [hard to predict]{.mark}]{.underline}.7
Walruses are very mobile, using available ice floes as haul-out,
whelping site and nursing platforms.8 [Walruses in the Chuchki Sea
showed a "flee" response to icebreaking activity]{.underline} within 230
metres and some at greater distances (more than one kilometre); mothers
and calves are likely to escape into the water, causing small calves to
be energetically compromised.9 Caspian breeding adult seals generally
respond to icebreaking by moving away only at distances less than
approximately 100 metres,10 while breeding ringed seal adults react to
icebreaking at distances up to 230 metres.11 Caspian and harp [[seal
pups]{.mark} innately [follow their mothers]{.mark}]{.underline}, who
usually try to lead their pups away from danger;12 however, both adults
and pups of the harp seal may display a "paralysis" response to
approaching danger,13 and may therefore fail to move away. [Ribbon seal
adults show little avoidance or flight response to boats,14 and are
therefore [at great risk of ship strikes.]{.mark} The [**displacement of
animals**]{.mark} from preferred areas could [result in **negative
consequences**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[changes in **food

[[Ships breaking ice]{.mark} through the breeding grounds of seals have
been [predicted to impact both habitats and
individuals]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Nursing pups]{.underline} of ringed
seals and bearded seals [[have been affected by **collisions**, crushing
or **displaced ice**]{.underline}]{.mark}.25 Icebreaking through fast or
pack ice [[creates channels of **brash ice**]{.mark} (small, floating
fragments), [which may remain]{.mark} if the ice does not refreeze
rapidly]{.underline}. Caspian and Baltic grey seals have been recorded
as using these channels as leads into the ice, and Caspian seal females
often create whelping sites along the edge of these open channels,
behaving as if they were a natural polynya.26 [This [places them at risk
of **ship strikes**]{.mark} from continued shipping in the same
channel]{.underline}. Ringed seal pups are concealed in lairs for about
six weeks and [are [therefore vulnerable to **icebreaker
destruction**]{.mark},]{.underline} since the only visible indication of
lairs at the surface may be ice holes or adults on the ice.27 The
ability of seal pups to withstand flushing into the ice waters due to
the passage of an icebreaker varies based on the species. The survival
of small-bodied pups in lanugo with a relatively long nursing period of
approximately four to six weeks, such as Caspian pups, is compromised if
the pups are forced into ice water; ringed seal pups, however, from
approximately 25 days can enter the water if disturbed.28 The larger
pups of the hooded seal naturally enter the water gradually after
weaning at about four days,29 but the impact of premature entry into the
water is unknown[. In addition to ship strikes and small pups being
wetted in ice-chilled waters, [icebreaking impact is also likely to
include **separation of mother-pup pairs**, **displacement** from their
natal site ]{.mark}]{.underline}and whelping site breakage. [[These
impacts will result in energy loss]{.mark} to mother and pup and will
also [**stress**]{.mark} the mother,]{.underline} which may affect
lactation, [with [**detrimental effects** on pup
survival]{.mark}.]{.underline}30 Even if a floe bearing a pup drifts
long distances at high speed, mothers will still follow the floe and
attend the pup.31 It is likely that [the destruction of a pupping floe
would [result in the **death**]{.mark} of a young pup]{.underline}. Pups
of species with whelping site tenacity are likely to be more vulnerable
to nursery habitat destruction by icebreaking vessels than those species
using the ice only as a haul-out platform. Ice-breeding pinniped pups
mainly rely on relatively stable fast or pack ice where the whelping
site is predictably relatively stable for the duration of the nursing
period. Caspian and harp seals generally have a well-developed nursery
site, often for a small group of mothers and young, which incorporates a
network of birth sites, pup shelters, water-access holes and seal
tracks. [Mothers and other adults learn the topography of their breeding
site and learn to navigate back to it.32 Pup survival is therefore
dependent on the integrity of the nursery site and the structures
lasting through the nursing period.33]{.underline} The ability of
mothers to navigate back to the nursing site [can be affected by
**icebreaker activity** in the nursery site area.]{.underline} No
information is available about how bearded seals respond to icebreaking
during the spring breeding season (April until early July). During that
period, male bearded seals maintain aquatic territories in which they
produce vocalizations to advertise their breeding condition. Males
defend small areas and show strong site fidelity and tenure over
multiple years.34 The [[breaking of sea ice may **alter the ice
habitat**]{.mark} and thus the [**long-term mating success**]{.mark} of
individual males,]{.underline}35 [thus affecting reproductive [success
and **population stability**]{.mark}.]{.underline}36 Lastly, [when new
open-water lead systems]{.underline} [(large fractures in sea ice) are
created by ships, marine species can take advantage of the new leads,
**[changing ecosystem dynamics]{.mark}**]{.underline}.37 [[Killer whales
use openings]{.mark} in the sea ice [to access
prey]{.mark}]{.underline}.38 Icebreaker activities may [provide killer
whales with increased access to wintering areas]{.underline} used by
narwhals, belugas, bowheads and pinnipeds. This can [[result in
increased **killer whale**]{.mark}**--related [predation ]{.mark}**[and
**mortality** in marine mammal populations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Icebreakers Bad

#### Mass producing Icebreakers crosses the environmental threshold

Brian **Czech**, 4-14-**2022**, \"Icebreakers in the Arctic: An
Overlooked Environmental Concern,\" Center for the Advancement of the
Steady State Economy,
https://steadystate.org/icebreakers-in-the-arctic-an-overlooked-environmental-concern///nishant

Little information is available about the environmental concerns that
icebreakers pose. [[Literature highlights the perceived
"positives"---]{.mark}scientific exploration, search and rescue, trade
and shipping, and competition amongst nations---[as being more important
than considering **environmental degradation**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
However, here's what we know.

Icebreakers break ice. [As the broken [ice melts]{.mark}, sunlight is
absorbed, [lead]{.mark}ing [to increased temperatures]{.mark}, and [thus
**more** ice melting]{.mark}]{.underline}. An icebreaker cruising
through the ice for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), leaving an ice-free
wake of ten meters (33 feet), would open an area of water ten square
kilometers (3.9 square miles) over the entire cruise. [Although the
Arctic Sea covers about 4,000 kilometers (2500 miles[), any amount of
ice breaking **harms the environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With the
continual use of icebreaker ships, [the Arctic will continue to look
more like ice cubes melting in a glass of water.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Arctic: melting ice cubes bobbing in a glass of water.

As melting endures, we will continue to see environmental effects around
the world. Changes in the Arctic Sea ice pattern leads to a rise in sea
levels globally. Low-lying developed areas in the Gulf Coast and the
mid-Atlantic regions are especially at risk from sea-level rise. The
recent growth of coastal areas has resulted in larger populations and
more valuable coastal property being at risk from sea-level rise.
[[Major physical impacts of a rise in sea level include erosion of
beaches, inundation of deltas as well as flooding and **loss of many
marshes and wetlands**.]{.mark} Increased salinity will likely become a
problem in coastal aquifers and estuarine systems because of saltwater
intrusion.]{.underline}

[Changes in Arctic ice patterns are also leading to more frequent
extreme weather.]{.underline} In the past few years, such extreme
weather has been seen particularly across the east coast of the USA,
western Europe, and central Asia. [These [regions will continue to
experience more extreme weather]{.mark} because of Arctic
amplification]{.underline}, the enhanced sensitivity of high latitudes
to global heating. Arctic ice melt has also been shown to distort the
flow of and weaken the jet stream, resulting in more frequent periods of
intense heat and ferocious cold.

[There's also evidence that the [**sound** emitted from icebreakers is
detrimental to marine animals,]{.mark} particularly whales [and]{.mark}
other large mammals. The [sound interferes with their ability to
communicate]{.mark} with their pods. Additionally, sound pollution
[likely has long-term effects that are difficult to
predict.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Most of the Russian icebreaker fleet is nuclear-based due to the fuel
costs of running an icebreaker. [On average, an icebreaker working in
regions with three-meter-thick ice uses more than 100 tons of fuel per
day. However, nuclear icebreakers have obvious concerns as well. [In
fact, should an accident occur, the consequence would be as **severe as
the Chernobyl** disaster and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill combined:
devastating.]{.mark}]{.underline}

With expected and already planned new economic development along the
Arctic coast and in the Arctic Seas of Russia, shipping activity along
the NEP/NSR is likely to grow in the near future (Government of the
Russian Federation 2019). To minimize or mitigate possible adverse
impacts of shipping along the NEP/NSR, [[it is **important** to
consider]{.underline}]{.mark} vessel traffic patterns in the different
parts of the route in light of [the specific [environmental
characteristics]{.mark}]{.underline} of each part of the route. Shipping
activities are unevenly distributed throughout the Russian maritime
Arctic and [therefore [their impact on the environment varies]{.mark}
sea by sea]{.underline}. [[Each economic activity results in a specific
impact on biologically significant areas]{.underline}]{.mark} and is
associated with specific risks. The [[impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} of
vessel traffic on marine ecosystems along the NEP
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} limited mostly to [[physical disturbance,
noise]{.mark},]{.underline} both air and water pollution[, [icebreaking
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}, the spread of invasive aquatic species,
[[and the risk of a fuel]{.underline}]{.mark} or cargo
[[spill]{.underline}.]{.mark} However, one of the noticeable
environmental problems, marine litter from fisheries, has started to
receive more attention, as both fishing activities and litter moves
northward (Höjman et al., 2022, Olsen et al., 2020b) negatively
affecting marine life and coastal populations.

[[Icebreaker ships]{.mark} must be made from a strong material to ensure
they can break big sheets of ice without sustaining damage. This is why
they're usually [made from **steel**.]{.mark}]{.underline} They vary in
size but usually weigh thousands of tonnes -- which is a huge amount of
steel.

[[Steel is **non-renewable**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Sourcing]{.mark}
steel to build ships **[is unsustainable since it requires
mining]{.mark}**. [Mining]{.mark} [is]{.mark} not only [a]{.mark} [big
source of **pollution**]{.mark} but can also [cause
deforestation]{.mark}, which disrupts the ecosystem, [as well as soil
erosion]{.mark} and instability from constructing the mine
site.]{.underline} [[It]{.mark} then [requires]{.mark} a lot of
[**energy** to convert]{.mark} the mined [minerals into metal]{.mark}
and [then into]{.mark} products, **such as [icebreaker
ships]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Given that **most [energy
production is]{.mark} still [based on fossil fuels]{.mark}**, this [is
**unsustainable**]{.mark} and causes further pollution.]{.underline} In
2021, the steel sector alone released more than 3.3 billion tonnes of
greenhouse gas emissions. Steel is recyclable, and unlike plastic, metal
can be recycled an unlimited amount of times without losing quality.
Most ships last between 30 to 50 years, so there is not a regular demand
to replace rundown ships.

The steel from a ship is also usually recycled at the end of its
lifespan. While recycling is not carbon neutral, it does require less
energy and resources than sourcing new materials. [**Icebreaker ships
can also disrupt the ecosystem**.]{.underline} [Since they make a lot of
noise, they can frighten animals away from the area and can also disturb
marine life living under the ice. **[As ships release CO2]{.mark}, this
can have an impact on the ocean and marine life**. As [the ocean
absorbs]{.mark} more [CO2, the pH changes]{.mark}, [making]{.mark} it
more acidic. **[Ocean acidification]{.mark}** is detrimental to marine
life that relies on shells.]{.underline} Shells and skeletons are formed
from calcium and carbonate, but as the ocean becomes more acidic, these
structures can break down. Meaning these creatures must spend more time
repairing their shells or are left exposed and without
shelter[.]{.underline} For other marine life, the change in pH can mean
they have to expend more energy to ensure their body fluid chemistry is
stable, which can be detrimental to their health

Nuclear and radiological accidents. No notable accidents at nuclear
power plants or storage facilities have been recorded in or around the
Arctic. However, some [**[radioactive leaks]{.mark}** from the
**[nuclear icebreakers' reactors]{.mark}** have [resulted in their
emergency dumping]{.mark}]{.underline}.24 Several [[accidents involving
military hardware have occurred]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 1968, an
American B-52 bomber carrying four hydrogen bombs crashed near Thule Air
Force Base in northern Greenland. Efforts to retrieve the bombs were not
entirely successful, and concerns about radioactive contamination
remain.25 In 2000, the [[nuclear-powered Russian
submarine]{.underline}]{.mark} K-141 (Kursk) [[sank in the Barents Sea
as a result of **an explosion**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the torpedo
compartment, with the loss of all its 118 sailors.26 The submarine's
nuclear reactors were not damaged and were later recovered. The Kursk
did not carry nuclear weapons. As a matter of governance, [the issue of
[nuclear accidents raises issues of emergency prevention, preparedness,
and response]{.mark}]{.underline}. While it is not possible to eliminate
the possibility of nuclear accidents, it is relevant to consider
imposing regional safety standards to minimize the potential of nuclear
accidents. Beyond that, we can take steps in advance to enhance the
promptness and effectiveness of response measures in the wake of a
nuclear accident. What arrangements are needed both to ensure prompt
notification of others who may be harmed by radioactive contamination
generated by an accident and to minimize lasting harm to humans and the
environment resulting from a nuclear or radiological accident? [Nuclear
fuels and radioactive waste]{.underline}. Dealing with spent nuclear
fuel is [[a **major challenge** with regard to both nuclear-powered
ships and nuclear power plants]{.underline}]{.mark}. Basically, there
are two options: reprocessing and waste disposal, taking into account
that some nuclear waste will remain radioactive for centuries. The fact
that [[there are **no fully affordable methods** for disposing of
nuclear waste]{.mark} has long been a **focus of opposition** to
increased reliance on nuclear energy]{.underline}. If anything[, this
problem is intensified in [the Arctic]{.mark} where the **[environment
is fragile]{.mark}** and there are **limited repositories** for nuclear
waste]{.underline}. Is it feasible to develop reprocessing facilities in
the Arctic? Is it preferable to send nuclear waste to sites outside the
Arctic for long-term storage? [Cleanup of radioactive

In 1867, the U.S. secretary of State, William Seward, struck a deal to
buy Alaska from Russia for 2 cents per acre. Critics panned the deal as
wasteful and labeled it "Seward's Folly." But Seward's strategic
foresight has brought America a bounty of natural resources, a beautiful
new frontier, and a pivotal edge in World War II and in the Cold War.

To this day, the waters off the Alaskan coast supply our nation with
critical petroleum, fish stocks and deep-sea minerals. [Yet, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is losing strategic ground in the Arctic
to]{.mark} our adversaries [Russia and China]{.mark}. A **[decisive

breakers]{.underline} and investing in Arctic infrastructure. [By
contrast, [the U.S.]{.mark} Coast Guard has [just two]{.mark} polar
icebreakers:]{.underline} the Polar Star and the Healy.

Until recently, those two ships divided their efforts at opposite poles
--- the Polar Star resupplying the McMurdo Station in Antarctica, and
the Healy protecting U.S. interests in the Arctic. [A recent shipboard
fire]{.underline} aboard the Healy [has put half of America's polar
icebreaker fleet out of commission.]{.underline} As a result, the Polar
Star is now America's only operational polar icebreaker.

[[This]{.mark} unfortunate turn of events [has created]{.mark} new
[space for Russia and China to **exert maritime influence.**]{.mark}
Both powers are continuing to invest heavily in Arctic-capable assets
[and **erode American influence.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This summer, the Russian Navy conducted its largest war games exercise
since the Cold War near Alaska. Russia has also reopened over 50
previously closed Soviet military facilities and positioned early
warning radar and missile systems near Alaska.

China is upping its polar capabilities by pouring money into the
construction of a fifth Antarctic research station, completing its
second polar icebreaker and conducting six expeditions to the Arctic. In
recent years China has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," achieved
permanent observer status on the multinational Arctic Council and
announced its "Polar Silk Road" economic ambitions.

[The Arctic is a geopolitical convergence point. Without new investment
in polar capabilities, our adversaries\' influence will
grow.]{.underline} The risk is less protection of U.S. commercial and
scientific vessels, weaker enforcement of international law, and an
increasing threat to our national security.

At the center of U.S. efforts to reverse this trend is the Polar
Security Cutter program. This program will produce a fleet of six new
icebreakers --- including the first heavy icebreakers built in U.S.
shipyards in over 40 years. Congress has already funded the first
vessel, which should undergo sea trials by 2024. The Coast Guard has
requested funding for the second vessel.

[[These ships **cannot come fast enough**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even so,
the Coast Guard will have to stretch the service of the Polar Star until
at least 2023, more than two decades beyond the ship's expected useful
life.

[President Donald [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} raised the alarm in June
when he instructed six members of his Cabinet to make recommendations to
achieve "a ready, capable, and available fleet of polar security
icebreakers." The president [[understands that two]{.mark} aged and
broken [icebreakers are a far cry from the needs of the world's]{.mark}
largest trading economy and military [superpower]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Secretary Seward made that historic deal for Alaska 153 years ago. [The
only [folly would be to **cede**]{.mark} **to our adversaries,** through
underinvestment and neglect, [the Arctic advantage]{.mark} the United
States has long enjoyed.]{.underline}

#### Upsetting the Arctic balance of power increases risk of miscalc and arms-race spiral

[[The Arctic,]{.mark} a region [once viewed]{.mark} primarily [as a
frozen frontier]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[has emerged as a stage for
geopolitical competition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rich in untapped
resources and newly accessible shipping routes due to melting ice caps[,
it is [now]{.mark} a zone where [states vie for
influence]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[These rivalries can be understood
through]{.underline}]{.mark} the lens of [[the]{.underline} **[Balance
of Power Theory]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
foundational [[concept]{.underline}]{.mark} in international relations
[[that emphasizes the distribution of power to prevent any one actor
from achieving dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Arctic, long
considered a resource-rich frontier, is drawing global attention due to
its vast untapped reserves of oil and natural gas, estimated to
constitute 22% of the world's undiscovered resources, equivalent to 412
billion barrels of oil equivalent, as per a 2008 US Geological Survey.
Key areas include the West Siberian and East Barents Basins, which
together hold nearly half of these reserves, predominantly natural gas
and natural gas liquids. Historically, regions like Alaska's Beaufort
Sea, Canada's Nunavut, and Russia's Barents Sea have led Arctic oil
exploration. However, the region's development faces significant
technical, political, and environmental challenges. Harsh conditions
demand advanced technologies for infrastructure like pipelines, while
climate change complicates material requirements. The Arctic's fragile
ecosystem and the rights of indigenous peoples necessitate stringent
environmental safeguards, raising costs and potentially delaying
projects. Enhanced transport and spill prevention measures add further
complexities, making Arctic oil development a costly and contentious
endeavor compared to other regions. This article delves into the balance
of power theory to explain the intensifying competition among Arctic
states, integrating insights from key theorists while analyzing how the
theory unfolds in the unique geopolitical dynamics of the Arctic.
Balance of Power Theory: A Primer The balance of power theory posits
that states strive to maintain equilibrium within the international
system to ensure their survival. [[When one state accumulates
disproportionate power, others counterbalance to restore
parity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Scholars like Hans Morgenthau and Kenneth
[[Waltz have argued that balancing behavior]{.underline}]{.mark},
whether through alliances, military build-up, or diplomatic maneuvering,
[[is an inherent feature of the **anarchic international
system**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Arctic's strategic importance stems
from its vast natural resources, including oil, gas, and rare earth
minerals, as well as its potential as a global shipping hub. The
region's geopolitical tensions reflect the interplay of balancing acts
among traditional powers like the United States and Russia, emerging
players like China, and Arctic nations such as Canada and Norway.
Historical Context: The Arctic in International Politics Historically,
the Arctic has been a peripheral region in global geopolitics. However,
the end of the Cold War marked a shift. The Soviet Union's collapse left
Russia with a diminished presence in the Arctic, while other states,
particularly the United States, Canada, and Norway, began asserting
sovereignty over the region. The 21st century has seen the Arctic
transformed into a space of renewed rivalry, driven by climate change,
economic interests, and national security concerns. This transition
aligns with Morton Kaplan's analysis of power dynamics, which highlights
how shifts in the international system lead to regional recalibrations.
Key Arctic Players and Their Strategies 1. Russia: Asserting Dominance
Russia, which controls nearly half of the Arctic coastline, has
aggressively pursued its interests in the region. From military
modernization to resource exploitation, Moscow's actions exemplify John
Mearsheimer's offensive realism, which emphasizes states' tendency to
maximize power in an anarchic world. Russia's Arctic policies include
reactivating Cold War-era bases and conducting military exercises,
signaling its intent to dominate the region. This behavior triggers
balancing actions by other states, illustrating the classical balance of
power dynamics theorized by Edward H. Carr. 2. The United States has
intensified its Arctic presence in response to Russia's actions. Through
military deployments, diplomatic engagement, and collaboration with
allies like Canada and NATO, Washington seeks to counterbalance Moscow's
influence. This aligns with Stephen Walt's concept of \"balance of
threat,\" which refines the balance of power theory by arguing that
states respond not only to power but to perceived threats. Russia's
militarization of the Arctic has heightened the U.S.'s threat
perception, driving its counterbalancing strategies. 3. China: A Rising
Non-Arctic Player China, despite being a non-Arctic state, has declared
itself a \"near-Arctic\" power. Through investments in Arctic
infrastructure and scientific research, Beijing aims to secure access to
resources and establish a foothold in the region. Robert Gilpin's theory
of hegemonic stability sheds light on this dynamic, suggesting that
rising powers like China challenge existing power structures to reshape
the balance. Beijing's Arctic ambitions have prompted resistance from
Arctic states, wary of its growing influence. 4. Arctic Nations:
Sovereignty and Cooperation Countries like Canada, Norway, and Denmark
are balancing their economic aspirations with sovereignty concerns.
While they often collaborate through forums like the Arctic Council,
they also assert territorial claims and enhance military capabilities to
counter potential encroachments. This behavior reflects Hedley Bull's
notion of the \"anarchical society,\" where states operate within a
system of shared norms but remain wary of power imbalances that threaten
their autonomy. Theoretical Insights into Arctic Rivalries 1. Hans
Morgenthau: Power Politics and Arctic Competition Morgenthau, a pioneer
of classical realism, argued that states are driven by the pursuit of
power. In the Arctic, this manifests in military build-ups, territorial
claims, and resource extraction. Russia's aggressive policies and the
U.S.'s countermeasures exemplify Morgenthau's assertion that states act
in their national interest to maximize power. 2. Kenneth Waltz:
Structural Realism in the Arctic Waltz's structural realism, or
neorealism, focuses on the anarchic nature of the international system.
[The Arctic's strategic importance has heightened competition among
states, driven by the system's inherent insecurity.]{.underline} This
structural lens explains why even non-Arctic states like China seek
influence in the region, as power in the Arctic translates to global
strategic advantages. 3. [[Morton]{.mark}]{.underline} Kaplan: Systemic
Shifts and the Arctic [[Kaplan's work on systemic theories highlights
how changes in the global balance of power affect regional
dynamics]{.mark}. The Arctic's transformation from a peripheral to a
contested region reflects these systemic shifts,]{.underline} driven by
economic opportunities and environmental changes. 4. John Mearsheimer:
Offensive Realism and Russian Expansionism Mearsheimer's offensive
realism posits that states seek to maximize power to ensure security.
Russia's Arctic strategies, from militarization to territorial claims,
align with this theory, as [[Moscow aims to **dominate** the region to
safeguard its national interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. 5. Stephen Walt:
Balance of Threat and U.S. Strategy Balance of Power Theory in Emerging
Arctic Rivalries: Explaining Geopolitical Tensions in the Far North 3/4
Walt's balance of threat theory provides a nuanced understanding of U.S.
actions in the Arctic. While Russia's military presence is significant,
it is perceived as a direct threat, prompting Washington's balancing
efforts, such as increased cooperation with NATO allies and Arctic
nations. 6. Robert Gilpin: Hegemonic Stability and China's Role Gilpin's
theory explains how rising powers challenge existing hegemonies. China's
Arctic ambitions, from its Polar Silk Road initiative to investments in
infrastructure, represent a bid to reshape the balance of power in the
region, challenging traditional Arctic states. 7. Hedley Bull:
Anarchical Society and Arctic Governance Bull's concept of an
\"anarchical society\" provides insight into Arctic governance
structures like the Arctic Council. While states cooperate to address
shared challenges, such as climate change, underlying power struggles
persist, reflecting the balance of power dynamics. 8. Edward H. Carr:
Realism and Resource Competition Carr's emphasis on economic resources
as a driver of power politics resonates in the Arctic context. The race
for oil, gas, and minerals has fueled rivalries among states, as control
over these resources enhances national power. 9. Barry Buzan: Regional
Security Complexes Buzan's regional security complex theory highlights
how the Arctic has become a distinct security subsystem. The
interdependence of Arctic states, coupled with external actors like
China, creates a web of rivalries that reflect broader global power
shifts. 10. [Jack]{.underline} Levy: War and Power Transitions [Levy's
work on [power transitions]{.mark} suggests that the Arctic's growing
importance [could lead to **conflicts** as states jostle for
dominance]{.mark}]{.underline}. While outright war remains unlikely[,
[the region's militarization **increases** the risk of
**miscalc**]{.mark}ulations [and crises.]{.mark}]{.underline} 11. Joseph
Nye: Soft Power and Arctic Diplomacy Nye's concept of soft power is
evident in Arctic diplomacy. States like Norway leverage their
reputation for environmental stewardship to influence regional dynamics,
balancing hard power with diplomatic strategies. The Future of the
Arctic Balance of Power The Arctic's geopolitical landscape will likely
remain a complex interplay of cooperation and competition. Climate
change, resource scarcity, and technological advancements will further
intensify rivalries, requiring innovative approaches to governance.
[[The balance of power theory provides a **robust framework** for
understanding these dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}, as states continue to
adjust their strategies in response to shifting power equations.
However, the region's unique characteristics--- its harsh environment,
shared challenges, and indigenous communities---demand a balance between
competition and collaboration. Conclusion: Balancing Rivalries and
Cooperation in the Arctic The Arctic's transformation into a
geopolitical hotspot underscores the enduring relevance of the balance
of power theory. Insights from theorists like Morgenthau, Waltz, and
Mearsheimer reveal how states navigate the region's challenges,
balancing power to safeguard their interests. As Arctic rivalries
intensify, [[the international community must strive for a delicate
equilibrium that ensures]{.mark} both **[stability]{.mark}** and
sustainable development.]{.underline} By embracing a nuanced
understanding of power dynamics, policymakers can chart a course that
secures the Arctic's future as a region of peace, prosperity, and global
significance.

#### Militarization of the Arctic leads to an infinite arms-race spiral, leads to nuclear war and extinction

**Kluth 25**, writer at Bloomberg, former Lecturer at the University of
California, Berkeley, MS in International Relations from the London
School of Economics, BA from William's College (Andreas Kluth, May 23,
2025, "A 'Golden Dome' Could Make America Less Safe," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-05-23/a-golden-dome-could-make-america-less-safe)

Start with [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called **[[security
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[afflicts all]{.mark}
major]{.underline} (and minor) [[powers]{.underline}]{.mark}, with or
without nukes. Hoping to makes itself safer, [[**country A**
develops]{.mark} **new [defenses]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} but
[those]{.mark}]{.underline} defenses in turn [[make]{.mark} **country
[B]{.mark}** [feel **less safe**, prompting it to]{.mark}]{.underline}
arm or [**[escalate]{.mark}** and]{.underline} thereby increase the
threat to country A. At worst, [both]{.underline} A and B enter
a [**spiral [toward war]{.mark}** [that **leaves
everybody**]{.mark}]{.underline} more vulnerable, or even
**[[dead]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Even short of that, any major new weapons system, offensive or
defensive, is destabilizing. One example was Reagan's SDI. The nuclear
confrontation between the US and the Soviet Union had by the early 1980s
become stable thanks to Mutual Assured Destruction: Both powers were
vulnerable to a first strike by the adversary but also had enough nukes
to answer with a second strike that would obliterate the enemy, so that
each deterred the other.

Star Wars promised (Americans) and threatened (Soviets) to remove one
element of this MAD balance: America's vulnerability. The Kremlin, from
1985 led by Mikhail Gorbachev, didn't know whether SDI would ever work
but had to assume it could. In such a scenario, Washington might feel
protected from a second (retaliatory) strike by Moscow, which could
predispose it in a conventional conflict to escalate to a preemptive
nuclear attack. As a result, Star Wars, even though it was defensive,
made the Soviets feel less safe.

The Kremlin had no good options. Economically and technologically, the
Soviet Union was so far behind the US that building its own
missile-defense system was out of the question. If SDI had come close to
realization, the Soviets would have had to contemplate their own
preemptive strike against the US before it became invulnerable --- the
ultimate disaster. As it was, Gorbachev made SDI, along with missiles
and warheads, the subject of his arms-control negotiations with Reagan.
(A different leader might have acted less sagely.)

The situation today is different. First, [[the US
faces]{.underline}]{.mark} not just one threat but several: [the old
**[nuclear]{.mark}** "peer" in **[Russia]{.mark}**, the
"near-peer"]{.underline} rising nuclear power [of **[China]{.mark}**,
the rogue atomic actors in **[No]{.mark}**]{.underline}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea ([and]{.underline} possibly
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** if it builds a bomb), [[and]{.mark}
unpredictable players such as **[Pakistan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
main antagonists in war games are [Russia and China. [They
**could collude** in]{.mark} an [**attack** on the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike the old Soviet Union, China in
particular can also match the US economically and technologically and
build its own dome or new and more diabolical weapons.

It is already doing that, in fact. Like the US and Russia,
**[China]{.underline}** nowadays [has **much faster** missiles that can
take more eccentric **flight paths**]{.underline} and carry more
independently targeted warheads, [[overwhelming]{.underline}]{.mark}
almost [[**any defensive system** by]{.mark} **sheer [numbers]{.mark}**.
Beijing also has a **hypersonic**]{.underline} glide vehicle. Whereas
ballistic missiles have to re-enter the atmosphere in a predictable arc,
these vehicles can maneuver in the atmosphere, concealing their target
--- and all of it [at **many times** the **speed of
sound**]{.underline}. If Golden Dome mainly looks up at the skies, it
might not catch these death darts coming in low from the sides.

Moreover, many of the Golden Dome's sensors and interceptors would be
**[[in space]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Seth Moulton, a congressman on
the House Armed Services Committee, pointed out during a hearing, the
[[Russians are]{.underline}]{.mark} reportedly [[preparing]{.mark} to
**place [nukes up there]{.mark}**. Why wouldn't they]{.underline}, or
the Chinese, **[[detonate those]{.underline}]{.mark}** at the start of
an attack [[to **take out**]{.mark} the [American]{.mark}]{.underline}
space [**[interceptors]{.mark}** first?]{.underline} (Responding to
Golden Dome, the Chinese this week warned that it might turn "outer
space into a battlefield.")

And why only look up if the threat could also come from below? As
Moulton observed, submarines can launch nukes too and "you can run a
boat up into Los Angeles Harbor, right? It's clear that Golden Dome is
not designed to defend against that."

In short, new American defenses, even before they become operational,
will force adversaries to recalculate their own assumptions and
strategies. The Chinese have already said that they are "gravely
concerned" about **[[Golden Dome]{.underline}]{.mark}** and worry that
it [[will **jeopardize**]{.mark} "strategic balance and
**[stability]{.mark}**."]{.underline} One of their [fears]{.underline}
is that [the US, feeling secure]{.underline} from retaliation, [could
**blackmail** them]{.underline} with nuclear threats [to **stand down**
in a conflict]{.underline} over Taiwan.

#### Conflict in the Arctic low unless the US increases its military icebreaker capabilities

Robert D. **English**, 6-18-20**20**, \"Why an Arctic arms race would be
a mistake,\" ArcticToday,
https://www.arctictoday.com/why-an-arctic-arms-race-would-be-a-mistake///nishant

[[Most of America's historic foreign policy blunders were driven by
**threat inflation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} From fake attacks on ships in
Havana Harbor or the Gulf of Tonkin, to falling dominos in Southeast
Asia and WMD in Iraq --- the response to these "dire threats" is often a
costly quagmire. [In the Cold War it was phony bomber and missile "gaps"
that sparked a precarious and ultimately pointless nuclear
confrontation.]{.underline} [[Today a new "icebreaker gap" could
**fuel** an Arctic arms race.]{.underline}]{.mark}

For over a decade, defense hawks have been sounding the alarm about
Russia's supposed "militarization" and "dominance" of the Arctic. More
recently, China has joined the list of "aggressors" allegedly
threatening vital Western economic and strategic interests in the High
North. The Obama administration resisted calls for a major Arctic
buildup coming from a mix of armchair analysts, defense contractors, and
special political interests. Notably, the U.S. Navy has never joined
this chorus. Nobody denies the need for some new heavy icebreakers to
buttress an aging fleet, but these are for Coast Guard missions --- not
the remote warfighting scenarios hyped by Arctic hawks. [[Theirs is
classic threat inflation, built on equal parts **exaggeration and
ignorance**,]{.mark} that makes it irresistible to a Trump
administration happy to overturn yet another Obama legacy. [And so, with
a recent series of provocative words and deeds, America's Arctic policy
has taken an abruptly **belligerent turn**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This is another historic mistake, not only because it could lead to
costly and dangerous confrontation in an extremely fragile region, but
because its entire premise is false.]{.underline} Once a superpower
rival in the High North, [Russia's Arctic presence imploded after the
Cold War leaving America and its NATO allies militarily dominant.
Retreating from rivalry, Russia joined other regional states in a new
Arctic Council that has proved a model of shared global governance,
fostering cooperation in areas from environmental protection and search
and rescue to commercial shipping and fisheries]{.underline}.
Importantly, Arctic Council members agreed over a decade ago to settle
any territorial disputes through the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea framework --- and have scrupulously kept to that
agreement[. [It is **simply false** that Russia threatens to seize the
North Pole seabed or other Arctic territory, or that China, a nonvoting
observer at the Arctic Council, threatens to **undermine the
independence** of regional states through its so-called "Polar Silk
Road."]{.underline}]{.mark}

What Russia has done, after the collapse of its northern military
presence in the 1990s, is invest in new security infrastructure of an
essentially defensive character --- which only makes sense, given NATO's
offensive advantages and Russia's dependence on Arctic petroleum,
minerals, and shipping routes for its economic survival. For its part,
China has joined the global polar research establishment, invested
several billion dollars in regional resource projects, and demonstrated
its keen interest in Russia's northern shipping route --- which only
makes sense given China's dependence on trade between Europe and Asia.
Beijing's Arctic presence is both legal and limited --- nothing like the
nefarious web of influence that is often suggested, making it simply
weird that China's self-identification as a "near-Arctic" state causes
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to erupt in fury.

More than a decade of investment in [rebuilding its Arctic military
presence has still not returned Russia to its level of the
1980s.]{.underline} [Its **problem-plagued** Northern Fleet is also
puny, just a few dozen surface ships and a similar number of
submarines.]{.underline} Many of these vessels are obsolescent and ---
notwithstanding the hype accompanying recent exercises --- [constitute a
force mainly suited for coastal defense. Similarly, Russia's Arctic air
power is far outclassed by NATO's,]{.underline} lacking both the range
(due to minimal in-air refueling assets) and sophistication (Russia
still has yet to deploy true fifth-generation "stealth" aircraft, such
as NATO's F-22s and F-35s) needed for serious power projection. They
mainly fly from the same distant airfields as 20 years ago because
[Russia's much-ballyhooed "new Arctic bases" are too small]{.underline}
--- [and **lack the infrastructure**]{.underline} --- to house even a
single fighter squadron much less a full air wing.

What they can support are anti-air and anti-ship defensive missile
batteries. But these, of course, are really only useful for defending
while their supposed "area denial" capabilities are much exaggerated.

In other words, [[Moscow has **severely limited power-projection**
capability and has structured its forces to protect its own shores. As
for the oft-mentioned "icebreaker gap," Russia's large fleet of
icebreakers is dedicated to escorting commercial shipping through
dangerous polar seas. Otherwise, it performs the **same missions** as
the U.S. Coast Guard: search and rescue, anti-smuggling, oil spill
response, and resupply of remote coastal communities and polar research
stations.]{.underline}]{.mark} Given the critical importance of Russia's
vast Arctic territory to its economic and scientific interests (Russia's
Arctic coastline is ten times longer than America's) [[an "icebreaker
gap" **is to be expected.** It has nominal military significance at
best.]{.underline}]{.mark}

But that has not stopped the Trump administration from [trumpeting [the
false narrative of Russian "Arctic aggression," which it has recently
followed with **several aggressive steps**]{.mark} of its own:
undermining an Arctic Council ministerial meeting in Finland with
bombast and threats; denouncing its Danish allies for rejecting a
ridiculous offer to purchase Greenland; [announcing the potential
acquisition of foreign Arctic bases along with armed, nuclear-powered
icebreakers; and sending a naval flotilla close to Russia's Arctic coast
in a dramatic show of force.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The U.S. rejects Russia's claim of dominion over some territorial waters
as exceeding what the UNCLOS permits, and [Trump administration
officials have called for even more **intrusive "freedom of
navigation"** operations to demonstrate that rejection forcefully. But
some cannot help noting that the U.S. does not actively challenge
Canada's identical claims in its own Arctic waters, and that the U.S.
itself has never ratified UNCLOS]{.underline} --- which might be a
better first step toward a diplomatic, rather than military, resolution.
[[Perhaps the strongest argument against such shows of force in the
Russian Arctic is that they are needlessly, **dangerously
provocative**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### **Low risk for Conflict right now but increasing icebreaker presence destabilizes the Arctic and leads to conflict**

**Matthew Hickey, 11-18-2019, \"The Arctic Is Not All It's Cracked Up To
Be,\" Georgetown Security Studies Review,
https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/11/18/the-arctic-is-not-all-its-cracked-up-to-be///nishant**

If the Arctic is not profitable, then perhaps it is still strategically
valuable. [Many defense officials cite Russia's military build-up as a
sign the Arctic is an emerging battleground or perhaps a place of great
military stand-off.]{.underline}\[xii\] Russia is occupying Cold War
bases and is amassing an enormous Arctic force. It floated a nuclear
power plant across Arctic waters and planted a titanium flag beneath the
North Pole. But despite this, the sentiment is now changing regarding
the strategic value of the Arctic. [As [recently]{.mark} as April 2019,
the [Navy's new Arctic strategic outlook perceives the Arctic to be at
"**low risk for conflict."\[**]{.mark}xiii\] [For now, Russia is all
bark, and no bite]{.mark}.\[xiv\] ]{.underline}

[[This is largely because Russia's military activity is **defensive** in
nature]{.underline}.]{.mark} Russia's foreign minister has stated, "[We
don't threaten anyone. We ensure sufficient defense capabilities given
the political and military situation around our
borders."\[]{.underline}xv\] Of course, Sergey Lavrov's comments have
been met with skepticism, but there is reason to believe him. Studies by
the Arctic Institute suggest Russia is motivated by the potential gains
achievable through cooperation like shared search and rescue and route
charting.\[xvi\] 

And finally, on a practical note, [[there is **nothing** to fight for in
the Arctic]{.mark}. All land disputes are resolved or irrelevant (the
Hans Island dispute, for example) and most Exclusive Economic Zone
disputes are resolved.]{.underline} [[Securitizing the Arctic would
**destabilize it**. If U.S. and NATO forces begin aggressively
patrolling the Arctic, it justifies Russia's actions. Military posturing
**increases chances for miscalculation.**]{.underline}]{.mark} As Robert
Huebert, professor of Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary and
acclaimed Arctic expert, sees it, [an Arctic security dilemma is on the
horizon if not already here.\[xvii\]   Frankly, if Russia wants to
patrol the Arctic and expend its resources in a futile, frozen ocean
then let it. America has what it needs. If it is needed in the Arctic,
the U.S. will go. For now, it is needed elsewhere, and if Russian
efforts are depleted in those places because of its Arctic front, all
the better.]{.underline}

[[The Arctic hype is wrong. The region is not all it's cracked up to be:
It's not profitable, it's not safe to transit, it's not a reliable place
to operate. It is cold, dark, and **irrelevant**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Don't believe anyone that thinks otherwise.

Russia's Arctic military posture. If anything, [[Moscow's obsessive
search for complete control over the Arctic Zone of the Russian
Federation (AZRF) has been **vindicated** by wider geopolitical
developments]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nevertheless, Finland's and Sweden's
accession to NATO is making Russia feel more vulnerable from a military
point of view.

This self-perception of vulnerability will inform how Russia projects
itself in the region, especially through low intensity warfare
operations against NATO and its allies -- which in turn raises the risk
of miscalculation and escalation in a changing Arctic.

Posture change in the context of 'NATO's expansion'

From Moscow's viewpoint, the perceived 'enlargement' of NATO to Finland
and Sweden is fueling both a sense of vindication and vulnerability
across the AZRF -- geographically extending from the North Atlantic and
the European High North, to North Pole approaches in the Central Arctic,
to the North Pacific and the Bering Strait.

On the one hand, Russia's self-inflicted fear of 'encirclement'1) by the
Atlantic Alliance has been validated by Finland and Sweden joining NATO.
The double accession represents a fait accompli for the Kremlin, honed
by a self-reinforcing propagandistic narrative that the Alliance is
turning the Arctic into a 'conflict zone'2) or that there is a 'new Cold
War'3) in the region because of Western policy.

This narrative is compounded by the recent release of the US National
Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR) in 2022 and the US Department of
Defense Arctic Strategy in 2024, which are also denounced as 'deciding
the region's future by force'4) or 'inviting confrontation'5) in the
Arctic.

Finland and Sweden joining the Alliance further fuels the Russian logic
that the non-Russian Arctic has become 'NATO territory'. This ends up
creating a 'NATO 7 vs. Russia'6) approach, which tends to securitize
Arctic affairs and shape discussions increasingly in military terms. The
policy consequences are that Moscow is planning more than ever for all
contingencies, including open military confrontation in the Arctic.

On the other hand, from a previous perception of relative regional
strength and assertive force posture, the impact of the war has led
Moscow to feel vulnerable in the Arctic. This vulnerability is strategic
(with the perceived 'expansion' of NATO) and military, especially with
regards to the impact of climate change and receding sea ice across the
AZRF.

[[The Russian **leadership fears** that a more accessible Arctic will
bring along more military activity from NATO]{.mark} and its allies in
the European Arctic]{.underline} and above North Pole approaches. [[It
also fears there will be more military presence from the US and
Canada]{.mark} in the Pacific Arctic]{.underline} -- alongside Chinese

Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, where strategic bombers are stationed, also
[[**reinforces** their sense of vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} --
not least by defying the genuine effectiveness of Russian regional air
defense capabilities.

Ultimately, Moscow does not want to be dispossessed of its control over
the AZRF. [[The fact that NATO's direct borders with Russia have
increased in size in the Arctic and Baltic theaters will undoubtedly
push the Kremlin to adapt its force projection.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate

the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region as
a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: "We need to pursue joint
projects, including, for example, in the Arctic." The Arctic region
makes sense as a setting for cooperation as the two sides have
explicitly expressed interest in exploring cooperation in energy,
investment, and geopolitical issues. [Western [sanctions on

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can

China has increasingly focused on the Arctic in recent years, declaring
itself in 2018 a "near-Arctic state" and has developed fishing, energy
and transportation interests in the region. The prospect of new shipping

#### Increasing presence in the Arctic causes Conflict 

Maxwell **Simon**, Alexandra Huber, 12-20-20**19**, \"Bad Idea?
Aggressively Countering Russian Action in the Arctic,\" Defense360,
https://defense360.csis.org/bad-idea-aggressively-countering-russian-action-in-the-arctic///nishant

As Arctic temperatures rise and the region undergoes extreme
environmental change, new economic, scientific, maritime, and political
opportunities have led to the gradual militarization of the region and
its potential as a new theater for strategic competition between the
United States and Russia. Previously impassable areas are becoming
increasingly accessible to navigation and exploitation due to
diminishing sea ice coverage, opening commercial routes through the
Arctic Ocean that can shorten travel times between Europe and Asia by as
much as 40 percent. [Russia---whose military footprint and territorial
claims in the region dwarf those of the United States---has become more
assertive in the Arctic, raising questions of how the United States and
its allies can best achieve their Arctic objectives, and of the region's
relevance and role in emerging great power competition.]{.underline}
Amid such rapid change, the strategic outlook of the Arctic over the
next two decades---whether cooperative or competitive---is an open
question.

The following is a point-counterpoint analysis that seeks to answer the
question: Is aggressively countering Russian action in the Arctic a bad
idea? Maxwell Simon (MS) argues that seeking to match Russia's presence
is a bad idea while Alexandra Huber (AH) counters that avoiding a strong
rebalance in the face of Russian action is the real bad idea.

How would you characterize Russia's behavior in the Arctic?

MS: Russia has committed significant resources to energy extraction and
the militarization of the Arctic by reactivating Cold War military
installations, modernizing submarine and missile capabilities, and
reorganizing its regional assets under one command in the Northern Joint
Strategic Command. Russia also poses a significant threat to NATO in
general. Nevertheless[, [given limited resources, it would be a **bad
idea** for the United States to overreact and develop a hyperfocus on
the Arctic, where its interests are limited and U.S.-Russian interaction
is largely cooperative.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Compared to Russia---who
relies upon Arctic resource extraction for 15-20 percent of its annual
economy and expects the region to provide \$500 billion in annual GDP by
2030, or 30 percent of its current GDP---[U.S. strategic interests in
the Arctic are **minimal** (less than a third of one percent of U.S. GDP
comes from the Arctic).]{.mark}]{.underline} While Russia has a sizeable
nuclear footprint along the Kola Peninsula and ascribes immense
importance to maintaining its sea-based nuclear deterrent in the Arctic,
the United States stations none of its nuclear weapons in the region and
does not patrol it with any of its nuclear-armed submarines (SSBNs).
Thus, as a CSIS Europe Program report states, it is "understandable"
that Russia has enhanced its Arctic capabilities to account for
increased activity along its northern coastline.

Moreover, Russia's buildup should not be overstated: the majority of its
existing icebreakers will be decommissioned over the next several years,
deep-sea port construction has encountered problems and delays, economic
infrastructure remains extremely sparse, and the Arctic is still
significantly less militarized than other regions where the United
States and NATO compete with Russia. Put in context with Russia's wider
military modernization efforts, its allocation of resources to the
Arctic are no more concerning than its behavior elsewhere, as the
majority of its new naval assets are going to other theaters.

[Indeed, interaction in the Arctic between the United States and Russia
is highly cooperative, even as NATO-Russian relations have
worsened]{.underline} elsewhere on a range of issues in the aftermath of
the Ukraine crisis---such as U.S.-Russia withdrawal from the INF Treaty,
sanctions imposition, and removal of Russia from the G8. Moscow has
remained an active participant in the Arctic Council, the Arctic Coast
Guard Forum (ACGF), and numerous environmental and scientific treaties.

AH: Russia's recent Arctic development efforts have crossed into
potentially dangerous areas of naval competition. Total sovereignty over
a sizeable area of the ocean provides the Russian Navy an ideal
opportunity for weapon and tactical development safe from interference
and virtually unmonitored by potential Western adversaries. While many
Soviet-era submarines and icebreakers are scheduled to be decommissioned
by the end of 2019, the Russian Navy plans to replace them with new
warships delivered in 2020. As Russian military forces edge closer to
Norwegian territory -- the only other country with a claim to the
Barents Sea -- Putin's intentions in the Arctic appear increasingly
hostile.

The 2010 "agreed demarcation line" between Russia and Norway no longer
provides the same level of assurance for the West that it once did. In
October 2019, the Barents Observer noted the launch and start of
underwater weapons testing in the Norwegian Sea, just a day after a
peaceful meeting between Russian and Norwegian military leaders. Two
Russian Sierra-class nuclear-powered submarines sailed into the
Norwegian Sea to begin deep-diving exercises and underwater weapons
training and testing. According to Norwegian military officials,"\[The
Russians\] are rebuilding the Northern Fleet, building new submarines;
they're flying more; they are exercising more in the northwest of Russia
with their battalions..." Russian weapons training within Scandinavian
territory , where significant NATO anti-submarine operations were
conducted during the Cold War, is ongoing and hostile. In response to
the latest Russian exercise in these waters in November 2019, Norwegian
intelligence concluded that "\[t\]he aim of the massive operation is to
get as far out to the North Atlantic as possible without being
discovered by NATO." Although Russia appears cooperative within larger
Arctic institutions such as the Arctic Council or ACGF, the Russian
Navy's actions in the area speak significantly louder than adherence to
diplomatic agreements.

What role should NATO play in the Arctic? How should the U.S. respond to
the Arctic challenge?

MS: Though Russian submarine exercises and weapons tests are concerning,
especially in Norway's backyard, cooperation has been the predominant
pattern of U.S.-Russian interaction in the Arctic since the end of the
Cold War. [It is important not to overstate Russian aggression in the
Arctic; Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg has said the Arctic does
not pose core security concerns today, and [other Norwegian analysts
have suggested they "**do not consider a conflict
likely."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The same cannot be said for Europe or the Indo-Pacific, where U.S.
interests are considerably more robust. Practically, the shift in U.S.
and NATO strategic goals that would be required to match Russian
capabilities and credibly compete with Moscow in the Arctic is not
feasible. While Russia has twenty-two fully operational military
icebreakers, the United States only has two. There is also no consensus
within NATO if the Arctic is an area of military concern; [[Canada, an
"Arctic Five" littoral state, has said repeatedly that it does not
believe NATO should play any role in Arctic
matters.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Given limited resources, [[the United States]{.mark} and NATO
[should]{.mark} be focusing on regions of existing contention with
Russia, [not simply shifting military capabilities to a region out of
some ill-defined need to "match" Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Aggressively rebalancing Russia in the Arctic is also not
desirable.]{.mark} There are many feasible scenarios where military
confrontation could break out]{.underline}---[over resource competition,
territorial disputes, and unsanctioned passage through the Northern Sea
Route, to name a few. [But the most plausible scenario that could drive
military conflict and greater frequency of Russian military exercises is
a larger NATO military presence.]{.mark} Given Moscow's sensitivity to
strategic encirclement, a concern that has extended into the Arctic,
increasing NATO operations are likely to contribute to the security
dilemma and increase the likelihood of misperception and miscalculation,
undermining strategic stability in a rapidly changing region where there
is currently no mechanism for dialogue on security issues.]{.underline}

[The United States and its allies must find a way to preserve their
influence in an increasingly important region without making military
conflict more likely.]{.underline} For one, improving intelligence,
reconnaissance, surveillance (ISR) and communications infrastructure is
a pivotal, though less antagonistic, way to improve Arctic operational
readiness. The United States and its allies could utilize unmanned
aerial systems, high altitude balloons, and satellites in highly
elliptical orbits (HEO), which spend extended periods over the Arctic,
to close the positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) gap and monitor
Russian assets in the region. [Perhaps more importantly, since there is
currently no Arctic security forum that includes Russia, Arctic states
should use NATO's established dialogue channels with Moscow through the
NATO-Russia Council,]{.underline} as Dr. Rebecca Pincus has advocated.
[[While NATO's military function would be **counterproductive**, its
political-organizational function could help to lower the likelihood of
miscommunication.]{.mark} This forum would also open the possibility for
greater collaboration on rules to govern the region as it becomes more
accessible to other actors.]{.underline}

[Ultimately, at a time of extreme regional flux, it would be a bad idea
to aggressively rebalance to the Arctic.]{.underline}

AH: Due to Russia's increasingly aggressive mining of Arctic natural
resources and rapid military development, NATO stands a significant
chance of being overwhelmed in the Arctic by Russia economically and
militarily in the next decade. In addition, the development of the
Russian transnational pipeline Nord Stream 2 and Russia's current
relationship with China pose an environmental hazard which threatens
current Arctic Council environmental agreements.

In a May 2019 report, the CSIS Europe Program argued that "The greatest
failing of U.S. policy has been its reluctance to understand the
strategic implications of great power competition in the Arctic." While
the competition here does not necessarily determine total Arctic
superiority, it is crucial to maintain strategic preparedness against
hostile neighbors as well as ensure Russian acts in the Arctic are kept
within both physical and diplomatic confines.

If the United States is to uphold its reputation as a responsible NATO
ally, ignoring this increasingly dire situation is not the answer. While
Norway is one of the strongest of its regional allies, further
assistance in their region is needed to counter the superiority of the
Russian Northern Fleet and its weapons development. Stricter ocean
border controls on the edges of Russia's Arctic territory are vital for
Norwegian national security and to prevent Russian naval forces from
moving closer to the West. Increased deployment of NATO ground troops
and continued military emergency drills in the Arctic would provide
Norway the means to enforce these controls as well as sending a warning
to the Russian forces that continue to close in on Norway's border.

Proactive steps by NATO are necessary to ensure future international
stability in the Arctic. If NATO maintains its passivity towards Russian
military advancement and aggression in the Arctic and continues to
ignore Norwegian authorities' concerns over Russia hostility and
military action, this could be a bad idea with more significant
repercussions in future decades.

A Better Way to Think About Arctic Defense

As the United States approaches the potential of competition extending
to the Arctic, it should place the region in a broader geopolitical
context, consider a broader set of tools to advance U.S. interests, and
carefully weigh the opportunity costs of pushing the Coast Guard to take
on a central role in regional competition.

The best way to deal with China and Russia in the Arctic is to address
disputes in their own backyards. Most of the pathways to a great-power
crisis that could end up affecting the Arctic stem from crises outside
the region. [[Engaging Russia and China elsewhere]{.mark} [rather than
focusing on]{.mark} specific capabilities in the Arctic, including
[icebreakers, will]{.mark} thus [have salutary
effects.]{.mark}]{.underline} The nominal Defense Department approach is
to enhance a combat-credible forward presence in Eastern Europe and the
Indo-Pacific. By deterring a conflict there, the logic goes, the Arctic
is less likely to suffer negative "strategic spillover." [[A
fixation]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the number of
[icebreakers]{.mark},]{.underline} or ice-hardened vessels more
generally, [as part of competing with Russia or China in the Arctic can
[lead to **unnecessary investments** and **divert military
assets**]{.mark} better utilized elsewhere.]{.underline} Alternative
approaches might focus on some form of grand bargain or a more
restrained U.S. foreign policy to alleviate tensions. The hope of this
approach is that it might broadly reduce competition. That would then
also have benefits for the Arctic.

Local defense [challenges]{.underline} in the Arctic will remain, of
course. Those [should be addressed using political and economic
diplomacy]{.underline} and refining military concepts and capabilities
as necessary. [[**Resisting the temptation** to engage in]{.mark}
numerical comparisons of [icebreakers will]{.mark} help [avoid
**alarmist views** that]{.mark} may [contribute to tensions
and]{.mark}]{.underline}, at worst, [the [militarization]{.mark} of the
region]{.underline} if the Pentagon deploys new resources in response to
that perceived vulnerability. Other concerns, such as China's interest
in building airports in Greenland, are best dealt with by diplomatic,
information, and economic tools rather than military platforms (though
trying to buy Greenland probably isn't the best approach). Even if a
larger defense role in the Arctic is warranted, [the United States
should focus first on developing concepts for existing assets,
determining what infrastructure requires modernization, and carefully
examining]{.underline} how [initiatives elsewhere]{.underline} can
benefit regional security and minimize challenges emerging from the
region.

#### **Russia feels threatened if the US increases Icebreakers**

a mistake,\" ArcticToday,
https://www.arctictoday.com/why-an-arctic-arms-race-would-be-a-mistake///nishant

[[Most of America's historic foreign policy blunders were driven by
**threat inflation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} From fake attacks on ships in
Havana Harbor or the Gulf of Tonkin, to falling dominos in Southeast
Asia and WMD in Iraq --- the response to these "dire threats" is often a
costly quagmire. [In the Cold War it was phony bomber and missile "gaps"
that sparked a precarious and ultimately pointless nuclear
confrontation.]{.underline} [[Today a new "icebreaker gap" could
**fuel** an Arctic arms race.]{.underline}]{.mark}

For over a decade, defense hawks have been sounding the alarm about
Russia's supposed "militarization" and "dominance" of the Arctic. More
recently, China has joined the list of "aggressors" allegedly
threatening vital Western economic and strategic interests in the High
North. The Obama administration resisted calls for a major Arctic
buildup coming from a mix of armchair analysts, defense contractors, and
special political interests. Notably, the U.S. Navy has never joined
this chorus. Nobody denies the need for some new heavy icebreakers to
buttress an aging fleet, but these are for Coast Guard missions --- not
the remote warfighting scenarios hyped by Arctic hawks. [[Theirs is
classic threat inflation, built on equal parts **exaggeration and
ignorance**,]{.mark} that makes it irresistible to a Trump
administration happy to overturn yet another Obama legacy. [And so, with
a recent series of provocative words and deeds, America's Arctic policy
has taken an abruptly **belligerent turn**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This is another historic mistake, not only because it could lead to
costly and dangerous confrontation in an extremely fragile region, but
because its entire premise is false.]{.underline} Once a superpower
rival in the High North, [Russia's Arctic presence imploded after the
Cold War leaving America and its NATO allies militarily dominant.
Retreating from rivalry, Russia joined other regional states in a new
Arctic Council that has proved a model of shared global governance,
fostering cooperation in areas from environmental protection and search
and rescue to commercial shipping and fisheries]{.underline}.
Importantly, Arctic Council members agreed over a decade ago to settle
any territorial disputes through the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea framework --- and have scrupulously kept to that
agreement[. [It is **simply false** that Russia threatens to seize the
North Pole seabed or other Arctic territory, or that China, a nonvoting
observer at the Arctic Council, threatens to **undermine the
independence** of regional states through its so-called "Polar Silk
Road."]{.underline}]{.mark}

What Russia has done, after the collapse of its northern military
presence in the 1990s, is invest in new security infrastructure of an
essentially defensive character --- which only makes sense, given NATO's
offensive advantages and Russia's dependence on Arctic petroleum,
minerals, and shipping routes for its economic survival. For its part,
China has joined the global polar research establishment, invested
several billion dollars in regional resource projects, and demonstrated
its keen interest in Russia's northern shipping route --- which only
makes sense given China's dependence on trade between Europe and Asia.
Beijing's Arctic presence is both legal and limited --- nothing like the
nefarious web of influence that is often suggested, making it simply
weird that China's self-identification as a "near-Arctic" state causes
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to erupt in fury.

More than a decade of investment in [rebuilding its Arctic military
presence has still not returned Russia to its level of the
1980s.]{.underline} [Its **problem-plagued** Northern Fleet is also
puny, just a few dozen surface ships and a similar number of
submarines.]{.underline} Many of these vessels are obsolescent and ---
notwithstanding the hype accompanying recent exercises --- [constitute a
force mainly suited for coastal defense. Similarly, Russia's Arctic air
power is far outclassed by NATO's,]{.underline} lacking both the range
(due to minimal in-air refueling assets) and sophistication (Russia
still has yet to deploy true fifth-generation "stealth" aircraft, such
as NATO's F-22s and F-35s) needed for serious power projection. They
mainly fly from the same distant airfields as 20 years ago because
[Russia's much-ballyhooed "new Arctic bases" are too small]{.underline}
--- [and **lack the infrastructure**]{.underline} --- to house even a
single fighter squadron much less a full air wing.

What they can support are anti-air and anti-ship defensive missile
batteries. But these, of course, are really only useful for defending
while their supposed "area denial" capabilities are much exaggerated.

In other words, [[Moscow has **severely limited power-projection**
capability and has structured its forces to protect its own shores. As
for the oft-mentioned "icebreaker gap," Russia's large fleet of
icebreakers is dedicated to escorting commercial shipping through
dangerous polar seas. Otherwise, it performs the **same missions** as
the U.S. Coast Guard: search and rescue, anti-smuggling, oil spill
response, and resupply of remote coastal communities and polar research
stations.]{.underline}]{.mark} Given the critical importance of Russia's
vast Arctic territory to its economic and scientific interests (Russia's
Arctic coastline is ten times longer than America's) [[an "icebreaker
gap" **is to be expected.** It has nominal military significance at
best.]{.underline}]{.mark}

But that has not stopped the Trump administration from [trumpeting [the
false narrative of Russian "Arctic aggression," which it has recently
followed with **several aggressive steps**]{.mark} of its own:
undermining an Arctic Council ministerial meeting in Finland with
bombast and threats; denouncing its Danish allies for rejecting a
ridiculous offer to purchase Greenland; [announcing the potential
acquisition of foreign Arctic bases along with armed, nuclear-powered
icebreakers; and sending a naval flotilla close to Russia's Arctic coast
in a dramatic show of force.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The U.S. rejects Russia's claim of dominion over some territorial waters
as exceeding what the UNCLOS permits, and [Trump administration
officials have called for even more **intrusive "freedom of
navigation"** operations to demonstrate that rejection forcefully. But
some cannot help noting that the U.S. does not actively challenge
Canada's identical claims in its own Arctic waters, and that the U.S.
itself has never ratified UNCLOS]{.underline} --- which might be a
better first step toward a diplomatic, rather than military, resolution.
[[Perhaps the strongest argument against such shows of force in the
Russian Arctic is that they are needlessly, **dangerously
provocative**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### **Russia isn't threatening. The plan GIVES Russia an excuse to attack.**

Be,\" Georgetown Security Studies Review,
https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2019/11/18/the-arctic-is-not-all-its-cracked-up-to-be///nishant**

If the Arctic is not profitable, then perhaps it is still strategically
valuable. [Many defense officials cite Russia's military build-up as a
sign the Arctic is an emerging battleground or perhaps a place of great
military stand-off.]{.underline}\[xii\] Russia is occupying Cold War
bases and is amassing an enormous Arctic force. It floated a nuclear
power plant across Arctic waters and planted a titanium flag beneath the
North Pole. But despite this, the sentiment is now changing regarding
the strategic value of the Arctic. [As [recently]{.mark} as April 2019,
the [Navy's new Arctic strategic outlook perceives the Arctic to be at
"**low risk for conflict."\[**]{.mark}xiii\] [For now, Russia is all
bark, and no bite]{.mark}.\[xiv\] ]{.underline}

[[This is largely because Russia's military activity is **defensive** in
nature]{.underline}.]{.mark} Russia's foreign minister has stated, "[We
don't threaten anyone. We ensure sufficient defense capabilities given
the political and military situation around our
borders."\[]{.underline}xv\] Of course, Sergey Lavrov's comments have
been met with skepticism, but there is reason to believe him. Studies by
the Arctic Institute suggest Russia is motivated by the potential gains
achievable through cooperation like shared search and rescue and route
charting.\[xvi\] 

And finally, on a practical note, [[there is **nothing** to fight for in
the Arctic]{.mark}. All land disputes are resolved or irrelevant (the
Hans Island dispute, for example) and most Exclusive Economic Zone
disputes are resolved.]{.underline} [[Securitizing the Arctic would
**destabilize it**. If U.S. and NATO forces begin aggressively
patrolling the Arctic, it justifies Russia's actions. Military posturing
**increases chances for miscalculation.**]{.underline}]{.mark} As Robert
Huebert, professor of Strategic Studies at the University of Calgary and
acclaimed Arctic expert, sees it, [an Arctic security dilemma is on the
horizon if not already here.\[xvii\]   Frankly, if Russia wants to
patrol the Arctic and expend its resources in a futile, frozen ocean
then let it. America has what it needs. If it is needed in the Arctic,
the U.S. will go. For now, it is needed elsewhere, and if Russian
efforts are depleted in those places because of its Arctic front, all
the better.]{.underline}

[[The Arctic hype is wrong. The region is not all it's cracked up to be:
It's not profitable, it's not safe to transit, it's not a reliable place
to operate. It is cold, dark, and **irrelevant**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Don't believe anyone that thinks otherwise.

#### **Increasing presence in the Arctic causes Conflict** 

**Maxwell Simon, Alexandra Huber, 12-20-2019, \"Bad Idea? Aggressively
Countering Russian Action in the Arctic,\" Defense360,
https://defense360.csis.org/bad-idea-aggressively-countering-russian-action-in-the-arctic///nishant**

As Arctic temperatures rise and the region undergoes extreme
environmental change, new economic, scientific, maritime, and political
opportunities have led to the gradual militarization of the region and
its potential as a new theater for strategic competition between the
United States and Russia. Previously impassable areas are becoming
increasingly accessible to navigation and exploitation due to
diminishing sea ice coverage, opening commercial routes through the
Arctic Ocean that can shorten travel times between Europe and Asia by as
much as 40 percent. [Russia---whose military footprint and territorial
claims in the region dwarf those of the United States---has become more
assertive in the Arctic, raising questions of how the United States and
its allies can best achieve their Arctic objectives, and of the region's
relevance and role in emerging great power competition.]{.underline}
Amid such rapid change, the strategic outlook of the Arctic over the
next two decades---whether cooperative or competitive---is an open
question.

The following is a point-counterpoint analysis that seeks to answer the
question: Is aggressively countering Russian action in the Arctic a bad
idea? Maxwell Simon (MS) argues that seeking to match Russia's presence
is a bad idea while Alexandra Huber (AH) counters that avoiding a strong
rebalance in the face of Russian action is the real bad idea.

How would you characterize Russia's behavior in the Arctic?

MS: Russia has committed significant resources to energy extraction and
the militarization of the Arctic by reactivating Cold War military
installations, modernizing submarine and missile capabilities, and
reorganizing its regional assets under one command in the Northern Joint
Strategic Command. Russia also poses a significant threat to NATO in
general. Nevertheless[, [given limited resources, it would be a **bad
idea** for the United States to overreact and develop a hyperfocus on
the Arctic, where its interests are limited and U.S.-Russian interaction
is largely cooperative.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Compared to Russia---who
relies upon Arctic resource extraction for 15-20 percent of its annual
economy and expects the region to provide \$500 billion in annual GDP by
2030, or 30 percent of its current GDP---[U.S. strategic interests in
the Arctic are **minimal** (less than a third of one percent of U.S. GDP
comes from the Arctic).]{.mark}]{.underline} While Russia has a sizeable
nuclear footprint along the Kola Peninsula and ascribes immense
importance to maintaining its sea-based nuclear deterrent in the Arctic,
the United States stations none of its nuclear weapons in the region and
does not patrol it with any of its nuclear-armed submarines (SSBNs).
Thus, as a CSIS Europe Program report states, it is "understandable"
that Russia has enhanced its Arctic capabilities to account for
increased activity along its northern coastline.

Moreover, Russia's buildup should not be overstated: the majority of its
existing icebreakers will be decommissioned over the next several years,
deep-sea port construction has encountered problems and delays, economic
infrastructure remains extremely sparse, and the Arctic is still
significantly less militarized than other regions where the United
States and NATO compete with Russia. Put in context with Russia's wider
military modernization efforts, its allocation of resources to the
Arctic are no more concerning than its behavior elsewhere, as the
majority of its new naval assets are going to other theaters.

[Indeed, interaction in the Arctic between the United States and Russia
is highly cooperative, even as NATO-Russian relations have
worsened]{.underline} elsewhere on a range of issues in the aftermath of
the Ukraine crisis---such as U.S.-Russia withdrawal from the INF Treaty,
sanctions imposition, and removal of Russia from the G8. Moscow has
remained an active participant in the Arctic Council, the Arctic Coast
Guard Forum (ACGF), and numerous environmental and scientific treaties.

AH: Russia's recent Arctic development efforts have crossed into
potentially dangerous areas of naval competition. Total sovereignty over
a sizeable area of the ocean provides the Russian Navy an ideal
opportunity for weapon and tactical development safe from interference
and virtually unmonitored by potential Western adversaries. While many
Soviet-era submarines and icebreakers are scheduled to be decommissioned
by the end of 2019, the Russian Navy plans to replace them with new
warships delivered in 2020. As Russian military forces edge closer to
Norwegian territory -- the only other country with a claim to the
Barents Sea -- Putin's intentions in the Arctic appear increasingly
hostile.

The 2010 "agreed demarcation line" between Russia and Norway no longer
provides the same level of assurance for the West that it once did. In
October 2019, the Barents Observer noted the launch and start of
underwater weapons testing in the Norwegian Sea, just a day after a
peaceful meeting between Russian and Norwegian military leaders. Two
Russian Sierra-class nuclear-powered submarines sailed into the
Norwegian Sea to begin deep-diving exercises and underwater weapons
training and testing. According to Norwegian military officials,"\[The
Russians\] are rebuilding the Northern Fleet, building new submarines;
they're flying more; they are exercising more in the northwest of Russia
with their battalions..." Russian weapons training within Scandinavian
territory , where significant NATO anti-submarine operations were
conducted during the Cold War, is ongoing and hostile. In response to
the latest Russian exercise in these waters in November 2019, Norwegian
intelligence concluded that "\[t\]he aim of the massive operation is to
get as far out to the North Atlantic as possible without being
discovered by NATO." Although Russia appears cooperative within larger
Arctic institutions such as the Arctic Council or ACGF, the Russian
Navy's actions in the area speak significantly louder than adherence to
diplomatic agreements.

What role should NATO play in the Arctic? How should the U.S. respond to
the Arctic challenge?

MS: Though Russian submarine exercises and weapons tests are concerning,
especially in Norway's backyard, cooperation has been the predominant
pattern of U.S.-Russian interaction in the Arctic since the end of the
Cold War. [It is important not to overstate Russian aggression in the
Arctic; Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg has said the Arctic does
not pose core security concerns today, and [other Norwegian analysts
have suggested they "**do not consider a conflict
likely."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The same cannot be said for Europe or the Indo-Pacific, where U.S.
interests are considerably more robust. Practically, the shift in U.S.
and NATO strategic goals that would be required to match Russian
capabilities and credibly compete with Moscow in the Arctic is not
feasible. While Russia has twenty-two fully operational military
icebreakers, the United States only has two. There is also no consensus
within NATO if the Arctic is an area of military concern; [[Canada, an
"Arctic Five" littoral state, has said repeatedly that it does not
believe NATO should play any role in Arctic
matters.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Given limited resources, [[the United States]{.mark} and NATO
[should]{.mark} be focusing on regions of existing contention with
Russia, [not simply shifting military capabilities to a region out of
some ill-defined need to "match" Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Aggressively rebalancing Russia in the Arctic is also not
desirable.]{.mark} There are many feasible scenarios where military
confrontation could break out]{.underline}---[over resource competition,
territorial disputes, and unsanctioned passage through the Northern Sea
Route, to name a few. [But the most plausible scenario that could drive
military conflict and greater frequency of Russian military exercises is
a larger NATO military presence.]{.mark} Given Moscow's sensitivity to
strategic encirclement, a concern that has extended into the Arctic,
increasing NATO operations are likely to contribute to the security
dilemma and increase the likelihood of misperception and miscalculation,
undermining strategic stability in a rapidly changing region where there
is currently no mechanism for dialogue on security issues.]{.underline}

[The United States and its allies must find a way to preserve their
influence in an increasingly important region without making military
conflict more likely.]{.underline} For one, improving intelligence,
reconnaissance, surveillance (ISR) and communications infrastructure is
a pivotal, though less antagonistic, way to improve Arctic operational
readiness. The United States and its allies could utilize unmanned
aerial systems, high altitude balloons, and satellites in highly
elliptical orbits (HEO), which spend extended periods over the Arctic,
to close the positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) gap and monitor
Russian assets in the region. [Perhaps more importantly, since there is
currently no Arctic security forum that includes Russia, Arctic states
should use NATO's established dialogue channels with Moscow through the
NATO-Russia Council,]{.underline} as Dr. Rebecca Pincus has advocated.
[[While NATO's military function would be **counterproductive**, its
political-organizational function could help to lower the likelihood of
miscommunication.]{.mark} This forum would also open the possibility for
greater collaboration on rules to govern the region as it becomes more
accessible to other actors.]{.underline}

[Ultimately, at a time of extreme regional flux, it would be a bad idea
to aggressively rebalance to the Arctic.]{.underline}

AH: Due to Russia's increasingly aggressive mining of Arctic natural
resources and rapid military development, NATO stands a significant
chance of being overwhelmed in the Arctic by Russia economically and
militarily in the next decade. In addition, the development of the
Russian transnational pipeline Nord Stream 2 and Russia's current
relationship with China pose an environmental hazard which threatens
current Arctic Council environmental agreements.

In a May 2019 report, the CSIS Europe Program argued that "The greatest
failing of U.S. policy has been its reluctance to understand the
strategic implications of great power competition in the Arctic." While
the competition here does not necessarily determine total Arctic
superiority, it is crucial to maintain strategic preparedness against
hostile neighbors as well as ensure Russian acts in the Arctic are kept
within both physical and diplomatic confines.

If the United States is to uphold its reputation as a responsible NATO
ally, ignoring this increasingly dire situation is not the answer. While
Norway is one of the strongest of its regional allies, further
assistance in their region is needed to counter the superiority of the
Russian Northern Fleet and its weapons development. Stricter ocean
border controls on the edges of Russia's Arctic territory are vital for
Norwegian national security and to prevent Russian naval forces from
moving closer to the West. Increased deployment of NATO ground troops
and continued military emergency drills in the Arctic would provide
Norway the means to enforce these controls as well as sending a warning
to the Russian forces that continue to close in on Norway's border.

Proactive steps by NATO are necessary to ensure future international
stability in the Arctic. If NATO maintains its passivity towards Russian
military advancement and aggression in the Arctic and continues to
ignore Norwegian authorities' concerns over Russia hostility and
military action, this could be a bad idea with more significant
repercussions in future decades.

With expected and already planned new economic development along the
Arctic coast and in the Arctic Seas of Russia, shipping activity along
the NEP/NSR is likely to grow in the near future (Government of the
Russian Federation 2019). To minimize or mitigate possible adverse
impacts of shipping along the NEP/NSR, [[it is **important** to
consider]{.underline}]{.mark} vessel traffic patterns in the different
parts of the route in light of [the specific [environmental
characteristics]{.mark}]{.underline} of each part of the route. Shipping
activities are unevenly distributed throughout the Russian maritime
Arctic and [therefore [their impact on the environment varies]{.mark}
sea by sea]{.underline}. [[Each economic activity results in a specific
impact on biologically significant areas]{.underline}]{.mark} and is
associated with specific risks. The [[impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} of
vessel traffic on marine ecosystems along the NEP
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} limited mostly to [[physical disturbance,

activities]{.mark}]{.underline}, the spread of invasive aquatic species,
[[and the risk of a fuel]{.underline}]{.mark} or cargo
[[spill]{.underline}.]{.mark} However, one of the noticeable
environmental problems, marine litter from fisheries, has started to
receive more attention, as both fishing activities and litter moves
northward (Höjman et al., 2022, Olsen et al., 2020b) negatively
affecting marine life and coastal populations.

https://www.eurasiareview.com/27072024-russia-facing-loss-of-icebreaker-dominance-in-arctic-analysis/
//maeve

[[Moscow has long counted on its large fleet of
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}---containing 41 ships, seven of which
are nuclear---[[to ensure its control]{.mark} not only of the Northern
Sea Route but also of access to the natural resources [in and under the
Arctic Sea]{.mark}]{.underline} (Russian Transportation Ministry,
February 20).

[[The Kremlin apparently sees this as a reasonable
assumption]{.underline}]{.mark} given the role of such ships in that
ice-bound ocean and the much smaller icebreaker fleets other countries
have fielded, as no other country has more than a handful of icebreakers
(Rosbalt, July 15). However, three developments now call this dominance
into question:

Global warming has left more, but far from all, of the Arctic ice-free.
This has allowed more ships to transit without icebreaker support and
even creates the possibility of opening alternative routes and reducing
the importance of Russia's current advantage (see EDM, October 3,
2017; The Barents Observer, July 12).

Outside powers have become increasingly active in the Arctic. China,
which now defines itself as "a near Arctic" country, has been rapidly
expanding its icebreaker fleet. Earlier this month, the United States,
Canada, and Finland committed themselves to building as many as 90
icebreakers by 2030 (The White House; CTV News; Reuters, July 11; The
Barent Observer, July 12).

Problems in Russia's shipyards and its inability to make use of those in
other countries due to sanctions means that Moscow has little hope of
countering these challenges and thus will likely lose its advantages in
the north (Window on Eurasia, November 18, 2022, April 4).

As a result, despite continuing Russian claims that Western and even
Chinese efforts to catch and surpass Moscow's icebreaker fleet in the
Arctic will not succeed, the Kremlin can clearly see the writing on the
wall (Portnews.ru, March 8). **[[Moscow may very well decide to take
action in the Arctic before it loses its current advantages over both
China and the Wes]{.mark}t]{.underline}**---a decision that would make
an expanded conflict there more likely in the short term (see EDM, March
30).

[[Russia]{.mark} has the longest Arctic coastline of any country in the
world and [has viewed the Arctic both as an east-west transit
route]{.mark} via the Northern Sea Route [and as a source of natural
resources**. Moscow also sees the region as its own territory from which
others should be excluded**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--AT: Security Dilemma Fake

#### Lack of concrete motives makes the security dilemma inevitable.

[[Schweller\']{.mark}s critique of the security dilemma misses the
mark]{.underline} in three respects. First, [he [fails to
appreciate]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the]{.mark} **[role that uncertainty
plays]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} both Waltz\'s
[[b]{.mark}alance-[of-p]{.mark}ower [theory]{.mark}]{.underline} and
defensive neorealism. Glaser notes that neorealism assumes [that
**[states are black boxes]{.mark}** [\"that provide no information about
internal differences]{.mark},]{.underline} [[except]{.mark}
for]{.underline} the observable [[outputs of their international policy
choices]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"61 States do not rely on the internal
characteristics of other states for

-for example, their political or economic systems---to discern their
motives. Instead, [[they must **draw inferences**]{.mark} [from]{.mark}
[observable international behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
when a state faces a security dilemma, many policies that would improve
the state\'s security also send ambiguous information about motives.

Second[, [states face]{.mark} real [uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline} not
only [about one another\'s present motives but also [about]{.mark} their
future motives]{.underline} and relative capabilities. [[States]{.mark}
can never be certain of]{.underline} one another\'s **[[future
intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[regardless of]{.underline}]{.mark}
whether they harbor \"greedy\" or [\"[security-seeking\" motives in the
present]{.mark}]{.underline}. Uncertainty about the future and
anticipated shifts in the relative distribution of power create
incentives and dişincentives for cooperative or competitive policies in
the present. [Windows of opportunity tempt declining states to
contemplate war before the power shift is complete.]{.underline} For
example, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the loss of its nuclear
monopoly and the development of thermonuclear weapons created a window
of opportunity for the United States. Preventive war arguments were
common within the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Truman administration.
Few scholars, however, would classify the United States as harboring
greedy motives.

Third, [Schweller ignores the [incidence of security-driven expansion
**in world history**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[historical
record]{.mark} [abounds with cases of]{.mark}]{.underline} states that
pursued [**[security-driven expansion]{.mark}**]{.underline} or
preventive war. This is not to say that defensive realists deny the
existence of predatory states; in fact, they do not. Few defensive
realists would classify the expansionist behavior of Napoleonic France
and Nazi Germany as security driven.
