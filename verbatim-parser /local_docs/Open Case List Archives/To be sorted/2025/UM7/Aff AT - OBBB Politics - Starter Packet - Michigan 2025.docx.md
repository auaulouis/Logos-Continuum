### Won't Pass\-\--House-Senate Disagreement\-\--2AC

#### The Senate version [can't pass]{.underline} the House

**Schnell 6-18**-2025 (Mychael, "Senate's 'big, beautiful bill' faces
House headwinds: 'This is political stupidity'," *The Hill*,
https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5355954-gop-bill-opposition-house-medicaid-salt/)//BB

[[The Senate]{.mark} GOP's [version of]{.mark} the "**[b]{.mark}**ig,
**[b]{.mark}**eautiful **[b]{.mark}**ill" [is facing major headwinds in
the House]{.mark} as a growing number of lawmakers stake opposition to
the legislation]{.underline}, **[[a troubling sign
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** Republican leaders as they try to fast-track
[the package full of]{.underline} President [[Trump's]{.mark}
legislative [priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The Senate]{.underline}]{.mark} Finance Committee on Monday released
the final piece of text for the upper chamber's
[[edition]{.underline}]{.mark} of the legislation. It [[changed key
parts]{.mark} of the House's blueprint, [including beefing up Medicaid
cuts, softening]{.mark} the [rollback of green energy]{.mark} tax
[credits]{.mark} and [decreasing]{.mark} th]{.underline}e state and
local tax ([[SALT]{.underline}]{.mark}) deduction
[[cap]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [a troika of [tweaks prompting
significant pushback across the House GOP
conference]{.mark}.]{.underline}

["My main takeaway for you guys is [this bill, as the Senate has
produced it, is]{.mark} definitely [**dead** if it were to come over to
the]{.mark} [House]{.mark} in anything resembling its current
form]{.underline}," Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), a vocal member of the
conservative House Freedom Caucus, told reporters on a press call.

He said GOP leadership's self-imposed Independence Day deadline is "a
real question at this point."

"**[[The bill won't move through the House]{.underline}]{.mark}** as it
is," the Texas Republican added. "You have a significant problem with
respect to deficits. You have a significant problem with respect to the
Inflation Reduction Act. You still have a problem, in my opinion, on
Medicaid, even though it maybe made a slight move in the right
direction. And then there's a myriad other factors."

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.), who switched from a Democrat to a
Republican in 2020, also tore into the Senate's bill, taking issue with
a provision that would decrease the amount of Medicaid funding states
receive.

"**[[This is political stupidity]{.underline}]{.mark}**; it's political
suicide. Why would you hurt these people?" Van Drew told The Hill.
"There are a lot of working poor, blue-collar people. There are people
now --- they were part of this new Republican Party, and we should make
sure that they're safe not only for political reasons but also for the
right thing to do."

"[**[I'm not voting for that]{.underline}**.]{.mark} That's gotta be
straightened out," he added of the Senate's bill. "I would be a no. I
can't see myself voting for that."

[[The early opposition is a harrowing state of play
for]{.underline}]{.mark} Speaker Mike **[[Johnson]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(R-La.), [who can only afford to lose three votes and muscle the
legislation through his razor-thin majority]{.underline}, assuming full
attendance and unanimous Democratic opposition. The Speaker had not
commented on the Senate's text as of Tuesday evening.

[[The Senate]{.mark}, to be sure, [can still tweak its bill]{.mark} to
win over support, [but that would require significant changes that
leaders are signaling they **have no appetite
for**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On Medicaid, for example, some centrist House Republicans are griping
about the upper chamber's decision to cap provider taxes at 3.5 percent
by 2031 --- a decrease from the current 6 percent --- for states that
expanded the social safety net program under the Affordable Care Act.
The decrease would begin in 2027 and be phased out by 0.5 percent
annually.

Van Drew said he wants the provider tax to remain at 6 percent. He
pointed to the House bill, which froze the provider tax at current rates
while also implementing work requirements for nondisabled individuals.

"This will hurt people. That's how simple the formula is," Van Drew said
of the Senate's proposal. "You don't want to hurt people that shouldn't
be hurt. This will hurt people that shouldn't be hurt, because the
hospitals are going to have to make cuts."

Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), however, backed the
provision Tuesday --- even as some moderates in his own ranks express
concerns --- describing the reform as a way to "rebalance the program in
a way that provides the right incentives to cover the people who are
supposed to be covered by Medicaid."

"But we continue to hear from our members specifically on components or
pieces of the bill that they would like to see modified or changed or
have concerns about, and we're working through that," he added. "But at
the end, I mean, the goal is --- as you all know --- is to get 51 here
in the United States Senate and 218 in the House, and so ultimately
that's the math that I'm working with, that we're all working with. We
want to get a bill out of the Senate, through the House and on the
president's desk."

[The Senate bill's rollback of green energy tax credits, meanwhile, has
emerged as a pain point on the right flank. The upper chamber's
legislation still takes a sledgehammer to]{.underline} many of the
provisions enacted in [the]{.underline} Democrats' inflation Reduction
Act ([IRA]{.underline}), [but it appears to offer more
flexibility]{.underline}.

The legislation, for example, appears to eliminate a provision that
would have required climate-friendly energy sources to begin
construction within 60 days of the bill's enactment to qualify for the
credits, which was considered one of the most stringent energy
conditions in the bill. Instead, the Senate's measure requires projects,
including solar panels and wind farms, to start construction by the end
of this year to receive the full credit.

Roy --- who warned for weeks that he would not support the legislation
if it watered down the elimination of green energy tax credits approved
by Democrats in 2022 --- slammed the changes.

"We have major backsliding on the Inflation Reduction Act 'green new
scam' subsidies," he told reporters on a press call. "We're trying to
just get even half at this point of the reductions the IRA locked in
place, and now the Senate is pushing back on that. That's a real
problem."

That position aligns with the statement members of the Freedom Caucus
board released earlier this month, after the House approved the
megabill, warning they would "not accept" an attempt by the upper
chamber to "water down, strip out, or walk back the hard-fought spending
reductions and IRA Green New Scam rollbacks achieved in this
legislation."

Rounding out the House's three main areas of concern is the Senate's
\$10,000 SALT deduction cap, which is causing considerable consternation
among moderate House Republicans from high-tax blue states.

Those lawmakers --- mainly members hailing from New York, New Jersey and
California --- engaged in painstaking negotiations with Johnson for
months to land on a \$40,000 deduction cap for individuals making
\$500,000 or less.

Thune, for his part, told reporters Monday that the \$10,000 cap is a
"marker" for negotiations with House Republicans, adding that the two
camps will "figure out a landing spot."

But [House Republicans in the SALT Caucus are warning they will not
accept any cap below the \$40,000 level, threatening to tank the entire
package]{.underline}.

If SALT is not addressed by the end of the year, members have noted, the
deduction cap would return to unlimited --- where it was before the 2017
Trump tax cuts bill put the \$10,000 cap in place --- a reality they
would be thrilled with.

[rushing [the process could]{.mark} [result in a legislative
collapse]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Won't pass now

**Zehra 6-17**-2025, author at Alternet (Ailia, "\'Potentially really
bad\': GOP senators and lobbyists say Trump\'s big bill \'cannot
pass\'," Alternet,
https://www.alternet.org/gop-senators-trump-bill-2672388342/)//BB

[[The full legislative text]{.mark}, released Monday]{.underline},
covers tax policy, health care, and other major issues --- but instead
of building consensus, it has [**[exposed deep rifts within the
party.]{.underline}** [Fiscal conservatives argue the bill doesn't
sufficiently reduce the def]{.underline}]{.mark}[icit.]{.underline}
Others, like Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) are wary of its Medicaid changes,
telling the Wall Street Journal that the impact on rural hospitals would
be \"potentially really bad.\" Others object to revisions in
clean-energy incentives and Trump's proposed tax cuts, per the report.

Sen. Rand [[Paul]{.underline}]{.mark} (R-Ky.), a vocal critic of the
legislation, [[is already expected to vote no]{.underline}]{.mark}. GOP
leaders are aiming for a first vote by next Wednesday or Thursday,
potentially setting up final passage over the weekend. But many in the
party now view that timeline as implausible, the report said.

Further delays are likely as Senate committees await cost estimates and
rulings from the parliamentarian, who could strip out key provisions in
the final stages.

According to Politico, **[[doubt has also spread beyond the
Capitol]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Lobbyists are still reviewing the
549-page proposal released by the Senate Finance Committee, while key
players on K Street keep a close eye on signs of internal GOP
dissent]{.underline}.

"[[The general sense downtown that is causing concern is that the bill
in its current form **cannot pass either body**]{.underline}]{.mark},"
an unnamed lobbyist at a major firm confided to Politico. "So the bill
is still, by necessity, open and will be changed."

#### Medicaid cuts derail passage

**Hill 6-16**-2025 (Meredith Lee, et al, "Senate GOP tax bill would hit
politically explosive Medicaid provision," *Politico*,
https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/06/16/congress/senate-gop-tax-bill-would-hit-politically-explosive-medicaid-provision-00408630)

[[Senate Republicans are seeking to ratchet up savings from a
politically explosive policy within Medicaid]{.mark} to pay for their
megabill, and [it's]{.mark} already [setting off **shockwaves** through
Capitol Hill]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Senate Finance Committee's newly released draft would incrementally
lower the allowable provider tax in Medicaid expansion states starting
in 2027 from the current 6 percent until it hits 3.5 percent in 2031.
The dial-down would not apply to nursing or intermediate care
facilities.

[[That would be a huge departure from the House-passed bill]{.mark},
which would put a moratorium on states' ability to raise their provider
tax beyond the current 6 percent. [It's]{.mark} also [likely to spark
fierce pushback from a coalition of GOP senators who were already
worried that the freeze would negatively impact rural hospitals in their
states]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Republicans are expecting the Medicaid language will be further
negotiated.

"Hell no," said one moderate House Republican who was granted anonymity
to react candidly to the Senate proposal. That lawmaker is part of a
group warning that deeper changes to the provider tax would be viewed as
cuts to the program and are a red line for them.

Still, [[Senate Republicans are scrambling to notch deeper spending
cuts]{.mark} in the filibuster-skirting legislation, [and the provider
tax is one of the few areas lawmakers can increase savings while not
touching Medicare]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- [another entitlement program
GOP lawmakers were briefly flirting with overhauling to find
offsets]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Paul]{.mark} has made clear that his [red line]{.mark} for any bill
[is a debt ceiling increase]{.mark}. [But Republicans]{.mark} on both
sides of the Capitol [are]{.mark}]{.underline} seemingly
[[intent]{.mark} on following through]{.underline} on Trump's wishes
[[to include it]{.underline}]{.mark} and help the party avoid giving
Democratic concessions in any possible negotiation. This means that
without any changes, [[Paul will be a "no,"]{.underline}]{.mark} and
Senate GOP leaders have less breathing room than they had hoped, capping
their votes at 52 in the process.

unsuccessful amendment earlier in the process that would have spared
Medicaid. Hawley has also said he is worried about how the bill cuts
state provider taxes, which he said are important to his state\'s
Medicaid financing. [Sen. Jerry [Moran]{.mark}]{.underline} (R-Kan.) has
[[also mentioned Medicaid]{.mark} cuts as a concern. [The four]{.mark}

#### Non-unique. The OBBB already includes Arctic policy.

**Brooks 6-19**-2025 (James, "Federal land sales, more logging and more
oil revenue: What's in the big federal bill for Alaska?,"
https://alaskabeacon.com/2025/06/19/federal-land-sales-more-logging-and-more-oil-revenue-whats-in-the-big-federal-bill-for-alaska/)//BB

Members of the U.S. Senate last week proposed a major sale of federal
land as part of **[[the "Big, Beautiful Bill]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
proposed by Republicans to fund the U.S. government.

If adopted, the proposed sale [[could be **significant** for
Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}, where the federal government owns and
manages 61% of all land in the state.

Under language proposed by the U.S. Senate's Committee on Energy and
Natural Resources, [the **[B]{.mark}**ureau of **[L]{.mark}**and
**[M]{.mark}**anagement]{.underline} and the U.S. Forest Service
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} be required to [[sell]{.underline}]{.mark}
between 2.2 million and 3.3 million acres of [[public land
across]{.underline}]{.mark} 11 Western states, including
**[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

National parks and monuments would be off limits to sale, but wide
swaths of Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management land would still
be available.

The proposed language states that the sold land "shall be used solely
for the development of housing or to address associated community
needs," and that the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of
Agriculture can determine whether the sold land is being used for an
appropriate purpose.

The land-sale provision is being boosted by lawmakers who say it could
alleviate high housing prices in Western states. Since 1998, for
example, the BLM in Nevada has operated a successful land-sale program
that has created thousands of homes in and around the Las Vegas area.

Staff for Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the new land-sale language
would allow a similar effort nationwide.

But environmental groups, including the Wilderness Society, are opposing
the sale provisions.

For the moment, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee proposal is
only a draft, but it's one of a number of ideas with potentially major
impacts in Alaska.

While the Senate's proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamps have been
widely discussed, the energy and lands components of the bill may be
just as significant.

"If we get everything that we're trying to get in it ... I think [this
will probably be one of the most important pieces of legislation for
Alaska in our state's history]{.underline}," said U.S. Sen. Dan
Sullivan, R-Alaska, in a prerecorded Wednesday address to the Resource
Development Council in Anchorage.

It would affect policies related to oil development in the Alaska
National Wildlife Refuge and the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska,
as well as other resource development, he said.

"**[[ANWR, NPR-A, timber, Cook Inlet, you name it, it's in
there]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said.

Murkowski, also speaking in a recorded message, said that within
Congress, she, Sullivan and Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, are all
working on the budget reconciliation process.

"We're going to refill TAPS," she said, referring to the trans-Alaska
oil pipeline, "we're going to produce more of our minerals. We're
fighting for a sustainable timber industry, and we're going to keep
harvesting the best seafood and welcoming millions of visitors every
year as we come together to secure our resource future."

Oil and gas drilling

If the Energy and Natural Resources Committee's text is adopted, [the
federal government would be required to hold four oil and gas lease
sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]{.underline}, east of
Prudhoe Bay, between 2025 and 2035.

### PC Low\-\--2AC

**Stirewalt 25**, American political analyst who is the politics editor
for NewsNation and is a contributing editor for The Dispatch. (Chris,
05/02, "Whole Hog Politics: How Trump misspent his political capital",
The Hill,
https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5277762-trump-political-capital/)

**[[Trump]{.mark} World [tells us]{.mark} often that "[this time is
different]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}" and on these matters, they
are surely right.

The [[first 100 days]{.mark} of this Trump administration has
[had]{.mark} very [little to do with Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Except for getting through a wild and wooly bunch of appointees, [[there
has]{.underline}]{.mark} so far [[been]{.underline}]{.mark} basically
**[[no Trump agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}** for Congress. Having learned
his lesson from eight years ago, [Trump sidestepped a fight on
spending,]{.underline} kicking the can on a six-month funding deal.
Eight years ago, Trump's grip on his party was weakened; he obviously
feared being branded a deficit spender. This time, the Freedom Caucus is
utterly defanged.

That's evidence of how much political capital Trump had at the outset
with his party. If you can get people who vowed never to support a
continuing resolution to get comfortable with red ink, you've got your
people where you want them.

But the **[Trump [reboot]{.mark} [is not a show about
Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} all about
[[the title character]{.underline}]{.mark}. So the first 100 days were
dominated by the satisfying squeak of Sharpie on paper as Trump fired
off executive action after executive action. Particularly on trade, but
also on an increasingly bellicose stance with the courts,
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[embraced]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[idea of "[I alone can fix it]{.mark}"]{.underline} [[to
the]{.underline}]{.mark} almost com[plete [exclusion of
Congress]{.mark}.]{.underline} He believed this was the right course of
action since it is his default mode, but also because all of the
patootie smoochers in his cabinet and in Congress kept telling him how
massive, historic and amazing his 2024 win was. If Trump in 2017 was the
dog who caught the car, in 2025 he is Toonces.

[[Trump believed]{.mark} the hype]{.underline} and [rather
than]{.underline} taking advantage of his [modestly [better approval
rating]{.mark}]{.underline} at the start of his second term,
**[[proceeded to quickly exhaust it crashing into
things]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He concluded his first 100 days worse off
than any of his predecessors, including himself. That's not a huge
political problem in the sense that 100 days is an arbitrary and brief
measurement. He has 1,359 days to get back on the good foot, and success
would quickly rally the market for political capital.

Where the real trouble comes in for [Trump]{.underline} is that he
[[didn't make better use of]{.underline}]{.mark} his moment with
**[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 

[[The honeymoon]{.underline}]{.mark}, little as it was, [[is wrapping
up]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[The [Senate is getting prickly]{.mark} on
tariffs]{.underline}**. [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has just
**[[jettisoned]{.mark} one of the [Senate GOP's favorites]{.mark}
among]{.underline}** his senior aides. Elon **[[Musk]{.mark} has [lost
his charge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark}
overall [[approval]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[declined]{.mark} nearly [7
points]{.mark}]{.underline} in just the past month, leaving him nearly
13 points underwater. 

And now comes the hard part.

For four months, [congressional [Republicans]{.mark} have [been
delaying]{.mark} the major [fights]{.mark}]{.underline} on the parts
[of]{.underline} [Trump's [agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} will [[demand their assent]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Trump's 2017 [[tax cuts are expiring]{.underline}]{.mark} this year, and
without action, Americans will be hit with a massive tax increase in the
midst of an already contracting economy. But the [[reconciliation
package]{.mark} currently [stalled]{.mark}]{.underline} in
**[[Congress]{.mark} [is]{.mark} a lot [more]{.mark} [than]{.mark} just
[maintaining the status quo]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} It's the
vehicle for border spending, a military buildup, and Trump hopes, new
tax cuts aimed at his blue-collar and elderly supporters.

[Problem is]{.underline}, [Congress]{.underline} has [only
succeeded]{.underline} in agreeing [to eventually hash it all
out,]{.underline} [but]{.underline} has [done]{.underline} [next to none
of the actual hashing]{.underline}. Dozens of ideas are swirling around
Capitol Hill, ranging from a car tax to a tax hike for the wealthy.
Lawmakers from vulnerable blue-state districts want an increase to the
state and local tax deduction. Lawmakers from poor states are freaking
out about potential cuts to Medicaid. It's a real mess.

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who has impressed friends and foes alike
with his ability to plow through these problems so far, says he wants it
all done in the next three weeks, with the beginning of July as the
possible fallback. Let's say Johnson succeeds --- no sure thing --- what
happens next?

The House-[[passed bill heads over]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
[Senate]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline} starts
[[rot]{.underline}]{.mark}ting [like a jack-o'-lantern left out too
long]{.underline} on the porch. As we saw in the can-kicking part of
this exercise, the House and the Senate are miles apart on these
questions. Whatever the House does, if it really can deliver, will not
be passed by acclamation in the Senate. Instead, the House provisions
slapped together to please narrow constituencies in the lower chamber
will start to molder under Senate scrutiny.

And if they do move slowly, at some point along the way, Congress will
probably have to vote to raise the federal borrowing limit, an issue
sure to deepen enmity between members and between chambers.  

That's all a long way of saying that while [it doesn't seem
possible]{.underline} that congressional [Republicans]{.underline}
[would fail so completely that they wouldn't be able to extend current
rates]{.underline}, **[it is very much an open]{.underline}**
**[question]{.underline}** that **[they will be able to do much more
than that]{.underline}**. And if all Trump has to show for his
much-ballyhooed mandate is keeping things the same, voters are not going
to be feeling very golden about the golden age. 

As [[Trump]{.underline} [tries to unwind]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[knot]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} his big, **[[unpopular
moves]{.underline}]{.mark}** on trade and deals with a series of
setbacks in the courts, [[it's]{.underline}]{.mark} becoming
increasingly [[clear]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[**he didn't put his
political** capital]{.mark} [where]{.mark} [it could grow]{.mark} the
most: **Congress**.]{.underline}

[Trump\'s **[approval ratings]{.mark}** in surveys conducted [by]{.mark}
nearly **[every]{.mark}** major [pollster are]{.mark} **now
[negative]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[The president\'s approval rating on the economy has also taken a hit
amid mounting fears of a trade war as Trump levies steep tariffs against
Canada]{.underline}, Mexico and China during his second term.

Those fears spiked this week, after Trump announced plans to implement a
25 percent tariff on imported vehicles beginning on April 2.

In a new Gallup poll out on Thursday, 41 percent of Americans approve of
how the president is handling the economy versus 59 percent who
disapprove.

The survey was conducted from March 3 to March 16 among 1,002 adults
living in the U.S. It has a four percent margin of error.

A February Gallup poll shows Trump\'s approval on the economy was 42
percent versus a 54 percent disapproval rating.

In Gallup polls conducted during Trump\'s first term, his economic
approval rating never dipped lower than 45 percent, according to
Gallup\'s data.

Thursday\'s poll comes on the heels of a CNN poll earlier this month, in
which 56 percent of Americans disapproved of Trump\'s handling of the
economy, while 44 percent approved.

The CNN poll was conducted from March 6 to March 9 among 1,206 U.S.
adults. Its margin of error was 3.3 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll released on Wednesday, 43 percent of U.S.
adults approve of Trump\'s handling of the economy and jobs, compared to
47 percent who disapprove.

In a Gallup tracker on economic confidence among Americans, February
shows a -19 index, the same as January. December\'s index was -14 and
November\'s was -17.

What People Are Saying

Kevin Wagner, a political science professor at Florida Atlantic
University, told Newsweek via text message on Thursday: \"We would have
to see a consistent pattern over the course of several polls to consider
it a trend. While a low poll number on the economy is never a good sign,
the longer term public mood will depend in part on how people assess how
the president is addressing their concerns.\"

Democratic pollster Matt McDermott wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on
Thursday: \"Gallup finds Trump with a 43% approval rating and an even
worse rating (41%) for his handling of the economy. Voters are starting
to turn on Trump --- fast.\"

Anyway, [the]{.underline} **[other side]{.underline}** [of this
narrative is that]{.underline} **[Trump]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
a **[term-locked]{.underline}** president (at least if you're going by
the Constitution), [and]{.underline} **[history]{.underline}**
[indicates]{.underline} that [his party will]{.underline} almost
**[certainly lose]{.underline}** the House [in the]{.underline}

[about]{.underline} **[18 months to spend]{.underline}** his

**p**]{.mark}olitical **[c]{.mark}**apital---and [Trump's]{.mark}
**unique** relationship to it---than his former White House political
director Bill Stepien]{.underline}.

During Trump's first term, Stepien fed the president polling information
on his legislative agenda and, especially, on midterm races---even if
Trump often followed his own gut instincts. Stepien recently came on my
podcast, Somebody's Gotta Win, to talk about Trump's unusual
relationship with political capital, how that will dictate the
legislative fights ahead, and which cabinet appointments he thinks Trump
will actually fight for. Plus, in light of his lawsuit against Iowa's
Ann Selzer, we also discussed his relationship with pollsters. This
excerpt has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Peak Trump

Tara Palmeri: What does a political director do inside the White House?

Bill Stepien: In most White Houses, there's a focus on helping guide the
legislative agenda based on polling data and public sentiment. In a
Trump White House, it's quite different, as you might imagine. There's a
constant focus on races, candidates, and elections. My first two years
with the president as political director were spent just feeding
information to him---not putting a finger on the scale of, "Sir, you
should do this." People call him and talk about how great they are, or
talk about how great their guy or gal is, without providing a full
story. My job, as I saw it, was to provide a full political story of a
race and give a full picture, so we could have our eyes wide open on
whatever political decisions he sought to make.

[Many things are different eight years later]{.underline}. Most
[notably, his]{.underline} **[political strength]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[much more sizable]{.underline}**. Now, [you have
people]{.underline} **[beating down the door]{.underline}** [because
he's at the]{.underline} **[height of his power]{.underline}**. At any
point, we would have died to have the poll numbers and strength that he
has right now.

Trump's down-ballot endorsements have had a spotty record---and he's
done some unusual ones. For instance, in the '22 Missouri Senate
primary, he offered a kind of double endorsement to both Eric Schmitt
and the scandal-plagued former governor Eric Greitens, and he's done
this more than once. Usually, an endorsement is a golden ticket, but
Trump doesn't look at political capital that way.

I think people oftentimes have a misguided view of the kind of person he
actually is. At the end of the day, he's a people pleaser. He wants to
make people happy. He wants to help people. He wants people to like him,
and he wants to like people. The double-endorsement thing isn't
something I'd seen before, but it's in line with him wanting to please
and to help. That's an example of him doing things his own way, for
sure.

I think [there are]{.underline} **[different ways]{.underline}** [to
view]{.underline} **[p]{.underline}**olitical **[c]{.underline}**apital.
[**[Some]{.mark}**one I used to work with would often [say]{.mark} that
[you]{.mark} can]{.underline} [[**obtain**
**p**]{.underline}]{.mark}olitical **[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**apital
[[and **keep it**]{.mark} in your]{.underline} **[desk
drawer]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[save]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[use]{.underline}** for a **[later]{.underline}**
date---**[or]{.underline}** [you can]{.underline} **[use
it]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} actually **[expend it]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} **[something you want]{.underline}** or need.
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [views]{.underline}
**[p]{.underline}**olitical **[c]{.underline}**apital [in
the]{.underline} [**latter category**. He]{.underline} **[[gets
it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He [**[uses it. And unlike anyone]{.mark}
I've seen before**, he [can]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**get more**]{.mark}.
I'm **[no]{.mark}**t sure any[**one** has]{.mark}]{.underline} really
[[seen]{.mark} an **[unending]{.mark} supply of
[p]{.mark}**]{.underline}olitical **[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}**apital
[[like **Trump**]{.mark} ha**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and I always
laughed when I was in the White House and read stories about how he'd be
enraged when one of his endorsees lost a race. He sees these things as
wins and losses. He's very black and white in how he views these races
and his decisions.

And that extends to cabinet nominees, to legislation, to basically
anything he wants. [It feels like]{.underline} [**[everybody
else]{.underline}** [is playing]{.underline}]{.mark} [**political
[chess]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[he's]{.mark} just [like,
Whatever]{.mark}]{.underline}**...

[He believes---[and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**he's right**]{.mark}---that
with a]{.underline} **[tweet]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} a **[press
conference]{.underline}**, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} news
[[media]{.underline} **[soaks it up]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.
I]{.underline}** **[don't think he worries]{.underline}** too much
[about a]{.underline} [**[bad news]{.mark} cycle**, because
[it's]{.mark} **only**]{.underline} a matter of [[**hours**,
not]{.underline}]{.mark} days or **[[weeks]{.underline}]{.mark}** with
this guy. [[He's using]{.mark} his]{.underline} **[levers of
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to]{.underline}
**[negotiate]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, to]{.underline} [**push around**,
to]{.underline} **[get people to sit up]{.underline}** in their chairs.
That's very different from what we're used to from the person sitting in
that office, but this is the guy.

Let's talk about his legislative agenda. Senate leader John Thune and
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson see two different pathways to passing
Trump's agenda. Johnson is arguing for one massive bill that includes
immigration, energy, and Trump's tax code, while Thune is saying they
should push it through two bills. What are the pros and cons of each
approach?

Candidly, I think they should ask [Trump]{.underline} what he wants to
do, because if he's not involved in the process, he's less apt to
engage. And we know he [**wants to be engaged**, because he]{.underline}
**[loves]{.underline}** this process of [**negotiation**, having people
in the Oval Office going back and forth, battling it out]{.underline}.
Besides, we know [Trump's]{.underline} [**[instincts]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[really [good]{.mark}]{.underline}** on
this.

[Eight years ago, his instincts were to do]{.underline} **[tax cuts
first, and all the smart people in Washington said]{.underline}**, Sir,
we need [to go after]{.underline} **[Obamacare]{.underline}** first.
That was the white whale for Republicans in D.C., and it was more their
fight than President Trump's, and they ultimately wasted time on
Obamacare. It didn't go down as intended. It was weakening because of
that swing and miss, and it took time to get back on track. [So they
should ask Trump what he wants to do, because who's going to be a
better]{.underline} **[salesman]{.underline}** of
this[---]{.underline}Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**, Senator
**[Thune]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} Speaker
**[Johnson?]{.underline}**

But does Trump really understand how this works?

If he doesn't, it's their job to help him understand if they want to be
successful. The stakes are so high on this. And I think Johnson, in
particular, has carved out a great relationship with Trump. It's their
job to make sure he is involved and engaged, and if he's not, just ask
Mitch McConnell how that goes.

If you were the political director right now, how would you advise Trump
to play this?

I run from policy when I see policy, but having spent a couple of years
in D.C., and knowing how slow and incompetent the system is, I think
it's really hard to do something once, let alone twice, especially when
they're both really important and they both really matter.

A lot of this comes down to relationships, too. And he doesn't have that
kind of relationship with John Thune, right?

It's certainly a relationship that's developing. I think Thune has done
so many of the right things to further it and speed it along. It's a new
relationship, but it can't be worse than the previous one. Anyone
walking through that door will be a breath of fresh air compared to who
was in place before.

How long do you think it will take to pass this legislation---tax cuts,
immigration, energy, etcetera? This is a massive bill. Where do you
think there are going to be reservations?

I know House Republicans are unhappy about pieces of it that they feel
are inconsistent with what we just ran on and won on, like some of the
giveaways that they think are things that were promised to Democrats.
But that's where the slim majority comes in. Then you have Christmas and
the holidays, and you've got January 20 coming up around the corner
pretty fast. At the same time, Trump's focused on the cabinet and
getting his people in place and assembling a government. So there are a
ton of competing interests when it comes to time. How long one or two
bills takes---your guess is as good as mine. There are a lot of balls in
the air that make things complicated.

They're almost certainly going to lose the House; history tells us that,
especially with a slim majority. So you've got one term in front of you,
and you've got two years before you probably lose control of the House.
That's why he's been so aggressive in trying to get his people in place
in the cabinet, because he understands that, unlike 2017, when he was
walking in the door with potentially eight years in front of him, he's
got 18 months. It's a much different clock. He understands the timeline,
and there's a quickened pace with everything he's doing this time
around.

The "Show of Strength" Theory

What was Trump's relationship with pollsters when you were with him in
the White House?

He liked pollsters when their numbers were good, and he didn't like them
when they were bad. He looked at polls, but he was far from obsessed
with them. He paid attention when you had something to show him, but he
was guided more by his instinct than he was by a pollster's number that
was published somewhere. He used polls to verify his instincts, but they
weren't guiding his agenda or thought process.

[[One of Trump's]{.underline} **[greatest strengths]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[messaging]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. In his first
term, he fired off a flurry of]{.underline} **[executive
orders]{.underline}** [that were]{.underline} pretty much [toothless and
couldn't be upheld]{.underline} in court. How much of this is Trump's
way of sending a message to the American people that he's trying to make
good on his promise, and if it fails, it's not because of him?

From my perspective, [those are less]{.underline} **[[legislative
documents]{.underline}]{.mark}** [than they are guiding]{.underline}
**[principles]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**[show]{.mark}s of
[strength]{.mark}**. They're more, I'm doing on]{.underline} **[Day One
what I promised]{.underline}** to do and what you elected me to do.
[Most]{.underline} Americans [don't know]{.underline} [what]{.underline}
the hell [an]{.underline} **[ex]{.underline}**ecutive
**[o]{.underline}**rder [is]{.underline}, or if something is
subsequently held up in the courts, or overturned. [They see
him]{.underline} sitting [at his desk with a big pen]{.underline} and a
document with his big signature on the piece of paper. And [it's
the]{.underline} **[picture]{.underline}** and messaging
[that]{.underline} **[matters]{.underline}** a whole lot
**[more]{.underline}** [than what happens]{.underline}
**[after]{.underline}**. Candidly, [people are going to pay attention to
what]{.underline} **[pictures they see on Day One]{.underline}**.

Do you think Trump is genuinely eager to expand the power of the
executive branch?

I don't know the answer to your question. I would say the thing he can
do most to have expansive powers is continue to do what he's doing right
now. Right now, he's so much stronger than he was eight years ago, when
Americans gave him even marks and his approval rating was plus-one. Now,
it's approaching plus-20. [[You can do a]{.mark} whole [lot]{.mark} more
[with the bully pulpit when you're]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**strong
politically**. The]{.mark} best [way to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[expand]{.underline}**]{.mark} your **[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}**s
[[is to]{.underline} **[look]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**and be

Last we left Republicans' effort to pass their "one big, beautiful bill"
of tax cuts, spending cuts, and assorted other goodies, House and Senate
Republicans had each passed wildly different versions of the blueprint
necessary to unlock a filibuster-proof reconciliation bill. The next
step was to reconcile their differences in a single blueprint, pass it
through both chambers, then set about writing actual legislation. How
would the two chambers reconcile their differences on the size of the
tax cuts? The spending cuts? The defense-spending increase? The answer,
as we appeared to learn this week, is that they won't. Leaders' plan for
now is to pass a joint blueprint with entirely different instructions
for House and Senate committees---and make the eventual hard choices,
especially on the level of spending cuts to pursue, down the road.
[[This is]{.mark} a [useful]{.mark} **opportunity** [to explain
how]{.mark} **leadership**]{.underline} strategy [on signature
[**legislation** works]{.mark}, whether it's **Dem**]{.underline}ocratic
[or **Republican** leaders **[herding the cats]{.mark}**. The [job is to

[change:]{.mark}** You have to **[vote for this, or else]{.mark}**. So:
[Conservatives will be persuaded to **keep moving**]{.mark} along with a
package]{.underline} that doesn't guarantee deep spending cuts, and

In other words, if Pete Hegseth and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. need to be

is [**not** exactly]{.mark} a **[news-responsive]{.mark}**

"low-propensity" voters, who rarely engage with the political media. One
pre-election Ipsos poll found that his support was especially strong

unauthorized border crossings were at historic highs. (None of those
things are true.)

### Trump Authoritarianism ! Turn\-\--2AC

#### OBBB eliminates all checks on Trump

**Kashdan 6-6**-2025, Senior Legal Counsel, Federal Advocacy at CLC.
(Eric, "These Hidden Provisions in the Budget Bill Undermine Our
Democracy," Campaign Legal,
https://campaignlegal.org/update/these-hidden-provisions-budget-bill-undermine-our-democracy)//BB

President Donald [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called "One
**[[Big]{.underline}]{.mark}** Beautiful **[[Bill]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Act" passed in the U.S. House of Representatives by a narrow vote of
215-214. This massive legislation --- totaling more than 1,000 pages ---
uses a complicated congressional procedure known as "budget
reconciliation" to allow the Senate to pass it with fewer votes than
would normally be required, and without bipartisan support.

Most attention on this budget bill has centered around issues like the
tax code, Medicaid and immigration. However, there is a lot more hidden
in the House's reconciliation proposal, including two provisions
Campaign Legal Center (CLC) has identified that [[would]{.mark} severely
[harm]{.mark} [voters]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [threaten the rule of
law]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

**[[An Attack on the Judicial Branch]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The first of these outrageous [[policies]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[buried [in]{.mark} [Section]{.mark} [70302]{.mark}]{.underline} of the
legislation--- [[would]{.mark} severely [restrict federal]{.mark}
[courts']{.mark} authority [to hold]{.mark} government
[officials]{.mark} [in contempt]{.mark} if they violate judicial
orders]{.underline}.

[A court's [ability to hold bad actors]{.mark} in contempt [is a **vital
enforcement power**]{.mark} that judges can use to compel compliance
with their rulings]{.underline}.

When somebody chooses to violate a court order, the judge who issued the
ruling has a few different options to force them to comply, including
holding them in contempt and issuing sanctions, fines, or even jail time
until the order is followed.

But the [[reconciliation]{.mark} bill [would require]{.mark}
[anyone]{.mark} [suing]{.mark} the government [to pay a bond]{.mark}
before the court can use its contempt power to enforce injunctions or
restraining orders meant to halt illegal actions]{.underline}.

By restricting this authority, the **[[House bill threatens the power of
the judicial branch]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [On its own, that represents
an attack on the rule of law and the separation of powers that underlies
our democracy. [But in]{.mark} the [context of our current political
moment]{.mark}, [a more **specific goal** is unfortunately
clear]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Courts have already ruled at least 170 times against the Trump
administration]{.underline}, including a preliminary injunction sought
by CLC that halted Trump's unconstitutional attempt to change the rules
for federal elections. In response to many of these rulings, the
president has resisted compliance and waged intimidation campaigns
targeting the judges responsible.

In light of all this, [the [House bill]{.mark} [seems]{.mark} squarely
and [unacceptably focused on **shielding the Trump**]{.mark}
**[administration from accountability]{.mark}** when it breaks the
law]{.underline}.

To make matters worse, [the new rule would be so broad that it could
allow any government actor to escape being held accountable for
violating court rulings. It would also apply to court orders and
injunctions issued before the law takes effect. This would render
thousands of prior orders across the country immediately unenforceable
through contempt proceedings, no matter how the public has already
relied on them]{.underline}.

[[Destabilization]{.mark} could be the [biggest setback for **great

disruption]{.underline}.

Polarization plays a role in nearly every causal pathway leading
to destabilization of the United States, and there is no
indication polarization will decrease.

The [United States fits the pattern of [past democracies]{.mark} that
have [descended into **authoritarian regimes**]{.mark} in many key
aspects]{.underline}.

The most recent empirical research on civil conflicts suggests the
United States is in a category that has a 4% annual risk of falling into
a civil conflict.

In 2022 (when this was originally written), Mike Berkowitz, ED of
Democracy Funders Network and 80,000 Hours guest, believes there is 50%
chance American democracy fails in the next 6 years.

For every dollar spent on depolarization efforts, there are probably at
least a hundred dollars spent aggravating the culture war.

Destabilization of the United States could wipe out billions of dollars
of pledged EA funds.

The overall topic of this piece is also salient for this 2024 election
year. I have been pleasantly surprised how many EAs have mobilized this
year around the issue of protecting American democracy... I wish this
had been the situation back in 2020 or after January 6th or after I
pushed this on the Forum and EAGs in 2022. Democracy is jeopardized not
because of a single candidate but because of the forces that made the
viability of such a candidate possible. Thus this issue cannot be
addressed only in election years.

 

The worry I've had this year is that EAs will prioritize this area only
until election day and then forget about it after January 20th, 2025.
The degradation of American democracy and stability is not
stopped *only *at the ballot box, and the forces/dynamics that are
driving that degradation have continued unabated despite every red
line[^\[3\]^](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kmx3rKh2K4ANwMqpW/destabilization-of-the-united-states-the-top-x-factor-ea#_ftn3) that
has been crossed to date. And I'm not optimistic that the red line
crossed yesterday will be any different.

 

 

**Preface**

Epistemic status:

I have thought a lot about this over the years and was warning about
risks to American democracy before the topic entered mainstream and
often sensationalized discourse.. I could be more well read on academic
literature, however I think it likely wouldn't change my views much on
diagnosis and prognosis of the
situation[^\[4\]^](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kmx3rKh2K4ANwMqpW/destabilization-of-the-united-states-the-top-x-factor-ea#_ftn4) but
could greatly influence my views of the prescription. This is a topic
that lends itself to getting lost in the rabbit hole and alarmism. My
greatest hesitation about the gravity of the situation is the fact that
many very intelligent people come to very different conclusions than me;
however, I have yet to see an argument I found compelling. I think the
probability of a destabilizing event rests a lot on people's subjective
judgements. **Below is an overview of my confidence on a few items in
this piece:    **

- Very confident that [destabilization is **[more likely]{.mark}** than
  EAs appreciate]{.underline}.

- Confident the [[consequences]{.mark} of destabilization [make it an
  **X-factor**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

- Moderately confident it's [neglected financially relative to severity
  as an X-factor]{.underline} and relative to money injected annually
  into polarization efforts (read: culture war).

- Very confident the problem is quite difficult to solve.

- Very low confidence in most proposed interventions; modest confidence
  on a couple.

 

My top reading/listening recommendations are:

1.  Robert Evans' podcast series *It Could Happen Here* (March -- May
    2019)

    a.  Not to be confused with a book of the same name by Jonathan
        Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League.

    b.  In August 2021, Evans released a daily podcast under the *It
        Could Happen Here *name. This is not the content I am
        referencing. If you are searching on a service like Spotify, you
        will need to sort the podcast episodes from oldest to newest to
        find the original series released in
        2019.[^\[5\]^](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kmx3rKh2K4ANwMqpW/destabilization-of-the-united-states-the-top-x-factor-ea#_ftn5)

2.  Ezra Klein's book *Why We're Polarized*

3.  Robert Evans's podcast miniseries "Behind the Insurrection" (a set
    of episodes from his *Behind the Bastards* podcast he released in
    the wake of January 6^th^)

4.  Daniel Ziblatt and Steve Levitsky's *How Democracies
    Die* and *Tyranny of the Minority* 

    a.  (if you don't want to read a whole book, watch their
        presentation at Politics and Prose)

 

This is an extended version of my submission to the Open Philanthropy
(OP) Cause Area Competition. The word limit and scoring structure
affected the final product (I would prefer to have focused more on the
possibility and importance of a destabilization event). I have been
working independently on an informal effort to make the case that EA
should prioritize protecting American democracy and ambitious structural
change in the U.S. political system. (The latter is not just because of
its role in the former but also because it has immense upside benefits
even if American democracy were secure). **Reach out if you are
interested in collaborating or just want to give words of
encouragement.**

 

Apologies in advance for switching back and forth between
nationality-neutral and American-centric language (e.g.
the *American* government vs. *our* government). I know EA is majority
non-Americans; although throughout this piece I feel like I am appealing
especially to American EAs.

Summary

The [[trajectory of]{.underline}]{.mark} polarization, increasing
[minoritarian rule, and the [erosion of democratic
norms]{.mark}]{.underline} and the rule of law in the United States
**[[is unsustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The forces that are driving
this trajectory (the revenue models of social media and news media, and
structural political incentives) are deeply entrenched and are known to
us. Yet, if there was going to be an intervening force sufficient to
alter our trajectory, it should have appeared by now (especially in the
wake of the January 6th, 2021 insurrection). Continuing on this path--in
addition to [high levels of [government dysfunction]{.mark}]{.underline}
(also worthy of EA's attention)--[[will **eventually** yield]{.mark}
[destabilization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Destabilization which would
likely manifest as an [authoritarian regime]{.underline} or civil
conflict (likely sparked by a failed authoritarian power
grab).[\[6\]](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kmx3rKh2K4ANwMqpW/destabilization-of-the-united-states-the-top-x-factor-ea#_ftn6)

The [[consequences of destabilization]{.mark} of the world's most
powerful superpower [are immense]{.mark}, (including for [suffering,
**x-risks**, and]{.mark} the [long-term future]{.mark}]{.underline}) and
could be the catastrophic event that cascades into an existential event.
[Destabilization of the nation that is home to the largest efforts
addressing [artificial intelligence, bio-risk, and climate]{.mark}
disruption]{.underline} would also be devasting for the EA movement
because of the amount of EA talent in the United States and the degree
to which the handful of fortunes (of Americans) that represent the vast
majority of pledged EA funds are tied to the health of the America
system. For example, a [**[right-wing authoritarian]{.mark}** could
shutdown Facebook or take other actions that would wipe out most of its
stock value]{.underline}; Forbes states that the majority of the net
worth of Dustin Moskovitz---the principal source of OP's funding---is
from his estimated 2% stake in Facebook; billions of dollars of EA/OP
funding would evaporate if this scenario were to happen.

OP and the Effective Altruism community can take a multitude of actions,
many of which not only decrease the chance of destabilization but also
have the upside of making our government function better, thus having a
force-multiplier effect on the outcomes our trillion-dollar government.
Action is urgently needed, but unfortunately most interventions have
either a very unclear cost-effectiveness or appear to not meet OP's
typical 1000x standard in short-term measurements. However, a
medium-level investigation could change the perspective on return on
investment. Effective Altruism at large needs to explore the risk of
destabilization of the United States, given the possibility it could
become one of EA's top X-factors.

If anyone reading this would like to discuss or collaborate on this
topic, please reach out! Also, let me know if this changed your
opinions/priors at all AND/OR what arguments you think need to be
improved. 

Possibility

Here is a distillation of my argument: the experts that I have read
understand the situation as the elements and dynamics depicted in [this
flow
chart](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LOIO6jsnDJhANoaRTxhvlMJYOnmBCEOBgC0ETgKiZIs/edit?usp=sharing).
The [reasons they cite for why they are not pessimistic about the
worst-case scenario do not address the mechanisms of the situation and
are more so hunches, each of which has a strong counter
argumen]{.underline}t. They openly give the impression that they are
[optimistic because it is practical rather than intellectually
merited]{.underline}. I am merely looking at the trajectory (where the
flow chart is taking us) and the inertia (the fact that nothing has
intervened to change the trajectory [[after an **unprecedented
presidency**]{.underline}]{.mark}, pandemic, and insurrection), and
making the logical jump that [the [end point is **eventually
destabilization**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Big picture

Authoritarianism

Democracies have fallen into authoritarian regimes throughout the past
100 years, and scholars have studied those instances to create a
playbook of how tyrants successfully come to power in
democracies. [\[7\]](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kmx3rKh2K4ANwMqpW/destabilization-of-the-united-states-the-top-x-factor-ea#_ftn7) 
[[Trump has]{.mark} partially or completely **[checked off every
box]{.mark}** except for]{.underline} crippling the opposition and
wresting [control of the security
forces]{.underline}[\[8\]](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kmx3rKh2K4ANwMqpW/destabilization-of-the-united-states-the-top-x-factor-ea#_ftn8) (the
latter being the most important).

Trump was unsuccessful in seizing power, however many [[people have
interpreted the **wrong lesson**]{.mark}---our [institutions
work]{.mark}]{.underline}, we can be optimistic about democracy. The
process of resisting Trump's power grab and January 6th made them
weaker, and they continue to be eroded---not rebuilt---to this
day.[\[9\]](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kmx3rKh2K4ANwMqpW/destabilization-of-the-united-states-the-top-x-factor-ea#_ftn9) The
[pathway to power has been illuminated]{.underline} for other would-be
authoritarians. The Trump-wing of the Republican party is finding decent
success in replacing non-radical Republicans in critical positions to
enable a future "constitutional coup." [[The next]{.mark}
authoritarian]{.underline} in the White House, [be it [Trump]{.mark} or
someone more competent, [will have much more
success]{.mark}]{.underline}. These are the concerns of a number of
serious scholars and
pundits.[\[10\]](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kmx3rKh2K4ANwMqpW/destabilization-of-the-united-states-the-top-x-factor-ea#_ftn10)

The [[demise of democracies]{.mark} into **[presidential
autocracies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, fascist regimes, and one-party
states is an arc, not a linear line. The rise of fascism in the 30s
[occurred on a sharp arc relative to the gentler curve of illiberal
authoritarianism]{.underline} of Viktor Orban's Hungary. Daniel Ziblatt
and Steve Levitsky, the authors of How Democracies Die, emphasize how
modern democracies deteriorate over longer time scales that enable
a [boiling-frog syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog).

I contend that [both a sharp and gentle curve are possible]{.underline}.
The important point is that [[we could be]{.mark} near or past [the
**inflection point**]{.mark} of the curve]{.underline}. In Behind the
Bastards' miniseries "Behind the Insurrection," journalist Robert Evans
focuses on how insurrections, paramilitary groups, political violence,
[enablement of authoritarians by establishment politicians, and a voter
base of around 30% of the population were at the inflection point of
fascist regimes]{.underline} that came to power or attempted to come to
power. In more recent regimes birthed from democracies, How Democracies
Die emphasizes the erosion of the democratic norms forbearance and
mutual toleration, establishment politicians enabling the aspiring
authoritarian, and the aspiring authoritarian being elected to power in
more
recent.[\[11\]](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kmx3rKh2K4ANwMqpW/destabilization-of-the-united-states-the-top-x-factor-ea#_ftn11) The
[United States has roughly analogous features]{.underline} in the
present situation.

###  Trump Bad ! Turn \-\-- Courts Key

#### Only the courts can restrain Trump

**Del Percio 25**, American political strategist, media analyst, and
Republican political analyst with a Master's Degree in Political
Communication from Emerson College (Susan, 6/15, "Trump never seems able
to quit while he\'s ahead. The L.A. protests prove it.", MSNBC,
https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-poll-los-angeles-protests-immigration-rcna212751)///CA

Once again **[[Trump]{.mark} [gets to change the
conversation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[We were]{.underline}]{.mark}
recently [[talking about budget cuts]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} his feud with [[Elon]{.underline}]{.mark}
Musk. **[[Now we're not.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

He used those violent visuals of looting and chaos --- as relatively
limited as they were --- to send in the National Guard, followed by 700
Marines. Clearly, Trump was trying to use the military to make a show of
strength --- whether or not Los Angeles actually needed the help. The
narrative was obvious: America needed protecting, and he was there to
protect it. Democrats, on the other hand, are weak and care more about
immigrants than Americans. Once again [Trump]{.underline} [gets to
change the conversation.]{.underline} We were recently talking
about budget cuts and his feud with Elon Musk. Now we're not.

The White House staff, at least initially, couldn't believe its
luck. According to Axios, [[the White House]{.underline}]{.mark} and its
[[allies]{.mark} absolutely [saw]{.mark} the [protests]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} a [political opportunity to push
Trump\'s]{.mark}]{.underline} immigration policy and \"[[big, beautiful
bill]{.mark}.]{.underline} \""It's the best BBB marketing ever. It has
brought the critical nature of increased border funding and immigration
enforcement to the fore," said Turning Point USA spokesman Andrew
Kolvet.

Tom Homan and Trump started ad-libbing about whether California Gov.
Gavin Newsom should be arrested. And House Speaker Mike Johnson was so
eager to show his loyalty to Trump that he suggested Newsom "ought to be
tarred and feathered."

But [[while]{.underline}]{.mark} violent
[[protesters]{.underline}]{.mark} and looting in the streets [[aren't a
winning campaign]{.underline}]{.mark} message for Democrats,
[[Trump's]{.mark} increasingly [heated rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}
[a]{.mark}nd insistence on escalation **[[comes with]{.mark} its own
[political risks.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Immigration was, at least up until recently, an issue on which Trump
reliably polled on well. Back in January, a Quinnipiac poll of
registered voters showed 47% approved of how Trump was handling
immigration issues while 46% disapproved. However, looking at a newer
Quinnipiac poll conducted from last Thursday to Monday, only 43% of
registered voters approved of Trump's handling of immigration issues,
and his disapproval numbers on the issue had jumped up 8 points, to 54%.
(Sunday\'s NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey gives
Trump an edge on the issue, with a slim majority of 51% still
approving of his handling of border security and immigration.)

Meanwhile, a YouGov poll of 4,300 adults conducted Tuesday found that
45% disapproved of Trump's sending in the National Guard, while 38%
approved. Even more people disapproved of sending in the Marines.

[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} almost always **[[wants to push as far as
he can]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Testing]{.mark} the [limits of his
power]{.mark} is his default setting]{.underline}**. But during his
first term, Trump was often reined in by those around him. During a
meeting in the Oval Office in 2019, Trump stunned aides with his ideas
about how to prevent migrants from entering the United States. "After
publicly suggesting that soldiers shoot migrants if they threw rocks,
the president backed off when his staff told him that was illegal,\"
reported The New York Times.

Trump's former defense secretary Mark Esper recalled that in 2020, when
Trump wanted to clear Black Lives Matter protesters from outside the
White House, he asked, "Can't you just shoot them? Just shoot them in
the legs or something."

There is little question that Trump believes the military is a powerful
tool, both symbolically and practically.

This time around, **[[Trump]{.mark} has [surrounded]{.mark}
[himself]{.mark} [with yes people]{.mark} and sycophants]{.underline}**
[[who]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[enable]{.mark} and
approve]{.underline} of his [[decision-making]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Meanwhile, congressional Republicans have been quiet about his military
interventionism, with the weak exceptions of Sens. Susan Collins of
Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. **[That [leaves only the courts as a
final check]{.mark}.]{.underline}** He is looking to see just how much
power he truly has so he knows just how much power he can use.

###  Trump Authoritarianism ! Turn\-\--Link\-\--1AR

#### OBBB collapses democracy through legalized AI misinformation

**Kashdan 6-6**-2025, Senior Legal Counsel, Federal Advocacy at CLC.
(Eric, "These Hidden Provisions in the Budget Bill Undermine Our
Democracy," *Campaign Legal,*
https://campaignlegal.org/update/these-hidden-provisions-budget-bill-undermine-our-democracy)//BB

A Flood of False Information in Elections

[The second problematic provision --- found within Section 43201(c) of
[the]{.mark} House [reconciliation bill]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[would
impose a 10-year ban on the enforcement of all state and local laws that
regulate]{.underline}]{.mark} artificial intelligence
(**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**), including rules for AI's use in
political campaigns and elections.

[Currently, [more than 20 states have already enacted laws to address
election misinformation and manipulation]{.mark} made easy [by]{.mark}
new [AI]{.mark} tools. [These laws are **meant to address real
challenges for our democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, like fake content
that misleads voters about the candidates or issues on their ballot.

[As the technology develops, the public has already seen how [AI can be
used to depict events that never actually happened, discourage
participation in elections, and]{.mark} even [create false admissions of
election interference]{.mark}]{.underline}.

To protect voters from these harms, CLC and others have called on
Congress to pass strong legislation regulating AI's use in our
democratic process. However, Congress has so far failed to act.

In that void, [[states]{.mark} across the country [have stepped
up]{.mark} and enacted [safeguards]{.mark}, such as prohibiting AI from
being used to intentionally deceive voters and requiring disclaimers
that inform the public when election ads use content manipulated or
generated with AI.]{.underline}

[If [the House reconciliation package]{.mark} is allowed to
**[override]{.mark}** [these]{.mark} state [laws]{.mark}, Congress will
have not only failed in its own duty to regulate AI but actively
prevented other lawmakers from protecting their
constituents]{.underline}.

[Simply put, [a 10-year ban on enforcing AI laws across the country
could mean a decade of false information that undermines voters' right
to make informed decisions. It would be]{.mark}]{.underline} more than
misguided, and outright **[[dangerous for the future of truth and trust
in our elections]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[American [democracy is]{.mark} already [facing unprecedented
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The rule of law is under attack,
while public confidence in our elected leaders and government
institutions continues to falter. [[If Congress enacts these]{.mark} two
[provisions]{.mark} buried in the House budget bill, [the situation will
only get worse]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Updates

[[On June 5, the Senate Commerce Committee released a proposal to modify
the House's ban on]{.mark} the enforcement of state and local [AI
laws]{.mark}. This new version would tie existing funding for broadband
infrastructure to compliance with Congress's ban on
regulating]{.underline} AI. In other words, states would have to choose
between regulating AI or getting federal support to connect their
citizens to the internet.

Because all 50 states receive this funding, **[[the effect of the new
provision could be the same]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The reconciliation
bill remains deeply problematic and would still override state's right
to safeguard their elections from AI-generated
falsehoods]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[On June 12, the Senate Judiciary Committee released its modifications
to]{.mark} the House reconciliation bill, including changes to the
legislation's restriction on [courts' enforcement]{.mark}
power]{.underline}. The updated text appears to respond to public
criticism, including CLC's concerns, and removes language that would
have retroactively undermined countless judicial decisions already on
the books.

However, [[the Judiciary Committee's changes could make it **even
harder** for]{.mark} future [cases to hold government officials]{.mark}
[accountable]{.mark} if they break the law]{.underline}.

[This modified provision would still force those suing the government to
pay a bond before they can secure judicial orders halting illegal
actions, but it also tries to remove any discretion courts have to
require a nominal bond that could let public interest cases proceed at
minimal cost. As a result, individuals, nonprofits, charities and others
could face exorbitant financial barriers to the justice
system]{.underline}.

As described more fully below, among [[the changes
proposed]{.underline}]{.mark} to the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022
(the IRA)1, the Act [[includes]{.underline}]{.mark} the following:

[[repeal]{.underline} [o]{.underline}]{.mark}[f]{.underline} the
technology-neutral [[tax credits]{.underline}]{.mark} (i.e., Section 45Y
Clean Electricity Production Credit (45Y PTC) and Section 48E Clean
Electricity Investment Credit (48E ITC)) for projects (i) on which
construction begins more than 60 days following the date of the Act's
enactment or (ii) that are placed in service after 2028 (without regard
to when construction begins)

[other energy credits]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[repeal]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the credit
[transferability]{.mark}]{.underline} provision starting (i) two years
after enactment of the Act, for the 45Q Carbon Oxide Sequestration
Credit, or (ii) in 2028, for the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing
Production Credit and the Section 45Z tax credits Clean Fuel Production
Credit

introduction of restrictions [[and]{.mark} [limitations]{.mark} [for
claiming]{.mark} energy credits]{.underline} by adding foreign entity of
concern (FEOC) related provisions starting in 2026

Key Takeaways

[If enacted]{.underline}, **[[the Act will significantly]{.mark}
[affect]{.mark} the [renewable energy industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**
and [[adversely]{.mark} affect the ability [to
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} and finance various [renewable
[energy]{.mark} [projects]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The new [[FEOC-related restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark} may
[[cause]{.mark} [taxpayers]{.mark} and projects that would otherwise be
eligible for such tax credits **[to lose]{.mark}**]{.underline} their
**[[eligibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** due to ownership and supply-chain
issues. Accordingly, the inclusion of the FEOC-related provisions and
their broad application will need to be carefully analyzed and discussed
in connection with existing and future commercial arrangements.

[trajectory of international climate action]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Reaching emission reduction commitments

[With]{.underline} the [I]{.underline}nflation [R]{.underline}eduction
[A]{.underline}ct, [the]{.underline} [[United States]{.mark} [will be
significantly]{.mark}]{.underline} [[closer]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to
meeting]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[Paris]{.underline}]{.mark} Agreement
commitment. At the 2021 Leaders' Summit on Climate, President
Biden announced an enhanced NDC that states [[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will]{.mark} "[achieve]{.mark} [a

levels]{.mark} [in]{.mark} economy-wide net [g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse
[g]{.mark}a[s]{.mark} pollution]{.underline} in 2030." Under current
policy, expected GHG emissions reductions were only 24 to 35 percent;
however, independent analyses estimate that the Inflation Reduction Act
will bring GHG emissions down by about 31 to 44 percent or 37 to 41
percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Both modelers agree that with the
addition of state and federal regulatory action, these investments will
put within reach the full goal of 50 percent emissions reductions this
decade.

With the addition of state and federal regulatory action, \[[[Inflation
Reduction Act\]]{.mark} investments]{.underline} will **[put [within
reach the full goal]{.mark}]{.underline}** of 50 percent emissions
reductions this decade.

The Inflation Reduction Act, along with administrative regulations, will
be viewed internationally as the U.S. NDC implementation plan as well as
an indication that the United States is finally taking the real,
necessary action to get its house in order as it works to reduce
emissions globally. This step allows the Biden administration to head
into November's U.N. climate conference (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheik,
Egypt, with a strong bargaining position and may help increase other
nations' ambition and ability to meet their NDCs.

**[[Spurring]{.mark} an [economic]{.mark} and manufacturing "[race to

With well north of \$70 billion in clean domestic manufacturing
investments, the Inflation Reduction Act strengthens America's standing
on global trade with both partners and competitors. Traditionally,
American industries and federal support drove the technological
innovations that fundamentally changed the energy, transportation, and
manufacturing sectors. [The Inflation Reduction Act gives the needed
boost to domestic clean energy
industries]{.underline}---[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} requirements
for domestic sourcing and through manufacturing **[[tax]{.mark}
[incentives]{.mark}]{.underline}** designed to reshore supply
chains---to enable these industries to catch up to nations that

technological innovation, manufacturing, and deployment that will
characterize the energy market for the remainder of the 21st century.

Amount the Inflation Reduction Act will provide in clean domestic
manufacturing investments

Yet the Inflation Reduction Act will not only keep the United States
competitive in global markets by protecting American industries; [[it
will]{.underline}]{.mark} also further [[drive]{.underline}]{.mark}
the global **[[competitiveness]{.mark} necessary [for a race to the
top]{.mark}]{.underline}** on clean energy innovation. Due to
the outsize role of the U.S. economy within the global market, [this
[boost]{.mark} [in]{.mark} U.S. [manufacturing]{.mark} and development
of clean energy]{.underline} technologies **[[will help lower the
cost]{.underline}]{.mark}** of clean energy, facilitating and
**[[incentivizing]{.mark} more [rapid energy
transitions]{.mark}]{.underline}** abroad. These transitions are
necessary **[[in high-emitting countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
countries seeking energy independence, as well as in countries with
limited emissions that have the opportunity to leap-frog over fossil
fuel-based economies on their development pathway.

Reshaping the energy and national security landscape

The Inflation Reduction Act will improve U.S. national and energy
security. [The U.S. [D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f

The [I]{.underline}nflation [R]{.underline}eduction [A]{.underline}ct's
investments in clean energy will [also]{.underline} [reduce U.S.
dependence]{.underline} **[on a fossil fuel-dominated global
economy]{.underline}** largely dictated by nations that do not share
American values. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act will help cut
U.S. oil demand by more than twice the amount the United States ever
imported from Russia. Coupled with federal executive actions, the
Inflation Reduction Act will dramatically reduce the exposure of the
U.S. economy to volatile foreign fossil fuel prices, avoiding periods,
such as this summer, during which Americans have to weather
prohibitively high gas prices while oil and gas companies rake in record
profits. Additionally, the legislation will negate the need for
"fist-bump diplomacy" with authoritarian leaders.

In 2022, European meteorologists recorded the worst drought on the
European continent in more than 500 years (European Commission et al,
2022). AtmosphericCO2 concentrations were more than 50 per cent above
pre-industrial levels for the first time, primarily because of emissions
from the combustion of fossil fuels and cement production (WMO, 2023),
but also driven by the surge in military spending after the Russian
invasion of Ukraine. NATO's 2023 military spending accounted for 233
million t CO2 , 5.5 per cent of the total emissions and an increase of
15 per cent. The last time such concentrations prevailed, 3--5 million
years ago, the Earth temperature was 2--3°C and the sea level 10--20 m
higher (WMO, 2023). Little wonder then that 2023 was the hottest of the
last 125,000 years. [[We]{.underline}]{.mark} and the plants and animals
we use [[are **leaving** the]{.mark} climate [**envelope** of]{.mark}
human [civilization, **everywhere**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Xu et al,
2020). However, mere temperature figures are dry air temperatures taken
by thermometers, and do not reflect human health impacts. To
[consider]{.underline} sweating and [humidity, 'wet-bulb temperature'
(**WBT**)]{.underline} is measured. Vanos et al (2023) have shown that
in a mixture of sun and shade exposure, and rest and sport, [the
**[survival limits]{.mark}** for WBT [are]{.mark}]{.underline} between
[**[26°]{.mark}**C]{.underline} and 34°C in young people and between
21°C and 34°C in older people. At these thresholds, a healthy person can
survive for only around six hours, [leading to **heat stroke** in even
the healthiest people -- [**everyone** will die at that]{.mark}
point]{.underline} (Wong, 2023). More than 60,000 people died in Europe
as a result of the 2022 heat waves (Ballester et al, 2023), and almost
50,000 in 2023 (Miranda et al, 2023). During the 2024 Hajj, the Muslim
pilgrimage to Mecca, the heat caused more than 1,300 heat deaths.
According to the United Nations, around 70 per cent of the global
working population, that is, 2.4 billion people, are now at high risk
from extreme heat.

While in 2009, three Planetary Boundaries had been crossed, it was four
in 2015 and six out of nine in 2023 (Ruwet, 2023). Having crossed a
tipping point, there is no way back to the status quo ante -- the
development is irreversible and no longer under human control.
Overshooting tipping points and triggering tipping cascades will shape
the Earth for the millennia to come. For instance, on Greenland, ice
equivalent to a 1--2-metre rise in global sea levels is likely already
doomed to melt, only the time scale is disputed (Boers, 2021). Tropical
coral reefs are bound to die off, and the [[Amazon]{.underline}]{.mark}
rainforest **[[dieback]{.underline}]{.mark}** (including logging) [will
not only **wreak havoc** on South and]{.underline} some [North American
precipitation]{.underline} systems, [forest **fires** and drinking
**water**]{.underline} availability (Joughin et al, 2014; Armstrong
McKay et al, 2022), [but [will accelerate]{.mark}]{.underline} global
[**[heating]{.mark}** by [turning a]{.mark} **carbon [sink]{.mark}**
[into]{.mark} a **[source]{.mark}**. The [same]{.mark} is happening
[to]{.mark} the **[Canadian]{.mark}** (and probably
**[Russian]{.mark}**) boreal **[forests]{.mark}**]{.underline}, turning
from a carbon sink to a major source -- in 2024, only China, the United
States and India emitted more CO2 than the Canadian forest fires (Byrne
et al, 2024). [The **[AMOC]{.mark}**]{.underline} (in the North called
the Gulf Stream) [[might **be**]{.mark} the **[next]{.mark}** tipping
point]{.underline} to be [crossed]{.underline} (Lohmann and Ditlevsen,
2021). It is [now weaker than]{.underline} it has been [for]{.underline}
at least [1,600 years]{.underline} (Thornalley et al, 2018).
[Most]{.underline} of the weakening [can]{.underline} clearly [be
**attributed** to the burning of **fossil fuels**]{.underline} (Caesar
et al, 2018). Its collapse would lead to a massive cooling of Europe in
a heating world and is expected for 2050 (central estimate, range
2025--2095) if global carbon emissions are not significantly reduced
(Ditlevsen and Ditlevsen, 2023).

Politics

The reports to COP28 in December 2023 were incomplete and partly
greenwashing. While emissions of 20 bln t CO2eq 2030 would be 1.5°
consistent (25 bln for 2°), government pledges add up to 33 bln t.
Current policies, if continued, would lead to 37 bln t 2030, that is, no
reductions as compared to 2023, and announced plans and projects would
increase emissions about 45 bln t CO2eq 2030. Escalating
politicaltensions in the Eastern Mediterranean and in the South China
Sea over ownership of (expected) gas reserves illustrate that access to
additional fossil fuels is still a policy priority. This is all the more
true for a number of mostly extreme right authoritarian governments and
personalities (Trump, Musk, and so on).

For the following projections we assume that neither pledges nor the
announced plans are realised, and hence emissions remain almost constant
-- that is, we assume that the efforts in antagonistic directions rather
cancel out each other's effects. This is an optimistic assumption, given
the announced exploitation plan for coal (calculation in exajoule for
better comparability: India +11 EJ, Russia +3 EJ, Indonesia +2.3 EJ,
Colombia +1.8 EJ), oil (Saudi Arabia +5.5 EJ, USA +5 EJ, Brazil +5 EJ,
Canada +3 EJ) and gas (Qatar +3.8 EJ, Russia +3 EJ, Nigeria, USA and
China each +2.5 EJ) (SEI et al, 2023).

Globalisation is in retreat, neoimperialism is replacing neoliberalism
in international relations -- but it still dominates in domestic
politics. Nonetheless, free trade is in decline -- currently, more than
a quarter of countries and almost a third of the global economy are
affected by sanctions. The biggest problem are the secondary sanctions,
which most international lawyers classify as illegal (Shidore, 2024).
These developments have diminished the predicted 'bouncing back' of the
global economy after the recent periods of recession (the global
financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic and the
war/inflation/cost-of-living crisis). These crises have shown that it is
precisely the growth dependent economic model that is in enormous
difficulties when the economic system reduces its consumption of energy
and new materials, that is, stops growing. However, despite the multiple
environmental (climate, biodiversity, pollution) and social crises
(poverty, income polarisation) and the resulting necessity to adjust the
economic system, this has not led to developing a 'Plan B'. The European
conservatives, like many decision-makers, even hope to achieve climate
protection by economic growth, an oxymoron turned principle of faith,
even dogma, against all empirical data, and sacrificing biodiversity and
pollution policies on this altar.

Consumers

Consumers are reluctant to adapt their habits as well, although even
food insecurity is rising, also in the North: the 2018 European heatwave
led to multiple crop failures and loss of yield of up to 50 per cent in
Central and Northern Europe. In 2022, record temperatures in the UK
killed fruit and vegetables on the vine (Tollefson, 2023). Large numbers
of people are being displaced by worsening weather extremes, and the
world's poor are being hit by far the hardest (IPCC, 2022).

The world's richest 10 per cent are causing 50 per cent of the climate
heating emissions, making them key to ending the climate crisis; about
two-thirds of them live in the North. The global consumer class
encompasses most of the middle classes in developed countries (anyone
paid more than about €38,000 a year), who are hardly willing to give up
their lifestyles. The number of cars per capita still increases in
Europe, although two-thirds of global oil consumption is for the
transport sector, mostly private cars. Middle-income country citizens
were more motivated to endorse strict mitigation measures than those
from affluent countries (OECD, 2020).

When climate negotiations began in the 1990s, most of the inequality in
people's carbon emissions was between rich and poor nations. Today, most
of the inequality in emissions between the rich and poor exists within
individual countries, with the richest 10 per cent of people causing up
to 40 times more climate heating emissions than the poorest 10 per cent
of their fellow citizens. A 2020 Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development study found that the most effective mitigation measures
find least consumer support, with the strongest support in China,
followed by Italy (OECD, 2020).

Business

The big oil companies have recently abandoned the targets they promised
in recent years to reduce oil and gas production and cut their emissions
-- they do not expect effective climate policies to be enacted.
Consequently, ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell and Total modified their
business plans, started exploring new oil fields and invested in
additional production capacities which are to come online in 2026/7. As
these were voluntary declarations, there is no sanction for this breach
of promise, and the retreat pays out: the profit margins in renewable
energy are lower than what oil managers are used to, so they
re-fossilise their portfolios. For instance, ExxonMobil quietly withdrew
funding for a high-profile project to use algae to produce lowcarbon
fuels. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told an industry conference in June 2023
that his company planned to double oil production from its US shale gas
reserves over the next five years -- resulting in record profits of
US\$9.2 bln for Exxon in the three months of the second quarter of 2024.
Banks are more than willing to finance such investments. BP retracted
its earlier target of cutting emissions by 35 per cent by 2030 -- in
real terms BP has expanded its gas drilling. Shell announced that it
would not increase its investment in renewable energy in 2023, even
though it had previously promised to drastically reduce its emissions
(Noor, 2023). The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
announced that it would increase its annual oil production by more than
half a million barrels per day from October 2024, as it expects peak
demand at some time long after 2040.

The chemical industry tries to rescue its business model, replacing
fossil by solar energy and fossil feedstock by organic and synthetic
substances. Unfortunately for them, the volumes of both biomass and
green electricity available are but a fraction of what an unchanged
business model requires, and they are expensive. Already in 2023 the
sector estimated that to transition to net zero in Europe, chemical
companies would need to increase their capital expenditure by 70 per
cent and maintain this level of investment annually until 2050 -- money
that would have to come from government subsidies as 60 per cent of
chemical industry executives said they couldn't afford further
investment in decarbonisation (Scott, 2024). However, given the supply
constraints, even substantial public subsidies cannot bridge the gap --
a climate neutral chemistry remains out of reach.

The automotive industry reluctantly endorses the switch to
electro-mobility, but also has no new business model and tries to limit
the innovation to replacing the fossil by a new electric drivetrain, in
Europe and the United States for SUVs and pick-up trucks. Sustainable
mobility in a broader sense, for instance preference for non-motorised
transport or replacement of business trips by online communication, is
still anathema.

Science

[The **[effects]{.mark}** of]{.underline} such a [strong warming [are
**still**]{.mark} insufficiently researched]{.underline} -- some
scientists speak of the 'climate endgame' (Kemp et al, 2022). Climate
[researchers have constantly **[underestimated]{.mark}**]{.underline}
both the [**extent** and]{.underline} the [**speed** of change,
and]{.underline} economists, who have [long **played down** climate
change]{.underline}, still massively misperceive science (economics is a
scholastic system, not a science: Diesendorf et al, 2024), underestimate
the social costs of the climate crisis, and thus misadvise policy
(Rennert et al, 2022).

2030

Economy and Politics

The war in Ukraine has ended with a compromise, Russia keeping Crimea,
but the Near East conflict is close to a nuclear confrontation. The
United States has withdrawn support from Ukraine, leaving the
multi-billion job to rebuild the country to Europe; no comparable
efforts are undertaken in Palestine. The significant weaponry production
facilities built up during the war in Ukraine continue producing,
flooding the world with exports from Europe, Russia and the United
States, and fuelling military conflicts around the world. The
international order, international regulations and norms are eroding.
Throughout the world economy, resource constraints are felt -- this is a
major challenge to the EU refining economy model (importing cheap
resources at low cost, exporting sophisticated products at high ones).
With these effects on top of the decades-old trend of secular
stagnation, economic growth has come to a standstill. To secure resource
access and trade, the major powers (United States, China, Russia and
their satellites) increasingly use military means.

The electrification of all spheres of life continues, following US
standards for the West, and Chinese ones for the rest of the world.
Artificial intelligence and Large Language Models made the share of
global greenhouse gas emissions double from about 4 per cent of the
global total -- an unbroken trend driven by demand and supply.
Governments invest heavily in subsidising technical solutions to still
not declining CO2 emissions like carbon capture and storage (CCS --
capturing CO2 from production processes, purifying and compressing it,
transporting it to on-shore and off-shore underground dumping sites and
storing it there). However, the volumes stored remain marginal, and the
process is expensive and increases overall energy consumption. The new
'hydrogen ready' natural gas fired power stations built in the first
half of the decade continue running on fossil fuels as the limited
amount of 'green hydrogen' available is used for production processes.
Hence, even if some of them are converted to hydrogen, the hydrogen they
use is generated from natural gas. So while gasoline use is decreasing,
natural gas consumption increases steeply.

Consumers are still unwilling to change habits -- solar energy
production in households has been growing significantly as it saves
costs, but overall energy consumption is still increasing. Reduction of
heat demand falls short of what is needed to limit the climate crisis,
sustainable mobility including less car use, and even the market share
of electric vehicles, is only growing slowly -- bans on fossil fuel cars
have been abandoned under the pressure of public opinion and
conservative parties. Sufficiency is still anathema, even more so as
expectations of rising incomes are being disappointed. After a short
phase of war Keynesianism (growth through military investment), economic
growth is further slowing down due to higher resource and energy costs,
insecure supply chains, re-shoring (relocating industries back into the
national economy -- a kind of insurance against supply risks, associated
with less division of tasks and higher cost).

Society

Social inequality is increasing, as the richer strata of society are
better able to protect themselves from climate impacts than the poorer,
but this is accepted after decades of neoliberal education -- social
consideration is dwindling, self-fulfilment at the expense of others is
on the rise (Benz, 2022), the brutalisation of elites has taken hold of
the middle classes (Heitmeyer, 2012). The crisis of care, remunerated
and voluntary, is accelerating (Spangenberg and Lorek, 2022). As in the
past after floods, droughts, cyclones and heat waves, violence against
women and members of gender minorities is on the rise -- mental stress,
drug abuse, economic problems, food insecurity and poor social
infrastructure after climate disasters are the immediate triggers
(Rodrigues, 2022).

The readiness to employ violence in all kinds of conflicts, or just for
the fun of it, continues to increase -- police, fire brigades and
ambulances are attacked, as are local politicians. As frightened people
withdraw from such engagement, public security and democracy are
suffering, and extremism is on the rise. Together with the increasing
income polarisation, this leads to emerging unrest, intensifying social
tensions exploited by the far right/neo-fascists; and populist parties
win majorities.

Climate

[The global **temp**]{.underline}erature rise has surpassed 1.5°C and
[is on its way to]{.underline} 2° to **[3°]{.underline}**C (Carrington,
2022). [The causes are]{.underline} manifold -- besides the [lack of
**political will** and]{.underline} sufficient [**funding**, and
institutional]{.underline} feasibility [constraints]{.underline}, the
conversion of many economic sectors is failing due to a lack of skilled
workers, especially in handicraft professions. Second, physical
resources are lacking, not only because of unreliable supply chains, but
also because minerals and metals are not available in sufficient
quantities -- past expansion plans have systematically ignored the
finite nature of resources. Given the lack of resources, competition of
decarbonisation strategies with digital applications and armament is
leading to a price explosion that is slowing down the expansion of
renewable energies. [**NATO** members]{.underline} have
[increased]{.underline} their [**military** spending]{.underline} to 2
per cent of their GDP, [causing]{.underline} annual additional
[**emissions** larger than those of **Russia**]{.underline}, the world's
largest natural gas producer. Accelerated clean energy production
reduces the energy cost, but contributes little to reducing the overall
emissions.

Due to insufficient decarbonisation, lack of conservation of materials
and energy, and the influence of the fossil fuel industry, greenhouse
gas [emissions remain **too high**]{.underline}. For example, since
2022, the 12 largest oil and gas companies alone have spent €103 million
per day on the development and exploitation of new oil and gas fields
(Carrington, 2021). Correspondingly, [[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}
have [[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} by [**14 per cent** [since
**2020**]{.mark} instead of **falling** by 50 per cent]{.underline} as
required (McKie, 2022). Governments did nothing to prevent oil and gas
multinationals from embarking on these projects, which clearly made
compliance with the 1.5° limit impossible (Carrington and Taylor, 2022).

As a result of higher evaporation, [summer [**drought** is]{.mark} the
new **[normal]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Europe, including heat waves and
large-scale forest fires (up 40 per cent in the Mediterranean). [The
number of **[heat days]{.mark}** has **[doubled]{.mark}**]{.underline}
compared to 1971--81 and the number of frost days has dropped
significantly. At the same time, there are [extreme **cold
spells**]{.underline} (persistent low temperatures of up to minus 20°C
in Central Europe and massive snowfalls in the Mediterranean) due to
polar air intrusions, [caused by]{.underline} the [**weakening** of
the]{.underline} circumpolar **[jet stream]{.underline}**. The ongoing
[Amazon **dieback**]{.underline} has [turned]{.underline} wider parts of
[the basin from carbon **sinks** into carbon]{.underline} emission
**[sources]{.underline}**, further [accelerating **climate**
change.]{.underline}

Although heavy rainfall on land has increased by 16 per cent in Europe,
and massive investments in flood protection are required, more than 270
million people suffer from water shortages, and in some regions water
has to be rationed regularly. Water-intensive agricultural crops are
being cut back, ploughing is becoming problematic. [[Harvests are **at
risk**]{.mark} due to]{.underline} the mix of [**heat**, drought, heavy
**rain** and **frost**]{.underline} periods, while varieties genetically
optimised for one environmental condition fail under the other
conditions. [In particular]{.underline}, winter [cereals]{.underline},
depending on a prolonged period of low temperatures before they can
shoot and flower (vernalisation), [produce significantly **reduced
yields**.]{.underline}

The [collapse of the **Greenland** ice sheet is
accelerating]{.underline}, but it is not yet clear by when it will have
melted completely, raising global sea levels by seven metres.
Decision-makers are hoping for the long term and postponing protective
measures for coastal regions that go beyond incremental dike increases.
[The **[tipping points]{.mark}** of the climate]{.underline}, first
exceeded in the early 2020s, [[are]{.mark} becoming **[a
cascade]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Armstrong McKay et al, 2022).
[Migration]{.underline} and immigration [of species]{.underline} result
in communities that have never existed in the past 10,000 years,
[altering]{.underline} the spectrum of [ecosystem services]{.underline}
provided. The [[**restoration** of ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark} and
their services [[proves]{.mark} to be
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Health

In particular in ageing societies, health costs are spiralling out of
control (in European public health systems less than in the United
States). The problem is aggravated by the additional challenges caused
by environmental degradation, like more frequent pandemics, new
infectious diseases and the curbs on medical research introduced to
minimise the risk of terrorists using bio-medical know-how to produce
and disseminate bioweapons (Brent et al, 2024).

The areas suitable for malaria transmission have grown by 10 per cent
and more where re-wetting of wetlands was implemented. Disease vectors
such as the tiger mosquito are forming stable local populations in
formerly temperate climate zones, ticks continue to spread, and known
tropical pathogens are spreading at an increasing rate (Mora et al,
2022). It is not possible to prevent the new waves of infection through
precautionary measures due to the multitude of mechanisms of action.

2040

Economy

The obstacles to growth already manifest in 2030 have been growing, and
new ones have emerged, for individual countries (mostly the heavily
export-dependent ones like China and Germany), and for the world economy
as a whole. Already 15 years ago, economic research estimated that an
increase in global temperature of 1°C would lead to a 12 per cent
decline in global GDP (Bilal and Känzig, 2024), and the 'locked in'
global economic damage caused by global warming up to the year 2050 was
estimated to be almost US\$60,000 billion, corresponding to 30 per cent
of the global economy (Kotz et al, 2024) -- now the bill has to be paid.
Add to this the expenditure on coastal protection, relocation of dykes
and partial abandonment of cities and settlements due to the faster than
expected rise in sea levels now and in the next decades (Taberna, 2022),
what we have been facing since 2030 is just the beginning of a
long-term, climate change-induced recession of the entire global economy
(Kotz et al, 2024).

Hence, after years of stagnation, [economic [growth]{.mark} has
**[turned negative]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The economic reason is that
to generate growth, the annual investment must be higher than what is
needed to compensate for loss to wear and tear, and the requirements of
technological development -- otherwise the production potential does not
increase. Investments are financed from the surplus of the previous
year, plus by credit. The latter is limited in the private sector by the
risk of over-indebtedness, and in the public sector by the necessity to
keep redemption below a level impinging on key policy priorities, and to
limit the regressive effects of taxpayers financing the interest for
rich lenders. [[Hence]{.mark} the necessary]{.underline} massive
defensive [investments in climate **[adaptation]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the [repair of]{.underline} environmental [**damages**, protection
of]{.underline} biodiversity (not least [for **food**]{.underline}
security) [and cleaning]{.underline} the environment from
health-threatening [pollution]{.underline} with particulate matter,
[microplastics]{.underline} and the like -- economically [necessary to
avoid future losses -- [begin **crowding out**]{.mark} investments
in]{.underline} expanding the **[[production]{.underline}]{.mark}**
potential. The increased [[spending on]{.mark} CCS and
hydrogen]{.underline} processes and
**[[infra]{.underline}]{.mark}**structures,
**[[arm]{.underline}]{.mark}**ament[[**s**, and business]{.mark}
subsidies]{.underline} for climate neutral production (state subsidies
cover a significant share of the European chemical industry's 2021--50
decarbonisation funding gap of US\$550 billion \[Scott, 2024\]), and so
on, [[**exacerbates** the situation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore,
the [[health systems]{.mark} are at the brink of [**collapse** due to
heat]{.mark}-induced]{.underline} treatment [needs, [and with
them]{.mark} the [**stability** of]{.mark} an [**ageing**
society]{.mark}]{.underline} (Romanello et al, 2021). Such investments
are classified as 'defensive', as they prevent damages accumulating, but
are not (or only to a certain part) enhancing the production potential.
Subsidies are claimed as for the business sector, defensive investment
needs are mostly the result of mandatory legal obligations. Innovation,
dematerialization and digitalization suffer, in particular as
decarbonization, digitalization and weapons production are competing for
the same or similar physical resources. As defensive investments are
crowding out business production capacity enhancing investments, the
production potential is shrinking, and GDP declines. For some time,
public authorities have tried to compensate such investment capital
scarcity with [public **[funding]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but the
[[required]{.underline}]{.mark} level [[is **surpassing**]{.mark} all
estimates of]{.underline} public [fund
**[availability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The necessary level of
government spending begins to lead to a higher tax burden on corporate
profits and to declining real incomes, public disapproval and social
unrest.

Consumption

Consumption, which has been the main driver of ecological burdens since
the turn of the millennium, is declining -- the consumer [society is
**running out** of consumers]{.underline} (Spangenberg and Kurz, 2023).
However, this externally enforced reduction in consumption leads an ever
fiercer defence of privileges, less willingness to voluntarily reduce
consumption, or to share the remaining wealth with others, in particular
with the Global South. Hence, public pressure results in an end to
development cooperation and (the always insufficient) financial support
for climate adaptation to poor countries. The result is more climate
refugees, clashing with a decreasing willingness to welcome any kind of
migrants as they are -- wrongly -- perceived as competitors for the
diminishing consumption space. Consumer dissatisfaction spills over into
increasing scepticism regarding the liberal democratic system -- an
institutional crisis is emerging (Kalke et al, 2024).

Politics

The global political situation has become volatile, with a group of
major powers struggling for dominance, while the majority of countries
tries to navigate the stormy waters in changing collaborations and
confrontations. **[[Trade wars]{.underline}]{.mark}** and patent
conflicts [[prevail]{.underline}]{.mark}; international
[regimes]{.underline} of intellectual property [rights]{.underline} have
[collapsed and **free trade**]{.underline} in resources [has come to a
virtual **standstill**]{.underline}. Armed conflicts are fueled by
geopolitics and upscaled by weapons export since 2025, [resource wars
increase]{.underline}, but in order to avoid nuclear escalation, the
major powers impose an allocation system for raw materials, with quotas
for all countries (which many consider a neocolonial means to deny
access to non-affiliate countries). [There are]{.underline} political
and [**armed conflicts** about access to increasingly short
fresh**water** supplies]{.underline}. The global [water **crisis** takes
its toll, **hunger** is]{.underline} getting
**[normalized]{.underline}** in many parts of the world, [due to
declining **harvests**]{.underline} due to heat stress and lack of
irrigation water.

Public pressure demands a 'Fortress' policy, denying climate refugees
access to the still relatively affluent countries -- a demand the strong
extreme right is more than happy to fulfil (nativism, economic fears,
and so on). Permanent involvement in resource wars and repulsion fights
against refugees at all borders leads to a militarizing of societies,
but also to a more favorable view on elements of a war economy. This,
together with the shortage of physical resources, has drastic political
consequences.

Domestically, in most European countries and beyond, politicians have
pulled the emergency brake and declared both a 'climate war' (mostly
neglecting other environmental problems) and 'identity defense'
(rejection not only of refugees, but all 'foreign' inhabitants -- at the
expense of lacking skills and workers in the labor force). As the
permanent resource constraints and the high cost of enforcing access
make it impossible to any longer ignore the problem of overconsumption,
decisionmakers try to find ways to accommodate the internationally set
resource quota. The limited materials are auctioned off nationally, with
special purchase rights for non-commercial users. This mechanism,
borrowed from war economics, leads to a massive restructuring of
industry, as high resource efficiency becomes a prerequisite for a
secured further existence. In order to limit overconsumption, those
consumer goods that have become scarce are given away on non-tradable
ration coupons. This ensures that scarce goods are available to all and
are not consumed or hoarded by a privileged few at the expense of the
general public.

2050

Rising temperature, rising sea levels, rising migration

The emergency measures introduced in 2040 have managed to prevent or at
least postpone the collapse otherwise due. Nevertheless, global
[[warming **surpasses**]{.underline}]{.mark} 2.5°C (that is,
[**[5°]{.mark}**C over land]{.underline}), triggered [[by]{.mark}
**tipping cascades** such as the [melting]{.mark} of
**[permafrost]{.mark}**]{.underline} regions since 2040, when the
conditions for their permanent existence were no longer given,
[[transforming]{.mark} large parts of [**Siberia**, Alaska]{.mark}
and]{.underline} northern [[**Canada** into]{.mark} barely usable,
greenhouse gas **[emitting swamps]{.mark}**]{.underline} (IPCC, 2021;
Fewster et al, 2022) [plagued by wildfires.
[Wetlands]{.mark}]{.underline} and moors [[are **drying**]{.mark}
**out**]{.underline} -- and thus [releasing]{.underline} additional
**[CO2]{.underline}**. Deadly [heat waves and
**[temp]{.mark}**]{.underline}erature[[**s** of over **50°**]{.mark}C
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} no longer un**[[common]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in the tropics, and temperate latitudes exceed 40°C in summer, causing
tens of thousands of heat deaths annually in Europe. In many regions in
the South, but also in European regions such as the Spanish highlands,
[[human life is **no longer** possible]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Anthropogenic [warming is casting **billions**]{.underline} of people
[outside of the **boundaries** of]{.underline} normal [human
**habitation**]{.underline}, with abundant negative consequences for
human wellbeing, mortality and levels of international migration
(Scheffer et al, 2024). [A **billion people** are facing]{.underline}
coastal [**flooding risk** from rising seas, and]{.underline} more
[people are forced out of their homes]{.underline} by weather disasters,
in particular flooding, sea level rise and tropical cyclones (Selby et
al, 2024). [Once **warming** exceeds a **few more tenths** of a degree,
it will lead to **large areas** becoming **uninhabitable**]{.underline}
(IPCC, 2022).

While most refugees stay in neighbouring countries until their
capacities are exhausted, many move to the North, only temporarily
stopped at the crumbling military border defence of the EU (less so, and
later, the United States). [Migration is **enhanced** by]{.underline}
the neocolonial economic policy of the dominant powers, with [militarily
supported **land-grabbing** where **fertile ground** and **water** are
available]{.underline} (for example, Ukraine) to overcome domestic food
supply volatility problems.

Freshwater scarcity

Heavy rainfall on land has increased by more than a third; summer
precipitation comes in the form of flash floods, which only partly seep
into the ground and replenish the groundwater available for dry periods.
Freshwater has become scarce and is part of the rationing system.
Private swimming pools, watering lawns or washing private cars have been
banned. Not least because of the melting of the last glaciers in the
Alps and the Andes/Rocky Mountains, river levels fluctuate extremely,
affecting both shipping and summer water supplies. More than 390 million
people are suffering from water scarcity, and their number is bound to
rise. [The [**thawing** of]{.mark} the **Himalayan** [glaciers]{.mark}
accelerates]{.underline} (they had lost 40 per cent of their area by
2020 \[Lee et al, 2021\]), [[putting]{.mark} the]{.underline} regular
[**[water]{.mark}** supply [of **two billion**]{.mark} people [at
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}, who depend on the waters of Indus, Ganges,
Brahmaputra, Irrawaddy, Mekong and Yangtzekiang (Wester et al, 2019).

[[Sea levels are **rising**]{.mark} **faster** than
expected]{.underline} and are approaching one metre. [**[Salt]{.mark}**
water **[penetrates]{.mark}** the groundwater [reservoirs
in]{.mark}]{.underline} coastal regions and [[all]{.mark} major
**[river]{.mark}**]{.underline} delta[[**s**,
putting]{.underline}]{.mark} some of [the **'bread baskets'** of the
[world at risk]{.mark}]{.underline} (for example, in Egypt, Vietnam,
India, Bangladesh, Argentina, the United States). The [**tidal flats**
and salt marshes]{.underline} along the North Sea and similar coastal
regions are under pressure -- where dikes are not moved back,
sacrificing land to the sea and allowing salt marshes to move inland,
they [are **flooded** and]{.underline} some of the most biologically
[diverse habitats]{.underline} on earth [are]{.underline} thus
**[lost]{.underline}** (Saintilan et al, 2022). The [[oceans
are]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [becoming]{.underline} warmer and
hence low-oxygen, but also [**more [acidic]{.mark}**[,
affecting]{.mark}]{.underline} countless [species along the [entire
**food**]{.mark} **chain**. [Shell]{.mark}-forming animal
[species]{.mark} are **dying out**, fish stocks]{.underline} -- until
2040 [a major protein source of humankind -- have more or less
**[collapsed]{.mark}** due to]{.underline} past overfishing, persistent
ocean pollution, **[acidification]{.underline}** and the loss of
breeding grounds (temperate salt marshes decline, coral reefs are gone).
Habitat for nearly 20 per cent of all insect species has at least
halved.

Food (in)security

[The **cultivation** of wheat]{.underline}, barley, rye, oats and maize
[is **hardly possible** anymore]{.underline} (wheat becomes sterile at
30°C, maize pollen at 35°C); agriculture has switched to millet/sorghum
and chickpeas instead of wheat, yams instead of potatoes, as well as
cassava/ manioc and sweet potatoes. Small [farmers have **not survived**
the crisis economically]{.underline}. In addition, [higher
**CO2**]{.underline} concentrations [**reduce** the quality of
**proteins**]{.underline} in cereals and fruits, and cows have to digest
more grass for the same milk yield.

The number of frost days has decreased sharply, in many years they no
longer occur -- a problem for food production from fruit trees,
vegetables and wheat. To these plants, prolonged cold exposure is
required to provide competency to flower (vernalisation). In other
years, non-moving polar air masses lead to weeks of deep low
temperatures, which do not suit many of the new, drought-resistant
agricultural plants. These are hot--cold times. Vegetation also feels
the effects: native tree species are not adapted to heat and drought,
but Mediterranean species are not adapted to the cold spells. As a
result, more than half of Europe's tree species are threatened with
extinction. Forest fires accelerate that -- burning areas in the
Mediterranean region have grown by more than 60 per cent.

Health

Areas suitable for malaria transmission have grown by 15 per cent.
Tropical disease vectors are well established, but tropical and emerging
pathogens are spreading mainly through transmission by indigenous
species; dengue, chika and West Nile fever are regular occurrences.
[[New **pathogens**]{.mark} have [emerged]{.mark} from **zoonoses**,
pandemics with previously unknown pathogens]{.underline} regularly claim
numerous victims worldwide -- [the 'age of pandemics']{.underline}, of
which IPBES had warned urgently, [has **dawned**]{.underline} (IPBES,
2020).

Alternative scenario for Europe (other regions unaffected)

Following the calculations of Ditlevsen and Ditlevsen (2023), the
AMOC/Gulf Stream warm water circulation would collapse between 2025 and
2095 with a central estimate of 2050 (assuming emissions are not
reduced, in line with our earlier assumptions). Such a collapse would
result in Western Europe suffering far more extreme winters, rapidly
rising sea levels on the east coast of the United States and a lack of
vital tropical rainfall. During the last ice age, some major changes in
AMOC flow caused winter temperatures to change by 5--10°C in just one to
three years. The chilling effect would be moderated by the heating that
has already occurred in the northern hemisphere (Spangenberg et al,
2012).

2070

[A **dystopian** situation has emerged: planetary boundaries continue to
be crossed, **tipping cascades** cause irreversible **damage** and have
escaped human control, ecosystem cycles **are collapsing**. The [loss of
**pollinators** reduces **food**]{.mark} availability]{.underline};
fermented substitutes are consumed instead. Desperate [attempts at
**[geoengineering]{.mark}** have not solved any problem, but
**[created]{.mark}** new]{.underline} damages and
**[[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The global heating has surpassed
+2.5°C and is heading for 3°C -- which implies 5--6°C heating over land
(IPCC, 2021). [All **coral reefs** and]{.underline} almost all large
[tropical **forests** have disappeared]{.underline}. The melting of the
Greenland ice sheet, the increasing loss of South Polar ice and of
almost all glaciers is driving up sea levels. [Coastal **cities** around
the world are]{.underline} being **[abandoned]{.underline}**, partly
because of direct flooding and ever stronger typhoons, partly [because
infrastructures **cannot** withstand rising **sea levels** despite high
dikes]{.underline}. Life expectancy is decreasing, and water and food
supply has become unreliable, even in the richest parts of the world.

For two billion people, [[survival]{.underline}]{.mark} in their
homeland [[is **no longer possible**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- flight or
death is the alternative as a result of heat, drought, lost soil
fertility or as a result of flooding and salinisation. As neighbouring
countries and regions can no longer absorb the refugees -- they are
already overburdened and suffer just as much from climate and
environmental destruction -- [a global **migration** of more than **one
billion** of people has **set in**]{.underline}, upsetting all previous
geopolitical power constellations. [Countries are at **permanent war**
to uphold the]{.underline} neocolonial [status quo, but the [threat of
**nuclear escalation** is growing]{.mark}]{.underline} by the day. The
mood of migrants is not only desperate, but also aggressive: those
affected are well aware that they are innocent victims of the North's
overconsumption. Already in 2020, the richest 10 per cent of humanity
(that is, all those with an annual income of over US\$90,000) emitted
almost half of all CO2 emissions, while the poorer half of the world's
population was only responsible for 12 per cent (Herrmann, 2022). Such
facts have been sinking into the collective consciousness and attitudes.
The Global North has been stealing the future as well as the present,
not only from its own children but, above all, from those who live in
the most affected parts of the world. The EU and the United States are
losing their defensive wars against migrants, and their militarised
societies fail to adapt to the inflow of refugees. The result of the
conflict is unpredictable, but will certainly be paid for with high
human sacrifices.

In temperate latitudes, landscapes are dotted with wind turbines and
solar panels; there are also a few trees, but only a few species that
have adapted to climate change and water scarcity. Lush greenery,
buzzing insects, singing birds -- absent. [The **planet** has become
**silent**]{.underline} -- 90 years after Rachel Carson's Silent Spring.

###  IRA Cuts Turn\-\--1AR

#### OBBB [fully repeals]{.underline} IRA subsidies

**Altus 25**, Associate Editor for Fox Business (Kristen, 5/22,
"Taxpayer alert: The 'dire\' consequences of green tax credits and why
it 'dooms' America's future", Fox Business,
https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/taxpayer-alert-dire-consequences-green-tax-credits-why-dooms-americas-future)

House [[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} are currently split as some
lawmakers [[want]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[subsidies fully
repealed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and others want some credits to remain
intact -- all while working on a massive piece of legislation advancing
President Donald Trump\'s agenda on taxes, border security, national
defense and also raising the debt limit.

[[Hoffman]{.mark} [urges]{.mark} [Republicans]{.mark} to [repeal the IRA
subsidies]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[in their
entirety]{.underline}**]{.mark}, citing a recent nonpartisan report from
The Cato Institute that the subsidies could cost taxpayers \$4.7
trillion by 2050, but would save \$1 trillion if acted on during this
reconciliation period.

\"With the nature of green subsidies, the government is going to be
awarding and can issue these tax credits with no limits because there\'s
no deadline or expiration or termination set to this,\" Hoffman
explained. \"The government is going to spend more in perpetuity... That
is why you\'re seeing this ballooning of costs well above the projected
estimates from 2022, and it\'s going to continue to spiral up.\"

\"Taxpayers are going to feel the brunt of these green subsidies if
they\'re not repealed,\" the energy expert added, also noting that the
IRA has produced \"negligible\" results in job creation and intended
emissions reductions.

\"At best, \[the New Green Deal is\] only going to reduce emissions by
0.2 degrees Celsius and have about \$7 trillion in economic destruction,
and about a million jobs displaced from the workforce,\" Hoffman said.
\"A pretty low return on investment or a pretty big economic toll, so
that is what we can anticipate.\"

[[Budget reconciliation is the \"ideal\"]{.underline} **[time to
act]{.underline}**]{.mark}, according to Hoffman, as it will only become
more difficult down the road with a potential partisan shakeup in the
2026 midterm elections.

\"This process is the perfect time to repeal green subsidies and perhaps
recoup those monies, potentially a trillion dollars, to fund other
priorities like making tax cuts permanent and seeing those monies go to
better use,\" she said.

[[Thirty-eight]{.underline}]{.mark} House
[[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} have **[[signed off on their]{.mark}
[support]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [the full repeal]{.mark} of IRA
subsidies]{.underline}**. But, top GOP leaders like Sen. Shelley Moore
Capito and Sen. Kevin Cramer say the pitch goes too far and could harm
the deployment of other new energy technologies.

[2024]{.underline} was Earth's warmest on record. Not only did it
eclipse 2023's record high, but it [exceeded]{.underline} the [2015
Paris threshold of **1.5°C**]{.underline} above preindustrial levels for
the first time. The data --- including proxy records like tree rings and
ice cores --- show that 2024 was likely the hottest of the past 125,000
years. [Multiple global records were broken for]{.underline} greenhouse
gas levels, [air temperature, and sea surface temperature]{.underline}.

The ugly reality is this: While individual years are not to be taken as
proof of anything, the long-term trend is toward even more rapid
warming.

The **[L]{.underline}**os **[A]{.underline}**ngeles [wildfires are **not
exceptional**]{.underline}. Among the most data recorded during 2024 was
an unusually high amount of atmospheric water vapor, about 5% above the
1991--2020 average. [[Extreme **heat** and]{.mark} high [**humidity**
are]{.mark} a [deadly]{.mark} combination]{.underline}. They shift rain
and locations suitable for agricultural production and contribute to
extreme precipitation events and rapidly intensified tropical cyclones
like hurricanes Helene and Milton.

For reasons climate scientists don't yet fully understand, the [rate of
[change]{.mark} has [increased **faster than**]{.mark}]{.underline}
previously **[[anticipated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is possible that
[global **[tipping points]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as the shutdown
of major ocean currents, [[are **closer**]{.mark} than we]{.underline}
once [thought]{.underline}. According to the Copernicus Global Climate
Survey, an agency of the European Commission, each year in the last
decade has been one of the 10 hottest on record. Data from U.S. centers,
NOAA and NASA, show similar results.

Global temperatures are rising beyond what modern humans have ever
experienced. 2024 didn't feature 2023's planet-warming El Niño event on
top of human-caused climate change, yet it still managed to eclipse the
previous year on the list of the hottest. The [oceans have become a
**heat sink**]{.underline}, reaching never-before-seen levels.

In 2023, ex-NASA scientist James Hansen published a meta-analysis.
Hansen famously and accurately warned in 1988 that human-caused warming
would soon emerge from the background noise of natural variability. The
paper's authors concluded that the planet would witness more severe
extreme weather events, species losses, and sea level rise than had
previously been projected.

A [new study]{.underline} has [found]{.underline} that [scientists may
have **underestimated**]{.underline} the [amount of melting
on]{.underline} the [Greenland Ice Sheet]{.underline} since 1985 by as
much as 20%. This melting is the most significant contributor to the
rise of the global sea level. Today's data indicates that the rate of
ice retreat stayed steady until the 1990s, with a faster loss rate since
2000. Given the new numbers, more freshwater has entered the North
Atlantic Ocean since 1985 than previously known. This [would
explain]{.underline} some of the [observed **weakening** in the
vital]{.underline} Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation
[(**AMOC**)]{.underline}, which includes the Gulf Stream. We don't know
the 'tipping point' that [could trigger]{.underline} a [full-scale
collapse of]{.underline} the [AMOC]{.underline}. However, [we
are]{.underline} already [[beginning to see]{.underline}]{.mark} some of
the **[[geopolitical consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Remember that the shifting currents in the atmosphere and seas also mean
greater extremes of cold and blizzard conditions. The winds and dry
season combined to create the Los Angeles wildfires are the same winds,
now with a moist atmosphere, that dumped blizzards on New Orleans,
Houston, and Tallahassee.

This is [not simply a disaster for **homeowners**]{.underline} in Los
Angeles and Miami. [**[Entire countries]{.mark}** are [at risk of
disappearing.]{.mark} **Military** operations]{.underline} will have to
take the new planning into account. The [**world economy** will suffer
shifts]{.underline} that will help some players but harm most of them.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is suffering a [[collapse of permafrost,
threatening **oil**]{.underline}]{.mark} production. [[China is already
importing most of its food]{.underline}]{.mark} to survive. [Bangladesh
**may not survive**]{.underline}. And places like [[Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, already inhospitable and dependent on oil
as a source of revenue, are [stuck in a situation where]{.underline}
their [**long-term [survival]{.mark}** [depends on]{.mark}
finding]{.underline} some [way to manage]{.underline} the [transition
to]{.underline} a [[low-carbon]{.underline}]{.mark} world economy while
investing in projects enabling its population to live.

Geopolitics and climate change

Geopolitics and climate change are related in three dimensions. First,
[climate]{.underline} change [impacts]{.underline} the [military,
economic, and political realities]{.underline}, constraining state and
nonstate action. Second, the choices made by states and nonstate actors
influence the future patterns of climate change. Third, the changing
climate\'s political, economic, and military interaction effects will
lead to emergent outcomes we can only guess at. Together, these are too
much for a single essay. Books are being written, and I'll turn to the
second and third dimensions later. For now, I'll start with the most
obvious topic: climate change and geopolitics.

Let's start with the military. Consider the poor infantryman. In the
best of circumstances, he's digging holes and trying to stay alive while
people he doesn't know are doing their best to kill him. Now add the
effects of weather. Any Vietnam veteran will tell you stories about the
impact of fighting in jungles and mud. Any veteran of Iraq will tell you
about combat in desert conditions. He has to plan for both
simultaneously as the climate swings between extremes.

Although it has rarely been given the attention it deserves in military
history, the specific qualities of mud on the battlefield have
determined the outcome of critical battles throughout history. Napoleon
delayed his attack at Waterloo a day to allow the mud to dry. In 1942,
Russian mud stopped the German advance, which had to pause until the
ground had frozen. Evidence from the American Civil War to Ukraine shows
that all muds are not equal; they exhibit different qualities of
slipperiness and stickiness, affecting military vehicles and weapons in
unpredictable ways.

On a larger scale, [everything from **[monsoons]{.mark}** to [**growing
seasons** and **ag**]{.mark}]{.underline}ricultural [[**regions**
changes as]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[climate
shifts]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Military operations]{.underline} will [become easier for **some** and
more difficult for **others**[. Climate]{.mark} change stands to
**[profoundly challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[U.S. **nuclear
deterrent**. Sea level]{.mark} rise, [extreme
weather]{.mark}]{.underline} events, [and [warming]{.mark}
temperatures]{.underline} can be [expected to [have **mission-altering**
impacts on deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Climate change challenges bases hosting U.S. nuclear
weapons]{.underline} overseas. As part of its extended deterrence
policy, the U.S. forward deploys an estimated one hundred warheads for
dual-capable aircraft (DCA) at six air bases in Belgium, Germany, Italy,
the Netherlands, and Türkiye.

[Flash flooding, wildfires]{.underline}, and [extreme heat
threaten]{.underline} the **[infra]{.underline}**structure and personnel
[supporting]{.underline} the [DCA mission. [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}
claims to be constantly on guard against "technological and
geo-strategic evolutions," but it [has been [reluctant to
acknowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[vulnerability]{.mark}
of]{.underline} the [alliance's **nuclear assets** to climate
change]{.underline}.

A [2019 flood at Incirlik]{.underline} Air [Base in Türkiye]{.underline}
--- the only base in Türkiye that hosts U.S. nuclear weapons (but not
DCA )--- illustrates how flash [flooding can overload]{.underline} a
[base's drainage system]{.underline}. There are no reports of the
on-base vaults storing U.S. nuclear weapons being affected. However, it
is conceivable that [underground facilities could suffer damage during
particularly]{.underline} severe [floods]{.underline} in the future.

[Even]{.underline} a [**modest increase** in annual
rainfall]{.underline} can [increase]{.underline} the likelihood of a
[flash flood]{.underline}. As the mean moves, the extremes are becoming
more extreme. Even a base relatively insulated from sea level
rise---like Vokel in the Netherlands---is vulnerable to flash flooding.
In a worst-case scenario, [[flooding]{.mark} would
[inundate]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[base's **only runway**]{.mark},
requiring]{.underline} aircraft **[evacuation]{.underline}** or forcible
grounding, much like the incident at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska
in 2019. Because Volkel is a DCA base, a [flooded runway]{.underline}
could [[mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [**[nuc]{.mark}**lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} stored there **[may [not]{.mark} be
[deployable]{.mark}]{.underline}**: even if the weapons could be loaded,
the aircraft might not be able to take off.

These issues are compounded if flash flooding prevents critical
personnel from accessing the base, a plausible scenario since personnel
at Volkel live off base. Two other storage sites --- Büchel Air Force
Base (Germany) and Kleine Brogel Air Force Base (Belgium) --- face a
similar problem.

Wildfires can also undermine a base's ability to perform its mission.
[U.S. **[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** stored in
[underground]{.mark} vaults [would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
[[be]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively [**insulated**, even if rendered
**[inaccessible]{.mark}**, but personnel and aircraft would need to be
evacuated. Operations would be severely disrupted]{.underline}.

[Extreme [temperatures]{.mark}]{.underline} are projected to be
especially pronounced in Southern Europe, impacting Italy\'s Aviano and
Ghedi Air Bases. Even on a "good" day, warmer, less dense air makes it
harder for aircraft to generate lift, posing problems for takeoff and
landing. This [[reduces]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[aircraft's
**fuel**]{.mark} or payload [capacity]{.mark}, with implications
for]{.underline} the **[duration and scope of operations]{.underline}**.
These [warmer temperatures]{.underline} also [cause]{.underline}
additional [wear and tear]{.underline}, such as the damage caused by
overheated engines.

Europe is but one area of operation. America is a global power, and
similar problems are found in regions worldwide.

Climate change shapes borders

On a larger scale, [[climate change]{.mark} is]{.underline} already
**[[reshaping]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[borders]{.mark} of the globe.
Rising seas are threatening to **remove**]{.underline} the [states
of]{.underline} the [Pacific and]{.underline} threaten the [seacoasts of
most]{.underline} of the planet.

Malé, the capital of [the **Maldives**]{.underline}, already has coastal
defenses in place. The country, composed of nearly 1,200 small coral
islands and home to around 540,000 people, [is the flattest country on
Earth]{.underline}, with an average elevation of just 3 feet (1 meter).
Should the sea level rise by another 18 inches (45 cm), [it will
lose]{.underline} around [**77%** of its land]{.underline} area.

[Kiribati]{.underline}, a small island in the heart of the Pacific with
a population of nearly 120,000, [could lose **two-thirds** of its
land]{.underline} if sea levels rise by three feet. Around [[**3
million** Pacific islanders]{.underline}]{.mark} live within 6.2 miles
(10 km) of the coast, and many [[must relocate]{.underline}]{.mark}
before the end of the century.

We have already witnessed the disappearance of at least five "vegetated
reef islands" previously part of the Solomon Islands and "a further six
islands experiencing severe shoreline recession." Three communities in
the Solomons have been relocated so far. And recall that the rise in sea
level has been accelerating since 1994.

But it's [not merely islands]{.underline} that are [at
risk]{.underline}. About [[**fifteen percent** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[world's population]{.mark} lives within **5
kilometers**]{.underline} (3.1 miles) [of]{.underline} the
[sea]{.underline}.

[Jakarta]{.underline}, the capital of Indonesia, [is]{.underline} home
to around 10 million people and has been dubbed [the "**fastest-sinking
city** in the world]{.underline}" by the BBC. Between rising sea levels
and "excessive groundwater drainage," it sinks by 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10
cm) each year. According to the World Economic Forum, much of Jakarta
could be underwater by 2050. Jakarta's situation is so dire that
[Indonesia is attempting to **replace**]{.underline} it as Indonesia's
[capital with Nusantara]{.underline}, a city under construction on the
east coast of Borneo, 1,200 miles away.

Jakarta is far from the only city with an uncertain future. The World
Economic Forum reports that by the end of the century, [Dhaka,
Bangladesh]{.underline} (population 22.4 million); [Lagos,
Nigeria]{.underline} (population 15.3 million); [and Bangkok,
Thailand]{.underline} (population 9 million) [could]{.underline} also
[be **entirely drowned** or have **vast tracts** of land
underwater]{.underline} and unusable.

Every country with seacoast cities (the vast majority of them) will have
to adjust. The [[country where]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[most]{.mark}
people [will be affected]{.mark} by sea level change [is
**China**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with 43 million people living in
precarious coastal locations. According to the European Union-funded
Life Adaptate project, India has 27 million people in similar
conditions.

America is not immune. Recent projections show that [many U.S. cities
will face **serious issues**]{.underline} by 2050, potentially
[rendering vast swathes of land **unlivable**]{.underline}. According to
NOAA, "in many locations along the U.S. coastline, high tide flooding is
now 300% to more than 900% more frequent than it was 50 years ago."

The single American [city most at risk may be **N**]{.underline}ew
**[Y]{.underline}**ork **[C]{.underline}**ity, according to research
from Climate Central. They report that by 2050, nearly half a million
(426,000) New Yorkers will be living on "threatened land." New York's
vulnerability to flooding was seen clearly in 2012 when Hurricane Sandy
heavily impacted the city. At least 43 people in the city died as a
result of the superstorm. Around a quarter of a million vehicles were
destroyed, part of at least \$32 billion worth of "damage and loss,"
according to then-Governor Andrew Cuomo. If we look at all the counties
in New York and New Jersey that were declared disaster areas by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Commerce Department
concluded tens of billions of dollars of impact (and over 100,000
unemployed) from the storm, requiring years to repair.

As for the American state most susceptible to flooding, [Florida
will]{.underline} surely [be hit hardest]{.underline}. According to
Climate Central's research, 36 of the 50 U.S. cities most vulnerable to
coastal flooding are in Florida. Last year, at least fifteen people
died, and hundreds were rescued in Hurricane Milton. This is just a
foretaste of things to come.

Officials do all they can, but in conditions like these, there is little
to do but pick up the pieces. Preparation is key---and so far, it hasn't
happened.

The environment creates conflict

[As weather patterns shift, [new points of **conflict** emerge]{.mark}.
Interpersonal conflict **increases** with temperature]{.underline}, with
a 1-degree increase in temperature raising interpersonal conflict by 2.4
percent and intergroup conflict by 11.3 percent. [[Water scarcity will
**increase**]{.mark}. Pressures for resources will encourage
**deforestation**, which will lead to erosion and a loss of]{.underline}
land. The [oceans will suffer from **over-fishing** even as]{.underline}
the [rising heat and dropping **oxygen** levels make it more difficult
to maintain stocks. [Displaced people **cross borders**]{.mark},
searching for]{.underline} a [place to survive, [forcing **tough
choices** on]{.mark} more fortunate [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

A key factor in determining whether a city or country will disappear is
not necessarily the rise in sea level but rather the city or country's
capacity to address the problem and develop defenses. [Countries that
can **afford**]{.underline} to invest in [infrastructure, like the
Netherlands, might **avoid**]{.underline} many of the effects of
[flooding]{.underline}. The United States may be able to invest in
coastal protection projects in some spots and learn via trial and error.
[Most developing nations **don't have that luxury**]{.underline}.

Countries that refuse to admit what is happening are no better off than
countries that can do nothing about it. In the United States, the
response to global climate change is wrapped in partisan politics.
President Trump recently abandoned the Paris Climate Accords, choosing
to "drill, baby, drill" for the carbon-rich fuels responsible for the
crisis. Expect the United States (and the world) to suffer accordingly.

**[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark}** countries [may [think there is a **good
side**]{.mark} to]{.underline} a [climate catastrophe. [They are
**wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the [Northwest Passage
remained a **dream** for generations]{.underline} before the retreat of
the Arctic ice pack made it practical in 2009. [Now, it is open several
months of]{.underline} the [year]{.underline}.

Although [**Russia** will lose **oil production** as permafrost
melts]{.underline}, the opening of the Northeast Passage in Russian
waters a few months each year promises to connect the relatively
landlocked country to world trade. Unfortunately, [[Russia **cannot
control**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [straights blocking [Atlantic and
Pacific access]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If anything, the [retreating ice makes controlling]{.underline} those
[access points **more critical**, with obvious]{.underline} economic and
[military implications]{.underline}. In the best of circumstances,
assuming access to the outside world, a [large fleet of
**[icebreakers]{.mark}** will continue to be [necessary to
keep]{.mark}]{.underline} these [[shipping lanes]{.mark}
**operational**]{.underline} for the few months they are possible.
**[[Nobody has them]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Arctic may eventually be
open to navigation year-round --- in fifty years. If the Chinese want a
quick connection to Europe, they must wait.

In addition, [there are **no port facilities** along those
lanes]{.underline}, and there will not be any for the foreseeable
future. Construction on melting permafrost is a nightmare. No
transportation networks exist to support the ports, even if ports could
be constructed. Any roads and trains will face the same problems as the
ports, multiplied by the thousands of miles they must maintain.

And [there is a]{.underline} more [**immediate problem**, especially for
Russia. **Ag**]{.underline}riculture [is life. [Every country is **one
bad growing season away** from **starvation**]{.mark}. In a global
system]{.underline}, with international transport, [that can be
**managed**]{.underline}. Marginal lands can be supplemented with
fertilizers. Outside production can cover local failure. [**However**,
as]{.underline} the [**global system** falls apart, some]{.underline}
countries [will feel]{.underline} the [pain first. One reason [Russia
**invaded Ukraine**]{.mark} was [to occupy its]{.mark}]{.underline} rich
**[[farmlands]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and it is selling seized grain
today. We've seen how well that's gone for them.

After innovations in plant nutrition in the 19th century, an
agricultural industry developed around synthetically created
agrochemical fertilizers. This transition transformed the global food
system, allowing for larger-scale industrial agriculture. Central to the
system is wheat.

Wheat is the world\'s staple crop. It grows anywhere, even in marginal
lands, if you dump enough fertilizer on them. [Regions in the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and Europe are
**already suffering** from]{.underline} the [environmental effects of
overfertilization]{.underline}. Still, they can maintain production on
their land and have begun to reverse their dependency. Around the world,
most of this fertilizer comes from North America. And today, three
countries depend most on this imported fertilizer to produce wheat on
their marginal farmlands: Kazakhstan, Russia, and China.

[As]{.underline} the [ice retreats, new resources will become available
--- **slowly**. Between]{.underline} the problems of access,
transportation, and processing, this may be relevant in a century, but
not before. We have to get through the transition without them. Expect
famine long before these resources arrive.

[[Famine makes countries **desperate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[desperate countries do **stupid things**[. No country will
escape]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**political** and **economic**
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In short, as this audience already knows, [climate change is real. The
geopolitical effects are **real**]{.underline}. They aren't pretty. They
are going to get a lot worse. And they are rushing towards us now.

## ANSWER TO NEG IMPACTS

### AT Growth Impact\-\--2AC

#### Bill doesn't solve growth

**Luhby 25**, Senior Writer for CNN. (Tami, 6/17, "Trump is counting on
economic growth to offset tax cuts. But his 'big, beautiful bill' likely
wouldn't deliver, experts say", CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/17/politics/big-beautiful-bill-tax-cuts)

According to the right-leaning Tax Foundation, the tax provisions in the
House-approved bill would boost the economy 0.8% over about three
decades -- compared to its estimate of 1.7% for the 2017 bill.
[Increased revenue from economic growth would offset about 22% of the
current bill's tax cuts.]{.underline}

Still, [[the package]{.underline}]{.mark} would [**[increase]{.mark}**
the federal [budget **deficit by \$1.7 trillion**]{.mark} over 10
years]{.underline}, even taking its roughly \$1.5 trillion in spending
cuts into account.

"We look at the bill and kind of shrug our shoulders and say, 'You could
have done better on growth'," said Daniel Bunn, the foundation's
president.

[[Similarly]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[Penn Wharton Budget
Model]{.underline}]{.mark} [[forecasts]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
overall House [bill would give a 0.4%]{.underline} [boost]{.underline}
to the economy by 2034, [but]{.underline} the **[[deficit would grow by
\$3.2 trillion]{.underline}]{.mark}** over that period. Penn Wharton
estimates that the [deficit [impact]{.mark} [would increase]{.mark} when
[taking]{.mark} the [economic]{.mark} [effects]{.mark} into]{.underline}
[account]{.underline} [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} some
[[lower-income]{.mark} [households]{.mark} would [reduce]{.mark} their
[hours]{.mark} worked]{.underline} [[to requalify for]{.underline}
[Medicaid]{.underline}]{.mark} coverage and some higher-income people
would work less because of their gains from the bill's tax breaks.

The Trump administration argues that these independent analyses are
wrong.

"So called 'experts' panning The One, Big, Beautiful Bill, without a
smidge of self-awareness, should remember that they made these same
exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his
first term," Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said in a statement to
CNN, adding that the TCJA "helped usher in historic job, wage,
investment, and economic growth."

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} [[C]{.mark}ongressional [B]{.mark}udget
[O]{.mark}ffice [said]{.mark}]{.underline} Tuesday that the [House
[package would increase]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[deficit]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} \$**[[2.8
trillion]{.underline}]{.mark}** between 2025 and 2034, after taking the
economic effects into account. That compares to a separate CBO forecast
that the bill would raise the deficit by \$2.4 trillion over a decade,
not accounting for economic growth.

[[While]{.mark} the [bill's tax]{.mark} and spending [provisions]{.mark}
would [result in]{.mark} an additional \$[124
billion]{.mark}]{.underline} in revenue from economic growth,
**[[it]{.mark} would also [increase interest costs by \$441
billion]{.mark}]{.underline}** because interest rates would be higher,
the CBO

found.

#### No correlation between economic decline and war. 

**Walt 20**, PhD, Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international
relations at Harvard University. (Stephen M., 5-13-2020, "Will a Global
Depression Trigger Another World War?", *Foreign Policy*,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/)

On balance, however, [[I do not think]{.mark} that
[even]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[extraordinary economic
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}** we are witnessing today are going to
[[have **much impact** on]{.mark} the **likelihood of
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Why? First of all, [if depressions were a
powerful cause of war, there would be a lot more of the
latter.]{.underline} To take one example, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has suffered
**40**]{.underline}]{.mark} or more
[**[recessions]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the country was founded,
[[yet]{.mark} it has [fought]{.mark} perhaps **[20]{.mark}** interstate
[wars]{.mark}, most of them **[unrelated to]{.mark} the state of [the
econ]{.mark}**]{.underline}omy[.]{.underline} To paraphrase the
economist Paul Samuelson's famous quip about the stock market, [[if
recessions]{.mark} were a **powerful [cause]{.mark} of [war]{.mark}**,
[they would have predicted]{.mark} "**[nine]{.mark}**]{.underline} out
[**[of the last five]{.mark}** (or fewer)."]{.underline}\
Second, [[states **do not start wars** unless they believe they will win
a **quick** and]{.underline}]{.mark} relatively **[[cheap
victory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As John Mearsheimer showed in his
classic book Conventional Deterrence, [national leaders **avoid** war
when they are convinced it will be long, bloody, costly, and
uncertain]{.underline}. To choose war, political leaders have to
convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap, and decisive
victory or achieve some limited objective at low cost. [Europe went to
war in 1914 with each side believing it would win a rapid and easy
victory]{.underline}, and Nazi Germany developed the strategy of
blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes as quickly and cheaply as
possible. [Iraq attacked Iran in 1980 because Saddam believed the
Islamic Republic was in disarray and would be easy to
defeat]{.underline}, and George W. [Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 convinced
the war would be short, successful, and pay for itself.]{.underline}

[The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: **No matter** what a country's **economic condition**
might be, its leaders **will not go to war** unless they think they can
do so **quickly, cheaply**, and with a **reasonable probability of
success**]{.underline}.

Third, and most important, [[the]{.mark} primary [**motivation**
for]{.mark} most [wars is]{.mark} the desire for **[security]{.mark}**,
[not **economic gain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For this reason, the odds
of war increase when states believe the long-term balance of power may
be shifting against them, when they are convinced that adversaries are
unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and when they are
confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and establish a secure
position if they act now. The historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed that
"[every war between Great Powers]{.underline} \[between 1848 and 1918\]
... [started as a preventive war, not as a war of
conquest]{.underline}," and [that remains true]{.underline} of most wars
fought since then.

The bottom line: **[[Economic conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}** (i.e., a
depression) may affect the broader political environment in which
decisions for war or peace are made, but they [[are]{.mark} only [**one
factor among many** and **rarely** the most
significant]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if the COVID-19 pandemic has
large, lasting, and negative effects on the world economy---as seems
quite likely---it is not likely to affect the probability of war very
much, especially in the short term.

#### Tax cuts don't promote innovation

**Blankenship 19**, Director of Cooperate Media Relations and Associate
Editor at FiercePharma (Kyle, 4/15, "J&J, Merck and Pfizer spent tax
savings on investor payouts, not R&D: Oxfam "Fierce Pharma,

The [[Tax Cuts]{.underline}]{.mark} and Jobs Act, a signature piece of
legislation from President Donald Trump in 2017, has been a windfall for
big business. It was supposed to be a job-creation and investment
engine, too. [But top drugmakers [channeled most of their savings to
investors, **not R&D**]{.mark} or price cuts.]{.underline}

Four [[pharma companies]{.underline}]{.mark}---Johnson & Johnson, Merck,
Pfizer and Abbott Laboratories---[reaped a combined \$7 billion in
savings]{.underline} from two provisions in the tax bill, according to a
recent Oxfam report (PDF), **[and they [plowed that money into stock
buybacks]{.mark} and dividends.]{.underline}**

"[[Despite promises that tax cuts]{.underline} [would bring billions
back onshore]{.underline}]{.mark} [and create jobs,]{.underline}
**[[drug companies are still dodging]{.mark} their
[taxes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, still charging sky-high prices
[[and]{.mark} still [paying off]{.mark} their [wealthy
executives]{.mark}]{.underline} and shareholders **[[instead of
boosting]{.mark} [investments]{.mark} in life-saving research and
development to lower drug costs,"]{.underline}** said Paul O'Brien, vice
president of policy and campaigns at Oxfam America, in a release.

Pharma companies benefited from the tax bill\'s cut to statutory tax
rates---to 21% from 35%---and rebates on previously untaxed offshore
earnings. Among the companies Oxfam examined, the single biggest
beneficiary was J&J, which received a reported \$2.48 billion in
combined tax breaks in 2018, equivalent to about 13.8% of the company's
profits.

Merck---which enjoyed a \$1.22 billion tax break in 2018 by Oxfam\'s
count---said it used its savings to reinvest in R&D. The company spent
\$10 billion last year on drug research and development, and it plans to
put \$16 billion toward capital investments over the next five years,
the company said in an emailed statement.

"[The [enactment of the U.S. tax legislation]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[enabled]{.mark} [Merck to deploy capital]{.mark} in]{.underline}
support of our [strategy [to invent]{.mark} new medicines]{.underline}
that address key unmet medical needs, ultimately benefiting patients,"
Merck said, adding that the planned investments will help Merck stay on
\"the cutting edge of science and meet growing demand for our human and
animal health medicines and vaccines." 

**[[But Merck's R&D spending]{.mark} last year [wasn\'t]{.mark} much
[different]{.mark}]{.underline}** from its budgets in recent years.
The company\'s R&D costs have hovered at around \$10 billion a year
since 2016. But payouts to investors jumped to about \$14.26 billion
last year from just over \$9 billion in 2017, Oxfam noted.

**[[Pfizer increased]{.mark} its investor [payouts even
more]{.mark}]{.underline}**, though. The company boosted its buybacks
and dividends by a whopping \$7.5 billion in 2018, bringing its total to
more than \$20 billion. The same year, Pfizer spent less than half that
amount, \$8 billion, on R&D. The company did not respond to a request
for comment by press time.

In the meantime, I want to give some initial reasons for skepticism
about existential biorisk. That is not to say that the bulk of the case
against existential biorisk rests on these reasons for skepticism -- it
rests, instead, on the inability of effective altruists to provide
plausible arguments in support of their risk estimates. But it does seem
appropriate to begin by saying why [[**many are skeptical** of
existential biorisk]{.underline}]{.mark} claims.

3\. The difficulty of the problem

The main reason why scientists and policymakers are skeptical of
existential biorisk is that [it is terribly hard to engineer a pandemic
that kills **everyone**]{.underline}.

First, [[you would need to reach **everyone**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
virus would have to be transmitted to the most **rural** and **isolated
corners**]{.underline} of the earth; to
**[[antarctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** research
**[[stations]{.underline}]{.mark}**; to [**[ships]{.mark}** at
sea]{.underline}, [including **[nuclear
sub]{.mark}**]{.underline}marine**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
uncharted, long-term and isolated paths; to [**doomsday
[preppers]{.mark}** in]{.underline} their **[bunkers]{.underline}**; to
hermits and **[[uncontacted tribes]{.underline}]{.mark}**; to
[**[astronauts]{.mark}** in space]{.underline}; to each new child born
every second; [to **island** nations]{.underline}; and so on. And you
would need a transmission mechanism that could spread the virus this far
without being detected: otherwise, [those with the means would be
**whisked away** to safety]{.underline} and might well survive.

Second, [[you would need a virus that was]{.mark} **virtually
[undetectable]{.mark}** until **all**]{.underline}, or [nearly all
humans had **been infected**]{.underline}. That conflicts in a stark way
with the goal of producing a virus that is 100% lethal, since lethal
viruses tend to leave a trace as they spread through a population.

Third, [you would need a virus that is **unprecedentedly
infectious**]{.underline}. [[The virus would need to be]{.mark} capable
of being **[transmitted]{.mark}**, **without fail**]{.underline}, [[to
**every human**]{.underline}]{.mark} being [[on the
**planet**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in sufficient quantities to actually
make them sick. [It would need to [avoid
**respirators**]{.mark}]{.underline} and other forms of protective
equipment. [[And]{.mark} it would have to [maintain]{.mark} its
[transmissibility through]{.mark}out many generations]{.underline} of
**[[mutation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Fourth, [you would need a virus that is **unprecedentedly
lethal**]{.underline}, [[killing not]{.underline}]{.mark} 90%,
**[[99%]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or 99.999% [[but]{.underline}]{.mark}
effectively **[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** of those infected by it, [[no
matter their]{.mark} age, health, or **[genetic
makeup]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This lethality would need to be preserved
even against the best medical treatments, including quite possibly
vaccines or synthesized antibodies. And it would have to be maintained
throughout many generations of mutation despite selective pressures
towards less lethal variants.

Fifth, [[you would need to]{.underline}]{.mark} find a way to
[[evade]{.mark} **basic public health measures** such as masking and
**social [distancing]{.mark}**. This isn't as easy as it sounds. [How do
you transmit a virus to someone who **doesn't leave their
house**?]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Tax reductions don't promote innovation

**Bell et al 19**, Assistant Professor of Economics at Georgia State
University (Alexander M. Bell, Raj Chetty, Xavier Javarel, Neviana
Petkova, John Van Reenan, January, "Do Tax Cuts Produce More Einsteins?
The Impacts of Financial Incentives vs. Exposure to Innovation on the
Supply of Inventors", NBER,
https://www.nber.org/papers/w25493?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Many [countries provide [financial incentives]{.mark}]{.underline} to
spur innovation, ranging from tax incentives to research and development
grants. In this paper, we study how such financial incentives affect
individuals\' decisions to pursue careers in innovation. We first
present empirical evidence on inventors\' career trajectories and income
distributions using de-identified data on 1.2 million inventors from
patent records linked to tax records in the U.S. We find [that the
private returns [to]{.mark} [innovation are extremely
skewed]{.mark}]{.underline} -- with the to[p 1% of inventors collecting
more than 22% of total inventors\' income]{.underline} -- and are highly
correlated with their social impact, as measured by citations. Inventors
tend to have their most impactful innovations around age 40 and their
incomes rise rapidly just before they have high-impact patents. We then
build a stylized model of inventor career choice that matches these
facts as well as recent evidence that childhood exposure to innovation
plays a critical role in determining whether individuals become
inventors. The model predicts that [financial incentives, such as top
income [tax reductions,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[have limited
potential]{.underline}** [to increase aggregate innovation because
they]{.underline}]{.mark} only affect individuals who are exposed to
innovation and [[have no impact on the decisions of star inventors, who
matter most for aggregate innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Importantly,
[[these results hold regardless of whether the private returns to
innovation are known]{.mark} at the time]{.underline} of career choice.
In contrast, increasing exposure to innovation (e.g., through mentorship
programs) could have substantial impacts on innovation by drawing
individuals who produce high-impact inventions into the innovation
pipeline. Although we do not present direct evidence supporting these
model-based predictions, our results call for a more careful assessment
of the impacts of financial incentives and a greater focus on
alternative policies to increase the supply of inventors.
