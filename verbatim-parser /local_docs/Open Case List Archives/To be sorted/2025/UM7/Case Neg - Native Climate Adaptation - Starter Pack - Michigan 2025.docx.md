# Native Climate Adaptation Neg

### Notes

A reasonable 1nc:

\--colonialism K

\--China DA

\--energy assistance DA

\--politics DA

\--Alaska CP

The colonialism K is the argument that has the best overall evidence,
and it's probably what I'd extend if I were giving the 2nr.

The politics links are also very strong, which means a viable 2nr is
Alaska CP + politics.

The energy assistance DA is lacks an external impact, which usually
means "don't go for this". But as a net benefit to the Alaska CP, it's
maybe winnable if you win the CP solves the case. The Denali Commission
is a federal agency (similar to the Tennessee Valley Authority, but for
Alaska only), so the resource tradeoff would happen at the federal
level, but not the state level.

The Alaska CP is maybe winnable. Alaska isn't a very wealthy state, and
it's in the midst of a budget crisis, so it can't really do anything to
fund things on its own. The CP tries to get around this by having Alaska
institute a statewide sales tax (there is currently no sales or income
tax in Alaska). An income tax would be better, but there's at least
evidence that says a sales tax could raise a billion a year. Is that
enough to fund the plan? It's a lot more than what's provided in the
status quo, so maybe. I think in most debates the aff will win a
solvency deficit, so you'll also have to extend framing or case
arguments to make politics outweigh.

China DA -- I turned out some links in the China DA file. They are very
obviously much better K links than China links. But if the China link
argument is "US Arctic leadership is bad", they probably help to
establish that the plan helps establish US Arctic leadership. And I'm
trying to provide a diversity of strategies, so maybe they work. I guess
time will tell.

Case arguments are mostly worth extending, and DA + case maybe works, as
long as the DA isn't energy assistance.

#### Framing

I didn't have time to do this -- so instead, I turned out cards from
three Michigan camp files from previous years. Everything else here is
original work.

#### Areas for future research:

\--alternate funding mechanisms for the Alaska CP. I had very little
time to work on this, but some ideas are an Alaskan income tax, and I
read a couple of articles about closing exemptions for oil companies.
They didn't have revenue projections, so I didn't cut them, but it's
maybe something to look for.

\--colonialism K. The Alaska-specific literature for this is pretty big,
and my research is only a very small portion.

## Climate adaptation advantage

**Frankson = Priscilla Frankson, an Iñupiaq masters student in Tribal
Leadership and Governance at Arizona State University, is from Point
Hope (Tikiġaq), Alaska, a small city about 125 miles above the Arctic
Circle**

[To adapt to the warming climate, Indigenous people in Alaska are
relying on their deep understanding and respect for the
land,]{.underline} a kind of humility developed over countless
generations. "[You can't really change the Arctic]{.underline},"
Frankson said. "[You can only change with the Arctic]{.underline}."

Yes, daily life in Alaska --- with its northern lights, its dependence
on ice and the movement of caribou --- may feel unrelatable. But this
way of living in tune with the environment and gracefully adapting to a
changing climate is becoming increasingly essential for the rest of the
country. [The strategies that Indigenous people in Alaska are developing
show that sometimes the best forms of climate adaptation are
**achievable, local solutions**.]{.underline}

[Generations of extreme conditions have equipped Alaska Natives with the
willingness and ability to embrace]{.underline} this kind of
[adaptation.]{.underline} As the impacts of climate change grow
increasingly severe in the rest of the country, we could all learn from
that.

As temperatures continue to rise, [Alaska Natives are turning to
intergenerational knowledge and community observations to build a wealth
of data that they hope will urge non-Indigenous decision-makers to
listen to what they have to say.]{.underline}

[In Unalaska]{.underline}, the largest city in the Aleutian Chain, [the
Qawalangin Tribe is gathering community feedback on climate
change]{.underline} and what the people are experiencing. [The tribe
will then use these observations to help develop its climate resilience
plans]{.underline}, which include culture camps with traditional dances
and classes on kayak making, traditional food nights, and water quality
testing programs.

Vera [Metcalf is the executive director of the Eskimo Walrus Commission,
which represents 19 coastal communities. Metcalf says that Indigenous
walrus hunters have adapted to climate change by participating in
research projects led by agencies like the US Fish and Wildlife
Service]{.underline}. "In the past, we were largely ignored in research
occurring in our homeland and waters," she said. "When you combine the
two ways of thinking, it really becomes a rich resource of information."

Roberta Tuurraq Glenn-Borade, Iñupiaq from Utqiaġvik, is the project
coordinator and community liaison at the Alaska Arctic Observatory and
Knowledge Hub, where she works with observers from four communities in
the Alaskan Arctic.

[Community observers share details like air temperature, wind speed, ice
conditions, and animal observations]{.underline}, sometimes sending in
photos of animals being harvested. Glenn-Borade and her team then take
this data and share it with agencies like the US National Weather
Service, which releases forecasts for the region. Glenn-Borade says
that, [historically, these forecasts prioritized larger ships offshore
rather than Indigenous people living on the coast and hopes that using
local observations will lead to better forecasts for Indigenous
communities. "That kind of foresight of what the conditions will be can
really make a difference between life or death,"]{.underline} she said.

Glenn-Borade also says this kind of local observation provides
invaluable historical context about how the coast and the ice have
changed over the years, what is within normal ranges, and what is
unexpected.

"That's what Indigenous knowledge is," she said. "It is constant
tracking and understanding and monitoring what's going on and being
prepared to respond on the fly."

As the world warms, these examples from Alaska offer a warning that we
can't simply do everything the way we used to. Saudi Arabia, for
example, can no longer ignore the deadly impacts heat is having on Hajj.
Places like the Pacific Northwest can no longer count on mild summers
and will save lives by investing in cooling infrastructure. But they
also offer hope that if we can shift away from trying to change the
environment to suit us, instead of the other way around, there may be a
chance of finding creative, unexpected ways of changing with our
climate.

When I spoke with Glenn-Borade recently, she told me she and her people
are proud "that [we're still here. We're not going to die off. Our
languages aren't going to die off. We will adapt. We'll continue to
adapt our lifestyles as the environment changes]{.underline}."

### 1nc -- technical assistance fails

One critique that is not being attributed to any particular respondent
is the concern that [[much of the funding for technical assistance can
go to consultants or agencies and their well-paid staffs while local
communities only see **a small portion of funds**]{.mark} **to**
actually implement energy-saving solutions **[along with a 4-inch binder
of plans that sits on a shelf.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"TA is fixing all the things that don\'t fit into anything else. Should
be open ended, nonrestricted funding to fix all this that falls between
the cracks." -- Meera Kohler

"Technical assistance is not writing a check. Technical assistance is
enabling champions with information and processes that are not readily
or inherently available. Technical assistance is as broad as the
definition as economic development, but at the end of the day, we\'ve
got to train the trainers, we\'ve got to get the next generation engaged
and impassionate about sustainable communities which begins with
sustainable systems, which is transportation, which is energy." --
Robert Venables

"Technical assistance is providing the knowledge you need to make a
decision - sort of helping look at all the options, answer questions to
help make a decision about whether to do something or not do something.
It\'s sort of that guidance and counseling towards making the right
decision. Technical assistance is not building something and hoping it
works. It\'s more of helping somebody make the right decision to go
forward and build it." -- Matt Bergan

"Technical assistance would be showing people how to do things and, in
some cases, learning from them and being able to embed some of their
experiences into your technical \[assistance\]. It\'s not just a one-way
street, they the user has something to offer off as well in many cases.
Technical assistance is probably not \[just\] building something.
[[Building something and walking away from it is not good technical
assistance. You need to embed ability to operate during the development
of the project so it can continue]{.underline}]{.mark}." -- Brent Petrie

As discussed in Subsection 2.3.1, there is a need for stronger
connections between a community and those outside of the community that
are in a position to collaborate and provide resources (linking social
capital). A number of [participants]{.underline} (with the majority in
ANVs) [referred to a lack of communication or cooperation between ANVs
and outside government as an impediment to implementing adaptation
strategies]{.underline}. [Participants talked about poor information
sharing and communication between the community and outside entities
that are not aware of what is happening "on the ground."]{.underline}
One ANV resident described state and federal agency biologists as
"computer biologists." He said, "They need to feel the pulse of what's
happening---numbers on the computer don't tell that much.

[The sheer size and high price tag of travel in Alaska impede
relationship-building between agencies and ANVs. Limited agency budgets
mean limited trips to ANVs]{.underline}. [When trips occur, they are
short. Opportunity for meaningful conversation is limited]{.underline}.
As a representative from a Department of Interior Landscape Conservation
Cooperative (LCC) explained, "The challenge for the LCC is that it works
with 68 tribes and 17 First Nations, most of whom are off road, and
there are only two full-time staff. So [they can\'t go into villages and
make face-to-face relationships]{.underline}. [They know face-to-face is
the way to do co-management, but they can\'t do it
regularly.]{.underline}" While in this example the issue was
co-management of game, [the problem of limited time in communities also
applies to collaborative planning]{.underline}.

Another problem in building rapport with external entities is that
[there are]{.underline} some still [language barriers in Alaska,
particularly with elders in remote areas. An Interior Alaska elder said
that agencies who visit his village tended to talk with younger people,
not elders, because it is easier for agencies to communicate with people
whose first language is English. This reduces the likelihood that
traditional community knowledge will find its way into
plans]{.underline}.

Part of the problem, as described by Jacobs and Brooks (2011, p. 100),
is that [communities with disagreements may not want to sit together in
public meetings]{.underline} (though none of my participants directly
stated this). [More than a fifth of all participants]{.underline} (with
half of these in ANVs) [cited community disagreement as a barrier to
adaptation. One ANV resident put it this way: "People get excited about
a project, but years go by and nothing happens. People start squabbling.
It's hard to get consensus.]{.underline} People are mad about things
that happened a long time ago." This lack of connectivity not only
hinders planning, but also reduces the likelihood of gaining outside
support for community adaptation. A few state and [federal agency
representatives told me that when a community is in dispute and there is
no clear leader, agencies do not want to invest in the
community.]{.underline}

2.3.2. The need for social capital to support collaboration

Generally, [planning collaborations are more effective if social
connections and trust are]{.underline} already present among the
participants or are [formed during the process]{.underline} (Innes et
al. 2011, p. ix; Johnston et al. 2011, p. 700; Ansell and Gash 2007, p.
544; Healey 2006, p.57; Innes and Booher 2003, p. 8; Winer and Ray 1994,
p. 138). There is an entire body of literature on the formation and
importance of these connections and trust, known as "social capital"
(Adger 2003; Putnam and Goss 2002; Coleman 1988). Social capital theory
explains how individuals use their connections for their own and for the
collective good (Adger 2003, p. 389). Aside from facilitating planning
processes, [social capital can boost community resilience in the face of
climate change]{.underline} (Arctic Council 2017, p. 14; Nilsson et al.
2016, p. 169; Cutter et al. 2008, pp. 601, 604; Norris et al. 2008, p.
136; Western et al. 2005, p. 1103) [and establish a basis for the kinds
of collective action needed for community adaptation]{.underline}
(Kofinas 2009, p. 85; Norris et al. 2008, p. 141; Lubell 2005, p. 263;
Adger 2003, p. 389; Ostrom and Ahn 2003, p. 3; Grootaert and Bastelaer
2002, p. 8; Reid and Salmen 2002, p. 89). The rest of this subsection
briefly summarizes the relevance of social capital to ANV adaptation
planning.

In order [to be heard by external government agencies and obtain
resources needed for adaptation, connections between indigenous
communities and external entities (known as "linking" social capital)
are important]{.underline} (Klein, Midgley, and Preston 2014, p. 907;
Matunga 2013, p. 27). [Building this capital can be challenging given
the legacy of colonization and the power imbalance between indigenous
participants and external agents]{.underline} (Ford et al. 2016, p. 178;
Sandercock 2004, p. 108; Wuttunee 2004, p. 187). [ANVs face the
additional challenge of being remote and rural, far from urban-based
state and federal decision-makers]{.underline} (McNeeley 2009, p. 15).
[Agencies in Alaska have traditionally not incentivized
relationship-building between employees and communities]{.underline},
and most employees do not stay at one post where they work with the same
set of communities year after year (Jacobs and Brooks 2011, p. 106).
Some rural communities and individuals feel that they have no control
over government decisions or that their voice is not be heard (Knapp et
al. 2014).

In addition to connections with external agents, connections within ANVs
(known as "bonding" social capital) are important to enable an ANV to
act with a common vision (Ritchie and Gill 2010, p. 58; McNeeley 2009,
p. 138). Strong and respected leaders are often essential in fostering
and implementing this vision among stakeholders (Garmestani and Benson
2013, p. 11; Olsson, Folke, and Berkes 2004, p. 83; Winer and Ray 1994,
p. 25). Yet building a common vision in an ANV can be challenging due to
disputes that sometimes exist between different families or entities.
This issue has received very limited attention in the literature on ANVs
(with the exception of Brunner and Lynch (2010, p. 221) but has been
noted in reports (Gray 2010) and news articles (DeMarban 2015; Demer
2015). For the remainder of this section, I provide background on the
distinct political situation within many ANVs that can make community
collaboration different.

[An ANV is not always a single indigenous people]{.underline}. ANVs have
often formed from different clans or bands that came together in a
single settlement.30 [In addition to historical divisions, there may be
political divisions exacerbated by Alaska state and federal
law]{.underline}. An example is the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement
Act (ANCSA), 43 U.S.C. §§ 1603, 1606, 1607,31 which has led to three
different spheres of power in most ANVs: the tribal government, the city
government, and the village corporation leadership (Chapin and Cochran
2014; Ristroph 2010). The tribal government has no jurisdiction over
land, only over tribal members. It is often the receiving entity for
federal grants for health, housing, and roads. Many but not all ANVs are
associated with an incorporated city, which is a political subdivision
of the state that may receive some grants for community development. The
city council may consist of non-Native members elected by residents,
while the tribal council consists entirely of Native residents. Some
communities have leadership challenges when the tribal council and the
city government do not agree on (or even talk about) matters of mutual
concern (Chapin and Cochran 2014, p. 20).

In addition to the tribe and city, [most ANVs are associated with a
third entity---the village corporation]{.underline}---[which often owns
most of the land]{.underline} in and around the village. If the village
is in a resource-rich area, the village corporation may drive
development of a lands important to the tribe (Chaffee 2008, p. 143),
and it have an office and business outside of the village (Ristroph
2010, p. 20). [This can lead to political differences between the tribe
and corporation.]{.underline} While some corporations allow tribal
members born after the enactment of ANCSA to become shareholders at
birth, others allow new membership only through inheritance of shares.
This can lead to a situation where many people receiving corporate
dividends live outside of the community, while many people living within
the community do not receive dividends at all. In short, political,
economic, and historical differences within ANVs can impede the
development of a common vision on climate change adaptation and other
community concerns.

In summary, [while there is a need for collaboration]{.underline} within
and beyond ANVs to create and carry out climate change adaptation plans,
[this may be **easier said than done**.]{.underline} [The history of
colonizing planning assistance and the remoteness of ANVs impede
relationships with external entities that could support planning
efforts]{.underline}. And [the fractured political nature of some ANVs
can hinder the community's ability to come together and adopt a common
vision for climate change]{.underline} planning and
[adaptation]{.underline}.

### 1nc -- plan won't be used

#### Lack of [awareness]{.underline} in Alaskan Native Villages means they'll never use the plan

E. Barrett **Ristroph**, 20**18** -- A DISSERTATION SUBMITTED TO THE
GRADUATE DIVISION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI'I AT MĀNOA IN PARTIAL

IN URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING "HOW CAN LAWS, INSTITUTIONS, AND PLANS
FACILITATE ALASKA NATIVE VILLAGE ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE?" Proquest
//DH

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

Another view is that laws are irrelevant to indigenous lifeways. [One
ANV resident explained]{.underline} to me that [there is no Western law
that will protect a hunter out on the land and river]{.underline}---the
hunter depends on his own knowledge system to survive. His people
understand that "Corporations come and go, governments come and go. But
the people, and what we do, remains." [Another ANV resident
said]{.underline}, "I would venture to say that [90% of our lifestyle is
illegal in some fashion]{.underline} or another." A number of
participants suggested that they would do what they needed to continue
their lifeway, regardless of the law. This outlook came up more in the
context of hunting and fishing, where decisions are made at the
individual and family level, rather than in the context of flooding and
erosion. [This outlook suggested a sense that new laws and agencies
would be futile, as they **would not be followed**]{.underline}.

[One barrier to implementing laws]{.underline} that I observed
[in]{.underline} the course of [my interviews]{.underline} and
conversations [was the lack of understanding of what the laws actually
said. A number of participants]{.underline}, including those from
outside of ANVs, [gave incorrect statements about the law.]{.underline}
Those in villages sometimes thought that subsistence laws were more
restrictive than they actually were. Those outside of villages were more
likely to misunderstand tribal sovereignty and rights. Beyond
misunderstanding the laws, [many simply do not know options available
under existing laws]{.underline}. As one ANV resident said, "If there
are any laws or regulations related to climate change that can and will
impact our area we are not aware or have any knowledge of them. ... Are
there any laws\[?\] \[W\]e need to get educated by either the state of
the federal government \[on laws\] that will assist us in the long run
on climate change."

This ignorance is not limited to ANV residents. Neither I (prior to this
research) nor several of the lawyers I interviewed was aware that laws
already provide for uneven land trades between the federal government
and villages in order to facilitate relocation (43 U.S.C. § 1621(f); 16
U.S.C. § 3192). One Elder poignantly summed up this lack of capacity
among those who should have capacity: "White people are starting to
realize that what they're doing is not right, and they want to right it,
but they don't know how." In other words, [there may be a need to raise
awareness of existing]{.underline} laws and [programs that facilitate
adaptation, rather than inventing new laws]{.underline}.

### 1nc -- consultation turn

#### Consultation isn't meaningful and doesn't engage the community

Julia **Loginova** et al, 20**25** - Centre for Social Responsibility in
Mining (CSRM), the University of Queensland, St Lucia, Australia
"Enabling Indigenous-centred decision-making for a just energy
transition? Lessons from community consultation and consent in the
circumpolar Arctic" Energy Research & Social Science, February,
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221462962500009X#bb0340>
//DH

5.2.1.1. Procedural limitations

[[A key limitation to]{.underline}]{.mark} company- and [state-led
[consultation and consent is procedural]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
studies highlighting issues around the goals, scope, and timing of
engagement. [[Communities]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[**perceive**
consultations as bureaucratic box-ticking exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[117\], [[with **pre-determined agendas** aimed at project approval
rather than **genuine** dialogue]{.underline}.
[Accommodations]{.underline}]{.mark} [are typically limited to project
terms and conditions, [fram]{.mark}ing [the question as "**how" rather
than "whether**" to execute a project]{.mark}]{.underline} \[33\]. In
terms of timing, there is a perception that engagement: does not start
early enough in the planning process \[99,118\]; leaves insufficient
time for preparation, discussion and addressing concerns; and is
inadequate in engaging vulnerable and often excluded groups, such as
youth \[119\] or women \[89\]. In Greenland, for example, "insufficient,
late and overly narrow public participation are major themes in the
decision phase of the natural resource projects" \[120\]. A 2014 report
by the Greenland NGO "Coalition for Better Citizen Involvement" made
recommendations for improving citizen engagement \[96\], yet procedural
issues continue to undermine effective and meaningful communication,
impacting the ability of communities and stakeholders to reach agreeable
decisions \[99\].

5.2.1.2. Legal ambiguity and gaps

Another limitation refers to legal ambiguity and gaps regarding land and
property rights. Studies highlight the issues of overlapping and
unresolved land claims and legal interests across territories and among
multiple owners and land users \[89,121\]. This creates confusion
regarding the rights and responsibilities of stakeholders, contributing
to disputes and challenges in achieving meaningful consent. In addition,
there are uncertainties or inadequacies in legal frameworks concerning
triggers for consultation and consent. In Russia, for example, "the
federal regulation requires companies to hold public hearings with local
communities to discuss environmental impacts as part of EIA
\[environmental impact assessment\] at the stage of state project
approval. However, the federal regulation does not require a specific
consultation with Indigenous peoples" and there are no requirements for
Indigenous consent \[78\].

5.2.1.3. Weak relationships and lack of trust

Across the north, historical grievances, past experiences of extractive
industries and [ongoing colonial practices continue to strain
relationships between Indigenous communities, governments, and
industry]{.underline} \[112\]. However, these tensions are not merely
historical but are rooted in the persistent effects of coloniality,
including systemic marginalization and dispossession of Indigenous lands
\[91\]. Centralised [[top-down]{.mark} structures and [processes
perpetuate mistrust,]{.mark} diminish self-confidence, [and undermine
communities\' willingness to engage with
government]{.mark}-]{.underline} and company-[led
initiatives]{.underline} \[122\]. Building trust is strongly linked to
effective communication and transparency, and consultation and consent
are fundamentally about building long-lasting relations \[73,123\]. For
example, Bowes-Lyon, Richards \[49\] explained that due to the lack of
communication over contamination issues, community members distrusted
the Nunavut government in the reclamation of the Nanisivik townsite as
part of the mine closure. Furthermore, [many engagement activities are
perceived as opportunistic and transactional, with organisations
engaging communities only when a need arises]{.underline} \[73\]. [From
the community\'s point of view, [this **reinforces colonial
dynamics**,]{.mark} as organisations frequently fail to acknowledge
historical and ongoing injustices]{.underline}, or invest in creating
genuine relationships, which prioritize Indigenous self-determination
and agency in decision-making processes.

5.2.1.4. Cultural disconnect

Cultural disconnect refers to epistemological differences in worldviews,
values, and decision-making cultures between Indigenous communities and
external stakeholders \[124,125\]. Issues arise from the inability of
the engagement process to recognise different ways of gathering and
understanding information, or relating to the environment. The Southern
Sámi scholar Fjellheim \[33\] explains that "[dialogues" promoted as a
prescription of good governance are underpinned by epistemic
miscommunications, devaluing Indigenous relations with the landscapes,
knowledges, practices, and interests]{.underline}. These differences
lead to disagreements over consultation goals, the nature of consent,
and ideas of justice. As Table 3 demonstrates, stakeholders have deeply
rooted values, ideologies and epistemologies, translating into plural
rationalities \[126\] when it comes to decision-making. Importantly, a
diversity of objectives exists within these groups, as neither
community, company, nor government are homogeneous entities. A key
challenge is how to reconcile different perceptions of participatory
mechanisms and FPIC procedures among actors \[90,104\].

Literature on indigenous planning suggests that the [externally driven
planning processes]{.underline} referenced in the previous subsection
[can be particularly problematic for indigenous
communities]{.underline}. [By "externally driven," I mean]{.underline}
[a planning process that is]{.underline} guided by (and often [initiated
by]{.underline}) a private or [government]{.underline} planning entity
not based in the community. [The community approves the plan but may
have had limited participation in drafting it]{.underline}. I provide
more detail in Section 4.2 on how planning is externally driven for
ANVs.

[Problems with externally driven processes relate to paternalistic
planning approaches that disregard indigenous knowledge, cultural goals,
planning traditions, and concepts of space]{.underline}27 (Hibbard,
Lane, and Rasmussen 2008, p. 142; Lane 2003, p. 365; Sandercock 2004, p.
95; Matunga 2013, p. 4; Porter 2010, pp. 4, 17; Ostrom 2004, p. 2).
[Such approaches can perpetuate outside intervention and control,
entrenching disparities and repressing tribal capacit]{.underline}y
(Ford et al. 2016, p. 179; Mannell, Palermo, and Smith 2013, p. 116;
Jojola 2008, p. 41). The literature also refers to a lack of indigenous
planners or attention to indigenous issues in the planning field
(Hibbard, Lane, and Rasmussen 2008, p. 136; Sandercock 2004, p. 95).
Finally, [**even where planning efforts attempt to avoid these
problems**, they fail to address the legacy of
post-settler]{.underline}28 [states' usurpation of indigenous land
rights]{.underline} (Hibbard, Lane, and Rasmussen 2008, p. 139). In
other words, **[poor planning can prolong injustice]{.underline}**. This
injustice takes on another angle in the context of climate change, as
many indigenous communities are trying to plan for changes resulting
from greenhouse gases emitted primarily by non-indigenous populations
(Whyte 2013, p. 523).

### 2nc -- consultation turn

#### State-driven consultation inevitably fails

//DH

In the context of the global rush to decarbonise, participatory
processes of [community consultation and consent received heightened
importance]{.underline} and urgency. Meaningful consultation and consent
are crucial to balancing power relations between governments, industry
and affected communities. [[Despite an unprecedented recognition of
Indigenous peoples\' rights]{.mark} and their role in just energy
transitions, [complex challenges continue to characterise consultation
and consent driven by states]{.mark}]{.underline} and companies. Based
on an integrative narrative and case review of over 100 academic
articles, [we have identified [limitations of]{.mark}]{.underline}
company- [and [**state-led** consultation and consent]{.mark} across the
circumpolar north, with common categories [being: inadequate
procedures]{.mark} or frameworks for consultation; [unclear legal
frameworks]{.mark} and gaps; [weak relationships and distrust between
Indigenous communities, state and industry; cultural disconnect; and
asymmetries in power, knowledge, and decision-making]{.mark}
authority]{.underline}. They clearly speak to key components of just
energy transitions for Indigenous peoples, as conceptualised by
Rioux-Gobeil and Thomassin to include justice for Indigenous knowledge
renewal and procedural power \[22\].

[[Many of these limitations are **structural,** rooted in colonial
legacies, top-down and centralised decision-making]{.underline},]{.mark}
and neoliberal economic systems. These limitations are also relational,
stemming from insufficient efforts, resourcing, and lack of
trust-building relationships. As cases from the circumpolar north
illustrate, [each community experience is unique, given the local
complexities of histories, cultural practices, political contexts, and
resources that Indigenous peoples have at their disposal to engage
meaningfully]{.underline}. Only a few cases documented positive
community experiences of consultation and consent, reflecting common
bias in academic literature to focus on problematic cases. While many of
the reviewed studies focus on the lack of Indigenous capacity and
ability to engage, other studies discuss activism and resistance to
colonial and extractive structures that increasingly impact on resource
decision-making \[13,40\].

#### Consultation requirements fail to meaningfully include Indigenous input -- only an [Indigenous-led]{.underline} process solves

//DH

Achieving justice in energy transitions requires not only changes in
technology or regulations. Enabling just energy transitions necessitates
a redefinition of governance and norms that enable deep structural and
relational changes so that Indigenous and land-connected people control
development on their lands on their own terms \[57\]. Across circumpolar
countries, advances in jurisprudence and Indigenous peoples\' assertion
of their rights have influenced governments, companies, right-holders
and stakeholders to start re-envisioning, reviewing, and redesigning
norms and approaches to consultation and consent. [The scope of these
initiatives is broader than the narrow legal definitions of [the "duty
to consult]{.mark}]{.underline}" \[89\], [which "[appears to mostly
enable]{.mark}, rather than impede, [the expansion of colonial]{.mark}
and capitalist [social relations]{.mark}"]{.underline} \[84\].
Increasingly, communities are negotiating access to the lands they own,
manage and use, generating some level of control. Cases in Canada
demonstrate Indigenous-led and Indigenous-centred decision-making that
leverages the UNDRIP and treaties to define and control the
decision-making processes, including through Indigenous-led impact
assessments and Indigenous-co-ownership arrangements. However, as cases
have demonstrated, the Sámi across the Sápmi have less leverage to
influence decision-making.

In the paper, we provided a nuanced understanding of transitions in
governance across the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions \[142\], focussing
on Indigenous-centred decision-making. [[We differentiated
Indigenous-benefiting]{.mark} and Indigenous-informed **[from
Indigenous-led approaches]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [[with the key
difference being in the level of]{.mark} leadership and [agency of
Indigenous peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Indigenous-led approaches
recognise that Indigenous land-connected communities are not just
stakeholders, they are rightsholders as well as leaders and
managers]{.underline}. [Indigenous nations should be considered as
self-determining entities, **without imposing unilateral
processes**]{.underline} \[86\]. This is the key principle of
Indigenous-led FPIC, as per recent guidelines developed by the Securing
Indigenous Peoples\' Rights in the Green Economy (SIRGE) Coalition
\[143\].

While governments and companies are seeking to strengthen and multiply
participatory channels for meaningful community engagement in
decision-making, new initiatives in governance and management with
direct participation of Indigenous peoples point to promising avenues
for justice and equity in transition processes, however, challenges
remain. In the paper, we identified barriers to Indigenous-centred
decision-making including lack of recognition and integration of
Indigenous peoples\' rights, Indigenous representation and internal
decision-making, and formal legal and regulatory constraints.
Furthermore, critical literature on Indigenous rights and consultation
and consent cautions to be aware of different power effects these
initiatives might entail beyond their stated aims \[144\], as several
studies argue that [norms with an "emancipatory and reconciliation
potential" can ultimately lead to disempowering processes when their
meaning is curtailed]{.underline} \[145\]. [This is because
Indigenous-informed, Indigenous-benefiting and many Indigenous-led
approaches, whilst aiming to ensure Indigenous peoples are active
participants in decision-making, are based on formal and patronized
decision-making processes which are institutionalised within top-down
legal, regulatory, and corporate systems]{.underline}.

While advances have been reported in the circumpolar context, more needs
to be done for re-centring Indigenous-led decision-making for just
energy transitions. Some of the key lessons learnt from our review are:

1\. Prioritizing trust and relationships. Meaningful decision-making
moves at "the speed of trust" and communication and transparency are
critical to developing and sustaining collaborations and partnerships.

2\. Indigenous-centred and led approaches are based on not only capacity
and leadership of Indigenous people, but more so on the capacity of
institutions and organisations. Building institutional capacities must
be driven by clearly defined visions, values and practices and align
with Indigenous-centred priorities and approaches.

3\. It is important to establish a shared understanding of definitions
and meanings of terms such as 'consent', 'dialogue', and
'benefit-sharing', as they can vary significantly and can be loaded with
negative meanings. The concept 'Indigenous-led' can be exploited to get
access to land and resources.

4\. Enabling Indigenous-centred decision-making requires access to
resources and support including capital, technical and legal expertise,
infrastructure and time. Sufficient resourcing is needed to meaningfully
engage and negotiate as well as fulfill cultural responsibilities and
rights.

5\. [**[To be of value to Indigenous people]{.underline}**,
[consultation]{.underline}]{.mark} [and consent [should incorporate the
**recognition of a 'no'** as a valuable outcome of
consultation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, conditions for consent
are not static and are subject to renegotiation, in particular, in the
context of the shifting (re-)assertion of Indigenous rights and
self-determination, emphasizing the need for ongoing dialogue.

6\. Finally, [just transition hinges upon the recognition of Indigenous
rights, self-determination and economic reconciliation. Research
highlights the importance of restorative justice and truth-telling about
the profound impacts of colonisation on Indigenous peoples across
generations to enable equitable consultation and consent]{.underline}.

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

Despite the desire for more external financial assistance, [there is a
sense that assistance that can be "colonizing]{.underline}" or
heavy-handed. Several [ANV participants said they felt exploited by
their lack of power relative to outside government]{.underline} and
researchers, [and a few said that the outside government should step
back]{.underline} and take cues from the ANV communities. One supporter
of indigenous rights from a federal agency conveyed this sense of
exploitation:

[One ANV resident wanted to convey this message to federal]{.underline}
and [state government: "Leave us alone, let us regulate our own
laws]{.underline}." He explained, "[They get in there and just screw
everything up for us .... Everything they tell us to do, we've been
doing for 14,000 years]{.underline}. And we can do it for another 14,000

Another reason Tribal consultation is considered inadequate is that most
statutes or agency guidelines creating a Tribal consultation requirement
do not create a judicially enforceable right to sue for lack of adequate
consultation. [Tribes can]{.underline} sometimes [sue for inadequate

they]{.underline} [rarely win because an agency need only **tick the
box** of offering consultation]{.underline}, **[even if it is not

**pay lip service** to Tribal consultation without substantively
involving Tribal leaders in decisions affecting traditional lands and
resources]{.underline}.127 In a similar vein, to comply with Tribal
consultation requirements an agency is under no obligation to supply
Tribes with capacity-building funds that would allow Tribes to
meaningfully engage in the consultation process.128 As a result, even if
agencies reach out to Tribes to start the consultation process, Tribes,
especially Tribes in Alaska that are often extremely small and
economically marginalized, may not have the staff, time, or money to
review the documents the agency sends along. Finally, Tribal
consultation requirements laid out in Executive Orders or agency
guidelines can easily be revoked by future Administrations.129 This
leaves Tribal consultation requirements that are not entrenched in
statutory language, on unstable ground.

### 1nc -- mitigation turn

#### Climate adaptation assistance facilitates genocide, and lets governments off the hook for mitigation

Program, Sandra Day O\'Connor College of Law, Arizona State University.

Change, 78 U. COLO. L. REV. 1625 (2007). Available at:
https://scholar.law.colorado.edu/lawreview/vol78/iss4/13 //DH

The international dialogue on climate change is currently focused on a
strategy of [adaptation]{.underline} to climate change that [includes
the projected removal of entire communities]{.underline}, if necessary.
[Such a strategy will **prove genocidal** for many groups of indigenous
peoples]{.underline}. As Sheila Watt-Cloutier observes in the context of
the Inuit case, [it is unconscionable to reduce an entire people to
status as a \"footnote to globalization.\"]{.underline} 252 [One of the
greatest evils of]{.underline} European [imperialism]{.underline} and
the United States\' expansion into the West during the nineteenth
century [was the]{.underline} forcible appropriation of indigenous lands
and the wholesale [removal of indigenous people. The genocide of
indigenous peoples was justified by policymakers as being necessary for
the triumph of European civilization]{.underline} and for the
achievement of the \"manifest destiny\" of the United States.253
[Contemporary policymakers must not repeat this dynamic in the context
of climate change]{.underline} policy. [To dismiss these]{.underline}
ancient [cultures as \"doomed]{.underline}\" in the face of industrial
development [is to continue the colonial rhetoric about the \"fate\" of
indigenous peoples]{.underline}. [This is the time to develop a
concerted international strategy to prevent the need for massive
relocation]{.underline} of indigenous peoples, with the attendant
destruction of culture and communities that this will entail.

Scholarly commentators on climate change emphasize that \"justice must
play a central role in addressing climate change impacts.\"254 However,
what constitutes \"justice\" is the subject of active debate.255
Advocates of adaptation policy, in a pitch for compensatory justice,
stress the need to compensate the affected communities for the harm they
have suffered. However, they are focusing on compensating communities
for harms that are perceived to be inevitable. Under this view,
indigenous peoples will indeed become a \"footnote to globalization.\"
Yet [from an indigenous perspective, justice can only be achieved by an
affirmative commitment to protect indigenous peoples within their
traditional lands]{.underline}.256 This is the type of justice
envisioned by advocates of an indigenous right to environmental
self-determination. They argue that if the nation-states alter their
domestic policies to recognize this right for indigenous peoples, then
they will promote the continued survival of these unique peoples and
cultures. The harm of climate change is occurring, but the [catastrophic
impacts can still be mitigated]{.underline}. The nation-states are
moving toward a consensus that protects values of global justice, but
they have not yet achieved that goal. [The Inuit petition presents an
opportunity for the United States to rethink its domestic policy on
climate change]{.underline}. It is incumbent upon powerful nations, such
as the United States, to engage in a mitigation strategy that will
protect indigenous peoples and their ancient and remarkable cultures.

## Framing

### Consequentialism

#### Consequentialism first\-\--extinction is irreversible, preventing future improvements.

Seth D. **Baum &** Anthony M. **Barrett 18**. Global Catastrophic Risk
Institute. 2018. "Global Catastrophes: The Most Extreme Risks." Risk in
Extreme Environments: Preparing, Avoiding, Mitigating, and Managing,
edited by Vicki Bier, Routledge, pp. 174--184.

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important? [Taken **literally**, a global
catastrophe can be any event that is in some way catastrophic across the
globe]{.underline}. [This suggests a rather low threshold]{.underline}
for what counts as a global catastrophe. An event causing just one death
on each continent (say, from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a
global catastrophe, because surely these deaths would be catastrophic
for the deceased and their loved ones. [However, in common usage, a
global catastrophe would be **catastrophic** for a significant portion
of the globe]{.underline}. Minimum thresholds have variously been set
around ten thousand to ten million deaths or \$10 billion to \$10
trillion in damages (Bostrom and Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter
of the human population (Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). [Others have
emphasized catastrophes that cause **long-term declines in the
trajectory of human civilization**]{.underline} (Beckstead 2013), [that
human civilization **does not recover from**]{.underline} (Maher and
Baum 2013), [that drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline} ([Bostrom]{.underline} 2002, [using the term
"**existential risk**"), or that result in **human
extinction**]{.underline} (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004). [A common theme
across all these treatments of GCR is that **[some]{.mark}
[catastrophes]{.mark} [are vastly more important than
others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to
recognize this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983).
[Without nuclear winter, a global nuclear war might kill several hundred
million people. This is obviously a major catastrophe, but humanity
would presumably carry on. However, with **nuclear
winter**]{.underline}, per Sagan, [**[humanity]{.mark} [could go
extinct]{.mark}**. The loss would be not just an additional four billion
or so deaths, but the [loss of **all future
generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To paraphrase Sagan, [the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
**more**]{.underline}. [Sagan estimated **[500 trillion lives]{.mark}**,
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species. Sagan's 500 trillion number
[may]{.mark} even [be an **underestimate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
analysis here takes an adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the
human species and the long-term fate of the universe. On these long time
scales, the descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be
recognizably "human". The issue then is whether the descendants are
still worth caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs
the question of how many of them there will be. Barring major global
catastrophe, Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more
years 2 until the Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar
System, Milky Way galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse
will remain habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin
1997), should our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. [An
open question in astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants
of humanity to continue living for an **infinite length of time** or
instead merely an **astronomically large but finite** length of
time]{.underline} (see e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, [the
stakes with global catastrophes **could** be **much larger than the loss
of 500 trillion lives.** Debates about the infinite vs. the merely
astronomical are of theoretical interest]{.underline} (Ng 1991; Bossert
et al. 2007), [but they have **limited practical significance**. This
can be seen when **evaluating GCRs from a standard
[risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude]{.mark} framework**. Using
Sagan's 500 trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the
probability of global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance
is of the same significance as saving one human life. Phrased
differently, [society should **try 500 trillion times harder to
prevent**]{.mark} **a [global catastrophe]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it
should [to save a person's life]{.mark}**. Or, preventing one million
deaths is equivalent to a one-in500-million reduction in the probability
of global catastrophe. This suggests society should **make extremely
large investment in GCR reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives.**]{.underline} Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a
similar point in monetary terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as
the value of a statistical human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the
total loss of life (double the 2004 world population); he describes both
figures as significant underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600
trillion as an underestimate of the value of preventing global
catastrophe. For comparison, the United States government typically uses
a VSL of around one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying
a \$10 million VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value
of preventing global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion,
[society should be willing to spend]{.underline} at least that much to
prevent a global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend
at least [\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the
probability of global catastrophe]{.underline}. Thus [while reasonable
disagreement exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count
future generations, even low-end positions suggest **vast resource
allocations** should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is
only **strengthened** when considering the **astronomical size of the
stakes**]{.underline}, but the same point holds either way. The bottom
line is that, [as long as something along the lines of the standard
riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then
**even tiny GCR reductions** merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
**permanent harm to global human civilization**. The discussion thus far
has assumed that all human lives are valued equally. This assumption is
**not universally held**]{.underline}. [People often value some people
more than others]{.underline}, favoring themselves, their family and
friends, their compatriots, their generation, or others whom they
identify with. [Great debates rage on across moral philosophy,
economics, and other fields about how much people should value
others]{.underline} who are distant in space, time, or social relation,
as well as the unborn members of future generations. [This debate is
crucial]{.underline} for all valuations of risk, including GCR. Indeed,
if each of us only cares about our immediate selves, then global
catastrophes may not be especially important, and we probably have
better things to do with our time than worry about them. [[While
everyone has the right to their **own views**]{.mark} **and
feelings**]{.underline}, we find that [[the strongest arguments are for
the **widely held position** that **all human lives should be valued
equally**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This position is succinctly stated in
the United States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848
Declaration of Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be self-evident:
that all men and 3 women are created equal". [[Philosophers speak
of]{.mark} an agent-neutral, objective "view from nowhere"]{.underline}
(Nagel 1986) [or [a "veil of ignorance"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rawls
1971) [[in which each]{.mark} person [considers what is best for society
**irrespective of which member**]{.mark} **of society [they happen to
be]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Such a perspective **suggests [valuing
everyone equally]{.mark}**, regardless of who they are or where or when
they live. This in turn [suggests a **very high value for reducing
GCR**]{.mark}, or a high degree of priority for GCR reduction
efforts.]{.underline}

### Extinction

#### Extinction first

<https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf>,
Accessed 7/22/2017, Kent Denver-jKIM)

1.2. THE ETHICS OF EXISTENTIAL RISK In his book Reasons and Persons,
Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit advanced an influential argument about
the importance of avoiding extinction: I believe that if we destroy
mankind, as we now can, this outcome will be much worse than most people
think. [[Compare]{.mark} three outcomes: (1) Peace. (2) A nuclear [war
that kills 99%]{.mark} of the world's existing population. (3) A nuclear
[war that kills 100%]{.mark}.]{.underline} (2) would be worse than (1),
and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is the greater of these two
differences? [Most people believe that the greater difference is between
(1) and (2).]{.underline} [I believe that [the difference between (2)
and (3) is]{.mark} very much [great]{.mark}er]{.underline}. \... [The
Earth will remain habitable for **at least another billion
years**.]{.underline} [Civilization began only a few thousand years
ago.]{.underline} [If we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand
years may be only **a tiny fraction** of the whole of civilized human
history.]{.underline} [The difference between (2) and (3) may thus be
the difference between this tiny fraction and all of the rest of this
history.]{.underline} [If we compare this possible history to a day,
what has occurred so far is only a **fraction of a
second**.65]{.underline} In this argument, it seems that Parfit is
assuming that the survivors of a nuclear war that kills 99% of the
population would eventually be able to recover civilisation without
long-term effect. As we have seen, this may not be a safe assumption --
but for the purposes of this thought experiment, the point stands. [What
makes [existential catastrophes]{.mark} especially bad is that they
would ["**destroy the future**,"]{.mark} as]{.underline} another Oxford
philosopher, Nick [Bostrom, puts it.]{.underline}66 [This future could
potentially be extremely long and full of [flourishing, and]{.mark}
would therefore [have]{.mark} extremely [large
value]{.mark}.]{.underline} In standard risk analysis, when working out
how to respond to risk, we work out the expected value of risk
reduction, by weighing the probability that an action will prevent an
adverse event against the severity of the event. [Because the value of
preventing existential catastrophe is so vast, even a tiny probability
of prevention has huge expected value.]{.underline}67 Of course, there
is persisting reasonable disagreement about ethics and there are a
number of ways one might resist this conclusion.68 Therefore, it would
be unjustified to be overconfident in Parfit and Bostrom's argument. [In
some areas, government policy does give significant weight to future
generations.]{.underline} For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear
waste storage, governments have considered timeframes of thousands,
hundreds of thousands, and even a million years.69 Justifications for
this policy usually appeal to principles of intergenerational equity
according to which future generations ought to get as much protection as
current generations.70 Similarly, widely accepted norms of sustainable
development require development that meets the needs of the current
generation without compromising the ability of future generations to
meet their own needs.71 [However, when it comes to existential risk, it
would seem that we fail to live up to principles of intergenerational
equity.]{.underline} [Existential catastrophe would not only give future
generations less than the current generations; **it would give them
nothing**.]{.underline} Indeed, [reducing existential risk plausibly has
a quite low cost for us in comparison with the huge expected value it
has for future generations.]{.underline} In spite of this, relatively
little is done to reduce existential risk. [Unless we give up on norms
of intergenerational equity, they give us a strong case for
significantly increasing our efforts to reduce existential
risks.]{.underline} 1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE SYSTEMATICALLY
UNDERINVESTED IN, AND THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY [In spite
of the importance of [existential risk]{.mark} reduction, it probably
receives less attention than is warranted.]{.underline} As a result,
concerted international cooperation is required if we are to receive
adequate protection from existential risks. 1.3.1. Why existential risks
are likely to be underinvested in [There are several reasons why
existential risk reduction is likely to be underinvested
in.]{.underline} [Firstly, [it is a global public
good]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Economic theory predicts that such goods
tend to be underprovided.]{.underline} [The benefits of existential risk
reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed around the globe from the
countries responsible for taking action.]{.underline} Consequently, a
country which reduces existential risk gains only a small portion of the
benefits but bears the full brunt of the costs. Countries thus have
strong incentives to free ride, receiving the benefits of risk reduction
without contributing. As a result, too few do what is in the common
interest. [Secondly]{.underline}, as already suggested above,
[existential risk reduction is [an intergenerational]{.mark} public
[good]{.mark}: most of the benefits are enjoyed by future generations
who have no say in the political process.]{.underline} [For these goods,
the problem is temporal free riding: the current generation enjoys the
benefits of inaction while future generations bear the costs.
Thirdly]{.underline}, many [existential risks]{.underline}, such as
machine superintelligence, engineered pandemics, and solar
geoengineering, [pose an unprecedented and uncertain future
threat.]{.underline} Consequently, it is hard to develop a satisfactory
governance regime for them: there are few existing governance
instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is unclear what
shape new instruments should take. In this way, our position with regard
to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we faced when nuclear
weapons first became available. [[Cognitive biases]{.mark} also [lead
people to underestimate]{.mark} existential [risks]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Since there have not been any catastrophes of this magnitude, these
[risks are not salient]{.mark} to politicians and the
public.]{.underline}72 This is an example of the misapplication of the
availability heuristic, a mental shortcut which assumes that something
is important only if it can be readily recalled. [Another cognitive bias
affecting perceptions of existential risk is [scope
neglect]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a seminal 1992 study, three groups were
asked how much they would be willing to pay to save 2,000, 20,000 or
200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups answered
\$80, \$78, and \$88, respectively.73 In this case, the size of the
benefits had little effect on the scale of the preferred response.
[[People become numbed]{.mark} to the effect of saving lives [when the
numbers get too large]{.mark}.]{.underline} 74 [Scope neglect is a
particularly acute problem for existential risk because the numbers at
stake are so large.]{.underline} [Due to scope neglect,
[decision-makers]{.mark} are prone to [treat existential risks]{.mark}
in a similar way to problems which are [less severe by many orders of
magnitude]{.mark}.]{.underline} A wide range of other cognitive biases
are likely to affect the evaluation of existential risks.75

#### Anticipating nuclear extinction [breeds empathy]{.underline} and [care]{.underline} -- distancing ourselves from considering extinction [reifies]{.underline} detached elitism

**Offord, 17**---Faculty of Humanities, School of Humanities Research
and Graduate Studies, Bentley Campus (Baden, "BEYOND OUR NUCLEAR
ENTANGLEMENT," Angelaki, 22:3, 17-25, dml) \[ableist language
modifications denoted by brackets\]

[You are steered towards **overwhelming** and **inexplicable pain**
[when you consider]{.mark} the **nuclear entanglement** that the
species]{.underline} Homo sapiens [finds itself in]{.underline}. This is
because [the fact of living in [the nuclear]{.mark} age presents an
**[existential]{.mark}**, **aesthetic**, **[ethical]{.mark}** and
**psychological [challenge]{.mark}** that defines human consciousness.
Although an **immanent threat** and **ever-present danger** to the
**very existence** of the human species, living with the possibility of
nuclear war has **infiltrated [the matrix of modernity]{.mark} so
profoundly** as to]{.underline} paralyse [\[**[shut down]{.mark}**\]
[our mind-set to respond]{.mark} adequately. [We have chosen to **ignore
the facts**]{.mark} at the heart of the nuclear program]{.underline}
with its dangerous algorithm; [we have chosen [to **live with the**
]{.mark}**capacity** and [**possibility** of]{.mark} a **collective**,
**pervasive** and even **[planetary-scale suicide]{.mark}**; and the
techno-industrial-national powers that claim there is "**no immediate
danger**" ad infinitum]{.underline}.8 This has led to one of the key
logics of modernity\'s insanity. As Harari writes: "Nuclear weapons have
turned war between superpowers into a mad act of collective suicide, and
therefore forced the most powerful nations on earth to find alternative
and peaceful ways to resolve conflicts."9 This is the nuclear algorithm
at work, a methodology of madness. In revisiting Jacques Derrida in "No
Apocalypse, Not Now (Full Speed Ahead, Seven Missiles, Seven
Missives),"10 who described nuclear war as a "non-event," it is clear
that the pathology of the "non-event" remains as active as ever even in
the time of Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un with their stichomythic nuclear
posturing. [[The question]{.mark} of our times [is whether we
have]{.mark} an **equal** or **more compelling [capacity]{.mark}** and
**willingness** [to **end this**]{.mark} **impoverished but ever-present
[logic]{.mark}** of pain and uncertainty. How not simply to **bring
about disarmament**, but to **go beyond** this politically
charged]{.underline}, as well as mythological and psychological
[**nuclear algorithm**?]{.underline} How to find love amidst the nuclear
entanglement; the antidote to this entanglement? Is it possible to end
the pathology of power that exists with nuclear capacity? Sadly, the
last lines of Nitin Sawhney\'s "Broken Skin" underscore this
entanglement: Just 5 miles from India\'s nuclear test site Children play
in the shade of the village water tank Here in the Rajasthan desert
people say They\'re proud their country showed their nuclear
capability.11 As an activist scholar working in the fields of human
rights and cultural studies, [[responding]{.mark} to the nuclear
algorithm [is an **imperative**]{.mark}. Your **politics**, **ethics**
and **scholarship are indivisible** in this cause. An **acute [sense of
care]{.mark} for the world**, [informed by **pacifist** and
**non-violent**, **de-colonialist approaches**]{.mark} to knowledge and
practice, **[pervades your concern]{.mark}**. You are **aware** that
there are **other ways of knowing** than those you are familiar and
credentialed with]{.underline}. You are aware that you are complicit in
the prisons that you choose to live inside,12 and that there is no such
thing as an innocent bystander. [You [use]{.mark} your [scholarship
to]{.mark} **shake up the world**]{.underline} from its paralysis,
abjection and amnesia; [to **[unsettle]{.mark} the epistemic** and
**structural [violence]{.mark}** that is ubiquitous to neoliberalism and
its machinery; to **create dialogic** and **learning spaces** for the
work of critical human rights and critical justice to take place. All
this, and to **enable an ethics of intervention** through understanding
what is at the very heart of the]{.underline} critical human rights
[impulse]{.underline}, creating a "dialogue for being, because I am not
without the other."13 Furthermore, as a critical human rights advocate
[living in a nuclear armed world, your challenge is to
**[reconceptualise the human community]{.mark}**]{.underline} as Ashis
Nandy has argued, [[to see how we can learn to]{.mark} **co-exist with
others in conviviality** and also learn to **[co-survive]{.mark} with
the non-human**, even to **flourish**]{.underline}. A dialogue for being
requires a leap into a human rights frame that includes a deep
ecological dimension, where [the planet itself is **inherently involved
as a participant** in its future]{.underline}. This requires scholarship
that "thinks like a mountain."14 A critical human rights approach
understands that it cannot be simply human-centric. It requires a
nuanced and arresting clarity to present perspectives on co-existence
and co-survival that are from human and non-human viewpoints.15
Ultimately, [you realise that your [struggle]{.mark} is **not confined
to**]{.underline} declarations, treaties, [**legislation**, and **law**,
**though they have their role**. It must go further to [produce
"**creative intellectual exchange**]{.mark} [that]{.mark} might [release
**new ethical energies for** ]{.mark}**mutually assured
[survival]{.mark}**."]{.underline}16 [Taking [an **anti-nuclear
stance**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **enabling a [post-nuclear
activism]{.mark}** demands a **revolution**]{.underline} within the
field of human rights work. [Recognising the **entanglement of
nuclearism**]{.underline} with the Anthropocene, for one thing,
[**[requires]{.mark} a profound [shift in focus]{.mark}** from the
**human-centric** to a **more-than-human co-survival**.]{.underline} It
also requires a fundamental shift in understanding our human culture, in
which the very epistemic and rational acts of sundering from co-survival
with the planet and environment takes place. [In the end, you
realise]{.underline}, as Raimon Panikkar has articulated, ["it is not
realistic to toil for peace if we do not proceed to a disarmament of the
bellicose culture in which we live."]{.underline}17 Or, as Geshe Lhakdor
suggests, there must be "inner disarmament for external disarmament."18
In this sense, it is within the cultural arena, our human society, where
the entanglement of subjective meaning making, nature and politics
occurs, that we need to disarm. It is 1982, and you are reading Jonathan
Schell\'s The Fate of the Earth on a Sydney bus. Sleeping has not been
easy over the past few nights as you reluctantly but compulsively read
about the consequences of nuclear war. For some critics, Schell\'s
account is high polemic, but for you it is more like Rabindranath
Tagore: it expresses the suffering we make for ourselves. What you find
noteworthy is that although Schell\'s scenario of widespread destruction
of the planet through nuclear weaponry, of immeasurable harm to the
bio-sphere through radiation, is powerfully laid out, the horror and
scale of nuclear obliteration also seems surreal and far away as the bus
makes its way through the suburban streets. A few years later, you read
a statement from an interview with Paul Tibbets, the pilot of "Enola
Gay," the plane that bombed Hiroshima. He says, "The morality of
dropping that bomb was not my business."19 This abstraction from moral
responsibility -- the denial of the implications on human life and the
consequences of engagement through the machinery of war -- together with
the sweeping amnesia that came afterwards from thinking about the
bombing of Hiroshima, are what make you become an environmental and
human rights activist. You realise that [what **makes the nuclear
algorithm work** involves a politically engineered and deeply embedded
insecurity-based recipe to **elide the nuclear threat from everyday
life**. The spectre of [nuclear obliteration]{.mark}]{.underline}, like
the idea of human rights, [[can appear **abstract**]{.mark} and
**distant**, **[not our]{.mark} everyday
[business]{.mark}**]{.underline}. You realise that [within [this]{.mark}
recipe [is the creation of a **moral tyranny of distance**]{.mark}, an
abnegation of myself with the other. One of modernity\'s greatest and
earliest achievements was the mediation of the self with the world. How
this became a project assisted and shaped through the
military-industrial-technological-capitalist complex is fraught and hard
to untangle. But as a critical]{.underline} human rights [scholar [you
have]{.mark} come [to **see through that** ]{.mark}**complex**,
[and]{.mark} you [put energies into **challenging that tyranny of
distance**]{.mark}, to activate a **politics**, **ethics** and
**scholarship that recognises the other as integral to
yourself**]{.underline}. Ultimately, even, to see that the other is also
within.20

### Util

#### Util first\-\--sole-focus on ethical purity is complicity with injustice 

**Issac 2** (Jeffrey C. Isaac, James H. Rudy Professor of Political
Science and Director of the Center for the Study of Democracy and Public
Life at Indiana University, Spring 2002, Dissent, Vol. 49, No. 2)

As writers such as Niccolo Machiavelli, Max Weber, Reinhold Niebuhr, and
Hannah Arendt have taught, an [[unyielding concern with moral goodness
**undercuts**]{.mark} **political
[responsibility]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The concern may be morally
laudable, reflecting a kind of personal integrity, but it suffers from
three fatal flaws: (1) [It fails to see that [the **purity of**]{.mark}
**one\'s [intention does not ensure]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
[[achievement]{.mark} of what one intends.]{.underline} Abjuring
violence or refusing to make common cause with morally compromised
parties may seem like the right thing; but [if such tactics entail
impotence,]{.underline} then [[it is hard to view them as
serving]{.mark} any [moral good **beyond the clean conscience**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[supporters;]{.underline}]{.mark} (2) it
fails to see that [[in a world of **real violence**]{.underline}]{.mark}
and injustice, [moral [purity is]{.mark}]{.underline} not simply a form
of powerlessness; it is often a form of [**[complicity in
injustice]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is why, from the standpoint of
politics\--as opposed to religion\--pacifism is always a potentially
immoral stand. In categorically repudiating violence, it refuses in
principle to oppose certain violent injustices with any effect; and (3)
it fails to see that politics is as much about unintended consequences
as it is about intentions; [it is [the **effects**]{.mark} **of
action**, [rather than]{.mark} the **[motives]{.mark} of action,** that
[is]{.mark} **most [significant]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Just as the
alignment with \"good\" may engender impotence, it is often the pursuit
of \"good\" that generates evil. This is the lesson of communism in the
twentieth century: it is not enough that one\'s goals be sincere or
idealistic; it is equally important, always, to ask about the effects of
pursuing these goals and to judge these effects in pragmatic and
historically contextualized ways. [[Moral
absolutism]{.underline}]{.mark} inhibits this judgment. It alienates
those who are not true believers. It **[[promotes
arrogance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[And]{.underline}]{.mark} it
[**[undermines]{.mark}** political
**[effectiveness.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Prefer utilitarianism -- the only ethical rubric is to maximize number of lives saved---solvency defecits prove they default to a utilitarian logic

**Greene 10** (Joshua, Associate Professor of the Social Sciences
Department of Psychology Harvard University, Moral Psychology:
Historical and Contemporary Readings, "The Secret Joke of Kant's Soul",
www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/\~lchang/material/Evolutionary/Developmental/Greene-KantSoul.pdf)

[What]{.underline} [turn-of-the-millennium science]{.underline} [is
telling us]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [that]{.underline}
[human]{.underline} [[moral judgment is not]{.mark} a]{.underline}
[pristine]{.underline} [[rational]{.mark} enterprise]{.underline}, that
our [moral [judgments are driven by]{.mark} a hodgepodge of
[emotion]{.mark}al dispositions, which themselves were shaped by a
hodgepodge of evolutionary forces, both biological and
cultural]{.underline}. [Because of this, [it is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}**[exceedingly [unlikely]{.mark} that [there is
any]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[rationally]{.underline}**
**[[coherent]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[normative]{.underline}** **[moral
[theory that can accommodate]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[our]{.underline}** **[moral [intuitions]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Moreover, [anyone who claims to have such a theory]{.underline}, or even
part of one, **[almost certainly doesn\'t]{.underline}**. Instead, what
that person probably has is a moral rationalization.¶ It seems then,
that we have somehow crossed the infamous \"is\"-\"ought\" divide. How
did this happen? Didn\'t Hume (Hume, 1978) and Moore (Moore, 1966) warn
us against trying to derive an \"ought\" from and \"is?\" How did we go
from descriptive scientific theories concerning moral psychology to
skepticism about a whole class of normative moral theories? The answer
is that we did not, as Hume and Moore anticipated, attempt to derive an
\"ought\" from and \"is.\" That is, our method has been inductive rather
than deductive. We have inferred on the basis of the available evidence
that the phenomenon of rationalist deontological philosophy is best
explained as a rationalization of evolved emotional intuition (Harman,
1977).[¶ Missing the Deontological Point]{.underline} I suspect that
[rationalist]{.underline} [deontologists will remain
unmoved]{.underline} [by the arguments presented here]{.underline}.
Instead, I suspect, [they]{.underline} [will insist that I
have]{.underline} **[simply misunderstood]{.underline}**
**[what]{.underline}**Kant and like-minded
**[deontologists]{.underline}** **[are all about]{.underline}**.
[Deontology, they will say, isn\'t about this intuition or that
intuition]{.underline}. It\'s not defined by its normative differences
with consequentialism. [Rather, deontology is about taking humanity
seriously]{.underline}. Above all else, it\'s about respect for persons.
It\'s about treating others as fellow rational creatures rather than as
mere objects, about acting for reasons rational beings can share. And so
on (Korsgaard, 1996a; Korsgaard, 1996b).[This is, no doubt, how many
deontologists see deontology. But this [insider\'s]{.mark}
[view]{.mark}]{.underline}, as I\'ve suggested, **[may be
misleading]{.underline}**. [The problem]{.underline}, more specifically,
**[is that it [defines deontology in terms of values that are
not]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[distinctively]{.underline}**
**[[deontological]{.underline}]{.mark}**, though they may appear to be
from the inside. [Consider the following analogy with religion. When one
asks a religious person to explain the essence of his religion, one
often gets an answer like this: \"It\'s about love]{.underline}, really.
It\'s about looking out for other people, looking beyond oneself. It\'s
about community, being part of something larger than oneself.\" [This
sort of answer accurately captures the phenomenology of many people\'s
religion, but it\'s nevertheless inadequate for distinguishing religion
from other things]{.underline}. This is because many, if not most,
non-religious people aspire to love deeply, look out for other people,
avoid self-absorption, have a sense of a community, and be connected to
things larger than themselves. In other words, secular humanists and
atheists can assent to most of what many religious people think religion
is all about. From a secular humanist\'s point of view, in contrast,
what\'s distinctive about religion is its commitment to the existence of
supernatural entities as well as formal religious institutions and
doctrines. And they\'re right. These things really do distinguish
religious from non-religious practices, though they may appear to be
secondary to many people operating from within a religious point of
view. In the same way, I believe that most of [the standard]{.underline}
[deontological/Kantian self-characterizatons]{.underline} **[fail to
distinguish deontology from other approaches to ethics]{.underline}**.
(See also Kagan (Kagan, 1997, pp. 70-78.) on the difficulty of defining
deontology.) It seems to me that
[[consequentialists]{.underline}]{.mark}, as much as anyone else,
**[have [respect]{.mark} for [persons]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
[are]{.underline} **[against treating people as]{.underline}**
**[mere]{.underline}** **[objects,]{.underline}** [wish]{.underline}
[**to act for reasons that rational creatures can share**,
etc]{.underline}. [A consequentialist respects other persons, and
refrains from treating them as mere objects,]{.underline}
[[by]{.underline} **[counting every person\'s well-being]{.underline}**
**[in the decision-making process]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Likewise,
a]{.underline} [consequentialist]{.underline} [attempts to act according
to reasons that rational creatures can share by acting according
to]{.underline} [principles]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [**give
equal weight to everyone\'s interests**, i.e. that are
impartial]{.underline}. This is not to say that consequentialists and
deontologists don\'t differ. They do. It\'s just that the real
differences may not be what deontologists often take them to be. What,
then, distinguishes deontology from other kinds of moral thought? A good
strategy for answering this question is to start with concrete
disagreements between deontologists and others (such as
consequentialists) and then work backward in search of deeper
principles. This is what I\'ve attempted to do with the trolley and
footbridge cases, and other instances in which deontologists and
consequentialists disagree. [[If you ask]{.mark} a
deontologically-minded]{.underline} [person [why it\'s wrong to push
someone]{.mark} in front of]{.underline} [speeding]{.underline}
[trolley]{.underline} [in order]{.underline} [[to save five]{.mark}
others]{.underline}, you will getcharacteristically deontological
[[answers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some [**[will be]{.underline}**
[tautological:]{.underline}]{.mark} [**\"Because it\'s murder!\"**Others
will be more sophisticated: \"The ends don\'t justify the
means]{.underline}.\" \"You have to respect people\'s rights.\"
**[But]{.underline}**, as we know, [these answers don\'t really explain
anything]{.underline}, because [if you give the same people]{.underline}
(on different occasions) [the trolley case]{.underline} or the loop case
(See above), **[they\'ll make the opposite judgment]{.underline}**, even
though their initial explanation concerning the footbridge case applies
equally well to one or both of these cases. [Talk about
rights,]{.underline} [respect for persons, and reasons we can
share]{.underline} [are natural attempts to explain, in \"cognitive\"
terms, what we feel]{.underline} [when we find ourselves having
emotionally driven intuitions that are odds with the cold calculus of
consequentialism]{.underline}. Although these explanations are
inevitably incomplete, **[[there seems to be]{.mark} \"something deeply
[right]{.mark}\" about them]{.underline}** [**[because they give voice
to]{.mark} powerful [moral emotions]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[But]{.mark}, as with many religious people\'s accounts of what\'s
essential to religion,]{.underline} [they [don\'t]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[really]{.underline} [[explain]{.mark} what\'s distinctive
about]{.underline} [[the]{.mark} philosophy in
[question]{.mark}]{.underline}.

# Energy assistance DA

### 1nc -- energy assistance

#### Alaskan rural renewable energy integration is increasing due to the Denali Commission

Tim **Lydon**, 20**24** -- staff writer "Alaska 2.0" Alaska Magazine,
10/17, <https://alaskamagazine.com/authentic-alaska/alaska-2-0/> //DH

Additionally, in March [the Department of Energy announced funding for
renewables and grid upgrades in five rural Alaska regions]{.underline}
where exorbitant energy costs impact every aspect of life. [The projects
include solar, heat pumps, battery storage, and hydro development that
will benefit dozens of communities]{.underline} from Southeast to the
Arctic.

"[Many of Alaska's rural communities are not energy
secure]{.underline}," says Joselyn Fenton, director of programs at the
Denali Commission. She explains that [rural communities often rely on
diesel to feed aging energy grids that lack redundancies]{.underline}.
The catastrophic loss of land to thawing and erosion---called usteq in
Yup'ik---also stresses energy systems, she says.

T[he Denali Commission is **intricately involved** in rural development
throughout Alaska and will facilitate projects]{.underline} supported by
both federal laws. [Fenton]{.underline} [also calls the **funding
unprecedented**]{.underline}. She says the [investments in]{.underline}
broadband, water, [energy,]{.underline} and transportation [will help
rural Alaskans]{.underline} attain comforts other Alaskans have enjoyed
for decades.

#### Funding demands tradeoff -- forcing the Commission to provide climate adaptation assistance guts the renewable energy program

Garrett **Boyle,** 20**22** -- Federal Co-Chair of the Denali
Commission. Comments submitted to the GAO. ALASKA NATIVE ISSUES Federal
Agencies Could Enhance Support for Native Village Efforts to Address
Environmental Threats, US Government Accountability Office, May,
<https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-22-104241.pdf> //DH

3\. The Commission agrees with GAO\'s recommendation that we should
\"identify options for providing additional technical assistance that is
specifically designed to help Alaska Native Villages navigate and obtain
assistance from the variety of potentially available federal programs.\"
However, [[we do not agree that we should reprioritize our available
resources]{.mark} to a great degree solely [to provide technical
assistance]{.mark}.]{.underline} [While the Commission will remain
engaged in assisting Alaska Native Villages, including by continuing to
provide technical assistance, our statutory purview is quite broad, and
[there are several programs in which the Commission plays a key role -
indeed, one that no other federal agency does]{.mark}]{.underline}, or
would assume in the Commission\'s absence. [[The Commission cannot
reprioritize its available resources to the degree that the
reprioritization negatively impacts other program areas,]{.underline}
[when other federal agencies receive far more funding that is available
for use in **assisting villages with environmental
threats**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, [but **none** to]{.mark}, for example,
[help build renewable energy projects in rural
Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline} or train diesel technicians to maintain
rural powerhouses. Further, as noted in the report, the Commission has
provided funding, in the amount of \$1,356 million, to the Center for
Environmentally Threatened Communities to assist communities in
precisely the way GAO is recommending. [The agency is also engaged in
construction projects and other means of assisting these communities,
and [those efforts would be detrimentally impacted if resources were
reprioritized to technical assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Commission also thinks that it should not be the sole responsibility of
the Commission to provide technical assistance on behalf of 31 programs
across 10 agencies. Other agencies should participate in providing
technical assistance to access their programs.

#### Renewable energy is the vital internal link to genuine Native sovereignty and breaking from colonialism

Local-Level Action: Networks of Agency in Remote Alaska Native Villages

The final scale studied is one that is often overlooked in the path
creation of renewable energy -- small-scale communities, and
specifically here remote Alaska Native villages. Here, [Alaskan remote
village energy systems were made sustainable in relation to Native
agency by Alaskan communities]{.underline}. As Howitt16) observes,
"sustainable Indigenous futures in communities and territories that are
remote from mainstream markets and other institutional arrangements
cannot arise from policy interventions" that rely on programs that
promote a trickle down of wealth to local Indigenous communities for
sustainable development. But what Howitt and other scholars miss is that
[the path creation in Alaska remote energy systems is a two-way exchange
where **both** government and community have agency]{.underline}.
[Remote Native communities were not passive actors]{.underline} in this
time frame; rather, [they were empowered with agency and a vision for
the future to pursue renewable energy sources as a means of further
defining energy sovereignty on their terms]{.underline}. If agency is
understood to be temporal it requires aspirations for the future,
sense-making of the past, and a conceptualization and strategy for what
is transpiring in the present. As Stewart et al. note, "the transition
to a low carbon economy provides potential opportunities for Indigenous
communities living in remote areas".17) [These communities have a high
carbon footprint due to "a frequent reliance on diesel-powered
electricity generators]{.underline} \[and\] fossil-fueled vehicles."
Some remote Indigenous communities are responding to this reliance on
fossil fuels by pursuing innovative and sustainable approaches to
meeting their energy needs, Alaska Natives included.18)

But more than an opportunity for electrical power transitions, [[making
local energy systems sustainable is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a chance
for **political power transformations**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Much like
Whyte19) argues in his writings on Indigenous food sovereignty,
[[renewable energy implementation is more than an aspiration of
self-sufficiency, lowering costs, and raising public health
standards]{.mark}. [Making energy systems sustainable is relational to
Alaska Native sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} [[-- it is a strategy for
communities to **cultivate and repair social, cultural, and economic
relationships that were damaged by colonialism**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In a guide to restoring energy and food sovereignty in Native America, a
publication of Honor the Earth,20) [[the call to pursing energy
sovereignty through localized, low carbon production is]{.mark} framed
as [a decision about]{.mark} a future path by [breaking the cycle of
dependency:]{.mark}]{.underline} "We must decide whether we want to
determine our own future or lease it out for royalties. In the end,
developing food and energy sovereignty is a means to determine our own
destiny." Here, sustainability embodies the contours set forth by the
editors of this volume. [[Implementing sustainable energy systems in
Native communities is a political struggle between competition visions
of the future -- a vision of dependency,]{.mark} both on oil and [on
colonial systems of power, versus a vision of independence, wherein
communities are able to create their own futures using renewable energy
generation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Though the action to make an
energy system sustainable transpires at the local level, sustainability,
in the form of renewable energy, intervenes in the discursive struggle
at the state level in Alaska over the future allocation of energy
rights, resources, and Native sovereignty.

For fiscal year 2024, [the Commission will be making awards]{.underline}
that total just [over \$32 million, of which 93 percent will go to
disadvantaged areas, with **most of the funding going to tribal
governments** or tribal consortia]{.underline}. The Denali Commission
aims to address the challenges presented by Alaska\'s geography and
sparse population, and focuses on preparing projects by providing
planning or design assistance, gap funding when projects experience
unexpected cost increases or delays, or contributing to a community\'s
non-federal local match requirement. In these areas where the
infrastructure base is frequently decades behind most of the country,
municipalities often do not have tax authority and there is not much to
tax even if it did. We appreciate the consideration of lowering local
match requirements for distressed, tribal, and Alaska Native villages.

[The Denali Commission]{.underline} and other regional commissions [have
the unique authorities]{.underline} and tools and are [best positioned
to support disadvantaged populations]{.underline}, including i[n rural
areas]{.underline}. Commission appropriations and transfers have ebbed
and flowed over the years, from a high of \$67 million to a low of \$10
million. [In the last six years, the Commission has **expanded its
program offerings**]{.underline}, diversifying back into its legacy
programs and [adding new programs to reflect critical
needs]{.underline}, the public funding available at the time, and to
leverage partnership opportunities. [The Commission invests in rural
Alaska throug]{.underline}h core program areas such as [power
generation]{.underline}, bulk fuel storage, transportation, housing,
water and sanitation, health facilities, broadband, workforce
development, and the protection of these public investments through
hazard mitigation. Over the life of the Commission, we have modified
programs to reflect the needs and the public funding available at the
time. There are three ways we facilitate investments:

1\) Priority lists, such as the Rural Power System Upgrade program,/2
Bulk Fuel Upgrade Program,/3 Statewide Threat Assessment for communities
facing environmental threats, Sanitation Deficiency System, and in the
early 2000s a list for rural primary care clinics;

2\) Annual competitive funding opportunity announcements; and

3\) Individual discretionary funding through justifications,
partnerships, and transfers.

Allow me to share some highlights of impacts that reflect the
administration\'s goals or describe innovative partnerships:

Energy: [The energy program focuses on remote power system upgrades
while **incorporating renewables.**]{.underline} A [recently completed
900-kilowatt wind turbine and connection to the existing electrical
distribution system]{.underline} between Stebbins and St. Michael [now
provides fluctuation-resistant wind energy, offsetting hundreds of
gallons of diesel each year]{.underline} and facilitating days of
\"diesel-off\" operation for both communities.

#### Denali Commission ambassadors are providing technical assistance for tribal rural energy projects now

Nils **Andreassen**, 20**24** -- executive director of the Alaska
Municipal League"Rural Alaska's energy challenges were at the center of
a revived conference" 10/19, Alaska Beacon,
<https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/10/09/rural-alaskas-energy-challenges-were-at-the-center-of-a-revived-conference/>
//DH

The U.S. Department of Energy had a strong presence, highlighting their
programs and priorities. [A unique aspect for Alaska was the Arctic
Energy Ambassadors -- a program of the DOE Arctic Energy
Office]{.underline}, administered by AML and **[delivered through the
Denali Commission]{.underline}**. [These 12 ambassadors come from across
the state with the purpose of advancing local and regional energy
projects]{.underline}.

[Rural utility operators and municipal and tribal officials expressed
how valuable it was to have access to information tailored to their
circumstances]{.underline}, thanks to input from partners like the
Alaska Power Association. With 50 travel scholarships available, rural
participation was a priority, ensuring many could attend who otherwise
wouldn't have been able to. The event wouldn't have been possible
without the support of dozens of sponsors, exhibitors, and partners.

Several themes emerged during the conference. First, [many utilities are
grappling with aging diesel powerhouses and bulk fuel issues, even as
they push to add renewables]{.underline} and battery systems [to
microgrids]{.underline}. The challenge is finding funding not just for
clean energy but for maintaining the security of these foundational
systems.

[Another theme was the rise of independent power producers]{.underline},
particularly [as a tool for tribal self-determination]{.underline}. The
key question is how these shifts can translate into community benefits,
particularly in terms of affordability. [There's a lot of interest in
how partners and communities will approach this to truly lower energy
costs]{.underline}.

### AT: Funding is small

#### Direct funding is small, but the Denali Commission leverages other actors to provide matching funds

[The Denali Commission Act was expanded to allow for the Commission to
accept funding from other federal agencies]{.underline}. \[6\] [This has
been extremely beneficial for Alaska as once the funds are transferred
to the Commission, they do not expire until funds are completely
expended]{.underline}. [Funding sources that expire at the end of a
fiscal year can easily be lost if weather or logistical delays push out
project timelines]{.underline}. [Denali Commission's role in preserving
funds was commonly mentioned as **critical to Alaska
communities**]{.underline}.

#### Its technical expertise and non-federal match abilities make it more effective than other agencies

[The Denali Commission was frequently brought up as a trusted
organization that manages effective programs, serves as a conduit for a
variety of funding sources and has comparatively stable leadership
regardless of changes in political party]{.underline} control [at state
and federal levels]{.underline}. [The Commission has a reputation of
focusing on coordination and working well with multiple state agencies
and technical assistance providers]{.underline}. Conversely,
organizations that are subject to funding and priority fluctuation from
changing administrations were not recommended as stability and
consistency are highly valued for long-term planning and operations.

Organizations with lower administrative overhead are preferred unless
there is a specific set of expertise not available form lower-cost
providers. Another preference is for providers who are organized for
rapid response to technical assistance, especially for projects and
systems already in operation. Partnerships are also key such that
organizations that are successful in building partnerships are seen as
more sustainable than simply choosing the smartest person or
organization in the state. ACEP, REAP and USDA Rural Development were
mentioned as examples of partnership-centric organizations.

[A general suggestion]{.underline} from several respondents [is to
create a collaborative effort to ensure that no money is left on the
table for the myriad of funding opportunities available to Alaskan
communities.]{.underline} Chad Stovall described such an organization in
this manner:

> ""Have the Denali Commission lead a public private partnership with
> statewide organizations like the Alaska Municipal League and our
> university system. Every month or quarter meet to monitor funding
> available for everything from subsistence rights, energy, and climate
> change. Catalog the funding and how that money can be accessed. Create
> a support group of federal, state, and nonprofits to become
> vehicles/applicants, building dialogue throughout the process. This
> process could help us better understand questions like: Where is
> Alaska uniquely competitive? How can we do better than our
> competitors? How to build sustainable customer service platforms that
> build capacity at each level?

[Denali Commission has the benefit of providing non-federal match
dollars for grants. The Commission also has a reputation of less red
tape]{.underline} or bureaucracy.

### AT: DOGE kills Denali Commission

#### Empirically -- Congress will protect it from Trump

Charles S. **Clark,** 20**17** - Senior Correspondent, Government
Executive "None of the 19 Agencies Trump Sought to Abolish Appears in
Danger" Government Executive, 8/30,
<https://www.govexec.com/management/2017/08/none-19-agencies-trump-sought-abolish-appears-danger/140628/>
//DH

The [Trump]{.underline} White House surprised many back in March when
its "skinny [budget" proposed]{.underline} streamlining government by
[zeroing out funding for 19 small agencies]{.underline} that candidate
Trump never mentioned during the 2016 presidential campaign.

They included everything from perennial targets of the right, such as
the National Endowment for the Arts and the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting, to narrowly focused agencies unfamiliar to most in
political debate, [like the Denali Commission]{.underline} and the
African Development Foundation.

Now, with Congress behind schedule on appropriations as it prepares for
a September packed with must-do tasks, the state of play for the whole
list is pretty clear: none of the 19 appears sentenced to be shuttered.
(One small agency, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, was
targeted for shutdown by the House only.)

In theory, some agencies could still be targeted by Sept. 30, the
deadline for Congress to act to fund the entire government. As usual,
lawmakers will likely rely on a continuing resolution to do that.

As of Aug. 8, the House had approved only a third of the 12 major
spending bills (though all have emerged from the Appropriations
Committee). The Senate, by contrast, has yet to take a single floor vote
on fiscal 2018 spending bills, while its appropriations panel has
disgorged only half the big bills.

Reasons for the apparent reprieve for the 19 range from an Office of
Management and Budget approach to its budget that did not stress
consultation with Congress, to some pushback by the agencies working
with their Capitol Hill patrons. In the case of the National Endowment
for the Humanities, Chairman William Adams resigned in May after just
three years in order to pursue a project defending the value of the
humanities to society.

In some cases, Trump may have changed his mind. In June, he buoyed the
once-doomed, self-sustaining Overseas Private Investment Corp. by
nominating a president and CEO (Ray Willets Washburne) and an executive
vice president (David Bohigian). Both were confirmed by the Senate on
Aug. 4.

In other instances, [congressional appropriators openly rejected the
president's proposals. The Senate panel's]{.underline} July 20
[report]{.underline} on the Energy and Water spending bill, for example,
[reads:]{.underline}

"[The \[Trump\] budget request proposes to eliminate]{.underline}
several independent agencies, including the Appalachian Regional
Commission, Delta Regional Authority, [Denali Commission]{.underline},
and Northern Border Regional Commission. The budget requests funding to
conduct closeout of the agencies in fiscal year 2018. [The committee
strongly opposes the termination]{.underline} of these agencies, [and
recommends funding to continue their activities]{.underline}. The
administration shall continue all activities funded by this act, as well
as follow directive language included in this report. No funds shall be
used for the planning of or implementation of termination of these
agencies."

### U -- Renewables solve now

#### Alaskan Native communities are making substantial progress on renewable energy integration

//DH

[Remote Alaskan communities have and will continue to lead in
community-based renewable energy development]{.underline}, serving as an
example for similar communities throughout the world. [Many communities
have excellent wind, solar,]{.underline} hydropower or biomass
[resources waiting to be used]{.underline}. [Sixty-nine Alaskan
communities have so far integrated some form of renewable
energy]{.underline} (McMahon et al. 2022), and between 2014 and 2018,
5,210 households in rural Alaska received building energy efficiency
improvements to reduce overall energy demand (Alaska Housing Finance
Corporation 2018). [A variety of funding sources and programs are
available to support communities in the complex transition to renewable
energy]{.underline}.

#### Alaskan renewable energy is accelerating rapidly

Lesil **McGuire**, 20**24** - Lesil McGuire, Charisse Millett and Harry
Crawford are former Republican and Democrat state legislators. They are
senior advisors to New Energy Alaska, a broad coalition of Alaskans
working to bring the benefits of clean energy to Alaska. "Alaska is on

//DH

Amidst the wild ride of recent national headlines, it's easy to miss
some big stories --- and even easier to miss the broader pattern. So
here's the bottom line: [Alaska is entering a new era of energy growth,
fueled by our massive renewable resources]{.underline}.

Southeast Conference and Alaska HeatSmart recently secured \$38 million
in federal funds to bring air-source heat pumps to 6,100 homes in
Southeast and Southcentral Alaska. Alaska HeatSmart has already helped
more than 100 households install heat pumps, reducing household heating
bills by 25-50% using clean local energy.

In the Interior, Golden Valley Electric Association was awarded a \$100
million federal loan --- with \$60 million forgiven --- to install a
battery energy storage system and interconnectivity for a 16 MW solar
farm at Nenana. Doyon Ltd., a regional Alaska Native corporation, is a
partner in the project, which has potential to be a game-changer in a
region that experiences the highest energy costs along the Railbelt.

[The Alaska Energy Authority and Tanana Chiefs Conference were awarded
\$62 million each in federal funds to install solar technology
statewide]{.underline}, saving households money and creating new jobs.
"This program will not only offer Alaskans further access to renewable
energy, but also provide funding to develop the local Alaskan
workforce," the U.S. Environmental Protect said in awarding the funds.

[Across Alaska, communities have long harnessed wind, geothermal,
hydroelectric and solar energy.]{.underline} [Alaska is endowed with
some of the most abundant clean-energy resources on the planet --- and
we now have access to the funding, technology, and policy tools to
develop them at scale]{.underline}.

[Alaska ranks No. 1 in the U.S. in installed microgrid
capacity,]{.underline} and we are recognized as a global innovator in
microgrid technology. [In rural Alaska, we are ready to overhaul
our]{.underline} rickety, risky, costly [diesel systems
with]{.underline} the integration of [clean]{.underline} and reliable
local [energy.]{.underline}

On the Railbelt, renewables offer the best opportunity to stabilize
long-term costs and supply risks. A recent report from the U.S.
Department of Energy found that a 76% renewable system is the cheapest
way to power Alaska's Railbelt, the interconnected grid running from
Homer to Fairbanks. Renewables can provide steady, stable, local
generation, reducing our dependence on dwindling Cook Inlet natural gas
supplies --- critical for staving off the need to import natural gas.

[Gov]{.underline}. Mike [Dunleavy recently signed legislation providing
funding and policy tools to smooth the path for renewables]{.underline}.
These include a bill and initial matching funds to facilitate
transmission and governance improvements on the Railbelt grid --- to
make sure the cheapest energy can get to consumers. The governor also
signed a bill creating the Alaska Energy Independence Fund to help
residents and businesses finance energy efficiency and clean energy
projects. And he's set to sign legislation allowing for community-owned
renewables projects, so people who don't own homes can get a share of
the financial benefits of solar.

## Impact

### Impact -- structural violence

#### Dependence on diesel microgrids creates energy poverty and reinforces structural violence

capacity for community appropriate sustainable energy transitions in
northern and remote Indigenous communities" Renewable and Sustainable

//DH

[Energy systems across the circumpolar north are a mix of centralized
grids, regional grids, and off-grid (or micro-grid)
system]{.underline}s. Across may parts of the north, [low population
densities limit the viability of large-scale energy
infrastructure]{.underline} \[24\]. [[Most communities are remote, not
connected to a centralized grid, and are powered by diesel generators
that rely on seasonal fuel delivery, resulting in **high energy
costs**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[6,25\]. In Canada\'s northern
territories, for example, electricity prices are significantly higher
than the rest of the country -- even with large government subsidies
\[8\]. The Canadian average electricity price is approximately CDN
\$0.12 per kWh. In Nunavut, where power generation is diesel-based and
homes are heated primarily by fuel oil, subsidized residential rates
range from CDN \$0.60 per kWh to over CDN \$1.15 per kWh. The Qulliq
Energy Corporation, which powers 25 communities across Nunavut (38,000
people), requires approximately 55 million litres of diesel annually
\[26\]. The challenge is similar in the Northwest Territories, where 25
of the 33 primarily Indigenous communities powered by the Crown energy
provider are off-grid and diesel dependent \[27\].

[[High fuel prices]{.mark}, limited seasonal fuel supplies, [and aging
and costly energy infrastructure operating at or near capacity can
impose significant social and economic constraints]{.mark} for many
northern and remote Indigenous communities]{.underline} \[28,29\].
[[Meeting basic energy needs in the North is a significant financial
burden on many households, with implications for food-security --
residents are]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[forced to choose between
"**heating or eating**]{.underline}]{.mark}" \[23\]. In the remote
Alaskan community of Galena, Menghwani et al. \[8\] show that the high
cost of diesel-based power generation was a primary driver behind the
community\'s pursuit of a bioenergy facility. The bioenergy facility
subsequently led to reduced power costs, increased reliability, and the
training of a local workforce resulting in new employment and income
opportunities \[111\]. In other regions[, [high government subsidies for
diesel-based generation to offset high energy costs]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- subsidies that range between \$300 and \$400 million annually in
Canada\'s North \[70\] -- [[translate to the loss of resources that
could otherwise be **used to invest in community infrastructure and
social services**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[16\].

There is increasing government interest in renewable energy in the
north, as illustrated by state commitments to renewable energy
infrastructure and pursuit of a low carbon future \[30,31\]. High energy
costs coupled with fuel price volatility and seasonal supply
vulnerability also mean a growing interest in renewable energy amongst
northern and remote communities to ensure access to affordable,
reliable, and secure energy solutions \[6,32\].
[[Across]{.underline}]{.mark} the state of
[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [[69 communities have
integrated some form of renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark} \[112\].
Renewable energy systems (e.g., solar, wind, biomass) are also being
deployed to offset diesel-based generation in some regions across
Canada\'s north. For example, in the Northwest Territories, an 85-kW
biomass boiler was installed in the community of Fort McPherson in 2013
\[33\], and the Hamlet of Aklavik currently offsets a portion of its
diesel dependency with a 52-kW solar system.

[Community energy planning is an emerging trend globally, where local
communities are increasingly involved in planning their energy
future]{.underline} \[32,34\]. However, most energy planning processes
in rural and remote regions continue to rely on top-down, externally
driven approaches, often without consideration of local socio-cultural
context, values, and capacities \[9,21\]. [The pursuit, design, and
implementation of community energy projects that fail to incorporate
local values and the capacity of communities to transition and maintain
their energy system are less likely to [succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[18,35,36\]. Yet, despite a growing literature examining Indigenous
community involvement in renewable energy \[18,36\], there is limited to
no attention to community socio-technical capacity for energy transition
among northern Indigenous communities \[6,24,28,37\].

#### Energy security is the most important dimension of human security because it impacts food storage and clean water

Yasmeen **Hossain**, 20**16** -- University of Alaska Fairbanks, PhD in
Sustainable Development "Defining energy security in the rural
North---Historical and contemporary perspectives from Alaska" Energy
Research & Social Science Volume 16, June 2016, Science Direct, Accessed
via University of Michigan //DH

Energy security is an oft-discussed but rarely elaborated upon component
of environmental security and community sustainability \[1\], \[2\]. Its
importance has been elevated by research on the so-called
food-water-energy nexus \[1\], \[3\], but questions remain regarding
what exactly constitutes energy security at the household, community, or
regional level, as compared to global and national levels where energy
security primarily involves whether state governments have control over
their energy generation and provisioning resources \[2\], \[4\], \[5\],
\[6\], \[7\]. Like its counterparts in the nexus, [energy security has
different meanings]{.underline} depending on the level and location of
analysis; [energy security in rural areas often involves different
features than in urban ones, and]{.underline} household and [community
energy security have little in common with energy security when
construed in a militaristic or statist sense.]{.underline} [For a rural
community, energy security can mean resilience and self-sufficiency
through an escape from the global carbon "lock in]{.underline}" \[8\];
[for an individual, it may well mean something as simple as **being able
to survive a cold winter**]{.underline} or having a light at home so
that children can study at night \[9\], \[10\].

Sovacool and Brown \[4\] argue that [energy security may]{.underline}
ultimately [prove to be the most important component of human
environmental security]{.underline}, [in that energy influences so many
different aspects of people's lives, including **food production** and
the distribution and treatment of **drinking water.**]{.underline} As
was the case for making progress on food security research and policy
\[11\], we argue that [new place-based perspectives are needed on energy
security that scale down focus to the issues affecting individuals,
their households and livelihoods]{.underline}. As we describe below,
[this means paying attention to such diverse issues as breaking out of
historical legacies of colonialism and development and the political
ecology of energy resources]{.underline} \[12\], \[13\].

### AT: Renewables bad for grid

#### Community capacity building can overcome challenges to grid integration

Rebecca **Meadows,** 20**25** -- National Renewable Energy Lab
"Renewable Energy Integration in Remote Alaska Communities" January
<https://docs.nrel.gov/docs/fy25osti/90685.pdf> //DH

Primary [challenges]{.underline} to higher amounts of renewable energy
integration [include ensuring that the diesel generators are not
operated at too low of a load, the spinning reserve and heating
requirements of the power system are met]{.underline}, and the existing
power plant and distribution system are optimized for such integration.
**[Community capacity]{.underline}** [to operate and maintain renewable
microgrids is]{.underline} also a [critical]{.underline} consideration.

[Remote communities are employing innovative strategies and
tech]{.underline}nologies [to]{.underline} effectively [integrate
high-penetration renewable energy projects, such as advanced central
controllers, dispatchable heat loads for frequency controls, and BESS
with grid-forming inverters for storage and grid stability]{.underline}.
Prior to installing renewable energy projects, reducing line losses and
end-user consumption can be the most cost-effective first steps. A best
practice for post-commissioning of large renewable systems is to run the
renewable generation manually and at a capped capacity for several
months to troubleshoot and optimize before moving to full automation.

#### The Denali Commission is vital to community capacity building

**McKinley Research** Group, 20**23** -- Consulting firm in Anchorage
Alaska. No author listed, but the report is based on interviews with 30
individuals representing organizations in Alaska, including the Denali
Commission, seven rural tribes, 8 tribal organizations, and the US
Arctic Research Commission "ALASKA NATIVE COMMUNITIES AND THE DENALI
COMMISSION"
<https://alaskarenewableenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/AVF-Denali-Commission-Discussion-Paper-Sept-2023.pdf>
//DH

[Many cited the commission's successes. The most frequently cited
achievements were the bulk fuel storage program]{.underline} (the
commission's first major program) [and construction of village health
clinics in partnership with Alaska Native Tribal Health
Consortium.]{.underline}

[Another lauded the "phenomenal work" of the commission in advancing
relocation of the village of Newtok amidst a panoply of bureaucratic
hurdles]{.underline}, [saying, "State and federal agency
programs]{.underline} and policies **[were prohibitive]{.underline}**
[and the Denali Commission stepped in to **remove the
barriers**]{.underline} as best they could."

One interviewee said that while most federal funding programs are
designed with little thought to or understanding of rural Alaska, "[The
Denali Commission]{.underline} on the whole [is far more effective at
investing resources in a way that has a tangible benefit to
communities]{.underline} on the ground."

Unique Flexibilities

"Ted Stevens got a pretty unusual piece of legislation adopted to really
make it easier to connect state and federal agency work in a way that
reduces some of the bureaucracy. It is an important thing to continue."
Many interviewees noted [the Denali Commission has several powers and
flexibilities that are unusual among federal agencies.]{.underline}

Ability to turn lapsing money into "no-year" money

[While most federal agencies receive time-limited appropriations, the
Denali Commission's monies do not lapse or expire]{.underline}. In the
federal funding lexicon, this means money appropriated to the commission
becomes "no-year" money -- even if it is transferred to the commission
from an agency where money has a lapse date. As many pointed out, this
is a crucial tool. In a time of glut -- which Alaska is arguably
entering -- [it means monies can be appropriately paced]{.underline}.
This could enable the commission to help smooth out funding, providing
funders an opportunity to slow down and do a better job of prioritizing,
vetting, and supporting projects.

[One interviewee gave an example of a federal agency that is turning
over a chunk of money from another "highly bureaucratic" federal agency
to the Denali Commission to gain flexibility: "We can turn it into
no-year money and then slowly take the time to develop it
effectively]{.underline}." According to the interview, this partnership
with the commission will enable managers to accomplish much more with
the money.

Ability to comingle different funding streams

Several interviewees suggested the Denali Commission's relative
flexibility could enable it to serve as a funding aggregator for
projects with mixed federal funding streams.

The commission can also fill in gaps, as one interviewee said it did for
Newtok's relocation: "\[The Denali Commission\] used their funding,
which was not as limited as other federal agencies, to fill the gaps
that were preventing other state and federal agencies from implementing
what the Tribe needed."

Ability to provide "nonfederal" match

Also key is the Denali Commission's ability to provide money that
typically counts as non-federal match (regardless of its original
source) for the purposes of meeting grant requirements. Providing
matching funds helps communities that are unable to raise that money
locally and enables Denali Commission dollars to go further than if the
commission paid for 100 percent of a given project. Interviewees noted
that systems would need to be developed to address cash f low
complexities involved in providing match funding at the right time.
"This will take staff that know the communities, know the players in
rural Alaska and how to incentivize partnerships."

Ability to right-size requirements

As described in the previous section, [federal grant requirements can be
notoriously onerous, particularly for small remote
communities]{.underline} where a tribal administrator may maintain the
water system and fill in as a peace officer, and where basic amenities
are often lacking. As one interviewee said, "Some of our grantees have
to climb a hill to get a cell signal to make a call or turn things in at
the beginning of the month before the internet is shut off."

[The Denali Commission is less burdened than other federal agencies by
rules that don't make sense for rural Alaska. The commission has the
power to adjust or "right-size" requirements to minimize the barriers
rural communities face in getting the funding they need]{.underline}.

issue, and they offered reasons why such relocation should or could take
place. But almost half of these participants (again, mostly those
outside ANVs) raised points as to why this relocation might not
occur---namely the expense. As one state official said, "There's a
'should' question---who should? And then there's a 'can' question---who
can? The state government can't. [Legislators from the Lower 48 are not
going to be concerned enough about this issue to appropriate funding to
move a few people in Alaska]{.underline}."

[Lack of political will to proactively address climate change adaptation
for ANVs was the most frequently cited barrier to
adaptation]{.underline} and relocation (noted by several ANV
participants and a number of those outside of ANVs). A number of
participants (mainly outside of ANVs) said that state and [federal
decision-makers]{.underline} either [did not believe in climate
change]{.underline} or did not want to believe in it. A few said that
[these decision-makers would not take any action that could jeopardize
fossil fuel production]{.underline}. [Some referred to legislative
gridlock in Congress, as well as the limited political power of Alaska
compared to more populous states, along with the limited political power
of ANVs compared to the more populated urban regions of
Alaska]{.underline}.

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

I now turn to the issue of what change would be desirable and feasible
at the ANV level, starting with the question of whether ANVs could get
more jurisdiction over resources needed for adaptation. For the reasons
suggested by participants in favor of increasing ANV jurisdiction as
well as the principle of climate justice, I argue that there should be
more jurisdiction given to tribes of the lands that surround them and
the subsistence resources on which they depend. For example, [there
should be more meaningful subsistence co-management arrangements in
which ANVs have]{.underline} some [authority for decision-making, as
opposed to just consultation]{.underline} on decisions made by agencies
(Richmond 2013; Marine Mammal Commission 2008, p. iv; Meek et al., 2008;
Spaeder 2005, p. 173).

But, as recognized by a number of my participants, [what *should* happen
may not currently be feasible]{.underline}. I found that, particularly
among those outside of ANVs, [there is]{.underline} relatively [limited
support for changing laws to increase ANV jurisdiction.]{.underline} As
I discussed above in the context of a new over-arching law or agency,
[there is a great deal of inertia in the laws that currently control ANV
jurisdiction over land]{.underline} and wildlife management system
(Starkey 2016). For example, [despite nearly five decades of criticism
of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]{.underline}, and some
incremental amendments to adjust it, [a new settlement has not
emerged]{.underline} to take its place (Indian Law and Order Commission
2015, p. 47; Chaffee 2008, p. 129; Berger 1999, p. 105). [ANVs **lack
the political clout** to significantly change the existing
regime]{.underline} (McNeeley 2012, p. 841;

**ANVs = Alaskan Native Villages**

The majority of my participants suggested that creating [a]{.underline}
brand-[new]{.underline} overarching [federal law]{.underline} or agency
[may not be practical, regardless of how much climate change has
impacted ANVs]{.underline} and the need for climate justice. [A new
legal framework would face]{.underline} many challenges, including [the
reluctance of]{.underline} state and [federal government as well as the
public to accept responsibility for climate change]{.underline} (Berke
and Lyles 2013). 14 Even where the need for political change is
acknowledged, [there is little incentive to proactively pay adaptation
costs, especially when future risks are uncertain]{.underline} and
seemingly remote [to those in power]{.underline} (Munck af Rosenschöld
et al., 2014; Berke and Lyles 2013, p. 182; Serrao-Neumann et al., 2013,
p. 441; Moser 2013, 2009; Munaretto and Klostermann 2011, p. 220;
Kofinas and Chapin 2009, p. 72). Absent a disaster that threatens those
with political power, sudden change is unlikely (Boyd et al., 2014;
Garmestani and Benson 2013; Smit and Wandel 2006, p. 289). Congress has
not created anything resembling a new agency since the Department of
Homeland Security, which was fashioned out of existing agencies after
the September 11, 2001 disaster.

[Historically, the U.S. government has not provided proactive financial
support to communities facing]{.underline} the threat of
[climate-induced migration]{.underline}, and has opted instead for
reactive funding on a case-by-case basis.110 [Vulnerable communities in
Alaska, however, have been able to seek opportunities to fill this gap
at the **state**]{.underline} and local **[level]{.underline}**s.

[The Alaska Climate Change Impact Mitigation Program]{.underline}
(ACCIMP) [addresses the needs of communities faced with displacement.
This program provides funding and technical assistance to communities
imminently threatened by climate-related impacts]{.underline}, including
erosion, flooding, storm surge, and thawing permafrost.111 It was
created to support coastal communities vulnerable to coastal erosion.112
Funding is allocated in two categories. Noncompetitive funding is
provided to specific communities facing heightened risks of climate
change, including Kivalina and Shishmaref.113 The remaining resources
are allocated to communities based on four factors: (1) risk to safety
during storm or flood events; (2) loss of critical infrastructure;
(3) threats to public health; and (4) loss of 10% or more of residential
dwellings.114

While offering a viable approach to determine which communities require
assistance, [this state program only provides reactive support rather
than proactive assistance]{.underline}. Additionally, the listed
requirements may exclude slow-onset disasters and other cumulative
impacts of climate change that lead to climate-induced migration, as the
risks to health and safety, loss of infrastructure, and threats to
public health may not be severe enough to require assistance at a
particular point in time. This ad hoc system creates disparate impacts
and ultimately does not reach all residents of a vulnerable community,
so many have turned to local community-led efforts instead.

[Local initiatives in Alaska seek to fill the gaps that vulnerable
communities face from a lack of federal support and state-level
initiatives]{.underline} like ACCIMP that provide incomplete protection.
For example, the Alaska Community Coastal Protection Project (ACCPP)
created strategic management plans for different communities facing the
risk of climate-induced migration, including both Kivalina and
Shishmaref.115 These plans provide temporary solutions for addressing
climate risk, such as funding shoreline protection to combat coastal
erosion or assisting with infrastructure redevelopment.116 A gap in the
framework for protecting these vulnerable communities remains, however,
and support for coastal migration as a long-term solution is still
needed.117 While these efforts assist with current effects, there is no
forward-looking measure to guide residents who are forced to
relocate.118

The ACCPP has three major drawbacks.119 First, it involves a competitive
application process to secure funding, putting vulnerable communities in
competition with one another and wasting their resources by engaging in
the process with no guarantee of receiving support.120 Second, [the
amount of funds available is far too limited,]{.underline} providing
only a temporary solution to an ongoing, systemic issue without
identifying where new funding sources may be found.121 Finally, the
absence of standards to implement the funding support squanders the
value of the well-intentioned effort, as the lack of guidance has
resulted in ad hoc and incomplete responses.122 Overall, [it is
difficult for vulnerable communities to qualify for state
assistance]{.underline}, and relocation programs are underdeveloped
despite the increasingly dangerous conditions for residents each day.123

#### A 3.1 percent sales tax that includes services can raise 1 billion a year for Alaska without harming its economy

Jared **Walczak**, 20**20** -- Vice President of State Projects at the
Tax Foundation "Navigating Alaska's Fiscal Crisis"
<https://taxfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Navigating-Alaskas-Fiscal-Crisis.pdf>
//DH

[Should Alaska consider a major new tax, the sales tax has its
attractions]{.underline}. Because the tax is largely collected by
retailers, not individuals, tax administrators deal with far fewer
payors---a genuine concern in a large, sparsely populated state where
administration and enforcement can be costly. [Because it is imposed on
consumption rather than on labor]{.underline} (in contrast to an
individual income tax), [its economic impact is smaller and collections
are less volatile than under an income tax]{.underline}. [An
above-average portion of the sales tax can be exported to nonresidents
in a state like Alaska, which swells with]{.underline} both [tourists
and seasonal workers]{.underline} domiciled elsewhere. And, while it is
equal parts challenge and opportunity, adopting [a state sales tax would
also provide a chance to unify the collection and administration of
local sales taxes, easing burdens on sellers and facilitating online
sales tax collections.]{.underline}

How Much Could a Sales Tax Raise?

With all taxes, collections are a function of both the rate of tax and
the base on which that tax is imposed. As discussed later, sales tax
bases in most states have been eroding for years as a share of personal
consumption, the consequence of both (1) conscious policy choices to
carve out select transactions and (2) changes in the economy, and
particularly a greater consumption of services, which were far less
significant as a percentage of personal consumption when most state
sales taxes were designed.

In this publication, we argue that any sales tax should be imposed on a
broad base, and that Alaska, in designing a sales tax, should avoid the
carveouts and omissions that characterize sales taxes elsewhere. How
much the state could generate with a sales tax depends considerably on
sales tax breadth, since---particularly given existing local sales
taxes---there are likely practical and political, and certainly
economic, constraints on the rate.

There are two ways to think about how much Alaska could generate from a
sales tax. One is to compare Alaska to other states which already impose
a sales tax, and another is to calculate revenues directly from
statistics about state personal consumption expenditures.

[On average, states with a statewide general sales tax generate tax
revenue worth 2.3 percent of personal consumption]{.underline} in the
state (see Table 2). Were all personal consumption taxed, and nothing
else, the resulting figure would be the average state sales tax rate,
but (1) states exempt vast swaths of personal consumption, (2) states
tax a significant percentage of intermediate transactions which do not
constitute personal consumption, (3) a certain percentage of personal
consumption as reported by federal sources is

not associated with a transaction and thus not properly subject to a
sales tax,23 and (4) states never achieve full compliance.

It follows, then, that there are better and worse ways to collect taxes
equal to 2.3 percent (or any other percent) of personal consumption, and
that those with broader bases will achieve such collections with lower
rates---and a more equitable, pro-growth system of taxation. If Alaska
were, however, to match the national average, collecting state sales
taxes equivalent to 2.3 percent of state personal consumption, it would
raise about \$852 million a year. Generating \$500 million a year would
require collections equal to 1.35 percent of personal consumption, and
\$1 billion a year would require 2.7 percent.

These calculations can provide a rough sense of what Alaska can expect
based on the experience of other states. But Alaska need not be limited
to the approaches reflected in sales taxes that are, at minimum, a half
century old. It is more helpful, therefore, to build from the ground up,
projecting revenues based on what Alaska might elect to tax.

[The broadest possible well-structured sales tax base would include all
final consumption except for housing, financial services furnished
without payment, social services, religious activities, and legally or
functionally untaxable purchases like internet access]{.underline},
postal services, and other purchases from government sellers, along with
grocery purchases made with SNAP and WIC benefits. This base would
include both goods and services when purchased for final consumption,
rather than as intermediate products in the process of production. [With
this very broad sales tax base, Alaska could generate an estimated \$1
billion with a state rate as low as 3.1 percent]{.underline}, or \$500
million with a 1.6 percent rate.

### 2nc -- solvency: climate adaptation

**ACCIMP = Alaska Climate Change Impact Mitigation Program, run by the
State of Alaska**

[Given that Alaska has already taken steps to address the growing needs
of its vulnerable populations, an entirely new framework is not
needed]{.underline}. [Instead, local governments should ensure the
resources and assistance mechanisms in place actually support those in
need]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} objective [can be realized
through]{.underline} (1) the creation of eligibility criteria based on
[vulnerability assessments to determine communities that need support
and how they can best be supported;]{.underline} (2) [a proactive
response to coastal areas with vulnerable populations]{.underline};
[and]{.underline} (3) [an adaptive governance framework that includes
funding for vulnerable communities]{.underline}. [The
ACCIMP]{.underline}, which was created to support coastal communities
vulnerable to coastal erosion[, is an example of adaptive governance;
however, its funding mechanisms need to be implemented more equitably
and effectively]{.underline} to enhance the protection of threatened
communities.

To best serve residents of coastal areas, there should be an integrated
social and environmental assessment to evaluate when communities require
support and what type of support would be most beneficial. There is
federal precedent for relocating communities before disaster strikes.149
Similar proactive relocation measures could be implemented to minimize
the adverse impacts of sea-level rise. Communities can work with local
officials to communicate environmental hazards and other changes that
may lead to more severe consequences. [Currently, communities must apply
for funding, but this process should be changed to a proactive
government-initiated support program to identify needs and provide
resources to these communities]{.underline}.

The vulnerability assessment should also consider factors such as the
nature of the climate impact, the degree of exposure to the impact, and
the capacity of the vulnerable community and its socioeconomic systems
to address the issues. Additionally, [there must be an emphasis on
understanding regional vulnerability to adequately include each
community's unique needs. These assessments will also help officials
work with communities to create a systemic proactive response to
sea-level rise and provide channels of communication to mitigate issues
as they arise]{.underline}. [Addressing the threat of relocation before
it becomes dire is safer, less expensive, and will provide for more
flexibility in supporting each community's unique needs]{.underline}.

Perhaps [the most important priority for these communities is the need
to access government resources when and where they are most needed. An
adaptive governance framework provides ways for institutional
arrangements to flexibly respond to the needs and desires of the
community]{.underline} in a changing environment.150 Through this
framework, local governments can monitor changes in the environment and
provide dynamic and locally informed responses to best support the
community. An adaptive governance framework can create forward-looking
measures for residents who must relocate and provide funding, resources,
and informational toolkits to ensure those facing displacement have
adequate knowledge and support.

The adaptive governance framework should also highlight areas where
funding is most needed and how it can be best used. Relocation and flood
control are the main issues facing coastal communities, which can be
addressed with clear and accessible funding mechanisms. Rather than
create a competitive application process for limited amounts of funding
with no clear guidance on how to use the resources available, this new
framework should list concrete actions and priorities to help
communities relocate.

Yet, [relocation support should only be offered when relocation reflects
the will of the community under the circumstances that each community
faces]{.underline}. For example, from the early 2000s, the native
village of Kivalina was extremely vulnerable to coastal erosion that
threatened the safety of its community. This vulnerability prompted the
community's famous lawsuit to seek its projected \$400 million in
relocation costs from major multinational oil and gas corporations that
contribute significantly to global climate change.151

In 2003, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) and GAO predicted
that a dangerous combination of storm activity "could flood the entire
village at any time."152 In 2006, the Corps released a report on the
erosion suffered by Kivalina, concluding that climate change limited the
extent of sea ice surrounding the island's coastline.153 A new rock
revetment wall installed in 2010 provided the community with a projected
10-15 years to continue living in its location before relocation would
become essential.154

This case study can inform adaptive governance of coastal climate
relocation support for vulnerable communities moving forward. Through
vulnerability assessments, science can provide projections for how long
a community can safely reside in its current location. If the community
desires to be safely relocated, funding should be provided consistent
with the science-informed time frame to relocate the community safely.
But [some communities may prefer to remain in place for as long as
possible and may not seek relocation assistance]{.underline}.155 Under
these circumstances[, the resources that may have been applied to
support safe relocation should instead be applied to helping the
community remain in place for as long as possible]{.underline}.

[Alaskan communities]{.underline} and stakeholders have [identified a
significant gap in the State]{.underline} and federal government's
[capabilities to coordinate responses to climate change]{.underline}.
[Formalizing a stronger collaboration between the State, local, and
regional leaders will help to address this]{.underline} issue. Although
the State can play an active role in climate change adaptation efforts,
it is important to recognize and encourage maximum local
self-government. [Local and regional planning efforts must be led at the
local level by municipal and tribal governments in cooperation with
regional stakeholders and State]{.underline} and federal [agencies.
State agencies can support, enable, and empower communities in this
process]{.underline}. Finally, many communities lack the capacity to
fully respond to the effects of climate change, and State and federal
resources will be necessary to assist and support community
decision-making.

Action 1.1A: Encourage and facilitate a strong network of municipal
governments, Alaska Native Tribes, tribal consortia, and Alaska Native
Regional and Village Corporations to leverage resources, share
knowledge, and maximize efficiencies and purchasing power.

• The State and the Denali Commission should facilitate and enhance
networking and sharing.

• [The State should evaluate State and federal processes and protocols
for contractual and bidding activities, and survey communities, tribes,
and municipal governments to identify opportunities for
effective]{.underline} (cost-neutral) [collaboration]{.underline} and
communication.

Action 1.1B: Develop agreements that recognize local and Indigenous
rights to self-determination as part of risk and resilience planning and
adaptation.

• [The State should work with partners to develop a template Memorandum
of Understanding for government-to-government agreements between State
agencies, tribes, and municipalities.]{.underline} [These agreements
should clearly respect and support the rights of local governments to
develop culturally and place-appropriate climate adaptation
strategies,]{.underline} [address food security, and identify the role
of the State in support of those efforts]{.underline}.

• Alaska's Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management
(DHS&EM) should provide community and regional hazard mitigation plans
translated into the first languages of the people who reside in the city
or village for which the plan is written.

• Additionally, [the State should work with the multiple local governing
bodies of small Alaska communities to develop a multijurisdictional
hazard mitigation plan, as permitted, if the communities request to
develop a single hazard mitigation plan]{.underline}.

Action 1.1C: [Increase community capacity to plan for and adapt to
climate change through **technical support** and reducing
intergovernmental barriers]{.underline}.

• [The Governor should establish a Climate Adaptation Interagency
Working Group]{.underline} (CAIWG) to [work on providing climate
adaptation resources to communities]{.underline}, and serve as a liaison
between communities, State agencies, and the federal government.

• [The State should]{.underline} work through the CAIWG to [establish a
data clearinghouse or "knowledge hub" in collaboration with the
University and other partners to serve as the central repository for
climate adaptation, mitigation, and resiliency resources]{.underline}.

• The State should work with the Alaska congressional delegation to
ensure that federal cost-benefit analysis requirements recognize the
unique circumstance of Alaskan communities.

• The State should review the statutes and regulations associated with
the former Alaska Coastal Zone Management Program to identify best
practices and effective collaboration mechanisms.

Action 3.1B: Develop new carbon-neutral models of community economic
development that support diversification, leverage local investment, and
strengthen the clean energy economy.

• State and local governments should encourage carbon-neutral economic
development within Alaska communities by reprioritizing local
investment, local production and consumption of goods (including food
and seafood), recycling, and community development processes.

• As applicable, [the Department of Administration should add criteria
to State Requests for Proposals]{.underline} (RFPs) [that gives
preference to proposals with clean energy]{.underline} or energy
efficiency components. Similarly, municipal government RFPs can give
preference to proposals supporting clean energy or energy efficiency.

• [State and municipal governments can consider microloans to businesses
that focus on carbon-neutral products. This can be done in collaboration
with Alaska Native Tribes, tribal consortia, and Alaska Native Regional
and Village Corporations]{.underline}.

• The State should increase collaborations for program delivery and the
opportunity for public--private partnerships. State and local
governments should prioritize ways to make program delivery more
efficient and effective, including a review of the opportunity for
public--private partnerships and collaborative services.

• [The ability to restructure grant, loan, and capital project funding
from]{.underline} federal and [state budgets to support an energy
transition will be important. State]{.underline} and federal [funding
guidelines will need to remove inefficiencies and barriers that may
hinder clean energy use and energy efficiency projects]{.underline}.

Action 4.4C[: Improve electric generation efficiency in rural Alaska
through]{.underline} optimized power generation maintenance, [improved
renewable integration strategies]{.underline}, and reduced line loss.

• To optimize the diesel maintenance of existing and future generation
infrastructure (a key to efficient and long-term use), AEA's Circuit
Rider program should be integrated with utility financial and operations
management training (as is being piloted by AEA) to ensure that the
utility operator and manager collaborate effectively to meet customer
needs for safe, reliable, and affordable energy. The program should also
provide utilities with training on how to diagnose line loss issues and
recommend potential resources for reducing losses.

• Many of the [State]{.underline} and federal [programs that supported
improving community power production and increasing renewable energy
have been curtailed due to budget cuts]{.underline} and shifting
priorities. In order [to meet its climate goals, the State should
consider investing more in these programs]{.underline} (which include
AEA's RPSU and BFU programs), and altering program structures to
encourage maximum value from dollars spent. [Proposed changes to the
RPSU program should include an increased use of debt financing to both
extend the State's capital funds and provide increased natural
incentives for optimum operation. Debt financing, particularly through
AEA's Power Project Loan fund, would allow for greater requirements and
a longer-term relationship with the utility than is commonly had through
a grant]{.underline}. In selecting a project in a community, the RPSU
program should weigh all reasonable energy sources---fossil fuels and
renewables---to serve the community's needs.

• Additionally, [the Renewable Energy Fund and the Emerging Energy
Technology Fund should be invested in at levels that help the State meet
its goals, with emerging energy technology focused on helping to meet
reduced carbon emission goals]{.underline}, including within the oil and
gas industry. More robust project financing tools, including
consideration of a Community Energy Fund for Alaska, should be
considered.

• [Bulk fuel upgrades]{.underline}, [provided by]{.underline} AEA and
[the Denali Commission, have been beneficial across rural
Alaska]{.underline}, and this program will remain a critical part of the
safe, reliable, and affordable energy solutions portfolio for rural
communities. [However, increased investment and guidelines that focus on
efficiency and the ability to integrate renewable energy into remote,
rural power systems are also necessary]{.underline}.

### 2nc -- sales tax solves

#### A sales tax is easiest to implement, won't harm the economy and our specific proposal to tax services makes it more progressive

Alaska lawmakers consider proposals, economists weigh in" Alaska Public
Media, 4/25,

//DH

Nolan [Klouda, director of the University of Alaska Anchorage Center for
Economic Development, said there are advantages to sales
taxes]{.underline}.

"[A sales tax is]{.underline} of course [a very efficient way of
collecting tax revenue that doesn't tend to distort economic incentives
too much]{.underline}," he said.

In non-economics speak: [sales taxes]{.underline} don't take a lot of
complicated bureaucracy to implement, and they [don't tend to change how
much people buy]{.underline}. But they're regressive --- that means
poorer people are hit harder.

"Lower income earners generally are gonna pay a higher share of their
income in taxes than with a progressive income tax," Klouda said.

That's because they still have to pay for essential products, like
groceries and gas.

Jared Walczak, a researcher with the right-leaning Washington,
D.C.-based Tax Foundation, said [there are ways to make sales taxes less
regressive. A big one: taxing services]{.underline} like manicures, gym
memberships and oil changes, [not just goods]{.underline}.

"We know that higher income earners consume more in the services side,"
he said.

[Covering more services means the overall tax rate can remain
low.]{.underline} A 2020 analysis by Walczak's right-leaning group found
a 2.3 % tax on most goods and services could earn the state up to \$850
million, basically enough to fill the current budget gap.

Whereas most states have gradually introduced new taxes on services
throughout the decades, Alaska is in the unique position that it can
design a sales tax from scratch, Walczak said. He said [if Alaska can
pass a sales tax bill with few exemptions]{.underline}, it would be
unique.

"If the legislation currently under consideration were adopted [Alaska
would have the most progressive sales tax in the country by an enormous
margin]{.underline}," he said.

### AT: Sales tax is regressive

[The sales tax]{.underline}, more than most subjects in taxation[, is an
area of broad consensus among public finance scholars]{.underline}.
Decades ago, tax scholar John Due wrote that "sales tax structure should
produce a uniform distribution in consumption, should be neutral
regarding methods of production and distribution, and should be
collected at a reasonable cost."24 Another leading tax scholar, Charles
McLure, identifies the ideal sales tax as a destination-based tax on all
final consumption (but only final consumption).25 These standards are
broadly accepted, as are several related precepts and observations:

1\. An ideal sales tax is imposed on all final consumption, both goods
and services;

2\. An ideal sales tax exempts all intermediate transactions (business
inputs) to avoid tax pyramiding;

3\. Sales taxes should be destination-based, meaning that tax is owed in
the state and jurisdiction where the good or service is consumed;

4\. [The sales tax is more economically efficient]{.underline} than many
competing forms of taxation, including the income tax, [because it only
falls on present consumption, not saving or investment]{.underline};

5\. Because lower-income individuals have lower savings rates and
consume a greater share of their income, the sales tax can be
regressive, though broader bases that include consumer services (much
more heavily consumed by higher-income individuals) push in a
progressive direction;

6\. [The sales tax scales well with ability to pay, because it grows
with consumption]{.underline} and is therefore more discretionary than
many other forms of taxation; and

7\. [Consumption is a more stable tax base than income,]{.underline}
though the failure to tax most consumer services in many states is
leading to a gradual erosion of sales tax revenues as services become an
ever-larger share of consumption.

Most states impose their sales taxes on bases that consist of most
goods---with economically significant policy carveouts---and relatively
few services. With limited exceptions, most state sales taxes are
imposed on transactions involving tangible property: appliances but not
apps, light fixtures but not landscaping. This was less a conscious
choice than an accident of history, a relic of the fact that so many
sales taxes were imposed during the Great Depression, when services
comprised a far smaller share of the economy. It was administratively
simpler in that earlier era to focus almost exclusively on retail sales,
and even the later ones tended to follow their lead.

Fortunately for the nation's economy but unfortunately for the
reliability of most states' sales taxes, today's economy has little in
common with that of the 1930s or even the 1990s. Higher incomes and
changing consumer tastes have shifted a greater share of consumption to
services, while a digital economy is upending traditional categories.

We subscribe to streaming services rather than buying DVDs, VHS tapes,
CDs, or records (all of which were taxable in most states); we purchase
e-books (often untaxed) rather than paperbacks (taxable); we obtain
programs and games through digital downloads rather than physical media
(disks or cartridges). Increasingly, younger generations purchase
"experiences" more than tangible goods---and most of those experiences
involve services, whether it's fitness classes or cooking lessons or
excursions.

But it's not just new services; it's also a matter of older services
taking on greater importance in the modern economy. Domestic help has
all but vanished, but increasingly, there's an app for that, or at least
a number to call: house cleaning services, dog walking and pet-sitting,
ridesharing as an alternative to car ownership, or landscaping services
in lieu of buying a lawn mower, to name just a few. The mower was taxed;
its replacement (the lawn care service) is not. It is a story that can
be told many times over. It is the story of state sales tax codes built
around an economy that no longer exists.

Alaska need not make that mistake.

Taxes should apply to all final consumption in service of economic
neutrality, the idea that taxes should not interfere with economic
decisionmaking any more than is strictly necessary, nor should they pick
winners and losers. It is not the role of the tax code to favor piano
lessons over baseball bats or e-books over hardcovers. It makes little
sense to tax the purchase of a lawn mower but not tax the purchase of
lawn care services that obviate the need to own a mower. Yet, in many
states, these distinctions still govern, relics of a goods-dominant
economy that no longer exists.

[The sales tax should]{.underline} also [be broad-based in service of
tax equity]{.underline}.26 Sales taxes have two potential sources of
regressivity: one, the propensity of lower-income individuals to consume
a greater share of their income, and two, a scope of taxable consumption
that is more likely to fall on the sorts of transactions which dominate
the consumption of lower- and middle-income individuals.

Policymakers often exempt or lower rates on certain classes of
consumption as a progressive reform. The exemptions many states provide
for groceries are one such example---though there is reason to believe
it may not be terribly effective. Prepared foods are taxed at the
standard rate and most of the regressivity of taxing unprepared foods is
addressed by the exemption for SNAP (food stamps) and WIC purchases,
while the exemption is enjoyed by high-income earners as well---who
often spend considerably more on groceries.

In fact, while not enough work has been undertaken to establish a
consensus, there is research finding that lower-income taxpayers would
actually be better off if groceries were fully included in sales tax
bases (while retaining the federally-indicated exemption of SNAP and WIC
purchases), allowing for a lower overall sales tax rate.27 The lower
grocery rate is designed to create progressivity but largely fails to do
so. Yet, at the same time, policymakers in most states have largely
neglected a much more straightforward way to promote equity within the
sales tax.

[Consumption of personal services tends to be more discretionary than
consumption of goods.]{.underline} Consequently, [higher-income
individuals spend a greater share of income on services]{.underline},
[which are frequently untaxed.]{.underline} Unfortunately, most existing
state sales taxes are levied on all tangible property (goods) unless
expressly exempted, but only apply to services if expressly enumerated
in statute.

States have been gradually expanding their sales tax bases, but tax
policies are frequently path dependent. Expanding the sales tax base to
new transactions can be nearly as difficult as creating the tax in the
first place. [Should Alaska opt to impose a sales tax,]{.underline}
therefore, [the state should begin with as broad a base of personal
consumption as possible,]{.underline} avoiding politically challenging
battles down the road. In so doing, [policymakers would adopt a more
stable sales tax than that which exists in most other
states]{.underline}, but more than that, [one that does not commit the
accidental wrongs that favor some transactions over others and tend to
favor the wealthiest consumers]{.underline}.

With a very broad base, the sales tax could generate \$1 billion on a
rate as low as 3.1 percent, or \$500 million at 1.6 percent[; but even
with certain exclusions, Alaskans could prioritize a broad sales tax
base and a relatively low rate to generate substantial
revenue]{.underline}. A broader-than-average base could yield \$500
million at a state rate of less than 3 percent.

#### A broad based sales tax on all goods and services makes it less regressive

George Mason University "Recommendations for Tax Reform in Alaska"

//DH

However, a sales tax also has drawbacks, the primary one being that in
its most common and basic form it is regressive. [Since lower-income
people spend a larger portion of their income than higher-income people,
a sales tax imposes a relatively larger burden on those with lower
incomes. This]{.underline} undesirable feature [can be mitigated by
applying the sales tax to a broad base that includes both goods and
services]{.underline}. [Taxing services is also important since unlike
in the past, most consumer spending today is on services]{.underline}
rather than goods.

[Applying a sales tax to all final goods and services allows the rate to
be lower to achieve a given revenue target]{.underline}, [which reduces
the burden on all consumers]{.underline}. [A broad base can also reduce
the tax's regressiveness, since higher-income people spend a larger
share of their income on services]{.underline} than lower-income people.
If only goods are taxed, a sizeable amount of consumer spending,
especially by higher-income people, will be unfairly exempt from
taxation.

## Colonialism

### 1nc -- colonialism

#### The affirmative's [will to improve]{.underline} frames climate vulnerability as an Arctic indigenous problem that demands [Western]{.underline} intervention. This is [central]{.underline} to extending colonialism

Science Direct //DH

Prior to the settlement of comprehensive land claims in northern Canada
(see Hicks and White, 2000 for an overview), the concept of colonialism
circulated widely in both academic and political spheres, and provided
analytical traction for understanding the conditions under which
Indigenous peoples struggled to sustain their lives (e.g., Brody, 1973;
Dene Nation, 1977; IndianEskimo Association, 1970; Inuit Tapirisat of
Canada, 1977; Scott, 2007). Today, although references are occasionally
made to a ''colonial past,'' to speak of colonial relations as
persistently present in the North is to be accused, in some circles, of
analytical, political, and ontological misrecognition: colonialism was;
it is no longer. And yet processes and [practices that were
understood]{.underline}, prior to the settlement of land claims, [in
relation to colonization, remain persistently present in the region:
poverty, loss of traditional culture, loss of language, lack of control
over resource development, suicide, addictions, and physical and mental
health disparities]{.underline} (Cameron, 2010; Hicks, 2007; Kral and
Idlout, 2009; Tester and McNicoll, 2004). [Their persistence, moreover,
in a place and for a people]{.underline} that is now [supposed to be
'']{.underline}after'' or ''[beyond'' colonization, still justifies a
range of interventions; it still **demands ''solutions''**]{.underline}.
[Northern Indigenous peoples are still understood to ''have
problems'']{.underline} (indeed, as Smith (1999, p. 92) makes so clear,
[the **equation of Indigeneity with ''problems''** is so **deeply rooted
in Western knowledge** systems that its persistence in a supposedly
''post'' colonial context should not surprise us]{.underline}). And thus
academic, governmental, and non-governmental institutions continue to
intervene in the region in an effort to improve the lives of Indigenous
northerners.

[It is precisely the framing of intervention into the lives of
Indigenous peoples as well-meaning, benevolent, pragmatic, and necessary
that has been problematized]{.underline} by scholars in recent years. As
Tester and Kulchyski (1994, p. 4) observe, [efforts to ''improve'' and
''help'' northern Indigenous peoples have been **central to colonial
formations**]{.underline} in the region. As a population targeted most
extensively after World War II, ''the central historical dynamic that
came to link Inuit to non-Inuit society politically was put in place
during the period of high modernism. Unlike Indian affairs, where a
pre-welfare state employed largely coercive measures, in Inuit affairs
[it was a liberal form of welfare state, which gave the appearance of
having a more benign face]{.underline} and which employed a greater
reliance on ideology, [that became the means for attempting
assimilation'']{.underline}.

Processes and [practices that are understood, today, as central to
colonization in the North]{.underline} (including forced relocation into
settlements, the shooting of sled dogs, mass evacuation to southern
sanatoria for tuberculosis treatment, residential schooling, and the
imposition of southern models of health and education; see Kulchyski and
Tester, 2007; Stevenson, 2009, 2011; Tester and Kulchyski, 1994) [were
carried out under the auspices of a ''well-meaning'' liberal welfare
state]{.underline}, a state concerned with helping Inuit adapt to the
modern world, saving Inuit bodies from disease, and teaching Inuit how
to effectively operate in Western economic and political spheres. The
history of intensive colonial intervention into Inuit lives interweaves,
then, with governmental benevolence, improvement, and expertise, and as
such recent work on the colonial ''will to improve'' (Li, 2007) and
writings on colonial governmentality more generally (e.g., Mitchell,
2006; Scott, 2005) are particularly helpful for understanding colonial
and neocolonial processes in the North.

**[The will to improve]{.underline}**, Li argues, **[is a hallmark of
colonial relations]{.underline}**; [it is a form of ''trusteeship'' in
which the objective is not so much to dominate others but to enhance a
target population's ''capacity for action, and to direct
it'']{.underline} (2007, p. 5). Drawing on Foucault's understandings of
government as a field of power but also on Gramsci, Li is interested in
the will to shape the ''conduct of conduct'', to ''educate desires'',
and to configure peoples' relations not only with each other, but with
land, wealth, resources, means of subsistence, and so on. Governmental
power, she notes, targets the well-being of populations at large rather
than individuals, whether understood as the whole population or specific
subgroups defined by gender, race, location, or other features, ''each
with characteristic deficiencies that serve as points of entry for
corrective interventions'' (6). Li notes that the will to improve is
marked by intentions that are ''benevolent, even utopian''. Its
practitioners desire to make the world better and they do so not through
violence or force, but through ''schemes'' that are made to seem like
''the natural expression of the everyday interactions of individuals and
groups'' (5). [Governing Indigenous peoples in this mode]{.underline},
she argues, **[is no less significant]{.underline}** [than more
coercive, assimilative, or disciplinary modes of domination. It is an
extension and modification, not a departure from, colonial forms of
power]{.underline}.

#### Seeking redress through the settler state reproduces settler violence and reinforces narratives of Alaskan Native communities centered on economic need. That becomes the justification for the state to support [White settlers]{.underline} in Alaska at the expense of Alaskan Natives

**italics in original**

Indeed, Kymlicka (2007) points out that multiculturalism is unable to
address the collective rights-based agenda of Indigenous people because
of its foundations in liberalism. Further, Glenn Coulthard (2014)
rightly points out that [supporters]{.underline} of the multiculturalist
model leave unquestioned or implicitly [accept the authority of the
state to determine the legitimate boundaries of what can be acceptably
recognized]{.underline}. That is, **[it is inherently
problematic]{.underline}** [for the state to have the authority to
recognize Indigenous rights when it is also the polity that is
responsible for their dispossession]{.underline} (Coulthard 2014).

As Harjo (2019, 24) notes, the [problems with state recognition are why
many Native people are **forgoing state governance structures
all-together**]{.underline}, [because:]{.underline}

> [The onus is upon Indigenous troops to either lodge credible claims
> against the state or to defend themselves against actions of the
> state. There are two pursuits here:]{.underline} **[one is appealing
> to the structures that created the problem in the first
> place]{.underline}**, and the other is crafting reductive spatial
> representations of the Indigenous community. The first pursuit is
> existence in a constant state of survival and action in response to
> larger structures that are producing the inequalities; the other is
> the production of narratives directed at the state apparatus for use
> in grievance claims that are stripped of the complexity of Indigenous
> communities, space, and places. In the first pursuit, [Indigenous
> groups hurtle through the politics of recognition, arguing before the
> state in ways and in a language that the state will
> understand.]{.underline} [A politics-of-recognition narrative requires
> Indigenous people to discuss themselves in terms of Western
> knowledge]{.underline} and taxonomies of land. These are hollowed-out
> narratives about Indigenous places that over time become naturalized
> stories and commonly received knowledge. Consequently, [when
> communities structure their accounts within the terms of the politics
> of recognition, narratives of poverty, income, educational levels,
> etc. are **retold and retrenched**, sustaining a simplified and
> damage-based narrative about the community]{.underline}.

Harjo could very well be describing the issues with fisheries management
of subsistence in Alaska. [Not only are Indigenous knowledge systems and
communal values illegible--and thus unrecognizable--to subsistence
management regimes, Native peoples' only recourse for protecting their
lands and waters is appealing to the governance structures that are
implicit in species decline in the first place]{.underline}.92
Furthermore, and as was discussed in the previous chapter, [Native
people are forced to discuss subsistence using "**hollowed-out"
narratives of economic need** because of the high cost of living in
rural communities.]{.underline} [Economic need is]{.underline}
practically [the sole narrative that will motivate]{.underline} state
and [federal management regimes to support proposals]{.underline} in
support of subsistence protections. Thus, [rural economic need becomes a
subsistence paradigm that in turn allows **White settlers living in
rural areas to justify their rights to access subsistence
resources**]{.underline}.

Ultimately, the "recognition" that accompanies Tribal sovereignty within
multicultural narratives must also be concerned with the ways that
liberal pluralism is imbricated with the broader processes of Indigenous
elimination. Pateman (2007, 40) notes, for example, that "[the very fact
that Native peoples and their governments are recognized means that the
question of the legitimacy of the settlers' creation of civil society
always remains in the background."]{.underline} This is significant in
that it forces a critical analysis of the motivations behind---and
effects of--- recognition by the settler state.

Bhandar (2011) notes that identity is now highly bound up with rapidly
shifting neoliberal concepts of ownership and property that are vastly
different from that of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Yet for
Indigenous people, these outdated modes of ownership are still tied to
contemporary Indigenous rights claims around land that "come to be
reduced and articulated in the language of sovereign territory, nation
and a concept of culture that is synonymous with unchanging, static
traditions" (Bhandar 2011, 234-35). The effect is that [recognition as
it is practiced within liberal democratic states, has proven to have no
*transformative* effects]{.underline}. [Rather, it works to **assuage
the societal guilt of historical atrocities** committed for the
advancement of the state and to relegate the negative actions of the
state to the annals of history]{.underline} (Coulthard 2014). [In so
doing, multiculturalism ends up **reproducing systems of
oppression**]{.underline}, first through delimiting what can be
acceptably recognized, that is, in Povinelli's (2002) parlance, that
which is not viewed as "repugnant" to liberal democracy; and second, by
setting the limits of acceptable difference, multiculturalism
effectively suppresses the nuanced means by which Indigenous people
argue for and express their sovereignty, often in terms that are
fundamentally at odds with the individualistic ideologies of liberal
democracy (Holder and Corntassel 2002; Johnson 2008; Moran 2002).

Bhandar also (2011, 227) notes that "[The native subject, a creation of
the settler]{.underline}, was (and [remains) caught within relations of
dispossession, alienation and ownership that do not allow]{.underline},
**[in the absence of a dramatic rupture]{.underline}**,
[for]{.underline} [mutual recognition]{.underline}." This is because
[recognition within the settler colonial context is bound up in a
hierarchical formulation of state politics, which is in turn working to
maintain]{.underline} their own spatial and temporal
[orders]{.underline} both upon and [against those of Indigenous
people]{.underline}.

Indeed, some scholars have argued that the conflation of race with
issues of sovereignty is itself a form of settler colonial oppression
because it draws attention away from the ways that Indigenous people are
continually fighting against dispossession. Byrd (2014, 178) argues that
to overlook the significance of sovereignty in differentiating the
relationship between Indigenous people and the settler state is to
commit a form of "equivalency" or "the assumption of a level playing
field" that, according to Spivak (2009), is itself a tool of
colonialism. Such discursive tactics portray a desired image of settler
normativity: that of a settled and sovereign United States, free of
conflict with its "prior" inhabitants which disavows the historic and
ongoing acts of settler violence through "replay\[ing\] dispossession
and settlement on a mnemonic loop" (Bruyneel 2015, 351). The subsistence
use category, and all the narratives mobilized around it to conscript it
into the rhetoric of White settler equal rights, or against it to
conflate settler belonging with that of Indigenous people, is an Alaskan
snapshot of a larger portrait of the United States' mnemonic processes
of settler belonging and normativity.

Conclusion

Within Alaska, "subsistence" has come to be imbricated with a localized,
liberal settler ideology regarding non-Native residents' rights to
provide for their families from the land and situate their belonging.
Knowledge and involvement with subsistence foods for many non-Native
Alaskans is, like many Alaskan Natives, also a marker of identity.
However, this identity is connected to the ideological formation of
Alaska as "the last frontier," and thus deeply bound up with settler
temporalities, and narratives of perseverance and belonging in the face
of a "wild," vast, and untamable space. Further, such forms of
identification with subsistence practices connect strongly to what it
means for people to "be Alaskan." While that is not to say that only
those residents who are involved with subsistence consider themselves
Alaskan, but it is to say that all those residents who adhere to the
White settler perspective use their knowledge and practice of
subsistence as a marker of their Alaskan identity. It is, in fact, for
many residents who immigrated to Alaska from the contiguous US, how they
prove that they are Alaskan, much like the man in the opening vignette
of chapter two. This leads to a number of important points regarding
state and civil expressions of settler colonial ideologies: These
settler ideologies are accorded significance over and above Native
ideologies surrounding subsistence. Within subsistence management
systems, **[land and its resources are conceptualized in a way that
privileges settler ideologies over those of Native
Alaskans]{.underline}**. There are a myriad of [ideological]{.underline}
and material [tools]{.underline} that are mobilized to conflate Native
and non-Native claims to subsistence resources. Those tools [work to
inform]{.underline} (both officially and unofficially) [the way state
officials interact with, interpret, and respond to Native
concerns]{.underline} over access to subsistence resources. Settler
ideologies regarding who has rightful access to the land thus
fundamentally shapes Native people's access to it. [Despite all our
efforts to have our concerns addressed through state processes, they
are]{.underline} almost **[never acted upon]{.underline}** in a way that
suits our best interest. Similarly to the Yaww Koo.èex, [Alaska Native
people are increasingly forming NGOs, Tribal cooperative associations,
and other alternative traditional means of drawing attention to those
issues that the state refuses to]{.underline} adequately
[address]{.underline}.

#### Colonialism turns the case. Paying lip service to collaboration won't change the settler state, which inevitably acts to limit Native sovereignty in practice

In this analysis, I have considered policy documents from various
government agencies in the US and how they represent the problem of
climate change displacement. The analysis began with a look at the
problem representations present in the documents. These problem
representations frame the displacement of the communities in a few ways.
For funding and categorization, the [problems are represented to be
purely financial constructions, that the 'problem' is lack of funding or
accessibility of funds for the community]{.underline}. For
decision-making and data, the 'problem' is the need to collect
information and then make an informed decision about relocation. For
these representations, the communities afflicted are implicated in the
decision-making process, however most call for the government to make
decisions. The final category of vulnerability speaks to how the
communities are in a position where they need help, either related to
climate change impacts or pre-existing vulnerabilities. [What is clear
in these problem representations is that the 'problem' is not climate
change, but how these communities are experiencing it.]{.underline}
Specifically, while there is explicit mention of erosion, there is
little connection made to addressing the causes of erosion or broader
climate change. [Climate change is not problematized as it would require
the government to acknowledge and implicate its own actions which has
led to current environmental changes.]{.underline} Looking into
community perspectives on the problematizations, community members
challenge the state's conception of displacement and relocation through
their lived experiences. While the communities echo the problems of
funding and decision-making, these are further problematized by the
communities who challenge the structure of funding mechanisms and the
overstepping of government decision-makers. For problem representations
of vulnerability, the communities challenge how the government
constructs vulnerability by pointing to the role of climate change
specifically.

I now further reflect on the second research question: what do these
problem representations, taken with their presuppositions and effects,
reveal about the nature of Indigenous sovereignty, autonomy, and the
right to self-determination in the US? These problem representations
reveal that [Indigenous sovereignty and self-determination are powerful
claims, and]{.underline} thus [undesirable to the state]{.underline}.
[The US claims to support]{.underline} the right to
[self-determination]{.underline} and 'tribal' sovereignty,
[as]{.underline} both are [protected under the federal trust
responsibility, yet does not uphold]{.underline} either [in
practice]{.underline}. [The state is willing to address climate
displacement to the extent which they remain in control of the process.
This keeps the communities dependent on the state and vulnerable to its
decisions.]{.underline} As the state continues to exercise its authority
over the territory, despite Indigenous sovereignty claims, it bolsters
its power and position which is rarely challenged internationally due to
American exceptionalism and global hegemony. [Despite this, the
communities of Kivalina, Newtok, and Shishmaref continue to resist with
the limited power they have inside the colonial system, using political
and legal tools at their disposal]{.underline}.

[Given that the state has made the direness of current conditions
abundantly clear in reports]{.underline} and policies (e.g., GAO, 2003;
GAO, 2009; GAO, 2022), [it raises the question of why there has been
such inaction to relocate the communities]{.underline}. [This research
provides a possible explanation which situates the inaction in
coloniality and the interconnectedness of settler colonial land
dispossession and capitalism.]{.underline} The **[control of land is the
"irreducible element" of the settler colonial project]{.underline}**
(Wolfe, 2006, p. 388); [therefore, the ownership and control of
territory is a central concern in displacement and
relocation]{.underline}. [This study makes clear just how important
territoriality is in governing]{.underline}. One can draw a thread
across time connecting the dispossession of Indigenous lands upon
contact through the dismemberment of collective land rights (e.g.,
ANCSA) through tools of land control such as sustainable development to
current cases of immobility. [The state operates and is restricted by
the colonial system it is embedded in, and]{.underline} as this research
shows, [even where self-determination is encouraged, the system of
coloniality still constrains the possibility of recognizing Indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline} and autonomy. [Resistance]{.underline},
therefore, [needs to operate on a level of systemic change, of
**independence from the colonial** **state**,]{.underline} which is the
daily and life's work by the Yup'ik and Iñupiat Peoples and Indigenous
resurgence scholars (e.g., Corntassel, 2012; Simpson, 2016; Coulthard &
Simpson, 2016; Palmer et al., 2022).

[Policy is a tool utilized by governments to]{.underline} maintain
social order and [control its population]{.underline}. Policies are what
Foucault (2007) refers to as technologies, or the mechanisms through
which governing occurs. How governing transpires is the focus of
Foucault's (2007) work on governmentality which seeks to understand how
the state orders the relationship between itself and its citizens. [The
settler colonial]{.underline} and capitalist [state]{.underline}
structure (Wolfe, 2006; Quijano, 2000; Quijano, 2007), which
marginalizes the Indigenous Peoples1, [is reproduced and enforced
through policy]{.underline}. [Policy has played a significant role in
shaping current situations from the assimilative policies which
attempted to destroy the communities' knowledge systems, to educational
policies which restricted the mobility of the communities]{.underline},
to policies of classification which defines how the communities can
access their rights, to the current relocation policies which restrict
and define the possibility of movement for the communities.

The Indigenous Peoples of these three villages, the Yup'ik (Newtok) and
Iñupiat (Kivalina, Shishmaref), have lived on these territories from
time immemorial. Upon colonization, first by Russia and then The United
States (US), these Indigenous communities were brought into a settler
colonial system where their bodies, lands, and ways of life were the
target of appropriation and assimilation (Wolfe, 2006). [Indigenous
resistance movements in the US including armed struggles, the occupation
of Alcatraz]{.underline} by the American Indian Movement, [and
the]{.underline} 2016 [Standing Rock protests continue to challenge the
settler-colonial state. Indigenous resurgence is a form of resistance
focused on regenerative nation-building. It]{.underline} is a philosophy
which [challenges the hierarchical nature of a capitalist colonial world
and encourages the use of Indigenous Knowledge]{.underline} (IK) [to

Indeed, [even scholars who conceive of]{.underline} themselves and
[their work as a response to colonialism must **reckon with the
tradition within which they operate,** and with potential continuities
between recent interest in Indigenous peoples, knowledges, and
experiences, and past exploitation and domination]{.underline}. I have
highlighted, here, the ways in which [research investigating the human
dimensions of climatic change in the]{.underline} Canadian [Arctic, and
particularly]{.underline} work [undertaken within the vulnerability and
adaptation framework, risks perpetuating colonial assumptions,
knowledges, and practices]{.underline} even (and indeed [**especially)**
as it aims to improve the lives of Indigenous northerners]{.underline}.
[It does so by perpetuating a longstanding delimitation of Indigeneity
to the local and the traditional, by rendering climatic change a field
of technical intervention, and by excluding from its frame of reference
the broader colonial and political--economic context]{.underline} within
which northern Indigenous peoples struggle to respond to climatic
change. As a result, [the literature overlooks one of the most important
human dimensions of climatic change]{.underline} in the Canadian Arctic
[resource exploration, extraction, and shipping and renders Inuit
interests, knowledges, and claims to these dimensions of climatic change
illegible.]{.underline} Such a move, however unwitting, is profoundly
consequential.

As I have emphasized, [the focus]{.underline} throughout the human
dimensions of climate change literature [on traditional livelihoods and
cultures is not necessarily problematic in and of itself,]{.underline}
nor is the use of community-based study to develop fine-grained, locally
derived understandings of climatic change. All studies involve choices
around subjects, methods, and scholarly audience, and no study can
address all dimensions of an issue. Promoting and maintaining
traditional knowledges and practices is a priority shared by northern
Indigenous peoples, and scholars working in this realm have made a
number of important contributions, not least highlighting the serious
effects of climatic change on traditional cultures and practices. [What
is at stake]{.underline}, here, [is the equation of
Indigeneity]{.underline} and the human itself [with the traditional and
the local, and the ways in which such a formulation extends colonial
forms of knowledge and practice]{.underline}. The human dimensions of
climate change literature is partial and limited in ways that have not
been identified or addressed, and insofar as it is received as a
comprehensive, accurate, participatory, and community-based assessment
of how climatic change is and will impact northern Indigenous peoples,
[it must be subjected to critical scrutiny, and its policy implications
problematized]{.underline}. Furthermore, [to the extent that remedying
''local'' vulnerabilities to climatic change is occasioning a new round
of intervention into the lives of Indigenous northerners, attending to
the continuities and presence of past colonial policies, practices, and
knowledges is vita]{.underline}l. **[Governmental intervention has never
been neutral for northerners,]{.underline}** even and perhaps
[especially when it was well-meaning and designed to specifically
prepare Inuit for a changing world.]{.underline}

#### Policy is doomed to failure -- even with fiat, legislative success are drops of victory in a [sea of failure]{.underline} -- the plan will be [overwhelmed]{.underline} by settler attempts to override it through other policies

As this section has demonstrated, ANCSA has had a profound and
altogether unique hand in shaping the lives of Alaska Natives, and the
very political economy of the state. ANCSA was, in implementation and
effect, a social experiment meant to expedite the assimilation of Native
people into Western society, while simultaneously freeing up disputed
lands for development and resource extraction. [While Alaskan Native
people, both through organized groups, and individual acts of protest,
have fought hard over the decades to stave off settler,]{.underline}
[industry, state, and federal governments' unceasing attempts to usurp
land and resources, the end result has been **drops of victory in a sea
of acquiescence**.]{.underline} [There is a perpetual sense of "working
with what one is given]{.underline}" rather than any major feeling of
accomplishment, [with each new piece of legislation **immediately
followed by organized efforts to modify or counteract their negative
implications**]{.underline}.

[These organized efforts have led to the relatively strong civil,
cultural, and political presence of Alaska Natives throughout the
state]{.underline}, in another sense, the inherently assimilationist
nature of the Act has led to a number of conflicting social positions
amongst Alaskan Natives. Rural residents often resent what they see as
the uneven distribution of benefits received by urban residents,
especially when profits made by regional corporations come from
extracting resources from rural areas. [ANCSA has also led to the rise
of a Native elite, who are most active in the realm of corporate and
state politics, and who are sometimes accused of no longer connecting to
the communities they are meant to serve]{.underline}. In essence, many
rural Native people feel exploited by both the state and ANCSA
corporations, both of whom benefit from extracting resources from their
home territories while doing little to benefit these communities.
Further, and from the very beginning of U.S. settler expansion into
Alaska, Native people have been trying to protect their access and
capacity to maintain traditional subsistence food practices. However,
rather than ameliorate these concerns by directly addressing them, ANCSA
failed to implement a satisfactory subsistence policy, allowing instead
the concerns of settler interests to dictate Native people's access to
their foods.

### L -- climate adaptation

#### Framing the plan as about vulnerability and adaptation ignores the role of [extractivism]{.underline} and [shipping]{.underline} in the creation of Arctic climate change -- this politically disempowers, and reinforces colonialism

Both the human dimensions of climate change literature and the
literature on colonialism, postcolonialism, and decolonization are vast,
and a comprehensive assessment of their potential intersections is
beyond the scope of this paper. I focus, here, on identifying specific
assumptions, orientations, and exclusions characterizing the
''vulnerability and adaptation'' approach to the human dimensions of
climate change in the Canadian Arctic, the ways in which these
assumptions and exclusions emerge from colonial systems of knowledge and
power, and the political and intellectual implications of their
mobilization in the contemporary context. [Although the]{.underline}
explicit [aim of]{.underline} many [scholars]{.underline} working within
the human dimensions of climate change literature [is to improve the
lives of northerners and mitigate the human impacts of climatic
change]{.underline} in the region, I argue here that [the vulnerability
and adaptation framework risks delimiting the ways in which northern
Indigenous perspectives]{.underline}, concerns, and critiques [can be
heard and can be effective. The vulnerability and adaptation
approach]{.underline} to the human dimensions of climate change, as it
is currently carried out, [works to circumscribe the politics of
climatic change and its effects at the poles]{.underline}, I argue, [by
perpetuating the delimitation of Indigenous peoples to the ''local'', by
limiting the legibility of Indigenous geographies to the realm of the
''traditional'']{.underline}, [and by eliding the persistence of the
colonial]{.underline}, understood not just in cultural, social, or
historical terms, but also [as the organization and re-organization of
political--economic relations.]{.underline} **[In the very
act]{.underline}** [of aiming to]{.underline} [diagnose and]{.underline}
[mitigate Inuit vulnerability]{.underline} to climatic change, [the
vulnerability and adaptation approach is]{.underline} not only failing
to account for the most significant and pressing dimensions of climatic
change in the region, I argue (that is, it is failing on its own terms;
it is not accurately identifying the nature, extent, or strategies
appropriate to addressing climate change), it is also
**[buttressing]{.underline}** [political and intellectual formations
that underwrite a new round of dispossession and
accumulation]{.underline} in the region.

I develop this argument by bringing the ''vulnerability and adaptation''
literature into conversation with two bodies of literature that have
hitherto failed to shape research in this realm. They are: (a) critical
writings on the discursive production of Indigenous peoples as
traditional and local, and the ways in which such a framing facilitates
dispossession and political marginalization; and (b) writings on
improvement, benevolence, development, expertise, and government as
fields of power. I focus on how colonial ''systems of cognition'',
colonial ways of knowing and understanding northern Indigenous peoples,
interweave with efforts to govern climatic change in the region, and how
efforts to ''improve'' the lives of northern Indigenous peoples in
relation to climatic change occasion the extension of colonial relations
in the region. Following a review of these two realms of research, I use
the insights generated by these literatures to critically interrogate
the vulnerability and adaptation approach to studying the human
dimensions of climate change. I challenge the fundamentally [colonial
framing of Indigenous peoples as local and traditional]{.underline}
operative in the literature [and the consequent delimitation of the
''human'' to this realm,]{.underline} [a delimitation that most
glaringly results in the omission of resource extraction and
shipping]{.underline} as human dimensions of climatic change. [Such an
omission]{.underline} [is]{.underline} not only of practical
significance, I argue, insofar as it limits the accuracy and
comprehensiveness of assessments of human vulnerability and adaptive
capacity in the region. It is also [of profound political significance,
insofar as it contributes to a broader delimitation of Inuit political
interventions into Arctic shipping, resource development, and climatic
change]{.underline}.

#### The plan's call for a technical development solution [depoliticizes]{.underline} resistance to colonial practices

Of particular relevance to this paper is Li's attention to the
rationalities underpinning governmental intervention (including the ways
of thinking, the calculations, and the techniques that characterize
governmental power), as well as the ways in which these rationalities
intersect with colonial imperatives to maintain the difference and
distinctiveness of colonizer and colonized. There are two ''practices''
and three ''tactics'' Li identifies in this regard that warrant
discussion here. First, Li identifies two practices by which trustees
''translate the will to improve into explicit programs'' (7). The first,
''problematization'', is a process of identifying deficiencies that need
to be rectified. [The practice of identifying and naming deficiencies or
weaknesses in a target population]{.underline}, [and their corresponding
need to be improved]{.underline}, fixed, or otherwise rectified[,
is]{.underline}, Li argues, [a hallmark of governmental
power]{.underline}. The second, corresponding practice Li identifies is
a process of ''rendering technical,'' a process she describes, following
Nikolas Rose, as a whole set of practices concerned with representing
the domain to be governed as an ''intelligible field with specifiable
limits and particular characteristics. . .. defining boundaries,
rendering that within them visible, assembling information about that
which is included and devising techniques to mobilize the forces and
entities thus revealed'' (7). [Populations targeted through governmental
improvement schemes]{.underline}, in other words, [must first be
problematized as facing particular challenges or suffering from
particular deficiencies]{.underline}. Next, [the quality and shape of
those problems and deficiencies must be **rendered
technical**]{.underline}, their boundaries and content must be specified
and rendered visible, [and techniques developed to target
them]{.underline}.

Crucially, Li observes, ''[questions that are rendered technical are
simultaneously **rendered nonpolitical**]{.underline}. . . [they focus
more on the **capacities of the poor** than on the practices through
which one social group impoverishes another'']{.underline} (7). [Experts
operating within this framework]{.underline} constantly
[repose]{.underline} what James Ferguson calls [''political questions''
of land, resources, jobs, or wages as ''technical 'problems' responsive
to the **technical 'development' intervention''**]{.underline}
(Ferguson, 1994, p. 270). Expert discourses, Li further argues, ''are
devoid of reference to questions they cannot address, or that might cast
doubt on the completeness of their diagnoses or the feasibility of their
solutions.'' (2007, p. 11) In particular, they exclude
political--economic questions. In other words, processes of
problematization, representation, specification, and technical
intervention necessitate the exclusion of all that cannot be addressed
in technocratic terms. They require the reframing of complex, inherently
political formations in terms that can be governed through targeted,
technical intervention.

#### Representations of indigenous vulnerability to climate change make it likely the state will regulate and control indigenous communities

//DH

What this category of problem representations reveal is that [the state
is overly concerned with maintaining regulatory systems and bureaucracy
that it comes at the expense of communities in need.]{.underline} By
avoiding explicit responsibility for the conditions of the community,
[the state is able to frame the issue as one which is naturally
occurring, rather than as a result of discriminatory policy and
practices]{.underline}. Mignolo (2023) states that [a colonial system
produces injustices, **while purporting development.**]{.underline}
These representations show how these injustices are understood by the
colonial state, however treated as opportunities for development rather
than as crises. From a policy-as-discourse standpoint (e.g., Ball, 1990;
Bacchi, 2000), [these policies serve to keep the power structure of
coloniality in place, by framing the communities as vulnerable and
in-need, while **obscuring the responsibility of the
state**]{.underline}. [By maintaining this framing of vulnerability, the
state is able to rationalize overstepping Indigenous sovereignty to make
time-sensitive decisions, much like how initial contact overstepped
Indigenous sovereignty for the 'greater good']{.underline} (Saito, 2010,
p. 117).

What is left unproblematic?

Where the problem representations highlight health care risks and other
vulnerabilities, there is no reflection of how the situation has not
been addressed before reaching critical condition. Health care
challenges and deteriorating infrastructure are not necessarily
symptomatic of climate change, though they can be exacerbated by it.
Additionally, though they may not be the primary motivator for
relocating, these challenges can still contribute to the communities'
decisions to relocate. These [existing conditions are not questioned,
and therefore neither is the government's own role in creating these
conditions. The colonial system of power maintains a structure in which
inequalities are manufactured and then maintained]{.underline} (Quijano,
2000; Mignolo, 2023). The conditions of the communities have been
created by policy and then maintained under the principles of
sustainable development. While the conditions of health care facilities
fall under state or federal jurisdiction, the problematizations ignore
that the agencies problematizing the living conditions are part of the
apparatus responsible for improving the conditions. Furthermore, which
rights receive attention is also questionable, as attention is brought
specifically to water and shelter, but rarely to cultural rights or the
need to access subsistence food sources. The prioritization of certain
rights over others is left unproblematic and particularly the uniqueness
of Indigenous status.

In the set of problem representations concerned with vulnerability, the
cause of erosion and conditions of the land in the communities is left
uninterrogated. While nearly all documents referred to erosion, it is
taken as the starting point rather than questioning the conditions which
have caused it. Climate change remains silent in many of the documents
and in the problem representations, despite playing a clear and
unequivocal role in the warming of the Arctic (Thoman et al., 2023). [By
ignoring the role of a larger environmental change, across not just
Alaska, but the Arctic and the rest of the globe, it lessens the
accountability of the government to address how it has contributed to
climate change and address future climate changes]{.underline}. The US
has contributed to and continues to contribute to climate change through
the burning of fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions. [Displacement
of these communities in Alaska is a symptom of a much larger climate
change problem]{.underline}. [With so much emphasis on the adaptation to
climate change]{.underline} (i.e., the relocations), [the conditions of
climate change will continue to displace more populations]{.underline}.
Climate justice movements seek to promote adaptation but also encourage
the prevention of further climate change impacts (Schlosberg & Collins,
2014, p. 368). To address the problem of climate change, extractive
industries would need to be targeted in order to lower emissions
(Indigenous Climate Action, 2021, p. 42) which is not visible in these
documents. The community of Kivalina attempted a public nuisance lawsuit
against energy companies for their role in creating the conditions they
now face. Though the case was not successful (Native Village of Kivalina
v. ExxonMobil Corp., 2009), it demonstrated that these small villages
have been and are resisting their destruction through any means
possible. The communities are advancing the cause of climate action, as
they know that if current trends persist, life in the north will become
untenable.

### L -- community collaboration

#### Community collaboration is a link -- it operates from a [Western]{.underline} frame that projects an idealized form of indigeneity tied to land. In doing so, it forecloses larger [political]{.underline} questions of sovereignty, accountability for climate change and resource extraction

This shift away from slowing or stopping climate change toward adapting
to it is, of course, profoundly political, and to the extent that it is
advanced in the name of saving Inuit lives and livelihoods, it radically
re-routes political discourse on Inuit relations with climatic change,
particularly efforts to hold distant greenhouse gas producers
accountable for their impacts on Arctic lands and peoples (e.g., Inuit
Circumpolar Council, 2005) and to frame climate change in terms of
equity, justice, and human rights (Crump, 2008). Second, this ''shift in
priorities'' is not simply intellectual. Scholars working in this
tradition are actively aiming to reshape federal, territorial, and
non-governmental policy interventions (Ford, 2010; Ford et al., 2010b)
and they are effective in this regard. Indian and Northern Affairs
Canada has remodeled its northern climate change strategy to explicitly
focus on adaptation (see Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, 2011) and
both national and international Inuit associations (Inuit Tapiriit
Kanatami and the Inuit Circumpolar Council, respectively) increasingly
insist on addressing adaptation alongside mitigation (Inuit Circumpolar
Council, 2010a; Simon, 2010). In other words, this realm of thought and
practice matters; it is in line with and shaping governmental
interventions in the North. And third, [research into Inuit
vulnerability and adaptation to climatic change actively solicits
''local'' and ''community'' involvement, emphasizes consultation and
participation, and even frames its findings as a translation and
representation of Inuit knowledges]{.underline}, concerns, and
perspectives themselves. That is, [researchers claim to speak not just
about Inuit, but for Inuit, by **undertaking expert inquiries into what
''local'' people think**]{.underline}, feel, know, and want, and
designing strategies and responses that address these knowledges,
capacities, and concerns.

The vulnerability and adaptation approach to understanding the human
dimensions of climate change in the Arctic typically takes the form of a
participatory, community-based study, involving community meetings,
focus groups, interviews, and observations. A series of these studies
has been undertaken across Nunavut and the Northwest Territories over
the past 5--10 years. In Igloolik, Arctic Bay, Ulukhaktok, and
elsewhere, researchers have endeavoured to identify and characterize,
''through local eyes'' (Ford et al., 2006a, p. 157), the vulnerability
and adaptive capacities of ''local communities'' to climatic change
(Ford and Smit, 2004; Ford et al., 2006a,b, 2008; Laidler et al., 2009;
Pearce et al., 2009, 2010). The questions informing these studies are
the following: ''who and what are vulnerable?''; ''to what stresses does
vulnerability exist?''; ''in what way does vulnerability manifest
itself''; ''what are the determinants of vulnerability and how have they
changed over time?''; and ''what capacity exists to cope with changing
risks?'' (Ford et al., 2006a, p. 145). The assessments begin with
determining what people are exposed to and how exposure varies within
communities, then identify existing and potential adaptive capacities
within communities. They go on to assess overall community
vulnerabilities to climatic change and point to appropriate adaptive
strategies that might minimize or mitigate some of these
vulnerabilities.

How does critical research into the spatialization of Indigeneity and
colonial governmentality intersect with this literature? There are
several aspects of the vulnerability and adaptation approach to the
human dimensions of climatic change that can be problematized with these
critical literatures in mind. I focus here on the ways in which [the
literature (a) perpetuates a delimitation of Indigeneity to the local
and the traditional; and (b) re-frames the human dimensions of climatic
change in the Arctic as a technical, contemporary, and local problem
that can be addressed with specific policy interventions]{.underline}.
[Such a framing hinges on the exclusion of contemporary and historical
geographies of colonization, including their political--economic
articulations]{.underline}. Together, these aspects of the vulnerability
and adaptation framework fundamentally limit its ability to accurately
or comprehensively assess the human dimensions of climatic change, and
have political and intellectual consequences that reach far beyond the
literature itself.

3.1. The local and traditional

[The unspoken but crucial premise underpinning this work is that the
''local'' is self-evidently the Indigenous and the
traditional]{.underline}. The ''local'' in these studies is not simply a
population in a specific place, but rather that which is recognizably
''local'' insofar as it is Indigenous, and specifically a version of
Indigeneity that is recognizably ''traditional'', tied to the land, and
dependent in very specific ways upon relations with the natural world.
Thus, it is those who identify as Inuit that are solicited to contribute
to assessments of local vulnerability and adaptive capacity to climatic
change, and it is the stereotypically ''Indigenous'' dimensions of
participants' lives that are evaluated: their ''traditional'' activities
(such as hunting, gathering, and land travel) and ''traditional''
knowledge (about weather, ice, land, plants, and animals) (see e.g.,
Ford et al., 2008; Nichols et al., 2004; Pearce et al., 2010). [The
vulnerability and adaptation framework targets]{.underline} precisely
the local Indigenous figure that Appadurai cautioned against so many
years ago: it is [a figure that is tied to place, intimately connected
economically and culturally to that place's land and
wildlife]{.underline}, [and in possession of distinctive
knowledges]{.underline} and perspectives [that emerge from those
intimate relations]{.underline}.

**[Such a premise leads to a series of closures around who and what is
legible in these studies]{.underline}**. The natural resources at stake,
for example, are caribou, walrus, and seal (see Ford, 2009b; Ford et
al., 2007), not the diesel that runs community generators, not the gas
that powers the snowmobiles used to harvest such resources, and not the
mineral deposits that these same ''locals'' extract from the land in
their work at the growing number of mines across the region. [The
primary form of knowledge and practice that matters about this local
Indigenous figure]{.underline}, in other words, [is that which is
understood as emergent from an **idealized, Indigenous form of
relation** with the land]{.underline}, or the relative departure of the
local population from a prior state of intimate relation with the land.
[Working from such a premise, the vector through which locals are
understood to be vulnerable to climate risk is through their
Indigeneity: it is through engaging in ''traditional'' cultural and
economic practices]{.underline} such as ''hunting, camping, or
travelling \[on the land\]'' (Ford et al., 2006a, p. 149). [The risks
climate change poses to their jobs, to their political leverage on
questions of Arctic sovereignty]{.underline}, or to the cleanliness of
their waters due to increased shipping through the Northwest Passage
[are not within the frame of reference here]{.underline} (note that some
studies identify factors such as unemployment, rising gas prices, and
other ''modern'' dimensions of Inuit lives and livelihoods in their
analyses, but only insofar as they undermine traditional knowledges and
practices, and thus increase Inuit exposure to climatic risks). Instead,
researchers attempt to understand which groups tend to engage in
hunting, camping, and land travel, how this exposes them to
climate-related risks, and the extent to which they possess the
knowledges, skills, equipment, and other supports that might maximize
their ability to adapt to changing climatic conditions.

Not surprisingly, the studies find that it is the most active,
''traditional'' hunters who are most exposed to climatic risks. Factors
like ''thin snow cover on the land'', ''later and longer ice
freeze-up'', ''melting permafrost'', and ''stronger and more
unpredictable winds'' (Ford et al., 2006a, p. 150) are described as
increasing the exposure sensitivity of hunters insofar as they render
travel and harvesting less predictable, more dangerous, and more
difficult (see also Ford, 2009b). The vulnerability of ''modern''
hunters, those who rely more extensively on technology, is described as
a function of their modernity: not only is it suggested that they
exercise ''less caution and overconfidence'' due to the introduction of
technologies like GPS units, two-way radios, snowmobiles, and so on, but
the fact that such technologies require significant outlays of cash, and
thus the need to work for wages, further undermines their adaptive
capacities. For example, whereas in the past Inuit could hunt and trap
according to optimum weather conditions, today, ''modern'' Inuit have to
hunt on the weekends or during booked holidays, leading them to be more
inclined, the authors argue, to take risks: ''when a trip has been
planned and time taken off, hunters are strongly motivated to proceed
with hunting, even in the case of poor weather or unsafe hunting
conditions'' (Ford et al., 2006a, p. 151). The overall reduction in time
spent on the land due to ''increased dependence on waged employment''
(154) is described as undermining the maintenance and transmission of
traditional knowledge, the kind of knowledge that would enhance the
capacity of hunters to respond to changing climatic conditions. Not only
are modern hunters not practicing their traditional knowledge often
enough, it is argued, but they are not available to spend extended
periods of time on the land training young people. To the extent that
modernity undermines Indigeneity, modernity itself renders Inuit more
vulnerable to climate change within this framework.

Even more vulnerable than modern hunters, though, are young people,
particularly young men (for a critique of the predominance of male
informants in northern climate change research, see Desbiens, 2010;
Dowsley et al., 2010), who are both inclined to attempt land travel and
harvesting activities, and described as lacking in the skills,
knowledge, and experience that reduce the vulnerability of older hunters
to the same climatic conditions. Young people are the emergent targets
of this will to govern and improve: they are acutely vulnerable and
expected to be increasingly so in the future. Fewer young people ''are
displaying the same degree of commitment or interest in harvesting''
(Ford et al., 2006a, p. 154) as their Elders, it is argued. They have a
''disconnection from the land'' and from the Elders who would teach them
how to properly engage the land, caused by ''language differences'',
''increased dependence on waged employment'', ''southern educational and
cultural requirements'', and a ''desire among youth to follow 'Western'
social norms'' and play ''computer games'' (154). The adaptive
capacities of youth are undermined by what is termed ''intergenerational
segregation'' (155): they lack connection with the generation of Inuit
who would train them in traditional skills. And thus, several studies
conclude, ''the adaptability of younger generations to future climate
change will depend upon the strength of \[Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit\]''
(157).

In and of itself, attending to the ways in which hunters are exposed to
climate-related dangers is a valid and necessary pursuit. Northerners
are experiencing increasing vulnerability to unpredictable ice
formations and weather patterns; ''intergenerational segregation'' is a
pressing concern among northern Indigenous peoples, and mitigating these
dimensions of climatic change is important. [What is objectionable here
is the exceedingly narrow framing of what counts as a ''local
vulnerability'' to climatic change]{.underline}, on what terms Inuit are
understood to have something to say about climatic change, [and the ways
in which climatic change occasions governmental interest in reshaping
the conduct of Inuit conduct]{.underline}. In this regard, a colonial
governmentality perspective generates important insights.

3.2. Colonialism and the technocratic framing of climate change

[If governmental intervention involves processes of problematization, it
is important to scrutinize the re-posing of climate change as a problem
of adaptation]{.underline} in this literature, [not as a problem with a
cause that could be addressed]{.underline}, [and not as a process
facilitating]{.underline} what Johnson (2010) recently termed
''accumulation by degradation'', [the extension of a new round of
resource extraction]{.underline} in a region rendered more accessible by
the biophysical effects of previous rounds of accumulation. [The
''vulnerability and adaptation'' literature re-frames the human
dimensions of climatic change as something that can be assessed in
community-based focus groups]{.underline} and targeted by specific,
''local'' policies. [The deeply political origins of both climatic
change and Inuit vulnerability to climatic change are rendered
extraneou]{.underline}s; they are simply not relevant to the question as
it is posed. Indeed, as Li and others would anticipate, the [structural,
systemic, and political--economic dimensions of the climate change
''problem'' must be bracketed out in order to be targeted through
technocratic intervention and expertise]{.underline} (see also Baldwin,
2009; Wainwright, 2010).

### L -- traditional knowledge

[**''Improvement''** has been **central to colonial projects**
for]{.underline} decades and even [centuries,]{.underline} Li argues,
and [efforts to improve target populations in colonial and neocolonial
contexts invariably confront a tension between a desire to improve a
colonized group and a belief in the fundamental difference and
distinctiveness of the colonizing group]{.underline}. There is a basic
contradiction, Li observes, between believing that the colonized are
utterly different than their colonial masters, a distinction that itself
justifies colonial rule, and the desire to improve the colonized in the
image of the colonizer. This tension between difference and improvement,
Li argues, has been addressed by colonial regimes through at least three
tactics, including: (a) the permanent deferral of the possibility of
improvement on the part of colonized subjects; (b) the hierarchical
division of colonized subjects into more and less improvable categories;
and (c) the promotion of [an understanding of improvement in which
''improvement for natives]{.underline} did not mean becoming like their
colonial masters, it [meant being true to their own indigenous
traditions]{.underline}. It was the task of trustees to improve native
life ways by restoring them to their authentic state'' (15). This third
tactic, I will argue, [is particularly operative in the]{.underline}
human dimensions of [climate change literature, where techniques and
policies aimed at mitigating Inuit vulnerability and improving Inuit
adaptive capacities]{.underline} in the face of climatic change
[emphasize the preservation and restoration of Inuit traditional
knowledges,]{.underline} practices, and skills. They aim, in Li's terms,
to restore Inuit to a more traditional state, as a way of enhancing
their adaptation to a rapidly changing world.

[If we bring together this attention to a governmental ''will to
improve'']{.underline} a politicization of the processes by which
deficiencies and problems are first identified, and then targeted for
improvement in technocratic terms with critiques of the spatiality of
Indigeneity [and the delimitation of Indigenous peoples to the local and
traditional, a critique of recent work assessing community vulnerability
and adaptation to climate change emerges]{.underline}. In the following
section I bring these two critical perspectives to bear on the human
dimensions of climate change literature.

### L -- resilience discourse

#### Resilience discourse is a link -- the construction of community resilience absolves the government over the federal role in creating conditions of vulnerability

Here, the separateness is seen as the state being responsible for the
solution building, while leaving the communities to manage the daily
effects of climate change on their own. The communities remain reliant
on the state-developed solutions, unable to support during the planning
processes. Additionally, while being left to manage the effects of
climate change, [the government also highlights the need to build
'resilience']{.underline}:

> Both technical and financial support is available to build resilience
> through competitive awards for tribally-designed resilience training,
> adaptation planning, vulnerability and risk assessments, supplemental
> monitoring, capacity building, and tribal youth engagement... The
> complexities Tribes are facing are many but throughout this sampling
> Tribes have demonstrated enterprising grit and dedication to
> constructing resilient communities. (BIA, 2020, p. 3)

[Resilience discourse in adaptation takes focus away from the structural
inequalities that have left Indigenous Peoples vulnerable in the first
place]{.underline} (Schlosberg & Collins, 2014, p. 368). Throughout
history, [Indigenous Peoples in the US have had their land and resources
taken from them, leaving them vulnerable to the state. The relationships
established in early years of contact have become encoded in
institutions]{.underline} (Noble, 2016), [and constructions
of]{.underline} 'the savage' or [less-than-human operate to keep
Indigenous Peoples at the bottom of the hierarchy]{.underline}. [Trauma
inflicted by the government and conditions manufactured by policies have
created a system of structural inequality over centuries]{.underline},
leaving Indigenous Peoples in the US marginalized. [Failing to
acknowledge the colonial construction of vulnerability leaves the
responsibility of fixing the vulnerability on the communities
themselves.]{.underline} By bringing attention to the communities'
vulnerability without this historical context, the state is
strengthening the colonial relationship through these policies
(Indigenous Climate Action, 2021, p. 42).

## Permutation

### 2nc -- at: permutation

#### The perm is [anti-political]{.underline} -- it's a way to [preserve]{.underline} status quo relations of colonialism

The human dimensions of climate change literature fails, then, even on
its own terms. It asks ''who and what are vulnerable?''; ''to what
stresses''; ''in what ways''; and ''what capacity exists to cope with
changing risks?'', but it fails to account for some of the most
significant dimensions of Inuit vulnerability to climatic change and
capacities to adapt. [The ''vulnerability approach'' demands
critique]{.underline}, however, not only on its own terms, but also
[from outside its framing of what is at stake in the contemporary and
future Arctic]{.underline}, and on what grounds Inuit might intervene in
their own futures. Following Ferguson (1994), Tania Li observes that
[the **will to improve** can]{.underline} sometimes [be about securing
politics, about **''antipolitics''**]{.underline} (2007, p. 8),
[understood as ''the design of programs as a deliberate measure to
**contain a challenge to the status quo''**]{.underline}. One need not
argue that [this realm of]{.underline} research and [policy-making is
deliberately aiming to contain and secure the politics of climatic
change to interrogate its anti-political effects]{.underline}. Indeed,
scholars working within this framework are immensely committed to
carrying out research that will positively contribute to pressing
contemporary dilemmas. But as Li observes, [the will to improve
is]{.underline} precisely [defined by its practitioners' genuine desire
''help'' a target population, desires]{.underline} and intentions
**[that do not]{.underline}** necessarily **[correspond with
outcomes]{.underline}**. [To the extent that the human dimensions of
climate change literature frames Inuit vulnerability and adaptation to
climatic change as a ''local'' matter,]{.underline} a matter in which
only the ''traditional'' and the Indigenous is at stake, and even then
only in specific and limited ways, and that it is received as a
comprehensive and systematic understanding of ''local'' vulnerabilities
to climate change, [it **renders extraneous and illegible pressing
political concerns** and dimensions of climatic change in the
region]{.underline}. [It implies that the appropriate place of Inuit is
at the ''local'' community center, participating in focus
groups,]{.underline} assessing changes in local ice and weather
patterns, [not at the meetings where territorial claims will be
decided]{.underline}, [shipping routes negotiated, or military
infrastructure established]{.underline}. [It **perpetuates a colonial
preoccupation with tradition and its contamination by
modernity**]{.underline}, and reinforces an assumption that Inuit
knowledge and concerns about climate change are limited to a narrowly
conceived and externally defined ''traditional'' realm. As such, the
literature perpetuates the delimitation of Inuit political interventions
into climate change to the local and traditional.

#### The logic of pragmatism is historically responsible for colonial violence. The K doesn't preclude action -- but the [right]{.underline} kind of action matters, like focusing on the [causes]{.underline}, not adaptation. The perm is the wrong starting point

Finally, [some might argue that the urgency of climatic change
demands]{.underline} immediate action and the implementation of
[specific policies]{.underline} and programs, a process [that
necessarily requires pragmatic, simplified framings of complex
situations]{.underline}. [From such a perspective, to delay]{.underline}
taking action on climatic change while we work out the complexities of
(neo)colonial formations would be folly, and [would endlessly defer
concrete action]{.underline}. In response, [it is crucial to observe
that colonial history is replete with examples of sweeping interventions
that were justified precisely through their urgency]{.underline} (see
e.g., Mitchell, 2006). [This dynamic has been observed in the Canadian
North, where crises around perceived depletion of wildlife justified
extensive intervention into Inuit hunting practices]{.underline}
(Kulchyski and Tester, 2007), [the perceived urgency of defending
Canadian sovereignty **rationalized forced displacement**]{.underline}
(Tester and Kulchyski, 1994), and the perceived urgency of protecting
seals from slaughter led to the collapse of trapping economies across
the Arctic (Wenzel, 1991). [The point is not to delay action on climatic
change, but rather to undertake action that addresses precisely the
issues and concerns that have repeatedly been identified by northerners,
and to do so in a way that attends to the inevitable risks of
well-meaning, benevolent intervention]{.underline} into Inuit lives and
livelihoods. As Kusugak (2002, p. vi) observed almost a decade ago,
''finding examples of effects of climate change is easy and endless.
Like acupuncture, \[Inuit\] know that the pain is much in their
homelands but the needles have to be inserted in the south, since that
is where the disease really is.''

#### Climate justice [limits the power]{.underline} of resurgence movements. Claims the perm decreases state authority ignore that every part of the state's existence serves to reinforce colonialism

5.5.3 Lived Effects

While the journeys of these three communities started decades ago,
[Kivalina, Newtok, and Shishmaref still remain rooted in their original
locations]{.underline}. [The community of Newtok has made significant
progress,]{.underline} with some of its population living in the new
site (GAO, 2022, p. 29), but Kivalina and Shishmaref have made little
progress towards their relocations (Palinkas, 2020, p. 131; GAO, 2022,
p. 33). Bronen and Chapin (2013) argue that the disparity between Newtok
and the other two communities is due to Newtok working primarily with
state agencies rather than federal (p. 9323). Additionally, Newtok
pooled its resources and efforts into creating the NPG which was able to
bring different agencies at the state and federal level together
(Bronen, 2015, p. 127). What is noteworthy about the NPG is that the
initiative was started and continues to be driven by the village of
Newtok. As [Neale]{.underline} et al. (2019) [point out,]{.underline}
"\[i[\]nitiatives to create new Indigenous-led or collaborative forms of
environmental management can be both 'decolonising' and 'experimental',
as they can politically and legally displace settler power and
authority]{.underline}, though their ultimate dimensions, effects and
outcomes are uncertain" (p. 346). While not disagreeing entirely with
Neale et al.'s argument, [it is]{.underline} also [worthwhile to
consider how these acts of "redistribution of legal and political
authority]{.underline}" (Neale et al., 2019, p. 346) **[reinforce an
asymmetrical relationship]{.underline}** **[and management of
responsibility in acts of self-determination]{.underline}** where
communities use their own resources to bring the government to the table
(Noble, 2015). Indigenous leadership on environmental adaptation
projects, such as relocation, needs to rest on an understanding of
climate justice, where the state is able to leverage resources to
support Indigenous efforts and address its contribution to on-going
emissions. Through support of these efforts and Indigenous stewardship,
Neale et al. (2019) argue that these actions represent a "decolonising
renovation of the political and practical dominance of settler agencies"
thereby reducing the authority of the state (p. 355).

What these cases show is that [whether or not the communities are
leading relocation efforts, they are **still constrained by the same
colonial system.**]{.underline} [The prolonged condition of the
communities also reflects that]{.underline} [response to climate change
and Indigenous Peoples is not reliant on the political party in
power]{.underline}. The argument could be made that a Democrat
government would open up more public spending, such as Biden's
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Office of the Federal Register,
National Archives and Records Administration, 2021), however the
communities have remained immobile under both Democrat and Republican
governments (and Independents in Alaska). [The structure of governing is
set in how the nation-state is itself constructed, rather than the
actors within it. A system based on coloniality will **retain its
colonial structure** regardless of who resides in the Oval
Office]{.underline}. A governing system existing to sustain a capitalist
economy will not be so easily changed by well-meaning government actors
and bureaucrats. By generating and regenerating IK systems and political
systems (Simpson, 2016; Coulthard & Simpson, 2016), [Indigenous
resurgence provides a community-led means of resistance which challenges
state sovereignty and the nation-state system]{.underline} (Corntassel,
2012). Climate justice also provides an avenue for resistance, albeit
one that conforms to the state system. Climate justice identified how
power structures are reinforced by climate change (Kaijser & Kronsell,
2014) and calls for a redistribution of burdens. [The state is aware of
the current conditions of Kivalina, Newtok, and Shishmaref and has
responded slowly and inadequately]{.underline}. Instead of building
resilience in the communities, the inequalities creating vulnerabilities
need to be addressed (Schlosberg & Collins, 2014). [Climate
justice]{.underline} may call for redistribution of responsibilities and
an intersectional understanding of climate impacts, but this conception
of justice [**may be too narrow for resurgence movement**s, under which
not only the burdens of climate change would be redistributed, but the
structures which create and sustain climate change such as capitalism
would be dismantled]{.underline} (Simpson, 2016).

### AT: Indigenous people demand the plan

#### Community demands for the plan don't absolve the affirmative from the link. Even if their intentions are noble, the [outcomes]{.underline} and [implications]{.underline} of the affirmative still reinforce colonialism

Finally, the critique I have outlined here demands qualification and
contextualization in at least two ways. First, [this critique must
reckon with the fact that the vulnerability and adaptation research
program has itself emerged]{.underline}, in part, **[as a response to
community demands]{.underline}** for localized study of climatic change.
[If individuals and groups residing in ''local'' communities want and
support this]{.underline} form of research, one might ask, [can it still
be characterized as colonial]{.underline}, and to what end? A
comprehensive response to this question would require another paper, but
a partial response would point to work by both Indigenous and
non-Indigenous scholars highlighting the problems with assuming that
colonial formations position people in two opposing camps, where all
that non-Indigenous peoples do, feel, and think is ''colonial'', and all
that Indigenous peoples do, feel, and think is not (see, for example,
Alfred and Corntassel, 2005; Coulthard, 2007; Stoler, 2008). [People
engage in research for a range of purposes, and neither researchers nor
participants necessarily anticipate the **outcomes and implications of
projects in advance**]{.underline}. Organizations like Inuit
Qaujisarvingat, the Inuit Knowledge Center at Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami,
actively foster partnerships with non-Inuit researchers to investigate
issues of pressing concern to Inuit, and see such partnerships as
important components of their mission to ensure an increasingly active
role for Inuit at all levels of research. Such [partnerships do not
necessarily release non-Inuit researchers from their positions as
inheritors of colonial systems of knowledge and practice]{.underline},
however, [nor do they certify that all dimensions of the research itself
are in keeping with Inuit interests, values, and concerns]{.underline}.
Neither do such partnerships disqualify critical interrogation of the
cumulative, broader effects of a literature. To fully reckon with the
legacy of colonial histories and their ongoing formation in the present,
as articulated in and through research in the Canadian Arctic, would
require much more than the perspectives offered here, but [community
partnership]{.underline}, I would argue, [is only one]{.underline} (very
complex and contested) [dimension of this problematic]{.underline} (see
also de Leeuw et al., forthcoming).

## Impact

3.3.2 Settler Colonialism

Settler colonialism is a distinct formation of colonization. [Settler
colonialism is "a structure of domination that is]{.underline} partly
[predicated on the ongoing dispossession of Indigenous Peoples\' lands
and the forms of political authority]{.underline} and jurisdiction [that
govern our relationship to these lands"]{.underline} (Coulthard &
Simpson, 2016, p. 251). Distinguishing settler colonialism from
colonialism lies in the fact that settler colonizers arrived with the
goal of removing Indigenous populations whereas other forms sought
economic exploitation (Hixson, 2013, p. 4). Veracini (2010) defines the
colonization of colonialism as "an expanding metropole that remains
permanently distinct from \[the entity\]" whereas settler colonialism
involves the colonization from within the entity (p. 6). Simply put,
settler colonialism involves the rule from the occupied land, where
other forms rely on administration solely in the colonizing state.

3.4 The Logic of Elimination

The logic of elimination is extensively explored in the work of
Australian anthropologist Patrick Wolfe on settler colonialism. Wolfe's
(2006) theory contends that [settler colonialism as a system exists on
the assumption that Indigenous Peoples of the territory **are to be
eliminated**]{.underline} (p. 387). Land is, for all peoples, necessary
for life; therefore, [when land is expropriated, one life is traded for
another as settler colonialism "destroys to replace]{.underline}"
(Wolfe, 2006, p. 388). Territoriality is "settler colonialism's
specific, irreducible element" (Wolfe, 2006, p. 388). Though initial
contact and invasion can be historically located, **[settler colonialism
is a structure not an event]{.underline}**, [where a new society is
constructed atop the stolen land]{.underline} (Wolfe, 2006, p. 388).
When invasion is seen as a structure not an event, history becomes
dynamic rather than a static collection of events (Wolfe, 2006, p. 402).
When invasion is limited to an event (i.e., frontier homicide), it is
easy to ignore assimilationist policies which have persisted in
governmental systems. [The outcomes of the logic of elimination in the
US include the (attempted) dissolution of Indigenous societies through
individual land rights regimes]{.underline}, boarding school policies,
[differentiated citizenship, and other assimilationist
projects]{.underline} (Wolfe, 2006, p. 388). As Wolfe (2006) highlights,
[the logic of elimination in the US evolved from conquest and a desire
to gain more territory to institutional approaches of assimilation to
avoid challenges to sovereignty and dominion]{.underline} (p. 399). As
Coulthard and Simpson (2016) put forth, settler colonialism has,
"structured its relationship to Indigenous peoples primarily through the
dispossession of Indigenous bodies from Indigenous lands and by impeding
and systemically regulating the generative relationships and practices
that create and maintain Indigenous nationhoods, political practices,
sovereignties, and solidarities" (p. 254). [Settler colonialism requires
the deterritorialization of Indigenous Peoples while simultaneously
denying Indigenous populations of state-making capacity]{.underline}
(i.e., self-determination) (Veracini, 2010, p. 105). The dissolution of
Indigenous societies is the goal for settler colonialism to allow
settler culture to flourish unencumbered.

3.5 Connections & Tensions of Poststructural and Decolonial Thought

Coleman and Rosenow (2023) claim that "no attempt to understand power
can exist outside of the very relations of power that it seeks to
theorise" (p. 1). Both decolonial and poststructural theory take up
power as a main concern though how it is theorized remains distinct to
each school of thought. Where poststructural theories point to a diffuse
power wrapped in governing, decolonial theorists point to colonialism
and the structures left in its wake as the point of departure.
Foucault's (2007) theory of governmentality is connected to history of
feudal states turned nation-states, though he pays little attention to
the work of colonialism and empire in governance. A decolonial critique
of poststructuralism would then be the overreliance on the French canon,
where the structure of capitalism remains central with little
consideration of colonialism and their relationship. However, it is also
true that some decolonial scholars use critical theory understandings of
power structures as a starting point for the development of decolonial
thought (Coleman & Rosenow, 2023, p. 11). Coleman and Rosenow (2023)
argue that in reconciling critical and decolonial theory and praxis,
solving the tensions is not always necessary:

> thinking through struggle as experiment is a call to embrace a degree
> of dissonance, not to always feel the need to resolve tensions, or to
> work within a coherent 'theoretical framework' ... it is vital not to
> enclose everything in a fixed framework but instead, through attention
> to the praxis of struggle, to persistently be open to the possibility
> of what Foucault once called a "way out". (p. 17)

To embrace a rigid framework and limit discourse, the fields of
decolonial and poststructural thought become bounded and circumscribed,
while embracing epistemologies rooted in the critique of hegemonic
thought.

[Understanding contemporary Indigenous-State relations requires a
perspective keen to settler colonialism and the logic of
elimination]{.underline}. To understand current policies directed
towards Indigenous Peoples, [one must view them considering a governing
system that was predicated on the extermination and then subjugation of
these communities]{.underline}. Foucault (1991) argues that "[the state
can only operate on the basis of other, already existing power
relations]{.underline}" (p. 64). If governmentality is to be understood
as the practices and strategies of governing and the ways in which the
government structures relations between itself and its citizens and
between its citizens, then governmentality cannot be divorced from
colonialism in the case of the US. Mignolo (2023) argues that the system
of coloniality and the technology through which it is reproduced creates
inequalities and thus to address them the focus cannot be on the
inequalities per se, but by addressing assumptions and beliefs which
"undergird and sustain the visible aspects of inequalities" (p. 45).
This process cannot be addressed through public policy but by shifting
people's knowledge, beliefs, and how they relate to each other (Mignolo,
2023, pp. 45-46). This systemic level of critique is in accordance with
poststructural thought, public policy cannot address inequality, but it
can signal changes in governing. [Governments are molded and shaped by
the systems it is embedded in]{.underline}, so changes in governing must
be tied to changes in the system. [This is where the **power of
resurgence and Indigenous sovereignty can challenge the nation-state**
and these hegemonic systems]{.underline}. [By providing alternative
governing structures, **Indigenous sovereignty can institute governance
set on other modes of thinking and being**, such as grounded
normativity]{.underline}. [Grounded normativity challenges the
state-centric model as it works from the ground up, the way individuals
live moves outward to family then community then nation]{.underline}
(Simpson, 2016, p. 23).

The term \'decolonisation\' has become commonly used in both academic
and social justice circles---perhaps to the detriment of the clarity and
meaning of the term---to describe the goals of a wide variety of social
movements, from the Rhodes Must Fall campaign to abolitionist struggles
against borders, prisons and police. It is a concept that references the
reshaping of the globe under, first, European imperialism and, as a
consequence, settler and neocolonialism1---processes that are continuing
to the present day. The concept of \'resurgence\' holds an important
place within the broad rubric of decolonisation. [Resurgence is an
identifier applied to particular land-based, self-determining, political
and material practices (or movements).]{.underline} These are performed
by Indigenous individuals, collectives and communities intended to
generate decolonial spaces and futurities for Indigenous Nations and
Peoples[. It is simultaneously a strategy and an ethos predicated
on]{.underline} prefiguration and [ethical consistency between goals and
the means deployed to pursue them]{.underline}, the necessity of
mutually sustaining relations between humans, the land and the
more-than-human world, [and the incommensurability of Indigenous
autonomy and settler colonial sovereignty.]{.underline} That
incommensurability is practically understood to mean that [challenges
facing Indigenous Nations]{.underline} and communities [cannot be
\'solved\' by state policies because]{.underline}, regardless of the
party in power, [the state structure itself is colonial and **requires
the ongoing elimination** of Indigenous nationhood and sovereign
capacity]{.underline}. As such, Indigenous resurgence is most commonly
articulated as the embrace of Indigenous nationhood, including
recognising the incredible diversity of national identities and
ambitions among Indigenous societies in place of (or against) settler
colonial nation- alisms. Simultaneously, [resurgence is founded on the
notion that state responses to Indigenous needs and demands, from
legislation to funding opportunities]{.underline}, almost **[always lead
to the recapture of Indigenous lands]{.underline}** [and the
**recolonisation of Indigenous Peoples**]{.underline} as \'Indians\' and
other subjective categories defined by settler colonial governments.

Indigenous resurgence entered wider academic and public use in the
second decade of the 21st century in Turtle Island/North America in
connection with Indigenous-led social movements, including the diverse
trans-Canadian and international set of protests under the banner of
Idle No More (2012; see Kino-nda-niimi Collective, 2013; Cobum, 2015),
the NoDAPL occupation and protest in the territory of the Standing Rock
Lakota, near present-day North Dakota (2016; see Estes, 2019), and the
ongoing Unist\'ot\'en reoccupation of traditional territories by
Wet\'suwet\'en people in opposition to both pipeline expansion and
police incursion (Barker & Ross, 2017; McCreaiy & Turner, 2018;
Midzain-Gobin, 2019), among many others. Indigenous resurgence refers to
an approach to Indigenous liberation that considers the violence,
dispossession and marginalisation faced by Indigenous People
(historically and in the present) and centres the transmission and
practice of specific and land-based family, community, nation or
confederation teachings. As such, the Indigenous resurgence is land
centred and place specific, oppositional to (settler) colonialism and,
by extension, racial capitalism and the state. It is rooted in
generating strong Indigenous communities that prefigure autonomous
futures as part of anticolonial resistance, survivance (Vizenor, 2008,
2009) and the regeneration of traditional Indigenous social and
governing structures.

Resurgence has primarily been used to describe Indigenous movements that
seek to directly embody place-relationships (and place-thought: Watts,
2013) as a diverse form of direct action against colonial settler acts
of elimination and erasure. As Pasternak (2014) describes, settler
colonialism can often be understood as the assertion of territorial
jurisdiction. Soguk (2011) articulates Indigenous resistance in the
context of modernity as a form of \'transversality\'---a refusal to be
absorbed into systems of modernity, including nation-states and
citizenship, regimes of labour and categories of race. Resurgence can be
said to refer, then, to the collected set of strategies, tactics and
approaches to embodying Indigenous place-relationships as a direct and
intentional refusal and transgression and simultaneous reclamation and
reassertion of Indigenous nationhood, sovereignty and
self-determination.

As mentioned at the outset, resurgence must be understood through the
framework of decolonisation---the two terms are complementary but not
identical. If decolonisation is a \'goal\'---for Indigenous Nations to
achieve a state of autonomy and restored relations with traditional land
bases and territories---then \'resurgence\' is one strategy for
Indigenous People to pursue that goal. In the tradition Tuck and Yang
(2012) established, decolonisation must include the actual return or
restoration of land to Indigenous control and a radical redistribution
of social, political and economic power. This is, as they recognise,
bound to be a contested process that a colonial power will heavily
resist on multiple axes: the authority of the state defending itself,
white supremacy mobilising white settlers to enact frontier violence,
individual investment in systems of private property and wealth
compelling the mobilisation of resources in broad opposition to such
disruption, and many others. Due to decolonisation meaning different
things in different places and being a contested process, it is, by
definition, uncertain and contingent. [Resurgence can be understood as
an attempt by Indigenous national communities to strategise the most
effective ways to contend with these broad systems of colonial control
while centring Indigenous relationships to land at all
times]{.underline}---a grounded but dynamic process of pursuing,
renewing, defending and enlivening collective Indigenous relationships
to land and place.

Resurgence is an approach informed by traditional Indigenous forms of
resistance to colonial imposition and control and broader social
movements. These include the alter-globalisation movements of the 1990s
to 2000s, anarchist currents of the \'newest social movements\' (Day,
2005)2 and considerations of \'anarcho-indigenism\' (Alfred, 2005;
Khasnabish, 2011; Lasky, 2011), and international Indigenous-led
movements, most especially the Zapatistas (discussed further below).
These social movements were collectively in opposition to neoliberal
globalisation, the industrial capital and international economic
governance, which generates deepening levels of inequality, mass
displacement and dispossession, and racial and class-based oppression
(among many others). The movements helped reveal the operation and
limits of state power in support of the global capitalist system. One of
those limits is the ability to provide justice, restitution or
reconciliation for Indigenous Nations within states that continue to
premise their sovereignty on constructs such as *terra nullius*, which
are inherently colonial and reinforce the ongoing erasure of both
Indigenous People and Indigenous territorial jurisdictions. As such, in
one of the foremost articulations of resurgence, Anishinaabe author,
artist and activist Leanne Betasamosake [Simpson]{.underline} (2016)
[directly contrasts resurgence with \'justice\', which she frames as a
term co-opted by the state.]{.underline} [With the settler state as the
arbiter of justice, colonising Indigenous national territories is framed
as necessary and thus \'just\'.]{.underline} Simpson also makes the
distinction between cultural resurgence and radical resurgence, noting
that the former can take the form of language, arts and religious
practices, which state governments and institutions like universities
may co-opt. At the same time, the latter is tied to a core political
project---the regeneration of self-governing capacity alongside the
assertion of territorial authority---which is not so easily commodified.
[Resurgence,]{.underline} therefore, [starts from the premise that
fundamentally challenging colonial elimination and environmental
destruction must **begin from outside of state systems**]{.underline}.
[It should stand in opposition to all impositions of colonial
sovereignty and jurisdiction]{.underline}---though not in opposition to
treaty relationships and other partnerships in which policies and
practices of coexistence are mutually agreed upon rather than imposed.

#### Protest is a better method of resisting settler colonialism -- the state will never make meaningful concessions and the very terms of negotiation reinforce a colonial relationship

**Yaaw Koo.èex' is an annual "Indigenous protest organized by the
Kiks.ádi to draw attention to the repeated refusal of the Board of
Fisheries to respond to Native concerns over the decreasing herring
population"**

The sense of urgency to protect the herring, and the profound loss felt
by the Tlingit, Haida, and Ts'msyen communities when they can't give or
receive herring eggs are strongly evidenced during [the Board of
Fisheries]{.underline} (BOF) [public comment process]{.underline}. Every
three years, the Sitka Tribe submits three or four proposals to the BOF
requesting the commercial fishery be more conservatively managed. In
response the commercial fisherman, processors, and their lobbying groups
submit counter proposals (and counternarratives). Dozens of Native
people testify about the importance of herring to our way of life. The
BOF is a process, however, that [is unable to attend to or even
comprehend what herring means to the Indigenous people of
Alaska]{.underline}. [Despite BOF members' stated attempts to reach
decisions that are "best for everyone," it will ultimately never be a
process that works to protect the interests of Native people because it
is at a fundamental level about competing expressions of
sovereignty]{.underline}.

[Tribal sovereignty in the U.S. was never truly about recognizing the
inherent authority of Indigenous peoples to govern themselves. Rather,
Tribal sovereignty was about granting Indigenous people enough
**authority to be able to sign away their land**]{.underline}. [It was a
way for colonial governing bodies to formalize land-theft and
paternalism over Indigenous people who were never really viewed as
human]{.underline} in the first place. Since the signing of the
Declaration of Independence, we have been conceptualized as "merciless
indian savages" (Jefferson 1776), our cultures, values, political
systems, and kinship all deemed unintelligible and animalistic. While it
would be unacceptable to say such words in the public today, the
[racialized logics]{.underline} that underscore such phrases [still
manifest themselves in the paternalistic management of our lands and
waters]{.underline}. For example, [the state's perpetual refusal to
codify any laws that would protect subsistence for Native people based
on cultural value. To do so would be to recognize that Indigenous
cultures have equal rights to exist alongside "White" culture, and it
would as well be an admission of Native peoples' equal sovereign
authority]{.underline}. That is, [any meaningful recognition by the
state of Native peoples' capacity to govern ourselves, would in turn
call to question their own authority to control the land, water, and
resources]{.underline}.

[The Yaaw Koo.èex' is thus a Tlingit response to the failures of settler
governance structures]{.underline} to appropriately respond to herring
issues after years of trying--and failing-- to protect the herring
through the BOF process. [It is a community response, using
relationality, love, and respect]{.underline} towards the herring that
is [illegible to settler narratives and governance
structures.]{.underline} [Such events are becoming increasingly more
common in Alaska.]{.underline} [We have learned that the state has
never, and **will never**, do anything that serves the best interests of
Native people]{.underline}. This is, in part, because as Harjo (2019)
notes, [the formalities of colonial governance structures are too
burdensome to support community-oriented actions that Native people
require]{.underline}. [They are steeped in formalities that "foreclose
the possibility of communities enacting their wishes and ... can
reproduce normative settler colonial governance structures that shift
power from the collective of everyday folks to the elites, putting
decision-making in the hands of a few"]{.underline} (Harjo 2019, 12).
Thus, [more and more community-oriented expressions of sovereignty are
taking place in people's everyday lives or through community engagements
that can disrupt the formalities of settler governance
structures]{.underline}.

#### Any gains made by the plan will be rolled back via other policies -- only continual direct action can challenge settlerism

While beyond the scope of this article to examine, this argument
suggests that [nondominant societal groups seeking to advance policy
change]{.underline} on serious challenges facing them [should consider
carefully the utility of strategies that primarily appeal to elected
policy makers]{.underline} or state institutions that are electorally
accountable to the dominant societal group. Successful mobilization of
security discourse may be unavailable, such that attempting to
securitize even those issues relevant to their very survival will offer
little prospect of political success. While this argument may be
generalized to other nondominant groups, it appears particularly salient
for Indigenous peoples. Indeed, [if Indigenous and decolonial scholars
are correct that "eliminating the native]{.underline}" (Wolfe 2006) [is
the ultimate goal of the settler state, then there is actually a
specifically perverse incentive for state authorities not to act on
Indigenous peoples' security claims]{.underline}. [Threats to Indigenous
peoples may weaken their capacity to claim or assert self-determination
in ways that challenge the assertion of settler
sovereignty]{.underline}. Likewise, environmental threats due to natural
resource extraction simultaneously undermine Indigenous peoples'
connections to the land by degrading the natural environment while
promoting the settler state's dual purposes of assimilating Indigenous
peoples by making them reliant on the state for subsistence and
providing the natural resources sought by the settler capitalist
economy.

By contrast, security discourse and securitization are not the only ways
for nondominant groups to frame their concerns. Other discourses,
institutions, and mechanisms exist for Indigenous peoples and other
nondominant groups to pursue redress or effective policy responses.
Rather than "security," discourses of sustainability, resilience,
morality, or justice that possess different logics and means of
appealing to an audience offer alternate possibilities for catalyzing a
response to environmental and other harms facing Indigenous peoples.
[Practically, pursuing legal action has produced significant gains for
Indigenous peoples]{.underline}, including with specific respect to the
question of Indigenous title over land and consultation and consent over
land use in traditional territories. Jurisprudence---such as New Zealand
Māori Council v. Attorney-General in Aotearoa New Zealand, and
Tsilhqot'in Nation v. British Columbia and Clyde River (Hamlet) v.
Petroleum Geo-Services Inc. in Canada---has been far more significant in
terms of defending the interests of Indigenous peoples against state
power than attempted securitization.

If Indigenous peoples choose to work with and through settler
institutions, it would seem that the legal system offers more welcoming
terrain than the structurally inhibited pursuit of securitization. This
implication is particularly relevant given the considerable effort
expended by Indigenous peoples and their institutions in articulating
their priorities as security concerns in order to mobilize an adequate
state response. [But insofar as claims made to or through settler legal
systems are subject to similar structural problems such as the
presumption of settler sovereignty to determine legal disputes, the
possibilities for radical emancipation or Indigenous self-determination
is unlikely to be realized through the courts]{.underline} either. In
the end, [the survival and well-being of Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}---whether framed in terms of security, rights,
resilience, or some other central concept---[will continue to rest
primarily on Indigenous communities asserting their interests
through]{.underline} a variety of means, including [direct action and
civil disobedience, rather than seeking state recognition]{.underline}
(Coulthard 2014). Indeed, some of the most important breakthroughs for
Indigenous negotiations with the state have occurred after direct action
by Indigenous peoples in defense of their territory (Belanger and
Lackenbauer 2015).
