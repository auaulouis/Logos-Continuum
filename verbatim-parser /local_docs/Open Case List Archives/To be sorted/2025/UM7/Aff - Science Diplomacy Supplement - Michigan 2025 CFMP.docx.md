Irina Panyushkina is a dendrochronologist --- a scientist who studies
tree-ring dating to understand past environmental conditions --- at the
University of Arizona. In early 2022 she was planning to do summer
fieldwork in Siberia, for her research on the links between climate
change, Russia's freshwater systems and Arctic ice formation. Her work
had already been delayed years by Covid-19. Then Russia invaded Ukraine,
and it slammed to a halt again. Dmitry [Nicolsky, a geophysicist at the
University of Alaska]{.underline} at Fairbanks [who researches thawing
Arctic permafrost, managed to stay in touch with some of his
Russia-based colleagues as the war started to unfold. But over time that
contact stopped, and with it key information-sharing]{.underline}.
Florian Stammler, an anthropologist at the University of Lapland in
Finland, was unable after the invasion to return to Russia's Sakha
republic in northeastern Siberia, where he'd long been measuring the
impact of global warming on the nomadic, reindeer-herding Nenets people.
These projects represent a small fraction of the Arctic climate research
that's been derailed by the war in Ukraine. Studying the fast-warming
top of the planet is crucial to efforts to mitigate global warming and
understand its dynamics at lower latitudes. Arctic climate scientists
tend to be a close-knit community, as normal professional rivalries are
flattened by the borderless, existential threat of climate change. But
the war upended that status quo: Now geopolitics are a main determinant
of whether scientific projects can move forward. Most EU and
[[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} member [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} have
suspended or [sharply [limited funding]{.mark} [for]{.mark} scholarly
[work involving Russia]{.mark},]{.underline} a country that holds
roughly half of the world's Arctic territory. [[Sharing data
is]{.underline}]{.mark} largely [[banned]{.mark} and the limited
communication that's still possible is nerve-wracking]{.underline}, [as
[former]{.mark} scientific [colleagues worry about]{.mark} [jeopardizing
each others']{.mark} [careers]{.mark} or safety.]{.underline} Finding
ways to restart stalled science will be a recurring topic of
conversation at a major Arctic conference in Iceland this week, where
for the second year in a row, Russian scientists will not be present.
Asia will play an increasingly pivotal role in the Arctic, having
heavily invested in polar science capabilities in recent years, said
Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, former president of Iceland and the conference's
chairperson, in an interview on the eve of the gathering. "Japan, Korea
and China have modernized their research vessels with ice capability
more than any other country in the world in the last five to 10 years,"
Grimsson said. A fundamental question for delegates to consider is
whether "meaningful Arctic science" and "meaningful global climate
science" can be done at all without access to data from Russia's Arctic,
Grímsson said. [Nicolsky's research on permafrost has been supported by
the National Science Foundation]{.underline} ([NSF]{.mark}), [one of the
major American bodies that [stopped funding new projects involving
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} under White House guidelines. [**The NSF
also pulled out of** most existing projects]{.underline}, unless they
could be adjusted to focus on non-Russian parts of the region. (A
European Commission decision had a similar impact on European funding.)
[The project [involved]{.mark} collecting [temperature readings
from]{.mark} more than 250 [permafrost]{.mark} monitoring sites in
Russia]{.underline}, Alaska and Canada, and mapping key changes. Arctic
permafrost is estimated to hold 1,700 billion metric tons of frozen and
thawing organic carbon, at least twice what's already in the Earth's
atmosphere. As it thaws, that gas is released, accelerating warming,
which in turn speeds up thawing in a dangerous cycle. [[Most of the
planet's permafrost lies within Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and Nicolsky
was relying on Russian colleagues to collect that data. "We cannot
remove this piece from the equation," he says. "[It's l[ike
**removing**]{.mark} **a couple of [wheels from a car]{.mark} [and
trying to drive it home]{.mark}**]{.underline}." He's spent hours poring
over legal documents, trying to find a clear path to continue working
together. [While the NSF did not withdraw funding, Nicolsky's
collaborators in Russia are unsure whether it's safe to accept it, or
even to communicate with US-based scientists]{.underline}. Last year he
was still able to receive some data out of Russia, "but this year it was
just gridlock," he says. "I spent countless meetings trying to
facilitate collaboration with our Russian colleagues, to find different
means, and it was falling apart from both ends, on the Russian side and
on the US side." A fractured Arctic Council It's not just communication
breakdowns. Nicolsky adds that [[the logistics system underpinning
Arctic research --- helping scientists ship equipment across borders and
facilitating visas --- is]{.mark} fundamentally
["broken]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark} Much of that kind of support
had been provided by the Arctic Council, a pan-governmental group of
Arctic nations formed in 1996 that includes Russia. A week after the
invasion of Ukraine, it suspended all activities. The Council had been a
critically important body for bringing states and Indigenous groups
together on Arctic issues, leading to legally binding agreements on
matters such as scientific cooperation, search and rescue operations and
marine pollution. Prior to the war in Ukraine, a Council working group
was studying a possible pan-Arctic agreement to fight and prevent
wildfires, of the kind that tore through Siberia and Canada in recent
years. That and other work has gradually resumed, though not at the
normal speed or level, says Morten Hoglund, the Norwegian chair of the
Council. Since his country assumed the rotating position from Russia in
May, Hoglund has worked to find a way to unstick the body, which
operates by consensus. A decision in August to allow member countries to
communicate in writing, without having to meet, is an important step
toward easing logjams and eventually allowing a few key projects to move
forward. Still, the Council is not yet in a position to approve new
projects, and even if they were, "there are layers of challenges, not
only political but also practical," that discourage collaboration with
Russia, he says. "We have to be realistic." [[Progress
will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[depend]{.mark} more [on the
willingness of]{.mark} the Council's Western [nations to engage]{.mark}
with [Russia]{.mark} than the other way around,]{.underline} says
Jennifer Spence, a public policy expert with Harvard University's Arctic
Initiative. "[It **[wasn't]{.mark} [Russia blocking anything]{.mark}**,
it was the]{.underline} seven [other]{.underline} like-minded
[state]{.underline}s," she says of the Council's paralysis. "In many
ways, [[Russia]{.mark} has been [ready to come to the table]{.mark} from
day one and been pretty open about the fact that they wanted the Arctic
Council to continue to function]{.underline}."

#### Non-russian Arctic states are collaborating over permafrost research, but Russia is the missing piece.

Historically, [**[Arctic research]{.mark} has been [defined by
collaboration]{.mark}**. Many permafrost researchers have established
personal and professional connections across country
borders.]{.underline} However, due to the political climate, these
relationships of scientific collaboration have been severed or weakened.
The scientific loss has been felt beyond permafrost research.
Ecologists, geologists, oceanographers, biologists, and researchers in
countless other fields have suffered without access to key collaboration
and data in Russia[. **Arctic science [has had to adapt]{.mark}**,
[pivoting away from Russia]{.mark} [to focus on Canada]{.mark}, [Norway,
Sweden, Greenland, Finland]{.mark}, the Faroe Islands, [and
Iceland]{.mark}]{.underline}; meanwhile, Russian collaboration has
increased with China. [Researchers are making do with the resources they
have, **[but the isolation of Siberia]{.mark} [has put Arctic science
further behind]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An example of this pivoting is
the [United States' increased investment in Alaska]{.underline}. One
project is a US\$11 million new research building, funded by the US
Department of Defense. This building is an addition [to [Alaska\'s
Permafrost Research]{.mark} Tunnel]{.underline}
[[Facility]{.underline}]{.mark}---which has been operating since the
1960s---[to improve core sample analysis]{.underline}. The new facility
will enable in-house laboratory processing of permafrost samples and
improve real-time data tracking. Similarly, many researchers are
increasing investment in permafrost measurement methods that are less
intensive and reliant on fieldwork**[. Field researchers]{.underline}**
have attempted to circumvent Siberia by turning to similar climates
or---in the case of projects involving sites in Russia and other
countries---**[shifting their focus to non-Russian
regions]{.underline}**. For example, the [[Nunataryuk]{.underline}
p]{.mark}roject---which ran from 2017 to 2023 to investigate Arctic
coastal impacts of permafrost thawing---removed its site in northeast
Siberia and [focused more on its other regions **of Canada, Greenland,
Svalbard, and the Beaufort Sea**]{.underline}. Other permafrost projects
have been unaffected since they were constructed without Russia,
including the [[FluxWIN]{.underline}]{.mark} project, which ran from
2020 to 2024 to investigate seasonal variations in greenhouse gas
emissions in Finland. However, as a whole[, the lack of access to
Siberia and its data has forced Arctic scientists to rethink their
approaches]{.underline}.

#### Without Russian data, permafrost models are biased, making it impossible to mitigate permafrost thaw

[A new study]{.underline} published in the science journal Nature [sheds
new light on how [Russia's]{.mark} [invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine
[hampers]{.mark} the collection of [scientific]{.mark} [data]{.mark}
across the Arctic. The researchers looked at the world's largest network
of high-latitude research stations]{.underline}, called the
International Network for Terrestrial Research and Monitoring in the
Arctic (INTERACT), [to determine what biases are introduced into the
system when Russian data is excluded]{.underline}. [The impact of
lacking [Russian]{.mark} data over the past 24 months is especially
[significant as]{.mark} the country [accounts for]{.mark} the
[majority]{.mark} [of]{.mark} Arctic [landmass]{.mark}]{.underline} and
more than half of the Arctic Ocean's coastline. The scientists concluded
that [[some biases]{.mark} are **[so significant]{.mark}** that [it will
be]{.mark} [hard to distinguish between shifts]{.mark} caused [by
climate]{.mark} change [and]{.mark} those caused [by]{.mark} the
[exclusion of Russian data]{.mark}]{.underline}. [With parts of the
Arctic warming at four times the rate as the rest of the planet, the
collection and assembly of **[ground-based]{.mark}**
[observations]{.mark} across the region forms a [key]{.mark} tool [to
assessing]{.mark} how the [Arctic]{.mark}'s climate state is
changing]{.underline}. [Now data is predominantly coming from
**non-Russian**]{.underline} parts of the [Arctic.]{.underline} The new
study aims to determine how impactful the lack of Russian data is on the
overall results. To quantify the effort the researchers looked at eight
key variables, including annual mean air temperature, total
precipitation, snow depth, soil moisture, vegetation biomass, soil
carbon, net primary productivity and heterotrophic respiration. The data
comes from a network of 60 stations located above 59° N, of which 17
stations are located in Russia. The researchers emphasized that even
with all Russian stations included the network's data contains a certain
bias as the stations are "generally located in the slightly warmer and
wetter parts of the Arctic" and in areas which generally experience
deeper snowpacks and are thus not fully representative of the pan-Arctic
ecosystem. However, [the loss of the Russian stations further erodes the
representativeness across almost all ecosystem variables]{.underline}.
This is especially true for Russia's extensive taiga forests across
Siberia, which are now fully excluded from the data set. A dangerous
blind spot [The researchers warn]{.underline} that
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} blind spot [will **severely
[hamper]{.mark}** []{.mark}the [tracking]{.mark} of the global
implications of [thawing permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline} across vast
swaths of Russian Arctic lands. [Permafrost has been called a "**ticking
time bomb** below our feet," as it holds vast stores of CO₂ and
methane]{.underline}, two powerful greenhouse gasses. [As the soil warms
it also has a detrimental effect on Arctic infrastructure.]{.underline}
The findings suggest that the variability and bias introduced by
excluding the Russian stations is "of a similar magnitude as the shifts
inflicted by almost 80 years of projected climate change." [It
will]{.underline} thus [be challenging to understand what shifts were
the result of climate change and which are introduced by the lack of
data.]{.underline} The study concludes that "because of the geopolitical
consequences of the Russian attack on Ukraine, the ability to both track
and further project the development of the Arctic biome following
climate-induced ecosystem change has deteriorated." [[This]{.mark} lack
of understanding]{.underline} in turn [**[will reduce the ability to
design initiatives to]{.mark}** help **[mitigate]{.mark}** some of the
negative consequences of climate **change**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
will [reduce the effectiveness of]{.mark} already **[existing
programs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The researchers call on the
international community to "strive for establishing and improving a
research infrastructure and standardized monitoring programmes
representative of the entire Arctic." They conclude that "until that is
implemented, the ability to support and advise local and global
communities will decrease further due to the loss of Russian stations
representing half of the Arctic's landmass."

Unfortunately, [only a [small minority of global-]{.mark}scale climate
[models incorporate permafrost thaw,]{.mark} and [none]{.mark} of these
represent processes other than [gradual]{.mark}
thaw[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Models used to inform nationally determined
contributions under the Paris Agreement, for example, failed to account
for key processes that can greatly accelerate permafrost thaw rates and
carbon emissions, notably abrupt thaw and wildfires in Arctic regions
(Baillargeon et al., 2021). For almost a decade, the IPCC has reported
with high confidence the likelihood of a permafrost carbon feedback on
global climate. Yet, the IPCC reports low confidence when it comes to
assessing the timing, magnitude, and form (carbon dioxide or methane) of
this feedback. The latest Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) made a
significant step forward as it was the first time that permafrost carbon
was included in the Earth System Models that informed the IPCC report
(Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, CMIP6) (Ciais et al.,
2013; IPCC 2018; Canadell et al., 2021) (IPCC, 2021). However, just two
of 11 ESMs in CMIP6 included permafrost and neither of these models
represented abrupt thaw, wildfire-mediated thaw, or the release of
carbon from below-ground combustion during wildfire (Canadell et al
2021, Natali et al., 2022). Improving certainty of permafrost thaw for
more effective mitigation and adaptation policies. While rapid progress
is being made by the scientific community in this area[, the sparse
nature of **on-the-ground** measurements combined with the scale and
complexity of Arctic regions and **limitations on funding** relative to
the need for improving permafrost representation in models remain a
considerable challenge to progress]{.underline} (Natali et al., 2022).
[This ongoing scientific challenge highlights the need to more
effectively and expeditiously communicate the science of permafrost thaw
to key decision-makers and for decision-makers to then integrate this
science into ambitious climate policy.]{.underline} [Advancing Arctic
carbon monitoring and [modeling]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [necessary]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} truly [understand the magnitude]{.mark} and timescale [of
permafrost]{.mark} [thaw]{.mark} emissions]{.underline}---**[and
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}** accordingly. Permafrost emissions could
take up as much as 40% of the remaining carbon budget to stay below 2°C
warming (Gasser et al., 2018). [That fraction is even higher if the goal
is limiting warming to 1.5°C---the threshold at which we can expect to
trigger a critical tipping point for permafrost, ice sheets, and coral
reefs]{.underline} (Armstrong McKay, et al., 2022). [Resolving
scientific uncertainty surrounding permafrost thaw is therefore critical
for ensuring the accuracy of the United States' carbon budget and
national ambition]{.underline}. [The potential harm from neglecting
permafrost thaw cannot be overstated. [Even the most alarming
projections]{.mark}]{.underline} of 3-41 GtCO₂ per 1°C [of
warming]{.underline} by 2100 [likely **[underestimate]{.mark}** [the
potential]{.mark} [of permafrost]{.mark} carbon
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baillargeon & Natali, 2021; Natali et
al., 2021). While the Administration has committed to reducing emissions
by 50% from 2005 levels by 2030, this goal will likely be insufficient
if the carbon budget does not account for permafrost thaw. [[Resolving
scientific uncertainty is]{.mark} also [a **prerequisite**]{.mark}
**[to]{.mark} [informing]{.mark} [adaptation]{.mark} policies** that
better respond to the urgent and severe impacts of permafrost thaw on
Arctic communities.]{.underline} Federal emergency response and disaster
relief programs, including those under the 1988 Robert T. Stafford
Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act ("Stafford Act"), often do
not consider slow-onset impacts of permafrost thaw, and state, local,
and tribal governments are simply not equipped to the hazards of
permafrost thaw without federal support (Bronen, 2021). As communities
realize the limits of their capacity to adapt to climate change in their
current locations, some are considering relocation as the only viable
long-term option. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO)
recently concluded that more than 70 out of over 200 Alaskan Native
villages face significant threats from erosion, flooding, or thawing
permafrost (GAO, 2022)--nearly a decade after the GAO identified 31
Alaskan villages in such a position (GAO, 2009). Despite efforts by
three Alaska Native communities to fully relocate, to date, no village
has successfully completed this process. Instead, communities are facing
insurmountable obstacles, citing a lack of governance framework,
dedicated federal funding, and government support to facilitate
relocation efforts (Bronen and Chapin, 2013; Bronen 2021).

#### These adaptation measures [will slow the rate]{.underline} of permafrost thaw. That's key to solve every scenario.

1\. Introduction Permafrost is essential in the Arctic region as it
plays a significant role in undergirding the ground, thus supporting
infrastructure and countering erosion, which can be globally impactful
(Beer et al., 2020; Larsen et al., 2021). In addition, [permafrost is
vital in storing carbon[.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, [the Arctic has
experienced increased temperatures]{.underline} in the past few decades,
[driving permafrost to thaw and releasing greenhouse gases]{.underline}
(GHG) into the atmosphere (Schuur et al., 2022). The thawing of
permafrost has large-scale environmental implications and impacts the
economy and culture of coastal communities and beyond (Beer et al.,
2020; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2022; Lamoureux
and Lafreniere, 2018). Fig. 1, produced by the European Space Agency\'s
(ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) permafrost project (Obu et al.,
2021), shows the spatial distribution of permafrost active layer
thickness across the northern hemisphere. The intensive, ubiquitous
burning of fossil fuels since the mid-1800s has led GHGs to spike in the
atmosphere, which is responsible for the permafrost melt in various
areas, including the Arctic (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Schuur, 2016).
Between 2007 and 2016, for instance, the ground temperature near the
depth of zero annual amplitude -- i.e., the depth at which annual
temperature fluctuations are dampened to less than 0.1 °C -- in the
continuous permafrost zone increased by 0.39 ± 0.15 °C (Biskaborn et
al., 2019). Due to decreasing ice cover over most Arctic regions, the
'snow-ice albedo feedback' has been affected. As a result, less solar
radiation is reflected, and more heat is absorbed on the surface,
causing further warming and thus increasing permafrost thawing (Riihelä
et al., 2021). Permafrost contains carbon-based organic matter, consumed
by microorganisms whenever it thaws, releasing methane (CH4) and other
gases (Masyagina and Menyailo, 2020), which, in turn, impacts microbial
communities (Lamoureux and Lafreniere, 2018). Moreover, the current
[permafrost thaw will likely intensify]{.underline} under this
century\'s projected [global warming and the release of substantial
amounts of GHG, exacerbating the problem]{.underline} (Schuur et al.,
2015). Since soil respiration responds to warming more strongly in
colder climates than in warmer ones, these emissions are of particular
concern (Carey et al., 2016), resulting in increased CO2 emissions and
CH4 (Grant et al., 2019), thus intensifying climate change. Moreover,
wildfires\' increasing occurrence and broadening (Kasischke and
Turetsky, 2006) are powerful yet underestimated stressors in fragile
permafrost contexts (Gibson et al., 2018). 2. The impacts of permafrost
thaw Continuous and discontinuous permafrost covers about 15 % of the
land surface in the northern hemisphere (Smith et al., 2022; Obu, 2021).
This figure highlights the urgency of addressing climate change and
protecting permafrost. Retreating and spatial shifting in the
distribution of frozen ground alters the forest cover, hydrology,
species habitats and human life in the areas affected (Czerniawska and
Chlachula, 2020). The thawing of permafrost not only exerts consequences
on terrain, ecosystems and infrastructure but may also delay or impair
international efforts concerning sustainable development (Hjort et al.,
2022; Leal Filho et al., 2022, Leal Filho et al., 2023) and CO2
abatement (Schuur et al., 2022; Turetsky et al., 2019), influencing the
various climate scenarios (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), 2022). Fig. 2 captures some of the multi-faceted, diverse
impacts of permafrost depletion. The anatomy of the rock and sub-soil
structure involved in how permafrost unfolds and the spatial extents,
geometry, and shallow-seated mechanism of how the affected terrain
ruptures due to thawing (Smith et al., 2022) unveils a peculiar shallow
behaviour. For instance, thawing has waned the concrete integrity of the
ground/foundations where infrastructure has been built over the decades
(Hjort et al., 2022; Langer et al., 2023). Threats to existing
infrastructure related to permafrost thawing include active layer
thickenings and thaw-related hazards, such as thermokarst and mass
wasting (Schuur, 2016; Schuur et al., 2015). The risk of
permafrost-related degradation will likely increase significantly by
2050, with infrastructural impairment already documented in swaths of
Russian territory, where many buildings and legacy fuel storage
facilities are experiencing damage and whose leakage (e.g., of old
Soviet-era fuel storage tank ruptures) may pose a further threat to the
environment as well (Langer et al., 2023; Wrigley, 2023). For example,
in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, 30 % of roads were reported to have been
affected (Hjort et al., 2022). In addition, the risk of structural
damage and leakage of hazardous waste is projected to be very
significant over the following decades, whatever the reference climate
scenario (Langer et al., 2023). Apart from causing terrain rupture and
ensuing damage to the built environment, permafrost thawing has been
driving vast alterations to the natural landscapes of the northern
regions since the 1960s (Turetsky et al., 2019). In high-altitude areas
hosting glaciers, rapid transformation due to permafrost degradation has
led to the onset of new lakes and drainage networks, with ensuing
reduced slope stability that may further trigger flooding due to
mobilised deposits and water mass (Haeberli et al., 2017), ultimately
adding potential strain to infrastructure and human life in the exposed
regions. The thawing of permafrost also releases chemical, biological
and radioactive components that have been locked under various forms in
both the cryosphere and the geosphere over the 103--105 yr span,
resulting in vast disruptions of ecosystems, altered wildlife
populations and prospective endangerment to the human health
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2022; Miner et al.,
2021). [Permafrost thaws at different rates]{.underline}
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 2022), [and slower
thawing tends to affect the shallower, more recently frozen
layers]{.underline} of soil, rock and ice, penetrating the deeper
sections of permafrost. However, [abrupt thawing]{.underline}, capable
of dismantling whole rock and soil sections, [affects older, deeper
layers]{.underline} (Turetsky et al., 2019). While the thawing phase
depends on temperature and precipitation changes and may occur
gradually, the rate increases as temperatures are consistently higher --
all the more in Arctic regions -- and vast areas and volumes of
permafrost can be lost per decade (Turetsky et al., 2020). 3. Moving
forward: addressing an issue more global than commonly perceived The
[**rapid depletion** of permafrost in the Arctic threatens efforts to
reduce global warming]{.underline}. In addition, [it heightens climate
change in other regions]{.underline} (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC), 2022; Masyagina and Menyailo, 2020) to the extent that
may elude -- both in space and time -- the assumed geographic boundaries
of cold permafrost regions "up North". Despite ample literature, this
has contributed to a somewhat slow and sparse perception throughout
societies of the phenomenon, its long-time onset, and its cascading
spatial effects (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
2022). Abrupt thawing occurring through extreme temperature fluctuations
can expose older permafrost horizons more rapidly than earlier
estimated. Depending on local conditions and the rock and soil fabric
involved, such a phenomenon may initiate the release of compounds from
deeper layers much faster than expected (Turetsky et al., 2019). There
are also concerns that permafrost degradation will eventually expose
ancient burial sites, thus possibly reviving vectors that, under
present-day temperature conditions, could spread deadly infections or
allow the re-emergence of pathogens, thus potentially endangering human
health (Huber et al., 2020). Therefore, actionable, effective [solutions
are needed to **slow down the rate** at which permafrost thawing
grows]{.underline} -- including the engagement of the public discourse.
[Some]{.underline} of the [measures which may help]{.underline} to
handle permafrost thawing [are:]{.underline} i) [Installing [permafrost
insulation to shield]{.mark} permafrost [from the]{.mark} heat of the
[sun]{.mark}]{.underline} and other environmental factors affecting the
terrain\'s integrity. [This could include insulation boards and thermal
blankets]{.underline} around buildings, pipelines, and other structures
built on permafrost. ii) [Planting more [cover
crops]{.mark}]{.underline} can help [[to keep permafrost
cool]{.underline}]{.mark} and stabilise the ground. Perennial grasses
and trees can provide shade, which can help reduce the permafrost thaw
rate. In addition, these plants may help to keep the soil moist and add
organic matter to help improve the soil quality. iii) [Facilitating
[groundwater recharge can]{.mark} help [keep permafrost
cool]{.mark}]{.underline} and reduce the thaw rate. This can be attained
[[by constructing rainwater harvesting]{.mark}
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline} and using porous pavings to increase the
amount of rainwater stored in the ground. iv) [[Improving snow
cover]{.underline}]{.mark} can help keep permafrost cool and reduce the
thaw rate. This can be done [[by planting trees and shrubs to create
shade]{.mark} or using snow fences]{.underline} to accumulate snow and
reduce the speed at which it melts. Permafrost melting is an urgent
environmental issue, as it can contribute to global warming and impact
the environment in a diverse range of issues across vast regions.
Reducing GHG emissions to address this issue, a critical driver of
permafrost melting, is crucial. It is also essential to understand the
local impacts of permafrost melting, such as increased flooding,
erosion, and water and soil contamination. In some areas, protecting
infrastructure, ecosystems, and communities from the effects of
permafrost melting becomes necessary. In summary, the depletion of
permafrost is a serious problem because it has several negative impacts.
For example, it can: • Destabilise infrastructure, such as roads and
buildings. • Increase the risk of flooding and landslides. • Release
CH4, a potent GHG, into the atmosphere. • Disrupt ecosystems and food
webs. Therefore, GHG emissions need to be reduced to slow the thawing of
permafrost and reduce its negative impacts. Finally, [it is vital to
[**monitor permafrost more intensively** to **detect early signs** of
melting and **ensure appropriate measures can be taken**]{.mark}
promptly]{.underline}.

Over the past four decades, the issue of climate change has just grown
to encompass interconnected and systemic pressure that exert systemic
pressures on human societies (Bauer, 2011; Ripple et al., 2023). From
freshwater scarcity to extreme weather events, the current shift in the
Earth's climate regime indicates that we are entering a period of
instability as the Holocene equilibrium is no longer consistent due to
long-standing anthropogenic perturbations (Lawrence et al., 2024).
Therefore, climate change is transforming from a scientific concern to a
global security issue that must be addressed on an institutional,
ethical, and legal basis (Goldstein, 2016). As we move out of a
relatively stable planetary regime, our primary concern as a collective
species is to anticipate and predict the outcome of these changes and
their magnitude. In other words, what seems extreme now may well become
the normality of the planet of tomorrow. In this context, [[the
cryosphere]{.underline}]{.mark} -- consisting of Earth's ice sheets, sea
ice, permafrost, polar oceans, glaciers, and snow -- [[is "ground zero
for climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}" (ICCI, 2023). [Its systemic
destabilization as a result of continued global temperature rise
indicates a dire vulnerability to climate regime
disruption.]{.underline}

Over the course of the last five decades, [the [Arctic]{.mark} region
has [warmed]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly [[four times faster]{.mark} than
the global average rate]{.underline} underlining the rapid change in the
polar area, a phenomenon called Arctic amplification (Drüke et al.,
2024). As such, [[the polar region]{.mark} has a specific centrality in
the global climate system as it [is home of several key tipping
points]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}Armstrong McKay et al., 2022;
Hansen et al., 2016; Lenton, 2012; Lenton et al., 2019). As defined by
Rahmstorf (2024), [a tipping point is "a point]{.underline} at
[which]{.underline} further development into a fundamentally different
state [becomes an unstoppable self-sustained process, driven by
reinforcing feedback effects]{.underline}". To sum up, [the influence of
the [polar region]{.mark} is [so critical that it may tilt the Earth's
climate]{.mark} [regime]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among the tipping points
identified[, permafrost thaw is of particular concern because of its
potential for]{.underline} adverse local impacts and its role as [a
catalyst for broader, long-term feedbacks]{.underline} (Nitzbon et al.,
2024). Given its potential role in the ongoing climate crisis and the
formation of positive feedback loops, permafrost thawing is a strategic
issue for the international community. Within this paradigm, the
scientific community plays an instrumental role in implementing a new
international security regime by acting as an operational stakeholder in
the monitoring and analysis of the biophysical dynamics in the polar
region.

3.1. The case of permafrost

Due to the rapid anthropogenic climate change, [one of the major threats
to the stability of the Earth's climate regime is related to the thawing
permafrost]{.underline}. Permafrost covers ∼25% of the land surface of
the Northern Hemisphere, partly mapped in the Arctic (i.e., 13--18
million km2). In total, the permafrost stores an estimated 1100--1500
billion metric tons of soil organic carbon, which upon thaw can be
decomposed into carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide
(N2O) -- all of them greenhouse gases (GHG) (Hugelius et al., 2014). In
scientific terms, permafrost is defined by the temperature at which the
ground remains at or below 0 C degree for at least two consecutive
years. As Westerveld et al. (2023) remind us, "as long as permafrost
stays frozen, the organic carbon within it will remain locked in the
ground". However, [an [accelerating warming]{.mark} climate threatens to
[release]{.mark} this [stored carbon]{.mark}]{.underline} (C) [massively
[into]{.mark} the [atmosphere]{.mark} through widespread microbial
decomposition]{.underline}. While the Arctic permafrost soils are among
the largest reservoirs on Earth, [the]{.underline} long-term [risk lies
in the possibility that the polar region could [become a C pool
source]{.mark} -- rather than of a C sink -- [resulting in a positive
climate]{.mark} [feedback mechanism]{.mark}]{.underline}, known as the
permafrost carbon feedback (PCF) (Miner et al., 2022; Schuur et al.,
2015; See et al., 2024). With respect to the Arctic tundra, [conversion
to a C pool source may already be occurring, signaling a shift in the
permafrost regime]{.underline} (Natali et al., 2024). In recent decades,
changes in the thickness of the active layer of permafrost (i.e., the
seasonally unfrozen surface layer) have been observed, suggesting that
the current rate of thawing is faster than predicted by models (Turetsky
et al., 2019; Westerveld et al., 2023). Projections of continued
temperature increase under IPCC Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs,
replacing RCP scenarios) indicate further warming of permafrost, while
the scientific community discusses the potential for non-linear system
behavior. In such a scenario, this process could in turn accelerate PCF
with potentially higher GHG emissions being released to the atmosphere
(Biskaborn et al., 2019; Nitzbon et al., 2024; Schaefer et al., 2014).
According to future projections, estimated GHG emissions from
terrestrial permafrost thaw would range from 100 to 240 billion tons of
C by 2100 based on different climate change scenarios (Meredith et al.,
2019). However, [there is a lack of clarity regarding "the timing,
magnitude and the relative roles of CO2 versus CH4 as feedback
processes]{.underline}" (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2021), [and large
uncertainties notably in respect to abrupt thaw events and biological
interactions co-occurring with warming]{.underline} (see for instance
Keuper et al., 2020). Given that the release of C emissions into the
atmosphere has a cumulative effect, the resulting change in the chemical
composition of the atmosphere is projected to persist for several
centuries. Furthermore, [CH4 is a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas
that could accelerate further positive climate feedback loops, which
could eventually lead to a **runaway** feedback effect]{.underline}. In
this context[, scientific [collaboration to monitor]{.mark} terrestrial
[permafrost]{.mark} in the Arctic highlights the [critical]{.mark}
[long-term]{.mark} security [implications.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[For the [Russia]{.mark}n territory, this is a critical area as
[approximately]{.mark} [65%]{.mark} of its soils consist of
[permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, [the western Russian
Arctic permafrost is degrading most rapidly compared to the rest of the
polar region,]{.underline} as shown by long-term terrestrial permafrost
monitoring records from the mid-1970s to the early 2020s (Vasiliev et
al., 2020; Westerveld et al., 2023). Based on monitoring evidence,
Western Siberian peatlands, a major C stock, and the Northern European
region of Russia have experienced large changes in the active layer
thickness, which "increased by as much as 0.4 m between 2009 and 2019"
(Westerveld et al., 2023).

#### Runaway warming from permafrost thaw uniquely causes extinction.

Though small or local ecosystems may collapse from time to time from a
variety of causes, [scientists are becoming aware of the possibility
of]{.underline} large-scale, or even [global, ecosystem collapse as a
consequence of [global warming,]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly under
a Plan A scenario. Perhaps the [most obvious]{.underline} such event
[would be the [collapse of]{.mark} the [oceanic ecosystem]{.mark}
resulting from [ocean acidification]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} which
would destroy coral reefs and prevent the formation of the calcium
skeletons or exoskeletons of many marine animals, but most pertinently
of foraminifera, which are the base of many oceanic food chains.
Attention has also focused on the possibility of more extensive collapse
on land. A 2004 study (Thomas et al. 2004) found that under a business
as usual scenario, 15--[37 percent of land animal and plant species
would be committed to extinction by 2050]{.underline}. Griffin notes
that a 2007 study concluded that the [[plankton]{.mark}, edible fish,
[bees, and topsoil,]{.mark} all of them [**essential to human
survival**,]{.mark} are [in]{.mark} severe [danger]{.mark}]{.underline}
and their loss must be averted. A comparative study of historical
extinction rates with those of today concluded that species are now
disappearing at a rate 1,000 times that of the past and that we are
facing a major extinction crisis comparable to the end of Cretaceous
extinction event that spelled the end of the dinosaurs and large numbers
of other species (Pimm et al. 2014).

An important study discussed by Griffin attempts to recognize [planetary
boundaries that must be observed to prevent global ecosystem
collapse]{.underline} (Rockström et al. 2009). The idea is that as the
earth transitions from the Holocene (the geological epoch that began
following the latest glacial era, about 10,000 years ago) to the
Anthropocene (a proposed geological epoch that began at the dawn of the
industrial revolution or later in recognition of the substantial human
im- pact on the earth's geology and biosphere, including climate
change), many of the conditions that permit the maintenance of the
global ecosystem are being altered beyond the bounds that held sway
during the Holocene. The authors ask what the non-negotiable global
preconditions are that we need to respect in order to avoid catastrophic
environmental change on a planetary scale. They refer to the
preconditions as thresholds---a concept that is similar to the tipping
points we have already discussed with respect to irreversible changes
brought on by climate change. Transgressing one or more of these
thresholds could lead to an abrupt change in the global ecosystem. Since
we have no precise knowledge of these thresholds, in particular when, or
under what conditions, they would be triggered, the authors call for
study of the dynamics of these thresholds and the associated feedbacks
on a continental and global scale. They suggest that we agree on a set
of boundaries within which we can expect to operate safely. At one point
it was assumed that a 4°C rise in global temperatures would provide
safety for global ecosystems, but [most scientists]{.underline} later
came to [believe that no more than a 2°C rise will guarantee
safety]{.underline}. However, Rockström et al. (2009) proposed that a
safe boundary would be an increase of no more than 1.5°C. They recognize
nine planetary boundaries, of which three have already been passed.
These include atmospheric CO2 concentration and loss of biodiversity.
They urge that we do what can be done to repair or mitigate the
boundaries that have been passed and also to ensure that no further
boundaries are passed.

Griffin agrees with numerous scientists that [the release of [methane
from permafrost]{.mark} in the Arctic poses the **[greatest
threat]{.mark}** of collapse of the [global
ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline}. Permafrost is the expanse of soils in
the Arctic that has been frozen since the most recent glacial period. It
contains vast amounts of carbon from dead animals and plants, primarily
in the form of methane. It is estimated that [the carbon in the
permafrost constitutes half of all the carbon stored in the earth's
soils]{.underline}. If it were all to be released, [[it would
constitute]{.mark}]{.underline} four or [**[five times]{.mark}** [all
the carbon that has been released by human activity since
1850]{.mark}]{.underline}. The concern is heightened because [the Arctic
is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet, which makes thawing
of the permafrost, and the consequent release of methane, even more
likely.]{.underline} This is particularly so, since most of the carbon
is in the top three meters of the permafrost. If the permafrost is on
dry land, the carbon will be broken down by oxygen-breathing bacteria
and released as CO2, whereas if it is below a wetland, it will be
released as methane, which is a far more potent greenhouse gas than CO2.
It was once thought that the release of methane from permafrost was a
minor problem that would take place only in the distant future. But
[there is]{.underline} now [strong evidence that the release is
[happening now]{.mark}.]{.underline} In recent years, the shallow waters
off [the [Arctic coast]{.mark} of eastern Siberia]{.underline} on what
is known as the Arctic shelf [is saturated with methane]{.underline},
which was later shown to be arising from underwater permafrost. [If
business as usual continues, the release of even a portion of the
methane stored in the shelf is released, that could trigger substantial
abrupt warming]{.underline}. Because of the increased warming, [the
methane release will become self-sustaining as a [positive feedback
loop, leading]{.mark} **to runaway warming** and [**ecological
collapse**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In 2013, it was discovered that
permafrost in the Antarctic region is also subject to warming and
release of carbon.

#### SCENARIO 2: DISEASE. 

#### Permafrost thaw exposes deadly pathogens.

Moreover, [85% of the Arctic's large permafrost communities]{.underline}
(i.e., defined as those with at least 5000 inhabitants) [are situated in
Russia]{.underline} (Westerveld et al., 2023). The degradation of
terrestrial permafrost, therefore, presents particular challenges to
human security. At the socio-economic level, the Russian Arctic is
characterized by a more extensive and dense infrastructure, including
roads, railways and urban infrastructure consisting of significant large
cities (e.g., Norilsk, Vorkuta, and Yakutsk). These infrastructures are
threatened by thermokarst processes, which are ground subsidence caused
by thawing permafrost. The bulk of the aging infrastructure was
constructed during the Soviet era. However, the country is currently
experiencing unprecedented impacts and financial costs related to its
infrastructure as a result of large-scale permafrost degradation
throughout this century. According to Streletskiy et al. (2023), the
financial burden of the permafrost degradation on all types of
infrastructure in the Russian Arctic is estimated to range between USD
97.5 billion (the lowest estimated figure) and USD 152.8 billion (the
highest estimated figure) over the coming decades. With respect to
public health, the [thawing]{.mark} of [permafrost]{.mark} may [result
in]{.mark} the [release of pathogens]{.mark} [that have been trapped
within the soil]{.mark} for an extended period, potentially exposing
human communities that have settled in these areas. [The significant
reservoir of pathogens]{.underline} [and their range (i.e., bacteria,
fungi, and viruses)]{.underline} [raises the possibility of their
activation as permafrost thaws under changing Arctic conditions, thereby
[increasing]{.mark} the prospect of [disease
emergence]{.mark}]{.underline} (Christie, 2021; Miner et al., 2021; Wu
et al., 2022). In [2016,]{.mark} an [outbreak of]{.mark} the
[anthrax]{.mark} disease in the Siberian Arctic [spread across the
region]{.mark} due to increasing temperatures (Stella et al., 2020).
This event [occurred after a severe heat wave thawed]{.mark} an
[infected frozen reindeer carcass]{.mark}, highlighting the increasing
risk of contaminant release to water quality, wildlife, and human health
from permafrost thaw (Langer et al., 2023).

In the long term, [permafrost thaw represents a significant and alarming
threat to Russia's political and socio-economic stability, as it would
have the potential to jeopardize the country's public policy strategy in
the Arctic,]{.underline} which has been planned over the past decades[.
Such a scenario would have implications for Russia's future governance
in terms of national security]{.underline}, ultimately impacting the
international security regime. [Given the complexity of permafrost
monitoring, scientific cooperation plays an important role in further
advancing knowledge and providing a better projection of future changes
in the stability of terrestrial permafrost]{.underline} and thermokarst
processes in the Arctic region and potential global PCF impacts.

#### Exposed Arctic diseases are uniquely existential due to the lack of a contemporary immune response.

Ecoscience at Aarhus University in Roskilde, Denmark. "Join forces to
counter Arctic pandemic threat" Nature, 9/5, v 633, accessed via

[The Arctic is under stress]{.underline}, that much is known. Between
1979 and 2021[, the region warmed four times faster than the global
average]{.underline}, with effects --- as yet poorly understood --- on
its ecology and ability to store carbon, on global sea levels and on
wider ocean-circulation and weather patterns.

Add in the effects of biodiversity loss and pollution, and people often
refer to a triple planetary crisis. I think we should actually be
talking about a quadruple crisis. Since starting research in the Arctic
in 1997, I have spent nearly all of my summers there, monitoring changes
in pollution levels, habitats and food webs using a 'One Health'
approach that integrates effects on wildlife, humans and ecosystems. And
it's becoming clear that, as the Arctic warms, its environment degrades
and human activities increase, new health threats are emerging. In
particular, [the [Arctic is likely]{.mark} to become a [**hotbed for
zoonotic diseases**]{.mark} that spill over into humans from other
animals]{.underline}. That threat was brought home to all of us by the
COVID-19 pandemic. We need to take seriously the possibility that [the
[**next pandemic**]{.mark} could come from the north.]{.underline}

Some [[60% of emerging infectious]{.mark} [diseases]{.mark} [are
zoonoti]{.mark}]{.underline}[c]{.mark}. Their emergence and spillover is
in general highly interlinked with habitat degradation, biodiversity
loss and foodweb changes --- all of which are present in the Arctic. But
a warming Arctic harbours other risks. As sea ice thaws, 'forever
chemicals' are increasingly being transported into Arctic environments.
These include mercury, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and
polychlorinated biphenyls, all known to modulate human and animal immune
systems and increase vulnerability to respiratory infections. Invasive
fish and whale species are also bringing in industrial chemicals and
their own diseases.

The pathogens enter an environment in which some native species, such as
polar bears (Ursus maritimus), have not been exposed to them, and so are
at increased risk. [The release o[f ancient microorganisms long
frozen]{.mark} in ice and sediments as the landscape thaws adds to this
danger: humans and other wildlife are likely to **[lack]{.mark} [any
immune defences]{.mark}** []{.mark}against them.]{.underline}

[These risk factors are set to increase. The first ice-free Arctic
summers could come as early as the 2030s.]{.underline} The Arctic Ocean
has huge potential for energy, fishery and tourism sectors, and is not
subject to any global treaty regulating its exploitation. Further
wildlife disturbance, pollution, overfishing and jurisdictional
conflicts are the likely result.

The current perception is that the Arctic possesses relatively low
microbial activity. Compared with temperate and tropical latitudes, many
fewer resources are devoted to studying zoonoses in the Arctic, with
sparse surveillance for emerging threats in most areas. This needs to
change --- taking account of human, animal and wider environmental
perspectives.

#### Exposed diseases can also be co-opted for bioweapons, causing existential pandemics. COVID doesn't thump but is our uniqueness.

The devastating impact of [[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 has
[highlighted global vulnerabilities to high-consequence biological
events]{.underline}. The international community was woefully unprepared
for [a pandemic]{.underline} that has [[led]{.mark} [to millions of
deaths and trillions]{.mark}]{.underline} of dollars [[in]{.mark}
economic [losses]{.mark}]{.underline}, and has upended daily life.
However, notwithstanding the severe damage caused by
[COVID]{.underline}[-]{.mark}19, it [should be viewed as a **[warning
shot]{.mark}**]{.underline}.1 It will not be the last pandemic humanity
faces, and [[the next]{.underline}]{.mark} high-consequence [biological
event could be]{.underline} as destructive or [substantially
worse]{.underline}.

We define [global catastrophic biological risks]{.underline} (GCBRs) as
biological events of tremendous scale that [could cause **[severe damage
to human civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, potentially
[[jeopardizing]{.mark} its]{.underline} long-term
**[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 The Johns Hopkins Center for
Health Security has also developed a working definition of GCBRs,3 and
this term is part of a broader discussion about global catastrophic
risks that could arise from a variety of sources, including nuclear war,
anthropogenic climate change, and advanced artificial intelligence that
has not been sufficiently safeguarded.4,5 [[GCBRs could be caused
by]{.mark} a naturally emerging [infectious disease]{.mark} outbreak,
[an accidental release of a pathogen, or a deliberate
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Naturally emerging infectious disease
outbreaks that can grow into [pandemics are likely to increase in
frequency due to urbanization, globalization, and environmental
degradation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the world faces an increasing
risk of high-consequence biological events resulting from accidental or
deliberate misuse of]{.underline} the tools of modern bioscience and
[biotechnology]{.underline}.6-8 Not all outbreaks or global pandemics
will grow to the scale of a GCBR as we define it in this article and as
others have defined global catastrophic risks more broadly, because the
threshold for this type of event is extremely high.

[Although COVID-19 does not rise to the level of a GCBR-scale event, it
has demonstrated that a biological event can have a devastating global
impact]{.underline}, and it should serve as a warning to global leaders
that the world needs much more robust protections against
high-consequence biological events that could emerge in the future and
be substantially worse.

In our view, human-caused biological events involving the accidental or
deliberate misuse of an engineered pathogen are more likely to lead to a
GCBR-scale event than a naturally emerging pandemic.9 [Scientists have
the capacity to deliberately or inadvertently **engineer pathogens**
that are more virulent and transmissible than what nature creates by
chance]{.underline}, and the upper limit of damage that could be caused
by a human-engineered biological event is unknown.10-12 [Prevention,
**early detection**, and **rapid response** are all crucial for guarding
against GCBR-scale events]{.underline}. However, in this article, we
focus on effective strategies for preventing biological events that
could become GCBRs, specifically by disincentivizing development and use
of biological weapons by states and other powerful actors.

#### Collaborative permafrost research also creates "monitoring" in the region, which is key to combat disease outbreaks and bioweapons.

Whilst the current likelihood of the release of a contagious pathogen
from permafrost is likely to be low at present, the current Covid-19
pandemic demonstrates the need to take the risk of such an occurrence
seriously. Increasing levels of human contact with thawing permafrost
directly driven by climate change, as well as increased oil, gas, and
mineral extraction in the [Arctic]{.underline} circle,
[will]{.underline} only [increase [the chance of pathogens being
released from]{.mark} thawing [permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
particular, the [evidence suggests that the likelihood of localised
outbreaks due to spore-driven pathogens, that cause diseases such as
Anthrax]{.underline}, is at least moderate and [[should be taken]{.mark}
extremely [seriously]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[However, with increased preparedness, monitoring, and surveillance, the
threat from such pathogens **could be minimised**]{.underline} to a
great extent. For example, pre-emptive monitoring and surveillance to
detect Anthrax outbreaks should be targeted towards the 13,885 cattle
burial grounds scattered across northern Russia \[6, 28\], whilst local
and historical records can be used to identify more high-risk sites in
other parts of the Arctic Circle (e.g., in Scandinavia and North
America). The same approach is also likely to be useful for identifying
old sites of mass graves for the bubonic plague and Spanish flu using
historical records. [[Early monitoring]{.mark} and surveillance in
high-risk areas [could catch dangerous pathogens]{.mark} [before they
become]{.mark} a [serious]{.mark} problem]{.underline}.

Such monitoring and surveillance should also consider human exploitation
of the Arctic Circle for oil, gas, and mineral extraction, which may
lead to novel pathogen exposure events. Organisations need to
acknowledge the biosecurity risks involved in undertaking these
activities and ensure adherence to strict biosecurity protocols, so that
risk is minimised for humans in contact with permafrost soils.
Ultimately, to ensure organisations are held accountable for their
actions, local and international laws may need to be considered to
regulate activities in the Arctic Circle from a biosecurity perspective
\[40--42\].

[Effective [surveillance]{.mark} and monitoring for potential outbreaks
will [require]{.mark} strong [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} between
local and international public health organisations (such as the World
Health Organisation (WHO)), and [[between governments]{.mark} of
countries [where]{.mark} most of the Northern Hemisphere's [permafrost
exists]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., the [USA]{.mark}, Canada,
[Russia]{.mark}, Norway, Finland, and Sweden \[40--42\]). Whilst such
cooperation may be challenging, [the consequences of being unprepared to
contain and respond to developing outbreaks of novel pathogens from
permafrost could represent a serious threat for the global economy and
society]{.underline}, as demonstrated by Covid- 19. Therefore, it is in
the mutual interests of all nations to cooperate in the monitoring and
surveillance of novel pathogen outbreaks from permafrost.

It is also important to acknowledge that [[pathogens]{.mark} [have
been]{.mark} previously [used to manufacture]{.mark} and test
[biological weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} (mostly by governments in
relation to Anthrax-causing B.anthracis pre- and post-World War II
\[43\], but also more recently in a 2001 attack via letters in the US
postal system \[44\]). Therefore, [there is clearly potential for groups
or [organisations with malicious intent to]{.mark} [extract]{.mark} and
modify [microorganisms frozen in permafrost]{.mark} for dangerous
agendas and purposes]{.underline} \[45--50\], [[making]{.mark} strong
[international cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} and leadership from the
WHO [[even more important]{.underline}]{.mark} in this regard.

Ultimately, tackling the climate crisis and limiting global warming
according to the Paris Agreement will help to address the major driver
behind permafrost thawing and potential release of pathogens. The risk
posed by thawing permafrost, on top of the myriad of threats already
posed by climate change, should inspire all nations to take their
commitments to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions seriously.

Conclusion

The more that human civilisation extracts and exposes permafrost
directly or indirectly through physical exploitation or climate change,
the greater the likelihood that novel pathogens may be released and
cause death and disease in human, animal and plant populations.
[Underestimating the threat of novel pathogens]{.underline} from unusual
sources [has been shown to carry serious consequences for **all human
civilisation**]{.underline}, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic.
Although the likelihood of a pandemic caused by pathogens in permafrost
is relatively low compared to zoonoses (e.g., Covid-19), the risks posed
by permafrost-related pathogens must be taken seriously. Creating and
implementing appropriate biosecurity management plans in areas of
greatest risk could save many lives and livelihoods. The effectiveness
of these plans at controlling any outbreaks from permafrost will
ultimately depend on strong international cooperation and regulation by
public health organisations and governments.

#### SCENARIO 3: RUSSIAN ECONOMY. 

#### The Russian economy is at the brink\-\--government initiatives are key to avert recession.

(Maxim Reshetnikov - Russian Official Economy Minister) II Norah

ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) --- [Russia's]{.mark} [economy]{.mark} is
"[on the [brink of]{.mark} going into a [recession]{.mark}," the
country's economy minister said Thursday, according to Russian media
reports.]{.underline}

Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov delivered the [warning at the St.
Petersburg International Economic Forum, the annual event in Russia's
second largest city designed to highlight the country's economic prowess
and court foreign investors.]{.underline}

Russian business news outlet RBC quoted the official as saying "the
numbers indicate cooling, but all our numbers are (like) a rearview
mirror. [[Judging by]{.mark} the way [business]{.mark}es currently feel
and the [indicators,]{.mark} we are already, it seems to me, on
the]{.underline} [brink of going into a recession."]{.underline}

The economy, hit with a slew of [sanctions]{.underline} after the
Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, has so far
[outperformed predictions.]{.underline} High defense spending has
propelled growth and kept unemployment low despite fueling inflation. At
the same time, wages have gone up to keep pace with inflation, leaving
many workers better off.

[Large recruiting bonuses for military enlistees and death
benefits]{.underline} for those killed in Ukraine also have put more
income into the country's poorer regions. But over the long term[,
[inflation]{.mark} and a [lack of foreign]{.mark} [investments]{.mark}
[remain threats]{.mark} to the economy]{.underline}, leaving a question
mark over how long the militarized economy can keep going.

[Economists have warned of [mounting pressure]{.mark} on the economy and
the likelihood it would stagnate [due to lack of investment]{.mark} [in
sectors other]{.mark} [than]{.mark} the [military]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Speaking at a forum session, Reshetnikov said Russia was ["on the
brink," and whether the country would slide into a [recession]{.mark} or
not [depends on]{.mark} the [government's actions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"Going forward, it all depends on our decisions," Reshetnikov said,
according to RBC.

RBC reported Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Central Bank
Gov. Elvira Nabiullina gave more optimistic assessments.

Siluanov spoke about the economy "cooling" but noted that [after any
cooling]{.mark} "[the [summer always comes]{.mark}," RBC
reported.]{.underline}

Nabiullina said Russia's economy was merely "[coming out of
overheating]{.underline}," according to RBC.

#### Sanctions don't thump, but establish the brink.

The impact of Western [[sanctions]{.underline}]{.mark} on the Russian
economy remains hotly debated. While the sanctions imposed in response
to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine have [[yet]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[produce]{.mark} the kind of [economic]{.mark}
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} that [many [analysts]{.mark} were
[anticipating]{.mark}]{.underline} in early 2022, the effectiveness of
these measures remains difficult to quantify and should not be
dismissed. Tellingly, while Putin insists sanctions have not hurt
Russia, the lifting of all sanctions remains a key Kremlin demand.

Sanctions have clearly complicated the situation for Russian exports and
for the import of technologies. However, Russia has been able to find
[numerous ways of bypassing]{.underline} or otherwise
[mitigating]{.underline} the [effects]{.underline} of many restrictions.
Russia's economically vital energy [[exports]{.underline}]{.mark} have
been [[redirected]{.mark} from the West [to]{.mark} the [Global
South]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with]{.mark} a
[[shadow]{.underline}]{.mark} [fleet of [tankers]{.mark}]{.underline}
playing a crucial role in this process.

Similarly, Russia has been able to continue accessing [military
[technologies]{.mark} and equipment by [importing]{.mark} [via]{.mark}
third party countries including [China]{.mark}.]{.underline} This has
created some inconvenience and led to rising costs, but it has prevented
sanctions from achieving the desired goal of isolating the Russian
economy and depriving Putin's war machine of essential components.

A number of additional factors have further blunted the impact of
sanctions. These include slow implementation and the continued existence
of multiple [[loopholes]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Restrictions]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} [capital transfers]{.mark} have also played into the
Kremlin's hands, [keeping]{.mark} [wealth]{.mark} [within]{.mark}
Russia.]{.underline}

Many Russians have clearly benefited financially from the war.
[[Military]{.mark} [contracts]{.mark} have proved particularly
[lucrative]{.mark} for the country's business elite]{.underline}, [while
the [departure]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [Western]{.mark} [companies]{.mark}
has [created]{.mark} [vacant niches]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[Russian]{.mark} [companies]{.mark} to fill.]{.underline}

[[Ordinary]{.mark} Russian [citizens]{.mark} have been able to
[earn]{.mark}]{.underline} unprecedented [sums of [money]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} enlisting in the [military]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the
[families]{.underline} [of]{.underline} soldiers
[[killed]{.underline}]{.mark} or wounded in Ukraine [receiving
substantial payments]{.underline}. [Those working in factories servicing
the war effort have also seen [salaries]{.mark} [increase]{.mark} as
much as five times amid surging demand and labor scarcity.]{.underline}
Overall, the invasion of Ukraine has [enabled [millions]{.mark} of
Russians to pull themselves [out of poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The economic benefits enjoyed by a wide range of social groups in Russia
as a result of the war have [helped foster pro-war sentiment and bolster
support for the Putin regime]{.underline}. Ending the invasion of
Ukraine would therefore potentially weaken the position of the
authorities and fuel instability. This creates further incentives to
continue the war.

The current state of the [Russian economy is far from critical
but]{.underline} it does present Putin with a dilemma. He currently
appears intent on continuing the war indefinitely while hoping to
outlast the West and exhaust Ukraine. Alternatively, he could seek to
move toward a settlement of some kind. However, there is a very real
[danger]{.underline} that either option could end up plunging Russia
into a [serious economic crisis]{.underline}.

If Putin opts to maintain his uncompromising push for an historic
victory in Ukraine, it is not clear that Russia has the resources to
wage a prolonged war on the present scale. In this scenario, current
[[warning signs]{.mark} such as rising inflation]{.underline} and labor
shortages could eventually become major problems. If he seeks a
settlement and withdraws the Keynesian crutch of today's vastly inflated
military spending, the [economic repercussions [could be
dire]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Russian economy is not yet close to
collapse, but it is increasingly dependent on wartime conditions and
faces growing risks of overheating.

#### Permafrost melt breaks oil infrastructure, causing massive losses to the Russian economy. 

Cassandra Brown, March 29, 2025, \"Melting Permafrost in Siberia is
Threatening Russia's Energy Industry\", International Relations Review,
<https://www.irreview.org/articles/2025/3/29/melting-permafrost-in-siberia-is-threatening-russias-energy-industry>
(Brown - International Relations at Boston University) II Norah

[[Two-thirds of Russia]{.mark} rests [on]{.mark}
[permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}, namely in the northern province of
Siberia. However, as climate change causes global temperatures to rise,
permafrost thaws, releasing stored greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon
dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Methane, in particular, is more
potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere, resulting
in higher ground temperatures. The release of GHGs exacerbates global
warming, which furthers [permafrost thawing---creating a dangerous
[positive feedback loop]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [[Russia]{.mark} is
[warming 2.5 times faster]{.mark} [than]{.mark} the [rest of]{.mark} the
[world]{.mark}, contributing to devastating climate disasters in the
region.]{.underline}

Siberia, whose infrastructure is built on the now-thawing permafrost, is
experiencing the consequences of this process. [As layers of ice
[melt]{.mark}, large underground puddles form, [creating]{.mark}
[sinkholes]{.mark} and instability [for]{.mark} any infrastructure built
above]{.underline}. The [buckling ground leads to damaged roads, slumped
telephone poles, and even [collapsed
buildings]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Furthermore, Russia has built
[much of its energy infrastructure atop permafrost. Nearly [70%]{.mark}
of said [infrastructure]{.mark} in Russia's Arctic region is [at
risk]{.mark}, including [major oil]{.mark} and [gas]{.mark}
[fields]{.mark}, [pipelines]{.mark}, and [mines]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Unlike other countries with varying terrains and seasons, [the frozen
ground has offered a stable base to support heavy industries such as
storage tanks, pipelines, and drilling rigs for exporting Russian
natural gas and oil. As temperatures rise, the [once-predictable terrain
melts unevenly]{.mark}, portending serious consequences for the
infrastructure]{.underline}. As the ground rapidly adapts to the warming
climates, Siberia's pipes are experiencing bending, warping, and
ruptures. The potential effects of a rupture are devastating: [even a
[slight crack in]{.mark} these crude [oil]{.mark} or natural gas
[pipelines]{.mark} can [cause]{.mark} leaks or
[explosions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In May 2020, this worst-case scenario occurred when a [fuel tank at a
[Nornickel power]{.mark} plant]{.underline} in Norilsk
[[collapsed]{.mark} [due to]{.mark} the instability of the [thawing
ground]{.mark}]{.underline}. The collapse resulted in [over 21,000 tons
of oil being released]{.underline} into the Ambarnaya River, turning it
bright red and contaminating the surrounding area. Clean-up efforts in
Norilsk cost almost 150 billion rubles (nearly 2 billion USD) to remove
contaminated soil and waterways and compensate for the damage caused to
the vulnerable Arctic ecosystem. This was one of the worst environmental
disasters in the Arctic in over 30 years. For example, the environmental
nonprofit organization Greenpeace compared it to the 1989 Exxon Valdez
disaster in Alaska. Siberia's warming climate and thawing permafrost
increase the risk of further disasters threatening Arctic wildlife and
ecosystems.

The rapid thawing of permafrost places a strain on both the environment
and Russia's economy. In 2019, Russia's minister for Arctic development
predicted, "[The [economic loss is]{.mark} 50 billion to 150 billion
rubles [(\$2.3 billion]{.mark}) [a year]{.mark}]{.underline}." Much of
the [cost]{.underline} of climate change would also [fall on the oil and
gas [companies]{.mark} [tasked]{.mark} [with]{.mark} reinforcing
existing pipelines and storage facilities]{.underline}. However, in some
cases, the environmental changes call for [a complete relocation or
infrastructure [rebuilding]{.mark}, which is time-consuming and
expensive for major fuel companies such as Gazprom, Rosneft, and
Transneft.]{.underline} Relocating most infrastructure to previously
undeveloped land would further damage the environment. The instability
of the fuel industry poses a threat to the Russian economy, where
[[fossil fuel revenue]{.mark} [makes up]{.mark} around [20% of]{.mark}
the [nation's GDP]{.mark} and relies on the Siberian and Arctic natural
reserves]{.underline}. These added [costs come at a time when [Russia
already spends]{.mark} [heavily]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the third year of
its war in [Ukraine.]{.mark} Meanwhile, strict [sanctions]{.mark} from
the European Union, the United States, and their Western allies
[have]{.mark} [reduced]{.mark} [Russia's]{.mark} [influence in]{.mark}
the [global energy markets]{.mark}]{.underline}. The combination of
climate change adaptation, the cost of infrastructure failures, a
reduction in energy exports, and the cost of war threatens to accelerate
the Kremlin's financial and geopolitical decline.

Pathway 3: [Domestic Instability in Russia Sparks
Aggression]{.underline}

[[A **dramatic increase in**]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic,
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and political [[**instability** in
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[could lead the Kremlin
to]{.underline}]{.mark} decide to **[[attack NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
member states. Crucially, [Russian leaders see]{.underline}
antigovernment [protests as a]{.underline} key element of a potential
[**Western-backed campaign** to overthrow their regime]{.underline}.
According to Russian strategists, [several other components of such a
campaign are taking place]{.underline}: instability on Russia's
periphery, a buildup of U.S. forces near Russian borders, and Western
economic warfare (Podberezkin, 2015, p. 303). Eventually, these
strategists say, this campaign would culminate in direct kinetic strikes
on the homeland. Therefore, [[Moscow is]{.mark} more [likely to see
**large**]{.mark}-scale **[protests]{.mark}** that begin in the current
environment [as]{.mark} **evidence** of [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
coordinated [[Western campaign to **topple the**]{.underline}]{.mark}
Russian **[[government]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Against this backdrop,
officials from the United States or other NATO governments speaking
openly about the possible "physical elimination" of President Putin, as
one NATO foreign minister put it ("Luxembourg Foreign Minister Calls ...
," 2022), or highlighting the prospect that [[domestic
unrest]{.underline}]{.mark} would depose the current regime, [[could
**heighten**]{.underline}]{.mark} the Russian leadership's
[[perceptions]{.mark} that]{.underline} popular [[discontent is **driven
by U.S.**]{.underline}]{.mark} or allied [intelligence
**[operations]{.mark}** and therefore constitutes **a**]{.underline}
non-kinetic **[attack on the homeland]{.underline}**. The Kremlin would
likely conflate the security of the regime and the security of the
country.

To plausibly affect the Kremlin's calculus about horizontal escalation,
[instability would have to **grow significantly**]{.underline} in size
and scope [beyond the]{.underline} relatively [small antiwar protests
that took place]{.underline} during the first weeks of the war in major
cities. However, as opposed to the war itself, the **[[dramatic economic
contraction]{.underline}]{.mark}** that has resulted from the war
**[[might]{.underline}]{.mark}** well be the
**[[spark]{.underline}]{.mark}** for such [**[broader]{.mark}** popular
**[unrest]{.mark}** once economic pain is felt]{.underline} over the
medium to long term. [The protests would]{.underline} likely [need to
reach the point where they threaten to exceed the Russian government's
ability to control them]{.underline} before Moscow would contemplate
taking actions abroad.

Because the Russian government would likely view protests of this scale
as a non-kinetic NATO attack, [[it might]{.mark} decide to **[strike
NATO]{.mark}** allies [to **compel** a **cessation
of**]{.mark}]{.underline} external [**[support]{.mark}** for the
domestic threat. Russian responses are]{.underline} more [likely to
begin with]{.underline} non-kinetic attacks (e.g.,
**[cyberattacks]{.underline}** [against]{.underline} critical
infrastructure targets such as power [grids]{.underline}, [power
plants]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} key information or
telecommunications systems, including [satellites]{.underline}) in an
effort [to **dissuade**]{.underline} future [perceived **NATO
aggression**]{.underline} at minimal cost. If these attacks are
successful in substantially disrupting U.S. or allied economic and
political life, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates or other
allies [might]{.underline} feel compelled to [**respond in kind** by
disrupting similar systems]{.underline} within Russia. [[Such
attacks]{.mark}, which would **compound**]{.underline} existing
[stresses from the war, [could]{.mark} lead Russian]{.underline}
leadership to conclude that it has exhausted non-kinetic options for
reducing NATO threats to regime survival and therefore decide [to
[turn]{.mark} to **[kinetic]{.mark} attacks**]{.underline}.

Potential Russian Moves

[Russia could]{.underline} potentially [escalate in several different
ways]{.underline}. First, Russia might shift its objectives to reduce
the impact of sanctions. Because of the Soviet legacy, prior to 2014,
Russia sourced vital military equipment including aircraft engines,
transport aircraft, air-to-air missiles, electronics, and components of
inter-continental ballistic missiles from Ukraine. The Russian military
has painstakingly sought to mitigate the resulting engine and aircraft
shortages resulting from its 2014 annexation of Crimea by purchasing
some items from other sources, but Western sanctions will hamper
remaining imports from the West. [Seizing Ukrainian defense factories
could become a priority]{.underline}. While perhaps less likely if the
target were a NATO member, [[Russia could]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[**expand the war beyond Ukraine** if]{.mark} it thought [doing so
might provide]{.mark} control of [areas that would]{.mark} help
**[alleviate]{.mark}** the **[economic pressure]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Second, Russia could also try to give the West a taste of its own
medicine. Ukraine is a major food exporter and a plant in Odessa
purifies 60 percent of the world's supply of neon, which is used in
microchip production. Russian forces could target these economic
objectives.

Third, [[a **desperate Russia** might]{.mark} risk
**[strik]{.mark}**]{.underline}ing [**[Western]{.mark} military
[aid]{.mark}** before or after it crosses the Ukrainian
border]{.underline}. As Aaron Stein notes, a potential for accidental
clashes will grow as flows of military aid increase across the
Ukrainian-Polish border. [Russia has already threatened that it would
target aid convoys carrying weapons and ammunition]{.underline} for
Ukrainian forces once they enter Ukraine. [The region's [**congested
airspace** furthers the risk of]{.mark} [**inadvertent NATO-Russia
engagements**. If Russia faces a]{.mark}]{.underline} sanctions-driven
**[[closing window for]{.underline}]{.mark}** military [[**success**,
Putin might]{.underline}]{.mark} deliberately choose to [**take more
risks** to [**intercept convoys** or]{.mark}]{.underline} even [attempt
to **[push back]{.mark}** supporting [NATO forces]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Finally, even **[nuclear escalation could be possible]{.underline}**.
[[Russia has]{.mark} already [increased the alert status of its]{.mark}
nuclear [forces]{.mark}. Its]{.underline} 2020 nuclear
**[doctrine]{.underline}** specifically [states Russia would consider
**first use**]{.underline} of nuclear weapons [in situations where
"conventional aggression" threatens "the very existence of the
state."]{.underline} Putin has declared the sanctions "akin to a
declaration of war." [No nuclear armed power has ever faced the
possibility of **regime collapse** due to **economic
pressure**]{.underline}. It is conceivable that the
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** regime **[[might consider nuclear use
if economic pressure were significant enough to threaten its
existence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Past recessions and wars don't thump. Putin and current geopolitical tensions make now uniquely worse.

Institute, a think tank focused on existential risk. Research Affiliate

Finally, there is information about specific events that may provide a
guide. For example, in the [[ongoing]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russian
[invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, an important parameter is
Vladimir [[Putin\'s mental state]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[more]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[likely]{.underline}]{.mark} [if]{.mark} [[he]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
angry, temperamental, [humiliated]{.mark}, or even
suicidal]{.underline}. [Other factors include]{.underline} whether
Ukraine succeeds in fighting off the Russian military, whether
[[Nato]{.underline}]{.mark} gets [more]{.mark} involved in direct
military operations, and whether any major false alarms occur. These
sorts of details -- to the extent that we are able to learn about them
-- are valuable for informing our understanding of the [[probability
of]{.underline}]{.mark} this particular event resulting in
[[nuclear]{.mark} [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

All of the above pertains to the probability of nuclear war. To evaluate
risk, we also need the severity. This has two parts. First are the
details of the war itself. How many nuclear weapons are detonated? With
what explosive yield? At which locations and altitudes? What other,
non-nuclear attacks also occurred during the conduct of the war? These
details determine the initial harm. The second part is what happens
next. Are survivors able to maintain basic needs -- food, clothing,
shelter? How severe are secondary effects such as nuclear winter? Given
all the various stressors, are survivors able to maintain any semblance
of modern civilisation, or does civilisation collapse? If collapse does
happen, do survivors or their descendants ever rebuild it? These factors
determine the total, long-term harm caused by the nuclear war.

Any nuclear war, however \"small\", would be catastrophic for the
affected areas. However, what makes nuclear weapons so worrisome is not
the damage that can be caused by a single explosion. That can be large
in its own right, but it\'s still comparable to the damage that can be
caused by conventional, non-nuclear explosives. WW2 is illustrative: of
the roughly 75 million people who died in this conflict, only around
200,000 were killed by nuclear weapons. Comparable amounts of
destruction were caused by the carpet bombing of cities such as Berlin,
Hamburg, and Dresden. Nuclear weapons are terrible, but so are
conventional weapons used in sufficient quantity.

What makes nuclear weapons so worrisome is that they make it so easy to
cause so much devastation. [With a [single launch order]{.mark},
[a]{.mark} [country]{.mark} [can]{.mark} cause [many times]{.mark}
[more]{.mark} [harm]{.mark} [than]{.mark} occurred in all of
[WW2]{.mark}, and they can do it [without]{.mark} [sending]{.mark} a
single [soldier overseas]{.mark}, by instead delivering nuclear warheads
with intercontinental ballistic missiles. Mass [destruction]{.mark} has
long been possible, but it [has]{.mark} [never been so
easy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Why now?

In the last decade, [US Arctic policy]{.mark} has increasingly
emphasized confrontation with strategic rivals in lieu of cooperation.
The most visible aspect of this shift has been the significant expansion
of US military deployments in the region, [which is itself [predicated
on]{.mark} the [false assumption]{.mark} [that]{.mark} the primary
[reason]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[Russia]{.mark}n armed forces have
[expanded]{.mark} their [north]{.mark}ern footprint [is]{.mark} [to
claim]{.mark} newly accessible [northern territory,]{.mark} [not]{.mark}
to [protect]{.mark} the vast [resource wealth]{.mark} that lies within
Russian territory and keeps Vladimir Putin's regime in
power.]{.underline} However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine precipitated a
sharp [regression of international environmental collaboration and
scientific exchange]{.underline} that is vital to the health and
stability of the Arctic and the rest of the world. The decision to cut
off such dialogue was understandable, given the cruelty of the Russian
war, but it [was]{.underline} [short-sighted]{.underline} in that it
impedes a candid assessment of how to best safeguard US and allied
interests.

In response to Russia's assault on Ukraine, the United States and its
regional partners have boycotted the Arctic Council, an organization at
the forefront of Arctic climate protection and research. Moreover, with
limited exceptions, international scientific collaboration with Russian
researchers has ground to a halt, with hundreds of projects paused or
canceled outright. Experts undertaking pressing international
initiatives, such as studies on permafrost thawing, cannot obtain
irreplaceable data from Russian sources, and Western scientists derive
no benefit from Russia's cadre of climate experts and Arctic resources

This shift comes at a critical moment for US Arctic territory. Alaska is
warming more than twice as quickly as the rest of the United States and
is experiencing the fastest glacier loss on the planet. Models predict
that the size of Alaskan wildfires will double by 2050 and triple by
2100. Rising sea levels and receding ice floes are threatening
traditional food supplies for Inuit communities, and corresponding
coastal erosion has forced entire towns to relocate. Furthermore,
[permafrost thaw is]{.mark} [expected to "add]{.mark} as much as \$6
billion to the [costs of]{.mark} buildings, pipelines, roads, and other
infrastructure over the next 20 years."

[US [policymakers]{.mark} [should]{.mark} [not]{.mark} [allow]{.mark}
Russia's [invasion]{.mark} [of Ukraine]{.mark}, abhorrent as it is,
[to]{.mark} [impede climate]{.mark} [cooperation]{.mark} [at]{.mark}
such a [critical moment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The costs of climate change will be even steeper for Russia. The country
is projected to warm 2.5 times faster than the global average. In 2021,
wildfires burned 45 million acres in Russia, an area slightly smaller
than the country of Syria. Contrary to statements by Putin, the warming
climate will also [reduce [Russia's]{.mark} [agricultural]{.mark}
potential]{.underline}. Moreover, melting permafrost will wreak havoc on
Russia's northerly settlements and infrastructure. According to the
Arctic Institute, "By 2050, it is estimated that [20 percent of
[commercial]{.mark} and [industrial]{.mark} structures and 19 percent of
critical infrastructure representing \$84.4 billion, [and]{.mark} 54
percent of [residential]{.mark} [buildings]{.mark} [with a total cost of
\$20.7 billion]{.mark} in Russia [will be]{.mark} [negatively impacted
by permafrost]{.mark} [degradation]{.mark}."]{.underline} Russian
government auditors predict that, by the end of the decade, mitigating
the effects of climate change will cost 2-3 percent of the country's
GDP. The auditors argue that "without solving its myriad environmental
and ecological problems, Russia will fall short of its ambitious targets
to increase life expectancy, improve demographics and boost the
economy."

Warming temperatures in the Arctic could also kickstart a phenomenon
that will exponentially increase the rate of climate change. Not only
will the thawing permafrost damage buildings and infrastructure, but it
will release vast quantities of carbon dioxide and methane as the Arctic
warms. Even with low levels of warming, permafrost thaw could release
emissions equivalent to those of a medium-sized country. The Arctic
permafrost contains 1.5 trillion tons of organic carbon, but researchers
are unsure at what rate these gasses will be released, or how different
levels of thawing will affect different regions. Russian data and
expertise are needed to accurately judge permafrost thaw and evaluate
differences between regions. According to one US permafrost scientist,
"[If you cut off your view of changing permafrost in Russia, you're
really cutting off our understanding of global changes to
permafrost."]{.underline}

Another profound concern is the potential for hydrocarbon and
radiological disasters. Each year, western Siberia's oil and gas
pipelines experience 35,000 disruptive incidents, of which about 20
percent are linked to permafrost degradation. In 2020, thawing
permafrost in Norilsk caused a fuel leak, which led to a major
environmental crisis. Furthermore, the [structural [stability of]{.mark}
several [nuclear power plants]{.mark}]{.underline} and
radioactive-waste-storage facilities in the Russian Arctic is also
[threatened by]{.mark} [permafrost loss.]{.mark} The Kara Sea is home to
more [nuclear waste]{.underline} than any other ocean on earth because
the Soviet Union dumped nuclear reactors and spent uranium fuel in the
area. Although the Kremlin plans [to recover]{.mark} some [nuclear
materials]{.mark} from the Arctic, the [[Russians]{.mark} [will
be]{.mark} [unable to do so alone.]{.mark}]{.underline} An incident like
Norilsk at one of these radiological sites could have catastrophic
consequences for countries worldwide.

Policymakers in Washington and Moscow have placed increased emphasis on
the dangers of climate change and are beginning to act accordingly. The
Biden administration has rejoined the Paris Agreement and set ambitious
targets for emissions reduction and climate change mitigation. Moreover,
[Russia]{.mark} has [announced]{.mark} limited [emissions
reductions]{.mark} [and]{.mark} has [[expressed]{.mark} its
[willingness]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [work]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates on climate issues.]{.underline} It had
planned to host an Arctic Council conference on nuclear waste disposal
in June 2022, which has since been canceled, and its Arctic diplomats
have lamented the lapse in Arctic cooperation. Nevertheless, further
cooperation on the Arctic will be necessary if some of the worst effects
of climate change are to be avoided---a breakdown in the relationship
could badly damage US and Russian interests while further imperiling the
rest of the world. US policymakers should not allow Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, abhorrent as it is, to impede climate cooperation at such a
critical moment.

MOSCOW, March 27 (Reuters) - [Geopolitical rivalries are
intensifying]{.underline} in the Arctic [but **[Russia]{.mark} is
[willing to cooperate]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} foreign
partners]{.underline}, [including from the [West**, in**]{.mark}
**[economic ventures]{.mark} there [that]{.mark} will [benefit]{.mark}
[all sides]{.mark},**]{.underline} [Russian President Vladimir **[Putin
said]{.mark}**]{.underline} on Thursday. In a major speech, [Putin said
U.S. President Donald Trump\'s stated intention to acquire Greenland was
\"serious]{.underline}\", and it was clear that the [U.S. would continue
to promote its interests in the Arctic.]{.underline} [The Greenland
question had nothing to do with Russia, he said.]{.underline} But Moscow
was concerned that \"[NATO countries]{.underline} in general are
increasingly designating the far north as a springboard for possible
conflicts, [practising the use of troops]{.underline} in these
conditions, including by their \'new recruits\', [Finland and
Sweden]{.underline},\" he said, referring to the alliance\'s latest
members. [Russia]{.underline} was monitoring the situation and [building
a response]{.underline}, including by [boosting its military
capabilities in the region]{.underline}. \"[We will not allow
encroachments]{.underline} [on the sovereignty of our
country]{.underline} and will reliably protect our national interests,\"
Putin said. Focus on the Arctic\'s strategic importance for mining,
shipping and security has increased sharply because of repeated
statements by Trump that he wants to acquire Greenland. He has not ruled
out doing so by force. [The Arctic holds fossil fuels and minerals
beneath the land and the seabed]{.underline} that could become more
accessible with global warming. It is also an area of military
competition, where defence analysts say Russia has built up its presence
much faster than the West by reopening Soviet-era bases and modernising
its navy. The United States sees the Arctic as crucial for natural
security, including for its early warning system against nuclear
attacks. [The **[Kremlin says]{.mark}** the Arctic is a zone of Russian
strategic interest,]{.underline} and [suggested]{.underline} in February
[that **[Russia and]{.mark} the [U.S. could work together to develop
natural resources]{.mark}** there]{.underline} [[as the two]{.mark}
countries [pursue]{.mark} a fast-moving [rapprochement]{.mark} that has
unnerved Ukraine and its European allies.]{.underline} NORTHERN SEA
ROUTE On the economic front, Putin has made it a top priority to ramp up
commerce via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) through Arctic waters as
Russia shifts trade towards Asia and away from Europe because of Western
sanctions. [Oil shipments from Russian]{.underline} ports to China [via
the NSR rose by a quarter last year.]{.underline} [**[Foreign
partners]{.mark}** **[prepared to cooperate with Russia]{.mark} [on
investment projects]{.mark}** in the region **[would be
guaranteed]{.mark} [a good return, Putin said]{.mark}**.]{.underline} He
called for an expansion of Russia\'s northern ports and the building of
a merchant fleet in the Arctic, supported by new-generation icebreakers
including nuclear-powered ones. But he said **[[Russia\'s domestic
capabilities were insufficient]{.underline}]{.mark}** for this at the
moment, and that it would also require buying vessels and interacting
with foreign shipbuilders. Russia was already successfully shipping oil
and liquefied natural gas via the NSR, he said. \"Now [we need to create
conditions for the growth of effective domestic operators]{.underline}
that will engage in transporting containers of coal, bulk and other
cargo through the Arctic[**. [We are]{.mark}** also **[open]{.mark}**
here **[to]{.mark}** the creation of **[joint
ventures]{.mark},\"**]{.underline} he added. International logistics
firms could supply capital, technology and merchant ships to support
this, he said. Putin delivered his speech to a conference on the Arctic
in Murmansk, a port from which the NSR runs eastward across the top of
Russia to the Bering Strait near Alaska. He said Murmansk\'s port
capacity should be at least trebled in the coming years, with
construction of new terminals and railway links, and \"partners\" from
Belarus, China, the United Arab Emirates and other countries were
showing interest in this project.

MARTIN: So let\'s talk about Russia\'s President Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}. He\'s not unlike a lot of world leaders in the sense
that he used to dismiss climate change. He said that he [once
[said]{.mark} that [climate change]{.mark} simply [means]{.mark} that
[Russians]{.mark} will [spend]{.mark} [less]{.mark} [on]{.mark} fur
[coats]{.mark}]{.underline}. Has he changed his tune? And how does this
factor into his vision for the country now?

YAFFA: You very much have seen Putin and other top Russian officials
speak with real clarity and alarm about the risk from climate change,
both for Russia\'s own national interest as well as globally. Last year,
[Russia\'s]{.mark} environmental [minister]{.mark} [[proposed]{.mark} a
[nationwide system]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [monitor]{.mark} changes in the
[permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline} due to climate change, [noting
that]{.mark} [permafrost thaw]{.mark} [could]{.mark} [cause]{.mark} more
than [\$60 billion]{.mark} worth [of infrastructure damage.]{.mark}
[That]{.mark} certainly, I think, [made]{.mark} a lot of [Russian
officials]{.mark}, including Putin himself, [sit up straight.]{.mark}

Russia, while it has [[pledged to limit its
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}, it\'s essentially doing that through a
kind of accounting trick and saying that it will [limit its emissions to
a level dating back [to]{.mark} the [early \'90s]{.mark}, [when,]{.mark}
as part of the legacy of a project of Soviet heavy industry, [it]{.mark}
[was]{.mark} producing and [polluting quite a lot]{.mark}]{.underline}.
So it\'s [essentially [picked the most convenient baseline]{.mark} to
say it will now produce less than. In fact, that [baseline]{.mark}
i[s]{.mark} [so large]{.mark} it would [allow]{.mark} [Russia to]{.mark}
[emit]{.mark} even [more]{.mark} [than it does today]{.mark}. So on the
level of rhetoric, you\'ve seen a shift, but I\'m not sure you\'ve
really seen much of a shift on action.]{.underline}

In June 2022, [the White House said it would "[wind
down"]{.mark}]{.underline} [[scientific]{.underline}]{.mark} and
technological [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} [with
Russia]{.underline}. The [[National]{.mark} [Science]{.mark}

projects with [[Russian]{.mark} [collaboration]{.mark},]{.underline}
including studies on the Arctic Ocean,
[[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}, melting sea ice, marine
transportation, infrastructure development, Arctic wildfires and
[climate resilience in Arctic communities.]{.underline}

Some U.S. [universities followed suit,]{.underline} and the European
Union limited cooperation with Russian institutes. That [[left a
hole]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [climate monitoring system]{.mark}s like the
[INTERACT]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} [network]{.mark}, which has
[paused]{.mark} about half of its [research]{.mark} [stations]{.mark}

**Other agents hinder data standardization\-\-- that's key to turn data
into infrastructure solutions**

[Data hold significant importance in the domains of both scientific
research]{.underline} and applied decision making. The [process of
gathering, [curating]{.mark}, and making a [dataset]{.mark}]{.underline}
available often [[involves]{.mark} [substantial]{.mark}
time]{.underline}, funding, and resources on the part of research teams
or [[collaborators]{.mark},]{.underline} making that data an asset
(which carries with it implications for data access and sharing). [The
level of quality of a dataset influences not only the ability to derive
useful scientific knowledge, but also a [level of trust and reliability
in]{.mark} the underlying [info]{.mark}rmation that it
contains]{.underline}, and therefore in the ability [to]{.mark}
[[develop]{.mark} [plans]{.mark} or decisions [based]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
that [data]{.mark}]{.underline} \[46\]. However, the quality of a
dataset alone is not sufficient for its use in large-scale decision
making. For it to have broader utility to the research community, it is
important that the data conform to field standards and that they are
made available to interested groups---all of which remain a work in
progress as Sjoberg et al. acknowledge:

[Research]{.underline} in northern Europe, Russia and the [[USA]{.mark}
is relatively [well integrated]{.mark}]{.underline}, while
[Canadian]{.mark} [research]{.mark} is more [dispersed]{.mark} and
either focused on the Eastern Arctic or Western Arctic, and similarly,
China is relatively isolated but with some ties to US institutions...
Our survey respondents mentioned the [importance of International
Permafrost Association permafrost conference proceedings as sources of
inspiration, especially the earlier ones (Supporting Information). More
recent international collaboration efforts include developments of
databases, such as the databases for permafrost region soil carbon,
ponds and the thermal state of permafrost \[47\].]{.underline}

The [[standardization of data]{.underline}]{.mark} involves tasks like
the conversion into commonly available formats for ease of use,
[conformity to units of measure, proper geospatial references for the
region]{.underline} (where applicable), and additional information such
as metadata that helps describe the dataset, its features, and
additional information that may be relevant for its use and
understanding[. Common formats [allow]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
[greater]{.mark} [use in industry]{.mark} or field standard analysis
programs and toolsets, making the [barrier to entry]{.mark}
[lower]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [working]{.mark} [with]{.mark} that
[dataset]{.mark}, and this increases the likelihood that it may be
explored by groups outside of the initial research team---a form of open
science that has been described as an exemplar of the
democratic]{.underline} school---open access to data and publications
\[48\]. Metadata also play a significant role in that wider adoption as
well, as they convey vital information about the collection, utility,
and even limits that can be applied to certain datasets. However,
metadata are often limited in completeness, making it difficult for end
users to understand the nuance required for performing subsequent
research, or for searching and identifying relevant datasets \[49\].
While standards for metadata exist in geospatial data, large portions of
those fields remain optional and are subject to the time and resources
of data producers \[50\]. Implications involving a shortage of
permafrost data sharing indicate broader, holistic problems also, stated
by O'Neill et al. (2019):

"[Northern communities and [stakeholders]{.mark} [require expert
knowledge]{.mark} and predictive models to support adaptation
strategies. Such predictions are useful only if the representation of
landscape-scale processes is accurate.]{.underline} Invoking simplifying
assumptions to operate global-scale simulations can generate predictions
that may be misleading."

#### Clarity Key for Russian follow on, only the NSF framework has been proven to solve 

Troy J. Bouffard et al, 6-2-2021, \"Scientific Cooperation: Supporting
Circumpolar Permafrost Monitoring and Data Sharing\", MDPI,
<https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/6/590> (Bouffard - Dr. Troy J.

Management) II Norah

Another major hurdle to widespread adoption of scientific data is often
[less about the data than it is about the ease of accessing that
data.]{.underline} Availability concerns in this case include those
related to people, technological and policy. In the past, [many
[researchers]{.mark} have [shown]{.mark} a [hesitancy]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} openly [share]{.mark} [data]{.mark} [when]{.mark} there is a
[perceived loss]{.mark} of value [through]{.mark} sharing, concerns over
[misuse of data]{.mark}, and [potential]{.mark} [competition]{.mark}
when the data are made more broadly accessible]{.underline}.
[[When]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[value]{.mark} [gained]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} [data sharing]{.mark} from [collaboration]{.mark} or
new research opportunities [is made clear]{.mark}]{.underline},
[however]{.mark}, [[most are open]{.mark} to the idea]{.underline} so
long as the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Additionally, [recent
[surveys]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[indicated]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[when]{.mark} [proper assurances]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [credit]{.mark}
are [made]{.mark} for datasets, organizational [support]{.mark} is
increased]{.underline}, and [that financial support is given,
data-sharing interests further improve]{.underline} \[51,52\].
[Coordination with related climate observation]{.underline} sites to
collocate select boreholes with weather stations could help improve
monitoring or surface and subsurface conditions, to improve
understanding of microclimate conditions, and [provide a [more]{.mark}
[comprehensive]{.mark} assessment [of]{.mark} [permafrost]{.mark}
[responses]{.mark} to climate change]{.underline} and by extent may
empower the individual researchers and amplify the findings. On the
technology side, scientific datasets have continued to grow in size as
the ability to gather data at high resolution has rapidly increased.
Low-cost sensors, an increasing number of open-access satellite systems,
and the computational resources to generate massive datasets have fueled
this growth, but computational power, storage resources, and network
technologies have been unable to keep pace with the increase in data
volume \[53\]. [Making data available broadly, and freely to end users,
requires continuing financial resources to support the assets needed to
serve and distribute that data effectively over long distances,
including storage infrastructure, network services, and staffing to
support and maintain these systems]{.underline}. One of the few studies
on long-term availability of research data indicates that datasets used
in research may become unavailable at a rate of up to seventeen percent
per year after publications are completed, indicating broader issues in
the maintenance of long-term research data \[54\]. [This permanent
[loss]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [data]{.mark} [results]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
[gaps]{.mark} in long-term analysis in some fields]{.underline}, and
costly reproduction of research in others. [[Efforts]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} [NSF]{.mark} and similar funding organizations hope to
change this,]{.underline} but this would require broader adoption in the
research and data relevant communities, similar to current efforts
[demonstrated by the NSF-[funded]{.mark} [Arctic Data Center]{.mark}
\[55]{.underline}\].

Beyond technology and infrastructure, there also has to be a
[[willingness]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [share]{.mark} that [data]{.mark}
[openly]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [behalf]{.mark} [of]{.mark} data owners and
[governments]{.mark}.]{.underline} The value of a dataset can go beyond
its value to researchers, including strategic value from business or
national perspectives. When it comes to permafrost data, large amounts
of borehole data are gathered by private organizations and used for
site-based risk or engineering design purposes. Without proper
incentives to share this data, it may be seen either as proprietary, or
an unnecessary financial burden. In other [sectors, data gathered by
government [agencies]{.mark} [may]{.mark} even [be]{.mark}
[viewed]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a national [security concern]{.mark} if it
relates to controlled sites, and/or offering insights to foreign
competitors.]{.underline} While some [grant-awarding agencies now
mandate long term, such as the [N]{.mark}ational [S]{.mark}cience
[F]{.mark}oundation in the US or the Natural Environment Research
Council (NERC)]{.underline} in the UK, many agencies in countries such
as Russia and China have no such mandate, leaving it up to the research
team to decide \[56\]. A data-sharing mandate alone is not always
sufficient without additional resources and tools being provided to
researchers \[57\]. [When [strictly]{.mark} enforced and
[supported]{.mark}, though, [data-sharing efforts]{.mark} can [lead
to]{.mark} not only [higher]{.mark} [data retention]{.mark} rates, but
also increases in citations for authors and related journals \[58\].
NERC takes this one step further, and not only mandates data sharing,
but provides this as a service to funded projects, outside of award
funds, but [few options]{.mark} [like]{.mark} [this]{.mark}
[exist]{.mark} on international scales, and are largely limited to
specific projects \[59\].]{.underline}

Despite these challenges, prior efforts in data-sharing networks in
fields such as oceanography, seismology and ecology have successfully
[highlighted the importance of multilateral data [sharing]{.mark}, and
what [proved]{.mark} [possible]{.mark} [during]{.mark} the [Cold
War]{.mark} era for example \[60\].]{.underline}

The [[Russian economy]{.mark} has [**adapted** to]{.mark} Western
[sanctions and **inflation is**]{.mark} **now
[slowing]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} but turbulent times and
[major]{.underline} technological [shifts lie ahead]{.underline},
central bank governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Wednesday.

Despite the sanctions, [the Russian [economy grew]{.mark} by 4.3% last
year [but is set to slow]{.mark}]{.underline} sharply in 2025, with many
officials and economists saying that the current model has exhausted its
growth potential.

\"We have adapted to some external challenges (but) no, [we are
[facing]{.mark}]{.underline} very [[**turbulent times**
ahead]{.underline}]{.mark},\" said Nabiullina, who is widely credited
with steering the Russian economy through the Ukraine military conflict
and resulting sanctions.

[\"**[But I am confident]{.mark}** that [this]{.mark} also [presents
**new opportunities** for development]{.mark}]{.underline} and for
increasing labour productivity in conditions of expensive labour. [We
base our efforts on this,]{.underline}\" she told a banking conference.

She stressed that the high cost of labour - spurred by the military
spending that has led to a wage growth spiral in many sectors, as well
as by curbs on immigration - would remain for a long time.

Nabiullina said [the [economy should]{.mark} in future [rely]{.mark}
entirely [on domestic sources of financing]{.mark}]{.underline} as cheap
funding from abroad, abundant before the Ukraine conflict, is no longer
available.

\"In my view, [[structural adaptation]{.mark} to external constraints
**[has been completed]{.mark}**. We have [demonstrated our ability to
adapt]{.mark} to these challenges, but now we are [facing **structural
shifts**]{.mark} of an entirely new kind,]{.underline} primarily
technological ones,\" she said.

After three years of militarizing the country, [[Russia's economy is

growth is expected to slow]{.underline} this year from 4.1% to 2.5%.
More conservative forecasts, such as those of the International Monetary

that.

So far, [this has [amounted to **soft landing**]{.mark}, [rather
than]{.mark} a [crash]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [While the economy
is in orderly decline, the [war effort]{.mark} will [remain **fully
financed**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Kremlin views the
military-industrial complex as the primary driver of the economy, and
its financing is a top priority. Lower inflation would remove some of
the pressure on military expenses. Moreover, [a [drop in labor]{.mark}
demand and subsequently a slower pace of salary growth would
[allow]{.mark} the [army to attract more]{.mark} contract [soldiers for

\["Russia\'s economy is down but not out", BBC, June 23, 2025,
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqnj17vryjo\] CH

Since its illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Russia has become the
most sanctioned nation on Earth, and yet its economy has been remarkably
resilient.

[[In 2024]{.underline}]{.mark}, if [[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}
official figures are to believed, its [**[economy outgrew]{.mark}**
those of all the [G7 nations]{.mark}]{.underline} - Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US.

The Russian economy expanded by 4.3% last year, compared with 1.1% in
the UK, and 2.8% in the US.

[This growth in Russia was [led by]{.mark} the Kremlin\'s [record
military spending]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The country\'s [oil exports]{.mark}, by volume, have also [remained
**relatively stable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as supplies once destined
for Europe have been diverted to China and India.

And a \"shadow fleet\" of tankers, whose ownership and movements could
be obscured, has helped Moscow circumvent sanctions elsewhere.

Meanwhile, the Russian rouble has recovered to become the
best-performing world currency this year, with gains of more than 40%,
according to Bank of America.

[Yet, as we move towards 2026, the [mood]{.mark} music [is
changing]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Inside the [country [inflation has been persistently high]{.mark},
interest [rates]{.mark} have [soared to 20%, and]{.mark} [companies
can\'t find]{.mark} the [workers]{.mark} they need]{.underline}. And
globally, oil prices had fallen back this year before the current
conflict between Israel and Iran caused a spike.

[[Russia\'s economy minister warned]{.mark}]{.underline} on Thursday
that the [[country was \"**on the verge**\" of recession]{.mark} after a
period of \"overheating\".]{.underline}

And [[some]{.mark} Russia watchers]{.underline} have even
[[suggested]{.mark} the economy could be headed for
[**collapse**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But how likely is that really? And how does it affect the course of the
war?

Yevgeny Nadorshin, [an [economist]{.mark}]{.underline} based in Moscow,
[[tells BBC News]{.underline}]{.mark}: \"Overall[, [it will
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [a pretty [uncomfortable situation]{.mark} until
late 2026,]{.underline} and definitely [there will be defaults and
bankruptcies]{.underline}.\"

[[But he predicts]{.underline} [the **downturn will be
\"mild**]{.underline}]{.mark}[\"]{.underline} and calls any [suggestion
of a [meltdown a \"**total lie**]{.mark}\".]{.underline}

\"Without any single doubt, [the Russian economy has experienced a
number of recessions deeper]{.underline} than this.\"

#### Russian economy will endure now\-\--the Kremlin manages challenges

CH

However, at least [in the short to medium term,]{.underline} in many
ways [the [Russian economy]{.mark} has **[weathered the storm]{.mark}**
dramatically better than expected]{.underline}. [[Despite
predictions]{.mark} that the economy could collapse]{.underline} when
faced with the onslaught of sanctions, [[it has not only
endured]{.mark}, [but adapted]{.mark} to the challenge]{.underline}.
[[Growth rates **remain impressive**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and while
inflation remains a serious concern, the [technocrats running the
Russian central bank and ministry of finance]{.underline} have [remained
determined]{.underline} enough in their efforts [to keep the problem
controllable]{.underline}, at least for now. Continued Russian [[profits
from **hydrocarbon exports**]{.underline}]{.mark} allowed the Russian
state to [[postpone]{.mark} and limit the kinds of [spending
trade-offs]{.mark}]{.underline} the sanctions regime was designed to
cause.

Furthermore, the [[Kremlin]{.mark} has [effectively used]{.mark} the
context of economic [war to write a **new domestic**]{.mark} **social
[contract]{.mark}** [for Russia's political
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}---one that [[economically
strengthens]{.mark} the [regime's internal allies]{.mark} and weakens
its opponents]{.underline}. In sum, the Kremlin has used the unique
wartime economic climate to [enrich existing loyalists and build a
coalition within society that directly benefits from the war's different
revenue streams.]{.underline}

At the lower end of the economic spectrum, [the [Kremlin]{.mark} has
[made enlistment economically attractive]{.mark} through large signing
bonuses and competitive salaries, along with survivors' benefits paid to
the families of soldiers killed in battle.]{.underline} As money pours
into the country's industrial base, [[domestic defense companies]{.mark}
are able to [offer high salaries]{.mark}, particularly in Russia's
depressed regions,]{.underline} which draws workers into the state's
military procurement effort. Due to Russia's aforementioned labor
shortages, [[workers]{.mark} find themselves [in]{.mark} a uniquely
**[advantageous position]{.mark}**]{.underline}, leading to the real
wage growth described above. [Russia's working classes are now an
interest group directly benefiting from the war's
continuation.]{.underline}

A [[parallel process of enrichment]{.mark} has played out
with[in]{.mark} the [upper echelons of]{.mark} Russian
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} First, the turbocharging of
investment into defense and national security has provided [elements of
the Russian elite with lucrative defense opportunities as defense
contractors]{.underline}. Additionally, [[wealthy Russians]{.mark} who
support the state's war effort have found themselves in pole position to
[receive]{.mark} the **[spoils of Western asset
seizures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As part of its response to Western
sanctions, in particular the seizure of Russian state and private assets
by governments backing Ukraine, the Russian government has effectively
frozen Western assets stranded in Russia, as well as engineered forced
sales at massive discount to well-connected Russians willing to toe the
party line.

Just like with Russia's lower classes, [the [Kremlin has used]{.mark}
the [dramatic changes]{.mark} forced [on the]{.mark} Russian
[economy]{.mark} by the war and sanctions [to **strengthen its
power**]{.mark} base within the Russian elite]{.underline}---by
rewarding loyalty and seizing assets from anti-war business leaders
driven from the country by their refusal to kowtow politically. One
prominent example is the case of Oleg Tinkov, former owner of Tinkoff
Bank, who claims he only received 3 percent of the market value of his
bank shares after he was forced to sell off his assets after speaking
out against the full-scale invasion. With sanctions limiting the
opportunities for Russian wealth to move abroad, the Kremlin has
functionally achieved a long-held goal dating back to the 1990s---the
reshoring of Russian oligarchic wealth. [Combined with an effective
purge of Russian society's system-liberals, the war has provided the
Putin regime with the opportunity to build a new class of stakeholders
invested in the system's durability and success.]{.underline}

CH

The [[logistics routes]{.mark} have been successfully
[adapted]{.mark}]{.underline}: there has been a reorientation to the
ports of the Far East, cargo traffic through Turkey has increased 2-2.5
times, the [[Northern Sea Route]{.mark} has become [more
active]{.mark}]{.underline}, and transit through Kazakhstan has
increased by 35-40%. The energy sector has also demonstrated resilience:
exports of petroleum products in 2021 recovered to \$277,808 million,
exceeding pre-crisis levels in 2010. The diversification of economic
ties has become an important factor.: [Stable relations with the CIS
countries have been maintained, [new partnerships]{.mark} are
[developing in Asia]{.mark}, and settlements in national currencies with
friendly countries are underway]{.underline}. Thus, [**[despite the
serious challenges]{.mark}**, the [Russian economy demonstrates]{.mark}
the **[ability to adapt]{.mark}** and find new opportunities for
development in the changed conditions.]{.underline} Based on the
analysis of the economic situation in Russia by the end of 2024[, it can
be concluded that the [government\'s anti-crisis measures]{.mark} taken
in response to Western sanctions have significantly **[contributed
to]{.mark} the [stabilization]{.mark}** of the country\'s population\'s
living standards]{.underline}. An analysis of the economic situation in
the Russian Federation in the context of increased external sanctions
pressure has revealed [a set of structural imbalances that have been
forming in the national economic system for a long time]{.underline}. In
particular, there was an excessive concentration of export flows in the
raw materials sector, which indicates an insufficient diversification of
the economy and its dependence on the conjuncture of global commodity
markets. In addition, [limited geographical diversification of energy
export routes has emerged, which increases the vulnerability of the
energy sector to geopolitical risks.]{.underline} Technological
dependence on imports has also become a significant factor in economic
instability, indicating the insufficient development of domestic
high-tech industries. An additional destabilizing element is the high
level of external corporate debt, which poses risks to the financial
stability of enterprises with limited access to international capital
markets. Finally, a significant outflow of capital indicates an
insufficient attractiveness of the domestic investment environment and
may negatively affect the long-term prospects for economic growth
\[30\]. [In 2024, the Russian economy is functioning in the context of
ongoing challenges related to the sanctions regime.: - [oil **production
has stabilized**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but at a level 3-5% lower than
the pre-sanctions period; - energy exports decreased by 5-8% in value
terms due to the reorientation to new markets; - technological
limitations remain in a number of industries, including mechanical
engineering, aerospace and electronics industries; - The budget deficit
was reduced to 1.8% of GDP due to cost optimization and increased
non-resource revenues \[31\]. The Russian government continues its
policy of economic diversification, focusing on reasonable import
substitution and the development of export potential in non-resource
sectors. [[Forecasts]{.mark} of international organizations [regarding
the Russian economy]{.mark} have **[become more
optimistic]{.mark}**.]{.underline} According to IMF estimates,
[Russia\'s [GDP growth]{.mark} in 2024 [was 2.5%,]{.mark} [which
**exceeds**]{.mark} the [growth rate of]{.mark} a number of [developed
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the long-term nature of the
sanctions pressure, Russia\'s economic policy is aimed at creating a new
growth model with a greater focus on domestic demand, both investment
and consumer. Special attention is paid to supporting the manufacturing
industry, in particular, providing enterprises with working capital.
This is necessary to achieve sustainable GDP growth rates of 4-5% per
year, which will overcome the consequences of the crisis and ensure the
long-term development of the economy. In the context of ensuring
sustainable economic development of the Russian Federation, the issue of
optimizing the level of monetization of the economy is of particular
relevance. According to economic theory and international practice, the
optimal value of the monetization coefficient for the stable functioning
of the economic system is about 70%. An analysis of the dynamics of this
indicator in Russia shows an ambiguous trend: in 2020, the threshold
level of economic security (50%) was exceeded by 4.65 percentage points,
reaching 54.65%. However, in 2021, there was a decrease to 50.65%, which
is significantly lower than the global average (125%) and significantly
lower than in developed economies, where the monetization coefficient
often exceeds 150% \[32\].

[[After]{.mark} three [years of Western sanctions]{.mark} designed to
isolate it, [Russia has not only adapted but]{.mark} has [also
**emerged**]{.mark} [as the center of a]{.mark} parallel **[global
economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This poses a major challenge for the
West, as Moscow, at the heart of various strategies to circumvent
American and European measures, has gradually succeeded in constructing
a new financial architecture.

\"[The Russian Central Bank estimates that more than [80% of all
Russian]{.mark} foreign [trade agreements are]{.mark} now [**made in
rubles** or]{.mark} in the [currencies of friendly
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, mainly the Chinese yuan. But, according
to our estimates, between 60 and 70% of these actually operate with new,
[[restructured financial schemes]{.underline}]{.mark} and [are now
[**totally and permanently** beyond Western
control]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}\" said the Russian economist
Dmitri Nekrasov, who is an opponent of the Russian regime. Now exiled in
Cyprus, he is a director of the Center for Analysis and Strategies in
Europe (CASE), which he cofounded in 2024.

On Tuesday, March 4, at the Institut Français des Relations
Internationales in Paris, CASE presented a highly technical report with
chilling conclusions on the [[West\']{.mark}s [fail]{.mark}ure [to keep
track of sanctions]{.mark} against Russia]{.underline} since the launch
of the Kremlin\'s \"special military operation\" in Ukraine on February
24, 2022. Based on the [direct testimonies of 29 Russian
businessmen]{.underline}, most of them based abroad, the [study
examines]{.underline} the [various financial mechanisms]{.underline}
which, increasingly complex and less transparent, are challenging
Western regulators, particularly in Europe.

A shadowy but strategic ally

\"The strategy of sanctions against Russian trade was to create fear. At
first, Russian importers and foreign exporters were less afraid of
checks by European customs officials than of restrictions imposed by
European banks, which in the face of the Russian risk, zealously
prevented all transactions with Russia, even on goods explicitly exempt
from sanctions,\" Nekrasov said. \"As a result, [[Russia]{.mark}n
financial operators, together [with]{.mark} their [partners]{.mark} and
friends [in the \'Global South]{.mark},\' [created
**alternative**]{.mark} foreign [trade]{.mark} settlement
[systems.]{.mark}\"]{.underline}

CH

Another [[realist interp]{.mark}retation [views Russia's invasion
through]{.mark} the lens of **[diversionary war
theory]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- the idea that leaders may provoke
external conflict to divert public attention from domestic turmoil or
unpopular policies (Levy and Vakili 1992). [There is [**precedent** for
Russian leaders]{.mark} using force abroad for domestic purposes, [from
Stalin's invasion of Finland]{.mark} in 1939 [to Putin's wars in
Chechnya and]{.mark} 2008 invasion of [Georgia]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Ferraro 2023). From this view, [[Putin faced]{.mark} a host of
[domestic challenges in 2022]{.mark}, from economic malaise, rampant
corruption and wealth inequality, to the prospect of more anti-regime
protests like those in 2020 and early 2022]{.underline} (Sharifulin
2023; McHugh 2023). "[The [Russian **invasion of Ukraine**]{.mark} could
have been [an attempt]{.mark} by Putin [to **garner popularity**
by]{.mark} invoking a distorted interpretation of Russia's history and
[playing on Russian nationalism]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Rogers and Yi
2022, para. 3). From the foregoing it is obvious that [launching a
nationalist, irredentist campaign to reconquer historically Russian
lands in [Ukraine]{.mark} may have been [calculated to **bolster Putin's
domestic standing**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [shift]{.mark} discussion [away
from internal grievances]{.mark}]{.underline}. The realist logic is that
leaders will take aggressive foreign policy actions when domestic
audiences become restive, to rally patriotic support and legitimacy.

The last subset of explanations that focuses on the elite's obsession
with power asserts that [[Russia]{.mark}n governing elites [seek]{.mark}
external [conflict to **compensate** for]{.mark} the [domestic
failures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Mendras 2015; Krastev and Holmes 2014;
Shevtsova 2015). [[Against]{.mark} the [growing economic and political
contradictions]{.mark} inside Russia, the argument goes, [Putin]{.mark}
and his elites increasingly [turned to **diversionary
conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gerstel 2016; Romanova 2018). As Ariel
Cohen (2007, 1) eloquently put it, [[foreign policy]{.mark} eventually
became [a **replacement of domestic politics**]{.mark} for Putin and [a
key instrument for "**buttressing domestic
support**]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark} With the progressing
dismantlement of all residual checks and balances in the Russian
political system, [[Putin developed]{.mark} a [**particular taste** for
diversion]{.mark} because it additionally [turned out to be]{.mark} a
cost-[**effective tool** to delegitimize]{.mark} the [opposition]{.mark}
in the eyes of nationalistic supporters]{.underline} (Blank 2008). [With
this, the "diversionary war" mechanism proposes that [the **greater**
economic weakness]{.mark} and other domestic problems in Russia, [the
more likely Putin would **resort to foreign aggression**]{.mark} to
compensate and distract the population from inner ills]{.underline}
(Forsberg and Herd 2015).

The pronounced deficit of legitimacy within the Putin system was found
to be the [[**primary catalyst** behind]{.mark} the escalating tensions
with [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}Klotz 2017). Against the
background of mounting problems in Russia in the early 2010s, [Russia's
[first invasion]{.mark} of Ukraine in 2014]{.underline}, according to
Mandelbaum (2019, 31), [[offered a way]{.mark} for Putin [to]{.mark}
both "[distract the]{.mark} Russian [public from]{.mark} the **[economic
difficulties]{.mark}** at home and rebuild his personal public
support."]{.underline} When Russia again invaded Ukraine eight years
later, [several pundits asserted that the [seeming irrationality of
Putin's decision]{.mark} to launch the attack can be [explained by the
processes]{.mark} within Putin's regime]{.underline}. They asserted that
Putin's progressing authoritarian turn played a grave role in producing
the invasion (Colton 2022). Kolesnikov (2022) contends that [during the
COVID-19 pandemic the isolation of the autocrat became particularly
chronic, as Putin lived in the info-bubble and "the distance between him
and the public became enormous]{.underline}." Around 2022, Putin finally
arrived at a moment where he would "hear only what he wants to hear and
says only what corresponds to his specific picture of the world, which
he then imposes on the population." Bäcker and Rak (2022) argued along
similar lines that the quality of the decision-making elite in the
Russian autocratic regime deteriorated to the extent that no one really
could challenge Putin's fixation on conquering Ukraine.

The Kremlin has grown confident that its risk-taking usually achieves
favorable results, leading it to adopt a more confrontational stance
with the West to achieve its strategic aims. That attitude of risk
tolerance rests on a perception that Russia and the current regime do
not face any imminent existential threats, despite fevered statements
from top officials about the dangers posed by NATO enlargement and
Ukraine's cooperation with Euro-Atlantic partners. In reality, [the
**most likely** threats to regime survival]{.underline} are likely to
[come from **within**]{.underline} and not from the West. [[A]{.mark}

emergence of a grassroots anti-war movement as Russian soldiers are

Russia's Personalized Regime & Succession Uncertainty

Similarly, Vladimir [[Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia has long been
characterized by a highly personalized regime sustained by the myth of
autocratic competence, where [[power is maintained through the]{.mark}
loyalty of a [small inner circle]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than
through robust institutional checks.

Over his more than two-decade tenure, Putin has systematically
eliminated potential rivals and has relied on a network of close
allies---often family members or long-time confidants---to secure his
hold on power.

Putin's approach has its roots in the turbulent post-Soviet era, a
reflection of him being a product of the old Soviet empire. [Although
his [early rule promised]{.mark} a degree of [stability]{.mark},
[concentration of power has created a system with weak]{.mark} formal
[institutions for]{.mark} leadership [transition]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Unlike the more diversified bureaucracy of the Chinese party-state,
[[Russia's political structure has few mechanisms to absorb]{.mark} a
sudden [departure of a leader]{.mark} whose authority is heavily
personalized]{.underline}. However, the invasion of Ukraine has changed
the configurations of power under Putin.

[[Should Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} suddenly step down, die, or [[**be
forced out**, the lack of a]{.mark} clearly institutionalized
[succession]{.mark} process [could lead to]{.mark} a scramble among
factions]{.underline}, potentially **[igniting a]{.underline}** crisis
or even a **[[civil conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Moreover, Putin's dependence on personal networks has led to an
environment of mistrust even within the elite. Purges and arrests of
high-ranking officials, often on corruption or fraud charges, further
erode the stability of the regime.

[[In a scenario where Putin's authority is abruptly removed]{.mark},
these [fractures]{.mark} could intensify into open power struggles,
**[destabiliz]{.mark}**ing [Russia]{.mark} both politically and
economically]{.underline}. Experts have noted that without a transparent
and pre-arranged line of succession, [Russia risks an internal
conflict]{.underline} that could undermine its strategic posture
internationally.

Comparative Dynamics & Implications for International Stability

While the domestic structures of China and Russia differ, both share the
common risk of a leadership crisis. This is due to the
over-concentration of power and the sidelining of succession planning.

In China, the elimination of institutionalized collective leadership
means that Xi's prolonged tenure may eventually result in a lack of
experienced, high-ranking leaders capable of taking over. In Russia, the
personalization of power and reliance on loyalty over competence have
created a brittle system vulnerable to factionalism if the central
figure disappears.

[[An unstable transition]{.underline}]{.mark} in either country [[would
have **significant international repercussions**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
For China, a leadership crisis could lead to policy uncertainty at a
time when it is asserting itself on the global stage through initiatives
like the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and a more assertive stance in
regional territorial disputes.

[[Instability could affect **global markets**, **supply chains**, and
**international security**]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially given
China's role as the world's second-largest economy and a key player in
global governance.

There is even a risk of the CCP starting a war along many of its
flashpoints to redirect and channel public discontent. Renewed
hostilities with India (i.e., the 1962 Sino-Indian War), an outright war
to reclaim Taiwan, or any number of aggressive actions along its
periphery are not out of the question.

In Russia, [the potential for an abrupt or contested transition
poses]{.underline} risks [not]{.underline} only domestically but also
[in]{.underline} its relations with [Europe and NATO]{.underline}. [A
[power struggle]{.mark} in Moscow [may embolden **separatist movements**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} places such as [[Chechnya]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**[[Given Russia's]{.mark} significant [nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}** and its strategic influence over Eastern
Europe, [[any]{.mark} internal collapse or [prolonged instability could
trigger]{.mark} [**regional security crises**, with **spillover
effects** in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and]{.mark} other parts of
Russia's periphery that would concern [the]{.mark} [broader
international community]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, warming four times faster than the
rest of the world, [may be the [key region for]{.mark} the [US and
Russia to advance cooperation]{.mark}. US-Russia [rapprochement]{.mark}
may broadly benefit the world by bringing an [end]{.mark} to
[the]{.mark} disastrous [war in Ukraine and reduc]{.mark}ing [the risk
of nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [[existential environmental
issues]{.mark}]{.underline} still [[demand
attention.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. [It is now the task]{.underline} of civil society
[to]{.underline} elevate climate change as a concern and [pressure the
two countries to include climate change in the Arctic cooperation
agenda]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Arctic climate crisis is the "canary
in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
[Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region
as a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: "We need to pursue
joint projects]{.underline}, including, for example, [in the Arctic."
The Arctic region makes sense as a setting for cooperation as the two
sides have explicitly expressed interest in exploring cooperation in
energy, investment, and geopolitical issues.]{.underline} [Western
sanctions on Russia have led Moscow to step up its cooperation in the
Arctic with China in joint energy ventures and]{.underline} grand plans
for [Arctic shipping]{.underline}. [US officials now see Arctic
cooperation as a potential means to "drive a wedge" between Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline}.

[In my meetings]{.underline} in Moscow [with [American and Russian
diplomats]{.mark}]{.underline} and businessmen over the past few weeks,
it is clear that [many are interested in diverse forms of Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}, from cultural diplomacy that celebrates the
commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the Bering Strait,
to [[scientific diplomacy]{.mark} to understand and adapt to climate
hazards]{.underline} faced by both nations. Business interests, however,
are at the top of the agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that [rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview]{.underline}.
Greenland has large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically
positioned alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits.
[Putin's offer to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration
with the US may]{.underline} also [have implications for Arctic
cooperation.]{.underline}

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

[The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the countries' diplomatic missions will significantly reduce the
current obstacles to US-Russia scientific cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline}. [By making it easier to issue visas and travel
between the two countries, Americans and Russians will again be able to
conduct joint research, expeditions, and scientific
conferences]{.underline} and build models to better understand the
unfolding climate emergency. [Scientific cooperation to understand the
changes affecting sea ice, **[permafrost,]{.mark}** ecosystems, and
local communities has been blunted by the political fallout of the war
in Ukraine.]{.underline}

[Cooperation in the Arctic can help [build regional
stability]{.mark}]{.underline}. More importantly, [Arctic cooperation
will build [trust]{.mark} between the US and Russia that
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} complement or [**[spill over into]{.mark}
other crucial fields** of cooperation such as [**arms control**, Middle
East peace, and global health]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Scientists use many different methods to study frozen ground. Scientists
verify satellite information by comparing it to what they have learned
from field studies. Other [scientists]{.underline} work in laboratories,
[experimenting on frozen ground]{.underline}. Indoors, scientists can
control conditions and **[study the processes that happen when the
ground freezes]{.underline}**. For example, they [can study how quickly
water freezes in different soils]{.underline}. Using computers,
scientists can model frozen ground conditions by including information
from [field work, satellites, and the laboratory.]{.underline} Experts
can test ideas, tweak variables, and make predictions of what will
happen to frozen ground in the future. For example, they can [[explore
how]{.mark} [permafrost]{.mark} may [react to increases in air
temperature]{.mark}]{.underline}. Eyes in the sky: satellite
observations of permafrost [**[Permafrost is hard to see]{.mark}**.
Relying on field observations alone is difficult.]{.underline}
**[[Satellites provide daily]{.mark} [data]{.mark} spanning the
globe.]{.underline}** However, current satellite sensors cannot probe
deeply into the ground. Instead, scientists study the landforms that are
associated with ground areas. Permafrost landscapes form recognizable
patterns, such as palsas and pingos[. Changes in these landscapes,
therefore, can also be a sign of warming.]{.underline} Specifically,
scientists look for active-layer detachments, retrogressive thaw slumps,
degraded ice-wedge polygons, and thermokarst lakes as symptoms of
permafrost thaw. Active-layer detachments are small landslides that
occur in the summer or on thawing permafrost. Retrogressive thaw slumps
occur when a slope fails because ice-rich permafrost advances into
undisturbed ground as material thaws. Ice wedge polygons are cracked
permafrost shaped into polygons. They are formed by contraction of
frozen ground in the winter, after which liquid water in the ground
freezes and expands to form cracks in the surface. Thawing ground ice
can gradually cave in, a process known as thermokarst that results in
irregular surfaces of marshy bowls. In areas of thawing permafrost,
trees can lose their firm standing, forming a "drunken forest."
[Satellite data can also **[inform scientists about]{.mark} the [surface
temperature]{.mark}** on the ground **and whether water near the surface
is frozen.**]{.underline} Scientists verify the satellite information by
comparing it to what they have learned in the field. The NASA Soil
Moisture Active Passive, or SMAP, satellite orbits Earth measuring the
amount of water in the top 5 centimeters (2 feet) of soil. SMAP can
decipher whether the soil is frozen or thawed. Scientists also use the
NASA gravity-detecting Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)
satellites to trace changes in groundwater reservoirs that may indicate
thawing permafrost. In the field: techniques to measure permafrost
Researchers measure coastal erosion and permafrost thaw. [Scientists
gather information in the field on ground temperature, frozen ground
depth, and moisture]{.underline}. This information is useful to
understanding how frozen ground forms and changes. [For example, with
this information, **scientists can get a [good idea of how permafrost is
changing over time]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [**Scientists
[monitor]{.mark} the [thickness]{.mark} of the permafrost active layer
temperature**, and the amount of groundwater.]{.underline} [[Scientists
working in the **field drill**]{.mark} [**hole**s]{.mark} and insert
instruments to take measurements underground.]{.underline} Temperature
and moisture sensors give information at various depths. Researchers try
to disturb the ground as little as possible while they work. However,
drilling creates heat. So, scientists use protected pipes and blow cold
air into the drill hole. These efforts keep the ground from thawing and
keep the measurements correct. [Scientists have set up monitoring sites
across areas of permafrost in the Arctic. **These [sites collect data
over many years]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Some sites were established back
in the 1840s. The long-term data help scientists understand the
permafrost\'s history, as well as its possible future.

That was too much for the U.S. Supreme Court. In its 1968 decision [in
[Zschernig v. Miller,]{.mark} the [Court]{.mark} [struck]{.mark} down
the [state inheritance]{.mark} measures]{.underline} even though no one
in the federal government was complaining. [The decision marked a zenith
of the **[dormant foreign affairs]{.mark} power**, under which the
states are **constitutionally [barred]{.mark}** [from action]{.mark}
that has **more** than "some **incidental or indirect
[effect]{.mark}**[" on **foreign relations**.]{.mark}]{.underline} As
Michael Glennon and Robert Sloane describe in Foreign Affairs
Federalism, the decision had a pedigree dating back to the Founding.
[The Court had on many occasions rejected a role for the states in the
making of foreign relations. The U.S. reports are strewn with
pronouncements turning federalism on its head in the context of foreign
relations.]{.underline} The American constitutional system is ordinarily
premised on the states as the default locus of government. [When it
comes to foreign relations, the states have been presumed to have **no
part at all.**]{.underline}

This has always been something of an exaggeration, but not much of one.
For much of the nation's history, so-called federal exclusivity
presented a structural imperative. [For purposes of international
relations, the United States was processed by others as a **unitary
actor**]{.underline}. That was true legally: [traditional [international
law recognized the **nation-state**]{.mark} [as]{.mark} the **[only
entity]{.mark}** with legal personality]{.underline}. Under
international law, the nation was held responsible for the acts of its
constituent units, private and public. The doctrine was also rooted in
the sociology of international relations. In a world in which federal
states and democracies were oddities both, other sovereigns were
unlikely to differentiate among governmental units or comprehend any
discretion on the part of subnational units to act independently of the
national government.

[Serious, potentially **catastrophic** difficulty could follow where
states of the Union **[offended foreign sovereigns]{.mark}** who then
turned around and responded against the **United States as a
whole.**]{.underline} In striking down a California statute requiring a
shipowner's bond on certain noncitizen passengers (they would all have
been Asian) in Chy Lung v. Freeman (1876), the Supreme Court posed the
hypothetical case of a British woman deemed "lewd and debauched" by
state authorities and the resulting claim for redress by the Queen of
England. "Upon whom would such a claim be made? Not upon the State of
California; for, by our Constitution, she can hold no exterior relations
with other nations," concluded the Court. "It would be made upon the
government of the United States. If that government should get into a
difficulty which would lead to war, or to suspension of intercourse,
would California alone suffer, or all the Union?" As Hamilton wrote in
Federalist No. 80, "the peace of the whole ought not to be left at the
disposal of the part."

[In a global system premised on unitary state responsibility, the
**[externalities]{.mark}** of state and local action were
**intolerable**.]{.underline} [Sub-federal decisionmaking would be
**[systematically suboptimal]{.mark}**. Foreign relations involved
actors beyond American control.]{.underline} In the 19th century
setting, war was a common result of disturbances between nations. In the
mid-20th, the nation's survival hung in the balance. The Soviet Union
may not have taken state probate judges very seriously, or indeed have
noticed them at all. But why take the risk? In ordinary contexts, the
states are laboratories of democracy. But it doesn't make much sense to
allow experiments that have a chance of blowing up the building.

Of course, there has never been a way to neatly draw the line between
the local and the global. Historically, the trickiest episodes involved
state-level action where the international repercussions were
unintended, as when South Carolina detained black British sailors (in
the same way it detained free American black sojourners) or when rioters
were inadequately punished for mob violence against Italian immigrants
in late 19th century New Orleans. These and other episodes triggered
serious protests from powerful countries, and yet the federal government
was left without recourse to remedy the wrongs.

That [[state-level action **threatened** the national
interest]{.mark}]{.underline} begged the question of who was best able
to enforce against it. In most cases, the federal government's capacity
to affirmatively trump state law has been unchallenged, certainly where
a direct conflict exists between state and federal statutory schemes.
The more contested question is whether the courts should step in when no
such conflict exists. [Glennon and Sloane play this as a refrain: if a
state risked offending a foreign power, Congress could always act to
make things right. "\[I\]t's hard to imagine an egregious abuse of state
power in the realm of foreign affairs]{.underline}," they write, "[that
the federal government would not step in to prevent.]{.underline}"
[Leaving aside what qualifies as "egregious" in this context, that
response [**doesn't take into account timing and political
incentives**.]{.mark} Congress has always been a slow ship to turn;
foreign relations can be **fast-moving**.]{.underline} Before you knew
it, [the nation could be staring down a serious international dispute,
the result of some provincial **hotheadedness** that could not be shut
down quickly enough.]{.underline}

[Political incentives have also left Congress at a comparative
institutional disadvantage, retarding legislative action to correct
subfederal action inconsistent with the national interest]{.underline}.
In the Cold War context, for example, legislators were loath to look
pro-Soviet. The courts, by contrast, were well situated to do the
national government's bidding. In this context, moreover, the courts
were unburdened by the kind of anxieties that led them to shy from other
foreign relations controversies, especially those between the White
House and Congress. The courts could quash state and local activity
confident that the result would stabilize (or at least not destabilize)
U.S. relations with foreign powers.

[probability]{.mark} of nuclear war]{.underline}. The model is based on
[[14]{.mark} [interrelated scenarios]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [how]{.mark}

a conventional war or a [non-war crisis]{.mark}, whether escalation is
intentional or [inadvertent]{.mark}, the presence of false alarms of
various types, and the presence of non-war nuclear detonations such as
nuclear terrorism.]{.underline} As a first step towards quantifying the
probability of nuclear war using the model, the paper also includes a
[[dataset]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline} [historical incidents

#### Melting permafrost leads to mammoth bone extraction

In the late winter of [2018, an unlikely protest was staged in Yakutsk,
a Siberian [city]{.mark} [traditionally blanketed]{.mark} each year
[in]{.mark} a deep [snow]{.mark}.]{.underline} Here, in the middle of
[the Sakha Republic, the Soviet Union built the city on the tundra
[where mammoths once roamed]{.mark}. From five million years ago until
as recently as 4,000 years ago, their padded feet trod on
[permafrost]{.mark} soils that [encased]{.mark} sparkling seams of
diamonds. As the Ice Age came to a close, extinction stalked the
mammoths, whose roving packs ended in fixed [graves]{.mark}. [Ivory
tusk]{.mark}s and burly [bones]{.mark} accumulated [in the
tundra]{.mark}, where they remained buried in frozen dirt and grass for
millennia---[until]{.mark} [climate change]{.mark} reared its
head.]{.underline}

[As the permafrost has [thawed]{.mark}, [allowing mammoths']{.mark}
massive [teeth]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [poke]{.mark} [above]{.mark}
[ground]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[residents]{.mark} have come with picks
and shovels to [dig them out]{.mark}. Groups of Chinese [mammoth ivory
hunters]{.mark} have also arrived, [armed]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
[hydraulic hoses]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [deals]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
so-called Russian mammoth [oligarchs]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the
prehistoric [commodity]{.mark} is whisked out in [Russian helicopters
and boats on its way to ornate shops in mainland China]{.underline} and
Hong Kong, Yakutian mammoth ivory hunters are getting the short end of
the stick. Angry at this dispossession, [locals [protested]{.mark} in
2018 with signs bearing succinct demands. "[Return the tusks to
the]{.mark} [people]{.mark}!" one declared. Another exclaimed, "Stop
creating a nightmare for Arctic communities!"]{.underline}

The events in Yakutsk are a microcosm of the "dark Arctic." This
darkening is twofold[. Climate change is casting a pall over the
Arctic's legendarily snow-white land- and seascapes. Once-frozen oceans
are melting into cobalt blue pools.]{.underline} Snow and ice are
turning shades of black, gray, and pink as soot and algae accumulate on
their warming surfaces.

Rather, [the war is hardening into a grinding stalemate]{.underline} ---
one [that threatens to **exhaust Ukraine**]{.underline}, [**fracture
Western unity** and **empower** the]{.underline} very **[regime it was
meant to weaken]{.underline}**. The question Western policymakers must
now confront is not whether Ukraine deserves support, but whether the
current strategy is helping it win, or simply helping it survive long
enough to lose more slowly.

This doesn't mean Ukraine should surrender, nor does it mean abandoning
Western support. It does, however, demand an honest reckoning[: There is
no pathway to]{.underline} total [Ukrainian victor]{.underline}y --- and
pretending otherwise is no substitute for strategy.

Where we are today, preserving Ukraine's sovereignty and stabilizing
Europe may depend less on weapons than on diplomacy.

On paper, the West is still backing Ukraine robustly. The latest \$61
billion U.S. aid package passed after months of political gridlock;
European countries are slowly scaling up defense production; and NATO
continues to signal resolve. But [the military reality is more sobering
than many Western headlines suggest]{.underline}.

Firstly, [Ukraine faces a demographic cliff]{.underline}: According to
its own defense ministry, [over 30 percent of conscripts are failing to
report for duty]{.underline}. New mobilization laws are lowering the
draft age to 25, but recruitment shortfalls persist. And [the country's
population is shrinking due to emigration and war
casualties.]{.underline}

Additionally, [the economy has suffered a severe contraction from the
war]{.underline}, greatly impacting infrastructure, industry and
livelihoods. With emergency powers wearing thin and frustration mounting
over corruption and mismanagement, **[political tensions are rising in
Kyiv]{.underline}**.

[Russia]{.underline}, meanwhile[, has adapted. Its economy is now on a
war footing; its defense industry is outproducing the West]{.underline}
in artillery shells[; and its military]{.underline} --- though
inefficient and brutal --- [maintains the advantage]{.underline} in
manpower and strategic depth[. Its political leadership has also
internalized long-term costs in pursuit of minimal territorial
gains]{.underline}.

WASHINGTON --- [Russia could be forced to end the war in Ukraine because
it will run out of money to pay its troops, according to experts at the
DC-based Institute for the Study of War.]{.underline}

The country has [burned through roughly half of its \$106 billion liquid
sovereign-wealth fund, which is used to pay troops' salaries and new
recruits bonuses]{.underline}, experts said.

Moscow can likely [only afford another 12 to 16 months]{.underline} of
fighting at its current pace, with about 30,000 to 45,000 Russian troops
killed or injured in Ukraine each month since its 2022 invasion began,
ISW's Russia team lead George Barros told The Post.

"The system for generating fighters worked for 2.5 years but it's
[starting to fail,"]{.underline} he said Friday. "[Russia is constrained
by the laws of economics, scarce resources, and there isn't an endless
manpower resource in Russia."]{.underline}

The Kremlin's cash has dwindled as troop salaries and [recruiting
bonuses balloon amid staggering inflation]{.underline}, according to
Russian Finance Ministry data.

Even President Trump weighed in on Moscow's prospects Friday, noting in
a Truth Social post that "Russia has to get moving" on ending its war
because "too many people (are) DYING, thousands a week."

That [reality could create an opening for the US to push Russian
President Vladimir Putin harder for a peace deal]{.underline}. Putin has
been stalling negotiations after rejecting Trump's full cease-fire
proposal --- a deal Ukraine already agreed to --- a month ago.

"The United States can use the enormous challenges Russia will face in
2025 as leverage to secure critical concessions in ongoing negotiations
to end the war by continuing and even expanding military support to
Ukraine," ISW's Christina Harward wrote in a recent report.

[[Whenever international rules become meaningless,
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} naturally [[seek safety in
armaments]{.underline}]{.mark} and military alliances. Given events in
Ukraine, can anyone blame Poland for almost doubling its army and
military budget, Finland for joining NATO or Saudi Arabia for pursuing a
defence treaty with the United States?

Unfortunately, [the increase in military budgets comes at the expense of
society\'s weakest members, as money is diverted from schools and
clinics to tanks and missiles]{.underline}. Military alliances, too,
tend to widen inequality. Weak states left outside their protective
shield become easy prey. [[As militarised blocs spread around the
world]{.mark}, trade routes become strained and commerce declines, with
the poor paying the highest price]{.underline}. And [as tensions between
the militarised blocs increase, [chances grow that a small spark in a
remote corner of the world will **ignite a global
conflagration**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since alliances rely on
credibility, [[even a minor challenge]{.mark} in an insignificant
location [can become a casus belli for a **third world
war**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Humanity has seen it]{.underline}]{.mark} all
[[before]{.underline}.]{.mark} More than 2,000 years ago Sun Tzu,
Kautilya and Thucydides exposed how in a lawless world the quest for
security makes everyone less secure. And past experiences like the
second world war and the cold war have repeatedly taught us that [in a
global conflict it is the weak who suffer
disproportionately]{.underline}.

[During the second world war]{.underline}, for example, [one of the
highest casualty rates was in]{.underline} the Dutch East
Indies---today\'s [Indonesia]{.underline}. When the war broke out in
eastern Europe in 1939, it seemed a world away from the rice farmers of
Java, but [events in Poland ignited a chain reaction that killed
about]{.underline} 3.5m-[4m Indonesians]{.underline}, mostly [through
starvation or forced labour at the hands of Japanese
occupiers.]{.underline} This constituted 5% of the Indonesian
population, a higher casualty rate than among many major belligerents,
including the United States (0.3%), Britain (0.9%) and Japan (3.9%).
Twenty years later Indonesia again paid a particularly heavy price. The
cold war may have been cold in Berlin, but it was a scorching inferno in
Jakarta. In 1965-66 between 500,000 and 1m Indonesians were killed in
massacres caused by tensions between communists and anti-communists.

[[The situation now is potentially worse than it was in 1939]{.mark} or
1965. It\'s not only that [a **nuclear war** would endanger]{.mark}
hundreds of [millions]{.mark}]{.underline} of people in neutral
countries. [[Humanity also faces the]{.underline}]{.mark} additional
[[existential threats of climate change and]{.underline}]{.mark}
out-of-control artificial intelligence ([[AI).]{.underline}]{.mark}

[As military budgets rise, so money that could have helped solve global
warming fuels a global arms race instead]{.underline}. And [[as military
competition intensifies, so the goodwill necessary for agreements on
climate change evaporate]{.mark}s]{.underline}. [[Rising tensions also
ruin the chance of reaching agreements on limiting an AI arms
race]{.underline}]{.mark}. Drone warfare in particular is advancing
rapidly, and the world may soon see swarms of fully autonomous drones
fighting each other in Ukraine\'s sky, and killing thousands of people
on the ground. The killer robots are coming, but humans are paralysed by
disagreement. If peace isn\'t brought to Ukraine soon, everyone is
likely to suffer, even if they live thousands of kilometres from Kyiv
and think the battle there has nothing to do with them.

Breaking the biggest taboo

Making peace is never easy. It has been said that nations march into war
through a barn door, but the only exit is through a mousehole. In the
face of conflicting claims and interests, it is difficult to assign
blame and find a reasonable compromise. Nevertheless, as wars go, the
Russo-Ukrainian war is exceptionally simple.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine\'s independence
and borders were universally recognised. The country felt so secure that
it agreed to give up the nuclear arsenal it had inherited from the
Soviet Union, without demanding that Russia or other powers do the same.
In exchange, in 1994 Russia (as well as the United States and Britain)
signed the Budapest Memorandum, promising to \"refrain from the threat
or use of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence\" of Ukraine. It was one of the biggest acts of unilateral
disarmament in history. Swapping nuclear bombs for paper promises seemed
to Ukrainians like a wise move in 1994, when trust in international
rules and agreements ran high.

Twenty years later, in 2014, the Russo-Ukrainian war began when Russian
forces occupied Crimea and fomented separatist movements in eastern
Ukraine. The war ebbed and flowed for the following eight years, until
in February 2022 Russia mounted an onslaught aimed at conquering all of
Ukraine.

Russia has given various excuses for its actions, most notably that it
was pre-empting a Western attack on Russia. However, neither in 2014 nor
in 2022 was there any imminent threat of such an armed invasion. [Vague
talk about \"Western imperialism]{.underline}\" or \"cultural
Coca-Colonialism\" [may be good enough to fuel debates in ivory towers,
but it cannot legitimate]{.underline} massacring the inhabitants of
Bucha or [bombing Mariupol to rubble.]{.underline}

For most of history the term \"imperialism\" referred to cases when a
powerful state such as Rome, Britain or tsarist Russia conquered foreign
lands and turned them into provinces. This kind of imperialism gradually
became taboo after 1945. While there has been no shortage of wars in the
late 20th and early 21st centuries---with horrendous conflicts ongoing
in Palestine and Israel, and in Sudan, Myanmar and elsewhere---there
have so far been no cases when an internationally recognised country was
simply wiped off the map owing to annexation by a powerful conqueror.
When Iraq tried to do that to Kuwait in 1990-91, an international
coalition restored Kuwaiti independence and territorial integrity. And
when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, there was never a question
of annexing the country or any part of it.

Russia has already annexed not just Crimea but also all the territories
its armies are currently occupying in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin
is following the imperial principle that any territory conquered by the
Russian army is annexed by the Russian state. Indeed, Russia went as far
as annexing several regions that its armies merely intend to conquer,
such as the unoccupied parts of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk
oblasts.

Mr Putin has not bothered to hide his imperial intentions. He has
repeatedly argued since at least 2005 that the collapse of the Soviet
empire was \"the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", and
has promised to rebuild this empire. He has further argued that the
Ukrainian nation doesn\'t really exist, and that Russia has a historical
right to the entire territory of Ukraine.

[[If]{.underline}]{.mark} Mr **[[Putin is allowed to
win]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Ukraine, [this kind of [imperialism will
make a comeback all over the world]{.mark}. What will then restrain
Venezuela,]{.underline} for example, [from conquering Guyana, or Iran
from conquering the United Arab Emirates?]{.underline} What will
restrain Russia itself from conquering Estonia or Kazakhstan? No border
and [[no state could find safety in anything except armaments]{.mark}
and alliances. If the taboo on imperial conquests is
broken,]{.underline} then even [states]{.underline} whose independence
and borders won international recognition long ago [will face a growing
risk of invasion, and even of again becoming imperial
provinces.]{.underline}

[This danger is not lost on observers in former imperial
colonies]{.underline}. In a speech in February 2022 [the Kenyan
ambassador]{.underline} to the UN, Martin Kimani, [explained that after
the collapse of the European empires newly liberated people in Africa
and elsewhere treated international borders as sacrosanct, for they
understood that the **alternative was waging endless
wars**]{.underline}. African countries have inherited many potentially
disputed borders from the imperial past, yet, as Mr Kimani explained,
\"we agreed that we would settle for the borders that we
inherited...Rather than form nations that looked ever backward into
history with a dangerous nostalgia, we chose to look forward to a
greatness none of our many nations and peoples had ever known.\"
Referring to Mr Putin\'s attempt to rebuild the Soviet empire, Mr Kimani
said that although imperial collapse typically leaves many unfulfilled
yearnings, these should never be pursued by force. \"We must complete
our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not
plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression.\"

As Mr Kimani hinted, the driving force behind Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine is imperial nostalgia. Russia\'s territorial demands in Ukraine
have no basis in international law. Of course, like every country,
Russia does have legitimate security concerns, and any peace agreement
must take them into account. During the past century Russia has suffered
repeated invasions that cost the lives of many millions of its citizens.
Russians deserve to feel secure and respected. But no Russian security
concerns can justify destroying Ukrainian nationhood. Nor should they
cause us to forget that Ukraine too has legitimate security concerns.
Given events of the past decade, Ukraine clearly needs guarantees
against future Russian aggression more robust than the Budapest
Memorandum or the Minsk Agreements of 2014-15.

Empires have always justified themselves by prioritising their own
security concerns, but the larger they became the more security concerns
they acquired. Ancient Rome first embarked on its imperial project
because of security concerns in central Italy, and eventually found
itself fighting brutal wars thousands of kilometres from Italy because
of its security concerns on the Danube and Euphrates. If Russia\'s
security concerns are acknowledged as a legitimate basis for making
conquests on the Dnieper, they too may soon be used to justify conquests
on the Danube and Euphrates.

As the climate changes, rainfall will likely increase in Yakutia. That
could make permafrost thaw even faster and speed up global warming.

Each summer, [Gabriela Schaepman-Strub, a professor of earth systems
science at the University of Zurich, would travel to Yakutia to research
how increased rainfall might affect permafrost]{.underline}.
Schaepman-Strub set up testing sites with sprinkler systems on the
tundra, including elaborate shelters with gutters and water pumps, to
study the impact.

This kind of research can present quite a few obstacles.
Schaepman-Strub's research site, located in the Kytalyk National Park,
is only accessible by a boat ride up the winding Indigirka River. Clouds
of ravenous mosquitos swarm in the summer air and researchers sleep in
large tents.

[But after nearly 15 years of traveling regularly to Russia, [her
university]{.mark} also [prohibited]{.mark} her from [working]{.mark} in
the region after the war broke out in Ukraine.]{.underline}

"We invested a lot of money and manpower to assemble the systems on
site, so this is a [huge effort that is just being totally
lost."]{.underline}

Gabriela Schaepman-Strub, professor of earth systems science, University
of Zurich

"We invested a lot of money and manpower to assemble the systems on
site, so this is a huge effort that is just being totally lost,"
Schaepman-Strub said.

This year, she [attempted to continue her experiments remotely, by
having Russian colleagues check in on her research sites during the
summer.]{.underline} But they weren't able to devote the same amount of
time and quality control. Some of the equipment at the research site
malfunctioned, ruining parts of the experiments.

Schaepman-Strub had planned to run the experiment for at least three
more years. But to continue, [she needs to [send new water pumps]{.mark}
to Russia, which is now [difficult]{.mark}, [given]{.mark} the
[restrictions]{.mark} [on]{.mark} sending money or [importing]{.mark}
goods to Russia from the West.]{.underline}

If she fails to get the failed part of her experiment running again next
year, it will be destroyed due to overexposure to natural elements.

Her [Russian [colleagues]{.mark} have also been [unable to send
her]{.mark} this year's [data]{.mark} on soil moisture and temperature,
[since]{.mark} Russian [authorities]{.mark} have [implemented new
restrictions on sharing data]{.mark} [with scientists outside
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

"We always needed permission to export the data, but this year,
permission is not being granted," Schaepman-Strub said.

Many other scientists have also been denied the ability to receive
scientific data or samples for experiments, like rocks used in
geological studies.

[Russian authorities have not officially stated why the scientific data
is being withheld.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, R[ussian researchers are now having to do fieldwork
alone.]{.underline}

Alexander Fedorov, deputy director of the Melnikov Permafrost Institute
in Yakutsk, Yakutia's capital, said his institute had to reduce the
amount of fieldwork they did this year by about half, in part because
they lost so much [foreign funding in 2022]{.underline}. They've had to
redirect their work to things like creating computer models that can be
done from an office.

"Global warming increases because of permafrost degradation and it's a
problem that's continuing, so it will be very bad if we lose several
years of data," Fedorov said.
