### A2 Shipping Routes

[POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND INDUSTRY GUIDANCE]{.underline}

[This paper has unveiled the potential of the Northern Sea Route as an
alternative to the Suez Canal. The findings reveal that the former will
be a viable choice only for specific products, under specific ice
conditions. These findings hold varying implications for different
stakeholders.]{.underline}

First, [the Arctic shipping route serves as a reality check against the
nearly romanticized notion of its immediate economic
viability]{.underline}. [Contrary to popular belief, economic gains are
not readily attainable. Analysis indicates that the NSR becomes
cost-effective only when the sea ice extent reaches 25
percent]{.underline}, [and even then, it remains feasible only for
select goods]{.underline}. A complete shift from the Suez Canal to the
NSR for shipping goods from Shanghai to Rotterdam can only occur when
ice-free conditions prevail. Projections suggest the NSR could be
ice-free during summers between 2035 to late and fully ice-free by 2050
to 2065. Nevertheless, [immediate economic benefits are not
anticipated.]{.underline}

\[\*102\] [Shipping schedules are planned weeks to months in advance,
offering the possibility of aligning shipments with periods of low sea
ice extent]{.underline}. However, [Arctic weather unpredictability and
the absence of opportunities for cargo drop-off and reload along the
route significantly diminish potential profit margins]{.underline}.
Hence, [it remains a reasonable assessment that the NSR will not emerge
as a global shipping route until it is predominantly ice-free for a
substantial portion of the year.]{.underline}

[Chinese exporters and government officials can utilize these findings
to strategically allocate resources toward vessels]{.underline} capable
of navigating icy waters and icebreakers. [Monitoring sea-ice conditions
enables them to discern optimal timing for investing in such vessels,
training personnel, and developing large-scale icebreakers. However, as
previously discussed, this constitutes a long-term investment strategy
with delayed returns]{.underline}. Moreover, [it entails substantial
financial outlay, particularly considering that only select goods are
economically viable for shipping via the NSR in icy
conditions.]{.underline} The construction of a large-scale icebreaker
spans a decade and carries a staggering cost of approximately USD 1
billion, with additional expenses incurred for maintenance and extending
operational life.44Link to the text of the note Given these factors, it
may be prudent to contemplate this process in the near future;
[investments of this magnitude would be impractical, especially
considering that only goods with high transportation costs relative to
final delivery prices warrant shipment in or below 25 percent sea ice
conditions]{.underline}. Furthermore, [considering estimates of ice-free
summers by 2035 and open routes by 2050, a ten-year icebreaker
development project could be obsolete by the time it is
complete]{.underline}. [Chinese exporters, government officials, and
potential NSR users like South Korea and Japan might be better advised
to defer such extensive investments until the Arctic conditions are
ice-free]{.underline}. [At the moment they can invest in personnel
training, vessel improvements to withstand the harsh environment, and
navigational technology in Arctic conditions. When eventually deemed
economical, investments could be made in the infrastructure along the
NSR coastline, such as ports and maintenance facilities.]{.underline}
Concurrently, they can wait until countries such as Russia develop the
NSR with ports and icebreaker services to avoid substantial financial
commitments for marginal gains.

#### NSR viability is overblown and no timeframe

ABSTRACT

[This paper challenges the optimistic outlook on a near-term
economically viable Northern Sea Route]{.underline} (NSR) by delving
into the prospective impacts of utilizing the NSR over the traditional
Suez Canal for shipping. The paper uses Chinese exports of paint,
computers, and motor vehicles from Shanghai, China to Rotterdam,
Netherlands as a case study to support this argument. The study examines
transportation costs under varying sea ice conditions and incorporates
icebreaker fees through a sensitivity analysis. [Based on the analysis,
the paper posits that the NSR will only be commercially viable for
select goods when sea ice extent]{.underline} [reaches 25 percent or
less]{.underline}. While [projections suggest an icefree Arctic by late
mid-century, significant investment is needed for the NSR to compete
with the Suez Canal]{.underline}. These investments are most justifiable
for Russia, which could capitalize on icebreaker services and port fees
as the route becomes more accessible. China may benefit from waiting on
Russia\'s infrastructure development, while icebreaker companies would
need to strike competitive rates and shipping liners should adopt a
wait-and-see approach.

\[\*94\] INTRODUCTION

The Arctic is at the forefront of climate change, experiencing warming
at a rate twice that of the global average.2Link to the text of the note
The region is rapidly heading towards consistent seasonal ice-free
conditions, with a 12.6 percent reduction in sea ice over the past forty
years.3Link to the text of the note Notably, since 2007, the Northwest
Passage (NWP) and the Northern Sea Route (NSR) have been ice-free in
late summer.4Link to the text of the note Studies have highlighted that
a decrease in sea ice cover can result in substantial distance savings,
particularly between East Asia and Western Europe. This would mean up to
30 to 50 percent reduction in travel and goods\' transport time across
the NWP and NSR, compared to the Suez Canal.5Link to the text of the
note Accordingly, shipping companies, governments (especially China),
and profit-driven ventures view the NSR as a potential global shipping
route to cut transportation costs.

[While the idea of using the Arctic particularly the NSR for shipping
seems promising, there are practical challenges. First, sea ice
conditions within the NSR can impede transit times and impose vessel
limitations, thus elevating shipping costs and negating the advantages
of economies of scale. Second, the lack of stops along the NSR results
in fewer opportunities for unloading and reloading cargo, limiting
potential profits when compared to the Suez Canal. The challenges the
NSR presents raise uncertainties about its superiority over the Suez
Canal or its potential to improve China\'s export
competitiveness.]{.underline}

This paper employs two key approaches to comprehend the potential
effects of the NSR on Chinese exports and dispel illusions surrounding
the economic feasibility of the Northern Sea Route in the near realm.
First, it assesses the transportation costs of select Chinese exports
using the Suez Canal and compares them with costs using the NSR under
varying sea ice conditions. Second, the paper conducts a sensitivity
analysis test, comparing the resulting transportation costs for each
Chinese export under different NSR icebreaker scenarios (fees), which
depend on the prevailing sea ice conditions. This test reveals how
transportation costs for each examined export are susceptible to
icebreaker fees in comparison to the current shipping route through the
Suez Canal.

### A2 Russia China Coop

**Buchanan 24**, \[Elizabeth Buchanan PHD, Senior fellow at the
Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) and an Associate Researcher

The NSR wraps along the Russian coastline for most of its route. This is
important to Russia for two reasons. First, much of the NSR falls within
Russia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and therefore Moscow has deemed
it necessary to charge transit tariffs. The tariffs have been
accompanied by Russia's introduction of tight rules and domestic laws
for foreign firms looking to use the route. Second, Russia insists
vessels can only navigate the NSR when accompanied by Russian nuclear
icebreakers. Tapping into NSR potential is thus subject to strict
Russian directives. [The [notion]{.mark} that there is a [Sino-Russian
Arctic alliance]{.mark} is a [misinterpretation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[realities]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [drive]{.mark} [China and Russia
together]{.mark} in the Arctic While mutually [beneficial]{.mark}
[interests]{.mark} -- and the overall sense of 'win-win' agreements --
facilitate close engagement between Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic, it
is [still problematic to assume]{.mark} an [Arctic 'axis']{.mark} is
[forthcoming]{.mark}.]{.underline} China's efforts to increase its
engagement in the Arctic are occurring far beyond the Russian Arctic
Zone. Iceland was the first European state to sign a free-trade
agreement with Beijing, and China's first intergovernmental framework in
the Arctic was struck with Iceland in 2012. Various Chinese state energy
interests have been floated in geothermal resources in Iceland -- but to
date the projects have been abandoned. In 2018, the China--Iceland
Arctic Science Observatory opened and continues to operate. Iceland
strategically presents as a logistics hub that would act as a key
shipping port between Europe and Asia along the NSR. [It seems clear
that [Chinese Arctic strategy]{.mark} is to 'internationalise' the
Arctic in a way that features and [promotes]{.mark} China's [strategic
benefit]{.mark}]{.underline}. China is also driven by great power
ideology and the prestige afforded by having a global polar footprint.
Russia is aware of this simmering rationale for Chinese Arctic strategy.
Efforts by China to move beyond the agreed terms of its mutually
beneficial arrangement with Moscow within the Russian Arctic Zone, and
how closely China adheres to the existing legal and sovereign
arrangements of the Arctic Ocean, w[ill certainly be a [limits
test]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the Sino-Russian Arctic '[alliance']{.mark}.
Indeed, Sino-Russian strategic [tensions]{.mark} [remain]{.mark}, well
beyond the [overhanging fear of centuries of mistrust]{.mark} and the
issue of the Russian Far East.]{.underline} In June 2020,
[[Moscow]{.mark} [accused]{.mark} one of its leading [Arctic
scientists]{.mark}, Valery Mitko, [of spying]{.mark} for
Beijing]{.underline}. Mitko was charged with treason for handing over
classified information on Arctic research and submarine sensor
technology to China. But perhaps more telling is the way that both
countries have hushed up the incident, with neither formally commenting
on the arrest. For now, Beijing and Moscow appear to agree to disagree
-- so long as Arctic LNG business is booming. The narrative of Moscow
and Beijing working together to carve up the Arctic riches and take
control of new global transport corridors has started to make its way
into the policy and defence planning documents of Arctic-rim states.
Washington's litany of Arctic strategic planning documents -- Naval, Air
Force and Coast Guard strategies -- feature renewed great power
competition in the Arctic as a central security threat. [However, the
notion that there is a Sino-Russian Arctic alliance is a
misinterpretation of the realities that drive China and Russia together
in the Arctic.]{.underline} The realities of the Sino-Russian
relationship (dubbed by both as one of 'mutual benefit') in the Arctic
is best grasped when the limits of the partnership are considered. There
are, first and foremost, limits in terms of geographical boundaries. The
Russian Arctic Zone is the lion's share of the Arctic region, home to
the NSR and a vast percentage of Arctic resources. [The Russian Arctic
Zone is also the geographical 'limit' of Sino-Russian Arctic
'cooperation' as well.]{.underline} Of the eight members of the Arctic
Council, Russia took the most convincing to grant China its observer
status in 2013. Moscow approved membership, and with it, legitimacy, on
the basis that Beijing explicitly acknowledged the sovereignty of
Arctic-rim states and reaffirmed its commitment to the legal
architecture of the Arctic region -- the UN Convention on the Law of the
Sea. Russia watches, with tempered suspicion, Beijing's Arctic high sea
missions and scientific research agenda in what China sees as a global
commons[. Yet within the Russian Arctic Zone, Russia welcomes Chinese
engagement, but on Kremlin terms]{.underline}. Since 2014, with Western
sanctions over Russia's annexation of Crimea and sustained aggression in
Ukraine, Moscow has had a cashflow problem. Despite key economic
strategic partnerships in the Russian Arctic, China is busy diversifying
itself throughout the region. [[China is actively engaging with other
Arctic-rim powers]{.mark} and has commercial ventures, investment plans
and entrenched soft-power strategies in [Norway]{.mark},
[Canada]{.mark}, [Iceland]{.mark} and [Denmark]{.mark} (through
Greenland).]{.underline} Despite mutually beneficial interests in the
Arctic, commercial realpolitik is at the heart of China and Russia\'s
engagement in the region Russia's Arctic strategy is built on both
economic security and frontier border security objectives. The
Sino-Russian relationship lends itself to these economic security
interests and ambitions, but it is less effective at navigating Russia's
Arctic 'siege mentality'. [This is largely because of the kind of
increased interest and activity that China is undertaking in the Arctic
-- and against which Russia seeks to secure its vast open
frontier]{.underline}. [Any [deterioration in Sino-Russian]{.mark} ties
could [threaten]{.mark} [this delicate balance]{.mark}. [Russian]{.mark}
[efforts]{.mark} to [securitise]{.mark} its economic interests in the
Arctic fall short of an expansionist agenda. Beyond the posturing,
ultimately Moscow's Arctic priority remains regional
stability]{.underline}. Continued regional cooperation with its
NATO-member and Western Arctic neighbours remains a central strategic
objective. After all, keeping the arena free of conflict is crucial to
ensuring the NSR (and Russia's future economic resource base) remains
open and commercially viable. Russia needs to be able to deliver secure,
trusted and unimpeded energy supplies from its northern frontier to
Asian and European energy clients. [The same cannot be assumed of
[Chinese]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} interests, with clear indicators of an
[emerging expansionist]{.mark} agenda.]{.underline} While much of
Beijing's recent Arctic Ocean missions have been primarily about
'raising the flag' and promoting soft-power public relations campaigns
for domestic consumption, it is evident that China is set to stay in the
Arctic. While much of the Arctic Ocean is delineated by territorial seas
and agreed maritime boundaries, the central Arctic Ocean does hold
international waters, which facilitates Chinese engagement[.
Fragmentation of Sino-Russian relations in the Arctic context might yet
emerge from the outcomes of the Arctic continental shelf
debate.]{.underline} Via the UN Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf, Russia, Canada and Denmark have all submitted formal,
yet overlapping, claims to this continental shelf. Should a claim be
upheld, the awarded state will then claim exclusive rights to the seabed
and the resources beneath the area of the North Pole. This would block
China's access to seabed or resources in the international Arctic waters
around the North Pole. Overall, continued efforts to put Moscow and
Beijing in the same 'basket' when it comes to great power competition in
the Arctic 'great game' is short-sighted and misses critical
opportunities to futureproof the Arctic as a zone of international
cooperation, collaboration and low tension. Sino-Russian Arctic ties
will continue to be predictable to a large extent. Ties will remain
mutually beneficial -- until they are not. Predicting this point should
be the priority for Arctic stakeholders. The problem appears to be, for
now, that many [stakeholders [assume]{.mark} a [fractured]{.mark} or
fragmented Sino-Russian Arctic [relationship does not exist.]{.mark}
Russia and China's [Arctic]{.mark} [relationship]{.mark} is [not an
alliance]{.mark} -- it is driven by 'win-win' thinking. Such framing [is
extremely subjective and prone to change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite
mutually beneficial interests in the region, commercial realpolitik is
at the heart of their engagement. For now, the partnership in the Arctic
navigates existing fault lines elsewhere, such as Beijing's failure to
acknowledge Russia's annexation of Crimea and Moscow's nonalignment in
the developing India--China conflict. Sino-Russian mutually beneficial
cooperation and engagement within the Russian Arctic Zone is not a
Sino-Russian alliance in the Arctic. In a somewhat Confucius-informed
position, Beijing wants to 'seek harmony and keep differences' when it
comes to engagement with Russia in the Arctic. Both countries will
remain engaged proactively and collaboratively across industrialisation
projects, diplomatic relations and various commercial dealings in the
Russian Arctic Zone. [But [when]{.mark} this 'win-win'
[situation]{.mark} [sours]{.mark}, Western Arctic states may indeed be
faced with [another Arctic security threat]{.mark} -- a
[conflict]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [Russia and China]{.mark} in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

ChinaPower Project,

Russia\'s war in Ukraine has cast a spotlight on the China-Russia
relationship. On February 4, 2022, just weeks before Russia\'s invasion
of Ukraine, President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin met and
issued a historic joint statement which stated their bilateral
relationship has \"no limits\" and that \"there are no \'forbidden\'
areas of cooperation\" between them. The two countries have indeed
significantly strengthened their relationship in recent years. Chinese
President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin enjoy close
working relations, which drives high-level cooperation. The two sides
also cooperate based on shared threat perceptions that the United States
and its allies seek to encircle and undermine them. Close military ties
and complementary economic dynamics help cement their relationship[. Yet
the [China-Russia relationship]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [complex]{.mark} and
comes [with costs]{.mark} for both sides.]{.underline} Leaders in
Beijing and Moscow appear to have assessed for now that the benefits
outweigh the costs, but that [calculus could chang]{.underline}e. In the
sections that follow, this ChinaPower feature analyzes [three key
[weaknesses]{.mark} of the relationship: [Historical and structural
factors]{.mark} [engender]{.mark} strategic [mistrust]{.mark} between
Beijing and Moscow; Russian [stagnation]{.mark} [renders]{.mark}
[Moscow]{.mark} a [less useful partner]{.mark} and contributes to a
growing power asymmetry; and [Russian military aggression]{.mark} sparks
[blowback for China a]{.mark}nd exacerbates Russia\'s
stagnation]{.underline}. Historical and Structural Factors Create
Strategic Mistrust Despite the strengthening of relations between
Beijing and Moscow in recent years, considerable strategic mistrust
exists between the two countries. [Chinese strategic mistrust stems
partly from the checkered history between the two
countries]{.underline}, which saw the [more powerful Russian Empire and
the Soviet Union take advantage of a weaker China]{.underline}. For
Russia\'s part, enduring structural factors-especially geography-stoke
fears that an [[increasingly powerful China]{.mark} may
[encroach]{.mark} on its interests [and]{.mark} [take advantage of
Russia]{.mark}n weaknesses]{.underline}. Moscow\'s concerns are
heightened by a strategic culture that harbors deep-seated great power
ambitions and chafes at being the junior partner in a relationship with
China. The present close relationship between China and Russia is a
notable deviation from history, which often witnessed the more powerful
neighbor taking advantage of the weaker country. In the 19th century,
the Russian Empire was party to many of the \"unequal treaties\" that
compelled China to hand over territory, money, and other spoils to
European powers. The 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 Treaty of Peking were
particularly harsh, forcing China to forfeit approximately 1 million
square kilometers (km) of territory to the Russian Empire. In the
mid-20th century, tensions between the newly founded People\'s Republic
of China and the Soviet Union devolved into the Sino-Soviet Split, which
lasted into the 1980s. The two countries\' longstanding border disputes
were a central flashpoint of the period. In 1969, hostility along the
border escalated to nuclear posturing and nearly resulted in large-scale
conflict between the two communist powers. Moscow also pressed Beijing
on other fronts, including criticizing Chinese repression in Tibet and
indirectly calling for Tibet\'s independence. Following the
normalization of Sino-Soviet relations in 1989, China and Russia
officially resolved their longstanding border disputes and Moscow began
expressing support or neutrality on sensitive Chinese issues like
Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Nevertheless[, Moscow\'s decades of
antagonism have remained a source of suspicion within
China]{.underline}. The unequal treaties that Russia was partner to were
central to China\'s \"century of humiliation,\" which the Chinese
Communist Party still draws on as a source of nationalistic energy. It
is impossible to de-link Russia from that legacy[. Many Chinese thinkers
still view these historic incidents as indicators of Russia\'s
willingness to use its power to pursue its own interests at China\'s
expense, and many in [China]{.mark} continue to be [wary]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [Russia\'s]{.mark} reliability as a [strategic
partner]{.mark}]{.underline}. On top of historical factors, enduring
structural factors generate friction in the relationship-chief among
them, geography. China\'s immediate proximity to Russia leads to
competitive dynamics in areas along their shared periphery, most notably
in the Russian Far East, Central Asia, and the Arctic. More
fundamentally, China\'s immense size and power make it a daunting
neighbor in the event that relations between Beijing and Moscow sour.
Following the opening of the China-Russia border in 1988, China\'s
presence in the Russian Far East emerged as an irritant in the
relationship. As China\'s economy grew, Chinese workers and businesses
flowed into the region. Many went into the agricultural sector. [One
study found that in 2018 Chinese citizens owned or leased approximately
350,000 hectares (3,500 square km) of farming land in the Russian Far
East-approximately 16 percent of the total land used for
agriculture]{.underline}. The presence of Chinese workers in the region
stirred up anger among some Russians, [with many complaining about
Chinese workers stealing Russian jobs and exploiting Russian natural
resource]{.underline}s. Concerns about China\'s presence in the Russian
Far East have waned somewhat in recent years, and China is broadly
popular among the Russian public. According to the Pew Research Center,
71 percent of Russians said they viewed China positively in 2019-the
highest of all 35 countries surveyed. However, China\'s presence in the
Russia Far East continues to provoke negative views. A 2017 poll by the
Russian Academy of Sciences found that more than one in three Russians
view China\'s increasing presence as \"expansion.\" Half of respondents
said [that China threatened Russia\'s territorial integrity, and
one-third of them believed that China\'s policies endanger their
country\'s economic development]{.underline}. This negative local
sentiment has at times stalled planned Chinese investment projects, such
as a Chinese-funded water bottling plant in the Irkutsk region, which
was suspended after local protests in 2019. China and Russia also face
competitive dynamics in their shared backyard of Central Asia, which
could become a source of tensions. Moscow remains influential in the
five former Soviet states of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) and it considers the region to
be within its \"privileged sphere of influence.\" Russia has thus far
been willing to accept China\'s activities there, for example, by
cooperating with Beijing in the Chinese-led Shanghai Cooperation
Organization and by not opposing China\'s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
ambitions. Russia currently even reaps some benefits out of China\'s
presence in the region: China\'s considerable economic engagement there
helps to facilitate regional stability and development allowing Russia
to focus more on shaping military and security dynamics. However, China
is stepping up its security and economic footprint in Central Asia in
ways that may increasingly be perceived through a competitive lens by
Moscow. In 2021, it was announced that China would construct an outpost
for police special forces in Tajikistan. While it appears that Chinese
forces will not be stationed there, China\'s move was seen by some as an
encroachment on Russia\'s ties to Tajikistan, which is a member of the
Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (a rough analogue to
NATO comprising former Soviet states) and home to Russia\'s largest
overseas military base. On the economic front, China has rapidly
replaced Russia as the larger trading partner of all five Central Asian
states. In 2000, Chinese imports from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan totaled less than one-fourth of
Russian imports, but by 2020 they were more than double Russia\'s
imports. China\'s exports have ballooned as well, with \$19.3 billion
worth of Chinese goods destined for Central Asia in 2020. As this trend
continues, it threatens to undercut Russia\'s ability to wield its
economic influence in the region. [Finally, [Russia]{.mark} is [wary of
Chinese ambitions]{.mark} in the Arctic, where Moscow has significant
interests.]{.underline} Approximately one-fifth of Russia\'s expansive
territory is located within the Arctic Circle. This area encompasses
more than 24,000 km of shoreline and is home to some 2.5 million people.
Under Vladimir Putin, Russia has made the Arctic a key region of focus,
including reviving Russia\'s military presence there. In recent years,
Russia has refurbished 50 previously closed Soviet-era military posts,
including 13 air bases, 10 radar stations, 20 border outposts, and 10
integrated emergency rescue stations. Despite lacking territory in the
arctic, China has pushed to establish itself as a \"near-Arctic state,\"
and in a 2018 white paper on the arctic, China put forward a vision for
building a \"Polar Silk Road\" to complement the broader BRI. China and
Russia have so far cooperated on energy and infrastructure projects in
the region, but there have been considerable setbacks. [Russia initially
opposed allowing China onto the multilateral Arctic Council as an
observer, and Moscow continues to be suspicious of Beijing\'s strategic
goals in the region.]{.underline} In 2012, Russia blocked Chinese
research vessels from conducting surveys along the Northern Sea Route,
and in 2020 Russian prosecutors charged a prominent Russian Arctic
expert with treason for passing classified information to China. In the
future, Russia may feel the need to push back against China\'s growing
influence in these areas. In the spirit of the Chinese idiom
\"‰∏ÄÂ±±‰∏çÂÆπ‰∫åËôé\" (one mountain cannot tolerate two tigers), China
may also assert its interests over Russia\'s as it pushes to shore up
its regional and global power. So far, China and Russia have managed to
compartmentalize competition in these areas, and they have succeeded in
strengthening relations despite their turbulent history. Yet the [[seeds
of mistrust]{.mark} remain planted within the relationship and could
someday [grow into a major impediment]{.mark} in the
relationship.]{.underline} Russian Stagnation Exacerbates Tensions China
and Russia have long sought to cast themselves as equal partners, but
this narrative is increasingly difficult to maintain given the growing
power asymmetry between the two. As Russia stagnates or even declines,
and as China continues to bolster its national power, Russia is poised
to be a less useful partner to China in countering Western influence.
C[hina\'s growing lead over Russia could also exacerbate existing
tensions and mistrust between Beijing and Moscow if Russia feels it is
being disrespected or treated as a junior partne]{.underline}r.However,
given [Russian perceptions of itself and its history as a great power,
Russia may be unwilling to have a close partnership with China that is
not built on equality. There are signs that some [Russians are already
wary of being treated poorly by China]{.mark}.]{.underline} In March
2022, former Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev described China\'s
leaders as \"ruthless businessmen\" and said \"China will never take
\[Putin\] as an equal partner or even as ally.\" [[If Russian
leaders]{.mark} feel that they are being taken [advantage of or treated
like the junior partner]{.mark}, they may [ultimately]{.mark} choose to
cool relations with Beijing and [limit]{.mark} [cooperation]{.mark}.
Russia may even assess at some point that the power imbalance has become
so severe that China poses a [direct challenge or threat to
Russia]{.mark}, which could [result in a full pivot away from
China]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Compounding these issues is Russia\'s persistent military aggression on
the world stage. [[Russia\'s]{.mark} numerous military
interventions-especially its o[ngoing]{.mark} war in
[Ukraine]{.mark}-have [created]{.mark} [political and economic blowback
for China]{.mark}.]{.underline} On top of that, Russia\'s war [in
[Ukraine]{.mark} has [weakened]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark}, diminishing its
utility to China and further [exacerbating]{.mark} the widening [power
gap]{.mark} between China and Russia]{.underline}.. Chinese strategists
and analysts have contrasted Russia\'s willingness to use force with
China\'s forbearance. Some have described Vladimir Putin as a
\"revolutionary\" seeking to overturn the existing international order
and noted that Moscow\'s goals render it more willing to use violence to
advance its interests. By comparison, Chinese scholars have
characterized China as having the more modest goal of rendering the
existing international system more conducive to China\'s growth and
development-and therefore less willing to resort to force. [Russia\'s
willingness to use aggression has put China in politically awkward
situations.]{.underline} Chinese officials have long described
territorial integrity and non-interference in the internal affairs of
other countries as a cornerstone of China\'s foreign policy. [Chinese
officials and propaganda outlets frequently try to cast China as having
never invaded or bullied other countries. Russia\'s repeated invasions
of other countries run in direct opposition to those principles.
[China]{.mark} has at times gone so far as to subtly [criticize Russian
military aggression]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2008, then-spokesman of
China\'s foreign ministry Qin Gang stated that China \"expressed
concern\" over the situation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia during
Russia\'s war in Georgia. Mostly, China has sought to neither criticize
nor directly side with Russia. Beijing, for example, has not recognized
the independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from Georgia; nor has it
recognized the breakaway Ukrainian territories of Donetsk and Luhansk or
Russian claims over Crimea. In the case of Russia\'s 2022 invasion of
Ukraine, Xi Jinping has gone farther by publicly legitimizing Russian
security and sovereignty concern, but this has come at a political and
diplomatic cost. In the United Nations, China was compelled to make
unpopular votes that placed it among a small minority of countries. In
March 2022, for example, 141 countries voted in the UN General Assembly
in favor of a resolution condemning Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, while
China joined a minority of 34 other countries in abstaining. [Russia\'s
war in Ukraine has also propelled a rapid and significant improvement in
relations between the United States and its European allies as they
collectively counter Russia, and it has strengthened perceived fault
lines between democracies and autocracies-unwelcome outcomes for
China]{.underline}. In the United States, China\'s tacit support for
Russia has brought a spotlight to the China-Russia relationship, with 62
percent of people polled describing it as posing \"a very serious
problem.\" In Europe, a key economic partner for [China where Beijing
has been pushing to gain influence, [countries]{.mark} there have
[toughened their stance]{.mark} [toward]{.mark}
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}. In April and May, China sent an envoy to
meet with officials in eight central and eastern European countries with
the hopes of improving ties, but China\'s outreach was rebuffed. The war
in Ukraine has also inflicted economic pain on China. The global rise in
energy prices sparked by the war led oil prices to spike in China-much
as they did in other countries. [According to Chinese customs data, the
price of China\'s crude oil imports rose to RMB 5,070 per metric ton in
April 2022-up 37 percent from January 2022]{.underline}. China and its
companies are also facing the added burden of navigating Western
sanctions on Russia. While China has not joined U.S. and European
sanctions on Russia, and despite Beijing\'s calls for companies to
continue conducting business in Russia, many Chinese firms have paused
or cut operations there. This includes major Chinese tech companies like
computer-maker Lenovo, smartphone-maker Xiaomi, and drone-maker DJI. As
a result, [China\'s exports to Russia plummeted to RMB 24.1 billion in
April 2022-down 53 percent from the recent high of RMB 52 billion in
December 2021.]{.underline} Technology exports have been particularly
hard hit. In March, laptop sales to Russia were down more than 40
percent and smartphones down by nearly two-thirds. In late May, five
Chinese firms were told to stop construction of a Chinese-Russian
liquefied natural gas pipeline, a key node in China\'s \"Polar Silk
Road,\" to avoid EU sanctions. In addition to causing political and
economic blowback, Russia\'s wars threaten to further diminish Russia\'s
utility as a strategic partner for China. Russia\'s 2014 invasion of
Ukraine created significant setbacks for the Russian military and its
supporting defense industry. The war disrupted Russia\'s ability to
deliver weapons systems to Vietnam-one of Russia\'s top arm export
markets-which in turn contributed to a broader decline in Russia\'s arms
exports in recent years. During the 2016-2021 period, Russian arms sales
around the world declined 24 percent over the previous six-year period,
and its share of global arms sales fell from 25 percent to 19 percent.
[This undercut a notable benefit of the [China-Russia]{.mark}
relationship for Beijing, wherein Russia could wield its prominence as
an arms exporter to influence countries-like Vietnam-with which China
has [tense relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia\'s latest invasion of
Ukraine has had far more drastic consequences for Russia. Western
sanctions have had substantial impacts on the Russian [economy.
[Russia\'s]{.mark} [GDP]{.mark} is expected to shrink by 8.5 percent in
2022 and unemployment is expected to rise substantially. Russia\'s
military losses in Ukraine are also staggering.]{.underline} In June
2022, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley
stated that the Russian military had already lost roughly 20 to 30
percent of its armored force in Ukraine, which he described as a
\"huge\" and \"significant\" loss. For now, Beijing has chosen to double
down on its relationship with Russia despite these drawbacks. These
developments nevertheless represent meaningful headaches for China.
[Russia is [stagnating]{.mark}, and perhaps in outright decline, which
[could ultimately exacerbate]{.mark} existing [mistrust]{.mark} between
Beijing and Moscow and [potentially render Russia of far less strategic
value to China]{.mark}]{.underline}

### A2 Arctic K2 Heg

#### Arctic not key to US heg- greater threat to US heg in Ukraine rather than Arctic

"The Threat to American Hegemony Is Real,"
https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-western-hegemony-vulnerable-to-russian-chinese-coordinated-challenge-by-michael-ignatieff-2024-03)

The post-1945 world order -- written into international law, ratified by
the United Nations, and kept in place by the balance of nuclear terror
among major powers -- is hanging by a thread. [The United States is
divided against itself and stretched to the limits of its
capabilities.]{.underline} Europe is waking up to the possibility that,
come November, America may no longer fulfill its collective-defense
obligations under Article 5 of the NATO treaty. Faced with this new
uncertainty, Europe is cranking up its defense production, and European
politicians are screwing up the courage to persuade their electorates
that they will need to ante up 2% of their GDP to guarantee their own
safety. The Western alliance doesn't just face the challenge of doubling
down on defense while maintaining unity across the Atlantic. It also now
faces an "axis of resistance" that might be tempted to threaten Western
hegemony with a simultaneous, coordinated challenge. The lynchpin of
this axis is the Russia-China "no-limits" partnership. While the Chinese
supply the Russians with advanced circuitry for their weapons systems,
Russian President Vladimir Putin ships them cheap oil. Together they
have imposed autocratic rule over most of Eurasia. [If Ukraine's
exhausted defenders are forced to concede Russian sovereignty over
Crimea and the Donbas region, the Eurasian axis of dictators will have
succeeded in changing a European land frontier by force]{.underline}.
Achieving this will threaten every state on the edge of Eurasia: Taiwan,
the Baltic countries, and even Poland. Both dictatorial regimes will use
their vetoes on the UN Security Council to ratify conquest, effectively
consigning the UN Charter to history's dustbin. This partnership of
dictators works in tandem with a cluster of rights-abusing renegades,
led by Iran and North Korea. The North Koreans provide Putin with
artillery shells while plotting to invade the rest of their peninsula.
The Iranians manufacture the drones that terrorize Ukrainians in their
trenches. Meanwhile, Iran's proxies -- Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis
-- are helping Russia and China by tying down America and Israel.
[Unless the US can force Israel into a long-term ceasefire, it will find
itself struggling to control conflicts on three fronts (Asia, Europe,
and the Middle East).]{.underline} Not even a country that outspends its
rivals on defense by two to one can maintain a war footing
simultaneously across so many theaters. The idea that democracies around
the world will join up with America and Europe against the authoritarian
threat seems like an illusion. Instead of joining with the embattled
democracies of the Global North, the rising democracies of the Global
South -- Brazil, India, and South Africa -- seem unembarrassed to be
aligning with regimes that rely on mass repression, the cantonment of
entire populations (the Uighurs in China), and shameless murder (Navalny
being only the most recent example). To be sure, [the authoritarian axis
currently is united only by what it opposes: American
power]{.underline}. It is otherwise divided by its ultimate interests.
The Chinese, for example, cannot be overjoyed that the Houthis are
blocking freight traffic through the Red Sea. The world's second most
powerful economy doesn't have all that much in common with an
impoverished Muslim resistance army or with theocratic Iran. Moreover,
both Russia and China remain parasitic beneficiaries of a global economy
that is sustained by US alliances and deterrence. That is why they still
hesitate to challenge the hegemon too directly. However, like sharks,
they smell blood in the water. They have not only survived US sanctions
but continued to prosper, replacing their dependence on embargoed
markets with new markets in Latin America, Asia, and India. [Both Russia
and China have discovered that American control of the global economy is
not what it once was.]{.underline} This discovery of American weakness
might tempt them to risk a joint military challenge. As matters stand,
US diplomacy and deterrence have successfully kept the axis divided. CIA
Director William Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are
keeping the channels open to China. Blowback American strikes against
Iran have apparently convinced the theocrats to rein in Hezbollah and
the militias in Iraq -- though not the Houthis, whom nobody seems able
to control. It doesn't take strategic genius to see the opportunity
China and Russia might be contemplating. If they decided to mount an
overt challenge to the American order -- for example, with a
coordinated, simultaneous offensive against Ukraine and Taiwan -- the US
would struggle to rush weapons and technology into the breach. Nuclear
weapons would not necessarily deter China and Russia from risking a
coordinated attempt to take Taiwan and the rest of Ukraine. All parties
would pay a horrendous price, but [Russia has shown what it is willing
to expend in Ukraine]{.underline}, [and both China and Russia may
believe that there will never be a more opportune moment to overthrow
American hegemony.]{.underline}

Presence Will Strengthen American Deterrence,"

[[Naval forward presence]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [the practice of
maintaining combat-credible naval forces]{.underline} [worldwide [to
deter adversaries]{.mark}, reassure allies,]{.underline} respond to
crises, [and perform]{.underline} constabulary [functions for the global
commons]{.underline} --- [has dominated U.S. foreign policy since the
1990s]{.underline}. Few critics dare question it. [The concept's
supporters]{.underline} --- under the illusion that "credibility
anywhere is credibility everywhere" --- darkly [warn that rolling back
presence operations will embolden America's adversaries.]{.underline}

[The opposite is true]{.underline}. [A navy tasked to do all these
things [cannot]{.mark} do them all well. Rolling back presence will
[strengthen]{.mark}, not weaken, [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
too long, short-term thinking has taken priority over managing long-term
risk. It's time to flip the script. [Readiness for great-power
conflict]{.underline} [--- peace through strength rather than global
policing --- should once again be America's primary grand-strategic
aim.]{.underline}

Too Busy, and Too Small

Few Americans appreciate just how busy their navy is. [At any time, over
one-third of U.S. [Navy]{.mark} ships are deployed --- the greatest
proportion in history]{.underline}. Sometimes these ships are training
with allies and partners, buttressing American power. Sometimes they are
responding to crises where legitimate American interests are at stake
and force may be necessary. But many of the Navy's overseas duties are
unrelated to coercion or deterrence, including humanitarian operations,
freedom of navigation transits, "maritime security" patrols in far-flung
regions, or various missions under the nebulous banner of norms
enforcement.

As my research has shown, [these [operations come at a cost]{.mark}:
They [have shrunk and]{.mark} [weakened the]{.mark} U.S. Navy's [surface
fleet]{.mark} to a shadow of its former self]{.underline}. The reasons
lie in politics, poor strategic foresight, and bureaucracy. While
critics usually describe the problem as a mismatch between operational
"demand" and the "supply" of ships, this mismatch is itself a symptom of
an underlying national confusion about the purpose of the Navy itself.
The hard truth is that stale ideas about America's proper role in the
world have outlived the geopolitical circumstances in which they
germinated.

After the Soviet Union dissolved, U.S. policymakers saw a new world
marked by brush-fire conflicts, civil wars, and economic dislocation due
to globalization. Global policing, albeit under more the palatable terms
like "engagement" or "liberal internationalism," became the dominant
foreign policy consensus. To offer flexibility for these brush fires,
the Navy designed its fleet around carrier strike groups and amphibious
readiness groups. The Navy made this case --- that an uncertain world
required presence, and presence required carriers, amphibious ships, and
supporting multi-mission combatants --- in its own planning documents,
and led a public relations campaign to this effect. The 1993 Bottom-Up
Review (the Department of Defense's seminal assessment of required force
structure for the post-Cold War era), under a section entitled "naval
presence," explicitly stated that naval forward presence would require
more large-deck ships than the Navy would need if it used the same
force-planning metric as the other services (the two "major regional
contingency" standard). In other words, "presence" as an idea was good
for the Navy's bottom line --- at first.

Circumstances soon changed. First, the large, exquisite ships that
carrier strike groups and amphibious readiness groups required were
expensive. Over time, this drove up customer costs and lifecycle costs,
and inhibited alternative force structures and platform choices, because
the coalition of contractors and policymakers benefiting from the
presence-oriented force structure objected to changes. Accordingly, with
time, the Navy purchased fewer vessels overall, and the fleet began to
shrink.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military's geographic combatant commanders ---
empowered a few years earlier under the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act ---
began demanding surface ships for nearly every crisis that arose in
their theaters. Policymakers, too, grew accustomed to "showing the
flag." Sending a carrier strike group to a hot zone was appealing, as it
avoided the political risk and financial cost of overseas basing and was
an easy way to ratchet diplomatic pressure up and down.

In essence, the Navy did its job too well: It designed a fleet and
promoted a concept for operating it that policymakers and combatant
commanders found addictive. So, throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s,
the surface fleet got busier and busier while becoming smaller and
smaller.

Like a car, a ship can only be run so hard until it becomes too
expensive to maintain. As the Navy overused its ships, they retired
early. Other ships picked up their slack and were then overused
themselves. To support the rising tempo of operations, the Navy
repeatedly delayed maintenance on ships. America's shipyards, which
required predictable contracts to remain economically viable, bled
skilled laborers, driving up costs in an endless cycle.

The result was that the surface fleet shrank from over 400 ships in 1994
to an all-time-low of 272 vessels during the Obama administration
(today, it sits at around 300). Even with an ongoing multi-decade,
multi-billion-dollar investment in the nation's public shipyards, the
U.S. Navy will not clear its maintenance backlogs until at least 2040.
Even the chief of naval operations recently acknowledged that the fleet
will not grow any time soon. [Wargames indicate that,]{.underline} [were
the United States to fight China, the U.S. Navy might eke out a nominal
win, but one that blurs the line between victory and defeat, setting
back American military power for a generation.]{.underline}

The Readiness Trade-Off

How was all this allowed to happen?

Everyone, from the combatant commanders to the Navy, lost sight of the
trade-off between operational and structural readiness. "Operational"
readiness refers to the ability of existing military units to fight
tonight. "Structural" readiness refers to a military's ability to
generate sufficient mass for multiple rounds in a prolonged fight,
including factors like the health of the defense-industrial base. In
basic terms, an extremely high level of operational readiness is
required for global policing duties; whereas if the goal is fighting a
long war against a peer competitor, structural readiness is more
important. If resources are finite (which they always are), the two
trade off.

In brief, for three decades, [the U.S. Navy traded its [structural
readiness]{.mark}]{.underline} (for great-power conflict) [for
operational readiness]{.underline} (to support naval forward presence).
It [[burned through]{.mark} its [ships]{.mark}, and debilitated its
shipyards]{.underline}, to [make sure it could respond to whatever
policymakers wanted, whenever they wanted it, no matter how
[irrelevant]{.mark} it was [to deterrence]{.mark} and
warfighting.]{.underline}

This was not a problem in the 1990s, when the same fleet busy with
presence operations could still fight off any foreseeable challenger.
But by 2015, given the rise of China, the Navy, oversight agencies,
contracted research organizations, and think tanks were all sounding
alarms. Navy leaders begged Congress, time and again, to reduce the
frequency with which Navy ships were deployed, so that the force could
recoup its readiness.

Then came the collisions. In 2017, two U.S. Navy destroyers, in separate
incidents, crashed into commercial ships, and 17 American sailors lost
their lives. Two investigations --- Secretary of the Navy Richard V.
Spencer's Strategic Readiness Review and Chief of Naval Operations John
M. Richardson's Comprehensive Review --- offered recommendations to
restore the Navy's readiness. The Navy's highest-level investigation
even recommended "condition\[ing\] congressional and executive branch
leaders to accept that the higher cost and time to achieve established
readiness standards will mean less Navy presence worldwide." This never
happened, because Congress continued to assume the Navy could balance
both operational and structural readiness, as my research delineating
the hearings after the accidents has shown.

Legislation passed after the collisions resolved none of the Navy's
presence-induced headaches. Congress enacted reforms to restore
operational readiness but ignored the Navy's proposed reforms to improve
its structural readiness. The Strategic Readiness Review had proposed
changes to the Navy's readiness commands (such as eliminating the
so-called "Inouye Amendment") and changes to the adjudication of
combatant commanders' requests for forces. Instead, what the Navy got
was a little more officer training here, some sleep requirements for
officers there. After dipping for one year after the collisions, the
Navy's operational tempo continued its inexorable annual rise that began
in the 1990s. Presence was simply too popular an idea.

[[Shipbuilding is Not Enough]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The U.S. Navy's [readiness]{.mark} [for sustained
combat]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- and hence its ability to deter China
--- [is]{.mark} in a [catastrophic]{.mark} state]{.underline}. The Trump
administration should give the U.S. Navy a fighting chance to rebuild
itself.

It can start with the unfinished business of 2017, reforming the global
force management process (the process by which the Department of Defense
adjudicates combatant commanders' requests for military forces) to
prioritize structural readiness over emergent demands. In this process,
the service chiefs and the joint staff consider combatant commander
needs in their theaters and recommend service assets that can be made
available to them. Should a combatant commander need forces in excess of
this established allocation (an "emergent requirement"), he or she can
submit a "request for forces." The idea that the services should "just
say no" to such requests is aspirational, but difficult. Why? Because
--- as the Strategic Readiness Review noted --- the Navy has developed a
culture of meeting non-stop (presence-driven) operational demands.

As the review also points out, [the multiple [overlapping
authorities]{.mark} and the adverse growth of staffs within the Navy has
[made]{.mark} tracking the long-term effects of operations]{.underline}
[on [structural readiness a nightmare]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition,
the staff of the chief of naval operations, located in the Pentagon,
appears biased towards operational demands and can lose sight of
long-term readiness. The problem is not that the Navy lacks input in
global force management, but that the Navy still does not "say no"
enough. To resolve this, the review recommended establishing the initial
force availability as the "maximum supportable peacetime force," such
that any further combatant commander requests for forces can only be met
with forces moved from other theaters. This is, in essence, a hard cap
on what the Navy can do, ensuring that unready units are never sent to
meet the latest and greatest combatant commander request.

[But [emergent demands aside]{.mark}]{.underline}, [Navy [operational
tempo will still remain too high to]{.mark} [restore]{.mark} structural
[readiness]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [Trump]{.underline} administration
[should]{.underline} therefore [reevaluate]{.underline} [the idea of
naval forward presence itself]{.underline}: the notion that America's
Navy is foremost a provider of global goods, and a global policeman,
rather than the preeminent warfighting force of a maritime power whose
primary goals ought to be deterring --- and if necessary, winning --- [a
great-power conflict.]{.underline}

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should give up its quest
for [command of the maritime commons]{.mark} in the Western Pacific. The
struggle [is based on a false premise]{.mark} --- that if the United
States loses command of the seas, China will step in the fill the
vacuum]{.underline}. In fact, [even if the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [loses command of the maritime commons, [China is
not positioned to gain it]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, by positioning
China as an existential threat, the United States is boxing itself in
politically. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [courts
disaster]{.underline} [when it overextends itself by seeking military
primacy in the region. There is one fundamental reason: the tyranny of
distance]{.underline}. The [[maritime]{.underline}]{.mark} nature of
American [[power is a double-edged sword]{.underline}]{.mark},
specifically when it comes to its competition with China. [American
command over the maritime commons allows the U.S. military to project
power globally, but [when]{.mark} that [power is projected at]{.mark} a
[great distance]{.mark} from U.S. shores, as in the Western Pacific,
[U.S. forces are]{.mark} particularly [vulnerable]{.mark} to measures
designed to raise the costs of access]{.underline}. First, [a strategy
of maintaining command of the maritime commons in the face of
anti-access measures exposes U.S. dependence on allied territory to
support deployed forces]{.underline} through basing, infrastructure, and
logistics. Second, [[as the costs]{.mark} and risks [of maintaining
access increase,]{.mark} the [asymmetrical stakes become more
constraining]{.mark} for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[than for China. [Overcommitment]{.mark}]{.underline} has historically
been endemic to U.S. grand strategy, but it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
especially [[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark} [now that China is capable
of inflicting heavy costs upon the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Instead, the United States should, together with
its allies and partners, focus on denying China command of the Pacific
maritime commons. [[It is]{.mark} cheaper and [easier to deny command of
the seas than to exercise it]{.mark}]{.underline}. If China cannot gain
command of the seas, [[the]{.mark} Western [Pacific will remain a
contested environment]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [one [that China cannot
break out]{.mark} [of]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[China would]{.mark} either
be forced to [accept the s]{.mark}tatus [quo or]{.mark} make a first
move in which it [overextend]{.mark}s itself.]{.underline} While
[[giving up command of the seas]{.underline}]{.mark} may seem
unpalatable, it [[need not be fatal]{.mark} to the U]{.underline}nited

[[Russia's policies]{.mark} for the polar regions overlap and are

militarized postures in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It assesses
the [[North]{.mark}]{.underline} and South Poles [as [potential
theatre]{.mark}s [for military activity and geopolitical
confrontation]{.mark},]{.underline} and recommends ways to mitigate
risks for the US, NATO and their allies. \<\<image omitted\>\> The
central Arctic, the NSR and the North [Pole [Russia seeks to protect the
NSR and]{.underline}]{.mark} [to [defend]{.mark} North Pole approaches
[from the perceived threat of NATO's expansion]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Such ambitions go against the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and
could also put NATO and US interests at risk. Geographically, Russia's
central Arctic comprises the long stretch of the AZRF along the NSR and
the four main archipelagos (Novaya Zemlya, Franz Josef Land, Severnaya
Zemlya and the New Siberian Islands) from the Kara Sea to the Laptev Sea
and to the East Siberian Sea. This vast area is also the gateway for
Russia's access to the North Pole. Russia's military posture in the
central Arctic The central Arctic constitutes a soft underbelly where
Russia's sense of military vulnerability is strongest. Here, [[the
Kremlin has two key priorities]{.mark}: 1) [controlling]{.mark} and
protecting [the NSR; and]{.mark} 2) [defending Russia's North Pole
approaches]{.mark}. Controlling and protecting the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline} [The administration, development and protection of
the NSR and its economic assets are of paramount importance to the
Kremlin. [Russia]{.mark} wants to ensure its full and comprehensive
control over the access and passage of surface vessels, as well as to
[regulate any 'foreign activity']{.mark} in the sea and air approaches
of the central Arctic.]{.underline} Control over access explains why
[[Moscow]{.mark} is seeking to strengthen rules on transit through the
NSR and is [taking a militarized view of]{.mark} traffic passing through
it.]{.underline} This stance is linked to recent legislation regarding
management of the NSR, which aims to give it exceptional legal status.
Provisions that have been proposed to date42 effectively turn Russia's
central Arctic into a 'hugely expansive area' under Russian control and
no longer a maritime area managed through the UN Convention on the Law
of the Sea (UNCLOS) under freedom of navigation principles and norms.43
Control over access explains why [Moscow is seeking to strengthen rules
on transit through [the N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea [R]{.mark}oute and
is taking a militarized view of traffic passing through it.]{.underline}
[For almost a decade, [Moscow]{.mark} has been [strengthening]{.mark}
its [operational control]{.mark} over passage through the NSR. A list of
stringent rules and regulations seek to restrict access, passage and
navigation of foreign-flagged vessels in the NSR. Passage through the
NSR for foreign flags also entails heavy fees, tolls and bureaucracy --
these rules greatly benefit internal lobbies and vested
interests,]{.underline} most notably including the sole operator of the
NSR, Rosatom.44 Such ['rules' are clearly in violation of UNCLOS
provisions on freedom of navigation and 'innocent
passage']{.underline}.45 Yet, [Moscow justifies]{.underline} them by
keeping a unique interpretation of Article 234 of UNCLOS, also known as
the '[Ice clause'.]{.underline} Article 234 refers to the right of a
coastal state to increase its control over 'ice-covered areas within the
limits of the exclusive economic zone'.46 Russia's extension of its
control over the surface of ice-covered waters along the AZRF relies
solely on its own interpretation of Article 234 by introducing exclusive
and discriminatory regulations that go against UNCLOS. Finally, recent
constitutional changes giving primacy to national law over international
law47further create the impression that the [NSR is indeed under Russian
domestic regulatory control]{.underline}. Defending North Pole
approaches [[Russia has a militarized understanding of access to and
passage through the NSR]{.mark}.]{.underline} Its military presence in
the central Arctic enhances perimeter defence and the defence of
approaches from both sides of the AZRF, giving Russia increased
situational and domain awareness over the NSR.48 [Russia's attitude
towards the central Arctic and the North Pole explains the
[multiplication]{.mark} and hardening [of]{.mark} air-defence
[capabilities]{.mark}, [early-warning systems]{.mark} and
domain-awareness capabilities deployed on the archipelagos [across the
NSR]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia's disparate network of forward bases,
airfields and outposts there represents a mix of civilian and military
installations for search and rescue (SAR) operations, maritime domain
awareness (MDA) and border protection.49 Currently, priority is given to
strengthening existing infrastructure, rather than developing new
installations.50 In line with the Basic Principles of Russian Federation
State Policy in the Arctic to 2035,51official rhetoric claims that the
network of civilian and military installations aims to 'respond promptly
to possible threats to the safety of navigation'52 and to 'increase the
security' of the NSR.53 However, for over a decade, the refurbishment
and building of military infrastructure along the NSR has been 'designed
primarily for performing air-space defence functions'.54 Installations
were built with off-the-shelf military hardware to save costs and time,
but their primary function is to support Northern and Pacific Fleet
operations in terms of transit, protection, logistics and resupply along
the lifelines of the AZRF. [Russia has also been laying trans-Arctic
fibre-optic cables along the NSR to link military installations across
the]{.underline} AZRF55 -- [which could be used to monitor submarine
activity]{.underline}56 -- and has recently deployed Arktika-M
remote-sensing satellites to enhance domain awareness.57 The NSR is only
navigable seasonally, not year-round, and does not represent a
convenient transit route for military vessels. This means passage
through the NSR still largely has an expeditionary purpose for Russian
fleets. Nevertheless, training increasingly focuses on the protection of
NSR assets,58 including amphibious assault landings,59 and on
controlling its airspace. Finally, [[control over the NSR gives Russia
increased defence]{.mark} in depth [against]{.mark} a multitude of
[perceived threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.60 With an emphasis on air
defence,61 early warning and domain awareness, [Russia seeks to defend
North Pole approaches from US strategic bomber overflights across the
North Pole, from US ballistic-missile defence in the
region]{.underline}62 [and from increased subsurface
presence.]{.underline} [Chokepoints and flashpoints of tension in the
central Arctic Russia's posture and deployments in the central Arctic
have the direct consequence of slowly shaping a security dilemma for
Russia over the continued management of the NSR under current
provisions, as well as putting NATO and US interests at
risk.]{.underline} Upholding the 'Ice clause' As climate change
continues to adversely affect the AZRF, Moscow will find it increasingly
hard to justify the exceptionality of the domestic status of the NSR
under UNCLOS Article 234. Indeed, seasonal sea-ice reduction across the
AZRF will make the 'Ice clause' irrelevant, therefore undermining
Russia's interpretation of the NSR's status and exclusionary
navigational rules. The Kremlin might fear increasing challenges to
Russia's exclusive passage and internal navigation rights by the US and
NATO. Recent strategic documents denounce attempts by foreign states to
'revise basic provisions of international treaties'63 and to 'use
climate change as a pretext to limit and contain Russian development and
control' over the AZRF.64 'Great power' propaganda pieces are regularly
published in the Russian press, claiming that the US or NATO will soon
challenge Russia's interpretation of the 'Ice clause' by conducting
freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) through the NSR, with the
ambition to 'storm' the NSR65 or even to 'privatize' the Arctic.[66 [The
Kremlin]{.underline} ]{.mark}[might [fear]{.mark} increasing [challenges
to Russia's]{.mark} [exclusive]{.mark} passage and internal navigation
[rights by the US]{.mark} and NATO. This situation would reportedly
allow NATO (and the US in particular) to test innocent passage/freedom
of navigation under international maritime law through surface or
submarine deployments]{.underline} (see Chapter 6). FONOP concerns are
particularly prevalent with regard to the Kara Strait in the European
Arctic, as well as the Laptev and Sannikov Straits by the New Siberian
Islands.67 Risks for NATO and US regional installations [[Russia's
posture and aggressive rhetoric over the NSR]{.mark} are [creating risks
for]{.mark} NATO and [US installations]{.mark} in the
region,]{.underline} as well as in the North Atlantic SLOC and the GIUK
and GIN gaps. Indeed, according to defence minister Sergei Shoigu,
[Russia's [main objective is 'to not let \[the Americans\] into our
Arctic']{.mark}]{.underline}.68 Russia creates risks for NATO and US
assets primarily through its air coverage in the central Arctic,
especially with aviation groups69 and naval aviation,70 hypersonic
delivery systems,71 naval coastal infrastructure,72 anti-submarine
warfare (ASW) and electronic warfare capabilities.73 Russia is currently
strengthening its air superiority assets (mostly Su-34
fighters/bombers74 and MiG-31 interceptors) and its air defence
divisions across the NSR (notably the 3rd Air Defence Division in
Tiksi).75 [Russian military capabilities are an issue for US and NATO
assets]{.underline} at the Thule air base in northwest Greenland (which
is within reach for Russian combat aircraft),76 the US Eielson Air Force
base in Alaska, the US naval air station at Keflavik in Iceland and the
Bodø air station in Norway, among others. Furthermore, [the deployment
of the Sopka-2 radar complex is a critical piece of [Russia's
surveillance architecture]{.mark} in the central Arctic region, enabling

In addition to the many other benefits already described in this report,
the [ACRL]{.underline} offers an opportunity to develop a new
rail-tourism experience, which has proven appeal in this fast-growing
travel market. In so doing, it [could also encourage additional
overnight stays in the Yukon and incubate other attractions highlighting
the region's]{.underline} gold rush history, [First Nations' culture and
environmental features]{.underline}. The ACRL has the [added benefit of
stimulating economic and industrial activity as well as population
growth but]{.underline}, at the same time, [neutralizing the GHG
impacts]{.underline} of this increased activity [because of its ability
to lower]{.underline} GHG [emissions]{.underline} for the transport of
both inbound and outbound goods compared to currently used transport
modes. The [ACRL also offers the opportunity to minimize intrusion and
disruption into previously undeveloped areas because of its reduced
footprint and controlled access that deters public trespass and
preserves]{.underline} the [territorial sovereignty and environmental
values]{.underline} of these virgin territories. [Construction of the
ACRL would also contribute a valuable contingency measure in the event
of a natural disaster and bolster national security by providing an
alternative supply route in the case that the Port of
Anchorage]{.underline}, which [is]{.underline} the primary entry point
for the vast majority of all the State's supplies, and other ports were
[unavailable]{.underline}. [The ACRL is the missing link in the North
American rail grid]{.underline}. Its [construction will provide
valuable]{.underline} additional east-west rail [capacity and tidewater
access]{.underline} to the Pacific [for]{.underline} both Canada and
[the US]{.underline}, hugely benefitting not only the Yukon and Eastern
Alaska regions, [into which it will introduce rail transport for the
first time]{.underline}, but throughout both countries. The economic
benefits of its construction are consistent with the Canadian
government's desire to promote Northern development and comparable in
significance as those of Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880's and the
St. Lawrence Seaway in the 1950's. The [enormous job and wage creation
and tax revenue benefits from construction alone will create an
unprecedented stimulus of Northern development]{.underline}. More
importantly, [the on-going presence of the ACRL will transform the
economies of]{.underline} the Yukon, Northeast BC and Eastern [Alaska,
fundamentally changing and improving the cost structure and economic
viability of its mining, forestry and oil and gas industries, fueling
employment and population growth and lowering cost of
living]{.underline}. At the same time, [opening access and expanding
this internal market within North America, while increasing access and
shortening transport time for exports to/from Asia]{.underline}, will
[have far reaching national economic benefits in]{.underline} both
Canada and [the US.]{.underline} [Existence of the ACRL
will]{.underline} also reduce the cost and [improve]{.underline} the
economic [viability of Alaska North Slope development, an Alberta rail
extension and]{.underline} potential [development of the Crest iron
ore]{.underline} deposit in the northeast Yukon. In addition, [it
constitutes a valuable transportation and supply line contingency should
the Port of Anchorage and other Alaskan ports be
unavailable]{.underline} for any reason. As [the ACRL]{.underline} will
generate new economic, industrial and population growth, it [should
result in higher overall transport demand]{.underline} and
rationalization between modes - [not a loss of business and revenue in
the other transport modes]{.underline} or from existing West Coast
ports. Also, [because rail generates lower GHG emissions than currently
used transport modes, the impact of newly generated growth should be
neutralized]{.underline}. In addition, the [ACRL offers a reduced
footprint and controlled access minimizing intrusion and disruption to
previously undeveloped areas]{.underline}. [Investment in the ACRL now
is extremely timely as its ability to stimulate mining exploration,
development and production]{.underline} in this minerally rich region,
[directly responds to the expected exponential growth in demand for
metals, critical]{.underline} and strategic [minerals and rare earths in
development of low-carbon technologies]{.underline} as well as other
high-tech manufacturing [and military uses, which]{.underline} are
currently lacking in North America and [have no viable
substitute.]{.underline}

Washington, DC, United States -- [Experts]{.underline} and interested
parties [discussed the practicality of building a tunnel across the
Bering Strait at a meeting in Washington, DC]{.underline}, on May 21,
2024, hosted by UPF and The Washington Times Foundation. [Despite
current conflicts between the United States and Russia, participants
agreed that a transportation link across the strait that divides these
two countries could ease tensions between them, and in the
world.]{.underline} The "International Highway New York to London: The
Bering Strait Connector" was held at the Washington Times building, with
70 attendees in person and 50 participating through Zoom, including from
Alaska and Russia. Ms. Kaeleigh Moffitt, congressional liaison for UPF,
did an excellent job as the emcee. Dr. Michael Jenkins, president of
UPF-International and The Washington Times Foundation, opened the
meeting with words of welcome to everyone present and watching online.
He summed up the history of [UPF's]{.underline} interest in the Bering
Strait project, and its [ongoing commitment to this]{.underline} and
other [projects]{.underline} that connect the world and pursue peaceful
development. At the conclusion of his remarks, Dr. Jenkins showed a
video about the tunnel project that was created by the Russian Academy
of Sciences and the Russian Ministry of Economic Development, revealing
[Russia's enthusiasm for the project.]{.underline} Dr. Charles S. Yang
is chairman of UPF-International and also the [World Peace Road
Foundation]{.underline}, which [advocates for]{.underline} both [the
Bering Strait tunnel and a tunnel between Korea and Japan]{.underline}.
He described these as [two unfinished links that prevent land access
between every part of the world]{.underline}. He also explained Rev. Sun
Myung Moon's vision for an International Highway that included the two
tunnel projects, which he called "the new Silk Road." Dr. Yang cited
three factors required for the success of the Bering Strait project: (1)
political commitment from the leaders of the United States and Russia;
(2) economic feasibility and investment capital from many governments;
and (3) the sharing of the most advanced tunneling technology. The next
speaker was Mr. Scott Spencer from Intercontinental Railway, a
non-profit NGO in the United States and Russia, committed to connecting
North America, Russia and Asia by rail. Mr. Spencer is chief project
advisor to the group, with the mission of pulling together the people
and resources to build the Bering Strait tunnel and the railway
connectors across the wilderness regions of Canada and Siberia. As a
consultant to many railway companies, he usually speaks about the
engineering, operating and environmental challenges of building an
8,000-kilometer railroad linking the United States and Canada with
Russia and China via an 85-kilometer tunnel under the Bering Strait.
Instead, he [emphasized the urgency of undertaking this project now,
saying it could be part of a mutually beneficial diplomatic initiative
to end the war between Ukraine and Russia. Creating an opportunity for
peace is the best way to avoid a wider war]{.underline}, he said, adding
that [waiting for a war to go away is not an option.]{.underline} He
encouraged participants to take action to save lives and secure the
peace. Mr. Mead Treadwell was lieutenant governor of Alaska from 2010 to
2014; today he runs his own consultancy called Treadwell Development. He
has long worked to develop ties with Russia, as his closest neighbor in
the Arctic region. "That includes [strengthening economic, personal, and
cultural relations with Russia,"]{.underline} he said. "[In the Arctic,
many Russian citizens are not just neighbors to Alaskans, they
are]{.underline} brothers, cousins, grandparents, [family. Whether our
nations are friends or adversaries]{.underline} -- and we've seen both,
sadly, several times in our lives -- it's important to remember that we
are all people, [we want peace]{.underline}, and we love our children
too." Dr. Victor Razbegin is a [Russian scientist and government
official, director of the Interdepartmental Centre for Integrated
Regional Transport Projects]{.underline}. He is also [co-founder of
Intercontinental Railway,]{.underline} serving on the Russia end of that
project. Dr. Razbegin spoke, through Zoom, on "[Russia's Readiness and
Willingness" to build the Bering Strait connector]{.underline}. He is a
[vocal advocate for the tunnel as a way to promote peace and reduce
tensions between Russia and the United States.]{.underline} Mr. Eugene
Harnett is [executive director of UPF-Alaska]{.underline}, and
[chief-of-staff for a member of the Alaska State House of
Representative]{.underline}s. He [spoke of the need for a think tank
devoted to the Bering Strait connector to Russia,]{.underline} a place
where people could meet, and the best ideas could be distilled and put
into practice. "The think tank would be the yeast to make the dough
rise," he said. Mr. [Louis Cerny]{.underline} has been involved in
railways since the early 1960s, and is the former executive director of
the American Railway Engineering Association. His [specialty is
designing large-scale steel bridges, tunnels and railroad
system]{.underline}s. He understands the technical challenges of
building railroads in the most harsh conditions, such as permafrost and
extremely cold weather. He said the [cost of the Bering Strait tunnel is
estimated at around US\$120 billion. If the tunnel and connecting
railways require 15 years to complete, the total cost will be less than
1 percent of the combined military spending of the United States and
Russia during that time]{.underline}. He also explained that [a tunnel
would greatly reduce the need for new port facilities and ocean
shipping]{.underline}, so there could be opposition from container ship
companies and contractors who build ports. Of course, the first
condition for the project to go forward is reasonably good relations
between the United States and Russia. He pointed out that the direction
of history can shift quickly, so [project plans should be developed and
ready to take advantage of]{.underline} any favorable turns in
[U.S.-Russia relations.]{.underline} Dr. Masoyoshi Kajikuri serves as
chairman of the Japan-Korea Tunnel Project. He sent a video in which he
explained the vision of an undersea passage connecting Japan and South
Korea with North Korea and the rest of the world. He showed the
600-meter exploration tunnel that has been constructed, and [practical
plans for its completion.]{.underline}

Of course, beyond the economic advantages, [there are clear strategic,
political, and cultural benefits for a Bering Strait rail
route]{.underline}. Nonetheless, ideally, [building an Alaska Canada
rail link for its own sake should be strongly encouraged because it
would become the foundation]{.underline} on the North American side [for
an eventual Bering Strait tunnel.]{.underline} While advocates of an
Alaska Canada rail link do not have a Bering Strait crossing in mind,
[building connecting track from the Lower 48 to the existing Alaska
Railway]{.underline}, with its current northern terminus in Fairbanks
(and eastward extension to Delta Junction), [accomplishes a vital leg of
the necessary North American infrastructure for a Bering Strait
crossing]{.underline}. Other than the grand project of building the
tunnel, which would necessarily be a U.S.-Russian joint venture, Alaska
would also need to lay about 600 miles of track from Fairbanks to Nome
(or Wales), on the westernmost Seward Peninsula. Although a huge rail
project in itself, [there ought to be considerably more incentive if the
Alaska Canada rail link were already built.]{.underline} Thus, [on the
North American side, in an ideal sense, there are three major steps to
building the infrastructure culminating in a Bering Strait crossing:
Construction of an Alaska Canada rail link from New Hazelton, B.C. (one
possible terminus), to the Fairbanks/Delta Junction area in Alaska;
Construction of an extension of the Alaska Railroad from Fairbanks to
Nome or Wales; Construction of a tunnel underneath the Bering Strait
connecting to Cape Dezhnev in Russia. Once an A]{.underline}laska
[C]{.underline}anada [r]{.underline}ail [l]{.underline}ink [is made, the
longest stretch of infrastructure toward the Bering Strait would be
built, making a]{.underline} Bering Strait [tunnel and the additional
required track to Fairbanks that much less daunting]{.underline} to
complete. Indeed, [early use of a completed A]{.underline}laska
[C]{.underline}anada [R]{.underline}ail [L]{.underline}ink [would give
clues to how much more attractive a land route to Asia would
be]{.underline} versus a sea route from off-loaded rail freight
embarking from Anchorage or another northern port. *Figure 7: British
Columbia coal and Yukon iron ore would account for more than three
quarters of a total 50 million tons per year potential volume in an
ACRL. Less than one quarter of the total volume is the balance of
Alaska, Yukon and Asian traffic.* An additional incentive for an ACRL
are the restrictions on shipping between Alaska and the Lower 48 states
by the federal Jones Act, which prohibits "cabotage" (sailing from one
U.S. port to another to deliver freight or passengers) by foreign
vessels. The Jones Act prohibits foreign-built ships and crews from
engaging in trade from port to port in the United States, although rare
exemptions are granted. [Intracoastal shipping from Alaska to U.S. West
Coast ports is overall uneconomical and costly because it requires
American vessels and crews for domestic
shipping.]{.underline}[\[]{.underline}9\] For this reason, at a 2005
conference, then Governor of Alaska Frank Murkowski strongly promoted
connecting Alaska to the Lower 48 by a rail corridor through Canada
because it is politically impossible (due to opposition of maritime
labor unions) for Congress to modify the Jones Act. Relevant to an ACRL,
it should also be noted that [Canada, since 2006, has had its Asia
Pacific Gateway and Corridor Initiativ]{.underline}e (APGCI) program,
[which aims to turn the country's west coast ports into a major entry
point for Asian goods into North America]{.underline}. Last November,
China agreed to participate in the program. The project would be
beneficial to China as Prince Rupert port, north of Vancouver, is 1,100
miles closer to Shanghai than any other North American port. [Chinese
goods could be off-loaded and sorted at the strategic inland port of
Prince George, the largest city in northern B.C.]{.underline} about 800
miles from the coast, [for rail transport into the American heartland in
100 hours or less]{.underline}. The Chinese have welcomed Canada's
upgrading of its ports, as well as the construction of oil pipelines to
the ports and the modification of railways to the hinterland and
Canada-U.S. border.\[10\]

[The New Silk Road can become the World Land-Bridge by means of the
construction of a Bering Strait rail connection,]{.underline} uniting
the two great landmasses of the planet, Eurasia and the Americas, just
as the original Silk Road bridged the East and West. Imagine boarding a
magnetically-levitated train in downtown Paris or Berlin, travelling at
250 mph across the steppes of Siberia, through an underwater Bering
Strait tunnel across more than 50 miles of ocean, emerging on the other
side in Alaska, and ultimately arriving in New York City! Not only would
[the completion of the Bering Strait rail]{.underline} connection
[connect]{.underline} these [two great landmasses and place them in
direct economic, cultural, and commercial communication with each other,
but it would]{.underline} definitively [shift the center of global
civilization away from the trans-Atlantic and towards the Pacific
basin,]{.underline} as well as [**opening up the Arctic**, mankind's
modern-day frontier, **to human exploration and
development**]{.underline}. Overcoming the engineering challenges
involved in bridging the gap between Alaska and Siberia would represent
a feat of human accomplishment. By means of 55 miles of tunnels under
the Bering Strait, the transportation systems of Eurasia and the
Americas could be linked, allowing the development of two of the most
neglected regions of the planet. Some 2,000 miles of new railway in
Eurasia and more than 600 miles in North America will need to be built,
under rugged northern conditions on both continents, to complete the
connection with the transport systems which already exist. [This vital
transportation corridor would be more than merely a means to get from
point A to point B; it will open up vast potential for mineral and raw
materials development in the Far North]{.underline}. It is not merely a
high-speed replacement for shipping across the Pacific; it is an
[opportunity to develop this severely underdeveloped region of the U.S.,
Canada, and Russia, allowing its fallow riches to benefit the people of
the planet, including through]{.underline} the development of [new
cities and research centers in this region]{.underline}, unlocking a new
opportunity for human discovery and endeavor. LaRouche's movement has
campaigned for a Bering Strait connection since the 1970s. This project
served as a critical link in a global chain of development projects
envisioned by the LaRouche movement at the time, to be the [foundation
of a new international economic order]{.underline} and financed through
investments by the International Development Bank and related
institutions of international credit. With the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1990, Lyndon and Helga LaRouche's vision of a Productive
Triangle to integrate the economies of Western and Eastern Europe was
expanded to become the Eurasian LandBridge, spanning the entirety of the
Eurasian territory. The LaRouche movement campaigned vigorously to
[bring this perspective of mutually beneficial development to the
governments of every major country on the planet, as the foundation for
a new strategic order of peace through progress, as opposed to a
perpetuation of geopolitical war.]{.underline} During the 1990s, a
number of critical studies were commissioned to explore the possibility
of extending this Eurasian Land-Bridge idea to encompass the Bering
Strait connection, bridging into the Americas, including most notably a
1995 visionary over-view study co-authored by American engineer Hal B.H.
Cooper, Jr. and Professor Sergei A. Bykadorov of the Siberian State
Academy of Transport in Novosibirsk. In the recent decade, additional
plans for this project have received renewed interest. An April 2007
conference convened by Russia's Council for the Study of Productive
Forces titled "Megaprojects of Russia's East: A Transcontinental
Eurasia-America Transport Link via the Bering Strait" called for
detailed feasibility studies of the project. The conference was
addressed by numerous leading Russian academicians, as well as by the
former Governor of Alaska, Walter Hickel, who delivered a speech titled
"A Transcontinental Eurasia-American Transport Link via the Bering
Strait: Megaprojects as the Alternative to War" in which he called [the
Bering Strait connection "a project that may change the world, a project
of joining creative energies, **replacing missile defense systems** with
a territory of international cooperation."]{.underline}

Strait Tunnel Possible With \'Existing Technology\'" *Engineering

The [proposed 64-mile long tunnel would intersect with two islands to
allow for ventilation and construction access.]{.underline} A rail
crossing of the 51-mile-wide Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia is
certainly not a new dream project---the idea dates back as far as the
late 1800s. Since then, numerous railroad magnates, engineers and even
heads of state have proposed bridge and tunnel schemes to link the Asian
and North American continents. In recent years, [a tunnel running
underneath the 161-ft-deep channel has been the preferred option. In
2011, the Russian government was rumored to have greenlit \$65 billion
in funding for a tunnel]{.underline} as part of a plan to extend its
rail network to the eastern tip of Siberia by 2030. While no specific
details for the tunnel have surfaced, the rail extension has been
constructed as far east as the city of Yakutsk. A 64-mile tunnel
[proposal]{.underline} is curren[tly being promoted by InterBering LLC,
an Anchorage-based]{.underline} private [firm that spearheads investment
in the crossing]{.underline}. The tunnel would intersect with two
islands in the center of the strait to allow for ventilation and
construction access. [Existing]{.underline} tunnel boring machine
[technology]{.underline} [would be employed to construct
twin]{.underline} 16.5-meter-dia [tunnels for cargo and passenger rail,
plus a]{.underline} 7-meter-dia [emergency]{.underline} access [and
maintenance tunnel]{.underline} in between. InterBering founder Fyodor
Soloview, a dual citizen of Russia and the U.S., says that [while
tunneling costs could approach \$35 billion, it will actually be much
cheaper and easier to construct than]{.underline} the [overland rail
networks that approach the tunnel]{.underline}. The challenges of
constructing thousands of miles of rail over permafrost could result in
a price tag that exceeds \$1.3 trillion, he says. Some cost savings
could come from utilizing approximately 55 million cu yd of spoils from
the tunnels---mostly basaltic gravel---as railway base. But for now, the
[main impediment to the crossing project isn't cost or engineering,
but]{.underline} the [strained relations between the U.S. and Russia
over]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline} crisis, says Soloview. He is
currently [lobbying the Russian government on the economic benefits of
the tunnel plan and the opportunity it presents to improve relations
with the U.S.]{.underline} In May, Chinese media outlets reported that
[China was pursuing its own tunnel scheme.]{.underline} Rail expert Wang
Mengshu, a professor with the Beijing Jiaotong University\'s School of
Civil Engineering, was quoted in the Beijing Times as saying that
[Chinese officials were considering the construction of a high-speed
rail line connecting China and the U.S.]{.underline}, via nearly 8,100
miles of track also passing through Siberia and Canada. As part of the
plan, an approximately 120-mile tunnel would be built using existing
technology underneath the strait. Critics question the economic
viability of any Bering Strait crossing, saying that it's unclear that
there would be any time or cost savings over existing shipping or
passenger options. [However, on Oct. 14, China agreed to invest \$10
billion to develop and build the first high-speed rail line in
Russia.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} 478-mi-[route from Moscow to
Kazan could signal the first step in China's larger rail
ambitions.]{.underline}

[Bering Strait tunnel directly impacts the United States, Canada and
Russia, and indirectly their neighbors, China, Mongolia, the two Koreas,
Japan, and]{.underline} even [Mexico/Central America.]{.underline}
Construction of a Bering Strait tunnel accompanied by extension of
American-Canadian and Russian rail lines [would have a dramatic impact
on future economic development in eastern Siberia, Alaska
and]{.underline} the [Canad]{.underline}i[a]{.underline}n northwest,
somewhat [akin to the Transcontinental Railroad]{.underline} in the
American West in the mid-19th century. Such a project would also [serve
to solidify U.S.-Russian relations over the long-term and expand
bilateral cooperation. China, as well, stands to be a primary
beneficiary, as both its finance and labor would be important, if not
vital, for the project.]{.underline} Figure 2: Screen shot from the
Discovery Channel video, Mega Engineering: Building a Transcontinental
Tunnel (2009). Figure 3: A map of Canada's existing rail corridors
connecting to the U.S. rail corridor along the Mississippi River. First,
[West Coast American and Canadian ports are highly congested, and a rail
link to Eurasia would not only reduce that congestion but vastly
increase North American--Eurasian trade.]{.underline} Secondly,
[completed rail link]{.underline}s across Alaska and through the
Canadian West, connecting to the Lower 48 U.S. states, [would have a
highly beneficial impact on Alaska, western Canada, and the U.S. Pacific
Northwest.]{.underline} Thirdly, [eastern Siberia, one of the most
resource-rich regions of the world, is exceedingly under-populated;
constructing rail]{.underline} from the Trans-Siberian Railway (TSR) or
from Yakutsk to the Bering Strait [would invigorate (and populate) this
region.]{.underline} The [most common refrain one hears about a proposed
Bering Strait project is not that it is technologically
unfeasible]{.underline} to construct a tunnel -- [because it is
feasible]{.underline} -- [but that it is prohibitively expensive with
insufficient economic return in a very under-populated area. However,
these arguments]{.underline} oftentimes [lose sight of the unique nature
of this project]{.underline}, and one must not rush to judgment.
[Consider]{.underline} the following: 1. [The tunnel would connect
several continents, even hemispheres, not just two islands or an island
with the mainland]{.underline}: North and South America (the Americas or
Western Hemisphere) with Europe and Asia (Eurasia). [This is far more
significant than connecting Europe with an island which was very
accessible without the]{.underline} Channel tunnel (much of the debate
over the [Chunnel]{.underline} was more about keeping Britain separate
from Europe rather than the economics of the project). Thus,
[the]{.underline} frequently-made [Chunnel comparison is]{.underline} in
fact [not]{.underline} very [relevant]{.underline}. 2. [The requirement
for the extensive infrastructure to access a Bering Strait
tunnel]{.underline} from both continents [exists no matter what, but
creation of access routes to the tunnel also serves to open the
currently isolated areas of the far north of North America and the
Russian Far East]{.underline}. The alternative is no access and no
development, which -- over the long run -- is not economically
appealing. 3. More importantly, [the tunnel must be viewed as a passage
point between the continents, rather than merely a means of local
development for areas with small populations]{.underline}. The tunnel
would create the linkage of a vast interior transport network that would
make possible commercial (including passenger) rail transport from
cities such as Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and Mexico City to
Moscow, Beijing, Mumbai, Berlin, Paris, London, etc. 4. [A Bering Strait
rail tunnel would have to compete against the alternatives]{.underline},
[mainly]{.underline}, ocean-going [shipping. Yet, there are countries
and vast regions which are far from any ports but could have direct rail
access to North America via a Bering Strait crossing.]{.underline} In
the end, [a great deal of economic stimulus over the long run would
result from that.]{.underline} 5. The [projected costs]{.underline} of
the project [seem prohibitively large, but only when seen in
isolation.]{.underline} [Governments spend staggering sums with zero, or
negative, economic returns]{.underline}. The current annual U.S.
military budget is in excess of \$685 billion (and [over \$1.1 trillion
has been spent since 2001 fighting wars in Afghanistan and
Iraq]{.underline}). [One may ask where is the economic payoff in that,
yet it is considered necessary for America's security.]{.underline} [The
issue is really one of world vision and political will, rather than
simply a cost/benefit analysis]{.underline}. Clearly, [the Bering Strait
project]{.underline} is about much more than economics. It [can be
articulated as a global investment in peace and mutual security that
would bring clear-cut long-term benefits at a cost certainly far less
than conducting wars to maintain
security.]{.underline}[\[5\]]{.underline}

U.S. President Donald [Trump's]{.underline} decision to [approve a rail
link between Canada and Alaska]{.underline} could open up an export
route to Asia for Alberta's struggling oil sands producers. The
presidential permit, announced in a tweet late on Friday, will [push
forward a \$17 billion project to build a rail line]{.underline} between
Fort McMurray, in the heart of Alberta's oil sands, and Delta Junction
in Alaska, according to Alaska -- Alberta Railway Development Corp., or
A2A, the company behind the project. Canada's oil industry has struggled
for years with a lack of enough pipeline infrastructure to ship its
crude, with projects like the Keystone XL stalled for more than a
decade. "[Rail has played an essential role for industry in reaching
existing markets,]{.underline} particularly given the lack of adequate
pipeline capacity," Ben Brunnen, a vice president at the Canadian
Association of Petroleum Producers, said in an email. "[Greater market
access shows investors that there is a path to growth."]{.underline} The
company said in December that it could begin presenting its proposed
rail link to potential shippers by early 2021 to seek commitments. An
email to A2A on Monday wasn't immediately returned. [Alberta's
government welcomes the U.S. presidential permit for the
project]{.underline}, Sonya Savage, [the province's energy minister,
said]{.underline} in a tweet. "[We support the development of trade
corridors that can unlock new markets."]{.underline} The rail link could
serve as an alternative way for oil sands producers to sell into the
Asian market, allowing the industry to diversify its customer base away
from the U.S., which currently buys nearly all of Canada's oil exports.
A planned expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline to Vancouver is
currently under construction, but the project has faced years of delays
and fierce opposition from some residents of British Columbia, who see
it as a threat to the environment.

[Diversifying trade strengthens the economy, reduces dependence on

businesses can grow faster, create more jobs, and develop innovative

The trade war has served as a wake-up call for Canada, which now faces
some dire economic problems given its reliance on the once-reliable
United States. [Canada will need to get its economic house in order.
That means regulatory reform, cutting internal trade
barriers]{.underline} (which are a significant economic drag) and
[diversifying market opportunities]{.underline} to the EU and
Asia-Pacific. Cutting interprovincial trade barriers, which add between
7.8 and 14.5 percent to the price of goods and services in Canada, could
go a long way to offsetting the added costs of tariffs. PPF Fellow
Trevor Tombe has estimated that removing inter-provincial trade barriers
could give Canada a \$1.6-billion boost annually. And the International
Monetary Fund estimates that eliminating internal trade barriers could
boost Canada's productivity by 3.8 percent. Canada could also
[leverage]{.underline} its [significant energy and mining assets to
drive growth]{.underline} and investment (this is the focus of the new
phase of PPF's Energy Future Forum). As PPF has noted, there are
currently 340 energy and 138 mining projects, with a combined value of
\$627 billion, that are planned or under construction in Canada.
[Accelerating]{.underline} these [projects could drive]{.underline}
economic growth, [energy security and cleantech innovation, while
meeting growing consumer and industrial energy demand.]{.underline} On
the energy front, the trade war has made clear just how much [the energy
sector revolves around north-south trade.]{.underline} A big question
now is [whether Canada can open east-west energy gateways]{.underline}.
The Energy East pipeline --- proposed in 2013 to take Alberta crude to
Canada's east coast --- was deemed too costly and unnecessary at the
time. The idea has been floated again by some premiers, but major cost
and regulatory hurdles remain. "[If we want to stop being so reliant on
a single trading partner, we've got to]{.underline} take down internal
trade barriers between Canadian provinces, [start looking at how we can
do major nation-building projects to our east and west
coast,]{.underline}" said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith last month.

Out of the first ministers\' meeting in Saskatoon, expectations were
high that Prime Minister Mark Carney would release a list of
nation-building projects that his government would prioritize. He
didn\'t. However, Carney and Canada\'s premiers gave examples that could
qualify for federal support and potentially be expedited for completion.
The [Carney government intends to introduce legislation aimed to help
identify and fast-track projects deemed in the national
interest.]{.underline} The Liberals campaigned on making final decisions
on projects within a two-year timeline, rather than the five years
previously used. Here\'s a look at some projects that could be sped up.
You\'ve likely heard of Energy East, the planned but never built bitumen
pipeline from Alberta to New Brunswick. Nova Scotia\'s Wind West aims to
send renewable electricity from the East Coast westward. With the help
of offshore wind turbines, Premier Tim Houston is pitching a project
that he says could generate enough electricity to power 27 per cent of
the country\'s needs. \"I support the [prime minister\'s vision in
making Canada an energy superpower]{.underline},\" Houston said in a
video posted to social media. \"Wind West could fuel battery plants, AI
data centres, industries of the future. And it would transform our
economy.\" Houston told CBC\'s Power and Politics that he\'s looking to
the federal government to support \"an investment in transmission\" to
connect Atlantic Canada\'s grids to the rest of the country. \"We\'d be
looking for the federal government to support us on a pathway. \[That\]
could be a [national energy corridor]{.underline} with those
transmission lines,\" Houston told host David Cochrane. \"And these are
mostly cables for our wind energy.\" New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt
said her province could become a hub that connects electricity from
Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia to the rest of Canada
and the United States. Through new transmission connections known as
interties, Holt said Atlantic provinces could sell their power across
North America. Grays Bay port and road This project has been described
as a \"subway line\" that could offer Nunavut easier access to its
resource-rich areas and offer western provinces a direct link to the
Northwest Passage. A subsidiary of the region\'s Kitikmeot Inuit
Association is proposing to build a deepwater port on Nunavut\'s
mainland in the Coronation Gulf. To access that port, a 230-kilometre
all-weather road would need to be constructed across tundra, muskeg and
waterways without interfering with the sensitive permafrost. The thick
layer of frozen soil is prone to melt when disturbed through road
construction. A potential road would connect to Jericho Station, home to
a defunct diamond mine, before continuing to a 600-kilometre winter road
to Yellowknife. An all-season road could also eventually replace that
ice road, which is closed most of the year. The Grays Bay port could
handle large cargo ships capable of loading and transporting materials
from future critical mineral mines, both in the Northwest Territories
and Nunavut. Local hunters and others, though, have raised concerns
about the massive project\'s impact on the endangered Dolphin and Union
caribou herd. Port of Churchill. Another [potential hub for critical
minerals and fossil fuel exports]{.underline} could be through the
expansion of the Port of Churchill. The [existing port]{.underline}, via
the Arctic Gateway railway system, [promotes itself as the shortest link
from the Prairies to the Atlantic Ocean. It offers access to the Arctic,
Europe, the Middle East, Africa and South America.]{.underline} In
August 2024, the port announced it had shipped its first critical
mineral shipment --- zinc concentrate --- to Belgium. Manitoba Premier
Wab Kinew stated in a letter to Carney that the province is seeking
investments in icebreakers to expand the shipping season through Hudson
Bay and for new \"energy generation and transmission to power the
project.\"

TORONTO (AP) --- Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said late [Sunday
trade talks with U.S. have resumed after Canada rescinded its plan to
tax U.S. technology firms]{.underline}. U.S. President Donald Trump said
Friday that he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to
continue with its tax on technology firms, which he called "a direct and
blatant attack on our country." The Canadian government said "in
anticipation" of a trade deal "Canada would rescind" the Digital Serves
Tax. The tax was set to go into effect Monday. Carney and Trump spoke on
the phone Sunday, and Carney's office said they agreed to resume
negotiations. "Today's announcement will support a resumption of
negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month's
G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis," Carney said in a statement. [Carney
visited Trump in May at the White House, where he was polite but
firm.]{.underline} Trump traveled to Canada for the G7 summit in
Alberta, where [Carney said that Canada and the U.S. had set a 30-day
deadline for trade talks.]{.underline} Trump, in a post on his social
media network last Friday, said Canada had informed the U.S. that it was
sticking to its plan to impose the digital services tax, which applies
to Canadian and foreign businesses that engage with online users in
Canada. The digital services tax was due to hit companies including
Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from
Canadian users. It would have applied retroactively, leaving U.S.
companies with a \$2 billion U.S. bill due at the end of the month.
Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in
Montreal, called [Carney's retreat a "clear victory" for
Trump]{.underline}. "At some point this [move might have become
necessary in the context of Canada-US trade negotiations]{.underline}
themselves but [Prime Minister Carney acted now to appease President
Trump]{.underline} and have him agree to simply resume these
negotiations, which is a [clear victory for]{.underline} both [the White
House]{.underline} and big tech," Béland said. He said [it makes Carney
look vulnerable]{.underline} to President Trump's outbursts. "President
Trump forced PM Carney to do exactly what big tech wanted. U.S. tech
executive will be very happy with this outcome," Béland said. Canadian
Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne also spoke with U.S.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday. "Rescinding the digital
services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security
relationship with the United States to make vital progress," Canadian
Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said in a statement.
Trump's announcement Friday was the latest swerve in the trade war he's
launched since taking office for a second term in January. [Progress
with Canada has been a roller coaste]{.underline}r, starting with the
U.S. president poking at the nation's northern neighbor and repeatedly
suggesting it would be absorbed as a U.S. state. Canada and the U.S.
have been discussing easing a series of steep tariffs Trump imposed on
goods from America's neighbor. Trump has imposed 50% tariffs on steel
and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. He is also charging a 10%
tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July
9, after the 90-day negotiating period he set would expire. Canada and
Mexico face separate tariffs of as much as 25% that Trump put into place
under the auspices of stopping fentanyl smuggling, though some products
are still protected under the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement signed
during Trump's first term.

[Canada is developing a high-speed rail network in the Toronto-Quebec
City corridor]{.underline}. This transformative rail network will span
approximately 1,000 km and reach speeds of up to 300 km/hour, with stops
in Toronto, Peterborough, Ottawa, Montréal, Laval, Trois-Rivières, and
Quebec City. Once operational, current travel times will be slashed in
half -- getting you from Montréal to Toronto in three hours. The
official name of this high-speed rail service will be Alto. [A country
that believes in itself invests in its people and
infrastructure]{.underline}. As [Canada's largest ever infrastructure
project]{.underline}, high-speed [rail will turbocharge the Canadian
economy]{.underline} -- boosting GDP by up to \$35 billion annually,
creating over 51,000 good-paying jobs during construction, and unlocking

reliable option to get around, we will save Canadians time when they
travel, boost tourism, connect communities, and spur affordable housing
development across the region. Cadence has been carefully selected to
not only co-design and build, but also to finance, operate, and maintain
this project. Cadence is a consortium of world-renowned companies with
expertise and know-how in the design, development, and operation of
large-scale transportation infrastructure. Cadence will collaborate and
support Alto as work begins on detailed design, Indigenous
consultations, land acquisition, and the environmental assessments
necessary to enable construction. This decision is the result of years
of careful deliberations and de-risking, as well as [meaningful
investment from the Government of Canada.]{.underline} Canada is the

discussing its implementation.]{.underline} However, the idea of
bridging the Bering Strait is not a new one---it is an idea which has
captured imaginations for over 150 years. Even before Russia sold Alaska
to the United States in 1867, there was support in the U.S. Congress for
a telegraph line across the Bering Strait to Russia, which had been a
key U.S. ally against the British during the Civil War. And later, in
1890, as Russia was initiating the construction of the Trans-Siberian
Railway modeled on the Transcontinental Railroad of Abraham Lincoln,
Governor William Gilpin of the Colorado Territory promoted a "grand
scheme of a Cosmopolitan railway," reaching "north and west across the
Strait of Bering; and across Siberia, to connect with the railways of
Europe and all of the world." [While Russia and China are reviving
discussions of completing this long overdue project, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has yet to reciprocate and
take the neccesary steps to turn this great vision into a
reality.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline} is [considering plans to build a high-speed railway
line to the US,]{.underline} the country\'s official media reported on
Thursday. The proposed [line would begin in north-east China and run up
through Siberia, pass through a tunnel underneath the Pacific Ocean then
cut through Alaska and Canada to reach the continental US,]{.underline}
according to a report in the state-run Beijing Times newspaper.
[Crossing the Bering Strait in between Russia and Alaska would
require]{.underline} about 200km (125 miles) of [undersea
tunnel]{.underline}, the paper said, citing Wang Mengshu, a railway
expert at the Chinese Academy of Engineering. \"Right now
[we\'re]{.underline} already [in discussions]{.underline}. [Russia has
already been thinking about this for many years]{.underline},\" Wang
said. The project -- nicknamed the \"China-Russia-Canada-America\" line
-- would run for 13,000km, about 3,000km further than the Trans-Siberian
Railway. [The entire trip would take two days]{.underline}, with the
train travelling at an average of 350km/h (220mph). The reported plans
leave ample room for skepticism. No other Chinese railway experts have
come out in support of the proposed project. Whether the government has
consulted Russia, the US or Canada is also unclear. The Bering Strait
tunnel alone would require an unprecedented feat of engineering -- it
would be the world\'s longest undersea tunnel -- four times the length
of the Channel Tunnel. According to the state-run China Daily, [the
tunnel technology is \"already in place\" and will be used to build a
high-speed railway between the south-east province of Fujian and
Taiwan.]{.underline} \"The [project will be funded and constructed by
China]{.underline},\" it said. \"The details of this project are yet to
be finalised.\" The Beijing Times listed [the China-US line as one of
four international high-speed rail projects currently in the
works.]{.underline} The first is a line that would run from London via
Paris, Berlin, Warsaw, Kiev and Moscow, where it would split into two
routes, one of which would run to China through Kazakhstan and the other
through eastern Siberia. The second line would begin in the far-western
Chinese city of Urumqi and then run through Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Iran and Turkey to Germany. The third would begin in the
south-western city of Kunming and end in Singapore. The routes are under
various stages of planning and development, the paper said. Wang was not
immediately available for comment. A man who picked up the phone at his
office said he was traveling and would not respond to interview
requests.\" This article was amended on Friday 9 May 2014. The project
is nicknamed the \"China-Russia-Canada-America\" line, not the
\"China-Russia plus America line\" as we said first. This has been
corrected.

#### Russia has high interest in the project -- they'll say yes.

[Heads of states have considered for well over a century the possibility
of connecting Asia and North America across the Bering
Strait]{.underline} with a physical path. But [as technological
capabilities advance, world leaders are increasingly considering the
practicality of constructing an intercontinental railway]{.underline}
between Alaska and Siberia.1 Similar to the Chunnel in Europe, this
[proposed high-speed railway construction would]{.underline} likely
[consist of an underwater train tunnel passing across the Diomede
Islands in the Bering Strait, and]{.underline} it would [serve as
a]{.underline} potentially [sustainable means of transportation with
less overall emissions.]{.underline}2 Supporters of the railway point to
potential [economic and political benefits]{.underline}, such as
[increased access to valuable natural resources]{.underline} (including
coal, oil, and natural gas) in Siberia and Alaska.3 Additionally,
supporters highlight the [potential increased global efficiency in trade
and transportation, and increased quality of life levels for residents
in Siberia and Alaska who would have access to additional jobs, health
care, electricity, and water.]{.underline}4 The [Russian Ministry of
Transportation]{.underline} in the past [has stated that this railway is
essential to the economic future of Russia.]{.underline} 5 [Leaders in
Alaska have similarly highlighted the]{.underline} potential [railway as
"vital on both political and economic grounds"]{.underline} as [it could
place Alaska at the forefront of global development and
opportunity]{.underline}.6 For the U.S., the proposed railway would
cross more than 1,000 miles from the western area of the Seward
Peninsula (in Alaska) eastward to the existing railway in Fairbanks.7

project [is estimated at 30--35 billion dollars which would be offset in
13--15 years time]{.underline}. This project has attracted the attention
of both critics and adherents who suggest considering other projects
partaking to the connection of the two continents.

#### China has long-standing interest.

[China]{.underline} is [planning to build a train line that
would]{.underline}, in theory, [connect Beijing to the United
States.]{.underline} According to a report in the Beijing Times, citing
an expert at the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese [officials are
considering a route that would start in the country\'s northeast, thread
through eastern Siberia and cross the Bering Strait via a]{.underline}
125-mile long [underwater tunnel into Alaska.]{.underline} \"Right now
we\'re already in discussions. [Russia has already been thinking about
this for many years,]{.underline}\" says Wang Mengshu, the engineer
cited in the article. [The proposed \"China-Russia-Canada-America\" line
would be some 8,000 miles long,]{.underline} 1,800 miles longer than the
Trans-Siberian railroad. The [tunnel that the Chinese would help bore
beneath the icy seas would be four times the length of what traverses
the English Channel.]{.underline} That\'s reason enough to be skeptical
of the project, of which there are few details beyond what was
attributed to the one official cited by the state-run Beijing Times.
Meanwhile, a report in the state-run [China Daily]{.underline} insists
th[e country does have the technology and means to complete a
construction project of this scale, including another tunnel that would
link]{.underline} the Chinese [province of Fujian with nearby
Taiwan.]{.underline} In the past half decade or so, China has embarked
on an astonishing rail construction spree, laying down tens of thousands
of miles tracks and launching myriad high-speed lines. It has signaled
its intent to build a \"New Silk Road\" \-- a heavy-duty freight network
through Central Asia that would connect with Europe via rail rather than
the old caravans that once bridged West and East. A map that appeared on
Xinhua\'s news site outlines the route below, alongside a parallel
vision for a \"maritime Silk Road.\" While some of its neighbors watch
China\'s rise warily, the [main plank of Beijing\'s soft power pitch has
always been its stated desire to improve economic ties and trade with
virtually everyone]{.underline}. \"China's wisdom for building an open
world economy and open international relations is being drawn on more
and more each day,\" trumpets the Xinhua report that accompanies the map
above, according to the Diplomat. To that end, Beijing has assiduously
resurrected the narrative of the ancient Silk Road as well as given
prime billing to the tales of China\'s famed Ming dynasty treasure
fleets, which sailed all across the Indian Ocean. Seen in such grand
historic perspective, a [tunnel to Alaska doesn\'t seem too
far-fetched.]{.underline}

The most prominent plans for a Bering Strait bridge involve [three
sections -- from mainland Russia to Big Diomede (]{.underline}36.0 km),
[Big Diomede to Little Diomede]{.underline} (3.8 km), [and Little
Diomede to Wales, Alaska]{.underline} (36.8 km) according to Google
Maps. However, it is interesting to note that using these islands would
provide little benefit for a tunnel, so it would most likely be direct
from mainland Russia to mainland Alaska, 80 kilometers. In perspective,
the longest undersea tunnel currently is the Chunnel that links Britain
and France across the English Channel, of which the undersea portion is
37.9 kilometers (Cripps and Xiong). Depth is not as prominent an issue,
as the depth of the water at its greatest is about 50 meters, relatively
similar to other undersea tunnels such as the Chunnel. 2.2 Piers [The
Bering Strait is just outside of the Arctic Circle]{.underline}, and
extreme cold engulfs the region for the majority of the year. Icebergs
are present for 8 months a year. In Spring, as icebergs melt, pieces of
ice break off and create "ice flows" which are hundreds of meters wide,
flow downriver at high speeds, and can produce 5,000 tons of force
(Ricci). Additionally, profound temperature changes and extremely salty
seawater in the region creates wear and tear on the bridge. Any small
crack could become fatal. Therefore, a new design of bridgepost is
needed to ensure that the bridge can survive such forces occurring on a
regular basis. According to the documentary Extreme Engineering by the
Discovery Channel, experimentation at the Confederation Bridge (crossing
the Northumberland Strait in eastern Canada) has discovered that a cone
shaped bridgepost can use the force of the incoming iceberg to break it
apart rather than absorb the force (Bridging the Bering Strait).

### AT -- Russia/China makes it evil:

#### The project isn't controlled by Russian or Chinese funds -- the EU, Korea, Japan, and private investment will all balance.

Feasibility and Financing

Victor Razbegin, who works in the Ministry of Economic Development and
Trade's Industrial Research Department, like Governor Hickel, has been
closely involved in efforts to secure action on the Bering Strait
project, for more than a decade, as our review of its history shows (see
below). Another longtime Bering Strait tunnel enthusiast is the American
engineer Hal Cooper, whose overview of the scheme EIR published in 1994,
and whose detailed work-up of its parameters has recently drawn renewed
attention from Russian, as well as American promoters of a Bering Strait
crossing. Cooper told EIR the week of the Moscow conference, that the
push for the project may have reached "a real phase shift" now. Speaking
at the April 24 event, under big banners with maps of the
intercontinental project, Academician Granberg said that the [next step
should be design and feasibility studies for the 6,000-km
rail-road-pipeline-power corridor from Yakutsk to Fort Nelson, including
85-100 km of tunnel]{.underline} under the Bering Strait. There will
really be two tunnels, Granberg pointed out, because Big Diomede Island
(Russia) and Little Diomede Island (U.S.A.) lie close together in the
middle of the strait. Since Japan already has built 50-km underwater
tunnels between its islands, Granberg remarked, [the technologies
involved are proven ones.]{.underline} Conference participant Louis
Cerny of the American Railroad Association also presented the [technical
feasibility of the Bering Strait crossing,]{.underline} noting that [the
schedule for the project as a whole could be sped up by simultaneous
construction of its different parts. Many of the Russian speakers
referred to]{.underline} recent [government decisions, which make the
Bering Strait project a live option.]{.underline} One of these is the
Federal Target Program called "Development of the Far East and
Transbaikal Region" to 2013. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov has
been active in launching an array of measures to address the
underdevelopment and depopulation of these regions. Dr. Jonathan
Tennenbaum, a collaborator of LaRouche for many years, and a member of
the 21st Century Scientific Advisory Board, introduced LaRouche's paper
to the conference as the work of the American economist, best known in
Russia for his science of physical economy and his advocacy of basic
infrastructure projects. LaRouche's discussion of the legacy of chemist
and national economist Dmitri Mendeleyev, as well as his [relating the
cooperation of great nations on the Bering Strait project to the tasks
of war avoidance]{.underline}, were received with interest by the
Russian participants. Tennenbaum, who is known in Russia especially as a
[coauthor of]{.underline} EIR's [1997]{.underline} Special Report The
Eurasian LandBridge: [The 'New Silk Road']{.underline}---Locomotive for
Worldwide Economic Development, then elaborated the concept of
infrastructure corridors, and networks of intersecting such corridors.
Building them in the far north is a challenge for the 21st Century, he
said, which can be met by building chains of nuclear-powered cities.
U.S. work on building the nuclear-powered research town, Camp Century,
under the ice in northern Greenland in the 1960s, together with Russia's
city-building experience in Siberia, makes this a tailor-made area for
U.S.-Russian cooperation, Tennenbaum said. Maxim Bystrov, deputy head of
Russia's Federal Agency for Special Economic Zones, picked up on
LaRouche's and Tennenbaum's remarks about the enormous financial bubble
that exists today, as against the [potential for directing funds into
productive investment like these infrastructure projects. Liquidity
won't flow into long-term projects on its own]{.underline}, Bystrov
stressed. He said that [the Russian government would advocate attracting
private concessionaires for the project, rather than rely solely on
state funding from]{.underline} the [countries involved]{.underline}. At
the same time, Bystrov said that his [agency]{.underline} was [prepared
to put up \$120 million for]{.underline} the [feasibility
studies]{.underline}. Governor of Yakutia (in the Sakha Republic)
Vyacheslav Shtyrov, whose paper was read to the meeting by the region's
representative in Moscow, discussed the enormous development potential
of that East Siberian region. With a land area equal to half the size of
the lower 48 U.S. states, covering three time zones and extending to the
Arctic Coast, Yakutia's population is less than that of Rhode Island.
Shtyrov noted that "we have all of the elements of Mendeleyev's periodic
table" in Yakutia, as well as enthusiasm for Mendeleyev's ideas about
development. Contagious Optimism [News of the high-level Russian backing
for the Bering Strait tunnel project was welcomed across Eurasia, from
Sweden to Japan]{.underline}. Dagens Industrie, a [Swedish business
newspaper, reported favorably on it]{.underline} in the April 25 issue.
[German press coverage cited enthusiastic responses from China, Korea,
and Japan, including the view of]{.underline} some
[Japanese]{.underline} business circ[les that the tunnel could be built
for \$60 million per kilometer, half the price that that was cited in
Moscow.]{.underline} Germany's Spiegel Online in its coverage added
mention of an article on the project, penned by Vladimir Brezhnev, CEO
of the Russian construction firm Transstroi, in 2005 in the magazine
Tunneling and Underground Space Technology. In that article, Brezhnev
and co-authors wrote: "[Among tunnel experts, there is no doubt that the
implementation of the described tunnels is technically
feasible]{.underline}." In Denmark, where national attention has been
focussed on the Schiller Institute's program for magnetic levitation
rail infrastructure, Schiller Institute leader Tom Gillesberg pointed
out that Vitus Bering, for whom the strait is named, was a Dane in the
service of the Russian Navy, during the time of Peter the Great in the
early 18th Century. Publication of a story about the Bering Strait
project on the Saudi Arabian news website Elaph.com brought forth
contagious optimism. The report said, "The [cost of this gigantic
transport project, \$65 billion, will be quickly paid back through the
revenue, created by the transit of goods between the countries in the
region.]{.underline}" Comments on the site, from readers in Arab
countries, as well as Arab-Americans and ArabCanadians, urged the Arab
states to learn from Russia, Canada, the U.S.A., and Asia, and launch
construction of a network of railroads and bridges throughout the Arab
world, from the Persian Gulf to North Africa. In Russia itself, many
identify the Bering Strait project with LaRouche. The Bering Strait rail
line was shown on maps in EIR's 1997 Special Report on the Eurasian
Land-Bridge (see map pp. 38-39). Academician Sergei Rogov of the
Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada, and Academician Vladimir Myasnikov,
then of the Far East Institute, used reproductions of EIR's map, to
illustrate their articles on Eurasia's development potential, appearing
in major Russian publications in the late 1990s. On his return from
Moscow, Jonathan Tennenbaum reported that the conference was a central
event in a very broad ranging debate in Russia, around the absolute need
for great projects. There was extensive debate and discussion at the
Moscow event on the problem of financing the Bering Strait tunnel and
development corridor. The [deputy chairman of Russia's Federal Agency
for Special Economic Zones]{.underline}, during his presentation,
[concurred with Tennenbaum's remarks regarding the need to immediately
invest existing liquidity]{.underline}, such as the Russian government's
stabilization fund derived from oil and gas revenues, [into such big
high-technology projects of new infrastructure.]{.underline} Typical of
the Bering Strait project's reputation as LaRouche's idea, and of the
growing sense of such ideas' potential to change even the most rigid
institutional attitudes, is a Russian blogger's comment, posted April
23. With reference to a recent U.S. State Department report, which
pledged support for regime-change in the former Soviet region under the
banner of "pro-democracy" movements, the writer commented: "This I must
mentally applaud: answering the State Department's latest attack, by
proposing a gigantic, joint investment project---the dream of Lyndon
LaRouche, who advised the Democrats during the most recent Congressional
elections; and this from the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade,
no less, though it's headed by one of our dyed-in-the-wool liberals!"

[The New Silk Road can become the World Land-Bridge by means of the
construction of a Bering Strait rail connection,]{.underline} uniting
the two great landmasses of the planet, Eurasia and the Americas, just
as the original Silk Road bridged the East and West. Imagine boarding a
magnetically-levitated train in downtown Paris or Berlin, travelling at
250 mph across the steppes of Siberia, through an underwater Bering
Strait tunnel across more than 50 miles of ocean, emerging on the other
side in Alaska, and ultimately arriving in New York City! Not only would
[the completion of the Bering Strait rail]{.underline} connection
[connect]{.underline} these [two great landmasses and place them in
direct economic, cultural, and commercial communication with each other,
but it would]{.underline} definitively [shift the center of global
civilization away from the trans-Atlantic and towards the Pacific
basin,]{.underline} as well as [**opening up the Arctic**, mankind's
modern-day frontier, **to human exploration and
development**]{.underline}. Overcoming the engineering challenges
involved in bridging the gap between Alaska and Siberia would represent
a feat of human accomplishment. By means of 55 miles of tunnels under
the Bering Strait, the transportation systems of Eurasia and the
Americas could be linked, allowing the development of two of the most
neglected regions of the planet. Some 2,000 miles of new railway in
Eurasia and more than 600 miles in North America will need to be built,
under rugged northern conditions on both continents, to complete the
connection with the transport systems which already exist. [This vital
transportation corridor would be more than merely a means to get from
point A to point B; it will open up vast potential for mineral and raw
materials development in the Far North]{.underline}. It is not merely a
high-speed replacement for shipping across the Pacific; it is an
[opportunity to develop this severely underdeveloped region of the U.S.,
Canada, and Russia, allowing its fallow riches to benefit the people of
the planet, including through]{.underline} the development of [new
cities and research centers in this region]{.underline}, unlocking a new
opportunity for human discovery and endeavor. LaRouche's movement has
campaigned for a Bering Strait connection since the 1970s. This project
served as a critical link in a global chain of development projects
envisioned by the LaRouche movement at the time, to be the [foundation
of a new international economic order]{.underline} and financed through
investments by the International Development Bank and related
institutions of international credit. With the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1990, Lyndon and Helga LaRouche's vision of a Productive
Triangle to integrate the economies of Western and Eastern Europe was
expanded to become the Eurasian LandBridge, spanning the entirety of the
Eurasian territory. The LaRouche movement campaigned vigorously to
[bring this perspective of mutually beneficial development to the
governments of every major country on the planet, as the foundation for
a new strategic order of peace through progress, as opposed to a
perpetuation of geopolitical war.]{.underline} During the 1990s, a
number of critical studies were commissioned to explore the possibility
of extending this Eurasian Land-Bridge idea to encompass the Bering
Strait connection, bridging into the Americas, including most notably a
1995 visionary over-view study co-authored by American engineer Hal B.H.
Cooper, Jr. and Professor Sergei A. Bykadorov of the Siberian State
Academy of Transport in Novosibirsk. In the recent decade, additional
plans for this project have received renewed interest. An April 2007
conference convened by Russia's Council for the Study of Productive
Forces titled "Megaprojects of Russia's East: A Transcontinental
Eurasia-America Transport Link via the Bering Strait" called for
detailed feasibility studies of the project. The conference was
addressed by numerous leading Russian academicians, as well as by the
former Governor of Alaska, Walter Hickel, who delivered a speech titled
"A Transcontinental Eurasia-American Transport Link via the Bering
Strait: Megaprojects as the Alternative to War" in which he called [the
Bering Strait connection "a project that may change the world, a project
of joining creative energies, **replacing missile defense systems** with
a territory of international cooperation."]{.underline}

Meanwhile, a [highly significant study]{.underline}, *Rails to Resources
to Ports,*\[7\] published in 2007 by the State of Alaska and the
Canadian territory of the Yukon, [concluded that an Alaska Canada Rail
Link (ACRL),]{.underline} connecting Alaska and northern British
Columbia, [would create wider benefits even if freight revenue did not
cover the projected \$10.5 billion construction cost]{.underline}.
Building up to a 1,600 mile line(s) between existing railroads in Alaska
and Canada would spur mining development and open a new trade route to
Asia. The report suggested [the rail link would likely have to be funded
as a joint public-private project]{.underline}, as projected freight
shipping revenues over 50 years would cover only about 75 percent of the
full investment. [Building the rail line]{.underline} through this
largely wilderness region [would create \$11.4 billion in net public
benefits such as increased employment]{.underline} over the next five
decades. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized \$6 million to study the
feasibility of the idea. The 2007 ACRL study examined building a line
from a terminus of the Canadian National Railway in northern British
Columbia, running through Yukon to the state-owned Alaska Railway, as
well as a branch line to the White Pass & Yukon Route Railway. [Rail
cars to and from Alaska now travel by barge, thus building the rail line
would improve the state's economic security by adding transportation
options]{.underline}, the researchers said. Exports of British Columbia
coal and iron ore from Yukon would probably make up the bulk of the
line's freight traffic because access to rail service would [make
building mines in the region more economically feasible. Asian trade via
containers could]{.underline} also [become a revenue
source]{.underline}. The economic research used to prepare the report
was much more extensive than any earlier study on an Alaska-Canada rail
link. The researchers acknowledged the line would also have an
environmental and social impact on the wilderness area, and said both
issues needed more study. *Figure 5: The vision of an Alaska Canada Rail
Link connecting to U.S. and Canadian ports for ocean-going shipment to
Korea, Japan, and China.* The *Rails to Resources to Ports* report
proposes rail links to ports in Alaska, Yukon and/or British Columbia to
then ship North American mineral resources across the Pacific to China,
South Korea and Japan, and to receive container traffic in return. It
does not propose \-- or even mention \-- a rail link across the Bering
Strait. Instead, it recommends in effect a "rails to ports" solution to
enable access to markets for the mineral wealth of northwestern Canada
and Alaska. *Figure 6: A map of 50-year life-cycle sourcing for route
options connecting the Alaska Railroad to the Canadian National Railway

Alaska or British Columbia would be shorter]{.underline} than from ports
such as Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco/Oakland, Los
Angeles/Long Beach, and San Diego, [ocean-going shipping nonetheless is
slower than a land route, not to mention]{.underline} the [time for
loading and offloading.]{.underline} If [an Alaska Canada rail
link]{.underline} were to materialize as the study envisions, it [would
be a major step forward from an economic p]{.underline}oint
[o]{.underline}f [v]{.underline}iew, [and]{.underline} certainly one
[worthy of support on its own merits, but would not have all the
practical advantages of a rail link connecting Alaska and
Russia.]{.underline} Rail executive Craig Burroughs wrote: [When
measured against current shipping patterns, the advantages of the Bering
Strait's]{.underline} keystone location, at the top of the "great
circle" arc between Earth's two major landmasses, [is]{.underline} even
more [evident]{.underline}. [The distance from Beijing to Chicago for
the movement of Chinese manufactured goods is now more than 9,000
miles]{.underline} via rail transport on both continents and the
shortest ocean-shipping lane. [Depending on the U.S. port of entry, that
distance can be significantly greater. The same goods would have to
travel only about 7,500 miles by rail on]{.underline}ce [the Bering
Strait connection]{.underline} is completed into China. Given the
[shorter distance, greater speed of railway in comparison with ocean
shipping, and elimination of two steps of off-loading]{.underline} from
train to ship at a Chinese port and from ship to rail at a U.S. port,
[the Bering Strait rail route will offer inland shippers on both
continents new and more competitive alternatives]{.underline}. Shippers
should gain a number of [cost advantages]{.underline}, including [lower
inventory-in-transit expenses; less loss from product degradation,
damage, shrinkage, and pilferage]{.underline} by elimination of port
handling and modal transfers at both ends of the ocean movement;
[simplification of shipping documentation]{.underline} [and

An economic report published in the June edition of [Alaska]{.underline}
Economic Trends notes that the state [has a large trade
surplus]{.underline}, exporting far more in goods than were imported in
2024, [while the United States overall imported significantly more than
what was exported.]{.underline} Alaska's exports in 2024 totaled [\$5.9
billion in goods to 117 countries, compared to \$3.6 billion in goods
imported from 106 countries]{.underline}, notes Dan Robinson, chief of
the research and analysis for the Alaska Department of Labor and
Workforce Development. The [national economy overall, meanwhile,
imported \$3.3 trillion in goods and exported \$2.1 trillion, resulting
in a \$1.2 trillion trade deficit, while Alaska had a \$2.3 billion
trade]{.underline} surplus, Robinson said. [Asia is by far Alaska's
biggest export destination]{.underline} -- mostly fish and other
seafood. Fifty-two percent of all of Alaska's export value goes to Asia
-- including \$1.5 billion to China, \$674 million to Japan, and \$634
million to South Korea. China purchased \$520 million in fish -- fresh,
chilled or frozen -- and other marine products, while Japan purchased
\$480 million and South Korea purchased \$299 million in fish and other
seafood products. [Metal ores]{.underline} were the [second largest
category]{.underline} of exports from Alaska to Asia. China's purchases
totaled \$483 million, followed by South Korea with \$332 million and
Japan with \$184 million, all presumably for further processing and
resale, Robinson said. Asia also proved to be Alaska's largest source of
imports. Nearly 90% of Alaska's purchased came from Asia, including
\$1.2 billion from South Korea, \$315 million from Vietnam, and \$262
million from Thailand. Alaska purchases from Asia were a mix of
petroleum oils for transportation and energy, semiconductors, and other
electronics -- likely for commercial and person use. Those imports
include \$1.1 billion in petroleum products from South Korea; \$55
million in semiconductors and other electronic parts from Taiwan, \$40
million of which was solar panel components; \$46 million from South
Korea in processors and hard drives; \$32 million from the Philippines;
and \$28 million from China in semiconductors and other electronic
components. Europe's purchases from Alaska came to more than \$1.3
billion, with the largest amount -- nearly \$323 million -- going to
Switzerland, mostly in nonmonetary refined gold. Robinson said this is a
good example of what [many foreign businesses seek from Alaska: Raw
materials to which they]{.underline} presumably [add value through
resale in their own countries or further trade
internationally.]{.underline} Other large exports from the state to
Europe include [zinc ores]{.underline}: \$165 million to Spain, \$99
million to Germany, \$64 million to Belgium, \$49 million to Italy, and
\$43 million to Finland. European seafood purchases included \$275
million in product to The Netherlands, \$58 million to France, and \$49
million to Germany. Robinson noted that [Canada]{.underline}, the
state's nearest neighbor, [is]{.underline} also [a big trade partner
with Alaska.]{.underline}

Conclusions Both [communities and residents in]{.underline} the Yukon,
Northeast BC and Eastern [Alaska will derive significant benefits from
the construction and operation of the ACRL. Opening access and providing
lower transport cost to/from these regions for]{.underline} both import
and export of [goods]{.underline} and supplies [will have a dramatic
positive economic impact]{.underline}. Reducing the cost and increasing
both sources and markets for goods and supplies will [benefit and
stimulate resource industries, including mining, forestry and oil and
gas,]{.underline} that will [inevitably result in job
creation]{.underline}. This, in turn, will [open employment
opportunities]{.underline} and assist in [lowering
unemployment]{.underline} and in the retention of existing residents,
[particularly amongst First Nations residents and youth]{.underline}, in
these three resource dependent areas. The addition of higher paying jobs
in resources industries will also serve to [improve]{.underline} the
[income and economic well-being of residents and communities, including
First Nations, through wage spending]{.underline}. It will also likely
attract new or returning permanent and temporary residents
[expand]{.underline}ing [the population base and
stimulat]{.underline}ing the need for new housing,
[construction]{.underline} employment and demand for goods and services.
Higher demand for goods and services by both industry and residents will
[open entrepreneurial opportunities for]{.underline} existing and new
[residents, especially First Nations and in small
communities]{.underline}, particularly if resource industries continue
their practice of proactive local procurement. [Cost of living for
residents should]{.underline} also [be reduced]{.underline}, assuming
the lower cost of transport for goods and equipment is passed onto
consumers. [Savings especially should occur in industries like
construction,]{.underline} which are dependent on large volumes of heavy
materials and equipment. The [ACRL may also add transport options for
workers travelling to/from mine sites]{.underline} or elsewhere outside
the region if regular passenger service was implemented.

All three regions depend heavily on imported goods and supplies, as
their local manufacturing and agricultural sectors are small. As a
result, [virtually all produce, and consumer goods and supplies must be
imported]{.underline}. The Yukon and [Alaska]{.underline} must [rely on
trucking, barge/trucking or barge/rail/trucking for its supply chain
that results in significantly higher costs]{.underline} for goods and
supplies. Northeast BC has both direct rail and highway access to the
rest of Canada and North America. As a result, that region will not
benefit as much from the ACRL for shipping of supplies and materials,
apart from having greater access to Alaskan produce like fish, which is
the State's principal export to the Yukon. Approximately 98% of the
Yukon's [food supply]{.underline} 105 and [95% of Alaska's]{.underline}
106 [are imported]{.underline}. This reli[ance also extends to fuel,
consumer goods, equipment and]{.underline} vehicles and
[construction]{.underline} materials. In 2014, almost 600,000 tonnes of
imported goods entered the Yukon, 107 of this total 147,000 tonnes were
in transit to Alaska108 of which 13,825 tonnes were transferred to the
Alaska Railroad109 at Fairbanks for distribution. In 2015/16,
approximately 10.8 million tonnes of goods were imported into Alaska, of
which 63.6% (6.9 tonnes) was fuel. 110 By comparison, Yukon fuel imports
for local consumption represented 42.0% of imports. The much larger
population and industrial size of Alaska plus the presence of US
military facilities explains this disparity. In 2014, the Yukon received
approximately 66% of its consumer freight imports via the Alaska Highway
at Watson Lake, 30% via the Inside Passage ports of Skagway and Haines
and the remaining 4% through the Interior border crossing at Beaver
Creek.111 Community resupply, which includes agricultural products,
general merchandise, household goods, livestock, cars and mobile homes,
etc., accounted for over a third (38%) of the [total volume in import
goods. Development freight]{.underline}, including [construction
materials, iron, pipe and steel and equipment and
machinery,]{.underline} for industry and residential and non-residential
construction [comprised 20%.]{.underline} Community bulk fuel for
heating and transportation represented 35% and bulk fuel for mines
another 7%. Alaska received almost 3.0 million tonnes of imported
non-petroleum goods and supplies in 2016.112 The [Port of
Anchorage]{.underline} (POA), which is the [principal point of entry for
freight]{.underline}, received 50% of all inbound waterborne
non-petroleum freight (see Figure 4-3 below) of which 15% was shipped by
rail or truck to Fairbanks and the Interior of the State. The Port of
Whittier was the second largest recipient of nonpetroleum freight with
about 450,000 tonnes (15%) and the remaining south-central ports
received 150,000 (5%). Skagway and Haines, the two ports constituting
the Inside Passage gateways to the Yukon, received approximately 45,000
tonnes113 of non-fuel freight respectively in 2016, most of which was
destined for local business and resident use. Trucking accounted for
another 114,000 to 136,000 tonnes and air transport 91,000 to 114,000
tonnes of goods and supplies consumed in Alaska. In 2016, Alaska
consumed 5.8 million tonnes of petroleum products, of which 46% was jet
fuel.114 The POA received 1.8 million tonnes of petroleum products or
32% of total consumption. In-state refineries fill 70% to 80% of local
consumption115, with a relatively small amount of petroleum product
being imported from Canada. In 2015, 8,275 tonnes of Liquid Petroleum
Gas (LPG) was shipped to Whittier via the CN Aquatrain.116 In 2014,
71,000 tonnes of gas, 106,000 tonnes of distillate fuel oil, 4,000
tonnes of LNG and 2,000 tonnes of kerosene were barged to communities in
southeast Alaska (e.g., Skagway, Ketchikan and Juneau) from the Port of
Vancouver117 as well as a 11,343 tonnes of fuel via the Alaska
Highway.118 other communities in the Territory where it ranged from
13.8% higher in Carmacks to 118.7% in Old Crow. 120 [Alaska's cost of
living is the fifth highest in the US]{.underline} after Hawaii, the
District of Columbia, California and New York.121 It [ranks highest in
health costs and second highest after Hawaii in food, utilities and
transportation.]{.underline} Choice of transport mode for freight
generally hinges on a trade-off between cost and delivery time, which in
turn involves considerations such as cargo weight and dimension,
shipping schedule, shipper capacity restrictions, trans-shipment needs,
weather concerns/risk, type of commodity, etc. Transport cost generally
varies by distance. In general, trucking has a lower cost over short
distances, whereas rail or marine transport are more economic over
longer distances. In North America, the breakeven cost between truck and
rail is 800 to 1,200 km, whereas marine transport becomes cheaper at
approximately 2,400 km. 122 Table 4-5 below illustrates the cost
trade-off between transport modes in Alaska. Based on cost alone,
[rail]{.underline} at \$0.10 per tonne km124 [presents a competitive and
attractive alternative to other transport modes that could result in
significant]{.underline} cost [savings for]{.underline} shippers and
consumers in both the Yukon and [Alaska]{.underline}. However, other
considerations must be factored in, particularly time sensitivity in
delivery, which frequently relates to commodity type. Rail is
acknowledged as the most economic carrier of bulk, time insensitive
products. The Alaska Railroad typifies this generalization. In 2015, the
Alaska Railroad carried approximately 2.1 million tonnes of gravel, sand
and stone, 0.8 million in coal, 0.4 million petroleum products, 0.1
million in intermodal traffic and chemicals respectively, 0.1 million in
iron and steel and 0.4 million in other commodities, including military
shipments.125 Rail in the US carries only 16% of food products and 10%
of beverages. Delivery time is especially important for fresh food
produce, which require specific handling and shipping conditions and is
time sensitive. Maximum shelf life for fresh produce ranges from: 6 days
or less for berries, lettuce, herbs, etc., ♣ 14 days or less for celery,
French beans, citrus, etc., ♣ 28 days or less for potatoes, root
vegetables, etc., and, ♣ 28 days + for frozen meat.126 To illustrate why
trucks carry more of this produce than rail, the current time by rail
from field to distribution centre between California/Mexico, which is
the source of 73% of this produce, to the Northeast US is 4.8 to 7.7
days compared to 3.1 to 5.6 days by truck. Clearly, [the ACRL will not
capture all current imports]{.underline} to the Yukon and Eastern Alaska
[but because of its lower transportation cost, there will be a diversion
of some current import tonnage from existing modes]{.underline}. The
[most likely inbound freight to be attracted to the ACRL will be heavy,
time insensitive goods]{.underline} such as construction materials,
iron, pipe and steel and equipment and machinery for industry and
residential and non-residential construction, chemicals and oil and gas
products as well as consumer goods such as cars, mobile homes, livestock
as well as non-perishable groceries. However[, as the ACRL is expected
to stimulate new economic activity as well as industry and population
growth, this should not mean a loss of business and revenue in the other
transport modes]{.underline}. To the contrary, [its stimulus will mean
an increase in overall demand for transportation, including]{.underline}
higher demand for [more profitable short distance transport]{.underline}
by truck [to feed the ACRL]{.underline} as well as waterborne transport
of commodities in higher demand from regions, like the Pacific Northwest
or California with which the ACRL cannot compete. Transportation cost on
average is estimated to account for 10% of total product cost.127 In the
broadest of terms, transport costs comprise a combination of terminal
and line haul costs. Terminal costs occur at both origin and destination
for loading and unloading that are inevitable and intermediate points
where these costs may be avoidable. Terminal costs involve many
components, including labour and equipment handling and storage charges,
docking or gate fees, pilotage and traffic control charges, etc. Line
haul costs typically reflect both the weight and distance of freight
cartage and consist of labour, equipment, overhead and fuel costs. They
are also commonly multi-modal involving trucking for one or more
segments of the line haul and one or more other line haul carriers
(i.e., air, rail, deep sea vessels or barges). [The ACRL would offer a
cheaper alternative in the line haul segment of freight transport for
goods imported to]{.underline} both the Yukon and [Alaska]{.underline}.
For example, shipping a half-ton pick-up truck or single-wide mobile
home to Whitehorse entirely by rail rather than by rail to Edmonton or
Prince George and then transshipping it by truck to Whitehorse would
save approximately \$1,050 per pick-up truck or \$2,725 per mobile home
before taxes solely for line haul transport plus additional savings
related to loading and unloading in Edmonton or Prince George. Table 4-6
below illustrates per tonne savings of shipments between Central Canada
and the US and Whitehorse and Fairbanks. While the estimated savings on
an individual purchase of a pick-up truck or mobile home may seem small
relative to their total cost, the real [benefit of the ACRL's transport
cost reduction is the cumulative effect it will have on all goods and
services that can be passed onto consumers.]{.underline} This is
particularly true in sectors reliant on large volumes of heavy materials
and equipment, which, as a result, represent a high percentage of the
selling price of the end product or service. These [cost savings will
also open]{.underline} both the Yukon and [Alaska to new products from
new markets that may not have been previously competitive]{.underline}.
When spread over all consumer goods and services, [all these factors
should reduce cost of living for residents in]{.underline} the Yukon and
Eastern [Alaska]{.underline} in particular. Transportation Benefits
Construction and operation of the [ACRL will add significantly
to]{.underline} the [transportation infrastructure of]{.underline} the
Yukon, Northeast BC and [Eastern Alaska]{.underline} as well as to
Canada [and the US.]{.underline} It will [add another transcontinental
railway link between the Atlantic and Pacific]{.underline} through its
connection to the Alaska Railroad, which serves the Port of Anchorage
and, in future, Port Mackenzie. It will also [expand access to the
region for export and import of goods at lower cost to and
from]{.underline} other parts of Canada and [the US as well as
overseas]{.underline}. These latter benefits will be discussed in more
detail in Section 5. In addition to goods transport, the [ACRL could
also provide a possible means of transporting workers to and from mine
and other resource extraction sites from nearby communities]{.underline}
or airports. While the potential to serve daily commuting to/from work
sites is likely to be limited, it could increase access and frequency of
opportunities to go to nearby communities if a regular passenger rail
service were implemented. If this were the case, [rail service would
provide a more reliable and safer means of transport for
workers]{.underline}, particularly in inclement weather, but also when
they are fatigued when commuting after work. In some cases, [the ACRL
would offer a more direct and shorter route to and from resource
extraction site]{.underline}s. Shortening or eliminating the need for
mine site access roads and on-site air strips would [reduce costs and
could also deter or prevent workers from bringing their own vehicles to
mine sites, which]{.underline} has been cited a[s
problematic]{.underline} at times.128 Although the ACRL will reduce
heavy truck traffic on some roads and highways, resulting in less need
and cost for maintenance and rehabilitation of these facilities, its
economic and population stimulus will also generate increased transport
demand for feeder traffic between communities, mines and the ACRL as
previously stated. Thus, any cost savings resulting from the diversion
of heavy freight traffic to the ACRL is likely to be partly offset by
increased feeder and other generated traffic. Put another way, [higher
economic activity and highway and road traffic will be supported at no
extra cost overall.]{.underline}

This month, Alaska celebrated its 60th anniversary of statehood. [Much
of the economic and population growth of Alaska]{.underline} as a U.S.
territory and as the 49th state [have been tied to air,
highway,]{.underline} shipping ports [and rail]{.underline}
transportation improvements. The completion of the Alaska Railroad in
1923 and aviation improvements throughout the 20th century resulted in
successful growth for Alaska's economy, as well as reliable access to
goods and services for citizens throughout the state. [A]{.underline}
potential [bottleneck for sustaining Alaska's future economic growth is
the state's dependency on the Port of]{.underline} Anchorage. More than
85 percent of the food, commercial goods, equipment and other
[commodities]{.underline} for Alaska citizens [come through this single
port.]{.underline} With an [average of only three days' supply of
food]{.underline} on store shelves and warehouses
[statewide]{.underline}, the Nov. 30 earthquake renewed awareness of the
risks to all Alaskans if the port is severely damaged in a future
earthquake. At this point in the 21st century, [Alaska is poised to be
transformed over its next 60 years by an innovative transportation
project \-- the InterContinental Railway.]{.underline} The [project
would build more than 5,000 miles of new railroad to connect North
America with Russia and Asia via Alaska and a 60-mile tunnel under the
Bering Strait]{.underline}. [The route]{.underline} of the
InterContinental Railway [will place Alaska in the geographic center of
global commerce as more than 100 million gross tons of freight move
annually through the Bering Strait Tunnel, providing faster shipping
times between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [China and
other destinations]{.underline} of global commerce [on electrically
powered, zero-emission trains.]{.underline} For the future of Alaska,
[the east-west route of the ICR will create a remarkable trans-Alaska
right-of-way for the transmission of electricity, natural gas,
telecommunications and fresh water.]{.underline} [The electrified rail
line]{.underline} and branches to the North Slope, Nome and other areas
in Alaska [will provide transportation and power for the
responsible]{.underline} access and [development of Alaska's natural
resources]{.underline}. The project will also be important to create
jobs and [improve]{.underline} the cost of living and [quality of life
across the state]{.underline}. For example, Alaska will be connected to
the Lower 48 for the first time by rail. This will [create incredible
efficiencies and reliability in access to raw materials, equipment and
components]{.underline} for Alaska businesses [and lower the costs of
shipping]{.underline} finished products to customers [throughout the
U.S. and the world]{.underline}. These [improved supply chain economics
will be a game changer for diversifying Alaska's economy and reducing
dependency on revenues from oil and gas production]{.underline}. The ICR
rail connection to the Lower 48 will also provide Alaska with an
alternate transportation supply line for food supplies, heavy equipment
and rebuilding materials should the Port of Anchorage be severely
damaged by a future earthquake. Although [the InterContinental Railway
will cost]{.underline} more than [\$100 billion to construct, private
international construction consortiums are expected to maximize the use
of private financing to reduce the need for direct government financing.
The ICR price tag is]{.underline} also [a bargain]{.underline}, because
[the Bering Strait rail tunnel and infrastructure assets will have
a]{.underline} useful [life of between 100]{.underline} years [and 200
years, creating economic growth and activity for generations to
come]{.underline} in Alaska. During recent InterContinental Railway
community meetings held in Anchorage, Nome, Wales and Diomede, Native
councils and tribal elders pointed out the importance of ensuring that
Native communities are part of the decision-making process for the
project to ensure respect of native traditions, lands and opportunities
to train and hire Alaskans. They also recognized the importance of these
decisions to ensure that the InterContinental Railway improves the
quality of life for generations to come in a way that is in harmony with
tribal traditions and in respect for the animals, plants and lands that
are important for subsistence living. The [InterContinental Railway is a
project that will]{.underline} also [require developing a mutually
beneficial treaty for the U.S., Canada, Russia, China and other
countries]{.underline} to ensure international cooperation and
commitment to the project. [Despite recent issues in U.S.-Russia
relations, the ICR is a project that will build on the current success
of transportation, fishing, telecommunications and space exploration
projects with Russia.]{.underline} [It will]{.underline} also [augment
China's status as]{.underline} Alaska's [biggest foreign trading
partner.]{.underline} Alaska's next 60 years will include important
milestones such as the centennial of the Alaska Railroad, our nation's
250th birthday and Alaska's statehood centennial. The InterContinental
Railway is a project that will transform Alaska's future with more jobs,
responsible resource development as well as reducing the cost of living
and improving the quality of life for all Alaskans statewide. [The ICR
will]{.underline} also [transform the future of global commerce and
international relations by building a remarkable transportation asset
for the peace, progress and prosperity of all nations
involved.]{.underline}

The InterContinental Railway ([ICR]{.underline}) [involves]{.underline}
the [design, engineering and construction of]{.underline} nearly [5,500
miles of new railroad, connecting existing]{.underline} railroad
[networks from]{.underline} Yakutsk in Eastern Russia, across the Bering
Strait and Alaska to Fort Nelson, [Canada to create a continuous rail
transportation link between North America, Russia, Asia and
Europe]{.underline}. Although the entire railway is below the Arctic
Circle, [the project will require the construction of the longest
railway tunnel in the world]{.underline} - a [70 mile]{.underline} long
tunnel more than [160 feet deep under the Bering Strait]{.underline}.
Dual gauge tracks or wheel gauge changing technology would be required
for train operation across Eastern Russia. The InterContinental Railway
is [projected to carry at least 100 Million Gross Tons]{.underline}
(MGT) [annually of double stack container unit trains, coal, grain, oil
unit trains and automobile shipments for foreign trade between the
United States, Canada, Russia, China, Japan and Europe.]{.underline}

This year's extent of Arctic sea ice could be the second smallest ever,
making the Northwest Passage and Northern Sea Route ever more navigable.
But [in and around the Bering Strait, the amount of ice wouldn't matter
if the plans to build an underwater tunnel between Russia and Alaska are
realized.]{.underline} Though the idea was initially floated by Tsar
Nicholas II in 1905, it was scrapped by the Soviets and then again by
the economic meltdown of the 1990s following the Soviet collapse.
Vladimir [Putin reignited Russian interest in the project and raised the
issue with]{.underline} former president George W. [Bush]{.underline} in
2008. Now, the Daily Mail reports that [the Duma has just approved the
plans to build the 64-mile tunnel and rail link,]{.underline} which
could cost anywhere from \$60-100 billion to construct. [Reports are
conflicting, but the tunnel will include a high-speed rail for cargo
trains and possibly a road, fiber optic cable connections, and energy
links]{.underline}. With the new 500-mile extension of the
Trans-Siberian Railway from Tynda to Yakutsk scheduled to be completed
in 2013, the [tunnel]{.underline} could be more [feasible]{.underline}
this time around. It would link Yakutsk, in Siberia, with the west coast
of Alaska. Russia is determined to add 2,360 miles to the TSR by 2030 as
part of its strategic plan. This will [help]{.underline} it [export more
of Siberia's resources]{.underline} to places like China and North
America. [Exporting energy to Canada and Alaska via rail might seem
silly, given that both Alaska and Canada export much of the oil they
produce. However, Alaska actually imports 43% of]{.underline} the
[petroleum products]{.underline} [it uses]{.underline} \[1\]. [Canada is
a net exporter of oil, but the eastern provinces import oil from
countries like the U.K. and Norway, since that is cheaper than building
a pipeline from the west]{.underline}, where most of the country's
petroleum resources lie. As such, while delivering energy from Siberia
to Alaska might make some sense, [shipping it all the way to eastern
Canada does not seem economical when it is already not cost-effective to
transport it from western Canada]{.underline}. Regardless, some believe
that [the tunnel could eventually carry 3% of the world's freight and
generate \$11.5 billion in annual revenue]{.underline}. At this rate,
the tunnel could [pay for itself within ten years.]{.underline} The
Times Online reports that next week, a [conference in Moscow will
propose an inter-governmental agreement with the U.S. to underwrite the
construction cost of the tunnel in exchange for a stake in the
business.]{.underline} It is difficult to imagine Congress approving a
jointly-financed project with Russia, especially given the recent
backlash over the failed B.P. -- Rosneft partnership, which Congressman
Ed Markey (D -- Mass) lampooned as turning the gas giant into "Bolshoi
Petroleum."

Conclusions [While]{.underline} the Yukon and [Alaska will be the
primary beneficiaries of the ACRL, other regions in]{.underline} Canada
and [the US Midwest and Eastern States will also gain new opportunities
and benefit from this new railway connection to these markets and
Pacific tidewater]{.underline}. Both the Ports of Anchorage and Port
MacKenzie will offer the most cost-effective export location for mineral
ores and forest products from the Yukon and Eastern Alaska, as a result
of the ACRL. Since these exports represent new tonnage, [this will not
negatively impact other West Coast ports]{.underline}. In addition, [the
closer sailing time to Asia combined with the lower cost of rail
transport]{.underline} to Central Canada and the US [will make them
attractive for container freight]{.underline} adding capacity and
promoting greater competition for this traffic as well as contributing
back haul freight demand for the ACRL. By stimulating mining, [the ACRL
will also increase demand for fuel and LNG]{.underline} broadening the
market for these products from Northeast BC and Alberta. If shipment of
LNG by rail receives regulatory approval, it could also [offer a
pipeline alternative]{.underline} to transport LNG both for consumption
in the Yukon and Alaska as well as for export to Asia. In addition, [the
ACRL would reduce the cost for an Alberta rail extension that would
enable transport of crude oil to tidewater for export to Asia.
Development of Alaska's North Slope will also benefit from the
ACRL]{.underline} providing a lower cost for shipment of equipment,
machinery, construction materials and supplies required for both
construction of a rail extension to this region and oil and gas
production. Similarly, the [ACRL could lower the cost of imports and
exports and thus improve the economic viability of developing
t]{.underline}he Crest iron ore deposit. At the same time, it would
[encourage the construction of rail access to the site, which would
reduce environmental impact]{.underline} associated with this
development. The [economic stimulus created by the ACRL]{.underline} and
lower transport cost it will afford to the Yukon and Alaska [will create
new demand and open markets for manufacturers and suppliers
in]{.underline} both Canada and [the Midwest and Eastern
US.]{.underline} At the same time, Yukon and [Alaska residents and
industries will benefit from the lower cost for numerous goods delivered
to the region. The ACRL could also encourage increased Alaskan seafood
exports]{.underline} into both Canada and the Midwest and Eastern US.

To this point, the report has focused on the ACRL corridor, which is
roughly defined as 160 km (100 mile) wide centered on the notional
alignment of the railway. However, by filling the gap between the North
American rail grid and the Alaska Railroad, [the ACRL's benefits will
extend well beyond]{.underline} this [limited corridor]{.underline}. The
ACRL will [establish a continuous railway link between]{.underline} the
Yukon and [Alaska and]{.underline} the rest of Canada and [the lower 48
States for the first time.]{.underline} It will also [provide direct
rail access from these regions to two additional]{.underline} Pacific
tidewater [ports]{.underline}, namely Anchorage and Port Mackenzie,
which are respectively two to three days shorter sailing time to/from
Asia than other northwest ports. 129 It will also [reduce the cost for,
encourage and facilitate rail extensions to join the ACRL from resource
deposits]{.underline} that can support the cost of connecting
infrastructure, although not necessarily the entire cost to access
tidewater. These potential extensions include a proposed 700 km
extension east to the Alberta oil sands region and a 400 km extension
north to the Crest Iron deposit in the Yukon. The [ACRL's connection to
the North American rail grid will also improve the viability of the
proposed Alaska North Slope rail extension]{.underline} because
construction and operation costs for equipment and materials to this
region will be reduced. Port MacKenzie and the Port of Anchorage Mineral
ore and concentrate exports from the Yukon and Eastern Alaska currently
rely on truck transport from mines to the nearest all-weather road and
then to a tidewater port. Skagway, Alaska is the closest tidewater port
to the Yukon but unfortunately it has very limited upland area for
storage and handling of these commodities as it is constrained by the
town and Skagway River and its environmentally sensitive estuary. It
also faces considerable competition for dock and land storage space from
the lucrative cruise industry. Although served by the White Pass and
Yukon Railway, this single gauge rail line is not suitable for major ore
transfers and therefore these are carried by truck, which must traverse
the very steep 22.5 km section between the Canadian Border and Skagway.
Haines, Alaska is the second closest tidewater port to the Yukon,
located about 26 km to the southwest of Skagway. This port has greater
upland port potential but is also only served by trucks at present and
again has steep and challenging terrain to cross the 71.9 km between the
port and the Yukon border. The Haines Borough and State of Alaska
examined construction of a 336 km rail link130 between the port and
Carmacks to connect with the then assumed closest junction point with
the ACRL. The estimated capital cost of this rail link was \$4.0 billion
(2017 USD). 131 [The ACRL will provide new tidewater access
opportunities to]{.underline} both [Port MacKenzie and
Anchorage]{.underline} via the existing Alaska Railroad. The ports are
roughly the same nautical distance to/from Asia. However, Port MacKenzie
is 24 km closer to the Interior and is less constrained in both
transportation access and upland storage and handling potential than
Anchorage, with docks designed to efficiently export natural resources.
132 Given that transportation differences are relatively small between
the two ports, it would make sense and allow both ports to specialize
their freight handling to take advantage of their respective assets.
Despite the greater distance to these ports from the Yukon compared to
Skagway and Haines, the [lower cost of rail transport compared to
trucking and the reduction in deep sea shipping costs would make use of
the ACRL for exports to Asia]{.underline} via these ports the cheaper
option. 133 As cited previously (Section 4 -- Forestry Employment
Opportunities), [the ACRL would now also make forest product exports
from]{.underline} the Yukon, Northeast BC and Eastern Interior [Alaska
to Asia economic]{.underline}, further adding to both rail and port
freight tonnage volumes. The ACRL will also [reduce the cost and time
for imported goods from Asia to]{.underline} the Yukon and
[Alaska]{.underline} as well as the rest of Canada [and the US Midwest
and Eastern states]{.underline}. Anchorage is the main port of entry for
containers and other goods barged or shipped to Alaska from the lower 48
States or Canada with 50% to 55% of all freight remaining in the
Anchorage region for local consumption.134 Approximately 20% of the
Port's arriving freight is then distributed to the Matanuska-Susitna
Borough and another 15% to Fairbanks and the Interior. Freight that is
destined to Anchorage will likely continue to transit the Port of
Anchorage as will mixed shipments that include significant volumes of
freight for Anchorage. However, bulk freight and freight predominantly
destined for the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and Alaska Interior could opt
to use Port MacKenzie. Port MacKenzie and Anchorage could both benefit
from additional container and other freight imports from Asia being
diverted from other Northwest ports because of their two to three-day
shorter sailing time advantage. Also, depending on the deep-sea vessel
cost, the [rail cost]{.underline} to Central Canada [could
be]{.underline} \$30 to \$174 per tonne cheaper than from Prince Rupert
or Vancouver and \$200 to \$[330 per tonne cheaper to Chicago than from
Seattle]{.underline}.135 Rivalry between ports for container traffic is
highly competitive and other factors including loading and operational
efficiency at the ports, are factors in determining which port to use.
In addition to the above, the [ACRL could offer an alternative means of
transporting crude oil to tidewater]{.underline} if either a pipeline or
rail connection from Alberta was constructed to intercept the ACRL. The
former has never been explored as all efforts regarding pipeline
construction have focused on reaching tidewater on the BC coast at
Prince Rupert, Kitimat (e.g., Enbridge Gateway project) or Vancouver
(Kinder Morgan project). However, the feasibility of an Alberta to
Alaska rail link connecting the oil sands region of Alberta to tidewater
in Alaska has been the subject of study for several years. The Alberta
Alaska Rail Link pre-feasibility study in 2015 concluded that this [rail
link could transport 1.0 to 1.5 million barrels of petroleum product per
day]{.underline} (mbpd). 146 The estimated cost for the 2,440 km rail
line, including oil handling facilities, rolling stock as well as costs
associated with possible port terminal upgrades or construction and
either a pipeline and/rail connection to access the Port of Valdez,
ranged from \$30 to \$36 billion (\$2017). 147 Actual cost would depend
on the volume of petroleum products shipped, tidewater access option
selected and the project's final cost and schedule. Annual operating
costs were estimated to range from \$2.0 billion to \$3.7 billion
(\$2017). 140 Based on the above and assuming petroleum revenues only,
the 2015 study estimated that the transport charge necessary to fully
cover all capital and operating costs over 25 to 29 years and provide a
reasonable rate of return on debt and equity would be \$16.46 to \$22.82
per barrel for 1.0 mbpd and \$13.28 to \$19.20 per barrel for 1.5 mbpd.
These projected charges are in line with the cost per barrel (\$10.32 to
\$19.88) reported by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for
rail transport to BC's west coast.148 [Construction of the ACRL could
roughly halve the estimated capital cost of an Alberta rail
link]{.underline} by eliminating the need to construct 1,729 km of
mainline track. The Alberta rail extension would still need to construct
a rail connection between Fort Nelson and its end point in Northern
Alberta as well as finance rolling stock, oil handling and other
operation facilities, possible tidewater port connections and track
upgrades, such as passing tracks, required by its operation. Alaska's
North Slope Oil Production [The ACRL could benefit oil production in
Alaska's North Slope]{.underline} in two important ways. First, it could
[reduce the estimated]{.underline} \$9.5 billion (2017 CAD)149
[construction cost for the Alaska Railroad North Slope Extension and oil
production infrastructure]{.underline} by lowering the cost of equipment
and materials shipped from Canada and the lower 48 States. Second, it
could lower the cost of equipment, materials and supplies required
during production. Shale oil production on Alaska's North Slope will
require significant quantities of freight annually, including over 4,500
to 5,400 tonnes of fracking sand and equal aggregate tonnage of drilling
steel, drilling fluids, cement, diesel fuel and equipment per well. 150
In total, it is estimated that oil production on the North Slope alone
would require 2.2 million tonnes per year of inbound freight. This
estimate is considered conservative as it does not include freight
required to support conventional oil production nor the potential export
of LNG. By comparison, rail freight carried to serve Russia's Yamal
Peninsula oil and gas production, which is expected to produce 11.2
million tonnes of LNG over seven months each year, is estimated to be 24
million tonnes.151 The [ACRL would enable inbound freight]{.underline}
that is [produced in]{.underline} Canada or [the lower 48]{.underline}
States [to be shipped entirely by rail to the North Slope]{.underline}.
This would result in [substantial cost savings.]{.underline} For
example, \$425 would be saved for every tonne of freight shipped from
Chicago exclusively by rail directly to the North Slope via Fairbanks
rather than by rail and barge via Anchorage. If only half the inbound
freight to the North Slope was routed through Chicago, this would amount
to an annual saving of \$0.5 billion. Crest Region Resources The Crest
iron ore deposit in the Peel River Watershed of Northeast Yukon is the
largest of its kind in North America with a preliminary estimate of 12
billion tonnes of iron ore potential. 152 In addition, it is located
adjacent the Bonnet Plume Basin, which has been identified as source of
coal and 25 million m3 of natural gas.153 The [Peel River
Watershed]{.underline}, however, is uninhabited and one of the least
explored regions of the Yukon. As such, [access for exploration
and]{.underline} mine or other [resource development has been subject to
environmental and First Nations' opposition]{.underline}, advocating
protection for most of the region, which remains unresolved. 154
Realization of [the ACRL potentially could assist in a
resolution]{.underline} of this current impasse [as rail access to the
region would greatly limit access, its footprint and unauthorized
intrusion]{.underline} into the area [and, at the same time, provide a
cost effective solution to]{.underline} the [resource
development]{.underline}. The Crest deposit is situated approximately
240 km northeast of Mayo Landing and 400 km away from Carmacks.
Accessing the Crest deposit would require either building a new 193 km
mine access road to reach the nearest all-weather road at Elsa, which is
274 km northeast of Carmacks, or an approximately 370 km new railway
spur line. Neither of these access options have been studied and costed
but a rough estimate of their cost would be \$270 million for a two-lane
gravel access road and \$4.8 billion for the rail line.155 While the
rail access option's capital cost is significantly higher, the transport
cost savings (\$70 per tonne) compared to trucking ore from the Crest to
the ACRL would more than offset this cost differential. In fact, it
would only require transport of 65,700 tonnes of ore to break even. The
size of the ore deposit and its production duration suggests that this
investment would be economically supportable, particularly if it eased
environmental approval for the project. In addition, using rail to
transport iron ore from Carmacks to Port MacKenzie would save \$75 per
tonne compared to trucking ore from Crest to Haines, Alaska, the nearest
port capable of handling Crest's volume of ore exports. It would also
[obviate the need for an estimated \$1.8 billion]{.underline} 156 [in
capital expenditures for port development requirements]{.underline}. 157
The reciprocal [benefit for the ACRL would be a potential revenue stream
of almost \$500 billion]{.underline} over the life of the mine, assuming
12 billion tonnes of ore was transported to Port MacKenzie. In fact, it
would only take 3% of the iron ore to be transported to cover the ACRL's
entire capital cost. In addition, the ACRL would benefit from revenues
and the Crest mine from transport cost savings for shipments of
equipment, materials and supplies both during mine development and
operation transported from the rest of Canada and the US Midwest and
Eastern states. Fisheries [Seafood is the second-largest source of
export cargo from Alaska after oil and gas.]{.underline} 158 On average,
Alaska harvests 2.3 to 2.7 million tonnes of seafood and processes 1.1
to 1.2 million tonnes of frozen, canned, dried or other seafood
products159 each year. 160 In 2017, the State exported 1.1 million
tonnes of seafood valued at \$3.45 billion (USD), of which approximately
one-third went to China. 161 Exports to Canada comprised about 5% of
this total. [Alaska also ships]{.underline} about 0[.5 million tonnes of
seafood]{.underline} south [to the Lower 48 States each
year]{.underline}. Shipping fresh and live seafood by air is an
economically important component of Alaska's seafood exports, as it has
a higher value, but it is small compared to marine transport, which
carries most seafood exports. As seafood originates primarily from the
southern coastal areas of the State, marine shipping will retain its
dominance in the export of these products. However, [the ACRL could
facilitate increased exports of processed seafood]{.underline} to the
Canadian market as well as to the Midwest and Eastern US because of its
lower transport costs. In so doing, it would [add a welcome source of
back haul freight to the ACRL.]{.underline} Goods Manufacturing and
Construction Suppliers The [new connectivity provided by the
ACRL]{.underline} to the Yukon and Alaska [will benefit manufacturing
and construction material and equipment suppliers/exporters
in]{.underline} the Canada as well as [the Midwest and Eastern
US.]{.underline} As previously discussed, a large proportion of inbound
freight for mining, oil and gas production, construction projects and
domestic consumption originates from these regions. This includes the
supply of vehicles, equipment, machinery and parts, chemicals,
pre-fabricated buildings and construction materials, such as piping,
lumber, cement, etc. The [ACRL's stimulus of new metallic mines alone is
estimated to generate demand for up to 2.2 million tonnes of equipment,
machinery and supplies annually]{.underline} to support mine
operations(see Section 3). This does not include equipment, goods and
supplies required during construction and development of new mines. As
the exact number, scale and timing of development of these mines is
unclear, freight requirements for equipment, goods and supplies are
equally difficult to estimate and will vary by the type of mine (e.g.,
open pit, underground or a combination). For example, the Donlin mine in
Alaska, which is a large scale open-pit gold mine, estimates needing
450,000 to 550,000 tonnes of equipment and materials (excluding fuel)
for its development. 162 The demands from the North Slope oil and gas
industries and Crest iron ore mine will also be substantial. Although
less substantial in volume than these industrial uses, e[xpected
population growth will also add further demand for vehicles,
pre-fabricated buildings, building materials and consumer
products]{.underline}. Also, [because the ACRL will make transport
cheaper]{.underline} from eastern manufacturers and suppliers, [it
will]{.underline} likely [open]{.underline} the Yukon and Eastern
[Alaska]{.underline} regions [to new potential providers and more
competition]{.underline} for these goods, which will benefit consumers
and providers alike.

Both the Yukon and Alaska are highly dependent on imported goods and
supplies. [Alaska relies heavily on marine transport to receive
approximately 90% of]{.underline} these [products]{.underline}. 174 The
[Port of Anchorage is the primary entry point]{.underline}, handling
approximately 1.5 million tonnes of non-petroleum and 1.6 million tonnes
of petroleum freight in 2017175 or roughly 74% of all waterborne inbound
freight, 80% of cement used for concrete in the State176 and 90% of
refined petroleum products sold in the Railbelt and beyond, which
encompasses 87% of the State's population.177 Alaska's supply chain is
challenged by extreme weather and rugged inland terrain, where only 31%
of Alaska's roads are paved.178 [Driver issues are]{.underline} also
[challenging as recruitment can be difficult]{.underline} given the
State's relatively small population and regulated hours of service
restrictions where a 500-mile stretch of highway may be uninhabited or
lack amenities to serve driver rest periods.179 Recognizing these
challenges and the tenuous supply issues in Alaska, barge carriers have
adopted two propellers systems to avoid sailing delays for repairs.
Grocery suppliers have contracted trucks using two driver crews and air
deliveries of produce to supplement the main weekly barge supply.180
However, these [back-up arrangements come at a cost and are relatively
minor compared to the main flow of goods by marine
transport.]{.underline} The [State's vulnerability to disruption in food
and other essential supplies was]{.underline} [evident when the 1964
earthquake destroyed coastal ports for several months]{.underline}.
However, [at that time, the State was less dependent on outside supply
of food]{.underline}181 [and just-in-time delivery of]{.underline} parts
and other [necessities]{.underline}, such as re-agents for power plants,
that are no longer stockpiled. [Mechanical problems in January 2016 that
prevented one barge trip delivering food to Anchorage resulting in empty
shelves in grocery stores]{.underline}, illustrated this dependence. 182
[If ports are unavailable for any reason]{.underline}, the [current
alternative is to transport goods and supplies by truck or air, which
are both more costly and difficult]{.underline} due to the capacity that
would be required. Assuming a maximum load of 19 tonnes per truck, 183
approximately 13,600 truck trips per month or over 3,000 per week would
be needed to replace the barge freight tonnage transiting the Port of
Anchorage. The [Port of Anchorage is also extremely important from a
strategic and military perspective]{.underline}. It is one of 17
[designated "US Commercial Strategic Seaports" by the
D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense. 184 It
is [directly connected by a secure road to the Joint Base
Elmdorf-Richardson]{.underline} as well as [by rail to four of Alaska's
five military installations]{.underline}. It [plays a vital role in
troop deployment and handles 100% of jet fuel and two-thirds of all fuel
used by the military]{.underline} as well as consumer, business and
military cargo. From a Canadian perspective, [the Alaskan military
installations are]{.underline} also [critically important]{.underline}
both [as]{.underline} training [grounds]{.underline} that are [used
for]{.underline} joint military exercises and the [defense of Arctic
sovereignty]{.underline}, which is [increasingly being challenged by
both Russia and China.]{.underline}185 For these reasons, the Port is
modernizing several docks to withstand a catastrophic seismic event with
minimum damage to ensure receipt of essential supplies should this
occur. While positive, these [measures may not cover all
circumstances]{.underline}. Both [in the case of emergencies and
national security, the best contingency for Alaska's dependence on the
Port of Anchorage is having viable alternatives]{.underline}. The Alaska
Highway is the sole major highway access to Alaska from Canada and the
Lower 48 States. The Highway is a two-lane undivided paved road that
spans 2,232 km from Dawson Creek, BC to Delta Junction, Alaska, which is
the currently designated terminus of the Alaska Railroad. Here, the
Highway also joins the Richardson Highway (Interstate A2), which serves
Fairbanks and then connects with the Glenn Highway (Interstate A1) that
leads to Anchorage. [Construction of the ACRL would significantly
bolster the region's resilience in event of natural disasters as well as
national security]{.underline}. The rail link would [provide a means of
hauling heavy equipment and machinery necessary in such
emergencies]{.underline} as well as construction materials and other
bulk goods. It could either complement or offset the need for using the
Alaska Highway.

This communique was issued April 25, as an "Appeal from the participants
of the international conference on an Intercontinental EurasiaAmerica
Transport Link via the Bering Strait, to the heads of state and
governments of Russia, the U.S.A., Canada, South Korea, Japan, China,
and the EU member-states." Along with the Appeal, the participants at
the April Moscow conference sent a draft Memorandum of Cooperation,
proposing that those nations endorse the project and consider financing
feasibility studies for the Bering Strait project at the June 6-8 summit
of the G-8 in Heiligendamm, Germany. The studies could be completed by
2010, the communique stated. Subheads have been added. The idea of
creation of a global land transportation system connecting four out of
six continents (Eurasia, North and South America, and Africa) has
occupied the minds of mankind for centuries. The [issues of economic
growth and global energy security, strengthening political and trade
ties, containing and preventing wars and civil conflicts, and cultural
interaction are directly related to the global community's ability to
clear the hurdles in the way of solving global problems and ensuring
constructive cooperation in all spheres of the world economy. Today, on
the agenda, are expansion and diversification of trade ties between
countries]{.underline}, [combining]{.underline} their energy,
[transport]{.underline}, and information [resources]{.underline} for
developing uncultivated territories and exploiting their natural
resources. Now is the time to pay most serious attention to projects
aimed at peace and creation; it's time to revisit humankind's great
ideas. Continuing Great Projects The past 150 years were marked by
numerous ambitious projects. These are the 9,000-kilometer-long
Trans-Siberian Railroad, the Transcontinental Railroad in the U.S.A.,
the tunnel between the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido, the
Great Belt Fixed Link in Denmark, the Eurotunnel, and many others. The
21st Century will see the construction of tunnels underneath the Straits
of Gibraltar and the Bosporus, a tunnel under the Yangtze River, tunnels
between the Russian mainland, Sakhalin, and Japan, and a tunnel between
Newfoundland and Labrador Peninsula in Canada. [The construction of the
intercontinental link uniting Eurasia and America,]{.underline}
Intercontinental Link ([ICL]{.underline})-[World]{.underline} Link,
[could become a crucial contribution to the creation of the Global
Transportation System]{.underline} ([GTS]{.underline}) [as it pulls
together global experience in implementing international
projects]{.underline}. Today, [the main deterrent to a multimodal GTS
and the actual linking of the two continents is the absence of a
connection between Eurasia's and America's transportation and energy
systems.]{.underline} In order to overcome this hurdle, [it is necessary
to build 6,000 kilometers of railroad from Yakutsk, Russia to the North
American railway network via Magadan, Chukotka, the Bering Strait, and
Alaska incorporated in a single corridor with a power transmission line
and fiber-optic lines.]{.underline} The [project]{.underline}'s
[feasibility has raised no doubts among the international engineering
community]{.underline}. The [necessary target investment in the project
is estimated at \$65 billion.]{.underline} Providing financing for the
project as of 2008 would ensure that the feasibility study is completed
by 2010. The [approximate cost of]{.underline} the feasibility study,
including all [necessary research]{.underline} and an ecological
assessment, [is estimated at \$120 million and may be divided among the
countries]{.underline} participating in the project. A major portion of
the Russian share of joint financing will be disbursed under the program
for development of the Russian railway transportation system, which was
approved at a government meeting held on April 10, 2007. [Economic
efficiency of the project is ensured by large volumes of cargo to be
shipped]{.underline} (400-500 billion tons/kilometers per year),
[synergies between hydro- and tidal-power generation systems, and the
effects of competitive exploitation of the plentiful natural resources
in the area covered by the ICLWorld Link.]{.underline} However, [the
project's geopolitical significance appears to be even greater, as it
unites continents and creates conditions for multifaceted and fruitful
cooperation among the peoples of many countries.]{.underline} In just 15
to 20 years, [the new multimodal transport artery will change the world.
Humankind will gain access to new energy and natural
resources.]{.underline} [The ICL-World Link will provide access to
territories colossal both in physical dimensions and economic
potential.]{.underline} To implement the international research program
and coordination of efforts to prepare and realize the project, the
international nonprofit organization Interhemispheric Bering Strait
Tunnel & Railroad Group (IBSTRG) was created in 1992. As of today, [the
basic technical and economic characteristics of the link, and the
possibilities and ways of hooking it up to Russia's and America's
transport routes, have been defined]{.underline}, and the preliminary
analysis of the economic and social effects of the project has been
completed. Creating Economic Potential We, the participants of the
International Conference on an Intercontinental Eurasia-America Link via
the Bering Strait, which took place in Moscow on April 24, 2007, having
discussed the prerequisites, opportunities and the expected effects of
the project, and [appreciating]{.underline}: • [the unquestionable
economic potential of creating a global transport, energy, and
telecommunications system with the key element being a land link between
the continents of Eurasia and America; • the urgency of combining
efforts to implement the project; • the advisability of further research
pertaining to the project; • the necessity for the participants of the
project, and members of the political and business communities of all
countries involved, to coordinate their activities]{.underline}, •
hereby put forward this proposal to the governments of Russia, the
U.S.A., Canada, Japan, China, Korea, and the EU member states: 1. We
propose that the countries assess the merits of the project for building
the ICL-World Link, at the level of ministries and agencies responsible
for this area, and its inclusion in their respective strategies of
economic development on the macroeconomic and industry levels. 2.
Provided that the construction of the ICL-World Link is deemed
advisable, [we propose that the governments appoint their
representatives for participation in further elaboration of the project,
and discussion of different options of the countries' involvement in
construction and operation]{.underline} of the ICLWorld Link. 3. We
propose that the [governments consider the financing of feasibility
studie]{.underline}s for constructing the ICL-World Link at the highest
international level in June 2007 within the framework of the G-8
meeting. [We propose that they pass a memorandum outlining the
governments' positions on developing the global transportation network,
and]{.underline} the feasibility of [building the ICLWorld Link as a key
element of providing intercontinental energy and infrastructural
ties]{.underline}. 4. We propose that a working group be created for
further elaboration and promotion of the project. We think it advisable
for the sources and amount of financing to be defined at this stage. 5.
We propose that the governments consider the appointment of the
international nonprofit organization IBSTRG as the authorized
international project coordinator for the duration of the feasibility
study of the ICL-World Link. All participating governments will have
representation on the IBSTRG Board of Directors. [Signed]{.underline}: •

At first glance, this map invokes the audience with a futuristic vision
of an elaborate high speed rail network connecting the globe, with
exciting possibilities such as traveling from New York to Paris on a
single train. The map appears to revolutionize the convenience and
accessibility of long distance international travel with ultra high
speed rail. While the map catches the eye of most for this reason, it is
important to note that transportation experts and the project proposal
itself agree that the true use-case for the Intercontinental Railway
would involve cargo and not passengers. [Transporting goods between
North and South America currently requires either crossing the Panama
Canal or taking lengthy, expensive sea routes. A faster, less expensive,
and more effective mode of transportation would be made available by the
Intercontinental Railway, which would result in significant cost savings
for both businesses and consumers]{.underline}. Its construction would
[enable seamless trading by rail between North and South America and
Eurasia]{.underline}. By enhancing trade, expanding markets, and
lowering transportation costs, [this integration could spur economic
growth in all of the regions connected by the railway]{.underline}.
Another [advantage]{.underline} of this project [is the]{.underline}
potential [reduction of fossil fuels]{.underline}. Although building
such a sizable railway network is a monumental construction project, [it
would result in more environmentally friendly transportation
options.]{.underline} Long-haul transportation's [greenhouse gas
emissions could be reduced by using electric trains that are powered by
renewable energy sources.]{.underline} The Intercontinental Railway
would [vastly diminish the frequency of highly polluting, fossil-fuel
burning cargo ships crossing the Pacific Ocean.]{.underline} Conversely,
many environmentalists hold significant concerns about both the initial
and long lasting effects the railway would have. Alaska and eastern
Russia are some of the most desolate and naturally undisturbed regions
in the world. The effect of an infrastructure project of this scale, as
well as the active disturbance of a rail line cutting through the
habitats of numerous species of wildlife would have disastrous effects
on the immediate ecosystem.

[Rail is the most energy efficient mode for freight
transport]{.underline}. Typically, it is [2.5 times more efficient than
trucks]{.underline}, using approximately 4 litres170 of fuel to move a
tonne of freight 753 km, 171 whereas trucks using the same amount of
fuel can only travel 241 km.172 As a result, [transporting 100 tonnes of
freight by rail over 100 km releases 0.15 tonnes of]{.underline} carbon
dioxide ( [CO2]{.underline}) or greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) [compared
to 0.67 tonnes]{.underline} of GHG if carried [by
truck]{.underline}*s*.173 Furthermore, [railways are]{.underline}
actively working on lowering their GHG emissions through the adoption of
new technologies and retrofits as well as operational practices,
including [switching to lower emission fuels and reducing
idling]{.underline}. Construction of the ACRL will [result in a higher
level of economic activity, while minimizing]{.underline} GHG [emissions
related to these activities, thus maintaining air quality]{.underline}.
It also [offers a smaller footprint and means of controlled access into
previously undeveloped areas]{.underline}, which will [result in less
disruption and unauthorized intrusion into these areas, helping to
preserve territorial rights and environmental values.]{.underline}

The [ACRL represents a game changing infrastructure investment for
mining in]{.underline} the Yukon, Northern BC and [Eastern
Alaska]{.underline}. The [rail line would reduce costs in exploration,
development, operations and exports]{.underline} thus [stimulating new
mining investment and development]{.underline}. It would also [both
improve and extend the economic viability of existing and new mines in
the region]{.underline}. The Yukon, Northern BC and Eastern Interior
[Alaska would]{.underline} all [enjoy economic spin off
benefits]{.underline} from these investments and heightened mining
activity in terms of higher royalty income, taxes as well [as population
and employment growth]{.underline} to be discussed later in this report.
This activity would [generate significant tonnage of minerals for export
as well as imports of fuel, materials and supplies and equipment over
all three phases of mining activity. Net revenue generated for the ACRL
from estimated metallic mineral exports alone]{.underline} from the
Yukon [could conservatively amount to \$43 million to \$247 million per
year,]{.underline} which would represent a net present value of between
\$700 million to \$3.8 billion over 30 years.61 [Industrial minerals and
coal exports]{.underline}62 [could add \$988 million per year in net
revenue]{.underline}, which would amount to \$15.2 billion over 30
years. [Imports of materials and supplies]{.underline} (excluding fuel)
[for mineral mines mine operations are estimated to add \$6.9 million to
\$59.3 million per year to ACRL revenues]{.underline}, which would have
a net present value of \$600 million to \$900 million over 30 years.
[Industrial minerals and coal could add another \$160 million to \$235
million]{.underline} in import annual revenues, which would have a net
present value over 30 years of \$2.4 billion to \$3.6 billion. Based on
the above, [estimated net revenue]{.underline} derived from Yukon mining
operation exports and imports, which excludes fuel, exploration and mine
development freight, [over 30 years are more than enough to cover the
capital cost of the ACRL construction]{.underline}. The ACRL represents
the embodiment of the Canadian government's Northern Corridor Initiative
aimed at stimulating economic development in the North by redressing its
infrastructure deficit and lack of tidewater access. The [proposed
railway could]{.underline} also [reduce]{.underline} the Canadian
government's [cost of remediation]{.underline} for the Faro Mine by
making importation of equipment and materials and remediation of waste
rock more economical. As well, it could possibly [enable additional
extraction of resources from]{.underline} the now [defunct mine, which
would help defray]{.underline} the current mine [maintenance costs and
offset]{.underline} some of the [remediation costs]{.underline}. In
addition, [by improving the economic viability and increasing mining
activity in this region richly endowed with critical and strategic earth
minerals, the ACRL would inevitably result in the extraction of more of
these resources,]{.underline} which is [a policy priority for the
US]{.underline} and would be of major benefit to Canada.

#### Mining -- by the numbers (extension):

Although less significant to the Alaskan economy due to the state's
broader diversification, the [mining sector]{.underline}, nevertheless,
[makes a sizable contribution to local and state governments and Alaska
Native Corporation]{.underline}s, contributing \$445.5 million (USD) in
2017. 30 The mining sector also spent almost \$420.3 million (USD) on
exploration and development, generated a gross income of \$2.7 billion
(USD), outlaid \$604 million (USD) in direct and indirect wages and
supported over 10,100 direct, indirect and induced jobs, representing
about [3% of total state employment]{.underline}.31 More importantly in
both jurisdictions, [mining employment typically provides higher paying
jobs than most other industries and job opportunities in remote and
rural areas]{.underline} where unemployment is often high. This is
[especially significant for First Nations' communities in these
areas]{.underline} both in terms of direct and indirect jobs and
business opportunities created to service the industry. The [Yukon and
Alaska's mineral potential was ranked #1 and #2 in the
world]{.underline} in 201532 based on its geologic attractiveness and
known mineral deposits. This includes [more than half of the minerals
classified as critical and strategic by the US Geological
Survey,]{.underline} which consist of mineral commodities that have
important manufacturing, technological and military uses and no viable
substitutes for everything from smartphones to weaponry, [yet these
essential minerals face potential disruption in supply]{.underline}.33 A
2014 report by the US Geological Survey34 reported that despite having
significant deposits of these minerals, the US currently relies on
imports for 90% of them from China. As a result, a US Presidential
Executive Order was issued in 201735 to increase discovery, access to,
development and production of these key resources. [Despite the mineral
richness of the Yukon and Alaska, high transportation and energy costs
have resulted in only the highest grade and tonnage
occurrences]{.underline}, which are in the upper 90th percentiles of
their type in the world and close to infrastructure, being economically
viable and some only marginally so. [For example, Alaska's Red Dog Mine,
the world\'s largest source of zinc and a significant source of lead, is
viable only because it is 84 km from the Chukchi Sea]{.underline}, where
concentrates are exported. Had the mine been located 300 km from
tidewater, it would not have been developed. In 2015, a consortium of
industry associations released a report [outlying]{.underline} the
[impediments to exploration and mining]{.underline} in remote and
Northern regions. 36 The study revealed that exploration was six times
more costly, mine development was 16% to two and a half times more
costly depending on the type of mine, and operations or production costs
are 30% to 60% higher depending on the commodity. The [chief
contributors to]{.underline} these [higher costs are logistics and
transport due]{.underline} largely [to]{.underline} the [lack of
existing infrastructure and the need for mines to both build and
maintain much of this]{.underline} as part of their operations,
including roads, camps and/or air facilities. [It]{.underline} also
[reflects the absence of more cost competitive rail
service.]{.underline} The current rail freight tariff is approximately
\$0.10 (CAD)37 per tonne km compared to \$0.33 for trucking38 39 in the
vicinity of the ACRL corridor and higher in more challenging areas over
rough terrain like the mostly gravel Dalton Highway, which provides
access to Alaska's north slope. Mining is also typified by short, sharp
peaks of activity followed by long, deep troughs linked to world
commodity price fluctuations. The impact of this pattern of extreme
price and activity fluctuation is intensified in the Yukon as well as
Alaska, where mine projects carry higher costs due to their remote,
Northern location, effectively shortening the window of opportunity for
economically viable production. The only means to mitigate this
susceptibility and improve viability is cost reduction. A 2015 study of
actual [exploration project costs]{.underline} by mining companies
confirmed that these costs [are directly linked to distance from
infrastructure]{.underline}.40 Costs for sites within 50 km of an
all-weather road were 41% less than those within 51 to 500 km. [Although
the ACRL route is near the]{.underline} Alaska [Highway]{.underline}
between Tok and Delta Junction, the Robert Campbell Highway between
Watson Lake and Carmacks and the Liard Highway for a very short section
north of Fort Nelson, [it also passes through about 750 km of terrain
without road access, which represents more than 40% of the rail
corridor]{.underline}. In addition, the Robert Campbell Highway is
mostly a gravel road, noted to be narrow and hazardous at times and
subject to closure in inclement weather. While identifying specific
sites, timing, expected expenditures and cost savings for exploration
would be speculative at best, [it is reasonable to conclude that
introduction of the ACRL into the corridor would lower exploration costs
by at least 41%]{.underline} in those areas more than 50 km from an
existing all-weather road, which represents an estimated 12 million
hectares. [It would also improve access and reliability and lower
transport costs for equipment, materials and fuel by at least
30%]{.underline} compared to truck transport as well as provide a
possible means of personnel transport to areas in the remaining sections
of the corridor now served by lower quality existing roads. The [lack of
infrastructure]{.underline}, including an economic means of exporting
mineral product from the region served by the ACRL corridor, [has
resulted in this area being underexplored.]{.underline} Furthermore,
[the incentive to move from exploration to production is limited without
an economic means of transporting mineral products for
export]{.underline}. However, [with lower cost and improved and more
reliable access, exploration in the corridor would become more
attractive. More exploration will result in more finds and certainly
better assessment of the tonnage and grade of resource
deposits.]{.underline} This, in turn, would improve the incentive to
move forward with mine development. Mine development in both the Yukon
and Eastern Alaska also involves significant additional expenditures due
to their remote and northern location and absence of infrastructure.
Incremental capital cost for mine development in these regions was
calculated to be double for a gold mine, two and a half times for base
metal mines and 15% to 20% higher for a diamond mine.41 These added
costs include provision of power plants, worker accommodation and other
related facilities, access roads and, in some cases, air strips to allow
fly-in, fly-out commuting by workers and contractors. It can also
necessitate additional storage facilities to offset either the inability
to export product or receive fuel, spare parts or equipment, when
required, due to access unreliability. Higher transportation and
logistics costs were found to be the main driver of these incremental
capital costs, accounting for over a third to almost half of these
costs, followed by power and fuel costs. [The ACRL would provide
significant savings fo]{.underline}r the [transport of construction
equipment, materials and fuel compared to trucking]{.underline} for all
but transport between the railway mainline and mine site.
[This]{.underline}, in turn, [would reduce the price of mine
construction]{.underline}. In addition, [the ACRL could also potentially
reduce or shorten access roads]{.underline} that mining companies must
construct and maintain. For example, the current capital cost for
constructing and maintaining a two-lane gravel access road is
approximately \$1.4 million per km and \$25,200 per km per year
respectively. [If an access road was shortened by 50 km, this would
result in a capital cost saving of \$70 million]{.underline} and an
annual maintenance saving of \$1.26 million or \$37.8 million in current
dollars over 30 years. The [availability of regular and reliable rail
service also opens the possibility of workers being able to commute to
mine sites from existing communities]{.underline} rather than require
costly camp installations. It might also [remove the need for air
facilities at a mine]{.underline}, if the rail service enabled access to
existing airports at communities served by the railway. A further
consideration is that the [rail line has a smaller footprint than access
roads and, because access is controlled, it avoids unauthorized entry
and reduces environmental impacts to undeveloped areas.]{.underline}
These advantages could [factor positively in the environmental and
social license approval processes]{.underline} for new mines that could
translate into time savings and lower costs to achieve these approvals.
As stated earlier, operating costs for remote and northern mines have
been found to be 30% to 60% higher than mines in more accessible
regions. As in mine development, higher transportation and logistics
costs are the main drivers of these incremental operating costs,
followed by power and fuel costs. As illustrated below, [transportation
and logistics are the largest contributors to incremental operating
costs]{.underline} for remote and Northern mines. The largest demand for
transportation is for the export of metallic mineral concentrates or ore
products followed by import of equipment, materials and supplies and
transport of personnel to and from the mine site. Two approaches were
used to estimate the potential mineral export freight from mines in the
ACRL corridor as follows: Priority Deposits or "Bottom Up" Approach42 --
This approach was based on selecting a priority list of proposed mine
projects in the corridor from the Yukon and BC mineral inventories. The
selection criteria used was that they be near development with bulk
shippable commodities (i.e., not precious metal mines) that had more
than 40 million tonnes of mineral reserve. The resulting priority list
consisted of 13 deposits in the Yukon. These sites are the most advanced
in their development and were considered the most likely to come into
operation early in the life cycle of the railway (i.e., 30 years). To
put this limited selection in context, 136 metallic mineral deposits
were subject to exploration in the Yukon in 2017, of which 112 were gold
properties and 37 were other hard mineral deposits.43 The likelihood for
development of the 13 priority projects was then assessed based on 2017
mineral commodity price forecasts for three scenarios (i.e., optimistic,
median and pessimistic) and current estimates of mine operating costs44
derived either from published feasibility studies or mining engineering
cost guidelines45. The three metal price forecast scenarios were based
on a simple regression analysis of historic data projected over 30
years, with one standard deviation above and below determining the
optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. Based on the above, an estimate of
annual shippable mineral commodities under various metal price scenarios
was developed. However, this [estimate should be considered short-term
and conservative]{.underline} because transport costs to market were
excluded as were potential capital and operating cost savings resulting
from ACRL development, which would improve the economic viability of
these projects at lower commodity price levels. Also, the assessment
only includes mineral deposits that are well-advanced, with known
quantities of minerals and with long-term economic viability. It
excludes: - potential bulk shippable commodities from Alaska; - smaller,
marginal deposits that may come into production during high metal price
cycles but may be short lived, even though collectively, they could
provide a significant source of freight over time to the railway; - less
developed deposits as well as new and unknown deposits that may be found
over the life cycle of the railway; - potential freight from very large
mineral occurrences outside the corridor that could support the
development cost of longer supply infrastructure, such as the Crest Iron
Ore deposit in the Central Yukon for which the estimated output is 12
billion tonnes46; and, - coal exports given low current and projected
price. Long Term Probabilistic or "Top Down" Approach47 -- The second
approach broadened the mineral export potential analysis by examining
the probability of development of the over 1,700 known metallic mineral
deposits plus larger potential for industrial and coal deposits in the
Yukon and Northern BC within 80 km (50 miles) on either side of the ACRL
route.48 It should be noted that another 590 known deposits are located
on the US section of the rail link corridor but were not included in the
analysis to maintain comparability with the priority deposit approach.
The probabilistic model was based on past surveys of major mineral
exploration firms by various Canadian federal and provincial agencies
collecting and disseminating mineral industry data. The model was run
with tonnage and grade curves for the known metallic mineral occurrences
in the corridors at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the
worldwide occurrences.49 The model considered metal prices, assumed
mining and mineral processing methods and estimated quantitative
deposits associated with grade and tonnage50, to determine an estimate
of in-place gross metal value and tonnage of mineral concentrates and
potential metallic mineral freight volumes that could be carried by the
ACRL. Only metallic mineral occurrences with validated mineral deposits
were included in the analysis. As a result, the estimate, although
presenting a longer-term perspective, is also conservative as it does
not include: - potential bulk shippable commodities from Alaska; -
mineral prospects that are in the early stage of exploration and
evaluation; - potential for additional mineral development resulting
from new exploration activities that are likely to occur after the rail
line is operational; - potential freight from very large mineral
occurrences outside the corridor that could support the development cost
of longer supply infrastructure, such as the Crest Iron Ore deposit in
the Central Yukon for which the estimated output is 12 billion tonnes51;
and, - the shipment of low-grade bog iron deposits from northwestern
Alberta. Estimates of Annual Potential Mineral Freight Volumes The
assessment of the 13 priority deposits (Approach 1) resulted in a
short-term estimate of potential average annual mineral exports ranging
from a low of 1.6 million tonnes to a high of 3.0 million tonnes from
the Yukon only. The gross value of these mineral exports based on 2017
average commodity prices conservatively ranges from [\$9 billion to
\$16.5 billion per year. Potential average annual net revenue to the
ACRL for transporting these minerals for export Is estimated to be
approximately \$43 million to \$81 million]{.underline}52 per year
depending on the tonnage achieved. The probabilistic model (Approach 2),
on the other hand, predicts that, [if the railway was present, all
metallic mines at the upper 90th percentile in tonnage and grade in the
rail corridor would be developed over the next 30 years]{.underline}.
The [estimated]{.underline} in-place [gross]{.underline} metal [value of
these mines is \$373 to \$732 billion]{.underline},53 which is
equivalent to one to two large copper porphyry mines. The expected
outbound freight from these mines is 269 million tonnes54 of metallic
mineral concentrate over 30 years or an average of [9 million tonnes per
year]{.underline}. The [potential average annual revenue or net cash
flow to the ACRL would be \$247 million from Canadian mineral exports
alone]{.underline}. By lowering transportation cost for mineral
concentrate exports as well as mine transportation capital and
maintenance costs and imports of energy and other materials that are
inputs to mine production, [the railway is also expected to increase the
economic viability of metallic mineral deposits in the 50th to 90th
percentile range in terms of tonnage and grade]{.underline}. While these
mines will be smaller, they are also likely to be more numerous and
possibly closer to existing remote communities, where unemployment is
high and cash income and expenditures are scarce. In addition, [marginal
production in less valuable sections of existing and expected metallic
mines in the upper 90th percentile in future could become more
profitable to develop]{.underline} thus [extending mine life. This in
turn would generate additional mineral freight traffic and revenue for
the railway.]{.underline}Potential Industrial Mineral and Coal Export
Freight on ACRL Globally, metallic minerals only constitute 25% of total
mineral resource value produced annually. Industrial minerals
(non-metallic minerals) and coal account for 75% (petroleum and natural
gas excluded). The latter are generally low unit value commodities that
must be transported on rail or on water. Experience shows that as mines
and communities develop along the rail corridor, demand for energy and
industrial minerals locally will increase. Based on the gross metal
value of metallic minerals, non-metallic minerals and coal generally
results in four times the tonnage of metallic mineral tonnages. Applying
this precedent to the probabilistic model's estimate, the [estimated
freight tonnage of industrial minerals and coal exports is]{.underline}
1.1 billion tonnes over 30 years or [36 million tonnes
annually]{.underline}. If realized, this could result in \$[988 million
in annual revenue for the ACRL from Canada alone]{.underline}. As
previously cited, the priority deposits assessment (Approach 1)
purposely excluded coal due to its low current and projected prices as
well as industrial minerals in its analysis. Potential Fuel and Other
Supply Material Freight Imports on ACRL Mines also require a large
quantities inbound freight of fuel and other materials used in
construction, mining, mineral processing, tailings disposal and personal
support. A survey of Alaskan metallic mineral mines revealed that they
annually require between 36,000 and 55,000 tonnes of inbound freight
(excluding fuel).55 However, the Donlin Gold project, which is a
large-scale surface mine, is projected to require 95,250 tonnes of
general cargo per year to sustain operations and approximately 450,000
to 550,000 tonnes of material and equipment during mine development.56
Based on the priority deposits assessment (Approach 1) and the 2017
average volumes cited above, this would represent another 252,000 to
715,000 tonnes of material per year to the Yukon during their operation.
The potential [revenue contribution]{.underline} that the [inbound
freight would add to the ACRL would range from \$6.9 million per year to
\$19.6 million per year]{.underline} (excluding fuel) [from metallic
mineral mines]{.underline}*.* As one of the priority deposit mines (the
Casino mine) is more comparable to the Donlin project, this estimate is
likely low. [Fuel transport is another major factor for many mines and
would result in additional rail tonnage and revenues.]{.underline} For
example, the proposed Casino mine 200 km northwest of Carmacks estimates
annual imports of 33.0 million litres of liquid natural gas (LNG) and
26.0 million litres of diesel fuel during construction and 360.0 million
of LNG and 32.0 million litres of diesel fuel during operations.57
Casino also estimates importing over 6,000 tonnes of equipment during
construction and another 11,000 tonnes over the first seven years of
operation. Imports of materials and general cargo would be over and
above these figures. As the probabilistic approach (Approach 2)
estimates the volume of tonnage and not the number of mining operations,
the estimating method used for Approach 1 cannot be applied. Assuming a
correlation exists between the volume of inbound freight required to
generate outbound freight, the estimate of inbound freight derived in
Approach 1 suggests that inbound freight is 16% to 24% of outbound
tonnage. Based on the probabilistic assessment (Approach 2) and the
above percentages[, metallic mineral mines could generate 1.4 million to
2.2 million tonnes of inbound freight per year, annually generating
conservatively between \$39.5 million to \$59.3 million in net revenue
for the ACRL]{.underline}. Adding the potential for industrial minerals
and coal mine import requirements could increase this volume [by 5.8 to
8.6 million tonnes per year]{.underline} contributing another [\$159
million to \$236 million in net revenue to the ACRL.]{.underline}
However, the above estimates of inbound freight only reflect materials
and supplies once the projected mines are in operation. It excludes fuel
as well as imported equipment, construction materials and supplies that
would be required during exploration and construction of mines within
the corridor that would also benefit from lower cost rail transport.
Other Mining Related Benefits from the ACRL [Construction of the ACRL
also offers a means to reduce the cost of remediation of the Faro
lead-zinc mine]{.underline}. Once the world's largest lead-zinc mine, it
has been inactive since 1982, a victim of falling world prices for
lead-zinc and the high cost of transportation for the mine's exports and
imports. When closed, the mine left a legacy of 70 million tonnes of
tailings and 320 million tonnes of waste rock, which require disposal.
Responsibility for clean-up fell to the Yukon and Government of Canada
upon bankruptcy of the mine's owners in 1998 and is estimated will cost
over \$1 billion dollars. Maintaining the mine for safety reasons also
costs the federal government approximately \$40 million annually. The
[presence of the ACRL would both facilitate and offer a cheaper means of
delivering equipment and supplies for this clean-up and
remediation]{.underline} of waste rock and other materials. It could
also [make development and extraction of residual resource]{.underline}
at Faro [economically viable, which in turn could help offset the costs
of]{.underline} both interim [maintenance and remediation]{.underline}.
A further benefit of the ACRL is [enabling the extraction of strategic
and critical minerals and rare earths, on which advanced technology and
manufacturing depend]{.underline}. It will also [very likely assist in
discovery of yet unknown deposits of these elements]{.underline} given
the geological providence of the region and large areas that have been
inaccessible for economic exploration. [This is important because the
US, once self-reliant in rare earth metal production, now sources 90% of
its requirements from China, which dominates this global
market]{.underline}.58 This [raises both economic and national security
concerns about adequate, stable and reliable supply of these important
elements particularly in light of the current US/China trade
dispute]{.underline}. It is therefore not surprising that the US federal
government responding to the US Presidential Executive Order 13817 have
embarked on developing a strategy to address the critical and strategic
mineral supply problem59. For Canada, extraction and processing of rare
earth minerals offers a tremendous opportunity as it not only has some
of the world's [largest rare earth deposits but also expertise in
processing them.]{.underline} The Canadian government is also in the
process of developing a national minerals and metals plan60, which
includes addressing the infrastructure gap which hampers mining in
remote areas, including the Yukon. The [known presence of at least half
of the 35 critical minerals designated by the US Geological Survey in
the ACRL rail corridor means that the ACRL]{.underline} supports the
Canadian federal policy objective regarding mineral development and
[will also make a crucial contribution to the US's policy
objectives]{.underline} set out in the Presidential Executive order
referenced above.

Several hundred people gathered in Moscow on April 24 at a conference
called "Megaprojects of Russia's East: A Transcontinental
Eurasia-America Transport Link via the Bering Strait." News of their
discussions touched off a wave of optimistic [thinking in many
countrie]{.underline}s, that [the time has arrived for one of the
greatest of great infrastructure projects: a tunnel beneath the Bering
Strait between the U.S. state of Alaska and Russia's Chukotka
Region.]{.underline} The participants issued an appeal to governments of
the Group of Eight member countries, to place the Bering Strait
megaproject on the agenda of the G-8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany, in
June (see p. 43). Russia's Ambassador to Canada Georgi Mamedov told the
Toronto Globe and Mail that he is now optimistic that the tunnel will be
built. Mamedov [expects]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin to
discuss the Bering Strait project with Canadian P]{.underline}rime
[M]{.underline}inister Stephen Harper, when they meet in Heiligendamm.
"We need Canada aboard," he said. It is fitting that two American
participants from the World War II generation put forward the idea that
such great development projects are the path leading away from war. They
were [former U.S. Secretary of the Interior and Governor of Alaska,
Walter Hickel, a strong backer of the Bering Strait tunnel
project]{.underline} for many years, and economist and EIR founder,
Lyndon LaRouche.1 LaRouche, who as early as 1978 called for a Bering
Strait bridge-tunnel crossing, wrote a conference presentation, "The
World's Political Map Changes: Mendeleyev Would Have Agreed," in
response to a request from conference organizers. His contribution was
read to the gathering and will appear in a publication in connection
with the event. The [Americans radiated confidence that the Bering
Strait project can be done, bringing North America into the Eurasian
development perspective that is otherwise being promoted
through]{.underline} such [agencies]{.underline} as the [Shanghai
Cooperation Or]{.underline}ganization. [It would be]{.underline}, as
LaRouche said in Moscow in 2001, part of "[the greatest transformation
of the biosphere in history."]{.underline} High-level Russian
specialists from Federal agencies, regional governments, and the Russian
Academy of Sciences took part in the Bering Strait meeting, along with
specialists from Japan and Korea. It was the first of a "Megaprojects of
Russia's East" conference series, organized by the Russian Academy of
Sciences Council for the Study of Productive Forces (SOPS), in
conjunction with the Russian Ministry of Economic Development and Trade
(MERT), the Russian Ministry of Transport, the state-owned company
Russian Railroads, and several regional governments in Siberia and the
Russian Far East. [Victor Razbegin]{.underline}, who [works in the
Ministry of Economic Development]{.underline} and Trade's Industrial
Research department, gave a press conference on April 18 with other
members of the Bering Strait project group, to publicize the forthcoming
conference. Their huge map of the Arctic connection, and their
[enthusiasm for the]{.underline} \$65 billion [multi-modal project, with
its associated long-distance rail and power lines, grabbed headlines in
Russia]{.underline}. More than 60 stories about it appeared in press,
web, and other electronic media, including a report on NTV, Russian
national television Channel 2. NTV showed a dynamic map of the projected
rail line from Yakutsk in East Siberia, through Nome and Fairbanks, to
Fort Nelson in Canada. Academician Alexander Granberg, head of the
Council for the Study of Productive Forces, described the project's
advantages, in an April 16 interview for the economics website OPEC.ru.
He said [the road, rail, and pipeline connection would handle 3 percent
of total world trade in physical goods. It will make it possible to
harness more of eastern Russia's hydroelectric potential.]{.underline}
It will [allow development of previously inaccessible mineral resource
deposits]{.underline}. And, said Granberg, [the connection of the power
systems of Siberia, the Russian Far East, and North America will create
economies in electricity supply, worth \$20 billion annually. Russia's
leadership]{.underline}, according to Granberg, now [sees the
development of transportation infrastructure as essential for uplifting
Russia's vast outlying regions]{.underline}. Demonstration of this, he
said, was an April 10 presentation by Vladimir Yakunin, head of the
state-owned company Russian Railways, at a meeting on rail transport,
chaired by Putin. There, Yakunin laid out the construction of a 3,500-km
rail line from the Lena River to the Bering Strait, as a high-priority
task. The Lena is the easternmost of Siberia's three great river
systems, and is the tenth longest river in the world.

What is being proposed is a [multi-mode energy and transportation
system, between Russia and Alaska, at the critical juncture point
between the Eastern and the Western Hemispheres of the
world]{.underline} \[Figure 1\]. And the [ultimate
objective]{.underline} of that, [is not only to promote transportation
and energy transfer, but to bring about a political and economic
realignment of the world]{.underline}. And ultimately that gets back to
what Helga \[Zepp-LaRouche\] spoke about earlier, about the so-called
[Four-Power Alliance]{.underline}, Four-Power Agreement, this [being
Russia, China, India, and the United States]{.underline}---which is
ultimately the objective---and a necessity for the Bering Strait tunnel
to be built. It is not just about transportation logistics \[Figure 2\].
FIGURE 1 Proposed Route of the Interhemispheric Railroad To Connect
Alaska and Chukotka Through the Bering Strait Railroad Tunnel. Now, what
is proposed would be [an electric railroad]{.underline}---not diesel,
but electric---[in combination with a natural-gas pipeline, electric
transmission, and fiber-optic telecommunications]{.underline}. At this
point, we don't see water transfers taking place through a tunnel, but
we do see water transfers taking place on the approaching railroads in
both North America and Asia. You saw earlier today, during Helga's
presentation, the North American Water and Power Alliance, which would
be bringing water from the Yukon and Mackenzie river basins of
northwestern Canada, and Alaska, and the coastal-range-mountain short
rivers, through trenches, aqueducts, and pipelines, to the lower 48
states of the United States, and ultimately to Mexico. Helga did not
mention this, but another program that has been proposed by a LaRouche
associate in Mexico, Manuel Frias, talks about water transfer projects
from the southern part of Mexico, to the northern part, from the
water-abundant regions of the Yucatan Peninsula, to the north, to the
water-scarce regions. And this would be going from south to north, at
the same time that the North American Water and Power Alliance would be
bringing water from north to south, [making all of this entire region
productive for agriculture, industry, population development, and
reversing this endless pattern of decline that we have seen for so many
years]{.underline}, since 1971. Now, what was proposed earlier goes
back---believe it or not, the first time someone proposed building a
tunnel under the Bering Strait, was by the governor of the Territory of
Colorado, before it became a state, William Gilpin. He proposed building
railroads from the 48 states---well, there weren't 48 states then, there
were still a lot of territories---from the United States, up through
Canada, to Alaska, and then coming from Asia. There were several other
proposals made between then, and the turn of the century---some serious,
and some not so serious, the most serious of which was in 1906, by a
jointly owned company of Russian, French, and American investors, who
actually raised \$6 million. They did feasibility studies, and they
began to raise \$50 million to get started with construction. Britain
and the Politics of Oil When one reads the book by William Engdahl about
oil \[A Century of War: Anglo-American Oil Politics and the New World
Order\], it is Mr. Engdahl's [hypothesis that this is the reason the
British oligarchy started World War I, because they did not want land
connections extending the railroad developments in the United States and
Canada, between East and West, and in Russia, along the Trans-Siberian
\[Railway\],]{.underline} between West and East, to connect. I
personally agree with that. That's exactly why World War I was started.
And of course, [the opposition of the British oligarchy to developing
the Bering Strait has never changed.]{.underline} Now, we see a
connection between Alaska and Chukotka, which is the region of Russia
right across the Bering Strait from Alaska, from a place called
Egvekinot \[Russia\], population 4,000, a gold-mining and fishing
center, to Fairbanks, Alaska, a city of 80,000 people, some industry,
some military, a supply center for the central part of Alaska, with a
950-mile corridor, approximately 1,600 kilometers between the center of
Alaska, and the center of Chukotka, from which rail lines will connect
to the southeast, to the main part of the United States. It will come to
a place called Prince George, British Columbia, and to Dawson Creek,
British Columbia, where major connections with the existing North
American rail system can take place. And on the Russian side, a
connection to Yakutsk, to the south, and to the Trans-Siberian and
Baikal-Amur Mainline. . . . And also, connections to the west of Russia.
During Stalin's time, in the 1930s, studies were actually undertaken,
routes laid out, of a near-polar mainline along the south shore of the
Arctic Ocean in Russia, and also a line going to the southwest, to
connect to the Trans-Siberian Railway. And [Russia has always taken a
greater interest in the connection through the Bering Strait
than]{.underline} has [the United States.]{.underline} And what we've
seen ever since Harry Truman, is opposition. Believe it or not, in 1941,
at the beginning of World War II, when Pearl Harbor was attacked, Stalin
asked Roosevelt to send Harry Hopkins to Moscow, right after the attack,
in late December of 1941. How could the United States supply Russia?
Ships? Airplanes? And even the possibility of trains, and there was only
one connection point, the Bering Strait. At the time, it was felt that
it was too difficult a logistical connection---it would take too long to
build, it would be too much money, and so forth. But studies had already
been done under Stalin. Actually, one of the reasons those studies were
done, was actually to connect the concentration camp zones, where there
was gold-mining, and other things going on. I understand today there is
a renewed interest in mining activities of gold and other minerals in
that region of Russia, and that is a very important thing, but not the
major reason why we would develop these rail systems. It's really for
economic development, and political integration. Now, when we build a
tunnel, we build it through a combination of granite and limestone---it
is relatively easy to dig, it's just that the rock is generally hard,
and it's going to take some time, but we would put it about 100 feet
below the water level, and the water would be about 60 to 70 meters
deep, 180-200 feet. There are two islands in the middle: Little Diomede
on the United States side, and Big Diomede on the Russian side. There
are 200 people, Native people, who live on Little Diomede. Big Diomede
is a weather station, and military base, with Russia. Double-track
railroad. Center utility tunnel, just like we have at the English
Channel. And there is another tunnel, actually being built right now,
connecting Europe and Asia, at the Bosporus, between the European and
Asian sides of Istanbul, Turkey, called the Marmaray railway tunnel.
It's about 12 kilometers long, 8 miles, approximately. It's a trench
where precast concrete sections are placed at the bottom of the trench,
and then at the ends there will be tunnel bores to take it to near the
surface. Commuter trains and high-speed intercity passenger trains would
run during the day; freight trains at night. That is the western end of
the Eurasian Land-Bridge. And the Bering Strait would be, really, the
eastern end. Electric Power and Water-Transfer Now, I would forecast,
and have proposed, a gas pipeline from Russia to Alaska, in a separate
tube; an electric transmission line, probably using superconducting
cables, because [we can transmit very large amounts of electricity with
minimal losses. And we would also be able to transfer electricity back
and forth between Asia and North America; as the time of the day
changes, and the peaks change, we can help equalize the
loads,]{.underline} and, of course, [it would also provide a means to
facilitate the development of northern Alaska, and northeastern Russia:
a critical component.]{.underline} Now, on the water-transfer side, it
isn't directly a part of the Bering Strait tunnel, but of the
approaching rail lines, it is. On the Alaska-Canada rail side, the North
American Water and Power Alliance. That's already been talked about
today, and we will be hearing a lot more about it in the future. On the
Asian side, it's possible, as Helga mentioned, to take water from the
Irtysh and some of the other rivers in Siberia, all of which flow north
into the Arctic, and pump them to the South to refill the Aral Sea.
Actually, we could put it in other places as well. And that would
certainly help agriculture in that region. Unfortunately, the Aral Sea
has always been shown as an example of what's wrong with water transfer.
The problem is, it was never done right. And they didn't transfer water
to where it was really needed to be. And of course, the McKenzie River
in Canada, the Yukon River in Alaska and Canada, and then, on the
Russian side, the Ob, the Irtysh, the Lena, the Yenesei, and the Kolyma,
all flow north into the Arctic Ocean, and can provide substantial water.
So that's another issue. Possibly we [could put in a fiber-optic
telecommunications cable]{.underline}---that's a relatively minimal cost
issue. So, we would have a utility/pipeline/railroad corridor. I would
also propose building po[wer plants, to supply the
electricity]{.underline}---I estimate it would take about 2,000
megawatts, of which half would be for the railroad, and half for the
local economic development of that region. There's a lot of mining on
both sides. There's gold mining in Chukotka. There's other mining,
especially to the west of the Sakha Republic. There's gold mining and
other mining in Alaska. There's the lead and zinc mine at Red Dog. There
are very large coal reserves in the Point Lay region of northwestern
Alaska. Some of that could go to China, and I propose hauling it by
rail, some of it. It's very low-sulphur, very high-grade coal, and it
could be used for some of the small industrial boilers in China, as well
as home heating and cooking. There are some people, but not all, who
forecast that coal production in China may be falling, but demand
continues to rise. It's on its way down. China just signed an agreement
with Australia to purchase 300 million tons of coal, for 20 years, being
shipped out of Newcastle to China, and maybe there will be more in the
future. I suspect there probably will. But it's just one more reason to
build the tunnel. Now, the tunnel would be 100 kilometers long. The
railroad itself would be 1,500 kilometers long, between Egvekinot,
Chukotka and Fairbanks, Alaska. But we're actually looking at connecting
the main rail systems---together, we're actually looking at about 8,000
kilometers, about 5,000 miles, with major connections on each side. The
end point cities on each side of the Bering Strait: You will end in
Uelen, which is a fishing village of about 300 people, and Wales,
Alaska, which is a similar place, with about 200 people. In terms of the
cost, my estimate is that the tunnel itself is going to cost about \$25
billion, and the entire rail system, connecting Fairbanks and Egvekinot,
is about \$45 billion. It would cost approximately \$10 billion for the
natural-gas pipeline, in that section, and approximately \$10 billion
for the high-voltage superconducting cable electricity in that section,
as well. And my estimate of the traffic: It would be increasing in the
first year from 25 million tons a year, to about 270 million tons a
year, by 2050, the starting point being between 2020 and 2022. And
passenger service would provide approximately 5% of the revenue, 10% of
the number of trains. To have passengers would be nice, but that is
certainly not the main reason. Interestingly enough, I did some studies
on container movements between China and the United States, specifically
between Xian, in Central China, and Chicago. It would take 8 to 10 days
to ship that container by rail, 1 day by plane, 20 to 24 days by the
existing ship-rail system, and 30 days if you went through the new
Panama Canal, when it's completed, and then shipped the container by
rail at the end. So, there is a definite time-savings as well. And
potentially, a cost saving. My estimate is that with the exception of
all-water shipping, the rail would be competitive, and probably 5-10%
less than shipping through the conventional ship-rail system, to the
United States. A Million New Jobs Now, what would it do in terms of
employment? My estimate is that the construction itself would create
between 25,000 and 50,000 jobs directly, and the operation would take
between 10,000 and 15,000 people, when all the aspects, related
maintenance, and operations, plus ancillary activities, are considered.
And the indirect jobs would be those, the multiplier of 2.5 to 3, or
whatever it comes out to---somewhere between 90,000 and 160,000 jobs.
So, you're really [looking at between 700,000 and 1.2 million new
jobs]{.underline}, when all economic activities are considered. But
what's also going to happen is, [Alaska and Chukotka are going to become
the centers of trade for the world]{.underline}. When you go there now,
you would say, that's a pretty far fetch. But, when you have companies
like UPS and Federal Express, and others, which would make use of that
kind of service, with the trains running at 70 to 90 miles an hour,
which can be relatively easily done, and of course, some people have
suggested magnetic levitation. Personally, I think that's something
that's a separate system---we'd have to add another tube for it. Gauges:
The standard of Europe, Western Europe, and the United States and China,
and many other countries of the world, with standard gauges, 4 feet 8½
inches, 1,435 millimeters. The Russian gauge is 1,520 millimeters or 5.0
feet; it's just different enough that you can't run a train from one
gauge onto the other. The Koreans, the Polish, and the Spanish have come
up with different systems---either cars or locomotives---that can be
changed from one trackage to the other. Now, China has announced that
it's going to build a new rail line, from Urumqi in western China, in
conjunction with the countries along the route, Kazakstan, Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan, Iran, and Turkey---a standard gauge line, all the way
through Central Asia, connected to Iran at Mashad, and then all the way
to Tehran, and all the way to Istanbul. They also proposed building a
line from Kunming in southwestern China, through Myanmar, and India,
Pakistan, Iran, to connect at Tehran, to this system. Just last month,
there was a train that went from Istanbul, carrying containers all the
way to Islamabad in Pakistan, and back. And there's a new commercial
service that just started---that, of course, is the Eurasian
Land-Bridge. But it would connect, ultimately, to the lines going to the
Bering Strait. You will become an expert in geography studying where all
these routes are. Going from a place called Ust-Kut, on the Baikal-Amur
Mainline, to the northeast to Lensk, in the southwest of the Sakha
Republic (Yakutia), and then across the new bridge between Haptagay and
Tabaga, which is probably the most formidable single infrastructure
project in this whole area, except for the tunnel itself. And when I
spoke with Mr. Yakunin, he said, well, we're going to have to get that
problem resolved first, and the problem is primarily an economic one, in
that it costs almost as much to build a 5 kilometer bridge as it does a
500 kilometer railroad, because of the complexities involved: that
you're going to need natural-gas pipelines, and oil pipelines, and water
pipelines and roads and rails, and electric utilities, because
everything has to go across the same bridge. I have in my paper a
painting, which was done by the ever-popular Craig Thorpe, the noted
railroad artist---some of you have seen his work, including on the
Bering Strait tunnel, as it was presented in Kiedrich, in the 2007 event
\[Figure 3\]. So, it is very important that all these things fit
together as a system. And I can tell you, from having read the recent
Russian Railways annual report---and I think our next speaker is going
to discuss this in more detail---that [there really are some advanced
network plans going. And in fact, the Russian Railway has a very orderly
20-year plan, to build out to the Bering Strait, from the present end of
its railroad, lacking a major international initiative to put all this
together.]{.underline} What Are the Benefits? Now, why do we want to
build it? What are the benefits? Well, we certainly know about the jobs.
[We would create many jobs and new businesses. We would reduce transit
times, and probably costs. We would create a land-based corridor without
any maritime connection, so there isn't going to be any more finagling
of breaking up everybody into little groups, so they can all be
controlled and manipulated against each other]{.underline}. That's very
important. I think coal shipments to China, oil shipments to the United
States---some of it could go by rail---are important. But I think that
the Four-Power Agreement of Russia, China, India, and the United States,
as Helga mentioned, is really one of the ultimate objectives. But there
is an even more important objective. And that is, [creating a world rail
system from Cape Horn, at the bottom of South America, to Cape Good
Hope, at the bottom of Africa, and everything in-between, to create
growth and prosperity, and end the reign of the British

### Trains key:

#### High Speed Rail is key to economic growth and one of the best forms of transportation

As demand for high-speed rail (HSR) continues to grow, the [U.S. rail
industry stands at the precipice of a transformative era]{.underline}.
While many are familiar with HSR's potential to revolutionize travel,
fewer may appreciate the far-reaching beneﬁts it can bring to the
freight rail industry and broader rail ecosystem. According to Andy
Byford, Amtrak's senior vice president of [high-speed rail]{.underline},
this mode of transit [presents a unique opportunity for the U.S. to
reinvest in domestic manufacturing while creating economic ripples
across sectors.]{.underline} "HSR [promotes American competitiveness in
the global economy for key manufacturing sectors, like steel for track,
electrical components for signaling systems, and car
equipment]{.underline}," Byford says. "With our large, skilled, and
widely dispersed workforce, [the U.S. is well-positioned to build from
within and beneﬁt from the multiplier effects of investment in the
supply chain]{.underline}." This [reinvigoration of the manufacturing
sector could generate wealth]{.underline}, even in regions not directly
served by HSR, [expanding job opportunities and fostering economic
growth nationwide.]{.underline} A critical aspect of HSR's impact is its
contribution to workforce development. Byford pointed out that [HSR
investments will "strengthen the pipeline of skilled craftspeople and
knowledge sector workers]{.underline} --- for example, by supporting new
investment in centers of excellence at higher-education institutions
across the country." And there's data to back this up. According to the
American Public Transportation Association (APTA), 24,000 jobs are
supported across economic sectors by every \$1 billion invested in HSR.
"[Substantial initial investment in passenger rail and HSR provides
returns on investment for a generation]{.underline}," Byford says.
Testing the Waters in Dallas-Houston One key project driving Amtrak's
HSR development is the Dallas-Houston corridor, a prime example of a
route with optimal conditions for success. Byford explains that HSR
works best when it connects cities with high travel demand and limited
travel alternatives. "With over 12 million total trips between Dallas
and Houston in 2022, there is signiﬁcant travel demand between these
destinations," Byford says. Amtrak's proposed 240-mile HSR route, which
had previously been developed by a private entity for over a decade,
hits the sweet spot in terms of distance, and both cities are major
metropolitan areas with growing economies. The choice of this corridor
reﬂects global best practices, where HSR is most effective in connecting
regions with signiﬁcant population density and suboptimal alternatives
like car and air travel. If successful, this project could pave the way
for more HSR initiatives across the country. Collaboration Between
Passenger and Freight Rail [HSR doesn't just beneﬁt the passenger side
of the rail industry. "Any investment in rail, passenger or freight,
expands our industry and creates mutual beneﬁts,]{.underline}" Byford
says. HSR [can stimulate the entire rail manufacturing supply chain,
supporting conventional rail and freight services as well]{.underline}.
While true HSR requires dedicated infrastructure to avoid conﬂicts
between freight and passenger service, it's possible for higher-speed
passenger rail to coexist within the current ecosystem. "For some
corridors, higher-speed passenger rail could be the right travel
product. Where existing rights-of-way can be upgraded for faster, more
frequent passenger service, the entire rail industry beneﬁts," Byford
says. There are also [lessons freight can learn from HSR]{.underline},
particularly when it comes to safety. "[Japan's Shinkansen network has
transported over 10 billion passengers since 1964 without a single
train-caused fatality]{.underline}," Byford says. "Sharing insights into
best practices for passenger safety can help brainstorm solutions for
freight." Why HSR Is a Critical Piece of the Transit Puzzle [HSR will
play an important role in the future of American transportation,
offering economic, social, and environmental beneﬁts]{.underline}. "HSR
offers better connectivity with more travel choices and gets travelers
to their destinations more reliably, and often more quickly," Byford
says. In terms of sustainability, [HSR leads the way, being eight times
more energy-efficient than ﬂying and four times more efficient than
driving.]{.underline} This makes [HSR a key player in addressing current
and future transportation needs, while also minimizing environmental
impacts. "With a smaller physical footprint, less noise pollution, and
zero emissions, HSR can add signiﬁcant capacity to our existing
transportation network with a lower impact to surrounding land uses than
a new highway or airport,"]{.underline} Byford says. A New Era of Rail
in America The U.S. is embarking on a new era of rail investment, one
that holds promise for modernizing trains, upgrading stations, and
building new infrastructure. "We're enhancing the customer experience,
improving safety and reliability, driving economic development, reducing
trip times, and advancing sustainability," Byford says. [Momentum is
growing, with historic levels of funding and new federal ﬁnancing
mechanisms making it easier for rail projects to secure necessary
support. "It's time to keep building on this momentum and deliver
additional state-of-the-art transportation]{.underline} beneﬁts [for the
American people,"]{.underline} Byford says. With these developments on
the horizon, the future of HSR in the U.S. looks bright---not only for
passengers, but for the freight industry that will beneﬁt from a
strengthened, interconnected rail ecosystem too.

| The [oil and gas industry is the largest component of Alaska's        |
| economy]{.underline}. Nearly 85 percent of the state budget is        |
| supplied by oil revenues. The fortunes of Alaska's oil industry, and  |
| therefore many sectors of the economy, are dependent upon world oil   |
| prices. Oil was discovered in Prudhoe Bay, on the arctic coast, in    |
| 1968. Pipeline construction began in 1974 and was completed in 1977.  |
| The [800 mile pipeline]{.underline} is the largest privately financed |
| construction project in history. The pipe is 48 inches in diameter    |
| and oil moves at about 5.5 miles per hour, requiring just under six   |
| days to travel from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. [Tourism is also a major   |
| sector of Alaska's economy]{.underline} attracting over 1.1 million   |
| visitors annually. The tourism industry is Alaska's second largest    |
| primary employer. The rich [fishing waters off Alaska's coast make it |

| only]{.underline} salmon [industry certified]{.underline} as          |
| \"[sustainable]{.underline}\" by the Marine Stewardship Council.      |
| Forests add to Alaska's beauty and provide a renewable economic       |
| resource. With 28 million acres of commercial forest, [Alaska's       |
| timber industry supplies world markets]{.underline} with logs,        |
| lumber, pulp, and other forest products. Much of Southeast Alaska is  |
| part of the Tongass National Forest, a 16.8 million acre rainforest.  |

### Both planks key:

#### Alaska Canada Rail Link is key to building the ICRL -- it's the largest part

[There is no doubt that a Bering Strait project, beginning with
construction of an Alaska Canada rail link]{.underline}, in part, [can
be portrayed as an enhancement of the Arctic policies of the United
States and Canada.]{.underline} Certainly, [there are serious national
security implications to a Bering Strait tunnel for both]{.underline}
the U.S. and Canada. Their Arctic policies are concerned with
sovereignty and security, but also with economic development and
well-being for the regions indigenous inhabitants. [The Arctic
region]{.underline} of North America [and those who live in it stand to
benefit from this project if a partnership is made with them from the
beginning]{.underline}. The environmental, economic and social impact of
these rail and tunnel projects will certainly be studied carefully, and
those who live near this project in Alaska and Canada must not be
sidelined or forgotten. This paper argues that [construction and
completion of an Alaska Canada rail link]{.underline} (ACRL) [will
accomplish the foundational stage for a Bering Strait tunnel so that
momentum would be created for serious consideration of construction of a
Fairbanks to Wales rail link, and ultimately for the building of a
tunnel in cooperation with Russia.]{.underline} Although the 2007 phase
one feasibility study for an ACRL recommended track terminating at ports
in Alaska and western Canada for ocean shipping of goods to Asia, not
continuing a rail link to the Seward Peninsula, [the idea of a Bering
Strait tunnel]{.underline} may seem [more feasible once the largest
segment of required rail infrastructure is built connecting the Lower 48
through Canada to Fairbanks.]{.underline} Unfortunately, in today's
economic climate in western Canada, with the focus on getting Alberta's
crude oil to tidewater, as well as with America's moratorium on offshore
oil exploration, a persuasive business case for an ACRL has yet to be
made. Clearly, [no ACRL can be built unless]{.underline} major [private
funding is secured, as the era of mega projects sponsored by the U.S.
federal government is long gone]{.underline}. We cannot think in terms
of massive public (or public/private) projects such as the Trans
Continental Railroad in the 19^th^ century (which was ultimately
privately funded as all government loans were repaid by the railroads),
the Tennessee Valley Authority of the 1930s (still a federally-owned
corporation), or even Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)
of the 1980s (which neither was that large a project nor did it see much
technological success). [The American government cannot and will not
take upon itself the burden of building a project of the magnitude of a
Bering Strait tunnel.]{.underline}
