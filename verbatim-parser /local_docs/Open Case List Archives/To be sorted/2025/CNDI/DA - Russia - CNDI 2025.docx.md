# RUSSIA DA

## NOTE

The Russia DA can be written in many ways -- this version is fairly
generic and it is tailored to link to big stick military and icebreaker
affs.

But a lot more links can be found and this could be a big generic
argument on the topic, applied to nearly anything.

The general idea is that Russia runs the Arctic now, or at least sees
itself as the hegemon in that region; the plan is seen as a challenge,
and U.S.-Russia tensions are a bad thing to cause.

There is a quick impact between decreasing U.S.-Russia relations and
war, and more nuanced impacts about relations solving impacts which can
help the DA turn or solve the case.

It's super helpful to win timeframe against any aff with a Russia impact
(and there will be many, at camp and beyond) and also to win defense
against the way the aff solves for Russia things, because that is the
offense/narrative that the aff can use to solve or control this DA's
impact.

There are some tensions between certain neg link arguments and impact
arguments, and also tensions between different aff answers maybe even
with the aff, itself -- you must be thoughtful and consistent with which
cards you read and arguments you choose to make or you may create
opportunities for strategic concessions by the other team; beware ;)

Some of the cards are highlighted to help the early debates but many key
cards that will make a huge difference have been left unhighlighted so
you can prepare and learn the material. Get good at the Russia DA. Make
teams pass "the Russia Test" to defeat you.

## "Sphere of influence"

### 1NC Russia DA

#### Uniqueness -- U.S. and Russia have an unspoken agreement to maintain stability in the Arctic to hedge the risks in Ukraine -- the U.S. must continue self-restraint to honor Russia's sphere of influence and keep the peace

Tormod **Heier '25**, Norwegian Defence University College, Norway, "How
the Ukraine War Stopped Arctic Brinkmanship," Arctic Review on Law and
Politics Vol. 16, 2025, pp. 58--80,
https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/6837/11032 \[mto\]

Based on the empirical description, how can the slide from malign to
benign operations be explained? Or more precisely, why have **[U.S. and
Russian forces since 2022 seemingly stopped antagonizing each other
outside the coast of Norway]{.underline}**? Using Schelling's theory of
brinkmanship and Lebow's warning of inadvertent wars, the empirical
expectation suggests that **[[in the post-Ukrainian environment, U.S.
and Russian forces are incentivized to move away from the Arctic brink
of war; restraints on military activities and respect for each other's
sphere of interest is safer]{.underline}]{.mark}** than "manipulating
the risk of war". Analyzing this assumption, two explanations seem
particularly plausible: broader security concerns and strategic
necessity.

On broader security concerns, it can be argued that **[the Arctic
brinkmanship strategy has become too dangerous]{.underline}**. Since the
2022 invasion, hundreds of thousands of troops across the Euro-Atlantic
region have been mobilized and stand on a higher readiness status. U.S.
and Russian nuclear forces have thus increased their patrolling and
attained a key role in strategic deterrence.78 **[As the two nuclear
powers are forced to operate under more unpredictable circumstances, the
current situation seems to be characterized by a shorter strategic
warning time. [A security environment where transparency, trust and
confidence]{.mark} gradually [wither may lead to inadvertent spirals of
escalation and war]{.mark}. As [assertive brinkmanship induces
tensio]{.mark}n, and thus lower prospects for nuclear escalation, the
alternative of regaining control over the situation is probably much
safer for both protagonists]{.underline}**. The alternative, where
crisis unfolds in ways that neither Russian nor U.S. defense officials
can fully control, is simply too risky after Russia's attempt to invade
Ukraine.

The post-Ukrainian restraints thereby signify an important aspect of
Arctic security, namely that U.S. and Russian forces are intimately tied
together by one mutual interest; neither side wants to see the Arctic
become a staging ground for a risky brinkmanship strategy that
subsequently leaves everyone worse off. On the contrary, **[by showing
restraints in the Norwegian and Barents Seas, state leaders in
Washington D.C. and Moscow are allowed to take active steps away from
the brink of war]{.underline}**. A plausible interpretation, therefore,
is that Ukraine is not worth an increased risk for an existential
nuclear war, neither as seen from a U.S. or a Russian perspective. As
wars always unfold in unexpected ways and consequently are hard to
predict, managing the fear of inadvertent escalation is safer than
continuing to "manipulate the risk" in the Arctic.

Hence, as **[[U.S. and Russian forces tacitly agree to maintain a subtle
sense of crisis stability]{.mark} in the Norwegian Sea, [defined as an
absence of mutual provocations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the rivals
nevertheless need to display presence and agility. But contrary to the
malign 2015--2021 period, post-2022 deployments are more tempered.
Cautiously confined to mutually exclusive zones of operations, Russian
NOTAMs are absent in the Norwegian Sea while U.S. maritime task groups
are absent in the Barents Sea. **[[Abstaining from provocative
exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[means that the two
adversaries]{.mark} pursue a stricter rule of engagement. Careful
[not]{.mark} to [invoke an Arctic escalatory "tit-for-tat" logic,
this]{.mark} "gentleman's [agreement" can be interpreted as]{.mark} a
sort of [tacit cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It allows state
leaders and military commanders to buy time in case of unintended
accidents. In the post-Ukrainian environment, technical or human errors
close to Russia's second-strike capabilities on the Kola Peninsula
should be avoided. The operative restraints thereby provide the two
opponents with more room for maneuver. **[If tension inadvertently
spirals out of control, U.S. and Russian defense officials are allowed
to calm down, communicate, and clarify misperceptions or
misunderstandings. [Paradoxically]{.mark}, therefore, [Russia's]{.mark}
full-scale [invasion of Ukraine has contributed to]{.mark} a sense of
[Arctic predictability; a sense of crisis stability where both rivals
are tied to a common interest of war avoidance]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

On strategic necessity, a plausible interpretation may be that both U.S.
and Russian forces suffer from lack of sustainability within their own
force structures. **[Replacing brinkmanship with [self-imposed restraint
may thereby be seen as]{.mark} a [remedial]{.mark} move]{.underline}**.
This is because **[[the alternative]{.mark}, which is a steady but
[growing force concentration of U.S]{.mark}. and Russian
[capabilities]{.mark} in the Arctic, [reduces the freedom of
movement]{.mark} in other theaters]{.underline}**. As great power
rivalry ensues globally, **[[new crises may rapidly arise
elsewhere]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as in Caucasus, in the Middle
East, or in the South China Sea. For Russia in particular, lack of
sustainability is particularly evident. Partly so in the Caucasus, where
the Kremlin declined to reinforce Armenian troops during Azerbaijan's
seizure of Nagorno Karaback in 2023. Partly also in the Middle East, as
Russian forces failed to support the Assad regime during the Syrian
December 2024 collapse. Maintaining a global mindset by avoiding
regional quagmires is a military-strategic prerequisite for U.S. and
Russian flexibility and maneuverability.

For Russia in particular, the Ukraine War has inadvertently developed
into a Donbas nightmare with extreme tolls on manpower, weaponry,
ammunition, and material. Although the majority of the Northern Fleet's
naval and aviation platforms have been spared from the war, key
components needed to underscore the Fleet's operative status have most
likely been ground down. Critical infrastructure, such as Murmansk's
Olenya airfield, has been repeatedly attacked by Ukrainian drones.
Essential combat support functions have thus been thinned out. Examples
are detachments of cohesive ground and air defense capabilities
earmarked for the Northern Fleet's force protection;
Intelligence-Surveillance-Reconnaissance (ISR) assets needed for
theater-wide situational awareness; maintenance and repair assets for
command and control (C2) systems, radars, sensors, weapon storages, and
logistical hubs. These are key functions critical for any agile combat
system, whether they belong to Russian, American or Norwegian forces. If
a crisis inadvertently occurs due to a risky brinkmanship strategy, a
fully operational Northern Fleet may be hard to employ for sustained
combat operations in the Norwegian Sea. This would not only humiliate
the Kremlin, it would also create a new normal where U.S. and other
Western forces more easily contain the Northern Fleet, thus gaining more
control east of the Bear Gap.

Pursuing brinkmanship in the Norwegian Sea thereby seems unrealistic.
Such a maximalist ambition, as seen during the malign period, will most
likely invoke new counter reactions from a numerically and qualitatively
superior NATO. This again will expose Russia to a classical overstretch
problématique: In one theater, an escalatory "tit-for-tat" situation
against a NATO alliance that stands for "half of the World's economic
and military might".79 And in another theater, a protracted ground war
in Europe's second largest state which so far has depleted Russia's
military.80

Strategic necessity may also be a plausible explanation for the United
States. This is because U.S. defense officials are exposed to a
historically unique situation. Never has the United States been
challenged by two nuclear adversaries simultaneously. Contrary to the
Cold War, when the Soviet Union constituted the main nuclear adversary,
today's power balance consists of both Russia and China. In this
multi-polar environment, U.S. forces may more easily be entangled into
multiple crisis management operations leading to the same overstretch
problématique as Russia. But contrary to Russia, U.S. forces may more
easily be tied to a major crisis management operation in Sout-East Asia,
in Europe, and the Middle East, simultaneously. A brinkmanship strategy
aiming to challenge adversaries' red lines is therefore likely to fuse
more tension inside multiple theaters at the same time. This is because
a crossing of Chinese and Russian thresholds may stir unintended
escalations binding U.S. forces to one or more theaters for a prolonged
period. This risk reduces American flexibility. It may even force the
Pentagon to synchronize the planning and employment of conventional and
nuclear forces more extensively.81 **[[Exercising a "tailored presence"
in the Arctic is therefore]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to the 2024
Arctic Strategy, **[[a strategic necessity because U.S. forces also need
to be "balancing]{.mark} against [other global
commitments]{.mark}]{.underline}**".82

Therefore, **[[by]{.underline}]{.mark}** opening for more adversary
crisis communication, and hence **[[imposing operative
restraints]{.mark} on its modus operandi, [the Pentagon may]{.mark} more
easily [gain]{.mark} a [better]{.mark} sense of [escalation management.
This is partly so outside Russia's most important nuclear force in the
Arctic but also in]{.mark} the Straits of [Taiwan and Hormus, or in the
Baltic Sea, Black Sea or Red Sea]{.mark}. More consciousness thereby
allows U.S. nuclear and conventional forces to simultaneously contain or
even deter Russia's Northern Fleet while also addressing an increasingly
assertive Chinese fleet in Southeast Asia. [Avoiding]{.mark} an
[overstretch]{.mark} problématique that otherwise will force the United
States to employ nuclear weapons thereby [incentivizes]{.mark} a modus
operandi that in relative terms favors [restraint]{.mark} before
deterrence]{.underline}**. Military restraints thereby provide U.S.
decision makers with more leeway than coercive maneuvers aiming to
compel Russian or Chinees forces towards the brink of war. Pentagon's
2022 priority on crisis stability, and the subsequent abolishment of the
2018 "operational unpredictable" concept, signify a more cautious
mindset. Military restraints have become a strategic necessity, leaving
the Arctic less exposed to military antagonism and provocations.

4\. Conclusion

This article discussed why U.S. and Russian forces stopped antagonizing
each other on both sides of the Bear Gap. Based on Schelling's
brinkmanship theory, the analysis explored the relationship between
military restraints and war avoidance. Plausible explanations of
"broader security concerns" and "strategic necessity" were discussed.
Which conclusion can be deduced?

The main finding is that brinkmanship ceased because Russia's invasion
in Eastern-Europe made it too dangerous for the two rivals to continue a
"tit-for-tat" logic outside Norway. As Europe's largest war since 1945
unfolded, the United States and Russia could no longer push each other
towards the brink of war. In the post-Ukrainian security environment,
both nuclear powers accept that inadvertent crises must be mitigated.
Fearing the Ukraine war will escalate beyond its borders, both parties
have tempered their Arctic saber rattling. As seen from Moscow and
Washington D.C., an Arctic salami-tactic aiming to install fear,
uncertainty and ultimately coerce the other part to step down in the
Norwegian Sea has become irresponsible. The fact that no provocative
incidents have been reported on either side of the Bear Gap signifies a
tacit cooperation between the two protagonists. U.S. and Russian state
leaders stick to a "gentleman's agreement". This is not out of sympathy
for each other but out of fear, anxiety and a mutual respect for each
other's destructive power.

**[Paradoxically]{.underline}**, therefore, **[Russia's failed attempt
to rapidly seize [Ukraine has led to]{.mark} more [Arctic
predictability]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Russia's failure to win
decisively]{.underline}**]{.mark} in Eastern Europe has, in relative
terms, led to more crisis stability outside Norway. The General Staff's
military blunder and failed coup d'état in Kyiv **[[has become a
regional tranquilizer]{.mark} in one of the most sensitive operational
areas on Earth]{.underline}**. The finding coincides with conclusions
drawn by Kristian Åtland et al., claiming

\[...\] the dominant pattern of Russia's sea and air exercises on NATO's
northern flank has changed significantly in the time that has passed
since February 2022. Particularly noteworthy is the shift in location
\[...\] from the Norwegian Sea to the Barents Sea.83

Non-Western **[experts tend to assess Washington's]{.underline}** new
military **[strategy in the Arctic]{.underline}** **[more
negatively]{.underline}**. **[In particular]{.underline}**, Chinese
military experts, assessing the US strategy, note **[its confrontational
nature]{.underline}**, which is determined not by the regional agenda,
but by the general **[[deterioration of relations between Russia and the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They believe that China's military
capabilities and ambitions in the Arctic are clearly exaggerated and
have an ideological (anti-Chinese) character. They point out that China
has come first in threat assessments that are based on unsubstantiated
attribution of aggressive intentions to it, which speaks in favor of the
deterioration of US-Chinese relations both in the Arctic and in other
regions 36. In their opinion, **[the US strategy [will contribute
to]{.mark} the further [escalation of military threats and]{.mark} the
[arms race]{.mark} in the Far North]{.underline}**. They believe that
the restoration of coordination mechanisms and military
confidence-building measures in the Arctic may take a long time.
Non-Arctic observer states in the Arctic Council can make a certain
contribution to normalization by participating in consultations and
creating new mechanisms for regional coordination. China's interest in
military cooperation with Russia in the Arctic can be explained by its
intention to prevent Russia from becoming excessively weakened under
increasing pressure from the US/NATO and to preserve the Northern Sea
Route as an alternative route to Europe, given the instability in the
Persian Gulf and Suez Canal \[12, Petrovskiy V.E.\]. **[The
[Russia]{.mark}n expert community [notes]{.mark} that the [new
US]{.mark} military strategy in the Far North fits into [plans to
ensure]{.mark} a permanent [presence in the Arctic in economic,
political and military dimensions]{.mark}, as well as to gain dominant
positions in the region]{.underline}** 37. This document shows that the
US is going to take full advantage of Finland and Sweden joining NATO
and the prospect of freeing the Arctic seas from ice by 2030. At the
same time, according to a number of Russian analysts, firstly, the text
of the strategy prioritizes stability over increasing strategic
competition in the region. Secondly, [**[the US is not yet ready
for]{.mark}** a military confrontation in the Arctic,]{.underline} if
only because it does not possess a "**[[full-fledged]{.mark} grouping of
[forces and]{.mark} means to conduct [large-scale
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}**". [Thus, **[Russia has a pause of
several years from direct military pressure]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which does not cancel other, non-military means of deterrence from the
West. In addition, the **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** intends to actively
attract investment from allies to create a common military
**[[infrastructure]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}** 38. It can be
assumed that the US Department of Defense will adopt an additional
document, more clearly disclosing the concept and action plan within the
framework of the strategy. This is indirectly confirmed by the "National
Intelligence Estimate", published by the National Intelligence Council,
to which experts from the US Congressional Research Service refer: as a
result of global warming, competition for Arctic resources **[[will
increase]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which will lead to an **[aggravation
of relations]{.mark} between Arctic and non-Arctic states**, an increase
in military activity in the region by non Arctic states]{.underline} to
protect their investments, new transport routes and to gain strategic
advantages over competitors. According to the National Intelligence
Council, an open military conflict is possible in the Arctic in the
future. It could either involve Russia and unnamed non-Arctic states if
they persistently show military activity in the straits of the Northern
Sea Route, which Russia considers to be internal waters (obviously, we
are talking about US allies). Or it will be a conflict between China and
the Arctic states in the event of its economic consolidation in the
Arctic 39. Conclusion [The **[new US]{.mark}** military strategy in the
Arctic considers the **[policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the Russian
Federation and China as a destabilizing factor in the region and
[**[leave]{.mark}s [no space for cooperation]{.mark}** with
them]{.underline}, **[[which may lead to an escalation of
tensions]{.mark} in the region in the medium term.]{.underline}** The US
has gained a significant geopolitical advantage due to its guaranteed
military presence in Finland and Sweden. At the same time, the strategy
does not contain a clear statement of the threats that come from the
Russian Federation and China. The plans for a very specific build-up of
infrastructure and the US/NATO military presence in the Arctic are a
response to imaginary threats that could only hypothetically arise from
the Russian Federation and China. Apparently, there is still no
consensus within the US Department of Defense and the expert and
analytical community on **[[the content of]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}
military [policy in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This [is
largely due to]{.mark} the [reluctance to get involved]{.mark} in a
military escalation with Russia and the understanding that the US has
insufficient resources for a more offensive policy in the
Arctic.]{.underline}**

Russian-American relations are nearing Cold War lows, and Russia's
decision to withdraw from the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty last
month could send the world back to an era of duck and cover. [**[The
perennial question of Russian-American relations is how to coexist
despite]{.mark}** differing geopolitical ambitions---all under **[the
threat of nuclear annihilation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Rapprochement (a
re-establishment of cordial or harmonious relations) between the U.S.
and Moscow has happened before and will need to happen again. American
policymakers should begin to envision under what circumstances
rapprochement can occur, what it will look like, and how rapprochement
can further both countries' interests. Since 1945, there have been two
significant rapprochements with Moscow---with varying degrees of
success. The first rapprochement, called détente, lasted from the Cuban
Missile Crisis until the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. During this
period, the Soviet Union and the U.S. signed treaties such as the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(SALT), and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. They also signed the
Helsinki Final Act, which some scholars argue helped lead to the end of
authoritarian communist regimes in Eastern Europe. The second period of
rapprochement was from the mid-1980s until the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991. A personal relationship between U.S. President Ronald
Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev highlighted this
period. New bilateral treaties were signed such as the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and SALT II. While there were
still tensions during both periods---both countries fought proxy wars
against each other--- there was finally movement away from the threat of
annihilation. But **[the clouds of [malaise and brinksmanship have
reappeared]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Russia blames the U.S. for beginning
this downward style through NATO's expansion into Eastern Europe,
America's pull out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2001, and its
invasion of Iraq in 2003. The U.S. would counter, arguing that Russia's
invasions of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in 2014, and again Ukraine in 2022
have caused significantly more damage to the U.S.-Russia relationship.
Regardless, **[both countries need to find a way to live with the
other]{.underline}**. The U.S. needs to consider under what conditions
rapprochement with Russia would be appropriate. If Russia's invasion of
Ukraine continues in its current form, rapprochement will be politically
infeasible. But the path the conflict will take is uncertain.
Rapprochement will, in many ways, depend on how the conflict concludes.
An outright Ukrainian or Russian victory, frozen conflict, or settlement
will lead to different outcomes. Who leads Russia will matter too. Could
American leaders ever cooperate with Russia if Vladimir Putin is in
power? If Putin is not in power, is it someone more reactionary or more
moderate? These questions will matter if Russian and American leaders
wish to form a rapport like Reagan and Gorbachev, or Clinton and
Yeltsin. There are areas where cooperation is necessary. The most
obvious is the revival and strengthening of nuclear missile treaties.
**[The U.S. and Russia still hold the most nuclear weapons in the
world]{.underline}**, and working to reduce the amount and ways they are
deployed would help temper fears of mutually assured destruction and set
a positive precedent for other agreements with nuclear-armed countries
such as China. **[Other [issues, such as the Arctic]{.mark} and cyber
security, [in which both]{.mark} the U.S. and Russia [are]{.mark}
decisive [players, could]{.mark} be future issues both countries
[bilaterally resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Rapprochement is in the
long-term interests of both countries. For Russia, its demographic
crisis will be exacerbated by the war as more of its young men come home
in coffins. With fewer young men comes fewer workers, leading to
economic stagnation and recession, worsened by global sanctions.
Rapprochement could mean the difference between further stagnation and
sustainable demographic and economic growth. For the U.S., rapprochement
with Russia can help ease demand on a country with limited military and
diplomatic resources. It can allow the U.S. to finally accomplish its
pivot towards Asia, a wishful goal since the early 2010s. And
rapprochement may prevent a formal Sino-Russian alliance, which would
both be a geopolitical disaster for the U.S. and push the world towards
a third global catastrophe. **[[If U.S.-Russian relations]{.mark}
continue to [deteriorate, the risk of nuclear war will
increase]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While rapprochement will not happen
until the war in Ukraine concludes, it is both countries' moral duty to
get there eventually. Both sides can choose not to be enemies. They can
cooperate when their interests are aligned and effectively communicate
when opposed.

### Uniqueness -- SOI

#### Russia controls the Arctic now and U.S. encroachment is slow

Medha **Bhardwaj '25**, May 11, "The Arctic Imperative: Russian National
Identity, Resource Politics, and Geostrategic Power," MODERN DIPLOMACY,
https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/05/11/the-arctic-imperative-russian-national-identity-resource-politics-and-geostrategic-power/
\[mto\]

Among the Arctic states, five---Russia, Canada, the US, Denmark, and
Norway---have been particularly proactive in asserting their claims and
advancing their strategic interests in the region. Geographically
speaking, **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** stands out in this as it
**[[possesses approximately 40% of]{.mark} the total [land]{.mark} area
[beyond the Arctic coastline and is home to nearly three-quarters of the
Arctic population, thereby reinforcing its dominant position]{.mark} in
the region]{.underline}**.

The acceleration in the melting of glaciers due to climate change has
rendered Arctic waters increasingly navigable and has facilitated access
to the vast, previously untapped natural resources beneath the Arctic
seabed. In response, **[the [Russia]{.mark}n Federation [has made
substantial investments in both infrastructure and military capabilities
as part of its broader strategy]{.mark} to assert dominance [in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the wake of counterbalancing Russian
influence, the US also enhanced its military posture by expanding its
Arctic presence, e.g.,. **[The US Navy held its largest Arctic drill in
decades in 2016]{.underline}**, involving over 5,000 soldiers and a
variety of military assets. Before that, **[[the U.S]{.mark}. response
[had always been slow in articulating a comprehensive Arctic
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Russia controls the Arctic now

Sydney **Murkins '24**, December 3, "The Future Battlefield is Melting:
An Argument for Why the U.S. Must Adopt a More Proactive Arctic
Strategy," THE ARCTIC INSTITUTE,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/future-battlefield-melting-argument-us-must-adopt-more-proactive-arctic-strategy/
\[mto\]

Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic, **[Russia controls
over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline, making it a decisive player in
the future of the region]{.underline}**.11) Yet, **[Russia's Arctic
ambitions are not new. Russia's connection with the Arctic can be traced
back to the sixteenth century, beginning with its conquest of
Siberia]{.underline}**, which was part of a larger initiative to search
for resources and trade routes.12) As the nation matured, its Arctic
ambitions did as well. **[During the Cold War, the Soviets established
both a nuclear and naval presence]{.underline}** on the Kola Peninsula
to project power against the U.S. **[With the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Russia]{.underline}**, as the de jure inheritor of the Soviet
nuclear arsenal, **[did not abandon its desire to be an Arctic
power]{.underline}**.

As the Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s under Vladimir
**[Putin]{.underline}**, Russia **[began posturing for Arctic supremacy,
reopening multiple Soviet-era military bases, modernizing its navy, and
developing new hypersonic missiles designed to evade U.S. sensors and
defenses]{.underline}**.13) Moreover, **[in August 2022, Moscow
announced that it would refocus its military power on the
Arctic]{.underline}** and Nordic region.14) According to Colin Wall, a
research associate at Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, "**[The military balance in the Arctic is heavily weighted
towards Russia]{.underline}**." Furthermore, the International Institute
for Strategic Studies and Reuters cite that Russia's bases inside the
Arctic Circle outnumber NATO's by roughly a third.15) Russia's
remilitarization of the Arctic and its revitalized strategic partnership
with China, provides both countries with the means to challenge the
current Western rules-based international order.

#### Russia sees the Arctic as a core component of its sphere of influence

Farrell **Gregory '25**, April 23, "The Sino-Russian Alignment Stops at
Arctic Trade," THE DIPLOMAT,
https://thediplomat.com/2025/04/the-sino-russian-alignment-stops-at-arctic-trade/
\[mto\]

That's a problem **[for Russia. The Arctic is seen as a vital part of
its sphere of influence. The region is the source of 80 percent of
Russia's gas and 30 percent of its GDP. Nearly the entirety of the NSR
falls inside Russia's Exclusive Economic Zone. This allows Russia to
regulate transit, require shipments to be accompanied by Russian
icebreakers, and charge usage fees]{.underline}**. It's unlikely that
China, as it securitizes and diversifies its trade routes, would abide
such tight Russian control. Furthermore, Russia has become increasingly
reliant on the PRC for investment, oil purchases, and advanced
technology. China wields a number of potential levers that it could use
to coerce more accommodating practice. If Russia allows an increased
Chinese presence in the Arctic, cracking that door open could just be a
prelude towards opening it all the way.

#### Russia is trying to reassert itself as a great power by protecting spheres of influence

Abram **Shulsky '25**, April 7, "Into the Multi(polar)verse,"
PERSUASION, https://www.persuasion.community/p/into-the-multipolarverse
\[mto\]

**[While being mindful of the interests of the other great powers, each
has a "sphere of influence," informally recognized by the others, in
which it can act at will. In ordinary circumstances, a great power will
be hesitant to become too active in another's sphere of
influence]{.underline}**. Small powers that have the bad luck to fall
within a great power's sphere of influence have to grin and bear it;
their ability to maneuver internationally is strictly constrained. Small
powers not falling into a sphere of influence are somewhat luckier, but
they have to be concerned when the great powers meet: since they are not
at the table, they, potentially at least, are on the menu.

This simple, even simplistic, explanation raises at least two questions:
first, who determines who is a great power? And second, who determines
the boundaries of their respective spheres of influence?

On the first question: the definitive, but unsatisfying, answer is that
a great power is a country that the other great powers recognize as
such. In general, this means that a great power is one that can act
independently on the world stage and whose power is such that it is
prudent for other great powers to take its interests into account when
they act.

What would this mean in practice for an emerging multipolar system?

No doubt the United States and China are great powers.
**[Russia]{.underline}** is not in the same league as these countries in
demographic or economic terms, but it **[is a major nuclear power with
strengths in conventional and "hybrid" warfare. Putin clearly means to
re-establish Russia as a great power and has done so through his
willingness to pursue the Ukraine War despite its high cost in blood and
treasure]{.underline}**.

### Uniqueness -- Russian Arctic heg peaceful

#### Russia has militarized the Arctic as part of its sphere of influence -- re-normalization of relations will keep the peace

Abby **Bell '24**, May 21, CSPS Fellow, "Cold Realities: Russia's Arctic
Security Actions and Implications," CENTER FOR SECURITY POLICY STUDIES,

\[mto\]

**[[The Arctic plays a significant role in Russia's self-identity as a
great power because Russia has historically perceived the Arctic
to]{.mark} largely [belong in its sphere of influence]{.mark} and
because Russia boasts regional hegemony in the area. Russia's security
posture aims to maintain Russia's sphere of influence to safeguard it
against external threats, particularly in areas of strategic importance
such as the Arctic. [While the U.S. is]{.mark} by far the most
[powerful]{.mark} Arctic state, [its limited presence in the Arctic has
granted Russia de-facto hegemony in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
In terms of the greatest capabilities deployed in the region and the
fact that Russia has the largest Arctic fleet capable of year-round
power projection, **[[Russia is the commanding military
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, Russia has increasingly perceived
the U.S. and NATO as trying to reduce and replace its influence in its
historic sphere of influence.

**[Over the last few decades, [Russia has sought to increase its
military presence and capabilities in the Arctic to demonstrate and
maintain Russia's power]{.mark} in the region [as well as convey it to
the U.S]{.mark}. and NATO]{.underline}**. Russia has both re-opened
former Soviet military and radar bases on and around its northern
coastline and has built new ones to boast a total of twenty-seven bases
above the Arctic Circle. Additionally, Russia intends to add an
additional twenty-two icebreakers to its existing fleet of fifty-five
which will significantly increase its already strong year-round power
projection capabilities in the Arctic. Meanwhile, the U.S. and NATO have
responded to Russia's "aggressive" behavior in the Arctic by building up
their own military presences and military capabilities in the region.
The U.S intends to build six new icebreakers for the Coast Guard to
replace the two in its fleet to better maintain a persistent presence in
the region year-round and has reopened the Keflavik Naval Air Station in
Iceland where it now stations a bomber task force mission for "strategic
deterrence." NATO has taken similar actions in response to Russia's
expanding military presence by taking steps such as increasing its
exercise and training tempo in the region to "show the world that NATO
is relevant, united, and ready to defend itself".

One implication of Russia's actions in the Arctic involves the
continuation of suspicion and mistrust between Russia and the U.S./NATO
in the future, especially considering Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
The **[U.S.]{.underline}** and NATO may reasonably continue to view
Russia's actions in the Arctic with heightened suspicion and increase
their own respective **[military presences and capabilities in the
Arctic]{.underline}** to **[bolster]{.underline}** their own
self-defense capacities. The current perspectives of each side viewing
the other as presenting a potential security threat leads to continuing
**[cycles of mutual distrust and uncertainty]{.underline}** between
Russia and the U.S./NATO in the Arctic. Geopolitical tensions and
suspicions will continue to increase as **[this cycle]{.underline}**
continues, which **[may result in a destabilizing and increasingly
offensive posture in the region]{.underline}**. U.S. Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin has cited "the importance of maintaining lines of
communication \[with Russia\] amid the ongoing war" in Ukraine.
Maintaining open diplomatic and military lines of communication between
the U.S. and Moscow on Arctic matters may be one way to help minimize
misperceptions by either country in the Arctic to help reduce tensions
or avoid **[misperceptions]{.underline}** that **[could lead to
accidental escalation]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, the outcome of Russia's war in Ukraine bears the potential
to influence future security and stability in the Arctic regarding
Russia's future on the Arctic Council. Composed of the eight Arctic
states (the U.S., Canada, Denmark, Norway, and Russia, Finland, Iceland,
and Sweden), the Council is a consensus-based intergovernmental forum
designed to facilitate cooperation and collaboration on Arctic concerns
and which thereby contributes to stability in the region. As a response
to the onset of Russia's invasion to Ukraine, the seven other members of
the Council (the "Arctic 7") suspended political activities and
high-level meetings. While projects that did not involve Russia resumed
as early as the summer of 2022, this decision has pushed back the
progress of inter-Arctic dialogue and cooperation. **[[Regardless
of]{.mark} whether Russia should win or lose the war in [Ukraine, the
Arctic 7 may seek]{.mark} the eventual [re-normalization of Russia into
Council activities to resume full-scale Arctic coordination and
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The Arctic 7 may reluctantly
prefer this option over the continued isolation of the largest Arctic
state]{.mark}, which would undermine the fundamental vision of
circumpolar cooperation that prompted the Council's creation in the
first place]{.underline}**.

**[The Arctic remains an evolving arena for geopolitical competition
between Russia and the U.S]{.underline}**. and its Arctic NATO allies,
particularly as tensions have increased following Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. To help mitigate risks and preserve stability in the Arctic,
Russia and the U.S., along with the rest of the Arctic 7 countries, must
take care to ensure that **[increased human activity and military
capabilities in the region]{.underline}** do not **[lead to accidental
or inadvertent escalation caused by miscommunication or
misinterpretation of each other's actions]{.underline}**. Despite the
ongoing war in Ukraine, maintaining lines of diplomatic and military
communication with Russia on Arctic matters and re-normalizing Russia's
participation on the Arctic Council to help bolster Arctic cooperation
and stability may be effective methods to help do so.

#### Russia is consolidating control over Arctic territory to maximize economic incentives

National Security Strategy: Analysing Current Trajectory and

**[The Arctic has emerged as a focal point for Russia's long-term
economic and strategic ambitions. Russia's Arctic territory, spanning
over a quarter of its total land area and hosting extensive natural
resources, includes 20,000 kilometres of coastline, many mineral
deposits, and a substantial portion of global energy
reserves]{.underline}**.

In 2020, President Vladimir Putin introduced the "Arctic 2035" strategy
to ensure economic growth and safeguard national security in this
region. Recent legislative changes and funding allocations have
transformed the Arctic into a strategic region for Russia, particularly
as it seeks to expand its sphere of influence in the High North.

The government's strategy includes several core initiatives: economic
support through extensive infrastructure projects, tax incentives,
affordable housing schemes, and development of the NSR. A critical
element of this strategy is establishing reliable transport
infrastructure, enabling year-round logistical support, and securing key
maritime routes. Recent directives underscore a need to revise Arctic
plans by mid-2025, considering updated risk assessments and security
requirements.

Russia's Arctic: Current Situation and Analysis

On October 22nd, 2024, during a meeting on the Arctic, Prime Minister
Mishustin highlighted the region's growing significance to Russia's
security and economic plans. The Russian Prime Minister stressed the
ongoing establishment of a robust infrastructure network in the Arctic,
including the world's largest free economic zone and three advanced
development territories, which collectively host nearly 1,000 active
projects, totalling private investments of approximately 2 trillion
roubles. These initiatives support tens of thousands of new jobs and
provide a foundational platform for expanded energy and mineral
extraction activities.

The NSR remains pivotal within this strategy, envisaged as a globally
competitive shipping route that connects Asian and European markets
through Russia's Arctic coastline. Recent governmental allocations,
including 300 million roubles designated for supporting regular
shipments via the NSR, demonstrate Moscow's commitment to the route's
development. This project not only serves as a transport artery for
Russian territories but also aims to attract international maritime
interest, particularly from Chinese stakeholders aligned with Beijing's
polar Silk Road initiative.

Beyond transport, socio-economic projects are targeting improvements in
public services and housing for Arctic residents. According to
Mishustin, recent programs focus on improving living standards by
offering affordable housing loans with a 2% interest rate, extensive
public transport upgrades, and a subsidy-funded infrastructure
enhancement initiative. The Kremlin's additionally allocated resources
to establish 16 key Arctic settlements as growth hubs, where investment
in housing, healthcare, education, and engineering systems will receive
concentrated support. These hubs, strategically positioned, could
facilitate sustainable economic zones that attract skilled labour and
support long-term regional stabilisation.

The Russian Ministry of the Far East and Arctic Development
(Minvostokrazvitiya) will oversee the revision of the Arctic strategy by
mid-2025. The Ministry will revise the Arctic strategy to address the
heightened geopolitical tensions and operational difficulties that
Russia now faces, reviewing goals, challenges, and benchmarks
established in 2020. Additional the Ministry of Construction (Minstroi)
will focus on building critical emergency response infrastructure,
especially in remote areas like Khatanga, and creating a consolidated
approach to address the specific needs of Arctic urbanisation, including
a mandate to assess and potentially close uninhabited multi-family
buildings.

Extending planning to 2050, the new mineral resource strategy
prioritises extensive exploration of the Arctic's vast untapped
reserves. Governmental directives to expand dockyard capacity for Arctic
fleet repairs underscore Russia's anticipation of increased Arctic
maritime activity.

Implications and Forecast

Near-Term (2024-2025). **[By pushing Arctic development, Moscow aims to
assert its control over important resources in the region and stay ahead
in shipping and resource extraction. With over 2 trillion roubles
already allocated for private investments and additional public funds
directed at infrastructure, Russia aims to consolidate its Arctic
dominance despite economic constraints from international sanctions and
logistical challenges. Key near-term indicators include the potential
for increased military infrastructure to secure Arctic borders, given
Russia's prioritisation of the region for national
security]{.underline}**. Concurrently, **[developments]{.underline}** in
the NSR **[could position Russia as a central player in future polar
trade]{.underline}**, though the sustainability of foreign partnerships,
particularly with Chinese stakeholders, warrants scrutiny.

#### Russia has huge economic incentives to maintain control of the Arctic -- they are sensitive to intrusion or encirclement

new cold war," GEOPOLITICAL ECONOMY,
https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2023/02/28/arctic-new-cold-war-us-russia-china/
\[mto\]

In addition to its geostrategic location, **[the Arctic is crucial for
its natural resources]{.underline}**.

**[90 percent of Russia's current gas production and 60 percent of its
oil production take place in the Arctic. The region has a staggering 60
percent of Russia's gas and oil reserves]{.underline}**.

**[The Russian Arctic also has large deposits of coal, petroleum, and
natural gas, as well as diamonds, gold, nickel, cobalt, copper,
palladium, platinum, zinc, and rare earth metals]{.underline}**.

In addition, Russia aspires to make the region more hospitable, even
tourist friendly. It plans to build new cities, as well as harbors,
airports, and IT equipment.

These plans include ways of preventing the negative impacts of this
development on climate change, to which the Arctic is highly vulnerable.

Finally, the Northern Sea Route, made passable by the Russian fleet of
40 icebreakers, including four nuclear-powered ones and a new series
planned, is a bone of contention in maritime law.

Russia considers this a national waterway. But **[if foreign ships are
to pass through]{.underline}** for trade, **[it would]{.underline}**
have to **[become]{.underline}** an international route, possibly open
to **[hostile]{.underline}** warships as well.

The **[conflict in Eastern Europe, on Russia's western border, has
increased Moscow's fear of encirclement, including in its
north]{.underline}**.

### Uniqueness -- Relations

#### Trump and Putin are working to better relations between the countries

**Watson '25,** 3/18 Kathryn. "Trump and Putin stress improving
U.S.-Russia relations in phone call, White House says," CBS, Kathryn
Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington,
D.C.,
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-putin-speak-phone-call-ukraine-war/

Washington --- President Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir
Putin agreed to an \"immediate ceasefire on all energy and
infrastructure\" in Ukraine when the two spoke Tuesday in a lengthy
phone call, but Russia has not agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire like
Ukraine has. Hours after the call, air raid sirens sounded and
explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. The White House
and the Kremlin both said they agreed to begin negotiations
\"immediately\" to achieve a fuller ceasefire. A Russian readout of the
call from the Kremlin said a key condition for working toward a
resolution to the conflict \"should be the complete cessation of foreign
military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.\"
The White House readout did not contain that information, or Mr.
Trump\'s response. \"My phone conversation today with President Putin of
Russia was a very good and productive one,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth
Social. \"We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and
infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to
have a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible
war between Russia and Ukraine. \... Many elements of a contract for
peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are
being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would
like to see it end.\" The call lasted at least 90 minutes, as indicated
by the timing of White House updates, but the exact duration hasn\'t
been disclosed yet. \"Today, [President Trump and President
Putin]{.underline} spoke about the need for peace and a ceasefire in the
Ukraine war,\" a White House readout of the call said. \"Both leaders
agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace. They also
[stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United
States and Russia]{.underline}. The blood and treasure that both Ukraine
and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the
needs of their people. \... The leaders agreed that the movement to
peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as
technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the
Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will
begin immediately in the Middle East.\"

#### New Trump policies prove\-\--US is creating a closer relationship with Russia

**Arkin '25**, March 3, Daniel. "Trump turns toward Russia, breaking
with decades of U.S. policy," NBC,
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-turns-russia-breaking-decades-us-policy-rcna194518

President Donald Trump has said Ukraine --- not Russia --- started the
war. He's called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy --- not
Vladimir Putin --- a dictator. Meanwhile, Trump's administration is
standing down on a suite of tough anti-Kremlin policies. In just over a
month, [Trump has executed a startling realignment of American foreign
policy, effectively throwing U.S. support behind Moscow and rejecting
the tight alliance with Kyiv cultivated by former President Joe
Biden.]{.underline} [The extraordinary pivot has upended decades of
hawkish foreign policy toward Russia]{.underline} that provided a rare
area of bipartisan consensus in an increasingly divided nation. Trump's
recent moves have drawn international attention, unsettling U.S. allies
in Europe and thrilling conservative populists who favor a turn away
from Zelenskyy. The new posture was put in stark relief on Friday during
a tense Oval Office meeting between [Trump and Zelenskyy]{.underline}.
The leaders [clashed in front of the press]{.underline}, raising
questions about the future of American support for Kyiv, more than three
years after Russia opened the largest conflict in Europe since World War
II. [U.S. officials have made a series of policy changes in recent weeks
that seem to herald a more cooperative stance with Russia: The White
House ordered a pause on military aid to Ukraine as the administration
carries out a review]{.underline}, a White House official and a U.S.
official told NBC News on Monday. Late last week, Defense Secretary Pete
Hegseth ordered the [U.S. Cyber Command to cease offensive cyber
operations and information operations against Russia]{.underline}, a
U.S. official familiar with the matter told NBC News. It's unclear how
long the order will last. [Attorney General]{.underline} Pam Bondi, on
her first day in office, [disbanded efforts to seize the assets of
Russian oligarchs]{.underline}, breaking up Biden-era programs known as
Task Force Klepto Capture and the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.

attempt to sow division in U.S. politics. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
and other top Trump administration officials traveled to Saudi Arabia
last month to start peace negotiations with Russia --- but Zelenskyy
said Ukrainian officials hadn't been invited. [Trump has long professed
a desire to reset and improve relations with Russia]{.underline}. [He
has repeatedly said he believes it is in the national interest to "get
along" with Moscow]{.underline} and cast doubt on the value of core
parts of the post-World War II global security architecture, including
NATO and the European Union. Trump's first term was shadowed by former
special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation --- a probe that
Trump has repeatedly dismissed as the "Russia hoax." [Trump's approach
is a dramatic departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward
Russia]{.underline}, a period spanning the Cold War with the former
Soviet Union as well as the rise of Putin. American presidents,
Republicans and Democrats alike, typically struck a more bellicose tone
on the threat posed by an emboldened Russia. [Putin's regime has
welcomed the overtures]{.underline} from Trump. In statements reported
by Russian state media agency TASS, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
praised Trump as a pragmatist who operates with "common sense." "We see
that the collective West has begun to partially lose its unity," Kremlin
spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday. Democrats
and [anti-Trump]{.underline} Republican [commentators]{.underline} have
sharply criticized the administration since the Oval Office meeting,
[accusing Trump of effectively selling out Ukraine]{.underline}. In a
post on his Truth Social platform early Monday, Trump defended himself
and insisted he had helped keep much of Ukraine intact. "The only
President who gave none of Ukraine's land to Putin's Russia is President
Donald J. Trump," he wrote in the post. "Remember that when the weak and
ineffective Democrat's criticize, and the Fake News gladly puts out
anything they say!" But there is a partisan divide on Ukraine; Gallup
recently found that 84% of Democrats have a favorable view of Ukraine,
whereas only 54% of Republican poll respondents said the same. In the
wake of the Trump-Zelenskyy spat, a handful of Republican lawmakers
defended Ukraine, while most --- including House Speaker Mike Johnson,
R-La., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. --- said Zelenskyy may have to
resign. The feud between continued Monday, with Trump disparaging his
Ukrainian counterpart in a post on social media.

In recent days, [President Trump and his administration have released a
radical new geopolitical strategy, one in which the White House seems to
be turning against traditional European allies and building closer ties
to Vladimir Putin's Russia]{.underline}. It appears that part of this
interest in [building closer links to Russia]{.underline}, including by
disdaining Ukraine, blaming the war on Ukraine (Russia invaded Ukraine),
and [Trump himself lavishly praising Putin]{.underline}, is the idea
that the United States can use Russia alongside Washington as a tool
together against China. In some ways, this would vaguely resemble a
reverse Kissinger---Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon had courted China,
which was already splitting with the Soviet Union, to build a U.S.-China
front against Moscow. Here, the White House and its China super hawks
seem to believe that they can work with Russia to isolate China from the
world and damage its increasing global presence. More From Our Experts

China and Russia already have been building very close strategic and

of the dollar as a reserve currency and prime currency of trade, promote
alternative institutions to the post-WWII order, and back up a growing
network of linked authoritarian states around the world, from Venezuela
to Vietnam.

#### US has completely reset relations

**Mills '25,** March 20
"https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-10218/CBP-10218.pdf

During a telephone conversation on 12 February 2025, President
[Trump]{.underline} and President Putin [agreed to reset US-Russian
relations and re-establish dialogue on "topics of mutual
interest]{.underline}", including the possible settlement of the Ukraine
conflict. The first round of bilateral talks took place in Saudi Arabia
on 18 February 2025 and was the first meeting between US and Russian
officials in over three years. [Both sides agreed to take steps to
normalise diplomatic relations]{.underline} and to appoint high-level
teams to begin working on a Ukraine peace agreement. The US had faced
criticism prior to the meeting for the absence of Ukrainian or European
representation at the talks. President Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would
not accept any agreements made without the country's involvement and
warned against trusting "Putin's claims of readiness to end the war". EU
High Representative Kaja Kallas, accused President Trump of appeasing
Russia. The [Trump]{.underline} administration has also appeared to
[soften its approach to Russia in other areas, moving to disband various
taskforces combating Russian disinformation, preventing sanctions
evasion by Russian oligarchs and investigating war crimes in relation to
the Ukraine conflict. The US Department of Defense has also suspended
offensive cyber operations against Russia.]{.underline} A summit meeting
between President Trump and President Putin is expected to happen as a
direct result of this reset in relations, although a timeframe is not
yet clear.

### Link -- generic 'presence'

#### U.S. presence in the Arctic is low now -- increased activity risks miscalc with Russia and global instability

Mathieu **Boulègue et al. '24**, December 5, with Minna Ålander,
Charlotta Collén, Edward Lucas, Catherine Sendak, and Krista Viksnins,
"Up North: Confronting Arctic Insecurity Implications for the United
States and NATO," CENTER FOR EUROPEAN POLICY ANALYSIS,

\[mto\]

**[[The Arctic has reemerged as a critical region for global security
and stability. For years, the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
and its partners and allies have [sought a "low-tension" environment.
However, geopolitics]{.mark} and strategic competition mean the
circumpolar security landscape [is changing fast]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Arctic governance is suffering. The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
2022 prompted a limitation of activities involving the Russian
Federation in the Arctic Council1 and other circumpolar cooperative
frameworks. This institutional limbo2 will likely persist. Fragmented
cooperation marks a long step back from the spirit of the 2008 Ilulissat
Declaration.3

The "High North, low tension" and "exceptional Arctic" mantras are
increasingly outdated. Since the 1987 Murmansk Initiative,4 the logic of
"Arctic exceptionalism" relied on stakeholders focusing on cooperative
governance. Underlying drivers of insecurity, including adversarial and
competitive geopolitical dynamics, were always present, if hidden.

Climate change adds complexity.5 On top of diminished ice coverage,
submarine operations --- from torpedo launches to hydro-acoustics ---
are challenged by changes in seawater quality and salinity.6 Boreal
wildfires also require military assistance to aid overrun civilian
responses. Most importantly, climate change means more physical access
to the Arctic across all domains. As the civilian (e.g., commercial
shipping, resource extraction, fishing, tourism) and military (e.g.,
standing forces and constabulary operations) presence increases in
Arctic waters and skies, more incidents and accidents will undeniably
happen --- especially risks linked to environmental degradation due to
environmental catastrophes and human-made disasters (especially
radioactive waste management in Russia).7 Unfortunately, the most
affected are likely to be local and Indigenous communities.8

Russia began reinvesting in Arctic affairs in the mid-2000s.9 The
Kremlin remains adamant in asserting complete control over the Arctic
Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF), extending defense in depth
through interdiction capabilities away from the Russian Arctic, and
protecting perceived vital interests along the Northern Sea Route (NSR).
**[[Russia has been rapidly militarizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** NSR
approaches, especially across **[critical choke points]{.underline}**,10
**[[and modernizing]{.mark} local infrastructure]{.underline}**.11

Under the impact of climate change, more waters and coastlines in and
close to the AZRF and the NSR are becoming accessible. In Moscow's
calculations, receding sea ice coverage means that the once "natural"
border no longer offers sufficient protection. **[[The
Kremlin]{.underline}]{.mark}** consequently
**[[fears]{.underline}]{.mark}** that the **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and NATO will soon increase surface, subsurface, and air
**[[deployments]{.mark} closer to the AZRF. [This situation is fraught
with miscalculation and tactical errors]{.mark} that [could lead to
dangerous escalation with global consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

This fear has been amplified by Sweden's and Finland's NATO accession,
fueling a sense of encirclement12 and vulnerability.13 Ukrainian drone
strikes on the Olenya air base,14 home to strategic aviation assets, in
July 2024, raises the question of how potent Russia's multilayered
defense capabilities truly are.

China's approach to Arctic security is very different. The
self-aggrandizing "near-Arctic" state proclamation in 201815 prompted a
diplomatic backlash and forced China into "tactical retreat."16
Beijing's approach to the Arctic is linked to resource access
diversification as part of the Belt and Road Initiative for fossil
energy, rare earths, and fishing stocks. China is hoping to impose more
Beijing-friendly governance rules for regional access and resource
exploitation.17

Chinese Arctic activities must be understood as fundamentally
dual-purpose. Its military presence in the Arctic has thus far remained
limited but suspicions arise that scientific research presence feeds
intelligence and domain awareness18 --- not least to bridge China's
learning curve in cold weather operations. China is also managing a
fleet of polar-specific satellites as part of the BeiDou system and
investing in modern satellite technology.19 It plans to deploy a
large-scale network of dual-use listening devices in the Arctic Ocean20
as part of the Underwater Great Wall21 --- all of which could be used
for military purposes. Suspicions also abound that Beijing is seeking to
increase its military footprint in the Arctic,22 notably with the
People's Liberation Army Navy, to sustain its strategic ambitions, and
its commercial presence with the Transpolar Sea Route and future
resource exploitation.23

Russia and China have been displaying symbolic attempts at closer Arctic
cooperation --- such as the signature in April 2023 of a memorandum of
understanding strengthening cooperation between the Russian Federal
Security Service (FSB) Border Service (Coast Guard and Border Guard) and
the Chinese Coast Guard24 --- although the agreement is not Arctic
specific. They are also conducting a growing number of joint aerial
exercises and patrols close to the Pacific Arctic, such as near the
Japanese,25 South Korean,26 and Alaskan27 air defense identification
zones (ADIZs), as well as joint maritime drills,28 including close to
the Aleutian Islands and off the US exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the
Bering Sea.29 However, such bilateral cooperation has remained mostly
symbolic and politically valuable --- not least because these efforts
retain Western attention and lead to exaggerations about their
significance.

Overall, Sino-Russian Arctic interactions are characterized chiefly by
friction and mistrust rather than partnership.30 As in energy or
economic development, the deepening of bilateral defense and military
cooperation in the Arctic is shadowed by each country's long-term
objectives in governance and security. Greater Chinese activity may lead
to a "strategic culture clash."31

Against this picture, **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** and allied
**[[presence is still lacking]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Though the Arctic
is no longer a blind spot for the United States, persistent gaps in
critical capabilities prevent complete domain awareness. These include

cold weather hardware;

ice-strengthened assets;

early warning threat detection systems and air defense;

radar coverage; and

aerial domain awareness, subsea sensing, logistics, and resupplies.

Command-and-control responsibilities still overlap among US commands,
NATO structures, and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).
More fundamentally, the United States, Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway,
Sweden, and Finland, known as the Arctic 7, do not fully agree in their
approach to the region --- especially in terms of diverging national
views on circumpolar security, what constitutes defense priorities, and
geographical priorities **[[across the Arctic
theater]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

\[mto\]

One implication of Russia's actions in the Arctic involves the
continuation of suspicion and mistrust between Russia and the U.S./NATO
in the future, especially considering Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
The **[U.S.]{.underline}** and NATO may reasonably continue to view
Russia's actions in the Arctic with heightened suspicion and increase
their own respective **[military presences and capabilities in the
Arctic]{.underline}** to **[bolster]{.underline}** their own
self-defense capacities. The current perspectives of each side viewing
the other as presenting a potential security threat leads to continuing
**[cycles of mutual distrust and uncertainty]{.underline}** between
Russia and the U.S./NATO in the Arctic. Geopolitical tensions and
suspicions will continue to increase as **[this cycle]{.underline}**
continues, which **[may result in a destabilizing and increasingly
offensive posture in the region]{.underline}**. U.S. Secretary of
Defense Lloyd Austin has cited "the importance of maintaining lines of
communication \[with Russia\] amid the ongoing war" in Ukraine.
Maintaining open diplomatic and military lines of communication between
the U.S. and Moscow on Arctic matters may be one way to help minimize
misperceptions by either country in the Arctic to help reduce tensions
or avoid **[misperceptions]{.underline}** that **[could lead to
accidental escalation]{.underline}**.

Furthermore, **[the outcome]{.underline}** of Russia's war in Ukraine
**[bears the potential to influence future security and
stability]{.underline}** in the Arctic regarding Russia's future on the
Arctic Council. Composed of the eight Arctic states (the U.S., Canada,
Denmark, Norway, and Russia, Finland, Iceland, and Sweden), the Council
is a consensus-based intergovernmental forum designed to facilitate
cooperation and collaboration on Arctic concerns and which thereby
contributes to stability in the region. As a response to the onset of
Russia's invasion to Ukraine, the seven other members of the Council
(the "Arctic 7") suspended political activities and high-level meetings.
While projects that did not involve Russia resumed as early as the
summer of 2022, this decision has pushed back the progress of
inter-Arctic dialogue and cooperation. Regardless of whether Russia
should win or lose the war in Ukraine, the Arctic 7 may seek the
eventual re-normalization of Russia into Council activities to resume
full-scale Arctic coordination and cooperation. The Arctic 7 may
reluctantly prefer this option over the continued isolation of the
largest Arctic state, which would undermine the fundamental vision of
circumpolar cooperation that prompted the Council's creation in the
first place.

**[The Arctic remains an evolving arena for geopolitical competition
between Russia and the U.S]{.underline}**. and its Arctic NATO allies,
particularly as tensions have increased following Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. To help mitigate risks and preserve stability in the Arctic,
Russia and the U.S., along with the rest of the Arctic 7 countries, must
take care to ensure that **[increased human activity and military
capabilities in the region]{.underline}** do not **[lead to accidental
or inadvertent escalation caused by miscommunication or
misinterpretation of each other's actions]{.underline}**. Despite the
ongoing war in Ukraine, maintaining lines of diplomatic and military
communication with Russia on Arctic matters and re-normalizing Russia's
participation on the Arctic Council to help bolster Arctic cooperation
and stability may be effective methods to help do so.

#### U.S. tech deployment in the Arctic triggers Russian miliary paranoia

the Arctic,"

\[mto\]

**[Russia remains sensitive to increases in US military assets in the
Arctic]{.underline}**, but the use of Coast Guard assets for the
purposes of a Russo-American search-and-rescue exercise should not
result in further degradation of American-Russo relations. Any such
exercises will be used by the Russia to gather intelligence on US
capabilities, but they will also provide a similar opportunity to the
US. That being said, **[the US can minimize this risk by ensuring any
assets deployed to the exercises do not contain sensitive equipment,
intelligence, or capabilities. This could mean completely restricting
the use of unmanned aircraft technology]{.underline}**.

### Link -- icebreakers

#### Russia has icebreaker hegemony now -- new U.S. ships in the Arctic is a direct challenge to its identity and geopolitical status

Michał **Chabros '20**, May 18, a political scientist, diplomat, and
official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Poland.
He worked at diplomatic missions in Nur-Sultan and Minsk, "The Arctic
Icebreaker: Russia's Security Policy in the Far North," WARSAW
INSTITUTE,

\[mto\]

Fourthly, **[Moscow]{.underline}** is unfolding its fleet of
nuclear-powered **[icebreakers]{.underline}** that **[are vital to its
efforts to go ahead with operational capabilities both for civilian and
military purposes]{.underline}**. The first nuclear powered Soviet ship
was the icebreaker Lenin ---- commissioned in 1959. Since then, the
Soviet Union and then Russia expanded the fleet of icebreakers in
service. Russia today has a total of four nuclear-powered icebreakers in
operation: Yamal, 50 Let Pobedy, Taymyr, and Vaigash. A fleet comprises
also the nuclear-powered container carrier Sevmorput. The Artika vessel
alongside two more Project 22220 icebreakers ---- the Sibir and the Ural
---- all belong to a brand-new generation of Russian ice-breaking ships.
The world's largest vessels of that kind will have a capability to break
through 3-metre thick ice\[23\]. Despite some delays for the Project
22220, **[Russia's monopoly on icebreaker operations has largely gone
unchallenged]{.underline}**. Since 2008, Russia's ice-breaking vessels
have been managed by Rosatomflot, a subsidiary of Rosatom. These are
indispensable for civilian shipping along the Northern Sea Route\[24\].
Besides, **[the fleet has a crucial military significance as
ice-breaking ships enable year-round deliveries to the country's newly
built facilities farther in the north ---- and thus these can operate
independently from weather conditions. Also, the vessels can carry both
goods and cargo loads in a move that facilitates the construction of new
military infrastructure in the Far North]{.underline}**.

The Arctic in the Russian political understanding

**[The Arctic holds a special place in Russian political thinking
because it symbolises the country's global might and its significance
worldwide. Perhaps like no other, this geographical area comes as
Moscow's efforts to harness a perception of the state whose interests
and activities reach far beyond ---- thus globally. The Arctic displays
the continuity of Russian interests]{.underline}** ---- regardless of
the ideology and form it took in the past ---- from an array of
systematic actions in the late 19th century and the early 20th century
to present-day times. The Arctic remained high on the agenda of senior
politicians ---- as evidenced by what the Russian President once said.
"This region has traditionally been a sphere of our special interest,"
Putin declared, adding that the Arctic is "a concentration of
practically all aspects of national security\[25\]." For his part,
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu stated that "a permanent military
presence in the Arctic is considered as part of Russia's national
security policy\[26\]." For a wider audience, Russian attempts to
"retrieve the Arctic" materialise themselves through an array of
expeditions of paramilitary or youth groups ---- like that in April
2015, when Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin headed to the
North Pole.

A special place of the Far North has undergone some changes throughout
the history of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, then the Russian Empire, the
Soviet Union, until the present-day Russian Federation. Even though the
focus was placed differently back then, one thing remained unchanged
---- with the North being subject to somewhat colonisation, whether it
be military, economic, or social while creating a staging ground to
project the country's power. **[For Russia, the Far North is a
life-giving space. A lot of room was devoted to it in Russian culture
---- with the region holding links to the deed, heroism, and
pride]{.underline}**. Dmitry Likhachev, an outstanding Russian
intellectual and literary historian, once wrote that the country's tie
with the North depends on what he named as podvig, an untranslatable
Russian word referring to extraordinary feats, heroism, and fame, all of
them stretching within a definite area\[27\]. **[The Arctic
is]{.underline}** where Moscow seeks to convey the all-inclusive idea
invested in the world podvig ---- **[a mighty source of pride and a
symbol of power]{.underline}**.

Three Far North cities ---- Arkhangelsk, Murmansk, and Norilsk ---- are
vital to Russian expansion in the Arctic.

The Far North had not emerged in Russian politics until the late 16th
century when Arkhangelsk first appeared on world maps. Between 1583 and
1584, thus in the twilight of his reign, Ivan the Terrible founded the
city once he had suffered a defeat in wars for a Baltic foothold. Long
controlled solely by the Russians, Arkhangelsk was slated to occupy the
role of Russia's window on the world. Though it initially had attracted
groups of English and Dutch merchants, once the Time of Troubles took a
firm grip on the country, following by the country's self-isolation from
the world throughout the 17th century, Arkhangelsk never had a chance to
play any bigger role in trade\[28\]. From the early 18th century
onwards, Russia shifted its trade to Baltic ports while a century later
---- to the Black Sea. Arkhangelsk morphed into a starting point for any
expedition that the Russian state bankrolled eagerly since the time of
Peter the Great and that aimed to explore the Arctic ---- as a proof of
his effective reign over the country. Not only did Russian Northern
expeditions throughout the 18th and 19th century bring fresh knowledge
of the Far North, they grew the awareness among the Russian elites of
their country's role in the Arctic ---- a special mission it\[29\] of
sorts needed to accomplish there.

Just as a side note, it is worth recalling here the figure of Jan
Nagórski, a rather forgotten Polish aviator, the first person to fly an
airplane in the Arctic back in 1914. Nagórski made flights over the
coasts of Novaya Zemlya and the Barents Sea in the search for the Sedov,
Brusilov, and Rusanov expeditions. Yet as the war broke out back then,
the world did not get not enough information about Nagórski's feat ----
and therefore it is crucial to recall what he did and who\[30\] he was.
The remote Nagurskoye base was even named after the Polish pilot.

Russia's interest in the Far North took a whole new meaning in the early
20th century. With a worldwide conundrum, the country's senior officials
in St. Petersburg had to get a closer look at Russian exports whose vast
majority arrived further in the world through either the Baltic or Black
Sea ports. Had any hindrances emerged back then, the authorities in
Berlin or Istanbul ---- both hostile to Russia in their policies ----
could have blocked any shipping through the Danish or Turkish straits.
In consequence, Russian civilian and military shipments might have been
obstructed ---- and while the country's borders stretching from the
Baltic Sea to the Black Sea were those with states that belong to the
opposite political and military bloc ---- the situation grew dire in
some ways. Therefore, it was decided to build a new port on the northern
coast of the Kola peninsula, able to accommodate sea traffic year-round.
The ice-free port of Murmansk would be connected by railroad with St.
Petersburg, according to memoirs of Sergei Witte.\[31\] Construction of
the Romanov-on-Murman (now Murmansk) port had yet not begun until 1914.
It boasted its significance during World War II when it received US
military deliveries to the Soviet Union. Today, Murmansk is by far the
biggest port in the Arctic.

As time went by, the Arctic's further "mooring" in the Russian political
understanding was then tainted with some specific Soviet-like features.
What comes as the third biggest symbol of the Russian Arctic ---- just
after Arkhangelsk and Murmansk ---- is Norilsk, known as one of the
world's northernmost town. Since 1937, it has been home to the
copper-nickel mining centre. Throughout the late 1920s and the early
1930s, the area grew bigger when Gulag labour camp inmates were forced
to work there. Besides Norilsk, the prisoners dug the vast mineral
resources of Vorkuta and Kolyma, built the city of Magadan, as well as
the seaports of Dudinka, Igarka, or Dixon. Added to them were road links
and railways, including the infamous Kolyma Highway, meant to move both
prisoners themselves and the fruits of their work\[32\]. Yet in Soviet
party propaganda, the Arctic's dark side gave way to heroic deeds of the
"Soviet man", a hero who made successful efforts to harness the Far
North. In 1934, the whole country watched with bated breath the rescue
of the crew of steam ship Chelyuskin. The courageous Chelyuskintsy, as
the crew members were named, emerged as an example of the Soviet
strength and capabilities in the fight against harsh climate. Those who
took part in the rescue operation were made Heroes of the Soviet Union,
a new distinction awarded for heroic feats in service to the Soviet
state and society\[33\]. In the 1930s, cargo ships used for the first
time to sail along the Northern Sea Route. In 1932, the icebreaker
Sibiriakov set off on a voyage, making the first successful crossing of
the Northern Sea Route in a single navigation. The Arctic turned into a
magical area where the determination of the "Soviet man" ---- working
under the enlightened leadership of the communist party ---- could
overcome all obstacles while proving limitless possibilities of Soviet
science and technology.

Both World War II and **[the decades-long Cold War]{.underline}** that
followed grew into further factors that **[shifted]{.underline}** and
somewhat complemented **[the Arctic's image in Russian political
thought]{.underline}**. Their impact is still being felt. **[What
emerged]{.underline}** back then **[was the huge military significance
of the Arctic that grew simultaneously as new military developments saw
the light of day]{.underline}**. While during World War II its strategic
role (apart from its raw material base) was to supply allied equipment
through the port of Murmansk, the ensuing decades brought a steady
increase in the importance of the Arctic, first and foremost as one of
the arenas for Russian-US struggles. **[The Arctic began to serve a
role]{.underline}** it is occupying to this day ---- that **[of the main
arena of global struggle with the United States]{.underline}**. This yet
did not come out of nowhere, with an air corridor stretching over the
North Pole being the shortest route from the Soviet Union to the United
States\[34\]. Strenuous efforts were made to extend military
infrastructure, including airfields and ports along the Northern Sea
Route ---- devised as the core of the present-day refurbishments in the
Arctic.

The Northern Fleet, or **[the fleet of the Russian Navy in the Arctic,
took on a profound significance as a tool for rivalry]{.underline}**. In
its very origins, the Russian Navy was founded by Peter the Great on the
basis of foreign patterns, and it conveyed the very idea of Russian
imperial power far stronger than ground forces. The Tsar saw the fleet
as a key tool for upgrading the state. While competing with the army for
the funding throughout the whole 19th century, the Russian Navy
cherished in the country's top officials a sense of belonging to the
elite club of the world's maritime superpowers ---- though doubts arose
around its combat capabilities (the Russo-Japanese war) or even
restrained strategic importance (as during whole World War I)\[35\].
With the Cold War, came the need to dust off old imperial-like ideas and
patterns, yet in a brand-new packaging. Headquartered just off Murmansk,
the Northern Fleet turned into the leading part of the Soviet Navy. Just
like the Imperial Navy under Peter the Great or Nicholas II, it offered
the leadership of the Communist Party a sense of belonging to an elite,
two-member club of the world's biggest decision-makers. Hence, the
Northern Fleet held a prominent place in the Russian Armed Force, with
the Arctic being somewhat privileged amongst other theatres. In 1958,
the Northern Fleet raised the Soviet Navy ensign over the first Soviet
nuclear submarine, Leninskiy Komsomol. Due to its peculiarities, the
Arctic offered optimum conditions for air operations, allowing Russian
aircraft to intercept incoming enemy strategic bombers, as well as naval
ones, chiefly in participation with submarines. By 1990, Novaya Zemlya
had surged as the site for approximately 130 tests, of which a total of
39 were conducted atmospherically\[36\]. Thus, the Arctic became the key
tool for sustaining the Soviet-US rivalry ---- right until the demise of
the Soviet Union.

Who else in the Arctic?

As written above, Russian dominance in the Arctic sees an internally
rooted justification. With international policies, **[Moscow enjoys
quite comfortable room for manoeuvre in the Arctic]{.underline}**,
though **[amidst arising challenges, Russian senior officials feel
compelled to devise some answers]{.underline}** in both medium and long
term.

From a military point of view, there are now just two states able to
play a pivotal role in the Arctic. These are Russia and the United
States. Other Arctic littoral nations, like Canada, Norway, Denmark, and
Iceland, focus on environmental and economic aspects instead. Their
security-related activities are restrained locally ---- thus as part of
NATO operations as all of them belong to the military bloc.

**[Russia]{.underline}** now **[sees the United States as its chief
rival]{.underline}**. Since the Soviet era, **[the Arctic has brought
in]{.underline}** an **[immense potential for]{.underline}** the Russian
military might whose top goal is to combat any threats to Moscow's
interests ---- mainly those having links to the United States. **[A hot
rivalry between their military units]{.underline}** ---- whether they be
armed forces or proxies, like Russia's PMC Wagner Group ---- is taking
place in an array of hotspots around the globe, with the Middle East at
the helm. On the flip side, the Arctic is not as high on the US policy
agenda.

In June 2019, the US Department of Defense passed its new Arctic
Strategy, or the state's top policy document\[37\]. In its strategy, US
defence officials identified the current state of affairs in the Arctic
as "an era of strategic competition." The paper placed a special
emphasis on how the international environment affected the Arctic in
many areas, including security. Further in the document, the US
Department of Defense noticed Russia's heightened military presence
above the Arctic Circle while signalling China's growing interest in the
region. Aware of the ever-growing importance of the Arctic, the paper
outlined three strategic ways in support of the desired Arctic
end-state: building Arctic awareness, enhancing Arctic operations, and
strengthening the rules-based order in the Arctic. With this approach to
the Arctic, Washington displays two major things. First, the US
awareness of how crucial the region is lags somewhere in the background.
Secondly, **[the scale of US operations throughout the Arctic ---- be it
operations or new military facilities ---- is restrained, especially if
compared to Russia]{.underline}**. What comes to the fore as a top
explanation are distinct perceptions of the Arctic, both in the US and
Russia. The region is essential to Moscow's vitality ---- an area of its
decades-long interests to be traced back much earlier than just the Cold
War era. This is the region that boasts a well-grounded position in the
awareness of Russian top decision-makers.

### Link -- indigenous peoples

#### Indigenous interests in the Arctic are geopolitically symbolic among conflicting parties

Renate **Bridenthal '23**, 2-8, "The Arctic is the next frontier in the
new cold war," GEOPOLITICAL ECONOMY,
https://geopoliticaleconomy.com/2023/02/28/arctic-new-cold-war-us-russia-china/
\[mto\]

**[The heightened tension over the Northwest Passage has led the
Canadian government to court its Inuit population]{.underline}**, whose
settlement area encompasses most of the Northwest Passage routes.

The land claims agreement of 1993, however, does not give the Indigenous
people authority over marine areas, only consultation.

This agreement was successfully employed in the Inuit statement
supporting Canada's rebuttal to former U.S. Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo, who bluntly denounced Ottawa's claim over the Northwest Passage
as "illegitimate."

**[Environmental issues and the lives of Indigenous peoples gain
attention in this political whirlpool]{.underline}**, but mainly
rhetorically.

**[The damage wrought by the fossil fuel industry and more recently by
new technologies of "green" mining continue to push First Nations
further off their lands, imperiling their natural foods]{.underline}**.

**[But they are assuming a stronger political voice in the upcoming
rivalries between their respective nation-states]{.underline}**.

**[Both the Inuit peoples of the western Arctic and the Sami of the
eastern Arctic have developed circumpolar organizations that participate
in the governance of the Arctic]{.underline}**.

**[The states that colonized them and in which they are now minorities
are taking a greater interest in maintaining their loyalty and in
acquiring their knowledge of Arctic conditions in case of
conflicts]{.underline}**.

The Inuit of the western region of the U.S., Canada, and Greenland total
an estimated 180.000 population.

16,500 are in Alaska, organized into the Alaska Federation of Nations.
The resolutions of its October 2022 annual meeting reflect resentment of
many hardships: the decline in stock of fisheries threatening native
food security; a drug epidemic of fentanyl, heroin, and methamphetamine;
a high incidence of domestic violence, sexual violence, and missing and
murdered people; waste and contaminants left by the military and other
governmental agencies; ongoing seizure of native lands; and insufficient
access to education and business.

Especially poignant is a resolution "imploring the state of Alaska to
end its practice of requiring tribal waivers of sovereign immunity as a
condition for receiving grant funds."

The more than 70,000 Inuit in Canada are largely urbanized, due to a
long history of forced assimilation. With high unemployment, low wages
and substandard housing, they have significant food insecurity, a high
rate of imprisonment, and youth suicide.

In the 1970s, an organization of Inuit was formed to protect their
individual and cultural rights, as well as land claims. It is part of
the Inuit Circumpolar Council, which connects with Inuit in Alaska and
Greenland, and has connections with the United Nations.

The Sami are a historically nomadic herding people who once roamed
freely and are now divided with approximately 20,000 in Sweden, 50,000
in Norway, 8,000 in Finland and 2,000 in Russia.

In all of these states, they suffer from ongoing land grabs, which
interfere with reindeer grazing routes; discrimination; and violent
racism. The deliberate killing of reindeer herds have plagued the Sami
in Sweden, despite government attempts at reconciliation and some
funding.

The Sami in Finland similarly suffer loss of land, inhibition of
reindeer herding, and lack of power over access to resources on their
remaining land. Finland now touts cultural tourism of the Sami.

The Sami in Norway have organized against infrastructure projects that
threaten even more land loss, to little avail.

The Sami in Russia, the smallest group, reestablished contact with the
others in 1991. Their urban conditions are not better than that of the
Sami elsewhere, but their reindeer herding has a unique problem.

They had been organized into cooperatives which now have difficulty
readjusting to new conditions of ongoing industrialization. As
elsewhere, this development continues to usurp their pasture lands. In
addition, tourist fishing has reduced their food supply.

Like the Inuit, the Sami have a circumpolar organization for common
interests, a Sami Council consisting of three Parliaments representing
the indigenous peoples of Sweden, Norway, and Finland. The Russian Sami
are represented by NGOs.

The war in Ukraine has created a split among the Sami. In April 2022,
the Council suspended formal relations with the Russian group, which
supported the Russian Federation, portending the incursion of sub-Arctic
politics into the polar region.

The relatively peaceful days of the Arctic are over. Its warming is
turning up the geopolitical heat in the polar region, bringing to mind
an old adage: "What happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic."

### A2 coop link turns

#### Russia sees cooperation merely as an entry point for power politics -- if the plan is truly concessionary it will only greenlight Russian aggression

Maria **Domanska '24**, October 16, "Lost in Translation: Western
Misconceptions about Putin's Russia," CENTER FOR EUROPEAN POLICY
ANALYSIS,
https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/lost-in-translation-western-misconceptions-about-putins-russia/

Key Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendations

**[Using assumptions derived from Western strategic culture to
understand Moscow is counterproductive and dangerous. Russia's strategic
culture is based on values, ideas, and rules that are fundamentally
different from those of the democratic West. It privileges state
sovereignty and security based on the logic of a zero-sum game, the
arbitrary will of the rulers, and using force in international
relations, while it sidelines the question of international law and
human rights in international conflicts]{.underline}**.1 **[Russia
regards Western readiness for dialogue and attempts at de-escalation as
weakness and a green light for further aggression. The modus operandi of
Russia's ruling elite is informed by a way of thinking with roots in the
secret services and the criminal world]{.underline}**.

**[The Kremlin sees]{.underline}** democratic values as the greatest
security threat and **[the West as an existential, systemic enemy. The
logic of a zero-sum game excludes negotiations understood as a path to
compromise, while violence is seen as a natural part of
diplomacy]{.underline}**. An **[imperial]{.underline}** state that
instills **[fear]{.underline}** abroad **[is the core of Russian
national identity]{.underline}**.

**[For Russia, war is an all-encompassing endeavor with a strong
cognitive component. It incorporates a variety of "peacetime" techniques
(including the weaponization of language) designed to prepare for or
replace a military attack. Primary among them is reflexive control,
which aims to steer Western decisions to benefit Russia's strategic
interests]{.underline}** and undermine democratic institutions.

#### Russia is not a good-faith partner -- cooperation is strictly a platform for manipulating the USA

Maria **Domanska '24**, October 16, "Lost in Translation: Western
Misconceptions about Putin's Russia," CENTER FOR EUROPEAN POLICY
ANALYSIS,
https://cepa.org/comprehensive-reports/lost-in-translation-western-misconceptions-about-putins-russia/
\[mto\]

As a result, **[Russian strategic culture has the following
characteristics]{.underline}**:

1\. Democratic values, presented as the West's secret weapon against
"Russian civilization," are seen as the most significant security
threat.

This threat must be combated by all means, including military force.
**[The West is seen as an existential enemy in a clash of
civilizations]{.underline}**. This **[fear and loathing springs not from
what Western politicians do or say, but from what the West
is]{.underline}**. **[Russia views NATO]{.underline}** to a large extent
**[as a tool for]{.underline}** the **[expansion]{.underline}** of the
Western democratic community and an effective instrument for its
defense. NATO's alleged **[encroaching on what is imagined as Russia's
sphere of influence]{.underline}** was rather a pretext than a reason
for the 2014 and 2022 invasion: Before Russian aggression there was no
serious discussion about Kyiv's membership in NATO, either within the
alliance or in Ukraine.15

In what is presented as a holy war of so-called traditional values
against the "Satanism" of the West, Russia needs a forward defense and a
cordon sanitaire to prevent harmful ideas from contaminating Russian
society.16 Moscow also strives to fight the evil at its source, hence
the attempts to influence the domestic political situation in Western
democracies to polarize societies and undermine their confidence in
their governments and democratic procedures.

2\. Russia's destructive potential determines its international
standing.

Unable to build its international position on innovation and attractive
soft power, Russia presents the destructive potential of its nuclear
arsenal as the most critical indicator of its strength.17 War crimes are
intended to punish Kyiv for choosing the path of democratic development
and integration into the transatlantic community and to force other
"post-Soviet" states into Russia's so-called sphere of privileged
interests in the spirit of the 1945 Yalta agreement.

3\. **[International politics is perceived, above all, as a sphere of
confrontation]{.underline}**, constant struggle among secret services,
and permanent special operations. Its instruments include a range of
active measures aimed at destroying the opponent's ability to resist.18
**[Manipulation, deception, and blackmail go hand in hand with a high
propensity to take risks]{.underline}**.

4\. Russia is guided by the logic of a zero-sum game. This approach
rules out negotiations as Western political culture understands them.
**[The Russian negotiating style resembles the practices of an army,
which does not negotiate but sets conditions from a position of
strength]{.underline}**.19 Similarly, **[there should be no illusion
that Russia is willing to cooperate with a "hostile" West about jointly
combating global threats]{.underline}** (especially given its
announcement to supply third parties with weapons for attacks on the
West).20 **[Although Russia has cooperated in some areas in the past,
its ultimatums of 2021 signaled a more dire stage in relations with the
West]{.underline}**.

5\. **[The leadership model, like that of the criminal world, is based
on "hegemonic masculinity." Intimidation, contempt for the weak, and a
willingness to retaliate for real or perceived insults serve to
demonstrate strength and brutality, which are the primary source of
legitimacy]{.underline}**.21 **[Conciliatory language, calls for
dialogue, and compromise are perceived as weakness, and weakness is an
invitation to aggression]{.underline}**.22

6\. The instruments of defense against perceived threats are not a
priori limited. There are no predetermined rules and no red lines that
must not be crossed.23

7\. Force is seen as a natural part of diplomacy and a rule-making
factor that replaces the existing system of written law.24

8\. **[Foreign policy is based on extortion]{.underline}**. Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko advised his diplomats: "Demand something
that never belonged to you. Make ultimatums. Do not spare threats; offer
negotiations as a way out of the situation. **[There will always be
people in the West who will fall for it]{.underline}**. Do not give an
inch in negotiations, but squeeze out more. They will go for it. You can
consider yourself a diplomat when you get half or two-thirds of what you
did not have before."25

political influence and engaging in direct negotiations, [the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has set the
stage for a transformed world order]{.mark} where cooperation prevails
over confrontation.]{.underline} Why Were Diplomatic Relations Broken?
The diplomatic rupture between Washington and Moscow began in 2016 with
U.S. accusations of Russian interference in the presidential elections.
Tensions escalated further in 2018 when the U.S. expelled Russian
diplomats over allegations of poisoning a former Russian intelligence
officer in the United Kingdom. However, the breaking point came in 2022,
after the start of Russia\'s special military operation in Ukraine. In
response, the United States imposed harsh sanctions, expelled Russian
envoys, and restricted the operations of Russian diplomatic missions.
These measures triggered reciprocal actions from Moscow, leaving both
embassies understaffed and bilateral relations at an all-time low.
Negative Impacts of Severed Diplomatic Ties The deterioration of
U.S.-Russia relations had severe consequences, affecting not just the
two nations but the entire global community: Lack of Communication: With
diplomatic missions largely inoperative, direct dialogue between the two
nuclear powers was nearly impossible, increasing the risk of
miscalculations and conflicts. Geopolitical Fragmentation: The hostility
between the U.S. and Russia deepened global divisions, particularly in
Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine disrupted political and economic
stability. Economic Consequences: Trade restrictions and sanctions
significantly affected global markets, particularly in energy and
agriculture, leading to inflation and supply chain disruptions. Military
Escalation: The absence of direct negotiations fueled military
confrontations in Ukraine, increasing the human and financial costs.
Global Security Concerns: The lack of U.S.-Russia engagement exacerbated
conflicts in Syria, the Arctic, and other strategic regions, affecting
global security frameworks. [The Benefits of Restoring Diplomatic
Relations]{.underline} With the agreement fully restoring diplomatic
functions, [a new chapter in U.S.-Russia relations has begun.
[This]{.mark} move [carries **significant benefits:**]{.mark} [Ending
the Ukraine Conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} on Russian Terms: The Riyadh
[talks indicate a [shift toward a realistic resolution]{.mark} of the
conflict in Ukraine. [With]{.mark} President [Trump prioritizing
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline} over prolonged military engagement, the
conflict is likely to conclude in a manner favorable to Russia. This
means Ukraine will not join NATO, and Russia's territorial gains will be
acknowledged. Erosion of NATO's Influence: With the U.S. signaling a
reduced commitment to European security, NATO's role is set to diminish.
This shift aligns with Russia's long-standing objective of limiting
Western military presence near its borders. [[Economic
Revival]{.underline}]{.mark}: The resumption of diplomatic ties is
expected to lead to the [lifting of sanctions, [allowing Russia to
reintegrate]{.mark} into global trade networks. This [will benefit
energy markets, stabilize commodity prices,]{.mark} and foster economic
cooperation. [Enhanced]{.mark} Strategic [Coop]{.mark}eration: The
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Russia

### Impact -- Relations solve extinction impacts

#### US-Russia cooperation solves a [litany]{.underline} of existential risks.

\[TMS---GK\]

The Arctic, warming four times faster than the rest of the world, may be
the key region for the US and Russia to advance cooperation. [[US-Russia
**rapprochement**]{.mark} may broadly benefit the world by bringing an
[end]{.mark} to]{.underline} the disastrous [[war in **Ukraine** and
reducing]{.mark} the [risk of **nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
existential environmental issues still demand attention.

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region as
a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: "We need to pursue joint
projects, including, for example, in the Arctic." The Arctic region
makes sense as a setting for cooperation as the two sides have
explicitly expressed interest in exploring cooperation in energy,
investment, and geopolitical issues. Western sanctions on Russia have
led Moscow to step up its cooperation in the Arctic with China in joint
energy ventures and grand plans for Arctic shipping. US officials now
see Arctic cooperation as a potential means to "drive a wedge" between
Moscow and Beijing.

In my meetings in Moscow with [American and Russian]{.underline}
diplomats and businessmen over the past few weeks, it is clear that many
are interested in diverse forms of [[Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}, from cultural diplomacy that
celebrates the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the
Bering Strait, to [scientific diplomacy]{.underline} to [understand and
[**adapt** to **climate hazards**]{.mark} faced by **both**
nations]{.underline}. Business interests, however, are at the top of the
agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the countries' diplomatic missions will significantly reduce the
current obstacles to [US-Russia scientific [**cooperation** in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. By making it easier to issue visas and
travel between the two countries, [Americans and Russians
will]{.underline} again [be able to conduct **[joint
research]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[expeditions]{.underline}**]{.mark},
and scientific conferences [[and]{.mark} build **[models]{.mark}** to
[better understand]{.mark} the]{.underline} unfolding
[**[climate]{.mark}** emergency]{.underline}. Scientific cooperation to
understand the changes affecting sea ice, permafrost, ecosystems, and
local communities has been blunted by the political fallout of the war
in Ukraine.

[[Cooperation]{.mark} in the Arctic can help [build **regional
stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More importantly, [Arctic cooperation
will build [**trust** between the US and Russia
that]{.mark}]{.underline} could complement or [[**spill over**
into]{.mark} other [**crucial** fields]{.mark}]{.underline} of
cooperation [such as **[arms control]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [**Middle
East** peace]{.underline}, [and **global health**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

and Columbia University; \"Why Russia and America Need Each Other,\"

\"The main message I have today is that [we need to **awaken to the
importance** of the relationship between Russia and the United
States;]{.underline} [we should not leave it on **auto-pilot
indefinitely,\"**]{.underline} [said Dmitri Trenin, senior associate and
deputy director, Carnegie Moscow Center]{.underline}, at a 2 February
2007 seminar at the Kennan Institute. Trenin recounted the current
problems in the relationship, arguing that both sides have unrealistic
expectations of one another. In his view, [the U.S.-Russian relationship
is of **crucial importance**]{.underline}, and he described ways in
which relations could be improved.

\"At the beginning of this year, the talk in both capitals is rather
downbeat,\" Trenin said, adding, \"I think people agree more or less
that we have never had a relationship that was at such a low level as
today since 1991.\" Trenin said that this is true in spite of what he
sees as a great deal of shared interests between the two countries.

[According to Trenin, the **deterioration** of U.S.-Russian relations is
viewed in **starkly different terms** in Washington and in
Moscow.]{.underline} \"If you put your ear to the ground in Washington,
it\'s all because of Putin\'s authoritarianism at home, and increasing
assertiveness abroad,\" Trenin said. He added that Washington views
Russia\'s increased strength as a direct result of its large exports of
oil and natural gas, and for this reason Russia\'s resurgence is seen as
both undeserved and fragile.

\"If you listen in Moscow, you get a very different story,\" Trenin
observed. Prevailing opinion in Moscow regards the heightened tension
between the United States and Russia as a natural consequence of
Russia\'s increased strength. Russia\'s leadership believes that
tensions inevitably arise when one power gains strength rapidly while
another country\'s power diminishes, Trenin stated.

Both of these views are wrong, Trenin believes. \"Despite what some
people in Russia hope, the United States is not a declining power, Iraq
notwithstanding,\" he stated. \"As the world\'s most important nation,
it will be around for a long time.\" [On the other hand, he continued,
Russia is **more important** than most Americans realize. \"Despite what
a number of people in the U.S. have concluded, Russia **is not so much
in decline**; it is rather in the process of **reformatting itself**,
emerging as a **totally different economy** and **a totally different
society** than the Soviet one,\"]{.underline} Trenin said.

The steady deterioration of relations is threatening to jeopardize
future Russian-American partnership and cooperation, Trenin warned:
\"The U.S. and Russia may be straying into the territory of direct
material damage to their existing interests.\" He noted that this
situation is not likely to change until the respective American and
Russian presidential elections in 2008. [Both of the new presidents will
probably be untested statesmen, and thus an opportunity for
**reinventing the relationship** will arise.]{.underline}

In spite of these disagreements, Trenin emphasized that [Russia and the
United States **need one another** and that cooperation between the two
countries is **essential**.]{.underline} [On a **wide range of
issues,**]{.underline} [U.S. and Russian interests coincide, including
**non-proliferation** of weapons of **mass destruction**]{.underline},
**[managing the rise of China]{.underline}**, [dealing with the
difficult situation in the Middle East, and resolving \"frozen
conflicts.\"]{.underline} In addition, [Russia needs American assistance
to modernize and integrate its economy into the global market, and to
gain access to American markets]{.underline}, he said. [The United
States **needs Russia\'s cooperation** in the **fight against
terrorism**,]{.underline} he said. [Positive relations between the two
countries would **lead to a more stable world,**]{.underline} [and would
enhance both countries\' security.]{.underline}

In connection with this, Trenin believes that [a new global institution
needs to be formed to **maintain stability and security**.]{.underline}
[This]{.underline} organization would be similar to the G-8, in that it
[would provide a forum for the discussion of major problems confronting
the world,]{.underline} he said, but would be more inclusive than the
G-8, because it would not require a country to be \"democratic.\" The
group could include all the G-8 members, as well as China, India, and
Brazil. Russia wants to be given a seat at the table where decisions are
made, Trenin stressed, and such an organization could be one way to
accomplish this goal.

### Impact -- U.S.-Russia nuclear war

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even in an all-out
[nuclear war between the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark},
despite horrific casualties, [neither country's population is likely to
be completely destroyed **by the direct effects of the
blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The [aftermath could be
**much worse**]{.mark}]{.underline}: the [burning]{.underline} of
[flammable materials could send massive amounts of smoke into the
atmosphere]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight and cause sustained
global cooling, severe ozone loss, and agricultural disruption -- **[a
nuclear winter]{.underline}**. According to one model 9 , [an all-out
exchange of [4,000 weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}10 [could lead to a drop
in global temperatures of around 8°C, [making it **impossible to grow
food**]{.mark} **for**]{.underline} 4 to [**5 years**. This could leave
some survivors]{.underline} in parts of Australia and New Zealand, [but
they would be in a very precarious situation and the **[threat of
extinction]{.mark} from other sources [would be great]{.mark}**. An
[exchange]{.mark} on this scale [is **only possible between the US and
Russia** who have]{.mark} more than [90% of the world's]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around 4,500 warheads
each, although many are not operationally deployed.11 Some models
suggest that even [a small [regional nuclear war]{.mark} involving 100
nuclear weapons would]{.underline} produce a nuclear winter serious
enough to [put two billion]{.underline} people [at risk]{.underline} of
starvation,12 [though this]{.underline} estimate **[might be
pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale [are **unlikely to
lead to**]{.mark}]{.underline} outright **[human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but this does suggest that conflicts
which are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten
civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns. [It
is]{.underline} very [difficult to precisely estimate the probability of
**existential risk from nuclear war**]{.underline} over the next
century, and existing attempts leave very large confidence intervals.
According to many experts, [the most likely nuclear war]{.underline} at
present [is between India and Pakistan]{.underline}.14 [However, given
the relatively modest size of their arsenals, the risk of human
[extinction is **plausibly greater** from]{.mark} a [conflict between
the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Tensions between these countries
have increased in recent years and it seems unreasonable to rule out the
possibility of them rising further in the future.

An outright **[military conflict in the Arctic would not be confined to

All the Arctic stakeholders have an obvious interest in avoiding such an
outcome, as the result of either a **[deliberate or]{.underline}** an
**[unintended escalation]{.underline}**. The latter **[is]{.underline}**
the more **[likely]{.underline}** scenario **[and this risk is likely to
increase as the opposing forces continue to operate in close proximity

However, **[neither side has shown willingness to back
down]{.underline}**. For NATO it is a matter of maintaining the
credibility of its commitment to mutual defense; for Russia, its main
adversary has advanced to the gates of the homeland and is intent on
denying the security, geopolitical, and economic claims to which it
feels entitled. **[The rising tensions are not the result of mutual

### Impact -- cyberattacks

#### U.S.-Russia relations key to reduce cyberattacks

institution that focuses on state-sponsored intellectual property theft,

https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/04/01/a-cost-benefit-analysis-of-the-new-us-russian-relationship/;

If quitting China is too expensive for [Russia]{.underline}, it still
[has]{.underline} three, much less expensive [ways it can enhance US
security: discontinuing cyber attacks, ending nuclear targeting of US
cities and military assets, and dropping support for US
adversaries.]{.underline} The first two are especially easy because they
do not involve third parties. Putting [a stop to Russia's persistent and
damaging cyber-attacks on the US]{.underline} private sector
[and]{.underline} critical [infrastructure would produce]{.underline}
immediate [security and economic benefits]{.underline} [for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. This cyber standdown would
also have to include ransomware attacks by so-called private gangs based
in or supported by Russia. To this point, US cyber defense companies
report that Russian hacking continues unabated. [Russia
could]{.underline} also [easily improve US security by ending its
targeting of the United States with nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Maybe
this is the plan, but again, thus far, Russia continues to deploy more
than 1700 nuclear weapons, targeted mostly at Americans. [Russia could
also stop backing US adversaries]{.underline}, including [Iran and North
Korea]{.underline}. Russian [pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear
program and cease its support for terrorism would be of great benefit to
the United States]{.underline} and could be the beginning of a grand
bargain with Iran and a complete remaking of the Middle East. However,
Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out any possibility
of a deal with the United States. Similarly, it seems improbable that
Putin will try to convince Kim Jong-un to abandon North Korea's nuclear
program, given that Putin owes North Korea for its contribution of
troops and supplies for the war in Ukraine. Even if Putin did agree to
press Kim, Putin has nothing to offer North Korea to go along with a
deal except subsidized energy, and Russia can little afford to subsidize
anyone. Prosperity In theory[, the new relationship with Russia could
also benefit the US economically]{.underline}, but the path to this
result is difficult to discern. Russia would not appear to offer much
that the United States needs. US GDP in 2023 was almost \$28 trillion.
Russia's official GDP was \$2 trillion, and that is certainly an
exaggeration, as dictatorships grossly overstate their economic wealth
and income statistics. Moreover, as the Trump Administration seeks to
redress trade imbalances, Russia is not a significant market for US
goods. Trade between the United States and Russia in 2024 was valued at
\$3.5 billion, a relative pittance. For context, in 2024, US trade with
the EU in goods alone (no services, which add another 50 percent) was
almost \$1 trillion, or 285 times the volume of trade with Russia. Of
course, sanctions are part of the reason for this low level of trade
with Russia, but even absent sanctions, Russia is simply too small a
market to make a difference in the US balance of trade.

#### Cyberattacks go nuclear.

Michael T. **Klare 19**. Professor emeritus of peace and world security
studies at Hampshire College and senior visiting fellow at the Arms
Control Association. "Cyber Battles, Nuclear Outcomes? Dangerous New
Pathways to Escalation."
https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2019-11/features/cyber-battles-nuclear-outcomes-dangerous-new-pathways-escalation

Another initiative incorporated in the strategy document also aroused
concern: the claim that [[a]{.mark}n enemy [cyberattack on]{.mark} U.S.
nuclear]{.underline} command, control, and communications
(N[[C3]{.underline}]{.mark}) facilities [[would]{.mark} constitute a
"non-nuclear strategic attack" of sufficient magnitude to **[justify the
use of nuclear weapons]{.mark}** in response.]{.underline}

Under the Obama administration's NPR report, released in April 2010, the
circumstances under which the United States would consider responding to
non-nuclear attacks with nuclear weapons were said to be few. "The
United States will continue to...reduce the role of nuclear weapons in
deterring non-nuclear attacks," the report stated. Although little was
said about what sort of non-nuclear attacks might be deemed severe
enough to justify a nuclear response, cyberstrikes were not identified
as one of these. The 2018 NPR report, however, portrayed a very
different environment, one in which nuclear combat is seen as
increasingly possible and in which non-nuclear strategic threats,
especially in cyberspace, were viewed as sufficiently menacing to
justify a nuclear response. Speaking of Russian technological progress,
for example, the draft version of the Trump administration's NPR report
stated, "To...correct any Russian misperceptions of advantage, the
president will have an expanding range of limited and graduated
\[nuclear\] options to credibly deter Russian nuclear or non-nuclear
strategic attacks, which could now include attacks against U.S. NC3, in
space and cyberspace."1

The notion that a cyberattack on U.S. digital systems, even those used
for nuclear weapons, would constitute sufficient grounds to launch a
nuclear attack was seen by many observers as a dangerous shift in
policy, greatly increasing the risk of accidental or inadvertent nuclear
escalation in a crisis. "The entire broadening of the landscape for
nuclear deterrence is a very fundamental step in the wrong direction,"
said former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz. "I think the idea of
nuclear deterrence of cyberattacks, broadly, certainly does not make any
sense."2

Despite such admonitions, the Pentagon reaffirmed its views on the links
between cyberattacks and nuclear weapons use when it released the final
version of the NPR report in February 2018. The official text now states
that the president must possess a spectrum of nuclear weapons with which
to respond to "attacks against U.S. NC3," and it identifies cyberattacks
as one form of non-nuclear strategic warfare that could trigger a
nuclear response.

That cyberwarfare had risen to this level of threat, the 2018 NPR report
indicated, was a product of the enhanced cybercapabilities of potential
adversaries and of the creeping obsolescence of many existing U.S. NC3
systems. To overcome these vulnerabilities, it called for substantial
investment in an upgraded NC3 infrastructure. Not mentioned, however,
were extensive U.S. efforts to employ cybertools to infiltrate and
potentially incapacitate the NC3 systems of likely adversaries,
including Russia, China, and North Korea.

For the past several years, the U.S. Department of Defense has been
exploring how it could employ its own very robust cyberattack
capabilities to compromise or destroy enemy missiles from such states as
North Korea before they can be fired, a strategy sometimes called "left
of launch."3 Russia and China can assume, on this basis, that their own
launch facilities are being probed for such vulnerabilities, presumably
leading them to adopt escalatory policies such as those espoused in the
2018 NPR report. Wherever one looks, therefore, the links between
cyberwar and nuclear war are growing.

The Nuclear-Cyber Connection

These links exist because [the N[C3]{.mark} systems of the United States
and other nuclear-armed states are **heavily dependent on computers and
other digital processors**]{.underline} for virtually every aspect of
their operation [and]{.underline} because those systems [[are **highly
vulnerable**]{.mark} **to cyberattack**. Every nuclear force is
composed]{.underline}, most basically, [of weapons, early-warning
radars, launch facilities, and the top officials]{.underline}, usually
presidents or prime ministers, empowered to initiate a nuclear exchange.
[Connecting them all, however, is an extended network of communications
and data-processing systems, all reliant on **cyberspace**. Warning
systems, ground- and space-based, must constantly watch for and analyze
possible enemy missile launches. Data on actual threats must rapidly be
communicated to decision-makers]{.underline}, who must then weigh
possible responses and communicate chosen outcomes to launch facilities,
which in turn must provide attack vectors to delivery systems. [All of
this involves operations in **cyberspace**, and it is in **this domain
that [great power rivals seek vulnerabilities]{.mark}** to exploit in a
constant struggle for advantage.]{.underline}

The use of cyberspace to gain an advantage over adversaries takes many
forms and is not always aimed at nuclear systems. China has been accused
of engaging in widespread cyberespionage to steal technical secrets from
U.S. firms for economic and military advantages. [**[Russia]{.mark}**
has been accused]{.underline}, most extensively in the Robert Mueller
report, [of exploiting cyberspace to interfere in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election. Nonstate actors]{.underline}, including terrorist
groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State group, [have used the
internet for recruiting combatants and spreading fear. Criminal
groups]{.underline}, including some thought to be allied with state
actors, such as North Korea, [have used cyberspace to extort money from
banks, municipalities, and individuals]{.underline}.4 Attacks such as
these occupy most of the time and attention of civilian and military
cybersecurity organizations that attempt to thwart such attacks. Yet
[for those who worry about **[strategic stability]{.mark} and the [risks
of nuclear escalation]{.mark}**, it is the threat of **[cyberattacks
on]{.mark} N[C3]{.mark} systems** that [provoke]{.mark}s the
[great]{.mark}est [concern]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This concern stems from the fact that, despite the immense effort
devoted to protecting NC3 systems from cyberattack, no enterprise that
relies so extensively on computers and cyberspace can be made 100
percent invulnerable to attack. This is so because such systems employ
many devices and operating systems of various origins and vintages, most
incorporating numerous software updates and "patches" over time,
offering multiple vectors for attack. Electronic components can also be
modified by hostile actors during production, transit, or insertion; and
the whole system itself is dependent to a considerable degree on the
electrical grid, which itself is vulnerable to cyberattack and is far
less protected. Experienced "cyberwarriors" of every major power have
been working for years to probe for weaknesses in these systems and in
many cases have devised cyberweapons, typically, malicious software
(malware) and computer viruses, to exploit those weaknesses for military
advantage.5

Although activity in cyberspace is much more difficult to detect and
track than conventional military operations, enough information has
become public to indicate that the major nuclear powers, notably China,
Russia, and the United States, along with such secondary powers as Iran
and North Korea, have established extensive cyberwarfare capabilities
and engage in offensive cyberoperations on a regular basis, often aimed
at critical military infrastructure. "Cyberspace is a contested
environment where we are in constant contact with adversaries," General
Paul M. Nakasone, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command (Cybercom), told
the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2019. "We see near-peer
competitors \[China and Russia\] conducting sustained campaigns below
the level of armed conflict to erode American strength and gain
strategic advantage."

Although eager to speak of adversary threats to U.S. interests, Nakasone
was noticeably but not surprisingly reluctant to say much about U.S.
offensive operations in cyberspace. He acknowledged, however, that
Cybercom took such action to disrupt possible Russian interference in
the 2018 midterm elections. "We created a persistent presence in
cyberspace to monitor adversary actions and crafted tools and tactics to
frustrate their efforts," he testified in February. According to press
accounts, this included a cyberattack aimed at paralyzing the Internet
Research Agency, a "troll farm" in St. Petersburg said to have been
deeply involved in generating disruptive propaganda during the 2016
presidential elections.6

Other press investigations have disclosed two other offensive operations
undertaken by the United States. One called "Olympic Games" was intended
to disrupt Iran's drive to increase its uranium-enrichment capacity by
sabotaging the centrifuges used in the process by infecting them with
the so-called Stuxnet virus. Another left of launch effort was intended
to cause malfunctions in North Korean missile tests.7 Although not aimed
at either of the U.S. principal nuclear adversaries, those two attacks
demonstrated a willingness and capacity to conduct cyberattacks on the
nuclear infrastructure of other states.

Efforts by strategic rivals of the United States to infiltrate and
eventually degrade U.S. nuclear infrastructure are far less documented
but thought to be no less prevalent. Russia, for example, is believed to
have planted malware in the U.S. electrical utility grid, possibly with
the intent of cutting off the flow of electricity to critical NC3
facilities in the event of a major crisis.8 Indeed, every major power,
including the United States, is believed to have crafted cyberweapons
aimed at critical NC3 components and to have implanted malware in enemy
systems for potential use in some future confrontation.

Pathways to Escalation

Knowing that the NC3 systems of the major powers are constantly being
probed for weaknesses and probably infested with malware designed to be
activated in a crisis, what does this say about the risks of escalation
from a nonkinetic battle, that is, one fought without traditional
weaponry, to a kinetic one, at first using conventional weapons and
then, potentially, nuclear ones? None of this can be predicted in
advance, but those analysts who have studied the subject worry about the
emergence of dangerous new pathways for escalation. Indeed, several such
scenarios have been identified.9

[The]{.underline} first and possibly [most dangerous path to escalation
would arise from the early use of cyberweapons in a great power
crisis]{.underline} to paralyze the vital command, control, and
communications capabilities of an adversary, many of which serve nuclear
and conventional forces. [[In the "fog of war]{.mark}" that would
naturally ensue from such an encounter, [the
recipient]{.mark}]{.underline} of such an attack [[might]{.mark} fear
more punishing follow-up kinetic attacks, possibly including the use of
nuclear weapons, and, fearing the loss of its own arsenal,
**[launch]{.mark} its [weapons immediately]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
might occur, for example, in a confrontation between NATO and Russian
forces in east and central Europe or between U.S. and Chinese forces in
the Asia-Pacific region.

Speaking of a possible confrontation in Europe, for example, James N.
Miller Jr. and Richard Fontaine wrote that "both sides would have
overwhelming incentives to go early with offensive cyber and
counter-space capabilities to negate the other side's military
capabilities or advantages." If these early attacks succeeded, "it could
result in huge military and coercive advantage for the attacker." This
might induce the recipient of such attacks to back down, affording its
rival a major victory at very low cost. Alternatively, however, the
recipient might view the attacks on its critical command, control, and
communications infrastructure as the prelude to a full-scale attack
aimed at neutralizing its nuclear capabilities and choose to strike
first. "It is worth considering," Miller and Fontaine concluded, "how
even a very limited attack or incident could set both sides on a
slippery slope to rapid escalation."10

[What makes the insertion of latent malware]{.underline} in an
adversary's NC3 systems [so dangerous is that it may not even need to be
activated to increase the risk of nuclear escalation. If a nuclear-armed
state comes to believe that its critical systems are infested with enemy
malware, its leaders might not trust the information]{.underline}
provided by its early-warning systems in a crisis and might misconstrue
the nature of an enemy attack, [leading them to overreact and possibly
**launch their nuclear weapons out of fear**]{.underline} they are at
risk of a preemptive strike.

"The **[[uncertainty]{.mark} caused by]{.underline}** the unique
character of **[a cyber threat [could jeopardize]{.mark} the credibility
of the [nuclear deterrent]{.mark} and undermine strategic
stability]{.underline}** in ways that advances in nuclear and
conventional weapons do not," Page O. Stoutland and Samantha
Pitts-Kiefer wrote in 2018 paper for the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
["\[T\]he introduction of a flaw or malicious code into nuclear weapons
through the supply chain that compromises the effectiveness of those
weapons could lead to a **lack of confidence in the nuclear deterrent,"
undermining strategic stability**]{.underline}.11 [Without
confidence]{.underline} in the reliability of its nuclear weapons
infrastructure, [[a]{.mark} nuclear-armed [state may **misinterpret
confusing signals**]{.mark}]{.underline} from its early-warning systems
[and, fearing the worst, **[launch its]{.mark} own [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than lose them to an enemy's first
strike. [This makes]{.underline} the scenario proffered in the 2018 NPR
report, of [a nuclear response to an enemy cyberattack, that much more
alarming]{.underline}.

### A2 China-Russia alliance is locked in

#### Current China-Russia cooperation in the Arctic is limited to economics-military alliance is only potential

The growing closeness of Russia and China in the Arctic, and China's
growing economic presence in the region more generally, pose new
national security concerns for the United States. [The emerging
**economic opportunity** in the region raises the potential for growing
collaboration between Russia and China.]{.underline} **[China's current
interests in the region are primarily economic]{.underline}**, as the
NSR shortens transit times from China to Europe by 40 percent. [Gaining
greater access to Arctic oil would]{.underline} also [reduce China's
dependency on the Middle East]{.underline}, where its supply lines are
potentially more vulnerable.27 In 2013, China was granted permanent
observer status to the Arctic Council. Beijing's 2018 Arctic White Paper
indicates that it sees itself as a "near-Arctic" state---a position
refuted by the U.S. Coast Guard and the State Department---and plans to
create a Polar Silk Road by constructing infrastructure throughout the
Arctic. [The risk exists that Beijing's economic engagement could form
the groundwork for a permanent military presence,]{.underline}
consistent with its pattern of gradually advancing its overseas power
projection through dual-use facilities (i.e., facilities that can serve
both commercial and military purposes) in the Indian Ocean and Africa.28
Due to poor communications infrastructure and harsh conditions,
[operating in the Arctic is very resource intensive; commercial capital
is hard to come by]{.underline} and therefore heavy economic investment
in the region is often not viable. [Chinese]{.underline} state-directed
[investment has filled this vacuum]{.underline} by funding projects with
security and commercial value. [Russia is already heavily reliant on
Chinese capital]{.underline} to operate its Yamal liquified natural gas
facility, for example. Chinese investment also accounts for over 10
percent of Greenland's economy and 6 percent of Iceland's.29 China's
involvement with exploration and extraction of rare-earth element (REE)
deposits---which are important components in the manufacturing of U.S.
weapon systems, including the nuclear-capable F-35---in the
Kvanefjeld/Kuannersuit area of Greenland is particularly concerning, as
China has demonstrated its willingness to exploit its monopoly of REEs
to punish states it views as threatening Beijing's interests. In 2010,
for example, China restricted Japanese access in the aftermath of a
dispute over the Senkaku Islands.30 Already producing 80 percent of U.S.
and global REE imports, their involvement in this project further
strengthens their global monopoly.31 [As China continues to build its
Arctic presence, it is possible that Chinese financial
leverage]{.underline} over Arctic nations---particularly Russia---[will
provide political advantages for Beijing]{.underline}. In the short
term, [their cooperative pattern could form a foundation for strategic
partnerships]{.underline} in other regions. [There are indicators that
the Sino-Russian relationship is getting stronger]{.underline} in the
region. China's release of an Arctic strategy was not criticized by
Russia, in contrast to Moscow's response to policy documents from
Western countries. In addition, Russia and China carried out a series of
large-scale military exercises together in August and September 2019 in
the Barents and Norwegian Seas. [The risk exists that Beijing's economic
engagement could form the groundwork for a permanent military
presence]{.underline}, consistent with its pattern of gradually
advancing its overseas power projection through dual-use facilities
(i.e., facilities that can serve both commercial and military purposes)
in the Indian Ocean and Africa. [One potential future scenario could be
one in which China leverages Russian dependence on its investment for
energy projects in the region for enhanced economic and military
presence]{.underline}---a debt-trap lending model similar to Beijing's
activity in the Belt and Road Initiative.

### Non-unique -- arctic clash inevitable

#### Arctic competition is inevitable

\[mto\]

The ice retreat in the Arctic region has earned it the title of "El
Dorado of the world because of accessible natural wealth. It is
estimated to contain approximately 90 billion barrels of oil (accounting
for 16 percent of the global reserves), 1,669 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas (roughly 30 percent), and 44 billion barrels of natural gas
liquids (around 38 percent), also positioning it as a critical
repository of yet-to-be-exploited hydrocarbon resources. Nevertheless,
**[the strategic significance of the Arctic]{.underline}** extends
beyond its resource endowments. Its geopolitical importance---**[shaped
by emerging maritime routes, security considerations, and environmental
concerns---has catalyzed intensified international
competition]{.underline}** among both Arctic and near-Arctic states
seeking to assert their influence in the region.

#### Sphere of influence collapse inevitable -- instability will only increase with time as Russia tries to dominate the Arctic

Giuliano **Bifolchi '24**, November 17, "Russian Arctic Development and
National Security Strategy: Analysing Current Trajectory and
Implications," Geopolitical Report ISSN 2785-2598 Volume 48 Issue 6,

\[mto\]

Medium-Term (2025-2035). **[As Russia completes revisions to its Arctic
strategy, anticipated legislative and operational changes could
significantly affect the geopolitical stability of the High
North]{.underline}**. Economic improvements and better living conditions
could incentivise skilled workers to stay in the regions, thus
bolstering the Kremlin's medium-term development prospects. Expansion of
extractive industries and associated logistics will coincide with
elevated environmental risks, leading to potential flashpoints with
international environmental agencies and Arctic Council member states.
The NSR's role in international trade routes will increase in
significance, especially if global warming trends permit greater
navigability. A Russian-controlled NSR could disrupt existing maritime
routes and challenge established norms of free maritime access,
potentially raising tensions with NATO countries and other Arctic
stakeholders. Russia's plans for new industrial hubs, increased resource
extraction, and expanded Arctic port facilities indicate a commitment to
strengthening its presence in the region, possibly altering the security
landscape. The "Arctic 2035" plan's success might hinge on Russia's
capacity to sustain infrastructure and workforce provisions against
economic headwinds. **[Regional instability or escalated military
tensions in the Arctic could emerge as Moscow extends its geopolitical
posture]{.underline}**.

Long-Term Outlook. **[Russia's strategy indicates a future in which it
emerges as a primary Arctic power, controlling key maritime and resource
channels]{.underline}**. **[The risk of conflict in the Arctic is still
high because growing military and economic activities are encroaching on
territory and influence claimed by other nations in the region. The
US]{.underline}**, Norway, and Canada, **[along with other international
actors, will scrutinise Moscow's actions in the Arctic, potentially
prompting countermeasures or strengthening Arctic security
partnerships]{.underline}**. The NSR's **[development may prompt broader
geopolitical realignments]{.underline}** within Arctic frameworks,
influencing Russia's relations with both Western and Asian counterparts.

#### Russia is ramping up military activity in the Arctic now-already views the West as a threat

Illia **Kabachynskyi** March 5 20**25**, journalist, editor, reporter
for the United24 Media channel on YouTube. Main topics---economics,
defense tech IT technologies. Over 10 years in journalism., Arctic War:
How Russia Is Turning a Peaceful Region into a Military Base,

In recent years, [[Russia]{.mark} has [ramped]{.mark} [up]{.mark} its
[military]{.mark} [buildup]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark},
[turning]{.mark} this critical [trade]{.mark} [route]{.mark}
[into]{.mark} a potential [geopolitical]{.mark}
[battleground]{.mark}.]{.underline} When discussing global trade routes,
two major arteries immediately come to mind: the Suez and Panama Canals.
These passages handle massive cargo volumes between Asia, Europe, and
the United States. However, there is a third, less frequently mentioned
route that is no less important: the Arctic trade route. [Navigating the
Arctic is challenging due to its extreme climate]{.underline}---bitter
cold and waters covered with ice nearly year-round. For now. Climate
scientists disagree on exact timelines, but they all predict [that in
the next 50 years, Arctic conditions will change, temperatures will
rise, and permafrost will retreat.]{.underline} This would not only make
the trade route more accessible but also ease access to another valuable
resource---natural deposits. The Arctic is estimated to hold 412 billion
barrels of oil and gas, about 22% of the world's undiscovered reserves.
For decades, [Arctic-bordering nations have viewed the region as a zone
of peace, cooperation, and shared use. Russia once did too. But not
anymore. [Moscow's]{.mark} relentless [fixation]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
external [threats]{.mark}---and the belief that enemies are preparing to
strike---has changed its approach.]{.underline} Russia's Arctic border
stretches an astonishing 14,000 miles (24,000 km). For a long time,
Moscow relied on nature's brutal conditions---perpetual ice and subzero
cold---as its first line of defense. Yet for the Kremlin, natural
defenses are not enough. [The [Arctic]{.mark} [is]{.mark} now
[home]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a [growing]{.mark} [network]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [Russian]{.mark} [military]{.mark}
[installations]{.mark}.]{.underline} As early as 2021, [US media
reported that [Russia]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [reviving]{.mark}
[Soviet]{.mark}-era [bases]{.mark} and [building]{.mark} new ones. The
Russian Ministry of Defense announced 590 [new]{.mark} [military]{.mark}
[sites]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} [airfields]{.mark} for Su-34 and
Su-35 fighter jets. [Moscow]{.mark} [is]{.mark} now reportedly
[positioning]{.mark} [missile]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}, aviation
unit]{.underline}s, air defense installations, and radar systems along
its northern border---[[aiming]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [full]{.mark}
[control]{.mark} [over]{.mark} the [region]{.mark}, which covers a vast
portion of the Northern Hemisphere.]{.underline} In 2024, Vladimir
[[Putin]{.mark} [reaffirmed]{.mark} his [commitment]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[Arctic]{.mark} [dominance]{.mark} [by]{.mark} [ordering]{.mark} the
[largest]{.mark} [military]{.mark} exercise [in]{.mark} the region's
[history]{.mark}]{.underline}---[Ocean-2024]{.underline}. [The drill
involved 400 warships, submarines, and support vessels, as well as 120
planes and helicopters---an unprecedented show of force.]{.underline} As
part of the exercises, strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear
missiles flew over the Barents and Norwegian Seas. [These drills have
triggered significant alarm. Since the Cold War, few considered the
Arctic a potential war zone.]{.underline} But Russia is preparing for a
future where ice recedes, natural defenses disappear, and the region
becomes a battlefield. While much of the world overlooks this threat,
Scandinavian nations feel it acutely. In 2024, discussions about damaged
undersea cables in the Baltic Sea gained traction, following previous
concerns over Russian electronic warfare (GPS jamming) in 2022 and 2023.
However, the [Arctic has faced such provocations for years.]{.underline}
Russian military aircraft have repeatedly violated Scandinavian
airspace, and in 2022, a fiber-optic cable connecting mainland Norway to
the Svalbard archipelago was severed. Suspicion fell on Russia, as a
Russian fishing vessel was in the area at the time of the incident. This
cable supports a satellite station in Svalbard and provides broadband
internet access to the Arctic archipelago. [Arctic nations recognize
that melting ice does not just expose Russia's borders---it affects
theirs. Moscow's military buildup may not be about defense, and its
exercises may not be just drills. Ukraine has already learned that
lesson.]{.underline} But military expansion isn't the only motivation at
play. The presence of ice does not mean the Arctic is unnavigable. Trade
exists, though on a smaller scale than in other parts of the world, and
it requires a special class of escort vessels---icebreakers. Here,
[[Russia]{.mark} [is]{.mark} the [undisputed]{.mark}
leader]{.underline}. According to Russia's Transport Ministry, the
country operates 41 icebreakers, including seven nuclear-powered
ones---the only nation in the world with such a fleet. In contrast, the
US, Canada, and European nations each have only a handful. [This
[dominance]{.mark} has [allowed]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[control]{.mark} the [Northern Sea Route]{.mark}. Since Arctic
navigation largely depends on Russian icebreakers, Moscow profits by
charging commercial fees for their use.]{.underline} At the same time,
[[this]{.mark} [gives]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark} a [crucial]{.mark}
strategic [advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [Kremlin]{.mark}
[retains]{.mark} the [power]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [dictate]{.mark}
[Arctic]{.mark} [trade]{.mark} flows. Icebreakers also operate alongside
Russia's naval forces, ensuring military operations can be sustained in
the region.]{.underline} Unsurprisingly, Russia's partner nations are
now investing in their own icebreaker fleets rather than relying solely
on their so-called "ally." [[Russia's]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}
[ambitions]{.mark} also [serve]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [tool]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [circumventing]{.mark} [Western]{.mark}
[sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}. By controlling this trade corridor,
Moscow can continue exporting resources to Asia, bypassing restrictions.
[[Russia's]{.mark} [claim]{.mark} [to]{.mark} Arctic [dominance]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} further [reflected]{.mark} [in]{.mark} its
[territorial]{.mark} [ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
international agreements designate territorial waters up to 12 miles (22
km) from the coast and exclusive economic zones up to 200 miles (370
km), Russia has spent years trying to expand its claim. Moscow argues
that the Lomonosov and Mendeleev Ridges are extensions of its
continental shelf, thereby asserting rights over an additional 463,000
square miles (1.2 million km²)---including the North Pole. At stake are
22% of the world's untapped oil and gas reserves. [[For]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark}, [gaining]{.mark} [control]{.mark} of these resources
[represents]{.mark} [another]{.mark} [opportunity]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[generate]{.mark} massive [revenue]{.mark}. In]{.underline} the past
three years alone, Russia has earned over \$800 billion from Arctic
resource extraction. The full-scale war against Ukraine has already
demonstrated how the Kremlin exploits energy resources for blackmail and
economic destabilization, particularly in Europe. Moreover, Moscow has
decades of experience extracting oil in Arctic conditions. [If
[Russia]{.mark} succeeds in expanding its territorial claims, it
[will]{.mark} [gain]{.mark} [unchecked]{.mark} [control]{.mark}
[over]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}. It [would]{.mark} [hold]{.mark} the
[power]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [regulate]{.mark} [trade]{.mark} routes,
impose blockades, [and]{.mark} [covertly]{.mark} [deploy]{.mark}
[military]{.mark} [forces]{.mark} for future conflicts.]{.underline} In
2024, Netflix released the second season of The Diplomat. (Spoiler
alert: by the finale, it's clear---the entire plot hinges on the
[Arctic]{.mark} becoming the next global hotspot[.) But for Russia, this
region isn't just about resources. [I]{.mark}t'[s]{.mark} a
[potential]{.mark} [launchpad]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [strikes]{.mark} on
Europe or the United States---a battleground few are watching. Moscow is
already waging war on its western border]{.underline} (Ukraine) and
threatening its Baltic neighbors. It has allies, partners, and satellite
states to the south. [The Arctic may be the next front in Russia's
expansion. [Russia]{.mark} is not investing in ports---it [is building
military bases]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Non-unique -- Trump hurts relations now

#### Russia's Arctic sphere of influence will continue to expand -- the link can't be avoided under Trump 

**Stabroek News '25**, February 19, "Spheres of influence of the Great
Powers: The Western Hemisphere,"
https://www.stabroeknews.com/2025/02/19/features/spheres-of-influence-of-the-great-powers-the-western-hemisphere/
\[mto\]

Bannon explained that **[the Arctic is going to be the "Great Game of
the 21st century]{.underline}**" and highlighted a military weakness
that he called Canada's "soft underbelly": **[Melting polar ice
caps]{.underline}**, he explained, **[were making the Arctic far north
more accessible to countries like Russia and China, which meant that
Canada had to do more to protect its vulnerable northern frontier ---
and, in turn, protect the U.S. And if Canada refuses]{.underline}**,
Bannon said, "**[Trump will force us to]{.underline}**."

Global News commented that **[by annexing Greenland, retaking the Panama
Canal and securing Canada's northern border, Trump was apparently trying
to establish a north-south economic and military corridor -- throughout
the western hemisphere, from the far Arctic north to the southern tip of
South America]{.underline}**.

**[It's all about "hemispheric control]{.underline}**," Bannon
underlined. He added: "Let me be brutally frank. Geo-strategically, you
don't really have an option but to join us if you want your sovereignty
because from the north, from **[the Arctic]{.underline}**, **[it's going
to get encroached in a great power competition]{.underline}** that you
don't have the ability to win." "This is a major geostrategic job ...
Look at your northern border. You're totally, completely exposed ... it
used to be your greatest defence. Now it's your biggest vulnerability".

#### Trump won't cooperate on Arctic issues -- his threats to take over Canada and Greenland weaken Arctic Counsel

**Huebert 25 (**Rob Huebert; a professor in the Department of Political
Science at the University of Calgary, interim director of the Centre for
Military, Security and Strategic Studies. Can the Arctic Council survive
the Trump administration? Probably not. Here's why. Arctic Today.
https://www.arctictoday.com/can-the-arctic-council-survive-the-trump-administration-probably-not-heres-why/)
KW

In addition, he has openly criticized NATO and the ICC, along with many
of the U.S. economic agreements with other nations. In both his first
term and now his second, [Trump has shown a clear lack of support for
international organizations and multilateral agreements]{.underline}.
Specifically, [he seems intent on either ending American participation
or upending the agreements]{.underline} solely [for American
benefit.]{.underline}

[Trump has]{.underline} already [demonstrated that even if he doesn't
withdraw from the Arctic Council, he would actively gut some of the most
important achievements in line with his own goals]{.underline}. First,
[he doesn't "believe" in climate change]{.underline}. During Trump's
first term, the Arctic Council ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi in 2019
failed to produce a final declaration for the first time since the
organization was created. This was because the U.S. delegation -- under
the leadership of Secretary of States Mike Pompeo -- objected to the
term "climate change" or any reference to the Paris Accord. [There is
nothing to suggest that the American position on climate change will be
altered. If anything, it will probably get more strident.]{.underline}

Reshaping Society

Trump has also moved quickly to end American programs that are in any
way associated with the issues surrounding Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion (DEI). [It is highly unlikely that]{.underline} as part of
this process to reshape American society, [his administration would
support any of the]{.underline} important [initiatives
supporting]{.underline} the [northern Indigenous Peoples under the
Arctic Council]{.underline}. His administration has had no qualms about
ending the support that the U.S. had provided to the developing world,
so [he will]{.underline} almost certainly [be unwilling to continue to
provide any support]{.underline} of the Permanent Participants or any
[of the Arctic Council programs]{.underline} that support them.

Third, [Trump has directly attacked two of the core state members of the
Arctic Council]{.underline}. Since his second term began[, he has
repeatedly threatened to "take over" both Greenland and
Canada]{.underline}. While some at first thought he was just joking,
Trump has continued to say that these are his intentions. He has begun
to take active steps, through the threats of a trade war to critically
weaken Canada in order to make it more amendable to "joining" the U.S.
Again, [even if he doesn't move to directly destroy the Arctic Council,
how could Canada and Denmark work with the U.S., knowing
that]{.underline} the [Americans are actively moving to
weaken]{.underline} or even cripple [them as a state?]{.underline}

Fourth, [the one Arctic state that Trump has attempted to improve
relations with -- Russia -- remains]{.underline} also [problematic for
the Arctic Council]{.underline}. [Trump's effort to work with Russia
will make the existing issues]{.underline} that the Arctic Council had
with Russia even [more difficult]{.underline}. [Trump]{.underline} has
already called for the Russians to be readmitted to the G-7. If he
doesn't move to end the Arctic Council, he [will undoubtedly call
for]{.underline} any [sanctions against Russia to be eliminated and for
the country to be fully integrated.]{.underline}

#### Trump won't continue cooperation in the Arctic -- he's already damaging the Arctic council

**Huebert 25 (**Rob Huebert; a professor in the Department of Political
Science at the University of Calgary, interim director of the Centre for
Military, Security and Strategic Studies. Can the Arctic Council survive
the Trump administration? Probably not. Here's why. Arctic Today.
https://www.arctictoday.com/can-the-arctic-council-survive-the-trump-administration-probably-not-heres-why/)
KW

Ultimately, this means that the [Arctic Council now faces two terrible
scenarios]{.underline}. The first is that in his scorched earth policy
toward multilateralism, [Trump will either move to end the Arctic
Council or at least remove the U.S. as a member]{.underline}. [He may
also carry out his threat to ensure that both Canada and Denmark also
cease to be meaningful members of the Arctic Council]{.underline}. If he
truly does intend to take over Canada, it won't even be a state. [Even
if he only means to weaken and reduce Canada to a vassal state, its
ability to participate will be damaged -- if not
eliminated]{.underline}.

Likewise, [if the U.S. takes over Greenland, Denmark's main rational for
being a member of the Arctic Council will be eliminated]{.underline}.
Assuming that somehow the Arctic Council survives an American
withdrawal, and the U.S. follows up its threats to control Greenland and
Canada, [the Council would have only the active membership of Finland,
Sweden, Norway and Iceland]{.underline}.

Even if the U.S. remains in the Arctic Council, its current actions
means the gutting of some of its most important missions, [The U.S.
won't support actions to eliminate the causes of climate
change,]{.underline} and it is very unlikely to support the Permanent
Participants. Outside of the Council, perhaps the Coast Guard forum will
continue. But even here Trump is having an impact. He has already fired
Admiral Linda Pagan, the Commandant of the USCG. American officials have
suggested it was because of her commitment to DEI policies.

Even more dangerously[, this variant of the Arctic Council would include
a U.S. whose policies are now at complete odds with the previous actions
of the Arctic Council]{.underline}. It would also include a Denmark that
has either lost Greenland to the U.S. or will need to take action to
prevent this. It will include a Canada that is being continually
weakened by American action, and is either actively trying to stop an
American takeover or has become a vassal state to the U.S. [It
will]{.underline} also [include a Russia that is being increasingly
supported by the U.S. and has been given the right of conquest over
Ukraine.]{.underline} Furthermore, if Ukraine was conquered for
considering joining NATO, the future of both Finland and Sweden (which
did actually join NATO) will undoubtedly be even more problematic for
Russia.

[These are dire times for the Arctic Council]{.underline}. It is hard to
think of a way to maintain its many successes in supporting an
understanding of the impact of climate change on the Arctic. [It has
also played an important role in supporting a greater awareness of the
northern Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} in the region.
[And]{.underline} perhaps most importantly, it [has served as the
principal means of promoting a peaceful and harmonious international
regime of cooperation]{.underline}.

[All of this is now at risk]{.underline}. Perhaps [Trump won't think
that the Arctic Council is worth]{.underline} his
[attention]{.underline}, and it can somehow remain under the American
radar until the next presidential election. But as many have said in the
past, hope is not a strategy.

**[Even though their tense standoff is likely to continue, some

There is nowhere in the world that is changing faster than in the
Arctic, as climate change has rapidly reduced sea ice cover. Now, a
region that once was covered in ice most of the year is accessible for
human habitation, travel, and exploitation. **[The [US and Russia share
a maritime border]{.mark} along the Bering Strait and [around the Arctic
Ocean. They both share an interest in continued cooperation on

### No internal link -- Trump 

#### Trump-Putin cooperative framework absorbs the link

Douglas **Busvine '25**, February 18, "Russia and US eye joint Arctic
energy projects after Saudi talks," POLITICO,
https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-us-saudi-arctic-energy-rdif-ukraine-russia-capital/
\[mto\]

**[Russia and the United States discussed possible cooperation on energy
projects in the Arctic at a meeting in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**
Tuesday, a top Russian negotiator told POLITICO.

Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the state-owned Russian Direct Investment
Fund (RDIF), said **[the economic conversations had been about broad
strokes, but that the two sides had discussed some "specific areas of
cooperation]{.underline}**."

"**[It was more a general discussion --- maybe joint projects in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. We specifically discussed the Arctic," Dmitriev
said by phone as he boarded a flight home after the talks in Riyadh.

The negotiations, which sidelined Ukraine and Europe, have sparked angst
and urgency in key European capitals as U.S. President Donald Trump and
Russian leader Vladimir Putin look set to decide on Ukraine's future
without substantial input from Kyiv or its Western allies.

For his part, **[Trump aims to expand American influence in the Arctic,
having repeatedly mused about acquiring Greenland from
Denmark]{.underline}** --- and has refused to rule out using military
force or economic coercion to seize control of the massive island with
its vast mineral wealth and key strategic location.

**[U.S. oil major ExxonMobil had partnered with Russian state oil major
Rosneft to explore for hydrocarbons in the high Arctic]{.underline}**,
but pulled out in 2018 following the imposition of Western sanctions in
response to Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

Dmitriev was part of a Russian delegation that included Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov and was in
Saudi Arabia for initial discissions on Ukraine. Tuesday's talks were
the first contact between officials from the two sides following a call
between Trump and Putin last week.

He commented on the economic track of the talks, which he described as
good, but declined to go into detail on the political discussions.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S. delegation, accompanied by
National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Middle East envoy Steve
Witkoff.

"Positive after the Biden administration destroyed all of the
communication, destroyed all of the discussion," he said.

In further remarks, Dmitriev said he had presented an estimate by the
RDIF that U.S. businesses had lost around \$300 billion as a result of
leaving Russia following Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in
February 2022.

"**[There is an understanding that bad relations between Russia and the
U.S. actually cost a lot to American business, and there are ways to
have productive cooperation benefit both Russia and the
U.S]{.underline}**." he said.

"I would not want to have unrealistic expectations for the process going
forward, but I think **[joint investments between Russia and the U.S.
are now more likely after this meeting than before]{.underline}**," he
added.

On next steps, Dmitriev said **[the two sides had agreed to set up
working groups and have regular high-level contacts]{.underline}**. No
further meetings have yet been scheduled.

The RDIF was set up in 2011 to partner with foreign investors on
projects in Russia, and later backed a Covid-19 vaccine. The sovereign
fund was sidelined following Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, as
foreign investors pulled out or scaled back their exposure to Russia.
Shortly before Putin ordered in Russian troops, the RDIF issued a
statement calling for a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

**[The United States and Russia reportedly could work together to
explore the Arctic\'s natural resources and trade routes]{.underline}**.

Citing unnamed U.S. officials, Bloomberg reported that Moscow and
Washington were discussing **[economic cooperation in the far
north]{.underline}**, which could \"drive a wedge\" between Russia and
key trading ally China. It **[could]{.underline}** also **[be part of a
detente between the U.S. and Russia sought by U.S. President Donald
Trump]{.underline}**.

Newsweek reached out to the U.S. State Department and the Russian
Foreign Ministry for comment.

Why It Matters

The Pentagon\'s new Arctic Strategy, released last year, highlighted the
risk of China and Russia teaming up in the Arctic. The Biden-era policy
sought to expand its military readiness and surveillance in the region.

A report by the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) released in
December concluded that geopolitics and strategic competition are
quickly changing the Arctic security landscape and that Russia
represents a threat to NATO and regional stability. The alliance has
accused Moscow of hybrid warfare operations in the Baltic Sea, so **[the
prospect of the U.S. and Russia cooperating over the strategically
sensitive region would be significant]{.underline}**.

What To Know

There have been tensions over NATO accusing Russia of sabotaging vessels
in the Baltic Sea and claims of hybrid warfare around what is dubbed the
NATO Lake as the alliance\'s members move to combat Moscow\'s
belligerence in the region.

Bloomberg reported that **[U.S. and Russian officials have discussed
economic cooperation in the Arctic as part of a detente that Trump is
seeking with Moscow as the U.S. pursues an end to the war with
Ukraine]{.underline}**.

**[The talks are at an early stage]{.underline}**, according to an
unnamed source who said **[natural resources, energy exploration and
trade routes are being discussed]{.underline}**.

Politico reported this month that cooperation in the Arctic had been
discussed in talks between Russia and the U.S. in Saudi Arabia, citing
Kirill Dmitriev, head of the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund.

Bloomberg said the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[is open to
business ventures and cooperation with Moscow]{.underline}**, causing
concern among Ukraine\'s European and NATO allies who have accused
Russia of GPS jamming in the Baltic Sea and sabotaging underwater
cables.

The United Kingdom and Norway started talks last week on a defense deal
aimed at countering the threat from Russia in the Arctic that will see
the countries\' armed forces working more closely, including protecting
undersea cables from sabotage.

In October 2024, NATO Military Committee Chair Admiral Rob Bauer
expressed concerns about Russia\'s continued military build-up in the
Arctic and the military cooperation between China and Russia, saying the
alliance would \"defend its interests\" in the region.

**[It is unclear what any proposed deal between the Trump administration
and Russia would mean for Arctic security]{.underline}**.

Jeremy Holt, associate director at S-RM, a geopolitical and cyber risk
consultancy, told Newsweek on Thursday that an Arctic deal between
Russia and the U.S. would be unlikely to reduce security tensions in the
Baltic Sea unless Moscow addressed its hybrid activities in the region.
It is unclear whether this would be viewed as a U.S. priority.

He said that a more transactional and bilateral U.S. foreign policy may
make the security of Baltic subsea infrastructure less of a priority,
allowing Russia and other actors more room to pursue so-called hybrid
activities in the region.

### Alt cause -- Ukraine

#### US-Russia relations in the Arctic are not compartmentalized- Ukraine invasion has tanked collaboration

Rasmus Gjedssø **Bertelsen '24.** Professor at UiT The Arctic University
of Norway; Divided Arctic in a Divided World Order; Strategic Analysis
Volume 48, 2024 - Issue 6: Changing Dynamics in the Arctic: Actors and
Alliances, https://doi.org/10.1080/09700161.2025.2453322 \[mto\]

[The Russian]{.underline} full-scale [invasion of Ukraine led to an
almost complete Western cessation of Arctic collaboration with
Russia]{.underline}. [The other seven Arctic countries refused to
collaborate]{.underline} [with Russia]{.underline} in the Arctic
Council, chaired by Russia 2021--2023. The Seven---now all NATO member
states---Arctic Council member states have since backed down
significantly. The Arctic Council was always more important to them than
to Russia, suggesting that this Western brinkmanship was poorly thought
through. [There are extensive Western sanctions against the Russian
economy]{.underline}, [including against Russian Arctic energy
projects]{.underline}, which were a key basis for developing the Russian
Arctic. Russia had sought to develop a Europe-Russia-East Asia energy
system with Russian Arctic oil and gas being exported both West to
Europe and East to East Asia and with balanced Western and East Asian
investments.Footnote18 [The West has almost completely cut science and
technology relations with Russia, also in the Arctic.]{.underline}

### Alt cause -- China

#### Forthcoming Chinese expansion through the Arctic will trigger Russian aggression

Farrell **Gregory '25**, April 23, "The Sino-Russian Alignment Stops at
Arctic Trade," THE DIPLOMAT,
https://thediplomat.com/2025/04/the-sino-russian-alignment-stops-at-arctic-trade/
\[mto\]

Days before the United States introduced its global system of tariffs,
Chinese and Russian officials held a three-day summit in Moscow. Citing
a "friends forever, enemies never" principle as the foundation for
**[Sino-Russian]{.underline}** relations, the visit appeared aimed at
demonstrating alignment against the U.S. But despite claims to the
contrary, that **[partnership has limits, especially when it comes to
Arctic trade]{.underline}**.

The Trump administration is currently engaged in an effort to reorient
post-Cold War trade dynamics. But it's not the only global power that
wants to do so. The People's Republic of China (**[PRC) has long sought
to reduce its reliance on shipping through the Malacca
Strait]{.underline}**, which facilitates 60 percent of China's imports.
During the trade war in Trump's first term, China increased its exports
to a range of markets, including Mexico, Vietnam, and the European
Union. In part, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) aimed to develop an
on-land trade route through Central Asia and into Europe.

**[The Chinese desire for alternate trade routes stretches farther
north]{.underline}**. The Northern Sea Route (NSR), which passes
**[through the Bering Strait and Arctic Ocean]{.underline}**, was listed
as a region for BRI development in 2018. It's easy to see why. Shipping
through the NSR, which is not currently navigable year round because of
ice blockage, cuts the distance between Europe and China by 40 percent.
**[Trade usage is expected to skyrocket in the coming
years]{.underline}**, with one Russian projection estimating a sevenfold
increase over 2022 volume by 2030.

**[The NSR is an increasingly valuable trade route, especially for
China. For Russia, the traditional hegemon of the Arctic, that's a
problem]{.underline}**.

**[China initially engaged in scientific Arctic work]{.underline}**,
including purchasing an exploration vessel in 1994 and building a
research station in Norway in 2003. **[That ambition quickly grew beyond
science. In 2013, China gained observer status at the multilateral
Arctic Council, despite Russian reluctance]{.underline}**.

After the 2014 seizure of Crimea, Russia quickly overcame its
reservations about China in the face of Western sanctions and hostility.
As Yun Sun of the Stimson Center has argued, "the pre-2014 cold-shoulder
by Russia forms a sharp contrast to its enthusiasm to cooperate with
China on the Northern Sea Route." In 2018, President Vladimir Putin even
invited Chinese investment and collaboration in the Arctic. But that
investment isn't free. **[China will seek greater Arctic influence,
while Russia will seek to retain its control in the region. As the NSR
grows in value, that's a potential breaking point]{.underline}**.

**[Both Russia and China want to reorder global power dynamics and trade
in their favor. As aligned as they are, and despite their claims of a
"no-limits" partnership, China and Russia are rushing towards a
collision in the Arctic. Russia cannot retain its hegemony in the NSR
while China builds up its presence there]{.underline}**.

**[For China, an increased presence in the Arctic would include both
commercial and military dimensions]{.underline}**. Aside from the
reduced distance of the NSR when compared to the Suez, the Arctic route
is also less vulnerable to disruption. The Houthi threat in the Red Sea
has affected about 60 percent of Chinese trade with Europe. Trade along
the NSR isn't free from potential interference, especially since it
passes by Alaska. But Arctic trade offers an alternative to the Malacca
Strait. **[As China increasingly diversifies its trade routes, it will
likely project naval power capable of protecting these
shipments]{.underline}**.

**[That's a problem for Russia. The Arctic is seen as a vital part of
its sphere of influence. The region is the source of 80 percent of
Russia's gas and 30 percent of its GDP. Nearly the entirety of the NSR
falls inside Russia's Exclusive Economic Zone. This allows Russia to
regulate transit, require shipments to be accompanied by Russian
icebreakers, and charge usage fees. It's unlikely that China, as it
securitizes and diversifies its trade routes, would abide such tight
Russian control]{.underline}**. Furthermore, Russia has become
increasingly reliant on the PRC for investment, oil purchases, and
advanced technology. China wields a number of potential levers that it
could use to coerce more accommodating practice. **[If Russia allows an
increased Chinese presence in the Arctic, cracking that door open could
just be a prelude towards opening it all the way]{.underline}**.

The **[Sino-Russian]{.underline}** partnership is founded on the shared
view that the current global order is insufficiently balanced to their
interests. But upon a closer examination of those
**[interests]{.underline}**, it's clear that they **[diverge in the
Arctic. As the Northern Sea Route grows in importance, expect to see
those tensions grow]{.underline}**.

### Impact non-unique -- Russian heg unstable

#### Russian dominance in the Arctic is unstable -- no durable peace in the status quo

Bohdan **Ustymenko '25**, April 9, director of Ukraine's National
Security Institute, "Putin's Arctic ambitions: Russia eyes natural
resources and shipping routes," UKRAINE ALERT,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-arctic-ambitions-russia-eyes-natural-resources-and-shipping-routes/
\[mto\]

**[With Russia militarizing along the Northern Sea Route and laying
claim to large parts of the Arctic maritime zone, the scope for
potential future conflict is huge. Geopolitical tensions are likely to
be further heightened]{.underline}** by the deepening regional
involvement of China in partnership with Russia. The two nations have
identified the Arctic as a key area of cooperation, both as a trade
route linking China to Europe and as a source of the natural resources
that Beijing needs to fuel its economy.

In the years ahead, the ports of the Northern Sea Route could become
increasingly important for the projection of Chinese and **[Russian
naval power]{.underline}** on the international stage, both **[in the
Arctic region]{.underline}** and beyond. This could allow both countries
to enforce their claims to Arctic resources and overwhelm other regional
nations with less powerful navies such as Canada, Denmark, and Norway.
This **[is leading to security concerns over a number of isolated and
vulnerable islands]{.underline}** throughout the region.

**[Allowing Russia to gain the ascendancy in the Arctic would lead to
unpredictable geopolitical consequences. Control over the oil and gas
resources of the Arctic region could dramatically increase Russian state
revenues. Past experience indicates that this windfall would likely be
used by the Kremlin to finance military spending, potentially setting
the stage for fresh acts of aggression. Limiting Russian access to the
Arctic should therefore be viewed as matter of international
security]{.underline}**.

**[As the struggle for dominance in the Arctic heats up, it is already
clear that NATO member states need to dramatically strengthen their
presence and capabilities in the region]{.underline}**. It would also
make sense to call upon international bodies such as the International
Court of Justice to request clarification regarding the regime that
Russia has arbitrarily established in the waters of the Northern Sea
Route.

### No war impact

#### Russia is only posturing -- won't actually go to war with the west

Sydney **Murkins '24**, December 3, "The Future Battlefield is Melting:
An Argument for Why the U.S. Must Adopt a More Proactive Arctic
Strategy," THE ARCTIC INSTITUTE,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/future-battlefield-melting-argument-us-must-adopt-more-proactive-arctic-strategy/
\[mto\]

Threatened by the growing alliance, in June 2022, Putin warned that if
U.S.-NATO military contingents or military infrastructure appears in
either Sweden or Finland, Russia will respond "symmetrically" by
deploying nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea region to restore military
balance and strengthen its defenses.19) In February 2023, Putin made
good on this threat and deployed Russian ships armed with tactical
nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea. According to Norway, this was the
first time in 30 years that this has happened.20) Then in June 2024,
Moscow began to train soldiers and sailors to deploy tactical nuclear
weapons in Leningrad, a military district bordering NATO members Norway,
Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.21) As evidenced by
these actions, **[while Putin is not afraid to rattle the nuclear saber,
it is not likely that Russia has the military or economic capacity to
engage in a direct conventional conflict with NATO]{.underline}**.

NATO leaders recognize that there is a finite window of time to prepare
for conflict against Russia. In 2024 the head of the Norwegian armed
forces warned that NATO countries only have two to three years to
prepare for a Russian attack. Norwegian General Eirik Kristoffersen
claims that Moscow is building up its military stockpile faster than
previously predicted, while Western nations have depleted their own
weapons by supplying them to Ukraine.22) Several other European leaders
have echoed these concerns, citing that they have between three and
eight years to prepare for a Russian attack against NATO.23) **[Despite
Russia's aggressive rhetoric, Moscow understands that because of its war
against Ukraine it likely will not have the capability to attack NATO in
the near future]{.underline}**. For instance, Russia removed nearly all
its ground forces from the Finnish border to Ukraine in June 2024.24)
Russia's timeframe to launch a successful attack is dependent not only
on its economy but also on its partnership with the PRC.

#### Russia is too weak for war

Eugene **Rumer et al '21**, March 29, Eugene Rumer, Director and Senior
Fellow, Russia and Eurasia Program; Richard Sokolsky, Nonresident Senior
Fellow, Russia and Eurasia Program; Paul Stronski Former Senior Fellow,

Examination," CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INT'L PEACE,

\[mto\]

**[It can be difficult to see past Russia's rhetoric, deliberately
provocative acts, and grandiose statements about its Arctic plans and
threats to them, and to acknowledge that its bark so far has been worse
than its bite. Russia's ambitions far exceed the resources it has to
realize them]{.underline}**. Thus, while it is essential not to yield to
**[Russia's posturing]{.underline}**, **[it is]{.underline}** equally
**[important not to overreact]{.underline}** to it.

Notwithstanding the seeming novelty of the situation---changing climate,
NATO's new frontier in Eastern Europe, China's growing footprint in the
Arctic, and so on---Russia's drive to the Far North and the rationale
behind it are part of a long-standing historical pattern. Its
confrontation with the West is not a new development either, and the
push for Arctic resources is crucial for its ability to sustain this
posture. From the perspective of the country's security establishment,
**[Russia is playing defense rather than offense]{.underline}**.

Moreover, **[Russia is confronting the West in vastly diminished
circumstances. Its economy is stagnant, its population is declining, and
it is diplomatically isolated in Europe and among the Arctic
states---almost entirely thanks to its own actions. It has rebuilt its
military capabilities after a long period of neglect and decline, but
even this utmost national priority is facing budget constraints and
technological challenges. In the years to come Russia's Arctic pursuits
and posture will likely be]{.underline}** driven by concerns about being
able to sustain its already **[weakened]{.underline}** position
vis-à-vis the West.

### No relations impact

#### Relations are durable due to mutual desire for normalization and economic incentives

\[mto\]

KENDALL-TAYLOR: I would---just on the surprising things. I'm surprised.
So we all understood that Trump wanted to end the war. And in the
earliest days of the administration there were some sounds that seem to
be going in a somewhat positive direction, where Trump was talking about
putting sanctions on Russia, saying we can do this the easy way or the
hard way. So there---you know, to be very candid, there was a moment in
time where I was slightly optimistic that **[Trump]{.underline}** would
look for opportunities to increase U.S. leverage in a negotiation
**[with Putin]{.underline}**. We totally veered from that trajectory at
a very fast pace. And then, you know, enter the list of concessions that
I rattled off a minute ago where we totally, I think, lowered our
leverage in the negotiation. That was---that was very surprising to me.

And so when it comes to the bilateral discussions, I don't think that
there's anything that they can mutually work out that is to Ukraine's
benefit, but **[it's very clear what the two leaders want to work
out]{.underline}**. I mean, I think **[Trump definitely wants a
normalization of relations with Russia]{.underline}**. I think **[he's
interested in economic opportunities]{.underline}**, which is why, you
know, at the meeting in Saudi Arabia the Russian delegation included the
head of the Direct Investment Fund. It's why you hear
Trump---sorry---President Putin talking now about aluminum deals. Now
they see that they're interested in these minerals. **[And so now Putin
is offering up Russian minerals]{.underline}**. So there's **[lots of
things]{.underline}** that **[can happen through the bilateral
channel]{.underline}**, but none that I would say add to Ukraine's
security or advance U.S. national security interests.

BREMMER: I'm going to---Celeste as a follow up, but I want a quick
question on response to what you just said. So when J.D. Vance---you
know, who's a bright guy, right? I mean, this is not Hegseth we're
talking about---(laughter)---is putting out, you know, a, look, what we
are, quote/unquote, "offering"---everyone knows there's no path for
Ukraine in NATO. That's been clear for a couple of years now. Everybody
knows that---I mean some of this---that there's going to have to be a
partition, this isn't a give. How do you respond to that?

KENDALL-TAYLOR: I disagree. I actually think that there was a path in
which President Trump could have come into office and done things to
enhance our leverage in a future negotiation. So it would have been, in
my view, very meaningful and a powerful signal of U.S. commitment if
Trump could have gone to Congress and got a new supplemental, using the
minerals that Zelensky put on the table as a way to say, look, America,
we're not doing this out of the goodness of our hearts. There's
something in this for all of us.

And then I think eventually---and it maybe wouldn't have been
immediately---but you could get to a place where Putin would then
recognize he could not sustain this war forever, given some of the
economic challenges that Celeste mentioned, which maybe wouldn't bite
this year but maybe next year. To me, there was a path where you at
least get a more genuine negotiation that puts Ukraine in a---where you
could actually get to a durable and lasting peace. And right now, I
don't see---given this administration's approach, I don't see a path to
anything that will be durable or lasting.

BREMMER: OK. Steve is nodding affably but Emma's wildly skeptical, so
I'm going to get to her. But first, Celeste, you had a point.

WALLANDER: So I just think---I want to highlight something that maybe
isn't articulated and isn't talked about generally, that I think is
really important that came out of this conversation among the four of
us. Which is that it is, I think it's fair to say---I'm going to assert
it---it is extremely unlikely that you will get a peace agreement,
certainly anytime soon, that the United States and Russia may agree to
and that is implementable, that Ukraine and Europe will agree to
implement. We could talk about peacekeeping forces and all that stuff
later, if you want.

Given that, though---given that President **[Trump clearly wants to have
a strong relationship with Vladimir Putin and Putin clearly wants to
escape the constraints which, while they are not forcing him to the
table, certainly are unhelpful, unpleasant]{.underline}**, if there is
not a peace agreement, is there going to be **[a bilateral
reconciliation and big deal between the United States and Russia,
regardless of continuing fighting over]{.underline}** the heads of, you
know, sort of **[Ukraine and Europe]{.underline}**? And I think that
that **[is the key]{.underline}**---that is the key question for
thinking about the future.

### No cyber impact

#### Cyberattacks don't escalate AND no intent. Empirics and wargames prove they're de-escalatory.

Escalation is defined as an increase in the nature or intensity of
conflict. [Extending escalation theory to]{.underline} **[cyber
space]{.underline}** would [include situations in which "the target
responds with]{.underline} **[more intense]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[costly]{.underline}** [cyber means]{.underline}
(cyber escalation within the domain) [or]{.underline} through
**[breaching]{.underline}** [the cyber-kinetic threshold]{.underline}
(crossdomain escalation)" (Borghard and Lonergan 2019: 123). Libicki
(2016) simplifies cyber escalation into two factors: intensity (striking
deeper, lasting longer) or more extensive (striking new targets), plus
adds the consideration that an attack in cyber space can escalate to an
attack on physical space.

Cyber escalation is then defined as a reaction with digital tools that
increases intensity or aggression or that spreads the scope of conflict
after an initial move in the digital domain. Theoretically the cyber
domain can contain escalation because of the uncertainty introduced by
cyber weapons (Buchanan 2016). There is also the aspect of civilian
punishment, attacks that hit what might be deemed off-limits civilian
systems, provoking escalation due to the violation in norms between two
actors.

[[In]{.underline} **[practice]{.underline}**]{.mark}, however, [[cyber
escalation is]{.underline} **[rare]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[Stuxnet]{.underline} (2007--2010) [is]{.underline} **[often
cited]{.underline}** [as the prime example]{.underline} of cyber
escalation [yet]{.underline}, put in the context of the wider dispute
between the West and Iran over the development of nuclear weapons, [the
[Stuxnet]{.mark} attack [is]{.mark} actually a]{.underline}
**[[de-escalatory]{.mark} move]{.underline}** [[because]{.mark} the
[other options]{.mark} on the table at the time
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} **[conventional]{.underline}**
[[strikes]{.mark} that [would have caused]{.mark}]{.underline} death and
[[destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Talmadge (2019a: 864) makes the point that [technology itself
is]{.underline} **[rarely a sufficient condition]{.underline}** [for
escalation, "cast\[ing\] doubt on the idea of]{.underline} **[emerging
technologies]{.underline}** [as an]{.underline}
**[independent]{.underline}**, primary **[driver]{.underline}** [of
otherwise avoidable escalation]{.underline}." [Technology became
the]{.underline} **[mask]{.underline}** for the processes that enable
escalation, [rather than the]{.underline} **[cause]{.underline}** [of
escalation itself]{.underline}. It is not the domain that produces
escalation, but the action in the domain that produces outcomes.

We [[have]{.underline} **[ample empirical
ev]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[idence]{.underline}** that **[[escalation is
limited in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain]{.underline}**. Even in its
simpler form, [there is]{.underline} **[little
retaliation]{.underline}**, [let alone escalation, in the domain or even
out of the domain when cyber actions are]{.underline} the
**[triggering]{.underline}** [events]{.underline}. When conflicts do
escalate in cyber space, we [observe]{.underline} **[limited
engagement]{.underline}** [between the parties unless there
is]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}** [an outright war]{.underline}.
As Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018: 18) note, "[even when cyber
[exchanges]{.mark}]{.underline} **[between rivals]{.underline}**
[escalate, they [remain]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[limited in
scope]{.underline}**]{.mark} [outside of ongoing military
conflict]{.underline}. That is, rivals may use cyber operations to probe
the enemy, test their resolve, and signal the risks of significant
escalation.

**[[Data analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}** [supports these positions and
is developed]{.underline} here [from established data and taken from
ongoing projects]{.underline} to support our background investigation
into cyber escalation processes (Maness, Valeriano, and Jensen 2019).
Table 12.4 [[shows]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[response
patterns]{.underline}** [between]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates and
its four major adversaries ([**[Russia]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[China]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea) [in
the cyber domain, as well as how each country responds to a cyber
operation with a]{.underline} **[retaliatory]{.underline}** [cyber
operation]{.underline}. Table 12.4 utilizes the cyber operation severity
score from the DCID version 1.5 that measures the impact and national
security importance of each state-initiated cyber operation between the
years 2000--2016 between rival states (Maness, Valeriano, and Jensen
2019). The scale is interval and ranges from 1 to 10.

Table 12.4 shows that the United States is often on the receiving end of
retaliation at a higher rate than expected. However, these responses to
US cyber actions do not indicate within-domain escalation. The severity
levels with a response score of 2 were retaliatory to US actions that
were of a higher severity level. Of the seven actions at the severity
level of 4, three represent a decrease in the initial attack severity
and four represent an increase by one tick in severity. The only other
country that witnesses a statistically significant level of retaliation
at a greater rate than expected is Iran, which is wholly due to US or
Israeli operations. China's significant negative relationship with its
severity score of 2 shows that it prefers higher levels of severity when
it retaliates in the cyber domain. Many of the Chinese incidents involve
entanglements with the United States, which is another great power with
vast cyber capabilities. This [propensity to use]{.underline} **[more
severe]{.underline}** [attacks [does]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[not]{.underline}** [denote escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, however.
[Escalation is]{.underline} **[rare in digital
interactions]{.underline}** [as measured by]{.underline}
**[rival]{.underline}** [states]{.underline} from 2000 to 2016.

\[Figure omitted\]

Table 12.5 shows how responses are related to the overall cyber strategy
of the initiating states. In terms of response severity by strategic
objective, [disruptive [efforts]{.mark} by initiating states are
[usually met with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[retal]{.mark}iatory
[disruptions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [further indicating]{.underline}
that [the cyber domain is]{.underline}, for the most part,
**[non-escalatory]{.underline}**. Espionage campaigns are also commonly
met with cyber operations that either steal or signal capabilities or
displeasure for the originating action, but [do [not]{.mark} lead to
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[tit-for-tat]{.underline}** [escalatory
ladder]{.underline}]{.mark}, as indicated in Table 12.2. Only
occasionally do we see disruptions or espionage operations escalate to
the severity level of 5, with this happening only five times over the
2000--2016 period.

[Results from]{.underline} **[[war ga]{.mark}mes]{.underline}** have
[[demonstrated]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[complicated]{.underline}**
empirical [picture of the escalation landscape in cyber
space]{.underline} (Schneider 2017). After examining war games from 2011
to 2016, Schneider [finds that government officials were]{.underline}
**[hesitant]{.underline}** [to use damaging cyber weapons]{.underline}.
Most games only witness the use of cyber capabilities after the onset of
conventional warfare, not before. For Jensen and Banks (2018), in the
context of cyber options, [[escalation]{.mark} was
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[exception]{.mark}, not the
norm]{.underline}**.

To explore escalation when cyber options are present within the context
of integrated options of national power, Jensen and Valeriano (2019) ran
a series of war games on 259 participants, including members of the
military, students, and policymakers. The [simulation situated
participants in a]{.underline} typical [crisis that was]{.underline}
**[highly likely]{.underline}** [to escalate given a]{.underline}
**[rivalry]{.underline}** [situation over an]{.underline} **[ongoing
territorial dispute]{.underline}** [when the crisis under
examination]{.underline} was the third in a series over a five-year
period.

The [results]{.underline} **[demonstrated]{.underline}** that
[escalation is not the norm]{.underline}. Based on a general baseline
for all international conflict situations, most options fell below the
48 percent threshold. In fact, the only instance where escalation was
the dominant option was when a cyber action started the crisis and the
target had no cyber response options. This suggests there are
implications of attacking a state with cyber options when they do not
have the ability to respond within the domain. [In]{.underline}
**[most]{.underline}** other [situations]{.underline}, we
[witness]{.underline} **[few demands for escalation]{.underline}** [when
cyber response options are on the table]{.underline}.

[Overall]{.underline}, **[[regardless]{.mark} of [the
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [cyber [escalation
is]{.mark}]{.underline} usually [**[not]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [dominant [response]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[reality is that even under dangerous conditions cyber response
options]{.underline} can **[actually moderate]{.underline}** [crisis
response patterns]{.underline}. [Surveys demonstrate]{.underline} a
great amount of **[[fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the cyber domain,
but this]{.underline} **[[does not motivate
overreaction]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Gross, Canetti, and Vashdi 2017).
Figure 12.2 shows the results from a cyber campaign--directed dyads data
set. What is measured in what follows is whether the combined cyber
operation, which includes diplomatic, economic, and military variables
extracted from ICEWS (Boschee et al. 2018), has escalatory responses
from the target from all four domains recorded in the campaigns. For a
cyber response to be recorded, the target responds within one year from
the start date of the original cyber operation from the initiator for
disruptions and degradations, and from the date the operation becomes
public for espionage operations. For a diplomatic response, the time
frame is one month (thirty days) after the cyber operation's initiation
or public reporting, and for economic and military responses, the time
frame is three months (ninety days) after the same criteria regarding
the cyber operation. For cyber escalation, the severity score must go up
at least one point regarding the cyber response. No cyber responses at
the same severity score are included. For conventional responses, we use
the Conflict and Mediation Event Observation (CAMEO)
conflict-cooperation scores to measure escalation (Schrodt 2012). The
CAMEO scale ranges from −10 to 10 where the more negative score, the
more conflictual and the more positive score, the more cooperative the
foreign policy action. If the conflict scores from each domain are lower
(more negative) from the target state in retaliation for the cyber
incident, escalation in each domain is recorded.

During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in March, Senator Angus
King, an independent from Maine, pressed General Paul Nakasone, the head
of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency,
about the [**lack** of]{.underline} **[significant]{.underline}**
[cyber-operations]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [Russia's
war]{.underline} in Ukraine. After all, Russia has long been known for
targeting Western countries, as well as Ukraine itself, with
cyberattacks. Echoing the surprise of many Western observers, King said,
"[I expected]{.underline} [to see]{.underline} [the grid]{.underline}
[go down]{.underline}, [communications]{.underline} [too]{.underline},
and [that]{.underline} **[hasn't]{.underline}** [happened]{.underline}."
Indeed, although President Joe Biden and members of his administration
have also warned of potential Russian cyberattacks against the United
States, there were remarkably few signs of such activity during the
first six weeks of the war.

That is not to say that cyber-activity has been entirely absent. Proxy
cyber-groups and hackers have mobilized on both sides, ranging from
Ukraine's 400,000-strong "IT Army" to Russia's Conti ransomware group.
Sandworm, an outfit linked to Russian military intelligence, also has a
long record of cyberattacks against Ukraine.

Yet since the war began, such [[operations]{.underline}
[have]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly [[been]{.mark}
**limited**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[[low-cost]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [disruptive]{.underline}
[**[incidents]{.underline}**]{.mark} [rather than]{.underline}
**[large-scale]{.underline}** [attacks]{.underline}
[against]{.underline} [critical]{.underline} civilian and military
[infrastructure]{.underline}. Two [potential]{.underline}
[exceptions]{.underline} only underscore the relatively limited role of
cyber-operations. There is some evidence that at the start of the war
Russian-linked actors conducted a cyberattack against Viasat, a
U.S.-based Internet company that provides satellite Internet to the
Ukrainian military and to customers in Europe. But the
[impact]{.underline} [was]{.underline} **[temporary]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}, more important, [did **not**]{.underline}
**[meaningfully]{.underline}** [affect]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
Ukrainian [military's]{.underline} [ability to]{.underline}
[communicate]{.underline}. Additionally, Ukrainian officials recently
announced that, in early April, [the Sandworm]{.underline}
[group]{.underline} attempted, but **[failed]{.underline}**, to carry
out a cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid. While the hackers
appeared to have gained access to a company that delivers power to two
million Ukrainians, they were **[thwarted]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} **[effective]{.underline}** [defenses]{.underline}
[before]{.underline} [being able]{.underline} [to cause]{.underline} any
[damage]{.underline} or disruption.

In fact, [the **negligible**]{.underline} [role]{.underline} [of
cyberattacks]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline}
conflict [should come]{.underline} [as]{.underline} **[no
surprise]{.underline}**. [Through]{.underline} [[war
**sim**]{.mark}ulation**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**stat**i**s**tical]{.underline} [analyses]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [other]{.underline} [kinds of]{.underline}
[[studies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [scholars]{.underline} have
[[found]{.underline} **[little ev]{.underline}**]{.mark}[idence
that]{.underline} [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}-operations
[provide]{.underline} **[effective]{.underline}** forms of
[coercion]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [that they]{.underline} [[cause
**escalation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to **actual**]{.underline}
[military conflict]{.underline}. That is because [for all]{.underline}
[its potential]{.underline} [to disrupt]{.underline} companies,
hospitals, and utility grids during peacetime, [cyberpower]{.underline}
[is **much harder**]{.underline} [to use]{.underline} [against
targets]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[strategic
significance]{.underline}** [or to]{.underline} [achieve
outcomes]{.underline} [with]{.underline} **[decisive
impacts]{.underline}**, either on the battlefield or
[during]{.underline} crises short of [war]{.underline}. In failing to
recognize this, U.S. officials and policymakers are approaching the use
of cyberpower in a way that may be doing more harm than good---treating
cyber-operations like any other weapon of war rather than as a nonlethal
instrument of statecraft and, in the process, overlooking the
considerable opportunities as well as risks they present.

THE MYTH OF CYBER-ESCALATION

Much of [the **current**]{.underline} [understanding]{.underline} in
Washington [about the]{.underline} [role of]{.underline}
[cyber]{.underline}-operations [in conflict]{.underline} [is
built]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [long-standing]{.underline}
[but]{.underline} **[false assumptions]{.underline}** about cyberspace.
Many [scholars]{.underline} [have asserted]{.underline} [that
cyber]{.underline}-operations [could easily]{.underline} [lead
to]{.underline} [military escalation]{.underline}, [up to]{.underline}
and including [the use of]{.underline} [nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
Jason Healey and Robert Jervis, for example, expressing a widely held
view, have argued that an incident that takes place in cyberspace,
"might cross the threshold into armed conflict either through a sense of
impunity or through miscalculation or mistake."
[Policymakers]{.underline} [have]{.underline} also [long
believed]{.underline} [that cyberspace]{.underline} [poses grave
perils]{.underline}. In 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned
of an impending "cyber-Pearl Harbor," in which adversaries could take
down critical U.S. infrastructure through cyberattacks. Nearly a decade
later, FBI Director Christopher Wray compared the threat from
ransomware---when actors hold a target hostage by encrypting data and
demanding a ransom payment in return for decrypting it---to the 9/11
attacks. And as recently as December 2021, Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin noted that in cyberspace, "norms of behavior aren't
well-established and the risks of escalation and miscalculation are
high."

[Seemingly]{.underline} [buttressing]{.underline} [these
claims]{.underline} [has been]{.underline} [a long record]{.underline}
[of cyber]{.underline}-operations [by hostile governments]{.underline}.
In recent years, states ranging from Russia and China to Iran and North
Korea have used cyberspace to conduct large-scale espionage, inflict
significant economic damage, and undermine democratic institutions. In
January 2021, for example, attackers linked to the Chinese government
were able to breach Microsoft's Exchange email servers, giving them
access to communications and other private information from companies
and governments, and may have allowed other malicious actors to conduct
ransomware attacks. That breach followed on the heels of a Russian
intrusion against the software vendor SolarWinds, in which hackers were
able to access a huge quantity of sensitive government and corporate
data---an espionage treasure trove. Cyberattacks have also inflicted
significant economic costs. The NotPetya attack affected critical
infrastructure around the world---ranging from logistics and energy to
finance and government---causing upward of \$10 billion in damage.

**[But]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} [assumption]{.underline} [that
cyber]{.underline}-operations play a central role in either
**[provok]{.underline}**ing [or]{.underline} **[extend]{.underline}**ing
[war is]{.underline} **[wrong]{.underline}**.
[**[Hundreds]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[cyber-[incidents]{.mark}]{.underline} [[have
occurred]{.underline}]{.mark} [between rivals]{.underline} [with **long
histories**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[tension]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} even **[conflict]{.underline}**, [[but]{.underline}
**[none]{.underline}**]{.mark} has [ever]{.underline}
**[triggered]{.underline}** an **[escalation]{.underline}** [to
war]{.underline}. [North Korea]{.underline}, for example, [has
conducted]{.underline} [major]{.underline} [cyberattacks]{.underline}
[against South Korea]{.underline} [on]{.underline} at least [four
different]{.underline} [occasions]{.underline}, including the "Ten Days
of Rain" denial of service attack---in which a network is flooded with
an overwhelming number of requests, becoming temporarily inaccessible to
users---against South Korean government websites, financial
institutions, and critical infrastructure in 2011 and the "Dark Seoul"
attack in 2013, which disrupted service across the country's financial
and media sectors.

**[No]{.underline}** [cyber operation]{.underline} [has
**[ever]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[triggered]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[It would]{.underline} [be reasonable]{.underline} [to
expect]{.underline} that [these operations]{.underline} [might
escalate]{.underline} the situation on the Korean Peninsula, especially
because North Korea's war plans against South Korea reportedly involve
cyber-operations. **[Yet]{.underline}** [that is]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [what happened]{.underline}. Instead, in each
case, [the South Korean]{.underline} [response was]{.underline}
**[minimal]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[limited]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} either [direct]{.underline}, **[official
attribution]{.underline}** [to North Korea]{.underline} by government
officials or more indirect public suggestions that Pyongyang was likely
behind the attacks.

Similarly, [although]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[reserves]{.underline} [the right]{.underline} [to **respond** to
cyberattacks]{.underline} in any way it sees fit, including [with
**military force**]{.underline}, [it has]{.underline} until now
[[relied]{.underline} [on]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
**[sanctions]{.underline}**, **[indictments]{.underline}**,
[**[diplomatic]{.underline}** [actions]{.underline}]{.mark},
[and]{.underline} [some]{.underline} reported instances of
[tit-for-tat]{.underline} cyber-[responses]{.underline}. For example,
following Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,
the [Obama]{.underline} administration [expelled]{.underline} [35
Russian diplomats]{.underline} and shuttered two facilities said to be
hubs for Russian espionage. [The Treasury]{.underline} Department also
[levied]{.underline} economic [sanctions]{.underline} against Russian
officials. Yet according to media reports, [[the]{.underline}
**[admin]{.underline}**]{.mark}[istration]{.underline} ultimately
**[[rejected]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[plans]{.underline}** [to
**conduct**]{.underline} **[[retal]{.mark}iatory
cyber-operations]{.underline}** [against Russia]{.underline}. And
although the United States did use its own cyber-operations to respond
to Russian attacks during the 2018 midterm elections, it limited itself
to temporarily disrupting the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll
farm.

[These]{.underline} measured [responses are]{.underline} [not
unusual]{.underline}. [Despite]{.underline} **[decades]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} [malicious behavior]{.underline} [in
cyberspace]{.underline}---[and **[no matter]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[the]{.mark} level]{.underline} [of
[destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}
[have **[always]{.mark}**]{.underline} [been]{.underline}
**[[contain]{.mark}ed [below]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the level
of]{.underline} **[armed [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed,
[researchers]{.underline} have [found]{.underline} [that
major]{.underline} [adversarial [powers]{.mark}]{.underline} across the
world [have]{.underline} [**[routinely observe]{.mark}**d]{.underline}
[**[a]{.underline}** "**[firebreak]{.underline}**" **[between
cyber]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[attacks]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}
**[conventional]{.underline}**]{.mark} military operations:
[a]{.underline} **[mutually understood]{.underline}**
**[line]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} [distinguishes]{.underline}
[strategic interactions]{.underline} [above and below it]{.underline},
[similar]{.underline} [to the]{.underline} **[threshold]{.underline}**
[that exists]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the employment of
[**nuclear** weapons]{.underline}.

### Impact turn -- presence good

#### Overlapping and conflicting interests in the Arctic are inevitable -- U.S.-Russian collaboration promotes nuclear stability and cooperation across issues

Pavel **Devyatkin '25**, March 18, "A New Age for US-Russia Arctic
Cooperation?" THE NATION,
https://www.thenation.com/article/world/russia-putin-trump-climate-diplomacy-war/
\[mto\]

**[US-Russia talks]{.underline}** in Saudi Arabia and the Trump-Putin
phone call **[signal]{.underline}** a possible negotiation for peace in
Ukraine and **[new opportunities for the countries' relations, including
in the Arctic region]{.underline}**.

**[The Arctic]{.underline}**, warming four times faster than the rest of
the world, **[may be the key region for the US and Russia to advance
cooperation. US-Russia rapprochement may broadly benefit the world by
bringing an end to the disastrous war in Ukraine and reducing the risk
of nuclear war]{.underline}**, but existential environmental issues
still demand attention.

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region as
a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: "We need to pursue joint
projects, including, for example, in the Arctic." The Arctic region
makes sense as a setting for cooperation as the two sides have
explicitly expressed interest in exploring cooperation in energy,
investment, and geopolitical issues. Western sanctions on Russia have
led Moscow to step up its cooperation in the Arctic with China in joint
energy ventures and grand plans for Arctic shipping. US officials now
see Arctic cooperation as a potential means to "drive a wedge" between
Moscow and Beijing.

In my meetings in Moscow with **[American and Russian
diplomats]{.underline}** and businessmen over the past few weeks, it is
clear that many **[are interested in diverse forms of Arctic
cooperation, from cultural diplomacy that celebrates the commonalities
of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the Bering Strait, to scientific
diplomacy to understand and adapt to climate hazards faced by both
nations. Business interests, however, are at the top of the
agenda]{.underline}**.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that **[rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation]{.underline}**.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

**[The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the
staff of the countries' diplomatic missions will significantly reduce
the current obstacles to US-Russia scientific cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. By making it easier to issue visas and travel
between the two countries, Americans and Russians will again be able to
conduct joint research, expeditions, and scientific conferences and
build models to better understand the unfolding climate emergency.
Scientific cooperation to understand the changes affecting sea ice,
permafrost, ecosystems, and local communities has been blunted by the
political fallout of the war in Ukraine.

**[Cooperation in the Arctic can help build regional stability. More
importantly, Arctic cooperation will build trust between the US and
Russia that could complement or spill over into other crucial fields of
cooperation such as arms control, Middle East peace, and global
health]{.underline}**.
