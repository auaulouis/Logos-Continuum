**Aff Explanation**

This is a heart of the topic affirmative -- it's big and it's definitely
topical. It's also correct on most of the central claims the aff depends
on: the US is facing a shortage of rare earth minerals, China has
dominating development now, those REMs are key to renewable energy and
military tech, and the Arctic is a key region to mine.

The Renewable Hegemony advantage highlights the fact that the future of
global leadership will depend on economic partnerships and energy
access, specifically renewable and green tech innovation. A stable
supply of REMs are key to green tech innovation and renewable energy
development, both help us solidify alliance partnerships. All of that is
key to US global leadership and hegemony. There are some 'extra'
scenarios you can read if you're fast like Energy Dependence bad and
China Tech Standards bad.

The Military Readiness advantage more directly calls out China as a
threat and links REMs to military applications (missiles, guidance
systems, satellites, radars, etc.). It argues that mineral dependence
gives China too much leverage that they will weaponize when needed. US
REM shortage calls into question our ability to deter and defend our
interests which makes hotspot escalation more likely. This advantage
also has extra scenarios, including an argument that even if China
doesn't directly confront the US militarily, an economic trade war over
REMs will escalate anyway.

Solvency is straight forward -- explore the arctic for mineral deposits
and then help develop those. Most of the 1AC cards include warrants for
why REMs are key, and the Arctic is key. The main solvency advocate is
the Watson et al. evidence (three authors writing for the Wilson
Center). Read it closely. The plan text only says, "exploration and
development," but the plan can be described with a variety of mechanism:
the US could invest in production factories, they could collaborate with
state agencies or foreign governments, they could explore and collect
information on where to mine, and (my favorite) the US could "develop
baseline metallurgical information" to share with private companies to
incentivize more mining efforts. Put simply, the US does the exploration
and development, but a lot of spillover effects help supercharge
solvency.

Enjoy the massive impacts!

## 1AC

### 1ac -- Plan 

#### Plan: The United States federal government should significantly increase its exploration and development of rare earth minerals in the Arctic.

### 1ac -- Renewable Hegemony Advantage

#### Advantage 1 -- Renewable Hege

#### The fate of US leadership depends on the Arctic -- The US is falling behind in exploration and development of Rare Earth Minerals (REMs) in the region.

[[**Climate change has impacted the Arctic more than any other region in
the world**,]{.underline}]{.mark} with changes in surface temperatures
increasing between two and three degrees over the last fifty years.
[Rising temperatures are rapidly changing the Arctic's physical
geography and **allowing increased access to an immense untapped
resource base o**f 13 percent of the world's oil reserves, nearly 30
percent of its natural gas, [a wide range of critical
minerals]{.mark},]{.underline} and fisheries accounting for 10 percent
of the global catch. [Melting ice is also freeing up new shipping
routes]{.underline} among Asia, Europe, and the U.S., cutting down
average shipping times between Europe and Asia from thirty-seven days to
twenty-two, and shipping times from the U.S. to Asia from forty-three
days to thirty-two. [Resource accessibility and expansion of commercial
shipping routes are [increasing the Arctic's]{.mark} commercial and
[strategic importance]{.mark}, [as]{.mark} national [governments]{.mark}
and private industry [move to secure greater influence]{.mark} in the
region.]{.underline} For national governments, there are both strong
incentives to cooperate on trade and investment across the Arctic, as
well as emerging disputes over territory and alliances that are
heightening tensions---particularly among geopolitical superpowers,
notably Russia, China, and the United States. [[Russia's position as the
**largest** ]{.mark}and [most economically active Arctic state]{.mark},
[and China's **growing investment** in Russia]{.mark}n infrastructure
and energy projects in the region are [fuel]{.mark}ing competition and
[potential conflict]{.mark}. For Russia, [the Arctic represents a
critical pillar for]{.mark} its economic development, with billions of
dollars' worth energy and **[mineral resources]{.mark}** for domestic
use [and]{.mark} export, and a means to expand its **[international
influence]{.mark}** through control of critical shipping routes between
Asia and Europe. To date, Russia has been the nation most heavily
invested in Arctic development, and many in Europe and Asia are reliant
on Russian natural gas exports, which are predominantly extracted
there.]{.underline} Notably, [[China has partnered extensively with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, as both an importer of Russian natural gas
and an investor in infrastructure development along the Northern Sea
Route (NSR), [[which could]{.mark} give China access to shorter shipping
routes to Europe, saving billions of dollars in shipping costs and
[strengthen]{.mark}ing [commercial ties to Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The opening of the NSR would also benefit Europe, granting easier access
to China---its second-largest commercial trade market---and paving the
way for high-speed digital connectivity between the two continents by
way of submarine Internet cables along the NSR seabed. While not
commonly reported, undersea Internet cables will play a crucial role in
spurring future tech-based industrial growth in the Arctic, as well as
in boosting Arctic nations' defense capabilities by enabling the
monitoring of both the Arctic seabed and cyberspace communications.
[[For the U.S]{.mark}., [there is]{.mark} potential to [access]{.mark} a
range [of]{.mark} resources, including critical minerals such as
[rare]{.mark} [earths]{.mark}, copper, and phosphorus. Beyond the
potential for resource extraction, [the U.S. government views the Arctic
as an arena for countering Russian and Chinese international
influence]{.mark} and is now seeking to establish a stronger presence in
the region for deterrence]{.underline}, as articulated in the Pentagon's
June 2019 Department of Defense Arctic Strategy report to Congress. As
these resource plays and global trends play out[, competition in the
Arctic is set to be a multi-dimensional and evolving power struggle with
commercial and geopolitical implications]{.underline}.

#### REMs are critical to renewable energy production -- abundant access drives green tech innovation.

Abstract. The article discusses the development issues of rare earth
metal deposits in the context of ensuring low-carbon development. The
directions of [[the use of r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}etals
[in renewable energy]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} the [production]{.mark}
[of solar panels and wind farms]{.mark},]{.underline} are shown. The
assessment of world reserves and production of rare earth metals is
given, the prospects for the development of [[r]{.mark}are
[e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}etal [deposits in the Arctic
zone]{.mark}]{.underline} of Russia are shown. Also factors that may
affect the development of the mineral resource base of Russia, including
the extraction and use of rare earth metals, are highlighted. The
economic instruments for regulating projects in the field of mining are
considered. Many economic decarbonization projects, including the
development of rare earth metal deposits, are expensive. The funds
received from the carbon tax are proposed to be used to finance and
support projects for the development of rare earth metals deposits. A
scheme for using a carbon tax to finance projects for the extraction and
use of rare earth metals has been proposed. Introduction Currently[,
[the extraction]{.mark} and use [of]{.mark} [r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth
[m]{.mark}etal[s]{.mark} [is]{.mark} considered as an [important]{.mark}
factor [in]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [dev]{.mark}elopment [of]{.mark} a
[green]{.mark} and [low-carbon econom]{.mark}y \[1\]. **[These resources
are]{.mark}** of **[strategic]{.mark}** [importance **for
econ**]{.mark}omic **[dev]{.mark}**elopment and [**determine**
the]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nological [**progress of
society**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The main areas of consumption of rare
earth metals in the world are the production of permanent magnets used
in the automotive industry (electric vehicles), renewable energy sources
(wind farms), battery production, etc. An important area of application
of rare earth materials are catalysts for the oil production and
refining industries, as well as for cleaning car exhaust gases and
emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of enterprises[.
[The]{.mark} [transition to renewable]{.mark} energy [sources increases
the demand for r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}etal[s]{.mark},
[tech]{.mark}nologies related [to the use of]{.mark} wind turbines, and
battery-powered [electric vehicles]{.mark}.]{.underline} Rare earth
metals are considered as a strategic resource, they are largely
associated with the use of low-carbon technologies for renewable energy
\[2\]. The ongoing destructive changes in the environment, climate and
their social and economic consequences are forcing many countries to
take comprehensive measures to ensure low-carbon development, including
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing renewable energy
sources. For example, one of the promising areas for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions is their deposition in underground geological horizons
\[3\]. The Russian Federation, China and other countries are striving to
achieve carbon neutrality, and technological advances related to
\"green\", climate-saving technologies can play a significant role in
this. It should be noted that the share of electricity generated from
wind and solar energy using rare earth metals in China increased from
1.2% in 2010 to 14.1% in 2022 \[4\]. The extraction of rare earth metals
in the world tends to grow steadily. Currently (2023), their global
production is 350 thousand tons, which is 3.6 times more than in 2003.
[[There are significant reserves of]{.mark} [r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth
[m]{.mark}etal[s]{.mark} [in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
example, Denmark is developing underground deposits of rare earth metals
in Greenland, which have reserves of 38.5 million tons, which is a
quarter of their global reserves. Australia, China and Vietnam are also
involved in the project to develop this field. In 2023, China received
the rights to develop rare earth metals in Greenland. Reserves of such
metals in the Canadian Arctic amount to 14.1 million tons. In addition,
Swedish Lapland has reserves of rare earth metals, which are among the
ten largest in the world \[5\]. [[The Arctic is rich in rare earth
metals]{.mark}. [The reserves]{.mark} of rare earth metal oxides in the
Arctic [are estimated]{.mark} at [about 127 million tons]{.mark}, making
it [the region with the largest reserves of]{.mark} [r]{.mark}are
[e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}etal[s]{.mark}]{.underline} outside of China.
To meet the growing demand for such metals, Russia and Canada plan to
develop and extract rare earth metals in the Arctic, and Greenland
launched a project in 2021 to develop such deposits, which involves
Australia and China. It should be noted that China is the only country
in the world with a complete production chain for the extraction of rare
earth resources, it accounts for 80-90% of the world\'s production of
rare earth goods, and the development of advanced technologies for the
extraction and enrichment of mineral raw materials makes it possible to
increase efficiency of mining and mineral extraction. Russia ranks
second in the world in terms of reserves of rare earth metals, but their
extraction is less than 1%, and processing is practically non-existent.
At the same time, these rare earth resources are mainly mined along the
way. Most of these deposits are located in remote areas of Siberia, in
the Arctic zone of the country. In addition, these deposits are
characterized by complex processes of their extraction and processing.
Extraction of such raw materials from man-made dumps on mining
activities become a promising area for the extraction of rare earth
resources. For example, from dumps and sludge storage facilities for the
extraction of placer gold at the Kular deposit in the Arctic zone of
Yakutia \[6,7\]. This will simultaneously solve the problem of
eliminating objects of past (accumulated) environmental damage and
recultivation of disturbed lands. Among the constraining factors for the
development of such deposits are the low transport development of the
territory can be distinguished the remoteness of the deposits, the high
cost of processing minerals (their development did not provide the
necessary profitability). It was also due to the lack of domestic
technologies and equipment for development. At the same time, the share
of imports of rare earth metals to Russia currently reaches 90%, and the
volume of their reserves is 28.7 million tons. The main reserves of rare
earth elements in Russia are concentrated in hard-to-reach and poorly
studied deposits. Russia will step up efforts to develop the Arctic
territories. It is estimated that only the Tomtorskoye field in the
Arctic zone of Yakutia, after production is brought to full capacity,
will be able to meet up to 10% of global demand for rare earth
materials. It should be noted that this deposit is one of the largest in
the world, its reserves contain 154 million tons of ore with a high
content of oxides of 10 rare earth elements. In the \"Strategy for the
Development of the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation and ensuring
National security for the period up to 2035\" (2020) provides for the
active development of Arctic territories, including the project for the
development of the Tomtorskoye rare earth metals deposit. The project to
develop this rare earth deposit in the Oleneksky district of the Arctic
zone of Yakutia for the extraction of niobium and other rare earth
elements can change the world market and create conditions for the
development of a new industrial industry in the country. From these
positions[, [the **development** of]{.mark} [r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth
[m]{.mark}etal [deposits]{.mark} can be **[considered as]{.mark}** one
of **[the directions of the econ]{.mark}**omy **[of the Arctic]{.mark}**
territories \[8\]]{.underline}

Why [[Chinese]{.underline} [leadership]{.underline}
[matters]{.underline}]{.mark}

Naturally enough, the debate on the future of energy in the United
States and Europe tends to revolve around the issues faced in those
markets. There is much discussion for example about the travails of the
US offshore wind industry, the supposed slowdown in EV sales, or how
hard it is to build grids. However, when seen from the perspective of
Chinese leadership of the energy transition, these [issues]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} more of a [problem]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the
[specific]{.underline} [country]{.underline} than an impediment to
global change. For example:

Offshore wind. Some have focussed on the rising cost of US offshore wind
projects38 to argue that these somehow invalidate the falling cost
driver of the energy transition. However, Chinese renewable deployment
in 2023 was more than 300 times larger than US offshore wind, which is
still at an early stage. And costs continue to fall in China for both
wind and solar. US offshore wind plans are for 1 GW of potential
deployment in 2024 compared to the 2023 actual China deployment data of
8 GW of offshore wind, 54 GW of onshore wind, and 260 GW of solar.39

EV sales. Some have argued that the United States will not embrace
electric vehicles and that the EV transition is stalling. However, as
set out in X-Change: Cars, 40 there is a clear global pathway to the
deployment of electric vehicles. China is the largest car market in the
world and is clearly blazing a trail that others can follow. A large
number of countries have moved along an S-curve growing rapidly after
reaching 5% share of sales. So far, the United States is pretty much
following this pattern.

Grids. [There is much debate about how hard it is to build
grids]{.underline}. This is not in doubt, but [it is]{.underline} also
**[clear]{.underline}** that [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has [been
[able to build dozens of u]{.mark}ltra-[h]{.mark}igh-[v]{.mark}oltage
[grids to **integrate**]{.mark} large amounts of
**[renewables]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} including those from its
planned 225 mega bases.41

Electrification. The [[share of electricity in final]{.mark} energy
[demand has **not** **changed** for a decade in the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} and Europe. However, [[it is
increasing]{.mark} by [10]{.mark} percentage [points a decade in
China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Clearly [there are solutions being found in
China which can be applied elsewhere.]{.underline}

The [United States]{.underline} and Europe [will compete for
leadership]{.underline}

The **[[future is not yet determined]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
[there]{.underline} [are]{.underline} many [reasons]{.underline} why
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and Europe [will compete
with China for leadership]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} in turn
[will]{.underline} help to **[solve]{.underline}** **[barriers to
change]{.underline}**.

The [future]{.underline} is [not]{.underline} yet
[determined]{.underline}

**[[China is the]{.mark} current [leader]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
[but]{.underline} [there]{.underline} [are]{.underline} [many races
in]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the [energy]{.mark} transition [still to play
for]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[We are still]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[at
an [early]{.mark} stage]{.underline}** in the race - only [15% of
electricity comes from solar and wind, and only 20% of final energy
comes from electricity.]{.underline}

That means [there is a race to develop the technologies of the future in
every single end-use sector,]{.underline} from steel to cement, from
heating to flying. [There is also a race to develop the technologies to
tie together end markets **most** **effectively**]{.underline}, because
flexibility is key. Further, many of the raw materials for the energy
transition come from outside China, most notably lithium from Australia
and Chile. Much raw material processing is in China, but could be done
closer to where it is extracted. Moreover, recycling offers the
opportunity to turn demand centers into raw mineral supply centers ---
mining minerals from clean tech at end-of-life. This can turn regions
devoid of natural resources but hosting large energy demand into the
future material supply hubs as well.

The **[[IRA]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
**[[brought]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates back [in]{.mark}to [the game]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} it [is highly [likely]{.mark} that the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [will lead in many areas of]{.mark} the [energy]{.mark}
transition]{.underline}.42 Meanwhile, [innovation]{.underline} **[is
happening everywhere]{.underline}**, both in the three markets we
identify here and across the world. In Japan, Korea, India, and across
the Global South there is a huge incentive to solve the barriers of the
energy transition and build new businesses.

Moreover, in the modern world **[[change can happen
fast]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Other countries have led the solar supply
chain in the past, most notably the United States, Japan, Australia, and
Germany.43 [China has been able to rise to dominance over the past
decade only.]{.underline}

\*\*\*FIGURE EXCLUDED\*\*\*

There are many reasons to compete

[There are many reasons for China]{.underline}, Europe, [and the United
States to compete]{.underline}. The [advantages of energy technology
leadership]{.underline} [are]{.underline} many. They include:

**[Industrial]{.underline}** **[leadership]{.underline}**[.
[Those]{.underline} [who]{.underline} [build]{.underline}]{.mark} the
technologies [[reap]{.mark} the [rewards]{.mark}]{.underline}. In every
sector [[there is]{.mark} now [a race to build]{.mark} and deploy [clean
tech]{.mark}nology solutions]{.underline} **[the]{.underline}**
**[[fastest]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [if **incumbents** do not
disrupt themselves]{.underline}, then **[someone else
will]{.underline}**. The classic example of this is Tesla. While the car
companies dawdled, Tesla built up a commanding lead and now sells the
majority of all electric vehicles in the United States. 44 The [[best
way to compete]{.mark} in 2024 [is to build]{.mark} up the
[electricity-powered industries]{.mark} of the future **[before your
competition does]{.mark}**]{.underline}.45

**[Jobs]{.underline}**. IEA data shows that [more]{.underline} [people
are already employed in the green energy sector than in fossil
fuels]{.underline}, and [all the job growth in energy comes from green
jobs]{.underline}.46 The incumbent argument that we need to preserve
fossil fuel jobs misses the point: [as the world shifts to renewable
energy,]{.underline} the [number of these jobs will gradually
decline]{.underline}, in the same way we no longer employ large numbers
of people to repair gas lighting, maintain transport canals, or service
horse buggies.

**[Equity]{.underline}**. It [is overwhelmingly the rich who use
expensive fossil fuel energy and the poor who suffer the consequences of
global **warming** and **pollution**]{.underline}. 47
**[Cheap]{.underline}**, **[clean]{.underline}**, and
**[universal]{.underline}** **[renewables]{.underline}** [provide us
with new tools to help solve these issues]{.underline}.
**[Lower]{.underline}** **[costs]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} lower
**[imports]{.underline}** [mean more resources to deploy on key tasks
such as reducing poverty.]{.underline} Cheaper local energy means more
energy for energy-poor households.

**[Geopolitical]{.underline}** **[influence]{.underline}**. **[[Energy
is power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It [follows that [those who
provide]{.mark} you with your [energy have]{.mark} some
[influence]{.mark} over you]{.underline}. [In the past, this energy was
fossil fuels]{.underline}, and the [ability]{.underline} [to control
supply handed enormous power to **OPEC**]{.underline}; [but]{.underline}
in the [future]{.underline}, [energy]{.underline} will [come from clean
technologies.]{.underline} A key competition of the future is likely to
be over the deployment of clean technologies in the Global South.

**[Energy]{.underline}** **[independence]{.underline}**.
[Eighty]{.underline} [percent]{.underline} [of people live in countries
that import fossil fuels]{.underline},48 but [every]{.underline}
[country]{.underline} [in the world has renewables]{.underline}, [and
almost all have huge amounts]{.underline}. The world as a whole has 100
times as much renewable potential as fossil fuel production.49
[Harvesting]{.underline} the [sun]{.underline} [will provide countries
with energy independence in a way that fossil fuels never
could.]{.underline}

**[Resilience]{.underline}**. [Local]{.underline} [energy]{.underline}
also [provides resilience because it is available even if central
facilities are damaged by the rising tide of damage linked to global
warming]{.underline}.

**[Lower]{.underline}** **[pollution]{.underline}**.
[Fossil]{.underline} [fuels]{.underline} [burn]{.underline} [15,000
million tons of fuel every year]{.underline},50 pouring nearly 40
gigatons of carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the biosphere. As
the World Health Organization notes, [7 million people a year die of
polluted air]{.underline}, making it [one of the largest killers in the
world]{.underline}.51 [Countries that deploy renewables enjoy cleaner
air, cleaner water, and cleaner land.]{.underline}

Efficiency. Fossil fuels lose two-thirds of their energy as wasted
heat.52 Renewables and electrification technologies are simply more
efficient,providing the same services with around half the primary
energy.53

**[Lower]{.underline}** **[costs]{.underline}**.
[Renewables]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [electrification]{.underline}
are [technologies on learning curves]{.underline}, so they
[provide]{.underline} a [cheaper solution than continuing with fossil
fuels]{.underline}. [That is already the case in electricity and low
temperature heat]{.underline} and is about to be the case in
transport.54 These sectors are well over half of fossil fuel demand.

**[Lower greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}**.
[Deploying]{.underline} [renewables]{.underline} [means emissions will
fall]{.underline}, [enabling]{.underline} [countries]{.underline} [to
meet their obligations under the **Paris** Agreement]{.underline}, and
making possible a livable planet.

[If]{.underline} Europe and [the United States fail to deploy new
technology]{.underline}, they **[will fall behind]{.underline}**

[[Countries]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [deploy]{.underline}]{.mark}
new [[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} [[faster will
prosper]{.underline}]{.mark}, and **[[those that do not will]{.mark}
fall into [decline]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in the same way as those
which deployed fossil fuels 200 year ago prospered while those that did
not fell into relative decline.55 Those that sought to block the growth
of electricity or cars after 1900 held back development in their
countries. 56 A [clean technology system is coming and it is better,
cheaper, cleaner, and faster]{.underline}. Costs fall each year, and
more and more sectors and countries are able to deploy renewable
technologies to their advantage. It follows that the [[attempts]{.mark}
made by some in the United States]{.underline} and Europe [[to]{.mark}
[block change]{.mark} will only end up **[weaken]{.mark}ing** those
**[nations]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

There are some [siren voices seeking to expand fossil fuel
production]{.underline} as a supposed tool of resilience. This would be
like expanding canals as a transport tool when we have invented railways
or trying to expand fixed line telecommunications rather than building
mobile stations. The primary function of fossil fuels in 2024 is to
provide a platform from which the best and the brightest can build a
renewable future. The starting gun has been fired, and [[if countries
deploy]{.mark} their [fossil fuels]{.mark} to maintain the old system,
[they face **stagnation**]{.mark} and decline.]{.underline}

[Competition]{.underline} for leadership will help [solve]{.underline}
[barriers to change]{.underline}

There are many barriers to the energy transition. It is hard to put up
solar panels or grids in the face of local opposition; it is difficult
to change pricing regimes in the face of opposition from incumbents; and
it is hard to electrify sectors that run on fossil fuels.

All of this is true, but [as the cleantech race between China and its
strategic competitors]{.underline} **[widens]{.underline}**, we are
highly [likely to see a push to electrify sectors that have struggled to
change]{.underline}. The reason why [countries]{.underline} [will solve
these barriers is because of **strong** **economic** **forces** as well
as **geopolitical** **necessity**]{.underline}; [they will be left
behind if they fail to act]{.underline}. A [powerful]{.underline}
[solvent]{.underline} that tends to appeal across the political divide
[is the desire for energy security and geopolitical
influence.]{.underline} We already see echoes of this as military forces
start to electrify vehicles and build renewables and microgrids to
enhance resilience,57 and politicians seek to make supply chains
domestic.58

[China's **Renewable** Energy Strategy]{.underline}

In 2015, [**China** unveiled its plan to build **supergrids** that
**transcended** national **borders**]{.underline}. State Grid, China's
state-owned electric company, is the leader behind the transcontinental
supergrid, Global Energy Interconnection (GEI). [[The
**GEI**]{.underline}]{.mark}, coupled [[with the
**BRI**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[forms]{.underline}]{.mark} the
foundation of [[China's **energy** strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}. 

The BRI focuses on building infrastructure by providing financial
support through the Silk Road Fund, China Construction Bank, Bank of
China, and other lending institutions. Recently, [[**green energy**
projects under the **BRI** are **multiplying**]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly in the Middle East. In 2017, Dubai's Electricity and Water
Authority and Saudi Arabia's ACWA Power launched the largest
Concentrated Solar Power project in collaboration with Shanghai
Electric. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China---the lead broker
for loans along with Bank of China and Agricultural Bank of China---all
played a crucial part in financing the megaproject.

[China's green pursuits]{.underline} in the region are
[likely]{.underline} to [affect the **Middle East's** relationship with
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and]{.underline} the European Union ([EU]{.underline}) as their primary
oil suppliers. On one hand, the global push for renewables and the
increased number of renewable energy projects in the Middle East---led
by China---can ease geopolitical conflicts around oil and petroleum. On
the other hand, it can strengthen diplomatic ties between China and
countries in the Middle East.

[The BRI and GEI initiated **green projects**]{.underline} for two
reasons: first, [to **expand**]{.underline} China's economic and
[political **influence**]{.underline}; second, to reduce the reliance on
energy imports flowing through chokepoints such as the Straits of
Malacca and the South China Sea, as these are strategic entry points
that China will safeguard at all costs.   

[[The GEI]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular [[offers a **golden
opportunity**]{.mark} [for China to **flex** its]{.mark} geopolitical
[might]{.mark}]{.underline}. By supplying critical and cutting-edge
technologies such as UHV and smart grids, China is revealing its
aspirations to become the backbone of the supergrid power system. Once
China manages to exert dominance over the system, [[it can use]{.mark}
the **threat** of [electricity **cut-offs** as a]{.mark} foreign policy
**[bargaining chip]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Should disputes arise,
[[countries that enjoy]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**close ties** with
China]{.underline}]{.mark} and importer nations in a more vulnerable
position [might **[side with China]{.mark}**]{.underline} in fear of
retaliatory attacks on their energy sector. In doing so, [[China
could]{.mark} end up **[mandati]{.mark}**ng the
[rules]{.mark}]{.underline} and standards [[that govern
**renewables**]{.underline}]{.mark} in a way that adheres to its own
wishes. 

More Renewables, More Fossil Fuels

[Despite their goal to achieve]{.underline} [carbon
neutrality]{.underline} by 2060, [[China is inadvertently
**increasing**]{.underline}]{.mark} carbon dioxide
**[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}** in an effort to gain ground in the
renewables industry. To rectify that, President Jinping reiterated
China's commitment to reducing the burning of coal and other fossil
fuels. By portraying itself as a global leader in climate action,
[[China **masks**]{.underline}]{.mark} the fact that it's [increasing
its [imports of **crude oil**]{.mark}]{.underline} from other countries
[while continuing to invest in **coal** plants]{.underline}. In 2019,
crude oil imports skyrocketed to 506 million tons, marking an
unprecedented increase of 9.5 percent from 2018. 

A [more troubling]{.underline} development, however, [is
[China's]{.mark}]{.underline} construction of efficient
[[**coal**-fired]{.underline}]{.mark} power [[plants **beyond** its
**borders**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Between 2003 and 2017, China invested
\$12 billion in coal projects in Southeast Asia---namely Bangladesh,
Indonesia, Pakistan, and Vietnam---as well as Turkey and South Africa.
In doing so, [China]{.underline} essentially [[unloaded]{.mark} its
[**pollution** on **other countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}, many of
which are developing nations that should ideally be moving towards
cleaner energy sources. 

In addition to bearing China's "pollution burden," [these countries are
becoming **increasingly dependent** on the Asian nation]{.underline}.
Soon, these developing countries might turn to China for sustainable
renewable energy supply, clean technologies, and finance, thereby
strengthening their relationship with China and further distancing
themselves from the United States and the EU. 

The Rise of a Renewable Energy Superpower

China's milestones in renewable energy are largely a result of a
government-led regulatory and incentive-based system coupled with timely
investments in technology and R&D. In its infancy, the Chinese
government introduced feed-in-tariffs, tax exemptions, and subsidies to
businesses in the renewables industry. 

Most recently, regulators tightened the laws and rules governing
renewable power supply to ensure maximum efficiency from local grid
firms and reduce renewable energy waste. China is also gradually
withdrawing subsidies, opening local firms to competition, and approving
new projects based on their transmission capacity. China is already
bearing the fruit of these new regulations: the country reported a
2.4-percent reduction in energy loss in the solar power sector in the
first half of 2019.     

There is a range of international factors that directly or indirectly
contribute to China's rise as a renewable energy superpower. The former
Trump administration's disregard for climate change and uncooperative
attitude towards international organizations all worked in China's favor
as Beijing tried to level the energy playing field by maintaining close
partnerships with oil-producing countries. 

But [this]{.underline} backdrop [is gradually shifting
under]{.underline} the new Joe **[Biden]{.underline}** administration.
With a firm commitment to **[gradually]{.underline}** phase out carbon
dioxide emissions, Biden's vision for America is built on clean
energy-led development and energy-efficient systems. [Domestic energy
**goals** are **complemented** by promising steps on the **multilateral
front**]{.underline}, such as the United States' recommitment to the
Paris Climate Accord. 

[[How the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates or any other country [[decides to
**engage**]{.underline}]{.mark} with [[China with]{.underline}]{.mark}
respect to [[**energy** will **decide**]{.mark} [how things **pan**
out]{.mark}]{.underline} in the future. [[If
**China\'s**]{.underline}]{.mark} [current]{.underline} [[**energy**
strategy follows through]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[it could
**erode**]{.underline}]{.mark} [traditionally]{.underline} **[strong
[alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[such as]{.underline}]{.mark} those
between [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and **Saudi**]{.underline}]{.mark}
Arabia, or the EU and North Africa. [[China's **rise**]{.mark} as
a]{.underline} **[re]{.underline}**newable energy [superpower [will
introduce]{.mark}]{.underline} [**new [hubs]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
geopolitical **[power]{.mark}** and create]{.underline} new [winners and
losers]{.underline} on the international stage. As much as China's
leadership in clean energy is appreciated and welcomed, world leaders
must be aware of the political motives underlying China's strategies. It
will take strong regulatory mechanisms, the proactive participation of
all countries, and greater scrutiny of green projects to reap the
benefits of China's renewable energy initiatives. 

[For [countries]{.mark}]{.underline} to be successful in [**[countering
Chinese]{.mark}** political [objectives]{.mark}]{.underline},
[they]{.underline} will **[[need]{.underline}]{.mark}** to take
**[[swift]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [[**decisive**
action]{.underline}]{.mark}. The first step is to diversify the critical
materials supply chain. This involves increasing domestic manufacturing
and processing and facilitating technology transfers among countries
like the United States, Australia, Brazil, and India. Last year, the
European Commission took a step toward reviewing and communicating the
EU's critical raw materials resilience, echoing its commitment to the
circular use and recycling of raw materials. This provides a good
starting point for countries to initiate research, innovation, and
large-scale investments considering the existing information gap on
building alternate technologies from a mix of critical and non-critical
materials.

Such [[innovative]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[sustainable
**alternatives** will]{.underline}]{.mark} help [[**draw** support
**from China**]{.mark} in]{.underline} the form of finance and
capacity-building. While the ultimate goal is to ensure the sustainable
use of critical materials, [the **immediate step** is to build
**individual capacities**]{.underline} in order [to **diversify** the
players providing **downstream** services]{.underline} in the supply
chain [over which **China** currently holds **leverage**]{.underline}.

The second step is to provide a counterbalance to China's growing
influence in global energy finance with the twin goals of steering
emerging countries from fossil fuel projects and facilitating the free
flow of money and technological know-how. For instance, the United
States and members of the EU can provide loans on low interest rates to
execute clean energy projects in more oil-dependent nations. 

However, that is just one of the many ways in which renewable energy
projects can be supported---terminating public financing for coal and
oil projects is another. In a recent executive order, Biden announced
his plans to end financing of fossil fuel projects overseas, although
the decision to do so comes far after similar policies were already
implemented in the United Kingdom, South Korea, and Japan. 

[[As developing countries find **more**]{.mark} funding
**[options]{.mark}** for clean energy]{.underline} projects, [[the
**price**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of renewables]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely **[[fall]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
thereby lowering the demand for fossil fuel. A study by the UK-based
research firm Wood Mackenzie concluded that by 2030, renewable power in
India will cost 56 percent less than energy derived from coal. Renewable
energy technologies have a unique advantage over fossil fuel---the
former follows learning curves. 

That is, [[every time]{.underline}]{.mark} the cumulative installed
[[**capacity** is **doubled**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
[[cost]{.underline}]{.mark} of renewables [[**decreases** by the **same
proportion**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[which can
**incentivize**]{.underline}]{.mark} countries to adopt [[more
**re**]{.mark}newable energy [initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline}. That
way, promoting clean energy projects over time can turn competition into
cooperation in energy finance by partnering with China-supported
financial institutions such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank
and the China Development Bank. That will not only help augment the
finances required to scale up clean energy investments, but also monitor
many of China's energy projects executed under the BRI.    

A prerequisite to the above-mentioned steps is the efficient utilization
of multilateral platforms such as the G20, the international platform on
sustainable finance, and the International Solar Alliance. Through these
platforms, standards for clean energy projects, dispute settlement
mechanisms, and avenues for cooperation can be decided. 

If history is any indication, [isolation and [**disengagement** only
attract]{.mark} unnecessary [**retaliation** from
**Beijing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Creating [sustainable
**alternatives**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the renewable energy market
[[signals a **forward-looking** approach]{.underline}]{.mark} [[rather
than]{.underline}]{.mark} a desire [[to **replace**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Chinese leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} in the field---that should be
enough to convince China to cooperate and reign in its unsustainable
increase of fossil fuel initiatives.

evil]{.underline} that escalates [every]{.underline} hotspot.**

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} post-1945 **[[world]{.mark}
order]{.underline}** -- written into international law, ratified by the
United Nations, and kept in place by the balance of nuclear terror among
major powers -- [[is **hanging** by a **thread**. The
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [is
**divided** against itself and **stretched** to the limits of its
capabilities]{.underline}. Europe is waking up to the possibility that,
come November, [America may **no longer** fulfill its]{.underline}
collective-[defense obligations]{.underline} under Article 5 of the NATO
treaty. Faced with this new uncertainty, Europe is cranking up its
defense production, and European politicians are screwing up the courage
to persuade their electorates that they will need to ante up 2% of their
GDP to guarantee their own safety.

[The Western alliance]{.underline} doesn't just face the challenge of
doubling down on defense while maintaining unity across the Atlantic. It
also now [[faces an "**axis**]{.mark} **of resistance**[" that
might]{.mark} be tempted to **[threaten]{.mark}** Western
[hegemony]{.mark} with a]{.underline} simultaneous, [**coordinated**
challenge. [The **lynchpin**]{.mark} of this axis [is the
**Russia-China**]{.mark} "no-limits" [partnership]{.mark}]{.underline}.
While [[the **Chinese** supply]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Russians
with]{.mark} **advanced [circuitry]{.mark}** [for their weapons]{.mark}
systems]{.underline}, Russian President Vladimir [[Putin ships
them]{.mark} **cheap [oil]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Together
[[they]{.mark} have [imposed]{.mark} **autocratic [rule]{.mark}**
[over]{.mark} most of [Eurasia]{.mark}]{.underline}.

If Ukraine's exhausted defenders are forced to concede Russian
sovereignty over Crimea and the Donbas region, the Eurasian axis of
dictators will have succeeded in changing a European land frontier by
force. Achieving [[this will threaten]{.mark} **every
state**]{.underline} on the edge of Eurasia: [[**Taiwan**, the
**Baltic**]{.underline}]{.mark} countrie[[**s**, and]{.mark} even
**[Poland]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both **[dictatorial
[regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}** will [[use their vetoes]{.mark} on the
**UN S**]{.underline}ecurity **[C]{.underline}**ouncil [[to **ratify**
conquest]{.underline}]{.mark}, effectively consigning the UN Charter to
history's dustbin.

This partnership of [[dictators]{.mark} work]{.underline}s [[**in
tandem** with]{.underline}]{.mark} a cluster of [**rights-abusing
[renegades]{.mark}**[, led by **Iran** and
**No**]{.mark}]{.underline}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea. The
North [[Koreans provide]{.mark} Putin with **artillery [shells]{.mark}**
while plotting to invade the rest of their **peninsula**]{.underline}.
The [[Iranians manufacture]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[drones]{.mark}**
that terrorize Ukrainians]{.underline} in their trenches. Meanwhile,
[Iran's **proxies**]{.underline} -- [Hamas, Hezbollah, and the
Houthis]{.underline} -- [are]{.underline} helping Russia and China by
[**tying down** America and Israel]{.underline}.

Unless [the US]{.underline} can force Israel into a long-term ceasefire,
it [will find itself **struggling** to control conflicts on **three
fronts**]{.underline} (Asia, Europe, and the Middle East). Not even a
country that outspends its rivals on defense by two to one can maintain
a war footing simultaneously across so many theaters.

The idea that democracies around the world will join up with America and
Europe against the authoritarian threat seems like an illusion. Instead
of joining with the embattled democracies of the Global North, the
[rising democracies]{.underline} of the Global South -- Brazil, India,
and South Africa -- [seem **unembarrassed** to be aligning with
[regimes]{.mark} that [rely on]{.mark} **mass
[repression]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the [[cantonment of]{.mark} **entire
populations** (the **[Uighurs]{.mark}** in China), [and]{.mark}
**shameless [murder]{.mark}** (**Navalny** being]{.underline} only [the
most recent example]{.underline}).

To be sure, the authoritarian axis currently is united only by what it
opposes: American power. It is otherwise divided by its ultimate
interests. The Chinese, for example, cannot be overjoyed that the
Houthis are blocking freight traffic through the Red Sea. The world's
second most powerful economy doesn't have all that much in common with
an impoverished Muslim resistance army or with theocratic Iran.

Moreover, both [Russia and China remain **parasitic beneficiaries** of a
global economy that is **sustained** by [US]{.mark} **alliances** and
**[deterrence]{.mark}**. That [is why they]{.mark} still
**[hesitate]{.mark}** to challenge the hegemon **too
directly**]{.underline}. However, [[like **sharks**, they smell
**blood**]{.mark} **in the water**]{.underline}. They have not only
survived US sanctions but continued to prosper, replacing their
dependence on embargoed markets with new markets in Latin America, Asia,
and India. Both Russia and China have discovered that American control
of the global economy is not what it once was.

This [[discovery of]{.mark} **American [weakness]{.mark}** [might
tempt]{.mark} them to risk]{.underline} a [[joint]{.mark} **military
[challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As matters stand, [US]{.underline}
diplomacy and [[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} have [**successfully**
[kept the axis **divided**]{.mark}]{.underline}. CIA Director William
Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are keeping the
channels open to China. Blowback American strikes against Iran have
apparently convinced the theocrats to rein in Hezbollah and the militias
in Iraq -- though not the Houthis, whom nobody seems able to control.

[It doesn't take **strategic genius** to see the **opportunity** China
and Russia might be contemplating. [If they decided to mount a]{.mark}n
**overt [challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the American order -- for
example, with a coordinated, simultaneous offensive against Ukraine and
Taiwan -- [the US would **struggle**]{.underline} to rush weapons and
technology into the breach.

**[[Nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}**lear weapon[[**s** would
not]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[deter]{.underline}]{.mark} China
and Russia from risking a coordinated attempt to take Taiwan and the
rest of Ukraine. [All [parties would pay a]{.mark} **horrendous
[price]{.mark}**, but Russia has **shown** what it is willing to expend
in **Ukraine**, and]{.underline} both [[China and Russia]{.mark} may
[believe]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[there will **never** be a more
**opportune** moment]{.mark} to **overthrow** American
hegemony]{.underline}. If they were to combine forces, we would face the
most serious challenge to the global economic and strategic order since
1945.

For decades, [**U.S.** policymakers failed to understand the **full
meaning** of energy independence. Their **definition** centered on the
need for]{.underline} a self-sufficient supply of [**cheap oil and
gas**. That understanding was so dominant it became a matter of
**national security**---eclipsing nearly all other environmental
considerations]{.underline}. U.S. President Joe Biden is making a
different bet. [Biden realizes two things. First, **climate change** is
its own **national security threat**; second, real **[energy
independence]{.mark}** now [means securing]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[resources]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [ideas]{.underline} [needed
for]{.underline} [**21st-century** energy
technologies]{.underline}---among other things, [**[solar]{.mark}**
panels, **[r]{.mark}**are-**[e]{.mark}**arth
**[m]{.mark}**etal**[s]{.mark}**, **[batteries]{.mark}**, and
**[wind]{.mark}** turbines]{.underline}. Yet although the Biden
administration has made great strides forward with this acknowledgment,
its climate strategy has room to grow. [As climate change continues to
**destabilize** at-risk **regions** worldwide, threatening to draw the
**U**nited **S**tates into more protracted, **international conflicts**,
the administration needs to do more to treat climate change as a matter
of **national security**]{.underline} rather than as just an
environmental concern---[and to move toward **true energy independence**
in the process]{.underline}.

[For **too long**, policymakers thought]{.underline} the **[oil and
gas]{.underline}** industry [was the **key** to energy
independence]{.underline}. They gave the industry special treatment,
allowing it to operate with minimal environmental restrictions in an
effort to boost the economy and unshackle the country from its reliance
on foreign hydrocarbons. From one perspective, that made sense: The oil
and gas boom that began in the early 2000s, with the advent of hydraulic
fracturing (or fracking), made the United States the largest oil
producer in the world. It provided a significant windfall to the economy
and enabled the country to cut its reliance on foreign oil and gas in
half.

[However, this traditional promotion---and **conception**---of energy
independence **ignored**]{.underline} the pressing issue of [**climate
change**. The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates failed to
effectively **diversify** its energy portfolio, and now, it
**[lags]{.mark} behind** other nations [in renewables]{.mark}. This
oversight has become a **liability**. [Other countries
are]{.mark}]{.underline} outright [[**refusing** to buy **U.S.**]{.mark}
natural [gas for being "]{.mark}**too [dirty]{.mark}**["]{.mark}; carbon
border adjustments, or tariffs]{.underline} on products with high carbon
emissions, [threaten to **[disrupt]{.mark}** the **[competitive
advantage]{.mark}** U.S.]{.underline}-made products [have]{.underline};
and now, sourcing the materials from abroad to build renewables has
become trickier than it was before.

As hydrocarbons become less of a geopolitical priority, [the meaning of
"**energy [independence]{.mark}**" is changing]{.underline}---in ways
that have made it hard for the United States to keep up. [It's no longer
[measured]{.mark} by oil extraction, but [by]{.mark} new,
**[low-carbon]{.mark}** energy **[tech]{.mark}**nologies, such as
**solar panels**, wind **turbines**, **e**lectric
**v**ehicle**s**]{.underline}, and even responsibly sourced natural gas.
[**China** has the power to **influence U.S.** energy production,
defense technologies, and other industries]{.underline}. Although U.S.
policymakers dithered for the past 30 years, [the **country** continued
to **lag behind** the competition for these **newer tech**nologies and
the **critical minerals** needed to build them. And **[China]{.mark}**
has **[rushed ahead]{.mark}**. It's now responsible for more than
**half** of the world's **solar** panel module **[exports]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} it [controls]{.mark}, for instance, **[80 percent]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the world's [battery]{.mark} **material** [refining]{.mark}
and **77 percent** of the world's battery cell
**capacity**]{.underline}. By now, Washington relies on other
nations---especially China---for the critical mineral imports needed to
build everything from electric vehicles to solar panels and wind
turbines. Limitations on these minerals can make it harder to adopt
low-carbon technologies and can leave Washington vulnerable to the whims
and desires of those nations. [**China**, essentially, has the power to
[**influence** U.S. energy]{.mark} production, defense technologies, and
other **industries** that rely on the same critical
materials]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, [as the **U**nited **S**tates continues to be the **second
largest** contributor of **g**reen**h**ouse **g**as emissions, climate
change has **amplified everything** from humanitarian crises that drag
Washington into protracted **foreign conflicts** to the growth of
**terrorist org**anization**s** that threaten domestic security.
According to the **C**limate **I**mpact **L**ab]{.underline}, some
[nations]{.underline}, including Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria, [could
see]{.underline} more than [a **20 percent reduction** in their **GDP**s
by 2090 due to climate change as they face]{.underline} deaths from
[**heat waves**, **famines**, **floods**, and **crumpling
infrastructure**]{.underline} from storms and rising sea levels. [The
destruction wrought by these changes can be a [**catalyst** for]{.mark}
humanitarian [**crises**, **genocide**]{.mark}, and
**[terrorism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For instance, [[competition
over]{.mark} depleting [resources]{.mark} can worsen regional
fighting]{.underline}, as it did in 1994 when arable land shortages
contributed to the genocide in Rwanda. [It can also **[spark
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as it did in Syria in 2007 when drought
was linked to the nation's protests and subsequent revolution. [The last
two decades have shown it is **increasingly [difficult]{.mark}** [for
Washington to **stay out**]{.mark} of international
conflict]{.underline}s---either because they pose a direct threat to the
United States, as the stability of Afghanistan did, or because they make
the country vulnerable to criticism that it is complacent in the face of
international travesties, as it was during the revolution in Syria.

#### That prevents [great power war]{.underline}.

The new direction has yielded quick results. For the first time, U.S.
crude has found its way to [**China** and **India**]{.underline},
traditional markets for producers that consider the U.S. the vital ally.
The [significance]{.underline} of those two markets [lies in the fact
that they are projected to have the most **substantial increases** in
**energy demand** in years to come]{.underline}. In India alone, the
growth in demand is expected to increase by 333% by 2040. The question
becomes, [how will the **[relationship]{.mark}** between the **U.S.**
and its oil-producing allies change when competition [for **global
market**]{.mark} **share** of oil exports [turns]{.mark} the U.S. from
an **indispensable partner** [to]{.mark} a heavyweight contender and
[a]{.mark} possible **[existential threat]{.mark}**?]{.underline}

[Recent **tech**nological **advancements** in **[renewable]{.mark}
energy** are rapidly making them **commercially viable** competitors in
**fulfilling** the new growth in energy **demand**]{.underline}, which
would have traditionally gone to fossil fuels. Japan is leading the pack
with hydrogen cell and molten salt battery technology. In the
**[U.S.]{.underline}**, Tesla [is making **e**lectric **v**ehicle**s**
competitive and affordable]{.underline} with its Colorado-based
Gigafactory and the introduction of the Model 3, which had five hundred
thousand pre orders at launch. Not to be outdone, China has adopted
policies to open up the automotive industry to electric vehicles
encouraging investors and producers with generous subsidies.
Additionally, [**[China]{.mark}** is diligently trying to
**[shift]{.mark}** its energy mix away from fossil fuels]{.underline}
primarily [[for]{.mark} **national [security]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
environmental reasons. Recently the world's largest floating solar power
plant was inaugurated in Huainan in May. [**India** is **not** too **far
behind**]{.underline} with the country planning to install 225 GW of
renewables by 2022 which will comprise 57% of its electricity generation
capacity.

[**Other forms** of energy are increasingly and successfully becoming
part of the **energy mix** such as **geothermal** energy]{.underline}
which is projected to cost only 4.78 cents per kWh in 2020 according to
the EIA, and that is lower than a natural gas combined cycle plant.

[With a **perfect [storm]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} fossil fuel demand
destruction and increasingly **[cheaper alt]{.mark}**ernative[**s**,
producers]{.mark} will [become]{.mark} ever more **[aggressive]{.mark}**
in gaining and keeping market share. The **U**nited **S**tates will have
a **tech**nological **advantage** that will allow it to increase
**production** and **export** capacity **faster** and
**cheaper**]{.underline} compared to many producers who will struggle
just to maintain current levels of production as their domestic
consumption keeps growing.

Astutely, the vanguards of solar energy are some of the major oil
producers such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates, with the Emirate of Abu Dhabi holding the current record for
the lowest solar electric production cost, at 2.42 cents/kWh in 2016.

Such pragmatic thinking is necessary as their oil consumption keeps
increasing to fuel their growing economies. Saudi Arabia today consumes
3.895 million barrels per day, an increase of 4.36% from a year ago as
per BP Statistical Review of World Energy Report.

[**[Energy dominance]{.mark}** now more than ever, is [**strategically
indispensable** for the U.S.]{.mark} as it deals with **multiple
geopolitical threats** such as the [adversarial]{.mark} relationship
with **[China]{.mark}** and a [resurgent **Russia**]{.mark} that is
getting ready to create the largest military buildup at the edge of
**NATO territory**]{.underline} when it conducts military drills with
100,000 troops in Belarus this summer. **[China]{.underline}**, on the
other hand, [is rapidly **modernizing** its **defense** industry and
projecting its power beyond its **immediate vicinity** having set up and

Oil and gas comprise over 60% of Russia exports, and make up over 30% of
its GDP so naturally the Rubble is highly correlated to the price of
oil. As such, the United States no doubt gains leverage from any
acquired influence over the global price of oil and gas.

On the other hand, [geopolitical **tensions** around vital maritime
**choke points**, such as the **Strait of [Hormuz]{.mark}** and **[Bab

[**Africa**, **No**]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea, [and]{.mark} the
**[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea]{.underline}.

Another geopolitical dynamic that [**[energy dominance]{.mark}** will
[create]{.mark}]{.underline} is that it will turn market share into [a
**diplomatic token** of friendship that can **strategically** be
**given-up** by some exporters, or offered by importers such as India,
in return for [**closer** diplomatic and military **ties**]{.mark} with
the U.S.]{.underline}, regardless of the economics of such propositions.
[Internationally, **[lines]{.mark}** will be **[redrawn]{.mark}** in the

[find new]{.mark} common [bonds]{.mark} to remain viable. [**Military
doctrines**, **strategies** and]{.mark} by extension
**[equipment]{.mark}** will **[change]{.mark}**
accordingly]{.underline}.

Domestically, [the **U.S.** economy will be extremely **competitive** as
it will have access to **cheap energy** which will have a **positive

[**Develop New Rules** for Disruptive Technologies]{.underline}

[[The system must]{.mark} also be **[adapt]{.mark}ed** [to]{.mark} deal
with **new issues** that were not envisioned when the existing order was
designed. Foremost among these issues is **[emerging]{.mark} and
disruptive [tech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}, including AI, additive
manufacturing (or 3D printing), quantum computing, genetic engineering,
robotics, directed energy, the Internet of things (IOT), 5G, space,
cyber, and many others. [Like other disruptive technologies before them,
[these]{.mark} innovations **[promise great benefits]{.mark}**,
[but]{.mark} also **[carry serious]{.mark} downside
[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [**[AI]{.mark}** is already
resulting in massive efficiencies and cost savings in the private
sector]{.underline}. Routine tasks and other more complicated jobs, such
as radiology, are already being automated. In the future, [**autonomous
weapons systems** [may go to war]{.mark} against each other as human
soldiers remain out of harm's way]{.underline}. Yet, AI is also
transforming economies [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} societies, and
generating new security challenges. [Automation will [lead to]{.mark}
**widespread [unemployment]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The final realization
of driverless cars, for example, will put out of work millions of taxi,
Uber, and long-haul truck drivers. [**Populist movements** in the West
have been driven by those disaffected by globalization and technology,
and **mass unemployment** caused by automation will further **grow those
ranks**]{.underline} and provide new fuel to grievance politics.
Moreover, [some fear that autonomous weapons systems will become
"**[killer robots]{.mark}**"]{.underline} that select and engage targets
without human input, and could eventually turn on their creators,
[**[result]{.mark}ing [in]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The [other technologies]{.underline} on this list [similarly balance
**great potential upside** with **great downside risk**. **[3D
printing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example, [[can]{.mark} be used to
"make anything anywhere," reducing costs for a wide range of
manufactured goods and encouraging a return of local manufacturing
industries]{.underline}.61 At the same time, [advanced 3D printers can
also [be used by]{.mark} **revisionist and [rogue states]{.mark}** to
print component parts [for]{.mark} **advanced weapons systems** or even
**[WMD]{.mark} programs**, [spurring]{.mark} **arms races** and
**weapons [prolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}.62 [[**Genetic
engineering** can wipe]{.mark} out **entire classes of
[disease]{.mark}**]{.underline} through improved medicine, [[or]{.mark}
wipe out **entire classes of [people]{.mark}** through genetically
engineered superbugs]{.underline}. Directed-energy missile defenses may
defend against incoming missile attacks, while also undermining global
strategic stability.

[Perhaps the greatest risk to **global strategic
stability**]{.underline} from new technology, however, [comes from the
risk that **revisionist autocracies** may **win the new tech arms
race.**]{.underline} Throughout history, [states that have dominated the
commanding heights of technological progress have also **dominated
international relations.** The United States has been the **world's
innovation leader**]{.underline} from Edison's light bulb to nuclear
weapons and the Internet. [Accordingly, **stability has been
maintained** in Europe and Asia for decades because the United States
and its democratic allies possessed a favorable economic and military
balance of power]{.underline} in those key regions. Many believe,
however, that China may now have the lead in the new technologies of the
twenty-first century, including AI, quantum, 5G, hypersonic missiles,
and others. [[If China]{.mark} succeeds in **[master]{.mark}ing the
[tech]{.mark}nologies** of the future **[before the democratic
core]{.mark}**, then [this]{.mark} could lead to a **drastic and [rapid
shift]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the **balance of [power]{.mark}**,
**[upset]{.mark}ting global [strategic stability]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
the call for [a]{.mark} **democratic-led, [rules-based
system]{.mark}**]{.underline} outlined in these pages.63

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} its **democratic
[allies]{.mark}** [need to]{.mark} work]{.underline} with other major
powers [to **[develop]{.mark} a framework** for **harnessing emerging
technology** in a way that **maximizes its upside potential**, while
**mitigating** against its **downside risks**, and also contributing to
the maintenance of **global stability**. [The existing]{.mark}
international [order]{.mark}]{.underline} contains a wide range of
agreements for harnessing the technologies of the twentieth century, but
they [need to be updated for the twenty-first century]{.underline}. The
world needs an entire new set of arms-control, nonproliferation,
export-control, and other agreements to exploit new technology while
mitigating downside risk. [These agreements should seek to **maintain
global strategic stability**]{.underline} among the major powers, [and
**prevent the proliferation** of dangerous weapons systems to hostile
and revisionist states.]{.underline}

A new technology committee established under the auspices of a revamped
D10 could serve as a forum for the democratic core to converge on common
standards for the protection of privacy, individual rights, and liberal
values amid rapid technological change. [[It is]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [**[imperative]{.mark}** that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} its **democratic [allies]{.mark}** [maintain]{.mark} their
**[innovation edge]{.mark}**. This means cultivating their]{.underline}
traditional advantages in this area, including in education, research
and development, openness to immigration, and strong capital markets. It
could discuss the creation of formal norms and standards to guide the
ethical uses of technology, from AI to genetic engineering to "killer
robots." This D10 Technology Norms Committee could also serve as a
platform to coordinate on strategies to ensure that the United States
and its democratic allies maintain their [innovation edge in areas of
**critically sensitive technology,** [and]{.mark} **forge
[agree]{.mark}ments** **[to address]{.mark} threats** posed by
**adversaries**. It also means **properly understanding** the threat
posed by **[Chinese techn]{.mark}ology**]{.underline}. China's 5G
investments in Europe, for example, are not about business, but about
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control. [The democratic core should
**counter China's industrial policies**]{.underline} that violate
international trading standards, [and defend against the **national
security threat** posed by the penetration of **Chinese technology**
into their societies.]{.underline}

### 1ac -- Military Readiness Advantage

#### Advantage 2 is Military Readiness

#### China is pursuing of strategy of REM dominance -- that threatens US military dominance

**Kuo '23** \[Lily Kuo, Washington Post\'s China bureau chief,
10-19-2023, \"[China is set to **dominate** the deep sea and its wealth
of rare metals]{.underline}\", Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2023/china-deep-sea-mining-military-renewable-energy/\]/Kankee

When the 5,100-ton Dayang Hao, one of China's most advanced deep-water
expedition vessels, left port south of Shanghai two months ago, a
red-and-white banner --- the kind used to blast Communist Party
exhortations --- reminded the crew of their mission: "Strive, explore,
contribute." The Dayang Hao was bound for a 28,500-square-mile stretch
of the Pacific Ocean between Japan and Hawaii where [[China has
**exclusive** rights]{.mark} to prospect [for]{.mark}]{.underline}
lumpy, golf-ball-size [[rocks]{.underline}]{.mark} that are millions of
years old and [worth **trillions**]{.underline} of dollars. It is
China's latest contract, won in 2019, to explore for "polymetallic
nodules," which are rich in manganese, cobalt, nickel and copper ---
metals [[needed for]{.underline}]{.mark} [everything from electric cars
to advanced [weapons systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. They lie temptingly
on the ocean floor, just waiting to be hoovered up. Whether working deep
at sea or on land at the headquarters of the United Nations' seabed
regulator here in Kingston, [Beijing is striving to get a jump
on]{.underline} the burgeoning industry of [deep-sea
mining]{.underline}. [[China]{.mark} already [holds]{.mark}
**[five]{.mark}** of the 30 exploration [licenses]{.mark} that
the]{.underline} International Seabed Authority ([ISA]{.underline}) has
[granted]{.underline} to date --- [the most of any country]{.underline}
--- in preparation for the start of deep-sea mining as soon as 2025.
When that happens, [China will have exclusive rights to excavate 92,000
square miles of international seabed]{.underline} --- about the size of
the United Kingdom --- or 17 percent of the total area currently
licensed by the ISA. [[The ocean]{.mark} floor [is]{.mark} shaping up to
be [the]{.mark} world's [next theater of]{.mark} global [resource
**competition**]{.mark} --- and [China is set to **dominate**
it]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The sea is believed to hold several
times what land does of these rare metals, which are critical for almost
all of]{.underline} today's [electronics, **clean-energy** products and
advanced computer chips]{.underline}. As countries race to cut
greenhouse gas emissions, [demand for these minerals is expected to
skyrocket]{.underline}. [[When deep-sea mining begins]{.mark},
[China]{.mark} --- which already controls 95 percent of the world's
supply of rare-earth metals and produces three-quarters of all
lithium-ion batteries]{.underline} --- [[will extend its]{.mark}
[**chokehold** over emerging industries]{.mark} like clean
energy]{.underline}. [Mining]{.underline} [will]{.underline} also [give
Beijing a potent new tool in its escalating rivalry with the United
States]{.underline}. As a sign of how [[these resources could be
**weaponized**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [China]{.underline} in August
[started restricting exports of]{.underline} two [metals]{.underline}
that are [key to U.S. defense systems]{.underline}. "[If China can take
the lead in seabed mining]{.underline}, [it]{.underline} really [has the
lock]{.underline} [on access to all the key minerals for
the]{.underline} 21st-century [green economy]{.underline}," said Carla
Freeman, senior expert for China at the United States Institute of
Peace. In the case of polymetallic nodules, that means sending robotic
vehicles as deep as 18,000 feet to the vast, dark seafloor, where they
will slowly vacuum up about four inches of seabed, then pump it up to a
ship. The area marked for mining, though less than 1 percent of the
total international seabed, would still be huge. The 30 exploration
contracts cover 540,000 square miles but are concentrated in an expanse
of the Pacific called the Clarion-Clipperton Zone. Spanning 3,100 miles,
it is wider than the contiguous United States and contains up to six
times the cobalt and three times the nickel in all land-based reserves.
In its quest to dominate this industry, [China]{.underline} has [focused
its efforts on the]{.underline} Kingston-based [ISA]{.underline}, housed
in a weathered limestone building overlooking the Caribbean Sea[. [By
wielding influence at an organization where it is by far the most
powerful player]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [the United States is not a
member of the ISA]{.underline} --- [[Beijing]{.mark} has a chance to
[shape]{.mark} international [rules]{.mark} [to its
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This approach is key to]{.mark}
Xi]{.underline} Jinping['s]{.underline} [bid for global]{.underline}
[[preeminence]{.underline}]{.mark}. China's strongest leader in decades,
[[Xi is set on transforming China into a global power]{.mark} that is no
longer beholden to the West]{.underline}, [including by becoming a
maritime power able to compete militarily with the United
States.]{.underline} "If you want to become a global power, you have to
maintain the security of your sea lanes and interests. So becoming a
maritime power is inevitable," said Zhu Feng, executive director of the
China Center for Collaborative Studies of the South China Sea at Nanjing
University. [[The]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has
done]{.mark} [**little** to respond]{.mark} to China's moves in the deep
sea]{.underline}. [It is only an observer at the ISA, meaning [it's at
risk of being **sidelined**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[rules]{.underline}]{.mark} for this
future industry [[are being made]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Unlike China,
[U.S. companies do not have any]{.mark} exploration [contracts with the
ISA]{.mark}]{.underline}, and critics say Washington lacks a clear plan
on how to compete in this new industry. "The logic is that [if we don't
make the rules, they will]{.underline}," said Isaac Kardon, the author
of "China's Law of the Sea" and a senior fellow at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. "These are frontier areas of
international law where there's not an obvious regime, and it's
especially appealing because the U.S. isn't there," he said. "[[It's an
obvious front in]{.underline}]{.mark} whatever this
[[great]{.mark}-[power competition]{.mark}]{.underline} is."

Critical Minerals Export Restrictions Yet Amidst Escalating U.S.-China
Tech War",

[On]{.underline} Tuesday, **[[December]{.mark} 3]{.underline}**, [[China
announced **stringent**]{.mark} **export
[restrictions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on]{.mark} **"dual-use"
[tech]{.mark}**nologies for both civilian and]{.underline} [military
use]{.underline}, [specifically [**targeted** at the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. These [restrictions **double
down**]{.underline} [on previously announced controls]{.underline} on
these metals, [going]{.underline} so far as [to ban shipments of
**antimony**]{.underline}, **[gallium]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[germanium]{.underline}** to the United States. [The new]{.underline}
[[restrictions marked]{.underline}]{.mark} [**several [firsts]{.mark}**
[in the **trade war**]{.mark}]{.underline}---the first time Chinese
critical minerals export restrictions were targeted at the United States
rather than all countries and the first time restrictions on critical
minerals were a direct response to restrictions on advanced
technologies. Critical mineral security is now intrinsically linked to
the escalating tech trade war.

China's announcement comes on the heels of the Biden administration's
crackdown this week on the Chinese semiconductor industry, [the latest
retaliatory]{.underline} action in a **[tit-for-tat]{.underline}**
technology [trade war that has permeated throughout]{.underline} the
[Biden]{.underline} administration. Therefore, this week's announcement
from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce should not be viewed as a
stand-alone development, but rather the latest move in a series of
punitive export controls, justified by both nations as national security
imperatives.

Q1: What actions did the Biden administration take this week to curb
China's access to advanced semiconductors?

A1: This week, [the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}
[issued its most **stringent [crackdown]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on
China]{.mark}'s **semiconductor industry**]{.underline}, [limiting its
ability to develop]{.underline} artificial intelligence
(**[AI]{.underline}**) [for modern military applications]{.underline}
and adopting regulatory reforms to strengthen the enforcement of
previous controls.

[The]{.underline} new [restrictions prohibit the export to China of **24
types of semiconductor**]{.underline} [manufacturing
equipment]{.underline} and three related software tools. They also
prohibit the export of advanced memory chips, chipmaking machinery, and
other semiconductor technologies to 140 Chinese chipmaking companies
including major Chinese chip manufacturers and toolmakers. These
companies were also added to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Entity
List---a blacklist that mandates U.S. firms to apply for export licenses
that will be near impossible to secure. To make the blacklist more
difficult to bypass, [the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} [will apply
the foreign direct product rule]{.underline}, [which will impact
**non-U.S. companies**]{.underline} [that utilize U.S.
chips]{.underline} in their tools [and make it difficult for U.S. firms
to produce]{.underline} these [tools]{.underline} in third countries and
export to China. [The rule is designed to **tighten the
chokehold**]{.underline} [on China's semiconductor
industry]{.underline}, preventing Chinese firms from circumventing the
U.S. export bans by importing chips and machinery with U.S.-designed
components. However, some allied countries may receive exemptions,
affecting the efficacy of the rule.

Q2: How has China retaliated against the United States for this week's
restrictions, and which minerals are impacted?

A2: [[China]{.underline}'s]{.mark} Ministry of Commerce immediately
[[responded by]{.mark} imposing **[export bans]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[on several minerals]{.underline} used in semiconductor [and defense
technology]{.underline} manufacturing to the United States---[[a **rapid
retaliation**]{.underline}]{.mark} by Beijing. [China banned shipments
[of **gallium**, **germanium**, **antimony**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
so-called superhard materials to the United States due to their "dual
military and civilian uses." The export of graphite will now also be
subject to greater scrutiny.

These restrictions come on the heels of the release of an updated
Dual-Use Export Control List by China's Ministry of Commerce. [The list
**expands**]{.underline} [and consolidates a list]{.underline} of items
[deemed to have dual **civilian and military** uses]{.underline}. This
updated framework introduces a unified system and facilitates stricter
oversight to tighten China's export controls. [[This]{.mark}
list]{.underline} not only streamlined the implementation of this week's
export controls but [[leaves]{.mark} the [door open
for]{.mark}]{.underline} China to implement new [export bans on
[other]{.mark} strategic [minerals]{.mark} on the list such as
**tungsten**.]{.underline}

Q3: What impact will these restrictions have on U.S. national security
interests?

A3: [Gallium, germanium, and antimony are [vital]{.mark}]{.underline}
inputs [[for **defense tech**]{.mark}**nologies**.]{.underline} [[China
is making]{.mark} significant [investments]{.mark} in munitions and
acquiring high-end weapons systems]{.underline} and equipment [[at a
rate]{.mark} that is]{.underline} five to **[[six
times]{.underline}]{.mark}** [faster than]{.underline} that of [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. In terms of
strengthening military preparedness, [[China is operating in]{.mark} a
**[wartime posture]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[while the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates is operating in [a **peacetime
posture**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even prior to]{.underline} the new
[restrictions]{.underline}, [the U.S. **d**efense **i**ndustrial
**b**ase]{.underline} [lacked the capacity]{.underline} and surge
capabilities [to meet defense technology production]{.underline} needs.
[[Bans on vital mineral inputs]{.underline}]{.mark} [will]{.underline}
only further [[allow China to **outpace**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} in building these
capabilities.

[One example]{.underline} of how restrictions undermine U.S. national
[security is **antimony trade**]{.underline}. Antimony has a number of
defense technology-use cases. China is the world's leading producer of
antimony, accounting for 48 percent of global production and 63 percent
of U.S. antimony imports. [The United States has no
domestic]{.underline} antimony [production]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} severely [limited stockpiles]{.underline}. Since
antimony export restrictions were imposed in September 2024, antimony
shipments from China dropped 97 percent while prices rose 200 percent.
Elevating export controls from restrictions to a ban may not make a
material difference in the antimony market considering U.S. firms have
already had to adapt to the reality of an antimony supply gap over the
last three months. By banning antimony exports and specifically
targeting the U.S. market, [[Beijing sends a]{.mark} **strong
[message]{.mark}**]{.underline} to Washington [that [it is not afraid
to]{.mark} **further [escalate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the trade
war]{.underline} by cutting off the United States from critical minerals
needed for strategic industries.

Q4: What are the economic security implications of the new
res[t]{.mark}ricti[o]{.mark}ns?

A4: [Gallium and germanium are [the two **most vital
minerals**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to develop]{.underline}]{.mark} the
next generation of advanced [[chips]{.underline}]{.mark}. Gallium and
germanium are increasingly being [chosen over traditional
silicon]{.underline} for high-performance chips used in defense
applications due to their properties that boost device performance,
speed, and energy efficiency. The future of semiconductors for defense
applications depends on reliable supplies of high-purity gallium and
germanium. A U.S. Geological Survey report last month estimated that [a
total [export ban]{.mark}]{.underline} on gallium and germanium [could
[result in]{.mark} a **\$[3.4 billion]{.mark}** [loss]{.mark} in
GDP]{.underline} for the U.S. economy.

[Graphite]{.underline} exports are [not banned entirely]{.underline},
[but Beijing is **further tightening**]{.underline} the
[restrictions]{.underline} it first imposed in 2023. This poses a
significant challenge to the United States. [China accounts for 77
percent of natural graphite production]{.underline}, [over 95 percent of
synthetic graphite]{.underline} production, [and]{.underline} nearly
[100 percent of graphite refining]{.underline}. The United States,
meanwhile, contains less than 1 percent of the world's graphite reserves
and is 100 percent import reliant. Synthetic graphite manufacturing
projects are in the pipeline, but capacity remains limited.

[[Graphite is]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} input [for
the]{.mark}]{.underline} electric vehicle
(**[[EV]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[industry]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Gasoline and diesel vehicles do not require any graphite---but EVs
require an average of 136 pounds of graphite. [The EV industry is
[important for the **U.S. econ**]{.mark}**omy**]{.underline}. In June
2024, [domestic automotive manufacturing jobs reached a 34-year
high]{.underline}. The Inflation Reduction Act helped mobilize \$114
billion in private sector investments in the EV ecosystem, which is
expected to generate 99,600 jobs. Without graphite, there will be no EV
industry.

**[protracted conflict]{.underline}**, a scenario not lost on Beijing or
Moscow, which continue to strengthen their anti-Western alliance.5
[[Yet]{.mark} the [US has]{.mark} not broken China's]{.underline} choke
hold on US military munitions and defense platforms, despite ample
evidence of acute [**[supply]{.mark}-chain**
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} and a shrinking window to address
them.

What is not discussed openly, but is probably widely known in China, is
the US industrial base's [[dependency]{.mark} on Taiwan
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} supplying the military with **[[critical
materials]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as semiconductors. This
dependency, contrary to what some may believe, does not strengthen
deterrence of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan via a "silicon shield"
defense.6 Indeed, it [[weakens **deterrence**]{.underline}]{.mark},
creating "non-deterrence," [as the US [cannot build]{.mark}]{.underline}
many military platforms and [[weapons without]{.underline}]{.mark}
access to [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}.7 Moreover, as the American
Enterprise Institute's Chris Miller has noted, [this]{.underline}
"**[silicon shield]{.underline}**" "[[**emboldens China** to
attack]{.underline}]{.mark}, by making China think that the U.S. is less
likely to come to Taiwan's aid."8

Therefore, [to bolster **deterrence** and]{.underline} its [ability to
prosecute a long war]{.underline}, [America [must
ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} it can resupply its defenses even if its
**[[supply lines]{.underline}]{.mark}** to Taiwan and China are severed.
[[Failing]{.underline}]{.mark} to do so may [[signal]{.mark} that the
[US]{.mark} is **[not ready]{.mark}**]{.underline} for a protracted
conflict. As a Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies report aptly
stated, "Potential [[adversaries]{.mark} might [decide]{.mark} that a
[nation]{.mark}]{.underline} that lacked the capacity to sustain
protracted offensive operations also **[[lacked]{.mark} political
[resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}**."9

Simply put, the American industrial base cannot sustain the United
States' ability to fight and win a protracted war against China.10 China
undoubtedly understands this, which may play into its strategy of
coercing Taiwan. By [[failing]{.mark} to **create [resilience]{.mark}**
in]{.underline} its [supply chains]{.underline}, the United States has,
in effect, [[turned Taiwan into a]{.mark} **valuable [hostage]{.mark}**,
through which China can exact]{.underline} constant military and
economic **[concessions]{.underline}** from the United States. This
hostage will allow China to disrupt America's war-making capacity just
when we need it most. Most importantly, China can hold Taiwan hostage
for any number of global outcomes it desires, especially the dropping of
US export restrictions. Accepting Taiwan's treatment as a hostage
continues the United States' trend of not wanting to rock the boat too
heavily in its relations with China.11

The Biden administration has made gestures acknowledging this crucial
issue, particularly with its 2021 Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force,
the CHIPS and Science Act, its most recent defense industrial base
report, and the commerce secretary's December 2023 speech at the Reagan
National Defense Forum on the need for more funding to help oversee
export controls.12 [[Despite]{.mark} the **strong
[rhetoric]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the actual problem-solving is clouded
by social **[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as childcare centers
at new manufacturing locations, environmental permitting, clean energy
goals, an isolationist focus on "Buy America," and a timeline that
[[views]{.mark} this [problem over **decades rather than

And yet [**[China]{.mark}** is [in]{.mark} the [midst of]{.mark} a

[stockpile]{.mark} will **[grow]{.mark}** from **400** warheads today
[to **1,500**]{.mark} warheads [by 2035]{.mark}]{.underline}. The report
also warns that, [while China [**nominally** adheres to]{.mark} a
"**[n]{.mark}**]{.underline}o **[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst

probably [would]{.mark}]{.underline} ... [**consider** [nuc]{.mark}lear
use [to]{.mark} restore **[deter]{.mark}rence**]{.underline} if a
conventional military defeat gravely threatened PRC survival." [Given
that a **failed** invasion of **Taiwan** could threaten the
CCP]{.underline}'s power, [it's **reasonable** to worry that China could
**[up]{.mark} the [ante]{.mark}**]{.underline} by going nuclear.

The risk of nuclear escalation is all the greater because, as a senior
U.S. admiral explained to me, it would be difficult for the United
States to win a war over Taiwan by attacking only Chinese ships at sea
and Chinese aircraft in the skies. [The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [could find itself
**[compelled]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as a matter of military necessity,
[[to attack **bases**]{.mark} in **China**. [China]{.mark}]{.underline},
in turn, [could [strike]{.mark} U.S. [**bases** in Japan]{.mark}, South
Korea]{.underline}, the Philippines, Guam, [[even
**Hawaii**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the West Coast.

Culver, the former intelligence officer, told me, "[[Even if]{.mark}
Beijing [announced]{.mark}]{.underline} that its retaliatory
[[strikes]{.underline}]{.mark} against Hawaii or the West Coast of the
U.S. [were **[conventional]{.mark}**ly armed, it would [risk

[president **refuse to launch** in]{.mark} the **[30

[[When two **nuclear**]{.mark}-armed [powers
**attack**]{.mark}]{.underline} each other's territory, [it would be
[**difficult** to keep]{.mark} the [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}
contained at a **[[conventional]{.underline}]{.mark}** level. Both
sides, admittedly, would have an incentive to avoid "mutual assured
destruction," but [[countries]{.mark} often [act
**rashly**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the heat of battle, particularly
after they have suffered significant casualties and feel the need to
ensure that their troops did not die in vain.

For a sense of how destructive a war with China could be, read "2034: A
Novel of the Next World War" by retired Adm. James Stavridis, a former
supreme allied commander in Europe, and Marine combat veteran Elliot
Ackerman. [[It ends]{.underline}]{.mark} --- spoiler alert --- [[with
**nuclear devastation**]{.mark} in both countries]{.underline}.

Stavridis told me: "[If the U.S. and China]{.underline} manage to

[[In the **race**]{.mark} against the US [for]{.mark} global **[tech
supremacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[China has]{.mark} the [**upper
hand** in]{.mark} at least one critical area]{.underline}: **[[rare
earths]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The term refers to a group of 17 elements
[[required to make **tech**]{.mark} products ranging from
**semiconductors** to industrial **magnets**]{.underline} and some solar
panels --- [the **same** items [embroiled in the]{.mark} US-China
**[trade war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For more than a year, Beijing has
slowly been tightening its grip on critical minerals and rare earths.
[In December, [China **banned**]{.mark} the [export
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a range of [**[r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth**
[processing]{.mark} technologies]{.underline}. Last month, China further
tightened its grip on the sector. Citing resource protection and
national security, Beijing [[made it **mandatory**]{.mark} for exporters
[to **track**]{.mark} how rare earth [mineral]{.mark}s are
[use]{.mark}d]{.underline} in supply chains. Now, [there are
**[fears]{.mark}** that China [could tighten]{.mark}]{.underline} the
global rare earths [supply chain **even [more]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Here\'s what you need to know about rare earths, what makes them so
valuable, and how they play into the tech war between the US and China.
China\'s rare earth dominance China has long dominated the rare earths
market due to supply, low labor costs, and lax environmental standards.
The country [[produces **60%** of]{.mark} the
[world]{.mark}\'s]{.underline} rare earth mineral [[supply]{.mark}
and]{.underline} accounts for [[**90%** of]{.mark} global refined
**[output]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The late **Deng
Xiaoping**]{.underline} --- the Chinese leader who spearheaded the
country\'s economic reforms in 1978 --- [recognized their strategic
importance]{.underline} in 1992, [saying, \"**[The Middle East has
oil]{.mark}, [China has rare earths]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\" Under the
new regulations introduced last month, [China\'s **rare earth**
resource**s** now belong to the **state**]{.underline}. Two
Canadian-owned rare earth refineries in China are also being acquired by
state-owned companies. This is not the first time Beijing has placed
restrictions on rare earths. In 2010, China imposed strict rare earth
quotas, citing environmental concerns and resource preservation. The
move sent prices up sharply and prompted the US, the European Union, and
Japan to file a complaint against China for unfair trade practices at
the World Trade Organization. China lost the case and lifted exported
quotas in 2015. Various [[countries **tri**]{.mark}**ed** [to
**diversify**]{.mark} their rare earth supply chains]{.underline} in the
wake of China\'s quotas in the 2010s, [but [success]{.mark} has been
**[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline} due to the high cost of investment and
environmental concerns. There are renewed efforts to boost global
production in the face of rising tensions. In 2022, the US Department of
Defense awarded \$45 million to MP Materials for rare earth oxide
processing, and in 2023, it awarded over \$288 million to Lynas USA to
set up commercial-scale rare earth oxide production facilities. How is
China leveraging rare earths? [Beijing\'s [moves to **control**]{.mark}
critical minerals]{.underline} and rare earths
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} part of [[a **toolbox**]{.mark} Beijing has
developed over the last **four years**]{.underline}, Rick Waters, the
managing director of Eurasia Group\'s China practice, said at a press
briefing. During President Donald Trump\'s first term, the US and China
slapped retaliatory tariffs on each other. However, [China has [**less
leverage** in]{.mark} a [tariff fight because it **exports**
more]{.mark}]{.underline} to the US [[than it **imports**]{.mark}, so it
[came up with]{.mark}]{.underline} another regulatory framework --- this
one involving **[[rare earths]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- that [it can
use in a trade **dispute**]{.underline}. \"They\'re experimenting with
its use, and I think, in a way, they could go further --- if they
perceive they need to,\" said Waters. [[**Any** further
tightening]{.mark} of **rare earth** supplies]{.underline} --- which are
a subset under critical minerals --- [could [leave]{.mark} the [US
**vulnerable** to]{.mark} **supply [shocks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
\"China has cornered the market for processing and refining of key
critical minerals, leaving the US and our allies and partners vulnerable
to supply chain shocks and undermining economic and national security,\"
the White House said in a statement in September. What do the
restrictions on rare earths mean for TSMC and Nvidia? [China\'s control
over **rare earths** could [weigh **heavily**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the trade war between Washington and Beijing, [with **[chips]{.mark}**
in the center]{.underline} of the conflict. [Chips are found in
**everything** from **[computers]{.mark}** to]{.underline} cell phones,
cars, and **[[defense]{.mark} equipment]{.underline}**. Taiwan dominates
the market, producing over 60% of the world\'s chips and over 90% of the
most advanced ones. One company --- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company --- is responsible for most of the output and is the key
supplier to AI chip giant Nvidia, which is in the thick of the tech
rivalry. The US has already moved to block the export of advanced chips
and chipmaking equipment to China. [If the trade tiff
**escalates**]{.underline} --- such as in the form of higher tariffs ---
[China could pull its **rare earth card**]{.underline}, Oxford Economics
wrote in a report published in July. \"[China\'s [dominance in]{.mark}
the **[battery]{.mark}** supply chain]{.underline} accords policymakers
with leverage to withhold industry-specific inputs from Western
manufacturers, which [could prove **[inflationary]{.mark}** and
**[economically disruptive]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" wrote Louise Loo,
the lead economist for Greater China at Oxford Economics. This could
involve further controls on critical commodity exports, particularly in
rare earth minerals, Loo added. As happened with China\'s rare earth
export curbs in 2010, [**[prices]{.mark}** are **likely to
[spike]{.mark}** if supply is tightened]{.underline}, so any prolonged
supply crunch could drive up inflation for end products. The tech Cold
War [The US and China\'s]{.underline} moves to outmaneuver each other in
the [**tech race** have some analysts [draw]{.mark}ing
**[parallel]{.mark}s** [to]{.mark} the **[Cold
War]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Zongyuan Zoe Liu, a senior fellow for China
studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Business Insider the
idea that the US ought to out-compete China and prevent the nation from
developing advanced chips plays into a \"bigger power competition
narrative.\" She said the tensions are similar, though not identical, to
the tensions between the US and Soviet Union that began after the end of
World War II. As Bloomberg reported last month, the US is considering
limiting export licenses for both Nvidia and AMD chips in an unfolding
trade war that has also hit several sensitive industries, including
electric vehicles, batteries, and some solar panels. The US imposed
similar trade limits, embargoes, and economic sanctions on the Soviet
Union, North Korea, China, and North Vietnam during the Cold War. \"I
think [[the **heart**]{.mark} of the issue [is]{.mark} concern about
[how China]{.mark} will [use **AI chips** for **military**]{.mark}
**applications** and **surveillance**]{.underline},\" Chris Tang, a UCLA
professor and expert in global supply chain management and the impact of
regulatory policies, told BI. \"It\'s a different type of Cold War.\"
Beyond a tense relationship, the dynamics between the US and China are
also creating parallel systems, with the US and its allies on one side,
and China and its allies on the other, Nick Vyas, the founding director
of USC Marshall\'s Randall R. Kendrick Global Supply Chain Institute,
told BI. Vyas said he\'s concerned [the **[tension]{.mark}** could
[escalate]{.mark} from this new Cold War [to]{.mark} a **[hot]{.mark}

[Critical [minerals undergird great power **competition**]{.mark} and
war]{.underline}. These nonfuel minerals and [mineral materials are
[vi**tal** to]{.mark} countries' **[d]{.mark}**efense
**[i]{.mark}**ndustrial **[b]{.mark}**ase[s]{.mark}]{.underline},
[enabling the production of **military platforms**]{.underline} like
tanks as well as munitions and artillery shells. Therefore, [mineral
supplies can help [**sustain** military power]{.mark}]{.underline},
[while mineral [shortages]{.mark} can severely **[undermine
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, the Allied powers' control of
most of the world's minerals before World War II proved instrumental in
their eventual victory over the Axis powers.

Minerals remain important for military power today. Iron is used in
steel, which is necessary for military components like ship hulls and
tank armor. Copper is commonly used in munitions such as bullets and
artillery shells. And [**lithium** and **other minerals** have gained
further **relevance** due to their [use in new]{.mark} energy
**[tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline}, like high-capacity batteries.
The U.S. Army aims to field an entirely electric non-tactical light-duty
vehicle fleet by 2027, and the army's climate strategy emphasizes
installing battery storage systems and generating renewable electricity
on its bases.

Yet, [the **importance** of these minerals also makes them [a
**dangerous vulnerability** if]{.mark} their [**supply chains** are
**not secure**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and unfortunately, [[the **U.S.**
and]{.mark} other **[NATO]{.mark}** militaries [rely
on]{.mark}]{.underline} defense industrial bases with
[**[vulnerable]{.mark}** mineral supply [chains]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Given their limited domestic mineral production, both [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and **Europe** [depend
**heavily** on]{.mark} mineral [imports]{.mark}]{.underline}, including
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} rival powers like
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which supplies minerals such as
graphite, rare earth elements, and other battery minerals, [[and
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which provides aluminum, nickel, and
titanium. In June 2023, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned
the alliance to avoid becoming overdependent on Chinese minerals, just
as many NATO countries previously became overdependent on Russian gas.
Additionally, [the [U.S.]{.mark} government [holds **limited**]{.mark}
mineral [inventories in its **N**]{.mark}ational **[D]{.mark}**efense
**[S]{.mark}**tockpile]{.underline}, while the European Union (EU) has
walked back its plans to develop a centralized mineral stockpile.

[Mineral [supply chain risks are **rising**]{.mark}]{.underline} as the
adoption of renewable energy technology increases mineral demand and as
the rearmament efforts of the U.S. and allied militaries in support of
Ukraine use more minerals. Coupled with limited production and
stockpiles, the [U.S. and other NATO militaries face three **serious
risks** that could lead to mineral **shortages**]{.underline}: foreign
export controls; rising military demand amid great power competition,
including the possibility of a U.S.-China conflict; and disrupted
sea-lanes. The United States and other NATO countries must act now to
address these supply chain risks.

The Role of Minerals in World War II

The present mineral vulnerability of the United States and NATO
contrasts with U.S. mineral dominance in a different period of great
power competition: before and during World War II. According to
geologist Charles K. Leith, the United States was "the world's greatest
owner, producer, seller and consumer of minerals" in 1938, controlling
major mineral resources across Canada, Central America, and South
America. Notably, the United States and the British Empire together
controlled about 75 percent of global mineral supplies. The United
States did, however, lack a substantial mineral stockpile before the
war, although the 1939 Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act
formally established a stockpiling plan with funding. Regardless, the
United States in this period was a mineral powerhouse.

Despite the United States' strong mineral position, the U.S. military
experienced supply constraints before and during the war. First, the
country faced export controls that reduced its access to foreign
minerals. Before the war, for instance, Germany placed export
restrictions on certain mineral products, such as copper sulfate.
Interestingly, the United States also faced export controls from its
geopolitical partners. In October 1940, Canada instituted a copper
export ban that applied to the United States, except under certain
conditions, like U.S. entities fulfilling munitions contracts for Allied
countries.

At the same time, soaring military demand caused mineral shortages as
production failed to keep pace with requirements. Amid the U.S. military
buildup from 1940 to 1941, aluminum production, which was important for
manufacturing aircraft, increased by 50 percent, but it still failed to
meet the demand from planned aircraft manufacturing output. After the
United States entered the war, increased manufacturing of bullets and
artillery shells caused supply issues for copper, while heightened
defense production overall triggered shortages of manganese, nickel,
tin, and zinc.

During the war, U.S. mineral imports also faced disruption from
contested sea-lanes. Axis submarine warfare impacted U.S. mineral
imports from Asia, the Caribbean, and South America. For example,
submarines sank South American bauxite cargoes headed to U.S. aluminum
plants. Mineral imports from the western hemisphere that had previously
been "considered reasonably safe, even in war," as the U.S. Bureau of
Mines' Elmer W. Pehrson noted, were threatened. Despite the submarine
threat, large volumes of minerals could still be imported, but those
imports---along with domestic production---were insufficient to meet
demand.

Similar Mineral Risks Today, but From a Weaker Position

Compared with the strong mineral position of the United States and its
partners in great power competition before and during World War II, [the
**U.S.** military and **NATO** are in a **far weaker**
position]{.underline} today (see figure 1).

\<\<FIGURE 1 OMITTED\>\>

The United States today relies on a greater share of mineral imports to
meet domestic consumption, indicating a relative decline in U.S. mineral
production compared with consumption. For some minerals, U.S. production
has even stopped completely. The U.S. supply of niobium, which is used
in steel and superalloys, "has been a concern during every national
military emergency since World War I," according to the U.S. Geological
Survey, but the element has not been mined in the United States since
1959.

Mineral inventories in the U.S. National Defense Stockpile have also
dwindled since the 1950s, hindering the stockpile's ability to fully
satisfy mineral demand for key U.S. sectors during a potential national
emergency, such as a U.S.-China conflict. As of March 2023, the value of
stockpile inventories was \$912.3 million, just 1.2 percent of the
stockpile's 1962 value of approximately \$77.1 billion (adjusted for
inflation). In 2023, the Department of Defense estimated that the U.S.
military in "base case" national emergency scenarios, such as a
large-scale conventional U.S.-China conflict, would have shortfalls in
sixty-nine materials. The current stockpile would cover only about 40
percent of the military's projected shortfalls in a one-year conflict
followed by three years of recovery and replenishment.

Other NATO countries and partners have limited mineral production and
stockpiles, too. The EU imports between 75 and 100 percent of most
metals it consumes, and neither the union nor its member states have
mineral stockpiles---though the EU is now facilitating the joint
purchasing of minerals by interested firms and member-states. Canada
also does not have such a stockpile, and the United Kingdom discontinued
its facility in 1984. The risks of limited---or nonexistent---strategic
stockpiles became apparent during the 2021 global energy crisis, when
the United Kingdom had enough natural gas stored to last only four to
five winter days. For NATO countries generally, the situation is no
better for the minerals critical for their militaries.

Today, [the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and]{.mark} its [partners face
**risks** to]{.mark} their **[critical mineral]{.mark}** supply
[chains]{.mark} just [as]{.mark} their [militaries' **mineral
demand**]{.mark} is **[ris]{.mark}ing**. These risks [pose **greater
consequences** now]{.mark}, as compared to]{.underline} before and
during **[World War II]{.underline}**, given NATO countries' weaker
mineral positions and China's mineral dominance. The three main risks
could lead to mineral shortages: foreign export controls; rising
military demand amid great power competition, including a possible
U.S.-China conflict; and disrupted sea-lanes.

First, [foreign export controls are an **urgent** concern]{.underline}.
China imposed a de facto ban on exporting graphite to Sweden in 2021 and
placed restrictions on exporting gallium, germanium, and graphite to all
countries in late 2023. [[Most **U.S. imports**]{.mark} of these
minerals come [from **China**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Chinese gallium
and germanium exports have indeed fallen significantly. In December
2023, Beijing banned the export of technology for making rare earth
magnets. Conceivably, [China could [impose **export controls** on
**other** minerals]{.mark} that [the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} other [**NATO** countries
import]{.mark}]{.underline} from China, like bismuth, tantalum, and rare
earth elements.

Other countries, such as [[Russia, could **also** impose]{.mark} export
[controls t]{.mark}hat would [impact **NATO**]{.mark} members' mineral
imports]{.underline}. A 2023 report by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development found that Argentina, China, India,
Kazakhstan, Russia, and Vietnam imposed the most new export restrictions
on critical raw materials from 2009 to 2020. Throughout the
Russia-Ukraine war, Russia has imposed export bans on a variety of
mineral products, too, including, most recently, precious metal waste
and scrap.

The second risk stems from increased allied production of defense
platforms and munitions that contain minerals. This increased production
is largely to replenish stocks of depleted matériel sent to support
Ukraine in the Russia-Ukraine war. A 2023 report from the Hague Centre
for Strategic Studies found that European countries face high or very
high supply risks for several critical minerals with military
applications, including aluminum, beryllium, chromium, copper, and
natural graphite for towed artillery, which Ukraine heavily relies on.

The United States faces similar mineral shortage risks from its efforts
to supply Ukraine militarily. The United States produced 28,000
155-millimeter artillery shells, which are made of various minerals, per
month in 2023 but expects to produce 100,000 shells per month by the end
of 2025. While the U.S. military has not released recent mineral
consumption figures, previous periods of heightened U.S. military
production increased mineral demand. During U.S. military mobilization
in 1941, for instance, Pehrson wrote that U.S. mineral consumption
"exceeded all previous records" and "reflected the rapid rate at which
the United States was mobilizing for war."

[[In a possible **U.S.-China** conflict, the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and]{.mark} other [NATO countries]{.mark} would [face]{.mark}
increased [**risks** of **mineral shortages**]{.mark}]{.underline}, too.
In war games simulating a U.S.-China conflict over Taiwan, the Center
for Strategic and International Studies found that the U.S. military
used 5,000 long-range missiles in the first three weeks of combat, which
would increase demand for minerals used in missiles, such as steel
alloys. While projecting mineral consumption in a U.S.-China conflict is
difficult given limited open-source information on the material
composition of defense platforms and munitions, the high rates of
matériel attrition in the Russia-Ukraine war demonstrate how wartime
demands often exceed expectations and available supply.

Innovate, or be Crushed by China";

Many rare earths are also geochemically rare --- they can only be mined
in a handful of countries. This is simply down to Mother Nature being a
**[[tempestuous]{.underline}]{.mark}** so-and-so: Some countries have
deposits of **[[rare earths]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and some don't.
[This [results in]{.mark} **massively [skewed]{.mark}**
[production]{.mark} (China]{.underline} famously [produces 97% of the
world's rare earth metals), [and]{.mark}]{.underline}, as you can
imagine, [a lot of **national security** and **[geopolitical
troubles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, too. It doesn't stop with rare earths,
either: Many other important elements, such as platinum, are only
available from one or two mines in the entire world. If South Africa
sustained a huge earthquake --- or was on the receiving end of a
thermonuclear bomb, perhaps --- the world's supply of platinum would
literally dry up over night. The continued existence of technologies
that rely on platinum, like car exhaust catalytic converters and fuel
cells, would be unlikely. If geochemistry and politics weren't enough,
though, we even have to factor in ethical concerns: Just like
blood/conflict diamonds --- diamonds that originate from war-torn
African nations, where forced labor is used and the proceeds go towards
buying more weapons for the warlord --- some rare metals could be
considered "blood metals." Tantalum, an element that's used to make the
capacitors found in almost every modern computer, is extracted from
coltan --- and the world's second largest producer of coltan is the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the home of the bloodiest wars since
World War II. Not only do the proceeds from coltan exports get spent on
weapons, but the main focus of the wars were the stretches of land rich
in diamonds and coltan. Also along the same humanist vein, it's
important to note that extracting these rare elements is usually a very
expensive and disruptive activity. Indium, probably the single most
important element for the manufacture of LCDs and touchscreens, is
recovered in minute quantities as a byproduct of zinc extraction. You
can't just set up an indium plant; you have to produce zinc in huge
quantities, find buyers and arrange transport for that zinc, and then go
to town on producing indium. In short, extracting rare elements is
generally a very intensive task that is likely to disrupt or destroy
existing settlements and businesses. [[The **doomsday**
event]{.underline}]{.mark} that everyone is praying will never come to
pass, but which every Western nation is currently planning for,
[[is]{.mark} the]{.underline} eventual [**[cut-off]{.mark}** of Chinese
rare earth [exports]{.mark}]{.underline}. Last year, 97% of the world's
rare earth metals were produced in China --- but over the last few
years, the Chinese government has been shutting down mines, ostensibly
to save what resources it has, and also reducing the amount of rare
earth that can be exported. Last year, China produced some 130,000 tons
of rare earths, but export restrictions meant that only 35,000 tons were
sent to other countries. As a result, [demand]{.underline} outside China
now [outstrips supply]{.underline} by some 40,000 tons per year, and ---
as expected --- [many [countries are]{.mark}]{.underline} now
[[stockpiling]{.mark} the reserves]{.underline} that [they
have]{.underline}. [China owns the world\'s rare earth
deposits]{.underline} Almost every Western country is now digging around
in their backyard for rare earth-rich mud and sand, but [[it'll]{.mark}
probably [be **too little too late**]{.mark} --- and anyway, [due to
geochemistry, there's **no guarantee**]{.mark} that [explorers]{.mark}
and assayers [will find]{.mark} what they're looking for]{.underline}.
The price of rare earths are already going up, and so are the
non-Chinese-made gadgets and gizmos that use them. Exacerbating the
issue yet further, [[as **tech**]{.mark}nology [grows]{.mark} more
[advanced]{.mark}, our [**reliance** on]{.mark}]{.underline} the strange
and magical properties of [**[r]{.mark}**are
**[e]{.mark}**arth**[s]{.mark}** **[increases]{.mark}** --- and
China]{.underline}, with the world's largest workforce and a fire hose
of rare earths, [is]{.underline} perfectly [poised to become the
only]{.underline} real [producer]{.underline} of solar power
photovoltaic cells, computer chips, and more. [In short, China has the
world]{.underline} by the short hairs, [and when [combined with a
**hotting**]{.mark}**-up [cyber front]{.mark}**[, it's not hard to
see]{.mark} how [this]{.mark} situation might **[devolve into World War
III]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The alternate, ecological point of view, is
that we're simply living beyond the planet's means. Either way,
strategic and logistic planning to make the most of scarce metals and
minerals is now one of the most important tasks that face governments
and corporations. Even if large rare earth deposits are found soon, or
we start recycling our gadgets in a big way, the only real solution is
to somehow lessen our reliance on a finite resource. Just like oil and
energy, this will probably require drastic technological leaps. Instead
of reducing the amount of tantalum used in capacitors, or indium in LCD
displays, we will probably have to discover completely different ways of
storing energy or displaying images. My money's on graphene.

[[**Critical materials** play a vital role in]{.mark} powering modern
technologies, from [**renewable e**nergy]{.mark} systems]{.underline}
and electric vehicles [to]{.underline} advanced electronics
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[national defense]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
However, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [faces challenges]{.mark}
in securing a reliable supply of these materials, which are essential
for its economic competitiveness and national security]{.underline}.
These materials include metals such as lithium, cobalt, rare earth
elements, and graphite. They are essential for the manufacturing of
high-tech products like batteries, semiconductors, magnets, and
catalysts. [With the increasing demand for electric vehicles, renewable
energy systems, and advanced electronics, the United States heavily
relies on critical materials to drive innovation and maintain its global
economic competitiveness. The United States faces several
challenges]{.underline} in securing a stable supply of critical
materials. One major challenge is the concentration of production in a
few countries, primarily China. China dominates the global supply chain
of critical materials, accounting for a significant share of mining,
processing, and refining capacity. [This [dependency raises concerns
about]{.mark} supply [disruptions, **geopolitical risks**, and]{.mark}
market [manipulation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This problem is complex requiring a multi-pronged approach to develop
the best path forward. [[Attention from multiple agencies with private
sector involvement is needed]{.underline}]{.mark} to address issues
including resource definition, recovery technology development,
recycling technologies, international relations, supply chain resilience
and improvements and, domestic resource development policies[. A
successful outcome will necessitate a diverse approach, strong
collaborations, exchange of information and practices, and perhaps most
importantly, persistence.]{.underline}

[Ensuring a reliable and sustainable supply of these materials is
essential for the country\'s economic growth, technological advancement,
and national security]{.underline}. [[By investing in]{.mark} domestic
[production]{.mark}, promoting responsible sourcing, [and
fostering]{.mark} international [collaborations, the United States aims
to strengthen its critical materials supply chains]{.mark}. These
efforts will contribute to a more resilient and secure future, enabling
the United States to maintain its position as a global leader in
innovation and technology.]{.underline} This overview explores the issue
of critical materials supply chains in the United States, examining the
importance of these materials, the challenges associated with their
supply, efforts being made to address the issue, and research avenues.
[America's Arctic in the critical mineral arena Arctic regions share
many attributes that inspire and challenge resource development.
**[Developing]{.mark} and sharing [Arctic-friendly technologies and
solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [across international borders, [will
strengthen Arctic relations]{.mark}, build Arctic economies, help
disadvantaged communities [**and strengthen the nations critical mineral
supply** **chain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Alaska is proud to participate
alongside its Arctic colleagues in developing new technologies to meet
this challenge.

Alaska's complex geological history has led to formation of a wide array
of mineral deposit types containing commodities many list as critical.
Alaska either has, is, or could produce almost all of the commodities on
the US Geological Survey's 2022 list of critical minerals. Alaska is the
largest producer of zinc in the nation, contains the nation's largest
graphite deposit, is the state with the only domestic tin resources and,
has been a producer of critical minerals in times of national need, e.g.
During WWII Alaska contributed tin, PGE's, chrome, tungsten and antimony
for the war effort. Most of the commodities produced to support the war
effort have not been significantly produced since, and the resources
remain in place, creating a ripe environment for meeting the nations
need for these critical minerals. Alaska is large in the domestic
context, being about one fifth of the size of the contiguous states.
Millions of acres of land selected by native corporations and the state
were selected based on mineral potential. These, along with open federal
lands provide almost half of Alaska's 400 million acres open to mineral
development. Alaska has an active resource development industry known
for rigorous environmental and social justice practices. The University
of Alaska is uniquely positioned to assist the national need for a
stable critical minerals supply chain, with many of the necessary
components to be a center of critical minerals research already in
place, including the Mining Engineering and Mineral Processing, Geology,
Economics and Chemistry departments, the Mineral Industry Research
Laboratory, the unmanned aircraft program, the Geophysical Institute,
the Institute of Northern Engineering, a strong relationship with the
mineral industry, a strong state geological survey, and strong State of
Alaska support for critical mineral research. Centered in the heart of
Alaska's mineral industry, the University of Alaska's planned Alaska
Critical Mineral Research Center creates potential broad research areas
to focus on to facilitate Alaskan, American, and Arctic critical mineral
production.

What is important depends on your perspective

[The perception of what constitutes a critical material is contingent
upon one\'s perspective]{.underline}. Different industries and regions
have distinct supply chains and material requirements. For instance,
what is considered critical for a solar installation company in one
country may not be for a vehicle manufacturer in another. Divergent
perspectives arise from variations in supply chains and material needs.
In the case of a thin-film solar panel manufacturer, concern might
involve securing a stable supply of minerals like indium or tellurium.
Conversely, a vehicle manufacturer might prioritize access to critical
materials like lithium and cobalt, which are indispensable for the
production of electric vehicle batteries. Engaging with industry to
determine research needs is crucial to maximize research investment
impacts. Further, material criticality is dynamic. [A material that is
critical today may not be in the near future. Technological advancements
play a crucial role in changing mineral criticality.]{.underline} For
instance, the discovery of the Bayer process in 1888 revolutionized the
extraction of aluminum from bauxite, significantly increasing its
availability. Geopolitical forces also influence mineral criticality, as
shifts in trade relationships, conflicts, and policy changes can impact
the accessibility of certain minerals. [As technologies advance and new
applications emerge, the demand for certain minerals may increase or
decrease, leading to shifts in their criticality over time. Potential
for rapidly changing demand dynamics creates risk for mineral
developers, disincentive to investment, and negatively impacts supply of
these minerals.]{.underline}

Supply chains

**[The [supply chains for]{.mark} critical [materials]{.mark} in the
United States [face potential bottlenecks]{.mark} that extend beyond
domestic mining]{.underline}**. Even if the United States enhances its
domestic mining operations, challenges are present in other stages of
the supply chain. These include processing, refining, and manufacturing,
which are equally critical for a secure and reliable supply of critical
materials. The case of copper is illustrative. The top four countries in
terms of identified reserves of copper are Chile, Australia, Peru and
Russia which collectively account for 49% of global reserves. The top
four countries in terms of primary mine production are Chile, Congo
(Kinshasa), Peru, and China which collectively account for 52% of
primary mine production. However, at the refining stage, the top four
countries of China, Chile, Congo (Kinshasa), and Japan collectively
account for 63% of refined production, with China alone representing 42%
of global refining. In terms of processing and refining, the United
States relies heavily on foreign countries for these crucial steps.
Limited domestic processing facilities and expertise ensure foreign
transformation of raw materials into usable forms. [[Investing
in]{.mark} domestic or allied [processing capabilities will reduce
dependence]{.mark} on foreign processing and mitigate potential
disruptions]{.underline}. Engaging with processing facilities in allied
countries to expand processing infrastructure and increase metal
recovery in those facilities can strengthen the supply chain and reduce
supply-chain vulnerability.

Increasing Domestic supply

[Geologic processes often concentrate several metals of economic
interest together in a single deposit]{.underline}. Many critical
minerals are produced as by-products in the extraction, processing, and
refining of other, more economically significant metals. For example,
germanium and indium are mostly produced as a by-product of zinc;
gallium a by-product of aluminum, and tellurium is a by-product of
copper production. Because the global demand of some critical minerals
is small, mines dedicated exclusively to these metals would not be
economically sufficient to warrant exploration. Those commodities will
still need to be produced as co-products or by-products from production
of more economically significant metals.

[[Baseline]{.mark} geological, geophysical and geochemical [data is
being acquired]{.mark}]{.underline} by the University of Alaska, the
Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys (DGGS) and the
United States Geological Survey (USGS) through programs like the
Department of Energy's (DOE) CORE-CM, and the USGS's Earth MRI. [These
programs are producing the modern digital baseline data of our
sedimentary basins and crystalline rocks that industry uses to evaluate
those regions for critical mineral resource]{.underline}s. [**[Much
remains to be done]{.mark}**, and these programs need to continue until
domestic data coverage is complete.]{.underline} [[Increasing the speed
and reducing the cost of data collection]{.mark} through automation [may
be achieved]{.mark} through drone based-surveys.]{.underline} The
University of Alaska is well positioned to research and develop
drone-carried geophysical equipment to conduct regional and
prospect-scale surveys. [Similarly, [researching and developing]{.mark}
drone-based hyperspectral [surveying capability to make]{.mark}
hyperspectral data acquisition and processing [more practically
available]{.mark}]{.underline}. Incorporating hyperspectral data in
regional or prospect-scale surveys to support critical mineral
assessments will facilitate resource discovery and development. One
limitation with hyperspectral data is its limited utility in vegetated
areas. Developing algorisms to filter vegetation signals from the data
will broaden the usability of this method.

[Modern geological data is geospatial and digital.]{.underline} Machine
learning (ML), or artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms could leverage
this digital geophysical, geochemical and geological data to predict
locations of interest for critical minerals. These would allow national
or state entities and industry to focus resources on highest potential
areas and shorten the time to discovery and production. High
transportation and energy costs in remote arctic regions are a
significant economic barrier to development. The costs for transporting
concentrates for further processing and metal extraction at a distant
facility can be insurmountable for remote locations. [Process
technologies that allow shipment of metals rather than ore from remote
locations would greatly improve project economics, and increase domestic
production]{.underline}. At the same time, many conventional refining
and metal extraction processes are energy intensive, making them
prohibitively expensive in remote Arctic areas that face some of the
nation's highest energy costs. [[Processes which improve recovery
efficiency or concentrate grade]{.mark} without requiring more energy
[have the greatest potential]{.mark} to enhanced value added
activity.]{.underline} As an example, in the gold mining industry
bio-oxidation of sulfides followed by gold leaching is a method to
recover gold from appropriate ores. Extending this or similar process
technology to appropriate critical mineral ores could significantly
improve the economics of remote deposits, bringing more into production.
[[Industry investment can be incentivized by **providing baseline
metallurgical information** that demonstrates recovery viability for
deposits in a region]{.mark}. This can be achieved [by conducting
regional characterization studies]{.mark} for critical mineral deposits
to determine whether the mineralogy is amenable to metallurgical
recovery, and whether the ores contain deleterious elements that would
impact economics. For example, do any of Alaska's belts of antimony
deposits contain deleterious elements that would be barriers to
development?]{.underline}

[Advanced exploration and development projects focus metallurgical
work]{.underline} on the dominant commodities in an orebody, frequently
paying little to no attention to minor commodities that would be a
by-product. [[Engaging with]{.mark} projects in the [advanced
**exploration to development** phase to characterize critical mineral
content, and **developing solution**]{.mark} to production barriers
**[would help facilitate critical mineral production]{.mark} from the
next generation of domestic mines.**]{.underline} E.g. cobalt is
contained in the pyrite at the Bornite deposit in northwest Alaska, what
metallurgical solutions can be developed to facilitate its recovery.
Barriers to critical mineral production must exist at current mining
operations where the contained critical minerals are not being produced.
Determining these barriers and researching solutions to facilitate
critical mineral production where appropriate could bring rapid results
e.g., ore at the Greens Creek and Red Dog mines contains significant
barite, but neither mine produces barite as a salable product. By
contrast the Palmer project, which is geologically similar to these
deposits, is planning to produce barite as a salable product.

Process waters from oil and gas production potentially contain critical
minerals. Development of carbon resources that result in metal-rich
brine production from organic deep-water sediments offer potential for
by-product critical mineral production. On Alaska's North Slope some of
the oil and gas source rocks are known to contain high REE, V, P and
fluorine. [**[Extraction techniques]{.mark}** developed to extract
critical minerals from Alaskan production waters **[could be utilized
across the Arctic]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Produced water and reservoir
composition datasets may allow al mineral prediction of critical mineral
content in undeveloped unconventional reservoir.

#### Arctic mining is key -- huge deposits and it directly challenges China's supply chain.

**Evans '2025** (Scarlett Evans, a staff writer at mining technology,
covering energy and mining-related news, "Mining in the Arctic: a rare
earth 'cold rush'?," Mine: Issue 149, 23 Janurary, 2025,
https://mine.nridigital.com/mine_feb25/arctic-mining-rare-earths) -- KJ

In its 2024 Economic Report, the Arctic Economic Council (AEC)
highlighted the potentially [[**pivotal** role mining in **Arctic**
**nations**]{.mark} could play in [fuel]{.mark}ling the [world's]{.mark}
[**increasing** demand for **critical** **raw**
**materials**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It stated that the Arctic region,
which encompasses parts of eight separate countries, is home to 31 of
the 34 materials identified as essential for clean energy technology. Of
note within these are rare earth elements
(**[[REEs]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [materials [**necessary** for]{.mark}
a range of [**clean** **energy** **tech**]{.mark}**nologies** including
electric vehicles (EVs), batteries and wind turbines. REEs in particular
are being **eyed** **up** in Norway, Sweden and Greenland.]{.underline}
Mining is not new to the Arctic region. Alaska is home to the largest
zinc mine in the world and Sweden to the largest iron ore mine in
Europe. However, high wages and strict regulatory frameworks have been
something of a deterrent to mining companies' activity in the region as
they typically want to extract as much as possible with minimal
overheads. Short daylight hours and extreme cold have also proven to be
a hurdle to investors looking to build infrastructure in the Arctic, as
well as companies that must provide high wages to attract any kind of
workforce. [The result is that the region's mineral **potential** has
remained relatively **untapped** despite its resources -- something the
AEC, among others, is looking to **change**. With projections that
[**critical** minerals needs]{.mark}, including those for **REEs**, [are
set to **rise** **exponentially**]{.mark}, coupled with mounting
**fears** of an **overreliance** on rare earth superpower China, a
renewed spotlight is being put on the [Arctic as]{.mark} a
[**potential** mining **hotspot**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The minerals
appeal of the Arctic "The Arctic region has three things that have
always (and will always) be exported," says Mads Qvist Frederiksen,
executive director at AEC. "Fish, energy and raw materials --- with the
latter going back to the 1600s. ["Fast forward, and with the **rise** of
industrialisation the world needs **more** **and** **more** minerals as
it needs more technologies, meaning the **Arctic\'s** raw materials are
getting **renewed** **attention**." Indeed, according to the
International Energy Agency, [demand for critical minerals wil]{.mark}l
nearly [**triple** by **2030**]{.mark}, growing to more than 3.5-times
the current levels by 2050. This, alongside the fact that the Arctic is
feeling the effects of climate change more **keenly** than anywhere else
-- **warming** **four-times** **faster** than the rest of the world,
according to research in Nature -- has given some **urgency** to the
**Arctic** **focus**.]{.underline} The Kiruna mining region in Sweden\'s
Arctic is home to an underground iron ore mine and Per Geijer, one of
Europe\'s largest deposits of phosphorus and REEs. Credit: Tommy Alven /
Shutterstock Currently, no REEs are mined in Europe, although the
landscape is shifting, and exploration of the [[Arctic]{.mark} has
already proven it is home to [**significant** deposits]{.mark} of the
materials.]{.underline} According to the Arctic Review, Greenland has
enough reserves of minerals such as neodymium and dysprosium to meet at
least a quarter of future global demand, around 38.5 million tonnes
(mt). Additionally, [in 2023, Swedish miner LKAB made headlines by
announcing it had identified a REE deposit in **[Kiruna]{.mark}** that
**[exceeds]{.mark}** [**1mt** of rare earth oxides]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The discovery was, briefly, the largest deposit of its kind in Europe,
before being overtaken in 2024 by Norway's Fen Carbonatite Complex in
Telemark. [While LKAB is still conducting **research** into the Kiruna
deposit, the **discovery** adds to the **perception** of the Nordic
[Arctic]{.mark} as a **[viable]{.mark}** supply [**alternative** to
China]{.mark}]{.underline} -- evidenced by Donald Trump's renewed
mission to gain control of Greenland's minerals. "The two main drivers
for people looking to the region are climate change and geopolitics,"
explains Frederiksen. "Of course, we need critical raw materials to
pursue a green transition, but people are also looking for control, and
with nations like China stockpiling materials including rare earths,
people are becoming concerned about resource control."

Introductions

Over the past few months, Rahul Sharma and [I have interviewed
**dozens** of **experts** in **d**eep-**s**ea **m**ining]{.underline}
for an upcoming paper; [from **business** leaders, to investors,
**scientists**, researchers and **politicians**]{.underline}. What has
astonished us is [the feeling of **[inevitabil]{.mark}ity** about
[deep-sea mining]{.mark} that has cropped up [**across** **the
spectrum**]{.mark}]{.underline}, from Supporters through to the most
adamant Opponents. [[There\'s]{.mark} an [**overwhelming**
**opinion**]{.mark} that [DSM **will happen**]{.mark} - [it\'s]{.mark}
more [a]{.mark} [matter of **when** and]{.mark} in **[what
form]{.mark}**]{.underline} - and therefore the discussion needs to be
about regulations and approaches. This seems very much [at **odds** with
how the media portrays deep-sea mining]{.underline}, and it leads me to
believe that mining [companies need to **embrace** the **reality** of
deep-sea mining]{.underline} in order [to **survive** and help **shape**
this industry]{.underline}. Why?

macroeconomic drivers + huge demand [**World [demand]{.mark}** for
critical minerals [is]{.mark} [growing
**exponentially**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Demand is being driven by a
number of factors, including [increased adoption of **e**lectric
**v**ehicles; uptake of **wind** and **solar** energy; increased
computing demands for **AI**; and steadily growing demand for personal
**electronics**]{.underline}. The result has been massively increasing

[[Countries]{.mark} whose economies are [**reliant** upon critical
minerals]{.mark}]{.underline} for industry, production and security
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
**[[concerned]{.underline}]{.mark}** by this threat. [Japan, **Taiwan**,
South Korea and China all have **semiconductor** industries which
require critical **minerals**. **US**]{.underline} and Chinese national
security and [defense industries are **dependent** upon **advanced
semiconductors**]{.underline}. San Francisco [tech companies are
**highly reliant** upon state-of-the-art **GPUs** for **AI**
applications]{.underline}. European de-carbonization efforts and
EV-driven strategies at German car manufacturers are driven by these
metals. Macroeconomic drivers of prosperity and national defence
therefore mean that international [governments will **pursue** critical
minerals, with **limited regard** for their source]{.underline}. Subsea
Mineral Opportunity enormous resources + low CapEx [**71%** of the
world\'s surface is]{.underline} covered in **[water]{.underline}**, and
subsea [mineral resources can be found **across** the world\'s
oceans]{.underline}; from the mid-Pacific, to the Indian Ocean, to the
Norwegian Sea and Bothnian Bay. These [resource plays are
**huge**,]{.underline} and whilst some are extremely remote, others are
[located close to **key markets** in the **US** and mainland
**Europe**]{.underline}:

\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\>

Deep-sea mining resource estimates are huge, and the USGS estimates that
[[subsea]{.mark} mineral [resources **dwarf** terrestrial]{.mark}
resources [by]{.mark} a factor of around **[20x]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Critical minerals are found in [**high abundances** in subsea mineral
resources, including **Cobalt**]{.underline} (206x terrestrial
resources), **[Nickel]{.underline}** (14x terrestrial resources) [and
**Titanium**]{.underline} (9x terrestrial resources).

\<\<FIGURE OMITTED\>\>

Finally, whilst mining CapEx can be significant, the [**initial**
capital expenditure for deep-sea mining is significantly
**lower**]{.underline}. This is a consequence of the [**reusability** of
production support vessels, which can sail **onto** and **away** from
**particular** subsea mineral resources]{.underline}. By comparison,
[**terrestrial mining** often requires **significant** expanses of
**land**]{.underline} to be cleared, access [**roads** to be built,
**accomodation**]{.underline} and offices to be constructed, [and for
**overburden** to be **removed**]{.underline}.

**[[Mining]{.mark} contributed [just 3% of Alaska's
GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 2019.56 As mentioned in section 2.1,
applying the USGS data on mineral production and reserves to Alaska
faces two challenges. First, the statistics for the United States do not
distinguish the Arctic regions (Alaska) from the Lower 48 states.
However, the accompanying text provides useful guidance on the location
of most of the significant mines. Second, the USGS withholds production
data for certain minerals due to commercial confidentiality. 9 The
contents of this paper are the author's sole responsibility. They do not
necessarily represent the views of the Oxford Institute for Energy
Studies or any of its Members. [Taking into account these limitations,
it appears that **[the only critical mineral]{.mark} produced [in the

silver]{.mark}.** The United States accounts for 3.8 per cent of global
silver supply and reserves, to which Alaska makes a
contribution]{.underline}. The state does not host significant reserves
of any other critical mineral. A series of federal government policies
have triggered a new wave of investment in the mining of critical
minerals in the United States. These include Executive Order 13817 of
2017, 57 the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,58 and an updated list of
critical minerals in 2022.59 The State of Alaska has also been reviewing
its mining policies.60 Federal government policies have enabled
exploration to pick up in Alaska, notably for lead-zinc deposits. Most
of these contain associated silver, and a few host copper, notably the
Arctic deposit.61 The Bornite lead-zinc deposit also contains cobalt,
germanium, and gallium. 62 Whilst geological evidence indicates that a
wide range of critical minerals may be found in Alaska,63 it is not yet
clear whether they can be mined at scale or profitably.

In recent years, the World Bank and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), which unites the 36 home countries
of the Earth's Golden Billion, have concerned themselves with two
issues: [What should we do about the **green- house effect** and
**climate change**? and What happens when we run out of
oil?]{.underline} \[1, 2\]. The World Bank and the OECD are making
forecasts to assist in answering these [questions,]{.underline} which
[all tend to focus on one zero- option scenario,]{.underline} namely,
[[a transition to green tec]{.mark}hnology.]{.underline} However[, this
transition---according to the same forecasts---[will require **a
substantial increase in the extraction of**
]{.mark}]{.underline}nonrenewable mineral resources (such as oil, gas,
and solid deposits) [and, most importantly, [critical metals and
minerals]{.mark}. [The coming years will inevitably spark a hunt
for]{.mark} the **[untouched Arctic]{.mark} troves of [mineral
resources]{.mark}**. Furthermore, one should expect a boom of geological
exploration in the frontier regions of the Arctic to uncover new
deposits. In the 21st century, [Russia's]{.mark} geopolitical
[interests]{.mark} have been consistently [moving]{.mark} northward,

[mineral]{.mark} raw material--[producing nations of the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} \[4\]. Mean- while, detailed metallogenic
studies have been carried out only for individual regions of the Russian
Arctic, most of which (over 4 million km2) remains a little- known
frontier zone. [The prospects of development of critical metal deposits
in the [Arctic]{.mark} depend,]{.underline} apart from the scope and
richness of the ores, [on the [proximity]{.mark} to the Northern Sea
Route and navigable rivers. **A good location [may largely boost the
profit]{.mark}ability [of mining]{.mark} operations** through the use of
water transport]{.underline} \[4\]. Despite the centuries-old history of
mining operations, [**[the]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} interior [still
contains enough]{.mark} solid minerals** ([SMs]{.mark}).]{.underline}
Among these, the mining industry presently is targeting platinum group
metals (PGMs): Di, Ni, Co, Zn, Ti, P2O5, Ag, Pb, Fe-ore, Au, Cu, etc.
For a comparative analysis across national sectors of the Arctic, the
amount of mined SMs was estimated in US dollars at the average annual
prices of 2017 \[5, 6\]. A comparative analysis was likewise performed
across the regions of the Russian Arctic. In addition, the results for
the Arctic as a whole were compared with the global data (Fig. 1), and
those for the Russian sec- tor were compared with the Arctic as a whole
(Fig. 2). The share of Arctic mineral raw materials in the world
reserves and production was calculated from the data in \[5\]. The share

The greatest potential for growth in SM mining exists in virtually

will be discovered** in the Arctic]{.mark} sectors of Russia, the United
States, and Canada,]{.underline} while the old industrial regions of
Scandinavia will further experience stagnation of mineral mining both in
the near future and in the midterm. As one can see from Fig. 4[, the
Arctic offers great prospects for the Russian mineral raw materials
sector]{.underline}; the expected leaders in SM mining should be the
frontier lands of the north- ern uluses of Yakutia, Taimyr, and Chukotka
and the territories of Arkhangelsk oblast and the Republic of Karelia.
Green technology. The term technology means application of knowledge for
practical purposes. The adjective green suggests a human impact on the
environment. The main purpose of green technology is to satisfy today's
needs without jeopardizing the capability of future generations to
satisfy their own needs. According to the OECD's classification \[7\],
[[green tech]{.mark}nology encompasses the following domains:
environmental management]{.underline} (waste management, water and air
pollution control, land rehabilitation, etc.); [energy production from
renewable sources]{.underline} (solar energy, biofuels, etc.); [and
mitigating the effects of climate change]{.underline} (reducing harmful
emissions into the atmosphere, increasing fuel efficiency and energy
effi- ciency in buildings and lighting fixtures). Thus, the green
technology concept implies the use of science and technology to protect
the environment. [This technology [is crucial for supporting the very
sensitive Arctic nature]{.mark}.]{.underline} Green nanotechnology means
the application of the principles of green chemistry and green
engineering (the philosopher's stone of the future) on a scale of one
billionth of a meter. Nanotechnology is expected to transform the mode
of production and enable the Fig. 1. Mining of solid minerals in the

esti- mated that green technology will induce change on the same scale
as computer technology. At an early stage, one cannot predict exactly
what changes will occur in each person's daily life from [the
application of green technology]{.underline}, but one is able to foresee
problems and challenges caused by the new technological trend.
Apparently, [the most pressing problem is the development of alternative
fuels and new ways to generate energy.]{.underline} However, for some
time (until 2060), new technologies will be used alongside the old ones,
and [the green transition will require a sharp increase in the
production of nonrenewable mineral resources. Experts believe that by
2060, **[as a result of the green transition, the global demand for
metals will grow more than for any other raw materials]{.mark}**, from 8
to 20 gigatons per year]{.underline} \[7\]. Battery, high-tech, and
critical metals. Over the past decade, developed nations (the United
States, EU countries, Japan, South Korea, the United King- dom, and
Australia) have conducted special studies to assess the mineral raw
material potential of critical metals and minerals. The general approach
worldwide is to consider, as critical species, [mainly those [mineral
raw materials that lie at the core of]{.mark} high technology
([green-tech]{.mark}) and [make a major contribution to]{.mark}
progressive [development]{.mark} of many industries.]{.underline} The
report of the US National Academy of Sciences gives the following
definition: "[A mineral can be regarded as critical only if it performs
an essential function for which few or no satisfactory substitutes
exist]{.underline}" \[8\]. The Russian-language literature uses the term
strategic as a synonym. Two main groups are distinguished among complex
deposits of critical metals. The first one comprises ore deposits
containing a complex of rare metals and rare- earth elements. The second
group comprises complex deposits of ferrous and nonferrous metals,
nonmetal- lic materials, coals, and other minerals, with critical ones
included as associated components. The latter include many critical
metals and semimetals (Bi, Cd, Se, Te, Ge, Ga, In, Tl, Te, Se, Re, Sc,
Hf) obtained as by-products and recovered in the late stages of metal-
lurgical processes. In many cases, little is known about these metals
within complex ores, and they are charac- terized by vague resource
estimates only, both in Rus- sia and worldwide. The main sources of
associated metals are sulfide ores of copper, lead, zinc, and
molybdenum; some types of tungsten, tin, and ura- nium deposits;
bauxites; and placer deposits. These metals are often called satellite
metals. [The [growth in the global demand]{.mark} for electric
cars]{.underline}, as projected by the International Energy Agency
(IEA), [has [forced the automotive industry to focus on]{.mark} the
reserves of the so-called battery metals, which are indispensable for
the production of batteries. **These include**]{.underline} Li, Ni, Co,
graphite, and [rare earth metals (**[REMs]{.mark}**).]{.underline}
According to the IEA, in the last year, two million electric vehicles
operated on the road world- wide; by 2040 this number will reach at
least 40 million \[9\]. By 2025, electric cars will cost as much as
those with internal combustion engines. Therefore, cobalt, one of the
main battery metals, has risen in price over the past year and a half by
more than 190%. The IEA predicts that the [demand for cobalt will
double]{.underline} by 2020, reaching 200 000 tons per year \[9\].
Cobalt supply is the most difficult to secure because 65% of its out-
put comes from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one of the poorest
and most politically unsta- ble countries in the world. [In Russia, the
**main [production]{.mark}** [of battery metals **is concentrated in the
Arctic**]{.mark} zone:]{.underline} in Norilsk and in Murmansk oblast
\[4, 10\]. Thus, 6% of cobalt and 12% of nickel supplies worldwide are
controlled by PAO Norilsk Nickel. Norilsk is home to one-seventh of the
world's nickel ore reserves, which is why Norilsk Nickel began to
modernize its production in an effort to increase the supply of metals
for Li-ion and other modern batteries. According to experts \[9\],
[lithium will become a cat- alyst of the upcoming green
revolution]{.underline}. Due to the rush demand, the coming years may
see a shortage of supply; by 2030, the demand is expected to increase by
a factor of four. Lithium batteries can take any shape and size, ranging
from the size of a table to the classical designs. Already today, [China
plans a transition of all public transport to Li-ion batteries, and
Norway plans to abandon gasoline engines altogether by
2025.]{.underline} The year 2018 became a landmark year for global
investors. The demand for lithium carbonate jumped by 300%; the price of
nickel rose by a factor of 1.5; and those of copper and aluminum, by
25%. In order to manufac- ture 500 000 electric cars per year, one would
have to buy up all the Li in the world \[9\]. On the territory of
Russia, the Kolmozerskoye and Polmostundrovskoye deposits in Murmansk
oblast (34% of the total Russian reserves) are the best in terms of Li2O
reserves and abundances \[11\]. In addi- tion, these same deposits
contain 14% of Russia's beryllium reserves and about 3% of tantalum. In
Rus- sia, the use of Li and its compounds has so far been limited mainly
to the defense industry. In developing a high-tech green industry,
Russia will increase the use of lithium. In all likelihood, by 2025 the
[demand for this metal in Russia will increase multifold]{.underline},
compared to the current level, and will hit at least 3000 tons per year
\[11\]. The IEA predicts that the global demand for Li compounds in 2020
will more than double, and by 2040, it may grow by a factor of four
\[9\]. In addition to battery metals**[, [the Russian Arctic provides
many of the most important high-tech metals]{.mark}]{.underline}**
\[10\], including Ro, Mn, In, Nb, Ga, Cu, Ta, Pd, Pt, V, Ti, Te, Se, Hf,
Zr, Re, Ge, and Cd; and 17 of the so- called lanthanides, i.e., rare
earth metals with lantha- num at the top. [[All of them are critical
for]{.mark} science- intensive industries and [the green
transition]{.mark}]{.underline} \[7\]. According to some analysts[, a
shortage of these metals will occur before the last drop of oil burns in
car engines]{.underline}. Each industry has its own list of key elements
\[7\]: Rh, Pd, Pt, V, Nd, and La for the automotive industry; Ge, Ga,
In, and Eu for fiber optics and electronics; Nb, Mo, W, Ta, Ti, Sc, and
Re for special steels and superhard alloys. High-precision optics is
unthinkable without La and Ce; elements such as Te, In, Ga, and Se are
indispensable in solar energy; and not a single jet plane would be able
to fly without Ti, Sc, and Re. Every year, the list of critical metals
for industry is getting longer. It is only the supplies of molybdenum
that cause no headache thanks to a well-developed mineral resource base
\[10\]. The other metals are considered critical for various reasons.
The situation is particularly acute with rhodium and platinum. Every
modern car is equipped with a catalyst that contains these platinoids,
which are not found alone in nature, only together. The world production
of rhodium, which costs a fantastic \$9000 per troy ounce (31.1 g),
about 50 tons per year, has virtu- ally reached its peak both in the
polar Norilsk and in the Merensky reef area in South Africa. No
substitutes for Rh and Pt have been found yet. It is believed that an
increase in the number of electric cars will lead to a decrease in the
number of cars with catalysts \[9\]. However, [the green auto industry
needs the same **[REMs]{.mark}** as the "traditional" industry, and they
[are now provided only by]{.mark} one, albeit giant, Bayan-Obo deposit
in [China]{.mark}.]{.underline} The total amount of REMs extracted at
Bayan-Obo is 125000 tons per year, including 20000 tons of neodymium and
40000 tons of lanthanum \[12\]. Batteries of the latest hybrid cars
Toyota Prius and Honda Insight, as well as cars of other companies,
including Chinese ones, contain a minimum of 12 kg La, 30 kg Ni, and 2
kg Co. These batteries do not age--- since 1999, Toyota has sold more
than 1 million hybrids, and the batteries of these cars have been func-
tioning successfully to this day \[9\]. There is an alterna- tive to the
Chinese supply of REMs, i.e., the extremely rich Mountain Pass deposit
in the mountains of the Mojave Desert (United States), the Australian
Dubbo and Arafura, and, of course, the deposits in the Arctic zone of
Russia (Khibinii Group, Kovdor, Lovozer- skoye, Tomtor, etc.). However,
at least a decade of efforts will pass before the development of these
sites yields an increase in the production of REMs. Rare-earth metals, a
group of 17 metals, including La, Sc, Y, etc., usually occur in
association with one another. The main sources of REMs are bastnesite,
monazite, and loparite minerals and ion-absorption ores. [There are
relatively few economically viable REM deposits in the
world]{.underline} \[13\]. [Most of the world's recoverable reserves of
[REMs]{.mark} are concentrated [in]{.mark} the bastnesite deposits of
**[China]{.mark} ([48%]{.mark}).**]{.underline} Large reserves also
exist in the monazite deposits of Australia, Brazil, China, India,
Malaysia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the United States. [The
world's REM reserves are estimated at 120 million tons]{.underline}
\[5\]; [the [Russia]{.mark}n reserves account for [20%]{.mark} of this
figure]{.underline} \[6\]. Over the past decade and a half, [**global
[REM mining has been growing at a very fast pace]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
In 2017, the mining output reached 130000 tons \[5\]. Experts predict
that by 2020, the demand for REMs will increase to 200000 tons, of which
130000--150000 tons will go to ensure China's self-sufficiency. More
than 30% of the REM consumption in 2017 went to produce electric motor
magnets \[6\]. A steady increase in the use of REMs was also observed in
the production of batter- ies, optical glass, and ceramics \[5\]. In
general, REM consumption has increased worldwide in recent years by 5%
annually. In 2017, the export of Chinese REM quotas amounted to 38000
tons with a light-to-heavy ratio of 7:1 \[5\]. In 2018[, **[China's
share was more than 86%]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of global
production]{.underline}**. New projects to develop deposits in other
countries yielded in 2017 a total of only 25000 tons [[of
REMs]{.mark}.]{.underline} It should be noted that in terms of the
monetary value of 1 ton of ore (in US dol- lars), third place among the
newly developed sites worldwide belongs to the Tomtor deposit in the
Arctic zone of Russia \[13\]. [[Almost]{.mark} [all]{.mark} the
state-registered [**REM** reserves in Russia are]{.mark} associated with
deposits [in the Arctic zone]{.mark}]{.underline} \[4, 6, 11\]. The main
share---more than 40%---is con- tained in the Khibinii deposits of
apatite--nepheline ores. The rest is associated with the complex
loparite ores (together with Ta, Nb, Ti) of the Lovozerskii deposit
(more than 25%) and with the weathering crusts of the Tomtor rare-metal
carbonatites, which contain associated Nb (about 10%) \[6\]. All REMs in
Russia are extracted from the loparite ores of the Lovozerskii deposit.
The resulting loparite concen- trate with a rare-earth metal oxide (REO)
content of 28--30% goes for metallurgical processing at the Solikamsk
Metallurgical Plant, to manufacture car- bonates and oxides of mixed
REOs \[6\]. Over 70% of rare-earth elements are used at the production
facili- ties of OAO Rossiiskaya elektronika and Shvabe Hold- ing (within
the Rostec Group of Companies); 20-- 25% within the Rosatom system; 5%
in the metallur- gical sector (as additives to alloy steels); and the
rest in petrochemical and other industries \[6\]. The state program
Development of Industry and Its Competitiveness for the Period until
2020 \[14\] proj- ects that, by 2020, Russia should achieve self-suffi-
ciency in REMs and completely abandon imports \[11\]. Based on the
calculations of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia, by 2020
the demand for REMs in Russia will reach 5000--7000 tons, or even up to
13 000 tons, according to an optimistic forecast. The calculations
envisage annual exports of 7000--10000 tons in the case of full-scale
implementation of the pro- gram. It should be noted that if Russian
industry pro- cessed more than seven million tons of apatite, extracting
REMs along the way, Russia would be able to satisfy almost 50% of the
global demand. \* \* \* [The analysis showed that the [raw materials
base]{.mark} of strategic metals [in the Arctic is]{.mark} currently [in
good condition]{.mark} to ensure sustainable development of the
economies]{.underline} of the countries within its boundaries. [The same
appraisal applies to the individual national sectors of the Arctic. [The
mining industry possesses]{.mark}, despite its environmental issues,
[considerable **development** prospects **in almost all the sectors of
the Arctic,**]{.mark} including in the Arctic zone of
Russia.]{.underline} The available active reserves enable an increase in

[for]{.mark} the implementation of [green

production at the existing ones. The reali- zation of this potential is
hindered by a lack of reliable information on the amounts of associated
critical met- als in the ores and concentrates of known deposits, by
unresolved technological issues of their extraction, and by low
profitability of mining operations. There- fore, a detailed study of the
abundances of associated critical metals in the ores of complex deposits

research. Undoubtedly[, **[the enormous potential

kilometres -- 2.48 million square kilometres below the 1981--2010
average and the second-lowest extent since modern record-keeping began
during the late 1970s. The startling decrease was linked to a Siberian
heatwave in spring 2020 that began the year's Arctic sea ice melt season
unusually early. Last year, Arctic temperatures were 8--10°C warmer than
average. [The main Arctic regions linked to oil and gas exploitation are
the **Beaufort Sea** (North Slope, Alaska, and Mackenzie Delta, Canada)
and the northwest Russian Arctic (Barents Sea and West Siberia). Oil and
gas are also found in the **Canadian Arctic Archipelago** (Nunavut).
According to the US Geological Survey (**USGS**), up to **90 billion

highly valued]{.mark} minerals such as cobalt, nickel, and [rare
earths]{.mark}. Recent technological advances and new companies are
making their extraction economically feasible for the first
time]{.underline}. Sign up for PowerPlay, the Atlantic Council's

historic opposition toward its international regulation of seabed
resources in the High Seas. [**This [lack of participation bars
US]{.mark} companies [from]{.mark} directly participating in what could
be [a significant new industry]{.mark}**. [It has]{.mark} already [led
to **dominance of deep sea** ]{.mark}**exploration** permits
**[by]{.mark} geopolitical competitors**---[China]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark} have together won nine permits, including in areas

Law of the Sea treaty**[, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can
bolster]{.mark} critical [mineral supply security]{.mark}, [enter deep
sea markets, and]{.mark} [enhance national
security]{.mark}]{.underline}.** Governments and private industry have
long worked to enable the extraction of minerals from the deep seabed
for a range of resources, including cobalt crusts, hydrothermal
sulphides, and polymetallic nodules. Of these, polymetallic nodules are
the most sought after---ocean processes create these billiard-ball-sized
clumps of valuable metals. Ore grades in nodules significantly exceed
those on land, making their extraction both cost and emissions
efficient. The largest collection of nodules is located in an area
called the Clarence Clipperton Zone (CCZ), which stretches the Eastern
Pacific between Hawaii and Mexico[. Recent technological developments,
particularly in remotely operated vehicles and underwater vehicles, mean
that [deep sea resources are]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}potentially
[economical today**. Reliable critical mineral supplies are
[increasingly important for the global economy and security]{.mark}.**
They are needed to meet clean energy needs, including electricity
infrastructure, electric vehicles, and renewable energy. Many [advanced
tech]{.mark}nologies for [defense applications]{.mark}, particularly
electronics, [require]{.mark} stable and growing supplies of these [rare
minerals]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[China dominates]{.mark}
[extraction]{.mark} and processing [of most critical
minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}**, while the United States is a major
importer for all minerals that deep sea mining might supply. Governance
of deep sea mining depends on location. Under UNCLOS, seabed resources
within exclusive economic zones are governed by the relevant nation.
Norway recently became the first country to authorize mining of such
resources in their jurisdiction, but most resources are outside such
zones. Resources in the remaining half of the ocean, called the High
Seas, are governed by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). Although
the United States played an active role in negotiating UNCLOS and
considers most of it customary international law, it has not ratified
the treaty due to Senate opposition to the role of the ISA. Among other
reasons, some senators historically opposed the ISA's international
royalty mechanism, and expressed concerns about precedent for other
domains like outer space. Without ratification, the United States cannot
directly participate in the ISA's governing process, and American
companies cannot receive ISA mining permits. These criticisms are not
unfounded. The ISA has existed for decades and yet is struggling to
establish a governance framework. The small nation of Nauru is forcing
the issue legally, and the ISA is close to finalizing its mining permit
system, without clear environmental protection. Global environmental
groups have called for a moratorium on deep sea mining until scientists
can conduct more research on environmental impacts. Still, one of the
primary objections (that an ISA-like royalty mechanism would be created
for space exploration) to ratifying the law of the sea is no longer
valid. In the last decade, the United States and many other countries
have passed domestic legislation legalizing space mining without a space
equivalent to ISA. This approach has been legitimized by the
multilateral US-led Artemis Accords, which now has thirty-five
signatories including all major space powers except China and Russia.
The United States has secured a governance pathway forward for space
resources that does not repeat the limitations of the ISA. The letter
calling for ratifying the Law of the Sea is the culmination of a growing
bipartisan agreement [around securing critical minerals in the face of
an ongoing trade war with China.]{.underline} A group of bipartisan
senators led by Senators Lisa Murkowski, Mazie Hirono, and Tim Kaine
introduced a resolution explicitly calling for ratification.
[Congress]{.underline}, in both informal letters and directed reports,
[is pushing for studies on deep sea resources in US waters and the
ability to establish domestic processing infrastructure]{.underline}. In
late 2023, the US State Department initiated an extended continental
shelf claim into the Arctic and Pacific oceans, exerting jurisdiction
over seabed mining for certain areas beyond its exclusive economic zone,
a practice explicitly outlined in UNCLOS. However, China and Russia have
challenged this new assertion, arguing at ISA that the US cannot make
the claim because it has not signed UNCLOS. Ratifying UNCLOS would also
bolster US diplomatic power. The Houthi campaign in the Red Sea is
disrupting 20 percent of global maritime trade. Multiple submarine
telecommunications cables in the Baltic Sea and Red Sea have been
severed in the last year, threatening global internet connectivity. For
more than a decade, China has been violating the principles of the LOS
with their actions in the South China Sea and elsewhere. UNCLOS
ratification would greatly strengthen US credibility in seeking
international coalitions to push back against these challenges. **[[The
future of deep sea mining remains uncertain]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
burgeoning industry faces technical, economic, regulatory,
environmental, and political challenges. [The abyssal plains of the deep
seabed hold unique biodiversity and are fragile, so mining activities
must readily incorporate environmental best practices to limit impacts
and gain social license to operate. Nevertheless, its potential benefits
to meeting critical mineral supply are substantial, as are the
geopolitical stakes of establishing a leadership position. **[The
urgency of securing critical mineral supply means the time is right for
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline} to reconsider its
formal participation in UNCLOS.

[In [April 2025]{.mark}, [China imposed new export controls on **seven
r**]{.mark}**are [e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lement[s]{.mark}** and the
permanent magnets derived from them --- [materials]{.mark} that

[warfare]{.mark}**. **Fighter jets, missiles, electric vehicles, drones,
wind turbines**, and even **data centers** rely on high-performance
magnets made from these critical minerals]{.underline}. By restricting
their flow, [Beijing did not just flex its industrial muscle, it
[revealed America's]{.mark} and the rest of the world's **[dangerous
vulnerability]{.mark}**. [China's]{.mark} latest [actions show]{.mark}
their [readiness and ability to **weaponize America**]{.mark}**n and
global dependence**.]{.underline} This is not a new challenge. [The
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [known for **over 15 years**]{.mark}
that its [critical mineral supply]{.mark} chains were **too
concentrated, too fragile**, and [**too exposed** to Chinese]{.mark}
leverage and [control]{.mark}. And yet, across Democratic and Republican
administrations, we have [failed]{.mark} to [respond with
urgency]{.mark} or coherence. Now, the **[consequences of]{.mark} those
[failures]{.mark} have grabbed us by the neck and [are cascading
across]{.mark} our [commercial and defense
sectors.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Following the London talks, Washington
and Beijing announced on Friday a new trade framework under which China
will resume approving export licenses for rare earths over the next six
months. U.S. officials have publicly extolled the breakthrough --- but
have offered few details about what was given in return. That leaves
major questions unanswered: What were the U.S. trade-offs? How will the
deal be enforced? And what happens when the six months are up?
[Skepticism is **high**. Ford recently halted production at its Chicago
plant due to a magnet shortage --- underscoring that even **short-term
supply interruptions have real consequences**]{.underline}. Paper
agreements are not supply chain solutions. Without transparency, timely
approvals, and long-term planning, this could easily become another
diplomatic cycle of one step forward, two steps back. \[video omitted\]
Even this limited reprieve carries risks. Dozens of companies in Europe
and North America have described China's export license process as
highly invasive --- requiring firms to submit detailed production data,
end-use applications, facility images, customer names, and transaction
histories. Some applicants have been denied for not providing
photographs or documentation of their end users. Executives say the
process amounts to "official information extraction." While firms are
advised not to share sensitive IP, omitting key details can mean
indefinite delays. For companies in defense supply chains, the
implications are alarming: valuable commercial intelligence could be
used to map competitors, disrupt pricing, or advance Chinese
substitutes. This isn't just licensing --- it's competitive
surveillance. And until the U.S. builds secure, independent capacity
across the critical minerals supply chain, it remains exposed to both
disruption and data risk. This vulnerability did not happen overnight.
Many have been watching this slow-motion train wreck for years. In 2010,
China cut off rare earth exports to Japan during a maritime dispute, a
clear warning shot the U.S. observed but brushed off. In 2014, the Obama
administration won a WTO case against China's export restrictions but
wrongly assumed that legal success would deter further manipulation.
What Trump, Biden have done The first Trump administration identified
rare earths as critical but notably exempted them from 2018 China
tariffs, perhaps an unspoken acknowledgment of U.S. dependence. Biden
took the most structured approach to date: Executive Order 14017, the
Critical Minerals Working Group, and funding from the IIJA and IRA.
Strategic partnerships like the Minerals Security Partnership emerged.
But progress was slow, hampered by permitting delays and uneven ally
commitments. [The second Trump administration has returned with more
**aggressive measures**, invoking Section 232, activating the Defense
Production Act, and proposing major funding boosts in FY2026. A National
Energy Dominance Council now coordinates efforts. Yet **these
measures**, like China's six-month reprieve, still **fall short of
dislodging Beijing's grip.** And crucially, the defense sector remains
cut off, with no such licensing window available.]{.underline} The
recent G7 summit in Canada underscored the global stakes. European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen directly accused China of
"weaponizing" its control over key materials like rare earths, calling
for a united G7 response. The result: a G7 Critical Minerals Action
Plan. Though China was not mentioned by name, the subtext was
unmistakable. The plan commits G7 members to raise ESG and traceability
standards for key resources; mobilize capital for new projects in
critical mineral mining and processing; and cooperate on innovation in
recycling, substitution, and refining technologies. Predictably, Beijing
reacted with fury. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the
plan as "a pretext" for protectionism, claiming the G7 was instigating
confrontation out of fear of losing market share. Brussels is now
signaling that trade negotiations with Beijing are effectively stalled,
so the odds of Chinese retaliation --- particularly against the EU ---
are rising. If China doubles down, it risks pushing the EU, Japan, South
Korea, and India more tightly into Washington's orbit --- precisely what
Beijing hopes to avoid. China's dominant position in rare earth mining
The raw numbers are staggering. [[China accounts for]{.mark} roughly
**[70% of global r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}ining** but [over

like MP Materials Mountain Pass and Round Top [**remain** **incomplete**
without downstream processing]{.mark}. The DoD and DOE have offered

and secure access to critical minerals. But all this [**remains
dwarfed** by China's head start and longtime industrial
command-and-control of]{.mark} the [sector]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[image
omitted\] [[China moved early and decisively]{.mark} into Africa and
Latin America, [partnering with governments]{.mark} in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Bolivia, and Chile; investing in ports, rails, and
[refining infrastructure]{.mark}. In contrast, [U.S. efforts and
engagement on]{.mark} these sets of [issues]{.mark}]{.underline} has
been piecemeal and values-forward, prioritizing transparency and
governance, important issues indeed, but [[delivering limited momentum
of]{.mark} the [critical mineral issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even
recent MOUs with Ukraine and the Democratic Republic of Congo remain,
for now, symbolic, hindered by conflict and instability in those
countries. The London talks and recent trade deal progress bought time.
But time without a strategy is not fruitful. China's licensing regime
remains intact, its data demands unabated. The defense sector remains
shut out. Meanwhile, congressional threats to rescind clean energy and
industrial policy funding could stall rare-earth projects just as they
gain traction. [This is a decisive moment. [China is betting that
America's internal divisions]{.mark} --- between l**abor, industry,
environmentalists, tribal nations, and political factions** --- will
[prevent]{.mark} the [kind of unified, sustained effort needed to

policy requires commitment from one presidency to the next. Nor can the
U.S. afford to engage allies and partners only rhetorically. Countries
like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chile, and Indonesia (among
others) need sustained partnerships backed by financing, technology
transfer, and critical infrastructure investments, not just our lectures
on governance. [The **six-month export reprieve** from China is not a

[[On April 4, **China**]{.mark}**'s Ministry of Commerce [imposed export
restrictions on seven]{.mark} rare earth elements ([REEs]{.mark})** and
magnets **[used in the defense]{.mark}, energy, and automotive
[sector]{.mark}s [in response to U.S. President]{.mark} Donald [Trump's
tariff increases on Chinese products]{.mark}**. The new restrictions
apply to 7 of 17 REEs---]{.underline}samarium, gadolinium, terbium,
dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium---[and requires companies to
secure special export licenses to export the minerals and
magnets]{.underline}. Q1: To what extent will the most recent export
restrictions on rare earths impact U.S. sourcing of these critical
minerals for defense technologies? A1: There are various types of export
restrictions: non-automatic licensing, tariffs, quotas, and an outright
ban. The new restrictions are not a ban; rather, they require firms to
apply for a license to export rare earths. This development has three
implications: first, [**[there will likely be a pause in
exports]{.mark}** as the Chinese government establishes this licensing
system. Second, there is [also]{.mark} likely to be [disruptions]{.mark}
in supply to some U.S. firms given that the announcement also placed 16
U.S. entities on its export control list, limiting them from receiving
dual-use goods.]{.underline} All but one of the firms on the list are in
the defense and aerospace industries. It is unclear how China will
implement the new licensing system. And third, the licensing system may
be dynamic and could incentivize countries across the world to cooperate
with China to prevent disruptions in their rare earths supply. Q2: What
is the significance of the focus on heavy rare earths given U.S. supply
chain vulnerabilities? A2: The restrictions apply to seven medium and
heavy rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium,
scandium, and yttrium[. **[The United States is particularly vulnerable
for these supply chains.]{.mark}** Until 2023, [**China accounted for 99
percent** of global heavy REEs processing]{.mark},]{.underline} with
only minimal output from a refinery in Vietnam. However, that facility
has been shut down for the past year due to a tax dispute[, effectively
[giving China a monopoly]{.mark} over supply.]{.underline} China did not
impose restrictions on light rare earths, for which a more diverse set
of countries undertake processing. Q3: [**Why are rare earths
significant to U.S. national security?** A3**: [REEs are crucial for a
range of defense technologies]{.mark}**, including F-35 fighter jets,
Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines,]{.underline} Tomahawk missiles,
radar systems, Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, and the Joint Direct
Attack Munition series of smart bombs. For example, the F-35 fighter jet
contains over 900 pounds of REEs. An Arleigh Burke-class DDG-51
destroyer requires approximately 5,200 pounds, while a Virginia-class
submarine uses around 9,200 pounds. [[The United States is already on
the back foot when it comes to manufacturing]{.mark} these [defense
technologies. **China is rapidly expanding**]{.mark} **its
[munitions]{.mark} production [and acquiring advanced weapons
systems]{.mark} and equipment [at a pace five to six times faster than
the United States]{.mark}**. **While [China is preparing with a wartime
mindset]{.mark}, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [continues to
operate under peacetime]{.mark} conditions.** Even before the latest
restrictions[, **the U.S. defense industrial base struggled**]{.mark}
**with limited capacity** and lacked the ability to scale up production
to meet defense technology demands. Further [bans on critical minerals
inputs will only widen the gap]{.mark}, **[enabling China to strengthen
its military capabilities more quickly]{.mark} than the United
States.**]{.underline} Q4: **[[Is the U.S. rare earths industry ready to
fill the gap]{.mark} in the event of a shortfall?]{.underline}** A4**[:
[No]{.mark}. There is no heavy rare earths separation happening in the
United States at present.]{.underline}** The development of these
capabilities is currently underway. In its 2024 National Defense
Industrial Strategy, the Department of Defense (DOD) set a goal to
develop a complete mine-to-magnet REE supply chain that can meet all
U.S. defense needs by 2027. Since 2020, the DOD has committed over \$439
million toward building domestic supply chains. In 2020, the Pentagon
awarded MP Materials \$9.6 million through the DPA Title III program for
a light rare earths separation facility at Mountain Pass, California. In
2022, the Pentagon awarded an additional \$35 million for a heavy rare
earths processing facility. These facilities would be the first of their
kind in the United States, fully integrating the rare earths supply
chain from mining, separating, and leaching in Mountain Pass to refining
and magnet production in Fort Worth, Texas. But even when these
facilities are fully operational, MP Materials will only be producing
1,000 tons of neodymium-boron-iron (NdFeB) magnets by the end of
2025---less than 1 percent of the 138,000 tons of NdFeB magnets China
produced in 2018. In 2024, MP Materials announced record production of
1,300 tons of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. In the same year,
China produced an estimated 300,000 tons of NdFeB magnets. The DOD has
thrown its support behind Lynas Rare Earth's U.S. subsidiary, Lynas USA,
as well. The company was awarded a \$30.4 million DPA Title III grant in
2021 for a U.S. separation facility for light REEs and another \$120
million in 2022 for a heavy REE processing facility. These DPA
investments are an important step in building completely independent
supply chains for REE magnets. Even with recent investments, [the United
States is a long way off from meeting the DOD's goal for a
mine-to-magnet REE supply chain independent of China, and it is even
further from rivaling foreign adversaries in this strategic industry.
U.S. capabilities are largely early-stage]{.underline}. For example, in
January 2025, USA Rare Earths produced its first sample of dysprosium
oxide purified to 99.1 percent. Produced using ore from the Round Top
deposit in Texas and processed at a research facility in Wheat Ridge
Colorado, the company has called the development a breakthrough for the
domestic rare earths industry. However, significant work remains to turn
production of samples in a laboratory into full scale commercial
production capable of reducing reliance on China. [Developing mining and
processing capabilities requires a long-term effort, meaning the United
States will be on the back foot for the foreseeable future.]{.underline}
Q5: Could the United States have seen this coming? A5: Yes. A number of
policies have foreshadowed that REE export restrictions were on the
horizon[. [China]{.underline}]{.mark} [first [weaponized rare
earths]{.mark} in 2010 when it banned exports to Japan over a fishing
trawler dispute. Between 2023 and 2025, China began imposing export
restrictions of strategic materials to the United States,]{.underline}
including gallium, germanium, antimony, graphite, and tungsten. In 2023,
the Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United
States and the Chinese Communist Party published a report titled Reset,
Prevent, Build: A Strategy to Win America\'s Economic Competition with
the Chinese Communist Party. **[It recommended that "[Congress should
incentivize the production of]{.mark} rare earth element magnets, which
are the principal end-use for [rare earth elements]{.mark} and used in
electric vehicles, wind turbines, wireless technology, and countless
other products."]{.underline}** Specifically, it advocated for Congress
to establish tax incentives to promote U.S. manufacturing[. In December
2023, China imposed a ban of REE extraction and separation technologies.
It had a notable impact on developing REE supply chain capabilities
outside of China due to two main factors.]{.underline} First, China
possesses specialized technical expertise in this field that other
countries do not. For instance, [it has an absolute advantage in solvent
extraction processing techniques for rare earths, an area where Western
companies have faced challenges both in implementing advanced
technological operations and in addressing environmental
concerns]{.underline}. Second, while multiple facilities for separation,
processing, and manufacturing are currently being built, completing
construction and bringing them fully online will take several years. Q6:
[Are there any international partners from which the United States could
alternatively source heavy rare earths and fill the supply
gap?]{.underline} A6: While several countries are working to develop
their light and heavy rare earths deposits**[, [China maintains a
monopoly on refined heavy rare earths for the time
being]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Australia, Brazil, South Africa, Saudi
Arabia, Japan, and Vietnam all have initiatives and investments underway
to bolster key REE mining, processing, and research and development
(R&D) as well as magnet manufacturing. For the United States to build
alternative sourcing partners for long-term supply chain security, it is
important to continue to provide financial and diplomatic support to
ensure the success of these

### REM Shortage -- Specific 

#### There is a massive REM silver shortage that is rapidly increasing.

**JM Bullion** **25** \[01-24-2025, \"Buy Gold & Silver Bullion
Online\", JM Bullion,
<https://www.jmbullion.com/investing-guide/bullion/is-there-a-silver-shortage/>,
beginning at section titled: "Supply Factors"\] HH

Supply Factors Many countries endeavor to discover and mine as much
silver from their lands as possible. However, only a few of them manage
to do it at any scale. The top producer of silver in the world is
undeniably Mexico. The United States' southern neighbor produced 6,400
metric tons of silver in 2023, nearly double that of the second biggest
silver producer, China (3,400 metric tons). The production numbers may
even have been a bit soft, as workers at one of the top mines in the
country went on strike for four months in 2023. After China, the three
countries that round out the top five are Peru, Chile, and Poland. It
bears mentioning, though, that only the top three had production numbers
exceeding 3000 metric tons in 2023 -- Chile and Poland are well behind.
At present, increases in production from several countries are expected
to generate stronger numbers for silver production. New initiatives at
major mines in the US, China, and Russia are likely to produce increased
gains. However, silver mining itself is at a bit of a crossroads. The
environmental impact of mining silver is increasingly under scrutiny,
and the industry is working to discover more sustainable options for
their operations. Right now, silver mining consumes tremendous amounts
of water, and the overall involvement of heavy machinery is quite
disruptive to the surrounding ecosystems. So, they are going to have to
figure something out, or countries may begin clamping down and, in turn,
lowering production figures. One hidden factor in the supply of silver,
though, is the impact of recycling. Although industries need silver for
many of their products, the silver isn't usually destroyed by their
processes. Instead, after the life of the silver-bearing product ends,
the remaining silver is available to be melted and reused in a different
product. Overall, silver recycling accounted for 18% of the global
supply in 2023. That percentage changes each year, but usually hovers
around 20% or a bit above. In other words, a large chunk of our silver
supply comes from silver already on the surface, in use, and repurposed
from a different application.

Geopolitical concerns As usual, it's not as simple as pulling the metal
out of the ground. Countries, well aware of the importance of silver as
a trade lever, are more than happy to use their production -- or
deliberate lack thereof -- as a measure to induce favorable outcomes
from trade partners. Worse, a country could legitimately hold back sales
from a particular nation that it does not like, or trade silver with
other countries hostile to that nation. Unfortunately, the US finds
itself at cross purposes with two countries that are in the top 10 for
silver production. The first, and more concerning, is China. [China is
the second-largest producer of silver in the world, but the relationship
between China and the United States may be at a historic low
point.]{.underline} It is not outside the realm of possibility that
[China might hold its silver reserves back from the US -- along with
some other products -- soon. The other adversary to the US in the top
ten for silver production is Russia. For every bit of ill will that
Americans have for China, they have it and then some for Russia. Russia
is rising as a sort of existential threat to the West, and the notion of
risk-free trading with the Russians simply does not exist for the United
States. In other words, it's not just about where the silver is, but
which country has control over it.]{.underline} So, bear in mind that
some external factors may also affect the price of silver beyond the
simple supply and demand numbers of the industry.

The Future of Silver: Is a (Continued) Shortage Likely? So, the [next
question is whether a **[continued shortage]{.mark} is [likely]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} the [silver market]{.mark} in the future. The short answer
is that yes, demand is likely to continue to outrun supply for silver in
the future. Mine Magazine recently indicated that [Mexico]{.mark} is
going to be [producing]{.mark} [significantly less silver by
2030]{.mark}. As a result, [global silver production will dip below 900
million ounces]{.mark} in [that year]{.mark}. At the same time,
[demand]{.mark} for silver is [unlikely to decrease]{.mark}. [Industrial
usage]{.mark}, particularly regarding solar panels, [should
increas]{.mark}**[e]{.mark} its need for silver. Investors are probably
going to continue buying silver, too. With the floating exchange system
present worldwide, the chance to store value in tangible assets is one
that many buyers won't want to miss, especially in down economic times.
Don't overlook the fact that silver remains popular in jewelry,
too.]{.underline} As the world's population continues to expand, the
need for adornments is almost certain to move with it.

Possible mitigators There are [two mitigating factors that might serve
to close the gap between supply and demand of silver. The first
mitigator is that new sources of silver could be discovered at any
time.]{.underline} History is full of examples of markets changing
dramatically due to the discovery of new resources in previously
unexplored locations. Some intrepid cavers in Scotland could stumble
across the next Comstock Lode, and the market is suddenly flooded with
(cheaper) Scottish silver, for instance. So, it's important to keep your
ear to the ground about any new silver veins that change the
conversation. The other mitigator is when and if technological advances
either reduce or eliminate the need for certain industries to use
silver. Changes to the way that solar panels are made, for instance,
might eliminate their insatiable hunger for silver. More fantastically,
it's possible that a synthetic replacement for silver might become
viable, although it's going to be difficult to synthesize a material
that is more conductive, reflective, and viable. Nevertheless,
[technological evolution is a constant in our world, so you can never
say never about something like that. If either or both events come to
pass, supply of silver may be able to meet demand once
again.]{.underline}

Conclusion [Long story short, **[there is a shortage of silver]{.mark}
in the world [at present]{.mark}. [Demand for silver is]{.mark} nearly
[200 million ounces over ]{.mark}**[supply]{.mark}, and the situation is
probably not going to change any time soon.]{.underline} However, silver
shortages are nothing new. The supply of silver is never a static
number, and it waxes and wanes as the needs of humanity change and as
our ability to recover it from the earth improves. The best thing to do
is stay informed about market trends and news events that affect the
supply of silver. Keep an eye on the industries we discussed, too, as
they might produce something new in the future.

Neodymium Magnets Materials Shortage in the Future Last updated on 27
March , 2024 Introduction The global market is grappling with a
significant shortage of neodymium magnets, essential components in
numerous modern technologies. This article discusses the reasons behind
this scarcity, its implications, and potential solutions. Is There a
Shortage of Neodymium Magnets? Indeed, [[there is a critical shortage of
neodymium magnets]{.mark}, which is primarily attributed not to the
scarcity of neodymium itself but to the complexities of supply chains,
geopolitical tensions, and the escalating demand across key
sectors.]{.underline} Where Does the Shortage Come From? The shortage of
neodymium magnets, specifically NdFeB (neodymium-iron-boron) magnets,
stems from several factors: Geopolitical Tensions and Supply Chain
Concentration: The [[bulk of]{.mark} the [global production of]{.mark}
rare earth elements ([REEs]{.mark}), [including neodymium,]{.mark} is
[controlled by China]{.mark}.]{.underline} This concentration of
production in one geopolitical region introduces vulnerabilities due to
export restrictions and geopolitical frictions. [[Soaring Global
Demand]{.mark}: The [shift towards greener technologies]{.mark} and the
electrification of vehicles have [led to]{.mark} an [increased demand
for neodymium magnets]{.mark}, essential for manufacturing efficient
electric motors and renewable energy generators.]{.underline} Investment
and Infrastructure Challenges: [Establishing rare earth mining and
processing facilities outside China involves significant capital
investment and faces regulatory and environmental hurdles.]{.underline}
Dependency on Dysprosium (Dy) and Terbium (Tb): Enhancing the thermal
performance of NdFeB magnets requires the addition of Dy and Tb, rare
elements mined predominantly in China. The large Chinese mines for these
elements render international markets highly dependent on China\'s
supply and pricing strategies, further exacerbated by export quotas. How
to Solve the Neodymium Magnets Shortage? Addressing this shortage
requires a multifaceted strategy: [Diversifying Supply Chains:
Initiatives in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere aim to reduce
reliance on Chinese exports by developing local REE sources and
neodymium magnet production facilities]{.underline}. Developing
Alternative Materials: Research into alternative magnetic materials,
like iron nitride, could help lessen dependence on REEs. Although these
alternatives currently do not match the performance of neodymium
magnets, they represent a promising area for innovation. Recycling and
Reuse: Improving the recycling of neodymium magnets from discarded
products can alleviate some of the demand pressures. Establishing
efficient recycling processes is essential for a sustainable supply
chain. Government and Industry Collaboration: [To combat the shortage,
cooperation between governments and the private sector is crucial. This
could include supporting REE mining and processing]{.underline}, funding
alternative material research, and incentivizing recycling efforts.
Efficiency in Design: Industries can also contribute by optimizing
designs to reduce the quantity of neodymium needed. Innovations in
electric motor design, for example, could lead to efficient,
low-magnet-content solutions. Related Reading: Rare-Earth Recycling: A
Comprehensive Guide Conclusion The neodymium magnet shortage poses a
considerable challenge but also offers an opportunity for innovation and
global cooperation. By diversifying supply sources, investing in
alternative materials, and improving recycling efforts, the impacts of
the shortage can be mitigated. As the world progresses towards
sustainable technologies, securing the supply of critical components
like neodymium magnets is paramount for achieving long-term goals in
sustainability and energy independence.

We found that [[China **aims** to]{.mark} play a **[lead]{.mark}**ing
role in the development of [the GEI and is **well positioned**]{.mark}
to do so]{.underline}. China ranks first in three of the four indicators
we selected to determine national standing on GEI-enabling
technologies.58 This ranking suggests that a strong case can be made
that [[China is]{.mark} currently [the]{.mark} **[global
leader]{.mark}** [for GEI]{.mark}-enabling
**[tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark},
therefore, [is **well positioned** to play a leading role
in]{.underline} the development of the GEI and other **[[super
grids]{.underline}]{.mark}** if they are adopted.

[China is]{.underline} also [poised to **steer**]{.underline} and manage
the [**governance** structures of]{.underline} the GEI or other [super
**grids**]{.underline} if they are adopted. China controls two key GEI
governance bodies: GEIDCO and GEI-relevant SDOs. In addition, [China's
SOEs exert **influence** over]{.underline} some
**[non-Chinese]{.underline}** electricity [companies]{.underline}.
Although China's influence over these bodies would not necessarily
guarantee the adoption of the GEI, [[it would]{.underline}]{.mark}
[certainly]{.underline} [[serve Beijing's **interests**
if]{.underline}]{.mark} the GEI or other [[**super grids** were
adopted]{.underline}]{.mark}.

However, [[China's success in]{.mark} realizing [its

track**]{.underline}]{.mark} with GEIDCO's vision, the
**[[rollout]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the first stage of the GEI
[[is]{.mark} still [relatively **slow**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Implementation of the second and third phases of the initiative remains
the key challenge, as several barriers stand in the way of the
development of GEI cross-border interconnectors. Therefore, despite its
ambitions and capabilities, China's [[GEI is **not** a **foregone**
conclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**It'll create long-term [energy dependence]{.underline} on China

CONCLUSIONS ON THE **[GLOBAL GEI]{.underline}** **[SECURITY
RISKS]{.underline}** [OF THE]{.underline}

Dual-Use GEI and Huawei 2.0

[[Beijing could **leverage**]{.mark} the [GEI for **sabotage** or
**espionage**]{.mark}]{.underline} purposes
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**integration** of
**Chinese**]{.mark} [components in]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[foreign]{.mark}** power **[grids]{.mark}**]{.underline} along the
GEI. [[China has the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nical capacity [[to become the]{.mark}
**[provider]{.mark} of choice** [for]{.mark}]{.underline} the build-out,
modernization, and maintenance of [power **grids** connected to [the
**GEI**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is the global leader in UHV deployment,
[[having completed **34**]{.mark} domestic [**UHV**
lines]{.mark}]{.underline} when only four other UHV lines exist in the
world, two of which were built by China. [[China is]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[the]{.mark} global [**leader** in]{.mark}
**research**]{.underline} [and [**innovation** in GEI]{.mark}-enabling
**[tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline}, having cumulatively published
more than five times as many publications on GEI-enabling technologies
as the United States. Beyond the technical realm, China punches above
its weight in terms of representation in GEI-specific TCs and SCs in
standards-setting organizations. As a result of China's know-how and
price competitiveness, its products and standards increasingly penetrate
foreign power grids. Chinese materials and equipment make up between 80
percent and 100 percent of some power lines in Pakistan, Ethiopia, and
Kenya. [[The increasing **preponderance** of
Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} [[equipment and
standards]{.underline}]{.mark} [[could **create long**-term]{.mark}
path]{.underline} **[[dependencies]{.underline}]{.mark}** [on Chinese
hardware and]{.underline} [**reinforce** China's position]{.underline}
as the provider of choice [to build]{.underline} future power grids and
[the **GEI**]{.underline}. As has been noted in the recent debate on the
role of Chinese telecoms firm Huawei in Western 5G infrastructure, the
risk is that [[China's authorities might
**leverage**]{.underline}]{.mark} these [[civilian components for
**military purposes**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This might be possible
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the integration of [[**Huawei**
components]{.underline}]{.mark} in Chinese projects and the close links
that the creator of the GEI, State Grid, has with China's party-state
and military. [[One]{.underline}]{.mark} corridor that could be the
**[[target]{.underline}]{.mark}** of espionage efforts [[is
the]{.underline}]{.mark} future [**[Saudi]{.mark}**
Arabia--**[Ethiopia]{.mark}**]{.underline} power [transmission
[channel]{.mark}]{.underline} [passing [through
**Djibouti**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[where]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[France]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[Italy]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[Saudi]{.underline}]{.mark} Arabia, [[Spain]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[K]{.underline}]{.mark}ingdom,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[have]{.mark} **military
[bases]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

New Interdependencies, COSCO 2.0, and Parallels with Russia and Gas

In the event of a war, China is unlikely to weaponize the GEI in the way
that Russia has leveraged the dependency of some European countries on
natural gas imports to pressure them to make concessions in Ukraine.
Although Russia is a supplier of natural gas and can limit supplies,
China's integrated role in the GEI would make it harder for China to
weaponize the GEI without harming itself. However, [[the GEI
could]{.underline}]{.mark} drastically [[**reduce** strategic energy
**autonomy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and Beijing could]{.underline} still
[use]{.underline} new [interdependencies]{.underline} built through the
GEI [[to **strong-arm**]{.underline}]{.mark} partner [[countries into
supporting its **positions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among other tools,
including legal means, [China's]{.underline} ownership and [**control**
of]{.underline} foreign [electricity]{.underline} systems [offer a
potential avenue for **coercion**]{.underline}. Chinese players benefit
from large shares in electric transmission and distribution companies in
Brazil, Cambodia, Chile, Greece, the Philippines, Portugal, Spain, and
now Oman, where, by acquiring 49 percent of Oman Electricity
Transmission Company, State Grid has gained influence over 98 percent of
the country's electricity transmission. These strategic investments are
not unlike those of COSCO in such European ports as Piraeus and Hamburg
and therefore call into question the potential new dependencies and
overreliance on China that might emerge in energy security.

Other Criticisms and BRI-like Effects

The GEI is a component and an extension of the electricity sphere of the
Green BRI. Criticisms of the BRI might extend to the GEI, including the
possibility of the GEI (1) raising recipient countries' debt to
unsustainable levels (i.e., creating a debt trap, especially in
developing economies), (2) sustaining corruption practices, (3)
negatively affecting environmental ecosystems, and (4) strengthening the
exportation of China's law enforcement practices and power projection
capabilities to protect GEI transmission corridors and Chinese overseas
workers against external threats.

Despite the initiative's flaws and risks, [[the **attractiveness** of
the GEI]{.underline}]{.mark} (even a second-rate one built with
suboptimum parts) to recipient countries [[should **not** be
**discounted**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For many developing countries,
[[the short-term]{.underline}]{.mark} political and socioeconomic
[[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} of China's offer might well
**[[outweigh]{.underline}]{.mark}** the long-term risks (e.g., sabotage,
espionage, and loss of sovereignty). [[In the **absence**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[better]{.underline}]{.mark}** or
more-affordable **[[alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the GEI,
[this]{.underline} dynamic [deserves]{.underline} particular
[attention]{.underline}, as [[it could]{.underline}
**[limit]{.underline}**]{.mark} the reach and impact of [[**Western**
messaging]{.underline}]{.mark} strategies [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
potential challenges and [[**risks** raised by the
GEI]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It might]{.underline}]{.mark} also further
[[**fracture** the world]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**between** the
countries that]{.underline}]{.mark} "want to and can" and those that "do
not want to and cannot" [[**decouple** from China]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### REMS are critical to U.S. national security and equipment, but China currently has dominance in the sector and leverages it to distort economies.

National Defense, "Rare Earth Elements Aren't That Rare, but They're
Vital to National Security," The Heritage Foundation, 2-26-2021,

For one-third of the **[price of one F-35 Lightning II]{.underline}**,
the **[Pentagon made a [key investment to ensure]{.mark} its [supply of
rare earth elements]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Department of Defense
earlier this month announced that Lynas USA LLC was awarded a \$30.4
million technology investment agreement under Title III of the Defense
Production Act. With that award, Lynas will construct and begin
operating a light rare earth elements processing facility in Hondo,
Texas. The recent announcement from the Pentagon serves as an
**[important milestone and reminder of the ground
gained]{.underline}**---and left to be won---**[in the effort to
[secure]{.mark} a reliable [rare earths supply chain]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} the [U.S. defense]{.mark} industry.]{.underline}** Few
Americans could name even one of the **[17 arcane [rare earth
elements]{.mark}.]{.underline}** According to the American Geosciences
Institute, [**those substances are [components to]{.mark} more than [200
products]{.mark}, such as [cellphones]{.mark}, flat-screen [monitors,
lasers]{.mark}, and [sonar systems]{.mark}. With [wide-ranging
applications]{.mark}**, materials like cerium, lanthanum, and samarium
**may be [found in]{.mark} everyday [commercial
products]{.mark}.**]{.underline} More importantly to the Pentagon, they
**[are also [vital components of defense systems key to]{.mark} American
[military]{.mark} supremacy. Rare earth elements are [used in]{.mark} a
wide range of items: [communications equipment, precision-guided
weapons, night-vision goggles]{.mark}, and [stealth technology,]{.mark}
to name a few.]{.underline}** The many uses of rare earth elements raise
an important question: [Can the U.S. military and its partners depend on
the supply chains for these materials?]{.underline} Despite promising
changes in the industry, the [answer today is still
complicated]{.underline}. The risk to the Defense Department's rare
earth elements supply chain is not due to a lack of the minerals
themselves. While their name implies that producing refined rare earths
requires a lucky deposit on domestic soil, **[unrefined caches of rare
earths exist abundantly in several places around the world, including
the U.S. Mining and processing facilities for these rare earth elements,
however, are [not]{.mark} as [easy to find]{.mark} [outside of
China.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The Rand Corp. describes the key issues
with rare earths as "less about the materials themselves and more about
where the materials are produced and processed." **[Today, an estimated
[85% of]{.mark} the global [rare earth]{.mark} oxide supply is [produced
in China]{.mark}. Historically, because of [market
domination]{.mark},]{.underline}** individual producers of specific
materials, such as China and Chile, can temporarily **[[sway market
prices]{.mark},]{.underline}** causing disruption that free markets
eventually correct, **[but not without [doing damage to time-sensitive
defense programs]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In the past, **[[China]{.mark}
has attempted to [use]{.mark} its [dominance]{.mark} in this sector [for
geopolitical gain]{.mark}.]{.underline}** During a flash in tensions
over the disputed Senkaku Islands in 2010, China **[unofficially
[imposed]{.mark} rare earth elements [export limits]{.mark} against
Japan.]{.underline}** That caused the price of rare earths to surge from
\$9,461 per metric ton in 2009 to a stunning \$66,957 per metric ton in
2011. In response to that supply shock, other countries established rare
earth elements processing capabilities, the market eventually
rebalanced, and China lifted its export controls by 2015. That incident
demonstrated that free markets correct distortions in the rare earth
elements sector, as they would any other sector. But **[[defense]{.mark}
programs [cannot afford]{.mark} the [disruption]{.mark} that comes with
market realignment.]{.underline}** Developing capacity and capability in
rare earth elements mining and processing takes years, and programs like
the F-35 and the Virginia-class submarine (which requires a whopping
9,200 pounds of rare earth materials) [are [too vital]{.mark} to our
national defense to wait that long.]{.underline} [Pentagon and
Department of Energy grants have invested in processors and producers
setting up shop in Texas and reopening the U.S.' primary rare earth
elements mine in Mountain Pass, California.]{.underline} Even with the
U.S. mining ores again, without beginning domestic processing, unrefined
material must be processed overseas and is primarily processed in China.
[Part of why China continues to process rare earths mined from U.S. soil
relates to the environmentally risky---and, therefore, highly
regulated---methods for producing refined rare earth
elements.]{.underline} In the past, companies such the Colorado-based
Molycorp have unsuccessfully tangled with meeting high standards in rare
earth elements production. Reconciling environmental regulations with
the vulnerable state of that supply chain will be a continuing issue.
The Pentagon's recent announcement on the Lynas award should remind
policymakers that, in the rare earth elements sector, there is a limited
but vital role for government to play in ensuring defense programs have
access to the materials they need, including (and especially) in moments
of geopolitical crisis. Government investment made in the sector,
including two grants issued from the Department of Energy and the
Department of Defense in the past year, will help to create the supply
security that in turn promotes our national security. The global
commercial market for rare earths has weathered geopolitical storms in
recent years, and it can do so again, without government intervention.
But the public investment made in **[[rare earth
elements]{.underline}]{.mark}**---small relative to the Defense
Department's annual budget---**[will have a [big impact in]{.mark}
[ensuring]{.mark} the warfighter is [equipped to defend the
U.S.,]{.mark} its [allies,]{.mark} and its interests in the midst of
such storms.]{.underline}**

#### US defense currently depends on Chinas supply chain -- BUT supply chain unsustainable

On Air Force fighter jets, **[magnets made of rare earth
minerals]{.underline}** that are mined or processed in China are needed
to **[start the engines and provide emergency power]{.underline}**. On
[precision-guided ballistic missiles]{.underline} favored by the Army,
[magnets containing Chinese rare earth materials rotate the tail fins
that allow missiles to home in on small or moving targets]{.underline}.
And on new electric and battery-powered drones being adapted by Marines,
[[rare earth magnets are irreplaceable]{.mark} in the compact electric
motors. **[China's]{.mark} decision to [retaliate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
against President Trump's sharp increase in tariffs by ordering
restrictions on the exports of a wide range of critical minerals and
magnets **[[is a warning shot]{.mark} across the bow of American
national security, industry and defense experts said.]{.underline}** In
announcing that it will now require special export licenses for six
heavy rare earth metals, which are refined entirely in China, as well as
rare earth magnets, 90 percent of which are produced in China, Beijing
has reminded the Pentagon --- if, indeed, it needed reminding --- that a
**[wide swath of [American weaponry]{.mark} is [dependent on
China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "This decision **[is [hugely
consequential]{.mark} for our national security]{.underline}**," said
Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program
with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Beijing, by
beginning with what one Air Force official called a "heads-up" shot
meant to signal how much more harm it could inflict should it choose,
has left itself plenty of room to escalate. Beijing could also move on
from the licensing restrictions to impose tariffs, quotas or even an
all-out ban. Rare earths are a group of 17 elements, including
neodymium, yttrium, scandium and dysprosium, that are difficult to
separate into usable forms. They are not actually rare at all but can be
difficult to extract from the earth, and the process of mining and
refining them into usable form carries substantial environmental costs.
[They are [present in]{.mark} almost every form of American defense
technology.]{.underline} They can form very powerful magnets, for use in
[[fighter jets, warships, missiles, tanks and
lasers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yttrium is required for high-temperature
jet engine coatings; it allows thermal barrier coatings on turbine
blades to stop aircraft engines from melting midflight. According to the
Defense Department, every F-35 fighter contains around 900 pounds of
rare earth materials. Some submarines need more than 9,200 pounds of the
materials. Across the American defense industry, aerospace and weapons
companies have small stockpiles of the rare earths --- the industry term
for the 17 elements. That is enough, defense industry analysts say, to
meet their needs for months rather than years. The Pentagon also has
stockpiles of some rare earths, but those **[reserves are [not enough to
sustain defense companies]{.mark} indefinitely, one official
said.]{.underline}** While the Pentagon and defense industry companies
have some stockpiles of rare earths, those reserves would meet the
American defense industry needs for months rather than years.
"**[[China]{.mark} mines and [refines]{.mark} most of the world's [rare
earths]{.mark}, and [dominates]{.mark} the [downstream supply
chain]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Aaron Jerome, a trader at Lipmann
Walton and Co., a metals trading company based in Britain. **[That
supply-chain dominance allows [Beijing]{.mark} some [say]{.mark} over
just how much [weaponry]{.mark} that is [dependent on the rare
earths]{.mark} will cost, giving it [enormous power over America's
defense]{.mark} industrial base.]{.underline}** Mr. Jerome pointed to
what he called "the F-35 magnet debacle." Back in 2022, the Pentagon
temporarily stopped deliveries of Lockheed Martin's F-35 after the
manufacturer acknowledged that an alloy made in China was in a component
of the stealth fighter jet, violating federal defense acquisition rules.
At the time, the Pentagon said a magnet containing the alloy used in
part of the integrated power package posed no security problem. But just
one month later, the Pentagon allowed the deliveries to continue while
it looked for another source for the magnets. [Wherever the magnets are
coming from now, some component of it is controlled by [Beijing's lock
on the supply chain]{.mark}]{.underline}, Mr. Jerome said. With Beijing
now [requiring that its exporters of rare earths first receive express
permission]{.underline} from the government before sending the material
to the United States, [[American]{.mark} defense [companies]{.mark} may
[see prices shoot up]{.mark} soon]{.underline}, industry experts said.
As recently as the 1980s, the United States was a leader in rare earth
production, through the Mountain Pass mine in California. But by 2002,
**[[Mountain Pass]{.mark} had [shut dow]{.mark}n, with [China
dominating]{.mark} the [market]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Mountain Pass is
now owned by MP Materials and is operating again, but it does not come
close to Chinese production, industry experts said. The Aerospace
Industries Association, representing defense contractors, two years ago
called again for the United States to shore up its minerals supply chain
to better secure access for the industry. "U.S. global leadership in
aerospace and defense hinges on a secure and resilient supply chain ---
particularly for the critical minerals used in the production of
cutting-edge aircraft technology," Eric Fanning, the organization's
president, said at the time. China has **[[flexed]{.mark} its
[muscle]{.mark} over the rare earth supply chain in the
past]{.underline}**. In 2010, [[Beijing halted rare earths trade]{.mark}
with Japan]{.underline} following Japan's detention of a Chinese fishing
trawler captain. The Chinese move caught the attention of the United
States, alerting it to the threat posed by China's control over the
minerals' supply chain. In 2017, during his first term, Mr. Trump signed
an executive order aimed at boosting U.S. domestic production, and
President Joseph R. Biden Jr. followed suit during his administration,
allocating even more money for rare earth extraction and refinement
facilities. The Pentagon has been adding to its stockpile since the 2010
episode involving Japan, and "we have more of a stockpile than we did 15
years ago," said Dan Blumenthal, senior fellow at the American
Enterprise Institute. But, he added, "that will not last long enough."
**[[American defense]{.mark} companies, he said, "[should be very
worried]{.mark}."]{.underline}** There is historical precedent for the
United States' finding alternatives to crucial elements and minerals
during wartime. In World War II, German U-boats sank many Allied cargo
ships carrying bauxite from Suriname. "**[We would potentially have lost
the war if we did not get alternative sources for
bauxite]{.underline}**," said Seth G. Jones, author of the upcoming book
"The American Edge: The Military Tech Nexus and the Sources of Great
Power Dominance." The United States turned to Arkansas and built a large
stockpile of bauxite, used to build airplanes, from mines there.

international market. [[REMs]{.mark}]{.underline} are controversial:
while they [[contribute to]{.mark} the achievement of global goals
regarding **[sustainable development and climate change
resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline}, their mining and extraction can cause
disastrous consequences for the natural environment. Thus, a balance
should be found in the process of their production. [Russia has
considerable REM reserves that can turn the country into a truly global
supplier]{.underline}, which makes the issues of the industry\'s
transformation particularly relevant and important. However, despite the
government\'s ambitious targets and priorities concerning this sector,
new deposits are not being exploited, and the country is not
self-sufficient throughout the production chain as the level of import
dependence reaches 80--90%. The goal of the study is to design an
industrial policy for the sustainable development of Russia\'s REM
industry. The study is based on the standard research methods of
analysis, synthesis, and decomposition, also using strategic analysis,
planning tools, and roadmapping techniques. The study analyzes Russia\'s
REM industry along with its challenges, threats, and opportunities and
proposes a novel vision of its long-term sustainable development based
on four pillars, namely economics, R&D, ecology, and society. As a
result, the key goals and principles of the industrial policy are
formulated, and an industrial policy roadmap for the sustainable
development of Russia\'s REM industry is suggested. The paper provides a
taxonomy of REM projects to analyze government support measures and
ensure the industry\'s sustainable growth and development. [[In light of
the global energy transition, the current climate agenda, green
initiatives]{.mark}, rapid growth in the electronics industry, and
digital transformation, the role of rare-earth metals ([REMs) is
becoming]{.mark} more and more [noticeable]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baldi
et al., 2014; Dominish et al., 2019; Gielen, 2021). [These metals are
needed in the aerospace industry, microelectronics manufacturing,
aviation engineering, engine building, the nuclear power
sector]{.underline}, and shipbuilding (Dushyantha et al., 2020). They
are required to produce tracking control and positioning systems,
electric motors, and so forth (Polyakov et al., 2021). Most of the
increase in demand is accounted for by the group of heavy metals, which
consists of dysprosium (Dy), neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), and
terbium (Tb). [[These elements are part]{.mark} and parcel [of
progressive technologies]{.mark} such as permanent magnets, electric
vehicles, and wind turbines]{.underline} (Bailey et al., 2017).
[According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, [to
implement]{.mark} a full-scale [transition to green
tech]{.mark}nologies, **[REM]{.mark} production [must grow]{.mark}
significantly**]{.underline} --- by more than 2500% for Dy and by 700%
for Nd --- in the next quarter-century compared to the current level
(Abraham, 2015).

#### We need to significantly increase REM production or Green Tech will fail

**Frederiksen 23** (Mads Qvist Frederiksen, President of the Arctic
Economic Council, April 14 2023. "If we want an energy transition, we
must have more mining."
https://arcticeconomiccouncil.com/news/if-we-want-an-energy-transition-we-must-have-more-mining/)

**[[We cannot get anywhere close to the quantity of required]{.mark} raw
[materials]{.mark} in a sustainable manner [unless developed countries
are]{.mark} also [pursuing mining opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The good news is that there is growing consumer demand for more supply
chain transparency, tighter environmental regulations, and labour
rights. This, combined with the strategic importance, may lead to more
mining in the Arctic. The first obstacle to overcome is the idea of
"NIMBY -- not in my backyard" or "Green colonialism" which some interest
groups are promoting. Some of the interest groups don't even live in the
front yard of the Arctic but believe that the region should be kept
separate from wider global development. I believe that when presented
with the options of where and how mining takes place today, and how it
could take place in the Arctic, this information could bring more people
together. [Local communities ultimately benefit from having a mine
close-by. They create new jobs and the supply and demand for supporting
services. In some parts of the Arctic, it is the mining companies that
construct and develop the infrastructure to improve the lives in the
north. For example, through investment in schools and renewable
energy.]{.underline} It was the demand for metal that drove
industrialization from approximately 1700 to 1900, followed by the
demand of new infrastructure and two world wars which led to the
development of modern materials. Subsequently, the growth of big science
and high-tech, combined with the rise of China from early 2000 has
resulted in not only an exponential increase in energy demand but also
in the demand for minerals. [The [production of copper, zinc and steel
has escalated drastically in the past 50 years.]{.mark} [By
2030,]{.mark} the 20 million project [EV charging points]{.mark}, that
are anticipated globally, [will consume 250% more copper than produced
today]{.mark}]{.underline}. Wood Mackenzie estimated in 2022 that 9.7
million tonnes (Mt) of new copper supply is needed over 10 years from
projects yet to be sanctioned, equivalent to nearly a third of current
refined consumption, if industry is to meet the Paris Climate Agreement
targets. [They also estimate that more than US\$23 billion a year will
be called for over 30 years, to deliver new projects under an
accelerated energy transition scenario. According to World Bank study
from 2017, **[we need to increase our production of nickel by 100%,
indium by more than 200%, and cobalt, lithium and graphite by more than
450]{.mark}**% no later than 2050 in order **[to reach our climate
targets]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The challenge is now that we have mined
our way through history, so the quality -- or the grade -- of the
minerals is getting worse at the surface. **[[We must dig deeper to
retrieve useful material.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [We must also use new
and innovative methods to find "hidden" or "blind"
deposits.]{.underline}

For, And Against The implementation/adoption of selective [harvesting
will be a]{.underline} **[boon]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [our
planet]{.underline}---**[supply]{.underline}** [the metals needed
to]{.underline} **[transition]{.underline}** [**to net-zero**, offset
the geopolitical risk associated with doing business with nondemocratic
nations]{.underline}, and contribute to a step-change in ESG performance
of the mining industry generally. I've spent 17 years in the mining
industry---which I joined as a young 20-something, passionate about
conservation and wanting to "influence from the inside"---to turn the
big, dirty ship that is the mining industry into a "force for good."
This isn't Pollyanna territory. [Sustainably harvestingthe
world's]{.underline} [critical metals is]{.underline} [with**in
reach**]{.underline}---[an outcome that would benefit the transition to
a green economy]{.underline}. We are seeing firsthand how
[technology]{.underline} [and AI can]{.underline} **[enhance
sustainability]{.underline}** [while providing the green economy
with]{.underline} the [critical metals]{.underline} it needs. Our
[selective harvesting]{.underline} [technology]{.underline} [joins
a]{.underline} **[growing body of innovations]{.underline}** [in the
metals and mining industry]{.underline}, including a range of
technologies that decrease emissions and waste and improve efficiency,
such as ore sorting, gathering metals from geothermal water, and
recovering metals from mineral tailings ponds. Like It Or Not, It's A
Consumer's Choice The Nation recently reported that [there
are]{.underline} **[limited options]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
[the supply of]{.underline} [critical metals for the green
economy,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[none]{.underline}** [of
them]{.underline} **[are good]{.underline}**. The article ended with the
extremely depressing statement that "the true burden of ... an electric
car or truck will be borne ... by the people and ecosystems unlucky
enough to be in or near the global supply chain that will produce it."
The reality is, vacuuming up the seafloor (and its metal resources) will
have significant impacts on the environment. But that doesn't mean the
conversation ends there. [Alternative harvesting techniques would
leave]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[ecosystems intact]{.underline}**
[and ensure]{.underline} [the preservation of]{.underline} **[seafloor
biodiversity]{.underline}**. If this can be achieved, [we]{.underline}
may [have a pathway to metal supplies that]{.underline}
[actually]{.underline} [accelerates the]{.underline}
**[transition]{.underline}** **[to net-zero]{.underline}** [and
addresses]{.underline}what seems to be the one consistent cry from
COP27---[that things aren't happening fast enough]{.underline}. [To
advance the net-zero journey, we need faster progress]{.underline}, and
that includes having an open-minded view on issues (like
[DSM]{.underline}) that [could]{.underline}, if implemented responsibly
and robustly, [be major]{.underline} [contributors]{.underline} [to the
global journey to **[net-zero]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And these need to
be discussed in a pragmatic way.

[[Renewable energy tech]{.mark}nologies such as batteries and solar
panels currently [depend]{.mark} primarily [on]{.mark} supplies of
[CM]{.mark} produced [from terrestrial mines]{.mark}. [In 1994]{.mark},
the [U.S.]{.mark} Geological Survey [predicted]{.mark} that the fate of
the [lithium battery market]{.mark} would largely [depend on]{.mark} the
success of [electric vehicles]{.mark} and whether the best type of
battery for powering them is ultimately a lithium battery.]{.underline}
This prediction has proven accurate over the past couple of decades, as
[annual world lithium [production]{.mark} has soared [from]{.mark}
approximately [5,600]{.mark} metric [tons in]{.mark} 19[94]{.mark} [to
85,000]{.mark} metric tons [in 2018]{.mark}--a [1400%
increase]{.mark}.]{.underline} Increased battery production has been the
chief driver of this surge. [[Over half]{.mark} of [the]{.mark} annual
current [world]{.mark} production of [lithium]{.mark} is [used
in]{.mark} the manufacture of [batteries]{.mark}. Similar
[trends]{.mark} of burgeoning demand are likewise [affect]{.mark}ing
markets for cobalt and certain [rare-earth elements due to]{.mark} the
heavy [use]{.mark} of these minerals [in renewable energy]{.mark} and
battery technologies.]{.underline} Annual world cobalt production has
jumped from 19,000 metric tons in 1995 to 140,000 metric tons in 2018,
with 80% of that production flowing to the manufacture of batteries[.
[Rare-earth elements production]{.mark} jumped [from 72,000]{.mark}
metric [tons in 1995 to 170,000 metric tons in 2018]{.mark}, and
[catalyst]{.mark} and [magnet products]{.mark} like those found in wind
turbines [account for 41% of]{.mark} today\'s rare-earth element
[use]{.mark}.]{.underline} In short, the pace of the global transition
to sustainable energy hinges on an available and secure supply of these
minerals. [The importance of effective policy making for CM is magnified
even more by the fact that CM-dependent industries in the [U.S.]{.mark}
are heavily **[reliant on importation]{.mark}** from a relatively small
number of countries.]{.underline} Norway, China, Japan, and Finland
collectively supplied over 61% of the cobalt consumed domestically in
2018. [[China supplies 80% of]{.mark} the nation\'s imported [rare-earth
elements]{.mark}. And lithium imports from [Argentina and Chile]{.mark}
account for [over 50% of]{.mark} the [lithium]{.mark} consumption in the
U.S. Accordingly, continued [access to]{.mark} the [minerals]{.mark}
critical to renewable energy **[depends on]{.mark}** an uninterrupted
[international supply]{.mark} chain.]{.underline}

### Renewables Solve Warming

#### Green Tech is mission critical to slow climate change

**WEC 23** (World Economic Forum, non-profit, nonpartisan, international
orgainization, Dec 1st 2023. "Why green tech's multiplier effect is
critical to achieving climate goals."
https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/12/green-tech-multiplier-climate-change-goals-cop28/)

[[Can the green economy support future growth while also helping ensure
our net-zero future]{.mark}? Simply, are goals for people, planet and
profit mutually inclusive?]{.underline} The idea is gaining widespread
acceptance as governments and businesses support and prioritize
sustainable investments, including those in technology, for positive
outcomes. [Worldwide, [energy transition targets]{.mark} alone have
[attracted a staggering \$1.34 trillion in government
allocations]{.mark} since 2020, according to the International Energy
Agency. Some \$130 billion in new government spending across the globe
was announced in the first half of this year. [The results of such
investments are already becoming apparent]{.mark}. Over the past year,
[the US Inflation Reduction Act has prompted companies to]{.mark} invest
more than \$270 billion in clean energy projects, which should [cut
emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels]{.mark} by 2030. In
[Europe]{.mark}, the REPowerEU Plan [has saved almost 20%]{.mark} of the
bloc's energy consumption, with 39% of electricity coming from
renewables, and [Asia Pacific attracted]{.mark} the most [new investment
in global renewable energy]{.mark} during 2022, accounting for \$356
billion of the sector's \$532 billion value.]{.underline} Yet, we need
to work faster, together, to keep global warming to the 1.5°C threshold.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates some [**[6
billion tonnes of carbon need to be removed from the
atmosphere]{.mark}**,]{.underline} a huge amount. [And we don't have
time to lose: the climate is already 1.1°C warmer, with July 2023
reporting the highest-ever ocean surface temperatures.]{.underline}
Leveraging green tech for sustainable gains: [Ensuring we stay on track
and realize **[a climate-neutral future hinges on a crucial catalyst:
green tech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline}. [[Advanced technologies]{.mark}
unlock sustainable gains at every level. Innovations in green tech
[support]{.mark} the [decarbonization,]{.mark} drive [use of fewer
resources, boost efficiency from existing industrial facilities and
cut]{.mark} carbon [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is before we
consider greenfield facilities, sustainable design and enhanced
circularity from resource sourcing to product disposal. Studies on the
impact of the US Inflation Reduction Act suggest that the investments in
new energy technologies have a knock-on 'multiplier effect' beyond
immediate outcomes too. Preliminary analysis from the Rhodium Group, a
research and analysis firm, shows that [[for every ton]{.mark} of CO2
[reduced within the US,]{.mark} an additional [2.4-2.9 tons]{.mark} of
emissions [are reduced outside the US]{.mark}]{.underline}. Leading
companies are driving innovation and value gains with complementary
technologies to support crucial decisions regarding sustainability. For
example, the energy and carbon digital twin, when paired with lifecycle
data and insights infused by artificial intelligence (AI), can enable
industrial businesses to monitor, analyse and optimize their operations
in new ways. Likewise, expanding workforce connectivity via shared data
and cloud-based working models can facilitate a fresh type of agile,
location-agnostic collaboration, which leads to a happier, more
motivated workforce. With access to collective data, these connected
teams are empowered to be productive and make better decisions for their
business and the environment.

**DFC**]{.underline} is an important step forward, and provides an
important new tool to support US companies abroad while enabling
strategic infrastructure projects, particularly in the context of the
Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy. However, it [is comparatively
**small**]{.underline}, and US industry and finance are finally guided
by free market principles, not state direction.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[should
promote an **alternative**]{.underline}]{.mark} vision, and one more
directly consistent [[with]{.mark} a [lower-carbon
**energy**]{.mark}]{.underline} system that the climate challenge
necessitates. Changing technology, both in terms of digitization and
energy storage, may be poised to provide one such vision.

[[With **falling costs** of]{.mark} power [storage]{.mark}]{.underline}
(whether batteries or thermal), [[and local **smart grid**]{.mark}

Total generation capacity of more advanced distributed models is still
small. At the end of 2018, planned and installed global microgrid
capacity stood at 19,575 megawatts (MW), with utility microgrids
accounting for 40 percent of new capacity. [North [America **leads** the
**microgrid** market in]{.mark} terms of [total
**capacity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, followed by the Asia-Pacific, where
utility microgrids are driven by lack of robust infrastructure.

Southern Asian geography is already conducive to microgrid application.
Mountainous terrain and islands are areas where energy poverty tends to
be concentrated, and where distributed generation-and-storage solutions
can already be significantly cheaper than grid expansion. Solar
Philippines has been spearheading unsubsidized solar-and-storage
mini-grids in island communities with equipment from Tesla, SEL
Construction, and Fronius International. In India, Tata Power has
partnered with the Rockefeller Foundation to launch the world's largest
microgrid developer, TP Renewable Microgrid, with a mandate to provide
clean power to nearly 5 million households with over 10,000 microgrids
in the next decade, and Singaporean consortium CleanGrid Partners
(comprised of Japan's Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, and local
partners) is poised to expand projects in the region. US firms like GE
Power and Tesla have been active partners with Southeast Asian
governments to provide mobile fast-power generators and electricity
storage. In a recent report, Wood Mackenzie expects the average
solar-plus-storage levelized cost of energy (LCOE) in the Asia-Pacific
to decrease 23 percent by 2023 to \$101 per megawatt hour (MWh), at
which point the figure in Thailand will fall below the average wholesale
electricity price there.

Policies like the introduction of net energy metering in the region are
helping to empower domestic, commercial, industrial, and agricultural
prosumers to sell locally generated energy to other customers or back to
the main grid, competing directly with traditional utilities and
grid-centric providers. Sophisticated microgrids can participate in
certain wholesale markets and leverage their assets to reduce costs.
Pushing the bounds of market design innovation in the United States by
supporting maximum distribution system operators (DSO) and then sharing
those lessons with allies through technical programs, can transform
wholesale markets while improving resiliency and local sustainability.

As battery and power storage costs fall, hybrid generator offerings from
US champions like Caterpillar and Cummins can form the core of
increasingly self-sufficient storage-plus-generation microgrids.

US companies are already leaders in distribution-level advanced
technologies, and models of microgrid development and financing. USAID
programs like Asia-EDGE, the Energy Utility Partnership Program, the
Energy Regulatory Partnership Program, and the Infrastructure
Transaction and Assistance Network (ITAN) can help to facilitate greater
integration for those technologies in Asia. In the region, Japan is an
ally and a market leader.

The technology itself is certainly not a panacea when it comes to
cybersecurity or competitive influence. Even where microgrids are not
attached to the grid, they can rely on sophisticated cloud-based
operations management. New technologies promise to make transactive
energy easier, empowering end users to produce and transact with each
other as well as with the utility. Yet distribution-level systems are
still susceptible to cybercrime, and consumer products are generally
less secure than industrial systems. Plus, Chinese players are quickly
catching up. In 2019, State Grid announced a new initiative to build
microgrids under the rationale of a non-wires alternative of its own, to
further its stated mission of providing reliable electricity to all
customers. This will bolster the growth of microgrids in China, but may
be bad news for outside vendors.

However, outside of China, [[countries with rising **demand**
and]{.mark} endemic **[budget constraints]{.mark}** [may soon have
**viable alternatives**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
large subsidized [[foreign]{.mark} state-[owned]{.mark}]{.underline}
power [[infrastructures]{.underline}]{.mark} to deliver cost-effective,
reliable, and sustainable electricity. Those alternatives may also help
to address political concerns of engaging in cross-border electricity
trade in order [[to **balance**]{.mark} national [electricity
**portfolios**]{.mark}]{.underline} that are increasingly marked by high
penetration of ever-cheaper variable renewable generation.

The need for transmission infrastructure is not going away, but by
promoting a model of variable renewable energy integration and grid
development that eschews the need for ever wider integrated power
networks, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[can address]{.mark} **[global
concerns]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} centralized [**grid management** or
**interdependence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Starting
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the low-hanging fruit, these technologies can
already provide **[[cost-effective]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [[reliable
**electricity**]{.underline}]{.mark} to address energy access and
development in isolated areas. As they mature, they will provide a local
solution for reliable renewable energy on a competitive basis with the
main grid in more and more utility-scale situations. A technological
future centered on local production, storage, and use advances [[a
**political model** for energy governance that]{.mark} also [adheres
to]{.mark} values of **local [independence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Despite current high production costs (Table 1), green hydrogen may
offer a path to sustainability through cost reduction facilitated by
several factors. **[[Electrolysis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
separates hydrogen and oxygen from water using electricity, [[is poised
for significant **cost decreases**]{.mark} [driven by **economies of
scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This will occur with
**expanded**]{.underline}]{.mark} renewable energy
generation ([[**solar** and **wind**]{.underline}]{.mark})
and electrolyzer manufacturing capacity. Additionally, [[**innovations**
in]{.mark} **[re]{.mark}**newable energy technologies [are]{.mark}
[**lowering** the **cost**]{.mark} [of green
electricity]{.mark}]{.underline}, the foundation of electrolysis.
Advancements in energy storage technologies address the intermittency
of renewable energy sources, ensuring uninterrupted hydrogen generation.
These advancements suggest green hydrogen production costs could reach
\$1.5/kg by 2050 \[53\], [[positioning it as a **competitive**]{.mark}
[and **sustainable alternative** to conventional]{.mark} sources of
[hydrogen]{.mark}]{.underline}. Transitioning to green hydrogen
production has the potential to significantly enhance sustainability and
reduce carbon emissions across sectors.

Hydrogen, as a rocket fuel, boasts a history spanning several decades.
Particularly, the synergistic combination of liquid hydrogen (LH2) and
liquid oxygen (LOX) has pervaded the realm of rocketry due to its
hallmark attributes of high energy density and efficiency \[15\]. Beyond
its role in propulsion, hydrogen finds application in life support
systems, as it can be conjoined with oxygen to engender potable
water for the sustenance of astronauts \[9\]. NASA has steadfastly
pursued research endeavors in hydrogen fuel cell technology for space
applications, manifesting a commitment spanning numerous years.
Notably, hydrogen fuel cells have found utility in spacecraft, including
the iconic Space Shuttle, where they provided a vital source of
electrical power and water for astronauts \[2\]. The private space
sector, exemplified by companies like SpaceX, has also ventured into the
realm of hydrogen for rocket propulsion. Noteworthy is SpaceX\'s
Starship, envisioned as a fully reusable spacecraft with consideration
for the utilization of methane and liquid oxygen in its engines,
although hydrogen remains a prospective option for future spacecraft
endeavors \[7\].

The landscape for hydrogen in space exploration has been transforming in
light of advances in renewable energy technologies and the concomitant
reduction in electrolysis costs, rendering green hydrogen increasingly
economically attractive for space applications. Nonetheless, the
historical perspective on space exploration has been characterized by
international collaboration rather than competitive fervor. Leading
space agencies, including NASA, ESA, Roscosmos, and others, routinely
engage in collaborative initiatives such as the International Space
Station (ISS), underscoring the collaborative ethos that has
traditionally defined space exploration endeavors \[3\]. In contrast to
historical space races driven by geopolitical and scientific motives,
the prospective role of green hydrogen in space missions is unlikely to
be cast as the central focus of a space race due to the collaborative
nature inherent to space exploration. Nevertheless, the ascendant
trajectory of green hydrogen in space applications is expected to unfold
as technology advances and sustainability takes center stage in the
calculus of space mission planning \[5\].

[[**Green** hydrogen]{.underline}]{.mark}, [distinguished by its
potential to **decarbonize** recalcitrant sectors]{.underline},
[[assumes **significance**]{.mark} [in the]{.mark} broader context of
**[energy transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Its utility extends to the
production of clean fuels tailored for industries hitherto challenging
to decarbonize, encompassing domains such as steel manufacturing,
shipping, and aviation \[22\]. Governments and corporate entities have
made substantial investments in green hydrogen, with numerous nations
establishing ambitious production targets and businesses channeling
billions of dollars into green hydrogen ventures. Nonetheless, the
pursuit of [[the green]{.mark} hydrogen energy [race is not
without]{.mark} its [impediments]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The **cost** of
**green** hydrogen]{.underline}]{.mark} [presently]{.underline}
**[[eclipses]{.underline}]{.mark}** that of
**[[gray]{.underline}]{.mark}** hydrogen produced via fossil
fuel routes, although this cost discrepancy is anticipated to diminish
as technology matures and production scales up \[54\]. [[An associated
challenge is the **paucity** of **renewable**]{.mark} energy
**[sources]{.mark}**]{.underline} [requisite for green hydrogen
production]{.underline}, although global renewable energy capacity is
experiencing rapid expansion. Furthermore, an infrastructure deficit
exists concerning the storage and transportation of green hydrogen, an

[**[Critical materials play a vital role in]{.mark} powering [modern

However[, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [faces challenges in
securing a reliable supply]{.mark} of these materials, which are
[essential for]{.mark} its economic competitiveness and [national
security]{.mark}]{.underline}. These materials include metals such as
lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, and graphite. They are essential
for the manufacturing of high-tech products like batteries,
semiconductors, magnets, and catalysts. With the increasing demand for
electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and advanced electronics,
[**[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates heavily [relies on critical
materials]{.mark}** [to drive innovation and maintain its global
economic competitiveness.]{.mark} The United States faces several
challenges in securing a stable supply of critical
materials]{.underline}. One major challenge is the concentration of
production in a few countries, primarily China. [[China]{.mark}
[dominates the global supply]{.mark} chain of critical materials,
accounting for a significant share of mining, processing, and refining
capacity.]{.underline} [This [dependency raises concerns]{.mark} about
supply disruptions, geopolitical risks, and market
manipulation.]{.underline} This problem is complex requiring a
multi-pronged approach to develop the best path forward. [Attention from
multiple agencies with private sector involvement is needed to address
issues including resource definition, recovery technology development,
recycling technologies, international relations, supply chain resilience
and improvements and, domestic resource development
policies]{.underline}. A successful outcome will necessitate a diverse
approach, strong collaborations, exchange of information and practices,
and perhaps most importantly, persistence. **[[Ensuring a

<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Present-at-the-Recreation.pdf>

[The system must]{.underline} also [be adapted to deal with]{.underline}
new issues that were not envisioned when the existing order was
designed. Foremost among these issues is [emerging and disruptive
technology, including **[AI]{.mark}**, **additive
manufacturing**]{.underline} (or **[[3D
printing]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [quantum computing]{.underline},
[**[genetic engineering]{.mark}**, **robotics**, [**directed energy**,
the]{.mark}]{.underline} Internet of things ([[**IOT**), **5G**,
**space**, **cyber**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and many others. Like other
disruptive technologies before them, [these innovations [promise]{.mark}
great [benefits, but]{.mark} also [carry]{.mark} **serious downside
[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, AI is already resulting in
massive efficiencies and cost savings in the private sector. Routine
tasks and other more complicated jobs, such as radiology, are already
being automated. In the future, autonomous weapons systems may go to war
against each other as human soldiers remain out of harm's way.

Yet, [AI is]{.underline} also transforming economies and societies, and
[generating new security challenges]{.underline}. Automation will lead
to widespread unemployment. The final realization of driverless cars,
for example, will put out of work millions of taxi, Uber, and long-haul
truck drivers. Populist movements in the West have been driven by those
disaffected by globalization and technology, and mass unemployment
caused by automation will further grow those ranks and provide new fuel
to grievance politics. Moreover, some fear that [[autonomous
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} systems will become "killer robots" that
select and engage targets without human input, and [[could]{.mark}
eventually **[turn on]{.mark} their [creators, resulting in]{.mark}
human [extinction]{.mark}**. The other technologies on this lisgt
similarly balance great potential upside with great downside risk. [3D
printing]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, can be used to "make
anything anywhere," reducing costs for a wide range of manufactured
goods and encouraging a return of local manufacturing industries.61 At
the same time, advanced 3D printers [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be
used by]{.mark} revisionist and [rogue states to print]{.mark} component
parts for advanced weapons systems or]{.underline} even
[[WMD]{.underline}]{.mark} programs, **[[spurring arms races and]{.mark}

**[e]{.mark}**ngineering [can]{.mark}]{.underline} wipe out entire
classes of disease through improved medicine, or [[wipe out]{.mark}

superbugs. [Directed-energy]{.mark} missile defenses [may]{.mark} defend
against incoming missile attacks, while]{.underline} also
**[[undermin]{.mark}ing [global]{.mark} strategic
[stability]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Perhaps [the [greatest risk]{.mark} to global strategic stability from

[risk]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[revisionist [autocracies]{.mark} may
[win the]{.mark} new [tech]{.mark} arms [race]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Throughout history, states that have dominated the commanding heights of
technological progress have also dominated international relations. The
United States has been the world's innovation leader from Edison's light
bulb to nuclear weapons and the Internet. Accordingly, [stability has
been maintained in Europe and Asia]{.underline} for decades [because the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its democratic
allies possessed a favorable economic and military balance of
power]{.underline} in those key regions. Many believe, however, that

### Defense Industry Declining

#### The defense industry is dying---only US-sourced REMs prevent security collapse

For decades, [free-trade ideology has dominated discussions about
manufacturing and economic development in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [even with respect to the defense industrial
base]{.underline}. Though [policies stemming from this ideology
have]{.underline} succeeded in generating great wealth for the U.S.
economy, they have also led to [a number of unintended consequences,
**including [the erosion of the]{.mark}** manufacturing segment of the
**[defense industrial base]{.mark}**.]{.underline} With new authorities
included in this year's defense authorization bill, however, the
Pentagon is well-equipped to reverse the decline in U.S. defense
manufacturing and to provide secure supply of crucial military
components for the future. [The Defense Department is]{.underline}, of
course, [unlike any private sector business]{.underline}. [It is
responsible for responding to unforeseen events worldwide and is also
[subject to]{.mark} threats and **[challenges]{.mark} that [no private
sector actor confronts]{.mark}**.]{.underline} A mistaken emphasis on
free-trade ideology and [a selective aversion to "picking winners and
losers,"]{.underline} however, has led to the false conclusion that [the
department,]{.underline} which [has [a budget larger than many]{.mark}
midsize European [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, cannot and should not
attempt to shape the commercial sector that supplies it. [This mindset
[has]{.mark} produced **[weak points]{.mark} in the supply chain**
[that]{.mark} potential [adversaries]{.mark} **have recognized and
[exploit]{.mark}ed**.]{.underline} A recent op-ed by retired Air Force
Gen. Hawk Carlisle, former commander of Air Combat Command, and current
president and CEO of the National Defense Industrial Association, argues
that [today's industrial base is vastly different than the one that
propelled the United States to military greatness in World War II and
throughout the Cold War.]{.underline} Even as defense spending increased
following 9/11, [[the defense industrial base has **continued to
shrink**]{.mark} and consolidate.]{.underline} This process was greatly
accelerated by budgetary uncertainty during the Obama administration. A
study on the impacts of budget sequestration by the Center for Strategic
and International Studies and the Aerospace Industries Association,
"Measuring the Impact of Sequestration and the Defense Drawdown on the
Industrial Base, 2011-2015," notes that [[**over 17,000** companies
**left** the]{.mark} defense industrial [base]{.mark} during those
years.]{.underline} This greatly reduced the scope of competition within
the industry and [left the defense supply chain [with **a large number
of single points of failure**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Looking at U.S.
industry more broadly, it is clear that while certain segments of
manufacturing output are doing well[, industries that supply defense
manufacturing have sustained deep declines in recent years.]{.underline}
The [[mining]{.mark} of non-fuel resources, for example, peaked in early
2006 and [has declined]{.mark} ever since]{.underline}. The decline in
textile production has been even more dramatic. At a time when the
economy is increasingly dominated by service businesses, both the
executive branch and Congress must take a hard look at the ideological
underpinnings driving our industrial policy. Thankfully, the 2017
National Security Strategy acknowledged the deeply troubling decline of
the defense industrial base. The document notes: "[[A healthy
defense]{.mark} industrial [base is **a critical element of U.S.
power**]{.mark} and the national security innovation base]{.underline}.
The ability of the military to surge in response to an emergency depends
on our nation's ability to produce needed parts and systems, healthy and
secure supply chains, and a skilled U.S. workforce. The erosion of
American manufacturing over the last two decades, however, has had a
negative impact on these capabilities and threatens to undermine the
ability of U.S. manufacturers to meet national security requirements."
One of **[[the best-known]{.mark} single [point]{.mark}]{.underline}**[s
**[of failure]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**in today's defense industrial
base [is the]{.mark} near sole-source [dependence on China for rare
earth elements]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Due to their unique
properties, [this select group of minerals is [essential for]{.mark} the
construction of much of the U.S. military's high-tech
[hardware]{.mark}]{.underline}, including everything [from radars to
night vision goggles.]{.underline} The lack of viable domestic sources
for the elements creates a significant strategic vulnerability. An
incident in 2010 shows just how dangerous this dependence can be. In the
midst of an international dispute over control of fishing waters,
[[China **abruptly cut off**]{.mark} **r**]{.underline}are
**[e]{.underline}**arth **[e]{.underline}**lement [[exports]{.mark} to
Japan, only resuming them a month later after Japan declined to
prosecute the Chinese ship captain involved in the
incident]{.underline}. Had the export restrictions continued, [the
impact]{.underline} on the Japanese high-tech industry [could have been
**catastrophic**.]{.underline} Concerningly, there are indications that
[China may try to use the export [of critical **raw materials to gain
geopolitical leverage**]{.mark} over the United States.]{.underline} At
a public forum in Beijing in September, China's former finance minister
Lou Jiwei reportedly told an audience that China could restrict exports
of core items for the U.S. manufacturing supply chain. This speech was
after the Communist Party's People's Daily printed a story stating:
["**We are looking forward to** a more beautiful counterattack [and will
keep **increasing the pain** **felt by the
U.S**]{.mark}**."**]{.underline} [This statement is an important
reminder that our strategic materials vulnerabilities are
real]{.underline}, and our senior government officials must heed this
call to action to build on the advances made this year. Thankfully,
government policy is rapidly changing to create a more secure industrial
base, highlighted by efforts to create a more favorable business climate
to sustain potentially low-volume, high priority production of key
materials. This process started with a number of executive orders issued
by the administration. For instance, Executive Order 13806, "Assessing
and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and
Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States," mandated a comprehensive
study of the defense industrial base. Likewise, Executive Order 13817,
"Presidential Executive Order on a Federal Strategy to Ensure Secure and
Reliable Supplies of Critical Minerals," initiated an intra-governmental
strategy to end U.S. reliance on foreign suppliers of 35 critical
mineral commodities. The push to secure the defense industrial base was
advanced greatly by the recently-passed National Defense Authorization
Act. For example, section 871 of the NDAA prohibits the Defense
Department and its contractors from acquiring certain sensitive
materials, including rare earth magnets, from non-allied foreign nations
including China, Russia and Iran. Once fully implemented in regulations,
this language will help catalyze a resurgence in U.S. domestic
production of critical minerals and components. As production scales up
under the stimulus of steady demand, downstream consumers of these
products are likely to find that U.S. producers can outcompete foreign
suppliers on both price and quality. As it reviews the results of the
administration's industrial base study, Congress should consider adding
more materials to the list in future years. This year's NDAA, coupled
with sustained attention from the executive branch, is the best thing to
happen to the defense industrial base in years. However,
[[Congress]{.mark} and the executive branch [**must do more** to get
this vital sector on solid footing]{.mark} for the era of renewed great
power competition]{.underline}. As Congress gears up for the next
authorization act, it should use the recently-released executive branch
assessment of defense industrial base vulnerabilities as a template for
action. [The report highlights numerous single points of failure in the
defense supply chain.]{.underline} Though some can be fixed through
executive branch action alone, [others will require legislative
support.]{.underline} First, Congress must increase funding for the
programs that directly support the industrial base, including Defense
Production Act purchases, Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment and
Manufacturing Technology. Second, Congress needs to provide targeted
relief from regulatory restrictions applicable to key industries that
support the defense industrial base. For example, [language]{.underline}
included in the original House-passed version of the NDAA, introduced by
Rep. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., [would have sped the mine-permitting approval
process for strategic and critical mineral projects.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, this language lacked sufficient support in the Senate and
was stripped out in conference. [Without such language, **a revival in
the defense industrial base will be significantly
delayed**.]{.underline} In addition to addressing specific areas of
concern such as mine-permitting reform, another area where Congress
could be helpful is in addressing the substantial overlap in regulations
at the federal, state and local levels. Many regulations, which pertain
to areas such as worker safety and environmental health, are duplicative
and add no real value. They do, however, substantially increase costs.
These are felt most strongly by smaller producers who lack the economies
of scale necessary to afford an office of full-time compliance
specialists. By working in a collaborative manner, Congress can help
reduce this overlap and thereby improve the business environment for
small- and medium-sized producers. Third, Congress should encourage the
use of long-dormant tools such as loan guarantees and conversion of key
facilities to government-owned, contractor-operated centers of
excellence for low volume, but critical, strategic materials like
specialty chemicals. The authorities for these types of projects already
exist --- they are present to some extent in programs such as the
Defense Production Act and Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment
program --- however, Congress needs to increase funding for them to be
effective. Finally, Congress should continue to include domestic
sourcing requirements in future bills, recognizing that the inherent
market demand to drive lowest cost production may not always be in our
national security interest. This year, the government made significant
progress in addressing a number of strategic vulnerabilities. Even more
welcome, there appears to be a growing consensus that the free-market
mindset that has worked well in other policy areas is not optimal for
the defense sector. [Support for the defense industrial base has been,
and should continue to be, an area of bipartisan agreement]{.underline}.
In the years ahead, Congress and the administration should work together
to find additional ways to strengthen the defense industrial base.

[[In the ongoing tariff war with]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [China]{.mark} has [imposed]{.mark} export [controls
on]{.mark} several [r]{.mark}are-[e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lements ---
including dysprosium, neodymium, dysprosium, and yttrium --- [which are
**critical for tech**]{.mark}nological
**[advancements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is a powerful tool, and
China could use it to strengthen its position in trade negotiations with
the US. Neodymium, iron, and boron are combined to form magnets that can
withstand temperatures up to 2,800 degrees Celsius. [[These]{.mark}
magnets [have a wide range of]{.mark} applications across emerging
[**technologies like drones, robots, missiles, aerospace,** **defence
equipmen**t]{.mark}, electric vehicles, semiconductors, computers,
mobiles, [and wind turbines]{.mark}. Dysprosium]{.underline} can
sometimes replace neodymium in magnets. These magnets are 12 times
stronger than ferrite magnets, which are commonly used in household
refrigerators. Their use in drones, robots and other equipment is
essential for improving torque and speed, thereby enhancing precision
and efficiency. Another category of samarium cobalt magnets are eight
times more powerful than ferrite magnets[. [To counter China's dominance
over]{.mark} rare and critical [earth minerals]{.mark},
**[Washington]{.mark}** has been actively **[sourcing supplies
from]{.mark}** across the globe---from **[the
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}and Greenland to Ukraine. Even
amid the ongoing war with Russia, Ukraine was pressed to sign a mineral
deal with the US. Washington has reduced its rare-earth imports from
China from 80% in 2017 to around 70% today. India's State-owned Rare
Earths Limited was under US sanctions for nearly a decade. These were
lifted by President Biden shortly before he left office. During Prime
Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Washington during Trump's second term,
the administration announced the US-India 'strategic mineral recovery'
initiative to jointly mine and process critical minerals. Meanwhile,
China has made significant advances in drone technology, including the
ability to transport goods weighing up to one ton. The traditional
approach to goods transportation and highway development is becoming
outdated. Increasingly, road widening proposals threaten large-scale
deforestation in ecologically sensitive zones such as the Western and
Eastern Ghats and the Northeast and Himalayas[. **[Drone-based
transport]{.mark}** can help **[avoid]{.mark}** such **[ecological
damage]{.mark}**, [preserving forests']{.mark} carbon sequestration
potential --- [a **crucial buffer against climate change**]{.mark}.
[Drones have also become weapons of choice]{.mark}, as seen recently in
Operation Sindoor. These [drones evaded radar detection by flying at low
altitudes and destroyed terrorist infrastructure]{.mark}. [Every
nation]{.mark} now [has to]{.mark} innovate and [upgrade drone
electronics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Initially, Russian forces jammed
Ukrainian drones. In response, Ukraine developed cable drones that
transmitted signals via optic fibre instead of electromagnetic waves,
rendering them immune to jamming. Such skills are also developed in
India, which has helped in dismantling terror infrastructures in
Pakistan as well as hitting air bases deep inside during Operation
Sindoor. China's own domestic drone manufacturing faced significant
setbacks when Beijing imposed restrictions on rare-earth extraction and
separation. These restrictions extended to finished products like
neodymium-iron-boron magnets, which impacted domestic manufacturing of
semiconductors, automobiles and drones. To overcome this, China has
revoked the restrictions. After recent action by armed forces, China has
sought assurance from India that the magnets will not be used for
defence manufacturing and will not be re-exported to the US. However,
after the Director General of Foreign Trades, India issued a certificate
for each consignment, the import of magnets has resumed. Maruti Suzuki
had to delay the production schedule for the e-Vitara and has sought the
government's permission to import a complete assembly of components from
China in relaxation of the domestic value addition norm. [**[The
advancement in green tech]{.mark}nology** [is **key for bringing down
fossil fuel consumption** and arresting **further warming of the
planet.**]{.mark}]{.underline} The International Energy Agency has
recently cautioned against the concentration of critical minerals'
mining and processing in a few hands, as it not only can affect global
pricing and supply but can also impact green energy transition.
Diversification of mining, refining and processing of key critical
minerals is essential for preventing any supply chain disruption.

China's got them and could use them as leverage in the trade war with
the U.S.," NPR's Meghna Chakrabarti succinctly explained. Despite their
name, [rare-earth elements]{.underline} are not very rare. In fact, the
17 known rare-earth elements, all metals, are more common than precious
metals. The two rarest, thulium and lutetium, are 200 times more common
than gold. So why are they called rare? They [got that designation
because of the **difficulty** of finding them **in concentrations large
enough** to make them worth exploiting. Also, they require a lot of
energy to extract from the other minerals they are found with and to
process them.]{.underline} Each month, the United States mines between
3,300 and 4,400 tons of lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium,
promethium, samarium, europium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium,
holmium, erbium, thulium, ytterbium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium.
But, as Stephen Bryen wrote in the Asia Times, [China produces about 97
percent of rare-earth ore.]{.underline} Why Does the US Need Rare-Earth
Elements for Homeland Security? [Rare-earth elements are often added in
very small amounts to composites that allow them to interact and produce
results that neither element could do on their own. An example of
rare-earth elements mixing with other alloys to form key ingredients is
our military vehicles' impact-shattering protective armor. Rare-earth

The U.S. supply chain's weakness was decades in the making. Previous
decades of U.S. trade and economic policies that sought to bring China
into the global economy led to the U.S. investing in businesses or
processes that promised lower costs and minimal U.S. domestic
environmental disruption. [China's]{.underline}
**[imports]{.underline}** [of U.S.]{.underline} **[rare
earths]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline} [[U.S.]{.underline}
**[relying]{.underline}** [on China]{.underline}]{.mark} [for refining
ore disincentivized U.S. domestic industry and led to]{.underline}
**[offshoring]{.underline}** that [made the U.S.]{.underline}
**[dependent]{.underline}** [on rare earth finished products
from]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}** [instead of domestically
refining it]{.underline}.4 The U.S. dependence on China [created
unforeseen chains of]{.underline} **[cause]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[effect]{.underline}** [for U.S.
military]{.underline} **[industry]{.underline}** [when previously secure
supplies became subject to arbitrary restrictions.]{.underline} In [2021
Chinese]{.underline} **[restrictions]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}

[[impact]{.underline}]{.mark} [on]{.underline} [**[F-35]{.underline}**
[production]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}5 The Chinese efforts had
the [potential to slow production by preventing the manufacture or
installation of key parts that give the F-35 its long-range sensors and
enable it to engage enemies at maximum range]{.underline}. Modern
technology requires a full suite of components that together make up the
whole system. The impact of rare earth shortages, especially certain
varieties, can best be understood within the context of two examples:
gallium and germanium. The former is used for radar, communications,
satellites, and LEDs and the latter for night vision devices and
satellite imagery sensors. Domestic U.S. defense contractors can find
alternate sources and have reserves, but the [supply chain is endangered
by China's punitive trade]{.underline} [practices China's ban on rare
earth extraction and separation technologies announced on December 21,
2023 jeopardizes the production of the DoD's most advanced systems and
sensors]{.underline}. The ban will impact U.S. national security for

**[efforts]{.underline}** [over the past three years to]{.underline}
**[strengthen]{.underline}** [the U.S. rare earths supply chain and

amounts of rare earth elements required for each system vary from, "900
pounds for a F-35 to 9,200 for a Virginia class submarine." Factor in
night vision devices, range finders, lasers, optics, and fiber optics
systems and the potential vulnerability to these systems is evident.7
Then, add in the [potential impact on allies through joint weapons and

are further complicated by China's dominance over the world's refining
and production processes to include operating numerous mines outside of
China that China uses to meet internal needs.]{.underline} The U.S.
faces a situation with its domestic rare earths mining and processing
that China has exploited for decades as rare earth mining expanded in
China and contracted in the U.S. The U.S. has only a single rare earth
mine in fullscale operation at Mountain Pass, California.8 China, rather
than exhaust its rare earth deposits, is content to control the supply
chain by dominating the refining and production process at home, while
importing ore from elsewhere.9 This strategy exhausts deposits outside
of China and forces countries where mining take place to bear
environmental costs of rare earths mining. China has built redundant
domestic capacity for production and technical expertise and retains
rare earths deposits to sustain domestic operations. Should access to
some foreign deposits be denied, China's relationship with Russia and
partners in the "Belt and Road Initiative" that spans the globe will
likely ensure the flows to China continue unabated. [Given the potential
for economic]{.underline} **[coercion]{.underline}** [and policy
impacts, the United States and partners like Japan have tried to reduce
their reliance on Chinese sources since 2010, but the process has been
delayed by cost, environmental issues, and lack of domestic
capacity]{.underline}. Further, securing U.S. supply chains and
developing domestic refining processes was slowed by the global impact
of COVID-19, another unanticipated security threat.10 The DoD must
anticipate future advancements in military systems development as new
technologies and civilian demand for rare earths and strategic metals,
lithium for electric vehicle batteries, and chemicals vital to
alternative energy technology increase across the world. The DoD needs
to examine new ways to prioritize its strategic needs and those of its
partners across the U.S. whole-of-government and work closely with other
U.S. government agencies to establish the necessary agreements to
sustain those needs. The key to securing the U.S. Defense Industrial
Base and its supply chain is interagency cooperation. Interagency
cooperation creates the agreements that ensure foreign partners are
engaged and join the U.S. Defense Industrial Base (U.S. Department of
State) the protective screen that blocks cyberattacks and insider
threats (U.S. Department of Justice); reciprocal financial agreements
that make resource sharing profitable for all parties (Departments of
State and Commerce), and internal resource evaluation for exploitation
(U.S. Department of the Interior). [[Industrial base revitalization lies

[[As the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[hunts for critical
**minerals**]{.underline}]{.mark}---the materials underpinning vital
technologies ranging from electric vehicle batteries to advanced weapons
systems---an increasing number of U.S. [**lawmakers** from **both major
parties** are urging the Biden]{.underline} administration to take its
search under the sea.

The seafloor is home to an untapped bounty of mineral-rich formations
that mining proponents are eager to exploit---and soon. It's a highly
controversial idea that has sparked pushback from hundreds of
scientists, governments, and big automakers. But the proponents'
arguments have resonated with some lawmakers in Washington, where
[[**concerns** over China's]{.mark} critical **mineral** supply chain
[**dominance** are pervasive]{.mark}, and the [Biden]{.mark}
administration has been [**desperate** to slash]{.mark} **U.S.
[dependence]{.mark}** on Beijing]{.underline}.

"There is a growing interest in deep-sea mining for the simple reason
that they hope it would cut reliance on China," said Tom Moerenhout, an
expert at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.

The U.S. lawmakers' turn to deep-sea mining is part of Washington's
broader effort to secure alternative critical mineral supply chains
[[and **minimize**]{.mark} potential **[vulnerabilities]{.mark}** that
Beijing could take advantage of. [China **commands**]{.mark} the
processing]{.underline} and refining of many [of these minerals and
metals]{.underline}---including powerful rare earth elements---[[a
**dominance**]{.mark} that it has previously [**leveraged** to **hit
back**]{.mark} against other **powers**]{.underline}.

Yet even as U.S. interest grows, there's a major catch: No such deep-sea
mining industry exists, and key questions of technical and economic
viability loom over prospective operations.

On the regulatory side, commercial mining operations have been
prohibited in international waters until the International Seabed
Authority (ISA), the governing body established by the U.N. Convention
on the Law of the Sea, writes a mining code for the nascent
industry---an ongoing process that has been complicated by a raft of
tangled compliance, environmental, and financial questions.

And even if commercial mining operations do begin in international
waters, [[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}---which [**[never
ratified]{.mark}** the 1982 **[L]{.mark}**]{.underline}aw
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f the **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea Treaty
over concerns that it would face too many deep-sea mining
restrictions---can't take part in the scramble. [[Companies]{.mark} that
want to **mine**]{.underline} in international waters [[have to secure
a]{.mark} **state [sponsor]{.mark}** before applying [for]{.mark} a
mining **[license]{.mark}**. [Since]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[isn't]{.mark} a **[party]{.mark}** to the treaty, [it can't]{.mark}
**sponsor** license applications]{.underline}.

The issue flared in debates at the ISA's latest negotiations, running
from March 18 to March 29, when both China and Russia argued that the
United States' lack of ratification nullified its claims to an extended
stretch of the seabed, the Financial Times reported. The U.S. delegation
pushed back, but not being a member, it only has observer status and
thus less power.

[The fact that the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is
not a party]{.underline} to the treaty "just [means that we don't
participate **at all**]{.underline}," said Alex Gilbert, a researcher at
the Colorado School of the Mines. "It doesn't mean that we participate
on our terms, it just means that [we're **excluded**]{.underline}."

Washington is facing pressure to change its position. Last November,
U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono, Lisa Murkowski, and Tim Kaine reintroduced a
resolution urging the U.S. Senate to ratify the Law of the Sea Treaty.
Hirono and Kaine are Democrats; Murkowski is a Republican. And earlier
in March, nearly 350 former diplomats, officials, and military leaders,
including former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, signed a
letter to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations in which they echoed
the senators' calls.

"[We have [already lost two of]{.mark} our [four]{.mark} 'USA'
[designated]{.mark} deep seabed mine [sites]{.mark}]{.underline}," which
contain "minerals critical both for United States security dominance as
well as the transition to a greener twenty-first Century," the signers
wrote. They added that "\[c\]ontinued inaction on the Treaty means a
likely quick loss of our remaining two 'USA' designated sites," while
China and Russia have obtained more sites.

One day after the letter was released, Republican Reps. Carol Miller of
West Virginia and John Joyce of Pennsylvania introduced a bill in the
House, known as the "Responsible Use of Seafloor Resources Act," that
would task the Commerce Department and White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy with producing reports on legislation related to
seafloor mining as well as an analysis on the benefits of importing the
seafloor's resources and then domestically processing them.

"[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[**should not**
be beholden to China for]{.mark} critical
**[minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Miller said in a statement
accompanying the bill. "The Responsible Use of Seafloor Resources Act
will significantly reduce supply chain vulnerabilities and bolster
American manufacturing and jobs, while combatting Chinese production of
critical minerals."

The flurry of efforts comes months after a group of 31 Republican
lawmakers, led by Reps. Elise Stefanik and Rob Wittman, wrote a letter
in December urging U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to consider
[**[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining** as [a]{.mark} "[new
vector of **competition**]{.mark} with China]{.underline}" as part of
the Defense Department's mandate to make national defense supply chains
more resilient. The Pentagon has been working on a report assessing the
United States' domestic processing ability for the deep-sea mining
nodules.

Last week [[Beijing]{.mark} declared that rare earth metals]{.underline}
(**[REM]{.underline}**) [in China are the property of the
state]{.underline}, warning that "no organisation or person may encroach
on or destroy rare-earth resources". The country's [State
Council]{.underline} also [announced that]{.underline} from 1 October
[the government]{.underline} [would [operate]{.mark} a **traceability
[database]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to [ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that
it has **[full [control]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[over]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[extraction]{.underline}**,
**[use]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[[export]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the metals]{.underline}. Why?

First of all, remember that [this move follows a growing row between
**China and the US**]{.underline} [over]{.underline} the [increasing
numbers]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [cheap]{.underline}
[Chinese]{.underline} **[e]{.underline}**lectric
**[v]{.underline}**ehicle**[s]{.underline}** [starting to flood the
market]{.underline}. Last month the **[E]{.underline}**uropean
**[U]{.underline}**nion announced [tariffs of up to 48% on EVs made in
China]{.underline}, including those manufactured by MG, Volvo and BYD,
in a row over what the EU claims are unfair subsidies from Beijing. This
action was the result of a probe launched last year by the European
Commission that concluded European competitors were being harmed by
Chinese subsidies which allowed manufacturers to keep their costs
artificially low. China rejected the claim, arguing that its industry
has flourished naturally.

[REMs and EVs are **inextricably linked**]{.underline}, [so
it's]{.underline} almost [certain]{.underline} that [these two events
are **connected**]{.underline}. You can't make electric cars without the
use of many REMs. In fact, you can't make a huge number of things
without REMs. If you are reading this newspaper on a tablet or smart
phone, you will be holding up to 16 REMs in your hand. Among many
applications, REMs are used to make batteries and control systems in
EVs, red lasers in precision guided missiles, signal boosters in
trans-oceanic cables which make the internet possible, control rods in
nuclear reactors, magnets in wind turbines and are even used in the
treatment of lung cancer. The list goes on and on. [This is why there
is]{.underline} a **[brutal competition]{.underline}** developing
[between the]{.underline} [US]{.underline}, [China]{.underline},
[Russia]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [the EU]{.underline}
[over]{.underline} a small group of [REMs on which their economies
depend]{.underline}.

The curious thing about rare earths, those 17 chemical elements that
over the past decade have become extremely sought after by every
manufacturer, is that they aren't rare. Discovered in the late 1700s,
they are called "rare" because at the time no one had seen them before,
and "earths" because they were characterised as non-ferrous
metals---simply "earths". Just about every country has some form of REMs
somewhere in their subsoil, but it requires an enormous volume of rock
to extract just a small amount of metal. Thousands of tons of material
produces just a few kilos of REMs, so the challenge is to discover a
sufficient concentration to make its mining economically possible.

China tops the list of countries when measured by the volume of
production of REMs, producing in 2023 more than two thirds of the global
rare earth mine output. In a distant second place was the United States,
accounting for 12%, followed by Myanmar which produced 11%. Most of the
latter came from Kachin, the state on the border with China, so was in
effect the result of outsourcing by Beijing. Australia was fourth at 5%
with India at just under 1%.

[China's [dominance of the]{.mark} REM [industry]{.mark} has been **[no
accident]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Years of]{.mark} research and
industrial [policy]{.mark}]{.underline} [helped]{.underline} the country
[to develop a **superior position**]{.underline} in the market. [Now
[China]{.mark} has the ability to [control]{.mark}
production]{.underline} and the **[[global
availability]{.underline}]{.mark}** of these valuable metals. As a
result, [countries in the rest of the world are]{.underline}
**[desperately searching]{.underline}** [for their own
supplies]{.underline}, with the US and EU launching efforts to procure
REMs both at home and abroad.

[Because they occupy such a pivotal role]{.underline} in such a diverse
array of items, [[demand for REMs]{.mark} is expected to **[grow
exponentially]{.mark}** in coming years]{.underline}. Also growing
rapidly are concerns that [China may use its dominant position in REM
supply chains as political leverage]{.underline}. There are good reasons
for such anxieties. Here's one. [In **2010**]{.underline}, there were a
number of [[territorial disputes]{.underline}]{.mark}
[between]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Japan]{.underline}** [[over]{.mark} the sovereignty of]{.underline}
the uninhabited islands known as **[[Senkaku]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
Japan, **[Diaoyu]{.underline}** in China and Tiaoyutai in Taiwan. This
archipelago has been controlled by Japan since 1895 and is close to key
shipping lanes and rich fishing grounds.

China acquiesced to Japanese sovereignty until 1970, when the existence
of oil reserves surfaced and tensions between the two countries
increased. It was at this time that [[Beijing issued a warning]{.mark}
to Tokyo [that it might]{.mark} **[withhold REMs]{.mark}** as a form of
leverage]{.underline}. Market dynamics, however, appear to have lowered
the threat to Japan, but [there remains the real danger]{.underline}
that [China will leverage its control]{.underline} of REMs [to punish
nations]{.underline} over current and future political disagreements.

These [**[concerns increased]{.mark}** at the end of last
year]{.underline}, [[when]{.underline}]{.mark} [in]{.underline} a
[response to moves by the]{.underline} **[US and Japan]{.underline}**
[to reduce]{.underline} their [reliance on Chinese
suppliers]{.underline}, [[Beijing]{.mark} announced that there would be
a [ban]{.mark} on]{.underline} the [[exports]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
**[tech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline} [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} **[REM
[mining]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[ore [selection]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[refining]{.underline}]{.mark}**, having
already introduced export permits for chipmaking materials, gallium and
germanium, months earlier. "[This should be a **clarion
call**]{.underline} [that dependence on China]{.underline} for any part
of the REM value chain [is **not sustainable**]{.underline}", screamed
some western experts, calling for the US and its allies to establish
alternative supplies to safeguard against potential geopolitical
conflicts. Others took a more pragmatic view, arguing that as China has
become a prominent manufacturer of environmentally-friendly products,
such as electric vehicles, solar panels and advanced electrical
networks, all of which has resulted in a surge in domestic demand for
REMs, this has contributed to the country's ability to export rare
earths to other countries. In other words, Beijing is simply
safeguarding its economic interests rather than punishing other
countries.

Whatever the reason, there is little doubt that [manufacturing
[countries must]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[urgently
seek]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[alternative supply
chains]{.underline}]{.mark}** as their investments in the "green
revolution" accelerate. Following its territorial dispute with China,
Japan successfully shifted away from its dependence on China and instead
increased its reliance on sources based in Australia. Although this
created a more costly supply chain, Japan insulated itself from
geopolitical dynamics and potential prohibitions from an unfriendly
China.

### REMs Check China

#### The U.S. needs deep sea mining to check Chinese military exploitation

[[The ocean floor is shaping up to be the world's next theater of global

today's electronics, *clean-energy* products and advanced computer
chips. As countries race to cut greenhouse gas emissions, demand for
these minerals is expected to skyrocket. [[When deep-sea mining begins,
China --- which already controls 95 percent of the world's supply of
rare-earth metals and produces three-quarters of all lithium-ion
batteries --- will extend its chokehold over emerging industries like
clean energy. Mining will also give Beijing a potent new tool in its

#### Chinese rare earth monopoly threatens national security and the defense industrial base

The end of the Cold War led to a reduction in U.S. military spending and
a greater reliance on market forces (and private sector firms) to
support the defense industrial base. The foreign share of the defense
industrial base grew. Today, the defense industrial base is totally
reliant on foreign nations for the procurement of each of the following:
electronics (Department of Defense 2018); high-tenacity, military grade
polyester fiber (Department of Defense 2018); certain specialty
chemicals for munitions and missile use (Metal/Center News 2013);
proprietary carbon fibers used in missiles, satellites, space launches,
and other purposes (Department of Defense 2018); and image intensifier
tube core glass critical to U.S. night vision systems (Department of
Defense 2018). [A]{.underline} contemporary [national security problem
is U.S. dependence on strategic competitor nations]{.underline}--- those
nations (e.g., [Russia and China]{.underline}) [that aim to]{.underline}
upset the current international order and, more specifically, [undercut
U.S. global preeminence]{.underline}. According to the Department of
Defense (2018), this problem stems from two macroeconomic factors: (1)
the decline of U.S. civilian manufacturing base capabilities and (2) the
rise of competitor nations. The DOD report (2018) placed great emphasis
on China as the primary revisionist power threat to U.S. national
security via the defense industrial base. China's strategy of economic
expansion has for many years employed both legal and illicit means to
undermine free market principles and increase its global market share of
critical materials and technologies (United States Trade Representative
2018). As a result, [[the U.S. is dependent on China for]{.mark} many
[materials]{.mark} [**critical** to]{.mark} the health and function of
the [defense industrial base]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Rare earth minerals
represent a particularly significant example of U.S. dependence on
China]{.underline}. Indeed, [rare earths can be considered a
**critical** case study]{.underline} (Yin 1994) [of foreign
dependence]{.underline}---if the U.S. can successfully lower the
national security risk for this class of compounds, then it can
successfully manage other cases of foreign dependence that pose a
similar or less significant threat. This paper describes a discrete set
of policy options for increasing the resiliency of the U.S. defense
industrial base to supply shocks from China and a strategy formulation
process based on these discrete options. WHAT ARE RARE EARTHS? Rare
Earth Elements (REEs) are a set of 17 metallic elements (Figure 1) which
are abundant in number but occur in low concentrations in the Earth's
crust. Mining and refining REEs is economically costly; however, due to
their unique magnetic, luminescent, and electrochemical properties, rare
earths are responsible for breakthroughs in producing technologies that
are lighter, smaller, more thermally durable, and more efficient or
emissions friendly, among other improvements (Rare Earth Technology
Alliance 2018). Figure 2 lists modern-day products made from rare earth
elements. The largest segment of consumption for rare earth elements
(and fastest growing segment) is permanent magnets, which represent 31%
of global consumption in 2016 (Gayonnet 2018). Permanent magnets based
on rare earth elements are used in virtually all high-tech products
(e.g., smart phones and other electronics), including those used in
aerospace and defense applications. [[Ensuring]{.mark} that [the defense
industrial base has]{.mark} a secure and adequate supply of [rare earth
elements is a matter of]{.mark} [national security]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Between 2016 and 2017]{.underline}, [the United States did not mine any
rare earth elements]{.underline} [domestically]{.underline} after the
Mountain Pass mine in California was put on care and maintenance status
in the fourth quarter of 2015 (U.S. Geologicial Survey 2018).
Consequently, [[the]{.mark} [U.S. was **entirely reliant** on]{.mark}
foreign nations for the procurement and supply of rare earth
elements]{.underline}. In 2018, the Mountain Pass mine restarted and the
U.S. produced 15,000 metric tons of rare earths (United States
Geological Survey 2019); however, [most]{.underline} of those [rare
earths had to be sent overseas to be refined and processed into usable
product]{.underline} (Gabriel 2019). In particular, [the United States
is almost entirely reliant on China---[a **strategic
competitor**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as [China]{.mark} has
[captured]{.mark} 90-**[95%]{.mark}** [of the world's market]{.mark}
for]{.underline} mining and refining [rare earths]{.underline} (Grasso
2013). [[Rare earths are **critical**]{.mark} components]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} more than 200 high-tech electronics and devices
produced both for consumer and [military use]{.underline} (Grasso 2013),
[and are [critical for]{.mark} the functionality of several defense
applications such [as lasers, guidance systems, and radar and

2010 SENKAKU ISLAND DISPUTE [[Should China choose to]{.mark} flex its

element]{.underline} (REE) exports, [[the]{.mark} U.S. [defense
industrial base could be **significantly**]{.mark}
[disrupted]{.mark}]{.underline} in the near term. Such concern is based
on history: the Japanese and Chinese governments have long disputed
which of the two countries is the rightful sovereign over a group of
uninhabited islands, the Senkaku Islands. In 2010, [China embargoed
REE's to Japan]{.underline} in response to a maritime dispute over
jurisdiction of the Senkaku Islands in the South China Sea (Grasso
2013). This supply disruption had spillover effects in the U.S. as well.
The United States relied---and relies still---on Japan for the
procurement of permanent magnets and other REE components (Bradsher
2010). The 2010 embargo lasted for nearly two months. In that time,
[Japan experienced significant shortages]{.underline}, China refused to
increase REE exports to any other country to make up for the gap in
supply, and [the price of REE experienced a global price spike of nearly
ten times greater than pre-embargo prices]{.underline} (Bradsher 2010).
The price spike, initiated by Chinese action and driven by market
speculation, was temporary. By the end of 2010, prices tumbled as the
market adjusted and other nations reclaimed the ability to produce their
own supply of rare earths. Starting in the 1980s, China scale up its
rare earth mining capabilities dramatically. By the 1990s, the strategy
had paid off. [China essentially controlled the global rare earth
market]{.underline} (Plumer 2012). Vekasi (2019) attributed China's
dominant market share in rare earths to low production costs (e.g.,
labor costs), lower environmental standards, and its state-directed
investment strategy. The 2010 incident resulted in demand destruction
for the Chinese-controlled rare earth market, proving that it did not
possess monopoly power. Japan developed a method for recycling rare
earth elements from used electronics. In the U.S., the Mountain Pass
mine in California resumed operation (it closed again in late 2015).
Other companies started substituting other materials for rare earths in
products, suggesting that rare earths were not always necessary. The
United States, followed by the European Union and Mexico, filed a World
Trade Organization (WTO) case against China, alleging that its rare
earth export quotas violated the rules. The WTO agreed, and forced China
to abandon the practice (Bradsher 2012). The 2010 embargo and its
aftermath demonstrate the power of the market to adjust to abrupt
changes in supply and demand. Nevertheless, it also demonstrates the
threat of supply shocks to U.S. national security, and the need for
greater resilience in the defense industrial base to withstand future
supply shocks. Since the 2010 embargo, [little has changed in the market
landscape]{.underline}: [China retains market power as a supplier of
rare earths, controlling roughly 90% of the market]{.underline}

#### Chinese monopoly on REMs risks US-led renewable initiatives that impede global climate cooperation

[[China dominates global supply chains for nearly all critical mineral
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}. Especially important are elements such
as nickel, cobalt, lithium, copper, and the rare earths that power
decarbonization technologies such as batteries, electric motors, and
turbines. The rapidly increasing demand for these minerals has rekindled
interest in extracting polymetallic nodules from the deep seabed.

[[China controls the supply of these resources through
extraction]{.mark}, either within its borders (especially in the case of
rare earths) or through ownership of critical foreign mineral
resources]{.underline} (for example, cobalt in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo). It also dominates mineral processing, controlling
the [vast
majority](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions) of
global operations. A
recent [study](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/a-reckoning-for-ev-battery-raw-materials.html) by
S&P Global Inc. found that 11 of the 16 companies that make nickel
sulfate are in China. The study projects that China will produce 824
billion metric tons of nickel sulfate per year by 2030, while North
America and Europe will produce just 146 billion metric tons.

China\'s dominance is the result of a long-term, dedicated effort to
secure mineral resources, build extensive processing capacity, and make
that capacity available at rates that underbid its competition. This
strategy has benefitted from Chinese government support through
state-owned enterprises and financial backing.

[China\'s dominance leaves the global availability of critical minerals
vulnerable to supply disruptions resulting from trade restrictions,
political instability, natural disasters, or other disturbances. This
supply risk is only expected to grow in the coming decades as the demand
for critical minerals increases with the widespread adoption of
decarbonization technologies]{.underline}. For example, [the
International Energy Agency projects that in order to meet the Paris
Agreement goals, [demand for nickel and cobalt in
2040](https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions) will
be six to 20 times greater than the demand in 2020.]{.underline}

Deep seabed polymetallic nodules are potato-sized concretions that lie
on the seafloor, some 4000--5500 meters below the ocean surface. These
nodules are extremely rich in cobalt, nickel, copper, and manganese, and
their extraction is looking increasingly attractive for meeting the
projected demand for batteries.

Most polymetallic nodule resources rest in the high seas, outside any
country\'s exclusive economic zone, where access is regulated by the
International Seabed Authority, an organization created by the United
Nations in 1994. This has created the opportunity for some 20 countries
to sponsor seabed mining exploration contracts. As these contractors\'
operations transition from exploration to commercial mining
(possibly [as soon as 2024](https://metals.co/nori/)), they will rapidly
multiply the number of global sources of critical mineral resources.

[[The pending emergence of deep seabed mining]{.mark} could [present a
unique opportunity to act on policy proposals]{.mark} [to diversify the
supply]{.mark} and processing [of critical minerals]{.mark}. These
proposals center [around incentivizing the support and development of
minerals-processing capabilities outside China]{.mark}.]{.underline}
They include providing grants, loans, and loan guarantees to help
finance the construction of processing facilities; revising
environmental requirements for permitting processing facilities;
incentivizing the use of domestically produced critical materials and
products; and strengthening ways to enforce the prohibition of unfair
trade practices.

[The [Inflation Reduction Act of
2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text) includes
important provisions consistent with these policy goals]{.underline}.
One is a production tax credit equal to 10 percent of production costs
for critical minerals produced in the United States or its territories.
In addition, for electric vehicles to be eligible for the full
clean-vehicle credit, the majority of their battery\'s critical minerals
must be sourced from the United States or a country with which the
United States has a free trade agreement. A vehicle is ineligible for
the credit if any of the battery\'s critical minerals come from a
"foreign entity of concern," which includes China.

[These provisions have
been [criticized](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2022/11/07/why-americas-climate-law-is-causing-rifts-at-cop-27-00065288) by
U.S. trade partners as protectionist]{.underline}. If policymakers are
interested in addressing these concerns, the provisions could be revised
to expand the number of eligible countries with little impact on the
goal to diversify mineral supply and processes. This goal is less about
onshoring as it is about multi-shoring. Just as with petroleum or wheat,
it\'s less important where a commodity comes from---it is much more
important that it be available from multiple sources. That allows for a
stable supply even when individual sources are disrupted. Given current
geopolitical tensions, it\'s best to stick with friendly nations that
are less susceptible to retaliatory pressures from China or other
nations hostile to the United States.

A challenge with diversifying supply chains for heavy industries like
mining and minerals processing is that it takes time and money. It
won\'t happen quickly. In the meantime, our best bet would seem to be to
support whatever capacity exists today. There is actually substantial
minerals-processing capacity outside China, but it has difficulty
competing on price. Supporting the stability and growth of this
capacity, for example with subsidies or guaranteed sales, would produce
results much more quickly than building new capacity. This is another
reason to expand the scope of supply chain diversification efforts
beyond the United States and is the rationale behind the [Minerals
Security
Partnership](https://www.state.gov/minerals-security-partnership/), an
agreement among U.S. allies to develop robust and diverse critical
minerals supply chains.

While the environmental impact of seabed mining is still being assessed
and is one of the principal considerations in developing commercial
mining regulations, the extreme environmental impact of land-based
nickel and cobalt mining in places such as Indonesia, New Caledonia, and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo are well known. In
addition, [worker safety and health and human rights
concerns](https://www.cfr.org/blog/why-cobalt-mining-drc-needs-urgent-attention) associated
with these mining operations are well documented. Such concerns are
unlikely to arise with seabed mining, as this is a capital-intensive and
technology-dependent undertaking where artisanal methods are not
possible.

[[Seabed mining may be a way to diversify]{.mark} critical
[minerals]{.mark} supply chains [and break China\'s stranglehold
on]{.mark} [supplies]{.mark} of some of the world\'s most important
natural resources.]{.underline}

[**[Rare earths are]{.mark} raw materials [of strategic
significance]{.mark} for the economic and military security of the
West**. [They are **essential** to]{.mark}]{.underline} numerous
civilian and **[[military tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**. The
People's Republic of [China is the world's largest producer of rare
earths, [which poses a **significant threat** to the West's
security]{.mark} of supply.]{.underline} For far too long, this problem
remained below the radar of political decision-makers and has not been
addressed. This working paper points out the risks of the Chinese
monopoly on rare earths and discusses possible steps towards a solution.
In the current trade war between the United States and China, [Beijing
has brought [rare earths]{.mark} into play as a potential means of
[exerting pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [China's dominant
position]{.underline}]{.mark} with regard to these strategic raw
materials is not a passing geopolitical trend, but [has been a
structural market problem with technological and security-related
implications for the industrialised countries of the West for some
time]{.underline}. **[[The mere fact that a single state has the
potential to exploit key]{.mark} technological [raw materials
for]{.mark} the purpose of [political negotiations should deeply
worry]{.mark} political and economic
[decision-makers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The example of [[Russia's
blackmail]{.mark} attempts [in]{.mark} the field of [energy]{.mark}
policy immediately comes to mind]{.underline}. The situation concerning
[[rare earths]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [[is much more
dramatic]{.mark} and far more difficult to solve than in the case of
Russia's dominance in energy]{.underline}. Yet the West has failed to
adequately address the rare earths problem for far too long and has
largely left solving it up to the market. Why are rare earths so
important? **[[Rare earths]{.underline}]{.mark}** are a set of 17
metals, 15 of them in the lanthanide series of the periodic table, which
**[[are necessary for numerous technologies]{.mark} due to their
physical and chemical properties.]{.underline}** They are used in minute
amounts, sprinkled into the technology in catalysts, alloys, magnets,
solar energy systems and computers. [Without them, many devices simply
would not work.]{.underline} Together with a number of other raw
materials such as cobalt and lithium, **[[they are the
fundamental]{.mark} basis for future technologies]{.underline}**,
especially with regard to the energy transition, such as all-electric
cars, batteries and interconnected Industry 4.0 applications. As all
[these civilian technologies are also used in the military,]{.underline}
they are of strategic importance for the functionality of modern and
increasingly interconnected high-tech armed forces. To continue in this
vein: a US Virginia-class submarine, for example, requires some four
tons of rare-earth materials, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer requires
more than two tons and even an F-35 fighter aircraft requires more than
400 kilogrammes. Further areas of application include aerospace
engineering, surveillance systems and lasers. The more modern and
technologically sophisticated military equipment becomes, the more
diverse the applications and therefore the use of rare earths will be
for the armed forces of the future. This is a trend that none of the
NATO countries' armed forces can afford to ignore. Currently, NATO is
almost 100 percent dependent on rare earths imports from China. This is
a much higher rate than that of the energy dependency on Moscow, which
varies from country to country and for which alternatives are available
if necessary. That is why the US and the EU have been classifying rare
earths as critical or strategic raw materials for more than ten years.
This means that these raw materials are of great economic significance
and have a high supply risk. For this reason, it is essential to take a
closer look at the Chinese monopoly, potential alternative suppliers and
related supply risks. From the ore to the final product: China controls
almost the entire value chain Most analyses of
[[China]{.underline}'s]{.mark} role in the rare earths market overlook
the fact that not only does the People's Republic **[[produce the
majority]{.mark} of the raw materials, but Chinese companies now [also
dominate]{.mark} almost all [downstream sectors]{.mark}]{.underline}**
of the value chain up to the final product. [At the first stage --
mining of raw materials -- China currently controls about 80 percent of
world production]{.underline}, which corresponds to 170,000 tons of
rare-earth materials (mainly oxides) per year. In recent years, the
Chinese share has fallen from almost 100 percent to 80 percent as other
companies have started production. At the same time, China is the
largest consumer of rare earths for its own industry. Its largest
foreign competitor, the Australian company Lynas, produces about 20,000
tons of rare-earth materials, accounting for almost twelve percent of
the market. Lynas has been heavily indebted for years, however, and only
remains solvent because Japan has been supporting the company
financially since 2011 in order to have an alternative to supplies from
China. This project may seem absurd from a business standpoint, but the
logic behind it is simple: Japanese taxpayers' money goes to an
Australian raw materials company to increase the security of supply for
Japan's industry. This in turn reduces Beijing's ability to put
political pressure on Tokyo. When it comes to raw materials strategies,
however, the situation in the West is much more drastic. In the US,
Molycorp, the last company in the country to mine rare earths, ceased
production in 2015 due to low raw material prices. Two years later, the
remainder of the company was taken over by an investment consortium of
two partners from the US and one from China. For the time being,
Washington has put its last domestic rare earths company partly in
Chinese hands. Since then, the US government has once again realised the
strategic significance of rare earths for the US economy and military.
It remains to be seen whether concrete steps will follow and Washington
is prepared to use taxpayers' money to support US producers of rare
earths. In Europe, the situation is as alarming as it is in the US.
There not a single mine in the EU producing rare earths for Europe's
industry, even though sufficient resources are available, but political
decision-makers seem to have simply forgotten the strategic significance
of these elements for the energy transition and military autonomy of the
EU after the last period of high prices in 2011/2012. To borrow a phrase
from the Australian historian Christopher Clark used to describe the
path to World War I, the EU seems to be "sleepwalking" into its next
resource crisis. While Brussels and Berlin want the energy transition,
climate protection and greater autonomy in security policy, political
leaders still fail to grasp the full strategic significance of supply
with the necessary raw materials such as rare earths and other metals.
And yet there are promising deposits in Europe that could be mined.
Greenland and Sweden, for example, have documented rare-earth resources
or have been exploring them extensively for some time. The only problem
is that they are not mined by European companies because prices are too
low and the Chinese monopoly is too overwhelming. **[With its six
state-owned conglomerates, [Beijing could flood the market]{.mark} with
excess capacities to increase supply, [which would ruin]{.mark} any
[investment]{.mark}.\[]{.underline}**1\] Accordingly, [China has several
forms of leverage at the first production stage:]{.underline} **[about
40 percent of global reserves and 80 percent of
production]{.underline}**, **[which allows Beijing to influence supply
and price trends]{.underline}**. What is more, one of the two potential
European deposits of rare-earth resources in Greenland is being
developed by a Chinese company. Privately owned Western companies are
thus facing unequal state-sponsored competition from East Asia. But that
is not all. [Chinese companies are increasingly dominating all further
steps in production on the global rare earths market]{.underline}. [They
hold leading positions in the processing of ores]{.underline}, in the
manufacture of components and to an increasing extent in the final
products such as batteries and computers. Important technologies and
expertise in the area of further processing have also been transferred
to China in the past two decades. Chinese companies and research
institutions have now taken a leading role in areas such as separation
and certain patents. The largest segment is the field of permanent
magnets made from the rare-earth elements neodymium and dysprosium.
Outside of China, these special high-performance magnets are now only
produced in Japan. Almost all of the few remaining European magnet
producers have relocated their production facilities to China, where
rare earths can be purchased at lower prices. The Chinese share of
global magnet production is estimated at over 80 percent, and no other
country will be able to challenge China's share for the next two
decades. From the ore to the final product, the People's Republic is and
will remain a monopolist at several stages. Furthermore, recycling
technologies for rare earths either do not yet exist on a large scale or
have only low efficiency levels. This state of affairs has a significant
impact on the economic and military security of the West and its supply
situation in the event of a conflict. Existing and potential
consequences of the Chinese monopoly on raw materials **[The Chinese
monopoly]{.underline}** from the ore to the final product [underscores
several failures of the West]{.underline} -- on both sides of the
Atlantic. On the one hand, starting in the 1980s[, the US government sat
by and watched the People' s Republic invest more and more in
basic]{.underline} -- and application-specific -- [research in the field
of rare earths]{.underline}. Low production costs, strategic company
takeovers, support from the government (subsidies), technology transfers
and lax environmental regulations allowed China to replace the US as the
leader in rare earths. [Despite Washington's early awareness of the
strategic significance of secure access to these and other critical
metals for its economy and military]{.underline}, [Washington only took
a supporting role and left it up to companies to ensure a supply of raw
materials]{.underline}. The advocates of a market-driven solution
retained the upper hand. As a result, the US did not protect its own
companies from decline and let them go bankrupt. The market-based
approach triumphed -- and is still triumphing -- over legitimate
security concerns. Japan's experiences in 2010 show that excessive
dependence on a single supplier can have an adverse effect on not only
individual companies but also on entire economies. After a minor dispute
between Japanese and Chinese boats in the contested waters of the East
China Sea, all shipments of rare earths from China to Japan were
suspended for more than two months. This resulted in unprecedented price
increases and frenzied investments in new exploration projects and
processing technologies all over the world. Japan survived the supply
shortage relatively unscathed, but, since then, major Japanese companies
such as Toyota have been even more active in seeking secure access to
rare earths outside of China. [In the current trade war between
Washington and Beijing, [China could once again use rare earths]{.mark}
as a temporary means of exerting political and economic pressure**. [An
artificial]{.mark} supply [shortage]{.mark} caused by an export ban
[could]{.mark} lead to an [increase]{.mark} in [prices and]{.mark} fuel
the search for sufficient raw materials for the [high-tech industries in
the US]{.mark},**]{.underline} Europe and Japan. Especially large
consumers such as automobile corporations, but also producers of modern
defence systems could be affected by a short-term supply bottleneck.
Currently, there are sufficient quantities of rare earths available on
the market. However, they are mainly from Chinese sources. Other
suppliers either produce too little or are unable to produce sufficient
quantities of the necessary quality. Against this backdrop, viable
solutions should be considered in order to avoid such a scenario and to
increase the West's general security of supply.

[The [U.S.]{.mark}\'s heavy [reliance on importation]{.mark} of CM is
[concerning]{.mark} in part because it can sometimes **[enable]{.mark}**
[foreign powers to leverage]{.mark} their [influence]{.mark} over CM
supplies [against the U.S. in the foreign policy]{.mark}
sphere.]{.underline} [For example, as stated above, [China controls 80%
of]{.mark} the [global]{.mark} supply of [rare earth elements]{.mark}.
This heavy [reliance created]{.mark} significant [fears]{.mark} within
the U.S. [when China reduced]{.mark} its annual tonnage of
[exports]{.mark} of rare-earth elements from 2006 to 2009 and then cut
its allowed export amount in half in the second half of 2010. [China
defended]{.mark} these disruptive supply cuts on the grounds that, [as
a]{.mark}n independent [sovereign]{.mark}, it was [entitled to restrict
exports]{.mark} to regulate environmental protection, ensure sustainable
production levels, and privilege Chinese interests over others. However,
[China also temporarily discontinued]{.mark} [supplying]{.mark} Japan,
[the U.S]{.mark}., and Europe with rare-earth elements [during a
diplomatic stand-off]{.mark} in 2010.]{.underline} Although many
importers responded to China\'s manipulation of rare-earth supplies with
efforts aimed at reducing rare-earth consumption, [China [prove]{.mark}d
CM [supplies]{.mark} can be [wielded as]{.mark} a powerful [sword in
foreign policy.]{.mark}]{.underline} Having witnessed China\'s use of
its CM market dominance as a foreign policy weapon, some other countries
that export CM have signaled a willingness to mimic China\'s actions.
This tactic was already implemented for the non-critical-but essential
to battery production--mineral nickel. Indonesia, the world\'s largest
producer of nickel, proposed to enact an export ban on nickel ore in
2019 that would eliminate nine percent of the market supply. The
Indonesian government floated the ban to force miners to invest in
value-adding processing. The government\'s actions led the European
Union to file a complaint concerning the ban with the World Trade
Organization in November 2019. This dispute was yet another chapter in a
trade war saga between the EU and Indonesia that began in early 2019
after the EU imposed stricter limits on the use of palm oil an
Indonesian export that can be used to produce biofuels. Restrictions on
exports of minerals like those used by China and Indonesia are unlikely
to be isolated events. [To the extent that the planet\'s economies rely
more and more on reliable supplies of these minerals, [the likelihood of
CM supplies]{.mark} being [**leveraged** in foreign policy will]{.mark}
only [increase]{.mark}. Because imported CM are [crucial to]{.mark} the
continued [functioning]{.mark} of the [U.S. economy]{.mark}, unstable
supplies of CM could **[impair]{.mark}** various industries, [national
security]{.mark}, [military defense]{.mark}, and the [U.S. transition to
renewable energy.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Former Secretary of the United
States Department of Energy (\"DOE\"), Rick Perry, specifically
suggested that [dependence on foreign sources]{.mark} of CM is a [threat
to the U.S.]{.mark} The [U.S. imports 100% of 14 minerals essential to
defense technologies]{.mark}, cell [phones]{.mark}, and clean [energy
production]{.mark}. Additionally, the U.S. relies on imports for at
least 50% of 30 other minerals. [Missiles]{.mark}, [smart bombs]{.mark},
and [satellite]{.mark} communication [**would not function** without
these minerals]{.mark}.]{.underline} Under the Obama Administration, the
DOE noted CM were also essential to the transition to renewable energy
technologies. For all of these reasons, reducing dependence on foreign
supplies of CM for energy and defense technologies could do much to
secure these important industries[. Since the [nation\'s]{.mark} heavy
[reliance on imported CM]{.mark} is an [issue with]{.mark} significant
[foreign policy]{.mark} implications, responsibility to address it falls
primarily on the federal government.]{.underline} In 2017, the federal
government made some attempts to reduce its vulnerability to CM-related
manipulation from other countries. [Among other things, President
[Trump]{.mark} issued an executive order (\"EO\") [declar]{.mark}ing a
policy [initiative]{.mark} aimed at [reduc]{.mark}ing the nation\'s
[vulnerability to supply chain]{.mark} disruptions and identifying new
supplies.]{.underline} The EO encouraged greater investment in CM
exploration, mining, concentration, separation, alloying, recycling, and
reprocessing. The EO also called for streamlining the leasing and
permitting processes for mines and for improving access to topography,
geological, and geophysical surveys to enable mining.\" However, it
neglected to address any international issues involving CM, to create
actual incentives for increasing investment in CM recycling
technologies, or to promote research in CM alternatives. [As described
below, aggressive [policy actions]{.mark} in these three areas could do
much to [improve]{.mark} domestic CM [security]{.mark} and
[ensure]{.mark} a steady [transition toward]{.mark} a more [sustainable
energy system]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The importance of seabed minerals

**[Seabed minerals]{.underline}**, [and in particular polymetallic
nodules]{.underline}, [offer [a preferred]{.mark}]{.underline} [solution
to]{.underline} challenges facing [the]{.underline} **[uptake of
renewable]{.underline}** **[electricity]{.underline}**, [electric
vehicles]{.underline}, [and other]{.underline} [technologies to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}. [[Shortages of critical minerals
impede]{.underline}]{.mark} the world's **[[ability to
transition]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[away from fossil
fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}, and these [minerals are integral components
of]{.underline} the [solar]{.underline} panels, [wind]{.underline} turbines, [battery
storage]{.underline}, [and grid infrastructure]{.underline} needed to
reliably power the global economy. Although these [clean energy
technologies]{.underline} can reduce the necessity of extracting fossil
fuels, they [require]{.underline} **[substantial
quantities]{.underline}** [of metals]{.underline} that have their own
externalities. [Cobalt]{.underline} [supply]{.underline}, [produced]{.underline} [primarily]{.underline} [in
the]{.underline} [Democratic]{.underline} [Republic
of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [Congo]{.underline}, [has]{.underline} [been
plagued by]{.underline} **[child labor
issues]{.underline}**. [Nickel]{.underline} [demand]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [primarily]{.underline} [be
sourced by]{.underline} [clear]{.underline} [cutting tropical
rainforests and]{.underline} **[displacing Indigenous
groups]{.underline}**. [Copper and other resources
are]{.underline} often [found on Indigenous lands]{.underline} and are
undergoing massive price increases as terrestrial supplies decline in
quality. Further down the supply chain, processing of important metals
is controlled by countries hostile to American interests, particularly
China and Russia, which can exacerbate dependencies and jeopardize
national security.

[Fortunately]{.underline}, **[polymetallic
nodules]{.underline}** [sitting]{.underline} **[unattached]{.underline}** [on
the]{.underline} **[Pacific]{.underline}** **[Ocean]{.underline}** **[seafloor]{.underline}** [contain]{.underline} **[high
concentrations]{.underline}** [of these critical
minerals]{.underline}, [and
they]{.underline} [constitute]{.underline} [one
of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[richest
untapped]{.underline}** **[sources]{.underline}** [of the raw
materials]{.underline} [needed]{.underline} [to enable the clean energy
transition]{.underline}. In
particular, [the]{.underline} [Clarion-Clipperton
Zone]{.underline} ([CCZ]{.underline}), halfway [between Hawai'i and
Mexico]{.underline}, [is estimated
to]{.underline} [possess]{.underline} [over]{.underline} **[three
times]{.underline}** **[more]{.underline}** **[cobalt]{.underline}**, **[twice]{.underline}** **[as
much]{.underline}** **[nickel]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[as
much]{.underline}** **[manganese]{.underline}** [as
all]{.underline} [known]{.underline} [land-based]{.underline} [stores]{.underline},
as well as a substantial amount of
copper. [The]{.underline} [nodules]{.underline} [resource from the CCZ
area]{.underline} [as a
whole]{.underline} [could]{.underline} [electrify the global transport
fleet]{.underline} **[several times over]{.underline}**. As the United
States and the world seek to promote an electrified global economy, [it
is imperative to]{.underline} [look to]{.underline} [the seabed
for]{.underline} [these]{.underline} [resources]{.underline} [as]{.underline} [an]{.underline} **[alternative]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[more]{.underline}** **[destructive]{.underline}** **[and

5.3. Support for clean energy and electrification The role of
[DSM]{.underline} extends beyond mere extraction; it [can play an
important role in powering clean energy technologies such as solar
panels, wind turbines, and EVs]{.underline}. [By providing a steady and
diverse supply of]{.underline} [necessary materials, DSM can bolster the
global move towards low-carbon energy]{.underline} [systems]{.underline}
(Amon et al., 2022). [This]{.underline} shift [can yield]{.underline}
numerous benefits, including [expanded clean energy capacities,
accelerated EV uptake, improved energy storage, innovation in clean
energy technologies, minimized]{.underline} social and environmental
impacts associated with [terrestrial mining, and enhanced global
cooperation on green energy initiatives]{.underline}. [The **assurance**
of a [stable supply]{.mark} of **crucial** minerals from DSM can
[**invigorate**]{.mark} the production and dissemination of clean energy
technologies]{.underline} (Teske et al., 2016). [This]{.underline}, in
turn, [can diminish]{.underline} greenhouse gas ([GHG]{.underline})
[emissions and]{.underline} [contribute to a]{.underline} more
[sustainable]{.underline} [energy]{.underline} [portfolio]{.underline}
worldwide. For example, [the production of [solar panels]{.mark}
requires silver, gallium, and indium, while [wind turbines]{.mark}
[rely]{.mark} on REEs, such as [neodymium]{.mark} and
[dysprosium]{.mark}]{.underline} (Moss et al., 2013). [Energy storage
systems, **pivotal** for EV batteries, depend on lithium, cobalt,
nickel, and other materials]{.underline} (Xu et al., 2020). [As clean
energy solutions see heightened demand, the need for these critical
elements also **escalates**]{.underline}. Except for lithium,
[[DSM]{.mark} has the potential to provide alternative and plentiful
supplies of these resources]{.underline}, [[mitigating supply pressures
and aiding]{.mark} the **[transition]{.mark}** towards
low-carbon]{.underline} [energy]{.underline}. [The outcome could be
**more stable** and competitive prices for critical minerals, rendering
EV batteries]{.underline} [and other green technologies more economical
and widely accessible]{.underline}. Moreover, [a secure and varied
[supply]{.mark} may [drive battery]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology
forward]{.underline}, [resulting in enhancements in battery efficacy,
efficiency, and service life]{.underline} (Babbitt et al., 2021).
Energ[y storage]{.underline}, particularly grid-scale batteries, [is
[**integral** to]{.mark}]{.underline} incorporating clean energy sources
into electricity systems, [[counterbalancing]{.mark} the
**[variability]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [solar]{.mark} and wind
energy]{.underline} (Yang et al., 2018). The accessibility of essential
minerals via [[DSM]{.mark} can [support]{.mark}]{.underline} the advent
of cutting-edge [large-scale energy storage systems]{.underline},
thereby [improving [grid **reliability**]{.mark} and enabling greater
integration of clean]{.underline} [energy]{.underline}. A diversified
critical [[mineral supply]{.mark} could]{.underline} also [[propel
**innovation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [within clean energy
technologies]{.underline}, paving the way for novel materials, designs,
and manufacturing techniques. Such [[advancements]{.mark} could
[increase efficiency, drive down costs, and boost]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[performance]{.underline}]{.mark} of clean energy systems.
Technological advancements are also being made in the field of real-time
environmental monitoring systems, which are crucial for mitigating the
ecological impacts of DSM (Yuan et al., 2023). Project such as the EU\'s
Blue Nodules are pioneering the development of new technologies for
harvesting polymetallic nodules with minimal environmental disruption
(Trocan, 2023). These efforts underscore the importance of integrating
sustainability into all phases of [DSM]{.underline}, from exploration to
extraction. Moreover, a consistent supply of REEs [could
support]{.underline} the development of [more effective permanent
magnets for wind turbines]{.underline}, [while]{.underline} a reliable
metal supply, including copper, could support research into [more
efficient solar cell technologies]{.underline} (Grandell et al., 2016;
Valero et al., 2018; Ormerod et al., 2023). Additionally, the pursuit of
[[DSM]{.underline}]{.mark} resources [may [cultivate]{.mark}
international [collaboration]{.mark} on clean energy as [nations join
forces to research]{.mark}, extract, and manage deep-sea
resources]{.underline}. Such [joint efforts can facilitate]{.underline}
technological exchanges, [[knowledge sharing]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the adoption of [[best]{.mark}
[practices]{.mark}]{.underline}, all of which underpin the transition to
green energy. 5.4. Impact on energy prices The advent of new mineral and
metal sources through [DSM has the potential to significantly influence
global supply and demand dynamics]{.underline}, thereby [impacting the
pricing of energy-related commodities]{.underline} (Martino and Parson,
2013). [By introducing a [broader]{.mark} base of [suppliers]{.mark} and
[foster]{.mark}ing market competition, DSM could lead to more stable and
competitive prices for critical]{.underline} [minerals, enhancing the
[affordability]{.mark}]{.underline} and adoption [of clean
energy]{.underline} technologies, [and propelling the global energy
transition]{.underline}. [DSM]{.underline}\'s [ability to
[augment]{.mark}]{.underline} [the global [reserve]{.mark} of
critical]{.underline} [minerals]{.underline} [could [support]{.mark} a
[competitive market]{.mark} environment]{.underline}, [[reducing
prices]{.mark} and]{.underline} [making these materials more
cost-effective]{.underline} for clean energy and EV industries. This
could result in a reduction in the overall costs of clean energy
technologies and energy storage solutions, increasing their market
penetration among consumers and businesses. As DSM ventures proliferate
and diversify the supply of critical minerals, [[suppliers]{.mark} might
strive to [stand out by competing on]{.mark} price, quality, and
**[sustainability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such [[competition can spark
innovation]{.mark}, foster [efficiency]{.mark}, and promote
environmentally conscious mining practices]{.underline}, thereby
augmenting the value and sustainability of clean energy and the EV
sector. Furthermore, [DSM\'s]{.underline} [role in diversifying the
sources of critical minerals can lead to price stabilization and shield
the market from spikes due to supply disruptions or
geopolitical]{.underline} [tensions]{.underline} (Althaf and Babbitt,
2021). [A [stable pricing]{.mark} landscape [offers]{.mark} a **boon**
to industries dependent on these materials]{.underline}, [allowing for
more [**precise** planning and **confident** investment]{.mark}
in]{.underline} the advancement and application of [clean
energy]{.underline} technologies. DSM\'s contribution to [supply
diversification]{.underline} also [mitigates reliance on volatile
regions prone to political instability, social unrest, natural
disasters, or regulatory shifts]{.underline}, thus [fostering price
stability and reducing the susceptibility to abrupt price
changes]{.underline}. [Stable]{.underline} and competitive [pricing of
critical minerals can **catalyse** investments in clean
energy]{.underline} technologies, [making them economically more
**viable** and competitive]{.underline} with conventional fossil
fuel-based energy sources (De Ridder, 2013). As clean energy and storage
solutions become more cost-competitive, [we can expect an acceleration
in the adoption and innovation of clean energy technologies, further
driving down prices and enhancing affordability for both consumers and
businesses]{.underline} (Kittner et al., 2017; Kalair et al., 2021).
Additionally, [[DSM]{.mark}\'s effect on supply and demand may
[incentivize]{.mark} [resource efficiency and]{.mark} [recycling]{.mark}
**innovation**]{.underline}. [With a reliable supply, industries may
invest]{.underline} more [in technologies]{.underline} and processes
[that optimize material usage, such as recycling and [creating]{.mark}
more efficient products]{.underline} (Beaudet et al., 2020). [This
approach can foster [a]{.mark} more sustainable, [**circular**
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially [reducing the long-term costs
associated with clean energy]{.underline} technologies (Giurco et al.,
2014; Karali and Shah, 2022; Ali, 2023). Furthermore, the application of
big data analytics and blockchain technology in DSM operations can
enhance supply chain transparency and traceability (Hilmi et al., 2023;
Zhang and Gui, 2023). This could help ensure ethical sourcing of
minerals and provide a secure and verifiable record of transactions,
thus fostering trust among stakeholders and consumers. Lastly,
advancements in [[DSM]{.underline}]{.mark} technology [could [lead
to]{.mark} [cross-sector]{.mark}al [innovation]{.mark}]{.underline},
[with [benefits]{.mark} extending [to]{.mark} offshore wind and tidal
energy]{.underline}, [[telecommunications]{.mark}, and [marine
research]{.mark}, among others]{.underline}. For example, [breakthroughs
in underwater [robotics]{.mark} and communications could be repurposed
for subsea cable networks]{.underline}, while [innovations in extraction
and processing might propel advancements in robotics and
[a]{.mark}rtificial]{.underline} [[i]{.mark}ntelligence]{.underline},
[impacting]{.underline} a wide array of sectors including [clean energy,
[manufacturing]{.mark}, logistics, [agriculture]{.mark}, [and
healthcare]{.mark}]{.underline}. 5.5. Environmental trade-offs The
advancement of DSM poses a quintessential challenge: balancing the quest
for energy security and clean energy against environmental risks and
uncertainties. This delicate balance necessitates a deep dive into
environmental trade-offs, guided by rigorous scientific inquiry and the
precautionary principle, to navigate DSM\'s path responsibly and
sustainably (Ali, 2023; Levin et al., 2020). The pursuit of DSM must be
measured against the potential for environmental harm to the largely
uncharted deep-sea ecosystems and the broader, yet to be fully
understood, long-term environmental impacts (Christiansen et al., 2020).
For example, the interactions between DSM and fish populations are
complex and unknown (Amon et al., 2023). Moreover, environmental,
social, and governance (ESG) considerations specific to DSM remain
undefined, complicating the assessment of its full environmental impact
(Kung et al., 2021). One potential environmental [[benefit]{.mark} of
DSM [is the **reduction** in]{.mark} terrestrial]{.underline} [or
[land]{.mark}-based]{.underline} [[mining]{.mark}, which can be
[associated with]{.mark} **[defo]{.mark}restation**]{.underline},
[[habitat destruction]{.mark}, [pollution]{.mark}, [and **threats**
to]{.mark} **vulnerable** [ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hein et al.,
2013; Hallgren and Hansson, 2021; Luckeneder et al., 2021). For
instance, [nickel mining in Indonesia\'s rainforests leads to widespread
ecological damage]{.underline} (Giljum et al., 2022). Additionally,
[gold mining in the Amazon basin contributes significantly to
deforestation and mercury pollution]{.underline} (Kahhat et al., 2019).
Similarly, [coal mining in the Appalachian]{.underline} region of the
United States [has been linked to severe **water contamination** and
habitat destruction]{.underline} (Zipper and Skousen, 2021).
Transitioning some mining activity to the deep-sea might mitigate these
impacts, if DSM is managed sustainably and with minimal marine
disturbance. It is important to note that a shift of mining activity to
DSM could also negatively affect terrestrial mineral suppliers and
livelihoods of those who depend on land-based mining operations (Lèbre
et al., 2023). DSM can significantly disrupt seafloor habitats,
resulting in biodiversity loss and the potential extinction of unique
marine species (Levin et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2018). The resilience
of deep-sea ecosystems is low, with recovery from mining disturbances
expected to take decades, if not centuries (Glover and Smith, 2003;
Ramirez-Llodra et al., 2010). Furthermore, DSM activities can create
sediment plumes that compromise water quality and disrupt marine life\'s
feeding and reproductive behaviours (Christiansen et al., 2020; Peacock
and Ouillon, 2023). Such plumes might also impede the ocean\'s role in
regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide, possibly intensifying climate
change impacts (House et al., 2006; Bauer et al., 2013). A study by
Levin et al. (2020) highlighted that the extraction of polymetallic
nodules could lead to the removal of approximately 50--100 cm of the
seabed surface, resulting in long-lasting impacts on benthic
communities. The potential sediment plumes generated during DSM
operations may extend over tens of kilometres, affecting water quality
and marine life far beyond the mining sites (Jones et al., 2018). The
nascent state of DSM and the limited understanding of deep-sea
ecosystems present significant challenges for policymakers and
regulators in evaluating the benefits and risks associated with DSM
operations (Smith et al., 2020; Drazen et al., 2020). The indeterminate
nature of ESG risks in DSM adds to the complexity, creating uncertainty
for investors and stakeholders. Systematically assessing the ecological
implications of DSM and establishing a comprehensive ESG framework for
DSM is critical for addressing and mitigating potential environmental
and social impacts (Kung et al., 2021; Martins et al., 2023). Achieving
this requires global cooperation and robust regulatory regimes.

### Arctic Key

#### Arctic mining key to renewable transition. 

**Hanses and Tàbara 24** (Anne Merrild Hansen and J. David Tàbara, 2024.
"Confronting Local and Global Tipping Narratives: Green Energy
Development in the Arctic and Why Greenland Is Not for Sale"

[In the past decade, **[a global narrative shift towards]{.mark} a
[green energy]{.mark} transition**, [driven by the imperative to combat
climate change, has sparked]{.mark} a heightened [interest in
mining]{.mark} operations [for]{.mark} minerals such as lithium, cobalt,
nickel, and [rare earth elements necessary for renewable]{.mark} energy
[tech]{.mark}nologies, [electric vehicles, and lowcarbon solutions**.
The Arctic**]{.mark}, known to possess substantial mineral reserves**[,
has become a focal point for these mining activities]{.mark}**. Thus,
the hunt for energy resources in the Arctic continues. [Various
countries are trying to legitimize their Arctic interests by promoting
their 'Arctic-ness]{.mark}']{.underline} through narratives of
historical relationships, typically related to transport, logistics,
collaboration, presence, trade, or others. While the green transition
represents a crucial step towards a sustainable future, it can
potentially have signifcant negative implications for the Arctic region.
The Arctic ecosystems are highly sensitive to disturbances, and
increased mining activities can introduce pollutants and alter the
natural landscape, affecting Arctic fora and fauna. The loss of
biodiversity and the disruption of food chains can have farreaching
consequences for both wildlife and indigenous communities that depend on
these ecosystems for their livelihoods (see Zimmermannm et al., 2023).
Mining activities furthermore experienced to cause signifcant
socioeconomic impact on indigenous communities residing in the Arctic,
which often have deep cultural and A. M. Hansen and J. D. Tàbara 291
spiritual ties to the land (Hansen et al., 2016). Hence, there is a need
to shift from narrow policy and technological discussions on energy
transitions to broader fullsystems transformations linking local
interventions with a global systems' lens (Tàbara et al., 2021). The
growing infux of mining operations can lead to socio-cultural
disruptions, increased pressure on resources, and potential conficts
over land use. It is essential to engage and consult with these
communities to ensure their rights, traditional knowledge, and
well-being are respected throughout the mineral extraction process.
Acknowledging the unique challenges faced by Arctic communities in
relation to the development and extraction of the resources for the
green transition and the need to recognize their unique role in
supporting global sustainability futures, it is crucial to prioritize
their inclusion in decision-making processes and policy formulation.
Empowering these communities with resources and knowledge to adapt to
and mitigate climate change while preserving their cultural heritage and
traditional knowledge, is of paramount importance. On the one hand,
[transitioning to sustainable **[energy alternatives can bring
opportunities for economic diversifcation and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions]{.mark}**. Investments in [renewable]{.mark} energy [projects
and sustainable infrastructure can create]{.mark} new [green
jobs]{.mark} and promote local economic growth.]{.underline} But on the
other, traditional settings and new actions taken by by local
populations towards realizing their own green development futures can
also generate new refexive spaces for mutual learning and transformation
of those 'foreign' societies and organizations that in the past have
solely taken an extractive dominant role.

#### Melting ice is exposing untapped REM's in the Arctic

**Rowe '22** (Mark Rowe, environmental author and journalist, 12 August
2022, "Arctic nations are squaring up to exploit the region's rich
natural resources",
https://geographical.co.uk/geopolitics/the-world-is-gearing-up-to-mine-the-arctic)

Instead, [**[the main drivers of the Arctic resource rush are]{.mark}**
minerals, in particular **[r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth
[m]{.mark}etal[s]{.mark}** such as neodymium, praseodymium, terbium and
dysprosium]{.underline}. These minerals are key to the world's
electric-vehicle and renewable-energy revolutions, underpinning battery
technology and wind turbines among other things. However, it's worth
noting that lead, iron, nickel, zinc, gold, silver, coal, mica, precious
stones and construction minerals such as sand, gravel and crushed rock
are also believed to be present in significant quantities. [[The]{.mark}
estimated [value of minerals in Arctic Russia stands at]{.mark}
\$US1.5--[2 trillion]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Geological Survey of
Norway concluded that the subsurface of the Kola Peninsula contains a
'remarkable' abundance of various minerals. Meanwhile, [the [Canadian
Shield]{.mark}]{.underline}, which extends through eastern and central
Canada from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean, [[features high-grade
metamorphic rocks]{.mark} that hold large reserves of copper, gold,
lead, molybdenum and uranium. In [Greenland, melting ice is exposing
mineral belts]{.mark} [that]{.mark} are highly likely to
[contain]{.mark} gold, nickel, platinum-group elements, copper, lead,
zinc, molybdenum, diamonds and [r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth

### Development Solves

#### The status quo allows China to leverage their REM dominance over the US. The US must acquire REMs to counter. Research and development is key.

Questions piece, "Rare Earths: Next Element in the Trade War?," Center

https://www.csis.org/analysis/rare-earths-next-element-trade-war)-MZ

When **[[Chinese President Xi]{.mark} Jinping]{.underline}** toured a
rare-earth processor a week after the Trump administration blacklisted
Huawei in May, he **[[highlighte]{.mark}d the [importance of rare
earths]{.mark} in global supply chains---a statement widely [interpreted
as a threat]{.mark} to [restrict Chinese exports]{.mark} to the United
States.]{.underline}** [Since then, Chinese government organizations and
state media have indicated that [China]{.mark} is [prepared to follow
through]{.mark} on that threat as economic tensions between the world's
two largest economies continue to escalate.]{.underline} With the trade
war having moved beyond tariffs and into issues such as currency, rare
earths could be the next salvo in the conflict. Q1: What are rare earths
and what are they used for? A1: Rare-earth elements are a group of 17
metals that includes the 15 lanthanides of the periodic table as well as
yttrium and scandium, which possess similar chemical properties. As an
input for a variety of advanced industries, **[rare earths play an
[integral role in]{.mark} the modern [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Together, these elements are found in everything from LED displays to
weapons systems. For example, europium and terbium are a key component
found in televisions, while neodymium and samarium are used to guide
precision missiles and smart bombs.]{.underline} Q2: How are rare earths
produced and where are they found? A2: Although their name indicates
otherwise, rare earths are not actually a scarce resource. According to
the U.S. Geological Survey, they are "relatively abundant in the Earth's
crust." They are "rare" because they are not found on their own, but
rather as constituent parts of larger minerals, making extraction an
expensive endeavor. Before rare-earth elements can be used for
commercial or military purposes, they need to undergo several stages of
complex, environmentally damaging, and expensive processing. Rare-earth
oxides are mined from deposits in places like Bayan Obo in China or
Mount Weld in Australia before individual elements are separated
chemically, often at different facilities. The processed metals are then
bought by firms that use them as components in high-tech devices.
**[[China]{.mark} is the [leading]{.mark} player [at all stages]{.mark}
of rare-earth production]{.underline}**, with its [[dominance
increasing]{.mark} as production moves downstream.]{.underline} China
holds the world's **[[largest]{.mark} rare-earth
[reserves]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an estimated 37 percent of the global
total. Vietnam and Brazil each have around 18 percent share of global
reserves, and the United States has 1.17 percent. **[[Chinese]{.mark}
firms [control more than 85 percent of]{.mark} the costly [processing
stage of the supply chai]{.mark}n and [produced more than 70 percent
of]{.mark} the world's rare-earth-metal [supply]{.mark} in
2018.]{.underline}** However, this is down from a staggering 97 percent
in 2009, as other players have entered (or reentered) the market.
Australia and the United States, the second and third largest suppliers
last year, produced around 12 percent and 9 percent of global rare-earth
elements, respectively. Q3: What role do rare earths play in global
affairs? A3: From the 1960s to the 1980s, the [[United
States]{.underline}]{.mark} was the world's leading producer of
rare-earth elements, but between 2014 and 2017, it **[[imported 80
perce]{.mark}nt of its supply [from China]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
drastic shift was not a coincidence but rather the consequence of a
concerted effort by the **[[Chinese]{.mark} government to
"strategically" flood the global rare-earth market]{.underline}**,
according to the U.S. Department of Defense. State support coupled with
lower labor costs and less stringent environmental standards enabled
China's rare-earth rise. [Former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping famously
said in 1987 that while "the Middle East has oil, China has rare
earths," foreshadowing China's **[willingness to]{.mark}** use
its]{.underline} [[leverage]{.mark} over the industry's [supply
chain]{.mark}.]{.underline} China has **[[weaponized rare earths]{.mark}
before]{.underline}**. In **[2010, Beijing [cut exports]{.mark} to
Japan]{.underline}** after a Chinese fishing trawler collided with a
Japanese coast guard vessel near disputed islands. Afterward, Japan took
steps to diversify its supply of rare earths by investing in research
and development domestically and by funding ventures in India and
Australia. By 2017, Vietnam was Japan's largest supplier of rare earths.
As part of the [trade war with the United States]{.underline}, **[China
[imposed a 25 percent tariff]{.mark}]{.underline}** earlier this year
**[on]{.underline}** **[imports of commodities extracted by MP
Materials]{.underline}**, the [lone U.S. producer of rare
earths]{.underline} and the operator of the Mountain Pass Mine in
California. Last week, **[[China's]{.mark} [rare-earth industry]{.mark}
association]{.underline}** said **[it was [prepared to weaponize the
metals]{.mark} in order [to]{.mark} [pass]{.mark} on [higher costs to
U.S]{.mark}. consumers]{.underline}**. Q4: How can the [United States
[respond]{.mark}]{.underline}? A4: In the weeks after President Xi
toured the rare-earth facility in Jiangxi, the Department of Commerce
released a report outlining six calls to action and vowing that the
United States would "take unprecedented action" to secure "critical
mineral" supplies, including all 17 rare-earth elements.
[**[Recommendations]{.underline}**
**[include]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[d]{.underline}** accelerating the
regulatory approval process for mining permits, [**[increasing research

Defense to increase production of rare-earth magnets,]{.underline} a
move that was followed up by Australia's defense ministry announcing
that it too would boost production to secure supplies for itself and its
allies. The issue has also taken hold on Capitol Hill, with senators
proposing a bill that would increase research funding to determine if
rare earths can be extracted from coal, as well as legislation that
would support U.S. firms by allowing them to form a cooperative shielded
from antitrust laws[. Analysts have suggested that Washington fund
research into rare-earth alternatives, as Japan did after its own
dispute with China]{.underline}. Mining companies are already preparing
for the metals to play a role in the trade war. MP Materials will become
the only rare-earth processor in the United States next year when it
opens a processing facility at Mountain Pass. By 2022, more mines and
processing facilities are expected to open domestically. Lynas Corp, a
major Australian rare-earth producer, signed a memorandum of
understanding with U.S.-based Blue Line Corp to build a processing
facility in Texas. Also, Texas Mineral Resources Corp wants to develop
the Round Top rare-earth deposit in West Texas and is lobbying
Washington to require that defense contractors source rare earths only
from U.S. facilities. **[Establishing a domestic rare-earth supply is

### Mining Safe

#### Arctic REM mining is good and is becoming increasingly safe.

**Frederiksen 23** -- Executive Director of the Arctic Economic Council.
Mads Qvist Frederiksen, "If we want an energy transition, we must have
more mining," Arctic Economic Council,
https://arcticeconomiccouncil.com/news/if-we-want-an-energy-transition-we-must-have-more-mining/

[All across the Arctic,]{.underline} the local [communities have **for
centuries** been involved in the mining sector]{.underline}. **[The
region has been mined throughout history]{.underline}** to attain the
building blocks for a more modern and developed civilisation globally.
Yet, people's understanding of the importance of mining has decreased
over time as new mines have been placed in remote and distant locations
with different regulatory frameworks than in the Arctic. However, [**now
the world needs Arctic mining again** because the region has many of the
raw materials needed in the **green transition** and in places with fair
and transparent jurisdictions.]{.underline}

[Politicians are awaking to the need of mining for a **clean** and
**greener future**]{.underline}

In early March 2023, the European Union (EU) published their new
Critical Raw Materials (CRM) Act. It may not have made a lot of
headlines around the world, but it is important for industries, remote
Arctic communities, and the wider population.

The president of the European Commission Ursula de Leyden highlighted
the importance of mining at the beginning of the year when she said:

"The economies of the future will no longer rely on oil and coal, but on
lithium for batteries; on silicon metal for chips; on rare earth
permanent magnets for electric vehicles and wind turbines. And it is
sure: the [green and digital transitions will massively increase our
need for these materials."]{.underline}

Some analysts even argue that the opening of the first EU office in
Nuuk, Greenland is related to Europe waking up to its need for new
sources of raw materials.

Simultaneously in the US, President [Biden]{.underline} earlier
[announced an increase in the development of green
technologies]{.underline}. The new Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) also
includes large tax breaks for mining companies that can produce the
required critical raw materials. Last year, the US also launched a \$30
million initiative to research and secure the supply chain of domestic
raw materials.

Both the EU and the USA have recognised that they risk simply replacing
fossil fuel dependency to mineral dependency from authoritarian states
if they don't act now.

China -- who today is processing most of the world's raw materials and
thus holds a competitive advantage, is also moving into new mining
regions such as Madagascar and deep-sea mining off the coast of
Mozambique. Some Chinese companies have also shown an interest in mining
projects throughout the Arctic region.

[Mining has become an **issue of security**]{.underline} [but it is also
just as much about the **future of planetary health**]{.underline}; [the
**unavoidable fact** is that our **sustainable future** begins **deep
underground in a mine**]{.underline}. Yet, there were no references to
mining in the most recent report of the International Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC).

**[We cannot afford to slow down with mining]{.underline}**. It is clear
that [we are going to need a **vast amount of green energy** in the
future, and for that, we will need a **vast amount of critical
minerals**.]{.underline}

In the coming two decades, [we will require a 500% increase in the
production of lithium and graphite]{.underline} in order to meet demand.
Some people estimate [that our activity will necessitate the opening of
more than 330 new mines in the near future]{.underline}, and with one
mine normally taking more than 15 years to become operational, [we have
no time to waste.]{.underline}

We need to invest more in new mining projects

Today's mineral supply and investment plans fall short of what is needed
to transform our energy sector. A growing and more resource-hungry
population means larger quantities of CO2 emissions unless we are able
to change our basic technologies.

If you want to build a battery to store energy, you need lithium,
nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite to ensure high performance,
longevity and, energy density.

If you want to expand your electricity network, you need copper and
aluminium.

If you want to build permanent magnets that are used in wind turbines
and electric vehicles, you need rare earth elements.

In 2019, Finnish geologist Simon Michaux estimated that the world has to
increase the production of several raw materials several times, above
all total historical production to date, to reach our climate ambitions.
Therefore recycling will not take us all the way.

A typical electric car requires six times more mineral inputs than a
conventional car, and an onshore wind turbine requires nine times more
minerals than a gas-fired plant of the same capacity. Since 2010, the
average amount of minerals required for a new unit of power generation
capacity has increased by 50%.

It is also the critical raw materials which we need in our satellites,
computers, and connectivity infrastructure. The defence industry also
needs the minerals that we are currently sourcing from authoritarian
states. Each F-35 jet contains more than 400 kilos of yttrium, terbium,
and other rare earth elements. Nuclear reactors and lasers use samarium,
missile guidance systems need neodymium, night vision goggles need
lanthanum, etc. In the autumn of 2022, the Pentagon temporarily halted
deliveries of F-35 jets after discovering that the raw materials used
for a magnet had been made with a cobalt and samarium alloy from China.
As such, they had to find a place closer to home in their supply chain.
Today, the majority of rare earth mining, refining, and processing takes
place in China.

In 2010, China and Japan entered a trade dispute when the former
suddenly halted all shipments of rare earth elements to Japan. The
dispute began when the Chinese government reduced its export quotas by
40% which resulted in import prices rising quickly. China argued that
this decision was made to protect the environment, but the West called
it protectionism in disguise. The dispute was later resolved in the WTO,
but it caused western governments to begin looking outside of China for
rare earth elements.

For the climate, for security, and for jobs

As we can see, [we must diversify our raw materials supply and develop
mining operations in new places, instead of **outsourcing to developing
countries**]{.underline}. The Arctic region contains many of the
minerals that are currently mined elsewhere, even though the quality of
the ore could possibly be better in the north.

[We cannot get anywhere close to the quantity of required raw materials
in a sustainable manner unless developed countries are also pursuing
mining opportunities.]{.underline}

[The good news is that there is **growing consumer demand** for **more
supply chain transparency**]{.underline}, **[tighter environmental
regulations]{.underline}**, [and **labour rights**. This, combined with
the strategic importance, may lead to more mining in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The first obstacle to overcome is the idea of
"NIMBY -- not in my backyard" or "Green colonialism" which some interest
groups are promoting. Some of the interest groups don't even live in the
front yard of the Arctic but believe that the region should be kept
separate from wider global development.

#### Mining can be done safely.

Greenland's ice lies a climate solution --- and a new geopolitical
battleground," Grist, 03-26-2025,
https://grist.org/energy/greenland-rare-earths-mining-geopolitics-china-us/

[Critical Metals Corp]{.underline}., for its part, [says that it expects
to **produce minimal harmful products at its site**]{.underline}. [Like
other mining projects]{.underline} in Greenland, **[it will need to pass
an environmental review.]{.underline}** "We expect to provide more
updates about our [plans]{.underline} to **[reduce our environmental
footprint]{.underline}** as we get closer to mining operations," said
Tony Sage, the company's CEO and executive chairman, in a statement
provided to Grist. "With that, we believe it is important to keep in
mind that [rare earth elements are **critical materials for cleaner
applications**]{.underline}, [which will help us **build a greener
planet** in the future."]{.underline}

#### Mining has been going on in the Arctic for centuries.

**Speed 25** -- Senior Research Fellow at the Oxford Institute for
Energy Studies, Professor of Energy Policy at the Centre for Energy,
Petroleum, and Mineral Law and Policy. Philip Andrews-Speed, "Can the
Arctic be a significant contributor of critical minerals for the global
energy transition?," The Arctic Institute for Energy Studies, 02/2025,
https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SP36-Critical-Minerals-in-the-Arctic.pdf

[Commercial mining in the Arctic began **several centuries
ago**]{.underline} in Finland and Sweden[, but it was the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries that saw the **development of large-scale mines**
for metals such as iron copper, nickel, gold, tin, lead and
zinc.]{.underline} Many of these mines closed in the second half of the
twentieth century as the internationalisation of the mining industry
rendered them uneconomic. The Arctic is relatively unexplored for many
critical minerals as its physical remoteness and its harsh environment
present technological challenges and resultedly high production costs.
However, [the scale of future demand has triggered moves to assess the
potential for increased exploitation of critical minerals in this
region]{.underline}. Since 2023, several national governments in the
region have launched strategies to assess and develop critical mineral
resources in their Arctic regions.

#### US is capable of mining for REMs sustainably

"Mobilizing microbes: How can mining rare-earth elements become more
sustainable?," Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Studies,

[Our [reliance on rare earth elements]{.mark} is [not going to
end]{.mark} any time soon, so [researchers]{.mark} have begun to look
for ways to [obtain]{.mark} them in [less environmentally
harmful]{.mark} ways.]{.underline} A multidisciplinary team at
[Cornell]{.underline} is on the leading edge of this push to help green
technologies get even greener. Between the Department of Biological and
Environmental Engineering and the Department of Earth and Atmospheric
Sciences --- units shared between the College of Engineering (ENG) and
College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) --- faculty, postdocs
and graduate students have all come together to tackle this problem. Led
by Buz Barstow, assistant professor of biological and environmental
engineering (CALS), the team is looking at ways to "[program" microbes
to [produce organic acids]{.mark} that can [leach]{.mark}
[r]{.mark}are-[e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lements [from crushed
ores]{.mark} or from recycled electronics components.]{.underline}
[These microbial acids will be far [safer]{.mark} than the acids and
bases used in existing industrial processes.]{.underline} Altogether,
the processes Barstow and the team of engineers are pioneering can be
called "biomining," and if proven scalable, will have a [[major impact
on]{.mark} the [sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline} of future
electronics as well as on the health of people and the environment.
'Risky, cutting-edge work' Postdoctoral researcher Alexa Schmitz joined
Barstow's effort when, as a Cornell grad student earning her doctorate
in plant pathology and plant-microbe biology, she was in a biofuels
seminar presented by Barstow. But in the discussion afterward, he also
talked about bioleaching and its potential in the mining and recovery of
rare earths. "It felt like risky, cutting-edge work," says Schmitz, "but
at the same time I thought 'Yes. [This [can definitely
work]{.mark}]{.underline}.'" Schmitz was finishing her Ph.D. and looking
for a postdoctoral position, and Barstow was looking for help on his
biomining project after receiving an Academic Venture Fund seed grant
from the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability. Schmitz got to work
right away with a bacterium called Gluconobacter oxydans. It had already
been [[shown]{.mark} to have [potential]{.mark} as a bioleaching
microbe]{.underline} through initial work done at the U.S. Department of
Energy's Idaho National Laboratory. Schmitz used a method developed by
Barstow called Knockout Sudoku to selectively inactivate one gene at a
time and then build a collection of several thousand variants of G.
oxydans. Each of these variants will be tested as a bioleaching agent
for rare earths, and then those that perform best will be further
developed. As she gathers data, Schmitz -- who is continuing the work
with help from the Cornell Atkinson Small Grants Program -- says she
will be compiling a roster of genes that could be key to the development
of an [[efficient and sustainable]{.mark} system to extract rare
earths]{.underline}. microbes in a petri dish dived into eight quadrants
five stacks of gene screening trays petri dishes are stacked around a
woman working on a computer in a lab Mutant bacteria Monazite is one of
the ores known to contain rare earths in sufficient quantities to be
worth mining. Schmitz can't just throw a chunk of monazite and some
bacteria into a beaker and wait to see what happens. Rather, the initial
screening for genes that may be related to leaching of rare earths will
happen in microplates that can be read spectroscopically. Schmitz
explains, "Once we [[know]{.mark} which [genes]{.mark} are most
[important for bioleaching]{.mark}, we will [target those genes]{.mark}
-- and genetic elements controlling those genes -- for mutagenesis. This
can be [done in combination]{.mark}, targeting several genes at once,
and the resulting modified strains are screened for changes in
bioleaching]{.underline}." [Mutagenesis is a process whereby the genetic
information of an organism changes by mutation]{.underline}. That
mutation can be spontaneous or it can be controlled in a laboratory.
Schmitz and Barstow will force mutations on the genes that are most
involved in bioleaching and then [measure how effective the mutated
organism is at gathering available rare earths.]{.underline} Their hope
is that with a high-throughput method for evolving G. oxydans, they will
be able to [engineer an organism that can leach rare earths [more
efficient]{.mark}ly [and sustainabl]{.mark}y [than]{.mark} existing
[industrial methods]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is where Mingming Wu
comes in. Wu, a professor of biological and environmental engineering
(CALS), is an expert in microfluidic devices. Traditional methods of
identifying, isolating, and mutating microbes are labor and time
intensive, requiring a lot of careful and repetitive pipetting. "Buz and
I started to talk about his work," says Wu, "and we realized that in
[[microfluidics]{.mark} there [already exists]{.mark} an established
[way of identifying and selecting]{.mark} 'super-bugs' that exhibit a
desired characteristic.]{.underline}" This existing process is called
directed evolution. Together with Sean Medin, a second-year Ph.D.
student in Barstow's lab, the team is in the process of designing a
microfluidic device that forces individual bacteria through a channel,
with several "stations" along the way. "We can put sensors in the device
so that when a bacterium binds with a rare-earth element, it changes
color and we can see it," says Wu. "Those that bind will be sent down
one route in the device, and those that don't bind will be sent down
another route." The bacteria that worked will be directed back through
the device to a station where they will be mutagenized and then sent
through the device again. In this way, Barstow's team can create an
improved variant of the bacterium that Medin will be using to adsorb
rare earths. Recycling electronics and waste products In addition to
helping to craft the microfluidic device the group will use in their
process, Medin is also working on an [[essential step in]{.mark}
[biomining rare earths]{.mark} -- [separation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Once
the rare earths have been leached out of the monazite or other ores,
they still need to be separated from each other and from the impurities
that make it through the leaching process. [[Current method]{.mark}s of
separation, such as liquid-liquid solvent extraction and the
ion-exchange process, are [energy-intensive and]{.mark} result in large
amounts of dangerous [waste products.]{.mark}]{.underline} Medin will
instead use a [bacterium]{.underline} called Shewanella oneidensis MR-1,
and he will subject it to a similar directed evolution process that
Schmitz is using with G. oxydans. [Medin will be selecting for variants
that show higher than average ability to [adsorb rare
earths]{.mark}]{.underline}. These variants will be subjected to several
rounds of mutagenesis with the aim of [creating a bacterium that is able
to adsorb specific rare earths [in high quantity]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Medin joined the Barstow Lab with the express intent of working on this
project, and he hopes to someday start a company to commercialize some
of the processes honed in the lab. However, his focus would be on
[recycling existing rare earths from electronics, mine tailings and fly
ash, which is one of the waste products of coal combustion.]{.underline}
"Ideally," says Medin, "I'd like to be able to take fly ash or permanent
magnets or other recycled sources of rare-earth elements, bioleach them,
and then extract the rare earths out for reuse. And I'd like to do all
of that in the U.S. and make sure it is environmentally friendly."
Currently, the United States imports most of the rare earths it uses,
and recycles just a tiny percentage of rare-earth-containing products.

[The **first step** to mitigating climate change and its security
challenges is reaching zero-net carbon emissions]{.underline} by 2050,
an international goal established in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.
[To do so requires **massive global investment in green technologies**,
which will escalate requirements for non-carbon-emitting sources of
electricity]{.underline} and energy storage. A recent World Bank report
[projects increases in demand "up to nearly 500 percent for certain
minerals]{.underline}, especially those concentrated in energy storage
technologies, such as lithium, graphite, and cobalt."\[36\]

[Green energy technologies rely heavily on components constructed of a
range of mine]{.underline}rals that primarily reside near the bottom of
the periodic table of elements. These 17 rare earth elements exist in
deposits globally, with 75 percent concentrated in the Indo-Pacific
region; however, contrary to what their name implies, rare earth
elements are not rare, just complicated to extract and expensive to
refine.\[37\]

[To keep atmospheric temperatures **below a 2-degree Celsius increase**,
investment in green technology will drive global rare earth element
demand to an estimated 3.1 billion tons annually by 2050]{.underline}.
Furthermore, estimates predict demand will rise to 3.5 billion tons
annually to prevent global warming from exceeding 2 degrees
Celsius.\[38\] The U.S. defense industry amplifies rare earth element
demand far beyond global green energy, which further complicates
strategic implications. For instance, the U.S. requires about 940 pounds
of REEs to produce an F-35 strike fighter, 5200 pounds for each Aegis
destroyer, and nearly 9200 pounds for a Virginia-class submarine.\[39\]
As demand surges, supply chain security becomes an increasingly crucial
strategic issue for the U.S. as China controls approximately 85 percent
of global supply of rare earth elements.\[40\]

The initial danger seemed Shakespearian. In the summer of 2022,
the Economist fretted about Europe's looming "winter of discontent"
after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine upturned the continent's
energy system. [[The fear]{.underline}]{.mark}, echoed in other media,
[was]{.underline} that [[Russia would **use**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Europe's **reliance** on]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian [[hydrocarbons
to **weaken support**]{.mark} for Ukraine]{.underline} in the European
Union (EU). The threat of darkness, commentators argued, would chip away
at EU resolve to aid Kyiv. A year later, [this]{.underline} anticipated
tragedy [[did **not play out**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[the
EU]{.mark}]{.underline} has thus far [[**resisted** Russia's energy
**extortion**]{.underline}]{.mark} and maintained unity against the
Kremlin's invasion.

Such [[**momentum** may be **difficult** to
**maintain**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[however]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
Europe's decoupling from Russian hydrocarbons in the past year is just a
prelude to the longer-term push that is needed to achieve
decarbonization. [[**Ramping up** the]{.mark} energy
**[transition]{.mark}** in Europe [is key to lasting **energy
independence**]{.mark} from Russia]{.underline}, yet policies to advance
this agenda are facing new headwinds. Meanwhile, the consequences of
insufficient action on climate are increasing. Last year, Europe faced
severe drought, floods, and forest fires. These climate change-related
disasters had further far-reaching impacts across European society,
from food production to power generation. More than 60,000 people died
in heat waves across Europe last year. To demonstrate its sovereignty
against Russian aggression and to reaffirm the continent's role as a
global climate leader, [[Europe must]{.underline}]{.mark} continue to
**[[reduce]{.underline}]{.mark}** its [[reliance on **Russian
fuels**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[while pursuing]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[more]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[ambitious]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[re]{.mark}**newable energy]{.underline}
[[projects]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Europe's energy triumph

Before its invasion of Ukraine, Russian exports covered 40 percent of
the EU's natural gas demand, 25 percent of crude oil demand, 40 percent
of road diesel demand, and 30 percent of hard coal demand. Consequently,
when Moscow cut natural gas supply to some member states in response
to EU sanctions, gas prices quadrupled in the summer of 2022,
topping 345 euros per MWh. Initially, many believed Russia's energy
extortion would force the EU into remaining passive in the face of the
Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, particularly in the lead-up to the winter
of 2022.

Despite such issues, [[Europe's]{.mark} energy [system]{.mark} has [thus
far **avoided** the **worst-case**]{.mark} scenarios]{.underline}. In
fact, the continent has curtailed demand, pursued new international
partnerships for supply, and increased gas grid resilience through
new transmission infrastructure. [Much of this was accomplished through
the **REPowerEU** package]{.underline}, which launched in May 2022.
Among other ambitious energy security goals, it called for dramatic
decreases in EU imports of Russian hydrocarbons and for developing
long-term renewable energy projects to cut carbon emissions. [[**US**
solidarity has been **crucial**]{.mark} for Europe]{.underline}, as
[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has
[[built out its **export capacity**]{.underline}]{.mark} and is now
Europe's top supplier of both natural gas and crude oil. Additionally,
EU import bans on Russian coal, seaborne crude oil shipments, and
refined oil products have gone into effect in August 2022, December
2022, and February 2023, respectively. (Czechia, Slovakia, Hungary, and
Bulgaria successfully sought exemptions to certain oil product import
bans. The exemptions are meant to be temporary, but could be extended.)

REPowerEU has also encouraged public and private investments into
increasing the proportion of renewable power in Europe's energy supply.
As a result of this encouragement and EU member states' individual drive
for progress, solar installations increased by 47 percent, battery
storage surged by 79 percent, heat pump adoption increased by nearly
half, and overall investment in clean technologies jumped by nearly a
third from 2021 to 2022.

A winter's tale

Regardless of such successes, there is no guarantee that the EU will
face similar circumstances in the coming winter. A handful of member
states fell short of the EU-wide target to reduce gas consumption by 15
percent even though member states voted to extend the temporary
reduction target through to March 2024. Meanwhile, production
curtailments accounted for around half of the recent decline in
industrial gas demand, and almost another third of the demand reduction
was met by fuel-switching, primarily toward oil products. Oil, of
course, is significantly more polluting than gas, and risks setting the
EU back on its climate goals. In short, what appears to be an
improvement---reduced industrial gas demand---may in fact carry big
environmental costs and be unsustainable.

Additionally, Russia remains the second-largest source of Europe's
uranium and the largest foreign provider of nuclear utility services.
According to Euratom, the EU as a bloc imported 20 percent of its
natural uranium and 26 percent of its enrichment services from Russia in
2020. The EU's share of Russian uranium imports decreased
to approximately 17 percent in 2022, but its continued provision of
uranium has drawn increasing concern from Ukrainian officials and
transatlantic security experts. 

Several EU members continue to rely on Russian nuclear energy services.
French state-owned EDF, for example, maintains strong research and trade
ties with the Russian state-owned nuclear energy company Rosatom. Since
the 1970s, Rosatom has built reactors that are still operational in five
EU countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Finland, Hungary, and Slovakia), and it
is currently constructing new reactors in Hungary. To their credit, EU
members that have previously been more reliant on Rosatom have begun
looking for uranium and nuclear energy partners
elsewhere. Bulgaria, Czechia, and Slovakia have already secured
alternative supply from US-based Westinghouse, and Slovakia may also
halt construction of two Russian plants. It is imperative for EU
countries to find alternative sources of uranium extraction, processing,
and refining, and nuclear energy expertise, to ensure that they can
greatly reduce their reliance on Russia for these resources to further
strengthen their defenses against Russian aggression.

Europe needs an energy transition to break free of Russia

Even as the EU reduces its fuel-based reliance on Russia, the European
Environment Agency recently estimated that weather- and climate-related
extremes cost member states 560 billion euros from 1980 to 2021. Worse,
10 percent of the 560-billion-euro damage was felt in 2021 alone, and
annual climate change-related costs will likely only rise---as
demonstrated by disruptive drought and heat waves this summer. In total,
the European Commission now estimates that 700 billion euros a year of
investment is needed *in addition* to the 578 billion euros that has
already been earmarked to transition the energy system. Achieving the
profound changes required can establish lasting energy
independence---but also, importantly, will ensure resilience to a
rapidly changing global climate. 

However, [[Europe's]{.mark} energy [**transition** has]{.mark} recently
[been **plagued** by **delays**]{.mark} in policymaking and
implementation]{.underline}, such as protracted disputes over the role
that combustion engine bans can play in decarbonizing the EU economy.
Deliberation on the role of nuclear energy in the future energy mix has
stalled progress on emissions reduction targets, standards for hydrogen
production, funding guidelines for that production, and plans
for electricity market reforms, among others. EU policymakers must not
let internal disputes slow the momentum of the energy transition ignited
by the 2022 energy crisis, particularly in the implementation of
the Green Deal Industrial Plan, which is already facing significant
funding issues even with its Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform,
the European Commission's resource to support domestic industries.

The picture that is emerging, therefore, is one of a
[[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[remains **at risk**]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} Russian [energy **extortion**]{.mark}]{.underline} as long
[[as its]{.mark} energy [**transition** remains
**incomplete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, the European Union should
redouble its efforts. Although Russia's invasion of Ukraine commenced
eighteen months ago, [Europe must remain **committed**]{.underline} to
its campaign [to **reduce**]{.underline} its [reliance on **Russian
energy** resources]{.underline} and address the threat of climate
change.

#### CP Fails - Only deep sea mining can solve renewables *[fast enough]{.underline}* to stop catastrophic warming

from the Clarion‐Clipperton Zone,\" PubMed Central (PMC),
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9300171/)//bp

Are deep‐sea metals needed? [Some opponents of deep‐sea mining
[argue]{.mark} this point, suggesting [there is no need for the new
metal source]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., FFI 2020, Greenpeace
International, 2019; Harris, 2019; LaBossiere, 2018; Miller, Brigden, et
al., 2021). [Three common suggestions to eliminate the need are
reduction in overall metal consumption, development of new battery
technologies, and/or increased recycling. All are [aspirational
objectives]{.mark}, but they [are **currently insufficient to
meet**]{.mark} **projected mid‐term [metal and environmental
needs]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The first contention is that perhaps metal
consumption can be reduced]{.underline}. However, **[[a substantial rise
in metal demand]{.mark} in the next 20 years [appears highly likely,
driven]{.mark} [by global trends and government
targets]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., Campagnol et al., 2017). [In a
projected scenario for [constraining]{.mark} temperature rise
[by]{.mark} 2050 to [2°C]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[base metal
demands]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[for electric vehicle (EV) batteries
[could increase 11‐fold]{.mark}]{.underline}** beyond today\'s levels
(Watari et al., 2020; World Bank, 2017); or even more, as Xu et al.
(2020) estimated a 17--19 fold increase for cobalt and a 28--[[31
fold]{.mark} increase [for nickel]{.mark}]{.underline} from 2020 to 2050
if lithium nickel‐manganese‐cobalt (NMC) oxide batteries continue to
dominate. Still, [Teske]{.underline} et al. (2016) [asserted that
land‐based metal resources are more than adequate]{.underline} to
support a transition toward a 100% renewable energy supply, even
assuming aggressive growth rates and ambitious energy standards.
However, [**adequate [in‐the‐ground resources do not equate to]{.mark}
an economically [viable project pipeline]{.mark}**. Multiple factors
such as ore grades; the [costs]{.mark} of obtaining, transporting, and
refining ores; and [available]{.mark} extraction and processing
[tech]{.mark}nologies determine the extent to which resources in the
ground can be economically mined.]{.underline} Based on project pipeline
and investment levels compared with expected demand, shortages of cobalt
and/or class 1 nickel are expected as soon as 2025 (Azevado et al.,
2020; Campagnol et al., 2018; Desai, 2019). Indeed, the Scientific and
Technical Committee (STAP) of the Global Environmental Facility has
recently added Oceanic Minerals to its agenda for technical critical
elements (Ali & Katima, 2020). At: innovation solves REM demand The
second contention is that battery manufacturers might innovate away from
heavy reliance on these critical metals. Indeed, although much of the
global EV industry relies on NMC‐type batteries, innovations are
underway. Whether and how quickly advances in batteries might obviate
the need for seabed metals has substantial material significance, but
also ethical consequences related to the types and amounts of
environmental or social harm that result. Efforts are underway to reduce
or eliminate cobalt---largely to reduce corporate exposure to
unregulated mining in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that
employs children (Lichner, 2020). For instance, batteries for Ford Motor
Company\'s 2022 all‐electric F‐150 pickup truck will reduce cobalt and
manganese proportions to 5% each, although increasing nickel content to
90% ("NMC nine‐half‐half"; Halvorson, 2020). In addition, cobalt‐ and
nickel‐free battery formulations are being investigated (Grey & Hall,
2020), with lithium--iron--phosphate (LFP) batteries a viable solution
for low‐cost, low‐range EVs (Ali & Katima, 2020) although with lower
energy density and poorer low‐temperature performance (Randall, 2020;
Rudisuela, 2020). Lithium--iron--phosphate batteries make up 14.3% of
the EV battery market as of 2021 (Els, 2021), with Tesla equipping them
in some Model 3 EVs for Chinese markets (Els, 2021), and China\'s BYD,
the second‐largest EV producer, using LFP for its entire fleet
(Mining.com, 2021). Lithium--iron--phosphate batteries may complement
NMC for differing product requirements; meanwhile manufacturing lines to
build LFP and nickel‐based batteries at high volume are under
development. Once they are in place, if a more favorable battery
chemistry is invented and brought to market, large‐scale replacement of
NMC batteries would likely require a decadal time scale. Twenty‐five
years has been a typical investment cycle for major refurbishments (IEA,
2020), and generational improvements in heavy industry have historically
taken several decades (Pae & Lehmann, 2003). Supply‐chain development,
production, and fleet‐wide deployment of a new battery technology (or
fuel, such as hydrogen) that eliminates the need for nodule‐derived
metals might proceed somewhat faster, but it would likely still require
a decade or more (Grey & Hall, 2020). At: recycling If LFP or other
chemistries cannot displace nickel‐based batteries, then the third
contention remains: Perhaps recycling could eliminate the need for
seabed metals. However, recycling cannot meet current battery‐metal
demand, let alone mid‐term future battery‐metal demand in a growing
market, because there is insufficient metal in circulation or in
landfills to be reclaimed (Ali et al., 2017; Ali & Katima, 2020;
Herrington, 2021; World Bank, 2020a). As one example, in 2020 recycled
material supplied only 37% of the nickel for its major current use,
stainless steel production (International Nickel Study Group \[INSG\],
2021). Moreover, many of today\'s EV batteries are constructed in ways
that hinder recycling (Morse, 2021), and repurposing used EV batteries
for stationary energy storage, although environmentally beneficial,
could also slow the rate of recycling (Xu et al., 2020). Because metal
economies are global, with numerous consumers and producers and
intricate supply chains (e.g., Melin et al., 2021), creating a circular
economy is very complex, and doing it quickly would require cooperation
at unprecedented speed and scale (Ghisellini et al., 2015). Because
[**[demand reduction, technology]{.mark} [innovation, an]{.mark}d/or
[circular economies cannot quickly meet metal demands for the
renewable]{.mark} energy [transition]{.mark}**, primary metals will be
extracted in the interim.]{.underline} These marginal metal quantities
can come from terrestrial mines and/or the deep sea. In their
demand‐reduction argument, Teske et al. (2016) did not evaluate the
incremental environmental, social, and economic effects of increased
terrestrial mining should deep‐sea metals not be used. Nickel mining
relies increasingly on laterites underlying biodiverse tropical
rainforests. Hein et al. (2020) stated that use [of deep‐[ocean
metals]{.mark} might help to [reduce]{.mark} the pressure for
[defo]{.mark}restation in ecologically sensitive ecosystems; this is
particularly important when [forests are needed to fulfill]{.mark}
recent [climate]{.mark} treaties and UN SDGs. **Environmental, social,
and economic effects of [terrestrial mining]{.mark} are further
exacerbated by [declining ore grades]{.mark} of copper and nickel, with
greater ore required for the same metal output, so [a greater life‐cycle
footprint]{.mark} to produce the same metal**]{.underline} (see e.g.,
dynamic life‐cycle analyses by van der Voet et al., 2018). Amid a
shrinking time frame to mitigate multiple global crises, considering

**[Is Mining The Ocean Bottom For Metals Really Better Than Mining On
Land]{.underline}**? It **[certainly]{.underline}** looks like it.
**[From]{.underline}** almost **[any perspective, [seabed mining]{.mark}
of metals [is better for the environment, social justice issues and
economics.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[A large continuous supply]{.mark}
of special economic metals [is essential for]{.mark} any high
[tech]{.mark} future]{.underline}**. Building electric
[[vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} wind [[turbines take a
lot of]{.mark} resources]{.underline}, more than we can provide now,
[particularly]{.underline} special metals like Co, Li, Te and Nd, as
well as just base metals like Fe, Cu, Pb and Zn, and other [[rare
earth]{.mark} elements]{.underline}. Even other materials like graphite.
But their supply is generally an environmental and social nightmare[.
The [waste]{.mark} from Li, graphite and high-purity-Si processing has
[destroyed whole villages]{.mark} and ecosystems in China, Indonesia and
Bolivia,]{.underline} among others. [[America is still dealing
with]{.mark} the [acid mine drainag]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark} left
from 120 years of mining. And like blood diamonds, [half]{.underline} of
the Co supplies [**come from inhumane child labor practices.** The
reason this is so important is that many of the people who support the
new energy technological revolution of non-fossil fuels and
renewables]{.underline}, electric vehicles[, conservation and
efficiency, also care about the social issues that many of these
technologies incorporate in their wake - corruption, environmental
pollution, extreme poverty and child labor.]{.underline} Not the image
sought by people at the shade-grown coffee shop surfing the internet for
free-range eggs on their iPhones. [Just the [carbon intensity]{.mark}
alone [of producing]{.mark} these metals has led to growing interest in
low-carbon metal sources]{.underline}. Last year, Elon Musk promised "a
giant contract" for nickel mined "efficiently and in an environmentally
sensitive way." And it has already sparked some significant changes. So
**[new metal sources should consider their [life-cycle carbon
footprint]{.mark}]{.underline}**, environmental pollution and social
justice effects. **[Everyone agrees that recycling what metals we have
is the best thing to do, but [we'll need dozens of times]{.mark} the
amount of [critical metals we have now, even if we recycle
100%.]{.mark}]{.underline}** We need 3 billion fully electric vehicles
worldwide and 10 trillion kWh/yr more by 2040 to have any chance of
achieving our climate goals. Recycling and conservation of metals won't
make a dent in this. Enter mining the seafloor for manganese nodules.
Geologists have long known that **[[the ocean floor is chock
full]{.mark} of metals]{.underline}** -- Cu, Ni, Ag, Au, Pt and even
diamonds[. Manganese nodules are polymetallic rock concretions that lie
loosely on the sea floor or buried shallowly in the
sediment]{.underline} (see figure above). These nodules occur in most
oceans, even in some lakes, and are abundant on the abyssal plains of
the deep ocean between 4,000 and 6,000 meters (13,000 and 20,000 ft).
[The nodules can be harvested from the sea floor bottom
easily.]{.underline} The Clarion-Clipperton Zone is the largest of the
most economic zones, about the size of Europe, extending from the west
coast of Mexico to Hawaii. The total mass of manganese nodules there is
over 21 billion tons. Other important areas include the Peru Basin, the
Penrhyn Basin near the Cook Islands, and the central Indian Ocean. These
areas are overseen by the United Nations International Seabed Authority
(ISA). **[\<Graphic omitted\>]{.underline}** Unlike metal ores on land
which rarely have metal yields above 20%, and are often less than 2%,
these seabed nodules are 99% usable minerals -- 33% metal and the rest
useful in products like construction aggregate and fertilizer since
**[[there are no toxic levels of heavy elements]{.mark} like mercury or
arsenic. [So there's no]{.mark} toxic [tailings]{.mark} or mining waste
like on land, [no defo]{.mark}restation, no open pits, [no contaminated
rivers]{.mark} or aquifers, and no tailings impoundments Seabed mining
doesn't use child labor]{.underline}** like much of the land mining
does. **[And it has a life-cycle [carbon footprint that is 90%
less]{.mark} than land mining.]{.underline}** A recent study by Paulikas
et al. (2020) compares land and ocean mining from several viewpoints and
some of the results are summarized in the table above. Other
peer-reviewed studies show similar results. So what's not to like about
this? Pretty much just the habitat effects. The mining, pumping and
cleaning of the manganese nodules can create sediments, noise and
vibrations. So [the]{.underline} big [question]{.underline}, and the
final decision, [is]{.underline} -- are the advantages in carbon,
pollution and social justice more important than the ecosystem damage to
the ocean floor? And [can we minimize that ecosystem
damage?]{.underline} Enter DeepGreen Metals, Inc. DeepGreen is a
Canadian company working in an ISA-granted portion of the
Clarion-Clipperton Zone. They are currently carrying out a multi-year
environmental impact assessment to fully understand and to mitigate
against potential harm to the environment. There are a few key elements
about the area, and the process, that are important. [**\<Graphic
omitted\>** The [Clarion]{.mark}]{.underline} Clipperton **[Zone [is one
of the least productive areas of the ocean]{.mark}, with one of the
lowest biomass environments on the planet, very like deserts on
land]{.underline}**. The Abyssal CCZ is home to 300 times less biomass
than in an average biome on land, and up to 3000 times less compared to
rainforest regions where a lot of mining takes place. [[There are no
plants]{.mark}, 70% of life exists as bacteria]{.underline}, and most
organisms are smaller than 4cm (see figure above). DeepGreen just
combined with Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation (SOAC)
to form The Metals Company (TMC). TMC's operations will be monitored in
real time and shared with regulators and the public. The company is
developing an adaptive management system that will allow them to avoid
ecologically-sensitive areas and to monitor current and adjust the
movement of collector vehicles to limit transport of sediment outside of
their operating area. **[[Noise levels are less tha]{.mark}n those from
[normal marine industrial and military]{.mark}
[operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** and while TMC's operating area does
not coincide with any breeding or feeding grounds, [this system will
assist the company in remaining aware of any larger animals that may
migrate through this area in order to reduce the impacts of this
noise]{.underline}.[As to sediment released into the water column**,
various [experimental studies]{.mark}**]{.underline} currently in
peer-review -- including those conducted by TMC when it was DeepGreen --
**[[show extremely high dilution of sediment]{.mark} concentration per
liter within moments of discharge]{.underline}**. Furthermore, this work
shows that it would take numerous large-scale operations working
concurrently to raise particle concentrations above background levels
measured in the CCZ. In addition, if all particles introduced into the
water column by these operations rapidly sank to the seafloor CCZ area,
the resulting fallout would be 0.02 micrograms per year---just 2% of the
observed normal sedimentation rate in the CCZ of 1 microgram per year.
Based on 11 seafloor disturbance and commercial mining studies,
**[[ecological recovery rates]{.mark} for nodule collection [are much
lower than]{.mark} those for [mining on land]{.mark} -- decades versus
millenia]{.underline}**. The ISA has set aside more areas for protection
(1.44 million km2) than is currently under exploration (1.1 million km2)
and contractors will set side further areas and leave behind 15% of
nodules to further aid recovery. Finally, research being conducted will
determine where it is best to return the process water. It looks to be
around 1,500 meters depth, well below the euphotic zone (where light
penetrates), where there is unlikely to be any significant impact on
organisms in the water column and where the temperature difference
between that water and the water on the ocean floor won't cause
significant effects. **[All told, these [processes are unlikely to cause
the widespread die-offs]{.mark}]{.underline}** so feared by many,
including myself.

These reports are well-intentioned in their [use of the [precautionary
principle]{.mark}]{.underline} and have received stellar endorsements
from great doyens of oceanic conservation such as Sir David Attenborough
and Sylvia Earle. [However, precaution operates on a spectrum as with
any human endeavor, and **the principle cannot be [used as]{.mark} an
[excuse for indefinite inertia]{.mark} in a world with competing
challenges**]{.underline}. [Caution is in order but **[indeterminate
precaution is]{.mark} an [untenable]{.mark} postulate [that can lead to
societal paralysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For functional purposes, a
systems science approach is needed to consider the way forward as the
deep sea mining enterprise has to try and optimize four overarching and
potentially competing objectives]{.underline}: a) [Comparative
environmental and social impact of mining on terrestrial versus oceanic
ecosystems]{.underline}; b) [Supply projections for key critical metals
from terrestrial ore reserves]{.underline} (economically viable
deposits) and resources (geologically available but currently not
economically viable deposits); and from recycled sources and more
resource efficient practices; c) [Demand projections for critical metals
needed for the transition to cleaner energy sources]{.underline} such as
wind and solar power as well as for batteries for electric vehicles and
smart-grids; d) [Revenue generation potential for sponsoring Small
Island Developing States]{.underline} (SIDS) who are partnering with
industry for deposit exploration. This is a momentous year for the
International Seabed Authority (ISA), which was formed over two decades
ago as part of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention, and is
planning to release a set of environmental standards and guidelines
related to the implementation of its mining code. In this article, I
provide a review of some of the key issues that can help to extricate
the points of contention for more informed decision-making. Comparative
ecological impact categories There are a range of ecological impacts
which are a point of conservation concern around deep sea mining and
vary from the kind of location where mining is to occur. Mineral
deposits in the deep seas can be found in i) polymetallic nodules on the
seabed; ii) seamount metallic (ferromanganese) crusts; and iii) sulfide
deposits in extinct hydrothermal vents. Currently 18 exploration
contracts have been granted for polymetallic nodules in the
Clarion-Clipperton Fracture Zone (16), Central Indian Ocean Basin (1)
and Western Pacific Ocean (1). There are 7 contracts for exploration for
polymetallic sulphides in the South West Indian Ridge, Central Indian
Ridge and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and 5 contracts for exploration for
cobalt-rich crusts in the Western Pacific Ocean. Of these systems, the
gravest concern of impact is near hydrothermal vent sulfide deposits.
Notably the scaly-foot snail (Chrysomallon squamiferum), is found
exclusively on three hydrothermal vent systems in the Indian Ocean at
depths of over 2,400 m, and was placed on the International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List in June 2019 due to two of the
three systems falling within the boundaries of exploratory mining
licenses granted by the International Seabed Authority. However, **[the
most [advanced mining]{.mark} exploration that has moved forward thus
far and [shown to be economically viable is]{.mark} largely [focusing on
polymetallic nodules]{.mark}, [which occur in]{.mark} arguably [the
least species diverse of]{.mark} the three
[ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [No doubt, the ecology around these
nodules is unique and all activities must proceed with great care
regardless of absolute diversity estimates thus far]{.underline}. In
particular, the microbes which are believed to have led to the accretion
of the metallic deposits pose a fascinating area for research in terms
of their pharmacological properties. To this end, the industry and the
ISA has committed to only allowing for mining to occur if there are two
\"reference zones\" which have been allocated for conservation purposes
and for impact measurement purposes of at least equivalent size.
Although some conservationists have questioned the efficacy of the
concept of \"no net loss\", we undertake this approach constantly
through protected areas management on land and in the oceans. [A lot of
the efficacy depends on the level of homogeneity of particular
systems]{.underline}. Thus coral reefs and active hydrothermal vents
which are highly heterogeneous systems are not appropriate for such an
approach but the vast deep sea nodule plains may well be so. [The
characterization of these reference zones is an important protective
feature that is now being studied in detail]{.underline}. **[Notably, an
[equivalent protective feature]{.mark} of this kind [is not]{.mark}
generally [required in terrestrial mining sites that]{.mark} may [occur
in]{.mark} potentially even [more biodiverse]{.mark} and vulnerable
[ecosystems such as rainforests]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Ultimately, the
environmental impacts will need to be considered as a comparative life
cycle assessment between terrestrial and oceanic minerals. Such an
assessment has been undertaken and published in a peer-reviewed
well-ranked journal (I am a contributing author to this study along with
Steve Katona, cofounder of the Ocean Health Index). [Separate
peer-reviewed studies have provided a framework for looking at the full
[impact]{.mark} considerations, which are likely to be **[less than
terrestrial mining]{.mark}**, largely owing to **minimal processing
energy requirements**]{.underline}. **[Even more significantly, the
[waste]{.mark} generation [and hazard of tailings dams]{.mark} that come
from terrestrial mines [is mitigated]{.mark} in the case of oceanic
minerals]{.underline}**. Assessments of the discharges from the shipping
vessels that undertake initial processing of the ore residues, as well
as the plumes of sediment generated along the water column as the
minerals are retrieved to the surface are still to be fully evaluated. A
team led by Thomas Peacock at MIT has undertaken some of this research
for the International Seabed Authority and published findings in July
2021. [Studies from earlier deep sea disturbances that occurred in the
1970s and 80s during often clandestine exploration activities without
any mitigation measures are not a suitable comparison]{.underline}
(though can inform the standards development) [with the current state of
equipment and technology being tested]{.underline}. [The same can be
said of older techniques for terrestrial mining compared with modern
practices]{.underline}. Another area of concern that has been noted by
some activists pertains to accidental methane releases from hydrate
deposits in the deep sea which could contribute to carbon emissions. The
temperature, pressure and geochemistry of the region of the ocean where
current mining is being considered so far does not appear to be a point
of concern in this regard. Furthermore, methane extraction itself as a
resource remains a point of consideration and if there was such a
concern, it could potentially be harnessed as a resource, or for
mitigation purposes. Comparative social impacts and lessons from the
Nautilus venture The social impact comparisons of oceanic mining with
terrestrial mining equivalents are far more clear in terms of
evaluation. **[Most significantly, [there are no]{.mark} major [concerns
of]{.mark} [h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights [abuses]{.mark}, child labor,
[human trafficking]{.mark} [or]{.mark} property appropriations and
[resettlement]{.mark} that beset many terrestrial mining
conflicts]{.underline}**. Of course the broader fishing and shipping
industry has these social afflictions but the detailed oversight of all
DSM vessels would prevent their prevalence in the sector. An area of
potential social contention is the interaction between DSM activities
and fisheries which could indirectly have social consequences. [However,
the single biggest threat to fisheries is commercial and often illegal
fishing of vulnerable stocks]{.underline}. [The impact of DSM on
fisheries should certainly be monitored closely as the infrastructure is
tested]{.underline}. There are also some interesting comparisons on
fisheries in terms of noise and infrastructure development that can be
compared with the oil and gas sector with which we have considerable
long-term experience of measuring impacts. With oil and gas
infrastructure there is far greater danger of catastrophic failure and
large leaks or explosions from the deposit itself. **[However, the
precautionary principle has been largely undermined in this context by
major OECD countries for energy resource expediency]{.underline}**.
Another comparison that is often raised with reference to social
concerns about deep sea mining, is a comparison with the beleaguered
Solwara 1 project by now defunct Nautilus Minerals. The demise of that
project was due to a combination of investment flight and social
concerns and opposition from coastal communities in Papua New Guinea,
under whose maritime jurisdiction the project was being developed. None
of those particular concerns would be applicable in remote parts of the
ocean where deep sea mining is being developed. A plausible point raised
by activists is that the environmental mitigation code being considered
by the ISA a decade ago was to be modeled after the proposed measures
from the International Marine Minerals Society. However, the current
deliberations on the code are highly divergent and are more likely to
consider best practices from the oil and gas sector as well as the
maritime diamond mining sector operating off the coast of Namibia. There
is also a financial concern that is often noted about poor small island
states investing in seabed mining and losing precious public funds in
such ventures. For sure, caution is in order as there have been some
heinous cases of poor extractive industry investments spurred on by
misleading forecasts of fortune. However, [there are numerous financial
safeguards and wealth distribution mechanisms under the \"common
heritage of humankind\" provisions of the Law of the Sea Convention in
this regard]{.underline}. **[Furthermore, the [minerals]{.mark} being
extracted [are the antithesis of fossil fuels in terms of]{.mark} their
potential [support for]{.mark} solving the [climate]{.mark}
crisis]{.underline}**. **[Thus oceanic minerals have far greater chance
for future market security than the conventional terrestrial stranded
assets that are causing concern among development
practitioners]{.underline}**. Furthermore, [the COVID crisis has led
many small island states to consider ways of diversifying their
economies, since reliance on tourism is so highly capricious in terms of
extreme weather events or global emergencies such as the current
pandemic]{.underline}. A country like Nauru, which has a tragic history
of phosphate mining plunder on its territory, has invested in deep sea
mining as a diversifying off shore investment, that would not have a
direct ecological impact on its inhabitants. A detailed cost-benefit
analysis of manganese nodules extraction for the Cook Islands conducted
by the European Commission and the Pacific Community (SPC) suggested a
net benefit of over \$494 million over the life of a potentially
feasible project. Mineral demand and supply scenarios The potential for
stranded investment concerns stems often from debates in the literature
related to the future demand for specific oceanic metals such as cobalt,
nickel and manganese. Commodity prices fluctuate wildly and this can
arguably have impact on the fortune of resource dependent economies,
though strong institutions have shown to offset these effects. In any
event, the latest demand scenarios indicate that substitution for the
key metals that could be extracted from nodules is unlikely to occur
because of fundamental electrochemical advantages of those elements and
existing infrastructure investment in their manufacturing. Substitutes
for copper have been predicted for decades and even after the advent of
fiber optics cables that took a bite out of copper demand, the metal\'s
need remains salient. [Even if alternatives are found, the appliance or
device intake for batteries is modular, and having a variety of products
using different kinds of metal electrodes would be advantageous and lead
to more resilience in the system]{.underline}. Recycling of batteries
and the potential for a circular economy are also important future
supply sources for these metals. In China, \"urban mining of metals\"
for recycling may well meet some aspects of demand. [However, a range of
scenarios studied by the World Bank in their most recent assessment
indicate that **[recycling would not be able to meet demand needed for
green]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology uptake to reach the climate mitigation
targets**]{.underline}. [Recycling also poses an intriguing
sustainability challenge since in order to have stock for recycling it
becomes necessary to make existing infrastructure more
obsolescent]{.underline}. **[Overall such an outcome may be worse in
terms of sustainability metrics if there is too much focus on recycling
primacy without a mix of supply sources]{.underline}**. [Furthermore, in
terms of the development impact of the metals being harnessed by small
island states could also merit them being preferentially sourced, which
in some cases might even justify a development premium for
consumers]{.underline}. **[Opportunities for metal stockpiling can also
modulate price shocks and unlike agricultural products there is no
\"shelf life\" challenge for long-term storage]{.underline}**.
Institutional context and errant comparisons The prospect of a positive
premium for deep sea mining metals seems very remote at present since it
is instead being stigmatized by several civil society groups as a
potential ecological threat. Unfortunately, the current polarization is
a result of a lack of trust with institutions managing the process,
particularly the International Seabed Authority. Criticism of the
organization rests on its dual mandate to facilitate development while
also regulating activities. There have been numerous proposals for
improving the transparency of the organization\'s activities which
deserve attention. In particular the Legal and Technical Commission of
the organization could be an area where further reform could help to
build trust with environmental organizations and activists. Having
greater independent governance and oversight of this committee could be
considered within the framework of the UNCLOS mandate. However, [such
reform, nor the need for further biological research, seem appropriate
grounds to call for a moratorium on exploration licenses for deep sea
mining]{.underline}. Comparisons with the moratorium under the Antarctic
Treaty are not congruent since Antarctica has competing territorial
claims and there is no corollary body of oversight and due diligence for
mineral exploration similar to the ISA. Furthermore, there has in fact
been a de facto moratorium on deep sea mining for the past 20 years even
though technology had been developed for such activity going back at
least 3 decades. The hiatus in development was largely owing to
deliberative processes and research to address many of the concerns
already raised and in the process of being addressed through the
regulatory process. Any mining licenses, following viable reserves being
found, would take several more years to develop in any case. [We are at
a momentous time of the great energy transition alongside the need for
diversification of oceanic economies of states]{.underline}. [There are
also international legal mechanisms for biodiversity protection which
are emerging specifically for oceans, such as a new treaty for marine
protection, alongside work by the High Level Panel on
Oceans]{.underline}. Concerns over marine pollution from the surface
activities of DSM would fall under the existing International Convention
on the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). There are
broad conservation monitoring guidelines which have already been widely
studied in recent literature, though the role which mineral exploration
can play in resourcing such programs deserves greater attention. The way
forward for sensible conversations [Oceanic minerals development needs
to be considered as part of a socio-ecological conversation about
planetary sustainability at supply and demand nodes]{.underline}.
**[Epithets such as \"extractive capitalism\" are also not appropriate
for an activity which is in fact being [undertaken through]{.mark} an
[unprecedented public-private partnership for global revenue
sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even though the activity will be far
from any human habitation, there is still a presumption by some
opponents of its impact being linked to social concerns on land.
**[However, such discourse is [holding the industry to a standard not
even terrestrial mining is held to]{.mark} in terms of the locus of
impact and legitimacy of community dissent]{.underline}**. [The level of
global deliberations that are being carried out in this regard provide
us with a rare opportunity to be proactive in environmental regulatory
action rather than reactive]{.underline}. [The environmental movement
should learn some of the lessons of its absolutist opposition to nuclear
power which led to industrial research stagnation and a lost opportunity
for climate mitigation because of extreme risk aversion]{.underline}.
**[Resilience of natural maritime systems, even after nuclear exposure
also needs to be considered]{.underline}**. In the Bikini atoll where 23
nuclear tests were conducted (including the largest ever nuclear
explosion), biodiversity studies conducted fifty years hence show
remarkable recovery. Of course the social consequences of this testing
were immense but that is precisely why it is important extricate social
and ecological impacts in the high seas. [Allowing for this frontier
industry to cautiously proceed with careful monitoring and governance
reform of the International Seabed Authority would be the sensible way
forward for meeting the Sustainable Development Goal and targets related
to the oceans]{.underline} (SDG 14, particularly Targets 14.7, A, B and
C).

[The global economy]{.underline}, and the increasingly digital and
digitized lifestyles many of us in fully industrialized countries are
becoming accustomed to, currently [depends on critical metals such as
cobalt to make]{.underline} computers, phones, batteries, and cars
function. It is also now an essential material input
into [future]{.underline} [low-carbon transitions]{.underline} that will
depend on mitigating climate change through the massive deployment
of [smart meters, heat pumps, electric vehicles, solar panels, wind
farms, fuel cells, and energy storage systems]{.underline}, which **[all
will require cobalt and copper]{.underline}**. [But]{.underline} [the
way this cobalt is]{.underline} [currently]{.underline} [mined, in the
world\'s leading producer with also the world\'s leading amount of
reserves,]{.underline} [only serves
to]{.underline} **[exploit]{.underline}** [some of]{.underline} [the
very vulnerable groups seeking to provide it.]{.underline} [In this
way,]{.underline} [**slavery, environmental degradation, patriarchy, and
climate change all become linked**;]{.underline} [all are driven by the
logics of exploitation of either resources or wealth, or natural
ecosystems or people]{.underline} (Bales 2016). [They
become]{.underline} [entrapped into forms of "modern slavery,"
and]{.underline} [precariously vulnerable to cycles of "dispossession"
and "gendered" structures of norms, identities, and
relations.]{.underline} **[Subterranean slavery and patriarchy come to
support future sustainability transitions.]{.underline}** [In some ways,
the people mining cobalt become almost as disposable as the products
they help to make.]{.underline} For example, ASM **[cobalt
miners]{.underline}**, who **[provide roughly 20% of national supply in
the DRC]{.underline}** and thus about 12.9% of global cobalt supply,
often [have tenuous legal standing, lack any sort of protection, and are
constantly exploited by government institutions, the police, and even
other bosses, traders, and local communities as
they]{.underline} [operate at the bottom of a hierarchy]{.underline} of
Congolese power relations. [Women and girls]{.underline}, who are
socially stigmatized away from mining, in reality often [take the worst
jobs]{.underline}---[digging in the rain or heat, carrying, sorting, or
hauling water]{.underline}---[for less pay or status than their male
counterparts]{.underline}, all while they must also continue to raise a
family and meet domestic norms of maintaining household. Women and
girls, [some as young as
12]{.underline}, [also]{.underline} [become]{.underline} **[exploited as
prostitutes]{.underline}** [and sex workers to]{.underline} [**serve the
mining communities**, or locked into domestically abusive and polygamous
relationships. They are additionally exposed to the ever-present risks
of theft, violence, and abuse in mining camps]{.underline}. [Child labor
is rife at]{.underline} both types of ASM [mines]{.underline} (some of
which coexist with LSM concessions), all the more so because artisanal
miners often try to sneak in and steal minerals, fuel, and batteries
from the industrial sites. [Children, many orphans, are often beaten,
sexually abused, chased by dogs, or imprisoned]{.underline} while doing
so. [Some reported the deaths of their friends, and drawings of children
in waterlogged pits.]{.underline} [Despite that, children still operate
illegally]{.underline} on concessions [in broad daylight]{.underline},
and the site visits undertaken for the study found children
everywhere. [The International Labor Organization notes
that]{.underline} [the types of work they perform can be classified as
the "worst" type of child labor]{.underline} [because it
is]{.underline} [dangerous, unpleasant, unhealthy, and
unfair.]{.underline} [Children, too, reported being
exploited]{.underline} by mining interests, mining traders, or even
other family members. [All three sets of vulnerable groups---miners,
women and girls, children---develop respiratory diseases, heart
diseases, or cancer, and have extremely high levels of toxic metals in
their body. Taken together, the power relations, exploitation, and labor
issues make a compelling case that]{.underline} some forms of
ASM [cobalt mining meets the definition of modern
slavery,]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [as one respondent put it,
"**subterranean slavery**." These
heartbreaking]{.underline} [patterns]{.underline} [are]{.underline} [a
blunt disjuncture to the aesthetically pleasing, clean, high-tech
gadgets that we depend on their cobalt for.]{.underline} And for that,
the responsibility and complicity for condoning, and benefiting from,
the dispossession of these cobalt mining communities is collective.

The road to an imminent electric vehicle future has hit a speed bump ---
one [made of]{.underline} [cobalt. An **essential ingredient in
lithium-ion batteries**]{.underline} [that power millions of smartphones
as well as plug-in electric
cars,]{.underline} **[cobalt]{.underline}** **[is in heavy
demand.]{.underline}** [But]{.underline} [just as the silverish-gray
metal has established itself as a critical element in the growth of the
market in electric vehicles (EVs),]{.underline} [cobalt has also
become]{.underline} [**a source of serious ethical and economic
concerns**.]{.underline} [Most notably,]{.underline} **[the majority of
the world's cobalt production is concentrated in]{.underline}** [the
Democratic Republic of]{.underline} **[Congo, where in many
cases]{.underline}** **[children work]{.underline}** [in hazardous
conditions]{.underline} [mining the
metal.]{.underline} [And]{.underline} [once
extracted,]{.underline} [there are questions
whether]{.underline} [enough long-term]{.underline} [supplies of cobalt
can be established]{.underline} [to fulfill the hopes of policymakers in
places like California who want to transform the transportation system
from gasoline-powered vehicles to EVs.]{.underline} Supporters think the
problems associated with the mining of cobalt can sort themselves out
but even the most ardent acknowledge human rights as well as
supply-chain issues need to be resolved. For many consumers, the
connection between cobalt and clean-car technology may come as a
surprise. "There\'s absolutely an educational process really that comes
with all technology," said Blaine Townsend, senior vice president at the
Foster City-based investment firm Bailard Wealth Management who has
written about cobalt's supply chain problems. "I think it\'s really
difficult for the average consumer to understand all the science and the
rare earth minerals that go into" the production of batteries for EVs,
smartphones and computers. Why cobalt is so important for EVs The
cathodes in lithium-ion batteries typically used in EVs are made of
metal oxides that contain a combination of cobalt and other elements.
Cobalt helps the cathodes concentrate a lot of power in a confined
space. Without the element's energy density, batteries in EVs without
cobalt tend to perform worse. It's harder to recycle electric car
batteries than lead-acid batteries used in gasoline-powered vehicles
because of the number of materials involved and differences in how
manufacturers build them. [As the EV sector attempts to move from
niche-market status to mainstream acceptance, cobalt demand is
surging.]{.underline} [California policymakers have pushed
zero-emissions vehicles as essential to meet the state's mandates to
dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions.]{.underline} Gov. Jerry
Brown has set a target of 1.5 million clean-energy vehicles on
California's roads by 2025. In his final State of the State address last
month, Brown ratcheted the number even higher --- to 5 million
zero-emission vehicles by 2030. The United Kingdom and France have
announced plans to phase out gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles by
2040. All 16 states in Germany --- home of Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi
--- passed a non-binding resolution to ban the sale of new gasoline and
diesel vehicles by 2030. [While no date was set, a government official
in China last year announced the country's intention to ban the sale of
cars using fossil fuels. China represents the auto industry's largest
market in the world, even bigger than the U.S.]{.underline} [Automakers
are making their own moves.]{.underline} Tesla has begun rolling out its
Model 3, with a stripped-down base price of \$35,000, marketed as an EV
for the masses. Traditional carmakers have also made commitments,
including: Ford, which announced plans to spend \$11 billion on EVs by
2022. GM said it will add two more all-electric cars to its fleet later
this year and at least 18 more by 2023. "General Motors believes the
future is all-electric," Mark Reuss, the company's head of product
development, said last October. Volvo executives have vowed that by 2019
all its models will be either hybrids or powered solely by batteries.
Less than 1 percent of U.S. motorists own an electric vehicle but a 2017
report from the financial giant Morgan Stanley projected as many as 1
billion electric vehicles could be on the road worldwide by 2050.
Anticipating a flood in global sales of EVs, the demand for cobalt used
in electric car batteries is expected to increase by nearly eight-fold
by 2026. [The production of cobalt has quadrupled since 2000 but the
price of the metal has skyrocketed, too --- up more than 230 percent
since the end of 2015.]{.underline} Cobalt and the Congo [The vast
majority of cobalt is a byproduct from the mining of nickel and copper

two]{.underline} [extremely]{.underline} [violent civil
wars]{.underline} [in its relatively short history.]{.underline} [The
rule of law is haphazard and institutions
are]{.underline} [often]{.underline} [riven with corruption. The
country's presidential election is set for December, two years later
than scheduled.]{.underline} [Mining is a linchpin of the economy but
the work is often dangerous. Freelancers, known by the French word
creuseurs. use picks and shovels to dig up cobalt
and]{.underline} [**child labor is common**. A 2016
report]{.underline} [from Amnesty
International]{.underline} [cited]{.underline} [estimates from UNICEF
that]{.underline} [about]{.underline} **[40,000 boys and girls work in
mines across the Congo, many of them at cobalt sites.]{.underline}** [As
with adult miners,]{.underline} [the children are exposed to high levels
of cobalt and work without gloves or masks, the report
said.]{.underline} Tesla has pledged to not take cobalt from child labor
or creuseurs but it's hard to track the metal's origination once it has
reached the end of the supply chain. "It could come from 50 small
suppliers to a middleman," Townsend said. "That middleman and five other
middlemen ship what they\'ve got to a smelter in China and western
companies have to buy from that smelter. So it\'s really difficult to
trace it." With an eye on its growing assembly lines of EVs, China has
moved quickly to gobble up stocks of cobalt. According to the CRU Group,
a mineral consultancy, China controls 62 percent of the world's cobalt
supply, with 90 percent of that coming from the Congo. That's left North
American and European carmakers scrambling to sign contracts to ensure
their own supplies of the raw materials needed for battery minerals.
It's also led to searches for cobalt in other places. Canada is the
fourth-largest producer of cobalt and miners in provinces from Ontario
to the Northwest Territories are looking at potential sites to develop.
Cobalt production in the U.S. is small --- just 650 metric tons were
produced in 2017, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Congo, by
comparison, produced 64,000 metric tons. Russia finished in second place
with 5,600 metric tons. Cutting the cobalt cord? A number of chemical
companies and researchers are working on batteries for EVs that rely
less on cobalt. Two South Korean companies plan to roll out batteries
that are eight parts nickel and just one part cobalt and one part
manganese. But earlier this month, the chief executive at a
Belgium-based multinational that produces cathodes for EV batteries said
cobalt will still be needed for the foreseeable future. "There isn't a
better element than nickel to increase energy density, and there isn't a
better element than cobalt to make the stuff stable," Marc Grynberg, the
chief executive at Umicore, told Reuters. "So (while) you hear about
designing out cobalt, this is not going to happen in the next three
decades. It simply doesn't work." At the same time, Grynberg and others
think concerns about cobalt supplies can be eased by finding a more
efficient way to recycle smartphones. There are an estimated 1.6 billion
discarded phones across the globe with batteries that include cobalt.

from researchers at MIT have predicted that while there may be some
bottlenecks in the supply chain, no serious obstacles are in place for
the next 15 years to blunt rising demand. "I think what will happen is
the lithium-ion battery is probably going to be a transitional power
source," said Townsend, "and scientists are going to figure out a
different chemical composition to power the electric vehicles that has
less risk from the supply chain standpoint." Others are less
sanguine. ["**Until there\'s a replacement material that can hold a
charge and create a charge we\'ve got a problem**," said Lauren Fix, the
executive director of The Car Coach, an automotive expert based in New
York City who is critical of EVs.]{.underline} ["Tesla, GM or anyone
else is going to have to raise the price of the vehicle to try to
compensate for the increased costs" associated with rising demand and
finite supplies, Fix said. "Combustion engines are not dead and the
reason for that is we have a shortage of cobalt and this is pretty
serious."]{.underline}

HH

[The idea of [friend-shoring]{.mark} is based on constructing value
chains among allies and switching production and sourcing away from
geopolitical rivals to insulate supply chains from
disruptions]{.underline}. However, s[uch logic [has
flaws]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, [[it is not clear]{.mark} in this
plan [which market failure friend-shoring policies will]{.mark} fix. If
governments seek to intervene in a supply chain, they must make the case
that they observe the risks better than firms do.]{.underline} One of
America's leading international trade economists, Professor Gene
Grossman of Princeton University, recently observed \[9\] that: "Firms
have their own incentives to avoid disruptions, so it's not obvious that
their investments in resilience will be sub-optimal without government
policy intervention." Policies based on the assumption of the private
sector's under-investment in resilience is flawed. Grossman also
concludes \[10\] in another paper with two co-authors that governments
are very unlikely to observe the factors that optimal public policy for
supply chains depends on. So, if governments cannot accurately observe
market failures in supply chains, how can they be sure that
friend-shoring policies won't do more harm than good? [Another flaw of
[friend-shoring]{.mark} is that it [focuses on only one dimension of
supply chain risk: that offshore operations might run]{.mark} the [risk
of vulnerability to states that turn "unfriendly]{.mark}." Such an
approach [assumes that sourcing from allies is less likely to be
disrupted]{.mark} than sourcing from geopolitical rivals. However, as
the recent baby milk powder shortage in the US illustrates,
[short-sighted friend-or onshoring policies]{.mark} [may diminish one
supply risk only to amplify another.]{.mark} Relying on a few domestic
suppliers for its supply of baby formula didn't increase the resilience
in the US. Instead, a disruption in one of the facilities has caused
significant supply shortages.]{.underline} In their location choices,
companies must balance a series of risks beyond expropriation and IP
theft. Advocates of friend-shoring should consult businesses to better
understand how relocating supply chains interacts with other dimensions
of supply chain security. We must [remember that [supply chains are run
by businesses]{.underline}]{.mark}[. To date, Western governments have
mainly relied on carrots to induce factories to move. But
[subsidy-induced production]{.mark} relocation away from an efficient
location [must be commercially viable for the
company]{.mark}.]{.underline} Considering the additional costs and other
disadvantages of relocating factories, government subsidies should
sufficiently cover the costs of relocation over the lifetime of the
relocated factories. The jury is out on whether government incentives
offered to date are sufficient. Governments' multibillion-dollar
subsidies may look tempting for factory relocation. But, in essence,
most of the subsidies are provided in the form of conditional tax relief
over long periods of time, and lump sum grants are usually insufficient
to cover the relocation costs. For example, the \$52.7 billion headline
number for the US Chips Act looks impressive until one realizes that
setting up a single efficient semiconductor fab runs into millions of
dollars. The former chairman of the world's largest contract chipmaker
TMSC argued \[11\] that the US CHIPS Act is a wasteful and expensive
exercise in futility and that US-based semiconductor fabs "will be
non-competitive in the world markets." Similarly, Japan's \$2.2 billion
proposal announced \[12\] during the pandemic to repatriate production
and bring factories back home from China, or move them to other South
East Asian nations, initially received significant welcome. But it
turned out that the average subsidy amount to bring production home from
China was only \$15 million. Considering the lifetime profitability and
cost advantage of producing in China over Japan or in an allied economy,
this amount is unlikely to move the commercial needle. To compound
matters, the subsidy sufficient to sway commercial decision-making
towards friend-shoring is not easy to determine. Furthermore, pouring
billions of dollars into moving factories from geopolitical rivals back
home or to allies means diverting those dollars from helping populations
grappling with the rising cost of living. Will governments have to turn
to sticks to spur companies to relocate as soon as voter willingness to
pay for relocation fades in the light of cost-of-living worries? The
friend-shoring argument requires a similar perception of disruption
risks and close cooperation among allies to reach agreement on how to
relocate production and sourcing away from unreliable geopolitical
rivals. Any perception of an imminent security threat, such as during
the Cold War, would make it easier to unite against rivals under a
security framework. But [in today's world, [it is not clear whether
every ally]{.mark} [can be counted]{.mark} on [to be a part of US
friend-shoring]{.mark} initiatives. Even domestically, [it is not clear

[Carrots]{.mark} seem [unlikely to move]{.mark} the commercial [needle
towards friend-shoring]{.mark}. Domestic voters may force Western
governments to bring out the sticks. How well will that work in a
multilateral context? By raising trade barriers to economies deemed
"unfriendly," friend-shoring could mutate into a rationale for further
fragmenting the world trading system.]{.underline}

Examples of Indigenous Collaboration and Ownership. **[A direct result
of oil and gas extraction throughout the Arctic has seen the [increase
in co-management]{.mark} structures [between Indigenous communities and
developers.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The legacy of oil and gas extraction
in Canada has led to a historical relationship of distrust between
Indigenous communities and extractive industries. The oil and gas
industry in Canada had a significant impact on Indigenous communities
through the ever-increasing wave of Europeans arriving to be a part of
the extractive industries' growth (Alberta's Energy Heritage). The 1850s
in Canada saw a dramatic increase in the production of oil, with the
Mining and manufacturing Company of 1854 being the first dedicated oil
company in North America (Alberta's Energy Heritage). Furthermore,
projects developing access and acquisition of gas, such as Coastal
GasLink in British Columbia, have been accused of violating FPIC
principles, thus continuing the challenges navigating these forms of
extractivism and the Indigenous right to self-determination (StandEarth,
2022). Whilst mining and Indigenous relations are typically portrayed in
a negative light, **[there are [examples]{.mark}, particularly [in
the]{.mark} Canadian [Arctic]{.mark}, which can [inform future
exploration and mining]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Red Dog mine in Alaska is
a major world producer of Zn and Pb and is co-owned by Teck Alaska and
the NAANA Indigenous corporation, providing an example where [typical
approaches to [western business deals]{.mark} were [challenged]{.mark},
[resulting in]{.mark} a potential [new approach to business]{.mark} in
the Arctic]{.underline}. Raglan mine in northern Quebec is another
example of a major world producer of Ni and [the location of Canada's
first Impact Benefit Agreement [with Indigenous communities, promoting
political, social, and economic development]{.mark} of the
region]{.underline}. **[[Indigenous knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in
collaboration with two neighbouring Inuit communities, **[was
[incorporated]{.mark} into the environmental impact assessments prior to
the Raglan mine operation,]{.underline}** resulting in a [shortened
shipping season to aid conservation relating to Arctic char and seal
populations]{.underline} (Natural Resources Canada, 2007).
**[[Indigenous collaboration]{.mark} and [ownership]{.mark} is
[increasingly common]{.mark} [in Arctic]{.mark}
development]{.underline}**. For example, [First Nations, Métis, and
Inuit entities were partners or [beneficiaries in]{.mark} nearly
[20%]{.mark} of Canada's existing electricity-generating
infrastructure]{.underline} in 2022 (Gall et al., 2022), most of which
produces renewable energy, reducing reliance on diesel generators in
these remote regions. The Nechalacho rare earth project, located on the
traditional lands of several Metis and Dene First Nations groups in the
Northwest Territories, involves a [[51% joint venture]{.mark} ownership
by the Yellowknives Dene First Nations]{.underline}, who will control
mining operations at the site. This project provides **[significant
[potential for Indigenous]{.mark} and northern employment and economic
[benefit]{.mark}]{.underline}** and is the first example of a First
Nations business entity contracting for a mine operation on traditional
lands in Canada. Prior to the formation of international instruments,
such as UNDRIP, FPIC and ILO No. 169, the decisions and legislation made
in the Arctic mining sector were widely done so by corporations with
very little to no Indigenous involvement in the decision-making
processes. In 2018 the BC Regional Mining Alliance (BCRMA) was
developed, an **[industry-led strategic [partnership between Indigenous
groups, industry]{.mark} and provincial government, that focuses on
bringing investment through [collaborative
partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Golden Triangle region in
British Columbia has been a hotspot for mineral and geological
exploration for the last 150 years and investments and developments made
by BCRMA has ensured that this region is becoming increasingly
accessible (BCRMA, 2023). Additionally, in 2021, Suncor Energy announced
an unprecedented step forwards in terms of Indigenous and industry
collaborations. They announced a [[new partnership with eight
Indigenous]{.mark} [communities]{.mark}]{.underline} in Wood Buffalo,
this partnership allows the [eight Indigenous communities to acquire all
of TC Energy's 15% equity interest]{.underline} in the Northern Courier
Pipeline Limited Partnership (Foulis, 2021). This partnership is a
**[reification of reconciliation attempts and exemplifies the wanted
change from communities, within extractive sectors.]{.underline}**
Examples of Indigenous/Community Led Initiatives Since the introduction
of international instruments such as UNDRIP, FPIC and the ILO Convention
No. 169, there has been an **[[increase in Indigenous-led
initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Many of these have been [focused
specifically on the green transition.]{.underline} Securing Indigenous
Peoples' Rights in the Green Economy (SIRGE coalition) is one example of
an Indigenous-led initiative. This coalition is led by an Indigenous
Steering Committee which is made up of two representatives of Indigenous
Peoples from each of the seven socio-cultural regions across the globe.
SIRGE **[implements transformative solutions to [secure the rights of
Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} in the global transition to a green
economy]{.underline}**. This organisation has recently released a guide
for Indigenous leaders to develop FPIC protocols and to implement these
to ensure self-determination is reified for all Indigenous community
members. Another example of Indigenous communities heading initiatives
within the extractive sector is in Alberta where the Frog Lake First
Nations and the Kehewin Cree Nation are proposing **[an Indigenous-led
carbon capture and storage (CCS) hub located on their traditional
territory.]{.underline}** Whilst these communities are partnered with
Kanata Clean Power and Climate Technologies Corp. and Vault 44.01 Ltd.,
it is expected that the Indigenous majority ownership share will be
opened to other Treaty Six First Nations as the development progresses
(Jaremko, 2023).

### Yes China Threat

#### This reading of China is [correct]{.underline}\-\--they've [explicitly expressed]{.underline} through [statements]{.underline}, [documents]{.underline}, and [policy]{.underline} that deep sea mining is [crucial]{.underline} to extend [great power status]{.underline}.

China's Next Target\";

PT\]

[The **deep seabed**]{.underline}, essentially the very bottom of the
ocean's floor, [is a potentially **rich** source of oil and
gas]{.underline}; elements like [cobalt, copper, and nickel, as well
as]{.underline} of the rare earth elements (**[REEs]{.underline}**)
[required for many new **tech**nologies]{.underline}. Chinese President
[**[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping has [spok]{.mark}en [**repeatedly** of]{.mark}
the]{.underline} connection between "[**[utiliz]{.mark}ation** of the
**[ocean]{.mark}**" and China's quest [for]{.mark}]{.underline} both
maritime and overall **[national [power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2016,
[he spoke [**specifically** of]{.mark} the [deep sea]{.mark},
saying]{.underline}: "the deep sea contains treasures that remain
undiscovered and undeveloped, and in order to obtain these treasures [we
[have to]{.mark} control **key tech**nologies]{.underline} in getting
into the deep sea, discovering the deep sea, [and
**[develop]{.mark}**ing the deep sea]{.underline}."

[**[Policy]{.mark}** has [follow]{.mark}ed **[rhetoric]{.mark}**. In
February **2016**, [China]{.mark} began [lay]{.mark}ing [the predicate
for **exploitation**]{.mark} of deep **seabed resources** [with]{.mark}
the passage of the PRC **[L]{.mark}**aw on **[E]{.mark}**xploration and
**[D]{.mark}**evelopment of **[R]{.mark}**esources in **[D]{.mark}**eep
**[S]{.mark}**ea **[S]{.mark}**eabed **[A]{.mark}**reas]{.underline}. In
the 12th (2011-2015) and 13th (2016-2020) Five Year Plans, China
prioritized "promoting commercialization of deep-sea mining,
manufacturing of deep-sea equipment and utilization of deep-sea
bioresources." [Beijing already **[leads]{.mark} the [world]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the number of deep-sea [**[mining
contracts]{.mark}** undertaken, with more **likely to
follow**]{.underline} given the breadth of its surveying efforts and the
level of interest shown by senior Chinese Communist Party officials.

Beijing is following a familiar pattern in its focus on the deep seabed.
Senior officials are publicly extolling the economic importance of
dominance in a particular underutilized domain, and connecting it
explicitly to China's broader role in the world. [Xi has pursued
**similar** approaches in the **Arctic** and **Antarctic**, declaring
China a "**Polar Great Power**"]{.underline} in 2014. China's 2018
Arctic Strategy declared Beijing a "near-Arctic" power, with an
accompanying "Polar Silk Road" designed to accelerate Chinese economic
influence in the region.

In the Antarctic, meanwhile, Chinese officials have spoken regularly of
the resource exploitation potential of the continent, despite the
Antarctic Treaty's (of which China is a signatory) constraints on
extractive activities. Chinese scholars have gone so far as to propagate
the myth of the 2048 expiration of the Madrid Protocol that governs
Antarctic environmental conduct, against all evidence and contrary to
international consensus. For his part, Xi has publicly called on China
to "exploit" the Antarctic.

As in the Arctic and Antarctic, [China's [interest]{.mark}]{.underline}
in economic dominance of the deep seabed [[has a]{.mark} significant
**[military component]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2018, [a
**[M]{.mark}**inistry of **[N]{.mark}**ational **[D]{.mark}**efense
[doc]{.mark}ument [identified]{.mark} the [domains **relevant** to
the]{.mark}]{.underline} People's Liberation Army
(**[[PLA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[for future global
**op**]{.mark}**eration[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition to
traditional domains like land, air, sea, and space, [the document
[call]{.mark}ed [for]{.mark} "[confrontation]{.mark} activities"
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} areas including quantum, artificial
intelligence, and, revealingly, [[the **deep sea**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Science of Strategy, a premier Chinese military journal connected to its
National Defense University, noted the economic value of the deep seabed
as early as 2015 and spoke of "military struggle in the deep sea" as a
future warfare domain. Revisions to the country's National Security Law
that year also flagged the deep seabed as an area of national interest
for Beijing.

[Chinese **[dominance]{.mark}** of the **deep seabed**]{.underline},
whether in already-disputed waters like the South and East China Seas or
farther afield in the Western Pacific, where China has conducted
extensive surveying, including near U.S. territories like Guam and the
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, [[poses]{.mark}
significant [**military challenges** for]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}.[S]{.mark}. [and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}.
