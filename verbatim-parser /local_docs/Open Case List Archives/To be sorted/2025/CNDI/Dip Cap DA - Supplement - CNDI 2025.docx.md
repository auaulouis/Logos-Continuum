#### **Trump's finalizing India and Pakistan trade deals now---that [stabilizes]{.underline} tensions.**

Group of Newspapers. "Pakistani Delegation Arrives in US to Finalise
Trade Deal." DAWN. https://www.dawn.com/news/1921336; mgm\]

WASHINGTON: A [**[Pakistani delegation]{.mark}** arrived [in
Washington]{.mark} on Monday [to **finalise** a trade
**agreement**]{.mark}]{.underline} as the country looks to
[[**recalibrate** **economic** ties with the US and **ease
tensions**]{.underline}]{.mark} stemming from high import tariffs
imposed by President Donald Trump.

The delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, is scheduled to
hold talks with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and senior
officials from other departments.

[Talks between **Pakistan** and **the United** **States**]{.underline},
which have been [ongoing for over a month]{.underline}, are expected to
conclude this week, the Finance Ministry stated on Wednesday following a
meeting between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Commerce
Secretary Howard Lutnick.

The ongoing discussions, centred on reciprocal tariffs are part of a
broader effort to "[reset economic ties at a time of shifting
geopolitical alignments]{.underline}," according to Pakistani officials.

The finance ministry also noted that "a longer-term strategic and
investment partnership is also under discussion."

Pakistan currently faces a 29 per cent tariff on its exports to the US.
In 2024, Pakistan's trade surplus with the United States was around \$3
billion.

To ease tariff pressures and address the trade imbalance, Islamabad has
offered to increase imports of American goods, including crude oil and
expand investment opportunities for US firms, particularly in its mining
sector.

"Both sides showed satisfaction on the ongoing negotiations and resolved
to conclude the trade negotiations next week," the ministry said.

Last week, the two governments co-hosted a webinar to promote investment
in Pakistan's mineral sector, highlighting the \$7 billion Reko Diq
copper-gold project in Balochistan.

Senior officials and US investors discussed public-private partnerships
and regulatory reforms aimed at attracting foreign capital.

The US Export-Import Bank is currently reviewing financing proposals
worth between \$500 million and \$1bn for the Reko Diq project.

In an interview with Fox Business, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent
said the administration is negotiating trade deals with 18 "important
trading partners" and expects several of them to be finalised in the
coming weeks.

"If we can ink 10 or 12 of the important 18 ... then I think we could
have trade wrapped up by Labour Day," Mr Bessent said, indicating a more
flexible timeline than the previously set July 9 deadline.

President [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has already claimed he [used
[**trade** as a leverage to stop **hostilities** between **Pakistan**
and **India**]{.mark} in May]{.underline}.

US officials have said [[**finalising** **trade** **agreements**
with]{.mark} both [**India** and Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline} could
[[**provide** a **much**-**needed** **stabilising** influence]{.mark}
and offer a path [toward **broader economic
cooperation**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

### UQ\-\--Trade Talks

#### **U.S. India trade talks [alleviate]{.underline} Indian tensions now.**

mgm\]

This week, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar arrived in
Washington to attend a Quadrilateral Security Dialogue foreign
ministers' meeting. However, the biggest story in [[U.S.-India]{.mark}
relations]{.underline} right now is arguably **[[ongoing trade
negotiations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The two sides are trying to
finalize the first phase of a deal before July 9, when U.S. President
Donald Trump's 90-day pause on his sweeping global tariffs is scheduled
to end.

The [trade talks [are high stakes]{.mark} for India]{.underline}, which
faces the prospect of a 26 percent U.S. tariff at a moment when its
economy---while robust and rapidly growing---has performed unevenly. Yet
the talks' significance extends beyond economic considerations: They are
also critical for New Delhi's overall relations with Washington, which
have hit unexpected bumps in recent weeks. The outcome of the talks
could serve as a bellwether of the partnership's broader trajectory.

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration has
[[made]{.underline}]{.mark} several recent [[moves that have **unnerved
New Delhi**]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, it [didn't throw its full
support behind **India** [during]{.mark} the [**conflict** with
**Pakistan**]{.mark}]{.underline} in May, instead [[call]{.mark}ing [for
both sides to **de-escalate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Subsequently,
[Trump]{.underline} boasted multiple times of the [**[critical]{.mark}**
U.S. role [in **mediating a
cease**]{.mark}]{.underline}**[-[fire]{.underline}]{.mark}**---which
India denies---even though New Delhi is sensitive to third-party
interventions in its crises.

[Trump]{.underline} also [publicly [**offered** to help
**mediate**]{.mark} India and Pakistan's **long-term dispute over
[Kashmir]{.mark},**]{.underline} which the former has made clear is not
up for negotiation.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed concerns about these
matters in a call with Trump last month. An Indian readout, which said
the conversation lasted 35 minutes, suggests Modi spoke in strong terms
to Trump while the president "listened carefully." That call came one
day after another U.S. move that likely upset New Delhi: The State
Department issued a new travel advisory for India, warning visiting
Americans to exercise "increased caution" due to "crime and terrorism."

India's concerns have been compounded by signals that the United States
is looking to court Pakistan. These include [Trump's **messaging** on
the **cease**-fire and **Kashmir**]{.underline}, which was received well
in Islamabad; his administration's [[calls for engagement with
Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} on issues including cryptocurrency,
critical minerals, and counterterrorism; and most significantly,
[Trump's decision to host a **White House lunch** for **Pakistan's**
army **chief** last month.]{.underline}

This all comes after U.S.-India relations got off to a seemingly great
start in Trump's second term. Modi was one of the first foreign leaders
to visit the White House after the inauguration. In February, the pair
released a joint statement pledging [**multifaceted** **cooperation** on
issues including defense and energy security]{.underline}, building on a
partnership that has expanded exponentially in recent decades. To
further cement ties, India has made politically risky concessions, from
pledging tariff reductions to bringing back dozens of Indians living in
the United States illegally.

A [[**trade** **deal** **before**]{.mark} the end of the tariff pause
[would]{.mark} deliver a **big** **[boost]{.mark}** to the **[U.S.-India
partnership]{.mark}** at this critical moment]{.underline}. It could [be
[a **confidence-building measure**]{.mark} that [helps the
**relationship course-correct**]{.mark}]{.underline} and brings new
momentum to its many tracks, from cooperation in countering China to
collaboration on defense, energy, technology, and higher education.

However, a [**[failure]{.underline}** [to clinch a deal]{.underline}
]{.mark}[by July 9 would [add to]{.mark} the **current [bilateral
malaise]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [[amplify]{.mark} [doubts]{.mark}
harbored by some in India---]{.underline}admittedly not for the first
time in recent years---that [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
**[can]{.mark}** truly [be]{.mark} as
**[dependable]{.mark}**]{.underline} as long-standing Indian friends
such as France and Russia.

TEL AVIV --- [As the dust settles on Iran after unprecedented Israeli
and American attacks, the [**U.S. and Israel have shifted their focus
toward** a]{.mark}]{.underline}n ambitious [**[diplomatic
push]{.mark}**]{.underline} they hope will translate into the kind of
enduring political stability that has evaded the region for decades.
Despite apparent Iranian unwillingness, [President Donald [**Trump** is
**pushing for**]{.mark} more [talks with **Tehran**]{.mark} about its
nuclear program.]{.underline} But [[**Israel** appears]{.mark} more
[interested in formalizing **diplomatic relations**]{.mark}
**[with]{.mark} some of its long-standing [adversaries]{.mark}**, **as
well as ending the 18-month conflict in Gaza** --- which Trump has
repeatedly pleaded for.]{.underline} "This victory presents an
opportunity for a dramatic widening of peace agreements," Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday. "We are
working on this with enthusiasm." The previous Trump administration
brokered what it called the Abraham Accords, in which Israel established
diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} later normalized its relations with Morocco
in 2024 and Sudan, though that deal has yet to be ratified. Having
devastated the powerful, Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group in
Lebanon, its northern neighbor, and seen a Tehran-friendly regime
toppled in Syria to the east, [**Israel [is]{.mark} now [interested
in]{.mark}** [establishing]{.mark} **formal [diplomatic relations with
both countries,]{.mark} Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Monday**. The
shift represents a broader change in Israeli policy toward its
neighbors.]{.underline} Until around two weeks ago, Israel's modus
operandi was to assert military dominance as a political strategy,
according to Michael Oren, who served as the country's ambassador to the
U.S. from 2009 to 2013.

### UQ\-\--Gaza

#### **Ceasefire's holding now. Continued [Gaza]{.underline} negotiations [bolster]{.underline} it.**

**Faisal '7/3** \[Muhammad; July 3, 2025. South Asia security researcher
at the University of Technology Sydney, former Fellow at the Institute
of Strategic Studies Islamabad. "**[The [Israel-Iran Ceasefire]{.mark}
Appears to Be [Holding]{.mark}.]{.underline}** What's next for the
Middle East?" DAWN. https://www.dawn.com/news/1921439; mgm\]

Washington's primary strategic focus remains the Indo-Pacific, and a
prolonged conflict in the Middle East would only serve as an unwelcome
distraction. For now, the United States' main interest lies in
maintaining a weakened, non-nuclear Iran, which would allow its Gulf
partners to deepen their ties with Israel. Both [Washington]{.underline}
broadly, [and]{.underline} the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration specifically, have [backed a Middle East shaped by the
Abraham Accords]{.underline} --- [[promoting **normalisation**
**between** **Israel**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} key [Arab
**states**]{.mark}]{.underline}, while largely sidestepping the divisive
issue of Palestine.

This vision of peace is intended to enable Washington's Gulf security
partners, working in coordination with Israel, to take greater
responsibility for regional security. In turn, this would allow the
United States to reallocate military resources to the Asia-Pacific,
where it is increasingly focused on countering China. However,
Washington believes that a nuclear-capable Iran would inevitably
undermine this regional order.

Conversely, for Russia and China --- whose absence from the current war
was striking --- the situation posed a strategic paradox. On the one
hand, a distracted United States mired in Middle Eastern conflicts
benefits both Beijing and Moscow; on the other, it comes at the cost of
weakening their key regional partner, Iran.

For different reasons, both powers chose to remain on the sidelines ---
Russia is bogged down by the war in Ukraine, while China, focused on
maintaining economic stability amid an intensifying trade war with the
US, has little appetite for external entanglements. As a result, neither
provided Tehran with concrete military support nor acted to dissuade
Washington from targeting Iran's nuclear facilities.

Yet, both great powers cannot allow Israel to dominate the Middle East
in ways that would entrench a US-led regional order at the expense of
their own influence. Post ceasefire, China and Russia are likely to
prioritise stabilising Iran and gradually rebuilding its economy and
military capabilities, so it can better defend itself in the future. The
more pressing question is: will Beijing and Moscow support Tehran's
nuclear quest, if the latter decides to sprint towards a nuclear
breakout?

**[Immediately]{.underline}**, however, [a **[prospective
ceasefire]{.mark}** [in Gaza]{.mark} between Hamas and
Israel]{.underline}, again **[[brokered by the]{.mark}
[US]{.mark},]{.underline}** [**will** [**calm** **regional tensions**
**across** the **Middle East**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If it
**materialises**, it [indicates that the **Iran-Israel ceasefire
will**]{.mark}]{.underline} also [**[hold]{.mark}**, [providing]{.mark}
considerable [**room** for **direct US-Iran** **talks**]{.mark} on
nuclear and regional issues]{.underline}. Similarly, the Gaza ceasefire
[will [provide a **window**]{.mark} [for a **regional initiative**
to]{.mark} **[shape]{.mark}** the future of
**[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} and security in Gaza, with active
support from Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Any tangible progress on Gaza will
build momentum towards Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries joining the
Abraham Accords, and in the process, effectively reshape the regional
order.

'The [[ceasefire will]{.underline}]{.mark} only [[hold if Trump]{.mark}
is **willing** to [pressure **Netanyahu**]{.mark}]{.underline},' says
Rob Geist Pinfold, research fellow at the Peace Research Center Prague

ISTANBUL

As [[a]{.underline} [**tenuous truce** holds between Israel and
Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}, concerns abound over a potential return to
the intense conflict seen in recent weeks, while experts warn of other
potential dangers and stress the need for continued restraint and
engagement.

Geopolitical risk analyst Andreas Krieg is among many who view the
current [**[ceasefire]{.mark}** as "**[fragile]{.mark}**,"
**[dependent]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[on]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[delicate]{.mark} balance of]{.underline} deterrence,
**[[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and domestic politics.

"The ceasefire might hold, but only as long as Tehran considers
restraint more strategic than retaliation, Israel remains wary of
triggering direct US re‑engagement, and Gulf states maintain their
discreet but critical role as the bridge between pressure and peace,"
Krieg told Anadolu.

However, he warned that [[if **any link** in this **fragile chain
breaks,** **conflict** will **likely** **resume**]{.underline}]{.mark},
but as more of a shadow war with targeted attacks, cyber‑espionage, and
proxy warfare.

"Israel ... has shown a longstanding track record of engaging Iran
indirectly: assassinations of nuclear scientists, cyber‑attacks and the
occasional missile strike in Syria," explained Krieg, a senior lecturer
at the School of Security Studies at King's College London.

He added that Israel's military doctrine emphasizes deniable, precision
strikes designed to impose costs without provoking full-scale war,
particularly if US political support remains limited.

[A [**return to overt warfare** is possible if the **ceasefire
collapses**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Krieg noted, but both sides recognize
the potential for disastrous consequences.

Thus, escalations are likely to involve covert operations, proxy
skirmishes involving Hezbollah or Iraqi militias, cyberattacks, and
sabotage campaigns.

"Israel will almost certainly continue targeting Iranian interests where
it sees impunity and strategic gain, just as it has in Syria and
Lebanon, leveraging Israeli airpower and spy networks," he added.

The Trump and Netanyahu factor

Experts point out that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
[[Netanyahu]{.underline}]{.mark} would [[**want** to remain
on]{.mark}]{.underline} US President Donald [[**Trump's** **good**
**side** by **not** **violating the ceasefire**]{.mark},]{.underline}
but his political survival might push him toward resuming conflict.

"[[The ceasefire will]{.mark}]{.underline} only [[hold if Trump is
**willing to pressure Netanyahu**]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"** Rob Geist
Pinfold, a research fellow at the Peace Research Center Prague, told
Anadolu.

The [[**Middle** **East**]{.mark} **currently** stands [on the brink of
**cataclysm**]{.mark}]{.underline} due to the extraordinarily tense
stand-off between Israel and Iran, largely centering around Iran's
nuclear status. With the situation still very much in flux, a key
question persists: [[Will]{.mark} the **ongoing [hostilities]{.mark}**
[**escalate** into a **broader conflict**, or will **diplomatic
negotiations** lead to **a stable peace?**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The immediate causes of tension centre on Israel's heavy missile strikes
on Tehran targeting Islamic Revolution Guard Corps commanders and
Iranian scientists and Iran's retaliatory missile attacks on Israel. The
underlying, systemic issue is that Iran's continued nuclear development
remains a significant concern for Israel. The United States,
historically opposed to Iran's nuclear program, has directly intervened
militarily in response to Iran's retaliatory missile strikes on Israel
and missed negotiation deadlines. After U.S. intervention, Netanyahu
declared a "historic victory" by saying "We have thwarted Iran's nuclear
project. And if anyone in Iran tries to rebuild it, we will act with the
same determination, with the same intensity, to foil any attempt."
However, Iran does not appear likely to abandon its nuclear ambitions,
raising concerns that this stance could further escalate the conflict in
the future. The damage from these strikes were relatively limited, and
[[Iran]{.mark} [could]{.mark} **feasibly [resume]{.mark}** and
**advance** its **[nuclear program]{.mark} within months.**]{.underline}

Recent developments include a **[[ceasefire]{.mark}
announced]{.underline}** on June 23rd [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
President Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Both Israel and Iran
took hours to acknowledge that they had accepted the ceasefire and even
proceeded to launch missile strikes shortly after Trump made it.
Eventually, [both [countries agreed]{.mark} that [they would not
breach]{.mark} the ceasefire **unless provoked by the
other**.]{.underline} The stability of this truce is tenuous and depends
significantly on whether a party breaks faith. If Iran breaks it first,
this could be driven by its intentions to assert its national
sovereignty in the face of acts by two states that have violated its
territorial integrity. Conversely, Israel, based on past behaviour,
might breach the agreement due to unresolved fears concerning Iran's
nuclear capabilities or the desire to effect regime change.

Critical intelligence gaps persist, including the duration of the
ceasefire, the specifics of ongoing negotiations, and the status of
Iran's nuclear capabilities. It remains uncertain if Iran is close to
possessing nuclear weapons; this unknown factor significantly increases
the risks associated with any potential military confrontation or
pressure on Iran.

Narratives from various actors further complicate the situation. In a
rare move, President Trump publicly criticized Israel's aggressive
military actions on June 24, explicitly warning against further
escalation. This marks a significant departure, as Israel historically
received considerable support from successive U.S. administrations,
exemplified by Netanyahu's influence on the Bush administration's
decision to remove Saddam Hussein, a decision justified in part by
promises of positive regional political reverberations, but which caused
a bloody and protracted war instead.

The Prospects of a Diplomatic Solution

In theory, Iran, as signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
is entitled to possess a limited, civilian-based nuclear capability.
This is explicitly guaranteed by Article IV. [If]{.underline}
[[Iran]{.mark} made a [drive]{.mark} [to **possess nuc**]{.mark}**lear
weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [it [would]{.mark}]{.underline} be in
violation of the treaty and would [[constitute a **grave
threat**]{.mark} to the international community]{.underline}. However,
[**[regulated nuclear capabilities]{.mark}** [overseen by]{.mark} the
[international community]{.mark}]{.underline} embodied in the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) [could **[reduce]{.mark}** the
[**likelihood** of]{.mark} the missile [exchanges]{.mark} and violence
currently]{.underline} visiting suffering on both Israeli and Iranian
populations. Resolving this deadlock and [[achieving a **compromise
agreement**]{.mark} is [**critical** to **preventing**]{.mark} **further
[escalation]{.mark}**,]{.underline} particularly given Iran's unwavering
determination to exploit the potential of nuclear power. Ultimately, war
represents the extension of unresolved political disagreements into
violent conflict. Although pursuing regulated nuclear capabilities for
Iran poses significant risks, the extensive human casualties witnessed
over the past few days [underscore the [necessity of]{.mark}
exploring]{.underline} alternative, [**[diplomatic solutions]{.mark}**
to prevent **further suffering.**]{.underline}

American IR expert opinions, as summarized by Foreign Policy, indicate
significant concern regarding military escalation. Out of 753 experts
surveyed between June 18-22, 66% of IR scholars believe that Israeli
attacks on Iran have made the United States less secure, and 83.36%
agree that the United States should not use military force against Iran
if Iran does not comply with Trump's ultimatum. Analysts believe there's
a considerable probability (54%) of U.S. military involvement in Iran
within the next year, while the likelihood of Israel using nuclear
weapons is considered relatively low, yet still hovering at an
unsettling 11%. [Experts **predominantly** view **diplomatic solution**s
as preferable to **military** **interventions**.]{.underline}

Comparing the current situation to the Cuban Missile Crisis highlights
both similarities and keydifferences. Both [[crises **risked** **global
war** due to **nuclear threats**]{.mark};]{.underline} however, the
Cuban Missile Crisis benefitted from Kennedy and Khruschev's diplomatic
compromise, which was a stark contrast to the present scenario where
diplomacy remains tenuous because of a deadlock.

Multiple scenarios can evolve from this conflict; the [**[most]{.mark}
[favorable]{.mark}** [scenario would]{.mark} [involve]{.mark}
a]{.underline} permanent [[**ceasefire** paired with **mutual
agreement**]{.mark} on **Iran's nuclear program**]{.underline}.
Conversely, [the [**worst**-**case scenario**]{.mark} predicts a
[**resumption** of]{.mark} missile [exchanges escalating into
**full-scale warfare**]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [**[drawing in
the U]{.mark}nited** **[S]{.mark}tates** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} even
a tactical **[[nuclear]{.mark} [strike]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even
**[[renewed strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}** on Iran's nuclear
infrastructure that do not lead to wider conventional or [**nuclear
conflict** **[risk radioactive fallout]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**

[[A]{.mark}]{.underline} temporary **[[ceasefire appears most
probabl]{.mark}e]{.underline}**, [[with]{.mark} future
[escalations]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
**[[contingent]{.underline}]{.mark}** upon perceived nuclear threats or
regional conflicts involving Gaza. Bias significantly influences
decision-making in this conflict, particularly concerning labels like
aggressor versus defender. [[Achieving]{.mark} lasting [peace]{.mark}
will [require **mutual concessions**]{.mark} [from]{.mark} **all
involved parties**---[**Washington**, **Tehran**, and
**Jerusalem**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Absent these, the region will likely
endure continued conflict.
