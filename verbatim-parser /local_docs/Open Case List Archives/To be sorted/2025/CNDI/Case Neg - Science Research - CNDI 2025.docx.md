One of the most [noteworthy concerns is [thawing
permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}. This frozen ground acts as a cap,
trapping gases and organic materials. [As global temperatures rise, this
[ground is beginning to thaw]{.mark}, leading to [structural challenges
like erosion, landslides, and infrastructure]{.mark} damage, as well as
the potential [reanimation of ancient pathogens]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Our [teams have been working on the ground in Alaska, taking core
samples from permafrost and using advanced genomic sequencing to see
what's hiding in the ice]{.underline}. The questions we're asking: [[Are
these pathogens harmful to humans]{.mark}? How might people be exposed?
And what does this mean for military personnel and local
communities]{.underline}?

But pathogens aren't the only concern. The Arctic has also served as a
kind of deep freeze for chemicals like heavy metals and
PFAS---substances that can harm human health. [As the ice melts, these
chemicals can be released into the environment, potentially
contaminating water sources and entering the food chain. Our [research
has shown that these risks are not just theoretical; they're real and
require a proactive approach to monitoring and
mitigation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Beyond Biology: The Challenge of Winterizing Gear and Infrastructure

The [day-to-day demands of operating in Arctic conditions provide just
as many challenges as the high-profile biological threats]{.underline}.
Imagine trying to keep medical supplies like IV bags and blood products
from freezing solid or ensuring that critical equipment doesn't seize up
in subzero temperatures. Even something as simple as a gas mask can
become compromised if its valves freeze open.

[Battelle is taking a [holistic approach to this research]{.mark}. We
don't look at problems in isolation, but [cast a wide net, reviewing
research projects]{.mark}, talking to stakeholders, and [developing
methods that can be applied at scale]{.mark}. Alaska has served as our
test bed, but the methods we're developing are [adaptable and ready to
be implemented in other regions]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[We are at the forefront of [developing novel solutions to decipher
emerging threats before they become critical

The Arctic is changing fast, and the risks are evolving just as quickly.
[[Battelle is committed to ensuring the Arctic remains a place of
discovery, innovation, and safety]{.mark}. Whether [detecting hidden

**Arctic carbon research and monitoring already exists in the status quo
-- makes the aff non-unique**

**Permafrost Pathways 23** ([Permafrost Pathwaynbns was launched in 2022
with funding through the TED Audacious Project---a collaborative funding
initiative catalyzing big, bold solutions to the world's most urgent
challenges. Through a joint effort between Woodwell Climate Research
Center, the Arctic Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School, and the Alaska
Institute for Justice, Permafrost Pathways brings together leading
experts in climate science, policy action, and environmental justice to
inform and develop adaptation and mitigation strategies to address
permafrost thaw), " Brayden]{.mark}

A major goal of **[[Permafrost Pathways]{.underline}]{.mark}** is to
**[[ensure that permafrost carbon emissions are accounted for in global
climate policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But first, we need to be able to
assess the current carbon balance of the Arctic.

Here's what we need to know: Is the Arctic a net carbon sink, as it has
been for tens of thousands of years, meaning that plants are absorbing
more carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere than is being released
from soils as both CO2 and methane (CH4)? Or has the scale tipped---is
the Arctic now a carbon source, meaning that soils and permafrost are
releasing more CO2 and CH4 than plants can sequester?

To track CO2 and CH4, **[[we use the eddy covariance method, which
directly measures greenhouse gasses]{.underline}]{.mark}** as they move
between soils, plants, and the atmosphere. Currently, **[[there
are]{.underline}]{.mark}** about **[[64 active eddy covariance towers
across]{.underline}]{.mark}** 5.5 million square miles of **[[the entire
Arctic region that measure]{.underline}]{.mark}** both **[[CO2 and
CH4]{.underline}]{.mark}** fluxes. Only 39 of those **[[towers run
throughout the year]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These criteria are critical
because soil microbes can produce CO2 and CH4 year-round---even during
the long, frozen winters---and because CO2 and CH4 are two of the most
potent greenhouse gasses. Running this instrumentation throughout the
winter is particularly challenging in the Arctic, as many locations are
off the power grid and there is no solar power during the dark winters
of the high north.

**[[Over the next several years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we will be
**[[installing 10 new]{.underline}]{.mark}**, strategically placed eddy
covariance **[[towers and supporting existing towers by providing
equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}** for year-round measurements of both CO2
and CH4. While 10 may not seem like a big number, the keywords here are
strategically placed. Using satellite data, maps of important
environmental and ecological variables, and statistical analyses of how
representative the current eddy covariance
**[[network]{.underline}]{.mark}** is, we have identified priority
locations for new installations. The Siberian Arctic and the Canadian
High Arctic are particularly underrepresented, so our team
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** partnering with **[[local and Indigenous
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the ground **[[to coproduce
knowledge about environmental changes]{.underline}]{.mark}** they are
experiencing **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** support community-led
**[[monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

In 2022, we installed a new eddy covariance tower in Churchill, Canada
and supported six existing towers across Canada and Alaska. We are now
**[[working with]{.underline}]{.mark}** local **[[Arctic researchers and
[Arctic Indigenous
communities](https://permafrost.woodwellclimate.org/indigenous-led-climate-research-station-rebuilds-after-october-wildfire/)
to develop a plan]{.underline}]{.mark}** to establish additional towers
in Canada and Siberia. Our recent fieldwork included a trip to southwest
Alaska earlier this year to troubleshoot equipment issues at a remote
site accessed by ski plane. In March 2023, our team traveled to
Northwest Territories, Canada to fix equipment at the Scotty Creek tower
site that burned down during an unprecedented late-season wildfire in
October 2022. Last month, our team visited Nunavut, Canada to meet
community members and discuss Indigenous-led environmental monitoring
and the potential for future tower installations.

By **[[combining]{.underline}]{.mark}** these **[[new data with improved
models]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[we]{.underline}]{.mark}** will soon
**[[have a]{.underline}]{.mark}** better **[[understanding of
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** current and projected carbon balance of the
Arctic, and what that means for our shared **[[climate
future.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### No !\-\--Disease

A pandemic -- a widespread outbreak of a novel disease -- is an event
that understandably stokes fear. It carries emotional weight,
implicative of "universal, lethal contagion," and finds power in the
viscerality of a mass confrontation with death. The fearsome status of
"pandemic" also comes from the world's recent experience of one; the
memory of COVID-19 lingers in the global consciousness[**. [In the
Arctic]{.mark}**, the concept of "**pandemic" has an additional layer of
complexity**. **In the past fifteen years, [scientists have raised
concerns about pathogens with pandemic potential surviving in the
permafrost.]{.mark}** These are bacteria and viruses, some of which date
back to prehistoric times, that have managed to stay alive in dormant
states in glacial environments. **These are samples of "giant [viruses"
that could infect humans have been identified and several studies have
confirmed the possibility of their "revival"]{.mark} -- that is, a
re-activation of infectiousness after their long, frozen dormancy.
Summertime thawing of the permafrost has already been connected to a
2016 resurgence of the bacterion anthrax in Siberia**.]{.underline} The
possibility of dangerous or unfamiliar viruses emerging from the melting
ice, just as Arctic tourism rapidly increases, is a serious and
worthwhile topic of consideration. [Between the motif of "re-awakening"
and its macroscopic potential, the term 'zombie' has become associated
with Arctic pandemic threats]{.underline}. This moniker is present in
literary discourse around narratives of outbreak, academic research on
biothreats and ecology, and most commonly in popular science news
articles. It is an intuitive nickname for an admittedly fascinating
scientific process, but it is worth asking: what are the downsides of
"zombifying" Arctic viruses? [**[The "zombification" of Arctic viruses
runs the risk of perpetuating misunderstandings about the threat of
disease]{.mark} and [its capacity to spread.]{.mark}** The term succeeds
in engaging an audience, but can be misleading in regard to **[the
breadth of the issue, the uneven dynamic of health emergencies, and the
degree of agency humans have in preventing
outbreaks.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The unexpected rise of an unknown
disease In the 2013 film World War Z, Brad Pitt's character is stuck in
traffic -- a gridlock that seems normal until its cause is revealed to
be the outbreak of a zombie apocalypse. Within the first ten minutes of
the film, the zombies' rise turns the world upside down[**. Our
inability to predict their resurrection is one of the aspects that makes
these viruses so fearsome.** In the words of infectious disease
researcher Jeremy Farrar, "if you don't see \[it\], you will always
respond too late**." [But we are already learning how to expect these
kinds of viruses. The International Circumpolar Surveillance
(ICS]{.mark}**[)]{.mark} program operates in eight countries, creating a
network of hospitals, laboratories, and public health officials that
monitor health status and report cases of concern. The program, which
started in 1999, is a "successful example of collaborative
surveillance," supplemented by **[national disease tracking
units]{.mark} run by individual member states**. The United States, for
example, operates **[the Arctic Investigations Program]{.mark}** that
coordinates with **[tribal communities]{.mark} to
"[evaluate...infectious threats]{.mark} that may be climate sensitive."
These efforts are [also supported by the International Health
Regulations]{.mark}, a recently-amended treaty that outlines
surveillance, notification, and verification steps its 196 member states
are bound to follow. [Viruses can only evade detection for so long, and
we have a plethora of programs to detect their
emergence.]{.mark}**]{.underline} In all likelihood, we will avoid
"World War Z." The unstoppable spread of a zombie virus In the 2002 film
"28 Days Later," it takes less than a month for the virus responsible
for "zombifying" the public to traverse the world[. But would a "zombie
virus" of the Arctic variety necessarily wreck this havoc? Simply put,
no[. **Viruses have variable infectiousness,**]{.mark} **and there are
myriad [barriers]{.mark} that can [stop them from]{.mark} successfully
[spreading]{.mark}. The most obvious is geographical -- [a virus needs a
host to climb a mountain or cross an ocean,]{.mark} and without one, its
capacity for spread is limited. [But a pathogen may be unsuccessful in
spreading a disease even when it is able to come into contact with a
host.]{.mark}** Disease susceptibility is an elusive concept, **a
complex calculation [balancing genetics, environment, target demographic
of the disease, medical history, living and working conditions, and
more. Most importantly, not all viruses are able to infect
humans]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} In April of last year, researchers isolated
strains of **[defrosted "Methuselah microbes]{.mark}**" which are
**indeed [virulent]{.mark}** -- but **[only to amoebae]{.mark}**. **The
bottom line is that [being exposed to a disease does not automatically
lead to infection]{.mark}.** Diseases are extinguishable in ways that
the Hollywood zombie is not. The inevitable doom of another pandemic
Between its sudden emergence and frenetic spread, the zombie -- much
like the frozen virus -- conjures a sense of doom. Yet **[we have reason
to be]{.mark} [hopeful about]{.mark} our ability to [defeat a "zombie
virus."]{.mark}**]{.underline} The last century has seen remarkable
growth in human resilience against outbreaks. Vaccination, for example,
has been nothing short of a public health miracle. The World Health
Organization's Expanded Program on Immunization has "saved 154 million
lives over the past 50 years." Between 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19
vaccine is estimated to have prevented at least 19.8 million deaths
globally. That level of success is particularly remarkable given that it
took less than a year from the first sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 genome
to the first emergency authorization of its vaccine. [**The world's
[current capability to address]{.mark} outbreaks of infectious [disease
is]{.mark} historically [unprecedented,]{.mark} and we should not
mistake a virus' ability to spread and cause illness as tantamount to a
pandemic.** As frightening as zombies may be, their viral counterparts
need not cause the same type of fear. An outbreak by any other name The
threat of thawing permafrost]{.underline} introducing infectious
microbes into the environment is a real concern. In 2016, tens of people
were infected and almost 3,000 reindeer died in an outbreak of anthrax
that may have resurfaced due to summertime thawing. Corpses of victims
of past pandemics -- including smallpox in Siberia in the late
nineteenth century -- have been found to host strains of those same
deadly viruses. [Yet **the significance of the threat means [it
is]{.mark} all the more [important that we evaluate it appropriately.
Failing]{.mark} to do so casts regional governance as incapable of
handling such threats, and more worryingly [presumes]{.mark} that people
in the [Arctic are inevitable victims of a future, not-yet-resurrected
disease.]{.mark}** These viruses do not have human agency, but should
nonetheless be taken seriously. The term **"[zombie virus" is useful in
introducing the topic to new audiences, but it runs the risk of
perpetuating a fatalistic vision of disease outbreaks in the Far
North.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

perspectives on the risk of pathogenic viruses from thawing permafrost",
8 January 2025, https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00042-24

Climate change is inducing wide-scale permafrost thaw in **[[the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and subarctic, triggering concerns that
long-dormant pathogens could reemerge from the thawing ground and
initiate epidemics or pandemics. Viruses, as opposed to bacterial
pathogens, garner particular interest because outbreaks cannot be
controlled with antibiotics, though the effects can be mitigated by
vaccines and newer antiviral drugs. To evaluate the potential hazards
posed by viral pathogens emerging from thawing permafrost, we review
information from a diverse range of disciplines. This includes efforts
to recover infectious virus from human remains, studies on disease
occurrence in polar animal populations, investigations into viral
persistence and infectivity in permafrost, and assessments of human
exposure to the enormous viral diversity present in the environment.
Based on currently available knowledge, we conclude that the
[[**risk**]{.mark} posed by **viruses** [from **thawing permafrost is**
no greater **than viruses in other environments**]{.mark}
such]{.underline} as temperate soils and aquatic systems. Permafrost
underlies a quarter of Earth's terrestrial surface (1) and, despite
millennia of subzero temperatures, hosts diverse microbial communities
(2). Some microorganisms survive by altering their physiology and
maintaining low rates of metabolic activity. Others adopt dormant forms
such as endospores or cysts (3--7). Viruses that infect bacteria,
archaea, and microeukaryotes (e.g., fungi and amoebae) are also abundant
members of these microbial communities, both in thawing and intact
permafrost (8, 9). They can survive by infecting active cells, through
passive existence as prophages, or as "stowaways" when an infected cell
enters dormancy. In some cases, cold-adapted viruses may persist frozen
outside of their hosts (10--13). Permafrost also contains the remains of
dead microbes, plants, animals, and occasionally humans, which are
preserved by frozen conditions (3, 14, 15). Climate change may thaw up
to 40% of Arctic and subarctic permafrost by the end of the century
(16), exposing the preserved remains of infectious disease victims (both
human and animal). If viral pathogens maintain infectivity while frozen
in permafrost, or if permafrost viruses with microbial hosts can jump to
humans or animals, thaw could potentially initiate disease outbreaks
(17). However, there are many reasons why this possibility should not
result in a heightened sense of alarm. The possibility of pathogenic
microorganisms emerging from thawing permafrost and causing disease is
not completely without precedent. In 2016 an anthrax outbreak, caused by
the bacterium Bacillus anthracis, resulted in the death of one person,
sickened dozens more, and killed thousands of domesticated reindeer on
the Yamal Peninsula in Russia (18). Prior to the introduction of a
vaccine around 1930, anthrax was common on the Yamal Peninsula and
periodically decimated reindeer populations (19). Reindeer herds likely
acquired anthrax through the uptake of environmentally resistant
endospores, which can remain dormant in the soil for decades. This is
akin to transmission pathways in grazing animals from temperate regions
(20). From \~1930 to 2016, anthrax was virtually absent on the Yamal
Peninsula due to reindeer vaccination programs (19). However, routine
vaccination was discontinued in 2007, leading to an immunologically
naive host population that was susceptible to infection by B. anthracis
(18, 21). It is unclear whether the 2016 outbreak was caused by B.
anthracis acquired from thawing permafrost and/or thawed reindeer
carcasses, or if it occurred independent of thaw in a region where
anthrax was endemic (22). Vaccination has since resumed, and no further
outbreaks have been reported (23). The inability of anthrax to spread
from person to person and the availability of modern vaccines and
antibiotics (24) suggest that emergence of B. anthracis spores from
thawing permafrost would be unlikely to cause a geographically
widespread epidemic or pandemic. In general, modern antibiotics make
potential emerging bacterial pathogens more containable than viral
pathogens. We therefore focus on viral pathogens for the remainder of
this perspective. Box 1. Definitions and terminology Viral pathogen A
virus that "causes damage in a susceptible host or has the potential to
do so" (25). Spillover Transmission of a virus from one species to
another, establishing an infection in a new host (25, 26). This
definition includes spillovers that are followed by transmission between
individuals in the new host species and spillovers that dead-end in the
new host (i.e., there is no subsequent transmission between individuals
in the new host species), as occurs when hantaviruses and the rabies
virus spillover into humans from animal hosts (27, 28). Host jump We
define host jump as a spillover followed by sustained transmission
between individuals in the new host species. Zoonosis Infection
transmitted from non-human animals to humans. Giant viruses The
existence of giant viruses was first recognized in 2003 when a virus
measuring 0.7 µm in diameter was isolated from an amoeba host (29).
Since then, many additional giant viruses have been identified through
cultivation-based approaches and in metagenomic sequence data from
environmental samples (30--32). They are characterized by their
exceptionally large size, can typically be observed with a light
microscope, and are larger than some bacterial cells. Giant viruses have
been placed in the diverse Nucleocytoviricota phylum, which includes
other lineages of large (but not giant) viruses. There is not a formal
consensus on which clades within Nucleocytoviricota constitute giant
viruses, in part because taxonomic classification is challenging (33),
but they typically include members of the Mimiviridae, Marseilleviridae,
Pithoviridae, and Pandoraviridae families (31, 34--37). In some
instances, the term "giant viruses" has been expanded to describe the
entire Nucleocytoviricota phylum (38). However, this phylum covers an
enormous phylogenetic range (including variola virus, which causes
smallpox) with lineages that differ substantially from giant viruses
found in permafrost and other environments (31, 39, 40). Here, we adhere
to the non-expanded use of the term that differentiates between large
and giant viruses. Potential viral pathogens from thawing permafrost
could cause human disease outbreaks through three general pathways. The
first is reintroduction of human viral pathogens, such as those causing
influenza and smallpox, from thawing graves, mass burial sites, or soil
or ice to the modern environment. The second is reintroduction of
viruses with wildlife or domestic animal hosts from thawed remains or
soil and ice, which could be transmitted directly to humans or could
infect animals before jumping to humans. The third is the spillover of
permafrost viruses with microbial hosts, such as microeukaryotes,
bacteria, and archaea, to humans or animals when permafrost thaws. To
initiate an outbreak, viruses spilling over would need to both establish
an infection in the new host and subsequently be transmitted between
individuals in the new host species. As discussed in more detail in
later sections, this third pathway is an especially unlikely scenario.
All of these general pathways depend on whether viruses can survive and
remain infectious for decades to millennia in permafrost in sufficient
numbers to cause disease. The latter two also depend on the ability of
viruses to spillover from the original reservoir and initiate a
successful chain of transmission in the new host (41). This perspective
discusses each scenario and the factors that inform risk assessments.
HUMAN PATHOGENIC VIRUSES IN PERMAFROST Smallpox Smallpox is caused by
the variola virus, a double-stranded DNA virus with a 186-kb genome
(42). The last known natural case occurred in 1977, and the World Health
Assembly declared it officially eradicated in 1980 (43). Since
eradication, bodies from permafrost have been tested for evidence of
viable virus at archeological sites or when warm temperatures threaten
burial sites (15, 44). The first such test was in the 1990s, initiated
by the discovery of a wooden vault, near the village of Pokhodsk in
northern Siberia, that contained mummified bodies of smallpox victims
(44). Scientists from the Vector Institute (a facility near Novosibirsk
that is one of the two places on Earth that holds remaining stores of
smallpox virus) and their colleagues collected samples from the chamber,
including from smallpox pustules. Back in the lab, they were unable to
isolate live virus from the samples (44--46) and explained that the
virus may have been destroyed by prior freeze--thaw cycles since the
burial site was near the permafrost surface and may have periodically
thawed during warm years (44, 46). Another attempt at testing for
variola virus was from well-preserved frozen mummies at an archeological
site in the central Sakha Republic in Eastern Siberia (15). Quick burial
after death and preservation efforts during excavation and sampling
increased the probability of virus preservation. Rather than attempting
to recover viable virus, the length of variola virus DNA fragments was
used as a proxy for the presence of intact virus. Since an intact genome
is necessary for viability, infectivity would be possible only if long
pieces of DNA remained. PCR products were obtained for three short DNA
fragments (139, 145, and 590 bp), and sequence analysis confirmed
amplicons were from the variola virus. Long-distance PCR (targeting an
\~2-kb region of the viral genome) failed to produce amplification
products, ruling out the presence of intact viral particles. The
influenza pandemic of 1918 The influenza pandemic of 1918, caused by an
H1N1 influenza A virus with a 13.5-kb RNA genome, resulted in the deaths
of tens of millions of people (47). The pandemic was particularly
devastating for residents of Alaska Native communities, who suffered 82%
of influenza-associated deaths in Alaska (48). The story of virus
recovery efforts from human remains in permafrost is centered in Brevig
Mission (called Teller Mission in 1918), a small Inupiat village. On 14
November 1918, Brevig Mission had \~80 adult residents. From 15 to 20
November, influenza claimed the lives of 72 residents. A burial site was
dug into the permafrost, where the preserved remains of victims were
undisturbed until 1951 when scientist Johan Hultin obtained permission
from village elders to excavate the burial site (49, 50). Tissue was
collected from the lungs of four individuals who had been interred in
permafrost. To determine if infectious H1N1 virus persisted, the lung
tissue was cultured in embryonated chicken eggs (51), a highly sensitive
method for influenza virus detection (52). However, no evidence of
infectious virus was observed (50, 51). Forty-six years after the first
attempt and 79 years after the pandemic, Hultin and colleagues again
obtained permission to excavate the Brevig Mission gravesite for an
attempt at H1N1 virus recovery. Lung tissue was collected from the
remains of four individuals buried at a depth of approximately 2 m.
Influenza virus RNA was detected in one of the individuals using reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) testing. However, only small fragments of the
viral genome (\<120 nucleotides) could be amplified (51, 53), showing
that viable viral particles did not remain in the samples and suggesting
that influenza virus does not survive in permafrost. The interred
remains of individuals from Brevig Mission represent the highest
probability scenario investigated to date in terms of human pathogenic
virus preservation. Gold miners, who were skilled at excavating in
permafrost, were employed by the territorial government to dig the
burial site. Individuals were buried at 2 m, below depths susceptible to
occasional thaw during warm years. The 1951 excavation recovered
"generous" biopsies from eight lungs, which all tested negative for the
presence of influenza virus (51). In 1997, the remains of four
individuals were uncovered (53). One was well preserved, which was
likely due to subcutaneous fatty tissue that had protected the internal
organs. It was tissue from that lung that yielded small viral genome
fragments (51). Lessons learned from variola virus and the 1918 H1N1
influenza virus These examples suggest that human pathogenic viruses
probably do not remain infectious when frozen in permafrost, even when
preservation conditions are nearly ideal and samples are carefully
collected using procedures to preserve viability or genome integrity
(17, 54). The small number of examples makes the precise hazard
difficult to predict, but also points to another consideration:
specifically, that the number of well-preserved grave sites may be quite
small. Digging into frozen ground is difficult and requires special
tools and/or techniques (51). Burial in the active layer (soil
overlaying permafrost that freezes and thaws annually), as occurred in
the case of 1918 influenza victims on Svalbard (55), or in shallow
permafrost that is near freezing and occasionally thaws during warm
years, can reduce the number of viable viral particles by many fold due
to freeze--thaw cycles (54). Even for recently deceased influenza
victims, the infectious hazard of human remains is low. Guidelines for
funeral directors and mortuary staff place influenza in the low-risk
category, and viewing and embalming are considered safe (56--58).
[Together, the combination of [**limited infectious** virus **survival**
in **permafrost**, a]{.mark} potentially [small number of]{.mark}
well-[**preserved burial sites**, and low **transmission risk from human
remains** suggests that thawing permafrost is not a probable
**exposure** ]{.mark}**pathway**]{.underline}**.** WILDLIFE AND DOMESTIC
ANIMAL HOSTS Reintroduction of a virus from thawing animal remains or
water and soil that previously served as wildlife habitat could have
potentially deleterious impacts on non-human animal populations. Human
populations could be affected if the pathogen is able to shift hosts.
There is, however, no precedent for a domestic animal or wildlife
disease outbreak following emergence of a viral pathogen from frozen
soils, nor recognized events where viruses from recently thawed
permafrost caused zoonotic disease. This does not mean that such a
scenario is impossible, but it does imply that it is improbable. The
closest example, specifically the 2016 anthrax outbreak, was caused by
an environmentally resistant endospore-forming bacterium rather than a
virus, and it is still unclear whether thawing permafrost was a
causative factor (22). Pathogenic viruses in animal remains face the
same degradative processes that compromise influenza and variola viruses
in permafrost, as described in previous sections. Delays between death
and entombment in permafrost, nucleic acid damage that accumulates over
time, and exposure to freeze--thaw cycles cause the degradation of viral
particles, limiting the potential for viable virus to persist in animal
remains (59--62). Damage begins to occur almost immediately after death
(59), causing a rapid decline in the number of infectious viral
particles (63--65). A few exceptionally well-preserved animal specimens
show evidence of immediate burial in permafrost or ice (66, 67), but the
majority exhibit signs of delay between death and the point of
preservation (e.g., tissue destruction, partial decomposition, or
dismemberment) (68--72). Though permafrost slows nucleic acid
degradation, significant damage still occurs in the form fragmentation,
crosslinking, and lesion accumulation (62). DNA extracted from ancient
faunal remains contains a mix DNA from the animal itself, microorganisms
(including viruses) present at the time of death, and microorganisms
introduced postmortem (59, 73, 74). This DNA is typically highly
fragmented, usually less than a few hundred base pairs in length but
often much smaller (73--77). RNA, when recoverable, is even more
degraded (78). Even remains preserved soon after death experience
nucleic acid damage (79, 80), which accumulates over time (59). Most
well-preserved animal specimens found in permafrost date back to the
late Pleistocene (between 11,700 and 129,000 years ago) and early
Holocene (between 8,200 and 11,700 years ago) (68, 81, 82). These
timeframes exceed the expected survival of fully intact nucleic acids
from viral and other microbial sources unless they are protected by
stress-resistant forms (e.g., capsids that shield against harsh
extracellular environments or cysts) or they have low levels of
metabolic activity that enable DNA repair (79, 83, 84). Unlike viruses
associated with microbial hosts in permafrost (discussed in the next
section), animal viruses lack adaptations to the permafrost environment
and do not have the protection of a cold-adapted host that can perform
DNA repair or enter dormancy (11, 79, 83, 85, 86). In stark contrast to
the hypothetical risk posed by viruses from thawing permafrost, viruses
circulating among wild and domestic animals have repeatedly jumped into
human hosts, causing disease outbreaks. Examples include the viruses
causing coronavirus disease 2019, Ebola, and avian influenza (87--89).
This suggests that risks of disease outbreaks from viruses of animal
origin are much more likely to stem from contact with extant wildlife
(direct or indirect) in the Arctic and subarctic rather than emergence
from permafrost (90, 91). PERMAFROST VIRUSES WITH MICROBIAL HOSTS Giant
viruses in permafrost In contrast to the viruses causing smallpox and
influenza, numerous giant viruses have been revived from late
Pleistocene-aged permafrost (31, 92). These giant viruses infect
Acanthamoeba (31), a genus of amoeba that is broadly distributed in both
natural and built environments (93, 94). Beyond permafrost, giant
viruses have a widespread global distribution and can infect amoebae and
other protist hosts such as algae (95--98). Their persistence in
permafrost likely stems from a wide range of virus and host adaptations
to extreme conditions (86). Giant virus capsids are incredibly stable
(99), and their outer walls are comparable in thickness to Gram-positive
bacterial cell walls (100), which enable the viruses to retain
infectivity after exposure to chemicals, desiccation, and extremes in
temperature, pH, and salinity (85, 101--103). Beyond the robust viral
structure, Acanthamoeba hosts may offer protection against extreme
conditions (104). Acanthamoeba form rugged double-walled cysts
(105--108) and may also have freeze-resistant non-encysted forms with
low levels of metabolic activity (109). Encystment of an infected cell
or maintenance of an infection in a non-encysted state could facilitate
virus survival and enable reemergence when permafrost thaws. Human
pathogenic viruses are comparatively fragile and are not protected from
extreme conditions by a cold-adapted host. Even variola virus, which can
survive outside a host for several years in scabs and lesion crusts
(often collected for variolation efforts) and is known for being stable
(110), does not appear to survive for a few hundred years in permafrost
(15, 54), let alone thousands of years as seen in giant viruses.
Together, these data suggest that the persistence of giant viruses in
permafrost is not a reliable indicator of the ability of human viral
pathogens to likewise survive in permafrost. Giant viruses have been
associated with conditions in humans, such as pneumonia and keratitis,
leading to questions about their potential to cause disease (111, 112).
However, amoebae that host giant viruses are also present in such cases.
These amoebae either directly cause disease (e.g., Acanthamoeba
keratitis \[113\]) or play a crucial role in infections, such as
facilitating the transmission of Legionella pneumophila in respiratory
illness (114). There is no evidence of a causal link between giant
viruses and disease (37). The absence of such connections strongly
suggests that giant viruses are unable to infect humans directly.
Associations between giant virues and humans are probably incidental,
caused by viruses co-occurring with thier amoeba hosts (93, 99, 102,
107). Other microbial viruses in permafrost In addition to giant
amoeba-infecting viruses, permafrost (like other soils) contains diverse
viral communities with bacterial, archaeal, and other microeukaryotic
hosts (9, 115--117). Stable isotope probing, RNA sequencing, and thaw
experiments show that at least a subset of these viruses maintain
viability and can be active at subzero temperatures (10, 118). In
extreme environments, including permafrost, viruses can have multiple
survival mechanisms, such as increased virion (viral particle) stability
and integrity, auxiliary metabolic genes that aid host survival in cold
conditions, and the ability to integrate their genetic material into the
host genome, allowing the virus to coexist within a (cold adapted) host
in a quiescent state (11, 12, 119--121). Potential for viruses with
microbial hosts to spillover to humans and animals The theoretical risk
posed by permafrost viruses with microbial hosts to human populations
can be evaluated by exploring the origin and evolution of pathogenic
viruses and examining whether there is precedent for microbial viruses
spilling over to humans or animals. Host jumps between closely related
species are common at evolutionary timescales; 61% of human pathogens
and 75% of emerging human pathogens have zoonotic origins (122). The
likelihood of successful host jumping decreases as the phylogenetic
distance between hosts increases (123--125). Viruses bind specifically
to molecules on the host cell surface, rely on the host's cellular
machinery for replication, and must evade the host's immune system
(126--128). As a result, they are typically highly adapted to specific
hosts and can only "work" in hosts with similar molecular pathways (129,
130). Given the large phylogenetic distance between soil microbes and
humans, such a shift would be extraordinarily unlikely, if not
impossible. Investigating the origins of human pathogenic viruses shows
that microorganisms are not a source of spillovers. The majority of
zoonotic viruses (\>80%) are from mammals, while the remaining \~20% are
primarily from birds (87, 124, 131, 132). Instances of viruses infecting
both humans and other vertebrates, such as reptiles, are rare (131, 133,
134). Non-zoonotic viruses, such as papillomaviruses and herpesviruses,
which are host specific, offer insights into potential host jumps in the
more distant past. For these viruses, the host phylogenetic tree roughly
mirrors the viral phylogenetic tree (135--137). For example, human
papillomaviruses are most closely related to papillomaviruses with
non-human primate hosts, and the phylogenetic distance between viruses
increases with evolutionary distance between hosts (136, 138, 139).
These evolutionary relationships can largely be attributed to
co-speciation between virus and host and occasional instances of
interspecies virus transfer (135, 137, 140). However, there is no
evidence to support a microbial origin for these viruses (135, 137, 139,
141, 142). [[The **lack of precedent for microbial viruses** jumping to
human or animal hosts suggests this scenario is **unlikely to arise from
thawing permafrost**.]{.mark} Humans are constantly exposed to an
enormous diversity of viruses from the environment]{.underline}. Viruses
are crucial members of all Earth's ecosystems (143), and soils are
perhaps the largest viral reservoir on Earth (144). In some soils, viral
abundance can exceed more than one billion per gram, and similar counts
are found per gram of human intestinal content (144--146). Billions of
viruses can be swallowed during a swim in the sea (147, 148). Despite
this constant bombardment, there is no indication that microbe-infecting
viruses represent a major disease risk for humans, wildlife, or domestic
animals (87). [[**Research**, **surveillance**, and prevention
strategies aimed at mitigating the risk and impact of future pandemics
do not identify **these viruses as potential
threats**]{.underline}]{.mark} **(**90, 149, 150). There is no reason to
think that viruses from permafrost represent a greater risk for
spillover than viruses maintained in other environments such as
temperate soils and aquatic systems. CONCLUSIONS Currently available
data indicate that there is no increased risk of human viral pathogen
emergence from permafrost compared to other environmental sources. We do
not claim that viral pathogens in permafrost pose zero risk or that
surveillance of putative viral pathogens in permafrost is unnecessary.
However, [[there is]{.mark} **currently [no evidence]{.mark} that
[human]{.mark}** [or animal viral pathogens frozen in permafrost pose
**a**]{.mark}**n imminent [disease outbreak
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Though climate change is
accelerating thaw, the entry of microbes from ancient permafrost into
the modern environment is not a new phenomenon. Permafrost is
continually and naturally exposed to the modern environment by processes
such as erosion, cryoturbation, frost heave, solifluction, wildfire, and
climate fluctuations (151--153). [[Humans have been in the Arctic for
more than 40,000 years]{.mark} (Alaska up to 25,000 years and
Scandinavia \~5,000 to 12,000 years) (154--156). [This suggests that
people]{.mark} are and [have been regularly exposed to viruses from
**permafrost soils, with no clear evidence for large-scale health
consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Framing viral discovery efforts in
the cryosphere as a search for "zombie viruses" or potentially pandemic
pathogens is not particularly useful and perhaps even harmful. Stoking
fears of viruses in thawing permafrost may inadvertently discourage
customary and traditional cultural practices among subarctic and Arctic
residents or divert attention from the more pressing ways that pathogens
in the warming Arctic pose risk to human health and well-being (157).
For example, wildlife and humans increasingly occupy shared habitats,
providing opportunities for viruses maintained in animals to spillover
into humans (90). Arthropod and rodent disease vector ranges are
expanding and shifting northward (158). Extreme precipitation and
flooding events are increasing, threatening infrastructure such as water
and waste treatment facilities (159--161). Higher temperatures increase
the survival of some water-borne disease agents (91). Furthermore,
wildlife health may be affected as a consequence of climate change,
which further compromises fragile ecosystems and the people that rely
upon them (162). Box 2. Zombies are fictional and have racist origins
The frequent presentation of "zombie" pathogen in news articles and a
few academic articles has received immense and improper attention (31,
163). The term zombie pathogen is typically shorthand for a pathogen
from the past that has been preserved in permafrost and could become
active and cause human disease when released by thaw. As we discuss
here, this outcome is highly unlikely, and yet the term zombie virus is
used to elicit an apocalyptic fear response in the reader, often to grab
headlines. It is not well known, and thus important to examine, that the
zombie fantasy has origins in the racist past against people of color,
particularly in North America and the Caribbean (164, 165). It
originated from the dehumanizing violence against Haitian slaves in the
17th century, born of Vodou folklore but then modified and used as a
means of control and oppression (166). It was later made popular in
horror movies containing escapist end-time fantasy (166, 167). Because
of its racist origins, this mythology perpetuates the idea that
"invaders" that are unlike us are coming to destroy our world and that
destruction is imminent and fast moving (168). Despite the collective
interest in zombies, it is important to note its cultural origin so that
the concept can be more easily put aside as fiction, rather than a
scientific metaphor. The word's use in scientific literature is
unhelpful, provides only titillating headlines, and unconsciously
supports a narrative of xenophobic fear of things we do not understand
(169).

It is currently unknown how many viruses are trapped in permafrost, [but
[when thawed]{.mark}, so-called ''sleeping'' or ''zombie'' [viruses may
become free to infect]{.mark} [hosts]{.mark}. Although viruses can be
preserved in a frozen environment for long periods of time,69
**endurance of [environment pressures]{.mark} [during thawing]{.mark}
without bursting [is critical for viruses to remain]{.mark} intact and
[infectious]{.mark}**.]{.underline} One example of [a class of viruses
that have managed to survive in ancient permafrost are giant
viruses]{.underline}. Giant viruses or nucleocytoplasmic large DNA
viruses (NCDLVs[) are known to have durable multiple layers enclosing
virion nucleoids, making them resistant to the harsh permafrost
environmen]{.underline}t70 (giant viruses in Figure 1). Two members of
giant viruses, Pithovirus sibericum50 and Mollivirus sibericum, 71 have
been isolated and revived from 30,000-year-old Siberian permafrost.
Although these viruses were preserved frozen in permafrost for at least
30,000 years, after thawing, they were able to infect a modern-day
version of their host.50 The isolated giant viruses were reported to
have thick outer walls of 40--70 nm,71,72 comparable with 20--80 nm for
Gram-positive bacteria.73 However, the giant viruses that have been
characterized to date do not pose a threat to humans and other animals
because their natural hosts are micro-eukaryotes, such as protists and
algae (protozoa in Figure 1). Another giant virus, Mimivirus, which was
first isolated from water samples for investigating a pneumonia
outbreak,74 was found to be capable of entering human and mouse myeloid
cells, resulting in a significant increase in viral DNA and a decrease
in macrophage viability.[75 A clinical study also reported a high
prevalence of Mimivirus antibodies in individuals with pneumonia with
unknown underlying mechanisms.]{.underline}76 Although viruses often
have a narrow and specific host range, these findings challenge the
assumption that micro-eukaryotes are exclusive hosts for giant viruses,
highlighting a major knowledge gap in virus-host relationships[.
Currently, however, **[there is no evidence]{.mark}** showing that
isolated and revived [giant viruses]{.mark} [from **permafrost can cause
human infections**]{.mark}. The majority of [DNA viruses in permafrost
environments are phages and]{.mark}, therefore, [cannot cause
disease]{.mark} in humans.]{.underline} In fact, phages are arguably the
most well-studied type of virus, and the majority of them (and viruses
in general) are host specific. This means that they can only infect
bacteria that are of the same species and often only the same
strain.77,78 [Despite [phages]{.mark} being largely bacterial host
specific, they appear to be [major community-structuring agents]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [uphold]{.mark} a [diverse permafrost microbiome]{.mark}.
A diverse microbiome [prevents any specific bacterium]{.mark} (e.g., a
human pathogen) [from growing]{.mark} in abundance. This means that,
beyond [phages killing pathogenic bacteria]{.mark}**, thereby protecting
us,** they can [create an ecosystem]{.mark} [where]{.mark} pathogenic
[bacteria]{.mark} [are less likely to be]{.mark} [of concern]{.mark} to
humans.]{.underline}79 Given current evidence of the widespread presence
of phages in all soils, including permafrost, they are very unlikely to
represent a threat to humans. [Other [types of]{.mark} DNA
[viruses]{.mark}, such as Variola virus, which causes smallpox**, [that
infect humans may be present in permafrost
environments]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} [but they have not been
detected]{.mark} in sufficient numbers or [with good enough quality to
pose a threat]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because DNA viruses co-evolve and
replicate in the presence of their hosts, for pathogenic human viruses
to be present in sufficient quantities to cause infection, human/animal
remains would have to be preserved in a condition that allows viral
survival. However, this is highly unlikely. [For example, Variola virus
DNA was recovered from several archeological sites in northeastern
Siberia dating back to the late 17th--19th century. Smallpox victims
mummified in the permafrost were found, but [the Variola virus **DNA was
highly degraded, and, thus, the virus was not infectious.**]{.mark}81,82
Therefore, although human DNA viral pathogens can be detected in
permafrost, the risk of infection is negligible and only of concern when
the virus is intact and present in sufficient quantities to cause
disease.]{.underline} It is noteworthy that, to date, **[[there have
been no reported cases of viral infections from thawed permafrost in
humans]{.mark}.]{.underline}** To our knowledge, there is no genetically
informed ecological study of the RNA viral community in permafrost. One
reason why RNA viruses are understudied compared with DNA viruses is
that RNA is less stable compared with DNA83 and more prone to
degradation during the extraction process. One example of an RNA virus
is the H1N1 influenza A virus that caused the 1918 pandemic. This virus
killed an estimated 50 million people, which overwhelmed the burial of
infected humans, leading to mass graves and unburied corpses.84 These
mass graves largely went unmarked, leaving the potential for humans to
interact with these corpses should permafrost thaw[. In the 1990s,
attempts were made to reconstruct or revive the 1918 pandemic influenza
virus from frozen samples, but they were unsuccessful **because the RNA
was highly degraded**]{.underline}. In the early 2000s, advances in
technology allowed successful reconstruction of the H1N1 virus from
permafrost, but it was not viable.80 Complete hemagglutinin (HA) genes,
encoding binding proteins to initiate infection, were detected in
reserve-transcribed RNAs extracted from frozen lung tissues of 1918
influenza victims who were buried in a mass grave in permafrost.85
Although this last example could be taken as a cause for concern, the
viruses were not infectious. Ancient RNA extracted from wolf tissue
buried in late Pleistocene permafrost showed no traces of RNA viruses.86
[To date[, there **is no report of intact and infectious RNA
viruses**]{.mark} directly [isolated from permafrost]{.mark}. Therefore,
although RNA viruses can be preserved in permafrost, based on our
current knowledge, the risk of these RNA viruses being **[infectious to
humans or other animals is unlikely.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Permafrost
thaw is causing major changes in plant composition and productivity and
will undoubtedly affect plant viral pathogens.87 Previously, plant viral
pathogens, such as ancient caribou feces-associated virus (aCFV) and
tomato mosaic Tobamovirus (ToMV) were recovered from ice.27,88 aCFV is a
DNA virus that can infect Nicotiana benthamiana (a close relative of
tobacco) and may even infect other plants or fungi (e.g., mosses and
lichens); it was recovered from caribou feces dating back 700 years
before present (BP).27 To test whether aCFV was still infectious, a
modern version of N. benthamiana was exposed and successfully infected.
[Although the plant became infected, it had an asymptomatic infection,
likely because of changes in the plant species over time.]{.underline}
Unlike aCFV, ToMV is one of the most common plant viruses because it has
the ability to infect many different plants, such as cucumber, lettuce,
beet, and pepper.89 This RNA virus is very stable, having been shown
previously to survive UV radiation and desiccation, and was recovered
from ice cores dating back up to 140,000 years ago.88 It is unknown
whether the recovered ToMV could still be infectious, but it presents a
potential problem because it is one of the most destructive diseases,
resulting in serious crop losses.90 Introduction of non-native crops to
soils, such as recently thawed permafrost soils, could also increase the
likelihood of a viral plant epidemic.87,90

**No Impact: Humans are resilient -- no extinction from disease**

University of Pittsburgh. He writes regularly at Tracking Zebra. "Why
Hasn\'t Disease Wiped out the Human Race?", The Atlantic, 6-17-2016,

"You'll tell us when you're worried, right?"

That was the question posed to me countless times at the height of the
2014 West African Ebola outbreak. As an infectious disease physician, I
was interviewed on outlets such as CNN, NPR, and Fox News about the
dangers of the virus, and the answer I gave was always the same: "Ebola
is a deadly, scary disease, but it is not that contagious. It will not
find the U.S. or other industrialized nations hospitable."

In other words, no, I wasn't worried---and not because I have a rosy
outlook on infectious diseases. [I'm well-aware of the damage these
diseases are causing around the world: HIV, malaria, tuberculosis; the
influenza pandemic that took the world by surprise in 2009; the
anti-vaccine movement bumping cases of measles to an all-time
post-vaccine-era high; antibiotic-resistant bacteria threatening to
collapse the entire structure of modern medicine---all these, like
Ebola, are continuously placing an enormous number of lives at
risk.]{.underline}

[But when people ask me if I'm worried about infectious diseases,
[they're often not asking about the threat to human lives; they're
asking about the threat to human life.]{.mark} With each outbreak of a
headline-grabbing emerging infectious disease comes a fear of extinction
itself. The [fear envisions a large proportion of humans succumbing to
infection, leaving no survivors or so few that the species can't be
sustained.]{.mark}]{.underline}

I'm not afraid of this apocalyptic scenario, but I do understand the
impulse[. [Worry about the end is a]{.underline}]{.mark}
[quintessentially [human trait]{.mark}. Thankfully, [so is our
resilience]{.mark}.]{.underline}

For most of mankind's history, [[infectious diseases were the
existential threat to humanity]{.mark}---and for good reason. They were
quite successful at killing people]{.underline}: The 6th century's
Plague of Justinian knocked out an estimated 17 percent of the world's
population; the 14th century Black Death decimated a third of Europe;
the 1918 influenza pandemic killed 5 percent of the world; malaria is
estimated to have killed half of all humans who have ever lived.

Any yet, of course[, [humanity continued to flourish]{.mark}. Our
species' recent explosion in lifespan is [almost exclusively the result
of the control of infectious diseases]{.mark} through sanitation,
vaccination, and antimicrobial therapies]{.underline}. Only in the
modern era, in which many infectious diseases have been tamed in the
industrial world, do people have the luxury of death from cancer, heart
disease, or stroke in the 8th decade of life. [Childhoods are free from
watching siblings and friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet
fever, smallpox, measles, and the like.]{.underline}

So what would it take for a disease to wipe out humanity now?

In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the
disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe threatens the human race with
extinction, and humanity's best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy
organism. Fortunately, outside of fiction, there's no reason to expect
alien pathogens to wage war on the human race any time soon, and my
analysis suggests that any real-life domestic microbe reaching an
extinction level of threat probably is just as unlikely.

When humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by
infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short.

Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a very special
combination of two attributes. First, it would have to be so unfamiliar
that no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to it. Second, it
would need to have a high and surreptitious transmissibility before
symptoms occur. The first is essential because any microbe from a known
class of pathogens would, by definition, have family members that could
serve as models for containment and countermeasures. The second would
allow the hypothetical disease to spread without being detected by even
the most astute clinicians.

The three infectious diseases most likely to be considered
extinction-level threats in the world today---influenza, HIV, and
Ebola---don't meet these two requirements. Influenza, for instance,
despite its well-established ability to kill on a large scale, its
contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift away from
our vaccines, is still what I would call a "known unknown." While there
are many mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at least the
time of Hippocrates, humans have been attuned to its risk. And in the
modern era, a full-fledged industry of influenza preparedness exists,
with effective vaccine strategies and antiviral therapies.

HIV, which has killed 39 million people over several decades, is
similarly limited due to several factors. Most importantly, HIV's
dependency on blood and body fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola)
requires intimate human-to-human contact, which limits contagion. Highly
potent antiviral therapy allows most people to live normally with the
disease, and a substantial group of the population has genetic mutations
that render them impervious to infection in the first place. Lastly,
simple prevention strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug
users and barrier contraceptives---when available---can curtail
transmission risk.

Ebola, for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as several others,
also falls short of the mark. This is especially due to the fact that it
spreads almost exclusively through people with easily recognizable
symptoms, plus the taming of its once unfathomable 90 percent mortality
rate by simple supportive care.

Beyond those three, every other known disease falls short of what seems
required to wipe out humans---which is, of course, why we're still here.
And it's not that diseases are ineffective. On the contrary, [[diseases'
failure to knock us out is a testament to just how resilient humans
are]{.mark}.]{.underline} Part of our evolutionary heritage is our
immune system, one of the most complex on the planet, even without the
benefit of vaccines or the helping hand of antimicrobial drugs. This
system, when viewed at a species level, can adapt to almost any enemy
imaginable. [Coupled to genetic variations amongst humans---which open
up the possibility for a range of advantages, from imperviousness to
infection to a tendency for mild symptoms---[this adaptability ensures
that **almost any infectious disease onslaugh**t will leave a large
proportion of the population alive to rebuild]{.mark}, in contrast to
the fictional Hollywood versions.]{.underline}

[While the immune system's role can never be understated, [an even more
powerful protector is the faculty of consciousness.]{.mark} Humans are
not the most prolific, quickly evolving, or strongest organisms on the
planet, but as Aristotle identified, humans are the rational
animals---and it is this fundamental distinguishing characteristic that
[allows humans to form abstractions, think in principles, and plan
long-range]{.mark}]{.underline}. These capacities, in turn, allow humans
to modify, alter, and improve themselves and their environments.
Consciousness equips us, at an individual and a species level, to make
nature safe for the species through such technological marvels as
antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines, and sanitation. [When humans began to
focus their minds on the problems posed by infectious disease, human
life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short. In many ways, [human
consciousness became infectious diseases' worthiest
adversary]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### All Microbes Good, Warming Harms Them

**RAMACHANDRAN '23** (Arthi Ramachandran, ARTHI RAMACHANDRAN is a
doctoral candidate at Concordia University in Montreal, Canada who is
studying bacterial adaptation and evolution in the Arctic Ocean. She is

The Arctic Ocean is a unique and fragile ecosystem that is particularly
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. If the Arctic region
experiences a temperature increase of 1.5°C or more, warmer sea surface
temperatures and unprecedented melting of sea ice will alter the ocean's
water masses, circulation patterns and more, including the communities
of bacteria at the base of the food web. In terms of total biomass,
[most life in the Arctic Ocean is microbial---and these microbes are
essential to the health and stability of Arctic marine
ecosystems.]{.underline} [They provide critical ecosystem services ,
such as nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, decomposition, primary
production, water purification and climate regulation.]{.underline} Yet
the consequences of climate warming on the microbial food web---and, in
turn, the Earth's biogeochemical cycles---are not yet well understood.
One thing we do know is that [the climate crisis has significant
implications for these microbial communities.]{.underline} Rising
temperatures have already led to observable shifts in their composition
and abundance, and these shifts have the potential to alter the entire
Arctic food web. [As the Arctic continues to warm, there will be a
continued increase in sea ice melt and an influx of
freshwater,]{.underline} which will decrease the salinity of the Arctic
Ocean's upper waters. This means that [previously dominant bacterial
groups may decline,]{.underline} while others that are better adapted to
less saline environments will thrive. [We do not yet know what the
downstream effects of this might be, including whether these will be
positive or negative.]{.underline} © Elisabeth Kruger / WWF-US Tiny
organisms, global impacts [Changes in microbial communities may even
affect]{.underline} greenhouse gas [emissions]{.underline}. For example,
[certain bacterial species are known to consume methane and carbon
dioxide]{.underline}. Changes in their composition and abundance in
response to climate warming might alter the rates at which these
greenhouse gases are consumed. [An increase in the presence of bacteria
that consume greenhouse gases, like methane, could be
positive]{.underline} in the short term---[but there could]{.underline}
be long-term consequences because this could mean [a decrease in other
types of bacteria]{.underline}, and it's unclear how the ecosystem
services they provide might shift. We're still trying to figure out if
and how shifts in microbial communities due to climate change will have
negative effects on the ecosystem as a whole. Furthermore, shifts in the
composition and abundance of microbial communities may have cascading
effects on fish and marine mammals because these [species rely on
microbial communities for their food.]{.underline} The rapidly changing
environmental conditions in the Arctic Ocean have led to questions about
whether there will be an increase in adaptation, evolution and/or
migration of microbial organisms. The Arctic Ocean's microbial
communities can be seen as both sentinels and amplifiers of global
change. Their responses to climate warming can provide important
insights into the overall health and functioning of Arctic marine
ecosystems as well as the potential of these systems to influence global
biogeochemical cycles. These invisible changes may have drastic and
irreversible impacts on Arctic and global ecosystems, especially if we
continue on the current pathway to a future where the global temperature
rise exceeds 1.5°C.

**Pandemics don't cause extinction**

**Pappas 23** -- Pappas is a freelance science journalist, quoting Amesh

The end of humanity is far more likely to be brought about by multiple
factors, Kemp says---a pileup of disasters. [Though
apocalyptic]{.underline} [movies]{.underline} often [turn to
viruses]{.underline}, bacteria and fungi to wipe out huge swathes of
population[,]{.underline} [a
pandemic]{.underline} [alone]{.underline} **[is unlikely to

says Amesh Adalja, an [infectious disease physician at the Johns Hopkins
Center for Health Security]{.underline}. [A pandemic could be
devastating]{.underline} and lead to severe upheaval---the Black Death
killed 30 to 50 percent of the population of
Europe---[but]{.underline} **[it's
unlikely]{.underline}** **[that]{.underline}** **[a pathogen would kill
all of humanity]{.underline}**, Adalja says. "Yes, an infectious disease
could kill a lot of people," he says, "but then [you're going to have a
group \[of people\] that are resilient]{.underline} to it [and
survive]{.underline}."

[Humans]{.underline} also **[have tools to fight
back]{.underline}** against a pathogen, [from]{.underline} [medical
treatments]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [vaccines]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the
social-[distancing measures]{.underline} that became familiar worldwide
during the COVID pandemic, Adalja says. There is one example of a
mammalian species that may have been entirely wiped out by an infectious
disease, he says: the Christmas Island rat (Rattus macleari), also
called Maclear's rat, an endemic island species that may have gone
extinct because of the introduction of a parasite.

"**[We are not helpless]{.underline}** [like the Christmas Island rat
who couldn't get away]{.underline} from that island," Adalja says.
"**[We have]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** **[ability to change

For most of human history, natural pandemics have posed the greatest
risk of mass global fatalities.37 However, there are some reasons to
believe that [natural pandemics
are]{.underline} **[very]{.underline}** **[unlikely to
cause]{.underline}** **[human]{.underline}** [**extinction**.]{.underline} Analysis
of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list
database has shown
that [of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [833]{.underline} [recorded]{.underline} [plant
and
animal]{.underline} [species]{.underline} [extinctions]{.underline} [known
to have occurred]{.underline} [since 1500,]{.underline} **[less than
4%]{.underline}** [(31 species)]{.underline} [were ascribed to
infectious disease]{.underline}.38 [None]{.underline} [of the mammals
and amphibians on this list]{.underline} [were globally
dispersed,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [other
factors]{.underline} [aside from infectious disease]{.underline} [also
contributed]{.underline} [to their
extinction.]{.underline} [It]{.underline} therefore [seems
that]{.underline} [our]{.underline} [own]{.underline} [species,
which]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [**very
numerous**,]{.underline} [**globally dispersed**, and capable of
a]{.underline} **[rational response]{.underline}** [**to problems**,
is]{.underline} [very unlikely to be
killed]{.underline} [off]{.underline} [by
a]{.underline} [natural]{.underline} [pandemic.]{.underline}

One underlying explanation for this is [that]{.underline} [highly lethal
pathogens can kill]{.underline} [their]{.underline} [hosts before
they]{.underline} [have a chance to]{.underline} [spread]{.underline},
so [there is a]{.underline} **[selective pressure for pathogens not to
be]{.underline}** **[highly]{.underline}** **[lethal]{.underline}**.
Therefore, pathogens are likely to co-evolve with their hosts rather
than kill all possible hosts.39

Danielle: [What\'s [your estimate for 2050]{.mark}? What\'s up [with
AI]{.mark}?]{.underline}

Steven: [Where you\'ve [solved all the antibiotic
crises]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Danielle: [You\'ve solved the antibiotic crisis.]{.underline}

Steven: \[Laughs\] What are you doing next?

Tommaso: I wish I knew. There\'s a lot of dystopian TV shows that give
us a nice perspective of what can happen.

Danielle: \[Laughs\]

Steven: Those are the ones that didn\'t discover antibiotics, though, I
think. \[Laughs\]

Tommaso: No, those are not. So one of the coolest things that AI can do
these days is to use tools. So for instance, when you write an email,
you -- I guess you open Gmail or some other tool, and you just type it.
And you can also, you know, play a video game or use software or use
words. And all this activity that is done by a human can also be done by
other software -- and this is what we call agents. Agents is software
that can access other software. And the important part is that they can
reason in a -- I use this word, it\'s actually fairly different than
what that means for the human brain, but the net effect is sort of
similar. So they can reason of what the data and software say. So what
people are looking into now is to build agents that can access our data
and the internet, too, and other tools. And then they try to build an
automated reasoning platform that can understand, by combining all these
different options, what is the most sensible scientific way to move
forward.

Danielle: I didn\'t know that that was the word for it, and we have been
fighting with this ourselves in our own group. \[Laughs\] It\'s just
like, it\'s kind of funny, like, everything I feel like is coming so
fast and everyone\'s trying to, like, catch up and figure out how to
utilize it properly.

Tommaso: The word agent?

Danielle: Well, no. [Just like everything with AI. Like[, there\'s so
many opportunities]{.mark}, it just feels like it\'s an explosion of
stuff.]{.underline}

Tommaso: I think it\'s an explosion that\'s probably going to plateau at
some point. But now we are still in the explosion phase. So something
similar that happened was when we were buying computers. There was a
time in the \'80s and in the \'90s, too, when we were buying computers,
every year, there was a new kind of computer that was faster than the
other one. Whereas now, we still have computers that are better than the
one in the previous years, but the changes are not as big. And while
it\'s very hard to say whether this is going to happen for AI as well,
but I do think that at some time there will be a plateau of what AI can
do.

Danielle: So just to make sure I\'m tracking you -- I\'ll definitely ask
you as well, but -- so are you saying that you think in [2050, we\'ll be
in that plateau and [all of these agents will be able to run and
integrate things very efficiently]{.mark}?]{.underline}

Tommaso: It\'s very hard to be concrete of, I mean --

Danielle: I'm not gonna hold you to it. I won\'t come knocking at 2050
and be like, hey. \[Laughs\]

Tommaso: Yeah, I -- no, I don\'t know. \[Laughs\]

Danielle: \[Laughs\] Fair enough.

Tommaso: Yeah.

Danielle: Cool. What about you? You got your 2050 predictions?

Steven: [What our understanding of [what AI brings]{.mark}, having
worked with Tommaso and his group, [is that the things that may have
taken us a long time are taking us less time]{.mark}. And that\'s [great
for the idea of making the antibiotics]{.mark}, because we need more.
We\'re going to [continue to make -- need more]{.mark}. We\'re going to
continue to need to discover more. But what it might do then, is if we
can be more efficient and quicker about that, it might open up our time
to start thinking about these other things we\'ve talked about -- you
know, what [other uses of bacteria are there]{.mark}? What other things
can we do? What other types of bacteria can we build? And you know, if
we don\'t have to worry about dying from infection, it opens up the time
to do those types of things. That\'s the hope, right? The hope is that
those [dire predictions for 2050 don\'t come true because we or somebody
else finds a way to combat]{.mark} this.]{.underline}

Danielle: Thank you so much. This has been a really interesting talk.
It\'s really great to meet both of y\'all.

Tommaso: Thank you.

Steven: Thanks so much. Yeah.

Wellington: Danielle, great conversation! I really -- even though the
task seems really daunting, I came away thinking that AI is really going
to help us sort through what seems like a galaxy of possibilities. How
do you think this is going to cross over into your field?

Danielle: You know, that\'s kind of a funny thing, because sometimes
these types of crossovers are so unexpected. I know you like a
backstory, so I just, you know, I wish I could claim fame to this, but I
can\'t. But one of my favorite stories I ever heard was about this
scientist who really loved scuba diving. And one time he was underwater
taking pictures of a coral reef, and he found this glowing eel, which
was really special because we didn\'t know invertebrates made proteins
that glowed, right? These fluorescent proteins. He spent a whole career
-- short version of the story, he eventually found that eel, took it
back to his lab, froze it, chopped it up, identified that fluorescent
protein, and it completely revolutionized the types of readouts that we
were able to get on ion channels. So that vertebrate, what made it
really special is that fluorescent protein was smaller than one that
we\'d ever known before. And because of its size, he could stick it on
ion channels and we could visually watch networks of neurons signaling
with depolarization. And so when I think about how
[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} could really kind of cross that space, like
how lucky were we that there was a dude who loved scuba diving and
happened to also like photography and happened to be a badass
biochemist, right? So the same kind of way that I think that this could
cross over is -- what are the types of molecules that we\'re gonna find
in this chemical space that we would have never gotten our hands on
otherwise? [How [could]{.mark} we [utilize]{.mark} those, [not]{.mark}
necessarily [just for antibiotic resistance]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} maybe
those [will]{.mark} [become parts of smaller libraries]{.mark} and, you
know, those potential hits that we might utilize those molecules for
something else in life sciences research that we never would have
thought of before]{.underline}. It\'s really what\'s this serendipitous
thing that we're able to find.

Karen: So Danielle, are you talking about molecular design here?

Danielle: Absolutely. [[Using AI]{.mark} to give you access to this
chemical space, it\'s really [letting us see molecules we\'ve never seen
before]{.mark}, and we can think about utilizing the function from those
molecules in novel ways]{.underline}. So you really are getting at that
molecular design by new molecules, new function, new applications. I
think what\'s going to be really exciting is seeing how does this impact
antibiotics discovery, antibiotics resistance, but also all the other
different places in life sciences that can benefit from it. I mean, this
is cool.

[Now researchers report that they have used [artificial

Collins of the Broad Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of

activity]{.mark}]{.underline}. They then tested [[283 promising

stubbornly hard-to-kill pathogens]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Unlike a
typical AI model, which operates as an inscrutable "black box," it was

The development builds on previous research by this group and others,
including work by César de la Fuente, an assistant professor in the
department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman
School of Medicine, and his colleagues. [Scientific American spoke with
de la Fuente about the significance of the new study for using AI to
help guide the development of new antibiotics.]{.underline}

\[An edited transcript of the interview follows.\]

How significant is this finding of a new class of antibiotics using AI?

I'm very excited about this new work at the Collins Lab---I think this
is a great next breakthrough. It's an area of research that was not even
a field until five years ago. [It's an extremely exciting and very
emerging area of work, where the main goal is to use [AI for]{.mark}
[antibiotic discovery and antibiotic design]{.mark}.]{.underline} My own
laboratory has been working toward this for the past half-decade. In
this study, the researchers used deep learning to try to discover a new
type of antibiotic. They also implemented notions of "explainable AI,"
which is interesting, because when we think about machine learning and
deep learning, we think of them as black boxes. [So I think it's
interesting to start incorporating explainability into some of the
models we're building that apply AI to biology and
chemistry.]{.underline} The authors were able to find a couple of
compounds that seemed to reduce infection in mouse models, so that's
always exciting.

What advantage does AI have over humans in being able to screen and
identify new antibiotic compounds?

[AI and machines in general can systematically and very rapidly mine
structures or any sort of dataset that you give them. If you think about
the traditional antibiotic discovery pipeline, it takes around 12 years
to discover a new antibiotic, and it takes between three and six years
to discover any clinical candidates.]{.underline} Then you have to
transition them to phase I, phase II and phase III clinical trials.
[[Now, with machines, we've been able to accelerate that]{.mark}. In my
and my colleagues' own work, for example, we can [discover in a matter
of hours thousands or hundreds of thousands of]{.mark} preclinical
[candidates]{.mark} instead of having to wait three to six years. I
think [AI]{.mark} in general [has enabled that]{.mark}.]{.underline} And
I think another example of that is this work by the Collins Lab---where,
by using deep learning in this case, the team has been able to sort
through millions of chemical compounds to identify a couple that seemed
promising. That would be very hard to do manually.

**The** [study is proof [we can be optimistic about AMR]{.mark}, said
Sebastian Hiller, a structural biologist at the University of Basel in
Switzerland, who was not involved in the research: \"This is just one
example of ongoing research showing our [scientific capabilities to
fight **superbugs** are huge]{.mark},\"]{.underline} **Hiller told DW.**

Using AI to discover new antibiotics

[The study used [machine learning to search for potential antibiotic
agents in a huge database of microbes]{.mark} which live in environments
such as soil, the ocean, and human and animal guts.]{.underline}

\"Bacteria fight against each other constantly in these environments,
[using [warfare tools called peptides which are shot against other
bacteria to kill them]{.mark}]{.underline}. The researchers mined this
space for antibiotic peptides and found some hidden gems,\" Hiller said.

The algorithm sifted through billions of potential protein sequences and
narrowed it down to the top candidates with predicted antimicrobial
actions.

In total, 863,498 new antimicrobial peptides were predicted, more than
90% of which had never been described before.

[Coelho said all the peptides had the [same general mechanism]{.mark} of
action [for killing bacteria]{.mark} --- by [disrupting]{.mark} the
[cell membranes]{.mark} which protect bacteria from the
environment.]{.underline}

\"We also see that some peptides are more effective against certain
bacterial strains than others, but we cannot yet predict exactly why, or
\[say\] which peptide will work against which bacterium,\" Coelho told
DW.

Peptide antibiotics effective against bacterial infections

To find out which of these peptides could be useful as antibiotics, [the
researchers synthesized 100 peptides and tested them against 11
disease-causing bacterial strains in laboratory dishes.]{.underline}

They found that 79 peptides disrupted bacterial membranes and 63
peptides specifically targeted antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as
Escherichia coli (E.coli) and Staphylococcus aureus.

The researchers also tested the compounds in mice with infected skin
abscesses, but only three of the peptides showed antimicrobial effects
in vivo (in a living organism).

\"This indicates that their efficacy may be limited in vivo. Still, this
is a remarkable result, and the compounds might circumvent severe
toxicity side effects of last-resort antibiotics like polymyxins,\" said
Seyed Majed Modaresi at the University of Basel in Switzerland, who was
also not involved in the study.

Are these reasons to be optimistic about the fight against AMR?

The authors published their dataset with open access, which allows other
scientists to review the 863,498 peptides and develop antibiotic drugs
with specific uses in mind.

For example, [scientists could [tailor antibiotic properties to minimize
effects on \"friendly\" bacteria]{.mark} in the human gut]{.underline}.
Many antibiotics in use are known to destroy beneficial gut microbiota,
which can lead to health issues and potentially deadly pathogens to take
over.

Scientist could also use the [dataset to create antibiotics against
which bacteria do not develop resistances]{.underline}, greatly helping
in the long-term fight against AMR.

Modaresi said the new study shows that [[artificial intelligence has
become instrumental in]{.mark} the [scientific fight against AMR]{.mark}
and that \"the application of machine learning has accelerated the
process of discovering new antibiotics.\"]{.underline}

He added that the type of peptides discovered in this latest study were
just one type of many antimicrobial agents out there, and that the same
techniques could be [used to discover many other types of antibiotics,
including bacteriophages]{.underline}.

Hiller said that while there are reasons to be optimistic about the
scientific fight against AMR, the next major challenge is creating new
antibiotic agents which are commercially viable.

\"We only use new antibiotics when the old ones don\'t work anymore.
This is good as it [[prevents bacteria from developing
resistances]{.mark} to them]{.underline} but means they\'re not
financially viable,\" said Hiller.

Hiller said health organizations and governments were working on ways to
make [antibiotic commercialization more viable]{.underline} so that they
can draw from the huge pools of potential antibiotics that scientists
have discovered.

### No !\-\--Climate

**Warming doesn't cause extinction**

**Ord 20** (Ord, Toby. Senior research fellow in Phil. @ Oxford
University. Doctorate in Phil. from the University of Oxford. "The
Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity", Hachette Books,
2020. Accessed 8/13/23.) //Ulven

But the purpose of this chapter is finding and assessing threats that
pose a direct existential risk to humanity. **[Even
at]{.underline}** such **[extreme
levels]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [warming,]{.underline} [it is
difficult to see exactly how climate change could]{.underline} do so.
Major effects of climate change include reduced agricultural yields, sea
level rises, water scarcity, increased tropical diseases, ocean
acidification and the collapse of the Gulf Stream. While extremely
important when assessing the overall risks of climate change, [**no**ne
of
these]{.underline} [threaten]{.underline} **[extinction]{.underline}** [or
irrevocable collapse]{.underline}.

[Crops are]{.underline} very [sensitive to reductions]{.underline} in
temperature (due to frosts), [but]{.underline} **[less sensitive to
increases]{.underline}**. By all appearances [we
would]{.underline} [still]{.underline} [have food]{.underline} [to
support civilization]{.underline}.85 **[Even if]{.underline}** [sea
levels]{.underline} **[rose hundreds of meters]{.underline}** (over
centuries), **[most]{.underline}** [of the
Earth's]{.underline} **[land]{.underline}** **[area]{.underline}** **[would
remain]{.underline}**. Similarly, while some areas might conceivably
become uninhabitable due to water scarcity, other [areas will have
increased rainfall]{.underline}. More areas may become susceptible to
tropical diseases, but we need only [look to the tropics to see
civilization flourish]{.underline} despite this. The main effect of a
collapse of the system of Atlantic Ocean currents that includes the Gulf
Stream is a 2°C cooling of Europe---something
that [poses]{.underline} **[no permanent threat]{.underline}** [to
global civilization.]{.underline}

[From an existential risk perspective]{.underline}, a more serious
concern is that the high temperatures (and the rapidity of their change)
might cause a large loss of biodiversity and subsequent ecosystem
collapse. While the pathway is not entirely clear, a large enough
collapse of ecosystems across the globe could perhaps threaten human
extinction. The idea that climate change could cause widespread
extinctions has some good theoretical support.86 Yet the **[evidence is
mixed]{.underline}**. For when we [look at many]{.underline} of
the [past cases
of]{.underline} [extremely]{.underline} **[high]{.underline}** [global]{.underline} [**temp**erature**s**]{.underline} **[or]{.underline}** [extremely]{.underline} **[rapid
warming]{.underline}** [we]{.underline} **[don't
see]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} [corresponding]{.underline} [**loss
of biod**iversity]{.underline}.87

\[FOOTNOTE\]

We don't see such biodiversity loss in the 12°C warmer climate of the
early Eocene, nor the rapid global change of the PETM, nor in rapid
regional changes of climate. Willis et al. (2010) state: "We argue that
although the underlying mechanisms responsible for these past changes in
climate were very different (i.e. natural processes rather than
anthropogenic), the rates and magnitude of climate change are similar to
those predicted for the future and therefore potentially relevant to
understanding future biotic response. What emerges from these past
records is evidence for rapid community turnover, migrations,
development of novel ecosystems and thresholds from one stable ecosystem
state to another, but [there is very]{.underline} [**little
ev**idence]{.underline} **[for]{.underline}** [broad-scale]{.underline} **[extinctions]{.underline}** [due
to]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [warming]{.underline} [world]{.underline}."
There are similar conclusions in Botkin et al. (2007), Dawson et al.
(2011), Hof et al. (2011) and Willis & MacDonald (2011). The best
evidence of warming causing extinction may be from the end-Permian mass
extinction, which may have been associated with large-scale warming (see
note 91 to this chapter).

\[END FOOTNOTE\]

So the most important known effect of climate change from the
perspective of direct existential risk is probably the most obvious:
heat stress. We need an environment cooler than our body temperature to
be able to rid ourselves of waste heat and stay alive. More precisely,
we need to be able to lose heat by sweating, which depends on the
humidity as well as the temperature.

A landmark paper by Steven Sherwood and Matthew Huber showed that with
sufficient warming there would be parts of the world whose temperature
and humidity combine to exceed the level where humans could survive
without air conditioning.88 With 12°C of warming, a very large land
area---where more than half of all people currently live and where much
of our food is grown---would exceed this level at some point during a
typical year. Sherwood and Huber suggest that such areas would be
uninhabitable. This may not quite be true (particularly if air
conditioning is possible during the hottest months), but their
habitability is at least in question.

However, **[substantial
regions]{.underline}** [would]{.underline} also **[remain
below]{.underline}** [this]{.underline} [threshold.]{.underline} **[Even
with]{.underline}** [an
extreme]{.underline} **[20°C]{.underline}** **[of
warming]{.underline}** [there would
be]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}** [coastal]{.underline} **[areas]{.underline}** [(and]{.underline} [some]{.underline} [elevated
regions]{.underline}) that [would have no days above the
temperature/humidity threshold]{.underline}.89 So [there
would]{.underline} [remain]{.underline} [large areas in which humanity
and]{.underline} [**civ**ilization]{.underline} **[could
continue]{.underline}**. A world with 20°C of warming would be an
unparalleled human and environmental tragedy, forcing mass migration and
perhaps starvation too. This is reason enough to do our utmost to
prevent anything like that from ever happening. However, our present
task is identifying existential risks to humanity and it is hard to see
how any realistic level of heat stress could pose such a risk. So the
runaway and moist greenhouse effects remain the only known mechanisms
through which climate change could directly cause our extinction or
irrevocable collapse.

This doesn't rule out unknown mechanisms. We are considering large
changes to the Earth that may even be unprecedented in size or speed. It
wouldn't be astonishing if that directly led to our permanent ruin. The
best argument against such unknown mechanisms is probably that the PETM
did not lead to a mass extinction, despite temperatures rapidly rising
about 5°C, to reach a level 14°C above pre-industrial temperatures.90
But this is tempered by the imprecision of paleoclimate data, the
sparsity of the fossil record, the smaller size of mammals at the time
(making them more heat-tolerant), and a reluctance to rely on a single
example. Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred
times faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
in which 96 percent of species went extinct.91 [In the end]{.underline},
we can say little more than that **[direct]{.underline}** **[existential
risk]{.underline}** [from climate
change]{.underline} **[appears]{.underline}** **[very
small]{.underline}**, but cannot yet be ruled out.

Overview

The Climate Act established a New York "Net Zero" target (85% reduction
in GHG emissions and 15% offset of emissions) by 2050. The [Climate
Leadership & Community Protection
Act](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2019/S6599) Section 1.
Legislative findings and declaration, subsection 3 defines the alleged
threat and goal: "Action undertaken by New York to reduce greenhouse
emissions will have an impact on global greenhouse gas emissions and the
rate of climate change." I have tried to argue against this point many
times, but I think Watts has provided a concise well-documented case
that the basic premise that New York can have an effect on the rate of
climate change is misplaced.

Is Climate Change Real?

Anthony Watts prepared the post addressing this question because he gets
asked this a lot. His response to the question shows that New York does
not need to rush to comply with the aspirational Climate Act schedule
and targets set by politicians during the always rushed and hectic New
York budget process. Watts provides a simple primer that makes five key
points. Note that all the bold passages in the following quotes were
highlighted by Watts.

1\. The Basics: Climate Does Change

His first point cuts to the nub of the problem. Climate change is real
and is always occurring. That makes it easy for everyone to have an
impression that the climate isn't what it used to be.

First, let's be clear --- climate change is real in the literal sense.
The Earth's climate has been changing for billions of years. We have
geological records showing periods that were much warmer (like the
Eocene, with crocodiles in the Arctic), and much colder (like the Ice
Ages that covered North America in glaciers).

Even more recently, we have the Holocene Climate Optimum, significantly
warmer than present day:

Watts explains that there is a nuance to the fact that the climate is
changing. Those **[nuances [are being ignored]{.mark}]{.underline}** as
he notes:

So, yes --- the climate changes, and it always has. **[[The debate isn't
about whether it changes, but why, how fast, and how
much]{.underline}]{.mark}** humans are influencing it today. The debate
is also about how accurately we are able to detect temperature change,
plus the overreliance on climate models to predict the future rather
than actual data.

2\. What the "Consensus" Says --- and Where It Falls Short

Folks like me who publicly **[[decry the claim of an existential
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** must confront the consensus argument he
describes.

The mainstream position (IPCC, NOAA, NASA, etc.) holds that recent
warming --- roughly 1.1°C since the late 1800s --- is largely due to
increased CO₂ from human activity, mainly fossil fuels.

But here's the rub: **[[this view is heavily dependent on [climate
models](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/12/06/climate-models-have-not-improved-in-50-years/),
which are [notoriously
uncertain](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2021/04/15/media-finally-notices-that-the-rcp-8-5-climate-model-is-over-hyped-science-fiction/).]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The fact that the extreme risks claimed are based on models is
frustrating because I know the limitations of model projections and they
never get mentioned in the mainstream coverage of climate change. The
only thing I would add to his remarks is that he could have included
many more issues.

As someone with a meteorology background, I can tell you models struggle
with [cloud feedbacks](https://wattsupwiththat.com/?s=cloud+feedbacks),
[ocean cycles](https://wattsupwiththat.com/?s=ocean+cycles), [solar
variability](https://wattsupwiththat.com/?s=solar+variability), and
regional forecasts --- all of which are crucial to understanding
climate.

When models are run [backward, they often fail to replicate past climate
variability
accurately](https://www.hoover.org/research/flawed-climate-models) ---
like the Medieval Warm Period or the Little Ice Age --- unless they're
tuned heavily. That calls into question their reliability for long-term
projections.

3\. Natural Variability: The Elephant in the Room

As Watts explains, natural variability is not understood well. I think
the thing to keep in mind is that this variability is driven in large
part by the patterns of the upper air steering currents like the jet
stream. The massive flooding due to Helene in western North Carolina was
caused by a rare weather pattern that stalled the storm in one place. A
similar pattern occurred in 1916 so today's level of CO2 and warming
were not the cause. Unfortunately, we don't know what caused that
pattern or if it was just normal variability. Watts describes the
variability of observed warming: A lot of warming in the 20th century
happened before CO₂ rose sharply post-WWII. For example: The warming
from 1910 to 1940 occurred with much lower CO₂ levels. Then there was a
cooling trend from the 1940s to 1970s, despite rising CO₂ emissions
during that time period. Clearly, natural factors --- like solar cycles,
ocean oscillations (PDO, AMO), volcanic activity, and cloud dynamics ---
are still in play and possibly underestimated in mainstream assessments.
Keep in mind that the consensus says that the recent warming was caused
by GHG emissions, but I don't see any big difference between that
warming and the previous one that was "natural". We know there are
natural factors in play but we don't understand them well enough to be
able to discern what the impact of the greenhouse effect is relative to
them. 4. The CO₂ Connection: Overstated? The second complicating factor
is that the greenhouse effect is real and increased CO2 in the
atmosphere should also increase warming. However, as Watts explains even
that fact is conditional on at least one factor rarely mentioned.
**[[CO₂ is a greenhouse gas,]{.underline}]{.mark}** no question. **[[But
its [effect on temperature is
logarithmic](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/35/13/JCLI-D-21-0275.1.xml)]{.underline}]{.mark}**
--- meaning, **[[the more]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[CO₂]{.underline}]{.mark}** you add, **[[the less warming you get per
unit]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The first 100 ppm has the biggest impact,
and we're well past that as seen in the figure below. Moreover,
satellite data from UAH and RSS shows a slower warming trend than
surface datasets like HadCRUT or GISS. That discrepancy raises questions
about [data
adjustments,](https://wattsupwiththat.com/?s=temperature+data+adjustments)
[urban heat island
effects,](https://wattsupwiththat.com/?s=urban+heat+island+effects) and
[instrument
biases.](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2025/02/04/changing-data-to-agree-with-the-narrative-the-sad-story-of-acorn-sat/)
I addressed a couple of warming trend issues in two recent articles
about measuring temperature trends
[here](https://pragmaticenvironmentalistofnewyork.blog/2024/12/27/measuring-global-temperature-trends/)
and
[here](https://pragmaticenvironmentalistofnewyork.blog/2025/03/31/temperature-trend-measurement-uncertainty/).
This primer just touches the surfaces of isues. 5. Are We in a Crisis?
Ultimately the only reason we are being forced to endure the insane
transition policies that defy physics, math, and economics is the
existential threat. Watts points out problems with that claim. Even if
we accept that humans are influencing climate, **[[the notion that we're
in an "existential crisis" is unproven]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Extreme
weather trends (hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts) **[[don't show clear
worsening patterns once you account for improved detection and
population growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** in vulnerable areas such as
coastal developments. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(**[[IPCC]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[agrees]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[suggesting a
"](https://wattsupwiththat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Page-90_-from-IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter12.pdf)**[[low
confidence]{.underline}]{.mark}**["](https://wattsupwiththat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Page-90_-from-IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter12.pdf)
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** [many current and future weather events
being affected by climate
change](https://wattsupwiththat.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Page-90_-from-IPCC_AR6_WGI_Chapter12.pdf).
**[[The "existential crisis"]{.underline}]{.mark}** view is heavily
dependent on climate model projections, which are [notoriously
uncertain](https://wattsupwiththat.com/?s=climate+models+uncertain) and
refuted by data. **[[Sea level is rising --- but at a [slow, linear
pace](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2024/08/26/the-modern-rate-of-sea-level-rise-is-not-even-close-veering-outside-the-range-of-natural-variability/)]{.underline}]{.mark}**

mm/year](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2024/08/26/the-modern-rate-of-sea-level-rise-is-not-even-close-veering-outside-the-range-of-natural-variability/).
That's [about 12 inches per
century](https://wattsupwiththat.com/climate_tv_video/sea-level-rise-a-measly-1-2-inches-every-decade/),
similar to what's been observed since before industrial CO₂ emissions.
Away from the bluster and hype in the **[[real-world evidence is
clear]{.underline}]{.mark}** that even if there is a potential for
massive impacts due to climate change, **[[the
pace]{.underline}]{.mark}** observed **[[is slow and not
accelerating]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That means that we have time to
consider and modify the politically motivated schedule of the New York
Climate Act.Bottom LineI cannot conclude this post any better than
Anthony Watts did in his bottom line. Yes, the climate is changing. It
always has. The idea that global climate must be unchanging is simply
wrongheaded. The real issue is how much of today's change is due to
human activity, how reliable our predictions are, and whether proposed
policy responses are justified --- or likely to do more harm than good.
At Watts Up With That, we've been pointing out for years that this
**[[issue is riddled with confirmation bias, model overconfidence, and
selective reporting]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is **[[no
justification for shutting down economies or reshaping
civilization]{.underline}]{.mark}** based on the incomplete science of
climate change. So yes, **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** is
real, but no, it's **[[not a crisis.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

speeds up the thawing of permafrost -- turns the aff**

say deepening Arctic snowpack drives greenhouse gas emissions,"

[https://www.nsf.gov/news/scientists-say-deepening-arctic-snowpack-drives]{.mark}

**[[Human-caused climate change is shortening the snow cover period in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But **[[according
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S. National Science Foundation-supported
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** led by Earth system scientists at
the University of California, Irvine, some parts of the Arctic are
getting **[[deeper snowpack]{.underline}]{.mark}** than normal, and that
deep snow is **[[driving the thawing of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
long-frozen **[[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}** carbon reserves.
That's **[[leading to increased emissions of greenhouse
gases]{.underline}]{.mark}** like carbon dioxide and methane.

\"It is the first long-term experiment where we directly measure the
mobilization of ancient carbon year-round to show that deeper snow has
the possibility to rather quickly mobilize carbon deep in the soil,\"
said Claudia Czimczik, lead author of the study, which appears in AGU
Advances. \"Unfortunately, it supports the notion that permafrost carbon
emissions will be contributing to already-rising atmospheric CO2
levels.\"

Fieldwork for the study took place at the International Tundra
Experiment (ITEX) at Toolik Field Station in Alaska, an experiment
started in 1994 by study co-lead author Jeff Welker of the University of
Alaska Anchorage. The original goal of the experiment, Welker explained,
was to understand how deeper snow would affect Arctic tundra ecosystems.

Over the last several years, the joint UCI and Alaska team conducted
fieldwork at the ITEX site and found that a common Arctic biome ---
tussock tundra --- had turned into a year-round source of ancient carbon
dioxide. This is a result of thawing permafrost buried under snow where
the snow has been three to four times deeper than the average long-term
snow depth since 1994.

When the research started, neither Welker\'s team nor climate scientists
thought that the **[[deeper snow]{.underline}]{.mark}** experimental
treatment would **[[lead to]{.underline}]{.mark}** such a **[[rapid
thawing of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[permafrost.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

\"These findings suggest that the stability of permafrost in Arctic
Alaska, and possibly globally, can respond rather rapidly to changes in
Arctic winter snow conditions, where winter can be up to eight months
long,\" said Welker. \"Winter climate feedbacks like this are a tundra
characteristic not previously recognized and fully appreciated.\"

The team\'s findings, Czimczik said, suggest that **[[even if humanity
stopped emitting planet-warming gases]{.underline}]{.mark}** like carbon
dioxide immediately, **[[emissions from Arctic sources would
continue]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

\"Long-term observations and experiments over decades such as those
conducted at the ITEX site help us detect and understand environmental
change,\" said Roberto Delgado, a program director in NSF\'s Office of
Polar Programs. \"The findings underscore the importance of snowpack
depth as a driver of carbon emissions from underlying thawing
permafrost.\"

work in academia or the private sector. [[His team has eliminated major

[from international climate]{.mark} [coop]{.mark}eration.]{.underline}
Advertisement That's not all. Trump's blitzkrieg on federal climate work
is only a start --- as his budget strategy calls for even deeper cuts in
the months and years ahead. That includes [[billions of dollars in cuts
to climate]{.mark} and weather [research at NOAA and
NASA]{.mark},]{.underline} widely considered two of the world's top
science agencies. All told, it's an unprecedented assault on humanity's
understanding of how global warming is transforming the planet,
scientists say. And they warn that [Trump's actions will blind the
United States]{.underline} and the world to the ways people are rapidly
heating the planet by burning fossil fuels. "They certainly are trying
to create lasting damage," said Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at
Texas A&M University. The White House has framed the moves as
cost-cutting measures designed to shrink the size of government[. [Trump
officials have said]{.underline}]{.mark} [too that a [retreat from
climate science is necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} as the
research underpins regulations that could hinder U.S. production of
fossil fuels --- a top goal of the administration. "Climate alarmism has
had a terrible impact on human lives and freedom," Energy Secretary
[[Chris Wright wrote
Thursday]{.underline}](https://x.com/SecretaryWright/status/1933257397658603780)
on the social media site X. "It belongs in the ash heap of history."

before joining the administration, added, "Hydrocarbons are and will
continue to be essential to improving the wealth, health, and lives of
all human beings." The White House echoed that sentiment in response to
questions that POLITICO's E&E News sent to NOAA, NASA and the Office of
Management and Budget. "The last Administration wasted billions on

which oversees climate negotiations[. [For U.S. climate science, each
week of the Trump administration seems to bring new
losses]{.mark}]{.underline}, by design. The [[National Science
Foundation's funding for climate research at universities has now
evaporated]{.mark}]{.underline} after severe Trump administration cuts.
Spacecraft in orbit that have cost billions of dollars to launch --- and
a fraction of the cost to maintain --- will be mothballed if they
monitor climate change, under Trump's budget proposal. NASA's Goddard
Institute for Space Studies, one of the world's leading space and
climate research labs, was kicked out of its longtime building. The
scientists who work there now face an uncertain future under a proposed
NASA budget that [[cuts science research nearly in
half]{.underline}](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/06/04/trump-budget-cuts-extinction-level-eventl-for-nasa-00384058).
"It's humiliating and it debilitates our standing in the world
community," said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at the University of
Pennsylvania and director of its Penn Center for Science, Sustainability
and the Media. [[Climate science at EPA]{.mark}, the CDC, and the
Interior, Agriculture and Energy departments [has been proposed for
elimination.]{.mark}]{.underline} That includes research that monitors
human harms from pollution, climatic conditions that can devastate
farmers' crops and the health risks of intense heat waves. Yet Russ
Vought --- who leads the White House OMB --- wants more. Vought is
attempting to strip away Congress' budget authority and its ability to
block some of the proposed cuts to climate science. Agencies such as
NOAA and NASA have been ordered by the White House to [[freeze billions
of
dollars]{.underline}](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/12/white-house-agency-funds-executive-power-00395545)
in funding --- including money that goes toward climate research ---
before Congress has a chance to act. And that's just a small sample of
the first wave of Trump climate attacks. "Despite the claims to the
contrary, this isn't being done to cut costs," Mann said. "It's being
done because climate science --- and simply measuring our climate ---
has proven inconvenient to certain special interests who hold sway today
in Washington." **'There will be a lot to rebuild'** Climate denialists,
including conservative politicians, foundations and think tanks that
oppose regulations, long have pined for a day when the U.S. government
stops providing clear evidence that global warming poses a threat to
America's economy, national security and way of life. With Trump, their
wishes are on the way to being granted. It's the culmination of decades
of funding from the oil, gas and coal industry to tear down climate
[science. [Weakening scientific research and creating long-term damage
is the goal]{.underline}]{.mark}, said Steve Milloy, who was part of
Trump's EPA transition team in his first term and has spent decades
trying to shatter federal climate science and regulations. "If Democrats
ever get back in power, there will be a lot to rebuild," he said. That
reconstruction likely will include pillars of the nation's climate
research infrastructure. Take, for example, the Mauna Loa Observatory in
Hawaii. Last month, it measured the highest level of atmospheric carbon
dioxide recorded in modern human history, at 430.2 parts per million.
For scientists, it's a troubling benchmark. [For [the Trump
administration, it may identify the observatory as another target for
cuts]{.underline}]{.mark} --- the facility is being considered for
closure, and its lease may be canceled. Other data streams are in danger
too. More than a dozen spacecraft or space-based instruments that
capture climate data are proposed to be shut down in the White House
spending plan. The Trump administration justifies cost-cutting measures
such as these by saying they're intended to stop waste, fraud and abuse.
But eliminating the functions of satellites already in orbit --- which
represent decades of work and billions of dollars in sunk-cost spending
--- makes neither financial nor scientific sense, said Rick Spinrad, who
served as NOAA chief during the Biden administration. "So many of the
observations that are made in support of understanding climate are also
being made to support the more immediate weather and ocean
applications," he said. "To say 'there's the word climate, shut that
down' means the same satellite isn't available to give you an improved
four to five day forecast on hurricane landfall." And it's not just that
valuable data would be lost --- whatever federal research remains will
be sidelined and blocked from informing government policy and procedure.
Last month, Trump issued an executive order on a new "gold standard" for
scientific research that effectively blocks much of the science on
greenhouse gas emissions, human health harms from pollution and
environmental degradation from being used by federal agencies. As part
of that process, political appointees would effectively determine which
scientific research can be used by the federal government. In effect,
the moves would blind the country to the consequences of the
administration's actions to cut pollution regulations and increase the
country's reliance on fossil fuels while making it harder to build out
clean energy, Texas A&M's Dessler said. "They hate science because it
leads to regulation, so they want to do everything they can to stop
science from being used to regulate," he said. The plan to eradicate
climate science throughout the government is reminiscent of the way
Trump and his officials attacked Covid data collection, which clearly
showed cases and death rates rising in his first term, said Spinrad, the
former NOAA administrator. "The Trump administration said we can reduce
the number of cases by not testing anymore," Spinrad said. "[That's
[what is going on here.]{.mark} '[We can reduce the impact]{.mark} of
climate change [by not monitoring anymore]{.mark}.]{.underline}' That's
what they're saying, which is [just **[totally
incomprehensible."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In her address, McNutt presented a flurry of figures that indicated a
slump in American science. **[The U.S. has a declining share of the most
cited science papers]{.underline}**, for instance, **[and the rate at
which new drugs and technologies hit the market has flatlined over the
past several decades. The [U.S]{.mark}. still [spends the most money out
of any other country on r]{.mark}esearch [and]{.mark}
[d]{.mark}evelopment, [but China is set to soon outpace those
investments]{.mark}. China currently files more patents than the U.S.
and hosts more than a quarter of the world's clinical trials, as
compared to only 3 percent]{.underline}** in 2013. **["U.S. science is
perceived to be---and is---losing the race for global STEM
leadership,"]{.underline}** McNutt said. A country's strength in
science, she argued, shapes its defense capacities as well as its
ability to spread its values abroad. McNutt suggested that the country's
failure to innovate and stay ahead ran counter to its history. In the
decades after World War II, the U.S. achieved widespread excellence in
the sciences by investing heavily in both basic and applied research and
soliciting foreign talent. Landmark institutions such as the National
Science Foundation and NASA emerged during this period, as did the
country's pattern of dominating the Nobel Prizes. Then, **[[as federal
investment dipped in]{.mark} the [1980s]{.mark}, the [scientific
landscape grew more complex and difficult to coordinate]{.mark}.
Companies and philanthropies began funding and conducting greater
portions of research and development]{.underline}**. This shift affected
which scientific questions were addressed, how they got answered and
what forms of knowledge entered the public arena. The **[[private sector
tends to]{.underline}]{.mark}** pursue narrower, applied interests,
McNutt explained, and to **[[keep its findings to
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When companies take over entire
fields---as they did with genetically modified organisms and are
currently doing with artificial intelligence---**[research sometimes
rushes ahead in a way that increases the public's distrust of science
and technology]{.underline}**, she noted. Public math and science
proficiency fell during the 1980s as well, bringing fewer Americans into
the STEM workforce. McNutt followed her recitation of problems with
**[[suggested solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, describing what a
revitalized scientific landscape might require. She **[[did not call for
more government investment but instead focused on boosting the public's
support for research]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and greater public
involvement---as well as making the most out of existing science
funding. Of utmost importance, McNutt emphasized, was improving K--12
STEM education. **[By international standards, American students perform
in the middle of the range in science; they are below average in
math]{.underline}**. She noted that [**foreign-born individuals play a
key role in maintaining U.S. STEM prowess**, accounting for 19 percent
of the nation's STEM workforce and 43 percent of its STEM Ph.D.
population]{.underline}. **[This is a cause for concern]{.underline}**,
McNutt said, **[because as other nations rise in the ranks, the U.S.
will need to compete with them for talent.]{.underline}**

# Conflict Adv

## Inherency

### No Inherency\-\--Russia/China Coop

#### No Russia/China Arctic cooperation or expansion---it's [symbolic]{.underline}.

**Hansen '24** \[Birgitte Annie; September 20, 2024. US Climate
Researcher and Tech Journalist. "'The Cooperation between Russia and
China in the Arctic Is Still Limited.'" High North News.
https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/cooperation-between-russia-and-china-arctic-still-limited;
mgm\]

[[The Arctic is **not a Chinese priority**]{.underline}]{.mark}

The researchers write that China has shown increased interest in the
Arctic in the last decades compared to earlier, particularly after
establishing a Chinese-Russian research center in 2018.

High North News recently reported that polar researchers from China are
exploring cooperation with Russia on Svalbard.

Yet, despite this increased interest, the [**researchers** believe that
the Arctic is not a **priority for China**]{.underline}. They believe
the Chinese interest in the Arctic is mainly linked to their status as
an important global actor and to research.

\"[Chinese investments in the Arctic]{.underline} are best described as
**[[intentions rather than practice]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as there are
[[**few** **examples** of **actual**]{.mark}**ly conducted
[projects]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" the article reads.

In a comment to High North News, the researchers elaborate:

\"The Arctic is far away. [[China]{.mark} is a big country with [many
challenges **internally**]{.mark}]{.underline} and in their own
immediate areas -- all [highly **[prioritized over the
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time, it is clear that China
is trying to involve itself in the Arctic where there are possibilities,
but that is different from saying that the Arctic is a priority.\"

[Russia\'s warfare in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} is making [the
country [increasingly]{.mark} **more [isolated]{.mark},**]{.underline}
and China, therefore, emerges as the best cooperation partner for
Russia. However, this [**[does not mean]{.mark}** that [China]{.mark} is
fully [committed to cooperation]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline},
according to the researchers.

\"Contrarily, Chinese researchers also find clear arguments against
increased economic cooperation, particularly due to the high economic
risk linked to investments in Arctic oil and gas developments. In
addition, [[Chinese]{.mark} [companies]{.mark} are [**skeptical** of
**investing** because of]{.mark} the risk of becoming subject to
**secondary [sanctions]{.mark}**,]{.underline} which would impact
countries cooperating [with sanctioned countries such as
Russia.]{.underline}

The researchers also refer to the Chinese academic debate on security
cooperation in the Arctic:

\"Military and security matters are of secondary significance.\"

[[Chinese **researchers** promote a **cautious** **approach** to the
**Russian Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the Arctic is far more
important to Russia than China. The Arctic is of great strategic value
to Russia but [**[less significant]{.mark}** to China [than]{.mark}
[other]{.mark} foreign policy [areas]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Symbolic politics

The two senior researchers believe that future [[cooperation between
**Russia** and **China**]{.mark} in the Arctic will be **even further
[characterized]{.mark}** [by **symbolic politics**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and base itself on declarations of intent to a higher degree than actual
deeper cooperation.

[[Both parties **hold back** on]{.mark} **developing** deeper
**[cooperation]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}. [[For
China]{.mark}, the [Arctic]{.mark} is **[not high]{.mark} enough** on
its list of [priorities]{.mark}, and it is **[not worth]{.mark} any
possible [reactions]{.mark} from the US.**]{.underline}

On Russia\'s part, it is due to a desire to maintain sovereign
self-determination in a region that is very important to them. This is
particularly about the increasing power imbalance between the two
states, in China\'s favor, and [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**not
wanting** interference]{.underline} [from]{.underline}]{.mark} [such a
**[geopolitical heavyweight]{.mark}**]{.underline}, according to the
researchers.

A [**new** report from **Harvard**]{.underline} University's [Belfer
Center]{.underline} and Trent University [**challenges** the
**widespread belief** that China is aggressively buying up the Arctic,
calling many headline figures **misleading** and based on
**unfulfilled** or **canceled deals.**]{.underline}

Titled Cutting Through Narratives on Chinese Arctic Investments, the
study finds that [claims of China investing]{.underline} \$90 billion in
the region [are **significantly exaggerated**]{.underline}. [Most of
that number reflects **proposed** or **shelved** **projects**, not
**completed transactions**]{.underline}**.**

"[China's actual footprint in the Arctic is **far more
limited**]{.underline} than many believe," said co-author P. Whitney
Lackenbauer, a professor at Trent University. "[There's a **major g**ap
between what's **discussed publicly** and what's actually **happening on
the ground."**]{.underline}

[Strategic ties with Russia]{.underline}

Much of China's Arctic activity has focused on partnerships with Russia,
particularly in liquefied natural gas (LNG), port infrastructure, and
shipping routes. These collaborations have taken on new urgency as
Russia seeks alternatives to Western capital amid ongoing sanctions.

Still, the report notes that many [joint projects **remain
stalled,**]{.underline} and that [China's investments have not **come
close to** **reshaping** the Arctic economy.]{.underline}

mgm\]

The United States Department of Defense
(**[[DoD]{.underline}]{.mark}**)'s [2024 **[Arctic strategy]{.mark}**
confirms that an [**unhealthy obsession** with **China**]{.mark} has now
[clouded **Washington's judgment**]{.mark}]{.underline} and blinded this
stumbling superpower (one could now justifiably call it a stupidpower,
reminiscent of the Soviet Union just before its inevitable collapse),
not the first time American strategy has been rooted in a dangerous
delusion.

Indeed, this was more than evident during its tragic, two-decade-long
Vietnam intervention fueled by its tragically self-fulfilling Domino
Theory, as it was again during its tragic, two-decade-long intervention
in Afghanistan in the comparably self-defeating Global War on Terror.

[We are creeping dangerously close to a [new]{.mark} era of
[McCarthyism]{.mark}]{.underline} [[at]{.underline}]{.mark} so many
[**[U.S.]{.mark} [Government]{.mark}**-**funded** centers of [Arctic
study]{.mark}]{.underline} and policy.

Breaking with previous Arctic strategies, DoD's 2024 strategy elevates
non-Arctic China (with not a single square millimeter of Arctic
territory or a cubic milliliter of Arctic waters under its flag) to the
top of the Pentagon's list of Arctic anxieties, above even mighty
Russia, the largest (by territory, population and economic output) if
not nimblest of the Arctic states, with undisputed sovereign control
over more than half the Arctic region.

China's Arctic Involvement: More Norm Than Threat

In its strategy, the [Pentagon neglects to mention that China's
increasing Arctic ambitions are in **lockstep with**]{.underline}---and
therefore mirror---those of numerous other [non-Arctic states
that,]{.underline} like China, [hold observer status at the Arctic
Council.]{.underline}

Beijing's Arctic presence actually dates back to the interwar years of
the early 20th century, as demonstrated by its status as a signatory to
the Spitzbergen Treaty, which internationalized access to Svalbard's
economy---part of a polar global commons embraced by many nations, not
just China, and including numerous Western states.

Moreover, [[China's "**dual** **civil-military**]{.mark}" efforts in
Arctic research -- with which **DoD is so concerned** --
[mirrors]{.mark} that of the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} all of its Arctic and non-Arctic
[partners]{.mark}]{.underline}, who until recently worked together to
span old East-West divisions in the Arctic and for whom [[dual-use is a
**fact of life for Arctic research**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} with
government funding and policy priorities having a profound (and at times
ethically corrosive) effect on Arctic research worldwide.

But in fact, [[dual use]{.mark} Arctic research is much [more]{.mark} a
**[norm]{.mark} [than]{.mark} a [subversion]{.mark} of
norms**,]{.underline} despite the disingenuous protests by an army of
DoD-funded scholars to the contrary.

Ideological Echo Chambers in U.S. Polar Research

For instance, consider these public comments made by a high official of
the now shuttered Wilson Center Polar Institute, which was (rightly)
closed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in early 2025,
who described to NPR's Jackie Northam in August 2024:

"I think we see the PRC attempting to undermine regional governance and
to increasingly advance this narrative that non-Arctic states should
have influence in the region. So I think that is something where we do
see the PRC influencing the governance conversation in a way that is
contrary to U.S. interests ... China sends its research ice breakers to
the Arctic every year ostensibly to collect climate data. But, of
course, they're also collecting, you know, intelligence data and mapping
submarine cables and all that kind of thing because, you know,
everything they do is dual use."

Such [[wording is offensive]{.mark} in its [**generalization** and
**trope-like characteristics**]{.mark} of the world's most populous and
economically consequential nation:]{.underline} [[Everything]{.mark}
they do [is]{.mark} [dual use.]{.mark} Such **anti-[China bias runs
deep]{.mark}** [throughout]{.mark} the **[American polar research
community]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and since NATO's northward expansion
to Sweden and Finland has been spreading like a zombie virus across
Europe, with an [[**increasingly corrosive impact** on]{.mark} the
objectivity and **integrity** of **[Arctic strategy]{.mark}** across the
expanded NATO family of nations.]{.underline}

Indeed, it's become so pervasive that one of the three guest editors of
the 17th Yearbook of Polar Law (YPL17) shared with me a particularly
biased peer review from one of their "expert" reviewers specializing in
Arctic and Antarctic law, who rejected a submission from Latin America
that would have provided a much needed Global South perspective in a
field long dominated by North American and Nordic scholars, one that
looked more kindly upon China and Russia in the Arctic than this
particular anonymous expert.

[**[Silencing]{.mark}** the **[Global South]{.mark} in Peer
Review**]{.underline}

One reason for this peer reviewer's rejection of this rare and
much-needed submission from the Global South was the reviewer's
dismissal of the authors' Global South foundation of knowledge and their
refreshingly (in my view) positive sentiment regarding China's and
Russia's commitment to Arctic cooperation,
[[trivializing]{.underline}]{.mark} and thereby arrogantly
[**[delegitimizing]{.mark}** their **undeniably valid
[perspective]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

This expert reviewer illogically dismisses the authors' argument that
[[China's and Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} impressively high "ranking
of engagement metrics" in [[Arctic cooperation]{.mark} can]{.underline}
[[serve]{.underline}]{.mark} as a proxy for Beijing's and Moscow's
"commitment to [**international [cooperation]{.mark}** [and **polar
sustainability**]{.mark}]{.underline}**."**

To me, this seems a most reasonable argument---yet one that appears to
grate against the hypersensitivities of those funded by, or otherwise
associated with, tentacles of the American government such as the now
(mercifully) shuttered Wilson Center Polar Institute and the greatly
(and justly, in my view) right-sized Fulbright Research Program.

For years, these [**[programs]{.mark}** have **[recklessly
funneled]{.mark}** American **taxpayers'** hard-earned [dollars into
**expensive, globe-trotting junkets**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} already
**[well-paid academics]{.mark}**, while **[grooming]{.mark}** in them [a
**toxic** and **addictive ideological bias**]{.mark}]{.underline}---one
that favors a narrow set of interests cultivated by Washington policy
elites more concerned with expanding crony networks and securing
generous public salaries than with serving the American people or
advancing world peace.

As the anonymous reviewer scolds: "I don't see how a counting or
'ranking of engagement metrics' is a proxy for 'commitment to
international cooperation and polar sustainability'. Russia and China
are ranking high on these but aren't both of them currently spoiling and
obstructing polar multilateralism?"

The reviewer seems to miss the point -- or, more nefariously, reveals a
disturbing neo-McCarthyist censorship of the sort that festers unchecked
in the ideologically corrupted anonymous peer review process favored by
western research and publishing institutions that [[**perpetuate**
**ideological falsehoods**]{.mark} that [serve]{.mark} their cronies'
personal interests and their **[political masters' propaganda]{.mark}

09-06-2024, {DOA 6-28-2025 \|\| kibby}

First, considering the size of South Korea's economy, it is unlikely
that Japan would revert to some level of financial and technological
support for South Korea's security in the near future. This type of
contribution occurred primarily during Phase III, when South Korea
required significant funding for full-fledged industrialization in the
1970s and the development of social infrastructure in the 1980s, during
a time when other foreign funding sources, particularly from the United
States, were inadequate. However, given South Korea's current economic
status, this type of cooperation is simply not necessary anymore.
Second, the current level of logistical and operational support is
likely to persist indefinitely, regardless of political regime changes
in Tokyo or Seoul, due to irreversible structural developments. Since no
all-out war similar to the Korean War has occurred since the 1953 Korean
Armistice, the extent of Japan's potential contribution in such a
scenario remains uncertain. However[, it is clear that **[Japan
has]{.mark} significantly enhanced and [expanded its capacity to
support]{.mark}** US forces operationally **[in a Korean
contingency]{.mark}, largely due to the 2015 security legislation.\[6\]
This legislation marked a shift from Japan's previous policy of acting
solely in self-defense, [allowing the JSDF to engage in foreign
conflicts]{.mark}. It is also evident that [Japan would take every
measure to protect]{.mark} US [bases]{.mark} within its territory in
accordance with Operation Plan 5055, which is [crucial in the initial
phase of a Korean contingency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. During this phase,
[US forces stationed in Japan would be deployed from these bases to the
Korean Peninsula before the main reinforcements arrived from the US
mainland. **Many [Japanese defense experts and officials]{.mark} I have
interviewed [believe]{.mark} that [if a]{.mark} full-scale [war were to
erupt on the Korean Peninsula, Japan would]{.mark} likely [provide
logistical and operational support]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the US, at
least equivalent to what was provided during the Korean War period.
Recommendations Given these factors, challenges to sustaining or even
enhancing ROK-Japan security relations on a longer-term basis exist. In
this context, two policy recommendations emerge. Policy Recommendation
Number One: South Korea and Japan should establish a Military Committee
Meeting (MCM)-like mechanism to discuss the extent of logistical and
operational support Japan could offer in the event of a Korean
contingency, such as the allocation of North Korean ground targets.\[7\]
To be sure, such a bilateral mechanism should operate within the
framework of the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework. After
discussions with both South Korean and Japanese defense officials, there
will predictably be issues where the two sides do not see eye to eye.
For instance, in the case of a North Korean invasion of South Korea, the
South Korean military firmly rejects any potential deployment of the
Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force to the Korean Peninsula for any
reason. However, the Japanese side has indicated that the Self-Defense
Forces might be deployed to evacuate Japanese citizens from major South
Korean cities and that Japan could exercise its right to self-defense if
attacked by North Korean forces while carrying out evacuations within
South Korean territory.\[8\] Another point of disagreement is likely to
be around the potential circumstances under which Japan might use its
recently adopted (2022) "counterstrike capability." Some South Korean
and Japanese security experts believe in integrating Japan's enhanced
capabilities with South Korea's three-axis system, although numerous
challenges must be addressed to do so, including matters of sharing
target information and allocating targets. Prioritizing these issues
should be a key focus of future South Korea-Japan security cooperation,
with discussions occurring regularly rather than sporadically. To
address the concerns mentioned above (such as the potential deployment
of the JSDF on the Korean Peninsula and the alignment of Japan's enemy
base strike capability with South Korea's three-axis system) in greater
detail, [South Korea and Japan should review their respective
contingency plans (South Korea's OPLAN 5015 and Japan's OPLAN 5055) and
discuss the aspects that may involve both countries using the MCM-like
mechanism]{.underline}. Policy Recommendation Number Two: The US, South
Korea and Japan should develop a coordinated plan to address a potential
two-front war scenario. **[[As tensions have risen in]{.mark} the
[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait in recent years, the US and [Japan]{.mark} have
[engaged in]{.mark} detailed [discussions about their potential
responses to a Taiwan contingency]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The nature of
these responses could vary, depending on the extent of China's military
actions towards Taiwan. [However, South Korean defense experts have
expressed concerns that such a scenario could diminish the capabilities
of US Forces Japan and Japan itself in responding to a crisis on the
Korean Peninsula. **They worry that [if Kim Jong Un views the situation
in Taiwan as an opportunity, he might initiate military provocations on
the Korean Peninsula]{.mark}.** In this kind of multi-front scenario,
many South Koreans believe that the US and Japan might be unable to
assist South Korea as their resources could be maxed out defending
Taiwan]{.underline}. In such a case, while Operation Plan 5015
(detailing actions by US Forces Korea and South Korean forces in a
Korean contingency) would be activated, Operation Plan 5055 (outlining
the response of US Forces Japan and Japan in a Korean contingency) might
not be fully implementable due to the diversion of resources to Taiwan.
One Japanese SDF official explained in an interview, for instance, that
in a scenario involving conflicts on two fronts, Japan would likely be
preoccupied with protecting Taiwan, deploying most of its available
aircraft and naval vessels there, except those needed for the defense of
Japan, since securing the Taiwan Strait is a top priority for Japan.
Although the likelihood of such a critical two-front war scenario is not
high**[, [it is imperative]{.mark} that the United States, [South Korea
and Japan devise measures that could deter Kim Jong Un]{.mark} from
misjudging the potential for North Korean success in such a
situation]{.underline}**. These include: 1) reaffirming that OPLAN 5015
will be fully implemented under any circumstances if North Korea decides
to invade South Korea; 2) ensuring that nuclear decoupling among the
United States, South Korea and Japan will not occur; and 3) confirming
that the US extended nuclear deterrence remains intact.

### Turn\-\--Arctic Science Bad

#### Turn: scientific research is [securitizing]{.underline}.

Administration, PhD "Securitization of Scientific Cooperation: The Case
of the Arctic." Polish Polar Research 46 (1): 5--5.

However, international [scientific cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline} has [never]{.underline} been entirely [free from
**political influence**]{.underline}**.** The intensity of the
[politicisation of Arctic scientific cooperation]{.underline} has
[increased]{.underline} particularly during periods of change, tension,
or shifts in international politics, both in cases directly concerning
the Far North and in those occurring in other, often geographically
distant, parts of the world. [This is the **situation** **we are
currently facing**]{.underline}. The tensions and geopolitical shift
caused by the Russian Federation's aggression against Ukraine and the
Sino-American rivalry are phenomena generating a [growing sense of
**uncertainty** and the **rapid** **bifurcation** of international
relations]{.underline}. Other factors include technological
advancements, such as in the field of artificial intelligence, as well
as the economic and political consequences of climate change.

Despite the strong cooperative component of Arctic scientific
cooperation, which is linked to solidarity around **[research
objectives]{.underline}**, it is [not devoid of a **competitive
dimension**]{.underline}, which [stems from the nature of the research
sector in every state]{.underline}. [Stakeholders]{.underline} involved
in scientific and innovative activities [**compete** for **research
funding**, **rankings** **evaluating** scientific **excellence**,
**innovation**, and the applicability of research]{.underline}. This
rivalry [extends to the **transnational** **level**]{.underline}, where
[**researchers compete for** grants, access to scientific
infrastructure]{.underline}, and [opportunities to publish]{.underline}
in the most prestigious academic journals.

This is not the only level where competition is observed. **[Science
policy,]{.underline}** including its external dimension, is a
[significant field of activity for states]{.underline}, as well as
nonstate actors such as international organisations, enterprises, and
other non-state entities. There has long been a consensus that knowledge
is a resource and a source of both advantage and power. This is
particularly evident in the science-technology-innovation sector. [In a
context of **geopolitical tensions** and security threats at both the
international and national levels, all these factors acquire new
**significance** and undergo **redefinition**, involving their
**politicisation** and]{.underline}, in many areas,
[**securitisation**.]{.underline}

#### Turn: Arctic science makes conflict [worse]{.underline}. \[SD = science diplomacy\]

President's Research Group at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center and

[Although]{.underline} the claim that [**science** plays a **significant
role** in the **Arctic**]{.underline} seems well founded, [the
activities]{.underline} designated as Arctic SD can[not]{.underline} be
subsumed under a uniform manifestation of [a **well-defined
concept**.]{.underline} The above examples represent a patchwork of
[diverse activities with a scie**ntific component**]{.underline}.
Differences include, for example, the characteristics and interests of
the actors involved, the institutional frameworks, time horizons and
forms of financing. We argue that existing and frequently used
taxonomies of SD are [**insufficient** to fully understand the nuanced
**roles** of **science** in **Arctic policy**.]{.underline}

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: First, we briefly
reconstruct the development of the original SD taxonomy by the Royal
Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) and the critical discourse following its publication to show the
strengths and weaknesses of existing scholarship. Subsequently, we
develop an enhanced, ideal-type framework for the categorisation of SD
activities. Second, we put the enhanced framework to the test by (a)
analysing statements from national **[Arctic strategies]{.underline}**
[on the uses of **science** as a **tool in international
relations**]{.underline} and (b) by situating two of the most common
examples of Arctic SD in the conceptual framework. Finally, we discuss
how our enhanced taxonomy provides an added value to scholars and
practitioners.

The meaning and evolution of SD

A very short history of the term

SD, broadly speaking all activities at the intersection of science and
foreign policy (Ruffini, 2017, p. 17), has only recently found its way
into the field of International Relations as an explicit point of
reference. Though scholars such as Skolnikoff (1967) have examined
activities which would now be labelled SD as early as in the 1960s, it
was not until the first decade of the 21st century that the term SD
started to gain currency (Ruffini, 2020a, p. 2). SD has ranked
particularly high on the agenda of US-based actors who were among the
first to promote it as a foreign policy instrument (Fedoroff, 2009).

Key to the popularisation of SD, particularly in Europe and beyond, was
a meeting sponsored by AAAS and the Royal Society in 2009 (Gluckman,
Turekian, Grimes, & Kishi, 2017, p. 1). An important outcome of this
gathering was the definition of SD as"a still fluid concept" applicable
to the role of science, technology and innovation in three dimensions of
policy (Royal Society & AAAS, 2010, p. v). These dimensions are: •
Science in Diplomacy (SiD): Informing foreign policy objectives with
scientific advice; • Diplomacy for Science (D4S): Facilitating
international scientific cooperation via diplomacy; • Science for
Diplomacy (S4D): Using science cooperation to improve international
relations between countries.

On the European level, then Commissioner for Research, Science and
Innovation, Carlos Moedas, put SD on the policy agenda (Moedas, 2016).
Agencies like the European External Action Service embraced it "to
develop and maintain links of all kinds" with states like Iran (European
External Action Service, n.d.).

On a national level, SD is often promoted as a policy tool by the
responsible ministries and incorporated into broader
internationalisation strategies of major research institutes or national
academies. For example, both Germany and France took up the notion of SD
and issued strategy papers on the topic. Spain, the US and the UK have
further established SD networks within their embassies to foster closer
relations with their respective host countries based on cooperation in
science and technology (Krasnyak, 2018, p. 46; Moreno et al., 2017).
BRICS countries were latecomers to the SD buzz. India's Department of
Science and Technology, for example, only funded a major SD initiative
in 2018 (Sabzalieva, Sá, Martinez, & Kachynska, 2021, p. 6).

On a local level, finally, institutionalised SD initiatives are rare.
One example of a local SD initiative is the public--private
Barcelona-based SciTech Diplo Hub, which sees itself "in charge of
deploying Barcelona's science diplomacy" (Roig, Sun-Wang, &
Manfredi-Sánchez, 2020, p. 4).

Towards a more nuanced understanding of SD

[Until recently, a **predominantly positive** image of SD has prevailed
among scholars and practitioners]{.underline}. Both groups have [touted
SD as a **panacea** for most grand challenges of our time.]{.underline}
These accounts have largely made use of the Royal Society--AAAS
taxonomy. While the definition has thus come to be widely used, it has
not remained unchallenged. In the following, we summarise three main
strands of criticism it has been exposed to.

The main argument voiced in the first strand is that the Royal
Society--AAAS taxonomy needs further refinement. Professional scientific
advisors, such as Gluckman et al. (2017), point out that the original SD
definition has been useful for academic and theoretical discussions, but
fails to capture the wide range of SD practices in everyday politics
(Gluckman et al., 2017, p. 2; see also Berkman, 2019). In contrast to
the means-ends relations proposed by the Royal Society and AAAS,
Gluckman et al. suggest to factor in the different levels that SD
initiatives can be targeted at. This includes the national level, where
SD activities aim to advance a country's national agenda, the regional
or bilateral level when cross-border interests are at stake, and
finally, the global level whenever the target is to tackle worldwide
challenges and national interests align rather than clash. In a similar
vein, Krasnyak (2018, p. 38) proposes to add "SD for global governance"
as an additional category to the Royal Society--AAAS taxonomy. These
accounts primarily address interactions from the state level upwards.
The implementation of SD policies on the ground, however, does not
always have to be fully in line with national interests. Analysing the
interactions of member states of the EU with regard to SD, Rüffin (2020)
found that local SD initiatives are sometimes only loosely coupled to
overarching national SD policies. This illustrates that SD activities at
the local, national, regional and global levels are intertwined in
complex and multidirectional ways (Berkman, 2019).

A second strand [rejects **the** **notion** of SD as a **genuinely
benevolent factor** in **politics**]{.underline}. Gluckman et al.
(2017), for instance, were among the first to underline that [**SD**
**activities**]{.underline} also [bear **potential for
conflict**]{.underline}. They point to the [**frictions** that can arise
from **diverging interests** between national SD advocates]{.underline}.
Their findings resonate with newer scholarly contributions that call for
a more nuanced understanding of SD. Rungius and Flink (2020), for
example, [**doubt** that **science** can always "act as a **unifying
point** of **orientation deliberately** opposing **competing national
interests**]{.underline}" (p. 5). They [question]{.underline} one of the
main [assumptions]{.underline} of SD proponents, namely that
"[**political conflicts** can be settled on the grounds of **scientific
values** and **principles**]{.underline}" (Rungius & Flink, 2020, p. 5).
Like other scholars, they believe that this
"**[romanticised]{.underline}**" **[image]{.underline}** of SD is used
by SD advocates to [perpetuate a **seemingly positive legacy** of the
concept based on a small **number of historical examples**]{.underline}
(Flink, 2020, p. 365; Flink & Rüffin, 2019; Turchetti, Adamson, Rispoli,
Olšáková, & Robinson, 2020).

contrasts the 2015--2021 period. During those years, Russian aviation
simulated offensive strikes against military headquarters and
intelligence installations in Norway and harassed NATO Maritime Groups
outside the Lofoten Islands. Correspondingly, U.S. and allied forces
performed extraordinary operations deep into the Barents Sea where the
Northern Fleet has its nuclear second-strike capability. Even a carrier
strike group (CSG) was deployed north of the Arctic Circle for the first
time since the Cold War. [But as Russia invaded Europe's second largest

[China]{.underline} seeks to advance its national interests [in the
Arctic]{.underline} through many, diverse economic, [**scientific**, and
information activities]{.underline}. The largest number of activities
takes place [in the Russian Arctic]{.underline}; other Arctic nations
often push back against, or welcome with much caution, Chinese
investments and presence. [According to our analysis of China's
activities]{.underline} in the region across the five categories, [we
found **the following:**]{.underline}

• The [risks of confrontation with China **related** to or as a
**consequence** of these **activities** are **rare**]{.underline},
[except for]{.underline} the following [two]{.underline} [cases,
**neither of which pose immediate threats:**]{.underline}

\- the potential future presence of Chinese ocean-going ships that have
engaged in aggressive behavior in other regions of the world

-Chinese spoofing or deception of military global positioning system
assets using the electromagnetic spectrum.

• The [risks of financial dependence and political leverage are
**limited**]{.underline} among all states with interests in the Arctic
except for Russia because of the sheer size of China's investments in
the Russian Arctic.

• Data and information transmission activities present the clearest
risks, having the potential to allow for intelligence collection,
military applications, or threats to critical infrastructure. Some
access-related activities also present risks. However, most of these
[**activities** would present a risk to the United States and its Arctic
allies **only if they were to reverse some** of **their restrictive
policies** that **limit** **Chinese** inroads in these

### No!\-\--Russia War

#### No nuclear retaliation---it's a [bluff]{.underline}. Numerous checks.

Bluster: Why Putin Revised Russia's Nuclear Doctrine." European
Leadership Network.
https://europeanleadershipnetwork.org/commentary/bluff-and-bluster-why-putin-revised-russias-nuclear-doctrine;
mgm\]

What's pushed Putin to implement these changes and, in so doing, lower
the nuclear threshold? In a nutshell, it's a consequence of the
cautionary tale of "**[the boy who cried wolf]{.underline}**" --- in
this case, [Putin's **overreliance** on the use of nuclear threats to
induce Western caution]{.underline} --- with the West's knack for
strategically sidestepping Russia's red lines in Ukraine.

Since the outbreak of the war, [Putin's repeated **nuclear
sabre-rattling** demonstrates **bluff** and **bluster**]{.underline},
and the [Western powers have shown they can **carefully** **walk**
**the** line **without crossing** it,]{.underline} at least in Moscow's
eyes. Although the US initially took Putin's nuclear threats seriously
--- "this is not a bluff" --- Putin' use of nuclear intimidation has
received mixed results. The West has managed a delicate balancing act by
combining various initiatives ranging from communication with Russia via
intelligence channels, providing targeted economic aid, and supplying
Kyiv with increasingly advanced weaponry, such as the Anglo-French Storm
Shadow cruise missile for Russian targets within Ukraine, and F-16
fighter jets.

This approach creates a core challenge for Putin; while [**Russia's
nuclear deterrent prevents** direct **NATO involvement**]{.underline},
it doesn't stop the West from operating just below this threshold.
Through these calibrated moves, Western allies continually test Russia's
red lines, gradually eroding the credibility and effectiveness of
Moscow's deterrence without triggering a direct confrontation. This slow
but steady erosion of red lines by the West places Russia in a difficult
position, as each step subtly undercuts its strategic leverage over
Ukraine and undermines the effectiveness of its deterrent.

But what does Russia's revised nuclear doctrine and the looming threat
of escalation reveal about how Putin views nuclear weapons? During the
Cold War, the leaders of the US and Russia mostly held the view that
nuclear weapons offered no real political or military edge against an
adversary with secure second-strike capabilities. Beginning with the
outbreak of the war, Putin shifted this paradigm by wielding nuclear
weapons as tools of coercion, aiming to manipulate shared nuclear risks
for intimidation and political leverage. In his view, nuclear threats
serve as instruments of deterrence and psychological warfare, calculated
to pressure opponents while avoiding outright use.

Although [Putin's nuclear threats]{.underline} have influenced the
timing and nature of Western support for Ukraine, they [have not
**fundamentally** **reshaped** Western policies]{.underline} or deterred
the ongoing expansion of aid. Instead, they [underscore the limitations
of nuclear coercion]{.underline} as a tool for shaping adversaries'
behaviour, highlighting its inherent bluntness and lack of precision in
achieving political and strategic outcomes.

Putin's initial announcement on doctrinal changes was also timed to
coincide with discussions at the United Nations, where Ukrainian
President Volodymyr Zelensky was pressing for permission to use advanced
Western-supplied weaponry against high-value targets deep inside Russian
territory. Zelensky's appeal reflects a strategic shift, as Ukraine
seeks not only to defend its own territories but also to weaken Russia's
capacity for continued aggression by targeting military infrastructure
within Russia itself.

With Zelensky's request, western powers had to weigh the potential
escalation risks against the benefits of allowing Ukraine broader
operational freedom. In this context, Putin's 24th September
announcement served as a counter-warning, subtly reminding the UN and
NATO members of the dangers of pushing Moscow's red lines too far. Yet,
despite this warning, on 17th November the US approved Kyiv's request
for authorisation to use ATCMS missiles outside its own borders, and
shortly after, the UK followed suit in lifting restrictions on Ukrainian
use of British cruise Storm Shadow missiles on targets inside Russia.

After Biden's approval, Ukraine fired six ATACMS and Storm Shadow
missiles into Russia, indicating that the US and UK both believed Putin
was bluffing in his 24th September statement, which warned that
aggression against Russia by a non-nuclear state, if supported by or
involving a nuclear state, would be treated as a joint attack on the
Russian Federation and could provoke a nuclear response.

But why has the US decided to push against Russia's red lines? This
could be down to the fact that President-elect Trump has repeatedly
expressed dissatisfaction with continued US military and economic
support for Ukraine, arguing that it does not align with US national
interests. Throughout his campaign, Trump claimed he would end the
conflict on the first day of his presidency. Without meaningful US
backing, the West would face significant challenges in marshalling
resources to support Ukraine, which would cede military advantages to
Russia. Paradoxically, while this decreases the likelihood of Putin
escalating the war through nuclear means, it significantly increases the
risk of Ukraine losing more territory to Russia.

With a countdown of less than two months before an incoming Trump
administration, the Biden administration is essentially signalling to
Ukraine that it will support its efforts to retain the small portion of
Russian territory it currently holds, to use it as a significant
bargaining chip in potential future negotiations.

In response, Putin formalised Russia's revised nuclear doctrine "in a
timely manner," doubling down on his position to underscore the
seriousness of Russia's political and military boundaries while seeking
to deter further Western military involvement without provoking direct
confrontation. Following this, Putin retaliated by launching a
nuclear-capable experimental ballistic missile with a range of several
thousand kilometres against the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. This signalled
a warning to Kyiv's allies: a broader conflict may loom unless the West
adjusts its policy.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. decision to allow
[Ukraine]{.underline} to fire American weapons deeper into Russia [has
not increased the **risk** of a **nuclear attack**, **which is
unlikely**]{.underline}, [despite]{.underline} Russian President
Vladimir [Putin\'s]{.underline} increasingly **[bellicose]{.underline}**
[statements]{.underline}, five sources familiar with U.S. intelligence
told Reuters.

But Russia is likely to expand a campaign of sabotage against European
targets to increase pressure on the West over its support for Kyiv, said
two senior officials, a lawmaker and two congressional aides briefed on
the matter.

A series of **[intelligence assessments]{.underline}** over the past
seven months have [**concluded nuclear escalation** was
**unlikely**]{.underline} to result from a decision to loosen
restrictions on Ukraine\'s use of U.S. weapons. That view has not
changed following President Joe Biden\'s changed U.S. stance this month
on weapons, said the sources, who were granted anonymity to speak freely
about sensitive intelligence.

What about the risk of nuclear escalation in such a conflict? Most
analysts still assess the [**probability of nuclear weapons** being
used]{.underline} as **[very low]{.underline}**, but not zero. Notably,
a 2023 survey by CSIS's ChinaPower project revealed a striking
perception gap: 44% of U.S. security experts believed China might be
willing to detonate a nuclear weapon against U.S. or allied forces in a
Taiwan war, whereas only 11% of experts in Taiwan thought China would go
that far chinapower.csis.org. In other words, American experts are more
wary that Beijing could resort to nukes if losing a war, while
[Taiwanese experts **overwhelmingly (89%) judge** that **China** "would
**not resort to** using nuclear weapons]{.underline}" in a cross-strait
conflict chinapower.csis.org. [The]{.underline} [**consensus view** in
Taiwan -- and among **many international scholars** -- is that nuclear
use would occur only under the most extreme circumstances]{.underline}
apln.network. [Beijing would have to feel an **existential threat to**
the regime or homeland]{.underline} (for example, facing massive U.S.
attacks on mainland cities or the imminent loss of its military) [before
considering such a **drastic step.**]{.underline}

[**Defense think tanks** and **wargame simulations**]{.underline}
generally [reinforce the notion that **nuclear escalation** is **highly
unlikely**]{.underline} in a Taiwan scenario. Wargames conducted by U.S.
analysts (e.g. at CSIS and RAND) typically assume [**both** **China**
and the **U.S.** are **extremely** **reluctant** to cross **the nuclear
threshold**, given the **mutually catastrophic
consequences**]{.underline}. Unlike some Cold War scenarios, a conflict
over Taiwan [does **not inherently** require **nuclear** strikes to
**achieve military aims**]{.underline} -- [and using one could
**backfire disastrously**]{.underline}. As one scholarly analysis put
it, "[the use of nuclear weapons]{.underline} in the Taiwan Strait
[would happen only **under extreme circumstances**]{.underline}", and
[**even then** it would be a **desperate last resort**]{.underline}

We postulate that a [war between the United States and China would be
**regional**]{.underline}, **[conventional]{.underline}**, and
high-tech, and it would be waged mainly on and beneath the sea, in the
air (with aircraft, drones, and missiles), in space, and in cyberspace.
Although ground combat could occur in certain scenarios (e.g., a
conflict over Korean unification), we [**exclude** the **possibility**
of a **huge land** war]{.underline} in Asia. We assume that [fighting
would **start** and **remain** in **East Asia**,]{.underline} where
potential flash points and nearly all Chinese forces are located. Each
side's increasingly far-flung regional disposition of forces and growing
ability to track and attack opposing forces could turn much of the
Western Pacific into a "war zone," with grave economic consequences. [It
is **unlikely that nuclear weapons would be used**]{.underline}: [Even
in an **intensely violent conventional conflict**, **neither side
would** regard its losses **as so serious**, its prospects so dire, or
the **stakes so vital that** it would run the **risk of nuclear
retaliation** by using **nuclear** **weapons first**]{.underline}. We
also assume that [China **would not attack the U.S.
homeland**]{.underline}, except via cyberspace, [given **China's minimal
capability** to do so with conventional weapons.]{.underline} In
contrast, U.S. nonnuclear attacks against military targets in China
could be extensive.
