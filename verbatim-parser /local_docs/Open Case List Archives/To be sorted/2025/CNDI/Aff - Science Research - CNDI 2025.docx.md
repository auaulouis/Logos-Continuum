The world is experiencing a rapid rise in average global temperatures
and **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** is increasingly recognized
as [[a health **security threat multiplier**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Climate-induced changes in land use and global ecosystems are increasing
the risk of [**emergence** of **novel [zoonotic pathogens]{.mark}** that
can **[spill]{.mark} [over]{.mark}** from **animals [to
humans]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[In the Arctic]{.underline}**]{.mark},
global warming is causing the **[[thawing]{.mark} of
[permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}** reported to be [**[releasing]{.mark}
biogeochemical** **[hazards]{.mark}** such as **[viruses]{.mark}**,
**bacteria**, **anthropogenic [chemicals]{.mark}**, and **[nuclear
wastes]{.mark}** into the **environment**]{.underline}. Globalization
also increases the risk that "**[[time-traveling
pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [stored for thousands of years in
permafrost could]{.underline} potentially [survive]{.underline},
**[[spread]{.underline}]{.mark}** to other regions of the world, and
[**[evolve]{.mark}** **over time.**]{.underline}

[[Amid]{.underline}]{.mark} these **[[cascading global risk]{.mark}
[drivers]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [there is a [need]{.mark} for
[policies]{.mark} [that enable]{.mark} **mainstream [adoption]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} equitable [**scale**-**up** of **next-generation**]{.mark}
**[sequencing]{.mark}**]{.underline} (NGS, or NextGen sequencing)
[**[technologies]{.mark}** capable of **[rapid]{.mark}** and
[**comprehensive surveillance** of]{.mark} **emerging** and **reemerging
[biological]{.mark}** [threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} NGS
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [[aid]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
earlier [identification and **[tracking]{.mark}** of infectious disease
**[pathogens]{.mark}**]{.underline} by [collecting samples]{.underline}
containing pathogen genetic material from different sources and
**[[aggregating]{.underline}]{.mark}** this [**[data]{.mark}** to make a
microbial diagnosis]{.underline}. These technologies also provide
**[[valuable surveillance insights]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[into]{.underline}]{.mark} the characteristics of the outbreak-causing
pathogens, including disease [transmission
[patterns]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline} the presence
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [antimicrobial resistant (**[AMR]{.mark})
genes**.]{.underline} Notably, [**[metagenomics]{.mark}
"[shotgun]{.mark}**" NGS **[tech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline} can more
quickly detect a diversity of known and unknown pathogens within a
genetic sample simultaneously to better inform public health action.
However, a [[**lack of policies** to **ensure** **investments**]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} its **cost-effective [scale-up]{.mark}** [and
**integration** with]{.mark} **traditional [epidemiologic]{.mark}
[surveillance]{.mark}** **systems** are [hinder]{.mark}ing the
[**widespread adoption** of]{.mark} this [critical]{.mark}ly important
[tech]{.mark}nology [as]{.mark} an [early]{.mark} **[warning tool for
biological threat detection]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Learning the right lesson from COVID-19

**[Potentially [catastrophic biological events]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
such as [**[emerging]{.mark}** and **reemerging [pathogens]{.mark}**
from permafrost thaw and **[with spillover
potential]{.mark}**]{.underline}, are often [viewed as falling within
the realm of science fiction.]{.underline} However, the emergence of
SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus causing [COVID]{.underline}-19) [made clear
that **low**-**probability, [high-consequence events]{.mark}**, such as
an [outbreak of a pandemic]{.mark}-causing novel **[zoonotic]{.mark}
[virus]{.mark}**, are **[increasing in likelihood]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and, thus, not confined to Hollywood screenwriting.

A major lesson emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic is the need for
[**stronger partnerships** on **strengthening** the global
**architecture** to enable **routine adoption** of NextGen **sequencing
technologies**]{.underline} for early detection of emerging pathogens
and the utilization of sequencing data to rapidly **[[initiate risk
mitigation activities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. During the pandemic, there
was an increase in the use of "omics" technology to identify different
strains of SARS-CoV-2 in circulation. This advanced pathogen
surveillance and characterization method was highly [**instrumental** in
providing an **effective response** to the pandemic]{.underline},
including for developing targeted COVID-19 vaccines. **[[In the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[genomics
sequencing]{.underline}]{.mark} combined with wastewater **[surveillance
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}** was successfully used to [keep track of new
strains]{.underline} of SARS-CoV-2 and to provide an [[early]{.mark}
[warning about]{.mark}]{.underline} other pathogen types, including
**[[AMR]{.mark} pathogens,]{.underline}** circulating in a community.

The early identification of the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 by
researchers in South Africa and Botswana in November 2021 highlighted
the advanced genomics capacities in place in some countries in Africa,
as part of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention
Pathogen Genomics Initiative (PGI). In real-time, researchers from the
region took appropriate measures to share sequenced data with the rest
of the world as an early warning about the emergence of a new variant of
the virus. The "rewards" of such proactivity, however, were travel bans
and other punitive measures adopted by many countries, including the
United States, to the detriment of southern African countries. This
unfortunate turn of events highlights the [[**need to strengthen
policies** to enable]{.mark}]{.underline} better cooperation of
countries around [rapid **[sharing of pathogen genomics]{.mark}**
data]{.underline} in real time and near real time as new pathogens
emerge [to better [inform **data**-**driven**]{.mark}
**decision**-**making** for [pandemic]{.mark} **[prevention]{.mark}**,
**preparedness**, and **response**]{.underline} (PPPR).

Technology solutions

[To ensure the **[effective monitoring]{.mark} and** [**early
detection** of **biological threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
**[[emerging AMR pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}** with the [[**potential
to spread** across **geographic** **regions**]{.underline}]{.mark},
there is a [**[need]{.mark}** for **mainstream** [**adoption**
of]{.mark} a high throughput sequencing [platform]{.mark} that can
[provide detailed **genetic** info]{.mark}rmation about pathogens more
rapidly and in the most cost-efficient manner]{.underline}.
[**[Amid]{.mark}** the **[warming]{.mark} of the** **[Arctic]{.mark}**,
there are **ongoing [research studies]{.mark}** [into]{.mark} the
[**genomic diversity** of **permafrost**]{.mark} **[pathogens]{.mark}**
[using **metagenomics**]{.mark} sequencing.]{.underline} This
pathogen-agnostic approach to pathogen [[**surveillance
enables**]{.mark} the rapid identification]{.underline} of multiple
pathogen types in a genetic sample and [[**prediction of resistance**
**emergence**]{.mark} to [inform]{.mark}]{.underline} public health
decision making, policy formulation, and the implementation of
appropriate **[[biothreat risk mitigation]{.mark}
interventions.]{.underline}**

At present, **[[metagenomics]{.mark} sequencing
technology]{.underline}** [is [yet to be]{.mark}]{.underline} routinely
[[adopted]{.underline}]{.mark} and integrated [[into **national
surveillance**]{.mark} **systems**]{.underline} such as the National
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS). This problem may be
due to the complex workflow protocols and computationally demanding
procedures that drive up implementation costs, thus making the current
approach to metagenomics sequencing hard to scale as a nationwide
strategy for routine AMR pathogen surveillance and early detection of
emerging pathogens. Identifying the problem provides an [opportunity
to]{.underline} also inform the **[[development of policy
solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** focused on reducing costs.

One cost-cutting approach is to implement a standardized process and
automated workflow protocol for routinely collecting, sequencing,
analyzing, and integrating metagenomics sequenced data and ensuring
harmonization/integration of data with the NARMS and other epidemiologic
surveillance systems. Similarly, adopting a portable metagenomics
sequencing platform will help reduce the time and corresponding costs of
metagenomics data synthesis and reporting by simplifying the workflow
process and reducing the turnaround time of sequenced data results.
Existing portable sequencing platforms that have been validated and may
be adopted for real-time analysis of metagenomics sequencing data
include Oxford Nanopore's MinION and iGenomics app.

Scaling up metagenomics sequencing

Enhancing pathogen [genomic [surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}
capacities for informing public health action would [[require]{.mark}
**equitable [scale-up]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **metagenomics [sequencing
nationally]{.mark}**]{.underline}, regionally, and globally and having
in place the right policies to [enable its effective implementation
across health systems]{.underline}. [[At]{.underline} [the national
level]{.underline}]{.mark}[, there is a **[need to harmonize]{.mark}**
and **[ensure interoperability]{.mark}** of **metagenomics-enabled
surveillance** data with other existing data]{.underline} systems using
a One Health approach. This approach would also require [**[enhancing
capacities]{.mark}**]{.underline} of countries in [[**environmental
surveillance** and **climate** **forecasting**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[In the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the White House has put
forward a new executive order on enhancing the biotechnology and
biomanufacturing sector, in close partnership with other countries, and
pledges to invest eighty-eight billion dollars in PPPR activities over a
five-year period.

In line with efforts to leverage emerging technologies, the newly
launched **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** Office of Pandemic Preparedness
and Response Policy [**[should prioritize policies]{.mark}** that
[enable **widespread use of metagenomics**]{.mark} **sequencing**
[for]{.mark} early [**detection** of **biological threats**]{.mark}
including **AMR pathogens**.]{.underline} It will be important to ensure
these policies align with the Pioneering Antimicrobial Subscriptions to
End Upsurging Resistance (PASTEUR) Act reintroduced to the Senate in
April 2023. The PASTEUR Act aims to address existing gaps in
antimicrobial development by incentivizing private sector providers to
discover and develop new antimicrobials and to increase public health
preparedness. Improving the [**utility** and [**scale-up** of]{.mark}
**metagenomics** **sequencing** for early warning of **emerging
biological** threats and for **resistant pathogen
[monitoring]{.mark}**]{.underline} would help ensure the [availability
of more sensitive data]{.underline} to **[[promote
innovations]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
development of novel broad spectrum [[antimicrobial
drugs]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[fight]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[silent pandemic of AMR]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Similarly, the
recently proposed Emerging Pathogens Preparedness Program under the US
Food and Drug Administration could help promote regulatory reforms
needed to speed up the development of medical countermeasures.

As the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention progresses with
strengthening the capacities of all fifty-five African Union member
countries in metagenomics-enabled microbial surveillance via the PGI,
there is also an opportunity to enhance coalitions with the **[[United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}** on PPPR to [[ensure]{.mark} better
[preparedness for the **next biological threat
that**]{.mark}]{.underline} may potentially [emerge [from the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and other ["**[hotspot]{.mark}"
regions**]{.underline}. In addition to existing partnerships across
technical institutions, new coalition building opportunities should be
explored with agencies such as the newly formed Bureau of Global Health
Security and Diplomacy [under the [US]{.mark} Department of
State]{.underline}, to [set joint standards]{.underline} to enable the
use of metagenomics sequencing **[[more effective]{.mark}ly for
biological [threat detection]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[**[Enhancing]{.mark}** and **scaling** **up pathogen** genomics
**[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline} capacities across geographic
regions also requires identifying opportunities for public-private
sector partnerships, such as existing partnerships with Illumina, Inc.
on the PGI; and the collaborative efforts of the Gates Foundation and
Chan Zuckerberg Biohub initiative established during the COVID-19
pandemic.

Globally, a way to ensure harmonized standards setting and
interoperability of genomics data across geographic regions is to align
national and regional policies with global frameworks such as the World
Health Organization (WHO) Global Genomic Surveillance Strategy for
Pathogens with Pandemic and Epidemic Potential. The WHO Strategy aims to
achieve a set target of ensuring access to timely and reliable genomic
sequencing data for identified pathogens with epidemic and pandemic
potential by 2032.

"Canary in the coal mine"

The ongoing thawing permafrost in the **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is just one of many ecosystem changes caused by climate change. This
process of [[**permafrost** **degradation**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
subsequent discoveries of emerging pathogens, such as
[[resistant]{.mark} pathogen [strains]{.mark}]{.underline} with the
potential to **[[spread]{.mark} to other regions]{.underline}**, serve
as a "canary in the coal mine" signaling the [[**imminent risk**
of]{.mark} **occurrence of a [global catastrophic]{.mark}**
[**biological event**, if]{.mark} left
[**unaddressed**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Although there are no easy solutions to addressing the global climate
crisis and its impact on infectious disease pathogen emergence and
reemergence, there is a need to move away from the approach of adopting
quick fixes in a fragmented and uncoordinated manner. It is also
well-acknowledged that calling attention to the [increasing
[global]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[health security threat]{.mark}** posed
[by]{.mark} climate change driven invisible
"**[superbugs]{.mark}**]{.underline}" is not as attention-grabbing as
the threat of extinction of "charismatic megafaunas" driving many
ecosystem conservation efforts. Nevertheless, there remains an urgent
need to link PPPR [initiatives]{.underline} to climate action goals of
**[[reducing carbon emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}** to help
[**[reverse]{.mark} global** **[warming]{.mark}** and **[stop]{.mark}
further [degradation of the]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such
initiatives might include [adopting national]{.underline} and global
[policies]{.underline} that **[enable]{.underline}** partnership
building and [[**investments** in **emerging tech**]{.mark}**nologies**
including **[metagenomics]{.mark}**]{.underline} "shotgun" NextGen
[sequencing]{.underline} **[[for environmental
monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}** and early [[detection]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} emerging and reemerging
**[[pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This sequencing approach could
**[[inform]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[development of
antimicrobials]{.underline}]{.mark} and other [medical countermeasures
as a **[critical aspect of biological risk
mitigation.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[**[Robust policy solutions are required]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
[enable]{.underline}]{.mark} the cost-efficient [[**scale-up** and
**interoperability**]{.mark} of metagenomics sequencing data
platforms]{.underline} with other complementary pathogen monitoring
systems using a One Health approach. There is also a need to strengthen
international cooperation on pathogen genomics surveillance. Such
cooperation can be strengthened via the harmonization of data sharing
platforms and adoption of joint policy frameworks to improve early
warning and detection of [environmentally driven]{.underline}
[[emerging]{.mark} biological [threats]{.mark} and looming threats [such
as **Disease**]{.mark} [**X**,]{.mark}]{.underline} a term used to
indicate an unknown pathogen with the [potential to [infect
humans]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The gathering of various interest groups, including policymakers,
international organizations, multisectoral experts, technology
providers, and industry players at the upcoming United Nations Climate
Change Conference, known as COP28, provides the right convening platform
to strengthen existing partnerships and form new coalitions as a call to
action during the COP28 Health Day and Climate-Health Ministerial. In
advance of future global gatherings, ensuring an effective response to
this clarion call [requires]{.underline} setting data-driven,
cross-sectoral [policy agendas]{.underline} and implementing measurable
joint action plans to track progress with **[[achieving health
security]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[climate
change goals]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} known **ancillary
[benefits]{.mark}** [across **all**]{.mark}]{.underline} relevant
[**[sectors]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

No organisms---except possibly microbes---are prepared to adapt to the
unstable climate regime the Earth has entered. Humans are far behind the
curve in adapting to the climate change they have caused with their
carbon dioxide emissions, particularly as regards the **[[climate-driven
spread of pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The tropics have been a
focus of concern about climate and disease, as [warming
causes]{.underline} insects and other **[disease vectors to
spread]{.underline}** away from the equator. But while diseases from the
south, such as dengue fever, Ebola, and Zika, are clear dangers that
occupy most of the attention of infectious disease epidemiologists,
[**[few]{.mark} [researchers]{.mark}** are [looking for]{.mark} **new**
or ancient **[Arctic pathogens]{.mark}** that current generations of
humans have **[never]{.mark} been [exposed to.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

One research team described permafrost as "a reservoir of minimally
characterized microbial life" that can hold thousands of species, very
few of which have been studied. Because [[there is **so little
information**]{.underline}]{.mark}, most experts caution that trying
[[to assess]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[microbial risk in and from the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** is speculative. But others point out that
when data is sparse, [**informed [hypothesizing]{.mark}** can [lead
to]{.mark} an [i**mproved**]{.mark} **strategy** for [**responding** to
**crises**]{.mark} now unforeseen.]{.underline}

Recently there's been a lot of press coverage of "**[[zombie
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[bursting out of **thawing**
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}. The bodies of people and animals buried
in permafrost a few centuries ago have contained potentially infectious
variants of [**[smallpox]{.mark}**, **[anthrax]{.mark}**, and
**[influenza]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but because of this risk, most
scientists have expressed little interest in studying zombie
viruses---especially smallpox---in a lab.

There is little agreement among experts as to the risks of "zombie"
pathogens spreading into the larger world population. Some research
establishes that even very old permafrost microbes can be viable.

But Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East
Anglia who has studied Covid and infectious diseases related to extreme
weather, is not worried about the viruses that have actually been
revived from permafrost because "none of them are human pathogens,
they're all protozoan viruses." Further, Hunter says, because all the
"zombie viruses" that are human pathogens are familiar, if they are
revived they can be handled with vaccines and antibiotics. "Currently
there's nothing to suggest there would be something coming out that
would be a new disease that would infect humans," he adds. Much of the
viral DNA found in permafrost is degraded, so even if the viruses remain
intact, they are unlikely to be infectious.

But zombies may be the least of our Arctic disease worries.

**[[Arctic microbes]{.underline}]{.mark}** are far more diverse and
complex than the few familiar viruses identified so far in frozen bodies
that have thawed, and they [[present]{.mark} **very [real
risks]{.mark}** to humans]{.underline} and other animals. Unlike
Antarctica, the Arctic is home to millions of people (estimates range
from four million to 13 million). Pathogens are moving both southward
from and northward into Arctic regions through many routes, and people
in the Arctic are bearing the brunt of them. Indigenous residents and
mobile workers in mining and fossil fuel extraction industries face the
most immediate risks from the mingling of previously separated
ecologies. [[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} also promises to
**[[aggravate zoonosis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or diseases that jump
from animals to people (and vice versa). Finally, there are risks from
[global atmospheric transport of microbes]{.underline} and from gene
exchanges among formerly separated microbial populations that may
[**[create]{.mark} new [diseases]{.mark}** or worsen old
ones.]{.underline}

The permafrost problem

Climate change has a clear and disturbing effect on infectious diseases.
A 2022 study by University of Hawai'i ecologist Camilo Mora and
colleagues found that of "375 infectious diseases documented to have
impacted humanity, 218 were found to be aggravated by climatic hazards."
Warming, precipitation, floods, and drought exacerbated 103
vector-borne, 78 waterborne, and 60 airborne diseases, most caused by
viruses and bacteria, with lesser involvement of fungi and protozoans.
And these were only diseases already known to science.

[Climate change is dramatically affecting **permafrost**]{.underline}, a
loose conglomerate of rock, soil, plant matter, ice and microbes, with a
thin top layer that melts and refreezes seasonally; it covers about 25
percent of the Northern Hemisphere's land surface. Estimates of the
oldest permafrost in the northern hemisphere, in Siberia's Kolyma
region, range between one million and three million years.

The combined mass of continuous permafrost in the Arctic and Tibetan
Plateau is nearly 11 million square kilometers; by contrast,
Antarctica's permafrost covers at most about 71,000 km2. Russia is far
and away the possessor of the most Arctic permafrost, a fact that causes
problems for the rest of the world, given Russia's war aims and
unwillingness to share information.

Humans living [[in the **Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark} have in recent
centuries built their residences, businesses, and other infrastructure
atop permafrost, which served as a sort of perpetual foundation. Now, as
climate change proceeds, [[**permafrost** is **collapsing**]{.mark}
across the North]{.underline}, destroying water systems, roads,
buildings, and pipelines and leading to contamination of areas humans
use. [[**Permafrost collapse generates** new]{.mark} [lakes]{.mark} that
can join up with surface streams and [carry **microbes into the
ocean**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Open-pit mines, eroded bluffs, and
sinkholes expose ancient organic matter. In addition to bacteria and
viruses, fungi, lichens, and even nematode worms have been revived from
permafrost. So while there is some reason to avoid panic about zombie
microbes, [[humans]{.underline}]{.mark} do [face the possibility of
[meeting]{.mark} up with the vast, **[newly exposed microbial
storehouse]{.mark}** released from permafrost.]{.underline}

Potential pathogens could move into and out of the Arctic in multiple
ways. Ships' ballast water transports invasive species, including
microbes. Animal carriers, especially rodents like beaver, rats and
rabbits, bring southern pathogens like giardia, rabies, toxoplasmosis,
and hantavirus northward, while marine mammals and birds migrate great
distances north and south, traversing the Arctic, Pacific and Atlantic
oceans distributing bacteria, viruses and fungi. And as resource
extraction rises, more workers move between weeks-long shifts in the
Arctic to urban areas in more southerly regions, often using air
transport.

All of the possible routes for [[**emergence** and **spread of new
pathogens**]{.mark} are [**very** **likely** to appear at]{.mark} the
[**interface** between **ecosystems**]{.mark} that have **previously**
been **isolated** from each other]{.underline}---as we have learned from
the bat-derived Covid and Ebola viruses. Climate change and development
make fertile partners for [rapid evolution of microbes]{.underline}
because they [create new interfaces.]{.underline}

There are a couple of possible mechanisms for microbial invention and
movement that are considered outliers by many---but not all---experts:
Horizontal gene transfer and atmospheric transport of pathogenic
microbes.

Bacteria and viruses don't evolve the way multicellular animals do. They
don't reproduce sexually, but by cloning. Viruses hijack cellular
organisms, including bacteria, to make copies of themselves. This makes
it much easier for genes to be transmitted among and between bacteria
and viruses, and microbes take full advantage. Their free exchange of
genes includes those that confer antibiotic resistance and virulence
(how sick they make their host).

And most of those trafficked genes acquired by human pathogens originate
in environmental microorganisms, according to microbial ecologist Jose
Luis Martinez of the Centro Nacional de Biotecnologia in Madrid. This
horizontal gene transfer means that microbial evolution can be rapid and
nonlinear, rather than by gradual mutation inside known human pathogens.
"The dominant process has been dubbed evolution in quantum leaps,"
Martinez wrote in a 2018 paper.

[[Genes for **a**]{.mark}**nti[b]{.mark}iotic [r]{.mark}esistance** [and
viru**l**ence develop "a **life of their own"** in "**pathogenicity
islands**]{.mark}]{.underline}" as they move among different types of
organisms, wrote Peter Gogarten, distinguished professor of microbiology
at the University of Connecticut at Storrs, in an email. These islands
are handy, two-for-the-price-of-one packets. But Gogarten views "the
[transfer of viruses and resistance genes between humans and
wildlife]{.underline}" as "the [bigger threat for the **emergence** of
**novel** **disease** (in humans]{.underline} or animals)." This would
not eliminate the horizontal gene transfer in the wild; it would just
undergo an intermediate step, zoonosis, before new pathogenic genes
reach human microbes. Again, **[[monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}**
marine mammals [**[provides a window]{.mark}** into that
process.]{.underline} While [[zoonosis]{.underline}]{.mark} may be
unpredictable, research clearly shows that it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
also **[[inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

As with all the factors contributing to the Arctic's potential to spread
pathogens, the data on atmospheric transport of microbes is limited. But
as early as 1936, viable bacteria and fungi were found in the
stratosphere. Airborne microbes can travel great distances. Dust plumes
from the Gobi Desert region and the Sahara deposit 56 million metric
tons a year on the United States West Coast and 50 million tons on
Florida and the Caribbean, respectively.

But do microbes in the skies actually cause disease? There are certainly
pathogens there. Recent research identified 22 fungal species and 25
bacterial species in the stratosphere, including methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), a scourge of hospitals everywhere. There
is strong evidence of transoceanic pathogens associated with or causing
disease in plants and marine organisms like corals.

Regional disease outbreaks occur in many places after dust storms.
Within Africa, airborne fungi have long been associated with bursts of
meningitis after Sahara dust storms. In the United States, cases of
coccidiomycosis, or Valley Fever, have been associated with dust storms
in the desert southwest.

Overall, "[The **[microbiological research]{.mark}** conducted to date
has [identified]{.mark} a wide **range of [airborne pathogenic
microorganisms]{.mark}** that **[move great distances]{.mark} [through
the atmosphere]{.mark}**]{.underline}," wrote Paraskevi Polymenakou, an
environmental microbiologist at the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research
in Crete.

There is also some research showing that [microbes]{.underline},
including pathogens, travel by atmosphere into the Arctic and that
[**microbes** **aerosolized** out of thawing permafrost and melting ice
can **travel long distances** **out of the Arctic**]{.underline}. But
the supply of research on microbial movement by air is relatively small,
and the dearth of research on Arctic microbes includes a lack of
knowledge about Arctic pathogens. So clarity on the risk from pathogens
raining from the sky in the Arctic or elsewhere, that are known to have
caused disease, **[[awaits much more study]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Dale
Griffin, an atmospheric microbiologist formerly with the U.S. Geological
Survey, characterizes the risk from atmospheric transport of pathogens
as "real but moderate" based on current knowledge, while stressing that
"[**[long-range atmospheric transport is
understudied]{.underline}**."]{.mark}

Mora compared several centuries' worth of climate change data with a
dataset related to epidemics. He found that climate influences
infectious diseases in several ways. "There has to be contact between
disease and person," he says. This happens where people are forced to
migrate into new environments because of "hurricanes, floods, and heat
waves." Also, Mora found, pathogens can become stronger in higher
latitudes where milder winters enable them to survive year-round and
disasters degrade both public health protections and people's immune
responses in unaccustomed higher temperatures. All of these
circumstances are starting to affect the Arctic.

Arctic shipping as a disease spreader

Increased shipping and accelerating development are closely tied in the
Arctic and present a significant risk for disease spread. There is great
interest in a trans-Arctic shipping route between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans because it could shave five days off the current transit
time through the Suez and Panama Canals for voyages between Asia,
Europe, and eastern North America. Shipping interests eagerly anticipate
the point when the trans-Arctic sea routes are ice-free year-round.

It\'s uncertain whether industrial and commercial development in the
Arctic will continue apace in the short run. The Russia-Ukraine war has
somewhat dampened enthusiasm for trans-Arctic shipping, as have the
ongoing threat of sea ice blockages and problems maintaining land
infrastructure crucial to both shipping and oil and gas exploration,
including pipelines. But absent some reversal of climate warming or a
global economic shock, shipping activity in the Arctic is expected to
only go up. Over the last decade, Arctic shipping has certainly done so,
as measured by overall ship traffic, distances sailed, and the striking
example of the Mary River iron mine in Baffinland, where traffic in the
nearby port of Milne Inlet jumped 583 percent in five years.

Ships move about 10 billion tons of ballast water around the world
annually. Ships typically dump their ballast water, which helps maintain
ship stability, in port and take in new water for the next journey.
Expanded Arctic shipping brings with it a severe threat of microbe
exchange between more southerly and Arctic waters. David Lodge,
professor at Cornell's Atkinson Center for Sustainability, has studied
the explosion of invasive species in the world's ports and coastlines.
There is little data on the Arctic, so he stresses he is speculating,
but says, "I think ships are the more likely way to bring quite novel
organisms including microbes into the Arctic and out of the Arctic."

The Russian city of Murmansk is the port with the highest risk of
spreading invasive species, according to a 2016 paper by Notre Dame
University computer scientist Mandana Saebi and colleagues. Most of the
Murmansk traffic moves between Russian ports and those in Nordic
countries. But many voyages also connect with ports to the south; for
example, some voyages stopping at Murmansk also visit West African
ports. This could exacerbate the spread of polar diseases southward and
move tropical diseases into regions with expanding human presence that
are rapidly losing permafrost and sea ice.

Tourist ships can also be a source of microbe exchange. The Arctic
Council's shipping survey found that the number of cruise ships in the
Arctic jumped from 58 in 2013 to 96 in 2023, and cruise ships remain the
sixth largest ship type behind fishing and cargo ships. One experiment
found that antibiotic shoe wash placed where tourists moved on and off
their ship did not effectively reduce their shoes' microbial load. The
passengers in the study visited the Svalbard archipelago, where concerns
about microbial invasions affecting the terrestrial ecosystem are high.

Development, people, and disease transmission

Clearly, the more people move around, the higher the risk of disease
transmission. In the Arctic, the most mobile population is likely the
pool of extractive industry workers. A 2019 demographic atlas of the
Arctic found that "the highest share of working-age population was in
regions where a high proportion of employment is related to extracting
natural resources, e.g. oil, gas and minerals. This is especially the
case in the Russian Arctic regions."

Some of these workers are residents, but industrial activity bringing in
"non-resident male worker populations" is likely a pipeline for rapid
dispersal of infectious diseases. According to a 2019 analysis from
University College London, such transitory workers often live in
"camplike conditions" that encourage "increased demand for commercial
sex and, thereby, potentially human trafficking."

Because of the rapid travel patterns and cramped living quarters typical
of extractive operations, "you don't need a huge dispersal of a
pathogen," Mora says. You just need person-to-person transmission in
close quarters and one infected person to carry the disease quickly to a
more populated area.

Greenland is a prime example of the problem. It is already at high risk
for pathogen exchange and on the brink of massive expansion of resource
extraction. The mineral exploration company KoBold Metals, with
investors who include Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Amazon and
Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, and Ray Dalio, founder of the world's
largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, is exploring for nickel,
copper, cobalt, and platinum group metals in Greenland as the island's
massive central ice sheet recedes. Their goal is ostensibly to
facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. But, says Markus
Kröger, professor of global development studies at the University of
Helsinki, extraction projects are also pushing right up against the
thawing permafrost and fostering the creation of boom-bust towns, which
are known breeding grounds for both emerging and familiar diseases.
Greenland is currently a hotspot for the sexually transmitted diseases
chlamydia and gonorrhea, far outpacing the Arctic regions of the United
States and Canada.

Neither KoBold Metals nor the Gates Foundation responded to multiple
requests for comment on their Greenland efforts.

Animals and Arctic diseases

Along with shipping and development, there is a third major disease
pipeline into and out of the world's Arctic regions: zoonosis. Some 60
percent of known and 75 percent of emerging human pathogens have jumped
from other animals to humans. In lower latitudes, bird flu has already
jumped from birds to cattle and from cattle to humans. Cats and dogs
have also been exposed. In the Arctic, domestic animals are already
known to have exchanged pathogens with marine mammals.

Ashley Barratclough, a veterinarian with the National Marine Mammal
Foundation in San Diego, studies disease transmission among Arctic
mammals. She is concerned **about** Pacific orca, for example, traveling
farther into the Arctic Ocean as waters warm to prey on bowhead whales.
She says, "[Climate change \[is\] opening up for the first time for
these species to interact and \[for their **diseases to\] cross**
over]{.underline}. That to me is a much bigger concern than the ice
melting \[and\] releasing a pathogen from a dead body. We often refer to
marine mammals as the sentinels of the ocean, and [[it's a **matter of
time**]{.mark} [before]{.mark} [they're]{.mark} going to be
[**affecting** **people**]{.mark}."]{.underline} The place to monitor
the danger, she says, is among subsistence hunters and herders, who are
the frontline humans at most risk from zoonosis. Herders are especially
vulnerable in the Nordic Arctic and Russia's vast permafrost region.

The [**wild unpredictability** of zoonosis]{.underline} is one of the
reasons it [keeps many infectious disease experts up at
night]{.underline}. A potential brake on it, says Barratclough, is that
a pathogen---say, bird flu---jumping species may become "deadly in one
species but not necessarily the other." For example, she adds,
"Influenza can be highly pathogenic in birds but not necessarily in
marine mammals." This also might be true for humans but is not certain
and cannot be taken for granted for all diseases.

The microbe-spreading effects of wildfire

Wildfires are a major source of atmospheric particulates, and they are
sharply increasing in size and ferocity globally. Climate change will
amplify the Arctic's contribution to this phenomenon. Romanovsky, the
Alaska-based geophysicist, says wildfires can easily rage on top of
permafrost. In a 2013 study he and his colleagues observed that
wildfires can accelerate warming and irreversibly degrade permafrost.
This causes something of a feedback loop that will catapult more
material into the atmosphere.

Somewhat counterintuitively, wildfires are efficient microbe
transporters. Bacteria are not necessarily killed by fires, and they
even survive the updrafts of hot air surrounding wildfires. Viruses (not
technically alive) also hitch rides. Anna Bruhn's master's thesis in
geography from Sweden's Lund University examined whether ancient
microbes emerging from permafrost and ice might move between Greenland
and continental Europe via the atmosphere. Greenland is still mostly
ice, but it has seen numerous wildfires in the last 15 years. These have
exploded in rapidly degrading permafrost, according to a study by
Romanovsky.

Bruhn was surprised by her conclusion that microbes easily travel in
wildfire smoke. "I didn't think it would be so real-world applicable,
because I thought if these diseases are going to emerge, they're more
likely to spread on a plane to Copenhagen," she says.

What is being and should be done

There are national and international efforts [[to **anticipate** and
**control** **infectious** **diseases** in the]{.mark}
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Marion Koopmans, a veterinary virologist
at The Netherlands' Versatile Emerging Infectious Disease Observatory
who has worked extensively on COVID-19 epidemiology, says, "Since the
pandemic there was a big scale-up of the ability to test in all sorts of
places in the world, and there's now initiative to see how we can use
that capacity for other things."

The World Health Organization (WHO) has compiled a list of "**[[priority
pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}**"\[35\] [[requiri]{.mark}ng
**[more]{.mark}** investment and **[research]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
list comprises mostly tropical pathogens and a few temperate ones, but
it does include "**[Disease X]{.underline}**," which "represents the
knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be [caused by a
pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease]{.underline}."

But again, [most of the attention is on **known**
**pathogens**]{.underline}. Koopmans would not put the Arctic at the top
of her surveillance list. She says, "I would assume that opportunity
\[in the Arctic\] is way less than for some of the high-risk hotspots,
let's say in Southeast Asia," where diseases like polio could simply get
out of hand because of inadequate public health protections.

In Alaska, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors
infections of five bacterial pathogens including three Streptococcus,
one Meningococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae (a bacterium, not the
influenza virus), along with several viral pathogens, CDC public affairs
officer Thomas Skinner wrote in an email.

[**[Public health surveillance]{.mark}** that concentrates only on
**known diseases** and **[disregards]{.mark} wider, [rapidly]{.mark}**
[changing **microbial ecology**]{.mark}, including]{.underline} the
[transformation]{.underline} now underway [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
large areas of [[permafrost]{.mark}, [**could miss a dangerous
microbe**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Studying]{.mark} known [pathogens]{.mark}]{.underline} [[requires
**techniques** and **knowledge bases different**]{.mark} from those
needed for newly emerging pathogens]{.underline}, says Jean-Michel
Claverie, emeritus professor at the Structural and Genomic Information
Laboratory in Marseille, France. Experts at the WHO and CDC are "highly
specialized people with a matrix of things they want to look for," he
says. Claverie has revived permafrost viruses that infect amoebae. "It's
totally different from people you need to detect a new disease."

If the international community comes up with a viable research program
generalizable to many diseases of concern, then the WHO's work to
prepare for Disease X will be helpful in the event of a new, a newly
pathogenic, or a familiar microbe emerging as a result of climate change
in the Arctic. But [**[unless there is active surveillance]{.mark}**
there, a [new **permafrost pathogen**]{.mark} will still [have its
**window of opportunity**]{.mark}**.** [It would be a **mistake** to
omit the Arctic from **hotspot surveillance.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Those [spill over]{.underline} to unleash the [next pandemic]{.underline}.

University. "Why the next Pandemic Could Come from the Arctic --- and
What to Do about It." Nature 633 (8028).

The Arctic is under stress, that much is known. Between 1979 and 2021,
the region warmed four times faster than the global average, with
effects --- as yet poorly understood --- on its ecology and ability to
store carbon, on global sea levels and on wider ocean-circulation and
weather patterns.

Add in the effects of biodiversity loss and pollution, and people often
refer to a triple planetary crisis. I think we should actually be
talking about a quadruple crisis. Since starting research in the Arctic
in 1997, I have spent nearly all of my summers there, monitoring changes
in pollution levels, habitats and food webs using a 'One Health'
approach that integrates effects on wildlife, humans and ecosystems. And
it's becoming clear that, as the Arctic warms, its environment degrades
and human activities increase, **[[new]{.underline} [health
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** [are [emerging]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
particular, [the [Arctic]{.mark} is likely to become a [**hotbed** for
**zoonotic**]{.mark} **[diseases]{.mark}** that [**spill**
**over**]{.mark} into humans from other animals]{.underline}. That
threat was brought home to all of us by the COVID-19 pandemic. We need
to take seriously [the possibility that the **[next]{.mark}
[pandemic]{.mark}** could **[come from the north.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Some [60% of emerging infectious diseases are
[zoonotic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their emergence and
**[[spillover]{.underline}]{.mark}** is in general highly
[[**interlinked** with]{.mark} **habitat [degradation]{.mark}**[,
**biod**]{.mark}**iversity** [loss]{.mark} and food-**web changes** ---
all of which are present [in the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But a
warming Arctic harbours other risks. As sea ice thaws, 'forever
chemicals' are increasingly being transported into Arctic environments.
These include mercury, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and
polychlorinated biphenyls, all known to modulate human and animal immune
systems and increase vulnerability to respiratory infections. Invasive
fish and whale species are also bringing in industrial chemicals and
their own diseases.

The pathogens enter an environment in which some native species, such as
polar bears (Ursus maritimus), have not been exposed to them, and so are
at increased risk. The release of ancient microorganisms long frozen in
ice and sediments as the landscape thaws adds to this danger:
[[humans]{.underline}]{.mark} and other wildlife are likely to
[[lack]{.underline}]{.mark} any [[immune]{.mark} defences against
them.]{.underline}

These **[[risk factors]{.mark} are set to
[increase]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The first ice-free Arctic summers
could come as early as the 2030s. The Arctic Ocean has huge potential
for energy, fishery and tourism sectors, and is not subject to any
global treaty regulating its exploitation. Further wildlife disturbance,
pollution, overfishing and jurisdictional conflicts are the likely
result.

The current perception is that the Arctic possesses relatively low
microbial activity. Compared with temperate and tropical latitudes,
[**many fewer resources** are devoted to studying zoonoses in the
Arctic]{.underline}, with [**[sparse surveillance]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
emerging **[threats]{.mark} in most** areas]{.underline}. [This needs to
change]{.underline} --- [[taking]{.mark} account of]{.underline} human,
animal and wider **[[environmental perspectives.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

When it comes to logistics, low-tech is high-tech in the Arctic. On the
human side, Canadian researchers have already started taking samples
from sewage and other sources that can easily be analysed for the
presence of viral pathogens. This kind of approach should be combined
with better access to community health care, clinical inspections and
consultations with local doctors. A particular flash point is the
handling and consumption of raw or dried animal meat in
subsistence-hunting communities. Hygiene courses, meat inspection and
better disease surveillance developed in partnership with those
communities can help to both sustain food security and prevent spillover
events.

On the wildlife side, long-term finance is needed for yearly and
seasonal surveillance programmes. These schemes should collaborate with
local communities using existing techniques that don't rely on
technologies such as cryogenics and so are easy to use in situ. Such
activities could be embedded into the ongoing Arctic Council monitoring
and assessment programmes on pollution, biodiversity and climate change,
as laid out in the council's 'One Arctic, One Health' project.

On the broader environmental front, efforts to reduce pollution,
safeguard biodiversity and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions through
international agreements play their part. Efforts spearheaded by various
Arctic Council working groups, and other initiatives such as the ongoing
negotiations for a United Nations-backed treaty on plastic pollution,
show how intergovernmental and interdisciplinary collaboration across
public health, biodiversity conservation, pollution and food security
can help with achieving sustainability.

To make a true difference, there is need for a broader Arctic monitoring
and assessment plan, underpinned by treaty, that combines surveillance
of pollution and of disease. This is currently difficult to achieve
through the Arctic Council, given the absence of Russia and Russian data
since the country's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. A better opportunity to
establish a holistic understanding and action plan might be afforded by
the proposed pandemic-preparedness treaty, currently under negotiation
at the World Health Organization. This could build on the efforts of
almost 200 globally recognized One Health Networks, including those in
the Arctic.

[Action must be taken now. If it isn't,]{.underline} it will become more
difficult to mitigate wildlife interactions and diagnose, treat and
isolate people with an infection --- and [the [**risk** of a **future
pandemic** with an **Arctic ground zero** will only
**increase**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Summary

Scale

[[Pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} --- especially engineered pandemics ---
[[pose a significant risk to the **existence of
humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Though the risk is difficult to assess,
some researchers estimate that there is a greater than 1 in 10,000
chance of a [[**biological** **catastrophe** **leading to human
extinction**]{.underline}]{.mark} within the next 100 years, and
potentially as high as 1 in 100. (See below.) And a biological
catastrophe killing a large percentage of the population is even more
likely --- and could **[[contribute to existential
risk.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Neglectedness

Pandemic prevention is currently moderately resourced. Even in the
aftermath of the COVID-19 outbreak, spending on biodefense in the US,
for instance, has only grown modestly --- from an estimated \$17 billion
in 2019 to \$24 billion in 2023.

One estimate in April 2024 found that global spending on mitigating and
preventing disease outbreaks was around \$130 billion. But it found that
interventions and [[research]{.mark} agendas specifically targeted at
[preventing]{.mark} the most [**catastrophic biological disasters**
remain **neglected**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Solvability

There are promising approaches to improve biosecurity and reducing
pandemics risk, including research, policy interventions, and defensive
technology development.

Why focus your career on preventing severe pandemics?

COVID-19 highlighted our vulnerability to worldwide pandemics and
revealed weaknesses in our ability to respond. Despite advances in
medicine and public health, around seven million deaths worldwide from
the disease have been recorded, and many estimates put the figure far
higher.

Historical events like the Black Death and the 1918 flu show that
pandemics can be some of the most damaging disasters for humanity,
killing tens of millions and significant portions of the global
population.

It is sobering to imagine the potential impact of a **[[pandemic
pathogen]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that is much]{.underline} [more
[**contagious** and **deadly**]{.mark}]{.underline} than any we've seen
so far.

Unfortunately, such a pathogen is possible in principle, particularly in
light of advancing biotechnology. Researchers can design and create
biological agents much more easily and precisely than before. (More on
this below.) As the field advances, it may become increasingly feasible
to engineer a pathogen that poses a major threat to all of humanity.

States or malicious actors with access to these pathogens could use them
as offensive weapons or wield them as threats to obtain leverage over
others.

Dangerous pathogens engineered for research purposes could also be
released accidentally through a failure of lab safety.

Either scenario could result in a catastrophic 'engineered pandemic,'
which we believe could pose an even greater threat to humanity than
pandemics that arise naturally, as we argue below.

Thankfully, few people seek to use disease as a weapon, and even those
willing to conduct such attacks may not aim to produce the most harmful
pathogen possible. But the combined possibilities of accident,
recklessness, desperation, and unusual malice suggest a disturbingly
high chance of a pandemic pathogen being released that could kill a very
large percentage of the population. The world might be especially at
risk during great power conflicts.

But could an engineered pandemic pose an extinction threat to humanity?

There is reasonable debate here. In the past, societies have recovered
from pandemics that killed as much as 50% of the population, and perhaps
more.1

But we believe future [[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark} may be [one of
the [largest]{.mark} [contributors to **existential risk**]{.mark}
**this** century]{.underline}, because it now seems within the reach of
near-term biological advances to create pandemics that would kill
greater than 50% of the population --- [not just in a particular area,
but **globally**]{.underline}. It's possible they could be bad enough to
**[[drive humanity to extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or at least be
so damaging that civilisation never recovers.

#### Independently, AMR causes [extinction]{.underline} absent biomedical research.

**Arthur '17** \[Wallace; 2017. Emeritus Professor of Zoology at the
University of Galway, PhD in evolutionary biology. "20. Extinction and
How to Avoid It." In *Life through Time and Space*. Harvard University
Press. https://doi.org/10.4159/9780674982246; mgm\]

The first of these causes is disease, and specifically those diseases
that are caused by microbes---loosely defined to include both bacteria
and viruses. Inherited diseases can have appalling consequences for
individuals, but they're not a threat to our species. Diseases caused by
animals, such as schistosomiasis, the disease agent here being a
parasitic worm, can also have very adverse effects on the people
suffering from them, but they are unlikely to cause human extinction. In
contrast, [[**diseases** caused by **microbes**]{.mark} are
a]{.underline} potential [[threat]{.mark} to the **continued [survival
of humans]{.mark}** on **planet Earth**.]{.underline}

The reasons for this assertion are as follows. The [shorter the life
cycle of an organism,]{.underline} the [faster it can
evolve]{.underline}. And [when a [disease]{.mark} agent has a very
[short life cycle]{.mark} and its host a very long one, the
**discrepancy** between the two is most likely to result in [an
**evolutionary advantage**]{.mark} to the former]{.underline}. Also, the
changing fates of host species in terms of their population numbers will
be a major factor driving the evolution of the disease agent. Once upon
a time, a few million years ago, the population numbers of
protochimpanzees and protohumans were probably about equal. Now there
are less than half a million chimps and more than 7 billion humans---so
there are about 10,000 humans for every one chimp. If you were a
bacterium currently specializing in chimps, what evolutionary trajectory
would you choose?

When **[antibiotics]{.underline}** were discovered, in the early
twentieth century, they were a boon to medical science. They cured many
bacterial diseases. And to some extent they still do. But, given the
[ability of [bacteria]{.mark} to **[evolve]{.mark} very
[rapidly]{.mark}**, we now live in the age of]{.underline} so-called
**[[superbugs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as MRSA (a label for tough
strains of the Staphylococcus aureus bacterium), which are
[**[resistant]{.mark}** [not]{.mark} just [to]{.mark} [one
**antibiotic**]{.mark} [but]{.mark} to **[lots]{.mark}** of
them]{.underline}. The **[[superbacteria of the]{.mark}
[future]{.mark}]{.underline}** will be even more problematic, and may
**[[constitute an extinction threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What tactics
should we take in order [[to avoid this]{.mark} fate]{.underline}? The
short answer is to [dramatically **[increase]{.mark}** the **funding**
for **[biomedical research]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Superbacteria are a real threat, but the threat posed by viruses is even
greater. Contrary to what some people think, most disease viruses are
unaffected, or only negligibly affected, by antibiotics. If you have
influenza, which is caused by a virus, and you take antibiotics, you
won't be cured by them (though you probably will be helping bacteria to
evolve antibiotic resistance). Viruses are harder to deal with than
bacteria; vaccines work well in some cases, but in other cases we're
still struggling to find an effective one.

Think of the serious viral outbreaks that have affected humans over
recent times. Some of those that most readily spring to mind are
smallpox, Ebola, and AIDS. Smallpox has been eradicated (we think)
through effective vaccination campaigns. Ebola, regrettably, has not; at
the time of writing there is no effective vaccine, but there is much
ongoing research to try to find one.

AIDS is worthy of particular attention because of the part of the body
that the virus concerned attacks, and because future versions of this
type of virus may pose an even greater threat to humanity than the
current versions. All disease viruses target some parts of the body more
than others. But in the case of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
which causes AIDS, it primarily targets cells of the immune system---the
very system whose job it is to protect us from infections.

This is a bit like an enemy state having developed a weapon that only
affects our military personnel: something that causes soldiers to die so
that our enemy can invade our country and enslave our civilian
population. The parallel isn't perfect, because a civilian can become a
soldier, whereas a brain cell cannot become a white blood cell of the
immune system. Nevertheless, the analogy helps to illustrate the dangers
to an organism of hostile agents specifically targeted at that entity's
defense system. As with Ebola, there are no effective AIDS vaccines as
yet. There are some treatments that are partially effective, such as the
drug AZT; also, combinations of drugs can be more effective than single
ones. But not only are these **[[drugs inadequate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
right now, they may become [even less adequate in the
future]{.underline}. Just as with bacteria evolving resistance to
antibiotics, [**[viruses]{.mark}** can [**evolve**
**resistance**]{.mark} to the various agents used against
them.]{.underline}

To [advance **Arctic observing networks**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this

[[Current Arctic observations]{.underline}]{.mark} yield invaluable
information and data that influence global models and forecasts,
national security decisions, community resilience, and economic

efforts [to support]{.mark} **fundamental [understanding]{.mark}** of
[**environmental change** and]{.mark} to **[inform]{.mark} [decision

**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**; (2) Development of a shared

the critical infrastructure needed to achieve this include: satellites,
aircraft, and in-situ technologies for data on sea ice conditions and
wildland fires; vessels for oceanography, fisheries, and harmful algal
bloom monitoring; community-based observations of marine and terrestrial
mammals; atmospheric drop sondes and meteorological balloons for
understanding the connection between Arctic and mid-latitude weather
patterns; and terrestrial stream gages and coastal water level
monitoring stations for early flood warnings.

This report concludes that an Implementation Plan is needed to provide a
system-level view of existing activities[, [a **policy-driven gaps

[[The **nation's ability** to **monitor**, **detect**, and

Arctic Observing Network (U.S. AON) Board prepared this report for the
White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) in response
to a requirement of a Committee Report accompanying the Fiscal Year

Over the past four decades, the issue of climate change has just grown
to encompass interconnected and systemic pressure that exert systemic
pressures on human societies (Bauer, 2011; Ripple et al., 2023). From
freshwater scarcity to extreme weather events, the current shift in the
Earth's climate regime indicates that we are entering a period of
instability as the Holocene equilibrium is no longer consistent due to
long-standing anthropogenic perturbations (Lawrence et al., 2024).
Therefore, climate change is transforming from a scientific concern to a
global security issue that must be addressed on an institutional,
ethical, and legal basis (Goldstein, 2016). As we move out of a
relatively stable planetary regime, [our [**primary concern** as
a]{.mark} **collective** [**species** is to]{.mark} **anticipate** and
**[predict]{.mark}** the [**outcome** of]{.mark} these
**[changes]{.mark}** and their **magnitude**.]{.underline} In other
words, what seems extreme now may well become the normality of the
planet of tomorrow. In this context, the
**[[cryosphere]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- consisting of Earth's ice
sheets, sea ice, **[[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[polar
oceans]{.underline}]{.mark}, glaciers, and snow -- [[is "**ground zero
for climate change**"]{.underline}]{.mark} (ICCI, 2023). Its
[**[systemic destabilization]{.mark}** as a result of continued global
temperature rise [indicates]{.mark} a **[dire vulnerability to
climate]{.mark} regime [disruption]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Over the course of the last five decades, [the **Arctic region** has
warmed nearly four times faster than the global average
rate]{.underline} underlining the rapid change in the polar area, a
phenomenon called **[[Arctic amplification]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Drüke
et al., 2024). As such, the [[**polar region** has]{.mark} a [**specific
centrality** in the **global climate**]{.mark} [system]{.mark} as it is
home of several **[key tipping]{.mark} points**]{.underline} (Armstrong
McKay et al., 2022; Hansen et al., 2016; Lenton, 2012; Lenton et al.,
2019). As defined by Rahmstorf (2024), a tipping point is "a point at
which further development into a fundamentally different state becomes
an unstoppable self-sustained process, driven by reinforcing feedback
effects". To sum up, [the [**influence** of the **polar region** is **so
critical**]{.mark} that it may **[tilt the Earth's climate
regime]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Among the tipping points identified,
**[[permafrost thaw]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is of particular
concern]{.underline} because of its potential for adverse local impacts
and its role **[as a [catalyst for broader, long-term
feedbacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Nitzbon et al., 2024). Given its
potential role in the ongoing climate crisis and the formation of
positive feedback loops, [permafrost thawing is a strategic
issue]{.underline} for the international community. Within this
paradigm, [the [scientific community]{.mark} plays an
**[instrumental]{.mark} role**]{.underline} in implementing a new
international security regime by acting as an operational stakeholder
[[in]{.mark} the [**monitoring** and **analysis** of]{.mark} the
**[biophysical dynamics]{.mark}** in the **polar region**.]{.underline}

3.1. The case of permafrost

Due to the rapid anthropogenic climate change, one of the major threats
to the stability of the Earth's climate regime is related to the thawing
permafrost. Permafrost covers ∼25% of the land surface of the Northern
Hemisphere, partly mapped in the Arctic (i.e., 13--18 million km2). In
total, the permafrost stores an estimated 1100--1500 billion metric tons
of soil organic carbon, which upon thaw can be decomposed into carbon
dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) -- all of them
greenhouse gases (GHG) (Hugelius et al., 2014). In scientific terms,
[[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark} is defined by the temperature at which
the ground remains at or below 0 C degree for at least two consecutive
years. As Westerveld et al. (2023) remind us, "as long as permafrost
stays frozen, the organic carbon within it will remain locked in the
ground". However, an [**[accelerating warming]{.mark}** climate
threatens to [release]{.mark} this [stored]{.mark}
**[carbon]{.mark}**]{.underline} (C) [**[massively]{.mark}** into the
atmosphere [through **widespread microbial
decompositio**]{.mark}**n**]{.underline}**.** While the Arctic
permafrost soils are among the largest reservoirs on Earth, the
long-term [[risk lies]{.mark} in the possibility that the [polar]{.mark}
region could [become]{.mark} a **[C pool]{.mark} source** -- rather than
of a C sink -- [resulting]{.mark} [in]{.mark} a **positive climate
feedback mechanism**, known as the [**permafrost** **carbon
feedback**]{.mark}]{.underline} (PCF) (Miner et al., 2022; Schuur et
al., 2015; See et al., 2024). With respect to the Arctic tundra,
conversion to a C pool source may already be occurring, signaling a
shift in the permafrost regime (Natali et al., 2024). In recent decades,
changes in the thickness of the active layer of permafrost (i.e., the
seasonally unfrozen surface layer) have been observed, suggesting that
the current rate of thawing is faster than predicted by models (Turetsky
et al., 2019; Westerveld et al., 2023). Projections of continued
temperature increase under IPCC Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs,
replacing RCP scenarios) indicate further warming of permafrost, while
the scientific community discusses the potential for non-linear system
behavior. In such a scenario, this process could in turn accelerate PCF
with potentially higher GHG emissions being released to the atmosphere
(Biskaborn et al., 2019; Nitzbon et al., 2024; Schaefer et al., 2014).
According to future projections, estimated GHG emissions from
terrestrial permafrost thaw would range from 100 to 240 billion tons of
C by 2100 based on different climate change scenarios (Meredith et al.,
2019). However, [there is a **[lack of clarity regarding]{.mark}** "the
**timing**, **magnitude** and the **relative [roles]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} CO2 versus [CH4]{.mark} as [feedback
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2021), and
large uncertainties notably [in respect to]{.underline} abrupt thaw
events and [**[biological]{.mark} [interactions]{.mark}** co-occurring
with warming]{.underline} (see for instance Keuper et al., 2020). Given
that the release of C emissions into the atmosphere has a cumulative
effect, the resulting change in the chemical composition of the
atmosphere is projected to persist for several centuries. Furthermore,
CH4 is a short-lived but potent greenhouse gas that [could
[accelerate]{.mark} further **[positive climate feedback
loops]{.mark}**, which could eventually [lead to a **runaway feedback
effect**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this context, scientific
[**[collaboration to monitor terrestrial permafrost]{.mark}** in the
Arctic highlights the **[critical long-term security
implications]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Future emissions are a primary determinant of the warming path over the
medium to longer term; but so are other factors including accelerated
[[**sea**-**ice loss** decreasing]{.mark} **Earth's
[reflectivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and accelerating emissions from
**[[carbon stores]{.underline}]{.mark}** (boreal and tropical forest
fires, reduced ocean efficiency, and **[[permafrost
feedbacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example), though these are
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** systematically [[**incorporated** into
**model**]{.mark} **projection[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} of future
warming.

Another factor is the Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI), which has grown
consistently over the last two decades: a positive EEI "confirms the lag
of the climate system in responding to forcing and implies that
additional global warming will take place even without further forcing
change".104 One of the drivers of increasing EEI has been a reduction in
sulfate aerosol emissions, which are a by-product of burning fossil
fuels, and have a strong cooling impact of 0.5--1°C, but are short-lived
in the atmosphere. Aerosols have been "masking" some of the warming so
far.105

Declining coal use and clean air policies reduce the aerosol impact.
This is our "Faustian bargain":106 as fossil fuel use declines, so will
aerosol emissions which have been offsetting some warming, so that for
the next two decades lower emissions will have little impact on the
warming trend.107 One example: A 5% annual reduction in emissions of a
single greenhouse gas, from 2020 and based on a middle-roademissions
path, has no statistically significant effect on warming for more than
two decades, as compared to a no-mitigation pathway.108

Warming projections

A clear majority of scientists expect warming of more than 3°C, and 82%
expect to see catastrophic impacts of climate change in their lifetime,
according to a 2021 survey by the journal Nature.109 And a survey of
[380 IPCC scientists]{.underline} by The Guardian in 2024 found 80%
foreseeing at least 2.5°C of global heating, and half 3°C or more.110
Many of the scientists [envisage a
"**[semi-dystopian]{.mark}**]{.underline}**["
[future]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with [**[famines]{.mark}**,
**[conflicts]{.mark}** and **mass** **migration**,]{.underline} driven
by [**[heatwaves]{.mark}**, **[wildfires]{.mark}**, **floods** and
**storms**]{.underline} of an intensity and frequency far beyond those
that have already struck

The Climate Scoreboard shows the progress that the national plans
submitted to the UN climate negotiations will make in mitigating climate
change. Their analysis (at September 2024) shows that the national
contributions to date, with no further progress post-pledge period,
result in expected warming in 2100 of 3.2°C (with a range of uncertainty
of 1.9 -- 4.4°C).111 Of course, nations may make further commitments,
but on the other hand many are not on the path to achieving those
commitments they have already made. Similarly, the 2023 IPCC Synthesis
Report said that implemented policies result in projected emissions that
lead to warming of 3.2°C, with a range of 2.2°C to 3.5°C".112

A 2021 climate risk assessment by the pre-eminent UK international
affairs think-tank Chatham House focussed on a RCP4.5 scenario (which
may be too conservative on the future emissions path) and the impacts
that are likely to be locked in for the period 2040--50 unless emissions
drastically decline before 2030 (which they are not!). The scenario had
a mean temperature rise of 2.7°C and a "[plausible [**worst**-**case**
**scenario**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (10% chance) of 3.5°C or more. The
report added that could be an underestimate if [**[tipping
points]{.mark}** are [reached **sooner** than]{.mark} the
**[orthodox]{.mark} [science]{.mark} suggests**]{.underline}.113

Emphasising this point, a rating system to evaluate the plausibility of
climate model simulations in the IPCC's latest report shows that models
that lead to potentially catastrophic warming "are plausible and should
be taken seriously".114

There are big questions about the size of the aerosol forcing, and the
related issue of how sensitive the climate is to changes in greenhouse
gases, which remain an issue of scientific contention. New climate
history research published in December 2023, based on a study of the
last 66 million years, concluded that [[global
temperature]{.underline}]{.mark} may be [**[more sensitive]{.mark}** to
CO2 levels [than]{.mark} **current [models]{.mark}
[estimate]{.mark}**.]{.underline}115 It showed that the last time CO2
levels were as high as today was around 14 million year ago, which is
longer than previous estimates, and that climate sensitivity --- the
amount of warming resulting from a doubling of atmospheric CO2 --- may
be between 5°C and 8°C, compared to the IPCC orthodoxy of 1.5--4.5°C.

07 THE PHYSICAL RISKS ARE CASCADING & SYSTEMIC

The evidence from tipping points alone suggests that we are in a state
of planetary emergency: both the risk and urgency of the situation are
acute \[\...\] If [damaging **[tipping cascades]{.mark}** can
occur]{.underline} and a global tipping point cannot be ruled out, then
[this is [an **existential threat to
civilisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Prof. Tim Lenton and colleagues,
"Climate tipping points --- too risky to bet against"116

The [[physical risks are **non**-**linear**, **cascading**,
**systemic**]{.mark} and]{.underline} largely
**[[irreversible]{.underline}]{.mark}** on human time frames. Climate
[[models]{.mark} do not adequately represent all processes]{.underline}
and are likely to [**[underestimate]{.mark}** the
[risks.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Many elements of the climate system exhibit **[[tipping
points]{.underline}]{.mark}** or thresholds at which a small change
causes a larger, more critical change to be initiated, [[taking]{.mark}
that [system]{.mark}]{.underline} from one state [[to]{.mark} a
discretely different [state]{.mark} far [**less conducive** to **human
survival**]{.mark}]{.underline} and prosperity (see section 3 above).
For example, a **[[polar ice sheet]{.underline}]{.mark}** may reach a
**[[temperature]{.mark} [threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}** beyond which
[continuing and [accelerated]{.mark} **[ice mass loss]{.mark}
occurs**]{.underline}, even without any additional rise in temperature,
and such a change may take decades to centuries to be fully realized
before a new (ice-free) system stability occurs.

Such threshold changes may be [[**abrupt** and
**irreversible**]{.underline}]{.mark} on relevant time frames. And [once
the threshold is passed, returning conditions to pre-threshold
conditions may not **restore the system**.]{.underline} This is known as
hysteresis, or bifurcation of a system, where it may be more difficult,
or impossible, for a system to return to its previous state. Put more
simply: the path from A to B is not the same as the path from from B to
A. [**Ice sheets** are a good example.]{.underline}

A chilling 2015 report on Thresholds and closing windows: Risks of
irreversible cryosphere climate change warned that the Paris commitments
will not prevent the Earth "crossing into the zone of irreversible
thresholds" in polar and mountain glacier regions, and that crossing
these boundaries may "result in processes that cannot be halted unless
temperatures return to levels below pre-industrial" (emphasis added).117
For example, the tipping point for the most vulnerable West Antarctic
glaciers is probably between 0.5°C and 1°C, but cooling the planet back
to that range would not create the conditions for their
re-establishment.

And in 2024, researchers again warned of "[**overconfidence** in climate
overshoot]{.underline}", that is, exceeding a temperature target for
decades, on the assumption that negative emissions technology will be
able to later reduce the heating and restore conditions as if there had
been no overshoot. Extinctions caused by overshoot are one example. They
show that "global and regional climate change and associated risks after
an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it\... the
possibility that global warming could be reversed many decades into the
future might be of limited relevance for
**[[adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}** planning today \[because\]
temperature reversal could be [[**undercut** by]{.mark}]{.underline}
strong Earth-system **[[feedbacks]{.underline}]{.mark}** [resulting in
high near-term and **continuous long-term warming**]{.underline}**\...**
[[Only **rapid**]{.mark} **near-term [emission reductions]{.mark}** are
[effective]{.mark} in **reducing climate risks**]{.underline}."118

Changes in one element of the climate system may also trigger an
unforeseen chain or cascade of events in which one event in a system has
a negative effect on other related components. For example, the mutual
interaction of individual climate tipping points and/or abrupt,
non-linear changes, may lead to more profound changes to the system as a
whole, and interactions between these climate systems could lower the
critical temperature thresholds at which each tipping point is
passed.119

Together, tipping point thresholds, non-linear change and cascading
events represent systemic risks, that is, the risk of a breakdown of an
entire system rather than simply the failure of individual parts:

More frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events, as
well as changes in average climate conditions, are expected to continue
to damage infrastructure, ecosystems, and social systems that provide
essential benefits to communities\... Extreme weather and
[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}-related [[impacts]{.underline}]{.mark} on
one system can result in [**increased risks** or failures
in]{.underline} other [**critical systems,** including **[water]{.mark}
resources**, **[food]{.mark}** **production** and **distribution**,
**[energy]{.mark}** and **[transportation]{.mark}**, **[public
health]{.mark}**, international **[trade]{.mark}**, and **[national
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The full extent of climate change risks
to interconnected systems, many of which [span]{.underline} regional and
**[national boundaries]{.underline}**, is often greater than the sum of
risks to individual sectors.120

Systemic change means climate elements can tip from one state to an
entirely different one with a [**[sudden shock]{.mark}** that may
**permanently** [alter]{.mark} the [way **the planet
works**]{.mark}.]{.underline}121 In the physical interactions among the
[Greenland]{.underline} and West Antarctic ice sheets, the Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation and the Amazon rainforest, the
[**[polar sheets]{.mark}** are]{.underline} often [the [**initiators**
of **cascade events**]{.mark}]{.underline},122 with Greenland and West
Antarctica at risk of passing their tipping points within the 1.5°C--2°C
Paris range (and there is evidence they have already done so).

[**Such** **[changes]{.mark}** are [not]{.mark} adequately
[**incorporated** into]{.mark} **climate [models]{.mark}**]{.underline}:
"[Change]{.underline} can [[come]{.mark} about abruptly and even
**[catastrophically]{.mark}**]{.underline}\... Predictive models are the
lifeblood of climate science, and the foundation upon which political
responses to the climate and ecological crisis are often based. But
their ability to predict such large-scale disruptive events is severely
limited\... The IPCC's estimates of how much CO2 we can still emit to be
on the safe side explicitly leave out many known large-scale disruptions
or tipping points because of insufficient understanding or because
models cannot capture them."123

Researchers have also investigated how changes in forest degradation and
monsoon circulation are interlinked: "It turns out that forest loss
caused by direct deforestation, droughts, and fires might vastly
contribute to a changing climate in South America and could drive the
coupled Amazon rainforest/ South American monsoon circulation system
past a tipping point \[and\] suggest an upcoming regime shift of the
Amazon ecosystem."124

If [cascades]{.underline} [coalesce]{.underline}, there is the
[possibility of "**[Hothouse Earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}". In 2018, a
group of eminent scientists explored the potential for
[[**self-reinforcing** **positive feedbacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
major elements of the climate system feedbacks and their mutual
interaction to [drive the Earth System climate to a **point of no
return**]{.underline}, whereby further warming would become
self-sustaining (that is, without further human perturbations), and
prevent temperature stabilisation, driving the system to what they
termed a "[Hothouse Earth]{.underline}".125 In plain terms, [humans
would **lose control** and **[lack]{.mark}** the [**capacity** to stop
**cascading warming**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the researchers warned
that "we are in a climate emergency\... this is [an **[existential
threat to civilisation]{.mark}**".]{.underline}126 This planetary
threshold could exist at a temperature rise as low as 2°C, possibly even
in the 1.5°C--2°C range.127 In other words, we may have already arrived
at this point, but conclusive evidence of this moment requires
hindsight.

08 A FOCUS ON THE PLAUSIBLE WORST-CASE RISK SCENARIOS IS NEEDED

Facing a future of accelerating climate change while blind to worst-case
scenarios is naive risk management at best and fatally foolish at worst.
Dr Luke Kemp and colleagues, 1 August 2022 128

Climate risks are existential and emerging faster than forecast. Their
non-linear and cascading nature make them difficult to predict, so
particular attention must be paid to the plausible worst-case scenarios,
because that is where the greatest possible damage lies.

A 2018 Australian Senate Inquiry found climate change is "a current and
existential national security risk".129 It recognised that Australia and
its neighbours are in the region most exposed to climate impacts, and
that climate change is threatening the health of Australians, their
communities, businesses and the economy; [heightening]{.underline} the
[severity of **natural hazards**; increasing the spread of **infectious
[diseases]{.mark}**; and creating growing water **[insecurity]{.mark}
threats** to agriculture]{.underline}. All members of the Pacific
Islands Forum, including Australia, supported the 2018 Boe Declaration
at which all Forum leaders "reaffirm that climate change remains the
single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the
peoples of the Pacific and our commitment to progress the implementation
of the Paris Agreement".130

American researchers say that climate change and its impacts "are
emerging faster than scientists previously thought, and are consistent
with observations that we and other colleagues have made identifying a
pattern in assessments of climate research of underestimation of certain
key climate indicators, and therefore underestimation of the threat of
climate disruption".131

How we analyse risk, or the threat, of climate disruption depends on the
nature of the risk. Nick Spencer, former chair of the UK Institute and
Faculty of Actuaries, explains: "Systemic risks, including climate
change, are multiplying and intensifying, with their tipping points
posing the threat of irreversible harm. Traditional risk management
approaches simply don't recognise these characteristics. There is a need
to embrace complex risk analysis to help us navigate systemic failure
and the disruption from these connected crises."

The risk of ruin

In risk management, there are potential events so destructive that they
are termed catastrophic because of their capacity for human death or
suffering on a massive scale, such that societies may never fully
recover. This may also be called existential risk or, in actuarial
terms, the "risk of ruin", which colloquially in financial and gambling
circles, is the risk of "losing everything".

[[Catastrophic]{.mark} [events]{.mark} **include [nuclear
war]{.mark},**]{.underline} climate change, biosecurity including
[**[pandemics]{.mark}**, and **[disruptive tech]{.mark}nologies** such
as **AI**]{.underline}. The seventh annual report of the Global
Challenges Foundation on such risks added "**[[ecological
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**" to the list,132 whilst the World
Economic Forum's 2024 Global Risk Report found that more than half of
those surveyed believed that the [[risk of **global
catastrophe**]{.mark} **was** **high** or **[extreme]{.mark}** over the
next decade]{.underline}, with [**climate-related** risks again given
top ranking]{.underline}.133

In the mapping of potential threats, the greatest risk lies at the
high-end (or "fat tail") of the range of outcomes, which should be given
particular attention. A **[[fat-tail risk]{.underline}]{.mark}** is the
[[probability]{.mark} of events with **[high]{.mark}er
impacts**]{.underline} occurring [than]{.underline} might be expected
under a [normal probability distribution.]{.underline} [[Focusing
on]{.mark} the [most likely]{.mark} outcomes [creates]{.mark} a
**[false]{.mark} sense of [security]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

An emergency exists if the world is approaching a global [[**cascade**
of **tipping points**]{.mark} that [leads to a "**hothouse"
climate**]{.mark} state]{.underline}: "Cascading effects might be
common\... examples are starting to be observed."134 Thus [[**climate
change** is an existential risk to **human
civilisation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (contemporary society).

Hitherto, the study of Arctic microbial genomics has typically entailed
either laboratory-based analyses, field surveys or plot scale
experiments \[67, 71, 98\]. These are most pertinent for understanding
the molecular ecology of the cryosphere at scales of microns to metres,
with further insights typically extrapolative. However, it is the
[[**emergent macroscale** effects of **Arctic microbial

**microscopic processes**]{.mark} to be [studied at]{.mark} the scale of
**[entire landscapes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This scale mismatch between
processes occurring at the \<101 µm scale and their effects at the
101--105 km2 scale (a chasm spanning up to 14 orders of magnitude) makes
emergent effects challenging to study.

[The [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} has been inhabited by humans for
millennia. It is now home to four million people. Moreover, the rapid
changes in Arctic climate expected this century are leading to renewed
interest in the economic potential of the Arctic as mineral resources,
maritime navigation and tourism all become more accessible. This [[poses
microbial **risks** and **opportunities**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[117\].

Firstly, growing commercial and political interests coupled with
increased logistical accessibility is likely to stimulate interest in
Arctic bioprospecting \[23\]. [**[Adaptations]{.mark} for life** in the
cold [found]{.mark} with[in]{.mark} the reservoir of **[Arctic genomic
diversity]{.mark}** can be **[industrially useful]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[118\]. Examples include [enzymes]{.underline} with low temperature
optima \[119\], low-alcohol yeast \[120\], antifreeze and ice-binding
proteins \[121\], and potential
**[[antimicrobials]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[122\] (Table 1, fully
referenced and expanded in Table S1, available with the online version
of this article). To date, the majority of [antimicrobial compounds and
cold-active enzymes have relied on cultured isolates]{.underline}, which
are either screened directly for activity \[122\] or genome sequenced;
followed by the cloning and expression of candidate genes or gene
clusters in a heterologous host \[123\]. These strategies rely on the
isolation and genome-sequencing of microbes, which is
[limiting]{.underline} because: (i) fully sequenced genomes of Arctic
strains are limited in number (see below), and (ii) many microbes remain
uncultivated. In addition, [advances in sequence-based and functional
**metagenomic approaches**]{.underline} \[124\] offer promising
approaches to mine and exploit such potential. For example, specially
engineered [heterologous expression hosts, such as the ArcticExpress
Escherichia coli competent cells]{.underline} (Agilent Technologies) and
Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125 strain \[123\] are [noteworthy for
being products of cryospheric bioprospecting, and tools by which
**[further]{.mark}** **functional [exploration]{.mark}** [of this
**environment** can be **accomplished**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
ArcticExpress cells co-express the chaperonin system Cpn60 and Cpn10
from Oleispira antarctica , which helps to ensure the proper folding of
cold-active proteins and increase the growth rate of E. coli at low
temperatures \[125\]. Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125, however, is
of cryospheric origin, and displays increased solubility and secretion
of protein products over other Gram-negative expression hosts.
Meanwhile, [[**improvements** in **sequencing**
**technologies**]{.underline}]{.mark} have resulted in the assembly of
longer contigs, with [**[deeper coverage than]{.mark} ever before**,
[unlocking]{.mark} types of [analyses]{.mark} previously available only
to whole-genome-sequenced cultured organisms]{.underline}. Tools such as
antiSMASH \[126\], for example, [can be used on **[metagenomic
datasets]{.mark}**]{.underline} (contigs or MAGs) to detect biosynthetic
gene clusters responsible for the [[synthesis of]{.mark} industrially
useful [compounds, such as **antibiotics**]{.mark}, fatty acids,
polysaccharides, antioxidants and UV-protective pigments]{.underline}.
However, the greatest improvements in bioprospecting will likely come
from the synergy of sequence-based and functional methods, because an
[understanding of the [**genomic** **background**]{.mark} of the source
organism (see below) is [**vital** for]{.mark} the **strategic
[genetic]{.mark}** [**engineering**]{.mark} **of suitable hosts** and

[The]{.underline} frigid waters of the **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
may [**[harbor]{.mark}** the secret to a totally **[new type of
antibiotic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, new research suggests.

Scientists have discovered that [[substances made by **Arctic Ocean
microbes**]{.underline}]{.mark} called actinobacteria can
[[stop]{.underline} **[harmful bacteria]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from
growing and **[prevent]{.mark}** them from **causing**
**[disease]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Around 70% of existing antibiotics were discovered in actinobacteria,
most of whom live in soil on land. However, [**[bacteria]{.mark}** are
[**becoming increasingly resistant** to]{.mark} existing
**[antibiotics]{.mark}**, meaning that [**new drugs** are **urgently
needed**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

So, researchers looked to sea-dwelling actinobacteria for new
antibiotics. The [[sea]{.mark}-[dwelling microbes]{.mark}]{.underline}
are thought to [[produce]{.mark} a more **[chemically diverse]{.mark}
array** of [compounds]{.mark}]{.underline} than their land-dwelling
counterparts make. This is because of the selective pressure created by
the extreme fluctuations in pressure, temperature, salt concentrations
and light levels that occur in marine environments.

In the new study, scientists analyzed hundreds of unknown compounds that
had been extracted from actinobacteria living inside invertebrates. The
samples were collected during an expedition to the Arctic Ocean in 2020.
Specifically, they tested how the compounds affected a pathogenic type
of E. coli called enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). These bacteria infect
intestinal cells and cause severe diarrhea, particularly in children.

Next, scientists looked at whether compounds produced by four species of
actinobacteria could stop EPEC bacteria from infecting lab-grown cells.
They found that two compounds had particularly strong antibacterial
properties: one from a strain of actinobacteria from the Rhodococcus
genus and another from a strain belonging to the Kocuria genus. They
described their findings in a paper published Friday (Aug. 30) in the
journal Frontiers in Microbiology.

The compounds stopped EPEC bacteria from attaching to the cell surface
and injecting substances that allow the microbes to hijack their
molecular machinery and cause disease, the team found.

However, while the Kocuria bacteria produced compounds that slowed the
growth of EPEC bacteria, the compound from Rhodococcus bacteria didn\'t.
If the bacteria are alive, but harmless to a host, there is less
selection pressure for them to develop resistance to the compound. As
such, the Rhodococcus compound could be a more promising candidate for a
new antibiotic, the team said in a statement.

[[**A lot more work** must be done]{.mark} before either of these
compounds could be brought to market.]{.underline}

\"We have so far only done in vitro \[lab\] studies, so we are still
very far from knowing if the compounds have any actual significance in
terms of clinical use,\" Päivi Tammela, study co-author and a professor
of pharmaceutical biology at the University of Helsinki in Finland, told
Live Science.

For instance, a big hurdle to overcome is figuring out how to produce
larger amounts of these compounds that would allow scientists to study
their structures and biological activity in more detail, Tammela said.

Nonetheless, the team has high hopes for the future of this research,
with Tammela stating that [it]{.underline} [is \"**absolutely\"
possible** that [many **more** of **these compounds are waiting to be
discovered in the depths.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Lack of U.S. Arctic research creates a [void]{.underline} China fills with [observation presence]{.underline} to unlock scientific dominance. [Federal]{.underline} agency capacity is the [brink]{.underline}.

Six weeks into Donald [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} presidential term
has seen [major **[cuts]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and [mass
**firings**]{.mark}]{.underline} across the board. The [[US Arctic
research]{.mark}]{.underline} community [is]{.underline} now [facing
imminent [**cutbacks** at]{.mark} a **[dire expense]{.mark}** for the
**entire region**]{.underline}. The **[[void left by the
US]{.underline}]{.mark}** may be [[filled by]{.mark} other non-Arctic
[actors looking for **a way in,**]{.mark} such as
**[China]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The weeks following Trump's inauguration has seen significant cuts and
mass firings of federal employees in the US. The Department of
Government Efficiency ([DOGE]{.underline}), spearheaded by Elon Musk, is
reaching far into the government apparatus, finding ways to cut costs
and eliminate threats to the new order.

The [Arctic research]{.underline} community in the US is also [facing
severe cutbacks and reduced funding]{.underline}, [prompting serious
concerns]{.underline} about the future of Arctic research and research
diplomacy in the region.

Three years after [Russia invaded **Ukraine**]{.underline} and the
subsequent [loss of all scientific cooperation with Russia]{.underline},
the [[region]{.underline}]{.mark} could now be [[**on the** **brink** of
losing]{.mark}]{.underline} yet [[a]{.mark}nother **[major
player]{.mark}** in the North.]{.underline}

As climate change continues to be the biggest threat to the Arctic, many
worry about the [[**implications** of]{.mark} the **[US federal
cuts]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the]{.underline} region\'s
[[climate]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Targeting climate research

While information regarding the mass firings and cutbacks executed by
DOGE is still uncertain, sources such as the New York Magazine report
that 30,000 federal workers have been given notice. The mass firings
have mainly targeted probationary workers, 200,000 of the total of 2.4
million federal workers.

The journal Science recently reported that the mass firings were
decimating US science agencies, saying the \"layoffs decimated the foot
soldiers of many health and science agencies, sweeping up early-career
scientists as well as old hands in new positions.\"

The [Trump]{.underline} administration has consistently [targeted
climate research]{.underline} by [cutting grants]{.underline} and other
support for any science endeavors that focus on climate change. Many of
the US president\'s January executive orders focused on cutting or
eradicating climate programs specifically in an effort to
[roll]{.underline} [back environmental and climate change
initiatives]{.underline} that were implemented under the Biden
administration.

The US has now withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and essentially
stopped wind power development. In addition, the Trump administration is
trying to undo the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in
climate and energy in American history.

Even the term \'climate change\' is now subject to severe restrictions.
It has been removed from official websites, grants, and other support,
and researchers must be careful not to use it if they want to keep their
funding.

Project 2025 is coming to fruition

The deconstruction of climate research initiatives and institutions is a
continuation of the work Trump commenced in his first term by rolling
back more than 125 environmental rules and policies, according to Time
magazine. It also corresponds to the agenda set in Project 25, the
political initiative to reshape the US federal government, published by
the conservative Heritage Foundation.

President Trump distanced himself from the Project 2025 initiative
during his campaign but has implemented much of the project\'s agenda
since taking office.

The initiative calls for an increase in oil and gas drilling through
eradicating environmental protections, as well as repealing the
Inflation Reduction Act introduced by the Biden administration.

Consequences for the climate

The attack on climate research incites far-reaching reactions, also in
the Arctic. Climate warming takes place at a much higher rate in the
Arctic than the rest of the world, making climate intervention a
pressing matter.

Mia Bennett, a political geographer at the University of Washington,
says that although the [[US]{.mark} mass [**firings** and **cuts** in
funding]{.mark} risk **[losing]{.mark} the** [ability to]{.mark} closely
[**monitor** **climate change**]{.mark} and understand its accelerating
nature]{.underline}, we already know a lot about what is happening with
the climate and the fact that we need to act.

\"We know we need to reduce carbon emissions, and yet not enough action
has been taken. That is why it is not only the cuts to climate research
but the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, too, which are also deeply
worrying,\" she says.

One scientific agency facing [mass firings]{.underline} is the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ([[NOAA]{.underline}]{.mark}). At
the end of last week, reports emerged stating that between 600 and 900
employees had lost their jobs at the world-renowned center. While exact
numbers are still unclear, reports say that several hundred more are
expected to leave voluntarily through the so-called deferred resignation
program.

The **[[NOAA plays a massive role in Arctic
research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, perhaps most notably through the Arctic
Report Card, published annually as an overview of the environmental
developments in the Arctic. The NOAA cuts were also heralded in the
Project 25 initiative.

Bennett says, \"[NOAA]{.underline} maintains numerous satellites that
observe the Arctic. For decades, these satellites have [provided crucial
data about features like sea ice to **decision-makers**]{.underline} and
residents in the Arctic alike[.]{.underline} The [[**cuts** to **NOAA**
mean everything]{.mark}]{.underline} from the annual Arctic report card
to sea ice forecasts [may fall by the wayside. This doesn't only
**[jeopardize]{.mark}** **[science]{.mark}** and **weather
[forecasting]{.mark},**]{.underline} but [[**human** **lives**]{.mark},
too.\"]{.underline}

\"In addition, [cuts]{.underline} to NOAA alarmingly
[indicate]{.underline} that we may [[lose]{.mark} the ability to
maintain **[real-time monitoring]{.mark}** and issue sufficient early
warnings of potentially dangerous weather systems]{.underline} like
hurricanes. Hurricanes are considered a natural disaster, but the
reckless actions of the Trump administration indicate how much the
consequences of these events are socially produced, too.\"

The field of [Arctic science]{.underline} is particularly [vulnerable
after Russia invaded [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} three years ago.
Following the full-scale attack, all Arctic science cooperation with the
country was lost. As Russia constitutes half of the Arctic, [the war has
also **significantly [impacted polar science]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Arctic science cooperation efforts]{.underline}, particularly
[regarding **[environmental surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, have
now [**[lacked 50% of]{.mark} the [data]{.mark}** for three
years.]{.underline}

[[Now]{.mark} that the **[US]{.mark} is [taking steps to
diminish]{.mark}** [its **role in Arctic science**]{.mark}, this
**[creates a void]{.mark}** that [**others are eager** to fill, such as
**China**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Many researchers believe **[[science]{.mark} to be [China\'s way into
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In an HNN article from October 2024,
researcher Tim Reilly from the University of Cambridge emphasized how
**[China [utilizes scientific motives to access the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He explained that China is gathering some
of the best Arctic climate Big Data, [[establishing itself as a **major
player**]{.mark} **in the region.**]{.underline}

Bennett also believes that the [[current]{.underline} [US strategy
toward polar research **bodes well for China:**]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"[China has already [risen]{.mark} quickly [as a **scientific
powerhouse**]{.mark} in the polar regions]{.underline} since the
beginning of the 2000s. [[With **Russia and the US** both **out of the
picture**]{.mark} so to speak, [China will have **ample opportunities**
to]{.mark} fund and **[lead Arctic research]{.mark}**,\"]{.underline}
she says and continues:

\"However, lacking Arctic territory and facing varying challenges in
collaboration with the other six Arctic states besides the US and
Russia, Chinese research in the Arctic may focus on oceanography,
atmospheric studies, and other research that can take place in the
global commons rather than on land. If [it [continues to face
**challenges accessing**]{.mark} **Arctic
[territory]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [China may]{.underline}
[[also]{.underline}]{.mark} work to further [popularize Arctic [research
based on]{.mark} remote methods **like [satellite]{.mark}
imaging.\"**]{.underline}

\"[With the [US]{.mark} administration **[waging a war on Arctic
research]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially in relation to climate and
Indigenous Peoples, and [**[observations in
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} basically
**[[unobtainable]{.underline}]{.mark}** except through remote sensing,
[it will be [**tremendously challenging** to **maintain**]{.mark}
**robust pan-[Arctic observing]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[**[networks]{.underline}**]{.mark}, which have been [**[so
important]{.mark}** to]{.underline} building a better [understanding of
the Arctic]{.underline} at a regional scale since at least the end of
the Cold War,\" Bennett concludes.

[[China's pursuit of great **power status**]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[drawing]{.mark} it [to]{.mark} the **frozen reaches** of the world's
**polar regions**]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} both **[[the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Antarctic, [[China]{.mark}
has]{.underline} undertaken ambitious expeditions and [[**developed**
**world**-**class research facilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}**.** These
investments have [[**elevated** **China**]{.mark}**'s** voice in polar
affairs and afforded it an [opportunity to shape]{.mark} the [**emerging
geopolitical landscape**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Its]{.mark} growing [physical footprint]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
world's most remote frontiers also serves to [[advance
**China's**]{.mark} **broader [strategic]{.mark}** and **[military
interests]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

In the Arctic, melting ice sheets present a host of significant
challenges for the global community. While leaders in Beijing are
clear-eyed about the threats posed by climate change, Chinese
strategists also see a potential silver lining.

The changing Arctic environment is expected to open new shipping routes
that could reduce transit times for seaborne trade and make it easier
for China to access the region's natural resources.

Yet without sovereign jurisdiction in the Arctic, China leans on
partnerships with other states to further its interests.

[[China]{.mark} [has]{.mark} two **[permanent research
stations]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline}, one located in Norway's
Svalbard archipelago and the other in Iceland. Both sites support a
diverse range of research, from marine ecology to atmospheric physics.

A third facility being utilized by China in northern Sweden is under
scrutiny due to suspected ties to the People's Liberation Army (PLA),
jeopardizing China\'s access to the site.

Beijing faces mounting roadblocks elsewhere. Several Arctic
countries---including [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates---have
[**voiced concerns** about China's presence]{.mark} in the
region.]{.underline}

Left with few other options, [[China]{.mark} is stepping up its
investments in Russia as it [looks to Moscow as]{.mark} its **[strategic
partner]{.mark} of choice** [in the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This may prove to be China's best path forward as both the climate and
geopolitical competition heat up in the Arctic.

Despite being situated some 1,400 km (nearly 900 miles) south of the
Arctic circle, [China has styled itself a "near-Arctic state" and
declared its ambitio[ns to become a "**polar great
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}**"** (极地强国) by 2030.

A 2018 Arctic policy white paper asserts that developments in the region
have "a vital bearing" on China and lays out Beijing's vision for
utilizing the region's natural resources and shaping Arctic governance.

[Beijing has sought to access the region largely [through
**scientific**]{.mark}]{.underline} and commercial
**[[ventures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which officials claim give it the
"right to speak" on Arctic affairs.

While **[[China\'s Arctic research]{.underline}]{.mark}** is primarily
focused on **[[advancing scientific
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**---contributing to significant
discoveries related to sea ice composition, space weather, and marine
life---these accomplishments also [serve **Beijing\'s broader strategic
objectives.**]{.underline}

[[China's Arctic research ecosystem]{.underline}]{.mark} fits within a
larger bureaucracy that has historically **[[support]{.mark}ed
[Beijing\'s geopolitical ambitions]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Until recently, [China\'s]{.underline} [expansive polar research
program]{.underline} was overseen by the State Oceanic Administration
(SOA), [which **[provide]{.mark}d [critical technical support]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} China\'s]{.underline} controversial construction and
[**[militarization]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} artificial islands in the
[S]{.mark}]{.underline}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea.

A 2018 government restructuring transferred most of the SOA\'s
responsibilities to the powerful new Ministry of Natural Resources,
keeping [[**China\'s polar** **programs** and]{.mark} [S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea **[research]{.mark} activities [under one
roof.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[China's [**research expeditions** in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
often involve extensive oceanographic surveys and acoustic modeling,
which mirror some of its activities in the South China Sea, where a
[thorough understanding]{.underline} of the region's waters was also
[[**essential** for]{.mark} the **[PLA]{.mark} [Navy]{.mark}** [to
**operate** ]{.mark}**effectively[.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The [[connections between **China\'s polar research**]{.mark}
**programs** [and]{.mark} the **[PLA]{.mark}** have **[raised]{.mark}
alarms** about the]{.underline} potential **[[security risks]{.mark} in
the Arctic]{.underline}**. This is perhaps best on display in Sweden,
where China began operating its first overseas satellite ground station
in 2016, at the Esrange Space Center near Kiruna.

In 2020, the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), which manages Esrange,
opted not to renew its contracts with China over concerns that the
station could be used for military intelligence gathering and
surveillance. SSC's decision extended beyond just Esrange to its other
ground stations in South America and Australia. It remains unclear,
however, when the contracts expire and if China's access to SSC
facilities has been severed.

The concerns surrounding China\'s activities at Esrange are indicative
of the broader pushback that China faces. Over the past decade, several
Chinese efforts have been blocked or rescinded by Arctic states for
national security reasons.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has [voiced similar
warnings]{.underline}. The 2019 Department of Defense report on China's
military power suggested that "[civilian [research]{.mark} could
[support]{.mark} a **[strengthened]{.mark}** [**Chinese** **military**
**presence**]{.mark} in the **Arctic Ocean.**]{.underline}**"** The
Biden administration's October 2022 Arctic strategy likewise asserted
that China has used its **[[scientific
engagements]{.underline}]{.mark}** "to [conduct [**dual**-**use
research**]{.mark} with **intelligence** or **military**
applications."]{.underline}

Military-civilian mixing is the main way for great powers to achieve a
polar military presence.

\~ China\'s 2020 Science of Military Strategy textbook

[China's own strategic writings make clear that the **PLA has its sights
on the region.**]{.underline}

The 2020 edition of [Science of Military Strategy]{.underline}---the
most recent edition of an influential textbook on military thinking
published by [China's National Defense University---states]{.underline}
bluntly that "[**[military-civilian mixing]{.mark}** is the main way for
great powers to [achieve a **polar military**
**presence**]{.mark}]{.underline}." It adds that China should "give full
play to the role of military forces in supporting polar scientific
research and other operations."

The dual-use nature of Arctic research **[epitomizes [China's
military-civil fusion]{.mark}]{.underline}** (MCF)
[strategy]{.underline}, which aims to [marshal civilian resources to
support the PLA]{.underline}, and ultimately to [fuse together China's
**various national strategies**]{.underline} to simultaneously advance
security and development goals. President Xi Jinping has significantly
elevated the importance of MCF, and it is unsurprising that this
thinking is being applied to the Arctic.

Courting the Bear

Concerns about the potential military applications of Chinese scientific
research are not new, but recent events have brought them into sharper
focus. The conflict in **[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
[**[deepened]{.mark}** **political** fault lines]{.underline}, leaving
many European governments viewing [[Beijing and
Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} as [**[increasingly aligned]{.mark}**
against democratic states]{.underline}. Finland's recent accession to
NATO and Sweden's push for membership have further strained their
relationship with China.

In this emerging geopolitical landscape, China's prospects of expanding
its presence in the Arctic via Nordic states look increasingly dim and
its partnership with Russia appears to be taking center stage.

[China has long viewed Russia as a gateway to the Arctic]{.underline}.
The two countries began holding official dialogues on the Arctic more
than a decade ago, but Russia has historically bristled at China's push
into its far north. Russia initially opposed China's campaign to become
an observer state of the Arctic Council, and in 2012, it blocked Chinese
research vessels from conducting surveys along the Northern Sea Route.

Part of Moscow's concern likely stems from the fact that the Russian
military operates some of its most sensitive strategic assets there,
including ballistic missile submarines, strategic test sites, missile
defense systems, and advanced radar arrays.

This dynamic may now be changing. The war in [Ukraine]{.underline} has
[left **Russia** **increasingly** **isolated** and **reliant** on China
for crucial **investments in technology** and
infrastructure.]{.underline}

The conflict has also left the Arctic Council in flux, as Russia has
been shunned by the remaining member states, and China has said it will
refuse to recognize the body without Russia's participation.

Chinese scholars have previously analyzed how best to gain a foothold in
the Russian Arctic. In 2019, prominent academics from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and Fuzhou University conducted a study to identify
which Russian ports along the strategic Northern Sea Route hold the
greatest potential for facilitating Chinese access to the region.

The report ranked 13 Russian ports based on five primary factors:
natural conditions, infrastructure, port operation, interior
environment, and geographic location. It also assessed 17 secondary
factors, including "strategic value."

Major Chinese firms have already homed in on several of the key ports
identified in the study. Over the last seven years, a subsidiary of the
state-owned defense industry giant China Poly Group has poured \$300
million into a coal terminal in Murmansk and agreed to develop a
deepwater port at Arkhangelsk.

Chinese financers also provided up to 60 percent of the capital for
Russia's Yamal liquefied natural gas project terminating in the port
city of Sabetta. The project is considered the "crown jewel" of
Russia\'s investments in the Northern Sea Route and there are hopes it
could produce up to 926 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas
from the South Tambey field.

Yamal Natural Gas Plant

China is looking to expand its presence in Russia's mineral sector as
well. In January 2023, the China Communications Construction Company
(CCCC) signed a deal with Russia\'s Rustitan to help develop the
Pizhemskoye titanium and quartz deposits in the Komi Republic near the
Arctic Circle.

The sprawling CCCC gained international notoriety for being one of the
24 entities that the Trump administration sanctioned for supporting
China's construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea.

The project is a key pillar of the Kremlin's long-term strategy to
transform the Northern Sea Route into a major throughway of global trade
and includes the development of a deepwater port at Indiga and the
construction of a five- to six-billion dollar Sosnogorsk--Indiga railway
connection.

Russian president Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} has [cleared]{.mark} the
**political runway** for [**China's** **deepening
involvement**]{.mark}]{.underline}**.** In a high-profile March 2023
meeting in Moscow, Putin told Xi, "We see cooperation with Chinese
partners in [[developing]{.mark} the transit potential of the
**[N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea [R]{.mark}oute**]{.underline} as
promising." If successful, [these projects]{.underline} could [further

Over the last two decades, [China]{.underline} has significantly
[expanded its polar **agenda** and **activities**]{.underline}. It is a
[**long-term [strategic priority]{.mark}** [for China to establish
itself as]{.mark} a]{.underline} legitimate and [influential [**polar**
**stakeholder**]{.mark} with a permanent presence]{.underline} and
access to conduct various activities **[[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Antarctic. In Chinese strategic
considerations and plans, the polar regions, together with the deep
seabed and outer space, are [categorized as]{.underline} "[strategic
spaces]{.underline}" \[zhanlüe kongjian\] or "**[[new strategic
frontiers]{.underline}]{.mark}**" \[zhanlüe xinjiang yu\].1

China's growing emphasis on ensuring itself an advantageous position in
regulating and controlling access to these new strategic frontiers is
often viewed as stemming from an expectation that these domains will be
important for great-power struggles over critical resources and
geopolitical influence.2 This is undoubtedly a key part of China's
motivation. However, [there is]{.underline} also [a]{.underline}
[[**strong link between** China's efforts to ensure its "**polar
stakeholder**" position and achieve its "**global scientific power"
ambition**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beijing sees [these new strategic
frontiers]{.underline} as challenging areas in which to operate,
resulting in [constant pressure on **Chinese**]{.underline}
**[researchers]{.underline}**, engineers, and other experts [to advance
their knowledge and improve their **technological
capabilities.**]{.underline}

The ability to conduct [[Chinese **research
expeditions**]{.underline}]{.mark} and other activities [[in]{.mark} the
**[polar regions]{.mark}**]{.underline} is therefore also [valued as a
way to promote and **[raise]{.mark}** the **[overall]{.mark} level of
[innovation and technology in China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which
constitutes [a **key priority**]{.mark} in the national development
strategy]{.underline} for restructuring and upgrading its economic
model.3 The [knowledge and technology]{.underline} developed have
[**parallel civilian and military uses**---**[dual-use]{.mark}
application**---and therefore also [play into Beijing's
**"military-civilian fusion**"]{.mark} strategy and the [**strategic
priority** of]{.mark} [developing]{.mark} a **[world-class
military]{.mark}**]{.underline}.4 Such links between the domestic
economic agenda and the polar regions have contributed to the continued
emphasis on expanding China's polar capacity and activities in key
policy documents, despite the significant setbacks that Beijing has
experienced, especially in the Arctic, in recent years.5

China's polar engagement has come a long way since it took off in the
mid-1980s in the Antarctic and the mid-1990s in the Arctic, driven
primarily by an ambition to build Chinese polar research capacity.6
Initially, it was led by individual researchers and research
institutions under the guidance of the State Oceanic Administration,
which was established in 1964 under the Ministry of Natural Resources
with the overall aim to "engage China in polar expeditions in the
future."7 This indicates that already at an early stage there was an
expectation in China that ensuring access to the polar regions was
important.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Chinese polar activities gradually became
more centrally administrated and controlled. In 1989 the Polar Research
Institute of China (PRIC) was founded to support scientific polar
research, administer the polar research facilities, and provide logistic
support for polar expeditions, with the first Chinese icebreaker Snow
Dragon 1 arriving from Ukraine in the mid-1990s. China has been most
active in the Antarctic. It established its first research station there
in 1984 and conducted regular research expeditions throughout the 1990s.
Today, China has four research stations in the Antarctic, and in April
2023 it restarted construction on a fifth during its 39th Antarctic
expedition.8 It was only in 1999 that China conducted its first research
expedition in the Arctic. By June 2023, however, it had conducted twelve
Arctic expeditions. Regarding Arctic research facilities, China has had
the Yellow River Station on Svalbard since 2004 and a smaller research
facility in Iceland since 2018. In addition, it has several satellite
receiver stations in the Antarctic and one in the Arctic in Kiruna,
Sweden. These stations play a critical role in the Chinese BeiDou
navigation satellite system.9

The research expeditions and facilities that [[China]{.mark} has set up
point to a gradually **[expanding]{.mark}** and **increasingly
[ambitious polar research agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially in
the Antarctic but also [[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. By all
estimates, China today has significant polar research capabilities and
competencies. In 2019, it added Snow Dragon 2, which is China's first
domestically built icebreaker. The vessel is a result of cooperation
with a world-leading Finnish company and is equipped with cutting-edge
oceanographic [[**surveying** and **monitoring**
**apparatus**]{.underline}]{.mark}, allowing for advanced
[[research]{.mark} in polar]{.underline} oceanography,
[[biod]{.mark}iversity]{.underline}, and [atmospheric and [environmental
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 A third Chinese nuclear-powered
icebreaker is under construction.11

Through an examination of the post-expedition reports from Chinese
researchers, it becomes clear that [China]{.underline} today [conducts
[**cutting-edge** **experiments**]{.mark} and **probes** on its polar
expeditions]{.underline}. For instance, during its ninth Arctic
expedition in 2018, Chinese researchers deployed unmanned observational
equipment such as an indigenously produced autonomous underwater glider
for deep-sea observation. Activities such as these have [[**greatly
enhanced** China's ability to **observe** and **monitor** the **Arctic
environment**]{.underline}]{.mark}**.**12 Chinese polar research still
centers on gaining a better understanding of the changing polar climate
and ice conditions in order to better predict and prepare for the
implications of climate change as well as to establish China as a
valuable polar partner. This is what is often termed "science
diplomacy," where non-polar states seek to use research activities to
legitimize and strengthen their polar presence and establish networks.13
Nevertheless, the [content and focus of [China's]{.mark} [polar]{.mark}
research [agenda]{.mark} have been gradually **[changing]{.mark}** and
**broadening** in the last decade]{.underline}. This is especially the
case in recent years. The domestic [focus on [establishing China as a
**leading power** in **innovative new tech**]{.mark}**nologies** has
been further emphasized [as]{.mark} the **[great]{.mark}-[power
competition]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has [intensified]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similar to the
United States, China has prioritized reducing its dependencies and thus
increasing its self-reliance, especially in critical resources and key
technologies.14

As highlighted above, China sees its presence and influence in the polar
regions as essential to provide access to critical resources, such as
oil, gas, and rare earth minerals. These resources are abundant in the
polar regions and are now becoming more accessible. Furthermore, China
possesses one of the world's largest distant-water fishing fleets and is
increasingly interested in ensuring access to new fishing grounds. This
relates to the more specific Chinese emphasis on securing favorable
access to Arctic sea routes. Besides their importance for extracting
Arctic resources, these routes are considered attractive alternatives to
the longer and strategically vulnerable routes through the Strait of
Malacca and the Suez Canal. A significant portion of China's maritime
trade passes through the Malacca Strait. Already back in 2003, then
president Hu Jintao coined the term "Malacca dilemma" \[Maliujia
kunjing\] to highlight how China's dependence on this critical
entry-exit point for upholding its economy, and hence security, creates
vulnerabilities that need to be mitigated.15 Chinese concerns about this
dependence and potential alternative routes have only increased since
then, as China's relations with the United States and several of its
Southeast Asian neighbors have deteriorated.

The Transpolar Sea Route cutting straight across the North Pole seems to
attract the most Chinese attention.16 It is the shortest of the three
Arctic sea routes, but it is especially attractive from the Chinese
perspective because unlike the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest
Passage it runs mostly through international waters, where all states
have freedom of navigation. Chinese ships would thus not have to follow
the specific regulations of the relevant Arctic state, most
significantly Russia in relation to the Northern Sea Route.

More generally, [[China]{.mark} has emphasized [polar engagement]{.mark}
as a means to [advance]{.mark} its **[overall]{.mark}** **level of
[innovation and technology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Made in China
2025 strategy identifies [key]{.underline} [sectors or industries such
as [**robotics**, **space tech**]{.mark}**nology,**
**[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**, the next generation of
**[communication]{.mark}** and **[info]{.mark}rmation**
[tech]{.mark}nology, and **maritime** **technology** and
**capabilities**]{.underline}. Within these sectors or industries,
[**[China aims to take the lead]{.mark}**]{.underline} by setting global
standards [through targeted investments, acquisitions, and research and
development.]{.underline}17 This is also one of the main drivers behind
the [[Belt and Road]{.mark} Initiative]{.underline}, which since June
2017 has [[included]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**Arctic** **sea
routes**]{.mark} [under]{.mark} the heading "**[Polar Silk
Road]{.mark}**]{.underline}."18 Consequently, the [expanding polar
engagement]{.underline} also [[reflects Beijing's ambition]{.mark} to
play a [key]{.mark} role [in]{.mark} **negotiating** and
**[deciding]{.mark}** on **[global]{.mark} standards**, [rules]{.mark},
and regulations]{.underline}. This is especially a Chinese priority in
relation to these new strategic frontiers that are still rather
unexplored and unregulated spaces. In other spaces, China sees itself as
a latecomer and thus as disadvantaged. [Through the [**leadership**
of]{.mark} the **[new strategic frontiers]{.mark}** there is an
[opportunity for China]{.mark} [to]{.mark} be involved from the
beginning and]{.underline} even **[[take a dominating
role]{.underline}]{.mark}**.19

In sum, it is evident that there is a [significant polar
dimension]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the [key Chinese
strategies]{.underline} published in the recent decade, [[linking
**China's polar engagement** with its **long-term ambitions** and
**vision**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In recent years, Beijing has experienced significant setbacks in its
effort to establish itself as a legitimate and influential polar
stakeholder. China's strategy has been to knit itself into the polar
regions on multiple levels, through bilateral and multilateral
agreements and engagements within research, infrastructure, and resource
extraction. This has especially been the case in the Arctic. However,
the overall growing concerns in both the United States and Europe about
the intentions of a stronger and more assertive China have made the
Western Arctic states considerably reluctant to engage with China.20
Chinese activities have come under scrutiny in the Antarctic as well.21

[Beijing's unwillingness to distance itself from Russia]{.underline}
following the country's full-blown invasion of Ukraine in February 2022
further complicates China's polar engagement by increasing the overall
level of suspicion and wariness among Western states. On the other hand,
it also [[opens **new opportunities** for China to challenge the
**weakened polar governance** **regimes**]{.underline}]{.mark} as well
as [to [take advantage of]{.mark} a [weakened Russia]{.mark} that is
more dependent on China]{.underline}.22 [China]{.underline} potentially
now [has more room to [promote]{.mark} its long-standing [argument
about]{.mark} the [**ineffectiveness** and]{.mark} **indeterminateness**
of]{.underline} the [[existing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[institutional]{.mark}]{.underline} and legal [[architecture]{.mark} in
the polar regions.]{.underline}

#### Chinese tech leadership causes [global nuclear war]{.underline}---extinction.

Technology Cause Nuclear War?: Bringing Geopolitics Back In." *Strategic
Studies Quarterly* 15 (4). https://www.jstor.org/stable/48638052; mgm\]

Similarly, Moscow and [**[Beijing]{.mark}** would likely [use]{.mark}
any **[new]{.mark}found military [strength ]{.mark}**[to advance]{.mark}
their **preexisting [geopolitical]{.mark} [aims]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Given their very different positions in the international system,
however, these states are [likely to [employ new]{.mark}]{.underline}
military [**[tech]{.mark}nologies** in ways that are
**[destabilizing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These states have made clear
their [**dissatisfaction** with the **existing international system**
and their **desire to revise**]{.underline} [it]{.underline}. Both
countries have ongoing border disputes with multiple neighboring
countries.

If Moscow developed new military technologies and operational concepts
that shifted the balance of power in its favor, it would likely use this
advantage to pursue revisionist aims. If Moscow acquired a newfound
ability to more easily invade and occupy territory in Eastern Europe,
for example (or if Putin believed Russia had such a capability), it is
more likely Russia would be tempted to engage in aggression.

Likewise, [if [China acquired]{.mark} an [**enhanced ability** through
**new tech**]{.mark}**nology** [to **invade**]{.mark} and **occupy
[Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline} or contested islands [in the East or
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}eas,
[Beijing]{.underline}'s leaders might also [[find]{.mark} this
**[opportunity tempting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If [new technology
enhances]{.underline} either power's [**anti-access**, **area-denial**
network,]{.underline} then its [leaders may be [**more**
**confident**]{.mark} in their ability [to achieve]{.mark} a fait
**accompli [attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} [against a
neighbor]{.underline} [and]{.underline} then [block a US-led
liberation.]{.underline}

These are [precisely the]{.underline} types of [[**shifts** in]{.mark}
the **[balance of power]{.mark}** that can [**lead to**
**war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As mentioned previously, the predominant
scholarly theory on the causes of war---the bargaining model---maintains
that [imperfect]{.underline} [information on the balance of power and
the balance of resolve and credible commitment problems result in
international conflict]{.underline}.52 [[New]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology
can **[exacerbate]{.mark}** these **[causal mechanisms]{.mark}** by
**[increasing uncertainty]{.mark}** about, or [causing **rapid
shifts**]{.mark} [in]{.mark}, the **[balance of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed as noted above, [new]{.underline}
military **[tech]{.underline}**nology [and]{.underline} the
[development]{.underline} of new operational concepts have [**shifted**
the **balance of power** and **[result]{.mark}ed** [in **military
conflict**]{.mark} throughout history.]{.underline}

Some may argue emerging military technology is more likely to result in
a new tech arms race than in conflict. This is possible. But Moscow and
[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} may [come to [believe]{.mark} (correctly
or not)]{.underline} that [**[new]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology**
[provides]{.mark} them a **[usable]{.mark} military [advantage]{.mark}**
over the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its
Allies]{.underline} and partners. In so doing, they may underestimate
Washington.

[If]{.underline} Moscow or [[Beijing attacked]{.mark} a **vulnerable
[US]{.mark}** [A]{.mark}lly]{.underline} or partner in their near
abroad, therefore, [there would be a risk of [**major war**
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the potential for [**[nuclear
escalation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The United States has formal treaty
commitments with several frontline states as well as an ambiguous
[[defense obligation to Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}. If Russia or China
were to attack these states, it is likely, or at least possible, that
the United States would come to the defense of the victims. While many
question the wisdom or credibility of America's global commitments, it
would be [[difficult]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to]{.mark} simply **[back down]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Abandoning a treaty ally could cause fears that America's global
commitments would unravel. Any US president, therefore, would feel great
pressure to come to an Ally's defense and expel Russian or Chinese
forces.

Once the United States and Russia or China are at war, there would be a
**[risk of nuclear escalation.]{.underline}** As noted previously,
experts assess the greatest risk of nuclear war today does not come from
a bolt-out-of-the-blue strike but from [nuclear escalation in a
regional, conventional conflict]{.underline}.53 Russian leaders may
believe it is in their interest to use nuclear weapons early in a
conflict with the United States and NATO.54 Russia possesses a large and
diverse arsenal, including thousands of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, to
support this nuclear strategy.

In the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, Washington indicates it could
retaliate against any Russian nuclear "de-escalation" strikes with
limited nuclear strikes of its own using low-yield nuclear weapons.55
The purpose of US strategy is to deter Russian strikes. If deterrence
fails, however, there is a clear pathway to nuclear war between the
United States and Russia. As Henry Kissinger pointed out decades ago,
there is no guarantee that, once begun, a limited nuclear war stays
limited.56

There are similar [**risks of nuclear escalation** in the event of a
**US-China conflict**]{.underline}. China has traditionally possessed a
relaxed nuclear posture with a small "lean and effective" deterrent and
a formal "no first use" policy. But [China is relying more on its
strategic forces]{.underline}. It is projected to double---if not triple
or [quadruple]{.underline}---the size of its [nuclear
arsenal]{.underline} in the coming decade.57

Chinese experts have acknowledged there is a narrow range of
contingencies in which China might use nuclear weapons first.58 As in
the case of Russia, the US Nuclear Posture Review recognizes the
possibility of limited Chinese nuclear attacks and also holds out the
potential of a limited US reprisal with low- yield nuclear weapons as a
deterrent.59 If the nuclear threshold is breached [in a conflict between
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and [China]{.mark}, the **[risk of
nuclear exchange is real.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In short, [if]{.underline} a [[coming]{.underline} [revolution in
military affairs]{.underline}]{.mark} [[provides]{.mark} a real or
[perceived battlefield advantage for]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia or
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, such a [development [raises]{.mark} the
[likelihood of]{.mark}]{.underline} armed aggression against US regional
allies, [[**major power** war]{.mark}, and an **increased risk of
[nuclear escalation]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Implications

Future scholarship should incorporate geopolitical conditions and the
related foreign policy goals of the states in question when theorizing
the effects of technology on international politics. Often scholars
attempt to conceptualize the effects of weapons systems in isolation
from the political context in which they are embedded.

Studies treat technology as disembodied from geopolitics and as exerting
independent effects on the international system. But technology does not
float freely. [Technology is a tool different actors can use in
different ways]{.underline}. Bakers and arsonists employ fire in their
crafts to strikingly different ends. In the current international
environment, Russia and [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} would tend to
[[employ tech]{.mark}nology [toward]{.mark} **advancing
[revisionist]{.mark} [aims]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Technological
[advances]{.underline} in these countries are therefore much more likely
to [[disrupt]{.mark} the prevailing international order and **[nuclear
strategic stability.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

This approach also suggests the potential threat new technology poses to
nuclear strategic stability is more pervasive than previously
understood. To undermine strategic stability, new technology need not
directly impact strategic capabilities. Rather, [any [tech]{.mark}nology
that]{.underline} promises to [[shift]{.mark} the local [balance of
power]{.mark}]{.underline} in Eastern Europe or the Indo-Pacific has
[the potential to **[threaten nuclear strategic
stability.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Several [[**Chinese scientific investments** in the Arctic
**present**]{.underline}]{.mark} potential **[[security
risks]{.mark}]{.underline}** because such investments allow
[[China]{.mark} to **[observe]{.mark}** and learn about [U.S.,
NATO]{.mark}, and **partner military [activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in addition to civilian Arctic activities. These investments fall into
three areas: (1) establishing potentially [[**dual-use**]{.mark}
**scientific bases** and [research stations]{.mark}]{.underline}; (2)
[gaining access to **[observation assets]{.mark}**]{.underline},
including **[[satellite ground monitoring
stations]{.underline}]{.mark}** and antenna; and (3) building underwater
sensing and mapping networks. These types of activities collectively
[support China's Arctic Policy]{.underline} goal to obtain more
knowledge about the region. The following sections summarize China's
scientific investments in the Arctic.

Scientific Research Stations

In the 2000s, China has transitioned from having temporary scientific
bases to permanent ones in the Arctic. In 2001, China established its
first temporary Arctic research station in Svalbard's principal town of
Longyearbyen on Spitsbergen Island, which is between the Norwegian
mainland and the North Pole.70 Three years later, China established the
Yellow River Station, which is managed by the Polar Research Institute
of China (PRIC), at Ny-Ålesund in Svalbard. Since then, China has
consistently engaged with Norway through the Yellow River Station
laboratories, logging 1,221 research days in 2019, and resumed sending
additional scientists there after 2021.71 China's Yellow River Station
laboratories study meteorology and space-earth measurements, glaciology,
marine ecosystems, the environment, and weather patterns in the polar
region.72 The 1920 Spitsbergen Treaty recognizes Norway's sovereignty
over the archipelago of Svalbard but allows foreign nationals to conduct
"various economic undertakings" on the island.73 A 2021 article noted
that China's managers of the Yellow River Station were supportive of a
larger degree of autonomy in their research activities without
interference from Norway; accordingly, they supported a greater role for
the Ny-Ålesund Science Managers Committee, an information-sharing forum
for researchers working on the island of Spitsbergen, although Norway's
2019 Research Strategy for NyÅlesund instead sought to diminish that
role.74

Ålesund instead sought to diminish that role.74 In 2012, China
established its second permanent Arctic research station on farmland
near the northern Icelandic port town of Akureyri in Kárhól.75 Six years
later, China opened at this location what became known as the
China-Iceland Joint Arctic Science Observatory (CIAO), which was
previously known as the China-Iceland Joint Aurora Observatory, in
collaboration with PRIC and the Icelandic Center for Research. This
facility hosts China's wet **[[laboratories]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
workshops.76 One critic of CIAO argued in 2014 (before the facility
opened) that [**China** could use it for regional **intelligence
collection activities**]{.underline}, specifically "[to [track]{.mark}
western satellites and **[NATO airspace]{.mark}**]{.underline},
including American P-8 \[Poseidon\] flights out of Keflavik, Iceland."77

Satellite Ground Monitoring Stations

China's Efforts to Access Satellite Monitoring Data

[In addition to]{.underline} establishing [physical]{.underline}
scientific [facilities [to study the **Arctic
environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has
also been [**[investing]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially
**[[dual-use observational capacities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as
[**[satellite]{.underline}** **[monitoring, ground
stations]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and antennae. China has also signed
agreements that allow it access to data collected by such assets. China
has operated two facilities in Kiruna, Sweden, at the Esrange Space
Center (a [meteorological ground receiving station]{.underline}) since
2010; and a **[satellite monitoring station]{.underline}**, the China
Remote Sensing Satellite North Polar Ground Station, since 2016. The
latter was the first Chinese overseas satellite ground receiver station
and was designed to [support China's]{.underline} Gaofen **[remote
sensing system]{.underline}**.78 The Swedish Space Corporation (SSC)
operates the Esrange Space Center and had contracted with three Chinese
scientific agencies---China's Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital
Earth (RADI), China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and China
Launch and Tracking Control (CLTC)---for the use of four satellite dish
antennae. Even though SSC controls all data received from and sent to
satellites by the antennae, SSC owns only three antennae, and China owns
the fourth. The antenna used by China's RADI receives data from an Earth
observation satellite, the two antennas used by CMA receive data from
meteorological satellites, and the antenna used by CLTC receives and
sends data from and to satellites and spacecraft.79

An FOI study found that "the satellites can be [used [for
**military**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[**[info]{.mark}rmation[-gathering]{.mark}**
**purposes**]{.underline}."80 In 2020, the Swedish National Space Board
reported that the contract for the antenna would not be extended.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) was also involved in a joint
research project with the Finnish Meteorological Institute in Sodankylä,
Finland, from 2018 to 2021. During this time, personnel from China
visited Finland's Sodankylä Space Campus to conduct research on the
cryosphere with satellites, and vice versa.81 CAS planned to build a new
joint research center for Arctic space observation and data sharing at
Sodankylä. In addition to the exchanges, the campus would have been used
to deliver data from the European Space Agency's Copernicus Sentinel-1
to CAS researchers. As of the time of the writing of this report, those
plans have not materialized. Finland did not renew the agreement with
CAS at the end of the three-year joint project, citing "changes in the
world's political situation," and CAS is not pursuing the renewal of the
agreement.82

[China tried to establish a satellite monitoring capability in
Nuuk]{.underline}, Greenland.83 In 2017, the Beijing Normal University's
Global Change and Earth System Science Research Institute attempted to
fund and build a satellite dish antenna ground station and research
facility for remote sensing in collaboration with the Greenland
Institute of Natural Resources.84 However, the Greenland and Danish
governments [never approved the proposal]{.underline}, and the project
[did not move forward]{.underline}.85

China is a member of the European Incoherent Scatter Scientific
Association (EISCAT). EISCAT owns and operates radar antennae in Sweden,
Finland, and Norway. China's membership in EISCAT provides it with full
access to data that can potentially be used for military purposes.86

China's 14th Five-Year Plan notes [[**China's** "**weak polar
observation capabilities**]{.mark}" and [calls for]{.mark} **complete**
"**[indigenization]{.mark}**" and [**independent operation** of
"**satellite**]{.mark}-**based remote [sensing]{.mark}** **technology**
for sea ice in the **Arctic**]{.underline}."87 China already possesses
some capabilities; its satellites monitor the NSR and can help
[[**fill** **capability gaps for**]{.mark}]{.underline} other Arctic
countries. For example, **[[Russia']{.mark}s NSR [nuclear
icebreaker]{.mark} operator]{.underline}**, Rosatom State Atomic Energy
Corporation (or ROSATOM) announced in March 2023 that it was [[**looking
to partner** with **China** to **receive data from** **Chinese**
**satellites** **monitoring**]{.mark} the [NSR "to improve
**navigation**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} ice **[forecasts]{.mark}** on the
**route**]{.underline}."88 The partnership would [[complement
**Russia's**]{.mark} own planned **[satellite]{.mark}
constellations**]{.underline} (such as Arktika-M, Obzor-R, and
Kondor-FKA) [to [extend]{.mark} navigation]{.underline} time
**[[along]{.mark} [the NSR]{.mark}]{.underline}** and **[make navigation
more secure]{.underline}**.89

On the European mainland, Moscow's influence-peddling and political
subversion have achieved worrying, if uneven, success in pulling NATO
members or aspirant states away from the West. Georgia's ruling Georgian
Dream party continues to steer the country away from the West into
Russia's orbit, particularly after the highly controversial
parliamentary elections in October 2024 and the suspension of
discussions on EU accession. Romania and Moldova narrowly resisted
similar pressures during their most recent elections. Meanwhile,
Russia's sway over Hungary, Slovakia, and Serbia remains firmly
entrenched.

Finally, despite its setbacks and humiliations on the battlefield in
Ukraine, [Russia continues to innovate technologically]{.underline},
particularly in drone warfare, cybersecurity, and nuclear energy, while
forging [critical]{.underline} economic [ties]{.underline} across the
southern hemisphere and [with strategic partners such as]{.underline}
Iran and the [PRC]{.underline}.

Russia's Hybrid Warfare

[[Russia]{.mark} has [escalated]{.mark}]{.underline} and innovated its
use of [[**hybrid warfare against** **NATO**]{.mark}
**countries**]{.underline}. This comprises espionage, sabotage,
cyber-warfare, and information-warfare activities geared toward
manipulating political narratives.

Frontline NATO countries are particularly at risk. Poland, Romania, and
the Baltic and Nordic nations figure as the primary targets of Russian
subterfuge. These activities aim to undermine social cohesion and
exacerbate [tensions, prevent the flow of aid to Ukraine, and
[**prepare** **strategic readiness** for **future operations against
NATO.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Since 2021, Russia has targeted European communication networks through
cyber-warfare, but also [sabotage attacks on undersea fiber-optic cables
in the Baltic and Arctic seas.]{.underline} The use of plausible
deniability---and potential [[Russian-PRC

Western Disunity and the War in Ukraine

The [[Kremlin]{.mark} remains [**committed** to]{.mark} its policy of
[**confrontation** with the **West**]{.mark}]{.underline} through
weakening alliances and financial influence,
[[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's ongoing preparations for the
potential [end of]{.underline} its invasion of
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Washington's unilateral proposal and the France--Germany--U.K.--Ukraine
quadripartite plan for peace in Russia's war against Ukraine both aim to
end hostilities, but their divergent approaches---especially on
Crimea---underscore a lack of unified Western strategy. Both blueprints
envision ceasefires and withdrawals, yet differ on treating Crimea as
inviolate versus deferrable---while Moscow views any territory ceded as
leverage for deeper political subjugation.

A temporary ceasefire, championed by neither Kyiv nor Moscow but eyed by
the United States, risks becoming a mere pause in violence, with both
sides poised to resume combat under harsher conditions. More
importantly, a rushed peace deal with unacceptable terms for Ukraine
will merely freeze the conflict and prepare the groundwork for renewed
conflict.

Russia's Foreign Political Interference

In the twenty-first century, Russia has sought to exploit and stoke
disruptive far-right, ultranationalist politics across Europe and North
America to weaken the Western neoliberal consensus.

Utilizing digital spaces to promote false information and incendiary
narratives, Russia seeks to compromise unity and foster skepticism of
the European Union and NATO, achieving varying degrees of success.

In 2024, Georgia fell off its path to European integration with the
controversial election of the ruling Eurosceptic, Russia-friendly
Georgian Dream party to power. Romania and Moldova have narrowly avoided
similar scenarios during their most recent elections.

Russia-backed far-right and ultranationalist figures have exploited
legal maneuvers, electoral irregularities, and societal divisions to
challenge or overturn pro-NATO/EU leadership, threatening to pull these
states away from the West.

This all contributes to Moscow's wider objective to promote a new
"multipolar" world order allied against Western hegemony.

Russia's Plans for Arctic Dominance

[Russia's]{.underline} infrastructure and military [capabilities in the
Arctic]{.underline} currently rival those of NATO as a whole. Rising
temperatures are set to transform the Arctic region into one of the main
geopolitical battlegrounds of the twenty-first century. Going back to
the Soviet era, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has [disproportionately
[invested in Arctic]{.mark} technologies [to establish]{.mark} its
[dominance]{.mark} in the Arctic Ocean.]{.underline}

[Through its **[Project 22220 nuclear icebreakers]{.mark}** and

Russia publicly champions economic and **[[scientific

#### Russian icebreaker expansion triggers [nuclear war]{.underline}.

since 2011. "Is the Arctic Destined to Be the Most Likely Flashpoint for

mgm\]

Long gone are the days of "duck and cover" drills and fallout shelters
in America, when the fears of nuclear war were on the minds of most. For
decades, cooler heads prevailed, and the U.S. and Russia worked
cooperatively to reduce the risk of nuclear conflict and decrease the
size of their arsenals. By 2022, cooperation began disintegrating as
[**Russia's** botched invasion of [**Ukraine**
raised]{.mark}]{.underline} serious **[[concerns about nuclear
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and severely hampered the prospects of
future nuclear arms control agreements. With Russia seemingly dismissing
the Trump administration's rather conciliatory efforts to end the war,
there appears to be no end in sight, and Europe is feeling the pressure,
embarking on a massive effort to boost its own defense.

Amidst these tensions, [melting polar ice is opening **[Arctic sea
lanes]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[to]{.underline} increased
shipping traffic, resource exploration, and [[military
posturing]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO's newest members, Finland and
Sweden, are Arctic nations. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} currently
dominates the Arctic region, holding 53% of its total coastline,
[operating]{.underline} the world's biggest **[[icebreaker
fleet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and has been upgrading its Arctic military
bases. [**[China]{.mark}** is]{.underline} also increasingly [**playing
a role**, conducting [**joint** **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} military
**[[exercises]{.mark} with Russia]{.underline}** and employing an
icebreaker fleet of its own, despite its complete lack of territory in
the Arctic Circle.

But is the Arctic destined to be the **[[most likely flashpoint for a
nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}**? Let's look at the possibilities.

Despite being so cold, the [Arctic]{.underline} is [no stranger to
military conflict]{.underline}, holding **[[major strategic]{.mark}
[value]{.mark}]{.underline}** and serving **[as a
passageway]{.underline}** to both the Atlantic and Pacific. During World
War II, the Battle of the Atlantic extended into the Arctic and ships
carrying American war supplies to the Soviet Union traversed the
**[[Northern Sea]{.mark} [Route]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Germany invaded
Norway, and the Soviet Union invaded Finland in the Winter War of 1940.
As the Cold War evolved, the Arctic [became [a **major
theater**]{.mark}]{.underline} for submarine activity.

Today, President Trump's insistence on acquiring Greenland "one way or
the other" highlights the growing importance of the Arctic to the
security interests of the United States. Greenland's geographic
location, combined with the U.S.' operation of Pituffik Space Base in
the high north, provides key "missile warning, missile defense, and
space surveillance" capabilities. The [shortest flight paths for
**nuclear missiles** between the **U.S. and Russia** exist over the
Arctic Ocean]{.underline}, and the loss of this base on account of a
diplomatic blunder could open a key blind spot in America's strategic
defense. Alternatively, the loss of this base to a Russian attack aimed
at disabling American missile detection infrastructure is unlikely due
to the danger of immediate retaliation and escalation.

Currently, the [[most likely path to a]{.mark}]{.underline} potential
[**[nuclear exchange in the Arctic]{.mark}** would be through a
**conventional or "[gray zone" Russian]{.mark}** [attack on a **NATO
member**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Border [[skirmishes]{.underline}]{.mark},
[cyber-attacks]{.underline}, **[[airspace
incursions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, reckless military intercepts, and
support to separatist groups intentionally [sit in the "**gray
zone**"]{.underline} between peace and outright war, but could
ultimately [[lead to open conflict that escalates to **nuclear**]{.mark}
**war**]{.underline}. Conceivably, a gray zone or overt attack on other
Greelandic infrastructure, or an information operations campaign aimed
at dividing the U.S., Greenland, and Denmark, are not outside of the
realm of possibility.

With NATO's addition of Sweden and, more importantly, Finland---which
shares a 1,343 km border with Russia---there is increased opportunity
that a NATO Arctic state could be attacked. Highlighting this risk,
American forces in Alaska recently staged a drill in which hundreds of
troops were flown to Finland to defend against a mock Russian invasion.
Yet rather than an overt invasion of a NATO member, Russia is far more
likely test the waters by conducting provocative and destabilizing
small-scale gray zone activities. The disastrous results of Russia's
invasion of Ukraine have likely raised doubts in Moscow about its
ability to achieve its objectives in a direct attack on a nuclear armed
country, let alone a large NATO ally, making a direct attack unlikely.
It is not entirely clear where the red line on gray zone activities
would be for Finland or what would trigger an Article 5 collective
defense declaration short of a direct attack across the border.

Though the threat of American nuclear weapons has long-served to deter a
Russian attack on the European NATO members, President Trump's many
public pronouncements expressing doubt about his willingness to defend a
NATO member that comes under attack has shaken confidence in Europe
about America's commitment. As a result, France and the UK are
considering expanding their arsenals, signifying an increased reliance
on nuclear posturing for deterrence, including for the defense of Arctic
NATO members. France is reconsidering whether it wants to decommission
its current warheads as it brings replacements online, potentially
doubling of the size of its arsenal. It is simultaneously upgrading an
airbase closer to the German border to be able to host nuclear weapons.
The UK, which has been historically dependent on the U.S. for its
nuclear arsenal, is recently questioning that dependence, and may seek
other options to assure an effective and reliable deterrent. This could
foretell a new nuclear arms race.

The upcoming February 2026 expiration of New START, the last remaining
strategic nuclear arms treaty between the U.S. and Russia, portends a
period of nuclear proliferation that could echo the nuclear arms
buildups of the Cold War. Meanwhile, China, which has been operating in
the Arctic, has been engaging in its own rapid nuclear buildup in an
effort to potentially exceed 1,000 warheads by 2035. China has
consistently rejected efforts to join a multilateral nuclear arms
reduction treaty with the U.S. and Russia, citing its comparatively much
smaller nuclear arsenal.

Navigation issues in the Arctic could also lead to military escalations
reaching the nuclear level. The Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS), which includes satellite constellations like the American GPS
system or Russian GLONASS, sees decreased reliability and accuracy in
the Arctic. The reasons for this are abundant, like the orbital
inclination of the satellites themselves and ionospheric interference.
With increased incidents of Russian GNSS jamming in Europe, it's
conceivable that Russia may employ similar tactics in the Arctic,
including spoofing, for the purpose of disruption or causing
navigational errors to trigger an exploitable international incident.
Military or civilian vessels straying into Russian territory could be
captured, their cargoes seized, or crews held hostage for the purpose of
conducting hostage diplomacy. Resolving such a confrontation military
could quickly spiral out of control.

Yet considering these combined factors, the Arctic does not exist in a
vacuum, and there are other regions in which nuclear tensions are
rising.

The threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is the most likely scenario
for a direct confrontation between the United States and another nuclear
power. Though he has not signaled any specific intent to attack,
President Xi aims for the Chinese military to be capable of invading
Taiwan by 2027. While President Biden indicated his intention to
directly aid Taiwan if this occurred, President Trump appears to defer
to the traditional American position of strategic ambiguity over the
island. Should China decide to invade, and the U.S. responds to defend
Taiwan, it is difficult to see Washington opting to detonate a nuclear
weapon over an issue that does not directly threaten the U.S. mainland
or a NATO ally. On the other hand, a subsequent attack on Chinese
mainland military sites in order to disable an attacking Chinese
invasion force could plausibly incite a nuclear response.

What is most concerning is that [**[provocative]{.mark}** military
**[behavior]{.mark}**]{.underline} anywhere [could [lead to an
**unintentional cycle of escalation**]{.mark} that ultimately **[results
in a nuclear exchange]{.mark}**. As the Arctic opens to more
military]{.underline} and commercial [activity]{.underline}, the
[**[frequency of encounters]{.mark}** between **military forces is**
likely to [increase]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As]{.underline} those
encounters [increase, [so]{.mark} too [does]{.mark} the
**[probability]{.mark}** that an [**accident** or **unintended**
attack]{.mark} may [occur]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Russia routinely
flies patrols into the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone, an area
of international air space in which the U.S. identifies all aircraft,
aggressive behavior by Russian pilots raises the risk of a routine
encounter evolving into an international incident. But these aggressive
incidents are much more frequent elsewhere, like the Baltic and North
Seas. For example, in 2022, a Russian SU-27 fighter jet fired two
missiles against a British RC-135 surveillance jet over the Black Sea,
but fortunately neither missile hit their target. Similarly, China is
known for conducting frequent unsafe intercepts of foreign aircraft in
the East and South China Seas.

**[US]{.mark}** and **[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} (could include
China, [and]{.underline} **[[NATO]{.mark} member states]{.underline}**),
**[nuclear detonations]{.underline}** in cities and industrial areas
would [[create **enormous**]{.mark} **nuclear
[firestorms]{.mark}**]{.underline} that scientists predict will [produce
approximately **[150 million tons of smoke]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Most of this dark smoke would quickly [rise]{.underline} above cloud
level [into the stratosphere.]{.underline} High winds in the
stratosphere will spread around the world in about 10 days time. The
smoke will then form a dense global stratospheric smoke layer, which
will include both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

Because the smoke is above cloud level and cannot be rained out, the
smoke layer will remain in the stratosphere for ten years or longer,
where it will act to [block]{.underline} warming [sunlight]{.underline}
from reaching the surface of the Earth. In the post-war Northern
Hemisphere, during a cloudy day at noon, light levels would be similar
to what we experience now at midnight during a full moon.

Without warming sunlight the [Earth will dramatically **cool

and remain below freezing every day for one to three years. Temperatures
would be colder than those experienced during the last Ice Age.

Following a large nuclear war, it would be **[[too cold to grow

minutes) at targets in the US, Europe and Russia.

Some fraction of the remaining 1600 to 2000 deployed and operational US
and Russian nuclear weapons are also detonated

Hundreds of [**[large cities]{.mark}** in the]{.underline} U.S., Europe
and Russia are **[[engulfed]{.mark} in massive nuclear
firestorms]{.underline}**, which burn urban areas covering tens or
hundreds of thousands of square miles/kilometers.

150 million tons of smoke produced by the firestorms rises above cloud
level, into the stratosphere, where it quickly spreads around the world
and forms a dense stratospheric smoke layer.

The dense stratospheric smoke layer will remain for at least ten years.

The [[smoke blocks]{.underline}]{.mark} up to [[70% of]{.mark} **warming
[sunlight]{.mark}**]{.underline} from reaching the Earth's surface in
the Northern Hemisphere, and up to 35% of the sunlight is also blocked
in the Southern Hemisphere.

In the Northern Hemisphere, the noonday sun would resemble a full moon
at midnight.

In the absence of warming sunlight, surface temperatures on Earth become
as cold or colder than they were 18,000 years ago at the height of the
last Ice Age

There would be rapid cooling of more than 38 degree Fahrenheit (20°C)
over large areas of North America and of more than 57 degrees Fahrenheit
(30°C) over much of Eurasia, including all major agricultural regions

Minimum daily temperatures in the central regions of the Northern
Hemisphere drop below freezing each day for 1 to 3 years.

**[[Nightly]{.mark} killing [frosts]{.mark}]{.underline}** would occur
for many years.

Average global precipitation would be reduced by 45% due to the
prolonged cold.

**[[Growing seasons]{.underline}]{.mark}** would be virtually
[[eliminated]{.underline}]{.mark} for at least 10 years.

[World [grain]{.mark} reserves]{.underline} would be
**[[exhausted]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a few months.

The [inability to grow food crops]{.underline} for years would [cause
**[most humans]{.mark}**]{.underline} and land-based animals **[to
[starve]{.mark} to death.]{.underline}**

[[Massive]{.mark} amounts of **radioactive
[fallout]{.mark}**]{.underline} would be generated and
**[[spread]{.underline}]{.mark}** both locally and
**[[globally]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The targeting of nuclear reactors
would significantly increase fallout of long-lived isotopes.

[[Gigantic]{.mark} ground**-hugging clouds** of **[toxic
smoke]{.mark}**]{.underline} would be released from the fires; enormous
quantities of industrial chemicals would also enter the environment.

Already stressed land and marine **[[ecosystems]{.mark} would
[collapse]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

It would be [[impossible]{.mark} for many living things [to
survive]{.mark}]{.underline} the extreme rapidity and degree of [changes
in temperature]{.underline} and precipitation, combined with drastic
increases in **[UV light]{.underline}**, massive **[radioactive
fallout]{.underline}**, and **[massive releases of toxins]{.underline}**
and industrial chemicals.

A [**[mass extinction]{.underline}**]{.mark} event [**[would

million years ago, when **[[the dinosaurs]{.underline}]{.mark}** were
**[wiped out]{.underline}** following a large asteroid impact with Earth
(70% of species became extinct, including all animals greater than 25
kilograms in weight).

[[Even humans]{.mark} living [in shelters]{.mark}]{.underline} equipped
with many years worth of food, water, energy, and medical supplies
[would]{.underline} probably **[[not survive]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
the hostile post-war environment.

[[Climatic changes]{.underline}]{.mark} resulting [[from]{.mark}
[**nuclear** **conflict**]{.mark} would occur many thousands of times
faster]{.underline} -- and thus would likely be **[[far more
catastrophic]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- than the climatic changes
predicted as a result of global warming.1 The rapidity of the
war-induced changes, appearing in a matter of days and weeks, would
allow human populations and the whole plant and animal kingdoms no time
to adapt.

Like its existing and planned economic investments **[[in Arctic]{.mark}
critical infrastructure]{.underline}** developed through the "Polar Silk
Road," Beijing has led the development and deployment of significant,
permanent scientific research stations and infrastructure across the
northern Atlantic, thereby increasing its physical presence across the
region---including on the territory of NATO Allies Norway and Iceland.
In 2003, the **[[Chinese]{.mark} government]{.underline}** opened the
Arctic Yellow River Station on the Norwegian island of Svalbard and has
[built on]{.underline} this **[[presence]{.underline}]{.mark}** recently
with the October 2018 opening of the China-Iceland Arctic Science
Observatory (CIAO)---a **[permanent]{.underline} [[scientific
installation]{.underline}]{.mark}** dedicated to a wide spectrum of
[[research]{.mark} objectives]{.underline}, including geomagnetic field
measurements, aurora observations, [climatology]{.underline},
glaciology, oceanography, and [biology]{.underline}.

Such investments have **[[raised critical national
security]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**
among some northern European nations. This includes a collaboration
between Chinese Ministry of Natural Resources' "Arctic Environment
Satellite and Numerical Weather [Forecasting]{.underline}" project and
Sweden's Kiruna satellite receiving station, which has been criticized
as [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} possible [[platform fo]{.mark}r advancing
**[Chinese military intelligence]{.mark} operations**]{.underline}.
Concerns over the potential **[[dual-use of]{.mark} Chinese [permanent
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}** investments has also extended to
Greenland; including China's efforts to upgrade three new airfields,
which were ultimately blocked by Copenhagen after it opted to provide
its own investment in the facilities.

Recapturing the transatlantic edge

To its credit, the United States has initiated steps to increase its own
strategic security interests in the Arctic, however these have yet not
matched the range of investment activities made by Russia and China.
Washington has begun movement toward investment in much-needed
polar-class icebreakers to aid Arctic operations of US Navy and Coast
Guard vessels, and has chaired the Arctic Council. And the US Air Force
released its first ever Arctic-specific strategy; public acknowledgement
by the Pentagon that the changing physical environment across the region
is driving a rapidly-evolving security environment.

As [[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} and Brussels look toward next steps
in [[security]{.underline}]{.mark} and civil infrastructure
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** and investment [[across the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, they [[must]{.underline}]{.mark} also
reinvest and [**[expand]{.mark}** their [permanent]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[scientific infrastructure presence]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}**. [Unlike [**robust US investments in permanent
scientific research** **facilities**]{.mark} in other remote
environments, [Washington]{.mark} [has]{.mark} thus far [not
**matched**]{.mark} **these [initiatives]{.mark}** with **parallel
investments [in the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.** [[Compared
with]{.mark} the **[assertive]{.mark} scientific facility
[investments]{.mark}** made [by China]{.mark}]{.underline} in Svalbard
and Iceland, the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates still [only]{.mark}
[operates a **handful of research camps**]{.mark} across the
Arctic.]{.underline} And despite the growing scientific and strategic
importance of the region, the [[last]{.mark} time the [US]{.mark}
government opened a **[new]{.mark} major research [facility]{.mark}** in
the Arctic [was 1989]{.mark}]{.underline}, when it established the
National Science Foundation (NSF)-administered Summit Station, a
high-altitude site on the northern Greenlandic ice sheet.

The United States Arctic Research Commission (USARC), points out that
while the **[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** continues to
support a wide array of [scientific [research]{.mark} activities across
the Arctic]{.underline}, these are as yet [**[not]{.underline}
[supported]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **established**
of **new** or **expanded [permanent
infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, the USARC calls for
increased [funding]{.underline} of "...[demonstration projects to
address engineering design of **Arctic infrastructure**]{.underline}."
This is key: the technical realities of the design, deployment, and
operations of permanent infrastructure facilities and instrumentation in
the polar regions presents unique technical challenges, ranging from
extreme weather conditions and temperatures to the reality of building
and maintaining permanent structures on constantly evolving ice sheets.
Even a task that would be straightforward in a temperate climate---say,
constructing a small lab building---requires specialized knowhow. For
example, such a structure includes unique engineering requirements, like
jacking mechanisms to allow the structure to be raised to the level of
the accumulated snow grade each year, as well as precise knowledge on
snow packing densities that ensure building footers are well grounded in
the absence of a soil or bedrock anchoring used in standard
construction. Unique challenges like these are found throughout all
aspects of the operations, communications, and logistics supply chains
needed to run Arctic infrastructure.

These challenges are indeed encountered at the **[[limited array of
existing US Arctic facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** like Greenland
Summit Station. The site continues apace with science operations, but
[**[could]{.mark}** [be expanded in a]{.mark} more [robust **funding
environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and could therefore
[[support]{.mark} [infrastructure for]{.mark} larger-**scale
[transatlantic]{.mark} [science]{.mark} collaboration in the
future**]{.underline}. Ultimately, Summit Station could be a facility
with [increased support and logistical infrastructure at the level of US
facilities in the Antarctic]{.underline}, though **[[current funding
levels]{.mark} have [not]{.mark} yet [enabled]{.mark} such
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To move forward, the
**[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** and Europe
[[should]{.mark} [continue]{.mark} the longstanding tradition of
**leveraging** the significant **intellectual** capital and **practical
experience**]{.underline} that has been developed during seventy years
of **[[advancing scientific infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
Antarctica.\*

Washington and Brussels should also [harness the enthusiasm of its own
science community]{.underline}, as US and European researchers continue
to press for increased access to the Greenlandic ice sheet. Even with
its limitations, resulting research has yielded important gains for
increasing specialized expertise on what will be needed for a future of
increased Greenlandic operations. The deployment of an expanded Summit
Station, in addition to other **[[facilities in the global far
north]{.underline}]{.mark}**, is **[[not merely a plea from]{.mark} the
[US science community]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Greenlandic and Danish
governments continue to [[call for]{.mark}]{.underline}
Western---**[[specifically US]{.mark}---]{.underline}**foreign direct
investment across a variety of sectors in Greenland, including the
[[**deployment** of **research facilities**]{.mark} supported by
improved logistics]{.underline}. The Danish government identified such a
need for increased science infrastructure in its most recent Strategy
for the Arctic, stating that "...research and monitoring in the Arctic
puts a strain on resources and logistics and therefore international
cooperation on such projects must continue to be encouraged..."

An [[**increased scientific infrastructure presence** in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} transatlantic **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[will [allow]{.mark} [US]{.mark}]{.underline} and European [[researchers
to]{.mark} share their **intellectual** and **operational experience**
[with **policymakers**]{.mark}]{.underline} and private sector
contracting partners. This will in turn [**[increase transatlantic
capacity]{.mark}** and practical knowhow on best practices for deploying
and **[operating large-scale critical infrastructure]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline} across a myriad of other fields central to
[[mirroring]{.mark} recent strategic moves taken by [Russia and
China]{.mark}]{.underline}---[and [at a **price tag far lower**
than]{.mark} a **focus on**]{.underline} purely [[**commercial** or
**military**]{.mark} **infrastructure** investments]{.underline}. Taken
together with other initiatives, this multidisciplinary effort will
[contribute to **transatlantic [policy]{.mark} goals** to [extend
US]{.mark}]{.underline} and European [**[physical presence]{.mark}
across** the region]{.underline}, and should be a **[[key]{.mark}
consideration]{.underline}** as the Biden administration begins
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} plot and [execute]{.underline} its
**[[national security]{.mark} strategy]{.underline}** in the coming
months and years.

Similar to the previously established regional centers, the Stevens
Center serves as an instrument of policy and security cooperation.
However, unlike previous regional centers, the Stevens Center aligns
with [US national]{.underline} and DOD [strategy]{.underline}, as well
as specific guidance from the Office of the Secretary of Defense and
USNORTHCOM. Driven by the unique characteristics of the
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** region, it places a greater emphasis
on **[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** and analysis to address the
concerns of US and international policy makers and practitioners. These
concerns include [[enhancing]{.underline} **[domain
awareness]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[facilitating]{.underline}
**[decision]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[making]{.underline}**,
[[understanding **geophysical dynamics**]{.mark}, and assessing
**geostrategic challenges**, while also [addressing **regional climate
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In response to this guidance, the
Stevens Center organizes its programs and activities accordingly.

Since the arrival of the center's first employee in late August 2021,
the TSC has been engaged in a dual mission of **[[building
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** while actively implementing
initiatives. It achieved initial operational capacity on 1 July 2022,
and is diligently working towards achieving full operational capacity by
approximately 30 September 2024, following a "hub-and-network" approach.
This approach [[leverages]{.mark} [**experimentation** and
**innovation** to establish]{.mark} **networks** and solutions in
[support]{.mark} of]{.underline} [U.S.,]{.underline} allied, and partner
Arctic [defense and]{.underline} **[[security]{.mark}
efforts]{.underline}**. Over the span of 30 months, the center has
launched programs and activities across all three mission areas,
resulting in the education of more than 1,500 individuals. It has
conducted various engagement programs from Arctic Alaska to northern
Finland and has contributed to Arctic analyses through the establishment
of a new professional journal, publication of an initial set of special
reports, and determined support to the International Cooperative
Exchange Program for Polar Research.

The TSC is actively developing a wide range of curricula for a planned
two dozen practitioner courses, encompassing topics ranging from Arctic
security fundamentals to defense-specific programs, and incorporating
insights into Arctic Indigenous perspectives on security matters.
Similar strategies are being employed to address more than two dozen
**[[research]{.mark} tasks]{.underline}**, alongside a diverse approach
to outreach---spanning [**fieldwork**,]{.underline} conferences, and
digital engagement platforms[.]{.underline}

These efforts have already yielded early successes across the North
American and Trans-Atlantic Arctic regions. [New
[programs]{.mark}]{.underline} and activities are being implemented to
facilitate a deeper understanding of risks, support executive education
initiatives, conduct analyses, and engage at the strategic level. These
endeavors aim to [**[enhance]{.mark}** regional **[planning]{.mark}**,
**programs**, and **activities**,]{.underline} while
[**[enhancing]{.mark}** the **[security]{.mark}** of U.S]{.underline}.,
defense allies and security partners.

As previously discussed, [**[strategic competitors]{.mark}** of the
United States]{.underline}, its allies, and partners are challenging
established institutions of international law [in the
Arctic]{.underline} region, striving [to promote their own priorities,
and [**exploit** any **advantages**]{.mark} available to
them]{.underline}. Whether [through industrial development]{.underline},
political influence, or military capabilities, these competitors have
demonstrated their [intent [to **exert influence**]{.mark} over
Arctic-oriented nations for their own gain.]{.underline}

As **[[a soft-power complement]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} DOD's **[[integrated
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** measures, the TSC's mission does not
aim to achieve a traditional end state, but rather focuses on fostering
and maintaining ongoing processes that align with the strategies of the
White House, DOD, and specific directives from the Office of the
Secretary of Defense and commander of USNORTHCOM. Accordingly, the
center is developing a set of enduring conditions to guide its ongoing
efforts in implementing and advancing measures that support higher-level
strategies and directed guidance to the TSC. These [[enduring conditions
are]{.mark}:]{.underline}

Enduring Condition 1: [[**Advanced** **Arctic**
**Awareness**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [[Improve understanding of the
**operating environment**]{.underline}]{.mark}, challenges, and
opportunities [Arctic nations face]{.underline}, building awareness and
enhancing Arctic operations, capabilities, expertise, and cooperation in
the Arctic.

Enduring Condition 2: Advanced DoD Arctic Priorities. Improve Arctic
capabilities, domain awareness, polar communications, and ability to
conduct sustained multi-domain operations in the North American Arctic,
enhancing the defense of North America from the Northern Approach.

Enduring Condition 3: Reinforced Rules-based Order in the Arctic.
Enhance and maintain regional stability through strengthened
partnerships and unity of effort, reinforcing the rules-based order in
the Arctic.

Enduring Condition 4: **[[Effective Support to
Deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Contribute to U.S., allied, and
partner nation efforts in and across the Arctic region to
[**[deter]{.mark}** and **dissuade** strategic,]{.underline} regional,
and non-aligned [[**competitors** from challenging]{.mark} the existing
[rules-based order]{.mark} of the Arctic region]{.underline}.

Enduring Condition 5: Impacts of climate change in the Arctic region
understood and implemented/integrated into defense plans. [[**Enhanced**
Arctic climate change research and **knowledge** **contributes**
to]{.mark} advance [DoD's ability to]{.mark} plan for and
[operate]{.mark} in and [through the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}
confronting the United States and its allies and partners [continue to
[escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly [regarding]{.underline} the
[defense]{.underline} of North American homelands, organizations like
the HDI and the TSC have [[vital roles]{.mark} to play [in **assisting
policy makers**]{.mark} and practitioners better **anticipate** and
**proactively** shape measures to [**mitigate risks** and enhance
**integrated deterrence**]{.mark} efforts]{.underline}, both at home and
abroad.

Despite being in its formative stages, the Stevens Center is committed
to [[innovation, **experimentation**]{.mark}, **education**,
**analysis**, and engagement as the [**linchpin** of **soft
power**]{.mark} [within]{.mark}]{.underline} the DOD's **[[Arctic
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Accordingly, the TSC will strive to
[[**advance** **awareness**]{.underline} [of Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}
issues, **[[address]{.underline}]{.mark}** the implications of
**[[environmental change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and emphasize the
significance of [upholding a rules-based order in the
region]{.underline}. Through collaborative and [respectful
coordination]{.underline}, this emerging institution aims to
[[foster]{.mark} a **[peaceful]{.mark}** and [**stable**
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, where international cooperation
grounded in shared values is paramount.

cumulative **[[emissions from the entire U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates at its current rate. To put it another
way, permafrost thaw emissions could use up between 25 and 40 percent of
the remaining carbon budget that would be necessary to cap warming at
the internationally agreed-upon 2 degrees Celsius global temperature
threshold established in the Paris Agreement.

[[Arctic tundra and its permafrost]{.mark} soils [contain more than half
of all terrestrial belowground organic carbon]{.mark} (OC) in a
perennially frozen state [that is]{.mark} increasingly [threatened by
climate change]{.mark}. Recent [warming in the Arctic has **already
increased**]{.mark} soil [temperatures and thawed large areas of
permafrost]{.mark} [that]{.mark} may [trigger increased microbial
activity]{.mark}, **[leading to]{.mark} [faster]{.mark} degradation of
previously-frozen OC and the [release of CO2 and CH4 to the
atmosphere]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Yet it remains uncertain how the soil
microbiome will respond to permafrost thaw or modulate the relative
proportions of CO2 and CH4 produced by the decomposition of OC in
thawing permafrost soils. In the previous chapters of this dissertation,
I described a series of field observations, manipulations, and
laboratory incubations to answer the following questions: (1) How does
rainfall-induced soil oxidation alter anoxic redox conditions and the
composition of the microbiome in thawing permafrost soils; (2) How does
summer thaw duration correlate with the composition of the soil
microbiome by depth; and (3) How does extended thaw duration shift the
composition and genomic potential of soil microbiome within distinct
soil layers along the soil profiles of Arctic tundra (see Figure 1.1).
The following are conclusions based on these research questions. Thaw
duration is a strong environmental factor that operates over time and
space to regulate the composition of the surface active-layer,
transition-zone, and deeper permafrost microbiomes in arctic tundra
soils. The results presented in Chapter 3 indicate that differences in
thaw duration by soil depth also account for regional differences in
dominant microbial taxa between sites and tundra types that could not be
explained by differences in abiotic soil properties (Figure 3.3).
Furthermore, long-term thaw surveys indicate that while [[thaw depth is
increasing over time]{.mark} (last \~20-30 years), **the transition-zone
[microbiome is still indistinguishable from the permafrost
microbiom]{.mark}**[e]{.mark} (Figure 3.4). This suggests that [thaw
duration in the transition zone is still too low to shift the
transition-zone microbiome composition away from]{.mark} that in the
[permafrost]{.mark} [and toward]{.mark} that in [the active
layer]{.mark}. [As climate warming continues]{.mark} and thaw duration
increases at depth, I predict that for [any tundra soil]{.mark} the
microbiome composition (and thus function) [will shift]{.mark} from the
relic permafrost taxa [toward current active-layer taxa]{.mark}. The
strong correlations between microbiome composition and thaw duration
from my soil profile surveys (Figure 3.5) **imply that [monitoring thaw
duration and microbiome composition at depth may help predict the
microbial response to future permafrost thaw]{.mark}**]{.underline}

It starts with a crack in the ice. Then another. Beneath the frozen soil
of the Arctic, something ancient is waking up --- and it's not a
mammoth. **[In recent years, [scientists]{.mark} have [revived

[experiments]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As climate change accelerates the
thawing of Earth\'s oldest ice, some researchers are asking a startling
question: What happens when the microbial past collides with the modern
world? Permafrost is ground that's remained frozen for at least two
consecutive years --- and in some regions of the Arctic, it's been
frozen for tens of thousands. It stretches across vast expanses of
Siberia, Alaska, northern Canada, and Greenland, acting as a natural
deep freezer for ancient organic material. **[[As global

[permafrost is]{.mark}n't just melting---it's [unlocking a biological

deadly contagion emerging from ancient ice sounds like science fiction
--- and in some ways, it is. One of the most compelling recent examples
is HBO's hit series The Last of Us, which imagines a global fungal
pandemic triggered by rising temperatures. In the show's opening scene,
a scientist warns that climate change could push certain pathogens ---
like Cordyceps --- to evolve the ability to survive in the human body,
setting off a chain reaction of infection and collapse. The series,
adapted from the critically acclaimed video game of the same name,
became a cultural phenomenon. What resonated with many viewers wasn't
just the drama but the premise: warming temperatures could turn
once-benign organisms into global threats. While The Last of Us focuses
on fungi, the broader message mirrors **[real scientific concerns about
climate change reintroducing or reshaping pathogens that have long been
thought to be buried by time.]{.underline}** **[[In 2016, an anthrax

Could an ancient virus be similarly reactivated and infect humans today?
Possibly---but not easily. Most of the viruses revived so far only
infect amoebas, not animals or humans. However, viral evolution is
unpredictable. With the right conditions and intermediate hosts, there
is a theoretical risk that an ancient virus could adapt to infect new
species, including humans. **[Spillover events like these are [not

#### Permafrost Is Releasing Pathogens Now

[researchers believe the outbreak is a sign of things to come. As
climate change rapidly warms the Artic, scientists say it could unleash
a wave of potentially deadly microbes]{.underline} that for centuries
have been trapped in ice. That threat is being highlighted in Navigating
New Horizons, a report from the United Nations Environment Programme
[(UNEP)]{.underline} [and the International Science Council]{.underline}
that [explores emerging challenges to planetary health and human
wellbeing. ]{.underline}   "The fact that these microbes are present in
the permafrost means it's hard to say how widespread, or dangerous, this
problem could be," says Andrea Hinwood, UNEP's Chief Scientist. "But
[there are reasons to be concerned]{.underline}." The Arctic, which
spans 14 million square kilometres across eight countries, is covered by
a layer of thick permafrost, a frozen mixture of soil, rocks, ice and
organic material. However, [the Arctic is warming four times faster than
the rest of the globe, with thawing permafrost potentially setting free
ancient bacteria and viruses,]{.underline} experts say. According to a
study in the journal Environmental Sustainability[, an estimated four
sextillion microbes -- that's a four with 21 zeros -- are released
annually]{.underline} due to thawing permafrost. Some [researchers are
especially worried about the thawing of long-dead Arctic animals, whose
bodies may house dormant microbes.]{.underline} The Siberian outbreak
was traced to a reindeer burial ground; many of those animals died more
than 70 years ago from anthrax[. Hinwood says what is playing out in the
Artic has taken place in warmer climates for centuries,]{.underline}
with [pathogens hopping between people and animals**, often with deadly
results.**]{.underline} "This is not a new phenomenon but it's happening
in a new place." Reindeers in Norway's Arctic Circle Experts worry that
diseases from animals, like reindeer, may jump to humans as global
warming opens up the Arctic to shipping and mining. Credit: Biosphoto
via AFP/Martin Zwick As warming opens the Artic to shipping, mining and
other industries, Hinwood says that could put more people in close
proximity to thawed permafrost and its resident microbes. "We could be
witnessing a complete change of land use in the Arctic and that could be
dangerous," she said. The spread of disease isn't the only problem with
the thawing of the Arctic. Related Ilustração de micróbios Story What is
antimicrobial resistance and why is it a growing threat? The [world's
permafrost contains an estimated 1,500 gigatonnes of
carbon]{.underline}, about twice as much as the atmosphere. As
permafrost thaws, its carbon is broken down and released into the
atmosphere as carbon dioxide or methane. Those greenhouse [gases warm
the planet further, melting more permafrost in a potentially
catastrophic cycle]{.underline}. To avert runaway climate change and
disease outbreak, Hinwood says the world must rein in the greenhouse
gases driving climate change. Countries also need to continue to monitor
receding permafrost and invest in charting the types of microbes that
reside there. "At the moment, we are very much in an 'if-and-maybe
scenario'," she says. "There is a lot of uncertainty and the best we can
do is use the tools and science we have to inform ourselves."

By the Holocene optimum (\~9,000 -- 5,000 years ago), most permafrost
disappeared from Europe because of warming temperatures, especially at
the continental shelves due to sea level rise. Following that period,
the climate cooled again, and for the past 5,000 years, new permafrost
has formed, largely reflecting present-day distribution. During the
Little Ice Age, new permafrost formed, usually near the southern
boundary of permafrost extent. However, when permafrost degrades, the
newest permafrost thaws first. After the conditions of the Little Ice
Age ended, [the most [recently]{.mark} [formed permafrost began]{.mark}
[to thaw]{.mark} or disappeared completely.]{.underline} Late Holocene
[**[permafrost was stable]{.mark}** for some time, [**but it has also
now started to thaw**.]{.mark}]{.underline} This thaw is widespread and
slow. Dr. [Romanovsky noted that in some places, [**there is currently a
layer of former permafrost that does not freeze at all** during the
winter]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} an important threshold identified
by researchers. Gradually, parts of the upper permafrost are introduced
to the active layer (which freezes in winter and thaws in summer), and
are incorporated into this seasonal process. [Although this transition
of permafrost to the active layer is only on the order of a few 10s of
centimeters, [it is]{.mark} a [widespread]{.mark} occurrence [and the
volume]{.mark} of material involved [could be
substantial]{.mark}.]{.underline} The changes are not linear year to
year, but over the long term, [**there is a steady increase in the
freeze/thaw depth**.]{.underline}

Dr. Romanovsky also remarked on the importance of understanding abrupt
permafrost thaw**[. [With]{.mark} this type of [abrupt change,]{.mark}
he noted that [the age of the permafrost is not as important as the
processes on the surface, which have]{.mark} a [greater
impact]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Some climatic and [weather conditions
can cause permafrost to thaw deep enough to]{.mark} melt ice and [create
ground subsidence]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., sinking or settling of the
ground surface[), the ground subsidence then fills with water, which
[causes]{.mark} the process to accelerate on itself.]{.underline}
Weather conditions, forest fires, and other disturbances can trigger
these conditions. [Permafrost **[degradation under lakes]{.mark},
[movement of thawed material]{.mark}s near riverbanks, [and coastal
erosion]{.mark} [due to increasing temp]{.mark}eratures may also
[contribute to]{.mark} abrupt [thaw]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These
processes are local [**but [the thaw persists]{.mark}** and accelerates
through all ages of permafrost.]{.underline} Questions remain regarding
[[the significance of]{.mark} these [two]{.mark} different
[processe]{.mark}s (annual seasonal permafrost thaw versus abrupt
events) **[for release of microbes]{.mark} or genetic material** and
which of these may be more likely to [lead to emergence
events]{.mark}]{.underline}

Dr. Romanovsky concluded [his remarks noting that **[ongoing modeling
efforts project continued climatic warming]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even
assuming relatively moderate warming[, late Holocene [permafrost
a]{.mark}nd permafrost from the last glaciation [will continue to thaw
by mid-century]{.mark}.]{.underline} [By the end of the century,
**[about 60 percent of permafrost]{.mark} will be [in the process of
thawing.]{.mark}** With higher climate warming scenarios, **about [75
percent of the north slope of Alaska permafrost will be thawing]{.mark}
by the end of the century.**]{.underline}

Dr. Osterhaus pointed out [**that [higher ambient temperatures in the
Arctic]{.mark} could [result in increased foodborne]{.mark} diseases**,
**[waterborne]{.mark} infections in humans**, and changes in the
migratory pathways of animal host populations and their contacts
including changing rodent and fox populations, **[as well as]{.mark} the
northern range [of vectorborne diseases]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Parkinson and Butler, 2005). For example, a 2005 study showed that [[an
outbreak of Vibro parahaemolyticus]{.underline}]{.mark} (which causes
gastrointestinal illnesses in humans) [o[ccurred]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
farmed Alaskan [oysters when **the temperature of the seawater rose
above 15 degrees**]{.mark} **Celsius**]{.underline} (McLaughlin et al.,
2005; Figure 4). Other examples shared by Dr. Osterhaus include
tick-borne encephalitis in Europe and Asia, primarily located in the
"tick belt" that stretches across the continent. The width of the belt
and the extent of viral disease spread by vector distribution is largely
determined by the climate. [[When the climate warms]{.mark}, as is
occurring today, the **[belt widens and extends disease spread]{.mark}
into areas that have traditionally not been affected**.]{.underline}
West Nile Virus (transmitted to horses and humans by mosquitos and
carried by birds), was first discovered in the U.S. in 1999 after being
introduced by air travel of infected humans, and is spreading across the
entire U.S., causing the death of a few hundred people every year.
Importantly, the survival of the mosquitos that transmit this disease is
dependent on the climate. As temperature warms, the distribution of
these mosquitos has increased to parts of Canada and the Arctic (Figure
5[). As noted earlier, animal [populations are changing]{.mark} and
[modeling shows]{.mark} that [this will]{.mark} likely
[continue]{.mark}, due in part to habitat change. As another example,
some modeling studies show that **Arctic fox populations are changing
and that climate change will have an effect on cases of rabies in the
Arctic.** [New]{.mark} molecular [techniques]{.mark} and technologies
[enable]{.mark} **the [identification of viral pathogens]{.mark} [more
effectively]{.mark}** than previous methods of isolating viruses. Many
of the [viruses detected]{.mark} in the past few decades [have some
connection to changing climate]{.mark} and changing
conditions.]{.underline} Dr. Osterhaus discussed an example of the
changing migratory patterns of harp seals and the associated spread of
Morbilliviruses, which have been detected crossing species barriers
(e.g., Jo et al., 2018, 2019). [[Full-length sequencing]{.mark} of
viruses [can be obtained]{.mark} much more quickly now than in the past,
and combined with phylogenetic trees, **[the origins of a virus can be
detected.]{.mark}** This is a powerful tool to trace where viruses
originate and how they cross species barriers (e.g., Jo et al., 2018,
2019). Using new data and sequencing, analyses can be used to
detect,]{.underline} for example, the origin and emergence of ancient
hepatitis B viruses (Muhlemann et al., 2018). Material from corpses was
used to detect fragments of DNA from thousands of years ago. [[The key
unknown is how long]{.mark} the [viruses]{.mark} can actually [survive
in]{.mark} the [permafrost]{.mark}. It is known, for instance, that
poxviruses and anthrax can survive for quite a long time, on the order
of hundreds of years, but the possibility of finding whole genomes is
unknown.]{.underline} Migratory birds are infected with Influenza A
viruses in a subclinical way, and can directly transmit viruses to other
species including humans. In fact, it was not considered possible for
birds to spread avian viruses to humans until the late 1990s when
confirmed human cases were discovered in Hong Kong. Focusing
specifically on H5N1, Dr. Osterhaus demonstrated that it has mutated and
spread throughout South East Asia, Europe, and Africa. Although the
disease is fatal in tufted ducks (and to some extent, pochards), it
appears not to be fatal for some wild duck species, particularly
mallards (Keawcharoen et al., 2008). These species are capable of
surviving and spreading the disease, and their migratory patterns may
potentially shift due to climate change. This has implications for the
spread of this disease beyond known areas (Verhagen et al., 2015). Most
of the H5N1 outbreaks in European wild birds were concentrated in areas
of open water, where surface temperatures were above freezing (Reperant
et al., 2010). Dr. Osterhaus also explored the factors that make a
pandemic virus. An experiment of passing a virus over the upper
respiratory tract of ferrets showed that only five mutations were needed
to change from a virus that does not efficiently spread, into a virus
that can be easily spread (Herfst et al., 2012; Linster et al., 2014;
Munster et al., 2009; Russel et al., 2012). Although this type of lab
experimentation can be controversial, a similar phenomenon was detected
in nature where a virus (H10N7) spilled over from ducks to seals. The
original virus was purely avian, but it changed over time to a virus
that spread from seal to seal (Bodewes et al., 2016). At the conclusion
of his talk, Dr. Osterhaus noted that [a mix **of [unprecedented]{.mark}
and complex anthropogenic (or human-driven) [changes]{.mark} are
[drive]{.mark}rs of [infectious disease]{.mark} [emergence]{.mark} in
animals and humans**.]{.underline} [This implies that **[several
diseases that could not spread in the past can spread today]{.mark}**.
Potential reversal or mitigating options for these changes may be topics
of interest to the scientific community, and preparedness could be
**based on increased capabilities in terms of syndromic surveillance in
humans and animals, pathogen discovery,** development of diagnostics,
improved animal and mathematical modeling capacity, and **[platforms for
pathogenesis study, preventive intervention, and
therapeutics]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In the last 10 years, [warming in the [Arctic]{.mark} has [outpaced
projections]{.mark} so rapidly that [scientists]{.mark} are now
[suggesting]{.mark} that the [poles]{.mark} are [warming four times
faster than]{.mark} the [rest]{.mark} of the globe. This has led to
glacier melt and permafrost [thaw levels that weren't forecast to happen
until 2050 or later]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Siberia and northern
Canada, [this abrupt thaw has created sunken landforms, known as
thermokarst, where the oldest and deepest permafrost is exposed to the
warm air for the first time in hundreds or even thousands of
years.]{.underline}

[As the global climate continues to warm]{.underline}, many questions
remain about the periglacial environment. Among them: as water
infiltration increases, [will permafrost thaw more rapidly?]{.underline}
And, if so, [what [long-frozen organisms might "wake
up"]{.mark}?]{.underline}

[Permafrost covers 24 percent of the Earth's land surface, and the soil
constituents vary with local geology. Arctic lands offer [unexplored
microbial biodiversity and microbial feedbacks, including the release of
carbon to the atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}. In some locations,
[hundreds of millions of years' worth of carbon is buried.]{.underline}
The layers may still contain ancient frozen microbes, Pleistocene
megafauna and even buried smallpox victims.[[As]{.mark} the [permafrost
thaws]{.mark} with increasing rapidity, scientists' emerging challenge
is to discover and identify the [microbes, bacteria and viruses]{.mark}
that [may be stirring]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Some of these microbes are known to scientists. Methanogenic Archaea,
for example metabolize soil carbon to release methane, a potent
greenhouse gas. Other permafrost microbes (methanotrophs) consume
methane. The balance between these microbes plays a critical role in
determining future climate warming.

Others are known but have unpredictable behavior after release. New
evidence of genes moving between thawing ecosystems indicates a
restructuring at multiple levels. In the Arctic Ocean, planktonic
Chloroflexi bacteria recently acquired genes used for degrading carbon
from land-based Actinobacteria species[. As melt-swollen Arctic rivers
carried sediments from thawing permafrost to the sea, the genes for
processing permafrost carbon were also transported.]{.underline}

[[Permafrost thaw in Siberia led to a 2016 anthrax outbreak]{.mark} and
the [death of 200,000 reindeer and a child]{.mark}]{.underline}.\* But
the hardy spores of Bacillus anthracis may represent an exception to the
brutal freeze-thaw cycle that degrades more delicate bacterial and viral
pathogens. Their adaptable characteristics have allowed them to remain
frozen and viable over centuries of inactivity.

Organisms that co-evolved within now-extinct ecosystems from the
Cenozoic to the Pleistocene may also emerge and interact with our modern
environment in entirely novel ways. A potential example, the
[[emerging]{.underline}]{.mark} Orthopoxvirus [[species]{.mark}
Alaskapox [causing skin lesions]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [has
appeared]{.underline}]{.mark} and disappeared in Alaska twice in the
last five years. It is possible that the virus was transmitted through
animal-human contact, [but this novel [virus's origin remains
unknown]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The [microbiomes of the Arctic contain resilient and tenacious
cold-adapted microbes]{.mark}. Some species survive as
[psychrophiles]{.mark},]{.underline} [a type of specialist specieshighly
adapted to prolonged exposure to subfreezing conditions.]{.underline}
[These species may be lost with warming. Others survive by being highly
adaptable, inhabiting many, varied niches. Understanding more about
these generalists' ecology and genomic diversity offers a window into
the microbiome of the New Arctic.]{.underline} These generalist microbes
that adapt to diverse conditions are the likely winners, as we lose the
cryosphere.

[And then there are microbes that are entirely unfamiliar to scientists,
which may represent a [novel threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It is clear that the warmer we make the Arctic, the weirder it will get,
as temperatures at the surface become more extreme and thawing deepens.
[With the coalescence of microbes reawakening from the deep and surface
conditions unprecedented in human history, it is [challenging to assess
risks accurately without improved Arctic microbial datasets]{.mark}. We
should pay attention to both known unknowns[, such as
antibiotic-resistant bacteria,and unknown unknowns]{.mark}, including
the potential risks from the [resurrection of ancient and poorly
described viral genomes]{.mark} from Arctic ice by synthetic
biologists.]{.underline}

For all of these reasons[, **[we must come up with guidelines for future
Arctic research]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As travel through the region
increases, the likelihood of pathogen export and import rises as
well.]{.underline} The planetary protection guidelines that space
agencies follow to prevent interplanetary contamination can provide a
framework for how microbial investigation can safely continue.
Biosurveillance measures must be put into place to protect communities
in the Arctic and beyond[. As the Arctic continues to transform, one
thing is clear: as climate change warms this microbial repository during
the 21st century, [the full range of consequences is yet to be
told.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In August 2016, an [[outbreak of anthrax]{.mark} in Siberia
[sickened]{.mark} 72 [people]{.mark} and [took the life of a]{.mark}
12-year-old [boy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Health officials pinpointed the
outbreak to an unusual source. Abnormally high temperatures had [[thawed
the corpses]{.mark} of [long-dead]{.mark} reindeer and other
[animals]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some of these bodies may have been
[[infected]{.mark} with anthrax]{.underline}, and as Wired explained,
the soil in Siberia is normally much too cold to dig deep graves. "The
[[disease from thawing]{.mark} human and animal [remains can get
into]{.mark} ground[water]{.mark} that people then drink]{.underline},"
Wired reported. Scientists are worried that as more permafrost thaws,
especially in Siberia, there may be [[more outbreaks of long-dormant
anthrax]{.mark} as burial grounds thaw]{.underline}. That's because the
[deep freeze of the permafrost [doesn't just keep carbon]{.mark} from
escaping --- [it keeps microbes intact]{.mark} as well]{.underline}.
Permafrost is the place to preserve bacteria and viruses for hundreds of
thousands --- if not a million --- years, explains Jean-Michel Claverie,
a genomics researcher who studies ancient viruses and bacteria. "It is
dark, it is cold, and it is also without oxygen. ... There is no
\[ultraviolet\] light." [All the [bacteria need is a thaw to wake back
up]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[If you take a yogurt and put it in permafrost
\[that remains frozen\], I'm sure in 10,000 years from now it still will
be good to eat]{.underline}," he said in a 2017 interview. Claverie is
part of a scientific team that determined it's possible to revive
30,000-year-old viruses trapped in the permafrost. His work is centered
on viruses that infect amoebas, not humans. But there's [no reason why a
flu virus, smallpox, or some long-lost human infection couldn't be
revived the same way]{.underline}. These microbes are like [[time
travelers]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and they could [thrive waking up in
an age when [humans have lost an immune defense]{.mark} against
them]{.underline}. I asked Claverie if there's an upper limit to how
long viruses and (certain types of) bacteria could survive in the
permafrost. "[The [limit is the limit given by the
permafrost]{.mark},]{.underline}" he explained, meaning he sees no
limit. Permafrost is 1,000 meters deep in places, "which make it about a
[million, [1.5 million year old]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said. The
danger here, he emphasized, is not from the slow thawing of the
permafrost itself. That is, if the permafrost melts, and we leave the
land alone, we're unlikely to come into contact with ancient deadly
diseases. The fear is that the thawing will encourage greater excavation
in the Arctic. Mining and other excavation projects will become more
appealing as the region grows warmer. And these projects can put workers
into contact with some very, very old bugs.

Known to be a vast repository of ancient viable microorganisms,
[[permafrost]{.mark} [has rich microbial diversity]{.mark}, including
[virus, bacteria, and fungi]{.mark}]{.underline} (Table 1) \[73\]. These
ancient "Methuselah" [[extremophiles]{.mark} can remain [dormant for
millions of years]{.mark}, retaining their viability with uncertain
consequences upon reactivation]{.underline} (from permafrost thaw)
\[13\]. What sets permafrost apart from other cold environments (e.g.,
sea ice and glaciers) is [its heterogeneity in age, physical structure,
formation process, ground-ice content, and organic matter
content]{.underline} \[73\], \[74\]. Consequently, this heterogeneous
environment results in a [diverse microbiome]{.underline}.

\[TABLE OMITTED\]

Several types of [[bacteria]{.mark} capable of [altering the
biogeochemical cycles exist within
permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} such as [[methanogens that
produce methane]{.mark}, methanotrophs that consume
methane]{.underline}, iron(III)-reducers that cause iron mobilization,
sulfate-reducers that influence sulfur cycling, and ammonia-oxidizing
bacteria that oxidize ammonia to nitrite \[73\], \[75\] (Table 1). With
increasing temperature, previously frozen soil organic matter and
nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus become more accessible to these
microorganisms, increasing microbial activity \[73\]. Consequently,
trapped organic matter undergoes microbial degradation, soil carbon
losses are amplified and greenhouse gases like CO2, CH4 and N2O are
emitted into the environment in the process \[76\], \[77\].

[[Microorganisms]{.mark} also [influence the fate of metals released
from thawing permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}. In thermokarst wetlands,
anaerobic microbes accelerate the methylation of thaw derived inorganic
mercury, transforming it into methylmercury - the most toxic form of the
metal \[78\], \[79\]. The high toxicity of methylmercury not only
increases the risks associated with mercury-cycling in thawing
permafrost systems but also contributes to its bioaccumulation in Arctic
food webs, increasing health risks of the Northern communities \[26\].
In the anoxic active layer, heterotrophic anaerobic microorganisms
degrade the labile organic matter. This process promotes the reductive
dissolution of iron (III) and manganese (IV) oxides, mobilizing
redox-sensitive metals, such as arsenic and facilitating their transport
to surface waters \[26\]. Additionally, microbial oxidation of sulfide
minerals in thawing permafrost has been linked to the discoloration or
"rusting" of Arctic waterbodies \[26\], \[80\].

These soil systems not only contain [[microbes]{.mark} that [influence
biogeochemical cycling]{.mark}, but also [ancient pathogens that could
become hazardous]{.mark} when released upon thawing]{.underline}. For
instance, researchers have recovered [preserved human and animal
pathogens]{.underline} (e.g., Bacillus anthracis in Siberian permafrost,
Variola virus (smallpox) in the Swedish Arctic, Alaskapox virus (now
renamed borealpox virus) in Fairbanks, Alaska) \[8\], \[81\] as well as
plant pathogens (e.g., ancient caribou feces-associated virus in
northwest Canada, psychrophilic/psychrotolerant fungi in Siberia, and
tomato mosaic virus in Greenland) from permafrost \[82\], \[83\]. Viable
[[insect pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}, e.g., ancient Northwest
Territories Cripavirus in the sub-Arctic and Hypocrealean Fungi in
Siberia \[82\] also [have been [recovered from permafrost
cores]{.mark}.]{.underline} The diversity of the [permafrost microbiome
is substantial]{.underline}. For example, 1907 previously
uncharacterized viral populations were recovered across a permafrost
gradient in Sweden, with 58 % of these previously unknown viruses found
to be still active \[13\]. Even more concerning is the presence of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the depths of permafrost (\>3 m), which
have not yet interacted with modern antibiotics \[13\]. Such findings
[raise concerns over the [re-emergence of these ancient pathogenic
microorganisms as permafrost continues to thaw under warming climatic
conditions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Permafrost thaw releases zoonotic zombie pathogens further aggravated
by climate change**

) //ASingh

No organisms---[except possibly [microbes]{.mark}---are prepared to
[adapt to the unstable climate regime the Earth has
entered]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Humans are far behind the curve in
adapting to the climate change they have caused with their carbon
dioxide emissions, particularly as regards the climate-driven spread of
pathogens]{.underline}. The tropics have been a focus of concern about
climate and disease, [as [warming causes insects and other disease
vectors]{.mark} to spread away from the equator. But while [diseases
from the south, such as dengue fever, Ebola, and Zika]{.mark}, are clear
dangers that occupy most of the attention of infectious disease
epidemiologists, few [researchers are looking for new or ancient Arctic
pathogens that current generations of humans have never been exposed
to]{.mark}.]{.underline}

One research team [described [permafrost]{.mark} as "a reservoir of
minimally characterized microbial life" that [can hold thousands of
species]{.mark}, very few of which have been studied]{.underline}.
Because there is so little information, most experts caution that
[trying to [assess the microbial risk in and from the Arctic is
speculative]{.mark}. But others point out that when data is sparse,
informed hypothesizing can lead to an improved strategy for responding
to crises now unforeseen.]{.underline}

Recently there's been a lot of [press [coverage of "zombie viruses"
bursting out of thawing permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [bodies of
people and animals buried in permafrost a few centuries ago have
contained potentially infectious variants of smallpox, anthrax, and
influenza, but because of this risk, most scientists have expressed
little interest in studying zombie viruses]{.underline}---especially
smallpox---in a lab.

There is little agreement among experts as to the risks of "zombie"
pathogens spreading into the larger world population. Some research
establishes that even very old permafrost microbes can be viable.

But Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East
Anglia who has studied Covid and infectious diseases related to extreme
weather, is not worried about the viruses that have actually been
revived from permafrost because "none of them are human pathogens,
they're all protozoan viruses." Further, Hunter says, because all the
"zombie viruses" that are human pathogens are familiar, if they are
revived they can be handled with vaccines and antibiotics. "Currently
there's nothing to suggest there would be something coming out that
would be a new disease that would infect humans," he adds. Much of the
viral DNA found in permafrost is degraded, so even if the viruses remain
intact, they are unlikely to be infectious.

But [zombies may be [the least of our Arctic disease
worrie]{.mark}s]{.underline}.

Arctic [microbes are far more diverse and complex than the few familiar
viruses identified so far in frozen bodies that have thawed, and they
present very real risks to humans and other animals]{.underline}. Unlike
Antarctica, the Arctic is home to millions of people (estimates range
from four million to 13 million). [Pathogens are moving both southward
from and northward into Arctic regions through many routes, and people
in the Arctic are bearing the brunt of them.]{.underline} [[Indigenous
residents and mobile workers]{.mark} in mining and fossil fuel
extraction industries face the most immediate risks from the mingling of
previously separated ecologies[. Climate change also promises to
aggravate zoonosis, or diseases that jump from animals to people]{.mark}
(and vice versa).]{.underline} Finally, there are risks from global
atmospheric transport of microbes and from gene exchanges among
[formerly separated [microbial populations that may create new
diseases]{.mark} or worsen old ones.]{.underline}

\[IMAGES OMITTED\]

The permafrost problem

[[Climate change has a clear and disturbing effect on infectious
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}. A 2022 study by University of Hawai'i
ecologist Camilo Mora and colleagues found that of "375 infectious
diseases documented to have impacted humanity, 218 were found to be
aggravated by climatic hazards." Warming, precipitation, floods, and
drought exacerbated 103 vector-borne, 78 waterborne, and 60 airborne
diseases, most caused by viruses and bacteria, with lesser involvement
of fungi and protozoans. And these were only diseases already known to
science.

[[Climate change is dramatically affecting permafrost]{.mark}, a loose
conglomerate of rock, soil, plant matter, ice and microbes, with a thin
top layer that melts and refreezes seasonally]{.underline}; it covers
about 25 percent of the Northern Hemisphere's land surface. Estimates of
the oldest permafrost in the northern hemisphere, in Siberia's Kolyma
region, range between one million and three million years.

The [combined mass of continuous permafrost in the Arctic and Tibetan
Plateau is nearly 11 million square kilometers; by contrast,
Antarctica's permafrost covers at most about 71,000 km2. Russia is far
and away the possessor of the most Arctic permafrost]{.underline}, a
fact that causes problems for the rest of the world, given Russia's war
aims and unwillingness to share information.

\[IMAGE OMITTED\]

Humans living in the Arctic have in recent centuries built their
residences, businesses, and other infrastructure atop permafrost, which
served as a sort of perpetual foundation. Now, as climate change
proceeds, [[permafrost is collapsing]{.mark} across the North,
destroying water systems, roads, buildings, and pipelines and leading to
[contamination of areas humans use]{.mark}.]{.underline} Permafrost
collapse generates new lakes that can join up with surface streams and
carry microbes into the ocean. Open-pit mines, eroded bluffs, and
sinkholes expose ancient organic matter. I[n addition to bacteria and
viruses, fungi, lichens, and even nematode worms have been revived from
permafrost]{.underline}. So while there is some reason to avoid panic
about [[zombie microbe]{.mark}s, humans do face the possibility of
meeting up with the vast, newly exposed [microbial storehouse released
from permafrost]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But when it comes to the Arctic, [[temperatures in the region]{.mark}

exceed the global average.

Sea ice loss and global impacts

Rapidly warming [[Arctic temperatures]{.mark} are [having profound
effects]{.mark} on global weather patterns and ecosystems]{.underline},
contributing significantly to the loss of sea ice.

Sea ice in key regions---including the Barents Sea, Bering Sea, and Sea
of Okhotsk---is expected to continue shrinking between 2025 and 2029,
the WMO said.

"For Arctic sea ice in September (at its minimum extent) from 2025 to
2029, large reductions are predicted in all regions that typically
experience sea ice at this time of year," the report stated.

"The ability to predict anomalies at the sea-ice edge is highly
accurate, so there is strong confidence in these projected reductions."

However, Canada's Arctic Archipelago is an exception, where there is
less certainty about the changes over the next five years.

#### New and dangerous zombie viruses in the Arctic call for increased research and development- solves.

for The Guardian.) Increased Siberian, 1-21-2024, \"Arctic zombie
viruses in Siberia could spark terrifying new pandemic, scientists

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/21/arctic-zombie-viruses-in-siberia-could-spark-terrifying-new-pandemic-scientists-warn,
{DOA 6-27-2025 \|\| kibby}

[Humanity is facing a bizarre new pandemic threat, scientists have
warned. Ancient viruses frozen in the Arctic permafrost could one day be
released by Earth's warming climate and unleash a major disease
outbreak, they say. **[Strains of these Methuselah microbes -- or zombie
viruses as they are also known -- have already been isolated by
researchers who have raised fears that a new global medical emergency
could be triggered]{.mark}** -- **not by an illness new to science but
[by a disease from the distant past]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a result,
scientists have begun planning an [**[Arctic monitoring network]{.mark}
that [would pinpoint]{.mark} early cases of a [disease]{.mark} [caused
by ancient micro-organisms]{.mark}. Additionally, it would [provide
quarantine and]{.mark} expert medical [treatment for infected
people]{.mark} in a bid [to contain an outbreak, and prevent infected
people from leaving the region]{.mark}. "At the moment, analyses of
pandemic threats focus on diseases that might emerge in southern regions
and then spread north,"** said geneticist Jean-Michel Claverie of
Aix-Marseille University. "**By contrast, little attention has been
given to an outbreak that might emerge in the far north and then travel
south -- and that is an oversight, I believe. [There are viruses up
there that have the potential to infect humans and start a new disease
outbreak."]{.mark}**]{.underline} This point was backed by virologist
Marion Koopmans of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. "We don't
know what viruses are lying out there in the permafrost but I think
**[[there is a real risk]{.mark} that there might be one capable of
triggering a disease outbreak -- say of an ancient form of polio[. We
have to assume that something like this could
happen."]{.mark}]{.underline}** In 2014, Claverie led a team of
scientists who **[[isolated live viruses in Siberia]{.mark} and showed
they [could]{.mark} still [infect single-cell organisms]{.mark} -- even
though they had been [buried in permafrost for thousands of years.
Further research]{.mark}, published last year, [revealed]{.mark} the
existence of several different [viral strains from seven different sites
in Siberia and showed these could infect cultured
cells]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One virus sample was 48,500 years old.
"The viruses we isolated were only able to infect amoebae and posed no
risk to humans," said Claverie. "However, that does not mean that other
viruses -- currently frozen in the permafrost -- might not be able to
trigger illnesses in humans. We have identified [genomic traces of
poxviruses and herpesviruses, which are well known human
pathogens]{.underline}, for example." Permafrost covers a fifth of the
northern hemisphere and is made up of soil that has been kept at
temperatures below zero for long periods. Some layers have remained
frozen for hundreds of thousands of years, scientists have discovered.
"[The crucial point about permafrost is that it is cold, dark and lacks
oxygen, which is perfect for preserving biological
material,]{.underline}"

#### Increased development in the Arctic directly contributes to the release of ancient pathogens.

**McKie 24** (Robin McKie is a former science and environmental editor
for The Guardian.) Increased Siberian, 1-21-2024, \"Arctic zombie
viruses in Siberia could spark terrifying new pandemic, scientists

Claverie told the Observer last week. "You could put a yoghurt in
permafrost and it might still be edible 50,000 years later." [But the
world's **[permafrost is changing]{.mark}**. The upper layers of the
planet's main reserves -- **in Canada, Siberia and Alaska -- are
[melting as climate change affects the Arctic
disproportionately]{.mark}. According to meteorologists, the region is
[heating up several times faster than]{.mark} the [average]{.mark} rate
of increase in global warming**]{.underline}. However, it is not melting
permafrost directly that poses the most immediate risk, added Claverie.
"[**[The danger comes from another global warming impact: the
disappearance of Arctic sea ice]{.mark}**. That is **allowing increases
in [shipping, traffic and industrial development]{.mark} in Siberia.
[Huge mining operations]{.mark} are being planned, and [are going to
drive vast holes into the deep permafrost]{.mark} to extract oil and
ores. "Those operations [will release vast amounts of pathogens that
still thrive there. Miners will walk in and breath the viruses. The
effects could be calamitous."]{.mark}**]{.underline} This point was
stressed by Koopmans. "[If you look at the **history of
[epidemic]{.mark} outbreaks, one of the [key drivers has been change in
land use. Nipah virus]{.mark}**]{.underline} was spread by fruit bats
who were driven from their habitats by humans. Similarly,
**[[monkeypox]{.mark} has been [linked to the spread of
urbanisation]{.mark} in Africa]{.underline}**. And that is what [we are
about to witness **[in the Arctic: a complete change in land
use]{.mark}, and that could be [dangerous, as we have seen]{.mark}
elsewhere**." Scientists believe that **[permafrost]{.mark} -- at its
deepest levels -- may [contain viruses]{.mark} that are [up to a million
years old]{.mark}** and so will be far older than our own species, which
is thought to have emerged about 300,000 years ago. "**[Our immune
systems]{.mark} may [have never been in contact with]{.mark} some of
[those microbes, and that is another worry,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} said
Claverie. "The scenario of an unknown virus once infecting a Neanderthal
coming back at us, although unlikely, has become a real possibility."
For that reason, Claverie and others are working with UArctic, the
University of the Arctic -- an international educational network in the
polar region -- on plans to establish quarantine facilities and provide
medical expertise that could pinpoint early cases and treat them locally
to try to contain the infection. "**[[We now face a tangible threat and
we need to be prepared to deal with it. It is as simple as
that."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

time frame, and what the relative emissions of carbon dioxide and
methane will be is [**[key for understanding the impact on global
climate]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In addition, the response of vegetation
in a warming climate has the potential to offset at least some of the
accelerating feedback to the climate from permafrost carbon.
Temperature, organic carbon, and ground ice are key regulators for

Permafrost is the thermal state of subsurface ground. This means that,

observation through satellite remote sensing at local to global scales.
Instead, **[[detecting permafrost change requires]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The Arctic is experiencing some of the most rapid climate change on
Earth. Temperatures in this region are rising at roughly three times the
global average. [Key signs of this change **include rising temperatures,
ecosystem disruptions**, and [permafrost thawing]{.mark}, which
[impact]{.mark}s [both wildlife and biod]{.mark}iversity. Therefore,
enhanced resilience and [in-depth Arctic research are crucial]{.mark}
for understanding both local and global implications of climate
change]{.underline}. This is important for the region and the planet. It
informs global policies and adaptation strategies, making it a
cornerstone of climate science. [With [Arctic research]{.mark}, we
[can]{.mark} **[monitor]{.mark}** the rising of [sea levels]{.mark}, the
health of [ecosystems]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **[predict]{.mark}**
[future]{.mark} [climate]{.mark} [scenarios]{.mark}. This special focus
publication deep dives into the Arctic's role in global climate change,
highlighting how research is being enhanced and how it can continually
be improved. The current state of the Arctic and its role in global
climate change]{.underline} The first article in the eBook explores the
current state of the Arctic and how trends have changed over recent
years. The Arctic, often referred to as the Earth's 'canary in the coal
mine' for climate change, is experiencing dramatic transformations as
global warming intensifies. These rapid changes are driving significant
environmental shifts, from declining sea ice to thawing permafrost, with
far-reaching consequences for the planet. The Arctic's dramatic changes
are a stark reminder of the urgency of addressing climate change. As sea
ice retreats, permafrost thaws, and ecosystems shift, the need for
global collaboration and immediate action becomes increasingly clear.
The importance of scientific and Indigenous collaboration [Elsewhere in
the eBook, ArcticNet details how it is working to **advance** [Arctic
research]{.mark}, **[strengthen]{.mark}** [relationships with Indigenous
communities]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} cultivate the next generation of
Arctic expertise. The integration of different disciplines and knowledge
systems is critical for [address]{.mark}ing these [complex issues
comprehensively]{.mark}]{.underline}. Focusing on just one aspect can
miss key pieces of the puzzle. Indigenous perspectives have always taken
a holistic approach to ecosystems, examining the interconnectedness of
elements within them. Science has traditionally been siloed by
discipline, but ArcticNet embraces the idea that multiple disciplines
are needed to fully address these complex systems, particularly in
Arctic research. Achieving a perfect partnership and integration of
these knowledge systems would help policymakers better understand the
changes happening in the Arctic. Can current mitigation measures be
improved? The final article highlights some of the current policies
already attempting to mitigate Arctic climate change and if improvements
need to be made. Worldwide policies and initiatives to combat Arctic
climate change include: The EU Climate policy, which aims to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy sources in the
Arctic. Arctic Council Strategic Plan, which promotes conservation and
sustainable use of the Arctic marine environment. WWF Arctic, which
advocates for Arctic states to establish Arctic Marine Protected Areas
(MPAs) and Other Effective Area-Based Conservation Measures (OECMs).
[Despite these measures, there is still a long way to go in combating
Arctic climate change. [To combat Arctic warming]{.mark}, [we
need]{.mark} an integrated, global approach to [policy that includes
**both** mitigation and adaptation strategies]{.mark}. Strengthening
international agreements, transitioning [to]{.mark} renewable energy,
[protect]{.mark}ing Arctic [ecosystems, support]{.mark}ing [Indigenous
communities]{.mark}, and addressing]{.underline}

#### Data's key.

There is a lot of research happening about climate change in the Arctic.
[[More research is needed to]{.mark} document changes and fill data gaps
on causes and impacts of change. This information can help [set local
and international priorities for mitigation and
adaptation]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Arctic ecosystems are changing
quickly. Because these changes are happening so fast, [it's important to
document the conditions of Arctic ecosystems to track]{.mark} [what is
changing and]{.mark} what is [being lost]{.mark}. Some areas of the
Arctic that are more vulnerable to change, like the remaining perennial
[sea-ice]{.mark} [cover]{.mark}, [ice shelves]{.mark}, epishelf
[lakes]{.mark} (a body of freshwater that floats on denser ocean water),
[and]{.mark} the [Greenland]{.mark} Ice Sheet, [are priorities for
documentation]{.mark}.2 So far, Arctic research has often focused on
rising temperatures, shrinking sea ice, and increasing
wildfires.]{.underline} The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
identifies key knowledge gaps in the Arctic due to limited observations
on polar biodiversity, precipitation, soil quality, and glacier and ice
sheet loss. [[Documenting]{.mark} these elements, among others, [can
help develop current and future priorities for research, mitigation, and
adaptation]{.mark}. There is also a need to [study the social, economic,
and cultural impacts of changes]{.mark} in the Arctic. The U.S. Fifth
National Climate Assessment highlights that changing environmental
resources [can create unequal access to services]{.mark}.3
[Assessments]{.mark} of rapidly changing areas [benefit from]{.mark}
[comparing]{.mark} them to areas that are less vulnerable [to]{.mark}
change.]{.underline} [This helps [show the scope]{.mark} of
environmental changes [and]{.mark} better inform [ecosystem]{.mark} and
[resource management models]{.mark}.4 The assistance of Arctic and
international science institutions and governments is crucial in
addressing these data gaps. [Tools like satellites, autonomous vehicles,
and community-based monitoring can help gather data from remote
areas.]{.mark} There is also a need [to develop and maintain]{.mark}
pan-Arctic climate [indicators that reflect improvements in data sharing
and availability]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Arctic Council and
International Arctic Science Committee emphasize the importance of
co-producing future research and indicators, particularly with
Indigenous Knowledge holders. [[Better data]{.mark} about Arctic
ecosystems [will help residents, researchers, and policymakers at all
levels]{.mark}.5 The Local Environmental Observer (LEO) Network,
established by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium's Center for
Climate and Health in 2012, allows Alaskan community members to share
animal, environmental, and weather events.]{.underline} The Local
Environmental Observer Network has since become a model program under
the United States' Chairmanship of the Arctic Council, working in
collaboration with Alaskan Native tribes, universities, and national
government agencies like the EPA, National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM).
Local collaboration efforts are also led by the University of Alaska
Fairbanks, whose programs, such as the Alaska Climate Adaptation Science
Center, Alaska Sea Grant, and Alaska Fire Science Consortium, foster
partnerships to produce climate research, toolkits, and outreach
materials.

4 Discussion One of [the key directions]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
state policy [in ensuring the economic development of the region can be
[the sustainable use of]{.mark}]{.underline} Arctic resources, such as
oil, gas, fisheries and other [[natural resources]{.mark},]{.underline}
[taking into account]{.underline} [their conservation]{.underline} and
respect for the environment. To do this[, it [is necessary to conduct a
comprehensive environmental impact assessment and develop
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[that will allow the
use]{.underline}]{.mark} of resources while [[minimizing their negative
impact]{.underline}]{.mark} on nature. [[Sustainable
use]{.underline}]{.mark} of resources [[is achieved through]{.mark} the
use of]{.underline} latest technologies and techniques such as [green
tech]{.underline}nology [and]{.underline} more [efficient use of
resources]{.underline}, etc. The implementation of a strategy for the
[[sustainable use of resources]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic zone
[can be solved by involving partner countries]{.underline} in Arctic
integration projects on a mutually beneficial basis. For example,
public-private partnerships, as well as the use of offset contracts
([contracts]{.underline} in which the purchasing government of the
importing country obliges the supplier from the exporting country to
reinvest some part of the contract amount in the importing country)
\[8\] [will make it possible to attract the necessary investments for
the development of the Arctic zone and manage the risks of climate
change.]{.underline} The [next tool to mitigate climate
change]{.underline} in the Arctic is to take action to [[reduce
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} of greenhouse gases such as carbon
dioxide and methane. [This [can be achieved by increasing the share of
renewable energy sources,]{.mark} such as solar energy]{.underline},
wind energy, as well as [by increasing energy efficiency in the most
energy-intensive sectors of the Russian economy. [It
is]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}also [[necessary
to]{.mark}]{.underline} carry out work to [[adapt to climate
change]{.mark}, [such as building protective structures and changing
business practices.]{.mark}]{.underline} One of the factors stimulating
the implementation of ESG practices (environmental and social
responsibility of enterprises) in Arctic industrial enterprises is
government support, which includes preferences for social and
environmental projects, support and preferential financing of projects
involving the creation of closed production cycles, as well as expansion
of areas application of public-private partnership \[3\]. [[An important
aspect is]{.mark}]{.underline} also the creation and [[development of
infrastructure in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} zone, including roads,
ports, airports, telecommunications, etc., in order to ensure the safety
and efficiency of transport and communication flows, as well as the
rational use of natural resources. Finally[[, it is advisable to
continue research and monitoring of climate change in the Arctic]{.mark}
in order [to correctly assess risks]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [take]{.mark}
effective [measures]{.mark} to adapt to climate change.]{.underline}
This can be achieved through strengthening scientific research in
various fields such as hydrology, geology, biology and meteorology
\[7\]. The identified problems, as well as proposed solutions, are
summarized in Table 1. In general, we can conclude that ensuring the
economic development of the Arctic zone and leveling the negative
consequences of climate change are two complex but interrelated tasks.
It is important to note that if the development of the region is
possible through the implementation of targeted economic policies, then
mitigating the effects of climate change requires targeted efforts on
the part of states, scientific communities and the public as a whole.
The result of the activity may be the creation of special funds and
support programs for the development of the Arctic economy, the
establishment of international agreements and standards for the
protection of nature and ecological systems, as well as active work to
attract investments and technologies to achieve these goals \[10\]. The
Russian Federation is interested in attracting partner countries to
implement joint large-scale projects for the industrial development of
the Arctic territories. 3 E3S Web of Conferences 498, 02001 (2024)

addition[, [it is necessary to take into account the views and interests
of indigenous peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} who live in the Arctic and
depend on its environmental sustainability. [The Russian Arctic is home
to 82.5 thousand]{.underline} representatives of indigenous peoples
(Nenets, Chukchi, Khanty, Evens, Evenks, Selkups, Sami, Eskimos,
Dolgans, Chuvans, Kets, Nganasans, Yukagirs, Enets, Mansi, Vepsians,
Koryaks, Itelmens, kereks). Some of them lead a nomadic or semi-nomadic
lifestyle associated with traditional types of environmental management,
primarily reindeer herding, fishing, marine hunting, and hunting.
Including Indigenous peoples in decision-making can help create fairer
and more effective solutions for everyone involved. Finally, mitigating
climate change in the Arctic also requires global efforts to combat
climate change more generally. 5 Conclusion Mitigating the negative
impacts of climate change in the Arctic and ensuring its economic
development are complex and complex tasks that can be achieved through
the implementation of public policies and cooperation between the public
and the scientific community. Realization of the [[economic potential of
the Arctic]{.mark} zone [is possible]{.mark} only [if]{.mark} policies
aimed at [managing climate risks are implemented.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Thus, leveling out the negative manifestations of climate change in the
Arctic can be ensured by taking measures to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions, including by increasing the share of renewable energy
sources, using technologies in construction that are resistant to
dynamic changes in soils, improving the thermal insulation of building
foundations, and introducing ESG principles at Arctic industrial
enterprises. Another promising tool for managing environmental risks is
to take advantage of international cooperation. For example, the
development of mechanisms for the use of offset contracts can be
successfully implemented in the Arctic regions of the Russian Federation
to achieve the goals of socio-economic development of the territory,
which is 4 E3S Web of Conferences 498, 02001 (2024)
https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202449802001 ICAPE2024 especially
important in the current conditions, when problems in the Arctic region
cannot be solved only with the support of the state. Developing the
terms of offset contracts beneficial for both parties to the transaction
will make it possible to implement nationally significant projects in
such areas as tourism, transport, shipbuilding, industrial production,
logistics and real estate. The implementation of state policy in the
field of environmental management will mitigate the negative impact of
climate change. For example[, [organic farming and agroforestry]{.mark},
that is, the use of agricultural crops to improve the soil and
ecological condition of the land[, will help manage climate
risks]{.mark}, on the one hand, [and ensure food security]{.mark} in the
region,]{.underline} on the other.

Coordinated synergies among nations and research projects While
challenges in monitoring climate change in polar regions are
significant, they are not insurmountable. [The [key to effective
monitoring and mitigation]{.underline}]{.mark} [in these sensitive
regions [lies in coordinated funding streams and synergies among
nations]{.mark} and research projects]{.underline} in order to maximize
the use of resources in challenging environmental settings \[91[[\]. By
building on existing initiatives, fostering international collaboration,
and ensuring long-term financing]{.mark}, [we]{.mark} can bridge the
[gaps between scientific monitoring]{.mark} [and the
implementation]{.mark} of effective climate]{.underline} informed
strategies. Sustained commitment to existing international monitoring
networks leverages successful frameworks to increase international
partnerships, [[facilitate longer-term monitoring, and foster enduring
research relationships]{.mark}]{.underline} \[92--95\]. [[This approach
is true for]{.mark} high-level organizations such as [the Arctic
Council's working groups]{.mark} and the ATS]{.underline}, which have
laid the groundwork for international collaboration, as well as specific
international, multidisciplinary research programs such as the DBO and
the Marine Ecosystem Assessment for the Southern Ocean (MEASO) \[96\].
Another example is the Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS;
https://www.soos.aq) which was established by SCAR and the Scientific
Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR; https://scor-int.org) to improve
data management and sharing systems to reduce uncertainties in estimates
of the future state of the Southern Ocean \[36\]. [[SOOS has
made]{.mark} considerable [progress]{.mark} toward [designing a
comprehensive observing system]{.mark} though there is room for
improvement]{.underline} regarding the accessibility and integration of
data from various sources. Regarding coordinated science efforts in
Antarctica, SCAR focuses on high priority topical areas through its
scientific research programs. Among the three ongoing flagship programs,
AntClimNow and INSTANT address climate change in the Antarctic region,
while Ant-ICON guides international conservation and management policies
for Antarctica and the Southern Ocean. Another notable initiative
stemming from SCAR is the Antarctic RINGS Action Group
(https://scar.org/science/rings), an internationally coordinated
Pan-Antarctic aero-geophysical exploration along the entire Antarctic
coastal zone. The goal of RINGS is to assess the influence of bed
properties on ice sheet coastal processes to quantify regional Antarctic
ice sheet responses to future ocean and climate warming. [Effective data
[sharing forms the cornerstone of these synergies]{.mark}, ensuring that
monitoring efforts are both comprehensive and actionable]{.underline}.
Employing international standards for data formatting and metadata could
improve interoperability of current databases including those listed in
Table 1. Data sharing mechanisms should be leveraged to expand the
versatility of existing data for integration within a centralized form.
[[This includes ensuring data can be easily accessed and offered]{.mark}
alongside associated products [in accordance with]{.mark} the
[FAIR]{.mark}]{.underline} (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and
Reusable) principles that are tailored to the needs of stakeholders
\[97\]. [[Adopting international standards for data]{.mark} management
and exchange [will be key]{.mark}]{.underline} in this process, which
would require optimizing existing infrastructure and resources including
data access tools and tutorials. Costs of data access, especially to
publicly funded data, should be free to users always. These steps would
maximize the utility of satellites, research stations, and digital
platforms for near or real-time data analysis and effective, responsive
decision-making. Involvement of Indigenous communities in polar research
[Through proper [engagement with]{.mark} and recognition [of Indigenous
knowledge and academic science as equal but distinct systems]{.mark}, we
can address several limitations of western science]{.underline},
including the lack of baseline data and long-term observations \[98\],
and access to knowledge holders via protocols that assign credit and
benefits to Indigenous participants \[18\]. However, [facilitation is
needed for respectful, ethical, and productive interactions between
non-local scientists and local knowledge holders]{.underline}. Expanding
access for diverse scientists and Indigenous knowledge holders requires
formal and open collaborative networks. [[Data collection,
administration, and sharing methods are also needed for community
monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark} \[99\]. This integrated approach
significantly enhances our ability to understand and manage local
environmental phenomena, such as the development of protected areas
\[100\], contributing to conservation and sustainability efforts.
Additionally, it fosters a more comprehensive and contextual social
understanding. An understanding that actively confronts the ongoing
challenges of colonialism and neocolonialism in polar scientific
research \[14\] and practices that break trust in local communities such
as helicopter science \[15[\]. [Adaptation of more conscientious
scientific practices sets the groundwork for a more equitable]{.mark}
and inclusive [scientific community]{.mark}]{.underline} \[101\]. The
[[inclusion of Indigenous]{.mark} communities' [knowledge]{.mark} [in
polar research provides]{.mark} significant [benefits]{.mark} on a
variety of scales]{.underline}, ranging from local community-driven
priorities like human and ecosystem health and sustainable development
to global concerns such as climate change, and wildlife populations.
Indigenous and local knowledge serves as an important link enhancing
scientific understanding with life experience and adaptations to
changing environments \[102, 103\]. However, successfully integrating
this knowledge into polar research presents several challenges,
including reconciling methodological differences, ensuring cultural
sensitivity and informed consent, and maintaining long-term and mutually
beneficial partnerships. A respectful and ethical approach, including
explicit agreements and suitable incentives for long-term collaboration,
especially given the intergenerational nature of Indigenous knowledge is
imperative in this context. Furthermore, successful incorporation of
Indigenous viewpoints requires adherence to knowledge co-production
norms. This includes aligning scientific goals with the capacities of
Indigenous knowledge systems, guaranteeing compatibility in observation
methodology and data management, and cultivating a respectful
relationship that recognizes and honors Indigenous populations'
contributions \[18\]. Addressing these challenges not only increases the
impact of local observations on broader scientific priorities, but also
paves the way for more comprehensive scientific practices that are
gaining momentum within broader society \[101\]. There have been
increasing attempts in polar regions to combine scientific inquiry with
traditional wisdom. For example, First Nations populations in Canada
\[104\] have long emphasized the need for climate change adaptation
strategies that are sensitive to their unique circumstances, drawing
from their extensive experience living in the Arctic for thousands of
years and their deep understanding of sea ice practices and wildlife
patterns \[105\]. The substantial inclusion of knowledge holders across
the Arctic necessitates significant coordination and effort but is
crucial for continuous, comprehensive monitoring across seasons. In
particular, the Inuit (distributed throughout Alaska, Canada, and
Greenland), the Sámi (in northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia),
the Athabaskans (in Alaska and Canada), the Aleut (in Alaska and
Russia), and the Yupiit (in Alaska and Russia) are the historical
occupants in many Arctic locations \[106\]. A collaborative approach is
vital to anticipate human and ecosystem responses to emerging
challenges, like increased ship traffic and the northward movement of
subarctic species \[107\]. [Organizations like [the Arctic
Council]{.mark}, which includes Indigenous permanent participants, [have
played a role in such collaborations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although the
extent and effectiveness of these collaborations can vary, several
Arctic nations have implemented community-based monitoring programs
involving Indigenous knowledge holders, especially in areas like
wildlife tracking and climate change observations. For example, the
Alaska Arctic Observatory and Knowledge Hub (AAOKH;
https://arctic-aok.org) is a network of Iñupiaq observers from northern
Alaska coastal communities that work with researchers at the University
of Alaska, Fairbanks. [[The AAOKH is an integrated observatory with
goals to monitor environmental change, highlight Indigenous-led
observations of the environment]{.underline}]{.mark} and their meaning,
promote scientific and Indigenous knowledge exchange, and support
community-led initiatives addressing changes in the cryosphere,
wildlife, and other environmental aspects along the northern coast of
Alaska \[108\]. Observations on local sea ice conditions are accessible
to the greater scientific community through a database. Further, the
data policy requires citation of individual observers of the data used
in knowledge production. This arrangement provides local observations
available to scientists indirectly, limiting the need for individual
scientists to attempt relationship building with local knowledge holders
who may be constrained in terms of time and interest. In the Antarctic,
the ATS encourages scientific collaboration among nations. While there
are no Indigenous populations in Antarctica, there is a growing
recognition of the value of diverse perspectives, including those of
Indigenous researchers from countries involved in Antarctic research.
SCAR and other organizations work towards effective data management and
sharing, although these efforts are currently more focused on
international scientific collaboration rather than integrating local or
Indigenous knowledge. The relevance of Indigenous knowledge in shaping
an inclusive polar future and understanding the past remains
significant. Notably, the Māori people of New Zealand/Aotearoa, who are
likely the first humans to have encountered Antarctic waters and
possibly the continent \[109\], may provide perspectives on local
environmental changes and adaptation techniques. This is especially
pertinent in the context of the New Zealand Antarctic Programme \[110,
111\], which could incorporate Māori perspectives more fully and set a
standard for cultural inclusion among the 56 treaty party nations under
the ATS \[112\]. Steps towards bridging science to action To address the
complex challenges of polar research on a broader scale and achieve a
more comprehensive understanding of polar systems, a strategic and
collaborative approach is essential. To this end, we propose six actions
that can be conducted in parallel and have deliberate overlaps to
emphasize their connectivity. The initial step in advancing polar
research is to identify and use global forums to enhance monitoring
efforts and establish clear goals. This approach, vital for overcoming
the limitations of separate national programs, aims for a comprehensive
understanding of polar dynamics. Coordinated collaboration among nations
and research initiatives is crucial for efficiently using resources like
polar stations and logistics personnel (Table 2). This strategy is key
for gathering important polar observations and surpassing the
constraints of small-scale national studies, while also ensuring
effective information sharing among scientists, policymakers, and local
populations, including Indigenous communities. The [[second step
involves advancements that]{.mark} can make [data more
accessible]{.mark} and actionable for the public]{.underline}, and
improve the sense of involvement in polar science, [thereby increasing
awareness and support for climate change mitigation in polar
regions]{.underline}. It implies more than just token inclusion of
Indigenous communities; it requires their active participation in
scientific research and policymaking. Integrating their ecological
knowledge enhances our understanding of polar ecosystems. Additionally,
engaging the broader public and involving diverse skill sets could
further assist in ecosystem management and protection through the
adaptation of technologies like unmanned aerial vehicles, artificial
intelligence, and citizen science platforms. The third step is to secure
long-term funding and establish sustained monitoring cycles, which are
essential for effective scientific action and developing solutions for
studying and protecting the polar regions. [[Analyzing]{.mark} both
successful and less successful [international initiatives can guide the
creation of general guidelines]{.mark}.]{.underline} Crucially, there is
a need for ongoing, long-term financial support from various countries
to build a foundation for tackling the complex challenges of climate
change in polar regions. Potential funding sources could include
governmental funds, business sector partnerships, and international
collaborations. [[Addressing the]{.mark} multifaceted [impacts of
climate change requires trans-disciplinary funding]{.mark} across areas
like climatology, ecology, and social sciences]{.underline}. Funding
proposals should also consider the logistical and mental health needs of
scientists, particularly early career researchers \[113\]. [[We need to
build bridges between the disciplines that study climate, the
cryosphere, oceanography, ecology, economics, social, and political
sciences]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although agendas of potential funders,
like resource prospecting, can hinder scientific cooperation, it is
essential that we leverage these challenges to foster collaboration
across as many areas as possible. The fourth stage is developing
existing technologies or testing new ones that will enable us to explore
polar environments in depth, comprehensively and securely. These
technologies include remote sensing and modern survey tools (satellites,
unmanned aerial vehicles, sonars, radars, autonomous submersible
vehicles, miniaturized sensors), molecular tools (environmental DNA
(eDNA), multi-omics, bioinformatics, molecular barcoding), and IT tools
(large databases, participatory science, coupled models, artificial
intelligence) that can be applied to a range of applications. For
example, [questions on how life evolved and adapted to cold environments
with extreme seasonality can be better achieved using multi-omics and
eDNA analyses]{.underline} \[114\]. Additionally, new methods based on
satellite tracking and monitoring of disturbances such as from
pollutants \[115\] can provide clearer links between human actions and
the marine environment \[116\]. Decision making structures need to
remain flexible to swiftly adjust responses to the various consequences
of climate change in polar regions. There is a current initiative to
develop a pan-arctic ocean observing alliance that would be recognized
as a formal part of the Global Ocean Observing System
(https://goosocean.org). The objective is to develop formal coordination
mechanisms that will improve data-gathering and observational
infrastructure \[117\]. The proposed framework differs from individual
researcher-led programs previously mentioned in seeking to establish an
internationally accepted governance structure with recognized authority
centered on high-level policy objectives \[117\]. Planning coordinated
research efforts that maximize societal benefit is desirable but
alternate paths that result from independent, entrepreneurial effort
should also be encouraged. For example, implementing novel technology or
responding to natural events or new discoveries may lag if hierarchical
structures are too rigid. Similarly, Antarctic programs such as SCAR's
scientific research and the ATS' environmental protections demonstrate
concentrated efforts to assess and anticipate climate ramifications.
Regularly developing and publishing research priorities, building
effective communication to better align research efforts, and securing
sustained funding for collaborative initiatives will continue to be
essential activities. The expected symmetry of the polar regions is
limited by highly contrasting geographical components as the Arctic is a
sea surrounded by land while the Antarctic is a continent surrounded by
sea, with different climatic, ecological, and geopolitical constraints.
Each region faces distinct risks though issues common among the polar
regions are evident. Adopting effective frameworks (such as IPY and
\"Hope Spots\") and aligning tactics with the Ocean Decade's vision
serve as guiding principles for future research endeavors. Greater
efforts in science communication are needed to bridge the interests of
polar regions with the greater public. Dissemination on the importance
of polar and subpolar ecosystems is essential, as well as the ongoing
threats they face such as increased ship traffic and environmental
changes. Polar tourism, for example, is both an opportunity and a threat
for scientific research and environmental preservation \[26, 118, 119\].
Lamers et al. \[120\] recently concluded that linking science and
tourism generally had positive effects on visitor experience and the
conduct of polar science projects, but also presented complex
challenges, including a risk of greenwashing if the combination of
science and tourism was not done with care. The development of citizen
science in the polar regions (e.g., during touristic cruises) may enable
broadened data collection but the risks associated with increased
pressure on ecosystems need to be considered \[121\]. Therefore, ongoing
discussion of human impact on the environment in terms of tourism,
fisheries, and global shipping is needed to promote behavioral changes
of consumers as well as apply pressure to governments and businesses to
refine policies and practices. Perspectives on Arctic and Antarctic
"exceptionalism\" are changing because of Russia's offense on Ukraine as
well as warming temperatures increasing access to these regions \[122,
123\]. These events may cast doubt on the Antarctic and Southern Ocean's
exclusivity and raise questions about the ATS's capacity for adaptation.
In contrast, 'Arctic exceptionalism' is characterized by the region's
long-term habitation by Indigenous peoples and sovereignty claims by
Arctic states. Governance is managed through national laws and the
cooperative framework of the Arctic Council. Increasingly, there is
pressure on the Arctic Council to collaborate with relevant partners to
effectively address climate change. Both regions face similar human
challenges such as disagreements over resource extraction, environmental
preservation, and territorial claims \[124\]. Examples include Russia's
territorial claims in East Antarctica and China's interest in Antarctic
krill fisheries \[125\], as well as disputes over oil and gas
exploration rights in the Arctic exemplified by tensions between Russia
and Norway in the Barents Sea \[126\]. International science
collaboration has become more complex given these geopolitical contexts,
yet cooperation is increasingly essential in light of ongoing climate
change. [Multilateral efforts will therefore be required to close the
gap between the needs of relevant scientific understanding and policy
action for the polar regions. [Necessary steps include]{.mark} funding
polar research, [incorporating scientific findings into
decision-making]{.mark} at all levels, and [encouraging diverse
stakeholders to work together]{.mark} to solve complex problems and
ensure good governance, [environmental protection, and

[[Thawing permafrost]{.mark} Permafrost, the frozen soil that underpins
much of the Arctic landscape, is thawing rapidly as temperatures rise.
This process [releases methane and carbon dioxide]{.mark} -- potent
greenhouse gases -- [into]{.mark} the [atmosphere]{.mark},
**[amplifying]{.mark}** global [warming]{.mark}.]{.underline} Subsea
permafrost, which covers vast areas of the Arctic Ocean floor, is
particularly concerning. As warmer ocean currents erode this frozen
layer, methane previously trapped for millennia is released,
contributing to a feedback loop of accelerated warming. [[Quantifying
these emissions]{.mark} is challenging, but their [potential]{.mark} [to
significantly influence climate systems is undeniable]{.mark}.
[Scientists]{.mark} warn that permafrost carbon release could rival or
exceed current annual emissions from fossil fuel use,
**[underscor]{.mark}ing** [the need for **urgent** monitoring and
mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The role of clouds and aerosols Recent
studies have highlighted the complex role of clouds and aerosols in the
Arctic's climate dynamics. Thin, low-lying clouds can either reflect
sunlight, cooling the surface, or trap heat, exacerbating ice melt.
Aerosols, including dust, smoke, and marine particles, further
complicate this dynamic by altering cloud properties and behavior. [The

Why is a multidisciplinary approach important for addressing Arctic
research? [Complex questions require interconnected solutions. The
[effects of climate change in]{.mark} [the Arctic are **often cascading
and compounding**]{.mark}. The integration of different disciplines and
knowledge systems is critical for addressing these priorities in a
comprehensive way. If you focus on just one aspect, you can **miss** key
pieces of the puzzle. A [multidisciplinary approach **offers a holistic
perspective**]{.mark}, observing the system as a whole, **rather than
just one issue**. [Indigenous perspectives]{.mark} have always had this
holistic approach to ecosystems, [look]{.mark}ing [at]{.mark} the
[interconnectedness of elements within them]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Science has traditionally been siloed by discipline, but now we're
embracing the idea that [[multiple disciplines are **needed** to fully
address these complex systems, particularly in Arctic
research]{.underline}]{.mark}. ArcticNet funds projects that involve
many thematic areas, one of which is the marine system. Over the last
twenty years, one project has dedicated years to studying how climate
change impacts ecosystem function and biodiversity in Arctic waters.
However, some questions require a collaborative approach beyond the
expertise of marine biology. During the ArcticKelp project, a team
utilized both modelling and fieldwork to suggest that retreating ice
cover allows more sunlight to penetrate Arctic waters, enhancing the
growth of macroalgae, such as kelp. These kelps offer numerous benefits,
from carbon sequestration to serving as a traditional food and potential
income source for local communities. [However, directly measuring and
mapping the diversity of kelp along the remote and changing Canadian
Arctic coast posed a significant challenge. To address this, [the
team]{.mark} [needed to develop]{.mark} [new]{.mark} [sensor
technology]{.mark} capable of operating in the icy depths of the Arctic
Ocean [and]{.mark} to [incorporate local knowledge from Northern
communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. This endeavour required the
integration of various disciplines and expertise, including engineers,
marine biologists, and members of Indigenous communities. [By combining
these diverse fields and knowledge bases, the [interdisciplinary team
successfully developed]{.mark} a [sensor]{.mark} using fluorescent LIDAR
(light detection and ranging) [technology]{.mark}. This sensor can
identify, quantify, and characterize kelp species in the Arctic region.
Additionally, [leveraging local knowledge enabled them to cover more
ground in the Arctic **through collaboration with Northern
communities**]{.mark}**.** This [interdisciplinary approach
provides]{.mark} **[valuable insights]{.mark}** into the ecology of
ocean-floor kelp forests and the marine life that depends on
them.]{.underline}

[Arctic temperature trends [Arctic temperatures have risen
significantl]{.mark}y over the past decades, with the [region now
warming at more than **double the rate of the rest of the
world**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2023, the Arctic recorded its warmest
summer to date, with average temperatures surpassing the 1991--2020
baseline by over 4°C in some areas.2 The year 2023 also marked a
troubling milestone, with annual Arctic temperatures increasing by an
average of 0.25°C per decade since 1940. [This [rapid warming]{.mark} is
not just a statistical anomaly -- it is [driven by feedback loops unique
to the Arctic]{.mark}. One critical factor is the albedo
effect.]{.underline} Albedo refers to the measure of a surface's
reflectivity. [[Snow and ice]{.mark}, which dominate the Arctic
landscape, have high albedo values and [reflect a significant portion of
solar radiation back into space]{.mark}. However, [as temperatures rise
and ice and snow melt]{.mark}]{.underline}, darker surfaces such as open
ocean and exposed land are revealed. [These [surfaces **absorb** more

warming]{.mark} -- a self-reinforcing cycle]{.underline}.3 [This
[feedback mechanism]{.mark} is one of the [main driver]{.mark}s of
Arctic amplification, [where]{.mark} the [region warms at a rate up to

[loss of sea ice]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly in summer months, is

[What are some of the [main scientific priorities for Arctic
research]{.mark} today? In my opinion, **it's [certainly]{.mark}
[climate change]{.mark}** with its allencompassing and far-reaching
impacts. The [Arctic]{.mark} is [warming four times faster than southern
regions of the planet]{.mark}, so it acts as a sentinel for
change]{.underline}. What happens in the Arctic will likely happen years
later in more southern latitudes. [The **[impacts are far-reaching,
including changing landscapes, infrastructure, sea ice levels, and sea
ice duration]{.mark}**. For instance, the time that the Arctic Ocean is
covered [with ice is decreasing]{.mark}. We also [see changes in
wildlife]{.mark} migration, species distribution, and [zoonoses]{.mark},
which are diseases carried by wildlife.]{.underline} These [**[changes
impact ecosystems and communities that depend on wildlife]{.mark}**.
Everything in the North affects northern communities, whether it's their
ability to travel on sea ice for **subsistence hunting or accessing
hunting and gathering zones. [Climate change has huge impacts on
landscapes, ecosystems, and geosystems]{.mark}**]{.underline}**. [One
example is [thawing permafrost]{.mark}, which [impacts natural
landscapes]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} Permafrost is ground
that has been frozen for several years, and when it starts to thaw, the
landscape changes. This [can [lead to drainage, the creation of
wetlands, or infrastructure challenges for anything built on
permafrost]{.mark}. These [landscape changes]{.mark} affect [both
natural and built environments, impacting ecosystems and people living
on permafrost]{.mark}. This is a major issue that spans engineering
innovations and community livelihoods.]{.underline} Sea ice dynamics are
also changing, making sea ice pathways and the weather less predictable,
which affects ship navigation and community safety on the ice.
[Terrestrial and marine [species]{.mark} could also have their
[distribution]{.mark} [modified due to climate change]{.mark}, bringing
new realities to Northern communities. Another **[critical issue is
green energy sources for remote communities]{.mark}---how to provide
sustainable energy in harsh climates with low maintenance
requirements.**]{.underline} Most of the Canadian North relies on
biannual deliveries of fuel, [which is unsustainable for both the
environment and the communities. Addressing this disparity in services

[city's infrastructure due to permafrost thaw]{.mark}. UVA [researchers
have been working closely with]{.mark} community [residents]{.mark} [to
discover ways Arctic communities can thrive]{.mark} despite changes to

jutting into the Arctic Ocean. The [majority of residents are Iñupiat
and climate change threatens the]{.mark} very [ground they walk
on]{.mark}. A [team]{.mark} [from UVA has been in the region researching
innovative solutions for years]{.mark}.]{.underline} Seed funded by
UVA's Environmental Institute and the UVA Center for Global Inquiry &
Innovation, in 2021 the Arctic Cities project received a five-year, \$3
million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF). The team
recently won the 2023 Research Collaboration Award from the UVA Office
of the Vice President for Research [The [multidisciplinary team]{.mark},
including Howard Epstein from the College and Graduate School of Arts &
Sciences' Department of Environmental Sciences, Leena Cho and Matthew
Jull from the School of Architecture, and Caitlin Donahue Wylie from the
School of Engineering and Applied Science, [work alongside residents to
find solutions to the challenges the community
faces]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Environmental problems require
interdisciplinary understanding of both approaches and solutions along
with insights from the people who experience these problems in their
daily life," said Epstein, the project's lead. "It's important to get
multiple viewpoints[. The [cutting edge of science is interdisciplinary
and community-engaged]{.mark}." "But it's [not just about working with
scientific data and the design of infrastructure]{.mark},]{.underline} "
said Leena Cho, associate professor in landscape architecture,
Co-Director of the Arctic Design Group, and long-time member of the
Arctic Cities project. ["It's [also about how you can incorporate the
spirit of the community right into the design]{.mark}."]{.underline}
Epstein is a vegetation ecologist who started his Arctic research career
at the Institute for Arctic and Alpine Research. He has worked in remote
environments, including the northern Canadian Archipelago and
northwestern Siberia, for 27 years. Epstein came to UVA 25 years ago and
is now a leading expert on Arctic landscapes. While Epstein studies
patterns and changes in vegetation, particularly how vegetation sits at
the center of an ecosystem and affects everything from carbon cycling,
exchange of energy between land and atmosphere, water flows and more, he
is also increasingly interested in data about ground temperatures. [He
coordinates the team which monitors temperatures at nearly a hundred
stations in the area to track changes and assess trends. "It\'s not just
that the city is warmer than the surrounding tundra," Epstein explained.
"There are spots that are warmer and spots that are cooler. That makes a
big difference for the ability to build, the stability of permafrost,
and building vulnerability."]{.underline} [This is where a [diverse team
is crucial]{.mark} to UVA's approach.]{.underline} "Through our Arctic
Cities project, we are working with engineers, architects, social
scientists, and communities. It is the co-production of knowledge that
is important," Epstein emphasizeUtqiaġvik sits on ice-rich permafrost,
ground made of frozen water, soil, rock, and organic material. The top
few feet regularly thaw and refreeze every year. Due to rising average
temperatures, this layer is becoming deeper than ever. [As a result,
[buildings constructed on the permafrost are unstable and]{.mark},
ultimately, [dangerous]{.mark}.]{.underline} But the Arctic Cities team
is also addressing the winter warming effect of snow. As the Earth's
temperatures rise, more water evaporates into the atmosphere and then
precipitates. In Utqiaġvik, where temperatures are below freezing most
of the year, this precipitation is most often in the form of snow.
Utqiaġvik used to receive less than six inches of precipitation per
year; now that's changed. More snow means more accumulation along roads
and near buildings. When snow is dry it acts as an insulator, keeping
ground temperatures warm in the winter. [But once the snow melts,
flooded areas capture more solar energy, leading to further thawing.
Caitlin Wylie, associate professor of science, technology and society at
UVA, has been focused on how the [research approach can be captured in a
manner to be used again in other projects]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
Wylie, her work is to help establish a blueprint which can be applied to
future projects. "By studying how we can improve our work across
disciplines," Wylie said of her involvement, "I think that will
translate in some ways to how to better work between Western knowledge
and Indigenous knowledge." Involving UVA students (undergraduate and
graduate) and postdocs is also important to the Arctic Cities team. Last
spring, select School of Architecture design students participated in a
research studio in Utqiaġvik. Students focused on snow and drainage
maintenance. [The design proposals developed by the students won the
American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) Student Honor Award for
research excellence. This year marks the halfway point in the NSF
project. The upcoming field season includes regular trips from the UVA
team and workshops with community members and
organizations.]{.underline} There are hopes to host another design
studio for UVA students as well as a class for community members at
Illsaġvik College in Utqiaġvik. The entire team wants their
contributions to not only help their partners in Utqiaġvik but also
communities across the globe that require an urgent response to climate
change. "The North Slope of Alaska causes you to stop and rethink how we
live and our relationship with the environment," said Jull. "The Arctic
is constantly grinding through cycles of transformation. It allows a
greater understanding of humans' ability to adapt to a place and call
that home, and how that reflects on our own capabilities."

[Modellers attempt to project how much of this carbon will be released
when the permafrost thaws. It is complicated: for example, they need to
understand how much of the carbon in the air will be taken up by plants
and returned to the soil, replenishing some of what was lost.]{.mark}
[Predictions suggest that [slow and steady thawing will release around
200 billion tonnes of carbon]{.mark}]{.underline} over the next 300
years under a business-as-usual warming scenario. That's equivalent to
about 15% of all the soil carbon currently stockpiled in the frozen
north. [[But]{.mark} that could be a vast underestimate]{.underline}.
[[Around 20% of frozen lands have features that increase the likelihood
of abrupt thawing]{.underline}, [such as large quantities of ice in the
ground or unstable slopes]{.underline}]{.mark}[. [Here permafrost thaws
quickly and erratically, triggering landslides and rapid
erosion]{.mark}. Forests can be flooded, [killing large areas of
trees]{.mark}. Lakes that have existed for generations can disappear, or
their waters can be diverted.]{.underline} Worse, [the most unstable
regions also tend to be the most carbon-rich]{.underline}. For example,
1 million square kilometres of Siberia, Canada and Alaska contain
pockets of Yedoma --- thick deposits of permafrost from the last ice
age[4](https://archive.is/o/u12Ie/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01313-4%23ref-CR4).
These deposits are often 90% ice, making them extremely vulnerable to
warming. Moreover, because of the glacial dust and grasslands that were
folded in when the deposits formed, Yedoma contains 130 billion tonnes
of organic carbon --- the equivalent of more than a decade of global
human greenhouse-gas emissions. How much permafrost carbon might be
released with abrupt thawing? As a first step, this year we synthesized
results from published studies of abrupt thawing across the permafrost
zone. We asked how this type of thawing influences plants, soils and
moisture in the ground. The studies revealed patterns of collapse and
recovery. This international project was supported by the Permafrost
Carbon Network
([www.permafrostcarbon.org](https://archive.is/o/u12Ie/www.permafrostcarbon.org/)),
part of the multimillion-dollar global Study of Environmental Arctic
Change (SEARCH). Lakes and wetlands are a big part of the problem
because they release large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that is
much more potent than
CO2[5](https://archive.is/o/u12Ie/https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01313-4%23ref-CR5).
Erosion from hills and mountains is also problematic: when hillsides
thaw and break up, much CO2 is released as material is destabilized,
decomposed or washed into streams or rivers. We estimate that abrupt
permafrost thawing in lowland lakes and wetlands, together with that in
upland hills, could release between 60 billion and 100 billion tonnes of
carbon by 2300. This is in addition to the 200 billion tonnes of carbon
expected to be released in other regions that will thaw gradually.
[Although [abrupt permafrost thawing]{.mark} will occur in less than 20%
of frozen land, it [increases permafrost carbon release projections by
about 50%]{.mark}. Gradual thawing affects the surface of frozen ground
and slowly penetrates downwards. Sudden collapse releases more carbon
per square metre [because it disrupts stockpiles]{.mark} deep in frozen
layers.]{.underline} Furthermore, because abrupt thawing releases more
methane than gradual thawing does, the climate impacts of the two
processes will be similar. So, together, [the impacts of thawing
permafrost on Earth's climate could be twice that expected]{.underline}
from current models. Stabilizing the climate at 1.5 °C of warming
requires massive cuts in carbon emissions from human activities; extra
carbon emissions from a thawing Arctic make that even more urgent.
Research gaps Our estimates are rough and need refining. However, they
show that [[understanding abrupt thawing must be a]{.mark} research
[priority]{.mark}]{.underline}. [First, climate and soil [scientists
need to]{.mark} find out where the greatest emissions of methane and CO2
will come from.]{.underline} Although we have a good idea of current
numbers of thaw lakes and wetlands, and how many existed in the past,
[we need to [be able to project where new ones will
appear]{.mark}.]{.underline} We also need to know how quickly they will
drain as the climate warms. Second, the erosion of thawed soils on
hillsides is poorly understood. Because collapsing slopes are hard to
detect using satellites, only a few large-scale studies have been done,
often using data from oil exploration or road surveys. Researchers need
to establish how much permafrost carbon is displaced and what happens
after it has thawed. For example, it is not known how much will stay in
the ground or be buried, and how much will enter the atmosphere as a
greenhouse gas. And what happens to this material if it flows into
rivers, lakes and estuaries? Third, we need to identify the extent to
which plant growth will offset the carbon that is released by
permafrost. Over time, lakes are invaded by wetland plants, and
eventually drain and convert back to tundra. Eroded areas are colonized
by plants, which helps to stabilize soils and speed their recovery.
Researchers need to monitor how thawed ecosystems evolve, the rate at
which vegetation stabilizes, and how these plants accumulate biomass.
Vegetation also responds to rising CO2 and nutrients, longer growing
seasons and changing levels of soil moisture. Modellers will need to
predict changing feedbacks between ecological communities and
geomorphology as permafrost landscapes transform. Fourth, the
distribution of ice in the ground is the main factor influencing the
fate of permafrost carbon. Yet observations of ground ice are sparse.
More-widespread geophysical measurements could map pockets of ice below
the surface, revealing where it concentrates and how quickly it melts.
Machine-learning techniques might even be developed to predict where
most ice is buried, by analysing soils and topography at the surface.
Next steps To plug these knowledge gaps, we have five recommendations.
Extend measurement technology. [[There should be better tracking of
permafrost]{.mark} and carbon [across the Arctic]{.mark}, especially in
regions undergoing abrupt thawing. It is important to establish
baselines of permafrost and ecosystem change against which future
measures can be compared.]{.underline} This will require aircraft-based
lidar (light detection and ranging, a surveying technique that uses
pulsed laser light), drone-based surveys and better algorithms for image
analysis. [[Fund monitoring sites.]{.mark} River chemistry can be a
sensitive indicator of abrupt thawing, but many monitoring stations are
being abandoned]{.underline}. Instead, there should be
[[increase]{.mark}d [national]{.mark}]{.underline} and international
[[investment in]{.mark} long-term sites]{.underline} that link
land-based observations with aquatic and marine measurements. [Better
recordings of organic matter and nutrients in rivers would shed light on
how permafrost plant and microbial communities respond to abrupt and
gradual thawing.]{.underline} Gather more data. [Regions that are
vulnerable to abrupt thawing need more boreholes, [long-term
observatories]{.mark} and experiments]{.underline}. Field measurements
should quantify how much CO2 and methane is released to the atmosphere
as frozen soils are disturbed and recover. Importantly, permafrost
researchers and industry groups must deposit all ground-ice data ---
even if the information is qualitative --- in public archives. Build
holistic models. Earth-system models should include the key processes
affecting carbon release from permafrost --- including how temperature
and moisture influence carbon release for a range of climate and
vegetation scenarios. Because abrupt thawing occurs at fine spatial
scales, detailed process models of these dynamics could be impractical
to run directly within Earth-system models. Frameworks must be developed
to understand and quantify the effect of these fine-scale processes at
the global level. Improve reports. Policymakers need the best current
estimates of the implications of abrupt thawing on climate change. It
needs to be considered within the set of unresolved climate feedbacks,
as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) did for gradual
thawing in its 2018 special report. The Permafrost Carbon Network is
contributing to such efforts, for example by ensuring that abrupt
thawing is characterized in the IPCC's Special Report on the Ocean and
Cryosphere in a Changing Climate, which will be released later this
year. [[We can't prevent abrupt thawing of permafrost. But we can try to
forecast where and when it is likely to happen,]{.mark} to enable
decision makers and communities [to protect people and
resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} Reducing global emissions might be the
surest way to slow further release of permafrost carbon into the
atmosphere. Let's keep that carbon where it belongs --- safely frozen in
the stunning soils of the north.

Issues for Congress Climate Change, with Biophysical and Economic
Impacts60 [An [array of climate changes in]{.mark} the [Arctic is now
documented by observing systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, with more expected
with future greenhouse gas-driven climate change. Observed physical
changes in the Arctic include warming ocean, soil, and air temperatures;
melting permafrost; shifting vegetation and animal abundances; and
altered characteristics of Arctic cyclones. These changes continue to
affect traditional livelihoods and cultures in the region,
infrastructure, and the economy, as well as the distribution and health
of animal populations and vegetation. The changes raise risks of
pollution, food supply, safety, cultural losses, and national security.
The state government of Alaska concluded that observed climate changes
"have resulted in a reduction of subsistence harvests, an increase in
flooding and erosion, concerns about water and food safety and major
impacts to infrastructure: including damage to buildings, roads and
airports."61 A monitoring report of the Arctic Council concluded in 2019
that the Arctic biophysical system is now clearly trending away from its
previous state \[in the 20th century\] and into a period of
unprecedented change, with implications not only within but also beyond
the Arctic.62 A few broad points raise particular concerns about changes
in the Arctic: • Long lag times between cause and full effects: Changes
once set in motion prompt further and often slow effects in different
components of the Arctic system, such as the influence of rising
atmospheric temperatures on ocean and permafrost temperatures.
Scientists expect the full effects of near-term climate changes to play
out over a period of decades to many centuries. • Feedbacks that mostly
further increase warming: Greenhouse gas-induced warming leads to
positive (enhancing) and some negative (dampening) feedbacks within the
Arctic system, which scientists expect in net to amplify warming and
pursuant effects. For example, temperature-driven melting sea ice
reduces reflection of incoming solar energy, leading to absorption by
the Arctic Ocean and further warming of the ocean and the planet. •
Abrupt change risks: The freezing point for water, including permafrost,
is one example of thresholds that certain Arctic systems may cross,
leading to rapid state changes. • Risks of irreversibilities: Some
Arctic climate impacts, such as loss of sea ice and glaciers, may lead
to system changes that scientists expect would be irreversible on a
human timescale, even if temperatures stabilize (at a higher level than
today). 60 This section was prepared by Jane Leggett, who was a
Specialist in Energy and Environmental Policy, Resources, Science, and
Industry Division until her retirement from CRS on July 15, 2023. 61

Arctic: Background and Issues for Congress Congressional Research
Service 18 Understanding remains incomplete regarding future Arctic
climate changes and their implications for human and natural systems.
With current knowledge, projections point to growing risks, as well as
some opportunities. The Arctic is interconnected to the rest of the
globe through circulation of water, energy (e.g., heat), and carbon,
including through the atmosphere and oceans. It is also connected
through human systems of transport, energy and mineral production,
tourism, and security. Consequently, [[Arctic]{.mark} [changes are of
import]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} both Arctic and
non-Arctic regions of [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} and
the rest of the globe. This section summarizes a variety of observed and
projected climate changes in the Arctic and identifies some of their
impacts on human and ecological systems.63 Other sections in this report
provide further discussion of implications for, for example, national
security and energy production. Warming Temperatures and a More Intense
Water Cycle The Arctic warmed at approximately three times the global
average rate from 1971 to 2019, with the region's surface temperature
increasing by more than 3°C (5.5°F).64 Summers have warmed more than
winters. In tandem are trends of fewer cold days, cold nights, frost
days, and ice days in the North American Arctic.65 Researchers found
that warming trends as well as climate cycles, including the North
Atlantic Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation, influence observed
extreme temperatures, ice distribution, and other facets of the Arctic
system. 66 In addition, positive feedbacks from the loss of summer sea
ice and spring snow cover on land have amplified warming in the
Arctic.67 With warming, the water cycle has become more intense. The
Arctic has experienced increasing precipitation and an increasing share
of precipitation falling as rain. The first recorded rainfall at
Greenland's 10,500-foot Summit Station was on August 14, 2021.68 Warming
and increasing rainfall have led to permafrost thaw, glacier melt, and
sea ice decline, leading to greater flows of organic matter and
nutrients to Arctic near‐coastal zones, with implications for algae,
ecosystems, fisheries and other systems. Sea Ice Decline and Mobility
Arctic sea ice has declined in extent, area, and thickness over recent
decades; it has become more mobile and its spatial distribution has
shifted. The record low extents of Arctic sea ice in 2012 and 2007
(Figure 4 and Figure 5), as recorded by U.S. [[N]{.mark}ational
[S]{.mark}now and [I]{.mark}ce [D]{.mark}ata [C]{.mark}enter, [increased
scientific and policy attention on climate changes in]{.mark} the high
[north]{.mark}]{.underline}, and on the implications of projected
ice-free69 seasons in the Arctic Ocean within decades. Recent late
summer minima may be unprecedented over the past 1,000 years.70 (Some
implications are discussed in sections of this report on Commercial Sea
Transportation; Oil, Gas, and Mineral Exploration; and others.) The 2021
Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) concluded that "human influence is very likely the main
driver of \... the decrease in Arctic sea ice area between 1979--1988
and 2010--2019 (about 40% in September and about 10% in March)."71
Simulations under a wide range of future climate change scenarios
indicate that the Arctic could be ice-free in late summers in the second
half of this century in model simulations of low to very high greenhouse
gas scenarios (Figure 5).72 The first instances of an ice-free Arctic in
late summers could occur by mid-century in all scenarios, although model
simulations provide a wide range of results.73 The mean results of model
simulations reach ice-free seasons in the 2070s in the highest and low
warming scenarios, and later in the very low scenarios. In an analysis
of the most recent modeling, a selection of those models that
"reasonably" simulate historical sea ice extent indicated that
practically ice-free conditions may occur at global temperature
increases of 1.3°C to 2.9°C above preindustrial 69 In scientific
analyses, "ice-free" does not necessarily mean "no ice." The definition
of "ice-free" or sea ice "extent" or "area" varies across studies. Sea
ice "extent" is one common measure, equal to the sum of the area of grid
cells that have ice concentration of less than a set
percentage---frequently 15%. For more information, see the National Snow
and Ice Data Center, http://nsidc.org/seaice/data/terminology.html. 70

noted, in addition, the importance of melting of Arctic landbased ice to
experienced sea level rise globally: In the 47-year period (1971--2017),
the Arctic was the largest global source of sea-level rise contribution,
48% of the global land ice contribution 2003--2010 and 30% of the total
sea-level rise since 1992. Temperature effects are dominant in land ice
mass balance. A special report of the IPCC stated that "for Arctic
glaciers, different regional studies consistently indicate that in many
places glaciers are now smaller than they have been in millennia."75 The
Arctic Ocean has been undergoing additional changes: It has been
acidifying---with some parts acidifying more rapidly than the Atlantic
or Pacific Oceans.76 Some scientists estimate that 74 The current
temperature increase above the 1850-1900 average is about 1.1°C. 75

Changes in the Arctic: Background and Issues for Congress Congressional
Research Service 21 acidification of the Arctic Ocean may increase
enough by the 2030s to significantly influence coastal ecosystems.77
Primary production in the ocean has increased, due to decreases in sea
ice and increases in nutrient supply. Land-Based Changes Climate changes
in the Arctic have important implications for human and natural
land-based systems, through permafrost thawing, erosion, instability,
and ecosystem shifts. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) concluded that
an increase in coastal erosion on the North Slope of Alaska was "likely
the result of several changing Arctic conditions, including declining
sea-ice extent, increasing summertime sea-surface temperature, rising
sea level, and possible increases in storm power and corresponding wave
action."78 The USGS found that erosion has been occurring at an average
rate of 1.4 meters annually and that, while some areas are accreting,
others are eroding at rates as high as 20 meters per year. Coastal
erosion poses risks for native communities, oil and gas infrastructure,
and wildlife; adaptations to mitigate and manage adverse impacts can be
costly and risky. Warming temperatures have increased thawing of
near-surface permafrost. "The majority of Arctic infrastructure is
located in regions where permafrost thaw is projected to intensify by
midcentury," according to the IPCC special report on the cryosphere.79
Existing infrastructure was not generally placed or engineered for the
instability, posing risks to human safety and property, and potentially
disruption. The IPCC report assessed that "about 20% of Arctic land
permafrost is vulnerable to abrupt permafrost thaw and ground
subsidence,"80 increasing risks of sudden failures. According to one
study, 30%--50% of critical circumpolar infrastructure may be at high
risk by 2050. "Accordingly, permafrost degradation-related
infrastructure costs could rise to tens of billions of U.S. dollars by
the second half of the century."81 Other costs could be incurred for
relocation of infrastructure and villages, and to manage habitat for
subsistence wildlife and endangered and threatened species. Impacts of
climate change on species have been positive and negative. Longer
growing seasons have resulted in vegetation growth around the Arctic
with overall "greening," though also some "browning" in some regions in
some years. Woody shrubs and trees are projected to expand to cover
24%--52% of Arctic tundra by 2050.82 Vegetation changes can provide
amplifying feedbacks that increase temperature and permafrost
instability. In particular, scientists have assessed significant methane
emissions from some thawing peat bogs. Potential area burned by wildfire
could increase by 25% to 53% by 2100. This could affect, for example,
forage for caribou and shifting competition between caribou and moose,
with likely detriments to subsistence users of caribou.83 77 U.S. Global

SPM 2019.The IPCC special report on the cryosphere also found that. On
Arctic land, a loss of globally unique biodiversity is projected as
limited refugia exist for some High-Arctic species and hence they are
outcompeted by more temperate species (medium confidence).84 It
identified negative impacts also on food and water security in the
Arctic, "disrupt\[ing\] access to, and food availability within,
herding, hunting, fishing, and gathering areas, harming the livelihoods
and cultural identity of Arctic residents including Indigenous
populations."85 More broadly, warming and ecosystem shifts have
"increased risk of food- and waterborne diseases, malnutrition, injury,
and mental health challenges especially among Indigenous peoples."86 Few
studies have investigated the potential economic effects of the array of
physical impacts. A report for the state of Alaska on the economic
effects of climate change estimated that five relatively certain, large
effects that could be readily quantified would impose an annual net cost
of \$340--\$700 million, or 0.6%--1.3% of Alaska's GDP. This
significant, but relatively modest, net economic effect for Alaska as a
whole obscures large regional disparities, as rural communities face
large projected costs while more southerly urban residents experience
net gains.87 The research did not consider "nonuse" impacts, such as on
culture, subsistence harvests, or other nonmarket values, as well as
additional sectors, such as military installations, housing, and others.
Another study estimating the effects of climate change on [[Alaskan
infrastructure found]{.mark} "cumulative [estimated expenses from
climate-related damage to infrastructure without adaptation]{.mark}
measures]{.underline} (hereinafter damages) from 2015 to 2099 totaled
\$5.5 billion (2015 dollars, 3% discount) for RCP8.5 \[a high climate
scenario\] and \$4.2 billion for RCP4.5 \[a moderate climate scenario\],
suggesting that reducing greenhouse gas emissions could lessen damages
by \$1.3 billion this century."88 Costs were mostly due to road flooding
and permafrost instability, and mostly in the interior and southcentral
Alaska[. It [also concluded that adaptation measures could]{.mark}
mostly reduce or [entirely avoid the estimated economic losses for this
land-based infrastructure.]{.mark}]{.underline}

There are national and international efforts to anticipate and control
infectious diseases in the Arctic. Marion Koopmans, a veterinary
virologist at The Netherlands' Versatile Emerging Infectious Disease
Observatory who has worked extensively on COVID-19 epidemiology, says,
"Since the pandemic there was a big scale-up of the ability to test in
all sorts of places in the world, and there's now initiative to see how
we can use that capacity for other things."

The World Health Organization ([[WHO]{.underline}]{.mark}) [has
[compiled a list of "priority pathogens]{.mark}"\[35\] [requiring
more]{.mark} investment and [research]{.mark}]{.underline}. The list
[comprises mostly tropical pathogens and a few temperate ones, but it
does [include]{.mark} ["Disease X,"]{.mark} which "[represents the
knowledge that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a
pathogen]{.mark} currently [unknown to cause human
disease]{.mark}]{.underline}."

But again, most of the attention is on known pathogens. Koopmans would
not put the Arctic at the top of her surveillance list. She says, "I
would assume that opportunity \[in the Arctic\] is way less than for
some of the high-risk hotspots, let's say in Southeast Asia," where
diseases like polio could simply get out of hand because of inadequate
public health protections.

In Alaska, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors
infections of five bacterial pathogens including three Streptococcus,
one Meningococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae (a bacterium, not the
influenza virus), along with several viral pathogens, CDC public affairs
officer Thomas Skinner wrote in an email.

[Public health [surveillance that concentrates only on known
diseases]{.mark} and disregards wider, rapidly changing microbial
ecology, including the transformation now underway in large areas of
permafrost, [could miss a dangerous microbe]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Studying known pathogens requires techniques and knowledge bases
different from those needed for newly emerging pathogens]{.mark}, says
Jean-Michel Claverie, emeritus professor at the Structural and Genomic
Information Laboratory in Marseille, France. Experts at the WHO and CDC
are "[highly specialized people with a matrix of things they want to
look for]{.mark}," he says. Claverie has [revived permafrost viruses
that infect amoebae. "It's totally different from people you need to
detect a new disease]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[If the international community **[comes up with a viable research
program generalizable to many diseases of concern]{.mark}**, then the
WHO's work to prepare for Disease X [will be helpful in the event of a
new, a newly pathogenic, or a familiar microbe emerging as a result of
climate change in the Arctic]{.mark}. But unless there is active
surveillance there, a new permafrost pathogen will still have its window
of opportunity. [It would be a mistake to omit the Arctic from hotspot
surveillance.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The model for finding emerging southerly pathogens like Ebola, Marburg,
and SARS has been to sample remote environments and culture their
microbes in a laboratory, usually in a city---an approach detailed in
Laurie Garrett's monumental 1994 book, The Coming Plague. Today not
everyone thinks this is the best way to monitor emerging pathogens.
Better, say many experts, would be to put places where human habitats
are directly encountering new ecosystems under surveillance---without
penetrating deep into those ecosystems---keeping a close eye on what
happens to humans and other animals, especially livestock and wildlife,
at those interfaces.

Claverie would like the University of the Arctic, a multi-institutional
collaborative established by the Arctic Council, to install "a
monitoring circle around the North Pole of those \[human\] populations.
They are the first contact. They are in contact with animals." The best
scenario, he says is "[if you could catch the new disease when it is
first infecting humans but has not acquired the capacity to go from
human to human."]{.underline}

Koopmans recommends global adoption of the One Health concept, which the
WHO describes as recognizing that "the health of humans, domestic and
wild animals, plants, and the wider environment (including ecosystems)
are closely linked and interdependent." [The Arctic Council is
[attempting to incorporate One Health into its planning
scenarios]{.mark}.]{.underline} Unfortunately, the process is very slow,
and globally there has been inadequate forward progress in One Health
adoption since its creation in 2004. There are still siloes impeding the
sharing of expertise among microbial ecologists, wildlife veterinarians,
human infectious disease epidemiologists, and other experts.

**Surveillance and research must be implemented to fight disease**

Searching for \"cold hard\" proof of global warming? Look no further
than the melting ice of the Arctic. Warming twice as fast as the rest of
the planet, the region is recognized as a frontline for climate change.
With potential global implications, the thaw begs the question: [Do we
know what pathogens lie in wait underground?]{.underline}

Imagine the [next pandemic developing from [harmful microbes present
within permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}, part of the long-frozen Arctic
terrain. This scenario may sound like science fiction but is an
[all-too-real threat]{.underline}.

In 2016, for example, [[13 people in Siberia became ill from anthrax
spores]{.underline}]{.mark} linked to the thawed carcass of a reindeer
that died 75 years prior. [[Surveillance systems do exist]{.mark} to
monitor such incidents as disease presents in people]{.underline}. But
[[no system exists to detect pathogens in the environment **before
diseases strike**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\"Essentially, we know when people get sick, but we don't always know
the locations where people were exposed,\" says MITRE epidemiologist
Alex Wu. He led a MITRE research team in taking the first step toward
developing a more proactive approach to battling diseases that could
emerge from permafrost.

Our experts reviewed the state of the science of current efforts to
surveil pathogens in the Arctic. [They [identified a significant gap in
understanding where potentially dangerous microorganisms may reside in
permafrost.]{.mark} And they demonstrated how [pathogens could be mapped
to alert public health officials to their presence before people fall
ill]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"[We [need an integrated system that combines the information from
permafrost thaw, climate prediction models, human activity, soil
microbial data, and locations of human and animal
remains]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}\" Wu explains. \"This [will be
[vital to the next phase of fighting diseases at their origin to prevent
their spread]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

It is currently unknown how many **[[viruses are trapped in
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but when thawed, so-called "sleeping"
or "zombie" viruses may become free to infect hosts. Although viruses
can be preserved in a frozen environment for long periods of time,69
endurance of environment pressures during thawing without bursting is
critical for viruses to remain intact and infectious. One example of a
class of viruses that have managed to survive in ancient permafrost are
giant viruses. Giant viruses or nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses
(NCDLVs) are known to have durable multiple layers enclosing virion
nucleoids, making them resistant to the harsh permafrost
environment[70](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
(giant viruses in [Figure
1](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9#fig1)).
Two members of giant viruses, *Pithovirus
sibericum*[50](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
and *Mollivirus
sibericum*,[71](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
have been isolated and revived from 30,000-year-old Siberian permafrost.
Although these **[[viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}** were
**[[preserved]{.underline}]{.mark}** frozen **[[in
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}** for at least ∼30,000 years, after
thawing, they were **[[able to infect a modern-day version of their
host]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[50](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
The isolated giant viruses were reported to have thick outer walls of
40--70
nm,[71](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9),[72](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
comparable with 20--80 nm for Gram-positive
bacteria.[73](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
However, the giant viruses that have been characterized to date do not
pose a threat to humans and other animals because their natural hosts
are micro-eukaryotes, such as protists and algae (protozoa in [Figure
1](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9#fig1)).
Another giant virus, Mimivirus, which was first isolated from water
samples for investigating a pneumonia
outbreak,[74](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
was found to be capable of entering human and mouse myeloid cells,
resulting in a significant increase in viral DNA and a decrease in
macrophage
viability.[75](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
A clinical study also reported a high prevalence of Mimivirus antibodies
in individuals with pneumonia with unknown underlying
mechanisms.[76](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
Although viruses often have a narrow and specific host range, these
findings challenge the assumption that micro-eukaryotes are exclusive
hosts for giant viruses, highlighting a **[[major knowledge gap in
virus-host relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Currently, however,
there is no evidence showing that isolated and revived giant viruses
from permafrost can cause human infections. The majority of DNA viruses
in permafrost environments are phages and, therefore, cannot cause
disease in humans. In fact, phages are arguably the most well-studied
type of virus, and the majority of them (and viruses in general) are
host specific. This means that they can only infect bacteria that are of
the same species and often only the same
strain.[77](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9),[78](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
Despite phages being largely bacterial host specific, they appear to be
major community-structuring agents that uphold a diverse permafrost
microbiome. **[[A diverse microbiome prevents any specific
bacterium]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g., a human pathogen) **[[from
growing]{.underline}]{.mark}** in abundance. This means that, beyond
phages **[[killing pathogenic bacteria, thereby protecting
us]{.underline}]{.mark}**, they can **[[create an ecosystem where
pathogenic bacteria are less likely to be of concern to
humans]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[79](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
Given current evidence of the widespread presence of phages in all
soils, including permafrost, they are very unlikely to represent a
threat to humans. Other types of DNA viruses, such as Variola virus,
which causes smallpox, that infect humans may be present in permafrost
environments, but they have not been detected in sufficient numbers or
with good enough quality to pose a
threat.[80](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
Because DNA viruses co-evolve and replicate in the presence of their
hosts, for pathogenic human viruses to be present in sufficient
quantities to cause infection, human/animal remains would have to be
preserved in a condition that allows viral survival. However, this is
highly unlikely. For example, Variola virus DNA was recovered from
several archeological sites in northeastern Siberia dating back to the
late 17th--19th century. Smallpox victims mummified in the permafrost
were found, but the Variola virus DNA was highly degraded, and, thus,
the virus was not
infectious.[81](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9),[82](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
Therefore, although human DNA viral pathogens can be detected in
permafrost, the risk of infection is negligible and only of concern when
the virus is intact and present in sufficient quantities to cause
disease. It is noteworthy that, to date, there have been no reported
cases of viral infections from thawed permafrost in humans. To our
knowledge, there is **[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}** genetically informed
ecological **[[study of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[RNA]{.underline}]{.mark}** viral community **[[in
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One reason why RNA viruses are
understudied compared with DNA viruses is that RNA is less stable
compared with
DNA[83](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
and more prone to degradation during the extraction process. One example
of an **[[RNA]{.underline}]{.mark}** virus is the H1N1 influenza A virus
that **[[caused the 1918 pandemic. This virus killed an estimated 50
million people]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which overwhelmed the burial of
infected humans, leading to mass graves and unburied
corpses.[84](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
These **[[mass graves]{.underline}]{.mark}** largely
**[[went]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[unmarked]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[leaving the potential for humans to interact with these corpses
should permafrost thaw]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the 1990s, attempts
were made to reconstruct or revive the 1918 pandemic influenza virus
from frozen samples, but they were unsuccessful because the RNA was
highly degraded. In the early 2000s, advances in technology allowed
successful reconstruction of the H1N1 virus from permafrost, but it was
not
viable.[80](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
Complete hemagglutinin (HA) genes, encoding binding proteins to initiate
infection, were detected in reserve-transcribed RNAs extracted from
frozen lung tissues of 1918 influenza victims who were buried in a mass
grave in
permafrost.[85](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
Although this last example could be taken as a cause for concern, the
viruses were not infectious. Ancient RNA extracted from wolf tissue
buried in late Pleistocene permafrost showed no traces of RNA
viruses.[86](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
To date, there is no report of intact and infectious RNA viruses
directly isolated from permafrost. Therefore, although **[[RNA viruses
can be preserved in permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}**, based on our
current knowledge, the risk of these RNA viruses being infectious to
humans or other animals is unlikely. Permafrost thaw is causing major
changes in plant composition and productivity and will undoubtedly
affect plant viral
pathogens.[87](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
Previously, plant viral pathogens, such as ancient caribou
feces-associated virus (aCFV) and tomato mosaic Tobamovirus (ToMV) were
recovered from
ice.[27](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9),[88](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
aCFV is a DNA virus that can infect *Nicotiana benthamiana* (a close
relative of tobacco) and may even infect other plants or fungi (e.g.,
mosses and lichens); it was recovered from caribou feces dating back 700
years before present
(BP).[27](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
To test whether aCFV was still infectious, a modern version of *N.
benthami*ana was exposed and successfully infected. Although the plant
became infected, it had an asymptomatic infection, likely because of
changes in the plant species over time. Unlike aCFV, ToMV is one of the
most common plant viruses because it has the ability to infect many
different plants, such as cucumber, lettuce, beet, and
pepper.[89](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
This RNA virus is very stable, having been shown previously to survive
UV radiation and desiccation, and was recovered from ice cores dating
back up to 140,000 years
ago.[88](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
It is unknown whether the recovered ToMV could still be infectious, but
it presents a potential problem because it is one of the most
**[[destructive diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}**, resulting
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** serious crop
losses.[90](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)
Introduction of non-native crops to soils, such as recently **[[thawed
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}** soils, could also **[[increase the
likelihood of a viral]{.underline}]{.mark}** plant
**[[epidemic]{.underline}]{.mark}**.[87](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9),[90](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(22)00143-9)

This study is the first to systematically map and [characterize the
implementation of OH and the integration of Indigenous Knowledge and
leadership in surveillance systems for CSIDs in the Canadian Arctic and
subarctic regions]{.underline}. Results reveal that although [some
surveillance activities were found for almost all CSIDs prioritized by
the Arctic Council, [major gaps were identified regarding the equitable
inclusion of regions]{.mark} across the [Canadian Arctic and subarctic
regions]{.mark}]{.underline} that are the most strongly affected by
climate change, the implementation of a sustainable One Health approach,
and the integration of a strong Indigenous leadership in existing
initiatives.

Geographic representation

[[Surveillance activities appeared to be unevenly distributed across the
Northern region]{.underline}]{.mark}, with some territories and/or
communities better represented than others. Indeed, the majority of the
surveillance programs were located in the Northwest Territories and
Nunavut, whereas Yukon and Newfoundland-Labrador were the least-covered
areas. Other northern Indigenous communities in Canada, especially those
in subarctic regions, are also suffering from climate change and
emerging diseases and could benefit from a more inclusive CSID
surveillance network.

One Health implementation and sustainability

[OH [implementation was not explicitly mentioned in any surveillance
documentation]{.mark}]{.underline} retrieved in this study. There was
also no available information on the collaboration efforts between
sectors, including co-planning, data collection, management and sharing,
dissemination of findings, and communication of positive cases between
agencies. [Nevertheless, [a partnership amongst academics, governments,
NGOs and local groups is **crucial** for complex surveillance
programs]{.mark}]{.underline}, and most of the programs [included at
least some representation of these groups]{.underline}. A more indepth
evaluation of OH integration into CSID surveillance programs currently
taking place in the Canadian Arctic and subarctic regions would be
beneficial to obtain more accurate and comprehensive information before
identifying and addressing gaps \[14, 99\].

[Another important finding was that most of the non-mandatory
surveillance activities were not long-term formal surveillance programs,
but rather multi-year [activities conducted by a research network or
team]{.mark}, which can impede the sustainability of current CSID
surveillance]{.underline}. This can be mainly observed in Category C
(targeting wildlife), which includes programs that involved many
organizations and various sources of funding. Although the inclusion of
multiple partners in the surveillance of CSIDs can create synergies
between surveillance and research, this approach can also be a threat to
surveillance programs if their activities rely on research funds.
Long-term surveillance programs are essential for the continuous
monitoring and evaluation of CSIDs affecting humans, animals, and their
shared environments and could provide the information needed to detect,
prevent, and control these diseases \[100\]. The lack of adequate
surveillance systems for CSIDs in the North has been noted by other
authors \[7, 101\], as is the need for the development and
implementation of sustainable CSID surveillance systems in the Arctic
and subarctic regions \[102\]. Awuor and collaborators (2019) [propose
that this gap is partly due to the availability of sufficient data on
the risks of a disease justifying stopping a program, or to a lack of
financial resources]{.underline} \[103\]. However, as they pointed out[,
sustainable and continuous surveillance activities are critically needed
to assess risks, fully understand the situation, and prepare for future
emergences.]{.underline}

[Leadership of Indigenous communities]{.underline}

The findings of this study also underline an apparent lack of
involvement from Indigenous communities in certain programs, despite all
of these activities taking place on native lands. Detailed reporting of
participatory processes is crucial for the co-production of knowledge in
the Arctic \[104\]. It is [also [essential that Indigenous people be at
the core of the management and design of CSID surveillance programs in
the future]{.mark}]{.underline} \[7, 101\]. Equitable inclusion of
diverse knowledge systems achieves better outcomes than a sectoral
framework, particularly in the circumpolar region where the majority of
the population is Indigenous \[105, 106\]. [Integration of Indigenous
Knowledge in research and surveillance of health threats for humans,
animals, and ecosystems is also known to contribute meaningfully to
adaptation to climate change]{.underline} \[107, 108\].

Despite these remaining challenges, some examples suggest positive
changes over time toward stronger Indigenous leadership. For example,
Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK) became the lead and developed the
Qanuippitaa? National Inuit Health Survey (QNIHS) from 2021 onwards
\[31\]. Before 2021, similar Indigenous health surveys were conducted
through partnerships between researchers, Inuit organizations and local
health authorities, but not led by Indigenous communities. Another
example identified in this study is the "Community-based monitoring
program of wildlife health", which [integrates local and Indigenous
Knowledge with western ecological knowledge]{.underline} \[95, 109\].
Other existing good examples of Indigenous Knowledge integration in
research and practices could serve as models to enhance current
practices in CSID surveillance. A mapping of all community-based
monitoring activities in the Arctic by the Sustaining Arctic Observing
Networks led to the publication of the web Atlas Nunaliit in 2015
(http://www.arcticcbm.org) \[110\]. While not specifically targeting
CSIDs, this work highlighted good practices for conducting monitoring
activities in partnership with Indigenous communities. These practices
include capacity building, co-production of knowledge, support for the
construction of sustainable networks, development of accessible data
management protocols, use of the collected data to inform
decision-making, and ensuring the sustainability of the programs
\[110\].

The need for a coherent, Arctic- and subarctic-wide, One Health
surveillance strategy for CSIDs, co-managed by the Indigenous
communities

A [key priority for [future developments in CSID surveillance in the
Canadian Arctic and subarctic regions is to identify and prioritize
CSIDs of interest for the various regions and communities
involved]{.mark}. To achieve this, we propose [employing a participatory
**research** approach involving Indigenous community
representatives]{.mark}.]{.underline}

To ensure that [information on surveillance activities is more
comprehensible and accessible, there are existing examples of mapping
activities related to climate change]{.underline}. For instance, Canada
in a Changing Climate: Advancing our Knowledge for Action produced a
geographical map documenting case stories related to adaptations and
resilience for addressing climate change in Canada \[111\]. Another
example is The Northern Caribou Canada project, which aims to track
changes in Canadian Arctic and subarctic caribou populations,
incorporating both traditional and scientific knowledge \[112\]. The
Wekʼèezhìi Renewable Resources Board, led by the Tłı̨chǫ Nation and
supported by the federal and territorial government, created this
project. These are examples of tools used for CSID surveillance
activities that make the information more accessible to all
organizations and groups, and to the public, including Indigenous
Peoples.

Limitations of the study

This study has limitations. Firstly, during our research, [we excluded
surveillance programs for infectious diseases in the Arctic and
subarctic regions that were not listed in the International Circumpolar
Working Group, but which could also be considered as CSIDs]{.underline}.
For instance, the International Circumpolar Surveillance system collects
data on invasive bacterial diseases, but none are pathogens prioritized
by the Arctic council \[113,114,115,116\]. Numerous authors have
[emphasized a possible increased burden for several infectious diseases
not included in this study, including enteric infections]{.underline}
\[117\], helminthic zoonoses \[101, 118\], Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae
\[119\], rickettsial diseases and mosquito-borne viruses, including
California serogroup viruses \[120, 121\] in the Northern regions within
the context of changing climate. Also, since the study, several other
infectious agents that could be of concern have emerged, but were not
included.

Secondly, [we **[encountered considerable difficulty in accessing
information on existing surveillance activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Only a [[few formal surveillance programs were described]{.mark} in the
grey and scientific literature]{.underline}, and their [[descriptions
lacked detail]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since many of them involved diverse
organizations (i.e. academia, federal and/or regional governments,
non-governmental organizations, local groups, etc.), it was challenging
to delineate their frontiers, due to the lack of information provided.
This is why we decided not to list and count programs in Category C, as
done with Categories A and B which were less challenging on this matter.
The lack of geographic representation in certain Canadian Arctic and
subarctic regions could be partly due to a representation bias, as some
provinces maintain better records of activities (research compendium
available at the NT and NU) compared to other provinces or territories,
for which information on activities was more difficult to obtain.
Information on CSID surveillance activities needs to become available
and more accessible for Indigenous Peoples, decision-makers, and
researchers to inform the development of a coherent OH surveillance
strategy for CSIDs across the Canadian Arctic and subarctic regions.
There is a crucial need for guidelines for better describing
surveillance programs.

Lastly, [the stakeholders [questionnaire had a very low response
proportion,]{.mark} and most [respondents]{.mark} from provincial or
federal authorities [were not directly involved]{.mark} in surveillance
programs. This led to [limited access to information]{.mark} and a
limited depth of understanding of the programs]{.underline}. Therefore,
due to the limited access to information about programs, the
classification of monitoring activities in Table 3 may not be the most
adequate representation. Moreover, surveillance activities were
challenging to characterize: there was no official name or topic
mentioned, pathogens searched were sometimes not clearly defined, and
roles and parties involved in the surveillance were often not clearly
identified, varying over time in longitudinal projects.

Conclusion

The scientific community [widely acknowledges the [importance of
implementing and maintaining CSID surveillance in the Arctic and
subarctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Substantial investments in surveillance
programs aimed at [detecting disease emergence events]{.mark} are
[urgently needed, distinguishing newly detected diseases from emerging
diseases, establishing baseline rates for endemic diseases susceptible
to transmission]{.mark}]{.underline} in a warming North, and assessing
the effectiveness of awareness and control programs in reducing
transmission and enhancing biosecurity[. Our study highlights the [need
for improved access to information about ongoing surveillance activities
in the circumpolar region]{.mark}. In evaluating the gaps in the current
surveillance activities on CSIDs in the Canadian Arctic and subarctic
regions, there is a [critical need for a coherent, Arctic- and
subarctic-wide]{.mark}, One Health [surveillance strategy]{.mark} for
CSIDs, [co-managed by Indigenous communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
strategy requires a renewed effort in prioritizing needs and risks
associated with CSIDs in the Canadian Arctic and subarctic regions. It
aims to ensure more equitable distribution of surveillance activities
across all parts of the Canadian Arctic and subarctic regions, establish
sustainable programs over time, foster OH collaboration amongst the
involved sectors, and, last but not least, [[ensure that Indigenous
people are at the core]{.mark} of the management and design of these
CSID surveillance programs.]{.underline} An internationally harmonised
approach across the Arctic and subarctic regions for all CSIDs has the
potential to unify circumpolar surveillance efforts and ultimately
better inform public health authorities on the actions to prioritize in
the context of climate change \[18\].

[The **ability of [ICS]{.mark} to collect and share** **standardized,
uniform [laboratory and epidemiologic data on]{.mark} infectious
[diseases]{.mark} of concern [in Arctic countries]{.mark} has [already
proved valuable in]{.mark} the formulation of [prevention and control
strategies in regions with]{.mark} small but [at-risk Arctic
populations.]{.mark}** **[In 2000, ICS data were used to identify an
outbreak]{.mark} of S. pneumoniae serotype 1 invasive disease** that
occurred among young adults in 2 northern regions of Canada
(32,33).]{.underline} This investigation, together with data from Alaska
that indicated [that 78%--84% of invasive pneumococcal disease among
children \<2 years of age could be **[prevented by]{.mark} using PCV7,
resulted in the implementation of vaccine [programs]{.mark} in 3
northern regions of Canada** using both the 23-valent polysaccharide
vaccine and PCV7 in 2002. **The introduction of PCV7 in the US Arctic
(2001) and northern Canada (2002) [has resulted in a rapid decrease in
the proportion of isolates resistant to penicillin and other
antimicrobial drugs]{.mark}**,]{.underline} compared with the situation
in countries not using the vaccine (Iceland and Finland) (34). Continued
surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease [by **ICS** in these
regions will **monitor the impact and effectiveness of vaccine programs
for [preventing]{.mark} invasive pneumococcal [disease and antimicrobial
drug--resistant infections in these high-risk populations]{.mark}
(**]{.underline}34). The reemergence of invasive disease caused by Hib
in the US Arctic in 1996 following a change in conjugate vaccine type
emphasized the need for continued surveillance to monitor vaccine
impact, as well as to detect the potential emergence of disease caused
by nonvaccine serotypes. Non--Hib (serotypes a, c, d, e, f) is uncommon
as a cause of invasive disease in children; however, with the decline in
Hib disease, the importance of infections caused by other nonvaccine
serotypes has increased[. In a 6-month period of 2003, 5 cases of H.
influenzae type a (Hia) were detected in 3 infants in 1 remote region of
the US Arctic (35). Between 2000 and 2004, 72 cases of
serotype-confirmed H. influenzae infection were detected by ICS in
Alaska and Canada (36). Of these, 34 (47%) were Hia, and 22 (65%)
occurred in aboriginal people with a median age of 1.1
years]{.underline}. Hia is now the most common H. influenzae serotype
seen in the North American Arctic, with the highest rates among
indigenous children. **[[Further research is needed to determine]{.mark}
sequelae, [risk factors, outbreak potential]{.mark}, and the utility of
chemoprophylaxis for this disease.]{.underline}**

[Arctic Change and Infectious Diseases Surveillance **A common concern
among peoples of the Arctic is the rapid pace of economic change and
modernization occurring in many communities, which will [bring new
challenges to the health and well-being of Arctic
residents]{.mark}**]{.underline} (19,37). [The increasing national and
international travel by Arctic residents and increasing access to remote
communities by national and international seasonal workforce and
tourists have **[greatly increased the risk of]{.mark} importing
infectious [diseases to remote communities]{.mark}. [Climate
change]{.mark} is also predicted to [have major effects within the
Arctic (38).]{.mark} The average Arctic [temperature]{.mark} has [risen
at]{.mark} almost [twice the rate of]{.mark} that in [the rest of the
world]{.mark} in the last 2 decades and could [cause changes in the
incidence and geographic distribution of infectious diseases]{.mark}
already present [in Arctic]{.mark} regions** (]{.underline}39). For
example, an outbreak of [Vibrio parahemolyticus--related gastroenteritis
was reported in July 2004 among cruise ship passengers]{.underline} that
consumed raw, farmed oysters in the Prince William Sound area of Alaska
(≈60° north latitude), \>1,000 km further north than previous reported
outbreaks. The July-August water temperature of the oyster farm had
increased 0.21°C per year since 1997; 2004 was the first summer on
record that the mean water temperature exceeded 15°C, the threshold
temperature for the harvest of implicated oysters, which suggests that
the ocean warming trend was responsible for this outbreak (40).
[Similarly, **[higher a]{.mark}mbient [temperatures in the
Arctic]{.mark} may [result in]{.mark} an [increase in]{.mark} other
[temperature-sensitive foodborne diseases and influence the incidence of
zoonotic infectious diseases by changing the populations and range of
animal hosts and insect vectors]{.mark}. The [melting of the
permafrost]{.mark} together with an [increase in extreme weather]{.mark}
events such as flooding may [result in damage to water and waste
disposal]{.mark} systems, which may [in turn increase community
outbreaks]{.mark} of foodborne and water-borne infections. [Temperature
and humidity]{.mark} markedly [influence]{.mark} the distribution,
density, and biting [behavior of many arthropod vectors, which]{.mark}
again may [influence the incidence]{.mark} and northern [range
of]{.mark} many vector-borne [disease]{.mark}s**]{.underline} (39).
[**[These]{.mark} examples [emphasize the need for]{.mark} an
established [surveillance network in Arctic regions for monitoring
emerging climate-sensitive infectious diseases.]{.mark}** Future
Directions ICS provides a model for international surveillance of
infectious diseases and collaboration between clinical hospital and
public health references laboratories and public health centers and
institutes. The system currently provides standardized laboratory and
epidemiologic data on invasive bacterial diseases that are comparable
across borders and can be used to evaluate intervention
strategies.]{.underline} However, the system also provides an
infrastructure that can be used to monitor and respond to other emerging
infectious disease threats. Tuberculosis presents a continuing challenge
to the public health communities of the US Arctic, northern Canada,
Greenland, and the Russian Federation. The establishment of an ICS
tuberculosis working group would enhance ongoing efforts to reduce the
rates of disease in these regions by sharing knowledge, methods, and
surveillance data. Because more than half of the circumpolar region is
contained within the Russian Federation, efforts should be made to
engage and develop partnerships with public health authorities in these
regions to learn more about infectious diseases of concern, systems of
surveillance, and interests in sharing infectious disease surveillance
information.

How prepared are global health officials for a 'zombie virus'? [The

the **[relative [success against the pandemic]{.mark} in the last few
years [provides]{.mark} some sense of
[optimism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} although the unknowns are
still vast. "**[[We are much better organized today to recognize new
viruses and respond to them]{.mark} than we were even 10 and certainly
20 years ago," Dr. Schaffner said. "The World Health Organization
\[[WHO\] has a surveillance mechanism that might exist around the
world]{.mark} and is operative 365 days a year that's [constantly
sampling]{.mark} sick people, trying to [determine what viruses]{.mark}

however, said that these Arctic regions do not have the most urgent
threats to human populations. "I would contend that the jungles of the
world are still the most likely source of the next pandemic," Dr. Stoye
said. "[**However[, it is hard to prepare for a virus with unknown
properties." "Surveillance is key to a prompt response and this is where
the emphasis should lie.]{.mark} Thus the [further development]{.mark}

Rising temperatures across the Circumpolar North are catalyzing more

Gauging the Interaction Between the Frozen Earth Environment and Man
Natural and manmade impacts can instigate thaw to permafrost terrain,
with resulting changes in permafrost stability, changes in surface and
groundwater hydrology, increased carbon liberation, and increased costs
to development. CRREL has investigated these impacts since the 1940s,
with basic and applied studies benefiting government and the public. [As
a [federal government research entity]{.mark}, CRREL [has the
ability]{.mark} not only [to]{.mark} [conduct direct research]{.mark}
for unique and difficult problems **[affect]{.mark}ing any facet of
[society]{.mark}**, but also to provide project oversight as an "honest
broker," ensuring the general public's best interests are
met.]{.underline} CRREL collaborates with several universities and other
ERDC laboratories, creating strong investigative teams composed of
prominent researchers. In addition, CRREL owns and operates
un-paralleled permafrost research facilities at the Alaska Permafrost
Research Center (APRC) in Fairbanks, Alaska. The Tunnels Facility, used
for sampling and observation, is an underground excavation with over 500
feet of exposure of warm, fine-grained frozen soil and ice. The Farmers
Loop Facility is a 135-acre surface plot of boreal forest vegetated
permafrost, used primarily for testing and demonstration. Research that
Affects Citizens and States Designing robust infrastructure for
permafrost presents unique challenges to planners, managers and
engineers. These challenges range from design and repair of
thaw-affected roads, runways and buildings; to understanding how
ecosystems will be altered by climate warming. The wide-ranging impact
of these problems can create detrimental effects to large government and
industry infrastructure and also to homeowners. Recent topics of study
include Thaw-affected structure remediation Expedient non-destructive
surveys of permafrost under linear infrastructure Paleo-climate
reconstruction of late Pleistocene permafrost Impacts of fire on the
permafrost at military training lands Examples An expansion of the
Tunnel Facility at APRC was started in February of 2011, creating a new
horizontal passage 100 feet in length and parallel to the existing
tunnel. The engineering and excavation of Phase I of the New Tunnel was
performed by in-house employees and resources and culminated with the
installation of an insulated portal structure for thermal protection of
the excavation. This new facility, when complete, will expand the Old
Tunnel with over 1,000 feet of passageways, creating an enormous gallery
for static, warm permafrost studies. The Old Tunnel, excavated in the
1960s with over 500 feet of passageways, has produced more than 70 peer
reviewed articles to date on subjects ranging from permafrost and mining
engineering to paleontological studies, microbiology, and
extra-terrestrial permafrost. It is anticipated that the expanded
facility will allow for the volumetric ice and carbon studies and
provide a test bed for remote sensing studies. In preparation for an
upcoming repaving of the 10,000-foot runway at Thule Air Base,
Greenland, CRREL was tasked to investigate permafrost thaw mitigation
alternatives. [A solution was devised to end painting over four million
square feet of airfield white, which had been occurring since the late
1950s at considerable manpower and cost. Numerous [permafrost
geotechnical investigations]{.mark} have been conducted for MILCON and

Introduction

Antibiotic resistance of bacterial pathogens is an increasing public
health threat. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics is primarily
responsible for the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens.1 For
example, the cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
were identified in the United Kingdom in 1962 and in the United States
in 1968.1,2 In addition, bad sanitation in poorer countries,
displacement, tourism, medicine, lack of access to clean water, poor
hygiene, intensive trade and climate change contribute to the global
spread of resistant pathogens.3--7 The lack of infection control
programs as well as the lack of an antibiotic policy also play an
important role.

The loss of efficacy of antibiotics poses a threat to public health,
especially when it comes to the ability to treat infections.8
Antibiotics play a significant role in medicine and surgery. Many
medical advances correlate with the ability to fight infection with
antibiotics. These include joint replacements, cardiac surgery, organ
transplants, cancer treatment, and treatment of chronic diseases like
diabetes, asthma, end-stage renal disease and rheumatoid arthritis.1,7
Due to greater treatment options for bacterial infections, antibiotics
have contributed to an increase in life expectancy.9 Natural selection
allows antibiotic-resistant bacteria to spread because antibiotics do
not work against them. At the same time, antibiotics remove their
drug-sensitive competitors.10 Despite reports and warnings of overuse,
antibiotics are prescribed all over the world. It has been shown that
the indication for treatment, the choice of medication or the duration
of antibiotic therapy are incorrect in 30% to 50% of the cases.1,11 One
study found that the pathogen was only defined in 7.6% of 17,435
patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In turn,
a study by the Karolinska Institute in Sweden showed the possibility of
identifying the pathogen in 89% of CAP patients using molecular
diagnostic techniques such as PCR and semi-quantitative PCR.12 It has
also been found that 30% to 60% of the antibiotics prescribed in
intensive care units (ICUs) have been found to be unnecessary,
inappropriate, or suboptimal.11 Resistance to almost all developed
antibiotics was observed (Figure 1).

The [**antimicrobial resistance** ([AMR]{.mark})]{.underline} phenomenon
[has a [**direct impact** on]{.mark} the [welfare]{.mark} of
**humans**]{.underline} and animals, [carries a **[large economic
burden]{.mark}** due to higher treatment costs, reduced productivity due
to **[disease]{.mark}** and **[increased
mortality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.13 An estimated [4.95 million deaths
were related to AMR in 2019]{.underline}, while in the case of 1.27
million cases, AMR was the direct cause of deaths.14 If appropriate
preventive measures are not taken immediately, the number of deaths due
to antibiotic resistance in the world by 2050 could increase up to 10
million per year.15

Mechanisms of Antibiotic Resistance

In the case of bacteria, genes can be transferred by mobile genetic
elements such as plasmids or they can be inherited.10 Sub-inhibitory and
sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics can cause changes in gene
expression, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or mutagenesis, thereby
contributing to the development of resistance.16 The most common way of
acquiring antibiotic resistance by a previously sensitive bacterial cell
is through HGT. This process takes place in a mixed population of
bacteria, in which antibiotic-resistant bacterial cells come into
contact with bacterial cells that are sensitive to the antibiotic. The
most convenient sites for HGT are certain ecosystems and the digestive
tract of animals and humans. Resistance genes are passed on by
transduction during which genetic material it is transferred from
resistant bacteria to sensitive bacteria; transformation, that is,
uptake of genetic material (DNA) released by autolysis of
antibiotic-resistant cells by sensitive cells; conjugation, involving
the transfer of R (R resistance) plasmids or a fragment of the donor
chromosome.17

In the case of a biofilm, bacteria often exchange antibiotic resistance
genes, which can be encoded in mobile genetic elements (MGEs),
transposons, integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) or
bacteriophages.18 It is also worth paying attention to the processes
related to membrane vesicles (MVs), which constitute a reservoir of DNA
in water environments.19 MV has been reported to contribute to the
development of biofilm in, for example, H. pylori and V. cholerae.20,21
The important fact is that MVs can contain and transport biomolecules
such as DNA, RNA, proteins or metabolites that can be involved in gene
transfer, cell communication and nutrient acquisition. Interestingly and
importantly, the DNA and proteins carried by MV show resistance to
nucleases and proteinases that would normally degrade these
substrates.22

Acar and Moulin23 share acquisition mechanisms by antibiotic-resistant
bacteria into six categories:

1\. efflux pumps which prevents achievement by the antibiotic of its
target, that is, the site of damage function of the bacterial cell,

2\. reduced bacterial cell membrane permeability, which occurs when
modifications are made to its composition and function,

3\. inactivation of the antibiotic by enzymes produced by bacteria; they
can alter the antibiotic inside or outside the bacterial cell, rendering
it uninhibited by its antibacterial effect,

4\. reduction of the target substrate an antibiotic, which lowers
antibiotic affinity,

5\. the presence of a mixed population of sensitive and resistant
bacteria at the concentration of the antibiotic selecting resistant
cells,

6\. mutations in bacteria with the following selection by
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

In recent years, an aspect of bacterial epigenetics has appeared more
and more often, which may have an impact on the spread of antibiotic
resistance. Methylation of adenines and cytosines can alter the genetic
structure and affect the mutation rate in the bacterial genomes, thus
modulating antibiotic sensitivity.24 As evidence for the connection of
epigenetic mechanisms with bacterial resistance to antibiotics, the
following was indicated: adaptive resistance, phase variation (DNA
inversion, methylation/demethylation of gene promoters or other
regulatory sequences, transposition and slipped-strand mispairing),
heteroresistance, phenotypic heterogeneity and the resulting bistability
(impact on formation of persister cells).24--32 More research is needed
on the role of bacterial epigenetics, especially as epigenetic
modifications of bacterial genomes constitute new diagnostic markers as
well as new drug targets. Ghosh et al24 indicate that we need precise
mapping of epigenetic tags on bacterial genomes and their functional
analysis. Bacterial epigenetics is discussed in more detail in Ghosh et
al's24 review.

Antibiotic Resistance in the Polar Regions

[[**Antibiotic resistance gen**es]{.mark} have been [observed at both
the **North** ]{.mark}]{.underline}and South
[[**Poles**.]{.underline}]{.mark} For this reason, [[studying]{.mark}
remote natural [environments]{.mark} that have minimal anthropogenic
contribution may be [beneficial in following the **evolution of
antibiotic resistance**]{.mark}, as well as allowing us to [understand
the origins of **ARGs beyond clinical**
condition]{.mark}s.]{.underline}33--35 The [[transfer of bacteria
containing resistance genes]{.mark} to isolated regions where endemic
microorganisms live may be mediated, for example, [by]{.mark}
[**anthropic activity** or **bird**
**migration**]{.mark}.]{.underline}35 [In E. coli isolates from **Arctic
birds**]{.underline} (Western sandpiper, Vega/Glaucous gull,
Emperor/Brent goose, Iceland/Glaucous gull), resistance to 14 drugs
(including ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol,
tetracycline or fosfomycin) was detected.36 In a study of the Arctic
Tern (Sterna paradisaea), which migrates long distances along the
Atlantic Ocean, the highest ARBs were observed for β-lactam and
quinolone antibiotics.37 [**[Resistance phenotypes]{.mark}** such as
vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and broad-spectrum
beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (ESBL) **[have been
isolated]{.mark}** from bright gulls, which breed [in **the
Arctic**]{.mark}, but are also regular visitors to urban areas such as
urban landfills and sewage near human habitats]{.underline}.38 In
Admiralty Bay in the area of Palmer Station, Miller et al39 isolated
from seawater samples and penguin faeces bacteria that showed multi-drug
resistance to five common antibiotics such as tetracycline, kanamycin,
ampicillin, nalidixic acid and streptomycin. It has also been shown that
some wild reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) in the Svalbard
archipelago (Arctic) carry E. coli resistant to antimicrobial agents.40

Tam et al,41 while examining lakes in Antarctica, found in isolates
(inter alia Arthrobacter spp., Bacillus spp., Flavobacterium spp.,
Pseudomonas spp., Rhodococcus spp., Sphingomonas spp.) [resistance to 10
or more antibiotics in 26 strains of selected bacteria, and in 43
strains resistance to at least 3 antibiotics.]{.underline}

Until recently, it was believed that the anthropogenic influence in the
polar regions was negligible. However, the development of tourism, [the
**[growing number of inhabitants]{.mark}** as well as the number of
researchers **[in the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}and
Antarctic may carry the [[risk of introducing **alien**
**microbes**]{.mark} associated with humans [with **unknown
consequences**]{.mark}.]{.underline}38 Microplastics are also potential
vectors for chemical contamination, and recent discoveries show that
they can also be a carrier of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.42,43

Basically, two assumptions are suggested to explain the spread of
antibiotic resistance. The first is the release of antibiotic-resistant
exogenous bacteria into the environment through inappropriate use of
antibiotics. On the other hand, the second alternative is the
[co-selection of **[bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance
genes]{.mark}** or the [**horizontal transfer** of these genes
through]{.mark} mobile [elements]{.mark}]{.underline}, in which
environmental stress is indirectly influenced by the presence of
pollutants, the degree of salinity, temperature or the presence of heavy
metals.44 In a polluted environment, there is evidence of a direct
correlation between human activity and the spread and survival of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.45 The local Antarctic microflora is
influenced by increasing anthropic activity. However, we must bear in
mind that [antibiotic resistance is a natural phenomenon and is a common
defense mechanism of bacteria]{.underline}.46 This review describes the
current state of knowledge regarding the prevalence of antibiotic
resistance in the polar regions (Figure 2).

Antibiotic compound from Arctic Now, let's meet the brain behind this
revolutionary idea. Dr Päivi Tammela of the University of Helsinki,
Finland, and [her [team]{.mark} [have developed]{.mark} [advanced
screening assays to spot]{.mark} these antivirulence and [antibacterial
metabolites in]{.mark} actinobacteria [extracts]{.mark}]{.underline}.
They discovered a compound from the Arctic Ocean that can inhibit the
virulence of E. coli without affecting its growth. Testing antibiotic
potential from Arctic The team targeted a strain of E. coli that wreaks
havoc on children under five, causing severe diarrhea. This nasty
bacterium sticks to cells in the gut and injects destructive 'virulence
factors' into the host cell[. The team then sailed off to the Arctic
Sea, to an island called 'Svalbard,' aboard the Norwegian research
vessel 'Kronprins Haakon.' They [collected]{.mark}
[invertebrates]{.mark}, [isolated]{.mark} actinobacteria from them, and
[extracted]{.mark} [and separated]{.mark} their cells into fractions,
testing each one against the menacing E. coli. New antibiotic from
Arctic waters [Researchers]{.mark} [found]{.mark} two unknown compounds
from the strains Rhodococcus and Kocuria which showed
**[strong]{.mark}** antivirulence or [antibacterial
activity.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}"Here we show how advanced
screening assays can identify antivirulence and antibacterial
metabolites from actinobacteria extracts," said Dr Tammela. ["We
[discovered a compound]{.mark} that inhibits enteropathogenic E. coli
(EPEC) virulence without affecting its growth, and a growth-inhibiting
compound, both in actinobacteria [from the Arctic Ocean]{.mark}."
[That]{.mark} [makes]{.mark} it a promising candidate since [E.
coli]{.mark} is [less likely to evolve resistance against]{.mark} this
strain]{.underline}. Dr. Tammela and her team found that the active
compound was most likely a phospholipid, a fatty molecule crucial for
cell metabolism. Arctic and future antibiotic development [The
[discovery]{.mark} [of]{.mark} these novel [compounds]{.mark} presents a
paradigm shift in the pursuit of new antibiotics. By focusing on
antivirulence strategies rather than outright bacterial elimination,
researchers [can potentially reduce the evolutionary pressure that
drives antibiotic resistance]{.mark}. This means that [we]{.mark} might
[not only preserve existing antibiotics for longer but also ensure that
treatments can evolve]{.mark} alongside ever-adapting
bacteria]{.underline}. [As the tide of resistance continues to rise,
such innovative approaches could safeguard our arsenal of medications,
granting us additional time to explore further solutions for the looming
antibiotic crisis. **[Call to action for research]{.mark}** As we stand
on the brink of this exciting new frontier, the journey ahead demands
collaboration across various scientific disciplines. Chemists,

The Arctic tundra was once a crucial carbon sink, but has now become a
net emitter of carbon dioxide and a consistent source of methane. This
shift, identified in a study led by Woodwell Climate Research Scientist
Dr. Anna Virkkala, is likely due to rising emissions from thawing ground
and increased wildfire activity. "While we found many northern
ecosystems are still acting as carbon dioxide sinks, source regions and
fires are now canceling out much of that uptake and reversing
long-standing trends," said Dr. Anna Virkkala in a January press release
about the newly published research. This finding was supported by
Permafrost Pathways' expansion of the Arctic-boreal carbon monitoring
network and the compilation of thousands of data points from active and
historical monitoring sites. [In 2024, four new carbon flux towers were
installed across key Arctic ecosystems, including Nunavut, Canada, and
Alaska, and researchers provided technical assistance to existing towers
in Canada and Russia. The [scarcity of data on carbon emissions and
uptake from permafrost lands is a **major barrier** to fully accounting
for permafrost thaw in global carbon budgets]{.mark}. "[Having data in
these]{.mark} under-sampled [areas]{.mark} will [greatly help our
understanding of Arctic]{.mark}-boreal [carbon
cycling]{.mark}.]{.underline} Models depend on their data to represent
the full spread of conditions across the model, which is lacking," says
Dr. Kyle Arndt, who leads the Arctic Carbon Monitoring Network team for
Permafrost Pathways. " This project is unique in that it enabled us to
measure less-studied areas with the goal of filling data gaps and really
capturing the big picture. So, to install these towers in crucial
ecosystems in a relatively short time and collect that necessary data
year-round is pretty remarkable." These efforts, supported by an
international network of collaborators, have contributed to the
development of the most comprehensive database of carbon dioxide and
methane fluxes ever assembled across the permafrost region. The
Arctic-boreal carbon flux database contains roughly 23,000 monthly
observations compiled from both active monitoring sites and historical
data. Additionally, the Permafrost Pathways team is using novel methods
to map disturbances---such as wildfire and sudden ground collapse---at
high spatial resolution by leveraging commercial satellite imagery and
artificial intelligence. These events have the potential to double the
warming effect of permafrost thaw, but they have not been accounted for
in international assessments used to guide climate policy. ["We're
working with partners at Esri, the [global leaders]{.mark} in mapping
software, [to create the first-ever circumpolar map of abrupt thaw
events]{.mark}, a dramatic and important type of disturbance that can
generate high levels of carbon emissions.]{.underline} [The [tools and
data]{.mark} we develop will not only allow us to [better monitor major
disturbances]{.mark}, but also provide crucial information needed to
project these into the future," said Woodwell Climate Associate
Scientist Dr. Brendan Rogers, who co-leads the project.]{.underline}
Permafrost Pathways and collaborators are also working on improving
Arctic ecosystem models to better predict future changes in permafrost
and Arctic emissions. [Preliminary [findings **show significant thawing
of permafrost** across Alaska and western Canad]{.mark}a, [and future
research will expand]{.mark} the model's [scope to the entire

The devastating impact of [COVID]{.underline}-19 has
[highlighted]{.underline} [global]{.underline} [[vulnerabilities to
**high-consequence biological** **events**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
international community was [[woefully]{.mark} [unprepared]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} a **[pandemic]{.mark}**]{.underline} that has led to
millions of deaths and trillions of dollars in economic losses, and has
upended daily life. However, notwithstanding the severe damage caused by
[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19, it should be viewed as a warning shot.1
It [will **[not]{.mark} be [the last pandemic]{.mark}** humanity faces,
and the **[next high-consequence biological event]{.mark}** could be
as]{.underline} destructive or [[**substantially**
worse.]{.underline}]{.mark}

We **[define [global catastrophic biological
risks]{.mark}]{.underline}** (GCBRs) [as **biological events** [of
**tremendous scale**]{.mark} that [could cause **severe damage** to
**human civilization**]{.mark}]{.underline}, potentially
**[[jeopardizing its long-term survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**.2 The
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security has also developed a working
definition of GCBRs,3 and this term is part of a broader discussion
about global catastrophic risks that could arise from a variety of
sources, including nuclear war, anthropogenic climate change, and
advanced artificial intelligence that has not been sufficiently
safeguarded.4,5 [[GCBRs]{.underline}]{.mark} could be [[caused]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} a **[naturally emerging infectious disease
outbreak]{.mark}**]{.underline}, an accidental release of a pathogen, or
a deliberate attack. [Naturally emerging infectious disease
outbreaks]{.underline} that can [[**grow** into]{.mark}
**[pandemics]{.mark}**]{.underline} are [[**likely to increase in**
frequency due]{.mark} to]{.underline} urbanization, globalization, and
**[[environmental degradation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the world
faces an increasing risk of high-consequence biological events resulting
from accidental or deliberate misuse of the tools of modern bioscience
and biotechnology.6-8 Not all outbreaks or global pandemics will grow to
the scale of a GCBR as we define it in this article and as others have
defined global catastrophic risks more broadly, because the threshold
for this type of event is extremely high.

Although [COVID]{.underline}-19 does not rise to the level of a
GCBR-scale event, it has [demonstrated that a biological event can have
a **devastating global impact**]{.underline}, and it should serve as a
warning to global leaders that the world [[needs]{.underline}]{.mark}
much [**more [robust protections]{.mark}** against high-**consequence
biological** **events** that could emerge in the future and be
substantially worse.]{.underline}

In our view, human-caused biological events involving the accidental or
deliberate misuse of an engineered pathogen are more likely to lead to a
GCBR-scale event than a naturally emerging pandemic.9 Scientists have
the capacity to deliberately or inadvertently engineer pathogens that
are more virulent and transmissible than what nature creates by chance,
and the upper limit of damage that could be caused by a human-engineered
biological event is unknown.10-12 [[**Prevention**, early
**detection**]{.mark}, and **[rapid response]{.mark}** are all
[**crucial** for **guarding against GCBR**]{.mark}**-scale
events**.]{.underline} However, in this article, we focus on effective
strategies for preventing biological events that could become GCBRs,
specifically by disincentivizing development and use of biological
weapons by states and other powerful actors.

[A more [alarming pathogen]{.mark} may have already [emerged naturally
from frozen ground]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the unusually hot summer of
2016, Bacillus anthracis[, a [bacterium that lurks in soil
worldwide]{.mark} and causes anthrax, [killed 2649 reindeer in
Siberia]{.mark}. It also [sickened 36 people]{.mark}, including [a
12-year-old boy]{.mark} who [died]{.mark}.]{.underline} But linking the
outbreak and climate change is not easy, as archaeologist Alexander
Volkovitskiy from the Russian Academy of Sciences noted at an
international workshop on microbial threats in the Arctic held in 2019.
More than a century ago, anthrax outbreaks repeatedly killed Siberian
reindeer, which led the Soviet Union to begin to vaccinate the animals
in 1930. The elimination of cases led the Russian government to end the
vaccination program in 2007, which could have helped set the stage for
the 2016 outbreak.

The Ukraine war has ended outside collaborations in Siberia, which holds
much of the world's permafrost, making VEO's work in Greenland more
important. ["[Permafrost in the rest of the Arctic is a
substitute]{.mark}, and **[all studies and investments in this are
valuable]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} says Birgitta Evengård, [an
[infectious disease specialist]{.mark} at Umeå University who
[specializes in Arctic health]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The VEO team collected 360 soil samples during its visit in the summer
of 2022, concentrating on the middens, where waste sometimes reached 3
meters in height. "They're kind of hot spots," Aarestrup says. [The
group's studies to date have [found several bacteria]{.mark} from the
genus Clostridium, including ones that [cause food poisoning, **toxic
shock**, and botulism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many samples are still being
analyzed.

The researchers take precautions to avoid infection. In the field, they
wear protective gear and only visit sites where archaeologists are
already taking samples. "We cannot say that nothing is going to be
released \[from the permafrost\], but it should not be because of us,"
Aarestrup said. In the lab, the samples are studied under sterile
conditions with strict biosafety protocols.

[Claverie isn't reassured. He hopes the VEO researchers do not attempt
to revive [pathogens]{.mark} that might [have the potential to cause
outbreaks in humans]{.mark}. Claverie says he chose to [focus]{.mark}
[on viruses]{.mark} that infect amoebae [for safety reasons]{.mark},
"thinking that 2 billion years of diverging evolution is a much better
barrier [against human accidental infection]{.mark} than the walls and
safety protocols."]{.underline} Aarestrup and Koopmans note that they
chemically treat samples to kill any organisms before studying them. "We
are collecting a relatively small number of samples, by people who
understand possible risks," Koopmans says.

[There are also worries that [permafrost pathogens could infect
livestock]{.mark}---and then [spill over into
humans]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Norse brought sheep when they settled
the island around 1000 C.E., but both the animals and the Norse were
gone by 1450. "With climate change, Greenland expects to start having
sheep farming again," Aarestrup says. ["As a vet, this is something that
you immediately start getting concerned about because this potentially
is bringing a completely immune-naïve population of animals into an
area."]{.underline}

For over a decade, scientists known that bacteria and viruses frozen in
the Arctic could still have the potential to infect living organisms. In
2014, scientists isolated viruses from the Siberian permafrost and
showed they could still infect living cells despite being frozen for
thousands of years. [Similarly, in 2023, scientists successfully revived
an amoeba virus that had been frozen for 48,500 years. However, the
risks are not limited to permafrost regions, as [dormant pathogens can
also be found in large bodies of ice such as
glaciers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Last year, [scientists found [**1,700
ancient viruses** lurking deep inside a glacier in western China, most
of which have never been seen before]{.underline}]{.mark}[. The [viruses
date back as far as 41,000 years]{.mark} and have [survived three major
shifts from cold to warm climates]{.mark}. While these **[viruses are
safe]{.mark} so long [as they remain buried in the permafrost]{.mark}**,
the [big concern for climate scientists is that they may not remain that
way for long]{.mark}. [When]{.mark} ice or [permafrost]{.mark} is
disturbed or [melts]{.mark}, any [microbes]{.mark} inside [are released
into]{.mark} the [environment]{.mark} - many of which could be
dangerous.]{.underline} For example, researchers discovered an ancient
relative of African swine fever virus, [Pacmanvirus lupus was found
thawing from the 27,000-year-old intestines of frozen Siberian wolf.
**Despite having been frozen since the Middle Stone Age, this virus was
still capable of infecting and killing amoebas in the lab**. Scientists
estimate that [four sextillion]{.mark} - that\'s four followed by 21
zeros - [cells escape permafrost every year]{.mark} at current
rates.]{.underline} While researchers estimate that only one in 100
ancient pathogens could disrupt the ecosystem, the [[sheer volume of
microbes escaping makes a dangerous incident more likely]{.mark}. In
2016, for example, anthrax spores escaped from an animal carcass that
had been frozen in the Siberian permafrost for 75 years, leaving dozens
hospitalized and one child dead. Yet the **bigger risk is that the
[disease becomes established in the animal population]{.mark}**,
[where]{.mark} [increasing contact with humans]{.mark} [makes it]{.mark}
**more [likely that]{.mark} the [disease will jump into humans as a
\'zoonotic\' disease]{.mark}.**]{.underline} According to the
researchers, about three-quarters of all known human infections are
zoonotic, including those found in the Arctic. [[If]{.mark} a [zoonotic
disease emerged from]{.mark} a dormant state in the frozen
[Arctic]{.mark}, [our]{.mark} [bodies]{.mark} [might]{.mark}
[not]{.mark} [have the defences needed to fight an infection]{.mark}.
This type of infection could [lead to a particularly dangerous and
hard-to-control pandemic]{.mark}. Dr Abbas says: \'Climate change and
pollution are affecting both animal and human health---our research
looked into how these two forces are interconnected. \'[As]{.mark} the
[Arctic warms faster]{.mark} than most other parts of the world, we\'re
[seeing changes in the environment]{.mark}---like melting permafrost and
shifting ecosystems---that **could [help spread infectious diseases
between animals and people]{.mark}.\'**]{.underline} The researchers
warn that [Arctic regions are]{.mark} an [especially dangerous]{.mark}
starting point for a pandemic [since]{.mark} the **[[region has]{.mark}
so [little medical infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Health and
research services are limited]{.mark}, [meaning a disease may spread
widely before the authorities have the chance to react]{.mark}. Already,
the researchers point out that zoonotic diseases such as Hantavirus
hemorrhagic fever and the parasite Toxoplasma gondii have spread
throughout the Arctic region. However, Dr Abbas cautions that **[what is
happening in the Arctic \'doesn\'t stay in the Arctic\']{.mark}.** \'The
[environmental stressors]{.mark} we studied [have ripple effects]{.mark}
that reach far beyond the polar regions.\']{.underline}

estimated **[number of stars in the universe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

However, despite the unfathomably large number of microorganisms being
released from melting ice (including pathogens that can potentially
infect modern species), no one has been able to estimate the risk this
poses to modern ecosystems.

Biology, we calculated the ecological risks posed by the release of
unpredictable ancient viruses.

We used a software called Avida to run experiments that simulated the
release of one type of ancient pathogen into modern biological
communities.

We then [measured the impacts of this invading pathogen]{.underline} on
the diversity of modern host bacteria in thousands of simulations, and
compared these to simulations where no invasion occurred.

The [invading pathogens often survived and evolved in the simulated
modern world]{.underline}. About [3% of the time the [pathogen became
**dominant**]{.mark} in the new environment]{.underline}, in which case
they were [very [likely to cause losses to modern host
diversity]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In the [worst]{.underline}- (but still [entirely plausible]{.underline})
case scenario, [the **[invasion reduced the size of its host community
by 30%]{.mark}**]{.underline} when compared to controls.

The [risk from this small fraction of pathogens might seem
small]{.underline}, but [keep in mind these are the [results of]{.mark}
releasing just [one]{.mark} particular [pathogen]{.mark} in simulated
environments]{.underline}. With the [[sheer number of ancient microbes
being released in the real world]{.mark}, such outbreaks [represent a
**substantial danger**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[Extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** and disease

Our findings suggest [this **[unpredictable threat]{.mark}** which has
so far been confined to science fiction could become a [powerful driver
of ecological change]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While we didn't model the potential risk to humans, the fact that
["**[time-travelling]{.mark}**" [pathogens]{.mark} could become
established and severely [degrade a host community]{.mark} is already
[worrisome]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**Release of Ancient Pathogens Is Lethal**

One percent of 4 sextillion is a staggering figure. It is the enormous
number that puts forth a subtle warning to us about the potential
ecological impact of ancient viruses locked in the rapidly melting
permafrost. As our planet continues to warm, an unsightly outcome might
be lurking beneath the once-frozen landscapes --- ancient viruses, long
locked away, returning to life. [Melting permafrost in Arctic regions
could be **time portals** releasing these **microbial invaders** from
their cryogenic sleep.]{.underline} While most people would struggle to
conceive the scale of this, [the sheer number of potential viruses makes
it a matter of concern, even if the probability of one single virus
causing havoc seems infinitesimal.]{.underline} To understand the
ecological ramifications of this phenomenon, a team of international
researchers digitally simulated interactions between an ancient virus
and modern bacteria. [The study, published in PLOS Computational
Biology, paints a potential picture]{.underline} of the disruptions
these ancient parasites could cause in present-day ecosystems. Much like
other invasive species, most viral infiltration in an ecosystem would
fail. Yet [once an invader establishes itself, the **consequences can be
dire.** If an ancient virus were to find fertile grounds in our modern
biosphere, it could **wreak ecological havoc, dramatically reducing
species diversity by 32% or creating uncontrolled population
surges.**]{.underline} Moreover, the study found that [ancient viruses
not only survive in modern ecosystems **but evolve over time**, throwing
the system off-kilter.]{.underline} Moving beyond the theoretical, [the
impacts of these ancient, thawed viruses pose an essential question.
What happens when they infiltrate modern species, including us humans?
The grim reality is **that modern organisms often have minimal defenses
against these ancient microscopic predators.**]{.underline} Similar to
any other parasite, [these ancient viruses could absorb energy from
their bacterial host, leaving them weak, unable to reproduce and
eventually**, dying.**]{.underline} While the thought of ancient viruses
being released from melting permafrost might sound like a plot of a
dystopian sci-fi, [the findings of this study make it a legitimate
concern.]{.underline} The research builds a framework to assess the risk
of biological invaders from a bygone era, urging more extensive studies
to stretch the implications to human or animal populations. Yet, despite
the alarming implications of the study, the infection risk from these
emerging pathogens is currently seen as "highly improbable," a silver
lining in a potentially somber tale. The likelihood of these viruses
causing large-scale disruptions is buffered by the sparse human
population in the permafrost regions. Nonetheless, [the study and its
realistic simulations underscore **the indisputable urgency** of slowing
global heating to prevent these unforeseen, potential
threats.]{.underline} The story of [ancient viruses reawakening in the
melting permafrost is another reminder of the high-stakes gamble we are
playing with our planet.]{.underline} While [these
organisms]{.underline} pose their own unique risks, they [are just one
factor in a much larger, far more complex climate change
scenario.]{.underline} The response to this potential threat isn't all
that different from many others associated with climate change: slow our
carbon emissions, protect our delicate ecosystems, and work toward a
sustainable future. In the face of on-going climate change, the notion
of ancient pathogens escaping from melting permafrost adds a chilling
dimension to our environmental challenges. It's a stark reminder of the
intertwined fate of all life on Earth and a testimony to the saying "the
past can come back to haunt us." As the global temperature continues to
rise, [the cryptic inhabitants of our ancient world are inching closer
to the surface, possibly carrying a warning from the past.]{.underline}

The inferred [probability and frequency of their **catastrophic
repercussions** are in fact much higher than our simulations might
suggest]{.underline}. Focusing exclusively on the average effect of
invasion attempts is deceptive, even if most invasions are ultimately
unsuccessful. [What makes a difference]{.underline} to real-world
ecosystems [is]{.underline} not many near misses, but the potential of
even low-probability '[black swans' occurring that can individually
produce broad-scale, irreversible changes]{.underline} \[39\]. [Risk
does not emerge solely from the chance of the event occurring, but from
the combination of **probability and the magnitude** of the event's
potential effects]{.underline} \[40\]. From that perspective, [our
results]{.underline} are worrisome, as they [point to an actual risk
deriving from the rare events where time-travelling invasions produce
severe ecological impacts.]{.underline} Furthermore, the few successful
and/or impactful invasions observed in our simulations might be
deceiving. We simulated a single invasion attempt by a single pathogen
genotype. That is, in our experiments, the probability of incurring an
effect was related to a single invasion attempt. But, in fact, long-term
cryogenic formations in ice sheets and glaciers can host 10--100
bacteria ml-1, and there can be up to 107 cells g-1 in frozen ground and
buried soils---today, there are an estimated 4×1021 cells eluted by ice
melt from non-Antarctic glacial systems annually \[41,42[\]. Glacial
environments also host a density of virus-like-particles in the order of
millions to tens of millions per millilitre]{.underline} \[43\]. Thus,
[even if only 0.1% of attempts **precipitate substantial ecological
change in communities**, the sheer volume of exposed cells suggests that
a non-negligible ecological change boosted by ancient invaders could be
happening already]{.underline}. Additionally, [the risk of invaders to
be detrimental to modern communities in our simulations increased with
the ability of invaders to establish themselves for a long time
post-invasion]{.underline}, which, in turn, was positively associated
with the persistence and abundance of the invader in its 'first'
existence. This [makes the real-world potential ecological risk
substantial, because such pathogens with a successful past history are
also more likely to show up in the 'frozen record]{.underline}'.
Although Avida has proven to be capable of remarkable realism in
simulating evolutionary and ecological processes \[28,29,44,45\], it is
clear that there are fundamental differences between Avidian digital
worlds and our own. One important aspect is that simulation updates and
generations in Avida cannot be directly translated into a consistent
measure of time, which might cast doubt on how our experiments align
with real-world settings. In other words, how does the number of updates
in the simulations compare to the estimated number of intervening
generations in melting ice, for example? Although we cannot provide a
definitive answer to this question, we can use Fermi estimations
incorporating mutational distances between evolved Avidians and their
ancestors. We found an average of \~400 substitutions along the lineage
of the most abundant parasite to the ancestor in these runs (S7 Fig). If
we consider a single fixed mutation along Avidian lineages as equivalent
to a single substitution in Escherichia coli (a conservative assumption
in some respects, considering that mutations in Avida are much more
'functional' than single nucleotides), and use an estimated
0.0001--0.0002 mutations per generation of E. coli to scale our
observations, we can estimate that the length of our simulations roughly
correspond to \~2--4 million generations of microbial evolution. Thus,
[our invaders]{.underline} (sampled from populations in between 50,000
and 150,000 updates over a total of 250,000 updates) [could come from an
approximated equivalent of 400,000--2,400,000 bacterial
generation]{.underline}s. Considering that viable bacteria have been
recovered from \~750,000 year-old glacial ice \[46\] and that natural
microbial populations typically have long generation times, our
simulations fall within a more-than-reasonable (co)evolutionary time
frame. While our model represents the first attempt to quantify the
risks from time-travelling pathogens, it also introduces a flexible
modelling framework that could be ideally used in combination with other
artificial life systems and evolutionary simulation platforms. These
combinations would not only be able to test the validity and generality
of our findings, they could also investigate countless fundamental
[questions of future risk to biological communities from emerging
organisms. Such questions of course extend to the study of 'spatial'
biological invasions.]{.underline} Future work could investigate how and
to what extent the mechanisms regulating time-travelling invasions
differ from those dictating spatial invasions. More generally, our study
offer another concrete example on how 'digital twins' can help exploring
future, complex scenarios and test hypotheses for which we have no
empirical data \[47--49\]. Our findings corroborate the general
consensus that biological invasions are almost impossible to predict,
due to the complexity of the ecological and evolutionary factors
involved \[8\]. Specifically, our analyses revealed that multiple
variables related to features of either the invaders or the invaded
communities might have complex and contrasting effects on the potential
outcomes of an invasion. Such complexity prohibits devising a model
capable of predicting the outcome of an invasion in general terms. While
we did attempt to apply various multivariate approaches to explain
diversity loss and invader persistence as a function of variation in all
features compared in pairwise simulation outcomes, these showed only
modest predictive power. Considering that in silico communities are
ideal for this purpose because they pose no limits in the number of
variables and amount of data one could retrieve and include in a model,
our struggle suggests that accurately predicting the potential impacts
of time-travelling invasions in real-world settings might be exceedingly
challenging. Nonetheless, our results provide insights useful for
improving preparedness by identifying vulnerabilities. In particular,
they support empirical observations that diverse and dense communities
are less susceptible to invasions than depauperate ones. Indeed, [the
outcome that high pathogen diversity and abundance]{.underline} can
decrease the probability that time-travelling invaders establish in
modern [communities emphasises the importance of preserving not only
free-living species, but their pathogens and parasites as
well]{.underline} \[50,51\]. While our work focuses on the ecological
implications of time-travelling invasions at the scale of the microbial
community, [ancient pathogens are]{.underline} also [a]{.underline}
potential [threat to human health, both as **direct agents of disease**
and as potential sources of novel **zoonotic risks**]{.underline}, a
highly relevant topic in light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic
\[52,53\]. The occurrence of similar events is intrinsically
unpredictable, but modelling frameworks such as ours can offer a unique
opportunity to improve risk assessment by formally quantifying the odds
for ancient invaders to thrive in modern communities.

On [[Greenland's ice sheet]{.mark}, in the vast and frigid stretches of
snow and ice, scientists uncovered a surprising phenomenon: the
[presence of giant viruses]{.mark}]{.underline}. These microscopic
entities[, [much larger than the viruses we are
accustomed]{.underline}]{.mark} [to studying, were found living among
[microalgae in habitats previously believed to be
barren]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For the first time, researchers have [identified these [giant viruses in
Greenland's ice and snow environments]{.mark}, opening a new chapter in
our understanding of viral life and its role in polar
ecosystem]{.underline}s.

The research team, led by Laura Perini from the Department of
Environmental Sciences at Aarhus University, collected samples from
various snow and ice habitats on the Greenland Ice Sheet. These samples
were then analyzed for the presence of DNA and RNA, revealing that giant
viruses are not only present but also active in these cold, remote
conditions.

With the potential to reach up to 2.5 micrometers in size---about 125
times the size of common viruses---these giants are strikingly different
from the microscopic pathogens typically studied in laboratories.

Viruses, Algae, and Ice Melt

As the ice melts in the Arctic, it reveals a surprising interaction
between viruses and algae. The microalgae that flourish on the surface
of Greenland's glaciers are not just any organisms; they play a critical
role in the rate at which ice melts.

During warmer months, these algae bloom, darkening the ice's surface and
increasing its ability to absorb sunlight, thereby accelerating its
melt. But the newly discovered giant viruses could be nature's way of
keeping this process in check.

These viruses, while largely unexplored in icy habitats, may serve a
regulating function. Researchers suggest that the viruses might limit
the growth of algae by acting as natural controls, preventing them from
over-expanding. This regulation could play a crucial role in slowing
down the melt rate of Greenland's glaciers.

As Perini and her team discovered, the presence of these viruses in
environments rich in algae suggests that they might help to balance the
fragile ecosystem that is crucial to maintaining the ice sheet.

The Global Impact of Giant Viruses

The [discovery of these viruses on Greenland's ice sheet is more than a
simple academic finding. It has [broader implications for understanding
the way viruses affect ecosystems]{.mark},]{.underline} both in the
polar regions and globally.

The [[giant viruses are]{.mark} part of a group known as

to [infect eukaryotic cells in marine and freshwater
environments]{.mark}]{.underline}. While most research on these viruses
has focused on oceanic ecosystems, this study reveals their presence in
land-based habitats for the first time.

The implications are far-reaching. [Giant viruses may [influence the
microbial communities in these habitats]{.mark}, affecting the global
carbon cycle and even the release of greenhouse gases trapped in the
ice. The interaction between these viruses and algae could potentially
impact how carbon is stored or released from the glaciers, [influencing
climate change in ways that have not yet been fully
understood]{.mark}.]{.underline}

which lasted from about 2.6 million years ago to about 11,700 years ago.
During this period[, the Earth experienced several cycles of glacial and
interglacial periods, which affected the climate, the sea level, and the
distribution of life forms.]{.underline} The permafrost formed as a
result of the accumulation of snow and ice that did not melt during the
summer, and that preserved the organic matter and the microorganisms
that were trapped within it. [The [permafrost may contain viruses that
are up to a million years old]{.mark} and so will be [far older than our
own species]{.mark}, which is thought to have emerged about 300,000
years ago]{.underline} \[6\]. "Our immune systems may have never been in
contact with some of those microbes, and that is another worry," said
Jean-Michel Claverie, a geneticist from Aix-Marseille University who has
been studying the zombie viruses \[7[\]. The diversity of the zombie
viruses is also unknown, but [researchers have identified several
different viral strains]{.mark} from various sites [in]{.mark} Siberia
and other [regions of the Arctic.]{.mark} These viruses belong to
different families and genera,]{.underline} such as Pandoravirus,
Pithovirus, Megavirus, and Pacmanvirus, [which are [among]{.mark} [the
largest and most complex viruses]{.mark} known to science.]{.underline}
They have genomes that range from 500,000 to 2.5 million base pairs,
which is larger than some bacteria and archaea, along with some unique
morphological features, such as icosahedral or amphora-shaped capsids,
and unusual replication cycles, such as infecting the host cell nucleus
or forming viral factories in the cytoplasm. These viruses are mainly
found to infect single-celled organisms, such as amoebae, which are
abundant and diverse in the permafrost. However, some of these viruses
may also have the potential to infect multicellular organisms, such as
plants, animals, and humans. For example, researchers have detected
genomic traces of poxviruses and herpesviruses, which are well known
human pathogens, in some of the permafrost samples. In 2018, researchers
recovered microscopic nematode worms that were frozen in Siberian soil
for 42,000 years. The researchers confirmed that the animals that moved
and ate after being placed in nutrient-rich Petri dishes at 20 °C were
not contaminated samples \[8\].The infectivity of the zombie viruses is
also uncertain, [but researchers have demonstrated that **[some of them
are still able to infect host cells]{.mark}** after being frozen for
thousands of years. For example, Claverie and his team isolated [a
virus]{.mark} that was [48,500 years old]{.mark} from a permafrost
sample in Siberia, and showed that it [could still
infect]{.mark}]{.underline} an amoeba species called Acanthamoeba
castellanii[.]{.underline} This virus, named Pandoravirus yedoma, is the
oldest frozen virus to become infectious. It is older than the
30,000-year-old virus identified in Siberia in 2013, which was also
isolated by Claverie\'s team . The researchers used Acanthamoeba as a
virus bait, as it is a common host for many large viruses. They also
used strict biosafety measures to prevent contamination and spread of
the viruses to the laboratory workers and the environment which
emphasized that the viruses they isolated were only able to infect
amoebae and posed no risk to humans[. However, they warned that [other
viruses]{.mark}, currently frozen in the permafrost, [might **be able to
trigger illnesses in humans**]{.mark}. "We have to assume that something
like this could happen,"]{.underline} said Dr. Marion Koopmans, a
virologist from the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam who has been
collaborating with Claverie \[9\].To investigate the diversity and
function of these ancient viruses, a team of researchers led by Dr.
Lonnie Thompson and Dr. Matthew Sullivanfrom Ohio State University
conducted a metagenomic analysis of two ice core samples collected from
the Guliya ice cap on the Tibetan Plateau, which is located at an
altitude of 6.7 kilometers and has an estimated age of 15,000 years
\[10\]. The researchers used a combination of advanced techniques, such
as sterile drilling, decontamination, and ultra-low temperature
processing, to minimize the risk of contamination and preserve the
integrity of the samples. [The team found that the ice cores contained a
rich and diverse viral community, with 33 viral populations identified,
of which 28 were novel and had no close relatives in the public
databases \[10\].]{.underline} They then compared the viral genomes to
those of known viruses and inferred their possible hosts and functions
which allowed them to discover that the most abundant viruses in both
samples were bacteriophages that infect Methylobacterium, a genus of
bacteria that plays a key role in the methane cycle within ice. These
phages showed high similarity to those found in Methylobacterium strains
from plant and soil habitats, suggesting that they originated from
terrestrial sources and were transported to the ice cap by dust and wind
\[10\]. The researchers also found that these phages had genes that
could enhance the nutrient uptake and metabolism of their hosts,
indicating that they had a mutualistic relationship with the bacteria
which enabled them to also characterize the novel viruses and find that
they had unique features that enabled them to survive and infect cells
in extreme cold environments. These features included signatures of
genes that encode for cold-shock proteins, antifreeze proteins,
ice-nucleation proteins, and cold-adapted enzymes. It was speculated
that these viruses were adapted to the harsh conditions of the ice cap
and could infect psychrophilic (cold-loving) microorganisms. The
researchers concluded that these ancient viruses provide a valuable
window into the past atmospheric and environmental conditions, as well
as the evolutionary history of viruses[. They also warned that the
melting of the ice cap could pose a potential threat to the current
biosphere, as some of the viruses may be able to infect humans or other
animals. **[This calls for more research]{.mark} and surveillance [on
the emerging viruses from the permafrost]{.mark}, as they may have
[unpredictable consequences]{.mark}** for the global health and ecology.
The impact of the zombie viruses on human health and the environment is
not yet fully understood, but it could be significant and devastating
**and [could cause a new global medical emergency,]{.mark}** not by an
illness new to science, but by a disease from the distant
past.]{.underline} **[These viruses could [infect humans]{.mark} with
diseases [that we have no immunity or treatment
for]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as an ancient form of polio, smallpox,
or influenza \[11\]. They could also introduce new genetic elements or
resistance factors into the existing microbial populations, which could
affect their evolution and adaptation \[12[\]. This could also
[alter]{.mark} the [ecological balance]{.mark} and the biogeochemical
cycles [of the Arctic]{.mark} region, which will have global
implications. The [zombie viruses could be released]{.mark} into the
environment by various factors, such as **permafrost thawin**g,
mining[,]{.mark} drilling, construction, tourism, and
migration.]{.underline} [[Permafrost thawing is the main factor that
could expose these viruses]{.mark} to the outside world, as it is
[driven by climate change]{.mark} and affects a large area of the
Arctic. It **[not only releases the viruses, but also other
pathogens,]{.mark} such as bacteria and fungi**]{.underline}, that have
been frozen for a long time along with organic matter, such as plant and
animal remains, that decomposes and emits greenhouse gases, such as
carbon dioxide and methane, which further contribute to climate change
and permafrost thawing. Permafrost thawing also affects the physical and
chemical properties of the soil, the water, and the air, which could
affect the survival and transmission of the zombie viruses and other
microorganisms[. However it is not the only factor that could release
the zombie viruses into the environment. Human activities, such as
mining, drilling, construction, tourism, and migration, could also
disturb the permafrost and expose the zombie viruses to the outside
world.]{.underline} These activities could also [[increase the
contact]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [exposure]{.mark} of humans and animals
to the viruses and other microorganisms, which could [facilitate the
infection and the spread of the diseases]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
example, in 2016, an anthrax outbreak occurred in Siberia, killing more
than 2,300 reindeer and infecting dozens of people, including a
12-year-old boy who died \[6\]. The outbreak was linked to the thawing
of a reindeer carcass that was infected with anthrax and buried in the
permafrost for decades. The carcass was exposed by the melting of the
permafrost and the rising of the water level, and the anthrax spores
were dispersed by the wind and the water. [The outbreak was also
facilitated by the high density and the movement of the reindeer herds,
as well as the lack of vaccination and the delay in the diagnosis and
the treatment of the infected people and animals.]{.underline} The
outbreak was contained by the intervention of the authorities, who
vaccinated the reindeer and the people, and burned the carcasses and the
contaminated soil \[6\]. [This was a wake-up call for the potential
dangers of permafrost thawing and the need for preparedness and
prevention. **[The zombie viruses are a pandemic threat that needs to be
monitored, prevented, and controlled]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However,
there are many challenges and opportunities for doing so. [The
[challenges include the lack of knowledge and data]{.mark} on the zombie
viruses, their origin, diversity, infectivity, and impact; the
**[difficulty and the risk of accessing and sampling the
permafrost;]{.mark}** the ethical and legal issues of handling and
studying the zombie viruses; the [limited resources and
infrastructure]{.mark} for surveillance and response in the Arctic
region; the complexity and the [uncertainty of the environmental]{.mark}
and human [factors that influence the emergence]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[spread]{.mark} of the zombie viruses; and the social and psychological
factors that affect the perception and the behaviour of the public and
the stakeholders]{.underline} \[13[\]. Some of the opportunities that
the zombie virus research and the public health **[offer include the
advancement and the application of scientific and technological
tools]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as metagenomics, bioinformatics,
biosensors, biobanks, and vaccines, that could help to identify,
characterize, detect, preserve, and protect against the zombie viruses;
the [**[collaboration and the coordination]{.mark}** of
multidisciplinary and international teams [of researchers,
policymakers]{.mark}, health workers, and community members,
[that]{.mark} could [help to share information]{.mark}, expertise,
resources, and best practices; the development and the implementation of
policies and regulations, such as biosafety and biosecurity protocols,
risk assessment and management frameworks, and emergency preparedness
and response plans, that could help to **[ensure the safety and the
security of the zombie virus research and the public
health]{.mark}**;]{.underline} and the engagement and the education of
the public and the media, that could help to raise awareness, combat
misinformation, and promote trust and cooperation.

**[As higher temperatures begin to affect Arctic climates[,
scientists]{.mark} are [warn]{.mark}ing that [ancient viruses]{.mark}
buried deep in permafrost could [pose]{.mark} an [unprecedented threat
to humans in the form of new pandemics]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
[A **2023 study by a team that has studied viruses [in]{.mark} the
Siberian [permafrost]{.mark} identified [13 megaviruses that could
infect humans]{.mark};** one of them was 48,500 years old.]{.underline}
The study results appear in the journal Viruses. [At the forefront of
these scientists' **[concern]{.mark}s [is how]{.mark} contemporary
[human]{.mark} immune systems [would respond to]{.mark} so called
"[zombie viruses]{.mark}"** that are potentially millions of years old.
**[Given]{.mark} the potential [new shipping routes and mining
operations]{.mark} that could occur [in the Arctic]{.mark} north [as ice
melts, human exposure to these viruses could create opportunities for
infection and global spread]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "While the
literature abounds on descriptions of the rich and diverse prokaryotic
microbiomes found in permafrost, no additional report about 'live'
viruses have been published since the two original studies describing
pithovirus (in 2014) and mollivirus (in 2015)," the authors of 2023
study write. "This wrongly suggests that such occurrences are rare and
that 'zombie viruses' are not a public health threat. " How realistic is
a 'zombie virus' pandemic? [Prof. Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille
University, the geneticist who led the 2023 study and has been working
to examine viruses in Siberia since 2014, has said that he believes
**[the threat to be understudied and real]{.mark}**. While the viruses
they have studied have only shown potential to infect amoebae, it is
their view that **[the danger to human populations needs to be taken
seriously]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of
preventive medicine in the Department of Health Policy and a professor
of medicine in the Division of Infectious Diseases at the Vanderbilt
University School of Medicine in Tennessee, told Medical News Today that
while the viral potential does exist, it is conditional on specific
factors: ["I think it's rather remote, but it's there:]{.underline} You
would have to, first of all, have the virus still be able to be
resuscitated, right? And it would have to be in some fashion transmitted
to a human being. Then, of course, the virus would have to have the
inherent capacity to be transmitted readily from person to person. So
you have a series of steps, if you will, that has to take place before
that could happen." Dr. Jonathan Stoye, a retrovirus researcher at the
Francis Crick Institute in London, told MNT that [**the [viruses in the
Siberian permafrost are]{.mark} "a theoretical [risk]{.mark}.**" "To my
mind the greater threats are from **[awaking slumbering
bacteria]{.mark}, or by more indirect routes such as the [spread of
insect vectors for disease or changes in migration]{.mark} patterns of
birds [that can carry viruses around]{.mark}," Dr. Stoye said. "I
believe that viruses currently circulating in animals around the world
[should be seen an infinitely greater threat]{.mark}."**]{.underline}
What types of viruses could be lurking in the permafrost? The 2023 study
[identified **[13 different viruses of five different types:
Pandoravirus, Cedratvirus, Megavirus, and Pacmanvirus, in addition to a
new Pithovirus strain]{.underline}**]{.mark}[. Dr. Stoye said some
viruses previously isolated from permafrost are capable of infecting a
variety of microorganisms, plants and animals. "Many of these are
bacteriophages [but **the list includes at least two human pathogens,
those responsible for smallpox and
influenza,**]{.mark}**"**]{.underline} Dr. Stoye said. "By contrast,
relatively few infectious viruses have been isolated from thawed
permafrost, most likely because of an inherent instability of the viral
nucleic acids, particularly those with RNA genomes, such as influenza
virus." Dr. Schaffner explained that new viral agents are regularly
introduced to human populations with some regularity, citing Zika,
Ebola, and the recent coronavirus that led to the pandemic. But he said
that it would be difficult to predict exactly what viruses are in the
Arctic[. "**[It is possible]{.mark} that there could be viruses in
animals that are in the permafrost**," Dr. Schaffner said. "There might
be concerns that **[there would be viruses already in humans that were
captured and preserved in the permafrost --- they might have a more
ready capacity to spread from human to human]{.mark}**." "So [**we're
dealing with a whole array of unknowns**.]{.mark} Influenza, of course,
is one that as has actually been recovered, or the molecular signature
of the virus has been recovered from people who were encased in
permafrost,"]{.underline} he added.

would be much more disastrous in the case of plant, animal, or human

"viral" study,]{.underline} which has yet to be peer-reviewed. The new
research was helmed by microbiologist Jean-Marie Alempic from the French
National Centre for Scientific Research, Science Alert reported.
[According to the preliminary paper, **[global warming is
causing]{.mark} vast swaths of the [permafrost]{.mark} --- permanently

whose curiosity led her to open a box of trouble, and the type of soil

frozen virus [returning to a state where it has the potential to infect
other organisms]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This shatters the previous
record held by a 30,000-year-old virus discovered by the same team in
Siberia in 2013. The new strain is one of [**13 viruses outlined in the
study,** each of which possessed its own genome,]{.underline} Science
Alert reported. While the Pandoravirus was discovered below the bottom
of a lake in Yukechi Alas in Yakutia, Russia, others have been found
everywhere from mammoth fur to the intestines of a Siberian wolf. After
studying the live cultures, scientists found [**that [all the "zombie

the risk of ancient viral particles remaining infectious and getting

cycle as organic matter released by the thawing ice decomposes into
carbon dioxide and methane, further enhancing the greenhouse effect and
accelerating the melt. There are potentially more infectious viruses on

might only be the tip of the epidemiological iceberg as [there are

are indeed isolating live viruses from ancient permafrost, it is likely
that the even smaller, simpler mammalian viruses would also survive
frozen for eons,"]{.underline} University of California virologist Eric

Background:

A shallow active layer of soil above the [[permafrost
thaws]{.underline}]{.mark} during the summer months [which [promotes
microbial growth]{.mark} and [releases previously confined
pathogens]{.mark} which result in [bacterial epidemics]{.mark} in

[permafrost]{.mark} sources [harbor]{.mark} several antibiotic
resistance genes ([ARGs]{.mark}) which may disseminate and pose a
challenge for pharmacologists worldwide.]{.underline}

Aims:

The authors examined the potential [[association between climate
change-induced permafrost thawing]{.mark}, and the resulting [release of
antibiotic-resistant pathogens]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as the
potential impact this can have on global healthcare systems in the long
run.

Methodology:

A cursory abstract screening was done to rule out any articles that did
not have to do with viral pathogens caused by melting permafrost.
Articles that were not available in English or that our institutions
library did not have full-text access were weeded out by a secondary
screen.

Results:

A comprehensive analysis of 13 relevant studies successfully [revealed a
[wide variety]{.mark} of [bacterial]{.mark} genera]{.underline},
including Staphylococcus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., and
Achromobacter spp., [along with a [total of 1043]{.mark} antibiotic
resistance genes ([ARGs]{.mark})]{.underline}, with most pertaining to
aminoglycosides and beta-lactams, [[offering resistance]{.mark} via
diverse mechanisms]{.underline} such as efflux pumps and enzymatic
modifications, [[within the permafrost isolates]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Additionally, [mobile genetic elements ([MGEs]{.mark}) [housing]{.mark}
antibiotic resistance genes ([ARGs]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} virulence
factor genes ([VFGs]{.mark}), including plasmids and transposons,

**Rosen '21** (Yereth Rosen is a longtime Alaska journalist who

reporting. She came to Alaska in 1987 and has covered all sorts of news
and beats, but wound up focusing on climate change as it emerged as a

The [[threat]{.underline}]{.mark} from [newly [thawed
microbes]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Climate change can spread antibiotic resistance into the
Arctic]{.mark} through another way, too: [permafrost
thaw]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Microbes released by]{.mark} permafrost [thaw]{.mark} can [develop
resistanc]{.mark}e [if exposed to antibiotics]{.mark}, and they can
[spread]{.mark} the [resistance to other]{.mark} types of [activated
microbes through]{.mark} bits of DNA called
[plasmids]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the gull research shows,
[[birds]{.mark} can [carry antibiotics]{.mark} from one part of the
world to another]{.underline} --- [potentially from [agricultural
regions]{.mark} in the [south where antibiotic use is heavy]{.mark} to
thawing, non-agricultural regions in far to the north.]{.underline}

Such a "really bad scenario" requires several pieces to fall together,
starting with the birds being exposed to antibiotics and gaining
microbes that develop resistance, said Devin Drown, an assistant
professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks who is studying
permafrost and the microbes contained within it.

"Not only does that microbe have to survive the journey, it has to enter
an environment where it might not survive," said Drown, who heads a
research team that has been examining microbes in newly thawed soils in
Fairbanks and elsewhere in Alaska. "Once it's in the environment, it's
got to compete with other microbes that don't have the
antibiotic-resistant genes." Overall, he said, it's an improbable
sequence of events.

\[IMAGE OMITTED\]

Thawing permafrost, such as this collapsing bluff at Utqiagvik, at the
northern tip of Alaska, could release microbes that are antibiotic
resistant, or could develop such resistance. (Yereth Rosen)

Still, there is understandable concern about [certain **[hardy
microbes]{.mark}** like anthrax that [can be released]{.mark} from
thawing permafrost, he said. "It's probably **[very resistant]{.mark}**
to the [freeze-thaw cycle]{.mark}," he said of anthrax.]{.underline}

[[Microbes]{.mark} in permafrost [do not]{.mark} necessarily
[need]{.mark} any [introduction to]{.mark} modern [pharmaceuticals to be
resistant]{.mark} to antibiotics]{.underline}, however. Some types [of
[bacteria]{.mark} that [can]{.mark} [emerge from]{.mark} thawed
[permafrost]{.mark} are naturally [resistant]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In Canada's Yukon Territory, antibiotic resistance was found in
permafrost soil even 30,000 years old. The findings "[firmly establishes
that antibiotic [resistance genes predate our use of antibiotics]{.mark}
and offers the first direct evidence that [antibiotic resistance is an
ancient, naturally occurring phenomeno]{.mark}n widespread in the
environment]{.underline}," said the 2011 study published in the journal
Nature that described the discovery. And in Siberia, **[[resistance has
been found in permafrost bacteria even millions of years
old.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The permafrost in and around Fairbanks is a reservoir for
antibiotic-resistant microbes, according to research by Drown's group at
UAF.

Samples taken from the Fairbanks Permafrost Experiment Station, an
ice-rich site maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, [showed
that [microbes from the thawed soils are resistant to several types of
antibiotics]{.mark}]{.underline}. The findings, described in a study
published in January, [compared resistance in the genes of microbes
pulled out of plots with undisturbed, semi-disturbed and heavily
disturbed permafrost]{.underline}. The [microbes came from the active
layer, where soil that thaws and refreezes annually. In the undisturbed
areas, the active layer is less than a meter thick, while the most
disturbed permafrost at the station has an active layer that goes down
to nearly 10 meters.]{.underline}

As might be expected, microbes from the soils in the most disturbed
areas showed the most total antibiotic resistance. But even those from
the undisturbed areas had some resistance. Overall, [[91 percent of
the]{.mark} isolated microbe [genes showed]{.mark} at least partial
[resistance to at]{.mark} least [one antibiotic]{.mark}, and 45.6
percent showed at least partial resistance to multiple
antibiotics]{.underline}. The microbes' genes were [most resistant to
ampicillin, with an 82.5 percent rate]{.underline}, the study found.
They were least resistant to tetracycline, with a 2.2 percent resistance
prevalence.

"This result just confirms that in these [soils there are
[bacteria]{.mark} that [are **resistant to clinically significant
antibiotics**]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Tracee Haan, a UAF graduate
student in Drown's research team and the lead author of the study.

When considering the implications of thawing permafrost, our initial
worries are likely to turn to the major issue of methane being released
into the atmosphere and exacerbating [[global
warming]{.underline}]{.mark} or issues for local communities as the
ground and infrastructure become unstable. While this is bad enough, new
[research reveals that the potential [effects of]{.mark} permafrost
[thaw]{.mark} could also [pose serious health
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As part of the ESA--NASA Arctic Methane and Permafrost Challenge, new
research has revealed that [[rapidly thawing permafrost in the
Arctic]{.mark} has the [potential to release antibiotic-resistant
bacteria]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [undiscovered
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark} [and even radioactive waste from Cold War
nuclear reactors and submarines.]{.underline}

Permafrost, or permanently frozen land, covers around 23 million square
kilometres in the northern hemisphere. Most of the permafrost in the
Arctic is up to a million years old -- typically the deeper it is, the
older it is.

In addition to microbes, it has housed a diverse range of chemical
compounds over millennia whether through natural processes, accidents or
deliberate storage. However, with climate change causing the Arctic to
warm much faster than the rest of the world, it is estimated that up to
two-thirds of the near-surface permafrost could be lost by 2100.

Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide and
methane -- to the atmosphere, as well as causing abrupt changes to the
landscape.

However, research, published recently in Nature Climate Change, found
the implications of waning permafrost could be much more widespread --
[with [potential for the release of bacteria, unknown viruses]{.mark},
nuclear waste and radiation, and other chemicals of
concern.]{.underline}

Antibiotic resistance altering human-microbiota interactions

[Ecological [alterations of the microbiota]{.mark}]{.underline}
(dysbiosis), occasionally with clinically intestinal complications,
ranging from mild to severe, [were described from the early stages in
the use of antibiotics]{.underline} (Haenel 1961). The most important
was the selection of harmful resistant organisms. Classical examples are
enterococcal bacteremia during therapy with third-generation
cephalosporins, or more recently the potentially lethal pseudomembranous
colitis resulting from the selection of Clostridium difficile (Smits et
al. 2016) frequently associated with the use of broad-spectrum
antibiotics, particularly those influencing the predominant anaerobic
populations.

[Alterations of the microbiota are [generally restored by surviving
minorities]{.mark}]{.underline} and by the [organisms of the surrounding
human environment]{.underline}. In hospital, nursing homes, or in
conditions of limited sanitation in low-income countries, particularly
involving water environments (Baquero et al. 2008), restoration might
involve the [acquisition of [antibiotic-resistant
populations]{.mark}]{.underline}, substituting (without the need of
antibiotic exposure) the old susceptible ones (Schwartz et al. 2020).
The final effect is that [antibiotic-resistant bacteria are increasingly
integrated as "normal members of the microbiota]{.underline}," and [the
long-[term consequences of such replacement]{.mark}s]{.underline} and
the creation of a novel microbiota architecture [remain
unknown]{.underline}. This might be harmful, influencing [[inflammatory
bowel diseases, allergies, asthma, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, neurobehavioral disorders, and eventually involving alterations
in host immunity]{.underline}]{.mark} (Zhang and Chen 2019). Note that
resistant populations (by either intrinsic or acquired antibiotic
resistance) are poorly affected (resilient) by new antibiotic exposure,
facilitating long-term colonization and host adaptation. The invasion of
food animals by antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the increasing
possibilities of human-animal microbiome coalescence (merging) might
[contribute to the evolution towards abnormal microbiomes with
unpredictable consequences]{.underline} (Baquero et al. 2019).

Antibiotic resistance modifying bacterial population biology and
evolutionary biology

Antibiotics exert multi-level selection, that is, they independently
select for particular genes, insertion sequences, integrons,
transposons, plasmids, integrative-conjugative elements, and also for
particular clones and clonal complexes within species, species, genus,
and complex microbial communities (Baquero et al. 2013). The effect
results in alterations in the relative abundance and diversity of these
evolutionary entities. [Considering that in a world without
anthropogenic antibiotics the microbial (multilevel) entities tend to
keep their historical co-evolutionary selected compositions inside their
hosts, the disturbance of such equilibrium by antimicrobial agents might
result in inadvertent risks.]{.underline} Of course[, [antibiotic
selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria implies the selection not
only of the resistance genes]{.underline}]{.mark}[, but of all the
[mobile genetic elements to which they are
associated]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact[, the release in the
environment of antibiotics, among other anthropogenic contaminants,
increases the local density of harmful antibiotic resistance genes and
also mobile genetic elements]{.underline} (Knapp et al 2010; Wright et
al. 2008; Gillings 2014). Increased density of mobile genetic elements
implies an acceleration of the bacterial evolutionary rate (Souque et
al. 2021). In other words, [[antibiotic resistance]{.mark} might
significantly increase the density of tools involved in microbial
genetic interactions, once more [with unpredictable consequences in
shaping bacterial evolutionary trajectories]{.mark} that might
[influence human and animal health]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baquero et al.
2021a, 2021b).

Antibiotic resistance and the planet microbiosphere

[[Human health]{.mark} is fully [dependent on]{.mark} the health of the
[biological systems]{.mark}]{.underline} determining the main features
of our environment. Antibiotics have historically been and are still
constantly released into the environment; it has been estimated that the
global annual production of antibiotics reaches 100--200 thousand tons,
and one billion tons have been produced since 1940 (Serwecińska 2020),
and many of them remain biologically active during extended periods of
time. Considering that antibiotics can [select antibiotic populations
with relative decreases in susceptibility]{.underline} at concentrations
of nanograms/ml, and/or interfere at such concentrations with the
semiotic network of natural antibiotics, acting as interbacterial
signaling agents (Linares et al. 2006), we can [expect an effect on the
natural microbiosphere. Possible [ecological functional
disturbances]{.mark} caused by the release of the antibiotics in the
environment [might include critical aspects for life, as oxygen
production, nitrogen transformation, methanogenesis]{.mark}, or sulfate
reduction]{.underline}. For instance, Cyanobacteria contribute with more
than 25% of oxygen production and carbon dioxide fixation in Earth.
[Cyanobacteria are susceptible to most antibiotics and contain mobile
genetic elements that might facilitate capture of antibiotic resistance,
but how this might influence fitness and physiology of these organisms
is unknown]{.underline} (Dias et al 2019; Hernando-Amado et al. 2019).
There is also an effect of environmental antibiotics on the bacterial
components of the rhizosphere, essential for nitrogen fixation and plant
health, on the biology of Protistan and protistan consumers in the soil,
as well as the microbes-nematode interactions. It is known that low
antibiotic exposure influences plant biology affecting plant
germination, biomass allocation, and diversity (Minden et al 2017). We
can also [[expect harmful effects on insect vital endosymbionts]{.mark}
(Koga et al. 2007), and probably microbe-originated cellular organelles
mitochondria and chloroplasts could evolve to antibiotic
resistance]{.underline} (Perasso 1974; Wang et al. 2015). A possible
risk is the [substitution of part of the key antibiotic-susceptible
natural species by other intrinsically [antibiotic-resistant organisms
or selected variants]{.mark}, influencing primary producers, and
potentially biogeochemical cycles in the Earth's surface systems. This
certainly will approach an apocalyptic scenario for human health, not
the one that we discussed in the first parts of this
review.]{.underline}

Final coda

Massive antibiotic industrial production, its use in humans, animals,
and agriculture, and the resulting environmental pollution certainly
influences the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, decreasing
the effectiveness of chemotherapy, and constitutes a problem in public
health that should be addressed by applying evolutionary principles
(Andersson et al. 2020). However, it is highly improbable that
antibiotic resistance could produce an apocalyptic landscape because of
failing to control infections (Servitie 2019). In this review we suggest
that other effects of antibiotics on the microbiotas and environmental
microbiosphere can produce at long-term higher risks, deserving public
awareness, by creating social norms to expand the protection of the
individual health to the protection of one health and global health
(Roca et al. 2015; Berendonk et al. 2015; Hernando-Amado et al. 2020).
[The threat of the spread of [antibiotic-resistant organisms adverts us,
once more, that the health of humans and the health of Earth]{.mark} are
closely intertwined.]{.underline}

Bacteria", 6-21-2019, https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2019.00692) //ASingh

The increasing use of antibiotics is being driven by factors such as the
aging of the population, increased occurrence of infections, and greater
prevalence of chronic diseases that require antimicrobial treatment. The
excessive and unnecessary use of antibiotics in humans has led to the
emergence of bacteria resistant to the antibiotics currently available,
as well as to the selective development of other microorganisms, hence
contributing to the widespread dissemination of resistance genes at the
environmental level. Due to this, attempts are being made to develop new
techniques to combat resistant bacteria, among them the use of strictly
lytic bacteriophage particles, CRISPR--Cas, and nanotechnology. The use
of these technologies, alone or in combination, is promising for solving
[[a problem that humanity]{.mark} faces today and [that]{.mark} could
[lead to **human extinction**:]{.mark} the domination of [pathogenic
bacteria resistant to artificial drugs]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
prospective paper discusses the potential of bacteriophage particles,
CRISPR--Cas, and nanotechnology for use in combating human (bacterial)
infections.

Bacterial Resistance

Since their discovery in 1929, antibiotics have been widely used in
human and veterinary medicine, either for treatments or in attempts to
prevent bacterial infections. The excessive use of antibiotics, whether
for prevention or treatment, has significantly increased the level of
bacterial resistance worldwide (Ali et al., 2018). The
[[associated]{.mark} numbers of [human deaths are alarming]{.mark},
[reaching 50,000 per year in the United States and Europe]{.mark}
(Simlai et al., 2016), [with an estimated 10 million deaths per
year]{.mark} by 2050, [surpassing the current deaths resulting from all
types of cancer]{.mark} (approximately 8.2 million)]{.underline} (Jansen
et al., 2018).

The first list of antibiotic-resistant pathogens was published by the
World Health Organization (WHO) in 2017. This list showed that out of
the 12 resistant pathogens, seven were noted to be resistant to
beta-lactam antibiotics. Consequently, there is renewed focus on the
production of new antibiotics, establishing a goal for future research
strategies (WHO, 2017).

The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in humans have led to the
selective emergence of bacteria resistant to the currently available
antibiotics, as well as resistant non-pathogenic microbiota, hence
leading to the generalized dissemination of resistance genes at the
environmental level (Nitsch-Osuch et al., 2016). There is greatest
concern when this phenomenon occurs with Enterococcus spp.,
Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., together given the
acronym ESKAPE, which highlights the ability of these [microorganisms to
escape the [action of antimicrobial agents]{.mark}]{.underline} (Boucher
et al., 2009).

Antimicrobial resistance has become globalized, following the first
reports of its appearance in India, with its subsequent spread to
Pakistan, the United States, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom (Rios
et al., 2016). This resistance can occur in different ways, depending on
the acquired and selective genetic changes or insertion of external
genes, which leads to previously non-existent responses. Several
mechanisms of resistance have emerged in recent times, including
alteration of the target (by a DNA gyrase), increased efflux (export of
a drug out of the microorganism), inactivation of fluoroquinolones (by
an aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferase), inhibition of the 30S ribosomal
subunit (by aminoglycosides), and protection of the target by
DNA-binding proteins (the Qnr family) (Redgrave et al., 2014; Munita and
Arias, 2016; Kapoor et al., 2017).

Some of these changes are already well known, such as alteration of the
chemical structure of antimicrobial agents (Alekshun and Levy, 2007),
decrease of the concentration of the antimicrobial at its site of action
(Gonzalez-Bello, 2017; Willers et al., 2017), changes in the target of
antimicrobial action (Sieradzki and Markiewicz, 2004), and alteration of
membrane permeability (Hao et al., 2018). There are mechanisms of
permeability reduction that do not involve porin expression, such as
changes in the cell envelope of P. aeruginosa that are associated with
resistance to polymyxin B (Falagas and Kasiakou, 2005). [In addition to
antibiotics that act on the cell wall, such as penicillins and
glycopeptides, the activities of other antimicrobials that act on the
bacterial ribosome may also decrease due to changes in their primary
target.]{.underline} This phenomenon mainly affects macrolides and
tetracyclines (Poehlsgaard and Douthwaite, 2005; Wu et al., 2005).

The presence of these mechanisms of resistance is increasingly common in
large numbers of microorganisms, due to the selective pressure exerted
by antimicrobials, leading to a natural selection that results [in the
[dominance of certain groups of resistant bacteri]{.mark}a]{.underline},
with concomitant death of sensitive microorganisms (Tello et al., 2012).

In a meta-analysis carried out by Bell et al. (2014), in which 243
studies were evaluated, it was concluded that "Increased consumption of
antibiotics may not only produce greater resistance at the individual
patient level but may also produce greater resistance at the community,
country, and regional levels, which can harm individual patients."
Another study of the same year evaluated the consumption of antibiotics
worldwide between 2000 and 2010. It was found that the consumption of
antibiotics increased by around 36%, with the countries of the BRICS
group (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) accounting for
approximately 76% of the increase (Van Boeckel et al., 2014).

Therefore, the data reflect a worrying trend regarding the treatment of
infectious diseases, since not only are these drugs being increasingly
used (Van Boeckel et al., 2014), but also their use is directly
proportional to the increase in resistance indicators (Bell et al.,
2014). In the absence of any significant discovery of new molecules for
the control of resistant microorganisms (Hogberg et al., 2010), there is
an urgent need for redefining the relationship of humans with infectious
diseases.

In summary, the problem faced in relation to bacterial resistance is a
concern that must be urgently addressed, since functional [meta-genomic
studies of soil microorganisms have revealed a wide range of genetic
determinants that confer resistance to antibiotics]{.underline}, of
which only one fraction has been described in human pathogens (Forsberg
et al., 2014).

THE CLINICAL AND [[ECONOMIC BURDEN]{.underline}]{.mark} OF [[ANTIBIOTIC
RESISTANCE]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Antibiotic-resistant infections are a substantial health and economic
burden]{.mark} to the U.S. health care system, as well as to patients
and their families]{.underline}.1 They commonly occur in hospitals, due
to the clustering of highly vulnerable patients, extensive use of
invasive procedures, and high rates of antibiotic use in this setting.1
[Nearly two million Americans per year develop HAIs, resulting in 99,000
deaths, most due to [antibacterial-resistant
pathogens]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 In 2006, [two common HAIs (sepsis and
pneumonia[) were found to be responsible for the deaths of nearly 50,000
Americans and cost the U.S. health care system more than \$8
billio]{.mark}n.]{.underline}1

[Antibiotic-resistant infections add considerable costs to the nation's
already overburdened health care system]{.underline}. When first-line
and then second-line antibiotic treatment options are limited or
unavailable, [health care professionals may be forced to use antibiotics
that are more toxic to the patient and frequently more
expensive]{.underline}.5,11 Even when effective treatments exist, data
show that in most cases patients with resistant infections require
significantly longer hospital stays, more doctors visits, and lengthier
recuperations and experience a higher incidence of long-term
disability.5 [The [duration of hospital stays for patients with
antibiotic-resistant infections was found to be prolonged by 6.4 to 12.7
days]{.mark}, collectively adding an [extra eight million hospital
days]{.mark}.]{.underline}1

[Estimates [regarding the medical cost per patient with an
antibiotic-resistant infection range from \$18,588 to
\$29,069]{.mark}.1]{.underline},14 [The total economic burden placed on
the U.S. economy by [antibiotic-resistant infections has been estimated
to be as high as \$20 billion]{.mark} in health care costs and [\$35
billion a year in lost productivity]{.mark}.]{.underline}1
Antibiotic-resistant infections also burden families and communities due
to lost wages and health care costs.1,15

CONCLUSION

Rapidly emerging resistant bacteria threaten the extraordinary health
benefits that have been achieved with antibiotics.14 [This [crisis is
global]{.mark}, reflecting the worldwide]{.underline} [overuse of these
drugs]{.underline} and the lack of development of new antibiotic agents
by pharmaceutical companies to address the challenge.14
[[Antibiotic-resistant infections place a substantial health and
economic burden on the U.S. health care system]{.mark} and
population.]{.underline}1 Coordinated efforts to implement new policies,
renew research efforts, and pursue steps to manage the crisis are
greatly needed.2,7 Progress in these areas, as well as new agents to
treat bacterial infections, will be discussed in Part 2 of this article.

carbon dioxide, methane's impact on climate change has been found to be
25 times greater over a 100-year period. While the [Arctic]{.mark} was

[[Climate change is an **existential risk** to **human

would]{.underline}]{.mark} either **[[annihilate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
intelligent **[[life]{.underline}]{.mark}** or permanently and
drastically curtail its potential.

Temperature rises that are now in prospect, after the Paris Agreement,
are in the range of 3--5°C. At present, the Paris Agreement voluntary
emission reduction commitments, if implemented, would result in
planetary warming of 3.4°C by 2100,30 without taking into account
"long-term" carboncycle feedbacks. With a higher climate sensitivity
figure of 4.5°C, for example, which would account for such feedbacks,
the Paris path would result in around 5°C of warming, according to a MIT
study.31 A study by Schroder Investment Management published in June
2017 found --- after taking into account indicators across a wide range
of the political, financial, energy and regulatory sectors --- the
average temperature increase implied for the Paris Agreement across all
sectors was 4.1°C.32 Yet 3°C of warming already constitutes an
existential risk. A 2007 study by two US national security think-tanks
concluded that [3°C of **warming** and a 0.5 metre sea-level rise would
**likely** [lead to]{.mark} "**outright [chaos]{.mark}**" [and]{.mark}
"**[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline} is possible", emphasising how
"massive non-linear events in the global environment [give rise to
massive **nonlinear societal events**]{.underline}".33 The Global
Challenges Foundation (GCF) explains what could happen:

"If climate change was to reach 3°C, [most of Bangladesh and Florida
would drown, while major **[coastal cities]{.mark}** --- Shanghai,
Lagos, Mumbai --- [would be **swamped**]{.mark}]{.underline}, likely
[creating large flows of **climate refugees**]{.underline}. Most regions
in [the world would see a [**significant drop** in **food
production**]{.mark} and]{.underline} increasing numbers of [**extreme
weather events**,]{.underline} whether heat waves, floods or storms.
This likely scenario for a 3°C rise does not take into account the
[considerable risk that **[self-reinforcing feedback loops]{.mark}** set
in when a certain threshold is reached, [leading to]{.mark} an **[ever
increasing]{.mark}** rise in [temperature]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Potential [[**thresholds** include]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[melting]{.underline}]{.mark} of the [[**Arctic permafrost** releasing
**methane**]{.mark}]{.underline} into the atmosphere, forest dieback
releasing the carbon currently stored in the Amazon and boreal forests,
or the melting of polar ice caps that would no longer reflect away light
and heat from the sun."34

Warming of 4°C or more could reduce the global human population by 80%
or 90%,35 and the World Bank reports "[there is **no**]{.underline}
certainty that [**adaptation** to a 4°C world]{.underline} is
**[possible]{.underline}**".36 Prof. Kevin Anderson says a [4°C future
"is **incompatible** with an organized global community, is]{.underline}
likely to be [[**beyond 'adaptation'**,]{.mark} is **devastating** to
the majority of **ecosystems**, and has a high probability of not being
stable]{.underline}".37 This is a commonly-held sentiment amongst
climate scientists. A recent study by the European Commission's Joint
Research Centre found that if the global temperature rose 4°C, then
extreme heatwaves with "apparent temperatures" peaking at over 55°C will
begin to regularly affect many densely populated parts of the world,
forcing much activity in the modern industrial world to stop.38
("Apparent temperatures" refers to the Heat Index, which quantifies the
combined effect of heat and humidity to provide people with a means of
avoiding dangerous conditions.) In 2017, one of the first research
papers to focus explicitly on existential climate risks proposed that
"mitigation goals be set in terms of climate risk category instead of a
temperature threshold", and established a "dangerous" risk category of
warming greater than 1.5°C, and a "catastrophic" category for warming of
3°C or more. The authors focussed on the impacts on the world's poorest
three billion people, on health and heat stress, and the impacts of
climate extremes on such people with limited adaptation resources. They
found that a 2°C warming "would double the land area subject to deadly
heat and expose 48% of the population (to deadly heat). A 4°C warming by
2100 would subject 47% of the land area and almost 74% of the world
population to deadly heat, which could pose existential risks to humans
and mammals alike unless massive adaptation measures are implemented."39
A 2017 survey of global catastrophic risks by the Global Challenges
Foundation found that: "In high-end \[climate\] scenarios, [[the
**scale**]{.mark} **of destruction** [is **beyond**]{.mark} our
[**capacity to model**, with a **high likelihood** of **human
civilization** coming to an **end**]{.mark}]{.underline}."40 84% of 8000
people in eight countries surveyed for the Foundation considered climate
change **[[a "global catastrophic risk]{.underline}]{.mark}**".41
[Existential risk]{.underline} may [arise from a **fast rate of**
**system change**, since the capacity to adapt,]{.underline} in both the
natural and human worlds, [is **inversely proportional** to the **pace
of change**]{.underline}, amongst other factors. In 2004, researchers
reported on the rate of warming as a driver of extinction.42 Given we
are now on a 3--5°C warming path this century, their findings are
instructive:

• If the rate of change is 0.3°C per decade (3°C per century), 15% of
ecosystems will not be able to adapt.

• If the rate should exceed 0.4°C per decade, [[**all ecosystems** will
be **quickly destroyed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, opportunistic species
will dominate, and [the breakdown of biological material will lead to
**even greater emissions**]{.underline} of CO2.

At 4°C of warming "[[the **limits for adaptation**]{.mark} for natural
systems [would]{.mark} largely [be **exceeded**]{.mark} throughout the
worl]{.underline}d".43 [**[Ecological breakdown]{.mark}** of this scale
[would **ensure** an **existential human crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
By slow degrees, these existential risks are being recognised. In May
2018, an inquiry by the Australian Senate into national security and
global warming recognised "climate change as a current and existential
national security risk... defined as 'one that threatens the premature
extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and
drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future
development'".44 In April 2018, the Intelligence on European Pensions
and Institutional Investment think-tank warned business leaders that
"climate change is an existential risk whose elimination must become a
corporate objective".45 However the most recent IPCC Assessment Report
did not consider the issue. Whilst the term "risk management" appears in
the 2014 IPCC Synthesis Report fourteen times, the terms "existential"
and "catastrophic" do not appear.

Existential risks require a particular approach to risk management. They
are not amenable to the reactive (learn from failure) approach of
conventional risk management, and we cannot necessarily rely on the
institutions, moral norms, or social attitudes developed from our
experience with managing other sorts of risks. Because the consequences
are so severe --- perhaps **[[the end of global human
civilisation]{.underline}]{.mark}** as we know it --- "even for an
honest, truth-seeking, and well-intentioned investigator it is difficult
to think and act rationally in regard to... existential risks".

[The risk of global societal collapse or human extinction has been
"dangerously underexplored", climate scientists have warned in an
analysis. They call such a catastrophe the "[climate endgame]{.mark}".
Though it had a small chance of occurring, given the uncertainties in
future emissions and the climate system, cataclysmic scenarios could not
be ruled out, they said. "Facing a future of accelerating climate change
while blind to worst-case scenarios is naive risk management at best and
fatally foolish at worst," the scientists said, adding that there were
"ample reasons" to suspect **[global heating could result in an
apocalyptic disaster.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The international team of
experts argue the world needs to start preparing for the possibility of
the climate endgame. "Analysing the mechanisms for these extreme
consequences could help galvanise action, improve resilience, and inform
policy," they said. Explorations in the 1980s of the nuclear winter that
would follow a nuclear war spurred public concern and disarmament
efforts, the researchers said. The analysis proposes a research agenda,
including what they call the "four horsemen" of the climate endgame:
famine, extreme weather, war and disease. They also called for the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to produce a special report on
the issue. [The IPCC report on the impacts of just 1.5C of heating drove
a "groundswell of public concern", they said. "There are plenty of
reasons to believe [climate change could become catastrophic, even at
modest levels of warming]{.mark}," said Dr Luke Kemp at the University
of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, who led the
analysis. "[**Climate change has played a role in every mass extinction
event**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[It has helped fell empires and shaped
history]{.mark}. "Paths to disaster are not limited to the direct
impacts of high temperatures, such as extreme weather events. [Knock-on
effects]{.mark} such as financial crises, conflict and new disease
outbreaks could [trigger other calamities]{.mark}." The analysis is
published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
and was reviewed by a dozen scientists. It argues that the [consequences
of global heating]{.mark} beyond 3C [have been underexamined]{.mark},
with few quantitative estimates of the total impacts. "We know least
about the scenarios that matter most," Kemp said.]{.underline} A
thorough risk assessment would consider how risks spread, interacted and
amplified, but had not been attempted, the scientists said. "Yet this is
how risk unfolds in the real world," they said. "For example, a cyclone
destroys electrical infrastructure, leaving a population vulnerable to
an ensuing deadly heatwave." The Covid pandemic underlined the need to
examine rare but high-impact global risks, they added. Particularly
concerning are tipping points, where a small rise in global temperature
results in a big change in the climate, such as huge carbon emissions
from an Amazon rainforest suffering major droughts and fires.
[**[Tipping points]{.mark}** could [trigger others]{.mark} in a cascade
and some remained little studied, they said, such as the abrupt loss of
stratocumulus cloud decks that could cause an additional 8C of global
warming. The researchers warn that climate breakdown could exacerbate or
trigger other catastrophic risks, [such as international wars]{.mark} or
[infectious disease pandemics]{.mark}, and [worsen existing
vulnerabilities]{.mark} such as poverty, crop failures and lack of
water. The analysis suggests superpowers may one day fight over
geoengineering plans to reflect sunlight or the right to emit
carbon.]{.underline} "There is a striking overlap between currently
vulnerable states and future areas of extreme warming," the scientists
said. ["If current political fragility does not improve significantly in
the coming decades, then a belt of instability with potentially serious
ramifications could occur." There were further good reasons to be
concerned about the potential of a global climate catastrophe, the
scientists said: "There are warnings from history. [Climate
change]{.mark} [has played a role in]{.mark} the collapse or
transformation of numerous previous societies and in [each of the five
mass **extinction** events in Earth's history]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Published in the journal Science in December 2024, Urban's latest
meta-analysis of 485 studies, comprising over 5 million projections,
finds that **[[if global temperatures rise]{.underline}]{.mark}** by 1.5
degrees Celsius or more, as many as one-third of **[[species across the
globe]{.underline}]{.mark}** will be
**[[threatened]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

"Whereas past **[[assessments indicate]{.underline}]{.mark}**d high
uncertainties, this analysis suggests **[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}**
increasing **[[certainty]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}** has caused and **[[will cause global
extinctions]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Urban says. "Climate change results
in an accelerating risk of global extinction, rising from 2% currently
to 30% **[[under]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[high]{.underline}]{.mark}**est-**[[emission
scenario.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

"**[[Current policies and actions]{.underline}]{.mark}** place the world
on a path to a 2.8 degrees Celsius **[[rise]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
**[[global temperature]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which would still result
in 5% of species being at risk. This study presents a choice for
decisionmakers: Will we curb emissions now and only need to protect 2%
of species at risk, or will we choose another path that will
fundamentally alter the nature of our world?"

[Urban first performed a meta-analysis of climate change extinction
studies in
2015](https://today.uconn.edu/2015/04/regions-at-greatest-risk-for-species-extinction-the-least-studied-embargoed/),
finding then that the situation was dire. At the time, Urban warned that
**[[if current climate policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** were **[[not
modified]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rising **[[global temperatures would
threaten]{.underline}]{.mark}** up to one in six
**[[species]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Driven by "an explosion of new studies and, frankly, my dissatisfaction
with other assessments," Urban repeated his analysis.

"My **[[goal]{.underline}]{.mark}** was **[[to
provide]{.underline}]{.mark}** the most up-to-date, transparent, and
comprehensive **[[assessment of]{.underline}]{.mark}** extinction risk
from **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- performing the global
**[[assessment]{.underline}]{.mark}** I thought was
**[[needed]{.underline}]{.mark}** to inform decisions about greenhouse
gas emissions," he says.

Urban has specifically studied the Arctic grayling, a fish that is
considered a keystone species in the far northern streams it inhabits,
as part of a larger quest to determine how evolutionary and community
dynamics shape species distributions and how habitat fragmentation,
reflected by changes in an organism's preferred environment, can cause
changes in them that might make them more or less susceptible to
extinction.

While Urban says he hoped to find that earlier models were exaggerated,
the results of his new meta-analysis could have a silver lining.

"At first, I was a bit disappointed, but then I realized an outcome that
was both consistent and more certain was exactly what was needed to
compel decisionmakers to take action to reduce emissions and increase
conservation efforts," he says.

Current actions being taken worldwide are too incremental to stem the
tide of climate change and its impacts, Urban warns. Last year's COP 29,
the United Nations' annual summit for climate change negotiations, made
"limited progress."

"We have now reached 1.5 degrees Celsius and are experiencing the
predicted impacts from **[[heat waves, floods, droughts, hurricanes, and
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**s. And every day we wait, it costs us
more to mitigate and adapt," says Urban. "Therefore, the world is at a
crucial point where actions need to be stronger than impacts.

"**[[Science]{.underline}]{.mark}** already tells us what will happen
and what needs to be done, **[[and tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological
advances have **[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark}**d us with suitable
**[[solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We just need courageous leaders to
do what needs to be done."

Foreword: What is adaptation?

For the IPCC, \"**[adaptation]{.underline}** [is a process of adjusting
to current or expected changes in climate]{.underline} [and its
consequences]{.underline}. Although [**[climate change]{.mark}** is a
**global problem**]{.underline}, its impacts are felt differently around
the world. The measures taken are often dictated by the local context so
that people adapt differently in different regions. [**[Further]{.mark}
[increases]{.mark}** in global temperature]{.underline} from 1°C today
to 1.5°C or more above pre-industrial levels would [increase the **[need
to adapt]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Stabilising warming at 1.5°C would
require less adaptation effort than at 2°C.]{.underline} Despite many
successes, **[progress is incipient]{.underline}** [in many regions and
**unevenly distributed** across the]{.underline} [globe]{.underline}.\"

Adaptation is how societies and individuals ensure their resilience,
e.g., coping with a disturbance and/or recovering from a shock. Fair
adaptation must enable all populations to preserve their means of
subsistence without seeing their living conditions deteriorate, whether
we think in terms of income, health, life expectancy, etc.

Features of a novel adaptation

Successful adaptation to current and future anthropogenic climate change
requires many conditions, which may already contradict the idea that
survival will achieve it because it has always been achieved:

[Given the speed and scale of the changes, **[tech]{.mark}**nical
**[solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, assuming the technologies are
mastered, will [**[only be effective]{.underline}**
[if]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [**certain level** of warming]{.mark} is
[not exceeded]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Adapting if the sea level rises by
only one metre is possible, provided we have the financial and
technological resources (but this is still a detail). [If we reach
**2**]{.mark} or even 3 **[metres]{.mark}**, it is already much more
complicated, if not **[impossible]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Adaptive capabilities will vary greatly]{.underline} from one
individual to another, from one company to another, [from one social
group to another, and the [implementation]{.mark} of climate risk
reduction]{.underline} [measures [depends]{.mark} largely
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} local and **[[national
contexts]{.underline}]{.mark}** (we will come back to this).

Successful adaptation can be \'enhanced by national and sub-national
action, with central governments playing an important role in
coordination, planning, prioritisation, resource allocation and
assistance\'. Anticipation is essential, despite the uncertainties, but
it is clearly not happening, even in the richest and most
technologically advanced countries.

[[In]{.mark} too [many parts of the world]{.mark}, thinking about
**[adaptation]{.mark}** [has **barely begun**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
IPCC questions the ability of the most vulnerable populations to cope
with any additional warming to 1.2°C. [This is **problematic**, as we
are **expected to exceed +1.5°C** in the 2030+ decade.]{.underline}

Finally, adaptation requires broad support in technological and
financial aid (States, local authorities, companies, etc.) and support
for behavioural changes for all stakeholders (not just citizens). It
[will **[not]{.mark} be [enough to turn on]{.mark}** the **[air
conditioning]{.mark}** or desalinate seawater if the]{.underline}
[**world warms up** by a **few more degrees**]{.underline}. It is
therefore essential to challenge the idea that adaptation is easy and
painless.

Deconstructing the adaptation

Historically, adaptation has been mainly local, through reactive
adjustments and learning, as communities learn from catastrophic events
and mistakes. [While the development of science and technology has
certainly made it possible to provide better protection]{.underline},
extreme hydro-climatic events have caused hundreds of thousands of
deaths over the centuries, either directly or through the [famines, food
shortages and economic and political unrest have
engendered]{.underline}. [Transforming societies and habitats, modifying
practices and [developing **technical solutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[has **taken centuries**]{.mark}!]{.underline}

Anthropogenic climate change is unique, both in its speed and its
magnitude. Humans have never had to adapt to such changes. This is why
saying \"humans have always adapted\" is false or at least misleading.
We may have adapted, but to what extent and at what cost?

Why talk about adaptation when we are talking about human societies?

Adaptation is a scientific concept that has been used since the 19th
century to understand the relationship between living beings and their
environment. Originating in biology, where adaptation is central to the
theory of evolution, the term was quickly adopted to study the
relationship between human beings and their environment.

Adaptation is used to criticise the influence of the environment on
humans, who, unlike other species, have freedom of choice and a capacity
to learn, which allow them to transform natural environments as no other
animal has ever been able to do. The rejection of \"ecological
determinism\", i.e. the fact that their natural environment determines
an individual, fuels the reflections of the social sciences,
particularly geography, on the status and role of human societies in
ecosystems. These debates are being revived today in the notion of the
Anthropocene.

To assert that human beings are not entirely subject to the influence of
their natural environment is to recognise that individuals and social
groups can both change and modify their environment to optimise their
resources and protect themselves from threats. Without denying the
biological evolution of the species over thousands of years, the social
sciences, therefore, emphasise what enables humans to inhabit a priori
hostile environments (deserts, high mountains, dense forests, sub-polar
zones, etc.) and which explains why two societies living in similar
climatic, hydrological and topographical conditions can be radically
different.

Adaptation accounts for the co-evolution between human societies and
their environment. Thinking in terms of adaptation makes it possible to
restore individual and collective action and reject the catastrophism
that legitimises fatalism and wait-and-see behaviour. But it also
requires considering the social, political and environmental conditions
that make this action possible and taking a good look at the timeframes
in which it takes place and the price to be paid.

What is known about the adaptation of past societies

The study of past societies shows that adaptation is a long, irregular
process made up of leaps forward and backwards. The work of
archaeologists and historians proves that the transitions on which
adaptation is based take place over several decades, if not several
centuries. For example, landscapes reveal, to those who know how to read
them, the long work of transforming environments: whether in the
Netherlands, in Flanders or on the Atlantic coast, we can see the dykes,
the drainage works and the floodgates. The design of the polders and
canals, which became wider and more regular, reflects the slow
acquisition of drainage and flood protection techniques. It took
centuries and dozens of floods for pumps to replace mills. The archives
of the local lords tell us that the fight against the sea and the
control of water came at the cost of the serfs\' drudgery.

Adaptation has required social transformations: in Flanders, for
example, the waterings associations, responsible for maintaining the
water gangs (drainage works), date from the 12th century and have left
their name in the toponymy. However, until recently, deadly events have
reminded us of the limits of this age-old adaptation. In 1953, a storm
in the North Sea caused almost 1,800 victims in the Netherlands alone.
It took almost 40 years for the Delta Plan, which was supposed to
protect the country, to be completed, and it is already necessary to
think about raising the dikes to protect the Dutch polders from rising
sea levels.

The diffusion of social and technological innovations is, therefore,
slow and heterogeneous. It excludes territories, social groups and
individuals. If it is not anticipated and supported, it has a human,
economic and social cost that can be very high. So yes, humanity has
been able to adapt to everything, but at the cost of millions of human
lives lost or sacrificed and countless material losses.

A successful adaptation in the past is no guarantee of a successful
adaptation in the future

[The ongoing climate change is so rapid that natural climate variability
alone could not be the cause]{.underline}. There is no similar example
in human history. But historical examples show the weakness of the
\"humans have always adapted\" argument. In 1815, the eruption of the
Indonesian volcano Tambora ejected huge quantities of ash, dust and
sulphurous gases into the atmosphere. Temperatures dropped sharply
across the globe, and 1816 was dubbed the \"year without summer\".
Although the winter had been mild in the northern hemisphere, frost
destroyed crops in May.

Then came the snowstorms in June, heavy rains and overcast skies with
little light. Floods increased, crops were destroyed, famine set in,
with its share of revolts, looting and unrest. In China, rice crops were
destroyed, and again, famine set in and epidemics raged. Thousands of
people were forced into exile, and many died during the journey.
Humanity did not disappear, but the deaths were counted in the
thousands, including among the richest, even if there was a high excess
of deaths among the poorest and the most physically fragile, children
and the elderly.

Unlike the men and women of that time, we have the means to anticipate
and prepare for disaster. But the longer we wait, the more we reduce our
freedom of choice, our ability to offset the costs of transition and
protect the weakest. The \"year without a summer\" shows that not all
human beings can adapt to everything and that the more rapid, brutal and
intense the change, the less possible it is to respond to it.

Multiple warnings of only +1.2°C global warming

[The problem is that the **climate** is **changing**, and it is changing
**faster than expected**.]{.underline} We are breaking record after
record of temperatures in the four corners of the world, and it is only
2021. Droughts, heatwaves, floods... warnings about the reduction of
biodiversity are multiplying, and the human and financial cost of
disasters is increasing, with its attendant individual dramas. The
climate is changing, and we know that its effects will only get worse.
Some [**parts of the world** will probably become
**uninhabitable**]{.underline} - unless we take measures whose human,
financial and environmental cost would be exorbitant, effectively
excluding most people.

Recent events should make us reflect on the phrase \'man has always
adapted\'. In less than two weeks, [Canada]{.underline}, a rich
industrialised country, [experienced a record **heatwave**]{.underline}
of 49.60°C, with the [**village** of Lytton in British Columbia almost
**90% destroyed by fire**]{.underline}. More than 400 people died as a
result of the heatwave (more on this later). All this, at only +1.2°C of
global warming.

\[IMAGE OMITTED\]\]

As we explained in our article on heatwaves, we cannot normally
attribute an extreme weather event to climate change. However, the work
of the World Weather Attribution (WWA) highlights 3 critical points:

\"Rapid climate warming is taking us into uncharted territory, with
significant consequences for health, well-being and livelihoods.\"

\"Adaptation and mitigation are urgently needed to prepare societies for
a very different future. Adaptation measures need to be much more
ambitious and take into account the increased risk of heat waves
worldwide.\"

\"Although extreme heat affects everyone, some people are even more
vulnerable, including the elderly, young children, people with medical
conditions, socially isolated individuals, the homeless, individuals
without air conditioning, and (outdoor) workers\". (Singh et al., 2019).

This last point is essential.

Even in developed countries, a changing climate kills

Canada\'s heatwave should serve as a warning for the coming decades that
even in rich, technologically advanced countries, climate extremes kill.
The deaths in British Columbia are an example of climate injustice.

While it is known that some individuals are physically more vulnerable
to heatwaves due to their age or state of health, the deaths affect the
most disadvantaged social categories, those who cannot afford to leave
the city or rush to air-conditioned hotels that are fully booked for a
week. In addition, in this region, which does not experience these
extreme temperatures, humans did not adapt housing, transport and
workplaces to the high temperatures, and the number of air-conditioned
spaces was very low. Most of the deaths were people who did not have the
physical, financial, family or social resources to cope with the extreme
temperatures.

The [scientific literature]{.underline} on disasters has shown [since
the 1960s]{.underline} that there is a **[[close correlation
between]{.mark} [inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline}** linked to age,
gender, income, education and health, [[and the **capacity to
adapt**]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether we look at the level of the
individual or the group, whether we look at the local, national or
global level. Without ambitious, proactive and anticipatory policies,
some will have the privilege of adapting, but how many will be able to
say the same?

In addition to the loss of life, we also point out that the fauna and
flora will not have time to adapt to such conditions in such a short
time. Indeed, even in Bill Gates\' wildest dreams, **[plants and
[animals do not have air conditioning]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
heatwave is said to have killed 1 billion marine animals. This is why
the IPCC and IPBES state that [climate and biodiversity are
inseparable]{.underline} and that mitigation and adaptation must form a
whole. And even if we have little regard for other living species, [our
**survival** and **well-being depend on them**]{.underline}.

An adaptation for all humanity?

As we have seen, there are great disparities in terms of possible
\'adaptation\' to climate hazards at the local level. But this is also
true at the national, and especially international, level.

[Some regions of the world will be more affected than others by
**droughts**, **sea-level rise**, **heat waves**, **cyclones**, and
**ocean acidification**]{.underline}. The increase in CO2 concentration
endangers **[[coral reefs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which could
[[**disappear** altogether]{.mark} of **[warming of
+2°C.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

A concrete example is sea level rise. About 700 million people now live
in low-lying coastal areas and are vulnerable to sea-level rise and
coastal storms. This number could reach one billion by 2050. [Rising sea
levels and storms could completely wipe out island nations]{.underline}
such as the Maldives, Seychelles, Kiribati and others. Even a rise of
just one metre, probably unavoidable today, will displace millions of
people in Florida and along the Gulf coast. [The damage will be in the
billions, as will the loss of life and property.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [sea-level rise is not uniform and varies greatly according
to location and coastline shape]{.underline}---the greater the exposure
and vulnerability, the greater the impact. For example, we explained the
consequences for the Fiji Islands. While these inhabitants are among the
soberest inhabitants of the planet, they will suffer the full force of
the excesses of other countries, and it is doubtful that the entire
population will 1) want to relocate 2) have the opportunity to do so.
Money will not \'compensate\' for the excesses, nor will it protect
everything, let alone repair it, especially as this money struggles to
come through the Green Climate Fund, even though it was foreseen in the
Paris Agreement.

Who claims that \"humans have always adapted\"?

Having deconstructed the claim that \"humans have always adapted\" and
shown that [[adaptation]{.mark} to]{.underline} current and future
[climate change [requires **rapid action**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[political]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[will and
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**, it is [interesting to understand who
is using this fallacious idea]{.underline}.

Indeed, despite the scientific community\'s warnings and the many
reports of various international organisations such as the IPCC, IPBES,
WWA, etc., the refrain is still used. The little tune persists in public
opinion. If it does not stand up to scientific scrutiny, it has a double
purpose: political and economic.

First of all, the economic interest. In a text on the said punitive
ecology, we recalled the following: \"The problem is not whether
humanity will adapt, but what efforts will be required and who will have
to pay. Indeed, some [companies]{.underline} (and people) [have more
**economic interest** in]{.underline} [perpetuating Business as Usual,
i.e., in nothing changing]{.underline}. Certainly, there are co-benefits
for many sectors in adopting [proactive adaptation]{.underline}, but
[all economic actors would have to make a radical change in their model
to do so.]{.underline} Similarly, some [**[elected officials]{.mark}**
will **[prefer to invest in other areas]{.mark}**]{.underline}, either
[because they [have to deal with **short-term social**]{.mark} [and
**economic emergencies**]{.mark}]{.underline} or out of pure electoral
interest. Investing in medium/long-term adaptation is ungrateful, as it
will be the next generation that will reap the benefits of the actions
undertaken by their predecessors.

Then comes the political interest. In the same way, with the same
short-term logic and the pursuit of Business as Usual, it is obvious
that saying \"man has always adapted\" has a reassuring, reassuring
side, thus avoiding the French to worry too much, because it is true
that finally, this climate change is not really a problem! Just like the
expression \"punitive ecology\", it is once again used by right-wing and
far-right politicians, liberals and people who think that we will find
technical solutions no matter what. So we need to buy time to fix what
can be fixed. There is no trace of a political figure on the left saying
\"man has always adapted\" in the press or on a TV set, except to
respond to a polemic. The same is true of scientists specialising in
climate issues.

The technical solution

The technical solution is \'obvious\' to cope with current and future
climate hazards. We have explained that it is not and that in addition
to being reactive and palliative, this technical adaptation has taken
decades, even centuries. [At the rate at which the Earth is warming, we
do not have centuries to prevent hundreds of millions of people from
being unable to cope with climate impacts.]{.underline}

Moreover, this technical solution is one of the 12 speeches of climate
inaction: \"no need to change, we will find a technical solution\". This
is what David Pujadas said with a smile on his set last June: \"anyway,
with the technological means we have today, we have plenty to do, no! We
were also entitled to our expression: \"Humans have always adapted.
Humanity adapted to ice ages\".

What Louis de Raguenel forgets to mention is that part of humanity
disappeared during these ice ages. Once again, a detail!

It is also essential to remember that just because we have the technical
solution does not mean it will be implemented. To do this, we need the
[**financial**, **human** and **[tech]{.mark}**nological
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which are often
[**[lacking]{.mark}**, particularly [in the **most at-risk
terr**]{.mark}**itories**]{.underline} (e.g. Madagascar and the famine,
or the Green Climate Fund, which has never been up to the task). Even
so, this technical solution must be accepted by the political and
economic players and the population. Vaccination, for example, makes it
possible to eradicate certain diseases, but without the involvement of
governments, companies and citizens, this technical solution is
impossible.

Final words

**[Adaptation]{.underline}** is important to reduce the negative impacts

Restraint and the scientific method

In the physical sciences, [the **standard** research approach---[the
scientific method---is to]{.mark} construct and [test a
**hypothesis**]{.mark} using **observations** and
**experiments**.]{.underline} The outcome is reviewed by peers, and the
results must be reproducible.

[[It is an **onerous** burden of proof]{.underline}]{.mark}, different
from expert opinion (also known as elicitation). [[What a]{.mark}n
experienced [scientist may **surmise** is going on, but cannot yet
provide]{.mark} **sufficiently** [robust evidence for, is not part
of]{.mark} scientific [literature]{.mark}. This [**uncertainty** leads
to **silence**]{.mark}]{.underline}---which can be a serious problem
when knowing what experts think may be very useful for policy makers.

One study examined a [number of past [climate research
**predictions**]{.mark} and [found]{.mark} the [scientists]{.mark} to
have been "[**conservative** in their projections of]{.mark} the
**impacts** of [**climate change**" and]{.mark} that "at least some of
the key [**attributes** of global warming ... have been
**under-predicted**]{.mark}, particularly [in **IPCC**
**assessments**]{.mark} of the physical science."]{.underline} [There
was a [**tendency** of scientists to]{.mark} "err on the side of least
**drama**," whose causes may include adherence to "the scientific norms
of **restraint**, **objectivity**, **skepticism**, **rationality**,
**dispassion**, and **moderation**," and this may cause scientists "to
[**underpredict** or **downplay** future **climate
changes**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Brysse et al. 2013).

Methodological conservatism may contribute more significantly to
scientific reticence in a discipline such as climate change, where the
physical reality is changing rapidly and delays in understanding come at
a greater cost. Long lead times in getting research to publication add
to the problem.

[[Climate models]{.mark} are a **recent** phenomenon and still [do not
account for all]{.mark} the [**relevant**
processes]{.mark}.]{.underline} A recent example is the evolving
research on the relationship between **[[Arctic
warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the destabilization of the sub-Arctic
Jet Stream atmospheric circulation, and more extreme summer climate heat
waves and floods. Climate scientist Michael Mann says "[the models are
[**underestimating**]{.mark} the [impact]{.mark} that [climate change is
**already** having on]{.mark} these [**extreme**
events]{.mark}]{.underline}," (Berwyn 2024)---and more broadly, [when it
comes to big issues such as ice sheet collapse and sea level rise, the
[IPCC reports]{.mark} "have [been overly **conservative**]{.mark}, in
substantial part because of processes that are **imperfectly**
represented in the models"]{.underline} (Berwyn 2023).

Big-picture knowledge may also be inhibited by the complex nature of the
research subject---the Earth system---which requires detailed
understanding of many specific sub-systems and research specialization.
Holistic relationships may not be given enough attention. [[Topics such
as]{.mark} system "**[tipping points]{.mark}**" and their mutually
interacting cascading effects h[ave only **recently** been given]{.mark}
much scientific **[focus]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In the face of systemic reticence, Potsdam Institute director emeritus
John Schellnhuber has emphasized thinking beyond hypothesis-driven
research: "Scientific progress is often driven from the periphery, or
occasionally, by eminent personalities whose seniority is beyond doubt.
This does not at all imply that hypotheses need not be vindicated in due
course, but [[out-of-the-box thinking is **vital** given]{.mark} the
**[unprecedented]{.mark}** climate [**risks** which]{.mark} now

Another [climate model]{.underline} shortcoming is that they [do not
take into account data on]{.underline} the
sometimes-[drastic]{.underline} [changes in the
paleoclimate]{.underline}. Such data could signicantly improve climate
models' accuracy, noted one study. e authors wrote that "Although the
latest Earth system models oer an unprecedented number of features,
fundamental uncertainties continue to cloud our view of the future."968

Scientists' blurry view of the paleoclimate means that climate models
are ill-equipped to predict future abrupt changes. As the National
Climate Assessment stated:

\[[Climate [**models**\] do **not include** all]{.mark} of the
[**processes** that]{.mark} can [contribute to feedbacks]{.mark} . . .
[**compound extreme events**,]{.mark} and abrupt and/or irreversible
changes.]{.underline} For this reason, future changes outside the range
projected by climate models cannot be ruled out . . . . Moreover, the
systematic tendency of climate models to underestimate temperature
change during warm paleoclimates suggests that climate models are more
likely to underestimate than to overestimate the amount of long-term
future change \[emphasis added\].969

[Abrupt changes arise from]{.underline} events like major volcanic
eruptions or "[tipping points]{.underline}"---irreversible transitions
triggered by rising temperatures (see Climate Monsters). [These tipping
points cause feedback that drives even greater temperature
rise]{.underline}. They include massive [methane release]{.underline}
from frozen subsea deposits called clathrates; uncontrolled [burning of
peat bogs;]{.underline} and massive release of CO2 from [decay of
thawing permafrost.]{.underline}

In cataloging such tipping points, researchers have found shortcomings
in climate models. Wrote climate physicist Sybren Drijout:

[Most climate models still don't]{.underline} even [factor in how
**vegetation** will respond to changes in climate]{.underline}
\[[which]{.underline}\] would probably [lead to more predictions of
**[land-based "tipping points]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Likewise, [[**ice
sheet**]{.mark} collapses]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[[**carbon**]{.mark} and [**methane release** from]{.mark}]{.underline}
thawing **[[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}** could also lead to abrupt
transitions but [aren't yet included in climate models]{.underline}.970

For example, [current climate models don't agree on how fast [Arctic
permafrost]{.mark} will thaw]{.underline} because they don't reproduce
such surface features as thermokarst lakes, said the 2021 IPCC report on
the physical basis of climate change.971 Vast numbers of such lakes
produced by thawing permafrost dot the Arctic.972 The IPCC report found
that "[not representing thermokarst- inducing processes in ice-rich
terrain leads to a systematic **underestimation** of the rapidity and
magnitude of permafrost thaw]{.underline}."

[When researchers did create a model that took the effects of new lake
formation]{.underline} into account, they found that by 2100 the
increased [permafrost thawing could add **millions** more **metric
tons** of methane to the atmosphere per year than other models
predicted]{.underline}.973

[Carbon [emissions from **warming soils**]{.mark}]{.underline} is
another important CO2 source [left out of climate models]{.underline}
because of high uncertainty (see Respiring Soils). In one study, when
ecologists analyzed the results of field experiments in which test plots
were artificially warmed, they calculated that [up to **50 billion
metric tons** of carbon could be released from warming soils by
2050]{.underline}. They noted that their estimates have "considerable
uncertainty," but that "the direction of the global soil carbon response
is consistent across all scenarios."974

"It's of the same order of magnitude as having an extra US on the
planet," co-author Thomas Crowther told The Washington Post. "[the
entire [**magnitude** of this feedback was **removed from**]{.mark}
several of the Earth system [models]{.mark}, the models [that inform
**\[the IPCC\]**]{.mark}]{.underline} because of its massive
uncertainty," he said.975

Scientists' models can't handle feedback

Feedback---in which change triggers more change---is a fundamental
property of such tipping points. **[Climate models fall short in taking
into account feedback mechanisms]{.underline}**, both the National
Climate Assessment and individual researchers have asserted.

One important such mechanism is carbon-cycle feedback. The carbon cycle
comprises the chemical and physical processes by which carbon is
exchanged among the atmosphere, land, ocean, and organisms. It governs
how much emitted CO2 is absorbed by the oceans and land.

[While the oceans and land currently absorb about half of emitted
CO2]{.underline}, [this absorption drops with rising global
temperature]{.underline}. Feedback arises because warming oceans and
soil can hold less CO2. And more CO2 is released by dying trees,
wildres, and thawing permafrost. is CO2 increase feeds back to trigger
higher atmospheric CO2.

Uncertainties about carbon-cycle feedback constitute a major reason why
different climate models yield different results. Such uncertainties
could mean major differences in projected warming. **[Feedbacks could
[result in]{.mark} up to [25% more]{.mark} warming []{.mark}than in IPCC
projections,]{.underline}** one study showed.976

Scientists' models can't handle multiple disasters

**[[Nor can models handle the complex interactions among]{.mark}
multiple [climate phenomena]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As climatologist
Katharine Hayhoe commented at a scientific meeting when discussing the
report the National Climate Assessment: Even though we know our [climate
models]{.underline} incorporate most of the important processes . . . we
know they [don't include all the processes that can contribute to these
vicious cycles---to these types of compound extreme events, where you
have heat and drought, or flood and heat happening at the same
time---and abrupt or irreversible changes]{.underline}. And so we
conclude that future changes outside the range projected by climate
models cannot be ruled out.977

And as the Assessment itself pointed out, [these effects "can be greater
than the sum of the parts]{.underline}."978

The future will see more multiple, simultaneous climate disasters,
concluded a research review by Camilo Mora Mora and colleagues.979 They
compiled data on such hazards as heat waves, drought, oods, storms, and
res. ey concluded that by 2100, the world could be exposed to three such
simultaneous hazards if emissions are not aggressively reduced. Some
tropical coastal areas could face up to six simultaneous hazards, they
projected. Mora told e New York Times the prospect is "like a terror
movie that is real."980

Scientists' models are dehumanized

Because climate scientists have neglected to see climate disruption as a
human problem, as discussed earlier, their models reflect this neglect.
For example, [climate models have not included the interaction between
the "Earth system" and the "Human system,]{.underline}" noted
researchers led by Safa Motesharrei. They dene the Human system as
including growth in resource use, land-use change, emissions, and
pollution.

"This makes [current models]{.underline} likely to [miss important
feedbacks in the real Earth-Human system]{.underline}, especially those
that may result in unexpected or counterintuitive outcomes," the
researchers wrote.981

Scientists' models can conflict with each other and with reality

Computer models' shortcomings can arise from their inability to reflect
the reality revealed by actual measurements.

For example, [[models]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to
[[underestimate]{.mark} how much fossil-fuel particulate emissions reach
[the]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Understanding these emissions
is important because carbon soot from burning fuels and farm waste los
high into the atmosphere and spreads worldwide, including in the Arctic.
[Such [soot]{.mark} increases atmospheric temperatures by absorbing
sunlight and]{.underline} also [[coats]{.mark} the white [Arctic
ice]{.mark} with]{.underline} a layer of [heat-absorbing
grime]{.underline}, increasing melting.

Researchers led by Yousuke Sato developed an improved model of soot's
effects that will lead to more realistic climate simulations.982
However, he said, while the new approach "reduced the underestimation,
it did not completely eliminate it."983

Researchers must also adjust their models to accommodate new field
measurements---for example, of CO2 emissions from lakes and waterways.

[[Models]{.underline}]{.mark} [currently [calculate]{.mark} such
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} indirectly [[using **physical
laws**]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, [when researchers took [actual
measurements]{.mark} of emissions]{.underline} over a reservoir, [they
found that emissions [may be up to **40% greater**]{.mark}]{.underline}
than previously believed---meaning that models miss a significant CO2
source.984

[[Models are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [deeply [inadequate in assessing
how]{.mark} **clouds** affect **global heating**]{.underline}. As the
2021 IPCC report on the physical basis of climate change put it:

Clouds and aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty to
estimates and interpretations of the Earth's changing energy budget. . .
. Climate models are incorporating more of the relevant processes than
at the time of \[the 2014 report\], but confidence in the representation
of these processes remains weak.985

Indeed, climate modeler Ellie Highwood has dubbed clouds "infernally
infuriating."986 987\
Some studies suggest that clouds cool the Earth, with their loss having
catastrophic effects. One modeling study concluded that future high CO2
levels expected over the next century could cause cooling stratocumulus
clouds to dissipate, triggering a massive 8°C heating over that caused
by greenhouse gases alone. Clouds would only reform once CO2 levels
drop, which could take centuries.988\
Such cloud-cooling assumptions are a major cause of "too hot" models
that climate scientists wrestle with how to combine with other
models.989 Wrote authors of a commentary on hot models, even if
researchers knew precisely future greenhouse gas emissions:

. . . we would still not know exactly how warm the planet would get. is
is because human-caused global warming is an enormous experiment that
has no precedent, and feedback processes, such as changes to cloud
cover, will aect the pace and magnitude of warming.990

On the other hand, other [studies suggest that **[clouds amplify global
heating]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These studies, based on actual
measurements of cloud characteristics, predict that [warming
temperatures make the Earth cloudier, triggering feedback of more
heating]{.underline}.991 992 993 994

Even given the shortcomings of global climate models, they have done
quite a good job so far of tracking the inexorable rise of global
temperatures.995 However, "past performance is no guarantee of future
results," as the standard disclaimer on nancial documents puts it.

When President Donald Trump's was re-elected in November 2024, Arctic
scientists in the U.S. began fretting about what his second term in
office would spell for climate change policy and research. Soon after he
strutted back into the Oval Office, withdrawing from the Paris Agreement
to raucous applause hours after being inaugurated, that handwringing
metastasized into existential fear. As one climate scientist posted to
Cryolist, an email listserv connecting thousands of people who research
all things frozen around the world, "[The [**cryospheric**
**community**]{.mark} in the US is [facing an **existential
threat**]{.mark} in an **unprecedented way**]{.underline}."

As an Arctic researcher, every day, I wake up to grim headlines of
[[cuts to **funding**]{.underline}]{.mark} that had [[supported research
into climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} and for and by Indigenous
Peoples and minorities. Doomscrolling can't be avoided when it enters
your inbox on a daily basis. It would be impossible -- and unethical --
to look away at this [**[critical juncture]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

The stories I read and hear remind me of the fear-stricken environment
teaching in Hong Kong a few years ago, when civil liberties were erased
by the passage of a new National Security Law in 2020 and universities
became battlegrounds. Overnight, words like "liberation" and
"revolution" were banned. Now, in the US, the phrases on the chopping
block are climate change, diversity, equity, and inclusion. One US
scientist told The Guardian that they needed to remove the phrase
"climate change" from the title of their previously awarded grant in
order to keep it.

On Thursday, I hosted an event attended at the University of Washington
aimed at fostering an Arctic research community. While the university is
a powerhouse in Arctic and polar research, its enormous size, with over
34,000 employees, can be weakness. The many institutes working on the
region, from the Applied Physics Laboratory's Polar Science Center to
the Jackson School of International Affairs' Arctic Initiative, tend to
be siloed from one another.

Almost 40 Arctic researchers at the University of Washington came to the
event. The first question that people often asked each other was: "How
have you been affected?" The mood was one of gallows humor, the kind
uttered by people who know that the end is near, so you might as well go
down laughing.

Some attendees wondered aloud where they could turn to for funding to
support their research on climate change and the Arctic. With
[**[academia]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}nited
[K]{.mark}ingdom** having [fallen off]{.mark} the deep]{.underline} end
since Brexit and [**[Europe]{.mark} [in]{.mark}** its own state of
**[turmoil]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one **[[Arctic
scientist]{.underline}]{.mark}** indicated that he might start
[[**looking** to]{.mark}]{.underline} his colleagues in
[**[China]{.mark}** for funding opportunities]{.underline}. I am certain
this is the outcome Trump has in mind for US polar science.

**[[Bulldozing]{.mark} of [US polar science bodes well for
China]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[If any country is going to come out ahead in polar science given the
**enormous** **cuts** **facing** the US research community, **it is
China**]{.underline}. Already, between 2010-2018, [[Chinese]{.mark}
scientific [publications on the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and
Antarctic **[[doubled]{.mark} in number]{.underline}**, as one study of
bibliometric data revealed. [[As America **re-enters the dark
ages**,]{.underline} [China will]{.underline}]{.mark} [likely continue
to **[outpace]{.mark}** the country]{.underline}. The irony is thick
given that the US Department of Defense noted in its 2024 Arctic
Strategy that China represents a "pacing challenge."

Last week, during a US Senate committee hearing on Greenland, Senator
Ted Cruz contended that he "is committed to ending Russian and Chinese
[[icebreaker dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}." I'm [**[not]{.mark} sure**
**how** this will [happen if]{.mark} the [country doesn't even have
**scientists**]{.mark} and **engineers** **[studying
ice]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Construction of three heavy icebreakers for
the US Coast Guard is already at least five years behind schedule and
billions of dollars into cost overruns. One waits to see when this
project's excesses will fall victim to DOGE.

I suppose Trump's firing on his first day in office Coast Guard
Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan, the first uniformed female to lead a
military branch, supposedly for paying too much attention to diversity,
equity, and inclusion, offers a harbinger of things to come to the armed
forces, which have shown increasing interest in the Arctic, climate
change, and diversity.

Just last night, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced
their intentions to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
(General Charles CQ Brown, who Trump had nominated to be the Air Force
Chief of Staff during his first term, and who was elevated to chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Biden), the chief of naval operations
(Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the first woman to serve as the highest
officer in the Navy), and the vice chief of the Air Force James Slife, a
four-star general. There is no doubt that these leaders will be replaced
with wildly unqualified Trump loyalists who still imagine the Arctic as
a lily-white, perennially frozen region.

US-Russia peace talks: What consequences for Arctic research?

While gathered around a table at the University of Washington Arctic
research networking event, I asked one colleague originally from Russia
what they thought the US-Russia "peace" talks ongoing in Saudi Arabia
might spell for Arctic research. They noted that a resolution to the war
in Ukraine under the current circumstances would prove devastating to
freedom of speech, academia, and civil society in Russia. Trump, they
said, was completely vindicating Putin. Russian news networks now show
clips from Fox TV that exonerate the Russian war criminal. Should the
war end, his grip on domestic society will only tighten. With so many of
their young men dying on the battlefield, Russians badly need and want
the fight to have been a worthy one.

US researchers might technically be able to return to Russia if
relations are "normalized." They may even be able to use their Visa and
Mastercards during their travels, because that's precisely what hundreds
of thousands of Ukrainians and Russians have died for. Priceless
sacrifices, indeed.

But my colleague emphasized that many [American
universities]{.underline} would likely still [**not permit sponsored**
travel to Russia]{.underline}, making it [**impossible** to go as part
of a funded and insured work trip.]{.underline} While Russian archives
are open, it's not [safe to access them since the Kremlin has deemed any
research]{.underline} that is even remotely critical [a danger to the
state]{.underline}. [Russian researchers]{.underline}, too, often
**[fear]{.underline}** any form of **[communication]{.underline}** with
foreigners, let alone collaboration, lest they be seen as colluding with
the enemy.

The [[**environment** for academic freedom in **Russia** is
**lethal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Researchers, journalists, and activists
face jail time for any misstep. Their counterparts in the US do not face
these sort of threats. Yet they are reckoning with loss of livelihood,
meaning, and public acceptance. This means that [[Arctic
research]{.underline}]{.mark} in not just one major Arctic state, but
two, **[[risks annihilation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

During the Cold War, nationally-scaled military, security, and economic
interests motivated a great deal of research in all of the eight Arctic
states, including the US and Russia but also Canada and the Nordic
countries, as an article led by historian Ronald Doel explains. This
trend seems to be rearing its head again.

The difference between science during the Cold War and today is that the
US and Russia are willfully ignoring and even attacking work on climate
change despite it being one of the most pressing issues facing the
region. Even the US security establishment recognizes this fact. In
2014, the Pentagon released a report noting that climate change posed
"immediate risks" to national security." In 2017, Trump's former defense
secretary James Mattis acknowledged in Senate testimony that climate
change was real and that it posed a threat to US overseas interests and
Department of Defense assets around the world. Under Trump 2.0, that
threat has somehow simply disappeared -- as have the people working on
the bête noire of the new administration.

In the month since Trump has taken office, over [[10 percent of]{.mark}
the **US [N]{.mark}ational [S]{.mark}cience [F]{.mark}oundation** has
been [fired]{.mark}]{.underline}, including "all of its experts, a class
of contract workers who are specialists in niche scientific fields,"
according to Politico. Making matters worse, the experts did not have to
be let go. Instead, NSF leaders decided to fire them in the interest of
"fairness" given that probationary workers were required to be made
redundant. In a sudden return of McCarthyism, NSF staff meetings are no
longer recorded out of fear of who might get a hold of the tapes.

Entire programs are now gone, too. The [**[entire]{.underline}**
[**staff** at]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **Human [Environment
and]{.mark}** **[Geographic Sciences]{.mark} Program**]{.underline},
which has funded research into issues such as climate change and
human-environment relations, has been shown the door. [Millions of
dollars in funding]{.underline} that was set to be awarded by the NSF in
the coming weeks to researchers who had spent countless hours refining
their [[proposals]{.underline}]{.mark} are now [likely to [**never see**
the light]{.mark} of day.]{.underline}

[[Mass firings]{.underline}]{.mark} also appear [[imminent at
the]{.underline}]{.mark} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(**[[NOAA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) now that the new Secretary of
Commerce\*, Howard Lutnick, has been sworn in.
**[[NOAA]{.underline}]{.mark}** is responsible for the nation's
[**[Arctic Research]{.mark}** Program]{.underline}, which has two
missions. The first is to [[understand]{.mark} how the [ocean]{.mark},
sea [ice]{.mark}, and [atmosphere]{.mark} are interacting
i]{.underline}n order [[to understand]{.underline}]{.mark} the impacts
of **[[climate]{.mark} [change]{.mark}]{.underline}** on ecosystems and
biological resources like fisheries. The second is to
[**[enhance]{.mark} the [science]{.mark}** that [informs]{.mark} the
country's [ability to]{.mark}]{.underline} safely
[[navigate]{.underline}]{.mark}, respond to oil spills, and advance
economic [[development]{.mark} in the **Arctic**]{.underline}. One of
NOAA's most widely known outputs is its annual Arctic Report Card, which
provides a valuable a summary of the state of affairs in the region each
autumn. Whether a report card will be issued in 2025 remains to be seen.
The [Trump administration seems fixated on [closing the

The Cold War's scientific fallout

During the Cold War, nuclear war and radiation were perceived as the
biggest threats facing humanity. In the US, the Atomic Energy Commission
became interested in ecology and radiation ecology in particular, or the
study of how the environment and organisms are affected by exposure to
radiation. Yet, as sociologist Brian Lindseth explains, the state also
wanted to make sure that they could control the research agendas of
ecologists. For their part, some ecologists thought that the point of
science was to inform political officials and policymakers. Other
ecologists felt a responsibility to oppose nuclear weapons and the
overall weaponization of technology during the Cold War. Their political
awakening broke with the scientific culture that had dominated since the
nineteenth century, which prized objectivity above all else.

In the past two decades, climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic have
forced scientists to once again reassess their positions in society. Are
they meant to be neutral middlemen who simply do their research from
their desks, labs, and field sites, communicate their findings, and then
see how the cards fall? Or should they actively insert themselves into
public debate and take stands informed by their own findings, yet
possibly at the risk of losing the authority they enjoy, which comes
from being perceived as objective?

The choice may now be moot. Under Trump, even climate scientists who
would prefer to somehow stay below the political fray cannot. The
administration has made their work by definition political. Climate
science is seen as "climate fanaticism," and the temple of worship must
be rooted out. Project 2025, the political initiative promoted by the
Heritage Foundation and dozens of conservative partners across the US
and which is serving as a playbook for the Trump administration, spells
out its goals for all to see:

Of course, science has never been neutral, and objectivity is something
of a mirage. Perhaps what is more valuable and reliable is
intersubjectivity, or when personal biases are removed through the
collective process of scientist after scientist coming to the same
observation or finding. When it comes to climate change, a study
published in 2021 found that 98.7% of climate scientists and 100% of
expert-level climate scientists agree that human activities are making
the Earth warmer. At least the "fanatics" can agree.

Trump seeks to exorcise anyone and everyone working on climate change.
Though his push has only been in the works for one month, it will leave
scars for decades to come. Many [[universities]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[are heavily [dependent on **federal**

I am delighted to introduce the Polar Institute's new initiative, the US
Polar Leadership Project. Intended to raise awareness of the
[[**importance** of **US leadership** at a **crucial**]{.mark}
**[juncture for]{.mark}**]{.underline} both [[the]{.underline}
**[Arctic]{.underline}**]{.mark} and Antarctica, USPLP will will argue
forcefully for the importance of US leadership via a multiyear program
spotlighting the [necessity and benefits of **engagement in the
poles.**]{.underline}

[The [next few years]{.mark} are [critical]{.mark}ly important
[to]{.mark} [build]{.mark} **support for [US
leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}**,** [as we [prepare for]{.mark} the
**upcoming US [Chairship of]{.mark} the** [**Arctic**

(2032-33)]{.underline}. [The [US **must be ready to**]{.mark} **meet
the** moment and [**deliver** on **strategic
priorities.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

These milestones come at a time when the polar regions are under
increasing scrutiny as loci of geopolitical pressure, whether from
environmental changes, economic interests, evolving sovereignty
considerations, or diplomatic signaling. The international agreements
and organizations that represent the polar regions, including the Arctic
Council and Antarctic Treaty System, are increasingly under pressure
from efforts to undermine the global rules-based order.

[[**Polar science** is **essential** to **understanding**]{.mark}
**global [environmental change]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [with
[consequences for **global climate**]{.mark}**,** **biodiversity** and
**human societies**.]{.underline} The [polar regions are **intimately

[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and Antarctic [[**research** is key to
**understanding change** and]{.mark} to **[developing]{.mark}**
**sound**]{.underline} domestic and foreign
[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this context, major international
science bodies have called for a fifth [[I]{.mark}nternational
[P]{.mark}olar [Y]{.mark}ear]{.underline} (IPY) in 2032-33. The IPY will
provide, according to the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC)
and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), [a [**vital
opportunity** to close]{.mark} **outstanding major [knowledge
gaps.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The [[IPY]{.underline} [will]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [**coincide**
with]{.mark} the next [US **chairship** of the **Arctic
Council**]{.mark}]{.underline} (AC), which will occur 2031-33. During
the two-year AC chairship, US agencies will be leading a suite of
activities with federal, state, Indigenous, and international partners.
In addition, the United States will be hosting a number of Arctic
Council activities. [United States [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} with
both the International Polar Year and Arctic Council Chairship [[will
require]{.mark} **significant [advance planning]{.mark}** and
[**coordination** **among** **federal

During this period, [[**US** **leadership**]{.mark} **in** the poles

[[Climate change in the Arctic]{.mark}---[and the resulting]{.mark}
diminishing sea ice, **[thawing permafrost]{.mark}**, and ice sheet
degradation---[creates]{.mark} a cascade of [difficulties]{.mark}, as
well as some new possibilities. The Arctic Council affirmed in 2021 that
the Arctic is **warming three times faster** than the rest of the.
world. Climate change is making the Arctic more accessible than ever
before, while contributing to rising global sea levels, coastal erosion,
more frequent and severe wildfires, and damaged ecosystems]{.underline}.
These consequences threaten the livelihoods of Arctic residents and the
traditional lifestyles of Alaska Native communities. [Changing fish and
wildlife migration patterns, combined with the high cost of
non-subsistence foods, have exacerbated food insecurity and made
cultural traditions more difficult to carry on. Coastal erosion,
permafrost thaw, and flooding in Alaska are **damaging infrastructure**
and will force some communities to relocate or invest heavily in
infrastructure resilience. A more accessible Arctic could also **create
new economic opportunities**.]{.underline} Low population densities over
a vast geography, high cost of doing business, and lack of financial
resources have contributed to long-standing challenges, including
limited infrastructure and a reliance on the oil and gas and commercial
fishing sectors. These constraints have, in turn, kept cost of living
high and stifled opportunities to develop other industries. Diminishing
sea ice is gradually opening new shipping routes and could spur economic
development. The Arctic's significant deposits of in-demand minerals
essential to key technology supply chains have piqued the interest of
governments and businesses across the world. As ice in the Arctic Ocean
diminishes and as fish migration patterns shift, commercial fisheries
may move into new areas. These changes could generate economic benefits
for Arctic residents if appropriately managed, in consultation with
those populations. New opportunities will also bring additional
challenges, from the potential for new illegal, unreported, and
unregulated fishing and greater environmental degradation to risks to
maritime navigation, a greater likelihood of accidents, and changes to
traditional lifestyles[. The [Arctic's growing strategic importance has
intensified competition to **shape its future** as countries pursue new
economic interests and prepare for increased activity]{.mark}. Russia
has invested significantly in its military presence in the Arctic over
the last decade. It is modernizing its military bases and airfields;
deploying new coastal and air defense missile systems and upgraded
submarines; and increasing military exercises and training operations
with a new combatant command-equivalent for the Arctic. Russia is also
developing new economic infrastructure in its Arctic territories to
develop hydrocarbons, minerals, and fisheries and is attempting to
constrain freedom of navigation through its excessive maritime claims
along the Northern Sea Route.]{.underline} Russia's war in Ukraine has
raised geopolitical tensions in the Arctic, as it has globally, creating
new risks of unintended conflict and hindering cooperation. The war has
focused Russian military attention on Ukraine, and sanctions levied
against Russia following its invasion could complicate Russia's Arctic
economic development and military modernization efforts. Russia's war in
Ukraine redoubled NATO's unity and resolve and spurred efforts to expand
NATO resourcing. It has also enhanced unity with our Arctic partners, as
evidenced by Finland and Sweden's prospective NATO accession. [The
People's Republic of China ([PRC]{.mark}) [seeks to **increase** its
influence in the Arctic through an expanded slate of economic,
diplomatic, scientific, and military activities]{.mark}. It has also
emphasized its intention to play a larger role in shaping regional
governance. Over the last decade, the [PRC has **doubled** its
investments, with a focus on critical mineral extraction; expanded its
scientific activities; and used these scientific engagements to conduct
dual-use research]{.mark}]{.underline} with intelligence or military
applications in the Arctic. The PRC has expanded its icebreaker fleet
and sent naval vessels into the Arctic for the first time. [Other
non-Arctic countries have also increased their presence, investments,
and activities in the Arctic. Realizing our vision of a peaceful,
stable, prosperous, and cooperative Arctic during this dynamic and
challenging period will require U.S. leadership at home and abroad. [We
will advance U.S. interests across four mutually reinforcing
pillars]{.mark} spanning both domestic and international issues. Many of
the investments we undertake in the U.S. Arctic will benefit not only
residents in Alaska, but also our ability to pursue economic and
environmental opportunities and project influence and security across
the region. Together, these pillars guide the United States' affirmative
agenda in the Arctic region for the next decade. • Pillar 1---Security:
We will deter threats to the U.S. homeland and our allies by enhancing
the capabilities required to defend our interests in the Arctic, while
coordinating shared approaches with allies and partners and mitigating
risks of unintended escalation. We will exercise U.S. Government
presence in the Arctic region as required to protect the American people
and defend our sovereign territory. • Pillar 2---Climate Change and
Environmental Protection: The [U.S. Government]{.mark} will partner with
Alaskan communities and the State of Alaska [to build resilience to the
impacts of climate change]{.mark}, while [work]{.mark}ing [to reduce
emissions from the Arctic as part of broader global mitigation
efforts]{.mark}, to [improve scientific understanding of climate
change]{.mark}, [and to conserve Arctic ecosystems]{.mark}. • Pillar
3---Sustainable Economic Development: [We will **pursue**
**sustainable** **development**]{.mark} and improve livelihoods in
Alaska, including for Alaska Native communities, by investing in
infrastructure, improved access to services, and support for growing
economic sectors. We will also work with allies and partners to expand
highstandard investment and sustainable development across the Arctic
region.]{.underline} • Pillar 4---International Cooperation and
Governance: Despite the challenges to Arctic cooperation resulting from
Russia's aggression in Ukraine, the United States will work to sustain
institutions for Arctic cooperation, including the Arctic Council, and
position these institutions to manage the impacts of increasing activity
in the region. The United States will also work with Arctic Allies and
partners to pursue a common approach to advance shared interests and to
uphold international law in the region[. It is [essential to better
understand]{.mark} the ways the Arctic environment is rapidly changing,
to anticipate future changes, and to understand [the Arctic's impact on
climate change globally and extreme events regionally]{.mark}. The
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will advance our monitoring and
predictive capacity with better data collection and integration,]{.mark}
new observational tools and data, and improved regional and global
climate models. We will also support research on marine ecosystems,
wildlife, and fisheries; the design and construction of Arctic
infrastructure; and health crises afflicting Arctic populations. To
support science-based decisions, [we will also explore research to
**improve our understanding of issues such as the potential emissions
and health threats resulting from permafrost thaw**]{.mark}.
International scientific partnerships and co-production of knowledge
with Alaska Native communities will have a multiplier effect on this
research. Coordinated research on the environmental and societal impacts
of climate change in the Arctic and the Arctic's role in global climate
dynamics should be guided by the Interagency Arctic Research Policy
Committee's (IARPC) and the U.S. Arctic Research Commission's (USARC)
research plans. 3]{.underline}

At the same time, warming temperatures in the [Arctic]{.underline} are
[opening sea routes and allowing **new access** to natural resources,
**prompting increased** traffic and **cooperation** between Arctic and
non-Arctic states]{.underline}. Climate change is destabilizing the
health, food security, and livelihoods of people in the area. We argue

scientific [research]{.underline} on climate and health can **[sustain
channels for diplomacy]{.underline}**. Indeed, [**new**---**even
experimental**---**strategies for cooperation**]{.underline} are
necessary at this critical time.

Cooperation and competition in the Arctic

[The Arctic Council]{.underline} was established in 1996 as a high-level
intergovernmental forum for the eight countries with Arctic territory
and the six Indigenous people's organizations granted "permanent
participant" status. The council [promotes **cooperation**,
**coordination**, and **communication**]{.underline} among Arctic
states, Indigenous communities, and the rest of the Arctic population on
issues including sustainable development, health threats, and emergency
response. The chair of the council rotates among the Arctic state
members, with initiatives carried out by working groups, task forces,
and expert groups.

The Arctic Council has successfully navigated diplomatic disagreements
among member states, including the Iraq War in 2003, the Russo-Georgian
War in 2008, and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. On March 3,
2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the other seven
member states announced a pause in their participation. The pause
disrupted the council's 130 projects related to environmental
monitoring, data collection, equity, and search and rescue. It also put
the brakes on critical work and communication related to Indigenous
peoples, the environment, scientific research, and health safety.

Following discussions, in June 2022 those seven member states of the
council agreed to resume partial activity on existing projects not
involving the Russian Federation. In August 2023, all the Arctic Council
countries, including Russia, agreed to guidelines for resuming working
group and expert group activities. Further discussions with the six
permanent participant Indigenous peoples' organizations in October 2023
encouraged resumption of working group--level activities with Russia.
Then, in February 2024, Russia withheld its annual payment to the Arctic
Council. This step raises urgent questions about the council's future
without Russian participation. How can [collaboration with Russia happen
when **established diplomatic channels are diminished**]{.underline}?

Understanding Russia's aspirations in the Arctic

A [**key** to navigating **future collaboration** on **emerging
diseases**]{.underline} and other health risks in the Arctic is a deeper
understanding of the future Russia sees for itself as a leading power in
the region. Russia controls about 45% of the geographic territory of the
Arctic, including the Northern Sea Route---which is in Russia's
exclusive economic zone---a particularly useful seaway for moving cargo
between the North Pacific region and Northern Europe. Russia's position
in the Arctic and its role in current geopolitical crises contribute to
broader debates on the effectiveness of "soft law" (such as
recommendations and codes of conduct) and diplomacy in various areas of
international scientific cooperation, particularly for health and
climate issues.

Already, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine
have shifted Russian foreign policy approaches to health and science
deeper into the security realm. The invasion prompted many Western
countries to impose a range of scientific sanctions on Russia, and
though individual researchers are not banned from cross-border
collaboration, travel between Russia and the West is more complicated.
The number of research collaborations between Russian scientists and
those from the United States and European countries has fallen, as has
the attendance of Russian researchers at international academic
conferences.

A year into the war with Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir Putin
presented a new Foreign Policy Concept (FPC), an outline of Russia's
national interests, strategic goals, challenges, and main directions of
foreign policy, which had last been updated in 2016. The new FPC
emphasizes Arctic policy in commitments to "counteracting the unfriendly
states' policy aimed at militarization of the region" and "establishing
a mutually beneficial cooperation with the non-Arctic states pursuing a
constructive policy toward Russia." These statements signal Russia's
strategic interest in maintaining a formal presence on the Arctic
Council to preserve its political power in the Arctic while testing new
bilateral partnerships in the region.

Russia's current inclination toward bilateral rather than multilateral
cooperation, coupled with China's ambitions for the region, could set
back the Arctic Council's work to build up necessary health security and
cooperation networks.

Global health priorities in the FPC suggest Russia's continuing interest
in international discussions, but with variations in focus across
regions. The document links global health to environmental protection
and climate change, and goals include "increasing efficiency of
international cooperation in the area of health care and preventing its
politicization," as well as "consolidating international efforts in
order to prevent the extension of dangerous infectious diseases" and
quickly responding to crises, epidemics, and pandemics. Russia remains a
member of the World Health Organization (WHO) and is active in
convenings related to WHO's International Health Regulations and the
pandemic accord led by its Intergovernmental Negotiating Body.

It is significant, however, that neither of the FPC's agendas for health
or the Arctic refers to the existing international platforms---WHO and
the Arctic Council---for maintaining multilateral cooperation.

The lack of mention of multilateral platforms is notable alongside a
joint Russian-Chinese political statement in March 2023---timed closely
with the presentation of the Russian FPC---declaring the two countries'
intentions to act "in favor of preserving the Arctic as a territory of
peace, stability, and constructive cooperation." Though China has no
territorial claim in the Arctic, its plans for a Polar Silk Road via
Arctic waters to Europe, which is included in its Belt and Road
Initiative, indicate a vision for leadership in the region. Official
dialogue on the Arctic between Moscow and Beijing began in 2013. The
cooperation has produced two large Arctic energy infrastructure projects
and a memorandum of understanding between the two countries on maritime
law enforcement in the Arctic zone.

Russia's current inclination toward bilateral rather than multilateral
cooperation, coupled with China's ambitions for the region, could set
back the Arctic Council's work to build up necessary health security and
cooperation networks among all Arctic states and peoples. We think the
situation calls for consideration of new mechanisms for dialogue around
emerging climate and health threats in the region.

The entangled future of the Arctic, global health, and science diplomacy

As geopolitical and military instability abuts nonmilitary humanitarian
pursuits, Arctic states may be forced to allocate resources to
protecting individual interests over supporting scientific cooperation.
However, in other periods of tension, science diplomacy has been key to
preserving cooperation between allies and rivals, as with the Pugwash
Conferences on Science and World Affairs, the Edinburgh Conversations,
Cold War--era polio vaccine cooperation, and the international effort to
sequence SARS-CoV-2.

With the Arctic region in a precarious position, now may be the time to
[move beyond traditional forms of **diplomacy** and center the
**pursuit** of **alternative** means of **scientific cooperation**
around **health** and **climate security as** a unifying **purpose for
continued engagement.**]{.underline}

An important component of any effective international science
collaboration is the personal relationships cultivated between
scientists from around the world, often nurtured over decades. To
preserve those relationships under an Arctic Council with diminished
capacity, we recommend Western policymakers and other stakeholders
engage in bilateral initiatives extending beyond the Arctic Council
framework.

[Nongovernmental, informal interactions]{.underline} (known as Track II
diplomacy) [among scientists from Arctic]{.underline} (and even
non-Arctic) states could be a powerful strategy for keeping Russia
engaged and communicating with the global scientific community. The
first mechanism to try is for researchers in neighboring states or
territories (for example, Alaska, the Russian district of Chukotka, and
Yukon, a Canadian territory) to arrange for partnerships in climate
research. Strategically expanding approaches to scientific cooperation
in the polar regions, particularly through individual contacts, could
[**solidify** the Arctic's significance as a **focal point** for
**twenty-first-century science diplomacy**]{.underline}.

Reykjavik (High North News): At this year\'s Arctic Circle Assembly,
science diplomacy is one of the buzzwords that resonates throughout
sessions, debates, and lectures. \"**[Scientists are natural
diplomats]{.underline}**, as they care deeply about science and not so
much about politics,\" says Jane Francis, Director of the British
Antarctic Survey.

After Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the consequent
suspension of international research cooperation with Russia, the term
[**science** **diplomacy** has **gained increased relevance** and
**importance**]{.underline}.

[Science diplomacy entails **scientific exchanges**]{.underline} and
[cross-border collaboration]{.underline} of scientists and/or scientific
organizations [to perform **diplomatic functions** in international
relations.]{.underline}

[Science diplomacy plays a vital role in **combatting climate
change**]{.underline} in the vulnerable Arctic region. The eight Arctic
states depend on research cooperation to collect data and share costs
and logistic challenges in a remote and difficult region to conduct
research.

Yet, geopolitical tensions and conflicts make cooperation and knowledge
sharing difficult. Some believe that scientists and the bonds between
them have been the undercurrent that has kept international cooperation
afloat.

\"Scientists are natural diplomats because they are so interested in
their science, and they are not really interested in politics, are they?
So they work together,\" says Jane Francis, Director of the British
Antarctic Survey, during an Arctic Circle Assembly session titled \"The
Future of Polar Science Diplomacy: A Critical Mission in Uncertain
Times.\"

She highlighted that [scientists]{.underline} recognize the vastness and
importance of answering the questions about how the poles are changing,
so they want to [**collaborate** to get \"the best **answers**, the best

I am delighted to introduce the Polar Institute's new initiative, the US
Polar Leadership Project. Intended to raise awareness of the
[[**importance** of **US leadership** at a **crucial**]{.mark}
**[juncture for]{.mark}**]{.underline} both [[the]{.underline}
**[Arctic]{.underline}**]{.mark} and Antarctica, USPLP will will argue
forcefully for the importance of US leadership via a multiyear program
spotlighting the [necessity and benefits of **engagement in the
poles.**]{.underline}

[The [next few years]{.mark} are [critical]{.mark}ly important
[to]{.mark} [build]{.mark} **support for [US
leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}**,** [as we [prepare for]{.mark} the
**upcoming US [Chairship of]{.mark} the** [**Arctic**
**Council**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([2031-33) and International Polar Year
(2032-33)]{.underline}. [The [US **must be ready to**]{.mark} **meet
the** moment and [**deliver** on **strategic
priorities.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

These milestones come at a time when the polar regions are under
increasing scrutiny as loci of geopolitical pressure, whether from
environmental changes, economic interests, evolving sovereignty
considerations, or diplomatic signaling. The international agreements
and organizations that represent the polar regions, including the Arctic
Council and Antarctic Treaty System, are increasingly under pressure
from efforts to undermine the global rules-based order.

[[**Polar science** is **essential** to **understanding**]{.mark}
**global [environmental change]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [with
[consequences for **global climate**]{.mark}**,** **biodiversity** and
**human societies**.]{.underline} The [polar regions are **intimately
connected** with the **rest** of the **globe**]{.underline} through
water, energy, and carbon cycles**. [[Rapid
change]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the polar regions [threatens the US
with]{.mark} **rising [sea levels]{.mark}** and **more severe [natural
disasters]{.mark}**,]{.underline} as well as impacts to economic,
environmental, and cultural values.

[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and Antarctic [[**research** is key to
**understanding change** and]{.mark} to **[developing]{.mark}**
**sound**]{.underline} domestic and foreign
[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this context, major international
science bodies have called for a fifth [[I]{.mark}nternational
[P]{.mark}olar [Y]{.mark}ear]{.underline} (IPY) in 2032-33. The IPY will
provide, according to the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC)
and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR), [a [**vital
opportunity** to close]{.mark} **outstanding major [knowledge
gaps.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The [[IPY]{.underline} [will]{.underline}]{.mark} [also [**coincide**
with]{.mark} the next [US **chairship** of the **Arctic
Council**]{.mark}]{.underline} (AC), which will occur 2031-33. During
the two-year AC chairship, US agencies will be leading a suite of
activities with federal, state, Indigenous, and international partners.
In addition, the United States will be hosting a number of Arctic
Council activities. [United States [engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} with
both the International Polar Year and Arctic Council Chairship [[will
require]{.mark} **significant [advance planning]{.mark}** and
[**coordination** **among** **federal
agencies**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} and with international partners
(with a particular emphasis on Canada as the chair from 2029-2031) [to
**[ensure]{.mark}** that the **US prepares** and **[sustains]{.mark} a
[leadership]{.mark} role**.]{.underline}

During this period, [[**US** **leadership**]{.mark} **in** the poles
will be [**more** **important**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and more closely
scrutinized---[[**than** **ever**]{.mark} before]{.underline}. And our
[[**ability** to **demonstrate**]{.mark} [leadership]{.mark}, and to
**[exert]{.mark}** the **influence** of our [**presence** in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and Antarctica---is on thin ice. [[Key
**capabilities**]{.mark} and platforms that [enable]{.mark} our
[presence in the]{.mark} **[poles are at risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Flat or [**[declining budgets]{.mark}** will [**strain** to
**accommodate**]{.mark} the **additional [e]{.mark}**[ffort]{.mark}
required for the **Arctic Council chairship**]{.underline} and IPY5, and
all the associated events, programs, and engagements. But these years
will also be an [[excellent time to launch new **initiatives**]{.mark},
**platforms**, and **[capabilities]{.mark}** for **maximum visibility**
and effect. It's **time to start now**.]{.underline}

For Washington, [Canada's failure to defend its Arctic territory is not
merely a function of **limited resources**, but of deliberate
**strategic neglect**]{.underline}. The refusal to acquire
nuclear-powered submarines---essential for year-round under-ice patrols
and true sovereignty enforcement---reveals a deeper aversion to the
burdens of great power responsibility. While adversaries invest in
undersea dominance and dual-use Arctic infrastructure, [Ottawa opts for
half-measures]{.underline}: diesel patrol submarines that [can't operate
under the polar ice, minimal surveillance capabilities, and no
**permanent military basing** north of 60.]{.underline}

The US view is shifting from a posture of "monitor and respond" to one
of "prepare and deter." Pentagon reports no longer downplay the Arctic
as a region of strategic importance. Even smaller powers have taken
notice. India published its Arctic strategy in 2021, emphasizing
scientific diplomacy. Turkey signed the Svalbard Treaty to gain access
rights to the Arctic in 2023. France and Germany are also exploring
greater footprints in the region.

While the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE) Pact with Canada and
Finland represents a trilateral effort to rebuild icebreaker capacity
and harden the Arctic industrial base, it is not enough. [Canada remains
trapped in]{.underline} a peacetime posture and mentality---[**symbolic
patrols** and **seasonal exercises**]{.underline}---while the region
becomes increasingly contested by powers that are, at best, are neutral
to Canada's concerns and, at worst, openly hostile to them.

This inertia is rooted in a political culture that prioritizes
accommodation over assertiveness. Successive governments have deferred
to progressive special interest groups whose influence blunts hard
security policies. Environmentalist and Indigenous consultations, while
important, are often weaponized procedurally to paralyze decisive
action. [The result is a government **debilitated by process**, one that
speaks of sovereignty but shrinks from the instruments necessary to
enforce it]{.underline}. [Even **modest defense initiatives face
resistance**]{.underline} if they challenge entrenched activist
orthodoxies or require confronting Canada's internal contradictions.
This includes the legal quagmire of provincial and territorial
jurisdiction in the North, which Ottawa remains unwilling to override or
reform.

Perhaps most damning for Washington is [Canada's lack of **strategic
coherence**]{.underline}. [Ottawa]{.underline} provides a strategic
framework [for the Arctic]{.underline} but [fails to dedicate the
resources to achieve the objectives contained therein.]{.underline}
[Policy]{.underline} and strategy [**without resource commitments** are
unseriousness ideas]{.underline}. Moreover, [Canada's policies do not
form a doctrine of **Arctic deterrence**, convey]{.underline} [no **idea
on how to mobilize federal will,** and fail to weave a **unifying
narrative**]{.underline} that connects Arctic defense to the survival of
Canada as a sovereign nation in an increasingly anarchic world.

America cannot---and will not---permit a soft underbelly to fester in a
domain as critical as the Arctic. It is not inconceivable for US forces
unilaterally securing parts of the Canadian Arctic in the event of a
crisis. Such actions, while diplomatically uncomfortable, would be
strategically necessary if Canadian gaps remain unaddressed. To be
blunt: if pressed and in a fight with Russia or China in the Arctic, the
US will almost certainly be "Elbows Up" in defense of North America,
even if it offends Canadian sensitivities.

Five "cold kills"

Our research unearthed five [factors that contribute to Canada's Arctic
inertia. Each of these "**cold kills"** continues to impede progress on
increasing supply chain and defense resilience.]{.underline}

1\. Lacking multipartisan consensus on the region as "ground zero" for a
new "Great Game."

[Canada]{.underline} cannot do much in the Arctic if it
[lacks]{.underline} enduring political will to support and fund dual-use
**[infrastructure]{.underline}** over decades. The growing importance of
the Arctic for great-power competition underscores the need for
politicians, defense planners, local communities, industry partners, and
other relevant stakeholders to walk in the same general direction, if
not in lockstep. Despite the urgency of this task, no sustained,
cross-partisan strategy for Arctic defense exists. Without it,
[investments, infrastructure development, and operational planning
will]{.underline} almost [**certainly** **come** **up**
**short**]{.underline}. In 2025, Natural Resources Canada is projected
to invest \$12.1 million toward climate adaptation projects in the
North---which is necessary, but insufficient when compared to similar
efforts by other Arctic powers.

Yet, allies offer a contrast. Norway's Arktis 2030 fund and its defense
pledge of 3 percent of GDP underscore a whole-of-society approach.
Finland's NATO entry boosted its participation in Arctic exercises.
Sweden utilizes Arctic data to create a stronger and better informed
national defense policy. Denmark leverages Greenland's geostrategic
importance in its Arctic defense. While Canada's Arctic is inaccessible
by comparison, it can look at what NATO allies do right in the region
and their whole-of-society approaches.

2\. Placing too much of the strategic burden on local communities.

The [Canadian government continues to place disproportionate
responsibility for Arctic security on local
**communities**]{.underline}, revealing a dangerous strategic asymmetry
between rhetoric and capability. The [Canadian Rangers]{.underline},
though a symbol of national resolve and cultural integration, are not a
substitute for a modern, standing military presence. They [are
**lightly** **armed**, **part-time volunteers**]{.underline}---valuable
in their knowledge of the land but structurally unfit to deter or
respond to the increasing threats posed by adversarial state actors
operating just beyond the line of sight. This over-reliance has created
a strategic mirage: Ottawa appears engaged in Arctic defence, but the
burden is unfairly borne by those with the fewest resources and the
highest exposure.

In effect, Canada's Arctic is not treated as an equal part of
Confederation, but as a frontier outpost whose primary function is
surveillance and symbolic sovereignty. The political imagination to
raise Arctic communities to the standard of living of rural southern
Canada is absent. There is no serious nation-building project
underway---[no long-term vision to tie **infrastructure**, broadband,
energy, healthcare, and education in the North to the **national grid of
opportunity.**]{.underline}

The region is home to significant deposits of iron ore, gold, diamonds,
and rare earth elements. The Mary River Mine on Baffin Island is one of
the world's richest reserves of high-grade iron ore, producing millions
of tons annually. Similarly, the Hope Bay and Meliadine gold mines
contribute substantially to Canada's mineral output. These resources are
critical for economic development and for national security, given their
importance in defense manufacturing and technology. Yet, the extraction
and transportation of these resources are hampered by [**limited
infrastructure**]{.underline} that [**eludes** **further**
**development** due to **lack** of **coordination** and **investment**
at all **levels** of **government**.]{.underline} While the Yukon
Security Advisory Council can be a model for shared governance federal,
territorial, and Indigenous jurisdictions overlap without coherent
authority. [The result is a **bureaucratic bottleneck** that **limits
response agility** and accountability,]{.underline} especially in
scenarios involving mass casualty events or foreign incursions below the
threshold of war.

3\. Misunderstanding the Arctic as a land- or maritime-centric domain,
instead of a multidomain one.

[**Canada's Arctic strategy** remains anchored in a **legacy
mindset**]{.underline}---fixated on land and maritime domains---while
the battlespace has already expanded far beyond the ice and tundra. The
Canadian Arctic is a multi-domain operating environment in the most
rigorous sense: a crucible where air, sea, land, space, and cyberspace
domains converge. [Focusing primarily on ground mobility]{.underline} or
maritime choke points is antiquated.

### 2AC\-\--Arctic Securitization Good

#### Securitizing climate change in the Arctic is [good]{.underline}---it forces a discursive shift that [challenges]{.underline} hegemonic security structures.

Researcher in Social Sciences at University of Lapland. "Age of Changes:
Threat of Climate Change and Its Meaning for Security." In Climate

Exner-Pirot. Springer; mgm\]

However, for the [Arctic]{.underline} region the [**rising**
**discursive** **shift** from traditional to a more **integrated** and
**holistic security** approach]{.underline} in global security politics
can be seen as [**highly beneficial** as the major part of **security
challenges** and threats to the region are nonmilitary]{.underline} by
their nature (Luszczuk 2016, p. 37). While the [scope of security in the
Arctic has already moved from traditional security logic toward
inclusion of human and **environmental aspects**]{.underline} and from
confrontation to cooperation, as pointed out by Heininen (2012, 2016),
the Arctic states have, simultaneously, shown intentions to rebuild and
enhance their Arctic military capabilities (Huebert et al. 2012, p. 18).
[Environmental and social aspects have a long history in Arctic
**security discussions**]{.underline} where the peace time presence of
military and oil production have caused a conflict of interest between
Arctic states and their local societies (Heininen 2016, p. 19). While
the effects of climate change are being felt in the Arctic both sooner
and more dramatically than in most of the other areas, the global
climate policies have great impact on the region. The [**geopolitical**
**ramifications** of Arctic sea ice melt]{.underline} and the
environmental changes [impacting on the well-being and traditional ways
of living of the local communities will]{.underline} no doubt [have an
**increasing impact** on the security discourses]{.underline} both
regionally and globally (see Heininen 2016).

CONCLUSION: FROM REACTION TO PREVENTION

Despite the significant increase in the references to climate change in
national security strategies and defense planning documents that has put
the Security Council under increased pressure to address the
climate-related security risks, the Council has been
[ambivalent]{.underline} in its **[approach to climate
change]{.underline}**. Due to the difficult nature of the debates
revolving around the dispute over the Council's mandate, climate change
is only addressed on a specific-country or conflict-based level. Taking
into consideration the concern of the vulnerable states over the
national interest-based nature of the Security Council, the inability of
the Council to adopt a resolution on climate change
[signals]{.underline} more about the contention of the **[traditional
hegemonic security structure]{.underline}** than to the refusal of the
link between climate change and security.

While the [**concerns** **over**]{.underline} the '[security treatment'
of climate change]{.underline} leading to unilateral defensive actions
against the vulnerable [are]{.underline} nothing but
**[redundant]{.underline}**, the analysis suggests that the
[representations of **climate** **change** as a **threat**]{.underline}
are calling for multilateral and preventative measures [based on
**mainstreaming** of **climate** **action** in the name of
security]{.underline}. It seems that [**rather** than **security**
inevitably **bringing** **forth** the **logic** of **war** and
**exceptionalism**, **climate change emphasizes** the **importance** of
an **integrated** and **holistic** **approach** in **maintaining**
**peace** and **security**]{.underline}. [Security]{.underline} is seen
to [necessitate]{.underline} the [recognition of]{.underline} the
interconnection and interdependence among states and the [**symbiotic
relationship** between human, national and global security]{.underline}.
The participation in global governance is taken as a necessity in order
to maintain sovereignty that is more threatened by criminal non-state
actors than by other states. The [risks arising from lacking adaptive
capacities]{.underline} of vulnerable social systems [need preventative
measures]{.underline} that is [deeply linked to the promotion of
**sustainable development**]{.underline}. [Only if]{.underline} these
[**risk** **management practices** **fail** are more **exceptional
security** measures called forth.]{.underline}

While the direct threats of climate change such as sea-level rise and
extreme weather events have found their way into national security
strategies of many states, the security discussion of the Security
Council is mostly focused on the indirect threats. Identifying climate
change as a threat multiplier is more likely to produce security
policies focused on adaptation while the mitigation agenda is largely
suppressed. The need for ambitious and effective emission reductions in
the name of security is rarely articulated. It, thus, seems that while
the effects of climate change are contesting the basic structures of
security, which are built on territoriality, sovereignty and military
power, are being contested, the idea of peace and security necessitating
cumulative economic and social development is mainly left untouched.
Security is still predominantly about state survival, but human security
is seen increasingly crucial for the survival of the state. The idea of
maximizing material power relative to other states is challenged by the
idea of the necessity of cooperation and global governance. The
interconnectedness of threats that do not respect borders or sectoral
boundaries is challenging the image of internal order vs. external
disorder, while blurring the limits between private/public,
domestic/foreign and between those providing and in need of security.
While the meaning of security still remains to be connected to the idea
of external anarchy and distinction between human civilization and the
biosphere, **[security]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
[rather]{.underline} [**conceived** in terms of **sustaining peace** in
transformation, than as **maintaining** any **stable state of
security**.]{.underline}

[1. Create Collaborative Feedback Loops Communities and [researchers
should be in continuous conversation **at each step of the research
process**]{.mark}**, exchanging ideas, feedback, and knowledge starting
well before research questions are even determined to after the
evaluation of findings.**]{.underline} Ensuring dialogue at each
research benchmark helps ground research in community needs, builds both
community and researcher capacity, and facilitates the translation of
findings into action. Participants shared the following regarding each
step of the research process: [Problem Identification: By focusing
research on the questions that communities want answered, rather than
the interests of [researchers]{.mark} and funders, **[findings]{.mark}
[can]{.mark} more [effectively address]{.mark}** the problems
communities are experiencing as a result of [permafrost thaw]{.mark}.
Some participants described a "client" or "service" model for
partnership, where communities approached researchers with concerns
related to local road degradation or water quality, and researchers
conducted assessments to address these specific concerns.
[Collaborative]{.mark} development of research questions can help shift
traditional power dynamics and set expectations for productive
relationships for the length of the partnership.]{.underline} Process
Development: Researchers can work with communities to co-create process
guides that outline estimated timelines, benchmarks, and areas where
community knowledge is needed. Incorporating regular meetings between
researchers, community stakeholders, and working groups is crucial for
providing updates on the status of the project, communicating
preliminary findings, and addressing questions or concerns that arise.
By developing this framework together, communities can have greater
transparency into the research process unfolding in their community and
have an early opportunity to identify practical and strategic flaws or
make referrals to additional stakeholders for consultation. Workshop
participants indicated that their research projects were more successful
when they focused on the research interests of communities when
developing processes, contextualizing where individual steps fit into
the "bigger picture." [One suggested model for reference was the Nexus
Environmental Assessment Tool (NEAT+), which can be used to determine
who should be a part of a decision-making process. Data Collection:
[Researchers can **engage** in collaborative data]{.mark} collection [by
documenting local and Indigenous knowledge]{.mark} for community records
and training communities to use testing equipment, GIS, and drone
technology. [Building]{.mark} this [local capacity]{.mark} through
requested training opportunities can [help communities continue research
independently]{.mark} both during and after the formal research
partnership]{.underline}. One participant shared the [value of training
community members to use Google Timelapse,]{.underline} a photo archive
that was a useful reference for a community experiencing landscape
changes overtime. Researchers similarly shared the incredible value of
partnering with those who have a deep knowledge of the land and how it
has been changing over time and are already working in or monitoring
areas where research is underway. Participants shared stories of
co-creating maps using local knowledge and discussing permafrost cores
samples in community workshops. Communicating Findings: While the
practice of sharing results and findings of research with communities
has become standard and increasingly required, participants shared that
there are still gaps in making results truly accessible to communities.
[In addition to technical restrictions such as paywalls and internet
access, reports may be written for academic or scientific audiences
rather than in more "digestible" language.]{.underline} When framing
these findings, one participant emphasized that researchers are not
there to make decisions, but rather to provide information that helps
communities make informed decisions. [[Participants]{.mark} recommended
hosting a public meeting/workshop or [present]{.mark}ing [at]{.mark} a
[Tribal Council to **personally**]{.mark} [share findings and create
opportunities for discussion and asking questions]{.mark}. A suggested
model for data accessibility was the FAIR (Findability, Accessibility,
Interoperability, and Reuse) model that establishes principles around
community-oriented data collection and dissemination.
[Researchers]{.mark} should [make]{.mark} particular [efforts to
urgently and clearly disseminate information related to health and
safety]{.mark}, such as maps outlining potential hazards. Kaska Chief
Dylan Loblaw shared that [in traditional knowledge, there is a cycle,
not an end]{.mark}. Engaging the community in every step of the research
process, from data collection to dissemination, fosters trust and
ensures that the findings are relevant and beneficial to those directly
affected by environmental changes. By incorporating collaborative
practices at each step, [**research can become intertwined with
communities**, pushing research into a continuous, cyclical practice of
questioning, discovery, and problem-solving.]{.mark}]{.underline}
