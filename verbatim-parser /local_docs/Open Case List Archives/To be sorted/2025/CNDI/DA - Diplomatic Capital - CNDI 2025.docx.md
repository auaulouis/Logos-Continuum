# \*DA---Dip-Cap---CNDI 2025\*

### [NOTES]{.underline}

#### Basic Argument:

This Diplomatic Capital (Dip-Cap) disadvantage contends that
significantly increasing U.S. exploration and development of the Arctic
will consume a finite pool of American diplomatic attention, resources,
and leadership capacity. By redirecting senior‐level envoys, interagency
coordination, and political capital northward, the plan undermines
ongoing U.S. efforts to de-escalate crises elsewhere---specifically in
the Middle East and South Asia---allowing those conflicts to spiral into
global nuclear exchanges.

#### Versions:

1--- Israel-Iran -- U.S. diplomacy post-strikes is currently going to
push Israel and Iran back to the negotiating table. Diverting focus to
the Arctic destroys that diplomatic process, triggering Iranian
nuclearization and nuclear escalation.

The biggest strategic burden here is still uniqueness---you need to
prove: A) Negotiations are happening now, and B) Netanyahu is at least
partially constrained by U.S. diplomacy. This is a challenge. Some
useful claims to emphasize:

- Washington retains leverage over Israel via conditional access to key
  military tools (e.g., bunker-buster bombs, intel sharing, missile
  defense cooperation).

- Netanyahu's offensive strategy is part of a "pressure-to-negotiate"
  gambit---U.S. diplomatic intervention is what flips it from escalation
  to de-escalation.

- Now that Iran has suffered significant damage they will be forced to
  the table to ensure regime survival, but this requires sustained U.S.
  diplomatic engagement which the plan trades off with.

2--- India-Pakistan -- Similarly, Washington's active backchannel and
public mediation between Delhi and Islamabad has enabled a ceasefire
that has so far prevented renewed strikes. Shifting diplomatic bandwidth
ends those negotiations, triggering drawn-in and nuclear exchange.

#### Recency note:

I'm finishing this revision on June 22nd, 2025. The situation has
changed dramatically in the last 24 hours with the U.S. strikes on Iran.
The Israel-Iran UQ is now about post-strike de-escalation and coercive
diplomacy, not pre-strike mediation. The evidence in the original file
from before June 21st about \"potential\" talks or avoiding U.S. draw-in
is likely now outdated. The DA *may* still be viable but UQ ev is
becoming outdated rapidly; this means your ev might be outdated by the
time you read it, so you'll have to try your best with what's here at
least until updates are cut for research waves.

mgm\]

From Israel\'s perspective, three potential
[[outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark} could be seen as [[at least **partial
victories**]{.underline}]{.mark}**:** one is [a [new **American-brokered
treaty**]{.mark} that forces Iran to make **significant concessions** on
its nuclear program, long-range missile development, and regional
support for terror groups]{.underline}; [[another is]{.mark} a
[deterrence]{.mark}-based \"[**quiet for quiet**\"
**arrangement**]{.mark}, **[grounded in Iran\'s]{.mark} current
[losses]{.mark}**]{.underline}; and the third is an Iranian escalation
that enrages Trump enough to trigger a wider regional war - possibly
culminating in regime change, a goal mainly voiced by Defense Minister
Israel Katz.

Despite the Israeli and American operational gains, any of these
scenarios still hinges on numerous variables. [**[Achieving a viable
agreement]{.mark}** would [require **tough negotiations**]{.mark} led
by]{.underline} an impatient [president and officials]{.underline} with
limited expertise in nuclear affairs. A deterrence-based balance could
also erode over time. As for regime change -- it remains an ambitious
goal, and history shows how such ventures have repeatedly entangled the
U.S. in long-drawn-out conflicts across the world.

[Trump]{.underline} himself, in his post-strike declarations,
[described]{.underline} the **[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as [a
**one-time action**]{.mark} aimed solely at disabling Iran\'s nuclear
program -- [not]{.mark} at [toppling]{.mark} the
[regime]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There\'s still another issue that must be taken into account: we don\'t
truly know the condition of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, or how flexible
he\'s willing to be. In war games staged separately by Israel and the
United States over the years, there has been recurring mention of a
scenario in which failures in war would lead Khamenei to conclude that
he needs a nuclear bomb at any cost. In such a case, despite the price
Iran has already paid, Khamenei could urge his people to resume progress
on the project -- potentially through a future test involving a
relatively primitive device or facility.

On Sunday morning, the Iranians launched a relatively heavy barrage of
missiles against Israel. Once again, a large number of impacts were
recorded, and widespread damage was caused in a neighborhood in north
Tel Aviv. Yet again, most of the injuries were relatively light, thanks
to residents entering shelters and safe rooms, which have proven
effective in withstanding missile attacks.

Iranian launcher units are now operating from deeper within the country
-- from central and eastern Iran -- while being \"hunted\" by Israeli
aircraft over western Iran. Their fire is directed primarily at the Tel
Aviv metropolitan area, with secondary focus on Haifa and its suburbs,
and the Be\'er Sheva region.

According to analysis by the IDF Home Front Command, the Iranians are
aiming at strategic and military targets located within densely
populated areas. The collateral damage to civilian neighborhoods serves
their broader objective of terrorizing the Israeli public.

So far, however, Iran has not managed to achieve any results that would
shift the balance of the campaign -- despite the increasing difficulty
Israel faces in managing the prolonged threat to its home front. The key
question now facing Khamenei is whether to escalate further -- by
attacking U.S. military bases in the Middle East, or by targeting other
American assets such as embassies, aircraft, or concentrations of
tourists around the world.

Senior Iranian officials have already threatened to strike U.S. bases.
But if Khamenei approves such a step, he must also consider the
possibility that Trump -- despite his previous declarations -- could be
drawn into launching additional painful retaliatory responses against
Iran. This is the stage when intermediaries are likely to step in: from
Western European countries to Russia and China, all seeking to prevent a
prolonged war that would drive up oil prices and cause further
instability in the international arena.

**[A [Deal to End]{.mark} Two [War]{.mark}s]{.underline}**

The [[**major** **military** **success**]{.mark} in Iran]{.underline}
must [[now]{.underline}]{.mark} be [[converted into a **diplomatic
achievement**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[an **agreement**]{.mark} that
forces the regime to strictly comply with the **demands** of the
international community and **[eliminates the threat of
nuclear]{.mark}** **[weapons]{.mark}** and **missiles** to]{.underline}
Israel and [the region]{.underline}. [[**After Fordow,**]{.mark} **this
outcome [no longer]{.mark}**]{.underline} seems entirely [**[out of
reach]{.mark}** -- **despite**]{.underline} the aforementioned
[**challenges**.]{.underline}

But, Israel\'s preoccupation with Iran does not exempt it from
addressing its other urgent and unresolved issue: Gaza. The war against
Hamas continues to claim victims, with no foreseeable resolution on the
horizon.

Earlier today, the IDF announced that, in an operation carried out with
the Shin Bet security service, the bodies of three hostages -- Yonatan
Samerano, Ofra Kedar, and Staff Sgt. Shay Levinson -- had been returned
to Israel. Fifty hostages remain in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to be
alive. Rescuing additional living hostages through military means will
be extremely difficult, given Hamas\'s reported orders to murder them if
Israeli forces approach.

The IDF continues to confine more than two million Palestinian civilians
into small, overcrowded areas comprising roughly 20 percent of the
Strip\'s territory. Meanwhile, deadly incidents occur daily around food
distribution centers, where many Palestinians are killed in clashes.

[The [weakening of Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} and the evident fragility
of Hamas in Gaza may [[**present an opportunity** for a **comprehensive
deal that**]{.mark} could **[bring]{.mark}** the
**[war]{.mark}**]{.underline} on both fronts [**[to]{.mark} an
[end]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But such a resolution would demand
significant Israeli concessions -- a large-scale prisoner release, and
the abandonment of dangerous aspirations to rebuild settlements in the
Strip, dreams that persist within the far-right factions of the Israeli
government.

The United States has long neglected its roles and responsibilities of
defining and implementing a comprehensive polar strategy and funding
budgetary requests by the U.S. Coast Guard to grow and maintain the
existing U.S. ice-breaking fleet. Recognizing these long-standing
deficiencies, the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
Government]{.underline} has begun to put a [[**greater focus**
on]{.mark} **U.S. [Arctic]{.mark} policy**]{.underline} recognizing that
"The Arctic is no longer an emerging frontier, but is instead a region
of growing national importance," said Vice Admiral Linda Fagan,
Commander of U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area. In June 2020, the Trump
Administration released its first presidential memorandum on the Arctic
titled "Safeguarding U.S. National Interests in the Arctic and Antarctic
Regions." This marks a significant step in [**crafting** a
**strategy**]{.underline} for the region, driven in part, by the desire
[to push back against the expansion of Russian and Chinese]{.underline}
influence and **[military]{.underline} [force]{.underline}
[projection]{.underline}** in the region, as outlined in the 2018 U.S.
National Security Strategy and in the Pentagon's June 2019 Department of
Defense Arctic Strategy \[51\].

The devised plan calls for the launch of three heavy icebreakers by 2029
and the establishment of two domestic and two international support
bases \[52\]. While the [U.S. government]{.underline} is beginning to
[[take]{.mark} [more]{.mark}]{.underline} of a **[[strategic
focus]{.underline}]{.mark}** on devising and implementing policies to
govern and protect U.S. national interests, the presidential memorandum
highlights the [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} current [[Arctic
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} as being **[[overwhelmingly
military]{.underline}]{.mark}** in focus and catching up with Arctic
competitors, namely China and Russia, although each bring a different
threat level to the Arctic region and U.S. interests \[53\]. Therefore,
there is much work to be done by the [U.S. policymakers]{.underline} to
[[**divert resources** and **attention**]{.underline}]{.mark} to
anticipate all threats (both military and non-military), as well as
streamline the necessary working [to patch security weaknesses and
promote stability]{.underline} and rule-based order by
**[[investing]{.underline}]{.mark}** in **[[diplomatic]{.mark}
[capital]{.mark}]{.underline}** and regional partners \[53\].

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} light of [great power competition]{.underline}
and increased human activities [in [the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
resulting from the diminishment of Arctic ice,
[[some]{.underline}]{.mark} observers [[argue]{.mark} that there is a

**competes** with]{.mark} these [other regions]{.mark} for **attention**

Accountability Office (GAO) report stated

Management roles for advancing U.S. Arctic priorities span the federal
government.... While many federal entities engage with foreign partners
on Arctic issues, the Department of State serves as the lead for
**[[Arctic diplomacy efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}**....

Stakeholders identified five factors that facilitated and five factors
that hindered the federal government's management of U.S. Arctic
priorities. For example, stakeholders identified [U.S. Arctic
**[expertise]{.mark}** and **[engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline} as
factors that [[facilitated]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[influence]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic Council. However, some
stakeholders said that the Arctic Executive Steering Committee and the
broader federal government face various challenges related to
**[[interagency coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[hinder
implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of U.S. Arctic priorities outlined
in the \[October\] 2022 \[Arctic\] strategy.

Stakeholders identified three factors pertaining to State's structures
that facilitated and two factors that hindered State's management of
U.S. Arctic priorities. For example, stakeholders identified continuity
within the Senior Arctic Official position and supporting office as a
factor that has deepened **[[institutional
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Arctic Council work, facilitating
[efforts to]{.underline} [promote U.S. priorities]{.underline}. However,
some stakeholders identified **[[gaps in
leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}** and limited **[[convening
authority]{.underline}]{.mark}** as factors that had [[hindered]{.mark}
management]{.underline}. Many stakeholders viewed the announcement of
the Ambassador-at-Large for the Arctic Region position positively but
identified elements [State]{.underline} and the new Ambassador should
consider [[to]{.underline} [manage]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [Arctic
[priorities]{.mark}]{.underline} successfully going forward. These
elements include consistency in position and title, a formalized office
structure, clarity of Ambassador's role within the department, and
greater authority to coordinate with all the relevant bureaus across the
department.134

[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark} uses these to [[target]{.underline}
**[Iran's]{.underline}**]{.mark} key **[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and missile [[sites]{.underline}]{.mark}. Almost
[**[immediately]{.mark}**, [Tehran's]{.mark}
[proxies]{.mark}---Hezbollah, and Houthi rebels---[respond with]{.mark}
**[devastating]{.mark} conventional** **[missile]{.mark}
[strikes]{.mark}** against Israel]{.underline}. These attacks kill at
least as many Israelis as during the October 7, 2023, Hamas raid. In
response, [[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark} attempts to preempt further
proxy military strikes by [launching aerial [strikes]{.mark} against
proxy military **[strongholds]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These attacks kill
more than 2,000 Arabs.

[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} [responds directly]{.underline} and [takes
advantage of the Israeli missile defenses being now
degraded]{.underline} to [[strike]{.underline}]{.mark} key [[Israeli
nuclear]{.mark} and government defense ministry
[buildings]{.mark}]{.underline} in Tel Aviv, killing more Israeli
civilians. At the same time, [Iran]{.underline} also announces that it
has **[[withdraw]{.underline}]{.mark}**n [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ([[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}), thereby
signaling its readiness [[to **use nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}**.**]{.mark}

Israeli intelligence then learns that Israel's previous conventional
strikes against Iranian nuclear and missile sites failed to ~~retard~~
Iran's integration of nuclear warheads with its missiles. When Israel
shares this information with US officials and again asks them to approve
a joint US-Israeli follow-on raid, Washington only offers "continued
assistance" and tells Israel it should stop attacking Iran lest the
[[**fighting escalates** to a **nuclear exchange**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Israel swallows hard. Sensing that it now is isolated and that further
Israeli conventional strikes are unlikely to scotch an Iranian nuclear
strike, [Israel]{.underline}'s prime minister [decides]{.underline}
[attacking Iran with **nuclear weapons** is Israel's only
option]{.underline}. After consulting his war cabinet, he approves a
non-lethal nuclear demonstration detonation over a remote location in
Iran combined with conventional strikes against main Iranian nuclear
facilities and military sites. [Israel]{.underline} also
[launches]{.underline} [**[cyber-attacks]{.mark}** against Iran's
military **communications** networks]{.underline} and uses its back
channels to make a private diplomatic appeal to Tehran to stand down
further offensive action against Israel.

Israel's actions, however, [fail to bend [Iran]{.mark}'s will to
[continue to **wage war**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Worse, the United
States now urges Israel to stand down. Isolated and desperate,
[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark} concludes it has no choice: It launches a
"precision" **[[follow-on nuclear strike]{.underline}]{.mark}** of 50
weapons against 25 Iranian military targets (including Russian-manned
air defense sites). The aim is to ~~cripple~~ Iranian offensive forces
and perhaps induce enough chaos to prompt the Iranian revolutionary
regime to collapse. Almost **[immediately]{.underline}** [**after** the
Israeli strike]{.underline}, however, [**[Iran]{.mark} launches** a
**[nuclear attack]{.mark}** of its own [against]{.mark} an **[Israeli
air base]{.mark}** where **[American military]{.mark}** are
**[present]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

With this move, the game ends.

Many critical questions remain unanswered. Would Israel or Iran conduct
[further nuclear strikes]{.underline}? Would [Israel target Tehran with
nuclear weapons]{.underline}? And vice versa, would [Iran target Tel
Aviv with nuclear arms]{.underline}? Would [**[Russia]{.mark}** or the
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline} be [[**drawn**
in]{.mark}to the war]{.underline}? These many basic unknowns helped
inform each of the game's four major takeaways:

The strategic uncertainties generated after an **[Israeli-Iranian
nuclear exchange]{.underline}** are likely to be at least as
[fraught]{.underline} as any that might arise before such a clash. An
unspoken hope among security experts is that nuclear deterrence can work
between Israel and Iran. Such optimism, however, discourages clear
thinking about what might happen if **[[deterrence
fails]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [both countries use nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. During the game's play and hot wash session,
participants emphasized how difficult it was to develop appropriate
policy responses to Israeli or Iranian nuclear use as neither
contingency was adequately considered before use. Precisely how much
damage might Israeli nuclear strikes inflict against Iran's population
and underground military assets? Would Iran's key nuclear and missile
capabilities be knocked out or are they buried deep enough to resist
nuclear strikes? What precisely might the political, diplomatic,
military, and economic impacts be of such nuclear strikes? Would the
[world's **[economies]{.mark}** be "[**knocked**
**out**]{.mark}"]{.underline} or just "jolted" as a result? How would
the [**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [Russia]{.mark},**
**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [other]{.underline} [nuclear-armed
countries]{.underline} respond to Israeli and Iranian nuclear use? Would
they be **[[drawn in]{.mark}to the conflict]{.underline}**? Would
demands for proportionality guide US and allied responses? How likely
would Israel be to share details of what targets it hit with precisely
what weapons with outside parties including with its closest allies?
After the game, none of the participants felt confident that they could
answer any of these questions. To narrow these "unknowns" gaming
possible Middle Eastern nuclear wars---both publicly and in classified
settings---are needed. Ideally, such simulations would include officials
and outside experts from Israel and neighboring Middle Eastern states.
An explicit goal for these games would be to devise ways to deter first
and subsequent, retaliatory nuclear weapons strikes. Such official
gaming, however, has yet to take place publicly. And it is not clear
either if it has been conducted in classified settings.

Although Israel and Iran might initially seek to avoid the nuclear
targeting of population, such [self-restraint is tenuous]{.underline}.
Military analysts have rightly argued precision-guided munitions enable
combatants to avoid hitting innocent civilians. Meanwhile, most nations
have ratified the 1977 Protocol 1 of the Geneva Convention of 1949,
which discourages targeting civilians and civil objects. Perhaps for
these reasons, both Israel and Iran---neither of which is a party to
Protocol 1---initially avoided targeting civilians with their nuclear
weapons. In the game, however, even Israel's initial decision to fire a
harmless nuclear demonstration shot was considered controversial. The
game's Israeli defense minister and others wanted instead to strike
Tehran to maximize chaos in hopes of inducing regime change. This option
in the game's second move was again promoted as being as reasonable as
trying to limit civilian casualties. Ultimately, the Israel team chose
instead to strike 25 military targets with 50 nuclear weapons. Israeli
and US intelligence, though, could not clearly determine what collateral
and military damage these "limited" military strikes inflicted. After
Iran replied with a nuclear military strike of its own against a
strategic Israeli airbase, the game ended. Yet, a third follow-on
Israeli nuclear strike was a serious possibility now that the nuclear
threshold was passed. But what might Israel target next? Much would
depend on the power of [arguments]{.underline} [in Washington,
Jerusalem, and Tehran]{.underline} [for]{.underline} and against
conducting **[further nuclear strikes]{.underline}** and attacking
population centers. In this regard, both [US and Israeli officials
appear to share a similar jus ad bellum]{.underline} (legal
justifications for war) view of military proportionality. This shared
view considers extensive [collateral harm]{.underline} to innocents
[acceptable]{.underline} so long as it is necessary [to achieve major
military goals]{.underline}. This view, however, is not universally
supported. Many of the United States' closest allies, for example,
believe that when there is a choice between inflicting less or more
military damage to civilians and civil objects to achieve a military
objective and an option that inflicts more harm is chosen over less
harmful options, the damage inflicted should be viewed as being
excessive to achieving legitimate military goals. To complicate matters,
Washington officials often emphasize the importance of reducing
indiscriminate harm as much as possible. This patchwork of views on
military proportionality is confounding. Certainly, part of any effort
[**[to deter]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[future]{.underline}**
[[use]{.underline}]{.mark} [of]{.underline} **[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}** against cities in the Middle East would benefit
from public clarification of just what military proportionality might
demand in such cases. Initially, this might be accomplished with
[track-two [**talks** between]{.mark}]{.underline} former senior
officials from the [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and [Israel]{.mark}
and]{.underline}, if possible, [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yet another
reason to hold such talks is to understand Iranian and Israeli
messaging. In the game's hot wash session, Israel was asked to
reconsider its decision to make a second 50-weapon nuclear strike. The
Israeli team was given a different Iranian diplomatic response to
Israel's move one demand that Tehran cease all offensive actions against
Israel. The Israeli team was asked what they might do if Iran offered to
cease offensive operations in exchange for an Israeli commitment to
engage in **[mutual talks]{.underline}** to eliminate Iranian and
Israeli nuclear weapons. This softer reply [[made]{.mark} a
**[significant difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}: The Israel team said
if it had received this response, it would have accepted Iran's offer
and would have [[**held** off]{.mark} launching a second **nuclear
[strike]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[After]{.underline} securing a [ceasefire]{.underline},
[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} is now actively [[looking to
US]{.underline}]{.mark} President Donald Trump [[to]{.mark}
[**facilitate dialogue** with **India**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At an
event hosted by the US Embassy in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz
Sharif praised Trump for helping [[**de**-**escalate tensions**]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} India]{.underline} and backed [[American]{.mark}
**involvement** in future **[diplomacy]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Sharif\'s comments are in line with Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto
Zardari\'s recent statement: \"[If]{.underline} the [US is willing to
help Pakistan in]{.underline} maintaining this
**[ceasefire]{.underline}**, it is [reasonable to expect]{.underline}
that an [**[America]{.mark}n role** in [arranging]{.mark} a
**[comprehensive dialogue]{.mark}**]{.underline} would also be
beneficial for us," Bhutto said. \"On 10 different occasions, he
\[Trump\] has taken credit for [**[facilitating]{.mark}** the
**[ceasefire]{.mark}**]{.underline} [between India and
Pakistan]{.underline} --- and rightly so. He deserves that credit
because it was his efforts that helped make the ceasefire possible.\"

Earlier this week, Sharif said that he believed [[**India won\'t**
**launch** another **military**]{.mark}
**[strike]{.mark}**]{.underline}. He outlined three reasons for this:
international transparency, American diplomacy, and India's economic
vulnerability.

\"We have consistently offered even to the Americans to participate in
an international investigation to probe India's allegations," he said,
referencing the recent Pahalgam terror attack. He claimed that this
openness had \"won international confidence.\"

Sharif also highlighted what he called the "Trump factor." He said,
"Trump has proudly claimed credit for playing a decisive role in
achieving the ceasefire, and this he sees as a big victory for
himself... President Trump grabbed this opportunity to be known as a
peacemaker, and we\'re confident he won't let this great achievement
\[go to waste\]. Trump is fundamentally a man of peace, not war."

The third factor, according to Sharif, is India's economy. "Given the
economic progress India claims to have made, [**[war]{.mark}** would be
[a]{.mark} **complete [disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline} for them. The
destruction would be India's to bear," he said.

Just days ago, during an address to troops in Quetta, the Pakistan PM
admitted the country could no longer rely on bailouts. "They no longer
expect us to go there with a begging bowl," he said, referring to allies
like China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and the UAE. "I am the last
person, along with Field Marshal Asim Munir, to carry this (economic)
burden anymore on our shoulders."

The statement underlines [Pakistan's]{.underline} [[hope of using **US
diplomatic capital**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and Trump's personal
ambition --- [[to]{.mark} **[ease regional pressure]{.mark}** while
**[seeking broader dialogue]{.mark}** with India.]{.underline}

Government]{.underline} has begun to put a [[**greater focus**
on]{.mark} **U.S. [Arctic]{.mark} policy**]{.underline} recognizing that
"The Arctic is no longer an emerging frontier, but is instead a region
of growing national importance," said Vice Admiral Linda Fagan,
Commander of U.S. Coast Guard Pacific Area. In June 2020, the Trump
Administration released its first presidential memorandum on the Arctic
titled "Safeguarding U.S. National Interests in the Arctic and Antarctic
Regions." This marks a significant step **in [crafting a
strategy]{.underline}** for the region, driven in part, by the desire
[to push back against the expansion of Russian and Chinese]{.underline}
influence and **[military]{.underline} [force]{.underline}
[projection]{.underline}** in the region, as outlined in the 2018 U.S.
National Security Strategy and in the Pentagon's June 2019 Department of
Defense Arctic Strategy \[51\].

The devised plan calls for the launch of three heavy icebreakers by 2029
and the establishment of two domestic and two international support
bases \[52\]. While the [U.S. government]{.underline} is beginning to
[[take]{.mark} [more]{.mark}]{.underline} of a **[[strategic
focus]{.underline}]{.mark}** on devising and implementing policies to
govern and protect U.S. national interests, the presidential memorandum
highlights the [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} current [[Arctic
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} as being **[[overwhelmingly
military]{.underline}]{.mark}** in focus and catching up with Arctic
competitors, namely China and Russia, although each bring a different
threat level to the Arctic region and U.S. interests \[53\]. Therefore,
there is much work to be done by the [U.S. policymakers]{.underline} to
[[**divert resources** and **attention**]{.underline}]{.mark} to
anticipate all threats (both military and non-military), as well as
streamline the necessary working [to patch security weaknesses and
promote stability]{.underline} and rule-based order by
**[[investing]{.underline}]{.mark}** in **[[diplomatic]{.mark}

Stakeholders identified five factors that facilitated and five factors
that hindered the federal government's management of U.S. Arctic

factors that [[facilitated]{.underline}]{.mark} its

Stakeholders identified three factors pertaining to State's structures
that facilitated and two factors that hindered State's management of
U.S. Arctic priorities. For example, stakeholders identified continuity
within the Senior Arctic Official position and supporting office as a
factor that has deepened **[[institutional

some stakeholders identified **[[gaps in

identified elements [State]{.underline} and the new Ambassador should

elements include consistency in position and title, a formalized office

Nuclear War." Scientific American.
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/india-and-pakistan-remind-us-we-need-to-stop-the-risk-of-nuclear-war;
mgm\]

We are living in a scary time. After a terrorist attack that killed at
least 26 people, mostly Indian tourists, in Kashmir in April,
[[India]{.underline}]{.mark} blamed the attack on
[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, threatened to cut off that nation's
water supplies and followed up in May with [airstrikes]{.underline}.
[Pakistan]{.underline} has promised a "measured but [forceful
response]{.underline}," [[threatening]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[wider war
**endangering everyone**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

India and Pakistan each have about 170 nuclear weapons. A [[**nuclear
war**]{.mark} between India and Pakistan would [produce]{.mark}
**[smoke]{.mark}** from **fires** in **cities** and **industrial**
**areas**]{.underline}. That smoke would [[rise into the
**stratosphere**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the atmospheric layer above the
troposphere where we live, which has [no rain to wash out the
smoke]{.underline}. Our research has found that the [[smoke]{.mark}
would **[block out the sun]{.mark}, making it [cold]{.mark}**,
**[dark]{.mark}** and **[dry]{.mark}** at **Earth's** **surface**,
[choking ag]{.mark}riculture]{.underline} for five years or more [around
the world]{.underline}. The result would be **[[global
famine.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Like it or not, [humanity]{.underline} still has a [**nuclear**
**dagger** pointed at its throat]{.underline}. But there is another
choice that starts with the U.S. If we take our land-based missiles off
their hair-trigger alerts and negotiate with Russia to reduce our
nuclear arsenal, we could set an example for the rest of the world. If
we eventually sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the
U.S. could provide an example to Iran and other nations with an interest
in building their own nuclear arsenal.

The alternatives are terrifying. One of us (Robock) published an article
in Scientific American 15 years ago describing how a
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark} in South Asia, like the one now possible
[[between]{.underline}]{.mark} [[India and
Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, could [[produce]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[**global** **climate** **change**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark} the world's [[food supply]{.mark},
but]{.underline} we did not know how **[large]{.underline}** that
**[threat]{.underline}** would be. In the years since then we have
calculated, for a range of smoke amounts released from nuclear war, the
specific effects on agriculture in each nation. From there, we estimated
how the people would fare under the assumption that their stored food
was gone, trade was halted, and they kept the same agricultural
activity. A [nuclear war between India and Pakistan]{.underline} could
[kill]{.underline} one to [**two billion** people]{.underline} through
starvation [in]{.underline} the [two years]{.underline} after the war.

The U.S. and Russia have more than 8,000 nuclear weapons. A nuclear war
between the U.S. and Russia could kill more than six billion people
around the world in the following two years. The direct impacts of
blast, radiation and fire on those attacked by nuclear weapons would be
horrific, as we know from what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during
World War II, but 10 to 20 times more people would die from famine.

Many people assume that there will never be another nuclear war, since
it has now been 80 years and several generations since the last one.
They also have been told that nuclear deterrence must be maintained to
keep us safe. Yet threats to use nuclear weapons from Russia and North
Korea, and even from the U.S. president, have worried many. The New
START treaty, the only remaining arms control agreement between the U.S.
and Russia, expires next year. China is rapidly increasing its nuclear
arsenal.

President Trump just proposed a budget for the next fiscal year with a
13 percent increase for the Defense Department. This is exactly the
wrong direction for the U.S. A substantial part of the defense budget is
for a "modernization" of our nuclear arsenal. Our nuclear "triad" is
composed of land-based missiles, submarine missiles and nuclear bombs
that could be dropped from airplanes. We already have all of these, and
they cannot be used without the risk of killing almost all the people on
the planet. They need to be removed, not modernized.

Deterrence is a myth. The theory is that we will not be attacked because
we will attack an enemy if they attack us, thus deterring them. But in
order for it to work, they have to believe that we will act as a suicide
bomber. That is, that we will attack an enemy, producing so much smoke
that we will be unable to grow any crops for more than five years and
thus all starve to death. This is not mutual assured destruction (the
so-called "MAD" theory). It is self-assured destruction (SAD).

The upcoming Independent Study on Potential Environmental Effects of
Nuclear War, a report from the U.S. National Academies of Science,
Engineering, and Medicine due out this summer, the first such report
since 1985, will make this danger more plain.

The rest of the world well understands the risk we all face. In 2017,
after three international conferences on the humanitarian consequences
of the use of nuclear weapons, including the indirect effects on food
supply based on our work, the United Nations passed the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which prohibits possession, manufacture,
development and testing of nuclear weapons, stationing and installment
of nuclear weapons or assistance in such activities, by its parties. The
treaty came into force on January 22, 2021. There are currently 94
signatories and 73 states parties, but the nine countries, notably
including the U.S., with nuclear weapons have not signed it and are
trying to ignore the will of the rest of world.

The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), which led
the effort to get this treaty, was awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize
"for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian
consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking
efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons."

For deterrence to succeed, there must be no use of nuclear weapons by
accident, terrorists, computer malfunctions, hackers or unstable
leaders. We have come close many times. As Beatrice Fihn, executive
director of ICAN, said in her Nobel Peace Prize Lecture on December 10,
2017, "If only a small fraction of today's nuclear weapons were used,
[[soot]{.mark} and [smoke]{.mark}]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the
[firestorms]{.underline} would loft high into the atmosphere---cooling,
[darkening]{.underline} and [drying]{.underline} the [Earth's surface
for more than a decade]{.underline}. It would [**[obliterate food
crops]{.mark}**, putting [**billions**]{.mark} at risk of
[starv]{.mark}ation]{.underline}. Yet we continue to live in denial of
this **[[existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**.... The story of
nuclear weapons will have an ending, and it is up to us what that ending
will be. Will it be the end of [nuclear weapons]{.underline}, or will it
be [**[the]{.underline}** **[end of us]{.underline}**]{.mark}? One of
these things will happen. The only rational course of action is to cease
living under the conditions where our mutual destruction is only one
impulsive tantrum away."

#### U.S. [diplomatic choreography]{.underline} facilitates Pakistani mediation now---they're [uniquely capable]{.underline}, but only in partnership with the U.S.

**Iqbal '6/22** \[Anwar; June 22, 2025. Washington Correspondent at Dawn

WASHINGTON: As Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir
concluded his four-day visit to the **[[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** on Friday, the **[[diplomatic
choreography]{.underline}]{.mark}** surrounding the trip offered fresh
clues to a quiet realignment in US-Pakistan relations --- and
[signaled]{.underline} [**Washington's** interest in [assigning]{.mark}
[**Islamabad** a new]{.mark} regional [role]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[Trump]{.mark} administration]{.underline}, which welcomed Field
Marshal Munir with uncharacteristic warmth, appears to [[want Pakistan
to act as]{.mark} a]{.underline} potential [**[peacemaker]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the **ongoing [Iran-Israel]{.mark} conflict**]{.underline}.
President Trump hinted at this during a White House luncheon, saying
[[Pakistanis "**know Iran** ]{.mark}**better than most**"]{.underline}
and noting they were "[**[not bad with Israel]{.mark}"**
either**.**]{.underline}

The [[COAS]{.mark}']{.underline} [next stop --- Turkiye]{.underline} ---
added weight to this emerging role. He [flew directly]{.underline} from
Washington [to [attend]{.mark} an Organisation of [Islamic
Cooperation]{.mark} (OIC) [conference on]{.mark} the
Iran-[Israel]{.mark} crisis]{.underline}, underscoring Pakistan's
willingness to be seen as a regional stabiliser.

Diplomatic sources in Washington say that while **[[Pakistan]{.mark} is
[expected to engage]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark}, the **[[Trump]{.mark} administration
[will deal with Israel]{.mark}]{.underline}** as Islamabad does not
recognise the Jewish state.

Field Marshal Munir's tour marked the highest-level engagement between
the Pakistani military and the Trump administration since Trump's
emphatic 2024 return to the White House.

His itinerary included [**[strategic meetings]{.mark}** at the Pentagon
and Capitol Hill]{.underline}, culminating in a private luncheon in the
White House Cabinet Room --- **[[hosted]{.underline}]{.mark} [personally
[by]{.mark} President [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such an honor is
rarely extended to foreign military officials, typically being reserved
for visiting heads of government.

After the White House lunch, Pakistani officials were content enough to
drop certain items from the remaining schedule. "We were heard in
Washington's most powerful room," one official said. "That was the
message we wanted to carry home."

The army chief's [[**discussions** with **senior US
officials**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- including [Secretary of
State]{.underline} Marco [[Rubio and]{.mark} Trump's **Iran negotiator**
Steve [Witkoff]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[covered]{.underline}]{.mark}
familiar terrain: **[regional [security]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
counter-terrorism, and [[strategic cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}. But
it was the optics --- especially the White House invitation --- that
signaled a [[**dramatic thaw** after]{.underline}]{.mark} years of
**[[diplomatic chill.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The visit followed a tense India-Pakistan standoff in May, which Trump
claims he helped defuse --- though New Delhi has denied any outside
role. More broadly, it unfolded against a backdrop of rising tensions in
the Middle East, where Israel's strikes against Iran have roiled the
region. [**[Pakistan's]{.mark} concurrent [ties]{.mark}** [with]{.mark}
both [**Tehran** and **Riyadh** position it **uniquely to

WASHINGTON (AP) --- The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration on
Sunday [**signaled** a **willingness** to [**renew talks** with
**Iran**]{.mark} and **[avoid]{.mark} a [prolonged]{.mark}**
[**war**]{.mark} in the aftermath of a surprise attack]{.underline} on
three of the country's nuclear sites as U.S. officials assessed Tehran's
nuclear ambitions and the threat of retaliation against American
interests.

The coordinated messaging by his vice president, Pentagon chief, top
military adviser and secretary of state suggested a confidence that any
fallout would be manageable and that [**[Iran's]{.mark} [lack of
military]{.mark}** [**capabilities**]{.mark} would ultimately [**force
it back to the bargaining table**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at a news conference that
[**[America "does not seek war]{.mark}**"]{.underline} with Iran while
Vice President JD Vance said the [[strikes]{.mark} have [give]{.mark}n
[Tehran]{.mark} the [**possibility** of]{.mark} **returning to
[negotiate with Washington]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

"This [mission was not and has not **been about regime
change**]{.underline}," Hegseth said.

President Donald Trump, who had addressed the nation from the White
House on Saturday night, returned to social media on Sunday to criticize
Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who had objected to the president taking
military action without specific congressional approval.

"We had a spectacular military success yesterday, taking the 'bomb'
right out of their hands (and they would use it if they could!)" Trump
said as part of the post on Truth Social.

At their joint Pentagon briefing, Hegseth and Air Force Gen. Dan Caine,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that "Operation Midnight
Hammer" involved decoys and deception, and met with no Iranian
resistance.

Caine indicated that the goal of the operation --- destroying nuclear
sites in Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan --- had been achieved.

"Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage
assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe
damage and destruction," Caine said.

Vance said in a television interview that while he would not discuss
"sensitive intelligence about what we've seen on the ground," he felt
"very confident that we've substantially delayed their development of a
nuclear weapon."

Pressed further, he told NBC's "Meet the Press" that "I think that we
have really pushed their program back by a very long time. I think that
it's going to be many many years before the Iranians are able to develop
a nuclear weapon."

The vice president said the U.S. had "negotiated aggressively' with Iran
to try to find a peaceful settlement and that Trump made his decision
after assessing the Iranians were not acting "in good faith."

"I actually think [it provides an [**opportunity** to]{.mark} **reset
this relationship**, [reset]{.mark} these **[negotiations]{.mark}** and
get us in a place where [Iran]{.mark} can [decide not to be a
threat]{.mark}]{.underline} to its neighbors, not to a threat to the
United States and if they're willing to do that, [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is **all ears**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Vance said.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on CBS's "Face the Nation" that
"there are [**no [planned military operations]{.mark}** right now
against Iran]{.underline}, unless, unless they mess around and they
attack" U.S. interests.

[[**Direct talks** between]{.mark} the **[U.S. and Iran]{.mark}** have
[not broken off]{.mark} since Israel launched its]{.underline}
preemptive [strike]{.underline} on the Islamic Republic last week,
Reuters reported on Thursday.

[U.S. Special Envoy]{.underline} to the Middle East Steve
[[Witkoff]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and]{.mark} Iranian
Foreign]{.underline} Minister Abbas [[Araqchi]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[spoken **several times**]{.mark} **by phone**]{.underline}, in an
attempt [[to de**-escalate** the]{.mark} aerial
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}, Reuters cited three diplomats as saying.

The Iranian diplomat maintained that Tehran will not return to the
negotiating table with regard to its nuclear program unless Jerusalem
halts its attacks.

Araqchi, according to one of the unnamed diplomats, told Witkoff that
[[Tehran]{.mark} "[could **show flexibility in**]{.mark} **the [nuclear
issue]{.mark}**]{.underline}["]{.mark} [if]{.underline} the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [**[pressured]{.mark}
[Israel]{.mark}** to end the war.]{.underline}

A European diplomat said, "Araqchi told Witkoff **[[Iran was ready
to]{.mark} come back to nuclear [talk]{.mark}s]{.underline}**, but it
could not if Israel continued its bombing," according to Reuters.

A second regional diplomat was quoted as saying that
[Washington]{.underline} was the one to [initiate a call]{.underline}
after Israel launched its surprise attack on June 13, adding that [[the
**U.S. offered a new proposal**]{.underline}]{.mark}, without disclosing
its details.

Meanwhile on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would make a
decision on whether to strike Iran or not "within the next two weeks."

A White House official was cited by CNN as saying on Thursday that the
president supports [[diplomatic efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} by European
envoys [[to **persuade Iran** to **accept Washington's**]{.mark}
**nuclear [dismantlement]{.mark} [proposal]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Foreign ministers from Britain, Germany and France were slated to hold
talks with Iranian representatives in Geneva on Friday, CNN reported.

The Europeans were informed of the details of Washington's proposal
offered to Tehran, the report added.

In an interview with Iranian state TV on Friday, however, Araqchi said
that "Iran will not enter into talks with any party as long as Israel's
attacks continue."

The "United States is complicit in Israeli aggression, even if it does
not directly participate," he added.

According to Reuters, the Iranian minister further denied targeting an
Israeli hospital in Beersheva, after the Soroka Medical Center sustained
a direct hit from an Iranian ballistic missile on Thursday.

"Iran never targets civilian areas, especially not hospitals, as opposed
to Israel, which has intentionally targeted hospitals in Gaza," Araqchi
was cited as saying.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar tweeted in response that "Iran is
misleading the world and simply trying to waste time. It has no
intention of giving up its nuclear program, which poses an existential
threat to Israel and endangers the entire world."

Nothing has changed.

If war is diplomacy by other means, [[**diplomacy** is **never
finished**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While [[Israel]{.mark} and
[Iran]{.mark} are]{.underline} [in the midst of what could be an
extended war that **[could spread]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the
[**possibility** of **[renewed talks]{.mark}** to deal with **Iran's
expanding nuclear program** [should **not** be
**discounted**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Negotiations are on hold while the war continues, and the future of
diplomacy is far from clear. Iran will feel compelled to respond to
Israel, and the Israeli campaign could last for days or weeks. For now
Washington does not appear to be doing anything to press both sides to
stop the violence and start talking again.

But the [[Iranians]{.underline}]{.mark} say they [**still [want
a]{.mark}** [deal, as does]{.mark} President
**[Trump]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The shape of future talks will
inevitably depend on when and how the fighting stops.

"We are **[[prepared for any agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}** aimed at
ensuring Iran does not pursue nuclear weapons," the [Iranian foreign
minister]{.underline}, Abbas Araghchi, told foreign diplomats in Tehran
on Sunday. But his country would not accept any deal that "deprives Iran
of its nuclear rights," he added, including the right to enrich uranium,
albeit at low levels that can be used for civilian purposes.

Mr. Araghchi said Israel did not attack to pre-empt Iran's race toward a
bomb, which Iran denies trying to develop, but to derail negotiations on
a deal that Mr. Netanyahu opposes.

The attacks are "an attempt to undermine diplomacy and derail
negotiations," he continued, a view shared by various Western analysts.
"It is entirely clear that the Israeli regime does not want any
agreement on the nuclear issue," he said. "It does not want negotiations
and does not seek diplomacy."

A group of men stands behind a podium and surrounding a man speaking
into a microphone.

Abbas Araghchi, Iran's foreign minister, center, in Lebanon this month.
On Sunday, he said that Iran remained open to negotiations on nuclear
weapons.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has argued that the attack
on Iran was to stop Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon, even as a
sixth round of talks to prevent that very outcome was scheduled between
the United States and Iran.

While Israel argues that it had to strike now to prevent an Iranian race
to bomb, American and European judgments were that Iran was still many
months away from building a bomb and has not yet decided to do so.

Mr. Netanyahu believes that a deal that would allow Iran to enrich
uranium would mean a nuclear-armed Iran in the future, and he has been
bent on preventing that outcome. He has apparently judged that a
U.S.-Iran deal would have kept him from his goal of destroying Iran's
nuclear program, and, perhaps, he hopes, bringing about the fall of the
Islamic Republic.

But Israel is considered highly unlikely to meet the goal of destroying
Iran's nuclear program without active American involvement, which [Mr.
[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} has so far resisted.

The **[president]{.underline}** continues to say that he **[[wants
negotiations to succeed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He seems to believe that
the [**[attack]{.mark}** will [**bring Iran back to the**
**table**]{.mark} in a weaker and more conciliatory
position]{.underline}, ready to accept his latest demand that it halt
all enrichment of uranium. But Iran insists that it has the right to
enrich for civilian uses under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.

Mr. Trump clearly sees the war as a form of diplomacy. On Friday, he
wrote: "Two months ago I gave Iran a 60-day ultimatum to 'make a deal.'
They should have done it! Today is day 61. I told them what to do, but
they just couldn't get there. Now they have, perhaps, a second chance!"

Early on Sunday, Mr. [**Trump** warned **Iran**]{.underline} against
attacking American forces in a message on Truth Social. "However, [[we
can **easily get a deal done**]{.mark} between Iran and Israel, and
**[end]{.mark}** this **bloody** **[conflict]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} he
said. Whether Israel would accept such a deal, if Iran is allowed to
enrich at all, is an open question.

At the same time, Mr. Trump, who has said he knew about the Israeli
attack beforehand, has done nothing in public to restrain the Israelis.
When Washington announced last week that the talks would continue on
Sunday, it is not clear whether it knew when Israel would attack, but
the Iranians are convinced that Washington was complicit in trying to
fool them into believing that any Israeli attack would come afterward.

A quick deal now that would give up enrichment would be seen as a
surrender, said Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of
Advanced International Studies who served in the State Department during
the Obama administration. That could make the Iranian government more
vulnerable at home. "They won't give up enrichment, not this easily," he
said. "They're not going to surrender."

For now negotiations with Iran are on hold, said Robert Malley, a former
U.S. official who negotiated with Iran on the nuclear issue under
President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But their future shape and timing will
depend on the length of the Israeli attack and what it achieves.

"When Iran feels comfortable to come back to the table with the United
States, which it believes is deeply complicit with the attack, and in
what position Iran comes back depends on how significantly Israel has
degraded its nuclear program," he said.

For now, Washington is backing the Israeli operations, but "at some
point, better sooner than later, they will try to exercise some
restraint" to limit the conflict, Mr. Malley said. Mr. Trump still seems
eager to get a deal and avoid being dragged into the war.

Karin von Hippel, a former State Department official and former director
of RUSI, the London-based defense research group, agrees. "[We'll **get
back to the table eventually**]{.underline} **but** at what cost to
Israel and the region?" she said. "The challenge is going to be that the
Iranians want a face-saving way to get back to the table," while Mr.
Trump prefers "to back people to the edge and get them to capitulate."

Unless the Iranian government collapses --- or Israel tries to kill the
political and clerical leadership of Iran, as it did with Hezbollah ---
any deal is likely to be very similar to the original 2015 nuclear pact
negotiated under President Barack Obama, and which Mr. Trump, in his
first term, abandoned in 2018.

"It will probably be a very similar deal as the one with Obama, but
Trump will want to put his own spin on it," Ms. von Hippel said. "Trump
can declare victory no matter what. And if the deal has enough
safeguards on Iran he can get away with it," she said, even if some
Republicans and Israel criticize it for not ending Iran's enrichment
altogether.

Mr. Trump has miscalculated in thinking Israel's attack would force Iran
to accept a deal based on zero enrichment, said Rajan Menon, professor
emeritus of international relations at the City College of New York, in
an email post and an article in The New Statesman. Mr. Trump is unlikely
to miscalculate again and join Israel's war, but "this much is certain:
Netanyahu wanted to scuttle the U.S.-Iran negotiation, and he has
succeeded," Mr. Menon said, at least for now.

[But **[Iran]{.mark} clearly [wants]{.mark}** to **come back to
[negotiations]{.mark}**, since a [deal]{.mark} is still the **[best
protection]{.mark}** it has from **continuing** or **subsequent**
Israeli attacks on a country that has lost most of its own air
defenses]{.underline} and has [limited ways of striking Israeli
territory.]{.underline}

Even if the government is not about to fall, it is weakened and at
profound risk, for the first time since Iraq and Saddam Hussein invaded
in 1980, said Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert and director of the
foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution.

A pathway to a deal is unclear for now, but the
[[Iranians]{.underline}]{.mark} must still [[consider
diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} as "[the best way [to extricate]{.mark}
themselves [from]{.mark} what is an **[existential
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}**,"** she said.

There will inevitably be a sharp debate inside the Iranian regime about
whether to accept a diplomatic solution out of weakness or to continue
to try to strike back and even race for a nuclear weapon, Mr. Malley
said.

The **[[alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of course, [[include
**widening the war**]{.mark} by **[damaging]{.mark} regional energy**
**[assets]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf,
[closing]{.mark} the **Strait of [Hormuz]{.mark}** to shipping,
[assaulting **institutions**]{.mark} and even **synagogues** abroad or
**[attacking American troops]{.mark}** and **interests** in the
region]{.underline}. But there is probably **[no surer way of [bringing
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [into the war]{.mark},]{.underline}**
which Mr. Netanyahu deeply desires.

For their part, the Europeans who were instrumental in the 2015 nuclear
deal, and who have been sidelined by Mr. Trump, say they are ready to
hold talks with Iran on its nuclear program. "I hope that's still
possible," the German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, said late
Saturday in Oman. "Germany, together with France and Britain, are
ready," he told the German broadcaster ARD.

Iran must never have a nuclear weapon, he said, but other than wanting
the violence to end, he indicated no European move to pressure either
side to desist. "[There's a [**shared expectation**]{.mark} that [within
the **next** **week**]{.mark}, a **[serious attempt]{.mark}** must be
[**made on both sides** to **interrupt** the **spiral of
violence**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

#### Talks coming [now]{.underline} but requires diplomatic initiative---otherwise, [escalaiton]{.underline}.

Nuclear Deal, Ceasefire." Axios.

mgm\]

The [**White House** is **discussing** with **Iran** the **possibility
of a meeting this week** between **U.S. envoy** Steve Witkoff and
**Iranian Foreign Minister** Abbas Araghchi]{.underline}, according to
four sources briefed on the issue.

The objective would be to [discuss a **diplomatic initiative** involving
a **nuclear deal** and an **end to the war between Israel and
Iran**]{.underline}**.**

Why it matters: The [**meeting hasn\'t been finalized** yet, but it is
part of a **last-ditch effort** by President **Trump** to **swerve away
from** war and back toward **dealmaking**.]{.underline}

\"A [**meeting** with the Iranians this week is **under
consideration**,\" a U**.S. official confirmed**.]{.underline}

[The **meeting could be a make-or-break moment** for the question of
whether the U.**S. will join the war** in order to eliminate Iran\'s
nuclear program militarily.]{.underline}

The latest: Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday morning
that he may send Witkoff and Vice President Vance to meet the Iranians
but stressed it depends what happens when he gets back to Washington.

Trump stressed he is \"not too much in the mood to negotiate\" with Iran
and is not looking for a ceasefire. \"We\'re looking at better than a
ceasefire\...an end, [a real end,]{.underline} not a ceasefire, a real
end.\"

He later explained that he is looking for as a \"complete give-up\" by
Iran.

Trump warned Iran against targeting U.S. forces and interests in the
region. \"We will come down so hard if they do anything to our people,
it\'d be gloves off. \... I think they know not to touch our troops,\"
he said.

Zoom in: Trump sees the massive bunker busters needed to destroy Iran\'s
underground enrichment facility at Fordow --- which the U.S. has and
Israel does not --- as a key point of leverage to get Iran to cut a
deal, a senior U.S. official said.

Describing the decision on bunker busters as an \"inflection point,\"
the official said Trump \"thinks in terms of deals and leverage. And
this is leverage.\"

\"**[They do want to talk]{.underline}**,\" the senior official
continued. \"But what we don\'t know is, \'have they been brought to
their knees fully so that they realize that in order to have a country,
they have to talk?\' And assuming they get there, is there any degree of
enrichment you would allow them to have?\"

State of play: Trump has so far declined to directly participate in
Israel\'s attacks on Iran, but he has made clear that Iran must be
prevented from obtaining a nuclear weapon one way or another.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is pushing him to join the war
and bomb Fordow.

[Trump]{.underline} has continued to [insist]{.underline} he believes
[he can make a deal, particularly **given Iran\'s weak negotiating
position.**]{.underline}

Driving the news: Trump shocked the Middle East with a Truth Social post
on Monday night in which he called on Iranian civilians to evacuate
Tehran immediately.

Shortly thereafter, Trump dcut short his trip to the G7 summit in Canada
to return to Washington and focus on the war.

These two moves, together with reports of explosions in Tehran, led to
reports in the Israelis press and on social media that the U.S. had
joined the war.

White House spokesperson Alex Pfeiffer denied the reports. \"American
forces are maintaining their defensive posture, and that has not
changed. We will defend American interests,\" he wrote on X.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reiterated that message in an interview
on Fox News and stressed Trump is still seeking a deal. \"President
Trump hopes there will be peace,\" he said.

Behind the scenes: The Trump administration discussed the meeting
proposal with Iran on Monday, the sources said.

\"We are talking on the phone but it is better to talk in person,\"
Trump said at the G7.

Trump expressed hope that Iran would agree to make a deal. \"[I think a
**deal will be signed**. I think **Iran is foolish not to sign**
**one**,\"]{.underline} he said.

DUBAI, June 16 (Reuters) - Tehran has asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman
to press U.S. President Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** to use [his
**influence** **on Israel** to agree to an **immediate ceasefire** with
**Iran**]{.underline} in return for Iranian flexibility in nuclear
negotiations, two Iranian and three regional sources told Reuters on
Monday.

Gulf leaders and their top [diplomats worked]{.underline} the phones
[all weekend,]{.underline} [speaking to]{.underline} each other, to
[**Tehran**, **Washington**]{.underline} and beyond in an effort [to
prevent a widening of the **biggest ever confrontation**]{.underline}
between longstanding enemies Israel and Iran.

[Iran is willing **to be flexible** in the **nuclear
talks**]{.underline} [if a ceasefire is reached]{.underline}, one of the
Iranian sources said.

The Gulf states are [deeply concerned the conflict will **spin out of
control**]{.underline}, a Gulf source close to government officials told
Reuters.

Qatar, Oman and Saudi Arabia have all [appealed to **Washington** to
**press Israel** to **agree to a ceasefire** and to resume talks with
Tehran]{.underline} towards a nuclear deal, the Gulf source said.

A regional source and an official briefed on Iran\'s communications with
the Gulf said Tehran had reached out to Qatar and Oman to mediate a
return to nuclear talks, but insisted that a ceasefire with Israel be
put in place first.

Iran made clear to Oman and Qatar that it would not negotiate while it
is under attack and will only begin serious negotiations once it has
finished responding to Israeli strikes, the official said.

Iran\'s foreign ministry was not immediately available to respond to
Reuters\' request for comment. Qatar\'s foreign ministry, Oman\'s
ministry of information, Saudi Arabia\'s international media office, the
White House and the U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to
requests for comment.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\'s office did not respond to a
request for comment.

When asked if a diplomatic mechanism was being worked out to end the
campaign, Israeli National Security Adviser Tzachi Hanegbi told Army
Radio on Monday: \"It is a little early for that. You don\'t go to war
and look to end it three days later.\"

Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran on Friday morning that wiped
out the top echelon of Iran\'s military command and damaged its nuclear
sites, and says the campaign will continue to escalate with the stated
goal of eliminating Tehran\'s ability to develop a nuclear weapon.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is civilian, not military.

**[PUSH TO RESUME TALKS]{.underline}**

Yet absent Iranian escalation, an extended air campaign comes with risks
for [[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}. It has not yet lost an aircraft, but
the [high-tempo long-range sorties are still **expensive** and
**risky**]{.underline}. [**The [maximalist aim]{.mark}**, of pushing for
**regime change,** which Mr Netanyahu has flirted with]{.underline}
several times during the war, [is **[no longer his call]{.mark} to
make**]{.underline}. And there is another factor to consider: the
relationship between America and Israel which has just been transformed.

[[America]{.mark} has [given]{.mark} the Jewish state [unending
support]{.mark}, **military** and **diplomatic**,]{.underline} over the
decades and Mr Trump's administration was already invested [in
**Israel's defence** with **[THAAD]{.mark}** **missile**
**[batteries]{.mark}**, backed up by US **[Navy destroyers]{.mark}** and
a network of **[surveillance satellites]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Nonetheless he is the [first **American president** to have struck
another country's nuclear sites,]{.underline} and the first to have
[**overtly joined** Israel in an attack on an adversary.]{.underline}

That [[**comes** with a price for]{.mark} Israel and Mr
**[Netanyahu]{.mark}**]{.underline}: while the countries are partners in
a war **[[it is clear who the senior partner is]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Mr **[Trump]{.mark}**, having crossed a Rubicon on Iran,]{.underline}
may be **[[eager to prove]{.mark} to the world [he can]{.mark} also [be
a peacemaker]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even at this unprecedented moment,
the Americans insisted that their operation remained separate. [Israel
received only a brief advance notice]{.underline}, to make sure its
aircraft weren't in the strike areas. Its fighter-jets have won air
superiority over Iran, but America conducted a sweep with its own
fighters before the bombers arrived. [It was a **clear [reminder of the
pecking order]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[After having **invested in Israel's security more than any
president**]{.mark}, Mr [Trump]{.mark} also [has a **degree of leverage
none** of his predecessors enjoyed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Should he
choose, **[[he could call time on Israel's]{.mark} air [campaign against
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the war in Gaza, now in its 21st month.
For better or worse, **[[America]{.mark}'s president now [owns Israel's
war.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Mr. Trump had at one point encouraged his Middle East envoy, Steve
Witkoff, and possibly Vice President JD Vance, to offer to meet the
Iranians, according to a U.S. official. But on Monday Mr. Trump posted
on social media that "everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran,"
hardly a sign of diplomatic progress.

Mr. Trump also said on Monday that "I think
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**basically** is [at the **negotiating
table**]{.mark}**,** they want to make a deal]{.underline}."

The urgency appeared to be rising. The White House announced late on
Monday that Mr. Trump was leaving the Group of 7 summit early because of
the situation in the Middle East.

"As soon as I leave here, we're going to be doing something," Mr. Trump
said. "But I have to leave here."

What he intended to do remained unclear.

If Mr. Vance and Mr. Witkoff did meet with the Iranians, officials say,
the likely Iranian interlocutor would be the country's foreign minister,
Abbas Araghchi, who played a key role in the 2015 nuclear deal with the
Obama administration and knows every element of Iran's sprawling nuclear
complex. Mr. Araghchi, who has been Mr. Witkoff's counterpart in recent
negotiations, signaled his openness to a deal on Monday, saying in a
statement, "If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested
in stopping this war, next steps are consequential."

"[[It]{.underline} [takes **one phone call** from **Washington** to
**muzzle**]{.underline}]{.mark} someone like
**[[Netanyahu]{.underline}]{.mark}**," he said, referring to Benjamin
Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister. "[That may [**pave the way for a
return to diplomacy**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

But if that diplomatic effort fizzles, or the Iranians remain unwilling
to give in to Mr. Trump's central demand that they must ultimately end
all uranium enrichment on Iranian soil, the president will still have
the option of ordering that Fordo and other nuclear facilities be
destroyed.

There is only one weapon for the job, experts contend. It is called the
Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or the GBU-57, and it weighs so much ---
30,000 pounds --- that it can be lifted only by a B-2 bomber. Israel
does not own either the weapon or the bomber needed to get it aloft and
over target.

[[If]{.mark} Mr. **[Trump holds back]{.mark},** it could well mean that
**[Israel's main objective]{.mark}** in the war is **[never
completed]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

#### Leaders confirm Israel's willing to negotiate---attacks are to build [leverage]{.underline}.

Mark Dubowitz, chief executive at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies think tank in Washington, said he believed
**[Trump]{.underline}** ultimately **[wanted a diplomatic]{.underline}
[solution]{.underline}** but he was likely to [allow Israel more time to
pursue its military campaign to give the U.S. **more leverage at the
negotiating table**]{.underline}.

Dubowitz, an Iran expert who has been consulted by the Trump
administration on its policy, said Israel\'s main objective appears to
be setting back Iran\'s nuclear program as many years as possible.
Central to that is removing its human capacity by killing nuclear and
weapons scientists, and Dubowitz said his team had identified 10 to 12
more who are likely being hunted by Israel.

Meanwhile, Israel\'s opposition parties -- and the public -- have
rallied behind Netanyahu, giving him leeway to pursue the difficult
operation, despite Iranian missiles hitting Israeli soil. Israel is
operating 1,500--2,000 km from home, with complex and costly logistical
needs.

\"This is math,\" said one Israeli source. \"How many missiles they
launch. How many we destroy. How long we can keep going.\"

The Israeli strikes have already killed key members of the so-called
\"weaponisation group\" - those Israel alleges are tasked with turning
enriched uranium into an actual bomb -- and eroded Iran\'s ability to
produce long-range missiles.

[That]{.underline}, [Israeli leaders argue, creates the conditions for a
**U.S.-Iran agreement that addresses Israel's red lines**.]{.underline}

Yuli Edelstein, **[head of the Israeli parliament\'s Foreign
Affairs]{.underline}** and Defence Committee, and a prominent member of
the ruling Likud party, [told Reuters]{.underline} that [if
Washington]{.underline} and key European powers [**engage

\"they can **prevent unnecessary** developments in this
war.\"]{.underline}

AMY GOODMAN: Orly, I want to bring Ali Vaez in before he has to leave.
And, Ali, I wanted to go to G7, because it looks like world [leaders are
trying to put **pressure on Netanyahu** to stop the
attacks]{.underline}. It is unclear exactly where Trump stands, who's
with them in Calgary, in Canada, since he has expressed both sides on
this. Talk about this, what **[the U.S.]{.underline}** needs to do right
now, who [clearly]{.underline}, [everyone acknowledges, has the **only
lever of power** that can be **exerted over Netanyahu.**]{.underline}

ALI VAEZ: That's correct. President [**Trump** is the **only world
leader** who can **stop this cycle of escalation** from expanding into a
much more disastrous regional conflagration]{.underline}, with direct
costs for the United States and him as president, because if he gets
engaged, and if there are American fatalities and casualties, if the
price of energy markets, global energy markets, increase in the next few
days, all of it would backfire on him politically, and especially with
his MAGA base, that is deeply opposed to any additional U.S. military
entanglements in that part of the world, especially if it's aimed at
regime change.

Now, the way he needs to tackle this is to --- first, he needs to create
distance with Israel, because there is no way that the Iranians would go
back to the negotiating table and take him seriously if they are seen as
him playing a double game here. And the only way he can do that is [to
**use the leverage**]{.underline} that you mentioned, which is the
provision of offensive weapons to Israel. I think he can still stand
next to Israel in defense of Israel, but he has to
[threaten]{.underline} that if [Netanyahu]{.underline} continues this
war, which endangers the 40,000 American troops in the Persian Gulf
region and hundreds of thousands of Americans who live in Israel, that
[he would **pull the plug**]{.underline} on Netanyahu's ability to
further escalate this conflict.

And then he needs to turn to the Iranians and do two things. One is to
also threaten the Iranians that if they keep fighting, the U.S. would
get involved. That is exactly what ended the Iran-Iraq War in 1988. The
U.S. intervened in that conflict, and that was a huge part of Iranian
calculus to agree to a ceasefire. And he also has to simultaneously [put
an offer on the table, a nuclear **deal that is
reasonable**]{.underline}, that is not one-sided, that includes generous
sanctions relief, so that the Iranians, with all the mistrust, start
seeing in him as somebody who's really more interested in deal-making
rather than double dealing here.

Although the conflict may further weaken Iran, deterring a nuclear
breakout remains complex. Historical precedent from Iraq and elsewhere
shows that [airpower]{.underline} alone [cannot dismantle a large,

[this]{.underline}---**[National Security Advisor]{.underline}** Tzachi
Hanegbi recently [acknowledged that **only negotiations** have
**dismantled nuclear programs** in the past]{.underline} (see South
Africa and Libya). Thus, one **[Israeli objective]{.underline}** may be
[to **impose sufficient costs** on Iran to **induce a return to
negotiations** so that talks can resume under **more favorable
terms**]{.underline}, as Tehran will be in even greater need of
post-conflict sanctions relief to preserve regime stability and carry
out reconstruction.

diplomacy in American foreign policy. In less than three months, he
[initiated **bold diplomatic overtures** to all three of Washington's

intends to renegotiate the balance of benefits and burdens in
Washington's alliances to ensure greater reciprocity.

Trump's opening moves have drawn howls of protest and prompted
accusations of appeasement. But [the fact is that Washington was in
**dire need** of a **new kind of diplomacy.**]{.underline} After the end
of the Cold War, the United States moved away from using negotiations to
promote the national interest. Convinced that history had ended and that
they could remake the world in America's image, [successive U.S.
presidents **came to rely on military** and **economic force** as the
primary tools of foreign policy]{.underline}. When they did use
diplomacy, it was usually not to enhance U.S. power but to try to build
a global paradise in which multilateral institutions would supplant
countries and banish war entirely.

For a time, the United States could get away with such negligence. In
the 1990s and the early years of this century, Washington was so
powerful that it could achieve its aims without old-fashioned diplomacy.
But those days are gone. The United States no longer possesses a
military that is capable of fighting and defeating all its foes
simultaneously. It cannot drive another great power to ruin through
sanctions. Instead, it lives in a world of continent-size rivals with
formidable economies and militaries. Great-power war, absent for
decades, is again a real possibility.

In this dangerous setting, [the United States will need to rediscover
diplomacy in its classical form]{.underline}---not as a bag carrier for
an all-powerful military or as a purveyor of global norms, but [as a
**hard-nosed instrument** of strategy]{.underline}. For millennia, great
powers have used diplomacy in this way to forestall conflict, recruit
new partners, and splinter enemy coalitions. The United States must take
a similar path, using talks and deals to limit its own burdens,
constrain its enemies, and recalibrate regional balances of power. And
that requires engaging with rivals and reworking alliances so that
Washington does not need to take the lead in confronting Beijing and
Moscow simultaneously.

[Talking with **China** and **Russia** and insisting on **reciprocity**
from friends is therefore **necessary**]{.underline}. If done right, it
could [help manage the gaps between the United States' finite means and
the virtually infinite threats arrayed against it,]{.underline}
something many other great powers have [use]{.underline}d **[diplomacy
to accomplish]{.underline}.** Indeed, the essence of diplomacy in
strategy is to rearrange power in space and time so that countries avoid
tests of strength beyond their ability. There is no magic formula for
how to get this right, and there is no guarantee that Trump's approach
will succeed. But the alternative---attempting to overpower
everybody---is not viable, and a good deal riskier. In other words,
[**strategic diplomacy** is **the best shot** **America** has at shoring
up its position for protracted competition.]{.underline}

ANCIENT WISDOM

In the summer of 432 BC, the leaders of Sparta gathered to consider
whether to go to war with Athens. For months, tensions had been building
between the two city-states as the Athenians clashed with Sparta's
friends and the Spartans sat idly by. Now a group of hawks, egged on by
the allies, were eager for action.

But Archidamus II, Sparta's aging king, suggested something different:
diplomacy. Talks, Archidamus told the assembly, could forestall conflict
while Sparta worked to make new allies and strengthen its hand
domestically.

I do bid you not to take up arms at once, but to send and remonstrate
with \[the Athenians\] in a tone not too suggestive of war, nor again
too suggestive of submission, and to employ the interval in perfecting
our own preparations. The means will be, first, the acquisition of
allies, Hellenic or barbarian it matters not . . . \[,\] and secondly,
the development of our home resources. If they listen to our embassy, so
much the better; but if not, after the lapse of two or three years our
position will have become materially strengthened. . . . Perhaps by that
time the sight of our preparations, backed by language equally
significant will have disposed \[the Athenians\] to submission, while
their land is still untouched, and while their counsels may be directed
to the retention of advantages as yet undestroyed.

At first, Archidamus's address did not sway the assembly; the Spartans
voted for war. But in the weeks that followed, the city realized it was
unready for battle, and the old man's wisdom sank in. Sparta sent envoys
far and wide to slow the rush to war and pull other city-states to its
side. When war came a year later, Sparta was in a better position to
wage it. And when Sparta triumphed two decades later, it was not because
it had the better army but because it had assembled a bigger and better
array of allies---including an old archenemy, Persia---than did Athens.

Archidamus's suggestions have worked for countless other great powers
over the centuries. Consider, first, using diplomacy to buy time and
prepare for war. When new barbarian tribes appeared, the Romans, the
Byzantines, and the Song dynasty all made it a practice to send envoys
in an effort to buy time for replenishing armories and granaries. The
Roman Emperor Domitian struck a truce with the Dacians that allowed Rome
to recollect its strengths until a new emperor, Trajan, was ready for
war a decade later. Venice brokered a long peace with the Ottomans after
the fall of Constantinople to beef up its fleets and fortresses. And the
French chief minister Cardinal Richelieu used diplomacy to stall with
Spain for nearly a decade so that France could mobilize.

Archidamus's next suggestion---form alliances to constrain the enemy's
options---has been similarly enduring. The French kings allied with the
heretic Lutherans and infidel Ottomans to restrict their fellow Catholic
Habsburgs. The Habsburgs allied with the Bourbons to constrain the
Prussians. Edwardian Britain cooperated with its colonial rivals France
and Russia to join forces against imperial Germany.

In each of these cases, success meant cultivating favorable balances of
power in critical regions. This is perhaps the core purpose of strategic
diplomacy---and what allows countries to project power far beyond their
material capabilities. The Vienna system engineered by Austrian Foreign
Minister (and later Chancellor) Klemens von Metternich used the balance
of power to extend his empire's position as a great power well beyond
its natural lifespan. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck pulled off a
similar feat in the late nineteenth century. By cutting deals with
Austria, Russia, and the United Kingdom, he was able to isolate France
and avoid a two-front war that might have strangled the German empire in
its infancy.

These leaders never tried to forge partnerships based on anything other
than shared interests. They did not believe they could transform hostile
countries into friendly ones through logic and reason. They certainly
never believed that diplomacy could overcome irreconcilable visions of
how the world should be. Their goal was to limit rivals' options, not
seek to remove the sources of conflict. Departing from that logic can
lead to catastrophe, as occurred when British Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain met with German leader Adolf Hitler in 1938. Rather than use
diplomacy to amplify the domestic and international constraints on
Hitler, Chamberlain weakened them by giving him what he wanted in hopes
that German expansionism would then cease. Doing so emboldened Berlin
and paved the way for World War II.

The United States made a similar mistake in the 1990s. Instead of trying
to constrain a rising Beijing after the Soviet Union fell, Washington
used commercial diplomacy to remove the barriers constraining Chinese
economic expansion. U.S. officials negotiated Beijing's accession to the
World Trade Organization and opened U.S. markets to Chinese companies.
Doing so, Washington thought, would transform China into a liberal
democracy. But instead, Beijing exploited this opening to consolidate
control, get rich, and gain the economic upper hand over other
countries. Today, China's manufacturing dominance is so profound that
even the American military is dependent on many Chinese-made products.
As a result, Washington's options would be greatly constrained during a
war with Beijing.

DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR

The American post--Cold War approach to China came about because U.S.
leaders believed they no longer needed strategic diplomacy. By the
1990s, after all, there were no more great powers with which to compete.
With the Soviet Union's collapse, the United States enjoyed a margin of
superiority that would have been unimaginable to earlier great powers.
Instead of trying to shape the behavior of rivals, Washington embraced
the much more expansive goal of transforming them into liberal
societies.

In this unusual setting, most American officials adopted one of two
attitudes toward diplomacy. The first camp believed the world was moving
toward a globalized utopia and saw diplomacy as a means of speeding that
process by building rules and institutions above the level of the state.
The second believed the United States could attain comprehensive
security through military-technological means and saw diplomacy as a
quixotic or pusillanimous enterprise that dishonored and weakened the
country.

Both these notions predate the end of the Cold War. For all his
legendary realism, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was an
idealist who believed that the job of American diplomats was to
eventually create a world federation. U.S. President Ronald Reagan,
hardly a merchant of peace at any price, found his photograph juxtaposed
next to that of Chamberlain in a full-page ad (paid for by Republican
hawks) in The Washington Times after he embarked on nuclear talks with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. After the Berlin Wall came down, both
notions flourished. Liberals saw the Soviet collapse as evidence that
paradise was nigh, and hard-liners saw it as evidence that diplomacy was
not needed. Diplomacy had been declared dead before, but never had the
rigor mortis been so advanced.

But rumors of history's demise were premature. Liberalism, it turns out,
did not expunge geopolitics from the human story. China, Iran, and
Russia did not transform into liberal societies. On the contrary, they
all became confident, civilizational states that remain determined to
dominate their regions. Today, great-power rivalry is back, and systemic
war is a very real possibility.

Neither liberals nor hawks have viable solutions to this problem. All
the international institutions in the world can't prevent a shooting war
between the United States and China or Russia or both. And as the last
two National Defense Strategies acknowledge, the U.S. military is not
postured or equipped to fight wars against two major rivals at the same
time. Washington can and should reinvest in its military. But thanks to
China's and Russia's advances and the enormous U.S. deficit, it would
require a generational effort to make the American military into one
capable of matching all its enemies simultaneously.

To compensate, Washington will have to return to strategic diplomacy. It
must, as Archidamus would say, remonstrate with its adversaries in "a
tone not too suggestive of war, nor again too suggestive of submission,"
and use the interval gained to get alliances and home resources into a
better state for war in the hope of avoiding it. Like past great powers,
Washington can start by reducing tensions with the weaker of its main
rivals in order to concentrate on the stronger. That is what Kissinger
and his boss, U.S. President Richard Nixon, did when they warmed ties
with Beijing so the United States could better focus on Moscow in the
early 1970s.

Today, the weaker rival is Russia. This has become all too obvious as
Ukraine has chewed through Moscow's military resources. The United
States should thus aim to use Russia's depleted state to its advantage,
seeking a détente with Moscow that disadvantages Beijing. The goal
should be not to remove the sources of conflict with Russia but to place
constraints on its ability to harm U.S. interests.

This process should begin by bringing the war in Ukraine to an end in a
way that is favorable to the United States. That means that when all is
said and done, Kyiv must be strong enough to impede Russia's westward
advances. To achieve this end, the American officials negotiating a
peace agreement should learn from the failure of the 2022 Istanbul talks
between Kyiv and Moscow, which treated a political settlement as the
goal and worked backward toward a cease-fire. Doing that enabled Russia
to make its political demands---neutering the Ukrainian state through
caps on the size of its army and changing its constitution---a
precondition to peace. A better model would be 1950s Korea: to
prioritize an armistice and push questions about a wider settlement into
a separate process that could take years to bear fruit, if it ever does.
Washington should still be willing to push the Ukrainians to cede
territory when doing so is necessary. But it should make Ukrainian
sovereignty a precondition for talks and use U.S. sanctions, military
assistance, and seized Russian assets to bring Moscow around.

The United States should pursue a defense relationship with Ukraine akin
to the one it maintains with Israel: not a formal alliance, but an
agreement to sell, lend, or give Kyiv what it needs to defend itself.
But it should not grant Ukraine NATO membership. Instead, the United
States should push European states to take responsibility for
Ukraine---and for the security of their continent more generally.

To nudge Europe along, American policymakers can again learn from the
Nixon administration, which developed a doctrine whereby the United
States agreed to provide nuclear protection for its treaty allies in the
secondary region (then Asia, now Europe) but expected local states to
provide their own conventional defense. As an economic corollary,
Nixon's treasury secretary, John Connally, pressured allies to lower
restrictions on U.S. goods and increase the value of their currencies to
boost American industry. Today, a Nixon-style arrangement might entail a
new transatlantic grand bargain in which the United States provides
extended deterrence and certain strategic systems to Europe but allies
provide the bulk of the frontline fighting capabilities. In the economic
domain, Washington might demand reciprocity in market access and
stipulate that allies can benefit from U.S. innovation only if they nix
regulatory standards that impede it. The goal should be to get allies to
accept American standards, not vice versa, and to collectively train the
West's sights on Beijing.

Suffice to say, [Trump]{.underline} and Putin are aware of the crucial
importance of making hay while the sun shines. They are [**moving with
incredible** speed to **build**]{.underline} a
**[partnership]{.underline}**. It is a **[breathtaking]{.underline}**
feat that the moribund **[diplomatic ties]{.underline}** are just about
reviving but the two presidents are simultaneously laying the bricks of
constructive engagement. They are already **[designing an architecture
of co-operation]{.underline}** despite the pervasive scepticism
domestically and among allies and onlookers such as Britain or India,
whose elites are visibly struggling to catch up with Trump's new
thinking. Many derisively dismiss him as a historical aberration. Time
will tell.

Trump and Putin are gingerly dancing around a 'chicken-and-egg'
situation in their sequencing where constructive engagement leading to
co-operation could help stabilise the foundations of US-Russia
relationship, while without functioning embassies, co-operation cannot
take off. The Ukraine war and the Iran nuclear issue are at the
epicentre of this paradigm. At the very first occasion Trump dialled
Putin on February 12, Trump brought up Ukraine and Iran (and Middle East
settlement) as issues of highest priority, hinting at a correlation
possible between the two in conflict resolution, and signalling his
desire to work together. Putin's intuitive cognition instinctively
seized upon it.

Trump's peacemaking efforts to end the Ukraine war are still a work in
progress. The glass is half full, half empty. He is taking timeout while
the military track creates new facts on the ground to give impetus to
diplomacy, as in all major wars. By winter, he will probably return to
pick up the threads. Meanwhile, the US has de facto pulled out of the
proxy war unnoticed.

[Trump]{.underline} is leaving it to the warmongers **[in
Europe]{.underline}** to continue to fight if they so wish. [The **ploy
is working**]{.underline}. The Europeans have abandoned their 'coalition
of the willing' as without US leadership, the proxy war against Russia
is doomed. NATO too has begun calibrating its compass. The upcoming
summit at the Hague will prioritise Europe's militarisation over the
fate of the proxy war. [It is a remarkable turnaround.]{.underline}

Equally, [Trump sees the **Iran nuclear** issue as a **low-hanging**
fruit]{.underline}. [Iran is keen on a fair deal and a productive
relationship with the US]{.underline} in sync with the emergent regional
consensus on reconciliation and development. [Trump senses it and hopes
that a deal can be **wrapped** up]{.underline} before the JCPOA's expiry
in October. During their earlier phone conversation on June 4, Trump
upfront [sought Putin's help to connect the dots in the
negotiations]{.underline}. Putin not only agreed but forthwith acted on
it by preparing to visit Tehran shortly.

Enter Israel. Any US-Iran normalisation will impact Israeli interests.
Israel has taken note that Trump has cleared the deck in the White House
national security team to launch a New West Asia with an economic
blueprint as the underpinning that his old billionaire friend Steve
Witkoff, special envoy to Russia and Iran, is assiduously working on.
The prospect of a US-Iran-Russia triangle is worrisome for Israel if it
is excluded from the great churning in West Asian alignments.

The emerging multipolarity in West Asia's regional politics poses
uncertainties too. Israel feels uneasy that a nuclear deal would result
in the lifting of US sanctions and might usher in a productive
relationship with Iran, which would radically change the regional
chessboard. Israel would have preferred to weaken Iran first and force
it to agree to a deal on terms acceptable to Israel. But [Trump opted
for the **ploughshare** with so many loose ends still lying around
affecting Israel's security.]{.underline}

[Trump, the **peacemaking president**, is **sailing** in many
boats]{.underline} --- he initially disfavoured Israel's war on Iran but
wouldn't oppose it, either, and lately began complimenting Israeli
operations and hinted at cashing in on the conflict situation; he gives
Israel whatever it wants to fight and even commends its performance in
the brewing war with Iran but he won't risk American lives; he pivots on
the Russia-Iran axis but also touches base with Netanyahu; he keeps an
eye on the powerful Israel lobby but would neither annoy nor openly
fraternise with it.

After the conversation with Putin on Saturday, Trump has kept voicing
optimism that peace between Israel and Iran, and a nuclear deal with
Iran are still possible. Indeed, [can he pull it off? If **anyone ever**
can, it can only be **Trump**]{.underline} who once went broke in the
mid-1990s with a \$900 million debt in personal liabilities --- his
hotels and casino businesses declared bankruptcy six times between 1991
and 2009 --- but only to bounce back spectacularly in 2016 as the
superpower's billionaire-president. Trump reminds us of a beautiful line
in the Scott Fitzgerald novel The Great Gatsby, 'Reserving judgments is
a matter of infinite hope.'

### 2NC---Link---Arctic Trade-Off

#### U.S. Arctic focus [expends political capital]{.underline} from the Middle East that's spread thin.

Science at Stanford University, recipient of a National Science

[Historically, US foreign policy in the High North has been
**unambitious** and **low-priority**]{.underline}; the **[little
diplomatic capital]{.underline}** which was **[expended]{.underline}**
focused on resource extraction. That changed with the publication of a
comprehensive Arctic strategy in 2009, but there is still no U.S.
ambassador to the Arctic; the United States is represented at the Arctic
Council by Senior Arctic Official Julia L. Gourley. In June, the United
States appointed its first Special Representative to the Arctic, Bob
Papp. But neither of these positions convey the legitimacy of an
ambassador, or even the authority of a Special Envoy.

Though diplomatic rank may not seem like the most pressing issue in the
Arctic, it conveys the little priority the United States seems to put on
the Arctic. However, there are three clear areas in which the United
States could use an Arctic ambassador to push its policy agenda.

Taking the Lead in Energy Governance

The energy resources that are being explored in the Arctic are immense:
the US Geological Survey reports 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,670
trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Though commentators have argued that
the global need to reduce carbon output makes tapping difficult,
particularly in the context of the recent deal between the United States
and China to reduce carbon emissions. However, for better or for worse,
hydrocarbons will remain in demand for the foreseeable future, and if
Arctic extraction is economically viable, it will be attempted.
Moreover, much of this extraction has taken place under the aegis of
Gazprom, the Russian state oil giant, which has signed a deal to export
400 billion dollars' worth of natural gas to China over the next thirty
years. So while many countries have made a commitment to decarbonize,
Arctic petroleum reserves will still be extracted.

A policy goal in the 2014 "Implementation Plan for the National Strategy
for the Arctic Region," a document which outlines the US plan of action
for its chairmanship of the 2015 session of the Arctic Council is to
"ensure the safe and responsible development of non-renewable energy
resources."

What's clear is that there is a lot more to be done. Managing responses
to oil spills, making sure there is a regulatory regime for drilling,
and coordinating policy are all policy areas where US leadership could
be beneficial. The travails of Shell Oil in the Beaufort and Chuckchi
Seas show that these issues are not just abstractions. Shell Oil had
problems certifying a response plan to a potential oil spill, and the
drilling season was plagued by mishaps, including having to move the
drill ship to dodge a massive ice floe. While these incidents happened
relatively close to US shores, difficulties are sure to increase as
drilling activities go further out to sea.

A recent report from Bookings notes that managing the responsible
extraction of resources from the Arctic should be a priority of every
Arctic littoral state. It also argues that to achieve this, the United
States needs to broaden its involvement in the Arctic---the authors go
so far as to suggest that the Department of State establish a Polar
Bureau, much like its Bureau of African Affairs. Certainly, a [**greater
focus** from the **Department of State**]{.underline} would go a long
way [towards]{.underline} **[enacting these policy goals]{.underline}**.

Promoting Arctic Infrastructure

A [greater **network** of **infrastructure** needs to be
established]{.underline} in order for the littoral states to take full
advantage of emerging opportunities in the Arctic. The Arctic Maritime
and Aviation Initiative, a project of the Arctic Council tasked with
inventorying infrastructure in the Arctic Circle, notes a paucity of
ports, airstrips, and other necessary infrastructure within the Arctic
Circle. A lack of such a support network negates the utility of shipping
routes, and makes resource extraction near impossible.

Necessary infrastructure goes beyond airports and ports: a [support
network]{.underline} needs to be in place. A prime example of this is
the need for search and rescue teams and [icebreakers]{.underline}.
Currently the United States operates a single operational icebreaker;
search and rescue resources are likewise scarce, although there is an
agreement between the Arctic littoral states which establishes the
specific obligations of every state.

This is another opportunity for the United States to take the lead.
Clearly, some leadership is needed to organize and strengthen the
infrastructure in the Arctic, including support networks. Considering
that the United States will take the chair of the Arctic Council in
2015, it is logical for the United States to take the initiative in such
projects. Such leadership is more easily achieved from a position of
real leadership---lead by an ambassador.

Strengthening the Arctic Council

The easiest and most direct ways of accomplishing the aforementioned
goal is by way of existing institutions. The Arctic Council is the most
established international institution in the Arctic, handling most
internationally coordinated projects. It is also more inclusive than
similar institutions, with six groups of indigenous peoples represented
as permanent participants. As such, it is the ideal vehicle for
advancing a policy agenda.

Strengthening the Arctic Council should be the primary responsibility
for any future Arctic Ambassador, and presents another strong argument
for the necessity of such a position. Having a higher ranked negotiating
presence at Arctic Council meetings would increase US bargaining power;
in addition, the greater independence of an ambassadorial appointment
delegates more agency to the Arctic Council.

Though there is little doubt that Bob Papp will be working closely with
Julia Gourley to make US presence known at the Arctic Council, a full
ambassadorial appointment would no doubt increase the visibility of US
engagement with the council. The more the United States is engaged, the
more it can show its support for strengthening the council---this is the
way forward for the United States to use existing institutions to
achieve policy objectives in the High North.

The High North is one of the most dynamic and emerging regions in
international politics, demanding space on the policy agendas of all
Arctic littoral states. Eleven countries have posted Arctic ambassadors
in the past seven years. In order to guarantee a leadership position
consistent with US policy goals, it simply must shed its culture of
disengagement in the Arctic Circle. Though at the present [**US
diplomatic capital is spread** thin, with high-**priority initiatives**
in]{.underline} both East Asia and **[the Middle East]{.underline}**,
there remains sufficient resources for the State Department to appoint a
full ambassador to the Arctic. From energy governance to Arctic
infrastructure to strengthening the Arctic Council, the United States
needs to appoint an ambassador to the Arctic to advance these essential
policies.

[There is]{.underline} [no]{.underline} public [Air Force **Middle East
strategy**]{.underline}, no high-profile Latin America strategy from the
Army, no Navy Africa strategy. [So why are the services now **competing
to release Arctic ones**]{.underline}? As the Biden administration fills
out its national security team, new and returning arrivals will face a
curious development in Arctic defense policy: the [**proliferation of
Arctic strategies** from the service branches]{.underline}. The Navy and
Marine Corps released a new strategy in January 2021, only the latest in
a series of forthcoming and updated content from the Army, the
Department of the Air Force, the Navy (again, in 2019), and (in the
Department of Homeland Security) the Coast Guard. Is this plethora of
strategies constructive in advancing U.S. Arctic policy? What is driving
this unusual phenomenon?

The answer is complex. Service branches are typically responsible for
implementing strategy, not serving as the initial source identifying and
setting Arctic strategy. That role lies with civilian policymakers and
operational commanders. But the service branches shouldn't be criticized
for publishing strategy. They are often filling a gap left by others,
and they bring a needed perspective on high-latitude training and
acquisition --- as long as they are sufficiently coordinated with the
primary institutions responsible for producing Arctic strategy. The
answer to this mixed blessing of multiple service Arctic documents is
for the incoming Biden administration to **[reenergize]{.underline}**
White House and **[diplomatic strategies for the region]{.underline}**,
impose more coordination in the Defense Department above the service
branches and across geographic commands, and refocus the Arctic defense
conversation on critical near-term investment needs.

Arctic as the Final Frontier

To understand why the service branches would produce these documents at
all, it is first necessary to explore why the Arctic is unique relative
to other theaters and who is interested in its development as a growing
frontier for the military.

The harsh and forbidding physical terrain of the region demands a
specific approach. Arctic operations benefit from specialized training
and materiel not immediately applicable in other theaters. A force that
is more active in the Arctic needs distinct acquisitions, from
icebreakers to high-latitude communications capabilities. A force that
is more active in the Arctic also needs specialized training, including
in maintaining and operating equipment in extreme cold. And because some
acquisitions or trainings are uniquely suited for the Arctic, they
impose opportunity costs on alternative platforms and skills with more
universal applications. So service spending on the Arctic comes with a
need to put the region in a much broader context than might be the case
for something like a destroyer, which can operate just as effectively in
the conditions of the Mediterranean as it can in the Pacific or south
Atlantic.

Another clear driver in the development of Arctic strategies is that
they are often a function of congressional interest. This is most
obviously the case with the Pentagon's 2019 Arctic strategy, which says
as much right in the name, "Report to Congress: Department of Defense
Arctic Strategy," but may also be evinced by the rise of Arctic
strategies as far afield as that of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration or the brand-new DHS strategy. Congressional focus on the
Arctic produces churn in the services and across the government ---
sometimes for the better. And while much of this is driven by the Alaska
delegation, Arctic interests are increasingly a bipartisan passion on
the Hill. It is this demand signal that has helped force the Arctic onto
the map for the Pentagon, and the service strategies are a product of
this push.

There are plenty of reasons why the Arctic may be an increasingly
important space for policymaking, as is intimated by the large
deployment of F-35 aircraft to Alaska or the rise in Navy deployments to
the Barents Sea. The region, once a final frontier of scientific
exploration, may now be the first frontier in a shifting global order
stressed by climate change, human migration, and resource competition.
Already, Russian activity in the north Pacific Arctic has accelerated,
as have Russian submarine deployments (which are historically centered
around the Arctic). U.S. Arctic infrastructure, which helps detect
inbound aerospace threats from missiles to aircraft, is both aged and
falling prey to permafrost thaw.

So, although the Arctic is both operationally distinct and increasingly
of interest to policymakers, this understanding alone does not explain
how the service branches became so prominent in drafting Arctic policy.

Service Branches Should Come Second

[**Service branch strategies** are **not** the **usual starting point**
for building Arctic defense policy because the services are not the
central actors for setting or implementing that policy]{.underline}.
Ideally, they should speak to the how --- organize, train, equip --- but
not the why, as the latter is the purview of those civilians who set
national and defense priorities. Civilians may publish these strategies
-- the service secretaries signed the strategies of both the Department
of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force -- and thus lend the
appearance of civilian oversight. But the services are not the nodal
point for setting foreign or defense policy, which is a larger issue of
the civil-military divide. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has
partially answered the mail on civilian oversight with the 2019 report
required by Congress, but with remaining gaps in direction from the
White House and State Department.

One reason why we see service branches taking on leading roles in Arctic
policy development may stem from the fact that [U.S. national Arctic
strategy is **fragmented** among civilian agencies]{.underline}. Extant
guidance spans at least three presidents, stretching back to National
Security Presidential Directive 66 in the final days of the Bush
administration and on into the Obama era's 2013 national strategy (which
has yet to be replaced). There is, moreover, an **[unusually large
interagency footprint for the Arctic]{.underline}** as compared to some
other regions. When looking at the various institutional executors for
the tasks set out in the 2016 implementation framework for the 2013
strategy, it is evident that the Defense Department (let alone the
services) is not the only major player. The Coast Guard, the State
Department, NOAA, the Department of the Interior, and the Environmental
Protection Agency dominated the taskings. The Department of Defense
arises sparingly. Service strategies fit into a much more robust
national civilian architecture of Arctic equities that are difficult for
the services to navigate without more help at higher levels in the
Pentagon.

Further, that the various service branches release separate strategies
may partially be a function of the military's own fractured command and
control of the Arctic. At the joint level, Northern Command and European
Command divide responsibility for the Arctic (with the former the
official resource advocate). At the service level, it can be even more
fractured, as with the Navy's split of Arctic responsibilities across
elements of the Second, Third, and Sixth fleets. Without a clear leader
among the service branches, much less atop them at the civilian policy
level, each service branch is adopting aspects of Arctic policymaking
under its own aegis, further splintering the region's responsibilities.

The result of service strategies proliferating in this context is a lot
of energy being spent on thinking about what services need for
competition in the Arctic (again, an important debate) but a much less
robust institutional U.S. government view on what the purpose and nature
of that competition should be. [The more services rush to answer the
how]{.underline}, without better guidance on the why, [the harder it
becomes to make **informed decisions** about **prioritizing limited
resources**]{.underline}**.** And while the [Arctic]{.underline} may be
rising in prominence, so long as it **[remains secondary]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} the Defense Department to Europe and the Indo-Pacific
(and even the Persian Gulf, in practice), it will remain [critical to
**assign resources** based on a comprehensive sense of strategic
guidance and operational requirements]{.underline}. [The
**Arctic**]{.underline} thereby [risks being a region where strategies
can score **rhetorical points** while **deferring costs to other
actors**]{.underline}**,** in contrast to areas where geography and
commander are more clearly aligned. In such an environment, threats and
challenges in the Arctic risk being framed as existing mostly in the not
too distant future, which is another way of saying not right now.

[Faced with **Limited Resources** and **Changing Priorities**,
**Deciding When**, If, and How to Intervene Is **More Important than
Ever**]{.underline}

[**U.S. engagement** can take on many forms]{.underline}**,** ranging
from humanitarian assistance to [diplomacy to military
action]{.underline}. [Given **finite resources and** capacities, the
**United States** must often **make hard choices** on **how much
diplomatic capital to invest** in crisis or conflict
situations]{.underline}. [It **cannot invest equally** in every crisis
or **potential crisis**]{.underline}. In intervening in these
situations, [**decisionmakers** must be **careful** and **sensitive** in
setting ground rules for engagement since intervention is never
impartial]{.underline}---it can decide, for better or worse, who
governs, who eats, and who survives. At the same time, setting rules for
where, when, and how to intervene has become more difficult as U.S.
interests in Africa have become harder to define following the end of
the Cold War.

The reality is that [decisions are made on **a case-by-case
basis**]{.underline} or in response to events. A
**[triage]{.underline}** process **[is inevitable,]{.underline}**
whereby possible types and places of intervention are ordered in terms
of priority and their likelihood of success, **[based on the
availability of resources]{.underline}**. For this reason, [**U.S.
diplomatic** activity has **focused**]{.underline} on the Horn of Africa
and Sudan in particular, [to the **detriment of other
crises**]{.underline} such as those in the Great Lakes region or Niger
Delta. [Decisionmakers must **make hard-nosed decisions** in setting
criteria for intervention]{.underline}. Among the criteria that
policymakers need to consider, said Crocker, are cases where U.S.
security interests are at stake; where a crisis risks having broad,
regional consequences; where the United States is expected to take the
lead; where the United States can usefully follow the lead of others
such as the United Nations; and where grave humanitarian values are at
stake and where domestic public opinion demands that the United States
provide policy leadership. The United States must also take into account
the willingness of African governments and regional bodies to accept
such leadership.

#### Diplomatic is a [scarce resource]{.underline}---shifting focus [diverts it]{.underline}.

mgm\]

For some time after the end of the Cold War in 1989, it was common to
think that the world had entered a new era in which great power
competition would be a thing of the past. But instead, the world has
entered a [new]{.underline} era of [geopolitical
competition]{.underline} between states---an era where competitors like
the U.S. and China each attempt to win vital allies to their side
[through **battles of strategic diplomacy**]{.underline}, and one where
the U.S. is regrettably falling behind.

As the Biden administration's latest national security strategy makes
clear, the coming years will be critical for deciding which nation will
lead the international order. Of all the countries in the world, the
only one that can effectively challenge the United States for global
leadership is the People's Republic of China. To protect America's
national interests, policymakers in Washington must be aware of the
nature and scope of the challenges from Beijing.

It has become unambiguous that China is the most capable adversary the
United States is currently facing. It is under the absolute control of
the Chinese Communist Party, which is devious, cruel, and predatory. Its
military and economic capacity and calculated willingness to challenge
America and its allies around the world on almost all strategic fronts
constitute a threat of unprecedented proportions.

In particular, as Politico explained in a recent special report,
currently, regrettably, [the United States no longer claims an advantage
in diplomatic terms]{.underline} compared to China, and it is more
pronounced when it comes to developing countries.

As the report explains, the disadvantage is somewhat the [result
of]{.underline} U.S. disengagement in some regions, a deemphasis on the
trade and investment element of diplomacy, a dearth in the confirmation
of ambassadors, and a [**failure to focus strategic**
**assistance**]{.underline} on areas that the developing world
prioritizes.

Regarding that last element, American support focuses on "providing
technical assistance to governments on everything from education to
fighting corruption," according to the report. That support is
beneficial, but infrastructure projects, which China prioritizes, are
more valued.

As is well documented, China, for its part, doesn't care about human
rights and how a regime it works with comes to power. China merely
claims to want to do business and presents its economic development
model for lifting people out of poverty without free market democracy as
more effective and beneficial than the U.S. model.

China has been expanding its diplomatic staff and presence around the
world. In addition, China focuses on helping these developing countries
with projects such as its Belt and Road Initiative, which is China's
ambitious geoeconomic connectivity initiative. This massive
infrastructure project would stretch from East Asia to Europe.

This economic largesse has boosted China's diplomatic advantages
compared to the United States. However, Belt and Road have yet to be an
absolute success. China has had to rein in the program as countries have
grown increasingly wary of participating in it.

The overall challenges from China on various policy fronts are still
unnerving for the U.S. Yet the United States can and must win the
geopolitical, diplomatic competition. As Heritage Foundation's Vice
President for Foreign Policy James Carafano succinctly underscored in
"In a New Kind of War, the Old Wars of Ideas Are Back," which highlights
the importance of winning the critical battle of ideas, "We can't win
without being proactive."

To that end, there needs to be a greater emphasis on improving our
foreign service. For instance, there should be a drive to recruit more
experts and diplomatic staff that understand Latin America and Africa,
so they can effectively represent American interests in those regions.

From a broader perspective, a [key]{.underline} element of [soft yet
effective diplomatic power is pragmatic]{.underline} economic
[engagements]{.underline}. America will help itself and the world more
if it moves from handing out aid to creating real partnerships. To that
end, for instance, the International Development Finance Corporation
needs to be more strategic. This development agency helps finance
overseas infrastructure and other projects so that America can compete
with infrastructure development, but **[it needs to be better
focused.]{.underline}**

Last but not least, [the United States **needs to reassess its
priorities**]{.underline}. Instead of propagating far-left goals in its
foreign policy, such as promoting abortion, the U.S. must focus on its
national interests and develop a plan to achieve its goals. These sorts
of **[policies]{.underline}**, while pleasing to the left side of the
political spectrum, [**divert scarce diplomatic capital** from advancing
core U.S. interests and undermine diplomatic relations]{.underline} with
more conservative nations.

#### Diplomatic capital is a [currency]{.underline} expended through negotiations.

War" Members*, edited by Robert Czulda and Marek Madej. NATO
International Relations Research Institute; mgm\]

While the former question will be examined further as this chapter
progresses, the latter question first requires a brief explanation of
the term "**[diplomatic capital]{.underline}**". In this context,
Rebecca Adler-Nissen explains capital [as a form of
"**currency**]{.underline}" [which can be **traded in diplomatic
negotiations**]{.underline}**,** gathered through the portrayal of
positive "social competences, reputation and personal authority".13
Linking the idea of diplomatic capital to Allied behaviour during the
ISAF years, Nik Hynek and Péter Marton identify four main roles taken up
by contributing Allies:

•the "[owner" of the mission]{.underline}, [the United
States]{.underline}, as [securing]{.underline} Afghanistan was
[a]{.underline} direct [**objective** **within its
security**]{.underline} **[policy]{.underline};**

•the "strivers", those reliant on NATO's security provision, which as a
consequence motivated them to make contributions of more arduously
generated goods judged as at a premium by the mission's "owner" and
NATO's prime hegemonic ally, the United States;

•the "servants", those contributing goods deemed of lower demand by the
"owner", but wishing to retain NATO for a miscellany of reasons short of
alliance dependence; and, finally,

•the "onlookers", those with weak motivation who contributed
superficially.14

Thus, in the context of Baltic hopes and fears, the optimum opportunity
presented by ISAF was a chance to enhance diplomatic capital through
"striving". The ultimate benefit of which being increased access to
hegemonic allies and, in turn, a greater platform to influence NATO
policy in the Baltic Sea region. On the other hand, as the goods seen as
at a premium by ISAF's leadership required strenuous efforts to produce,
the risks of ISAF for the Baltic states consisted in a [worry over
domestic political, **resource** or **expertise** **constraints**
preventing them from generating contributions of premium demand. This in
turn could lead to **negative diplomatic capital**, with]{.underline}
fledgling [**reputations** **damaged**]{.underline} and the label of
"onlooker" designated within the Alliance.

## Internal Link: Israel-Iran

### 2NC---I/L---US Diplomacy Key

#### U.S. diplomacy is uniquely key---it's only state that can lead negotiations; requires [coordinated]{.underline} diplomatic effort.

**Kurtzer & Simon '6/18** \[Daniel C Kurtzer, Professor of diplomacy and
conflict resolution at Princeton University's School of Public and

Iran---Not Join It." Foreign Affairs.

mgm\]

[Trump's best option]{.underline}, therefore, is [to]{.underline} try to
[help bring the Israel-Iran war to an **end**]{.underline} in a way that
preserves what Israel has accomplished militarily but also [allows Iran
to save enough face to return to negotiations.]{.underline} To do this,
he will need to mobilize a multilateral effort to keep nuclear-related
material out of Iran's hands, [**develop** a **negotiating** strategy
that takes advantage of the **weakness** that **Iran has
shown**]{.underline} in the recent fighting, and [conclude a credible
agreement]{.underline} that effectively [ends Iran's quest for a nuclear
weapons capability.]{.underline}

All this will be far easier to propose than to achieve. If Trump puts
outright pressure on Israel to stop its aerial strikes, Israel's
supporters in both U.S. political parties will rise in protest,
imperiling the rest of his political agenda. But if Trump attempts to
simply sit the war out, it will grind on with unpredictable
consequences. Iran may descend into civil war or societal collapse,
creating a terrible humanitarian crisis; at the other end of the
spectrum, an extended war of attrition would expose the combatants to
costs that will be difficult to recover in the foreseeable future---and
prolong Israel's efforts to draw the United States into the conflict.

Until now, Trump has combined tough rhetoric and threats with the demand
that Iran return to the negotiating table and accept a deal that
excludes any uranium enrichment on Iranian soil. This bob-and-weave
approach will not be enough. Much more [**precise U.S. diplomatic
intervention** is **required** even as the Israeli aerial campaign
maintains pressure on Iran in the background. Only a **determined
American president** can pull off this **complex, coercive diplomatic
effort.**]{.underline}

First, the president's senior military and intelligence advisers need to
engage with Israel and seek agreement on a battle damage assessment that
would judge whether enough damage has been done to Iran's nuclear
program to justify stopping Israel's attacks. This assessment would
factor in the Israeli assassinations of key Iranian military leaders,
nuclear scientists, engineers, and administrators, as well as the damage
inflicted on infrastructure. The fact that even future Israeli strikes
are likely to leave Fordow's centrifuge halls and Iran's uranium
hexafluoride storage site more or less intact will make this a difficult
conversation. But the Trump administration must persuade Israel that
Iran's capabilities can be adequately hobbled without destroying Fordow
or continuing its attacks indefinitely.

Second, Trump must work with Netanyahu to define an end goal for the war
that can be achieved quickly: a significant and specific measure of
destruction of Iran's existing nuclear facilities and stockpile.
Netanyahu's goals, thus far, appear much broader---the total destruction
of Iran's nuclear program and, increasingly, regime change. Netanyahu
must be advised that he cannot expect U.S. support for a policy aimed at
regime change.

Third, with the help of U.S. allies in the Gulf, Iran's rulers will have
to be convinced that accepting the bitter chalice of greatly diminished
access to enrichment is better than economic strangulation, continued
pounding from the air, and the possible loss of control over their
country. [**Trump needs** to **enlist like-minded states** such as
France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to commit to a **sustained
multilateral effort to**]{.underline} deny Iran the new nuclear-related
equipment it would need to reconstitute its program and sprint for a
bomb. An all-out effort along the lines of Operation Staunch---an
embargo launched in the 1980s that weakened Iran's hand in its war with
Iraq---would probably be required.

If progress can be made on these elements of the strategy, [the **United
States**]{.underline} should [then **draft a UN Security Council
resolution proposing** a **cease-fire plan**]{.underline}. The plan must
include verifiable conditions related to Iran's nuclear program, such as
the immediate return of nuclear inspectors, removing all barriers to
those inspectors' access to the facilities they seek to examine, an
embargo on the importation of components needed to reconstitute the
program, the immediate export of any enriched uranium remaining in Iran,
and a call to renew negotiations toward a nuclear deal.

If negotiations toward a deal do resume, Trump needs to take a realistic
approach, accepting that his deal may end up looking more like a
strengthened version of the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement than something
brand new. Insisting that Iran forgo enriching any uranium at all on its
soil---a stance Trump's negotiators had taken after much back and
forth---makes sense at the outset of resumed talks. But it will be very
difficult for Trump to sustain that position given Iran's entrenched
stance on enrichment. It will also be enormously difficult for
Netanyahu---who has exposed Israel to punishing Iranian missile barrages
with the aim of destroying Iran's program altogether---to concede both
the survival of the Islamic Republic and any prospect of enrichment in
Iran.

One way to deal with this concern---a proposal that is already on the
table---would be for [the **United States** to **lead** the **setup** of
a regional **consortium** for enrichment]{.underline} under strict
supervision by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Such a solution
could offer Iran a face-saving way of obtaining low-enriched uranium for
medical and other benign purposes. And the presence of other parties,
presumably some Arab states, and the location of this consortium outside
Iran would go far in assuaging some of Israel's concerns.

HOBSON\'S CHOICE

This [**diplomatic effort** by **Trump** carries political
risks]{.underline}. A major multilateral push to contain Iran's nuclear
ambitions will divert intelligence resources important to other targets,
especially China and Russia, and probably necessitate a reversal of
planned cuts to the U.S. intelligence apparatus. And any nuclear deal
with Iran that allows the country to participate in uranium enrichment
even outside its own territory will require Trump to spend political
capital with his base. But these [risks are worth it to **avoid renewed
war**]{.underline}.

Israel's attack has already created a strategic shift in the Middle
East. The country has again proved that its intelligence prowess and
military dominance can redefine the region's politics. Once this war is
over, [**Trump** can turn **his** **attention** to a goal he has already
articulated: translating that strategic transformation into the
**normalization** of **relations** between Israel and Arab states. This
is a task the **United States is best positioned to carry
out.**]{.underline}

**[But if Trump dithers]{.underline}**---or, worse, fully joins Israel's
war---[he will **destroy his ability to broker a more peaceful Middle
East**]{.underline}, an aim he has repeatedly stressed is precious to
him. He must act, and in the right way, before Israel's appetite for
regime change leads to another "forever war"---and [**before** the
**logic of escalation** leads Iran to shift from launching missiles to
**launching terror attacks**, including **against
Americans**.]{.underline}

The EU and [Europe]{.underline}'s leaders called for restraint and
diplomacy following [Israel's attack on Iran]{.underline} on Friday and
the ensuing retaliation from Iran, but they appear to have been
[**caught off guard** by the action and are **unlikely** to be in a
position to **leverage much diplomatic clout**.]{.underline}

European leaders voiced alarm over the military attacks and called for a
diplomatic solution to avoid an all-out war that could spiral across the
Middle East and beyond, but security expert Claude Moniquet told
Euronews that [Europe has been left "**sitting on the
sidelines".**]{.underline}

This was already true of negotiations taking place between the Americans
and the Iranians. US President Donald Trump\'s attempt to reach an
agreement with Iran to halt uranium enrichment was scheduled to run to a
sixth round of talks in Oman on Sunday.

Those talks may now be in doubt, but "the Europeans were excluded" from
them anyway, Moniquet pointed out.

"[Europeans have been pretty much **excluded from all major diplomatic
manoeuvres**]{.underline} around the war in Gaza or the war in Lebanon,"
the former French intelligence officer and author said.

[Europe\'s leaders **tout diplomacy** but **lack means to deliver
it**]{.underline}

"Diplomatic efforts are crucial to preventing further escalation,"
European Commission President posted on X late on Friday after speaking
to Israel's President Isaac Herzog concerning the escalating situation.

Moniquet said that the [European Union has **lost influence in the**
**region** and has **no say in diplomacy** over the future of the Middle
East,]{.underline} however.

Europe's ambivalent support for Israel's attacks likely meant its

As Iran and Israel trade strikes and the US weighs joining in, wealthy
[Gulf states]{.underline} on the conflict\'s doorstep are [engaged in
**frantic diplomacy**]{.underline} to halt the war -- [but **solutions
remain elusive**]{.underline}**.**

A spillover of the conflict or the Iranian government\'s collapse are
both worrying outcomes for the energy-rich region, which hosts several
major US military bases.

Peace and stability have been central to the rise of Gulf powers
including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who are
pivoting their economies towards business and tourism.

Hoping to avert the crisis, Saudi Arabia, the world\'s biggest oil
exporter, has been talking to Iran and the United States since \"day
one\", Ali Shihabi, an analyst close to the royal court, told AFP.

\"But [it **does not look promising** that something will happen very
soon]{.underline},\" he added.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto Saudi ruler, and the
UAE\'s President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, have both spoken to
Iran\'s President Masoud Pezeshkian in recent days.

The Emirati president also held a phone call on Wednesday with Russia\'s
President Vladimir Putin, an ally of Iran, who offered to mediate in the
conflict.

Israel\'s launching of the war scuppered Oman-brokered talks between
Tehran and Washington that were supported by Gulf nations, who have been
pursuing a détente with their giant neighbour after years of strained
ties.

\'Reckless and miscalculated\'

On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump demanded Iran\'s \"unconditional
surrender\" and warned it could easily assassinate its supreme leader,
fuelling fears of American intervention.

Hours later, the UAE\'s Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al
Nahyan said the Gulf country\'s president had \"conducted intensive
diplomatic calls \... to de-escalate tensions and prevent the conflict
from spreading\".

Sheikh Abdullah warned against \"reckless and miscalculated actions that
could extend beyond the borders of the two countries\", in a strongly
worded statement published by the official WAM news agency.

Trump had initially urged Iran to come to the negotiating table, but an
official briefed on talks said Tehran told Qatar and Oman that it \"will
not negotiate while under attack\".

Oman, Iran\'s traditional intermediary, said it was engaged in
diplomatic efforts as the daily strikes continue.

Meanwhile Qatar, a key mediator in the Israel-Hamas war and a negotiator
with Iran in the past, has also been \"engaging daily\" with the US, its
foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.

Former Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani warned on X that
\"it is not in the interest of the Gulf states to see Iran \...
collapse\", adding that they would be \"the first to be harmed\" by the
war\'s repercussions.

**[\'Almost no influence\']{.underline}**

An Arab diplomat told AFP: \"Everyone in the Gulf is going to say we are
better off making sure we have a deal with Iran, a diplomatic solution
with Iran.\"

Shihabi, the Saudi analyst, echoed the sentiment, saying the [**best
outcome** was \"obviously an agreement between Iran **and (the)
US**]{.underline}\".

Diplomatic intervention by Saudi Arabia, once a fierce critic of Iran,
comes two years after they restored ties. The UAE, which recognised
Israel in 2020, has also patched up relations with Tehran since 2022.

\"Whereas the Saudis may have once called for \'cutting off the head of
the snake\', their approach toward Iran has shifted dramatically,\" said
Hasan Alhasan, a senior fellow for Middle East policy at the
International Institute for Strategic Studies.

However, \"[the Arab Gulf states have almost **no ability to shape
Israel\'s or Iran\'s behavio**ur or **influence the outcome of this**
**war**]{.underline}\", he told AFP.

But [despite its deepening economic ties]{.underline} with Tehran and
the broader [Middle East]{.underline}, observers say [**China's limited
influence** over the key players, particularly Israel, makes
**meaningful intervention** an **uphill task.**]{.underline}

They add that even as Beijing publicly backs Tehran, [it is **unlikely**
to risk wading into the conflict to tilt the balance in Iran's
fav]{.underline}our. Doing so would [risk escalating tensions with the
United States]{.underline} and undermining China\'s carefully calibrated
position as a neutral actor in the region.

"[**China would be drawn into a regional conflict** with **global
repercussions**]{.underline}, which is surely [something Beijing has no
appetite for]{.underline}," said Andrea Ghiselli, a lecturer in
international politics at the University of Exeter.

["This is a **very difficult** position **for Chinese
diplomacy**."]{.underline}

Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, a non-partisan US think tank focused on foreign policy and
national security issues, said it reveals a larger problem for Beijing.

"Today\'s crisis and [China\'s]{.underline} seeming [**inability** to
have **any influence** on its **outcome** spotlights the gap between
Beijing\'s great power rhetoric and its **limited reach** in the
**Middle East."**]{.underline}

PLAYING PEACEMAKER - OR NOT?

The conflict erupted on Friday (Jun 13) when Israel launched surprise
attacks on targets across Iran. Described by Israel as necessary
"preemptive" strikes to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons,
the salvo sparked swift retaliation from Tehran, which has consistently
denied seeking nuclear arms.

Attacks have continued back and forth since then. More than 200 people
have been killed, most of them civilians.

China has joined a growing chorus of international calls for restraint
as fears grow that the region could be on the cusp of a broader
conflagration.

Foreign Minister Wang Yi held phone calls with his Israeli and Iranian
counterparts on Jun 14. He told both men that China was willing to play
\"a constructive role\" in de-escalating the conflict, reported China's
foreign ministry.

Chinese President Xi Jinping repeated the refrain in comments reported
by state news agency Xinhua on Tuesday, calling for urgent
de-escalation.

He added that China "stands ready to work with all parties to play a
constructive role in restoring peace and stability in the Middle East".

Some reports have focused on the possibility of China playing mediator.
The country has in recent years actively positioned itself as a global
peacemaker, distinct from US influence.

"China is a neutral party, and can play a very important mediating
role," Wang Huiyao, founder and president of the Chinese think tank
Center for China and Globalization (CCG), told CNA, highlighting China's
"good" track record in the Middle East and lack of "historical baggage".

Beijing brokered a Palestinian unity deal in war-torn Gaza in July 2024.
The year before, it brokered a historic reconciliation between Saudi
Arabia and Iran, mediating the rapprochement alongside Iraq and Oman
without direct involvement from the US or Europe.

The latest outreach follows a familiar pattern in Chinese diplomacy,
where Beijing seeks to project calm and offer mediation without
committing to direct intervention. In past conflicts, including in Syria
and Yemen, China issued similar calls but played only a limited
follow-up role.

But most of the other analysts CNA spoke to believe [China doesn't
**have sufficient leverage to meaningfully** mediate the Israel-Iran
conflict]{.underline}.

In particular, [it wields "**practically no influence**" with
Israel]{.underline}, said Jonathan Fulton, a non-resident senior fellow
at the Atlantic Council's Middle East Programs.

He told CNA that [China\'s stance on the Israel-Palestinian]{.underline}
[conflict]{.underline} since Oct 7, 2023 - when Palestinian militant
group Hamas attacked Israel - has **[significantly]{.underline}**

[leaving Beijing with "**very little leverage**" in Israeli
eyes.]{.underline}

"China\'s always been very clear that it supports the Palestinians, and
in this case, it was very overt. I think the Israelis have come to
realise that China doesn\'t offer any kind of support for them in this
situation."

Ghiselli from the University of Exeter described the Israel-Iran
conflict as a war they have "prepared for decades".

"True or not, they think they are fighting for their survival. Nothing
else matters. Moreover, neither of them is dependent on China in a way
that would allow Beijing to force them to stop," said Ghiselli, who is
also head of research for the China-Mediterranean project at the
University of Turin.

"China is not like the US, which could just stop the Israeli war machine
by withdrawing its support."

Sun Degang, professor of political science at Fudan University and
director of its Center for Middle Eastern Studies, similarly noted that
Beijing's mediation efforts hinge on political will from both sides to
engage - something that seems to be lacking.

["I **don't think Israel** is **ready to accept** China's
mediation]{.underline}," he told CNA. "It wants to destroy Iranian
nuclear facilities and implement regime change in Iran."

FDD's Singleton said [China **lacks** the trust, intelligence channels,
and "coercive sticks" to influence Israeli or Iranian war
planning]{.underline}.

"At best, it can pass messages; [it]{.underline} almost [**certainly
cannot broker terms** or **enforce compliance**,]{.underline}" he said,
adding that ceasefire mediation only works when both parties want it.

## Impact: Israel-Iran

### 2NC---!---Israel-Iran War

#### U.S., Noko, Pakistan, Russia, and China get drawn in. Miscalc makes [global nuclear war]{.underline} "realistic" and "probable"

**Beres '24** \[Louis René; August 10, 2024. Professor Emeritus of
International Law at Purdue University, PhD. "'Absurd Connections' ---
Israel, North Korea, and Nuclear War." JURIST.
https://www.jurist.org/commentary/2024/08/absurd-connections-israel-north-korea-and-nuclear-war;
mgm\]

For conspicuous reasons, the [**likelihood** of [**direct** **war**
between]{.mark} [**Israel** and **Iran**]{.mark} is **increasingly**
"**high**]{.underline}."\[1\] What remains inconspicuous is that such a
war could [quickly]{.underline} or incrementally [[involve **North
Korean**]{.mark} **military [assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even if
Israel were able to keep Iran pre-nuclear, an already nuclear North
Korea could still multiply and magnify Iranian aggressions. In this
scenario, [North Korea would function as a witting **surrogate** of
Iran.]{.underline}

What logic-based arguments could support such a portentous conclusion?
In a worst case narrative, [[Israel]{.mark} would find itself
[facing]{.mark} **direct military [conflict]{.mark}** [with]{.mark}
Iran's state ally in [Pyongyang]{.mark}]{.underline}, one in which
Israel could lose its presumptive upper hand during **[[competitive
risk-taking]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Any such loss would be the result of
[**[Israel no longer]{.mark}** being the **[sole nuclear power]{.mark}**
during crisis escalations]{.underline}. In strategic parlance, this
signifies possible [[Israeli loss of]{.underline} "**[escalation
dominance]{.underline}**]{.mark}."\[2\]

Inevitably, such calculations would be perplexing and not for the
intellectually faint-at-heart.\[3\] At the same time, going forward,
purposeful Israeli solutions could be discoverable only by gifted
strategic thinkers,\[4\] not by politicians, pundits or actionable
marionettes of artificial intelligence. Regarding the incentives for
North Korea to undertake potentially grave risks on behalf of Iran, the
most recognizable encouragements would coalesce around Iranian oil.

If Hezbollah, Hamas and Houthi terror attacks on Israel should lead to
direct and protracted warfare between Israel and Iran, North Korean
involvement could more immediately immobilize Israel. In nuclear terms,
Israel would likely be in an unfavorable position to engage Iran's PRK
proxy because Israel is a "50 target state." Even in its still
pre-nuclear iteration and without tangible North Korean backing, Iran
would be a "1000+ target state" with long-range strike capabilities.

In Jerusalem, these would already be concerning asymmetries.
Nonetheless, [[Israel]{.mark} could soon have to [face]{.mark} a
[**newly**-**nuclear** **Iran** and]{.mark} an already-[nuclear
North]{.mark} [Korea]{.mark} [simultaneously]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[5\]
And this is to say nothing about variously [possible
**[Russian]{.mark}** and/or **[Chinese]{.mark}**
**[interventions]{.mark}** undertaken for Iran, or about **plausible**
**[Indian]{.mark}** and/or [**Pakistani**
**involvements**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, a nuclear Sunni Islamic state, is
[improving its [ties to]{.mark} Shiite [Iran]{.mark}]{.underline} while
remaining supportive of Sunni Saudi Arabia. [[Nuclear
India]{.underline}]{.mark}, the long-time foe of Pakistan, is also
[strengthening its ties to Iran]{.underline} by way of Chabahar
port.\[6\] [[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} [has openly [embraced]{.mark}
a "**counterforce**]{.underline}" or warfighting strategy [of **nuclear
[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one that could [[**confront**
**Israeli** **decision**-**makers** with]{.mark} altogether
**unprecedented [existential hazards]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In the final analysis, it could be left [up to the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates to support [Israel]{.mark}'s survival [against
**Iran**]{.mark}**ian**, [No]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}rean
and**]{.underline} potentially [**[Pakistan]{.mark}i**
aggressions]{.underline}. This conclusion would identify scenarios in
which Iran-backed jihadist terror attacks\[7\] on Israel wind up
retrospectively as the original precipitants of a regional or **[[global
nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Presently, Iranian surrogate forces
are visibly operational in all Palestinian territories (especially
Gaza), Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Mali and Somalia.

Looking forward from Jerusalem, multiple subsidiary and intersecting
questions will need to be answered. A key question dawns: If Iranian
decision-makers are confident in their timetable to become nuclear, why
should they ever need to solidify or enlarge alliance ties with North
Korea? Exactly "how close" are Tehran and Pyongyang as military allies?
Would it be prudent or cost-effective for Iran to strengthen its ties to
North Korea when the Islamic Republic might still have to face Israeli
preemptive strikes or other barriers to independent nuclear status?\[8\]
Are presumptive Iranian interests in a North Korean nuclear surrogacy
sensible, rational and cost-effective? Or are they "absurd?"

There will be more questions. What are the relevant and particular
scenarios? How should these time-urgent narratives be ascertained and
delineated? Though Israel has no currently direct adversarial
connections to North Korea (it did have limited actual warfighting in
1973), Pyongyang does have binding ties to Syria and remains a close
ally of not-yet-nuclear Iran.

Prima facie, Jihadist Iran is the primary patron of anti-Israel
terrorism,\[9\] both Sunni (Hamas) and Shiite (Hezbollah, Houthi).
Imminently, Israel's ongoing struggles against Iran-supported terrorism
could bring the Jewish State into direct and protracted conflict with
that adversarial state and derivatively with North Korea. It is likely
(e.g., see Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Jarida) that Iran has already supplied
Hezbollah and other proxies with electromagnetic ordnance, and that
terror-group use of these non-nuclear or NNEMP weapons could soon
initiate a direct and rapidly escalating Israeli war with Iran.

If such an unpredictable conflict should commence, both Israel and Iran
would strive for "escalation dominance," an inherently unstable
competition in which a still pre-nuclear Iran would struggle for
supremacy at a starkly presumptive disadvantage. Ironically, such an
Iranian strategic disadvantage -- one best explained by Israel's plainly
evident nuclear monopoly -- could worsen Israel's overall security
situation. This is because any such competition in risk-taking would
immediately accelerate Iran's search for an independent nuclear
deterrent. At the same time, any direct Iranian use of NNEMP weapons
could be countered (among several other options) by Israeli use of a
nuclear or NEMP retaliation.

There are further details, most of them similarly bewildering. Depending
on Iran's intra-war willingness to accept existential risks, Jerusalem
could sometime find itself in "active belligerent status" with
Pyongyang. In that unprecedented and worrisome status (a sui generis
status in the language of logic and science), belligerency could take
the form of direct military engagement with Iran's designated nuclear
proxy or with North Korea's nuclear and/or non-nuclear assets. These
North Korean assets could have previously been placed within the
decision--making ambit of Tehran.

Whatever North Korea's policy disposition on accepting nuclear surrogacy
for Iran, the prospects for a widening conflict would be "high." Because
all pertinent scenarios would lack historical precedent, there could
exist no science-based method of assigning numerical or statistical
probabilities. At the same time, per axiomatic principles of
mathematics, there would still remain reliable ways of conflict
estimation. Here, [the outbreak of a direct [nuclear
belligerency]{.mark} between Israel and North Korea could
[involve]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, [Russia]{.mark}
and/or [China]{.mark};]{.underline} and the precise forms of any such
superpower involvement would be indeterminable.

For Israel, the [[threats]{.underline}]{.mark} from Iran/North Korea
[are [**existential** and **palpable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Accordingly, the immediate question for Jerusalem is what should Israel
do now? Not much could be gained via direct diplomacy with Iran or North
Korea, but there could still be more-or-less calculable benefits for
Jerusalem in gaining certain supportive policy guarantees from
Washington.

But even such seemingly persuasive guarantees could fail. Jerusalem
would then have to plan urgently for a uniquely complex set of
decisional options. In these scenarios, even decipherable success in
keeping Iran non-nuclear might provide Israel no assurances of national
safety.\[10\] In these scenarios, all presumptions of Israeli success
would be sorely problematic.

Further clarifications will be needed. By definition, an **[[accidental
nuclear]{.mark} [war]{.mark}]{.underline}** [between Israel and
North]{.underline} Korea would be unintentional, but an unintentional
nuclear war would not necessarily be the result of an accident. An
unintentional nuclear war between Jerusalem and Pyongyang could
[represent the [outcome of]{.mark} **decision-making
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation** or irrationality by one or both
adversaries]{.underline}.\[11\] [Such a distressing understanding is
[**realistic** and]{.mark} **potentially
[probable]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Wednesday, and Moscow said
Israeli strikes [risked triggering a **nuclear

Russia signed a strategic partnership with Iran in January and also has
a relationship with Israel, although it has been strained by Moscow\'s
war in Ukraine. A Russian offer to mediate in the Israel-Iran conflict
has not been taken up.

Ryabkov, speaking on the sidelines of an economic forum in St
Petersburg, told Interfax news agency Moscow was urging
[Washington]{.underline} to refrain from [direct
involvement]{.underline}.

\"This would be a step that [**would radically destabilise** the entire
situation]{.underline},\" Interfax cited Ryabkov as saying, and
criticising such \"speculative, conjectural options.\"

The head of Russia\'s SVR foreign intelligence service, Sergei
Naryshkin, has said the situation between Iran and Israel is now
critical and Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the
Israeli [strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure meant the **world**

Trump has since repeatedly said that **[he [averted]{.mark} a [nuclear

and grumbled that he got no credit for it.

Pakistan agrees that **[[US diplomatic intervention ended the

Governments can nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize. There was no
immediate response from Washington, DC, or New Delhi.

Some analysts in Pakistan said the move might persuade Trump to think
again about potentially joining Israel in striking Iran's nuclear
facilities. Pakistan has condemned Israel's action as a violation of
international law and a threat to regional stability.

In a social media post on Friday, Trump gave a long list of conflicts he
said he had resolved, including India and Pakistan and the so-called
Abraham Accords in his first term between Israel and some
Muslim-majority countries. He added: "I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize no

the decades-old Kashmir dispute, describing such a move as consistent
with his desire [to resolve "**generational**"

The comment [follows a ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed

brief but intense military standoff involving fighter jets, missiles,
drones and artillery fire.

While **[tensions have eased]{.underline}**, longstanding
[issues]{.underline} remain [unresolved]{.underline}.

The US informed last month after the ceasefire announcement both India
and Pakistan had agreed to meet at a neutral venue to address their
differences, though New Delhi has so far publicly ruled out bilateral
talks with Islamabad.

"I can't speak to what's on the mind or the plans of the President,"
said State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce in response to a question
about the American president's offer to mediate after the ceasefire.

"What I do know is that I think we all recognize that President Trump in
each step that he takes, it's made to solve generational differences
between countries, generational war," she continued. "So it doesn't --
it shouldn't surprise anyone that he'd want to manage something like
that."

Bruce maintained [Trump]{.underline} had the [**ability** **to bring

Weeks after their worst military confrontation in decades, India and
Pakistan have dispatched top lawmakers to press their cases in the
United States, where President Donald [Trump]{.underline} has shown
[eagerness for diplomacy]{.underline} between them.

After crisscrossing the world, the delegations descended this week at
the same time on [Washington]{.underline}, which [**played a key

**nuclear-armed adversaries**]{.underline} in May.

In strikingly similar strategies, the rival delegations are both led by
veteran politicians who have been critical of their countries'
governments and are known for their ease in speaking to Western
audiences. Pakistan has embraced an active role for the Trump
administration while India, which has close relations with Washington,
has been more circumspect and has long refused outside mediation on the
flashpoint Himalayan territory of Kashmir.

"Just like the [United States and President Trump]{.underline} played a

He "acknowledged President [Trump's statesmanship and his ability

"A detailed exchange of views also took place on the prevailing tensions

exchange between the two regional arch foes that marks a week today.

The military noted that the engagement "marks a significant moment in
the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between
Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace,
stability, and prosperity".

Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the meeting a
"[milestone in Pak-US]{.underline} ties" and a "success of the current
hybrid model of governance".

"This is the most important turning point in the 78-year history of
relations. The way international and regional issues were discussed in

said on X.

He added that Pakistan's [abilities to help **resolve

"The revival of the economy, the defeat of India, the glorious and
highly successful improvement in relations with the US --- all these
revolutionary changes were possible with the cooperation of Prime
Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir and the excellent
relations between Islamabad and Rawalpindi."

Trump 'honoured' to meet army chief

When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media,
Trump said, "I was honoured to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.

"He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was
that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war \[with India\].
And I want to thank PM \[Narendra\] Modi as well, who just left a few
days ago," he added.

"We're **[working on a trade deal with India and
Pakistan]{.underline}**. These two very smart people decided not to keep
going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India
are two big nuclear powers."

Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump
said: "They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and
they're not happy about anything. It's not that they're bad with Israel.
They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better."

Questioned by reporters about the meeting prior to it, Trump remarked,
"This man (Gen Munir) was extremely influential in stopping it
(India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side."

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal
Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel
Peace Prize for preventing a nuclear war between India and Pakistan,
Reuters reported.

But insiders suggested that the [meeting was not arranged through
routine diplomatic channels]{.underline}, but rather was the [outcome of

### 2NC---Link---Arctic Trade-Off 

#### U.S. Arctic focus [expends political capital]{.underline} that's spread thin.

**Ribar '15** \[Matthew; January 5, 2015. Ph.D. candidate in Political
Science at Stanford University, recipient of a National Science
Foundation Graduate Student Fellowship. "U.S. Needs an Arctic Push."
International Policy Digest.
https://intpolicydigest.org/u-s-needs-an-arctic-push; mgm\]

[Historically, US foreign policy in the High North has been
**unambitious** and **low-priority**]{.underline}; the **[little
diplomatic capital]{.underline}** which was **[expended]{.underline}**
focused on resource extraction. That changed with the publication of a
comprehensive Arctic strategy in 2009, but there is still no U.S.
ambassador to the Arctic; the United States is represented at the Arctic
Council by Senior Arctic Official Julia L. Gourley. In June, the United
States appointed its first Special Representative to the Arctic, Bob
Papp. But neither of these positions convey the legitimacy of an
ambassador, or even the authority of a Special Envoy.

Though diplomatic rank may not seem like the most pressing issue in the
Arctic, it conveys the little priority the United States seems to put on
the Arctic. However, there are three clear areas in which the United
States could use an Arctic ambassador to push its policy agenda.

Taking the Lead in Energy Governance

The energy resources that are being explored in the Arctic are immense:
the US Geological Survey reports 90 billion barrels of oil and 1,670
trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Though commentators have argued that
the global need to reduce carbon output makes tapping difficult,
particularly in the context of the recent deal between the United States
and China to reduce carbon emissions. However, for better or for worse,
hydrocarbons will remain in demand for the foreseeable future, and if
Arctic extraction is economically viable, it will be attempted.
Moreover, much of this extraction has taken place under the aegis of
Gazprom, the Russian state oil giant, which has signed a deal to export
400 billion dollars' worth of natural gas to China over the next thirty
years. So while many countries have made a commitment to decarbonize,
Arctic petroleum reserves will still be extracted.

A policy goal in the 2014 "Implementation Plan for the National Strategy
for the Arctic Region," a document which outlines the US plan of action
for its chairmanship of the 2015 session of the Arctic Council is to
"ensure the safe and responsible development of non-renewable energy
resources."

What's clear is that there is a lot more to be done. Managing responses
to oil spills, making sure there is a regulatory regime for drilling,
and coordinating policy are all policy areas where US leadership could
be beneficial. The travails of Shell Oil in the Beaufort and Chuckchi
Seas show that these issues are not just abstractions. Shell Oil had
problems certifying a response plan to a potential oil spill, and the
drilling season was plagued by mishaps, including having to move the
drill ship to dodge a massive ice floe. While these incidents happened
relatively close to US shores, difficulties are sure to increase as
drilling activities go further out to sea.

A recent report from Bookings notes that managing the responsible
extraction of resources from the Arctic should be a priority of every
Arctic littoral state. It also argues that to achieve this, the United
States needs to broaden its involvement in the Arctic---the authors go
so far as to suggest that the Department of State establish a Polar
Bureau, much like its Bureau of African Affairs. Certainly, a [**greater
focus** from the **Department of State**]{.underline} would go a long
way [towards]{.underline} **[enacting these policy goals]{.underline}**.

Promoting Arctic Infrastructure

A [greater **network** of **infrastructure** needs to be
established]{.underline} in order for the littoral states to take full
advantage of emerging opportunities in the Arctic. The Arctic Maritime
and Aviation Initiative, a project of the Arctic Council tasked with
inventorying infrastructure in the Arctic Circle, notes a paucity of
ports, airstrips, and other necessary infrastructure within the Arctic
Circle. A lack of such a support network negates the utility of shipping
routes, and makes resource extraction near impossible.

Necessary infrastructure goes beyond airports and ports: a [support
network]{.underline} needs to be in place. A prime example of this is
the need for search and rescue teams and [icebreakers]{.underline}.
Currently the United States operates a single operational icebreaker;
search and rescue resources are likewise scarce, although there is an
agreement between the Arctic littoral states which establishes the
specific obligations of every state.

This is another opportunity for the United States to take the lead.
Clearly, some leadership is needed to organize and strengthen the
infrastructure in the Arctic, including support networks. Considering
that the United States will take the chair of the Arctic Council in
2015, it is logical for the United States to take the initiative in such
projects. Such leadership is more easily achieved from a position of
real leadership---lead by an ambassador.

Strengthening the Arctic Council

The easiest and most direct ways of accomplishing the aforementioned
goal is by way of existing institutions. The Arctic Council is the most
established international institution in the Arctic, handling most
internationally coordinated projects. It is also more inclusive than
similar institutions, with six groups of indigenous peoples represented
as permanent participants. As such, it is the ideal vehicle for
advancing a policy agenda.

Strengthening the Arctic Council should be the primary responsibility
for any future Arctic Ambassador, and presents another strong argument
for the necessity of such a position. Having a higher ranked negotiating
presence at Arctic Council meetings would increase US bargaining power;
in addition, the greater independence of an ambassadorial appointment
delegates more agency to the Arctic Council.

Though there is little doubt that Bob Papp will be working closely with
Julia Gourley to make US presence known at the Arctic Council, a full
ambassadorial appointment would no doubt increase the visibility of US
engagement with the council. The more the United States is engaged, the
more it can show its support for strengthening the council---this is the
way forward for the United States to use existing institutions to
achieve policy objectives in the High North.

The High North is one of the most dynamic and emerging regions in
international politics, demanding space on the policy agendas of all
Arctic littoral states. Eleven countries have posted Arctic ambassadors
in the past seven years. In order to guarantee a leadership position
consistent with US policy goals, it simply must shed its culture of
disengagement in the Arctic Circle. Though at the present [**US
diplomatic capital is spread** thin, with high-**priority
initiatives**]{.underline} in both East Asia and the Middle East, there
remains sufficient resources for the State Department to appoint a full
ambassador to the Arctic. From energy governance to Arctic
infrastructure to strengthening the Arctic Council, the United States
needs to appoint an ambassador to the Arctic to advance these essential
policies.

The answer is complex. Service branches are typically responsible for
implementing strategy, not serving as the initial source identifying and
setting **[Arctic strategy]{.underline}**. That role lies with civilian
policymakers and operational commanders. But the service branches
shouldn't be criticized for publishing strategy. They are often filling
a gap left by others, and they bring a needed perspective on
high-latitude training and acquisition --- as long as they are
sufficiently coordinated with the primary institutions responsible for
producing Arctic strategy. The answer to this mixed blessing of multiple
service Arctic documents is for the incoming Biden administration to
**[reenergize]{.underline}** White House and **[diplomatic strategies
for the region]{.underline}**, impose more coordination in the Defense
Department above the service branches and across geographic commands,
and refocus the Arctic defense conversation on critical near-term
investment needs.

Arctic as the Final Frontier

To understand why the service branches would produce these documents at
all, it is first necessary to explore why the Arctic is unique relative
to other theaters and who is interested in its development as a growing
frontier for the military.

The harsh and forbidding physical terrain of the region demands a
specific approach. Arctic operations benefit from specialized training
and materiel not immediately applicable in other theaters. A force that
is more active in the Arctic needs distinct acquisitions, from
icebreakers to high-latitude communications capabilities. A force that
is more active in the Arctic also needs specialized training, including
in maintaining and operating equipment in extreme cold. And because some
acquisitions or trainings are uniquely suited for the Arctic, they
impose opportunity costs on alternative platforms and skills with more
universal applications. So service spending on the Arctic comes with a
need to put the region in a much broader context than might be the case
for something like a destroyer, which can operate just as effectively in
the conditions of the Mediterranean as it can in the Pacific or south
Atlantic.

Another clear driver in the development of Arctic strategies is that
they are often a function of congressional interest. This is most
obviously the case with the Pentagon's 2019 Arctic strategy, which says
as much right in the name, "Report to Congress: Department of Defense
Arctic Strategy," but may also be evinced by the rise of Arctic
strategies as far afield as that of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration or the brand-new DHS strategy. Congressional focus on the
Arctic produces churn in the services and across the government ---
sometimes for the better. And while much of this is driven by the Alaska
delegation, Arctic interests are increasingly a bipartisan passion on
the Hill. It is this demand signal that has helped force the Arctic onto
the map for the Pentagon, and the service strategies are a product of
this push.

There are plenty of reasons why the Arctic may be an increasingly
important space for policymaking, as is intimated by the large
deployment of F-35 aircraft to Alaska or the rise in Navy deployments to
the Barents Sea. The region, once a final frontier of scientific
exploration, may now be the first frontier in a shifting global order
stressed by climate change, human migration, and resource competition.
Already, Russian activity in the north Pacific Arctic has accelerated,
as have Russian submarine deployments (which are historically centered
around the Arctic). U.S. Arctic infrastructure, which helps detect
inbound aerospace threats from missiles to aircraft, is both aged and
falling prey to permafrost thaw.

So, although the Arctic is both operationally distinct and increasingly
of interest to policymakers, this understanding alone does not explain
how the service branches became so prominent in drafting Arctic policy.

Service Branches Should Come Second

[**Service branch strategies** are **not** the **usual starting point**
for building Arctic defense policy because the services are not the
central actors for setting or implementing that policy]{.underline}.
Ideally, they should speak to the how --- organize, train, equip --- but
not the why, as the latter is the purview of those civilians who set
national and defense priorities. Civilians may publish these strategies
-- the service secretaries signed the strategies of both the Department
of the Navy and the Department of the Air Force -- and thus lend the
appearance of civilian oversight. But the services are not the nodal
point for setting foreign or defense policy, which is a larger issue of
the civil-military divide. The Office of the Secretary of Defense has
partially answered the mail on civilian oversight with the 2019 report
required by Congress, but with remaining gaps in direction from the
White House and State Department.

One reason why we see service branches taking on leading roles in Arctic
policy development may stem from the fact that [U.S. national Arctic
strategy is **fragmented** among civilian agencies]{.underline}. Extant
guidance spans at least three presidents, stretching back to National
Security Presidential Directive 66 in the final days of the Bush
administration and on into the Obama era's 2013 national strategy (which
has yet to be replaced). There is, moreover, an **[unusually large
interagency footprint for the Arctic]{.underline}** as compared to some
other regions. When looking at the various institutional executors for
the tasks set out in the 2016 implementation framework for the 2013
strategy, it is evident that the Defense Department (let alone the
services) is not the only major player. The Coast Guard, the State
Department, NOAA, the Department of the Interior, and the Environmental
Protection Agency dominated the taskings. The Department of Defense
arises sparingly. Service strategies fit into a much more robust
national civilian architecture of Arctic equities that are difficult for
the services to navigate without more help at higher levels in the
Pentagon.

Further, that the various service branches release separate strategies
may partially be a function of the military's own fractured command and
control of the Arctic. At the joint level, Northern Command and European
Command divide responsibility for the Arctic (with the former the
official resource advocate). At the service level, it can be even more
fractured, as with the Navy's split of Arctic responsibilities across
elements of the Second, Third, and Sixth fleets. Without a clear leader
among the service branches, much less atop them at the civilian policy
level, each service branch is adopting aspects of Arctic policymaking
under its own aegis, further splintering the region's responsibilities.

The result of service strategies proliferating in this context is a lot
of energy being spent on thinking about what services need for
competition in the Arctic (again, an important debate) but a much less
robust institutional U.S. government view on what the purpose and nature
of that competition should be. [The more services rush to answer the
how]{.underline}, without better guidance on the why, [the harder it
becomes to make **informed decisions** about **prioritizing limited
resources**]{.underline}**.** And while the [Arctic]{.underline} may be
rising in prominence, so long as it **[remains secondary]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} the Defense Department to Europe and **[the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}** (and even the Persian Gulf, in practice), it
will remain [critical to **assign resources** based on a comprehensive
sense of strategic guidance and operational requirements]{.underline}.
[The **Arctic**]{.underline} thereby [risks being a region where
strategies can score **rhetorical points** while **deferring costs to
other actors**]{.underline}**,** in contrast to areas where geography
and commander are more clearly aligned. In such an environment, threats
and challenges in the Arctic risk being framed as existing mostly in the
not too distant future, which is another way of saying not right now.

The [Arctic becoming a **strategic** **battleground**]{.underline} was
explicitly acknowledged in June 2024 through the U.S. Department of
Defense's Arctic Strategy, noting growing Russian-Chinese collaboration.
Despite major combat losses in Ukraine, Russia continues to expand its

complicated by the **American strategic focus** on]{.underline}
countering China in [the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. NATO represents an
ideal form of Arctic burden-sharing, allowing the United States [to
**concentrate elsewhere**]{.underline}.

**[As the Trump administration pivots back to Asia]{.underline}**,
maintaining strong NATO ties is crucial, despite rhetoric to the
contrary. NATO has been tying its strategic survival to an Indo-Pacific
pivot since 2019, and the Trump administration will need to rely more on
Arctic-minded NATO allies to deter Russian and Chinese ambitions. [The
U.S. military has **minimal forces capable of operating** in the Arctic
but also needs to defend its space-based infrastructure around the
region.]{.underline} By leveraging NATO, particularly the Arctic
expertise of British, Canadian, and Nordic allies, the United States can
ensure a stable Arctic presence, enabling a robust military posture in
the Indo-Pacific.

The Strategic Importance of the Arctic

The Arctic has become a unique arena of global competition. It is the
sole area of the world where both Russia and China operate in close
proximity to North America across various domains. Melting sea ice and
technological advances have increased accessibility, transforming the
Arctic from a "strategic buffer" to a hotspot for valuable resources
like oil, gas, rare earth minerals, and new fisheries, as well as
opening shorter sea routes between Europe and Asia. This increased
accessibility unlocks immense economic potential, including an estimated
90 billion barrels of undiscovered oil, 30 percent of the world's
undiscovered natural gas, and \$1 trillion in rare earth minerals.
However, these opportunities bring heightened competition, where the
growing Chinese and Russian presence directly challenges U.S. and NATO
interests.

The Arctic has long been central to Russia's identity and security,
controlling 53 percent of Arctic coastline, and its Arctic policy
identifies its economic and security needs. As the ice melts, the region
becomes a real security concern for both Russia and the United States.
The Arctic is crucial to Russia's economy, accounting for 10 percent of
Russian GDP and 20 percent of exports. Russia has expanded its military
footprint, reopening Soviet-era bases, deploying advanced missile
systems, and investing in nuclear-powered icebreakers. The Kola
Peninsula, home to most of Russia's ballistic missile submarines,
underscores the Arctic's role in Russia's nuclear deterrence strategy.
Moreover, Russia attempts to control the Northern Sea Route, challenging
international norms of freedom of navigation, posing a direct threat to
NATO's Northern Flank and member states' economic interests.

China's Arctic activities further complicate the security landscape.
Despite not being an Arctic nation, China has declared itself a
"near-Arctic state" and seeks influence through its Polar Silk Road
initiative. These efforts, often dual-use, support military objectives.
Sino-Russian joint Arctic exercises, including coast guard and naval
patrols as well as joint bomber patrols, demonstrate increased military
alignment against the United States. They pose a strategic challenge to
NATO and the defense of the American homeland, by combining Russia's
military presence with China's economic and technological capabilities.

NATO's Valuable Arctic Expertise

Converging Russian and Chinese interests both in and beyond the Arctic
requires the United States to work by, with, and through allies to
counter threats in the region. Traditionally, the United States has
enjoyed unrivaled military dominance, but in the Arctic, it now faces an
emerging alliance between two formidable competitors. This situation
underscores the need for a collaborative approach with NATO allies to
ensure preparedness for a crisis in the Arctic. American dominance
cannot be taken for granted. In the Arctic, U.S. capabilities are not
enough to counter Russia, let alone a Sino-Russian alliance.

Per our recently published research, [**successful military operations**
in the **Arctic** require not **only specialized equipment** but also
**dedicated training** and **doctrine** for polar warfare. Arctic
operations are **uniquely challenging**, with **complex** **logistics**,
extreme **weather**, and **seasonal** shifts like polar days and
nights]{.underline}. Accordingly, [**building Arctic-ready** forces
requires "the **deliberate education** and **development** of
**Arctic-minded leaders** alongside **collaboration** with allies and
partners to foster enhanced cold weather war-fighting capabilities
across the spectrum]{.underline}." Arctic warfighting requires more than
just specialized equipment --- rather, it demands the **[dedicated
attention of those troops]{.underline}** who will be assigned to conduct
it. Lessons learned from previous Arctic conflicts include the need for
cold weather warfare training and equipment, [dedicated polar
war-fighting doctrine, **joint operations,** **interoperability**,
**mobility** in Arctic conditions, planning for increased **supplies**
and **unique logistics**]{.underline}**,** [Arctic **domain awareness**
and intelligence, **space weather** disrupting command and control,
inimitable **polar weather** issues associated with polar days and
nights, controlling Arctic sea lines of **communication**, and ensuring
unity of command.]{.underline}

Fortunately, NATO already has much of the necessary infrastructure in
place with the Nordics. For instance, the British-led Joint
Expeditionary Force was established in 2014 and emphasized Arctic
warfare capabilities with Nordic military forces in the High North. More
recent developments include the establishment of a NATO Multi-Corps Land
Component Command in Finland, the formation of a Nordic Air Force, and
the creation of a NATO Commander Task Force Baltic in the German port
city of Rostock. All reflect a boost in NATO's cohesion, capability, and
communication, helping establish the "3 Cs of Deterrence" around the
Arctic Circle.

NATO's role in defending the Arctic has grown increasingly vital, and
the alliance can capitalize on the polar expertise of its Arctic
countries. Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Sweden, and Finland are
highly trained in cold-weather warfare, have a deep understanding of
Arctic operations, and are geographically positioned to respond quickly
to threats in the region. Moreover, the Nordic countries are jointly
negotiating the procurement of an infantry fighting vehicle specifically
for the subarctic climate.

Finland's expertise in Arctic warfare can be traced to the Winter War
(1939--1940), when it held off a numerically superior Soviet invasion
force longer and better than expected due to superior tactics adapted to
its unique Arctic environment, before ultimately losing. Finland's
contributions to NATO include substantial ground forces and long-range
fires. Likewise, Norway hosts the NATO Centre of Excellence for Cold
Weather Operations. Sweden's recent ascension to NATO bolsters the air
capabilities and industrial base of the alliance while Denmark's Joint
Arctic Command provides critical presence, experience, and capability.
Canada has long been a key U.S. partner in the Arctic as a part of the
bi-national North American Air Defense Command.

While Canada and the Nordics specialize more in Arctic warfighting, NATO
still faces significant military capability gaps in the Arctic. To
effectively counter potential aggression from Russia and China in the
Arctic, NATO needs to strengthen its ability to conduct a range of
specialized military operations in the Arctic including long-range
fires, multi-domain awareness, air and missile defense, attack aviation,
amphibious operations, and the logistical sustainment of resilient
forces capable of enduring prolonged engagements in harsh polar
conditions.

NATO faces specific challenges in Arctic naval readiness, particularly
in ice-capable vessels and icebreakers, which are an "important element
of Arctic sovereignty." Russia holds a clear advantage with 46
icebreakers, Project 22100 Ocean Patrol Vessels, and its new ice-capable
Project 23550 ships. These vessels offer Russia a massive Arctic
advantage enabling superior presence and mobility. NATO should focus on
building additional vessels like Canada's Harry DeWolf Arctic Offshore
Patrol Ships and an updated version of Denmark's Thetis-class frigates.
The recently penned collaborative ICE Pact between the United States,
Canada, and Finland is a step in the right direction for bolstering
their respective industrial bases to build more icebreakers.
Additionally, partnerships with non-NATO allies that have icebreakers,
such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia, could support NATO operations
in the Arctic if needed in a crisis. For current gaps in Arctic
coverage, NATO needs more anti-access and area denial capabilities to
pose a credible threat to Russian operations. NATO needs to embark on a
sustained investment campaign to bolster its Arctic deterrence
capabilities both on land and at sea in the Arctic.

Minimal Arctic Capabilities

The United States needs NATO for Arctic stability, due to struggles in
committing tangible resources to the Arctic besides more hollow
strategies. Increasing Arctic-specific training, expanding icebreaking
capabilities, and enhancing interoperability with Canada, the Nordics,
and Arctic-minded countries (such as the United Kingdom) are essential
steps for projecting force in the Arctic. Training exercises like Arctic
Edge and the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center Rotation 24-02
demonstrate progress but should be scaled up to counter the threat posed
by the growing Sino-Russian alliance. The United States also maintains
critical Arctic installations --- including Pituffik Space Base in
Greenland, which serves as a critical hub for missile defense and
satellite communications --- but more Arctic bases are needed to
effectively compete in the region. Similarly, the U.S. Army established
the 11th Airborne Division "Arctic Angels" in 2022 at Anchorage, Alaska,
with 11,000 soldiers focused on extreme cold weather operations.
However, it is problematic that this unit maintains "readiness for
global deployments ... \[and\] for large-scale combat operations" when
it should be wholly focused on polar warfare. Worse, the unit struggles
with numerous internal morale issues.

The [United States]{.underline} ought to go further in [building its
Arctic capabilities,]{.underline} by ramping up its Arctic-specific
training programs and investing in research and development aimed at
enhancing cold-weather operational capabilities. This includes expanding
its fleet of icebreakers, which is currently insufficient to conduct the
necessary peacetime missions, let alone support a potential conflict in
the region. However, [these initiatives are **unlikely** due to the
**Arctic** being a **low priority** under **current global force
management postures**]{.underline}. [**Ruthless defense prioritization**
means the Arctic will likely continue to be neglected,]{.underline}
despite growing risks. Thus, the United States should foster greater
cooperation with its NATO Arctic allies, particularly Canada and the
Nordics, to ensure a coordinated and effective response to any potential
crisis in the region. Undergirding that should be civil society
engagement with indigenous populations around the Arctic Circle in a
mutually beneficial way to ensure their security and to partner with
them to increase Arctic domain awareness.

A Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for the Arctic

Canada, the Nordics, and other Arctic-minded allies should lead NATO in
Arctic defense as the United States pivots to counter China in the
Indo-Pacific. The combined Sino-Russian threat is global, and the United
States needs allies to share the burden of defense. The United States
and NATO should leverage the expertise of Arctic allies to establish a
Nordic-led Arctic-focused Combined Joint Expeditionary Force within
NATO, allowing the alliance to establish a dedicated force as a credible
deterrent in the Arctic.

Forming a Nordic-led Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for the Arctic
would reduce the **[strain on U.S. forces.]{.underline}** NATO lacks an
Arctic strategy other than an October 2024 statement about defending
"Allied interests in the Arctic." NATO needs a comprehensive Arctic
strategy that leads to investments in infrastructure, training, and
equipment to match Russian power in the Arctic. Without proper
resourcing, Russia will keep dominating the Arctic, making it less safe
for international trade, freedom of navigation, and rule of law.
Sino-Russian dominance of the Arctic has severe implications for global
security and economic stability. Through collective action and improved
Arctic-specific readiness, NATO can deter Sino-Russian aggression in the
Arctic while supporting a U.S. shift to the Indo-Pacific.

[Faced with **Limited Resources** and **Changing Priorities**,

[**U.S. engagement** can take on many forms]{.underline}**,** ranging
from humanitarian assistance to [diplomacy to military
action]{.underline}. [Given **finite resources and** capacities, the
**United States** must often **make hard choices** on **how much

situations]{.underline}. [It **cannot invest equally** in every crisis
or **potential crisis**]{.underline}. In intervening in these
situations, [**decisionmakers** must be **careful** and **sensitive** in
setting ground rules for engagement since intervention is never
impartial]{.underline}---it can decide, for better or worse, who
governs, who eats, and who survives. At the same time, setting rules for
where, when, and how to intervene has become more difficult as U.S.
interests in Africa have become harder to define following the end of
the Cold War.

The reality is that [decisions are made on **a case-by-case

**[triage]{.underline}** process **[is inevitable,]{.underline}**
whereby possible types and places of intervention are ordered in terms

security interests are at stake; where a crisis risks having broad,
regional consequences; where the United States is expected to take the
lead; where the United States can usefully follow the lead of others

stake and where domestic public opinion demands that the United States
provide policy leadership. The United States must also take into account

For some time after the end of the Cold War in 1989, it was common to
think that the world had entered a new era in which great power
competition would be a thing of the past. But instead, the world has
entered a [new]{.underline} era of [geopolitical
competition]{.underline} between states---an era where competitors like
the U.S. and China each attempt to win vital allies to their side
[through **battles of strategic diplomacy**]{.underline}, and one where
the U.S. is regrettably falling behind.

As the Biden administration's latest national security strategy makes
clear, the coming years will be critical for deciding which nation will
lead the international order. Of all the countries in the world, the
only one that can effectively challenge the United States for global
leadership is the People's Republic of China. To protect America's
national interests, policymakers in Washington must be aware of the
nature and scope of the challenges from Beijing.

It has become unambiguous that China is the most capable adversary the
United States is currently facing. It is under the absolute control of
the Chinese Communist Party, which is devious, cruel, and predatory. Its
military and economic capacity and calculated willingness to challenge
America and its allies around the world on almost all strategic fronts
constitute a threat of unprecedented proportions.

In particular, as Politico explained in a recent special report,
currently, regrettably, [the United States no longer claims an advantage
in diplomatic terms]{.underline} compared to China, and it is more
pronounced when it comes to developing countries.

As the report explains, the disadvantage is somewhat the [result
of]{.underline} U.S. disengagement in some regions, a deemphasis on the
trade and investment element of diplomacy, a dearth in the confirmation
of ambassadors, and a [**failure to focus strategic**
**assistance**]{.underline} on areas that the developing world
prioritizes.

Regarding that last element, American support focuses on "providing
technical assistance to governments on everything from education to
fighting corruption," according to the report. That support is
beneficial, but infrastructure projects, which China prioritizes, are
more valued.

As is well documented, China, for its part, doesn't care about human
rights and how a regime it works with comes to power. China merely
claims to want to do business and presents its economic development
model for lifting people out of poverty without free market democracy as
more effective and beneficial than the U.S. model.

China has been expanding its diplomatic staff and presence around the
world. In addition, China focuses on helping these developing countries
with projects such as its Belt and Road Initiative, which is China's
ambitious geoeconomic connectivity initiative. This massive
infrastructure project would stretch from East Asia to Europe.

This economic largesse has boosted China's diplomatic advantages
compared to the United States. However, Belt and Road have yet to be an
absolute success. China has had to rein in the program as countries have
grown increasingly wary of participating in it.

The overall challenges from China on various policy fronts are still
unnerving for the U.S. Yet the United States can and must win the
geopolitical, diplomatic competition. As Heritage Foundation's Vice
President for Foreign Policy James Carafano succinctly underscored in
"In a New Kind of War, the Old Wars of Ideas Are Back," which highlights
the importance of winning the critical battle of ideas, "We can't win
without being proactive."

To that end, there needs to be a greater emphasis on improving our
foreign service. For instance, there should be a drive to recruit more
experts and diplomatic staff that understand Latin America and Africa,
so they can effectively represent American interests in those regions.

From a broader perspective, a [key]{.underline} element of [soft yet
effective diplomatic power is pragmatic]{.underline} economic
[engagements]{.underline}. America will help itself and the world more
if it moves from handing out aid to creating real partnerships. To that
end, for instance, the International Development Finance Corporation
needs to be more strategic. This development agency helps finance
overseas infrastructure and other projects so that America can compete
with infrastructure development, but **[it needs to be better
focused.]{.underline}**

Last but not least, [the United States **needs to reassess its
priorities**]{.underline}. Instead of propagating far-left goals in its
foreign policy, such as promoting abortion, the U.S. must focus on its
national interests and develop a plan to achieve its goals. These sorts
of **[policies]{.underline}**, while pleasing to the left side of the
political spectrum, [**divert scarce diplomatic capital** from advancing
core U.S. interests and undermine diplomatic relations]{.underline} with
more conservative nations.

generated goods judged as at a premium by the mission's "owner" and
NATO's prime hegemonic ally, the United States;

•the "servants", those contributing goods deemed of lower demand by the
"owner", but wishing to retain NATO for a miscellany of reasons short of
alliance dependence; and, finally,

•the "onlookers", those with weak motivation who contributed

Thus, in the context of Baltic hopes and fears, the optimum opportunity
presented by ISAF was a chance to enhance diplomatic capital through
"striving". The ultimate benefit of which being increased access to
hegemonic allies and, in turn, a greater platform to influence NATO
policy in the Baltic Sea region. On the other hand, as the goods seen as
at a premium by ISAF's leadership required strenuous efforts to produce,
the risks of ISAF for the Baltic states consisted in a [worry over
domestic political, **resource** or **expertise** **constraints**
preventing them from generating contributions of premium demand. This in
turn could lead to **negative diplomatic capital**, with]{.underline}
fledgling [**reputations** **damaged**]{.underline} and the label of

#### Only U.S. mediation can be the [off-ramp]{.underline} to end hostilities.

After four days of intense hostilities and concerns that India and
Pakistan would engage in an all-out war, [the US played a decisive
active role in mediating a ceasefire]{.underline} between the two
countries [over]{.underline} the disputed [Kashmir]{.underline} region.

But foreign policy experts and diplomats from both countries believe
that though the de-escalation might mark the end of the two countries\'
worst military confrontation in 25 years, the foreign-brokered ceasefire
will not lead easily to an enduring peace.

[**US mediation** provided a **useful off-ramp** for both
nations,]{.underline} according to diplomatic analysts from both
countries. \"The US has played a helpful role in getting Pakistan to
agree to a ceasefire,\" Meera Shankar, India\'s former envoy to the US,
told DW.

\"The US leveraged IMF conditionalities and much more to **[hasten the
end of hostilities]{.underline}**,\" said Ajay Bisaria, a former Indian
high commissioner to Pakistan. \"India has established a new doctrinal
normal of zero tolerance to terrorism, which has garnered US
acceptance.\"

Both sides \'made their point\'

Analysts on the Pakistani side agreed. \"[Pakistan and India both needed
a ceasefire but neither country wanted to be the one that
asked]{.underline} for it first due to national pride and leaders\'
egos. [The US helped provide **cover** for the decision]{.underline},\"
Husain Haqqani, a former Pakistani ambassador currently senior fellow at
Washington DC\'s Hudson Institute, told DW.

According to Haqqani, India wanted Pakistan to know that terrorist
incidents will not be ignored. Pakistan wanted to convey to India that
it will not roll over and play dead. Both sides have made their point,
he said.

Haqqani also believes that both countries used the military escalation
to test the other\'s resolve and find the strengths and weaknesses of
their defenses. \"Both realize that they cannot prevail in a war without
inflicting and sustaining massive destruction,\" said Haqqani.

Maleeha Lodhi, an international affairs expert and former Pakistan
ambassador to the US and UN, also thought said the [**Trump**
**administration\'s** role had been **indispensable**. **\"In all past
crises** between the two adversaries since 1999 the **US has mediated to
bring them** to an end]{.underline},\" she said.

Lodhi thinks that easing tensions will take a longer time. \"The
[**ceasefire will hold** as both countries have agreed to it and have no
advantage in violating it.]{.underline} However, [**easing tensions**
will take **much longer**]{.underline}**,\"** she added.

#### [Only]{.underline} U.S.-led diplomacy solves---no one else is credible.

The line of control slices like a sword cut across the mountain ranges
of Kashmir, the Himalayan territory bitterly disputed by [India and
Pakistan]{.underline} for almost 80 years. Time and again, the [enemies
have come to blows only for calm to be restored, often **with American
mediation**]{.underline}.

Do not assume that the pattern must always repeat itself. The latest
crisis was triggered by a heinous terrorist attack on a tourist camp
inside Indian-administered Kashmir last month, claiming 26 civilian
lives. India retaliated on Tuesday by striking nine targets in
Pakistani-administered Kashmir and elsewhere in its neighbour.

As a [spiral **bloodshed threatens** to take hold between **two nuclear
powers**, who will **mediate a resolution**]{.underline}? We could once
have [assumed that **America** would **step forward** to lead a
concerted effort to broker de-escalation]{.underline}. When India and
Pakistan mobilised for war in 2002, Colin Powell, the late US secretary
of state, engaged in **[shuttle diplomacy]{.underline}** [**between
New** Delhi and **Islamabad**]{.underline}, joined by our then Foreign
Secretary, Jack Straw.

Will anything like this happen now? Donald Trump scorns the idea of an
American obligation to resolve distant crises, even between
nuclear-armed states. Today his only comment was: "I just hope it ends
very quickly."

But it may not end just by itself. The leaders of India and Pakistan
surely understand the potentially **[catastrophic consequences of
further escalation]{.underline}**. Having skirmished along the line of
control for decades, they are adept at managing their rivalry,
signalling resolve to domestic audiences while also offering subtly
conciliatory messages to decision-makers on the other side.

Today's statement from the Indian defence ministry was a masterpiece of
this genre, announcing "focused strikes" on "terrorist infrastructure"
inside its neighbour, while also stressing that "no Pakistani military
facilities were hit, reflecting India's calibrated and non-escalatory
approach".

Today, Pakistan's own retaliation seems both inevitable and imminent. If
General Asim Munir, the Pakistani military chief, achieves a similar
balance between robustness and restraint, this crisis could yet
dissipate.

But General Munir may have no wish to de-escalate. His proclaimed
doctrine, after all, is to return a heavier blow than any that Pakistan
receives. He also leads a morally bankrupt military establishment which
has for decades armed and hosted terrorist groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba,
whose sole purpose is to attack India.

Whether Mr Trump wishes it or not, **[America is the only credible
mediator in this crisis]{.underline}**. [The **EU does not have the
geopolitical weigh**t. **China**, as Pakistan's closest ally, is
**mistrusted by India**]{.underline}. It was, in retrospect, an
unfortunate coincidence that Sir Keir Starmer should have concluded a
free trade agreement with India on Tuesday only hours before the latter
fired missiles at Pakistan. In any case, [Britain can only have a
credible role if **America takes the lead**.]{.underline}

The U.S. chose a qualitatively different crisis role than in the past.
Rather than seeking to lead international crisis diplomacy, it took a
hands-off approach, leaving India to adjust its strategy. Aboard Air
Force one, on April 25, President Trump remarked \"They\'ll get it
figured out one way or the other." \"There\'s great tension between
Pakistan and India, but there always has been." He also did not commit
to contacting the leadership of the two countries. The [U.S.
administration]{.underline} was also [**not active** in **coordinating
crisis diplomacy** globally]{.underline}, leaving **[other
capitals]{.underline}** -- [**none** with the **heft** and **influence**
the **U.S. has had over New Delhi and Islamabad**]{.underline} -- to
fill the vacuum. The [**Gulf countries**, China, and European
countries]{.underline} all urged restraint through statements and direct
contacts with Indian and Pakistani officials but [none even **remotely
hinted at support** for any military action]{.underline} (from either
side). U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio did speak to Indian and
Pakistani decision makers on April 30, again primarily to urge
restraint.

## Impact: Indo-Pak

### 2NC---!---India-Pakistan war

#### Even limited nuclear war spills over to extinction.

**Roblin 20** \[Sebastien; February 16, 2020. Journalist with Master\'s

instructor for the Peace Corps in China "Nowhere On Earth Would Be Safe
From An India-Pakistan Nuclear War." The National Interest.

mgm\]

Some commenters have callously suggested that means a "[limited regional
nuclear war]{.underline}" would remain an Indian and Pakistani problem.
[People find it difficult to assess the]{.underline} risk of rare but
[**catastrophic** **events**; after all, a **full-scale nuclear
war**]{.underline} has never occurred before, though it has come close
to happening.

[Such assessments are not only shockingly cold-hearted but
**shortsighted**]{.underline}. In fact, [several studies have modeled
the global impact of a "limited" ten-day nuclear war in which India and
Pakistan]{.underline} each exchange fifty 15-kiloton nuclear bombs
equivalent in yield to the Little Boy uranium bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

Their findings concluded that [**spillover** would in no way be
"limited,"]{.underline} directly impacting people across the globe that
would struggle to locate Kashmir on a map.

And those results are merely a conservative baseline, as India and
Pakistan are estimated to possess over 260 warheads. Some likely have
yields exceeding 15-kilotons, which is relatively small compared to
modern strategic warheads.

Casualties

Recurring terrorist attacks by Pakistan-sponsored militant groups over
the status of India's Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir state have
repeatedly led to threats of a conventional military retaliation by New
Delhi.

[Pakistan]{.underline}, in turn, maintains it [may use nuclear weapons
as a **first-strike weapon** to **counter**-**balance** India's superior
**conventional forces**]{.underline}. [Triggers]{.underline} could
[involve]{.underline} the [destruction of a large part of Pakistan's
military or penetration]{.underline} by Indian forces deep [into
Pakistani territory]{.underline}. [Islamabad]{.underline} also claims it
might [authorize a strike in event of a damaging Indian
blockade]{.underline} [or political destabilization]{.underline}
instigated by India.

India's official policy is that it will never be first to strike with
nuclear weapons---but that once any nukes are used against it, [New
Dehli will unleash an **all-out retaliation**.]{.underline}

The Little Boy bomb alone killed around 100,000 Japanese---between 30 to
40 percent of Hiroshima's population---and destroyed 69 percent of the
buildings in the city. But Pakistan and India host some of the most
populous cities on the planet, with the population densities of
Calcutta, Karachi and Mumbai at or exceeding 65,000 people per square
mile. Thus, even low-yield bombs could cause tremendous casualties.

A 2014 study estimates that the immediate effects of the bombs---the
fireball, over-pressure wave, radiation burns etc.---would kill twenty
million people. An earlier study estimated a hundred 15-kiloton nuclear
detonations could kill twenty-six million in India and eighteen million
in Pakistan---and concluded that escalating to using 100-kiloton
warheads, which have [greater blast radius and overpressure waves that
can **shatter hardened** structures, would **multiply death tolls
four-fold**.]{.underline}

Moreover, these projected body counts [omit the secondary effects of
**nuclear blasts**]{.underline}. Many [survivors of the initial
explosion would suffer **slow, lingering deaths** due to **radiation
exposure**.]{.underline} The [**collapse** of **healthcare**,
**transport**, **sanitation**, **water** and economic **infrastructure**
would also claim **many more lives**. Nuclear blasts could also trigger
**deadly firestorms**.]{.underline} For instance, a firestorm caused by
the U.S. napalm bombing of Tokyo in March 1945 killed more people than
the Fat Man bomb killed in Nagasaki.

Refugee Outflows

The civil war in Syria caused over 5.6 million refugees to flee abroad
out of a population of 22 million prior to the conflict. Despite the
relative stability and prosperity of the European nations to which
refugees fled, this outflow triggered political backlashes that have
rocked virtually every major Western government.

Now consider likely [**population movements** in event of a nuclear war
between India-Pakistan, which together total over 1.5 billion
people]{.underline}. [Nuclear bombings]{.underline}---or their even
their mere potential---would likely [cause many]{.underline}
city-dwellers [to flee]{.underline} to the countryside to lower their
odds of being caught in a nuclear strike. Wealthier citizens, numbering
in tens of millions, would use their resources to flee abroad.

Should bombs begin dropping, poorer citizens many begin pouring over
land borders such as those with Afghanistan and Iran for Pakistan, and
Nepal and Bangladesh for India. These poor states would struggle to
supports tens of millions of refugees. China also borders India and
Pakistan---but historically Beijing has not welcomed refugees.

Some citizens may undertake risky voyages at sea on overloaded boats,
setting their sights on South East Asia and the Arabian Peninsula.
[Thousands would surely drown]{.underline}. Many regional governments
would turn them back, as they have refugees of conflicts in Vietnam,
Cambodia and Myanmar in the past.

Fallout

[Radioactive fallout would also be **disseminated across the
globe**.]{.underline} The fallout from the Chernobyl explosion, for
example, wound its way westward from Ukraine into Western Europe,
exposing 650,000 persons and contaminating 77,000 square miles. The
long-term health effects of the exposure could last decades. India and
Pakistan's neighbors would be especially exposed, and most lack
healthcare and infrastructure to deal with such a crisis.

Nuclear Winter

Studies in 2008 and 2014 found that if one hundred 15-kiloton bombs were
used, it [would blast five million tons of **fine**, sooty particles
into the stratosphere, where they would **spread across the
globe**]{.underline}**, [warping]{.underline}** [global weather
patterns]{.underline} for the next twenty-five years.

The [particles would **block out light from the sun**]{.underline},
causing surface [temperatures to decrease]{.underline} an average of 2.7
degrees Fahrenheit across the globe, [or 4.5 degrees in North American
and Europe]{.underline}. Growing seasons would be shortened by ten to
forty days, and certain crops such as Canadian wheat would simply become
unviable. Global agricultural yields would fall, leading to rising
prices and famine.

The [particles]{.underline} may also [deplete]{.underline} between 30 to
[50 percent of the **ozone layer**]{.underline}, allowing more of the
[sun's radiation to penetrate the atmosphere, causing increased
**sunburns** and rates of **cancer** and **killing off sensitive
plant-life** and **marine plankton**, with the spillover effect of
**decimating fishing yields.**]{.underline}

To be clear, [these are outcomes for a "**light" nuclear winter
scenario**, not a full slugging match between the **Russian and U.S.
arsenals**.]{.underline}

Global Recession

Any one of the factors above would likely [suffice to cause a **global
economic recession**]{.underline}. All of them combined would guarantee
one.

India and Pakistan account for over one-fifth world's population, and
therefore a significant share of economic activity. Should their major
cities become irradiated ruins with their populations decimated, a
tremendous disruption would surely result. A massive decrease in
consumption and production would obviously instigate a long-lasting
recessionary cycle, with attendant deprivations and political
destabilization slamming developed and less-developed countries alike.

Taken together, these outcomes mean even a "limited" India-Pakistan
nuclear war would significantly **[affect every person on the
globe]{.underline}**, be they a school teacher in Nebraska, a
factory-worker in Shaanxi province or a fisherman in Mombasa.

[[Iran]{.mark}'s foreign minister]{.underline} Abbas Araghchi
[[declared]{.underline}]{.mark} on Sunday that the [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has [crossed "the **most dangerous red
line**]{.mark}]{.underline}" [by launching **[overnight
strikes]{.mark}** on key Iranian nuclear sites]{.underline}, warning
that **[[diplomacy is no longer on the table]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
that the US bears full responsibility for what comes next.

"[There is no red line left that the US hasn't crossed]{.underline},"
Araghchi told reporters in Istanbul. "The last and most dangerous one
was what happened only last night when they crossed a very big red line
by attacking nuclear facilities."

He [added]{.underline}, "[The **[door to diplomacy]{.mark}**
[should]{.mark} always [be open]{.mark}, but **this is [not the
case]{.mark} right now**]{.underline}."

This marks the first official Iranian response since US President Donald
Trump announced that American B-2 bombers, supported by
submarine-launched Tomahawk missiles, had struck Iran's Fordo, Natanz,
and Isfahan nuclear sites. Trump claimed the sites were "completely and
fully obliterated," calling it a "historic moment" and warning Tehran
that "there will either be peace or there will be tragedy for Iran."

The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran confirmed the sites had been hit
but insisted that the program "cannot be stopped." The IAEA said there
was no sign of radiation leakage but would continue to monitor the
situation.

[Iran']{.underline}s foreign ministry [[accused Washington of
"betraying]{.mark} **[diplomacy]{.mark}**" and [launching **"a
dangerous**]{.mark} **[war]{.mark}."**]{.underline} [It vowed to
[respond with "**full** **force**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

"The warmongering, lawless administration in Washington is solely and
fully responsible for the dangerous consequences and far-reaching
implications of its act of aggression," Araghchi said.

Shortly after the US strikes, Iran launched 40 missiles at Israel,
injuring over 80 people and damaging several buildings. Israel
retaliated with fresh strikes on military targets in western Iran. The
Israeli military has reported being on high alert for a prolonged
conflict.

Meanwhile, global leaders have raised alarm. UN Secretary-General
António Guterres called the situation "[a [dangerous

The Israeli attack plan involved precise coordination. Mossad commandos
and drones had been pre-positioned, and [waiting several days for
talks]{.underline} -- [which Trump was **pessimistic**
about]{.underline} **[anyway]{.underline}** -- would have compromised
the prospects for the whole operation as well as the safety of Israelis
already behind Iranian lines.

The [**diplomatic option** was]{.underline} almost [certainly **doomed
from the** start]{.underline}. After some initial wavering immediately
after the Israeli attack began[, Trump stuck to the **inflexible** and
**maximalist** **position** that Iran **stop enriching uranium
permanently**]{.underline} -- now one of Israel's primary war aims.

Once the operation had begun, Trump quickly swung his support behind it,
noting on his Truth Social platform: "Two months ago I gave Iran a
60-day ultimatum to 'make a deal'. They should have done it! Today is
day 61. I told them what to do, but they just couldn't get there. Now
they have, perhaps, a second chance!"

The "second chance" seemed to be an option to return to the table and
bow to Trump's demands, using the leverage of Israel's military might to
produce a diplomatic triumph for the president.

[With every passing day of Israeli battlefield success]{.underline},
however, [**Trump** has **warmed** to a **military solution**, declaring
himself on Tuesday to be "**not too much in the mood to**

DUBAI, June 16 (Reuters) - [Iran has told mediators]{.underline} Qatar
and Oman that [it is not **open to negotiating a ceasefire** while it is
under Israeli attack]{.underline}, an official briefed on the
communications told Reuters on Sunday, as the two foes launched fresh
attacks and raised fears of a wider conflict.

\"The Iranians informed Qatari and Omani mediators that they will only
pursue serious negotiations once Iran has completed its response to the
Israeli pre-emptive strikes,\" said the official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the conflict.

[Iran made \"clear that it **will not negotiate** while under
attack]{.underline},\" the official said.

Israel launched a surprise attack on Iran on Friday morning that wiped
out the top echelon of Iran\'s military command and damaged its nuclear
sites, and says the campaign will continue to escalate in coming days.

[Iran has vowed to \"**open the gates of hell**]{.underline}\" in
retaliation in what has emerged as the biggest ever confrontation
between the longstanding enemies.

The official told Reuters media [**reports that Iran
appealed**]{.underline} to Oman and Qatar to engage [the U.S. to
**broker a ceasefire** and **renew nuclear talk**s were
**inaccurate**.]{.underline}

Iran\'s foreign ministry did not respond to Reuters request for comment,
nor did Qatar\'s foreign ministry or Oman\'s ministry of information.

Oman has in recent months [mediated nuclear talks between the United
States and Iran,]{.underline} though the most recent round was
**[canceled]{.underline}** a day after Israel launched a sweeping air

Prime Minister Benjamin [Netanyahu]{.underline} has [made it clear that
Israel **will not wait for a US** green light to **continue its military
campaign** against Iran and is fully committed to hitting all Iranian
nuclear sites]{.underline} --- including the heavily fortified Fordo
facility. \"

We will achieve all our objectives and hit all of their nuclear
facilities. We have the capability to do that,\" Netanyahu declared in a
rare Hebrew-language interview with the Kan public broadcaster,
[underscoring Israel's determination to act **decisively** and
**independently**]{.underline}.

The comment [came hours after US President Donald Trump said he will
**decide whether to join** Israel\'s strikes on Iran within the next two
weeks as there is **still a \"substantial\" chance of talks to end the
conflict**]{.underline}. \"[Based on the fact that there\'s a
**substantial chance of negotiations**]{.underline} that may or may not
take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether
or not to go within the next two weeks,\" [Trump had said]{.underline}
in a statement.

[Netanyahu emphasised that Israel is proceeding with its campaign
**regardless of whether the United States decides to join the
offensive**]{.underline}. "Whether US President Donald Trump wants to
join or not --- that's entirely his decision," he said.

"He'll do what's good for the United States, and I'll do what's good for
the State of Israel." The [prime minister stressed that Israel is **not
asking for permissio**n or a "**green light**" from any foreign
power.]{.underline}

["**Either way, we're going to do this**]{.underline}, because we have
no choice. We will not allow 3,500 years of Jewish history to come to an
end because of this deranged ayatollah," Netanyahu declared, referencing
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The [Israeli operation]{.underline}, codenamed "Rising Lion," comes
[fewer than **48 hours** before Iranian and US negotiators]{.underline}
led by special envoy Steve Witkoff [were set to meet for a **sixth round
of nuclear talks**]{.underline}. Moreover, Jerusalem's action [follows
repeated statements from Trump]{.underline}, both public and
(reportedly) in private conversations with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, [in which the President warned against an Israeli
intervention that might "**blow up" his deal.**]{.underline}

Now, with America's chief regional ally and client **[deliberately
undermining US-led diplomacy]{.underline}** and [all but coercing
Washington into war]{.underline}, American policy in the Middle East is
in a fragile state. For Trump, who a decade ago took control of the GOP
by opposing America's "forever wars" in the Middle East, all this must
be exasperating.

It's notable that the Israeli attack comes on the heels of Netanyahu
narrowly surviving a vote to dissolve the Israeli parliament, the
Knesset. Netanyahu's efforts to include ultra-Orthodox Israelis in the
military draft had alienated the conservative religious wing of his
governing coalition, forcing the prime minister to scramble to find a
compromise before Thursday morning's vote. While the agreement is
unlikely to solve Netanyahu's political problems, it did buy him time
--- and fewer than 24 hours later, he launched an aggressive war on
Iran.

The stated purpose behind Israel's Friday morning attack is to destroy
the Iranian nuclear program, with Israel Defense Forces Brig. Gen. Effie
Defrin claiming that "we have no choice" and that Iran's achieving
nuclear capabilities is a danger "to the entire world." But that clearly
hasn't been Washington's view of the matter, since [successive US
administrations of both parties have sought to resolve the dispute
diplomatically.]{.underline}

Following the International Atomic Energy Agency's vote to censure Iran
for failing to comply with nonproliferation standards[, Trump restated
his commitment to a diplomatic solution]{.underline}: "Look, it's very
simple, not complicated," the president said. "Iran cannot have a
nuclear weapon. Other than that, I want them to be successful. I want
them to be tremendous. We'll help them be successful. We'll trade with
them. We'll do whatever is necessary." [**Mere hours before the
attack**, **Trump stated**: "I want to have an agreement with Iran.
We're **fairly close to an agreement**."]{.underline}

[Israel's **unilateral** and aggressive actions]{.underline} have not
only **[undermined American diplomacy]{.underline}**, but have now
directly put American lives at risk. There are approximately 40,000 US
personnel based in the Persian Gulf region. Iran will retaliate against
the Jewish state --- that is not in question. The danger is that when
the Iranians do retaliate, they will probably, inadvertently or not, hit
American troops or other direct US interests, which would trigger a
response from Washington.

Secretary of State and acting National Security Adviser Marco Rubio
seems savvy to this danger, stating clearly that the United States is
"not involved in strikes against Iran, and our top priority is
protecting American forces in the region." Rubio warned: "Iran should
not target US interests or personnel." Likewise, Trump noted before the
attack was launched that the State Department had begun evacuations of
its staff from Baghdad, while the US military was evacuating
nonessential personnel from bases in the Middle East.

While American leaders seem to understand how this conflict could harm
American lives and interests in the region, they haven't yet commented
on how such harm appears to be what Netanyahu is counting on. It is a
brazen move of a kind that GOP realists of an earlier age --- the likes
of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and advisers like James
Baker and Brent Scowcroft --- would never tolerate. [An **alliance
partner** of **the United States** has **launched a unilateral attack**
on another state, apparently with the aim of **scuttling diplomatic
negotiations.**]{.underline}

Not only has [**Israel** **sabotaged** US efforts at
diplomacy]{.underline}, but these actions are endangering American lives
in the hopes that the US will be forced to retaliate against Iran. That
is, [Netanyahu is hoping that an escalation will drag
America]{.underline} into the fray to force America into a regional
conflagration just when a bipartisan consensus has emerged in favor of
redeployment away from the Middle East toward more strategically
pertinent areas like the Pacific.

In response, American leaders need to take control of the situation as
quickly as possible, and to do so they must condemn Israel's aggression,
thus putting distance between Washington and what took place on Friday.

Allowing Israel to continue down this path without clear rebuke not only
risks another forever war in the Middle East with an unthinkable cost in
human life. It [will]{.underline}, additionally, [turn **America into a
laughing stock** on the international stage]{.underline}. While some
internet commentators have hypothesized that the United States covertly
supports this attack, that would be an terrible strategic
miscalculation: either [Netanyahu]{.underline} has [made America
look]{.underline} [the fool]{.underline} and is [trying to **strong-arm
Trump** into supporting a war]{.underline} that is against America's
interests, or Trump has supported Netanyahu's actions for the same
reputational cost.

Without condemning Israel's actions, [Trump is sending a clear message:
he doesn't make American policy, **Benjamin Netanyahu
does.**]{.underline}

[Iran]{.underline}'s Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi has said Tehran
[will **not enter into nuclear negotiatio**ns with the United States
until Israel halts its ongoing military assault.]{.underline}

"Americans want to negotiate and have sent messages several times, but
we clearly said that as long as this aggression doesn't stop, **[there's
no place for talk of dialogue]{.underline}**," Araqchi said during a
televised address.

He also said the U.S. was complicit, calling Washington "a partner to
Israeli crime against Iran."

US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has said he will decide "within
the next two weeks" whether the U.S. will join Israel's military
campaign against Iran.

"Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations
that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make
my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks," Trump said.

Missiles, strikes, and an escalating conflict

As the standoff enters its second week, Israel said it had struck dozens
of military targets across Iran overnight, including missile factories,
air defence systems, and a research facility linked to nuclear weapons
development.

The Israeli army also confirmed hitting surface-to-air missile batteries
in the southwest. Iranian state media reported that a five-storey
building housing a bakery and a hairdresser\'s in Tehran was among the
structures damaged, with five people injured.

On the other side, Iran launched long-range missiles towards Beersheba
and other areas in southern Israel early Friday. Israeli authorities
confirmed impacts in Tel Aviv, the Negev and Haifa. At least 20 missiles
were fired in the latest round, and emergency services said two people
were injured.

According to Iranian sources, 240 people have been killed so far in
Israeli strikes. Israel, meanwhile, has recorded 24 civilian deaths from
Iranian missile and drone attacks.

**[Nuclear diplomacy faces collapse]{.underline}**

Despite Tehran's firm stance, Araqchi travelled to Geneva for talks with
European foreign ministers, including officials from the UK, France,
Germany and the EU's foreign policy chief. The aim was to ease tensions
and encourage Iran back to the negotiating table.

European diplomats involved in the effort told Reuters the
[U.S.]{.underline} remains open to direct [negotiations]{.underline}.
But [hopes for a breakthrough **remain low.**]{.underline}

A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran may discuss limitations
on uranium enrichment. However, [Tehran would not accept a complete ban,
"especially now under Israel's strikes".]{.underline}

### 2AC---Trump Ruins Diplomacy

#### U.S. diplomacy failure in Ukraine [dooms]{.underline} Middle East mediation.

with Russia Cast a Pall over His Middle East Efforts." Middle East
Institute.

mgm\]

US President Donald Trump was back in his comfort zone this week,
fulminating online and ranting to journalists about Russia's continued
war against Ukraine. As a candidate, **[Trump]{.underline}** infamously
[promised that he could end the war in Ukraine in "**24
hours**]{.underline}," and the early weeks of his foreign policy
prioritized following through on that promise --- [efforts that have
**fallen short**]{.underline} as the conflict rages on.

This efficacy crisis in American foreign policy is not new --- all
recent US presidents have, to some extent, not lived up to their stated
global ambitions. But [**repeated failures** on **multiple fronts** can
have **negative externalities** in other areas]{.underline}. As Russia's
President Vladimir Putin continues to thumb his nose at Trump,
[**America's adversaries** and competitors across the world will **watch
closely** to see what the US president does next.]{.underline}

Since the Middle East is a key arena for global competition and two
major strategic challenges --- [Iran and]{.underline} the
[Israel]{.underline}-Palestine question --- still [**loom large,
Trump's** **shortcomings** on **other foreign policy issues** could
**affect** how seriously America's friends and foes alike take **his
efforts in the region.**]{.underline}

[No **major US foreign policy gain**s as yet in Trump 2.0]{.underline}

Trump's frustrations about his inability to produce a cease-fire and
bring the Russian leader to heel have been spilling out in public in
recent weeks. He told reporters last weekend, "I don't know what the
hell happened to Putin," and later posted online that the Russian
president had "gone absolutely crazy." When all else fails, Trump turns
to his use of "troll power" against Russia in provocative statements to
the media and in online posts. Troll power, a form of negative soft
power, uses the scathing mockery and grandstanding rhetorical
gamesmanship common in online feuds in interactions between states and
world leaders --- and Trump is a master at this.

But the main problem with [Trump's troll power]{.underline} is that
though it serves to distract the public and seize the media spotlight,
it often [**fails** to **produce tangible gains** or clear results in
the real world]{.underline}. His provocative statements [do nothing to
address the underlying issues of wars or disputes]{.underline} that
continue to drag on unresolved, as we are seeing in Ukraine but also in
the trade wars Trump has initiated. Trump has blinked on the trade
front, pressing the pause button for the moment on tariffs against the
two other main engines of the global economy, China and Europe, even as
the specter of price increases continues to hang over America.

Trump's domestic political standing improved in May after dipping
sharply in April, likely the result of the time out he announced in the
trade wars and favorable coverage of his Middle East trip. One key
factor that helps define Trump's base is that many of his strongest
supporters do not follow news stories or the details too closely,
according to recent research. Over time, however, those details will
begin to promulgate more broadly in the public consciousness, and
Trump's political standing will be shaped by whether his approach
produces results. The next major event to watch is the fate of the tax
and budget bill he is currently attempting to push through Congress.

Trump's foreign policy approach, at times harkening back to the age of
"spheres of influence" wielded by major powers in the 19th century, is
hampered by an erratic approach to statecraft, something veteran US
diplomat Dennis Ross discussed earlier this month on my podcast, Taking
the Edge Off the Middle East. Trump's recent cuts to the National
Security Council staff, the main body that coordinates interagency
policy, could further impact how effectively and efficiently his
administration manages foreign policy in his second term.

Iran and Israel-Palestine: The two major unresolved variables in the
Middle East equation

The [lack **of significant outcomes** on the **Russia diplomacy** front
**sends signal**s **across the world**, including the **Middle East,
about** just how **effective Trump 2.0** is in achieving its stated
goals]{.underline}. [Trump's first three months in office produced a
**mixed record on** the Middle East]{.underline}; and though his May
visit to the region was replete with business and commercial
announcements, there were **[no major advances]{.underline}** for
regional stability. In the complex math of today's Middle East, the two
major variables that remain unresolved are Iran and the Israel-Palestine
front, yet it remains to be seen what course the administration will
take on both issues.

On Iran, talks continue over a possible deal. The head of the United
Nations nuclear agency said this week that "the jury is still out" on
those talks, noting that the fact they continue is a good sign. Trump
currently appears to prefer some sort of a deal over military action,
and he reportedly warned Israel not to take steps that could upset a
possible agreement. These discussions do not appear to include
long-standing concerns about Iran's destabilizing actions in the region,
as Israel continues to face threats from Iranian partners like the
Houthis in Yemen --- even after Trump struck a separate deal this spring
with the militant group to get them to stop attacking US targets.

The Israel-Palestine file is the weakest link in Trump 2.0's overall
Middle East approach. Trump came into office with a cease-fire between
Israel and Hamas in place, but that collapsed more than two months ago.
Israel announced its intention to seize control of 75% of Gaza in a
two-month military operation that began in mid-March, and has reportedly
taken out another top Hamas leader. But the human costs and humanitarian
impact of these operations continue to escalate, as flawed efforts to
get more food and supplies to Palestinians in Gaza fail to meet the
needs that have only grown after months of a complete Israeli blockade
of all assistance. Talks over a new cease-fire and hostage-release deal
continue; however, it is not yet clear whether Trump's team can produce
a lasting outcome that ends the fighting and brings the remaining
hostages home.

It is still early days for the second Trump administration, but [the
**lack of clear, positive results** from the president's efforts to end
Russia's war against Ukraine **does not bode well** for his
**ambitions** to **resolve** conflicts in the Middle East]{.underline}
in a way that makes America and its partners more secure and prosperous.

#### Trump's [tanked]{.underline} diplomatic capital---zero credibility now.

**Weinstein '6/11** \[Adam; June 11, 2025. Deputy Director of the Middle
East program at the Quincy Institute. "Trump Is Blowing Up Soft Power."
*The Nation*.
https://www.thenation.com/article/world/trump-diplomacy-power-aid-development;
mgm\]

As the [Trump]{.underline} administration tightens its grip on
government, it is [branding diplomacy as personal theater]{.underline}
and [sidelining]{.underline} the [institutions]{.underline} that once
sustained it---[**trading soft power** and **lasting influence** for
fleeting spectacle]{.underline}. What's being lost isn't just influence
but also understanding.

For this reason, "soft power," a term coined by the late Harvard
political scientist Joseph Nye to describe influence through attraction
rather than coercion, may be better understood today as "soft
diplomacy": Washington's ability to understand other societies---and for
those societies to understand America.

Understanding, on its own, doesn't guarantee sound foreign
policy---especially when it's routinely used to justify a reflexive
commitment to American primacy, military intervention, or zero-sum
competition. But **[dismantling]{.underline}** [**global engagement**,
educational exchange, and **soft diplomacy**]{.underline} all but
**[ensures worse]{.underline} [outcomes]{.underline}**---and makes it
harder to carry out good policies when they do emerge. By [tying
diplomacy to the president's personal brand]{.underline}---as if it
belongs to one person or administration---[the **US erodes** its
**long-term credibility** and **undermines** the very **diplomats**
charged with carrying it out.]{.underline}

[**Burning Down** the **Architecture of**]{.underline} Public
**[Diplomacy]{.underline}**

Washington's hard power---an enormous military budget and the global
financial machinery to impose often-ineffective but punishing
sanctions---comes with privileges and pathologies. Americans move
through the world with ease. We swipe our credit cards without issue,
rarely need visas, and treat US territorial integrity as a given. With
the expansion of militarism during the Global War on Terror era also
came the erosion of civil liberties, bloated defense spending, and new
federal law enforcement agencies like ICE.

What's less discussed are the quiet benefits of our soft diplomacy.
Global elites and ambitious students still flock to US universities. US
ambassadors often lack fluency in the local language---something
unimaginable for their foreign counterparts in Washington. English,
which became a global lingua franca thanks to the British Empire, owes
much of its continued dominance to the cultural and economic influence
of the United States and decades of educational and professional
exchange. Even when political anti-Americanism flares, it rarely
manifests as a wholesale rejection of American culture or people.

Overall, polling shows that while America is viewed positively, it is
met with skepticism, especially when promoting its foreign policy as a
force for good. The wistfulness that once greeted American travelers
abroad---a mix of curiosity, aspiration, and the quiet hope of getting a
US visa---has faded over the past two decades. The Bush administration's
unpopular invasion of Iraq, Washington's unflinching support for
Israel---including using it as a pretext to deport foreign students and
even green-card holders---harsh and complicated immigration rules, and
improving conditions in parts of the Global South have all given people
plenty of reasons to look elsewhere.

But this moment feels more extreme. The [erosion of]{.underline} soft
power or [diplomacy is no longer passive or incidental---it's
**deliberate**]{.underline}. Washington isn't just retreating from
global engagement. [It's **burning the boats** that once kept it
tethered to the world.]{.underline}

First, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [targeted
USAID.]{.underline} While the agency still exists on paper, it's been
effectively dismantled. A January 20 executive order froze nearly all
foreign aid and later a directive placed most USAID staff worldwide on
paid leave. By early 2025, over 80 percent of USAID's
portfolio---roughly 5,000 contracts and grants---had been canceled.

Secretary of State Marco [Rubio]{.underline} has publicly [blasted the
State Department as "bloated"]{.underline} and overly bureaucratic,
announcing plans to [eliminate **over 100 bureaus**]{.underline} and
**[cut]{.underline}** roughly [**15 percent** of Foreign Service
staff.]{.underline} At the same time, the administration launched a
controversial "deferred resignation " program aimed at [downsizing the
federal workforce]{.underline}. In January 2025, a "Fork in the Road"
e-mail offered federal employees full pay and benefits through September
if they agreed to resign. Around 75,000 federal employees across
agencies took the deal. A second buyout round began in April, according
to an internal memo.

Other government [agencies]{.underline} have also been
**[gutted]{.underline}**. A March 2025 order disbanded the Pentagon's
Office of Net Assessment, and in April, the [Woodrow Wilson
Center]{.underline} was effectively **[shut down]{.underline}**---nearly
all employees were put on leave, locked out of e-mail, and told they'd
be fired as part of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency
(DOGE) task force. Similarly, the [US Institute of Peac]{.underline}e
(USIP) was ordered **[dismantled]{.underline}** in March. DOGE forcibly
entered its headquarters and removed board members. Court orders have
restored some of USIP's functions but the damage is effectively done.

#### The State Department's [gutted]{.underline} and diplomacy's [shot]{.underline}.

mgm\]

So [how is the State Department faring in Trump's second term? The
answer is **much, much worse**]{.underline}. The hallmark features of
2017 are all present: the preference for loyalty over expertise,
ideological alignment above experience and the [consistent undermining
of]{.underline} "deep state" [bureaucracy]{.underline}. But [the scale
is **much greater**]{.underline}**.** In all, during Trump's first term
the [State Department lost about 10% of its staff]{.underline} through
successive budget cuts. [If Congress approves the proposed changes, the
**disruption will be even more dramatic**]{.underline}. The USAID freeze
and subsequent absorption has taken most attention so far, but the
[State Department itself is facing **radical change**]{.underline}**.**

In February Trump issued an Executive Order to revamp the foreign
service, explicitly directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to "ensure
faithful and effective implementation of the President's foreign policy
agenda" making clear that failure to implement is grounds for
professional discipline with the potential for termination.

In April, more details of the State Department's "revamp" emerged with
Rubio announcing a plan to reorganise the foreign service outlining [the
**closure of 132 bureaus** and offices and **total staff reduction of
15%**]{.underline}**.** A deadline of 1 July was set for those leading
the reorganisation.

Then, in May, Rubio submitted a notification to Congress [proposing to
**cut thousands** of **jobs** and merge or **close** more than **300
bureaus and offices**]{.underline}. The notification offers more details
of the administration's proposed overhaul, setting out plans to reduce
bureaucratic overlap, dissolve functions ideologically inconsistent with
the administration, and embolden the Department's regional offices by
placing remaining foreign assistance under their management.

A few weeks out from the 1 July deadline, the revamp plans are underway,
with Congress working on a new bill to reauthorise and reorganise the
State Department. If passed, it will be the first reauthorisation of the
State Department in more than 20 years.

In terms of the [State Department's funding]{.underline}, the 2026
budget request would see international affairs [**drop to its lowest
level** since before the Second World War, with a m**assive 85%
decrease**]{.underline} (USD\$51.7 billion). The vast majority of cuts
are to foreign aid -- including global health, democracy and
humanitarian assistance -- and to contributions to multilateral
organisations (UN funding is slashed by 83%). These will be replaced by
initiatives such as a new "America First Opportunity Fund" to focus on
investments that include repatriations and removals of refugees and
migrants, "countering China and other near-peer rivals" and advancing US
economic interests.

The budget request also includes a [9% decrease to the State Department
account responsible for **funding US diplomatic personnel
globally**]{.underline}. Although it does not provide further detail on
the reduced presence of US foreign service globally, [internal plans
reveal the **closure** of]{.underline} nearly [**30 US embassies** and
consulates globally]{.underline} -- mostly in Africa and Europe -- and
the consolidation of missions from Canada to Japan.

This might make sense if the world had become more peaceful or secure.
In fact, the United States is facing greater geopolitical uncertainty,
with the relative decline of its influence and military heft in an era
of great power competition. The issue is the [Trump administration's
**devaluing of diplomacy**]{.underline}.

**[Effective diplomacy]{.underline}** means being comfortable with
incrementalism, compromises and partial solutions. It takes
[**specialist skills** and requires a commitment to the
long-term]{.underline}. It does not suit Trump's modus operandi of
transactionalism, business-like deals and quick fix solutions.

While [what's happening at State has been overshadowed by the whirlwind
of **Trumplomacy**]{.underline}, in the long term it may be that the
administration's efforts to [**undermine**, **defund** and
**re-organise** the US foreign service]{.underline} have the most
lasting impact. By devaluing the profession essential to state-to-state
relations, the United States is [**removing** one of its key
**instruments of statecraft** -- with long**-term effects for its
international engagement**.]{.underline}

At the same time, warming temperatures in the [Arctic]{.underline} are
[opening sea routes and allowing **new access** to natural resources,
**prompting increased** traffic and **cooperation** between Arctic and
non-Arctic states]{.underline}. Climate change is destabilizing the
health, food security, and livelihoods of people in the area. We argue
that, [in **mutually dependent regions** like the Arctic,]{.underline}
scientific [research]{.underline} on climate and health can **[sustain
channels for diplomacy]{.underline}**. Indeed, [**new**---**even
experimental**---**strategies for cooperation**]{.underline} are
necessary at this critical time.

Cooperation and competition in the Arctic

[The Arctic Council]{.underline} was established in 1996 as a high-level
intergovernmental forum for the eight countries with Arctic territory
and the six Indigenous people's organizations granted "permanent
participant" status. The council [promotes **cooperation**,
**coordination**, and **communication**]{.underline} among Arctic
states, Indigenous communities, and the rest of the Arctic population on
issues including sustainable development, health threats, and emergency
response. The chair of the council rotates among the Arctic state
members, with initiatives carried out by working groups, task forces,
and expert groups.

The Arctic Council has successfully navigated diplomatic disagreements
among member states, including the Iraq War in 2003, the Russo-Georgian
War in 2008, and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. On March 3,
2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the other seven
member states announced a pause in their participation. The pause
disrupted the council's 130 projects related to environmental
monitoring, data collection, equity, and search and rescue. It also put
the brakes on critical work and communication related to Indigenous
peoples, the environment, scientific research, and health safety.

How can collaboration with Russia happen when established diplomatic
channels are diminished?

Following discussions, in June 2022 those seven member states of the
council agreed to resume partial activity on existing projects not
involving the Russian Federation. In August 2023, all the Arctic Council
countries, including Russia, agreed to guidelines for resuming working
group and expert group activities. Further discussions with the six
permanent participant Indigenous peoples' organizations in October 2023
encouraged resumption of working group--level activities with Russia.
Then, in February 2024, Russia withheld its annual payment to the Arctic
Council. This step raises urgent questions about the council's future
without Russian participation. How can collaboration with Russia happen
when established diplomatic channels are diminished?

Understanding Russia's aspirations in the Arctic

A key to navigating future collaboration on emerging diseases and other
health risks in the Arctic is a deeper understanding of the future
Russia sees for itself as a leading power in the region. Russia controls
about 45% of the geographic territory of the Arctic, including the
Northern Sea Route---which is in Russia's exclusive economic zone---a
particularly useful seaway for moving cargo between the North Pacific
region and Northern Europe. Russia's position in the Arctic and its role
in current geopolitical crises contribute to broader debates on the
effectiveness of "soft law" (such as recommendations and codes of
conduct) and diplomacy in various areas of international scientific
cooperation, particularly for health and climate issues.

Already, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine
have shifted Russian foreign policy approaches to health and science
deeper into the security realm. The invasion prompted many Western
countries to impose a range of scientific sanctions on Russia, and
though individual researchers are not banned from cross-border
collaboration, travel between Russia and the West is more complicated.
The number of research collaborations between Russian scientists and
those from the United States and European countries has fallen, as has
the attendance of Russian researchers at international academic
conferences.

A year into the war with Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir Putin
presented a new Foreign Policy Concept (FPC), an outline of Russia's
national interests, strategic goals, challenges, and main directions of
foreign policy, which had last been updated in 2016. The new FPC
emphasizes Arctic policy in commitments to "counteracting the unfriendly
states' policy aimed at militarization of the region" and "establishing
a mutually beneficial cooperation with the non-Arctic states pursuing a
constructive policy toward Russia." These statements signal Russia's
strategic interest in maintaining a formal presence on the Arctic
Council to preserve its political power in the Arctic while testing new
bilateral partnerships in the region.

Russia's current inclination toward bilateral rather than multilateral
cooperation, coupled with China's ambitions for the region, could set
back the Arctic Council's work to build up necessary health security and
cooperation networks.

Global health priorities in the FPC suggest Russia's continuing interest
in international discussions, but with variations in focus across
regions. The document links global health to environmental protection
and climate change, and goals include "increasing efficiency of
international cooperation in the area of health care and preventing its
politicization," as well as "consolidating international efforts in
order to prevent the extension of dangerous infectious diseases" and
quickly responding to crises, epidemics, and pandemics. Russia remains a
member of the World Health Organization (WHO) and is active in
convenings related to WHO's International Health Regulations and the
pandemic accord led by its Intergovernmental Negotiating Body.

It is significant, however, that neither of the FPC's agendas for health
or the Arctic refers to the existing international platforms---WHO and
the Arctic Council---for maintaining multilateral cooperation.

The lack of mention of multilateral platforms is notable alongside a
joint Russian-Chinese political statement in March 2023---timed closely
with the presentation of the Russian FPC---declaring the two countries'
intentions to act "in favor of preserving the Arctic as a territory of
peace, stability, and constructive cooperation." Though China has no
territorial claim in the Arctic, its plans for a Polar Silk Road via
Arctic waters to Europe, which is included in its Belt and Road
Initiative, indicate a vision for leadership in the region. Official
dialogue on the Arctic between Moscow and Beijing began in 2013. The
cooperation has produced two large Arctic energy infrastructure projects
and a memorandum of understanding between the two countries on maritime
law enforcement in the Arctic zone.

Russia's current inclination toward bilateral rather than multilateral
cooperation, coupled with China's ambitions for the region, could set
back the Arctic Council's work to build up necessary health security and
cooperation networks among all Arctic states and peoples. We think the
situation calls for consideration of new mechanisms for dialogue around
emerging climate and health threats in the region.

The entangled future of the Arctic, global health, and science diplomacy

As geopolitical and military instability abuts nonmilitary humanitarian
pursuits, Arctic states may be forced to allocate resources to
protecting individual interests over supporting scientific cooperation.
However, in other periods of tension, science diplomacy has been key to
preserving cooperation between allies and rivals, as with the Pugwash
Conferences on Science and World Affairs, the Edinburgh Conversations,
Cold War--era polio vaccine cooperation, and the international effort to
sequence SARS-CoV-2.

With the Arctic region in a precarious position, now may be the time to
move beyond traditional forms of diplomacy and center the pursuit of
alternative means of scientific cooperation around health and climate
security as a unifying purpose for continued engagement.

An important component of any effective international science
collaboration is the personal relationships cultivated between
scientists from around the world, often nurtured over decades. To
preserve those relationships under an Arctic Council with diminished
capacity, we recommend Western policymakers and other stakeholders
engage in bilateral initiatives extending beyond the Arctic Council
framework.

[Nongovernmental, informal interactions]{.underline} (known as Track II
diplomacy) [among scientists from Arctic]{.underline} (and even
non-Arctic) states could be a powerful strategy for keeping Russia
engaged and communicating with the global scientific community. The
first mechanism to try is for researchers in neighboring states or
territories (for example, Alaska, the Russian district of Chukotka, and
Yukon, a Canadian territory) to arrange for partnerships in climate
research. Strategically expanding approaches to scientific cooperation
in the polar regions, particularly through individual contacts, could
[**solidify** the Arctic's significance as a **focal point** for
**twenty-first-century science diplomacy**]{.underline}.

**[Investment in diplomatic capital]{.underline}** (i.e., in
institutions and norms designed to foster cross-cultural collaborations)
can [**strengthen** the **capabilities** of the **global community** to
**act together** for the **common good.**]{.underline}

[Institutions and norms of state diplomacy]{.underline} have been
**[developed]{.underline}** over centuries to support co-operation
between countries (Anderson 1993). This is an [example of]{.underline}
**[investment in diplomatic capital]{.underline}**, but all
international organisations must similarly develop norms and protocols
to be effective. The seven fundamental principles accepted by members of
the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, discussed earlier
in this chapter, is an obvious example. Similarly, the difficulties and
rewards of drawing on cultural differences business enterprises is well
recognised (Shenkar 2001). In short, any initiative that brings together
diverse actors to address a global issue requires diplomatic capital to
succeed.

Conclusion

Persons engage with global issues through specialist institutions that
aim to foster collaboration on the world stage. These institutions
include INGOs , MNCs and IGOs . Some institutions have undertaken
activities that damage wellbeing, particularly in developing countries.
Nevertheless, it is clear that some issues affecting the common good of
the global community cannot be solved without coordinated efforts from
diverse countries, large corporations and representatives of civil
society.

The capability to foster global collaboration must not be taken for
granted. In the language of this chapter, it requires [conscious
investment in diplomatic capital]{.underline}, defined as institutions
and norms designed to **[foster cross-cultural
collaborations]{.underline}**. This applies not only to diplomatic
relations among countries but to all initiatives that [**bring
together** **diverse actors** to address global issues]{.underline}.

## Internal Link: Israel-Iran

### 2AC---Other Countries Fill In

#### Europe [fills in]{.underline} for U.S. diplomacy failure.

**Erlanger, et al. '6/19** \[Steven Erlanger, Jim Tankersley, and Jeanna
Smialek; June 19, 2025. Correspondents for the NYTimes. "Europe to Hold
Talks with Iran on Friday." *The New York Times*,
https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/19/world/europe/europe-iran-israel-war-talks-nuclear.html;
mgm\]

As President Trump decides whether to go to war in Iran, key [**European
countries** are **pursuing a diplomatic** **path**]{.underline}, [hoping
to find a **negotiated solution** and **de-escalate** the conflict
between Israel and Iran]{.underline} before it engulfs the region.

[After several days of **back-channel discussions**]{.underline},
[foreign ministers from **Britain**, **France** and **Germany**,
together with Kaja Kallas, the European Union foreign policy chief, are
scheduled to hold talks on Friday with their Iranian
counterpart]{.underline}, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.

If the meeting, scheduled for Geneva, takes place, it would be the most
**[significant European involvement]{.underline}** since Israel launched
its surprise attacks against Iran last week. And it would be the [first
in-person discussions between Iran and the West]{.underline} since
Israel began attacking Iran's nuclear facilities and other sites.

Mr. Trump is evidently in no hurry but will wait to see how the war goes
and the talks with Iran play out. Later Thursday, the White House press
secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said that he will decide "within the next
two weeks" whether to strike Iran. Mr. Trump, his press secretary told
reporters, still sees "a substantial chance of negotiations that may or
may not take place with Iran in the near future," so in effect he is
postponing a decision he had suggested was imminent.

But it remains far from certain whether any talks can succeed at a
moment when both sides seem intent on trading blows, whether the United
States will pursue a competing diplomatic track, whether Iran is
prepared to concede on ending its enrichment of uranium or what
President Trump's intentions actually are.

The president has at times suggested that he might send Vice President
JD Vance and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, to renewed negotiations
of their own. At other times he has seemed to favor an all-out Israeli
victory aided by American, "bunker-buster" bomb strikes on the deeply
embedded Iranian facility called Fordo.

Mr. Trump has made it clear in the past that he wants a deal and would
prefer not to engage the United States in another war in the Middle
East. At the same time, he has vowed, as presidents have before him,
that Iran should never be able to build a nuclear weapon.

He has used the threat of American military force to try to drive the
Iranians to the negotiating table, where they would now arrive in an
even weaker position than before.

Mr. Araghchi has repeatedly said that Iran is open to negotiating tough
limits on its nuclear program, but not to giving up uranium enrichment
for civilian purposes. For now Israel seems intent on pursuing its
military campaign to deny Iran any nuclear program, and perhaps even to
topple the Islamic government.

Until now, the [Europeans]{.underline}, who were instrumental in the
2015 nuclear deal with Iran that Mr. Trump abandoned in 2018, have been
effectively sidelined --- first by the bilateral U.S.-Iran talks, and
then by the war.

But they, too, are [committed to ensuring that Iran does not have
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, and they are [trying]{.underline} now [to
exert]{.underline} the limited [**leverage** they have to end the war
and to ensure a nonnuclear Iran.]{.underline}

Ms. Kallas and the [Europeans had **a phone conversation** with Mr.
Araghchi]{.underline} on Monday, she said, to "see what more can we do
to [really **sit down** and de-escalate."]{.underline}

On Wednesday, [they issued a joint statement calling for **restraint**
and de**-escalation** between Iran and Israel]{.underline}. On Friday,
[they are set to urge the **Iranians to return to
negotiations**,]{.underline} even as President Trump holds the
possibility of American military involvement over their heads.

Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot of [France said]{.underline} on
Thursday at a Paris news conference that [Iran's message]{.underline}
was "relatively clear: [There is a **willingness to resume
talks**]{.underline}, including with the United States, provided that a
cease-fire can be reached."

He continued, "On [our side, there is a **willingness to resume
negotiations**]{.underline}, provided that these negotiations can lead
to lasting, substantial steps backward by Iran regarding its nuclear
program, its ballistic program and its activities to destabilize the
region."

European views are unlikely to be an important factor in Mr. Trump's
decision on whether to attack Iran. He already tried to bypass Europe
and negotiate a nuclear deal on his own, though unsuccessfully.

Still, if American troops are hit by Iran, Washington will expect
European support. If a negotiated deal is ever completed, the Europeans
will be important, both at the United Nations and the International
Atomic Energy Agency, the watchdog for the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty, in helping to enforce it.

"[The European Union can play and will play its part in **reaching a
diplomatic solution**]{.underline}," Ms. Kallas said this week, adding
that she would "[**spare no efforts** in this respect."]{.underline}

#### Gulf states [fills in]{.underline} for U.S. diplomacy failure.

mgm\]

[Arab Gulf states]{.underline} have [engaged on **multiple diplomatic**
**fronts** to **end the Israel-Iran** war and return to **regional
stability** as tensions rise]{.underline}.

Unanimous Gulf condemnation of Israel's attack on Iran has presaged a
battle for self-preservation. The war could destroy decades of economic
advancement achieved by the Gulf countries and destabilise the region.

[Having **cultivated relations with Iran for years**, the six **Gulf
Co-operation Council** states]{.underline} -- [the United Arab Emirates,
Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait]{.underline} -- [are
campaigning for an **end to hostilities**]{.underline}. They fear US
intervention on Israel's side could prompt Iran to retaliate by striking
US military bases in the Gulf, dangerously widening the conflict.

An Emirati analyst who has close ties to his government said the Gulf
leaders "may not support US intervention \[by\] allowing airspace access
or the use of bases, but they can't prevent it". Iran could retaliate by
closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20 per cent of the world's
oil flows, while Israel could bomb Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant,
located on the Gulf coast, which would release land, sea and air
pollution.

Due to its ties to both Iran and Israel, the [Emirates has **taken the
lead**]{.underline}. President Mohammed bin Zayed told his Iranian
counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian that the [Emirates has been engaged in
"**intensive consultations** with all **concerned parties**" to
de-escalate the crisis]{.underline}. Bin Zayed has also contacted
Russian president Vladimir Putin, who in turn has [spoken to
**Pezeshkian**, Israeli prime minister Binyamin **Netanyahu** and US
president Donald Trump with the same objective.]{.underline}

[Oman]{.underline} has been incensed over Israel's attack, which
disrupted talks the sultanate had mediated between the US and Iran on
limiting Tehran's nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of
sanctions. The cancelled sixth round of talks was to take place last
Sunday, 48 hours after Israel began bombing Iran. [Tehran has said Iran
will resume the talks once there is a ceasefire.]{.underline}

[Having **restored diplomatic** ties with Iran in 2023]{.underline}
after six years of estrangement, [Saudi Arabia has **engaged** with
Tehran and **Washington** since "**day one**]{.underline}**",**
according to Saudi analyst Ali Shihabi. The best outcome would be a deal
between Iran and the US, he said.

Crown prince and de facto Saudi ruler [M]{.underline}ohammed
[b]{.underline}in [S]{.underline}alman has [discussed the situation with
the Iranian and Emirati presidents]{.underline}. The prince fears war
could disrupt his 2030 plan to develop the kingdom's economy and reduce
its dependence on volatile oil revenues.

[Qatar]{.underline} -- which has [mediated between Hamas and Israel --
has been "**engaging** **daily**"]{.underline} with the
US[,]{.underline} its foreign ministry spokesman said.

#### China [fills in]{.underline} for U.S. diplomacy failure---economic ties, backchannels, and multilateral mechanisms give it credibility.

mgm\]

[**China** is expected to play an "**active" role** in trying to broker
a **ceasefire** between **Israel and Iran**]{.underline}, but analysts
warned there may be limits to what it could achieve.

The two countries traded strikes for a fifth straight day on Tuesday, as
China warned its citizens to leave both countries as "soon as possible"
because of the "severe" security situation.

President Xi [Jinping]{.underline}, speaking during a visit to
Kazakhstan for a summit with Central Asian countries, [called on all
parties]{.underline} to work [**to de-escalate** the conflict as soon as
possible, saying: "**China stands ready** to work with all parties to
play a **constructive** **role** in restoring **peace** and
**stability** in the Middle East."]{.underline}

Over the weekend, [Chinese Foreign Minister]{.underline} Wang Yi [spoke
to his **Iranian** and **Israeli counterparts**]{.underline}, Abbas
Araghchi and Gideon Saar.

He condemned Israel's attack as an "unacceptable" breach of
international law but also said [Beijing was ready to play a
"**constructive" role** in helping the two sides **resolve their
differences.**]{.underline}

The [**Beijing-backed security** group the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation -- which Tehran joined as a full membe]{.underline}r in
2023 -- has also "strongly condemned" Israel's strikes on Iran and
[called for a settlement "exclusively through **peaceful**,
**political** and **diplomatic** means".]{.underline}

On Friday, Fu Cong, China's ambassador to the United Nations, condemned
Israel's attacks and urged it to "immediately cease all military
adventurism".

"A ceasefire and an end to the fighting are the most pressing
priorities. Only **[dialogue and negotiation can bring lasting
peace]{.underline}**," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun
said on Tuesday.

Guo added that [**Beijing** was **ready to maintain** close
communication with all parties.]{.underline}

"I think [China is very willing to **actively participate** in
**conflict resolution** and **crisis management** in the Middle East
this time]{.underline}," said Sun Degang, director of the Centre for
Middle Eastern Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.

He pointed to [Wang's **phone** **conversations** with the **Israeli**
and **Iranian** **diplomats** and the SCO's statement]{.underline},
adding that [China could turn to **multilateral mechanisms**, such as
**emergency meetings** of the **UN Security Council**, to **resolve the
conflict**.]{.underline}

[China maintains close economic ties with Iran]{.underline}, which sees
Beijing as a vital international partner in the face of Western
sanctions.

[China]{.underline} is [Iran's]{.underline} **[main trading
partner]{.underline}** and export market, and the two countries
established a "[comprehensive strategic partnership]{.underline}" nearly
a decade ago. But [Beijing is also Israel's second-largest trading
partner]{.underline} and main source of imports and [established an
"innovative **comprehensive partnership**]{.underline}" eight years ago.

mgm\]

The timing alone makes that clear, Goldmann and others argue. On June
12, the International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, issued a statement
saying that Iran was not fully cooperating with it. But [**Israel has
not presented any evidence** as to why they believed a nuclear threat
from Iran was so close and US intelligence suggests Iran
was]{.underline} possibly [**three years** away from a
bomb.]{.underline}

There have been years of threatening rhetoric between Iran and Israel
but [it\'s **deemed highly unlikely** that Iran **would fire a nuclear
weapon** at Israel]{.underline} later this month.

\"[Look back at the Cold War]{.underline},\" Goldmann suggested. \"Both
sides had nuclear weapons and relied on the principle of **[mutually

India\'s most senior diplomat, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, said in a

Pakistan has thanked Washington for playing a mediating role, however,
while [India has repeatedly d**enied any third-party

### 2AC---Trump Ruins Diplomacy

#### Trump's [tanked]{.underline} diplomatic capital---zero credibility now.

**Weinstein '6/11** \[Adam; June 11, 2025. Deputy Director of the Middle
East program at the Quincy Institute. "Trump Is Blowing Up Soft Power."
*The Nation*.
https://www.thenation.com/article/world/trump-diplomacy-power-aid-development;
mgm\]

As the [Trump]{.underline} administration tightens its grip on
government, it is [branding diplomacy as personal theater]{.underline}
and [sidelining]{.underline} the [institutions]{.underline} that once
sustained it---[**trading soft power** and **lasting influence** for
fleeting spectacle]{.underline}. What's being lost isn't just influence
but also understanding.

For this reason, "soft power," a term coined by the late Harvard
political scientist Joseph Nye to describe influence through attraction
rather than coercion, may be better understood today as "soft
diplomacy": Washington's ability to understand other societies---and for
those societies to understand America.

Understanding, on its own, doesn't guarantee sound foreign
policy---especially when it's routinely used to justify a reflexive
commitment to American primacy, military intervention, or zero-sum
competition. But **[dismantling]{.underline}** [**global engagement**,
educational exchange, and **soft diplomacy**]{.underline} all but
**[ensures worse]{.underline} [outcomes]{.underline}**---and makes it
harder to carry out good policies when they do emerge. By [tying
diplomacy to the president's personal brand]{.underline}---as if it
belongs to one person or administration---[the **US erodes** its
**long-term credibility** and **undermines** the very **diplomats**
charged with carrying it out.]{.underline}

[**Burning Down** the **Architecture of**]{.underline} Public
**[Diplomacy]{.underline}**

Washington's hard power---an enormous military budget and the global
financial machinery to impose often-ineffective but punishing
sanctions---comes with privileges and pathologies. Americans move
through the world with ease. We swipe our credit cards without issue,
rarely need visas, and treat US territorial integrity as a given. With
the expansion of militarism during the Global War on Terror era also
came the erosion of civil liberties, bloated defense spending, and new
federal law enforcement agencies like ICE.

What's less discussed are the quiet benefits of our soft diplomacy.
Global elites and ambitious students still flock to US universities. US
ambassadors often lack fluency in the local language---something
unimaginable for their foreign counterparts in Washington. English,
which became a global lingua franca thanks to the British Empire, owes
much of its continued dominance to the cultural and economic influence
of the United States and decades of educational and professional
exchange. Even when political anti-Americanism flares, it rarely
manifests as a wholesale rejection of American culture or people.

Overall, polling shows that while America is viewed positively, it is
met with skepticism, especially when promoting its foreign policy as a
force for good. The wistfulness that once greeted American travelers
abroad---a mix of curiosity, aspiration, and the quiet hope of getting a
US visa---has faded over the past two decades. The Bush administration's
unpopular invasion of Iraq, Washington's unflinching support for
Israel---including using it as a pretext to deport foreign students and
even green-card holders---harsh and complicated immigration rules, and
improving conditions in parts of the Global South have all given people
plenty of reasons to look elsewhere.

But this moment feels more extreme. The [erosion of]{.underline} soft
power or [diplomacy is no longer passive or incidental---it's
**deliberate**]{.underline}. Washington isn't just retreating from
global engagement. [It's **burning the boats** that once kept it
tethered to the world.]{.underline}

First, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [targeted
USAID.]{.underline} While the agency still exists on paper, it's been
effectively dismantled. A January 20 executive order froze nearly all
foreign aid and later a directive placed most USAID staff worldwide on
paid leave. By early 2025, over 80 percent of USAID's
portfolio---roughly 5,000 contracts and grants---had been canceled.

Secretary of State Marco [Rubio]{.underline} has publicly [blasted the
State Department as "bloated"]{.underline} and overly bureaucratic,
announcing plans to [eliminate **over 100 bureaus**]{.underline} and
**[cut]{.underline}** roughly [**15 percent** of Foreign Service
staff.]{.underline} At the same time, the administration launched a
controversial "deferred resignation " program aimed at [downsizing the
federal workforce]{.underline}. In January 2025, a "Fork in the Road"
e-mail offered federal employees full pay and benefits through September
if they agreed to resign. Around 75,000 federal employees across
agencies took the deal. A second buyout round began in April, according
to an internal memo.

Other government [agencies]{.underline} have also been
**[gutted]{.underline}**. A March 2025 order disbanded the Pentagon's
Office of Net Assessment, and in April, the [Woodrow Wilson
Center]{.underline} was effectively **[shut down]{.underline}**---nearly
all employees were put on leave, locked out of e-mail, and told they'd
be fired as part of the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency
(DOGE) task force. Similarly, the [US Institute of Peac]{.underline}e
(USIP) was ordered **[dismantled]{.underline}** in March. DOGE forcibly
entered its headquarters and removed board members. Court orders have
restored some of USIP's functions but the damage is effectively done.

#### The State Department's [gutted]{.underline} and diplomacy's [shot]{.underline}.

than in His First Presidency." The Interpreter. Lowy Institute.
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/trump-s-state-department-purge-cuts-deeper-his-first-presidency;
mgm\]

So [how is the State Department faring in Trump's second term? The
answer is **much, much worse**]{.underline}. The hallmark features of
2017 are all present: the preference for loyalty over expertise,
ideological alignment above experience and the [consistent undermining
of]{.underline} "deep state" [bureaucracy]{.underline}. But [the scale
is **much greater**]{.underline}**.** In all, during Trump's first term
the [State Department lost about 10% of its staff]{.underline} through
successive budget cuts. [If Congress approves the proposed changes, the
**disruption will be even more dramatic**]{.underline}. The USAID freeze
and subsequent absorption has taken most attention so far, but the
[State Department itself is facing **radical change**]{.underline}**.**

In February Trump issued an Executive Order to revamp the foreign
service, explicitly directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to "ensure
faithful and effective implementation of the President's foreign policy
agenda" making clear that failure to implement is grounds for
professional discipline with the potential for termination.

In April, more details of the State Department's "revamp" emerged with
Rubio announcing a plan to reorganise the foreign service outlining [the
**closure of 132 bureaus** and offices and **total staff reduction of
15%**]{.underline}**.** A deadline of 1 July was set for those leading
the reorganisation.

Then, in May, Rubio submitted a notification to Congress [proposing to
**cut thousands** of **jobs** and merge or **close** more than **300
bureaus and offices**]{.underline}. The notification offers more details
of the administration's proposed overhaul, setting out plans to reduce
bureaucratic overlap, dissolve functions ideologically inconsistent with
the administration, and embolden the Department's regional offices by
placing remaining foreign assistance under their management.

A few weeks out from the 1 July deadline, the revamp plans are underway,
with Congress working on a new bill to reauthorise and reorganise the
State Department. If passed, it will be the first reauthorisation of the
State Department in more than 20 years.

In terms of the [State Department's funding]{.underline}, the 2026
budget request would see international affairs [**drop to its lowest
level** since before the Second World War, with a m**assive 85%
decrease**]{.underline} (USD\$51.7 billion). The vast majority of cuts
are to foreign aid -- including global health, democracy and
humanitarian assistance -- and to contributions to multilateral
organisations (UN funding is slashed by 83%). These will be replaced by
initiatives such as a new "America First Opportunity Fund" to focus on
investments that include repatriations and removals of refugees and
migrants, "countering China and other near-peer rivals" and advancing US
economic interests.

The budget request also includes a [9% decrease to the State Department
account responsible for **funding US diplomatic personnel
globally**]{.underline}. Although it does not provide further detail on
the reduced presence of US foreign service globally, [internal plans
reveal the **closure** of]{.underline} nearly [**30 US embassies** and
consulates globally]{.underline} -- mostly in Africa and Europe -- and
the consolidation of missions from Canada to Japan.

This might make sense if the world had become more peaceful or secure.
In fact, the United States is facing greater geopolitical uncertainty,
with the relative decline of its influence and military heft in an era
of great power competition. The issue is the [Trump administration's
**devaluing of diplomacy**]{.underline}.

**[Effective diplomacy]{.underline}** means being comfortable with
incrementalism, compromises and partial solutions. It takes
[**specialist skills** and requires a commitment to the
long-term]{.underline}. It does not suit Trump's modus operandi of
transactionalism, business-like deals and quick fix solutions.

While [what's happening at State has been overshadowed by the whirlwind
of **Trumplomacy**]{.underline}, in the long term it may be that the
administration's efforts to [**undermine**, **defund** and
**re-organise** the US foreign service]{.underline} have the most
lasting impact. By devaluing the profession essential to state-to-state
relations, the United States is [**removing** one of its key
**instruments of statecraft** -- with long**-term effects for its
international engagement**.]{.underline}

in]{.underline} the numbers of international institutions and
[arrangements]{.underline} designed to manage expanding human activity
in the region, and deepen human understanding of it.
[Despite]{.underline} serious **[tensions]{.underline}** between Russia
and other Arctic nations concerning other issues and parts of the world,
[Arctic governments have largely chosen to **compartmentalize** the

### 2AC---Link-Turn: Science Diplomacy

#### Turn: Arctic focus entails [science diplomacy]{.underline} that [enhances]{.underline} U.S. diplomacy capacities by building [new channels]{.underline}.

At the same time, warming temperatures in the [Arctic]{.underline} are
[opening sea routes and allowing **new access** to natural resources,
**prompting increased** traffic and **cooperation** between Arctic and
non-Arctic states]{.underline}. Climate change is destabilizing the
health, food security, and livelihoods of people in the area. We argue
that, [in **mutually dependent regions** like the Arctic,]{.underline}
scientific [research]{.underline} on climate and health can **[sustain
channels for diplomacy]{.underline}**. Indeed, [**new**---**even
experimental**---**strategies for cooperation**]{.underline} are
necessary at this critical time.

Cooperation and competition in the Arctic

[The Arctic Council]{.underline} was established in 1996 as a high-level
intergovernmental forum for the eight countries with Arctic territory
and the six Indigenous people's organizations granted "permanent
participant" status. The council [promotes **cooperation**,
**coordination**, and **communication**]{.underline} among Arctic
states, Indigenous communities, and the rest of the Arctic population on
issues including sustainable development, health threats, and emergency
response. The chair of the council rotates among the Arctic state
members, with initiatives carried out by working groups, task forces,
and expert groups.

The Arctic Council has successfully navigated diplomatic disagreements
among member states, including the Iraq War in 2003, the Russo-Georgian
War in 2008, and Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. On March 3,
2022, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the other seven
member states announced a pause in their participation. The pause
disrupted the council's 130 projects related to environmental
monitoring, data collection, equity, and search and rescue. It also put
the brakes on critical work and communication related to Indigenous
peoples, the environment, scientific research, and health safety.

How can collaboration with Russia happen when established diplomatic
channels are diminished?

Following discussions, in June 2022 those seven member states of the
council agreed to resume partial activity on existing projects not
involving the Russian Federation. In August 2023, all the Arctic Council
countries, including Russia, agreed to guidelines for resuming working
group and expert group activities. Further discussions with the six
permanent participant Indigenous peoples' organizations in October 2023
encouraged resumption of working group--level activities with Russia.
Then, in February 2024, Russia withheld its annual payment to the Arctic
Council. This step raises urgent questions about the council's future
without Russian participation. How can collaboration with Russia happen
when established diplomatic channels are diminished?

Understanding Russia's aspirations in the Arctic

A key to navigating future collaboration on emerging diseases and other
health risks in the Arctic is a deeper understanding of the future
Russia sees for itself as a leading power in the region. Russia controls
about 45% of the geographic territory of the Arctic, including the
Northern Sea Route---which is in Russia's exclusive economic zone---a
particularly useful seaway for moving cargo between the North Pacific
region and Northern Europe. Russia's position in the Arctic and its role
in current geopolitical crises contribute to broader debates on the
effectiveness of "soft law" (such as recommendations and codes of
conduct) and diplomacy in various areas of international scientific
cooperation, particularly for health and climate issues.

Already, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine
have shifted Russian foreign policy approaches to health and science
deeper into the security realm. The invasion prompted many Western
countries to impose a range of scientific sanctions on Russia, and
though individual researchers are not banned from cross-border
collaboration, travel between Russia and the West is more complicated.
The number of research collaborations between Russian scientists and
those from the United States and European countries has fallen, as has
the attendance of Russian researchers at international academic
conferences.

A year into the war with Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir Putin
presented a new Foreign Policy Concept (FPC), an outline of Russia's
national interests, strategic goals, challenges, and main directions of
foreign policy, which had last been updated in 2016. The new FPC
emphasizes Arctic policy in commitments to "counteracting the unfriendly
states' policy aimed at militarization of the region" and "establishing
a mutually beneficial cooperation with the non-Arctic states pursuing a
constructive policy toward Russia." These statements signal Russia's
strategic interest in maintaining a formal presence on the Arctic
Council to preserve its political power in the Arctic while testing new
bilateral partnerships in the region.

Russia's current inclination toward bilateral rather than multilateral
cooperation, coupled with China's ambitions for the region, could set
back the Arctic Council's work to build up necessary health security and
cooperation networks.

Global health priorities in the FPC suggest Russia's continuing interest
in international discussions, but with variations in focus across
regions. The document links global health to environmental protection
and climate change, and goals include "increasing efficiency of
international cooperation in the area of health care and preventing its
politicization," as well as "consolidating international efforts in
order to prevent the extension of dangerous infectious diseases" and
quickly responding to crises, epidemics, and pandemics. Russia remains a
member of the World Health Organization (WHO) and is active in
convenings related to WHO's International Health Regulations and the
pandemic accord led by its Intergovernmental Negotiating Body.

It is significant, however, that neither of the FPC's agendas for health
or the Arctic refers to the existing international platforms---WHO and
the Arctic Council---for maintaining multilateral cooperation.

The lack of mention of multilateral platforms is notable alongside a
joint Russian-Chinese political statement in March 2023---timed closely
with the presentation of the Russian FPC---declaring the two countries'
intentions to act "in favor of preserving the Arctic as a territory of
peace, stability, and constructive cooperation." Though China has no
territorial claim in the Arctic, its plans for a Polar Silk Road via
Arctic waters to Europe, which is included in its Belt and Road
Initiative, indicate a vision for leadership in the region. Official
dialogue on the Arctic between Moscow and Beijing began in 2013. The
cooperation has produced two large Arctic energy infrastructure projects
and a memorandum of understanding between the two countries on maritime
law enforcement in the Arctic zone.

Russia's current inclination toward bilateral rather than multilateral
cooperation, coupled with China's ambitions for the region, could set
back the Arctic Council's work to build up necessary health security and
cooperation networks among all Arctic states and peoples. We think the
situation calls for consideration of new mechanisms for dialogue around
emerging climate and health threats in the region.

The entangled future of the Arctic, global health, and science diplomacy

As geopolitical and military instability abuts nonmilitary humanitarian
pursuits, Arctic states may be forced to allocate resources to
protecting individual interests over supporting scientific cooperation.
However, in other periods of tension, science diplomacy has been key to
preserving cooperation between allies and rivals, as with the Pugwash
Conferences on Science and World Affairs, the Edinburgh Conversations,
Cold War--era polio vaccine cooperation, and the international effort to
sequence SARS-CoV-2.

With the Arctic region in a precarious position, now may be the time to
move beyond traditional forms of diplomacy and center the pursuit of
alternative means of scientific cooperation around health and climate
security as a unifying purpose for continued engagement.

An important component of any effective international science
collaboration is the personal relationships cultivated between
scientists from around the world, often nurtured over decades. To
preserve those relationships under an Arctic Council with diminished
capacity, we recommend Western policymakers and other stakeholders
engage in bilateral initiatives extending beyond the Arctic Council
framework.

[Nongovernmental, informal interactions]{.underline} (known as Track II
diplomacy) [among scientists from Arctic]{.underline} (and even
non-Arctic) states could be a powerful strategy for keeping Russia
engaged and communicating with the global scientific community. The
first mechanism to try is for researchers in neighboring states or
territories (for example, Alaska, the Russian district of Chukotka, and
Yukon, a Canadian territory) to arrange for partnerships in climate
research. Strategically expanding approaches to scientific cooperation
in the polar regions, particularly through individual contacts, could
[**solidify** the Arctic's significance as a **focal point** for
**twenty-first-century science diplomacy**]{.underline}.

### 2AC---A2: Dip-Cap Zero-Sum

#### Turn: investing diplomatic capital [increases]{.underline} overall dip-cap. It's [positive-sum.]{.underline}

**[Investment in diplomatic capital]{.underline}** (i.e., in
institutions and norms designed to foster cross-cultural collaborations)
can [**strengthen** the **capabilities** of the **global community** to
**act together** for the **common good.**]{.underline}

[Institutions and norms of state diplomacy]{.underline} have been
**[developed]{.underline}** over centuries to support co-operation
between countries (Anderson 1993). This is an [example of]{.underline}
**[investment in diplomatic capital]{.underline}**, but all
international organisations must similarly develop norms and protocols
to be effective. The seven fundamental principles accepted by members of
the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, discussed earlier
in this chapter, is an obvious example. Similarly, the difficulties and
rewards of drawing on cultural differences business enterprises is well
recognised (Shenkar 2001). In short, any initiative that brings together
diverse actors to address a global issue requires diplomatic capital to
succeed.

Conclusion

Persons engage with global issues through specialist institutions that
aim to foster collaboration on the world stage. These institutions
include INGOs , MNCs and IGOs . Some institutions have undertaken
activities that damage wellbeing, particularly in developing countries.
Nevertheless, it is clear that some issues affecting the common good of
the global community cannot be solved without coordinated efforts from
diverse countries, large corporations and representatives of civil
society.

The capability to foster global collaboration must not be taken for
granted. In the language of this chapter, it requires [conscious
investment in diplomatic capital]{.underline}, defined as institutions
and norms designed to **[foster cross-cultural
collaborations]{.underline}**. This applies not only to diplomatic
relations among countries but to all initiatives that [**bring
together** **diverse actors** to address global issues]{.underline}.

## Internal Link 

### 2AC---A2: Internal Link---Other Countries Fill-In

#### Gulf states [fill the vacuum]{.underline} absent U.S. diplomacy.

It Fell to the Gulf States to Be India-Pakistan Peace-Brokers." TIME.

On the last two occasions that [**India** and **Pakistan** clashed
significantly over Kashmir,]{.underline} in 2016 and 2019, the U.S.
played a key role in deescalating tensions. However, today's [**Trump
administration** is taking a **hands-off approach**]{.underline}, with
Vice President J.D. Vance telling Fox News that the spat was
"fundamentally none of our business."

"The Pakistanis [**don't have that 'out'** that they used to have of
**relying on Washington** to ride in like the cavalry to save
them]{.underline}," says Karnad.

So, we're all screwed then? Not so fast. [Into the **fray** is instead
**galloping** an **unlikely arbitrator**: **Gulf States,** in particular
Saudi Arabia,]{.underline} who are today [playing]{.underline} a
[key]{.underline} though unfamiliar **[peace-making role.]{.underline}**

On Thursday, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir made a
surprise visit to India to meet External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar
and help broker a climbdown. Peace is clearly in Riyadh's interests,
given Saudi Arabia currently hosts some 2.6 million Indians working
alongside a similar cohort of Pakistanis. After all, when the Kashmir
attack unfolded, [Modi was in **Jeddah** to discuss the **India-Middle
East-Europe Economic** **Corridor** and advance an investment deal worth
\$100 billion.]{.underline}

"[**Gulf states** by the **nature** of their **relationships** with
**Pakistan** and **India** are going to become more **active** in urging
the **two** states to **exercise restraint**]{.underline}**,**" says
Samina Yasmeen, director of the Centre for Muslim States and Societies
at the University of Western Australia. "It's in their interest to
**[make sure that the region is stable]{.underline}**."

Still, it's a remarkable transformation for Saudi Arabia in particular,
which has long been the world's preeminent exporter of Islamist
terrorism. From financing 9/11 to waging war against the Iran-backed
Houthis in Yemen to the torture and murder of dissident journalist Jamal
Khashoggi, the kingdom has been an undeniably destabilizing presence.

However, regional dynamics have shifted in recent years. The Gulf's
swelling economic and diplomatic clout has corresponded with interests
replacing ideology as the chief driver of foreign policy, as illustrated
by the remarkable (though ultimately aborted) negotiations toward the
normalization of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.

At any rate, the [historic]{.underline} [**Great Powers** are no longer
the sole repositories of global influence]{.underline}. Other than the
[**Saudis**, nations like **Qatar** and the **UAE** are **filling the
vacuum**]{.underline}. Rather than fanning the flames by backing fellow
Islamic state Pakistan in the ongoing crisis, [Qatar and the UAE both
**urged restraint**]{.underline}. Doha even went so far as to back New
Delhi in the spat, at least according to an Indian readout.

## Impact: Indo-Pak

### 2AC---A2: !---India-Pakistan conflict 

#### Deterrence stops escalation---no one wants war.

**Menon '25** \[Rajan; May 8, 2025. Spitzer Professor Emeritus of

mgm\]

Yet [Modi]{.underline} isn't captive to Indian public opinion. Instead,
he orchestrates and manipulates it masterfully, and [won't
permit]{.underline} popular passions [to dictate his decisions without
regard to consequences]{.underline}. India waited until 7 May before
using missiles and air strikes to target several military sites located
in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and inside Pakistan. Though
[Pakistan's]{.underline} military said that the [strikes]{.underline}
killed at least 31 and injured at least 46 more, [India has described
its retaliation as "focused, measured and non-escalatory]{.underline},"
adding that it had "[demonstrated **considerable
restraint**]{.underline}" -- a [choice of words that signaled the
**desire** to **prevent** the crisis from **careening out of
control**]{.underline}. As for Pakistan, it has vowed to hit back;
national pride, together with the need to show India that it can't act
with impunity, ensure that it will make good on the threat. Indeed, it
claimed that it had already done so by shooting down five Indian jets
and at least one drone during the strike. Still, [Pakistan]{.underline},
like [India, has **compelling reasons to avoid** an all-out war, which
would be hugely destructive.]{.underline}

[Paradoxically]{.underline}, [the fact that this crisis involves two
**nuclear-armed states** offers **grounds for optimism**.]{.underline}
Though nuclear weapons rightly evoke horror, [military strategists have
generally assumed that they will **prevent** both **nuclear** and
"**conventional" war** between states that possess them]{.underline}.
The [prospect of immediate mass carnage will]{.underline}, it is hoped,
[deter **leaders** from firing their nuclear weapons at states that can
retaliate in kind.]{.underline} An extension of this claim has it that
even [if nuclear-armed states do embark on a conventional war, they will
strive to **keep it limited**]{.underline} so as [to **avert nuclear
escalation**.]{.underline} This two-step logic, though hardly the
equivalent of an ironclad law, [has **held up for a generation** and
extends to other adversaries who have nuclear weapons]{.underline}, such
as India and China, China and the United States, and the United States
and Russia.

That said, in South Asia the reliability of the "balance of terror"
claim is currently being tested to a degree we've not witnessed since
the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. What's more, the fact that there hasn't
been an unbridled war between nuclear-armed states doesn't guarantee
that the fear of catastrophe will prevent the leaders of India and
Pakistan from turning to their nuclear weapons -- or threatening to. Nor
can we be certain that the current crisis won't beget a runaway
conventional war. On balance, however, it's reasonable to expect that
**[the spectre of nuclear war will check recklessness on both
sides]{.underline}**.

#### No nuclear escalation---experts agree.

[India's **measured** and **proportionate response** without **crossing
th**e **airspace**]{.underline}, [along with the fact that there is no
**direct military-to-military combat** yet, should **preclude any threat
of nuclear escalation**,]{.underline} assuming Pakistan will behave
sanely. Islamabad has called the Indian strikes on terrorist camps in
PoK and Pakistan Punjab a violation of its sovereignty, but its
[tactical or non-strategic **tactical nuclear weapons** have always been
seen as intended for use **against a ground invasion**]{.underline} and
not against limited strikes against terrorists.

Pakistan developed the nuclear-capable short-range HATF missile with a
range of only 60-70 km to deter any Indian invasion.

However, after India announced its decision to put the Indus Waters
Treaty in abeyance, Pakistan responded by declaring it will respond to
any attempt to divert water with "full force across the complete
spectrum of national power". This was seen as a use of nuclear threat,
something which the UNSC warned against in the closed-door meeting on
India-Pakistan tensions this week.

It was seen as serious escalation by a country which doesn't have a
no-first use policy and has said in the past that one of the thresholds
for the use of its nuclear arsenal is economic strangling, including
"the stopping of the waters of the Indus river".

[**Nuclear expert** Hans Kristensen said he **didn't see a direct
threat** of **nuclear escalation** as the **level of hostilities is
still**]{.underline} relatively [low and India's **Cold Start doctrine**
is about an **overwhelming military invasion** of territory, which is
**not**]{.underline} yet [the **situation here**.]{.underline}

#### No nuclear war---deterrence.
