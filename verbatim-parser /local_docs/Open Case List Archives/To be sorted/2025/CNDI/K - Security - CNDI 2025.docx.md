Whether you read US Army and Coastal Guard Strategies from other Arctic
states or the front page of the New York Times, [the Arctic is becoming
nearly synonymous with fears about Russia and China.]{.underline}
Military strategists and journalists alike write about Russian
militarization as well as unwelcome Chinese influence in the High North.
While there are certainly geopolitical realities to take into
consideration when thinking about Arctic policy, [in focusing too
heavily on questions of "hard" security, policymakers are obscuring
other transnational issues, such as climate change and cyber security,
where cooperation is not only desired but also necessary.]{.underline}
In other words, [discussing interstate competition too much leads the
Arctic on a trajectory toward becoming a securitized
region.]{.underline} Yet, it doesn't have to be this way. [This trend
can --- and should --- be reversed to mitigate possible
consequences,]{.underline} such as: Focusing on how cooperation can be
used to solve key issues in the Arctic rather than thinking solely about
military buildup; changing the framing of the Arctic in official
policies, speeches, and critical international organizations, such as
the Arctic Council, and finding low-stakes issues to encourage
relationship-building among actors in the Arctic. So, can the Arctic be
spared from securitization? EARLY SYMPTOMS OF SECURITIZATION
Securitization is the process of something becoming a security threat or
a security issue. It happens when something --- such as immigration ---
is labeled as dangerous, threatening, and as an existential crisis by
someone, and then that framing is accepted by an audience. Importantly,
securitization implies that security issues are not just out there.
Instead, [by creating security threats in the way we speak, we create
security issues.]{.underline} While the Arctic might seem like a
peripheral region globally, there is evidence that it is beginning to
rise in importance. [Concerns about China, Russia, and resource
competition are causing real changes to occur in how states treat the
Arctic]{.underline}. The United States, for example, has announced the
establishment of the Arctic Regional Center, which will be housed within
the Department of Defense and focus on the "unique challenges and
security concerns related to the Arctic region." As climate change has
resulted in new shipping lanes and easier access to resources in the
Arctic, the interests of Arctic states --- United States, Russia,
Canada, Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden --- and non-Arctic
states --- China, United Kingdom, and EU to name a few --- have grown.
The Arctic presents virtually untapped amounts of oil, gas, and minerals
that attract both Arctic and non-Arctic states. A United States
Geological Survey 2008 report also described the Arctic continental
shelves as potentially constituting "the geographically largest
unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth."
[While]{.underline} it is true that [some states, such as China, are
finding investment opportunities with Arctic states to build
infrastructure]{.underline} as part of the Polar Silk Road (part of the
Belt and Road Initiative), [it is by no means a necessity to treat
Chinese influence as inherently negative.]{.underline} By the same
logic[, Russian investment and military actions in the Arctic might seem
overtly negative, but it is important to contextualize Russian interest
in the Arctic as not recent, but historic. Instead, the rhetoric around
these issues has treated them as critical security risks, painting the
Arctic as the next theater of a new Cold War.]{.underline} But is the
Arctic really the next theater? The most significant concern when it
comes to treating the Arctic as a theater of great power competition is
the danger it presents in putting the Arctic on a trajectory of becoming
a securitized region. Rather than focusing on these interstate threats[,
there are more serious concerns, such as climate change and insecurities
that stem from it]{.underline} --- such as food, water, environmental,
and health security concerns [--- that affect individuals and impact
their quality of life. For]{.underline} example, Alaskan communities are
suffering from food insecurity because sea ice is melting, causing
traditional sea mammals that they would otherwise hunt, to move
elsewhere and decreasing their protection from the large ocean waves
that have in some cases caused devastating infrastructure damage. On
Little Diomede Island, for example, a late storm caused serious damage
to a water treatment plant, leaving the town without clean water and
without power[. By over-emphasizing "hard" security issues from Russia
and China, therefore, the rhetoric surrounding Arctic politics ignores
other important questions that impact people on the ground, particularly
Indigenous people whose livelihoods and societal resilience are
threatened by climate change.]{.underline} The most significant concern
when it comes to [treating the Arctic as a theater of great power
competition]{.underline} is the danger it presents in
[put]{.underline}ting [the Arctic on a trajectory of becoming a
securitized region.]{.underline} While it can be argued that as it
stands[, the Arctic is not a contested region or a region fraught with
wars, such as the Middle East and parts of Africa, it could be if the
trajectory of treating the Arctic as this region of competition and
security continues. Regions]{.underline} of the world do not [become
theaters of competition and conflict]{.underline} overnight, but instead
become that way [after years of construction that involves]{.underline}
a range of activities from [rhetoric and to military
buildups.]{.underline} Crimea is a telling example of this, where both
Ukraine and Russia slowly began ratcheting up bellicose discourse over
time which was followed by militarization. Now, Crimea is a point of
severe tension between the two states.

#### Preventing [competition]{.underline} from dominating Arctic narratives is key to [cooperation]{.underline} over [existential threats]{.underline}. Securitization's not [inevitable]{.underline} or [irreversible]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [shared]{.underline} knowledge and [interpretations play a
**crucial role** in shaping the perceptions]{.underline},
[behaviors]{.underline}, [and interactions of actors in the global
system]{.underline} (Flockhart, 2016, p. 85). [The AC's success in
diplomatic negotiations and its ability to foster cooperation among
Arctic states is an example of how]{.underline} shared knowledge and
[interpretations **shape perceptions** of the Arctic as a region
requiring cooperative solutions]{.underline} (Jóhannesson, 2022). [This
success in the Arctic has implications for **global diplomacy** and the
importance of cooperative forums in addressing **shared
challenges**]{.underline}. Furthermore, the [scientific cooperation
within the AC aimed at better environmental protection and sustainable
development exemplifies how shared knowledge and interpretations
influence **global scientific collaboration**]{.underline} (Jóhannesson,
2022). [Research findings and knowledge sharing in the Arctic contribute
to **global efforts** to combat **climate change** and protect the
**environment**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the **exclusion** of **hard
security** matters]{.underline} from the AC agenda [reflects **shared
interpretations** among Arctic states that the region should remain
**primarily focused** on non-military cooperation and environmental
concerns]{.underline} (Exner-Pirot et al., 2019). It aligns with Wendt's
(1992) perspective regrading principles of norms and shared
understandings. [This constructivist perspective helps us recognize how
the Arctic cooperative narrative **emerges**]{.underline},
**[spreads]{.underline}**, [and becomes **internalized** as a framework
for understanding the region's security dynamics]{.underline}.

In relation to great power competition [the increasing interest of
**great powers**]{.underline} like the US, Russia, and China [in the
Arctic]{.underline} due to economic opportunities and strategic
considerations (Gross, 2020; Lopez, 2021; Humpert, 2022) [shows how
shared knowledge and interpretations about the Arctic's changing
landscape can **influence** their global strategies]{.underline}. [This
competition in the Arctic could have implications for **global power
dynamics**]{.underline} and international relations. Wendt's (1992)
argument that structures manifest through formal rules and norms is
particularly relevant. [States' behaviors and interactions are
influenced by norms and rules associated with their **identities** and
**social groups**]{.underline}. [In the context of great power
competition]{.underline}, [norms related to cooperation and rivalry are
**constructed** and **internalized** over time]{.underline}.
Furthermore, Wendt's perspective reminds us that [the
Arctic's]{.underline} evolving structure, influenced by [norms
associated with cooperation and rivalry]{.underline}, [plays a **pivotal
role** in shaping how states respond to the challenges posed by the
melting Arctic and the dynamics of great power competition]{.underline}.

5.1.3 Identity and Logic of Actions

In constructivism, identities establish order and predictability in
domestic society and international politics (Hopf, 1998). [The presence
of **inter-subjective identities**]{.underline}, characterized by
stability and consistency, [forms the basis for **enduring
expectations** among states]{.underline}, [guiding their
behavior]{.underline}. [Arctic cooperation]{.underline}, as viewed
through a constructivist lens, [is influenced by]{.underline} the
identities of the participating states. The concept of inter-subjective
identities, characterized by stability and consistency, creates [a sense
of **order** and **predictability** in the region]{.underline} (Hopf,
1998). [Arctic states share an identity as Arctic actors]{.underline},
[emphasizing their **common interests** in environmental
preservation]{.underline}, [sustainable development]{.underline}, [and
cooperation in relation to the melting Arctic]{.underline} (Arctic
Council, n.d.-a). [This]{.underline} shared identity [forms the basis
for **enduring expectations** among states]{.underline}, [guiding their
behavior within the Arctic context]{.underline}.

[Even though the **US** and **Russia** have been able to work as
cooperative Arctic actors]{.underline} within the AC, one could argue
that, [as **great power competition** reenters the Arctic
region]{.underline}, [these Arctic cooperative actors may evolve back
into **confrontational superpowers**]{.underline}. This is amplified by
the behavior of the states the US, Russia, and China within the region
and their pursuit of economic gain and strategic consideration (Gross,
2020; Lopez, 2021; Humpert, 2022).

5.1.4 Agents and structures

As illustrated by Flockhart (2016, p. 88), the concept of mutual
constitution underscores the dynamic nature of how perspectives in the
Arctic region are constructed, perpetuated, and potentially transformed.
In the context of the melting Arctic, the notion of mutual constitution
central to constructivism becomes apparent. This perspective emphasizes
that [structures **influence** actors and are simultaneously **shaped**
by their practices]{.underline} (Giddens, 1991). Archer (1995) expands
on this concept by introducing "structuration," highlighting that
[agents **reproduce** and **transform** structures through their
actions]{.underline}. Consider, for instance, the changing Arctic
identities. [Historically]{.underline}, [Arctic states viewed themselves
**primarily** as]{.underline} the AC members [focused on **cooperative
governance**]{.underline} (Lackenbauer & Dean, 2021, p. 327).
[However]{.underline}, [as the region's resources become **more
accessible** and the potential for **great power competition**
increases]{.underline}, [these identities are evolving]{.underline}.
[States]{.underline} like the US [are adapting their practices and
identities to **assert themselves more forcefully** in the
region]{.underline}, [challenging the existing cooperative
structures]{.underline} (Flockhart, 2016, p. 88). The norms governing
Arctic security have also undergone transformation. The Arctic was
traditionally seen as a zone of cooperation, with a focus on
environmental protection and peaceful coexistence. However, the changing
geopolitical landscape and resource interests are reshaping these norms.
[The emergence of new security concerns related to resource competition
and military presence reflects how practices and interactions can
**influence security perspectives**]{.underline} (Archer, 1995).

Furthermore, disruptive events in the Arctic, such as the opening of new
shipping routes and resource extraction projects, challenge shared
meanings and existing structures of governance. These events expose the
inadequacy of traditional cooperative structures in addressing emerging
security issues. Arctic states must adapt their practices and identities
to address these challenges effectively (Flockhart, 2016, p. 90). This
demonstrates how the constructivist perspective, emphasizing the mutual
constitution of structures and actors, can help us understand the
evolving dynamics of Arctic security and cooperation in the face of
environmental changes and shifting power dynamics.

5.2 Arctic Exceptionalism Perspective

Before diving further into the analysis, this section will start of by
addressing how Arctic exceptionalism will be utilized in the discussion.
The theory of Arctic exceptionalism offers an insightful framework for
comprehending the distinctive characteristics of the Arctic region
(Lackenbauer & Dean, 2021, p. 327). This understanding provides
researchers with the tools to effectively identify and predict security
threats unique to the Arctic. However, authors and scholars such as
Gjørv and Hodgson (2019) argue that Arctic exceptionalism's narrow view
of Arctic security prevents it from taking meaningful actions to protect
the environment and human security. Furthermore, Melchiorre (2022)
contends that the Arctic is not exceptional and is instead a reflection
of the international order, suggesting that the "exceptional" idea of
the Arctic was an illusion. Nonetheless, the concept of Arctic
exceptionalism has predominantly been interpreted through the lens of
Gorbachev's speech, where he characterizes the Arctic as a "zone of
peace" (Gorbachev, 1987). Instead, by revisiting the origin of the
theoretical framework, which emphasized the distinction from other
regions due to extraordinary characteristics and the perspective of the
Arctic as a "land of tomorrow" requiring exceptional protection, this
revised interpretation of Arctic exceptionalism could offer valuable
insights into the security dynamics of the region (Lackenbauer & Dean,
2021; Young & Osherenko, 1989; Young, 1992). Revisiting this
origin-based interpretation of Arctic exceptionalism not only offers
insights into the security dynamics of the region but also unlocks a
fresh perspective on how its exceptional characteristics shape both the
challenges and opportunities it presents.

Considering these insights, understanding the security dynamics in the
Arctic necessitates a shifting focus from the usual narrative of Arctic
exceptionalism in favor of a strategy that considers the region's unique
characteristics and vulnerabilities. Recognizing the intricate interplay
between environmental, human, and traditional security components, we
see the Arctic as more than just a "zone of peace." The updated or
revisited understanding of Arctic exceptionalism motivates researchers
to look at security issues from various approaches.

Viewed through the Arctic exceptionalist lens, the rapid sea ice loss
and tundra thawing in the Arctic, occurring at a rate three times higher
than the global average, exemplify the region's exceptional response to
global climate change (Arctic Council, n.d.-a; World Wildlife Fund
Arctic, 2023). This distinctiveness underscores the exceptional nature
of the Arctic environment, a critical area for climate study and policy.
The increased frequency of forest fires, transformation of the Arctic
landscape, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity in response to
these climate changes are further examples of the Arctic exceptional
nature (Gigova & Paddison, 2023; Struzik, 2020; Greenpeace USA, 2015).
Notably, Arctic exceptionalism highlights that the Arctic's response to
global climate shifts differs significantly from other regions by the
intricate connection of climate change, environmental security, human
security, and the rise of geopolitical competition. Moreover, the
concept underscores that [the consequences of the melting Arctic extend
**beyond** its borders]{.underline}, [affecting ecosystems
**worldwide**]{.underline}. [This interconnectedness]{.underline},
highlighted by Arctic exceptionalism, [emphasizes the need for
**international cooperation** and]{.underline} policy actions to address
Arctic climate change as part of broader **[global]{.underline}**
climate **[efforts]{.underline}** (GreenFacts, 2010). [The exceptional
vulnerabilities and global ramifications of Arctic climate change
underscore the imperative for **responsible governance** and
**sustainable practices**]{.underline}, recognizing the Arctic's pivotal
role in the broader climate system and its impacts on human security
globally.

The concept of Arctic exceptionalism underscores the importance of
collaboration concerning the interconnectedness of global ecosystems and
the shared responsibility to address environmental challenges. [The
urgency to adopt sustainable practices becomes evident when considering
the potential ramifications of the Arctic's vulnerabilities on a
**global scale**]{.underline}. [As the Arctic region continues to
experience rapid changes]{.underline}, [it serves as a call to
action]{.underline} for individuals, communities, and nations [to work
**collaboratively** in mitigating **climate change**]{.underline},
[preserving **biodiversity**]{.underline}, [and promoting **sustainable
development** practices]{.underline}. [By understanding and addressing
the unique vulnerabilities of the Arctic, we can better appreciate the
imperative for **immediate** and **concerted efforts** to secure a
resilient and harmonious future for the Arctic region and the **entire
planet**]{.underline}. This idea finds resonance in the statement by
Lackenbauer and Dean (2021, p. 328), who describe the Arctic as a realm
of "compelling opportunities and exhilarating risk." Indeed, these
dynamics extend beyond the Arctic region to influence the rest of the
world.

Viewed through the lens of Arctic exceptionalism, the challenges faced
by Arctic residents due to the changing Arctic climate take on a unique
and exceptional character (Bludd, 2022; Reist et al., 2006). Indigenous
peoples experience the profound impacts of these changes on their
traditional livelihoods. Arctic exceptionalism highlights that the
Arctic's response to global climate shifts differs significantly from
other regions, as it encompasses environmental changes and deeply
intertwined human and cultural dimensions. Kornhuber et al. (2023) state
that even though Arctic exceptionalism is "blocked" in geopolitics, the
challenges the region faces remains exceptional. Therefore, investing
more in remote sensing initiatives for independent scientific data
collection, free from geopolitical tensions, could be considered
(ibid.). Moreover, engaging Arctic Indigenous Peoples in co-producing
knowledge on ecosystems, climate change, biodiversity, and environmental
development is crucial. Their involvement can enhance the understanding
of the Arctic\'s unique challenges and contribute to more sustainable
solutions within the framework of Arctic exceptionalism.

Greaves (2019) on the other hand argue how growing geopolitical
competition are breaking up the unified Arctic and creating three
distinct security regions across the polar area. This change is similar
to how global warming is transforming the Arctic Ocean into something
more like the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, erasing the Arctic\'s
uniqueness. This shift marks the end of the post-Cold War era when the
Arctic was seen as separate from global power struggles. As the Arctic
warms and becomes less distinct from lower-latitude regions, its
politics and security increasingly mirror those in the south (ibid.).
Furthermore, Greaves (2019) state that this fragmentation does not imply
that more conflict will come from within the region but will most likely
be caused by external factors spilling into the region. As a result, the
Arctic will become less distinct and more influenced by global factors,
reflecting the dynamics of neighboring regions rather than its unique
characteristics.

However, the perspective of Arctic exceptionalism is still relevant.
Arctic exceptionalism recognizes the distinct vulnerabilities of the
Arctic due to its extreme environmental conditions, which cannot be
easily compared to other regions like the Atlantic or Pacific Oceans.
Arctic exceptionalism underscores the critical importance of addressing
the region\'s specific environmental and security issues, such as rapid
climate change and the need for sustainable development. Furthermore,
supporters of Arctic exceptionalism might argue that [even if there is
increasing interaction with neighboring regions]{.underline}, [this does
not **diminish** the Arctic\'s uniqueness]{.underline}. Instead, [it
highlights the need for **international cooperation** and **governance
structures** tailored to the Arctic\'s distinct
characteristics]{.underline}.

Moreover, as the case of the melting Arctic has illustrated, the Arctic
faces many intricate security challenges. However, Käpylä and Mikkola
(2015) argue against the concept of Arctic exceptionalism, which
portrays the Arctic as a uniquely isolated and peaceful region. They
contend that this view is overly limited, asserting that the
contemporary Arctic is deeply entwined with global political dynamics
and should not be perceived in isolation. They substantiate their
argument with empirical cases, such as the Arctic Sunrise protest and
the Ukraine crisis, illustrating the Arctic\'s susceptibility to
external influences, challenging the notion of inherent regional
tranquility. Moreover, the authors emphasize the shortcomings of Arctic
governance mechanisms when dealing with complex political scenarios and
underscore the historical precedent of international conflicts spilling
over into the Arctic. This argument has credibility from how the AC
cooperation froze as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

While Käpylä and Mikkola (2015) make a compelling case for the Arctic\'s
interconnectedness with global dynamics, proponents of Arctic
exceptionalism argue that these global linkages do not negate the
region\'s unique characteristics and cooperative nature. They contend
that [while external factors can influence Arctic affairs]{.underline},
[the region has historically exhibited a remarkable degree of
**stability** and **cooperation** among Arctic states]{.underline},
[**despite** global conflicts]{.underline}. Arctic exceptionalism
proponents point to the AC as a forum where Arctic nations engage in
collaborative efforts on various issues, emphasizing the Arctic\'s
capacity for peaceful multilateral governance. They argue that [while
the Arctic may not be **completely immune** to global
influences]{.underline}, [its distinct]{.underline} geographical,
environmental, and geopolitical [features continue to foster
**cooperation** and **dialogue** among its stakeholders]{.underline},
[**setting it apart** from more conflict- prone areas of the
world]{.underline}.

Furthermore, the lens of Arctic exceptionalism offers a unique
perspective through which to understand the intricate dynamics between
the Arctic's distinctive vulnerabilities and the realm of great power
politics. As previously discussed, the Arctic region stands as a beacon
of rapid environmental transformation, prominently featuring the
emergence of previously inaccessible resources and newly established
shipping routes as primary drivers of these profound shifts (Foreign
Policy, 2020; Brodka, 2021; Marsh, 2022). This intersection of
environmental metamorphosis and the pursuit of geopolitical interests
within the Arctic stage underscores the exceptional and nuanced nature
of the Arctic's response to the world's broader challenges. Lackenbauer
on the other hand, argue that the Arctic region is not a region of
exceptional cooperation nor conflict as nations interests can have both
a cooperative and competitive nature Teeple, 2021). This is exemplified
in the Arctic states' cooperation through the AC, simultaneously as
countries such as the US and Russia participates in geopolitical
competition in the Arctic.

The intense race to exploit the untapped Arctic resources, including
oil, gas, and minerals, has, in turn, amplified the tensions among great
powers as Russia, China, and the United States vie for dominance in this
fragile environment (Bordka, 2021; Gross, 2020; Lopez, 2021; Humpert,
2022). However, the scope of this competition extends beyond traditional
resource rivalry, delving into previously uncharted territories. For
instance, the revelation of valuable minerals in Greenland, now
accessible due to receding ice, holds immense significance for green
technologies, thereby attracting mining companies (Marsh, 2022). This
multifaceted contestation reflects the intricate balance that Arctic
exceptionalism illuminates---a delicate balance between economic
interests and environmental concerns unparalleled in any other context.
Furthermore, Young et al. (2021) state that it is one cannot ignore the
Arctic as a stage for future global competition, but rather provides the
perspective of the Arctic as a zone for peaceful competition.

Moreover, Arctic exceptionalism does not merely underscore [the
**environmental repercussions** of resource extraction and
infrastructure development in the Arctic]{.underline}; it also
[emphasizes the **unparalleled vulnerabilities** inherent to the
region]{.underline}. For instance, [the expansion of **oil drilling** in
this unique ecosystem poses not just risks but **dire
consequences**]{.underline}, [such as the potential for oil spills that
could inflict **devastating harm** upon the fragile Arctic marine
ecosystem]{.underline} (Borshchevskaia et al., 2022). Furthermore, [the
opening of Arctic **shipping** routes]{.underline}, while promising
economic gains, [ushers in the peril of increased maritime traffic that
introduces **noise pollution**]{.underline}---a disruption that imperils
Arctic marine mammals' communication and navigation (WWF Arctic,
n.d.-a). These instances underscore the extraordinary character of the
Arctic's vulnerabilities.

[Within this complex tapestry of challenges lies the predominant
necessity of **responsible governance**]{.underline}, firmly positioning
itself as the core of Arctic exceptionalism's application. [In the heart
of great power politics]{.underline}, [the AC is a **cooperative
platform** where states convene to collectively address the multifaceted
environmental and human security concerns]{.underline}, [even as
geopolitical rivalries play out]{.underline}. Arctic exceptionalism
recognizes the pivotal role of sustainable development in navigating
this ever-accelerating pace of Arctic transformation. [Responsible
governance would emerge as an **imperative** to forestall environmental
degradation and safeguard]{.underline} Arctic communities'
[well-being]{.underline}.

Resource [competition]{.underline}, as manifested [in the
Arctic]{.underline}, does more than reshape the region; it [transforms
it into an intricate theater where strategic calculations]{.underline},
[environmental imperatives]{.underline}, [and geopolitical rivalries
converge]{.underline}. Within this dynamic tapestry, [striking a
**balance** between economic interests]{.underline}, [environmental
preservation]{.underline}, [and human security becomes an
**extraordinary challenge**]{.underline}, uniquely expounded upon by the
framework of Arctic exceptionalism. [It underscores the **profound
importance** of]{.underline} prioritizing the Arctic's inhabitants'
welfare and the global environment's well-being in pursuing the region's
resource wealth. In navigating these labyrinthine intersections, great
powers could exemplify [leadership in addressing the **global
challenges** that transcend the Arctic while embracing the tenets of
**responsible governance** and **international
cooperation**]{.underline} within the exceptional Arctic context.

#### Our alternative is a post-positivist approach to the knowledge claims of the 1AC. Reject their value-neutral objective approach in favor of a critical interrogation of the role their representations play in furthering the violence of the status quo

While the China Threat Discourse has become dominant in the West, other
readings challenge the notion that China's rise cannot be peaceful
(Zhang & Buzan, 2010). Such diﬀerent [readings underscore the **role of
perception to analysis.** Capturing this requires a methodology
**unbound by positivist approaches that focus on objective condition**s
in order to build explanatory theories that attempt to accord IR
theorists with predictive powers]{.underline} (Sterling-Folker, 2013, p.
7). [Whereas positivists use transhistorical structures to determine why
actors will take certain actions]{.underline}, Doty notes that
['**explanations for why-questions are incomplete** in an important
sense']{.underline} (1993, p. 298). Sterling-Folker argues that [**for
post-positivists 'the primary activity of an IR theorist is to reveal
how international events are described** ... **and how those
descriptions justify actions and arguments in a self-fulﬁlling cycle of
codetermination'**]{.underline} (2013, p. 9, emphasis added). This
article aligns itself with post-positivist exploration of how-questions
to analyse the codetermination between the central discourses it
explores. In the US, the China threat tends to be propagated by
(neo)realists who 'assume that insecurity derives from the objectively
threatening complexion of certain issues'(Balzacq et al., 2016, p. 496).
Indeed, American Sinophobia has relied on realist arguments that couch
China threat arguments in positivist language and conceal otherwise
subjective arguments in the language of objective truths (Yang & Liu,
2012, pp. 707-708). However, [positivist analyses do not help us
understand what these case studies mean and how they are discursively
interlinked because '**knowledge is not neutral ... problem-solving
positivism needs to be replaced by a critical theory, aware of the
political interests it represents'**]{.underline}(Smith, 1997, p. 24).
[**Post-positivism allows us to examine discursive constructions and
biases that underscore foreign policy, and therefore national
security**.]{.underline} This article examines how perceptions of the
Chinese Other, and, implicitly, the US Self, have aﬀected US foreign
policy. Hansen notes that ['foreign policies rely upon representations
of identity, but **it is also through the formulation of foreign policy
that identities are produced and reproduced**]{.underline}**'** (Hansen,
2006, p. 1). Because ['policy is not always based on rational choices
and interests, but can be aﬀected by the cognitive beliefs, perceptions,
and personalities of key individuals']{.underline} (Skonieczny, 2001, p.
437), [**post-positivist methods are essential to the examination of the
Sino-American relationship** as they can engage with key elements that
positivist approaches disregard as immaterial. **Securitization is
central to this analysis** because it is able to engage with social
constructs of foreign policy and how material factors are ideationally
'read.']{.underline} It has become so dominant as a theory that it is
now an analytical shorthand for the political construction of security'

I analyze how [[the evolution of U.S. Arctic policy reflects a broader
narrative of status anxiety]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has
[[served]{.underline}]{.mark} not as a paralyzing force but [[as a
catalyst for strategic recalibration]{.underline}]{.mark}. Historically,
the Arctic was peripheral to U.S. foreign policy, viewed primarily
through the domestic lens of Alaska and rarely integrated into the
country's global strategy. However, the changing geopolitical
landscape---marked by the rise of [[Russia and China as key players in
the region]{.mark}---]{.underline}has redefined the Arctic as a critical
frontier for great power competition. The analysis of U.S. Arctic policy

[including]{.mark} alliance-building, infrastructure investments, and
[heightened military engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}. This shift
underscores the dual nature of anxiety: while it signals vulnerability,
it also motivates states to adapt and innovate in the face of perceived
challenges. By reframing anxiety as a constructive force, this paper
contributes to a deeper understanding of the emotional drivers behind
state behavior. [Status anxiety, in particular]{.underline}, [offers a
compelling lens for interpreting how hegemonic powers like the United
States respond to emerging threats in contested regions.]{.underline}
The Arctic's transformation from a zone of cooperation and idealism to a
theater of competition illustrates how anxiety can reshape priorities,
galvanize action, and redefine geopolitical landscapes. As the United
States continues to navigate its role in the Arctic, our findings
suggest that anxiety will remain a powerful driver of policy. Far from
debilitating, [[this status anxiety is likely to spur further engagement
as the U.S. seeks to maintain its standing]{.mark} in an increasingly
contested world.]{.underline}

#### Securitizing Russia and China in the arctic is an attempt to shore up US identity and overcome its status anxiety - the result is material change in policy that leads to militarized competition

Conversely, [[status anxiety affects higher-ranked
actors]{.underline}]{.mark} witnessing a decline in one or more
dimensions conferring status compared to a rising competitor -- in this
case, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and its perceptions of
Russia and]{.mark} [China]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such instances, these
actors perceive a threat to their overall rank, [[instigating]{.mark} a
fear of demotion or [status]{.mark} [anxiety]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
[ontological anxiety concerns internal coherence and narrative
disruption, status anxiety [reflects fear of diminished external
recognition]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this paper[, both are
entangled]{.underline}: the [[U.S. fears losing]{.mark} not only
strategic influence, but also [its identity as Arctic
leader]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is crucial to note that status anxiety
is not merely any incongruity in the statuses of a high-ranked actor, as
even dominant actors seldom rank uniformly high across all dimensions.
Instead, status anxiety pertains to a specific incongruity arising from
the perceived competition of an actor poised to surpass them in one or
more areas (Onea, 2014). For example, [the post-Cold War [dominance of
the United States is more pronounced in military capabilities]{.mark}
than in economics or prestige, [without instigating status
anxiety]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [if [the U.S. appears on the
brink of being overtaken by another state]{.mark} in any of these
dimensions[, status anxiety ensues]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently,
[st[atus inconsistency in one actor is likely to trigger status anxiety
in another]{.mark}]{.underline}, as an improvement in one dimension for
the former implies a 78 simultaneous reduction in available status for
the latter, leading to perceived threats to self esteem. In line with
Tajfel and Turner's (2010) argument, even the dominant or high-status
group may experience insecure social identity, prompting them to resist
perceived threats and uphold their superior position. Therefore, status
anxiety serves as a motivating factor for dominant actors to impede the
progress of new entrants, maintain superiority in areas where they
excel, and recuperate losses in those where they have fallen behind.
Onea (2014) describes that three major hierarchies confer a polity
international status, and, [in order for a state to dominate the others,
it would need to excel in all of them: military capabilities, economic
capabilities, and prestige]{.underline}. Whenever a state experiences a
change in rankings under these three aforementioned hierarchies, a
discrepancy of status and will to balance or rebalance them would occur.
Additionally, should a dominant state perceive a threat to its standing
in any of those three dimensions due to the ascent of a competitor, it
would experience status anxiety. Consequently, this anxiety propels
dominant states to resist assertions of equality or superiority from
emerging powers. This resistance can be elucidated by the principles of
prospect theory, which posit that [status anxiety is more keenly felt
than status inconsistency]{.underline}. This is attributable to the
psychological tendency to resent losses more intensely than gains,
implying that a decline in status holds greater significance for an
actor than further advancement. Consequently, dominant powers are
inclined to adopt a more risk-acceptant stance compared to rising
powers, as they strive to safeguard their established status.
Conversely, rising powers tend to be more risk-averse and, therefore,
more inclined toward conciliation. Besides the conceptualization of
status anxiety, Onea (2014) also describes the methods through which to
identify it in international relations through a three-step process.
First, one should \"encounter evidence that it was the dominant state's
intransigence that affected the initiation and 79 the continuation of
rivalry\" (Onea, 2014, p. 138). Second, one should monitor primary
sources from decision-makers, such as official statements, speeches,
correspondence, and memoirs[. [The confirmation of status anxiety is
evident when]{.mark} decision-makers express apprehension about the
decline in their state's standing compared to a competitor and harbor
concerns about the potential displacement by the emerging
power]{.underline}. [Third, there should be [policies reflective of a
heightened sense of physical threat, indicating that the security
language employed by policymakers was actually translated into material
action.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Development

#### Development is inevitably securitized which constitutes an increase in conflict in the name of [progress]{.underline}.

5.1.5 Development is security

Another key governmentality revolves around the prominence of
development discourses in the policy. [The protection of the state and
the [securing]{.mark} of [populations]{.mark} that live within them is
[articulated through development]{.mark} [discourses]{.mark} based on a
presupposition that development, peace, and security are **inextricably
linked**.]{.underline} Alongside "addressing the root causes of
violence" the policy has a primary objective of "providing a foundation
for sustainable development". 131 This way of thinking is so strong
among the UN that it is observed by the [widely recognized phrase "there
will be no development without security, and no security without
development".]{.underline}132 [Each of these elements; **[security,
development]{.mark}**, and rights, [are **inseparable**]{.mark} within
this policy,]{.underline} wherein development is equal to specific forms
of governance, and institutional and legal reforms that bring states in
line with a governmental ideal. 133

This follows the implicit agreement that has been at the heart of
liberal peacebuilding for much of the past two decades; that
state-building is peacebuilding.134 Seen from this perspective, acts of
securitisation involve redesigning the entire state apparatus, and
social structures to prevent a relapse into violence and build a
'stable' post-conflict state.135 The rationale here is that through
development that eradicates forms of insecurity, such as food, and
health insecurity, countries become less likely to experience
conflict.136

From a post-structural perspective, however, [[development]{.mark} is
more than about just reforming structures to better serve populations,
it [is about organising and **regulating bodies**]{.mark} within
structures [to make them act]{.mark} in accordance [with
government]{.mark}al aims.]{.underline} 137 Escobar explains how
development discourse functions "not as a natural process of knowledge
that gradually uncovered problems and dealt with them", but "as a
historical construct that provides a space in which poor countries are
known, specified, and intervened upon."138 [Thus, [rather than
responding to problems, **development constitutes them**]{.mark}. For
example, Afghanistan is constituted as a state in need of development in
the policy by [framing resources as "**major sources of
conflict**]{.mark}", but also objects that imply "a transformative
impact on the country's development trajectory"]{.underline}139,
[thereby [open]{.mark}ing the [space up for]{.mark} highly [politicised
interventions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whether those interventions, in
general, provide a net benefit and can reduce structural and direct
violence is a substantial and important question, but one that is beyond
the scope of this paper. Rather this section serves to present
development as a key governmentality supporting securitisation.

### Terror

#### The rhetoric of identifying "terrorists" is deeply interconnected with securitization, justifies further violence, and prevents any questioning of the state.

**Dixit 15** (Priya Dixit, Department of Political Science, Virginia
Polytechnic Institute & State University "Securitization and
Terroristization: Analyzing States' Usage of the Rhetoric of Terrorism"
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-11181-6_3)** **

There have been extensive discussions about the meanings and definitions
of secu- ritization. In this chapter, [securitization is both an act of
naming issues and events as "security" and also the processes
surrounding its emergence and proliferation]{.underline}. Since
securitization is taken to be a process, it is one that depends on how
"se- curity" is used and responded to. Related questions, of course, are
who outlines security? Who relates to this? Who (if anyone) questions
this? Jeremy Waldron claims that [security is something we need to
discuss in relation to states and their actions regarding torture, laws,
and related actions in the post-9/11 period (2010).]{.underline} In his
discussion of security and terrorism, Waldron provides a far-ranging
discus- sion of the post-9/11 security situation in the United States
through ethical, legal, and philosophical frames. In a discussion about
terrorism, Waldron claims that [it is **not just non-state actors** that
can **create an environment of terror** but **states can and have done
such** as well (2010, p. 14).]{.underline} This chapter draws on
Waldron's under- standing of the state's engagement in violent acts and
focuses specifically on how securitization of specific issues, minority
groups, actions, occurs. Overall, the focus remains on [**the rhetoric
of "security", especially** **"terrorism**"]{.underline} and how this
[has helped **create a context in which states' use of violence often go
unquestioned and unpunished**.]{.underline} This means [the user of
"**security" rhetoric**, those who are labeled dangerous (or not
dangerous) and the audience are all part of pro- cesses by which
securitization occurs.]{.underline} [Moving to terrorism, this is a
**similar process** wherein **terroristization occurs**.]{.underline}
Thus, the focus in this chapter is on states and how they use the label
of security or terrorism in this case. What are the practices of ter-
roristization that exist in liberal democratic states? How do they
operate? What are the implications of who is included as "terrorist"?
Who is considered supporters of terrorists and who is not? By [outlining
a **securitization-inspired approach to** study
**terrorism**]{.underline}, this chapter hopes to provide tools to
[better understand the **practices by which** some **individuals and
groups are deemed "terrorist"**]{.underline}. On a related note, the
implication of this labeling for and as state violence is a central
theme here. But, first, it is worth describing what is meant by violence
in this chapter. Vio- lence usually means the use of physical force by
various social actors. However, for this chapter, two other definitions
are essential: one, that security and insecurity are products of
structural violence that is part of the societal system we all live in.
The definition of structural violence comes from Johan Galtung who
defines it as: "The violence \[is\] built into the structure and shows
up as unequal power and consequently as unequal life chances" (Galtung
1969, p. 171). Galtung (1969) makes a distinction between direct
violence and indirect violence. Direct violence requires an actor who
has the intention of killing or maiming or making people in- capacitated
in some way. For example, the 2014 revelations that the United States'
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) tortured detainees could be considered
a form of direct violence. Structural violence, on the other hand, is
often indirect and is part of the system within which we live our lives.
It is often unseen but its effects can be noted in unequal access to
resources and "unequal life chances." Galtung writes, "...structural
violence may be seen as about as natural as the air around us" (1969, p.
173). For example, differences in health and in life expectancies
between Indigenous peoples and non-Indigenous peoples in settler
societies (e.g. Canada, Australia, United States, among others) are
partly the outcome of structural vio- lence over time. Related to this,
one can argue that state violence is a form of structural violence.
[**The state's capacity to label** specific acts and peoples **as "ter-
rorist" or "not terrorist"** and the related powers to manage them can
**fall under** the understanding of **structural
violence**.]{.underline} The second understanding of violence that is
relevant here is the concept of symbolic violence. Here, we can refer
back again to Galtung and his understanding of "cultural violence". He
defined this as "those aspects of culture, the symbolic sphere of our
existence---exemplified by religion and ideology, language and art,
empirical science and formal science (logic, mathematics)---that can be
used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence" (1990, p.
291). My focus in this chapter is on how [groups, individuals and even
issues are conceptualized as threats to the state but also to societal
security]{.underline}. As such, part of the argument is that it is the
states' labeling of others as "terrorist" that can also be considered
violent. This is especially the case because such labels can (and have)
led to physical vio- lence against those who mainstream society deems to
be associated with or actual36 P. Dixit "terrorists". These two key
understandings of violence will be used to contextual- ize the following
discussion on securitization and terroristization. Securitization has
been extensively outlined, extended and critiqued. Vuori (2008) outlines
five ways of possible securitization and writes, Security serves various
political functions in various contexts. If the purpose of
securitization studies is to gain an increasingly precise understanding
of who can securitize, which issues (threats), for whom (referent
objects), why, with what kinds of effects, and under which conditions
(what explains when securitization has been successful) (Buzan et al.
1998; Buzan and Wæver 2003), it is useful to investigate security speech
in as many contexts as possible (p. 68). One of the contributions of
thinking and [studying terrorism as part of processes by which actors
and issues are considered "terrorist" is that it is **related to the use
of "security"**.]{.underline} In other words, ["security speech" as
Vuori (2008) calls it often follows and is directly linked to "terrorism
speech".]{.underline} After all, [one would need to **conceptu- alize**
and communicate that **terrorism is a major threat to state and society
security** **before policies and practices to manage such terrorism**
(and thus ensure security) **are established**. This means that the use
of "terrorism" rhetoric is connected to "se- curity"
rhetoric---**terroristization and securitization are
interconnected**]{.underline}. Without the use of "terrorism" rhetoric,
security would need to be reconceptualized, perhaps as human security or
food security or economic security. If this were to occur, a mili-
tarized response to the insecurity could be more difficult to promote
and sustain. [In mainstream conceptualizations of violence and security,
"security" is gener- ally taken to mean a subjective
state]{.underline}---one feels insecure due to threats of vio-
lence---or an objective measurement. In this latter understanding,
social actors, whether states or individuals or collectives, can measure
security and security can be increased or decreased. [Securitization
moves beyond these two conceptualiza- tions and, instead, focuses on the
processes by which something or someone be- comes categorized as a
security issue in the first place and the related practices that then
emerge to manage this issue]{.underline}. Writing in a forum on
securitization theory, Balzacq and Guzzini (2014) make this clear:
Securitization is rooted in the basic idea that the existence and
management of certain issues as security problems does not necessarily
depend upon objective, or purely material conditions[...\[S\]omething
acquires a security status as a result of an inter- subjective process
involving a securitizing actor and an audience...One of the central
implications of this idea is that once established, **securitization
enables policy makers** to immediately **adopt whatever means they deem
appropriate** to curb the threat]{.underline} (p. 3).Securitization and
Terroristization 37 Thus, [the **potential for further terrorism** in
the period after 11 September, 2001 ("9/11") was given as a **reason**
for the CIA's interrogation program.]{.underline} Defending its
**[inhumane tactics]{.underline}**, former Secretary of Defense Dick
Cheney said, "I would do it again in a minute" (quoted in Shane 2014).
Despite this, [neither he nor any other US government or CIA official
has been prosecuted for their actions]{.underline} and it is un- likely
they ever will be (Bendery 2014).  

### Disease

#### Their securitization of disease as a international threat ignores the root causes of global sickness, drawing in neoliberal and militarized forces which contradict the common good and [zeroes solvency]{.underline}.

Jens **Holst 23** \[3/4/23, Jens Holst retired in 2024 from his job as a
Professor for Medicine with Special Focus on Global Health at the

health",

//Sreekantan

A narrative, iterative review of the available literature on health
security indicates an increasing biomedicalization of public health that
has contributed significantly to making the linkage between health and
security the priority discourse in global health and its governance.
Security aspects and considerations have gained both acceptance and
importance in the last decades. The quest for security is understandable
in an increasingly inequitable, unstable and disjointed world,
particularly vis-à-vis the militarization of conflicts and international
relations. But a closer look at the concept of health security makes
things appear more complicated. It often remains unclear what is meant
by this form of security, who defines it and who is being targeted by
security policies as well as how health security is to be generated
\[10\]. [[Health security]{.mark} remains [centred on]{.mark} the
**security of [nation states]{.mark}** and defence against international
threats, **[rather than prioritizing people's health]{.mark}** and its
determination]{.underline} \[11\]. Policymakers in high-income countries
tend to emphasise protection of their populations particularly against
external threats, for example bioterrorism, zoonoses and pandemics,
whereas many---but not all---global health professionals understand the
term in a broader context of social health protection, population health
and its determination \[12\]. Over the last two decades, global health
security has often become virtually and almost interchangeably
synonymous with global health \[13\]. However, this perspective rather
exhibits a conceptual narrowing than epistemic clarity. Global health
security is actually but one area of the global health domain, as it
primarily addresses cross-border health threats but not the whole span
of global health policy \[14, 15\]. Meanwhile, a universal definition of
global health security is still lacking, despite the abundance of
available literature on human and (global) health security. The recent
attempt of the WHO, as the United Nations (UN) agency specialised on
health, to define global health security falls short as it focuses
predominantly on the international spread of acute infectious threats
\[16\]. The fact that the use of the term "health security" by different
actors is as widespread as it is inconsistent is by no means
attributable to the difficulty of achieving conceptual clarification,
but rather to the widely divergent perceptions, interests, priorities,
politics, and power relations that exist in the broader field of global
health \[17\]. Despite its widespread use, the World Health Assembly has
not yet agreed on a resolution on the concept of 'health security',
indicating that its scope is contested among member states \[18\].
Health security in international foreign policy Already before the
COVID-19 outbreak, global health was high on the international political
agenda and played an important role at summit meetings of international
fora of high-income and emerging countries such as the "Group of 7"
(G7), and the "Group of 20" (G20) \[19\]. However, [the prevailing
global health [security approach]{.mark} tends to be [insufficient
for]{.mark} adequately [catering]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [complexity of
challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is a [need to harmonise the
contemporary security debate with other fundamental health-policy
challenges from an equity perspective]{.underline} \[20, 21\]. Current
global health programmes often fail to fulfil the claim to universalism
implicitly associated with the term "global" and tend to neglect the
requirements of a comprehensive transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary
understanding of health security policies. There is still a large
discrepancy between the current state of knowledge on improving health
security, equity and actual global health politics and practices \[22\].
This trend is partly attributable to the unexpected resurgence of
epidemic risks that were considered defeated or at least controllable in
high-income countries in recent years. Since the last two decades, a
rapid (re)-emergence of pathogenic infectious diseases has been seen in
several regions of the world, including, but not restricted to, diseases
such as SARS, avian influenza, Ebola, Zika, and most recently, COVID-19.
These outbreaks have each led to the application of control measures
around the world and strongly influenced the global health debate in
which securitization has become a prevalent and common theme among
global health scholars and practitioners \[23\]. At the same time, other
health threats such as tuberculosis, malaria, or chronic conditions like
cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus persisted. However,
[[neither]{.mark} [poverty]{.mark}-related infections [nor]{.mark} the
growing prevalence of [n]{.mark}on-[c]{.mark}ommunicable
[d]{.mark}isease[s]{.mark} [have]{.mark} ever [received the **attention
they deserve**]{.mark} due to the continuous upward trend,]{.underline}
particularly in countries in transition \[24\]. Notwithstanding this
alarming global burden of disease trend both in the Global North and
South\[25\], [it is not the major killers, but the rapid succession of
transnational 'health crises' caused by viral infections that repeatedly
provoke a state of alert and make the headlines]{.underline}. However,
public interest in the general health-related challenges of other
countries and continents is usually short-lived and transient. [In
low-income countries the situation is fundamentally different. Certain
health hazards persist and [the risk of 'endemic' diseases]{.mark} and
their underlying 'syndemics' is [part of everyday
life]{.mark}]{.underline} \[26\]. In the course of epidemiological
transition, the disease spectrum is increasingly expanding or even
shifting from infectious to non-communicable, chronic diseases. During
the last decades, societies in the Global South and elsewhere have been
facing a double burden of disease caused by bacterial, viral or other
pathogens on the one hand, and health problems commonly referred to as
non-communicable diseases (NCD's) on the other \[27\]. The simultaneous
coexistence of undernourishment, malnutrition or dietary overweight
exacerbates the situation \[28\]. Securitization of global health Global
health has become an important area of foreign and security policy and
hence of international diplomacy \[29\]. In fact, the UN Security
Council has addressed health beyond the issue of epidemics and pandemics
and taken the role of a forum to debate and negotiate global health
issues; this reflects primarily the political interests of the permanent
five, particularly the USA \[30\]. Health security often shapes the
global health debate more than other health issues. Security is
frequently encountered as a contextual framework in political health and
foreign-policy documents, and the securitization of health has for some
time now been considered a key feature in global health governance
\[31\]. Security practices and medical knowledge share a common
evolutionary history; to consider and analyse them as independent of
each other would be to ignore the historical formation of nation states
and also the colonial roots of global health \[32\]. [[Security]{.mark}
is one of several global health "frames" that are by no means exclusive,
but have been [driven]{.mark} in recent decades [by]{.mark} a deep core
of **[neoliberal values]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[33\]. This implies that
in contemporary global health governance there is an overemphasis on
agency, while deeper structures, including its embedded ideas and
configurations of powers, are neglected \[31\]. As such, neoliberalism
has become the globally "hegemonic paradigm" during the first two
decades of the twenty-first century \[34\]. [[Covid]{.mark}-19
[and]{.mark} viral [neoliberalism]{.mark} must be understood as
[co-pathogeneses]{.mark} whereby the corona-virus pandemic has disclosed
and reinforced global health insecurities due in large part to
market-driven policies and [neoliberal practices]{.mark}; the
combination of societal inequalities, weakened response capacity by
marketized health systems and biomedicine-oriented global health
governance have [created **vectors of vulnerability**]{.mark}
\[35\].]{.underline} The health security paradigm has its roots in
concepts of risk mitigation and adaptation \[3\]. The Ebola outbreak in
Western Africa in 2014--2015 has been important for the paradigm shift
in global health policy. Since then, experts and politicians have been
discussing the establishment of heath emergency funds, the formation of
rapid reaction medical forces ('white helmets'), as well as the creation
of robust care structures and resilient health systems \[36\]. The 2015
Johannesburg Summit on China-Africa Cooperation identified Public Health
as one of the cornerstones for foreign policy action in the China-Africa
cooperation \[37\]. During their 2017 Berlin meeting the health
ministers of the G20 countries simulated the necessary measures for
combating future pandemics \[38\]. [However, the prevailing [reasoning
does not]{.mark} aim to [address]{.mark} the **[structural
causes]{.mark}** of potential threats]{.underline} \[39\], but serves as
"a form of immunization to have societies and systems become more
resilient in dealing with future risks" \[40\]. In this light, one
should also analyse the process for establishing an international
pandemic treaty, under WHO auspices, as a global normative framework for
the preparedness and response to future pandemics \[41\]. This pandemic
agreement, which at the time of writing is under negotiation by WHO
member states, deserves critical scrutiny as its focus ought to be on
people's health, not merely national security. Creating genuine global
health solidarity focused on human security requires a new pandemic
agreement that mandates the sharing of technologies, scientific
capacities and finance in future pandemics \[42\]. Wenham and colleagues
argue that the key tension of the pandemic treaty is rooted in globalist
ideals of what the perfect pandemic governance should look like, yet
"that it seems to have little regard for the realities of the statist,
securitized landscape that exists for responding to pandemic threats...
Even something as big as a major global pandemic is not sufficient to
get governments to think beyond national interests" \[43\]. Blurred
lines between hard and soft security practices To a large extent, health
security is viewed as a mainly biomedical challenge determined by
biological dysfunctions and disturbances of the homeostatic state of the
body. The guiding concepts for infectious disease control are based on
the extended bacteriological model developed towards the end of the
nineteenth century by the German physician and microbiologist Robert
Koch, who discovered the specific causative cell-agents called bacteria,
which cause fatal infectious diseases such as anthrax, tuberculosis, and
cholera. Until today, despite all knowledge and empirical evidence about
the enormous importance of non-biological influences on disease and
health \[44\], the perception of health threats and the shape of health
security are still dominated by a biomedical scientific approach derived
from Koch's "cellular pathology" \[45\]. Natural science medicine is
considered to have made an important contribution to the increase in
global life expectancy---even though social and environmental advances
and the general improvement of living conditions worldwide have
contributed to this in the first place---and is therefore considered to
be a historically successful framework model for the prevention and
treatment of infectious diseases \[46\]. Moreover, the biomedical
understanding of health problems and the resulting importance of
healthcare provision are plausible and relatively easy to explain and
understandable for the general public \[47, 48\]. Notwithstanding this
widespread perception, [the biomedical [concept]{.mark} is [not
conducive to]{.mark} adequately [address]{.mark} the [underlying
conditions]{.mark} between public health status and disease
outcomes]{.underline}. Already in the context of clinical conditions,
biomedicine faces challenges vis-à-vis treating mental health problems
or chronic degenerative diseases and their multifactorial causes that
are prevalent worldwide today. Biochemical causal chains, organic
defects or epigenetic variables and "markers" cannot be verified with
certainty for numerous physical diseases and dysfunctions. Fundamental
questions about the validity and relevance of the scientific biomedical
paradigm therefore remain warranted \[49\]. This paradigm systematically
neglects the consideration of non-medical variables and thus the social
and ecological determination of health \[50\]. [The dominant perception
of [health security]{.mark} as a defence against acute health threats
openly [reflected]{.mark} [in]{.mark} high-level [political statements
about]{.mark} the "**[war on COVID-19]{.mark}**"]{.underline} \[51\], is
consistent with the (historical) involvement of defence forces in
epidemic disease control \[52\]. In many countries, the military
provided active and highly visible logistical support to the health
sector in COVID-19 vaccination campaigns \[53\]. A few years ago, at the
height of the Ebola crisis, ["Médecins sans Frontières", which otherwise
rejects any proximity to the armed forces]{.underline} \[54\], [demanded
support from soldiers in controlling the epidemic and related social
unrest]{.underline} \[55\]. Due to the increasing number and brutality
of protracted armed conflicts and the growing need for humanitarian
assistance, even NGO aid is increasingly becoming securitised with many
organizations having to employ security personnel \[56\]. Ebola made it
onto the agenda of the UN Security Council, and for the first time in
the history of the UN, a mission to control a disease was established in
the form of the "UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response" \[57\]. While
militarization is not the same as the securitization of health \[58\],
the involvement of (armed) defence forces has contributed to the shaping
of the global health security discourse. [The **[military
backing]{.mark}** of state responses to national health threats [has
enforced]{.mark} the [security narrative]{.mark} and thereby mobilised
patriotic emotions of the general public which [contradict]{.mark} the
universality and shared responsibility required to foster [global public

#### Climate threat construction only serves as a surface justification for neocolonialist intervention -- it's not a existential disaster but an attempt to [save face]{.underline}.

In 2021, the [[N]{.mark}ational [I]{.mark}ntelligence [C]{.mark}ouncil
[published a report]{.mark}, "Climate Change and International Responses
Increasing Challenges to US National Security Through 2040" that
[outlined]{.mark} the geopolitical [risks of]{.mark} the [climate
crisis]{.mark} (NIC)]{.underline}. The Intelligence Estimate, a document
designed to serve as an authoritative [security assessment for the U.S.
government, "identified 11 countries and two regions of great concern
from the threat of climate change.]{.underline} These countries of
concern are highly vulnerable to the physical effects and lack the
capacity to adapt, suggesting that building resilience to climate change
in these countries would be especially helpful in mitigating future
risks to US interests \[emphasis added\]" (11). The report also warned
that climate change "increase\[s\] the risk of instability in countries
in Central Africa and small island states in the Pacific" (11, see
Figure 1). \[graph omitted\] Figure 1. National Intelligence Estimate.
"Climate Change in Select Highly Vulnerable Countries of Concern"
[Without exception, the [countries identified]{.mark} are postcolonial
nations or [have histories of]{.mark} either covert or overt **[U.S.
intervention]{.mark}**, as is the case with Haiti]{.underline} (Alcenat
2021), [Iraq]{.underline} (Evans 2003), [and Nicaragua]{.underline}
(Sola 2005). The [[report's assertion]{.mark} that these nations and
regions are "highly vulnerable to the physical effects of climate
change" [naturalizes]{.mark} the **[slow violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Nixon 2011) [[and **neocolonial policies**]{.mark} that have
contributed to their disproportionate exposure to the effects of global
warming, including **[imperial legacies]{.mark}** that have
[thwart]{.mark}ed their [ability to adapt]{.mark} to [and
recover]{.mark} from climate shocks. Further, the [vulnerability]{.mark}
of the identified nations and regions is [framed as a future-oriented
threat]{.mark} that should be protected against with U.S. support for
resilience planning, an assertion that [invites]{.mark} the indefinite
possibility of [continued]{.mark} or expanded humanitarian and [military
intervention in the name of climate]{.mark} resiliency.]{.underline} The
intellectual 41 [production and [projection of climate threats]{.mark}
in the Global South [serves as]{.mark} the [grounds for]{.mark}
**anticipatory [imperial governance]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the ongoing
[construction of neocolonial futures]{.mark} through policies and
investments that stabilize]{.underline}, in the present, [U.S. military
power]{.underline} and global presence for the foreseeable,
climate-altered future. The [importance of [resilience]{.mark} to
[protecting "American interests"]{.mark} is [a **recurring
theme**]{.mark} in official U.S. national security
documents,]{.underline} such as the NIE. As the summary to the FY2023
DoD climate security budget asserts, climate change "exacerbat\[es\]
risk and creat\[es\] new challenges to U.S. interests around the world"
(2022). As Preston demonstrates, central to the genesis of the
contemporary doctrine of national security was President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's novel integration of American ideology, including its
interest in spreading capitalism, into the traditional concerns of
territorial sovereignty (2014). The [relationship between U.S. national
security doctrine and spreading capitalism became even more explicit
during the Cold War, when "the purpose of military power shifted
decisively away from the relatively well-defined goals of imperial
expansion and inter-imperialist rivalry to the open-ended objective of
policing the world in the interests of (US) capital]{.underline}"
(Meiksins Wood, p. 129). In the mind of military planners, vulnerable
and fragile states, as Meiksins Wood writes, "endanger the stable and
predictable environment that capital needs" (156). [[Embedded in]{.mark}
DoD geopolitical [assessments of climate risk]{.mark}s [are]{.mark} the
[racialized discourses]{.mark} of state fragility, conflict, and
migration, all of which pose a threat to the stability of the global
economy, with its **racialized [extraction ]{.mark}**[of value from
exploited labor and]{.mark} natural [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
order to protect the interests of American capital and extractive
industries, to whom the U.S. military offers protection (Gaffney 2018),
[it is in the interest of national security planners to manage regions
rich with resources]{.underline}---the imperial discourses of climate
conflict and state fragility underwrite anticipatory colonial governance
of 42 these regions, though framed primarily as a beneficent and
"trust-building" provision of resilience training and support.

#### Climate securitization increases environmental degradation -- it creates a militarized response that guarantees an increase in resource consumption

Yet there are multiple problems in this gendered "climate security"
framing, as well as [dangers with the overall securitization of the
climate crisis]{.underline}. First, it [centers]{.underline} a vision of
the world from [the perspective of Northern elites]{.underline}, which
[locates climate change threats as coming from "out
there]{.underline}"---from its victims, from outsiders, [from people in
Global South countries]{.underline} where the violence that threatens
"stability" will supposedly occur, and from where displaced people will
supposedly be trying to flee[---instead of correctly locating the
threats to the planet as coming from the Global North countries,
militaries, and corporations that are actually]{.underline} the most
[responsible]{.underline} for it. Second, it is a framing that [leads to
a militarized response, which justifies increases in budgets of military
and other "security" institutions, capturing the resources we need to
solve the climate and wider ecological crises]{.underline}. It further
[compounds the problem by fostering and legitimating the expansion of
military training and operations---thereby increasing their vast use of
fossil fuels and other forms of environmental degradation---making the
climate and eco-crises worse,]{.underline} not better. Third, it sets up
[preservation of the status quo as the goal]{.underline}, whereas
[dealing with the climate crisis requires massive changes to the status
quo.]{.underline} This is especially so if the countries that are least
responsible for carbon emissions, and where those most affected live,
are ever going to get access to the resources they need to respond.
Fourth, and perhaps the most devastating, is that, [if our intention is
to head off the worst of climate change and even try to reverse it,
framing the climate crisis as a security crisis completely misdirects
our attention]{.underline}. The [climate crisis is not a crisis of
security; it is a crisis of extractivist capitalism]{.underline}, an
economic system that [incentivizes the exploitation of natural
resources]{.underline} as if they were unlimited and "externalizes" the
environmental costs of production---[from pollution to the release of
greenhouse gases.]{.underline} Through its dependence on fossil fuels
for cheap energy and industrial agriculture that overexploits soil and
water supplies, [extractivist capitalism champions growth at all costs,
including the destruction of the environment.]{.underline} Its
neoliberal insistence on "liberating" markets and denouncing regulation
and collective action has made it impossible to take the actions needed
to halt climate breakdown.

#### The 1AC [disrupts]{.underline} desecuritized Arctic cooperation by narratively connecting Arctic climate change to the fate of the planet.

Relations, Aalborg University (Theresa, "Disrupting 'Arctic
Exceptionalism'? A Qualitative Discourse Analysis of the Securitization
of Climate Change in the EU's Arctic Policy,"

dml)

Firstly, [the macrosecuritization of climate change]{.underline} can be
considered what Buzan & Wæver (2009:261) call a physical threat
universalism that [relates to the construction of a physical threat as a
**global danger**]{.underline}. [While this move has the]{.underline}
"[physical **fate of humankind**]{.underline}" (ibid:261) [as the
referent object]{.underline}, [it utilizes the physical changes that the
**Arctic** experiences due to climate change to **exemplify** the
dangers that arise]{.underline}. [The **securitizing move**]{.underline}
therefore inevitably also [contains a securitization of climate change
in the Arctic]{.underline}, depicting a physical threat, which can be
observed. The securitization of a threat depends on [its **acceptance**
by the audience]{.underline}, which [is **required** to establish
**exceptional measures**]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} the [Arctic
states **accept** the necessity of exceptional measures to combat
climate change]{.underline}, [the issue is **moved** from the stage
of]{.underline} politicization and its handling within [**normal
politics** to an **exceptional** space]{.underline}. [This equals a move
**away** from the state of **desecuritization** that is the
**foundation** for]{.underline} the concept of [Arctic
exceptionalism]{.underline}. Looking at the EU's Arctic policy, the
Arctic states have rejected such an attempt as part of the push for
"enhanced governance" (Damanaki 2011c:2f; European Commission 2008a:9f).

Secondly, [the]{.underline} EU's [securitizing move serves as a source
of insecurity **even if** the securitization of climate change is **not
accepted**]{.underline}, [as it creates **unpredictability** by
**deviating** from the rules that are established within the social
arrangement in the Arctic]{.underline}. The integration of both the EU's
Climate Change Discourse and the concept of Arctic Exceptionalism into
the relational ontological security framework is depicted in figure 7.

[Arctic Exceptionalism as a trust system traces back to the]{.underline}
cross-sectoral [**desecuritization** of Arctic relations that became
**institutionalized** in the Arctic Council]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} resulting [**silencing** of security matters and
**compartmentalization** of Arctic politics]{.underline} stand as
routines within the social arrangement that [result in **stability** and
**predictability** and enable **peaceful cooperation**]{.underline}. The
EU's [climate change discourse has the potential to
**threaten**]{.underline} Arctic Exceptionalism, which is built upon
[these routines]{.underline}, and creates unpredictability. In reaction
to this, Arctic states have three options on how to react, namely
refereeing, performative deference, and obstructive resistance. The 2008
initiative to enhance governance in the Arctic was resisted and the EU
referred to the upkeep of state sovereignty (Damanaki 2011c:2f; European
Commission 2008a:9f), thus preserving social arrangement and the
elements of Arctic exceptionalism.

### Extinction Focus

#### The 1AC's "extinction" rhetoric serves as a justification for imperialist overstretch to account for its loss of global hegemony.

Stengel (2019) noted that the [process of securitization consists of the
"rear- ticulation" of an object within an existing security order from a
mere challenge into an existential threat or the "articulation" of a new
security order which transforms preexisting discourses and redefines
what constitutes existential threats]{.underline}. However,
[**securitizing actors**]{.underline} often [engage in both
simultaneously: **redefining objects as threats, in terms of how they
affect or undermine the current security order, but also using the
now-threatening object as the basis for articulating a new security
discourse in order to meet this threat**]{.underline} (Sjöstedt 2007).
Although [securitization scholars widely require a threat to be framed
as "exis- tential"]{.underline} [to be the object of a securitizing
move, the definition of what constitu- tes this is more elusive and
need-not be framed as ending one's physical existence]{.underline}.
Certainly, there was a securitization process following 9/11 in regard
to terrorism, but terrorists never actually threatened the physical
survival of the United States. Instead, [one]{.underline} could -- and,
according to Floyd (2016) should -- adopt a more flexible definition of
"existential" and still operate with the confines of the securitization
framework. For example, beyond its nuclear weapons, the United States
depicted the Soviet Union as an existential threat in large part because
it challenged American national identity and ideology, as well as the
world order Washington sought to create. [Even if the framing of a
particular threat as existential is seen by others as purely subjective
or exaggerated, the securitizing move has still occurred and it is
possible to utilize this to explore the "ideologies and cultural
characteristics" that give rise to these articulations]{.underline}
(Michael 2009, 688). From this, [we can garner a deeper under- standing
of a state's geopolitical culture.]{.underline} The [recent emergence of
Russia and China as the primary threats to the United States is
reflective of how American geopolitical culture defines existential
threat]{.underline}. [After the Cold War, the identity and ideology of
**America as the "leader of the free world**" intensified
greatly]{.underline} (Clarke and Ricketts 2017). In the draft Defense
Planning Guidance of 1992, the [primary objective of protecting the
homeland]{.underline} was [closely associated with the need to
"**establish and protect a new order**]{.underline}**,"** "[discourage
\[countries\] from challenging our leadership or seeking to overturn the
established political and economic order,]{.underline}" and "[maintain
mechanisms . . . to deter aggressors from aspiring to a larger or global
role]{.underline}" ("Defense Planning" 1992, 44). This [formulation
defined]{.underline} the central tenets of American geopolitical culture
in terms of Washington's **[need to preserve its global preeminence and
the international status quo]{.underline}**. However, according to the
current narrative, this world order is deteriorating. Consequently,
[American officials]{.underline} are now [engaged in an overt
securitization process]{.underline} in which the [rise of these powers
has been rearticulated so that they now constitute existential
threats]{.underline}, not to the homeland per se,2 but [to an
American-dominated, liberal-democratic world order.]{.underline} This
rearticulation has also led to the articulation of a new international
security order as one beset by authoritarian great powers which the
United States must actively resist. As seen below, this had led to the
revival of the key Cold War tropes of revisionism, threats to
liberal-democracy, and spheres of influence. In the present case, Russia
and China seek to overturn unipolarity and establish multipolarity,
something which these states openly advocate. The authoritarian nature
of these political systems has also restored the democracy-autocracy
binary in which the democratic world, led by the U.S., must now confront
serious non-democratic threats. This securitization process is
furthermore strongly rooted in geography in that both states are seen as
seeking regional dominance. Not only do these spheres of influence
undermine America's global status by carving out regions in which it
cannot operate freely, but they can be used as jumping-off points from
which to ultimately challenge the United States globally. Thus, [by
examining the securitization of Russia and China]{.underline}, it is
[possible to attain a clearer understanding of how this change has
occurred]{.underline} [and what this means for American geopolitical
culture]{.underline} and grand strategy moving forward.3 It does this in
three ways. First, there should be little doubt that American
geopolitical culture is directly tied to the preservation of primacy, a
unipolar international system, and the liberal-democratic world order.
Although American primacy and unipolarity, on the one hand, and the
liberal- democratic world order, on the other, could be seen as
incompatible, given that the latter rests upon an international legal
system which is often ignored by the former (Swazo 2004), U.S.
geopolitical culture as fused these two impera- tives under the banner
of Pax Americana. President Barack Obama was some- times seen as moving
away from this, but he nonetheless maintained a foreign policy of
preserving it, even if in a less overt and "exceptionalist" fashion. And
despite his "America First", "restrainer", and "retrenchment" rhetoric,
President Donald [Trump placed American primacy at the center of his
foreign policy strategy]{.underline} and America's self-identification,
as evidenced by the 2017 National Security Strategy and 2018 National
Defense Strategy (Stokes 2018). Even if Trump's particular brand of
militarism is not in service of liberal-democracy and internationalism,
it is certainly committed to this status (Harris 2018). Second, the data
show that American officials believe that this [challenge arose
primarily from the internal processes found within Russia/China
themselves and is the result of these countries' individual policy
choices, fueled by their respective geopolitical identities, rather than
from their growing capabilities or broader structural
shifts.]{.underline} Although material factors were certainly reflected
in this testimony, it is these states' decision to take action to assert
themselves as great powers which has driven this recent
rearticulation/articulation. Thus, this case indicates that the
[relative balance of power between states is likely less important for
precipitating a securitization move than perceived
aggressiveness.]{.underline} Finally, these narratives reveal a lack of
self-reflection on Washington's part. By placing this challenge firmly
on Russia/China themselves, U.S. policymakers have absolved American
foreign policy of any culpability in this process. From their testimony,
there is little sense that [**America has entered a period of imperial
over- stretch** driven by the strategic choices made by America's
post-Cold War adminis- trations or that **Russia/China are acting
defensively** in response to what they see as the threatening
consequences of a U.S.-dominated international system.]{.underline} It
is possi- ble that this understanding is occurring below the surface,
but the [geopolitical culture advanced by the official policy appears to
be that the preservation of American primacy is the answer, regardless
of how **self-defeating** it might be.]{.underline}

### Extractivism

#### The aff designates the Arctic as a 'sacrifice zone' for green extractivism -- resulting in epistemic and day-to-day violence.

**Martinez-Alier et al. 24** (Joan Martinez-Alier is an Emeritus
Professor of Economics and Economic History at the Autonomous University
of Barcelona, Markus Kröger is a Docent and Professor in Development
Studies at University of Helsinki) Hanaček, K., Kroger, M. &
Martinez-Alier, J., (2024) "Green and climate colonialities: Evidence
from Arctic extractivisms", Journal of Political Ecology 31(1),
538--566. doi: <https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.5512>\] //KH

[The Arctic region is home to]{.underline} 4 million people, including
[over one million members of more than forty Indigenous
groups]{.underline} (The Arctic Council, 2015). [Half of the population
are reindeer herders, who have their own cultures, languages, and
lifeways]{.underline} (Bladow, 2019; Kuokkanen, 2023). The [Arctic
contains large territories with past and present unequal global
relations that are colonial]{.underline} in character. Several [Arctic
regions have been turned into key resource frontier sites
for]{.underline} the [extractive]{.underline} fossil fuel, metal mining,
energy and forestry [economies supported by key global North
states]{.underline}, such as Norway, Sweden, the United States, Canada,
Finland, Denmark, and the Russian Federation (Bennett, 2016; Keil,
2014). These [Arctic extractivist frontiers have been resisted by local
peoples, often Indigenous]{.underline} (Hanaček et al., 2022; Nygren et
al., 2022). Resistance arises against fossil fuels, but there are also
movements opposing green or low-carbon energy projects (Lassila, 2018;
Össbo, 2023). The [Arctic]{.underline} is especially affected by the
cascading impacts of the climate catastrophe, with its climate [warming
four times faster in comparison to other regions]{.underline} (Herrmann,
2015; IPCC, 2019). The climate crisis and its purported solutions
currently play an increasing role in shaping Arctic life. Climate change
is creating a discourse and actions leading to the expansion of green
extractivism across the region. While risks are increasing, [the Arctic
is paradoxically perceived by many domestic and transnational companies
as a central point for so-called new green energy solutions and
mining]{.underline} of transition minerals (Duxbury, 2021; Hanaček et
al., 2022; Len, 2021). For example, western Greenland, where coastal
glaciers have been melting, has been a target of new mining ventures
seeking to offer minerals for the electrification of energy
(Gronholt-Pedersen, 2022). [While the climate crisis has been caused
mostly by colonial actions and extractivist frontier expansion by the
elites and corporations of the core areas of the capitalist
world-ecology]{.underline} (Moore, 2016), [the Arctic suffers
excessively, and is furthermore **cast as a \"sacrifice zone\"** for
extracting minerals and energy for supposed climate change
solutions]{.underline} (Össbo, 2023). The crisis of the capitalist
world-ecology, meaning a rush to dwindling natural resources, is fueling
a desire to expand extractivist activities in the Arctic, [creating a
complex and perilous feedback loop, as Arctic extractivism can directly
drive the breaching of global climate tipping points]{.underline}
(Kröger, 2023). For example, flaring and increased atmospheric soot and
dust from mining cause quicker melting and make ice sheets less
reflective. An extractive push has increased in some parts of the region
alongside worsening socio-climatic crises (Kröger, 2016a, 2018). The
Arctic remains a prime target for extractivism, notably for obtaining
the commodities to produce \"green\" or low-carbon infrastructures
instrumental in climate change mitigation policies (Kuokkanen, 2023).
Moreover, [the attack on Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, and the
subsequent rush for alternative energy and raw material
sources]{.underline} especially in the European Union, [has led to major
new expansion pushes]{.underline}, also [in the Arctic]{.underline}
(Kopra & Wall, 2022). The sanctions against Russia, and the [worsening
climatic-ecological conditions for extraction due to collapsing
permafrost]{.underline} for example, [have brought
difficulties]{.underline} for the sector in some parts of Arctic Russia
(Kröger, 2023). [Visible resource conflicts and resistance movements are
thus just the tip of the iceberg]{.underline} when it comes to local
grievances due to environmental, cultural, and livelihood losses
experienced by many Arctic peoples (Heininen et al., 2022). This is a
topic that can be explored more deeply through the intertwined concepts
of extractivism and colonialism, which examine the structural,
historical level where [extractivist hegemonies have been created for
the Arctic. Extractivism describes those activities that violently
remove or extract large quantities of natural resources, causing major
social and ecological damage]{.underline} (Acosta, 2011). The type,
character and degree of extractivism vary depending on the sector, style
of extraction, and context (Kröger, 2022). According to Gudynas (2021),
[extractivisms]{.underline} -- in the plural, as there are many forms,
such as mining, fossil fuels, commercial agriculture and forestry --
[entail breaking down existing local economies and their ecological
relationships, with extracted products profiting national or
international business classes or government]{.underline}s.
[Extractivisms]{.underline}, however, are not limited to biophysical
overexploitation and transformation of the environment (Acosta, 2011;
Kröger et al., 2021; Svampa, 2019). They [are based on onto-epistemic
violence against Indigenous ways of relating to]{.underline} the Mother
[Earth]{.underline} (de la Cadena & Blaser, 2018). For example,
[replacing the latter with modernist assumptions and ideas where nature
is seen as external and available, \"free\" of people or any constraints
to exploit]{.underline} and appropriate in whatever manner, as fast as
wanted. Therefore, Durante et al. (2021: 20) refer to extractivisms as
\"a particular way of thinking and the properties and practices
organized towards the goal of maximizing benefit through extraction,
which [brings in its wake violence and destruction.\"]{.underline} Such
forms of colonialism and extractivism, when part of capitalism, do not
only mean imposing domination from foreign countries and corporations.
[Colonialism can also be imposed and continuously sustained internally
within a nation state]{.underline} (Casanova, 1965; Churchill & LaDuke,
1992; Maldonado-Torres, 2016). [Arctic extractivisms exist with several
forms of colonial relations]{.underline} (Hanaček et al., 2022). The
concept of climate colonialism refers to how glaciers melting, sea
levels rising, and storms negatively affect those who have least
contributed to the climate crisis, such as Indigenous peoples, ethnic
minorities, and the impoverished (Landrum & Holland, 2020; Naykanchina,
2012). [Systems supporting colonialisms, such as]{.underline}
patriarchy, racism, Eurocentrism, and [extractivism not only contribute
to such conditions, but also further impose their own climate change
perspectives and \"solutions\"]{.underline} (Sheller, 2023). [Climate
change is]{.underline} in part [a result of colonial
extractivism]{.underline}, and a greater discussion of this connection
in the literature has long been necessary (Bhambra & Newell, 2023;
Moore, 2016). For instance, [projected green solutions and global
climate interventions reproduce extractive understandings and dominant
discourses]{.underline}, including [viewing climate as merely a
biophysical problem to be remedied with technologies,
finance]{.underline}, and better economic modelling (DeBoom, 2022;
Sultana, 2022). [Apolitical approaches, with little to no acknowledgment
of global colonial histories,]{.underline} also [include adaptation,
vulnerability, and mitigation strategies that continue to displace
historically impoverished peoples from their land, disrupting plural
ways of life and knowledge]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012). According to
Gelderloos (2022) and Osborne & Carlson (2023), industrial expansion and
present forms of pollution are intrinsically linked to the colonial
state. The [current climate crisis is the result of a state-corporate
nexus]{.underline} responsible for atmospheric change. However, the
mainstream crisis solution to this nexus is based on a carbon reduction
2030 goal, which is inherently linked to existing fossil fuel and green
extractivist initiatives (ibid). Put simply, [both green extractivism
and the climate crisis perpetuate logics of colonialism and imperialism
through negative socio-environmental impacts, discursive (green)
ignorance, climate crisis denial, and attempts to create domination and
hegemony by extractivist forces]{.underline} -- [all]{.underline} these
actions [further driving the climate catastrophe]{.underline} (DeBoom,
2022; Dunlap & Riquito, 2023; Sultana, 2022; Voskoboynik & Andreucci,
2022). The term \"[necrocene]{.underline},\" or [the new era of death
and extinction on Earth, refers to such denial and silencing of
historical and present struggles against socio-ecological
breakdown]{.underline} (Batalla, 2020; Clark, 2021; Mbembe, 2019).
Therefore, the poly-crisis including climatic breakdowns should be seen
primarily as a political state and a colonial condition (Sheller, 2023).
Combined, green extractivism and climate crises form part of ongoing
colonialities. There is however resistance to extractivisms, challenging
their long-lasting systemic and environmental oppression (Acosta, 2011;
Escobar, 2011; Kröger, 2020; Scheidel et al., 2020; Svampa, 2016;
Willow, 2016). Environmental conflicts exist around the appropriation of
nature through efforts to preserve and protect ways of relating to
nature (Jerez et al., 2021). Connecting climate change and green
extractivism with acts of colonialism allows us to see how such
[constant invasion of territory, exploitation, and industrial
infrastructure in the name of saving the planet fit into the larger
picture of oppression]{.underline} (Bhambra & Newell, 2023). [The Arctic
is a colonized territory.]{.underline} It has been [historically
subjected to extractivism and]{.underline} additionally, it has been
[colonized by climate change]{.underline} (Fjellheim, 2023; Kuokkanen,
2023; Össbo, 2023; Stuhl, 2016). Most recently, \"green\" developments
elicit additional opposition (Bruna, 2022; Willow, 2016). Bladow (2019)
shows that in Northern Sweden, for example, with various kinds of
protest going on including artistic expression, activists create global
networks and links in their protests against extractivism, climate
change, and other challenges to Sámi self-determination. Our article
shows how [green extractivisms and climate colonialisms are two sides of
the same coin]{.underline} by analyzing sixteen socio-environmental
conflicts across the Arctic, identified in the Global Atlas of
Environmental Justice (ejatlas.org) (Hanaček et al., 2022; Scheidel et
al., 2020; Temper et al., 2015) and through a literature review. The
article contributes to the political ecology of green transition by
conceptualizing these processes as extractive, with climate colonialisms
continuously affecting the region and its people.

#### Their IR ignores Ecological Distribution Conflicts -- the tension between different states classification of the hierarchy of nature and what life is considered 'important'.

A third [core feature of extractivism is that it is not limited to
processes of appropriation that lead to irreparable socioecological
harm, but]{.underline} also relates to the broader and [entwined
political-economic and ideational systems that enable these
processes]{.underline}. We thus agree with Grosfoguel (2016) that
[extractivism has important epistemological and ontological
dimensions]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} what Mario Blaser
(2013, 15) calls \"[political ontology.]{.underline}\" This explores how
worldviews and belief systems (e.g., ontologies) are normalized,
[critically examining how habitats and \'resources\' are understood as
inert materials to be managed, used and exploited to the benefit of
putative civilized and modern societies]{.underline} (De la Cadena &
Blaser 2018). [Extractive, or green extractive, hegemony thus entails an
\"extractive gaze,\"]{.underline} as Macarena Gómez-Barris (2017, 4-5)
argues, [that is used to legitimize extraction by rendering certain
beings, existences and lives of habitats invisible]{.underline} (Kröger,
2022; Hokkanen, 2024), meanwhile t[eaching people to think
a]{.underline}nd see [like an extractivist state or
corporation]{.underline} (see Esteva, 2009; Zaragocin & Caretta, 2021;
Gelderloos, 2023). [Extractivism]{.underline}, whether \'green,\'
\'black\' or \'gray\' [begins with objectifying and denying the lifeways
of mountains, rivers, trees, plants, soils and people.]{.underline} As
Chagnon and colleagues argue, \"[extractivism is premised on the
onto-epistemological devaluing of most of the web of life]{.underline}\"
(2022, 777). For us, then, [extractivism can be described as a specific
socioeconomic pattern]{.underline} (or structure of structures) [and way
of]{.underline} seeing and [constituting the world]{.underline} (Chagnon
et al., 2022), [leading to the organization of nature based
on]{.underline} a [classification]{.underline} system [that creates a
hierarchy between humans (and non-humans) that objectifies \'nature\'
and denies \'the sacred]{.underline}\' (see Benally, 2023). This
worldview, [categorical imposition and ideology is normalized,
institutionally reproduced and]{.underline}, thus, [becomes
hegemonic]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} entwined
socioeconomic/[political-ontological pattern]{.underline} or system [is
characterized by the appropriation of resources and existences and
non-reciprocal relations with the planet]{.underline}, which are
ultimately [grounded in the objectification of rivers, trees, mountains,
plants, soils and bodies. This system inscribes the expansion of
capitalist techno/industrial production and economic growth as
\'progress\' regardless of the deleterious social/cultural/knowledge
effects and the ecological and climatic devastations it
entails]{.underline}. When, where and [why, then, is this pattern
labeled \'green?\' In]{.underline} order to better understand what green
extractivism is, how the academic debate about it has evolved, and how
that debate builds on existing discussions in political ecology and
cognate fields, we first examine how green extractivism relates to the
notions of ecological distribution conflicts and green grabbing. We
posit that [green extractivism always entails Ecological Distribution
Conflicts (EDCs) and green grabbing,]{.underline} although it is not
limited to it. EDCs have been a central focus of political ecology. Joan
MartínezAlier (2002, 54), and later, in partial agreement, Arturo
Escobar (2008, 6), have even defined [political ecology as \"the study
of ecological distribution conflicts.\"]{.underline} Arnim Scheidel and
colleagues (2018, 587) [conceptualize EDCs as \"social conflicts arising
over the unequal distribution of environmental benefits,]{.underline}
such as access to natural resources, fertile land, or ecosystem services
\[sic\], [as well as over unequal and unsustainable allocations of
environmental burdens,]{.underline} such as pollution or waste.\" [This
leads to a research focus on \"institutions of societies, which govern
modes of appropriation, distribution and disposal of materials and
energy]{.underline}\" (Scheidel et al. 2018, 587; emphasis added). EDCs
research often also examines center-periphery exchange dynamics
undergirding asymmetrical distributions (Zografos & Martínez-Alier,
2009; Scheidel et al. 2018), akin to a dependency theory of the local.
[EDCs was the first theoretical framework to]{.underline} raise critical
concern over wind energy development (Zografos & Martínez-Alier, 2009)
and to system[atically expose the harms behind so-called \'green\',
\'clean\', and lower-carbon infrastructure projects]{.underline} (Avila
2017, 2018; Menton et al. 2020; Temper et al. 2020; Batel & Küpers
2022). As such[, it has opened up space for identifying and
understanding processes of green extractivism.]{.underline}

#### The aff is indirect green extractivism---concealing an enchantment with tech and the realities of violence in the supply chain.

<https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.6131>\] //KH

[Indirect green extractivism refers to all that is necessary to produce
direct green extractivism]{.underline}. It thus [scrutinizes the
factories and equipment that enable mining]{.underline}---or mining
automation---[for so-called \'green\' or \'transition\'
materials]{.underline}, but also [the entire supply systems related to
mining, mineral processing, manufacturing and
transportation]{.underline}. In addition, [it links lower-carbon
infrastructure and energy production]{.underline} sites [to]{.underline}
multiple places where [land]{.underline} is [occupied by
mines]{.underline}, chemical facilities, factories, ports and centers of
technological automation, including the [labor issues]{.underline},
[human rights violation]{.underline}s ([and]{.underline} potentially
[political terror]{.underline}) that are linked to them. The supply
function is what dubs these forms of extractivism \'indirect\'---because
production processes are indirectly linked to the final product and the
operation of wind turbines, solar panels, \'smart\' digitalization
schemes and so on. [Indirect green extractivism]{.underline} thus
[refers to the supply-webs]{.underline}, or \"supplyplaces\" [that are
ignored, forgotten and made invisible by lower-carbon infrastructure
marketing]{.underline} (see Ulloa, 2023, this Section), [policy decrees
and general enchantment with large-scale and innovative technologies.
Indirect green extractivism also relates to the extractive realities
behind military and police equipment used to protect mines, intervene in
labor disputes, break strikes]{.underline} and much more. These examples
again demonstrate the [fundamental connection between different
extractivism(s) and how green extractivism quickly becomes \'black,\'
\'brown,\' and \'gray]{.underline}.\' The concept of indirect green
extractivism, moreover, seeks to reveal the connections between
so-called \'green\' and conventional industrial sectors to more
accurately [expose the extractivist realities underlying claims to
\'greenness\' and \'cleanness]{.underline}.\'

#### The aff links -- no matter where they are located on the supply-web of the global economy, they're deeply intertwined with extractivism.

Researching [extractivism extends to the subsoils]{.underline}
(Hokkanen, 2024), the [deep sea]{.underline} (Childs, 2022) and [outer
space]{.underline} (Klinger, 2017), as well as to \"[solar]{.underline}
extractivism\" (Hu, 2023) \"[wind]{.underline} extractivism\" (Dunlap &
Marin, 2022, 7), [recycling lower-carbon tech]{.underline}nologies
(Sovacool et al., 2020), and [hydrological]{.underline} extractivism
(Kelly, 2021; Post, 2022), which relates to [constructing water
desalination plants to dissuade]{.underline} conflict and justify
extractivism (Dunlap, 2019b; Jerez et al., 2021). It also pertains to
[\'green\' hydrogen]{.underline} (Müller et al., 2022; Vezzoni, 2024);
the \"[renewable energy-extraction nexus]{.underline}\" of [battery
storage]{.underline} technologies (Archer & Calvão, 2024, 6); \"[green
data extractivism]{.underline}\" complexes (Bresnihan & Brodie, 2021;
Brodie, 2024, 6); and [atmospheric geoengineering]{.underline} (Stephens
et al., 2023). So-called gree[n extractivism depends on multi-layered
and networked extractivisms]{.underline}, meanwhile [taking on new
dimensions and literal depths and heights]{.underline}. For these
reasons, we argue that [the initial extractivisms that underlie the
supply-web]{.underline}s (Heikkinen, 2024, this Section), or
supply-places, 7 [that provide the material for
extraction]{.underline}---for instance, [mining equipment,
chemicals]{.underline} (for leaching ores or pesticides), [warehouses
and machines for manufacturing]{.underline}---[deserve greater
recognition]{.underline} within extractivism debates. [Researching
supply-webs indicates the methodological relevance of \"political
industrial ecology]{.underline}\" (Newell et al., 2017), which applies
mixed-methods to research industries. [This indicates the challenge of
where and how we can locate extractivism: where does it start and where
does it end?]{.underline}

### AT: Green Transition

#### The affs claim of a 'green transition' is false -- it's colonial extraction and violence dressed up in green rhetoric.

**Martinez-Alier et al. 24** (Joan Martinez-Alier is an Emeritus
Professor of Economics and Economic History at the Autonomous University
of Barcelona, Markus Kröger is a Docent and Professor in Development
Studies at University of Helsinki) Hanaček, K., Kroger, M. &
Martinez-Alier, J., (2024) "Green and climate colonialities: Evidence
from Arctic extractivisms", Journal of Political Ecology 31(1),
538--566. doi: <https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.5512>\] //KH

[Policymakers]{.underline}, mainly in the Global North, [have been
implementing new green growth strategies]{.underline} or Green New
Deals. The narrative of sustainability and development behind these
policies relies on ecological modernization ideology, whose [proponents
do not question growth]{.underline} (Wilson, 2013). According to them,
these tactics promise more sustainable industrialization and downscaling
of critical emissions (Chuffart et al., 2021; Dunlap & Riquito, 2023;
Zografos, 2022; Zografos & Robbins, 2020). [Such strategies create
opportunities for national and transnational companies to develop
so-called sustainable mining for transition minerals,]{.underline}
batterygrid-electrification complexes with major [low carbon
infrastructural expansion, large scale hydroelectricity
projects]{.underline}, industrial wind power or [large-scale
solar]{.underline} power projects in the global South and North (Avila,
2018; Dunlap & Laratte, 2022; Zografos, 2022). However, [these
approaches focus on]{.underline} the [addition]{.underline} of new
sources of energy and materials, [rather than]{.underline} their full
[substitution. Coal production continues to increase]{.underline} (Roy &
Schaffartzik, 2021; York & Bell, 2019), [not least in the
Arctic]{.underline} (Savin et al., 2021). Even nuclear energy and
natural gas are seen as two of the solutions to meet net zero targets on
the decarbonization journey (IEA, 2022; Kemfert et al., 2022; Namaganda
et al., 2023). Nonetheless, nuclear or natural gas-powered projects also
face opposition (Temper et al., 2020). The term \"green extractivism\"
is related conceptually not only to studies (particularly after about
2015) that analyze conflicts around so-called transition minerals for
electrification (Dunlap, 2017), but also to the critique of the
so-called bioeconomy and conflicts and policies to replace fossil fuels,
dating back to the 2000s (Gudynas & Acosta, 2011). Flex crops (such as
sugar cane or palm oil) and \'flex trees\' led to increased cultivation
and extraction for agrofuels, feed, and fiber, facilitated by land
grabbing. These \"green\" plantation expansions perpetuated social
inequality and environmental destruction (Borras et al., 2016; Dorn et
al., 2022; Kröger, 2011, 2016b). We consider green extractivism as a
subset of extractivism, with those activities under the green economy
including more than the bioeconomy (Levidow, 2014). Hence, green
extractivism does not simply relate to forests and agriculture. The
current conversation about green extractivism and the climate crisis
focuses on windfarms, solar, battery complexes, and mining the metals
needed for all of these. Thus, [extractivism manifests itself in many
forms and degrees, with diverse effects and consequences]{.underline}
(Kröger, 2022a: 47). [Green extractivism fuels capitalist
expansion]{.underline} through so-called sustainable development
policies, [with implications for international]{.underline} and national
[legal and political framework]{.underline}s. These policies [jeopardize
social, ecological, and political realities, and create \"green
sacrifice zones\" in which certain lives exposed to contamination are
regarded as having less value than others]{.underline} (Mejia-Muñoz &
Babidge, 2023; Zografos, 2022). Green extractivism arises in the name of
climate change mitigation or green economic \'\'development\'\' (Dunlap
& Riquito, 2023). Green extractivism is therefore a process, and in
addition to flex crops, may include bioplastics, carbon offsets (e.g.
REDD+) (Kröger, 2016b), transition mineral mining and related
infrastructure and transportation services (Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Bruna,
2022). The term \"green\" added to extractivism has, however, typically
little to do with sustainability and solutions to the climate crisis
(Zografos, 2022). Green extractivism often [causes interrelated
socio-environmental pressures through overexploitation of
socioecological territories, including their culture, spirituality,
lifeways, food and customs, and social relations]{.underline} in general
(Andreucci & Zografos, 2022; Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Jerez et al., 2021).
Thus, [extractive \"green\" processes have typically neocolonialist
characteristics]{.underline} in the Global South (Acosta, 2011; Hughes
et al., 2023; Jerez et al., 2021; Svampa, 2019). They also appear
[within the immediate semi-peripheries of the Global North, such as the
Arctic (]{.underline}Hanaček et al., 2022). In biophysical terms,
[extractivist economies depend on the extraction of energy and
materials, and generate waste]{.underline} (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971;
Martinez-Alier, 2022). In social terms, [control, access, and use of
natural resources, disproportionate toxic pollution, and climate impacts
are]{.underline} typically [part of this process]{.underline}. There are
also [intersectional processes of \"Othering\", violence, and death
brought about by the creation and abuse of social divisions, along the
lines of gender, class, race, sexual orientation, caste, and
cultures]{.underline} (Andreucci & Zografos, 2022; Batalla, 2020; Pulido
& De Lara, 2018; Tran & Hanaček, 2023). We identify such processes in
varieties of extractivism aiming to achieve a carbon-free future, and to
slow the climate emergency \"ticking clock\" (Bruna, 2022; Clark, 2021).
Activists and academics have highlighted how \"[green\" opportunities
are not a solution to this crisis, but rather a continuation of
extractivism. Green extractivism]{.underline}, despite its name, still
relies on intense material extraction (Andreucci & Zografos, 2022;
Dunlap, 2018, 2021; Jerez et al., 2021; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022).
[In theory]{.underline} it [promotes sustainable development and
prosperity for all, but in practice turns into intolerable levels of
hardship for Indigenous Peoples, fisher, and peasant
communities]{.underline} (Akbulut et al., 2019). In what follows, we
argue that [the extension of green sacrifice zones]{.underline}, as well
as the new consensus surrounding the decarbonization path, [can be seen
as an expansion of commodity and waste frontiers]{.underline}
(Martinez-Alier, 2023), [building on historical patterns of colonialism
and extractivism]{.underline}. Del Bene and colleagues (2018) argued
that \"renewable\" energy hydropower projects are associated with the
oppression of those who oppose them though protest, undermining diverse
epistemologies and world views. Meanwhile, industrial wind and solar
power development projects shape uneven land conflicts (Avila et al.,
2022), occasionally involving [occupation and militarization of local
territories and displacement of populations.]{.underline} In some
documented instances there have been [assassinations of
activists]{.underline} (Dunlap, 2018; Dunlap & Fairhead, 2014; Fanari,
2021; Tran & Hanaček, 2023). The mining of green transition minerals
have also brought environmental, social, and economic harms (Jerez et
al., 2021; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). [Minerals and metals
identified as critical to the development of]{.underline} four [key
green energy technologie]{.underline}s---solar, wind, electric vehicles
and energy storage---are listed by Church and Crawford (2020). 2 They
include aluminum, cadmium, chromium[, cobalt,]{.underline} copper, iron,
lead[, lithium,]{.underline} manganese, molybdenum, nicke[l, rare
earths, selenium, palladium,]{.underline} silicon, silver, zinc[,
etc]{.underline}. Some are newer transition metals (Dunlap & Laratte,
2022). The [rush for rare earths includes various attempts to extract
the minerals from the ocean floor or submarine hydrothermal
deposits]{.underline} (Glasby, 2002; Levin et al., 2020). [Smelters and
tailings continue to expose local communities to toxicit]{.underline}y
(Dunlap & Jakobsen, 2020). We find empirical evidence across Latin
America, South-East Asia, Eastern Europe, and the African continent
(Núñez et al., 2022; Siti et al., 2022; Sovacool et al., 2020; Zografos,
2022). [As the ice across the Arctic recedes, infrastructure-related
projects are on the rise]{.underline} (Hildyard & Sol, 2017). For
example, the Polar Silk Road, part of China\'s Belt and Road Initiative,
involves expanding local economic partnerships through investments in
major infrastructure, nuclear powered icebreakers, and other extractive
projects along the Northern Sea Route (Tillman et al., 2018). 3 The
start of the war in Ukraine saw an increase in trade along the route
(Silk Road Briefing, 2023). This Northeast Passage across Russian Arctic
waters is currently usable only for a few months, and requires suitable
vessels due to floating ice (Kröger, 2023). [In the next
decade]{.underline} however, [even a \"low-carbon\" global climate model
predicts warming and melting of the ice]{.underline} (Kim et al., 2023).
The [route could reduce by 40% the distance between Northwest-European
ports and the Far East]{.underline}, compared to the Suez Canal route
(Kovalenko et al., 2018). [There is also a railroad in the planning
stage]{.underline} to link southern Finland to the Arctic Ocean,
[passing through reindeer herding territories]{.underline} (Junka-Aikio,
2023). But [what of the \'\'gradual elimination\'\' of local cultures
and livelihoods in these necropolitical \'\'death-dealing
assemblages\'\']{.underline} (Truscello 2020: 6; Dunlap & Laratte,
2022)[?]{.underline} Climate colonialism is also based on this logic of
necropolitics (DeBoom, 2022; Mahony & Endfield, 2018; Sultana, 2022).
Imperial and colonial processes shape climate questions, and have been
widely recognized in the literature (Dunlap, 2020; Kallianos, Dunlap &
Dalakoglou, 2022). Meanwhile, [erasure of Indigenous knowledge, imperial
climate infrastructure visions, and extraction]{.underline} are the most
common features shaping the socio-environmental and political
characteristics of a place (Locher & Fressoz, 2012; Mercer & Simpson,
2023). The [current climate crisis highlights the importance of
understanding]{.underline} colonialism ([coloniality) and reacting to
the undesirable situation that perpetuates it through \"green\"
extractivism]{.underline} (Bhambra & Newell, 2023; Dorn et al., 2022). A
recent publication by Vela Almeida et al. (2023) indicates that the
European Green New Deal not only provides opportunities for greater
profit, but also buttresses the imperial power structure, leaving little
space for anti-colonial ecologies. Altogether, [ongoing developments in
the Arctic region,]{.underline} such as gas, nuclear, wind, hydropower
and the new transition mineral rush in the wake of climate change
(Boersma & Losz, 2018; Össbo, 2023), as well as resistance to such
projects (Hanaček et al., 2022) [illustrate climate colonialities and
\"green\" extractivism]{.underline}s, from old to new (Gritsenko, 2018;
Sultana, 2022). Academics including geographers, journalists, activists,
Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, as well as Knowledge Keepers in
the Arctic, have increasingly agreed that [climate change and the
low-carbon transition projects reproduce colonial
attitudes.]{.underline} Such attitudes also [impose non-stop structural
blindness about ontological, epistemological, and axiological struggles
on the ground]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012; Lassila, 2020; Normann,
2021). [The green shift is **nothing more than a continued extraction**
of resources]{.underline} \[\...\] **[The difference is that resource
utilization has been given a nice color, green;]{.underline}** we call
it \'green colonization.\' [We were first colonized by people from
outside our lands, then colonized by climate change itself, driven by
people from outside our lands, and are now being colonized a third time
by responses to climate change]{.underline}. (Gunn-Britt Retter, head of
the Arctic & Environment Unit, Sámi Council). Source: Arctic Today
Newspaper (2021). In this context, [significant colonial dimensions of
climate change in the Arctic are massive expansion of the extractive,
industrial, and shipping sectors]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012),
[including those emerging from \"green\" sustainable development
promotions]{.underline} (Gritsenko, 2018; Len, 2021). Acknowledging not
only colonial history and ongoing colonial effects of such extractive
projects but also [resistances against multiple imperial and colonial
\'\'shades of green\'\']{.underline} (Carminero-Santangelo, 2014), [are
important for critical examination]{.underline} of these interrelated
dynamics. Huggan (2016) explains that [colonial aspects in the Arctic
context continue through economic, geopolitical, epistemic dominance by
the nation states and transnational companies]{.underline}. These
aspects are [incorporated into ideologies of modernization, green
development and progress that rely on Arctic resources]{.underline}.
Colonialism, thus, continues to shape debates and developments in the
fast changing Arctic today, as well as informing contested visions for
its future (Sörlin et al., 2022).

### REMS

#### **REM securitization exploits the Global South through resource extraction and the displacement of environmental problems onto the periphery**

Julia **Ferreira '24** --MA in IR from UChicago, has interned at the
Department of Energy Office of the Deputy Security, the Department of
State Office of Energy Diplomacy, and the New Democrat Coalition Policy
Team on the Hill. ("DeLorean or De-Lithium? Back to the Future: The
Projective Securitization of Critical Minerals for Clean Energy
Technologies," University of Chicago, 6/2024**,**
https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/12024?v=pdf) **-- DF**

My assertion that some [measures should be considered extraordinary but
are not is especially topical in the discussion of critical
minerals.]{.underline} The [securitization of critical minerals
justifies the continued implicit allowance of child labor, exploitation
of indigenous people, violation of communities' sovereignty, and
conditions of domination in the Global South]{.underline}. [These
practices of exploitation and domination]{.underline} associated with
raw material extraction, while [having existed for centuries, should be
viewed with moral outrage and seen as 'extraordinary.']{.underline}
However, the [Global North has framed disruptions to critical mineral
access as a threat, dooming the fight against global
warming.]{.underline} The [language of speed and urgency associated with
meeting critical mineral demand justifies the idea that only
professionals and global markets can safely ensure critical mineral
supply]{.underline}, removing the issue from political discussion and
thus from receiving input from domestic publics and electorates. The
exploitation and domination of the Global South for raw materials
extraction has existed for centuries under colonial and imperial world
systems, but part of the reason why these extraordinary measures
previously went unquestioned is because a 'global public' had yet to 15
emerge. The emergence of a more global community of states was necessary
to constitute a meaningful audience for securitization: Prior to World
War I, there existed fewer democracies and fewer citizens were tuned
into global events, so fewer reasons existed for governments to
securitize threats and justify measures to their domestic audiences.
[Once a global public began to emerge, states began to use security
language to prevent this public from 'uncovering' the true exploitative
nature of mining practices]{.underline}. For example, the [U.S.
government drew up its first list of critical minerals during World War
I, asserting that elements such as platinum, nickel, and tin were
crucial for the war effort (Nichols).]{.underline} In recent years, the
[risk of audiences questioning exploitative mining practices has become
much more salient due to technologies such as the internet and social
media, which have allowed people to become more aware of physically
distant issues across borders, contributing to the formation of
transnational advocacy networks]{.underline}. The possibility that
domestic publics will conceptualize exploitative mining practices as
extraordinary and immoral has become even greater in the last decade, as
young people have become more tuned into and outspoken about climate
change. In my empirical section, I demonstrate that as crisis points
have emerged in which domestic publics and transnational advocacy groups
started to question exploitative mining practices, members of the global
community of states---especially [those of the Global North---began to
deploy moves to securitize critical minerals access in terms of climate
change]{.underline}. These [securitizing moves halted global publics
from conceiving of the exploitation of the Global South for critical
minerals as extraordinary, given the more prominent weight given to
climate change as a security threat.]{.underline}

#### "Critical minerals" are a marketing ploy meant to excuse the military-industrial complex's need for resource security.

[This concept of \'transition materials\' is based, and marketed, on the
assumption that mining will actually result in a (real) energy
transition]{.underline} from hydrocarbon dependence to wind, solar,
biomass and hydrological energy generation. However, [the current energy
mix as well as the mining of \'critical\' minerals continue to rely on
hydrocarbons]{.underline} (see Dunlap, 2021b, 2023c; Dunlap & Marin,
2022), [rendering the term \'transition minerals\' nothing more than a
public relations exercise by the mining sector]{.underline}---which has
repositioned itself as a vital enabler of the energy transition--- [to
justify and advance green extractivism.]{.underline} Moreover, [the
designation of raw materials as \'critical\' is the product of Western
military-industrial complexes\' strategies to secure access and maintain
a steady supply of these minerals under the guise of \"transition\" and
climate change mitigation]{.underline} (Marin et al., 2023). Scholars,
unfortunately, have been slow to confront misleading green terminology.
Going beyond the focus on mining, Dunlap (2019a, 20) applies \"green
extractivism\" to include forms of low-carbon energy production, such as
wind energy development, demonstrating \"continuity between conventional
and \'green\' extractive activities\" (see also Dunlap & Jakobsen,
2020). Bruna (2022a, 2022b), in turn, [further extend]{.underline}ed
[the concept to include \"climate-smart policies,]{.underline}\"
including Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) and Reducing Emissions from
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). She defines [green
extractivism \"as a variation of extractivism that feeds capital
accumulation through the appropriation of nature, mediated through
differentiated levels of labor exploitation and through asymmetric and
exploitative social, economic and ecological relations]{.underline}\"
(2022a, 14). This also covers the extraction, expropriation and transfer
of emission rights (Bruna, 2022a, 839). Echoing the EDCs framework,
[green extractivism]{.underline}, Bruna (2022a, 142) continues,
\"[connects micro and macro implications of \[\...\]asymmetric exchange
relation]{.underline}s, including financialisation dynamics.\" A broader
interpretation of green extractivism has also been advanced by Andrés
Núñez and colleagues (2022, 703), who employ the concept of
\"eco-extractivism\" to describe how \"[extractivist investors\" are now
investing in conservation or sustainable development
projects]{.underline} (see Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Huff & Orengo, 2020; Le
Billon, 2021). In this Special Section, we maintain an even broader
approach to green extractivism, reflecting our expansive interpretation
of extractivism as outlined above. Thus, aside from mining, agrarian
extractivism, low-carbon energy production, market-based conservation
and REDD+, we include, following Bresnihan and Brodie (2021), Chagnon
and colleagues (2021, 2022), Brodie (2024) and Archer and Calvão (2024),
infrastructure development (see Brock, 2023, this Section), and
intersecting forms of green digital extractivism and conservation
(Ruelas & Dunlap, 2023, this Section). We also explicitly include the
zinc supply-webs of the infrastructural, digital and battery sectors
(see Heikkinen, 2024, this Section; Barbesgaard & Whitmore, 2024, this
Section). This brings us to the question: when can extractivism be
called \'green\'?

#### Lithium and other REMs have become securitized to meet the demands of the Global North at the expense of the Global South -- direct violence

In June of 2023, Argentinian police violently repressed a peaceful
demonstration of indigenous communities protesting the non-consensual
appropriation of their traditional lands for lithium extraction
(Barber). The use of rubber bullets, tear gas, and threats of
intimidation 2 against these peaceful protestors demonstrates that
somehow, [lithium has become a security issue:]{.underline} Something
particular about lithium succeeded at mobilizing exceptional measures to
ensure access to the mineral (Barber). What is striking, however, is
that [underneath the visibility of this sudden violence lies a more
invisible, pervasive form of exploitation that has been ongoing for
decades: the exploitation of the Global South to provide raw materials
and cheap labor for the Global North.]{.underline} In this paper, I
argue that the [exploitation of the Global South has become entangled
with security discourses, specifically in the critical mineral
issue-domain.]{.underline} This paper seeks to answer the question: Has
the securitization of critical minerals succeeded? If yes, how have
these minerals been securitized, and what is the character of this
securitization? [Securitization is the process by which actors use
specific language and narratives to construct an issue as a threat: If
the intended audience accepts the threat-construction as legitimate, the
speakers of security can elevate the issue and responses to it above the
realm of normal politics]{.underline} (Oels 185)[. In this paper, I
investigate attempts by U.S. actors to construct their lack of access to
critical minerals as a threat]{.underline}. The Energy Act of 2020, for
example, defines [a 'critical mineral' as a mineral essential to the
economic or national security of the United States, helping to
constitute the disruption of critical mineral supply chains as a threat
to U.S. economic and national security]{.underline} ("What Are Critical
Materials and Critical Minerals?"). While the term ['critical
minerals']{.underline} has historically been used to refer to a variety
of materials deemed necessary for different purposes, I specifically
focus on the [increasing use of the term to refer to elements, such as
lithium and cobalt, that form essential components of clean energy
technologies]{.underline} ("Critical Minerals"). In the last few years,
critical minerals have become a prominent area of focus for 3
governments and intergovernmental organizations. [Lithium and cobalt,
for example, have become especially salient as crucial components of
electric vehicle batteries]{.underline} (Talens Peiró et al. 986).
[Current mining is unable to meet demand, which is expected to soar as
Western countries push a clean energy transition to limit global
temperature rise]{.underline} ("Critical Minerals").

#### The Global North targets advocates -- they know they are the first step of making the issues of REM securitization aware

Julia **Ferreira '24** --MA in IR from UChicago, has interned at the
Department of Energy Office of the Deputy Security, the Department of
State Office of Energy Diplomacy, and the New Democrat Coalition Policy

https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/12024?v=pdf) **-- DF**

Advocacy groups' role in increasing the visibility of extraordinary
measures is salient to government actors [because domestic publics
perceive advocacy groups to have both expert and moral authority, which
means that the general public tends to listen to and respect the
opinions voiced by these groups]{.underline}. In other words, [advocacy
groups tend to be the first movers on issues of exploitation, and their
opinions about what is immoral and wrong often trickle down]{.underline}
to ordinary publics. Often, [advocacy groups]{.underline} actively [use
attention-raising as a strategy to mobilize domestic publics to pressure
their governments]{.underline} on certain issues. Thus, it [makes sense
for securitizing actors---such as the community of states in the Global
North---to also target advocacy groups]{.underline}, and not just their
domestic publics, [with securitzing moves]{.underline}. Convincing
advocacy groups that the lack of critical minerals access is a threat
would stop the 'trickling down' process at the source, precluding a
tipping point in which domestic publics begin to perceive the
exploitation and domination involved in securing access to these
minerals as extraordinary measures. In other words, [if the second tier
of the audience -- the domestic public---is not yet aware of the
extraordinary measure, then governments' securitizing moves should
target the first tier of the audience, advocacy groups]{.underline}.
Otherwise, targeting securitizing moves towards the second tier 22 would
only produce more work for security speakers by bringing an issue to the
forefront of the domestic public consciousness that was previously
obscured and invisible to the domestic public. Doing so would contradict
the [intended outcome of projected securitization, which is to demote
the political salience of an issue]{.underline}. When invisibility is a
factor in the projective securitization process, I argue that [this
'demotion' or continued obfuscation occurs via NGO
appeasement.]{.underline}

#### Securitization language and depiction of China as a threat in terms of REMs is to mask U.S. exploitive practices

Julia **Ferreira '24** --MA in IR from UChicago, has interned at the
Department of Energy Office of the Deputy Security, the Department of
State Office of Energy Diplomacy, and the New Democrat Coalition Policy
Team on the Hill. ("DeLorean or De-Lithium? Back to the Future: The

Finally, in [September of 2020, Trump]{.underline} issued Executive
Order 13953, which unlike the administration's previous outputs,
[directly called out China when using securitizing language around
critical minerals]{.underline}. Strikingly, the [executive order
declares a national emergency]{.underline} in order [to deal with the
"unusual and extraordinary threat" constituted by the United States'
"undue reliance on critical minerals . . . from foreign
adversaries"]{.underline} (Trump, Executive Order 13953). In order to
address this "national emergency," the Trump Administration [called for
federal agencies to prepare a report investigating U.S. dependence on
foreign adversaries for critical minerals access and recommending
executive action in response, including "the imposition of tariffs or
quotas . . . . against China and and other non-market adversaries whose
economic practices threaten to undermine the health, growth, and
resiliency of the United States"]{.underline} (Trump, Executive Order
13953). Trump [specifically calls out dependence on Chinese minerals as
a threat, accusing China of using "aggressive economic practices" to
cement its dominance in the critical minerals space, leading to what
Trump terms the 'destruction' of "vital mining and manufacturing jobs in
the United States"]{.underline} (Trump, Executive Order 13953). A White
House fact sheet about this 53 executive order also depicts the Trump
administration as protecting domestic critical mineral supply chains
from "predatory Chinese action" and "predatory foreign competition from
China" ("President Donald J. Trump"). [The term 'predatory,' like the
term 'hostage,' evokes intense threat, danger, and fear, but also poses
a key contrast to the Clinton administration's willingness to give China
greater access to critical minerals]{.underline}. I stake the claim that
among the many motivations behind the Clinton administration's greater
willingness to allow Chinese access to these minerals, one of the
factors was that at the time, the U.S. had an unimpeded opportunity to
access critical minerals through other countries, such as Chile. I read
the Trump administration\'s (and the subsequent Biden administration's)
portrayal of China as a threat in the critical minerals space as
motivated in part because NGO agitation and questioning threatened to
bring visibility of mining exploitation to U.S. publics, which would
impede U.S. ability to access critical minerals through exploitation of
the Global South. Interestingly, Trump's 2020 executive order on
critical minerals does make minor references to exploitation, the
ongoing extraordinary measure that I argue the projective securitization
seeks to simultaneously justify, obscure, and remove from public
political discussion. In the text of the executive order, Trump asserts
that increasing domestic production of critical minerals would reduce
U.S. and global reliance on minerals produced in countries that lack
"responsible mining standards," "leading to human rights violations,
forced and child labor, violent conflict, and health and environmental
damage" (Trump, Executive Order 13953). I read these references to
exploitation as evidence that the Trump administration did take notice
of and perhaps respond, albeit indirectly, to the NGO agitations and
investigations around critical minerals exploitation that started in
2016. This phrasing---which mentions the child labor and 54 health
issues related to mining that the NGO investigations brought
international attention to---helps to bolster my argument that
securitizing actors target advocacy groups, and not just their domestic
publics, with securitizing moves, since awareness of humanitarian or
social justice issues often 'trickles down' from well-resourced NGOs to
less-resourced, less-organized domestic publics. Importantly, however,
[the Trump administration's minor acknowledgement of exploitation in
this executive order does not constitute acknowledgement of U.S. role in
the exploitation. The executive order defers blame for the exploitation
to other countries---to the producer countries it conveys as lacking
"responsible mining standards"---which allows U.S. actors' role in the
exploitation and in creating the issues which contribute to the
exploitation to remain obscured]{.underline} (Trump, Executive Order
13953). Additionally, the [Trump administration's construction of
Chinese access to these minerals as a security threat, especially
through the declaration of a national emergency, greatly outweighs these
minor allusions to exploitation: I argue that this allows the
administration to somewhat appease transnational advocacy groups while
still obscuring exploitative practices from the U.S. public by directing
greater attention and urgency to China as a threat]{.underline} (Trump,
Executive Order 13953).

#### Climate and human securitization are used in conjunction to mask REM exploitation

Julia **Ferreira '24** --MA in IR from UChicago, has interned at the
Department of Energy Office of the Deputy Security, the Department of
State Office of Energy Diplomacy, and the New Democrat Coalition Policy
Team on the Hill. ("DeLorean or De-Lithium? Back to the Future: The

Technologies," University of Chicago, 6/2024**,**
https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/12024?v=pdf) **-- DF**

[Biden's move towards climate change constituted a different
securitization tactic than that pursued by Trump]{.underline}---who
actively denied climate science---but both tactics were intended to
accomplish the same goal: [construct the lack of access to critical
minerals as a security threat]{.underline} 57 (Wise). I read the turn
towards a critical mineral securitizing strategy based on climate change
as driven in part by growing U.S. public awareness and belief in climate
science, especially among younger generations, Democrats and Biden
voters, and, importantly, transnational organizations advocating for
social justice and humanitarian causes (Kennedy). [Thus, this shift in
strategy could also be read as an attempt to mask national security talk
in human security terms, such as by emphasizing the potential climate
impacts on vulnerable and marginalized communities.]{.underline} For
example, in [his executive order on refugees, released only twenty days
before his February 2021 executive order on critical minerals, Biden
expresses U.S. commitment to "address the global refugee crisis" and
orders federal agencies to submit a report on "climate change and its
impact on migration, including forced migration"]{.underline} (Executive
Order 14013). [References to forced migration conjure images of
individuals and communities being harmed, thus couching a national
security threat in terms of its impacts to individuals and
communities]{.underline}. However, the [connection between this human
security talk and national security is clear, as Biden also orders the
report to include "discussion of the international security implications
of climate-related migration"]{.underline} (Executive Order 14013).
Overall, I argue that [governments use human security talk rather than
or alongside national security talk in part to facilitate the likelihood
that NGOs 'take up' and internalize both climate securitization and
critical minerals securitization]{.underline}. Such [emphasis on a
climate emergency, however, risks narrowing "'the policy gaze to the
restrictive logic of equating human well-being with reduced carbon
emissions,'" which I argue allows for the outweighing and obfuscation of
critical mineral exploitation]{.underline} (Albert 539).

### Renewables

#### Resources can never be purely renewable -- the aff is a form of green extractivism seeking to monetize the crises they construct.

**Dunlap et. al. 24** \[(Dr. Alexander Dunlap is a research scientist at
the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability (IGS). Judith
Verweijen is an Assistant Professor in Political Geography at Utrecht
University. Carlos Tornel holds a PhD in Human Geography from Durham
University.) Dunlap, A., Verweijen, J., & Tornel, C. (2024). The
political ecologies of "green" extractivism(s): An introduction. Journal
of Political Ecology, 31(1), 436-463.
<https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.6131>\] //KH

We note four features of green extractivism, the first two of which
distinguish it from extractivism. First, [green
extractivism]{.underline} differs from extractivism in that it [uses
socioecological, weather and climate crises to generate new]{.underline}
or reinforce existing [\'green\' markets or profit-generating
activities]{.underline}. Inspired by Deboom\'s (2021) assessment of
\"climate necropolitics,\" Deberdt and Le Billon (2024, 5) identify this
phenomenon as \"climate extractivism,\" [where the climate crisis itself
is mined to justify various extractive operations]{.underline}. Drawing
inspiration from Klein (2007), Sullivan (2009) and Fletcher (2012), we
interpret this as disaster green extractivism as the process of
enlisting ecological catastrophes to advance extractivism ranging from
[ecotourism, data centers, deepsea mining, \'green\' hydrogen, climate
\'smart\' agriculture and geoengineering]{.underline} to [mineral mining
to produce lower-carbon technologie]{.underline}s. As Hanaček, Kröger
and Martínez-Alier (2024, this Section) explain, [such catastrophe
extends to the melting of the Arctic, allowing for greater access not
only to oil and natural gas, but also to rare earth elements, lithium
and other materials necessary for]{.underline} lower-carbon
infrastructures and [the so-called green transition]{.underline}. A
second distinguishing feature of [green extractivism]{.underline} is
that it [involves the mobilization of claims of ecological
sustainability, \'carbon neutrality\' and combating climate change in
order to legitimize and rationalize extraction.]{.underline} Such claims
include relying on lower-carbon, or \'renewable\' energy systems,
contributing to biodiversity conservation, promoting enhanced energy
efficiency, producing electric vehicle systems, using digital
(\'smart\') application systems and engaging in carbon offsetting or
restoration. As further explained below, these [claims obscure the
fundamental entanglements between conventional and \'green\'
extractivism, making deception a central feature]{.underline} of the
latter. [So-called green projects extract]{.underline}--- directly or
indirectly---from ecosystems, [and are often dependent on conventional
hydrocarbon extractive projects]{.underline} (Dunlap, 2021b; Andreucci
et al., 2023; Marin et al., 2023; Deberdt & Le Billion, 2024). [The
claims to \'sustainability\', \'climate friendliness\' and
\'green-ness\' harnessed by green extractivism are deeply inscribed in
specific ontologies and epistemologies,]{.underline} further
[underscoring how extractivism inevitably entails political/ontological
conflict.]{.underline} While there are numerous examples, following Ivan
Illich (1974), Cara Daggett (2019) and Larry Lohmann (2021, 2024), we
want to highlight how categories such as \"energy\" (as opposed to
electricity) and the epistemological approach of thermodynamics remain
central to the ideology of (green) extractivism. As Lohmann (2024)
reminds us, most energy researchers are reluctant to see the politics
and coloniality \'inside energy\' itself, instead focusing on
alleviating \"energy poverty\" and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7
that are designed to propel capitalist extractivism and developmentalism
(Menton et al., 2020; Larsen et al., 2022; Tornel, 2023a; Müller, 2024).
The concept of \"energy\" is a politico/scientific technology designed
to advance extractive development. Opening the apolitical and universal
assumptions that have conceptualized energy as an abstract,
interchangeable and commensurable form of work reveals the
extraction-coloniality nexus that persists behind concepts like \'energy
transitions\', \'renewable energy\' or \'energy justice\' (Dunlap,
2021b; Partridge, 2022; Tornel, 2023). Taken-for-granted categories like
energy, and the science that affirms it (e.g, thermodynamics) therefore
remain essential to advancing green extractivism. Scrutinizing the
epistemological and ontological views embedded in green-ness claims
further reveals how green extractivism is propelled by \"climate
masculinities.\" Drawing on feminist energy researchers such as Daggett
(2018) and Bell and colleagues (2020), Dunlap (2022, 154) conceptualizes
climate masculinities as emphasizing grand scales and reductionist data,
rooted in approaches to the scientific domination of the planet. These
approaches marginalize or ignore other scientific methods, particularly
those involving alternative ontologies and epistemologies (e.g. Cruz et
al., 2020; Zaragocin & Caretta, 2021). The dominant gaze of climate
masculinities to intervene at a planetary scale (e.g. earth system
science and geoengineering) combines with the ontological and physical
invisibilization inflicted by \'sustainable development\' projects built
on notions such as terra nullius, which entail deploying a matrix of
physical and symbolic violence to render certain people and places
visible for extraction and exploitation thereby rendering others
invisible (Scott, 1998; Li, 2014; Vidalou, 2023). This relates to ideas
of \"climate reductionism\" (Gelderloos, 2023, 38) and \"carbon tunnel
vision\" (Achakulwisut et al., 2022), again demonstrating how [green
extractivism enacts (neo)colonialism]{.underline}. A third core feature
of [green extractivism]{.underline} is that it [is fundamentally
entwined with conventional extractivism]{.underline}. Green projects
also extract---directly or indirectly---from ecosystems, and are often
enabled by capital from or tools and infrastructure produced by
conventional hydrocarbon extractive projects (Dunlap, 2021b; Andreucci
et al., 2023; Marin et al., 2023; Deberdt & Le Billion, 2024). There are
entire equipment factories, mining operations, chemical processing
facilities, smelting and manufacturing facilities that produce wind,
solar, hydrological and tidal wave extraction technologies. Speaking to
this obvious reality, Teresa Pierce---a resident being surrounded by
photovoltaic solar projects in California---reminds us: *Every single
piece of equipment that they have out here \[at the solar energy
project\], uses diesel. All of it, how green is that? And if I get both
of these \[solar projects\] in here, it\'s gonna take 3 years \[to
build\]. And guess what? We\'re gonna be smelling diesel fumes the whole
time, you know?9* [The financial and material conspiracy between
conventional and so-called \'green\' projects runs deep into existing
financial structures and production supply-webs]{.underline} and
operates in plain sight with lower-carbon infrastructures spreading
across fields, seas, rivers and cities. An [important vector of the
intersection between green and conventional extractivism is the
increasing digitization of extractive operations through automated
systems and a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence, managed
from centralized control rooms of utility providers and/or energy
companies.10 Furthermore, [the majority of green extractivist projects
are driven by corporations and states that also engage in
\'conventional\' extractivism.]{.underline} Therefore, [much of the
capital invested in \'green\' projects is derived from conventional
extractivist projects, whereas the profits of green extractivisms are
reinvested in conventional extractive activities]{.underline}.
Conventional extraction companies, we must acknowledge, have multiple
\'green\' investments, including British Petroleum Solar; RWE\'s
lower-carbon energy division Innogy; BlackRock\'s investments in First
Solar and Brookfield Renewable; and Shell, Exxon, Equinor and other oil
companies\' investment in lower-carbon infrastructures, hydrogen, carbon
capture and storage and beyond (Dunlap, 2023c). [The blurring of green
and conventional extractivist capital flows only gets more complicated
in relation to data centers, undersea cables, and the siting of wind,
solar and other lower-carbon extraction project]{.underline}s (Bresnihan
& Brodie, 2021; Dunlap & Laratte, 2022; Sovacool, et al., 2022; Brodie,
2024). In sum, there are countless connections between conventional
extraction and green extractive infrastructures, particularly when
looking at capital, supply-webs and broader commodity chains. A fourth
key feature of [green extractivism]{.underline} is that it [rests on
false assumptions regarding the renewability of \'resources,\' or
existences]{.underline}. Agriculture, forestry and, to a lesser degree,
vital wind, wave and river current flows are assumed to be infinite and
renewable. This [assumption]{.underline}, however, [is fallacious, as
exploiting these resources can quickly lead to slow and progressive
ecological/climatic degradations]{.underline} (Dunlap, 2021b). The
[high-modernist]{.underline} eye---and [materialist
ontologies]{.underline} it is grounded in---fails to, refuses, and
[simply cannot acknowledge or experience these progressive ecological
degradations and changes]{.underline}. The Wet\'suwet\'en land defender,
Freda Huson (2023 \[2015\], 107) describes this progressive degradation
and the importance of socioecological reciprocity as follows: We grew up
like this, as traditionalists, learning how to only take what we need
and how to always give back---industry doesn\'t do that. Logging
companies have clear-cut massive sections and actually tripled their
allowable cut. They use these machines that just tear up the ground.
[They say, \'Well, logging is a renewable resource because we plant
trees back.\' But they only put back the species that they plan to cut
down again]{.underline}, like balsam, spruce, and pine. It\'s quite dry
and the soil is dead everywhere they\'ve clear-cut. The same vegetation
doesn\'t grow back. [The whole ecosystem is out of balance]{.underline}
because of it. It impacts all the animals; we\'ve noticed there are
fewer and fewer of certain species and when some of the forests are
allowed to grow back, you see these species start resurfacing again.
Then the company comes along and does more clear-cutting. [So-called
renewability involves degradation, irreparable damage, and
exhaustion]{.underline}. As mentioned above, agricultural plantations
and soil extractivism exemplify these concerns (Kröger, 2022; Hokkanen,
2024), but so does hydrological, solar and wind extractivism (Kelly,
2021; Hu, 2023; Dunlap & Marin, 2022), the impacts of which are often
difficult to observe, happen slowly and progressively over time[. False
claims of renewability call for sustained inquiries into slow and
progressive forms of extractivism, as well as the (re)production of
infrastructural occupations]{.underline} (e.g. solar monocultures) [and
uneven distributional burdens emanating from]{.underline} energy
transformers (Dunlap, 2020), high-voltage power lines (Dunlap & Laratte,
2022), battery energy storage systems (Archer & Calvão, 2024) and, most
of all, so-called [\'green\' technologies]{.underline} (Chagnon et al.,
2021, 2022; Brodie, 2024). The latter include lower-carbon
infrastructures, e-mobility, \'smart\' technologies, agro-forestry,
conservation and other sectors claiming to be \'green\' or
\'carbon-neutral\' now or within the next decade. Said differently,
[when looking critically at supplywebs and renewability claims,
distinctions between green and non-green extractivism begin to break
down and appear to be based on questionable, culturally reinforced,
assumptions]{.underline}.

#### Extracting supposedly renewable resources still leads to ecosystem elimination.

Alberto Acosta (2013/2011, 62) further expanded the concept of
[extractivism]{.underline} by emphasizing that it [is \"not limited to
minerals or oil.]{.underline} Extractivism is [also present in farming,
forestry and]{.underline} even [fishing]{.underline}.\" The extension of
extractivism outside the mineral and hydrocarbon sector to resources
that are potentially renewable raised the question: [what type of
resource use is actually socioecologically renewable and
sustainable?]{.underline} [Even]{.underline} [trees, soil, rivers,
aquatic bodies]{.underline} and the life forms within them [designated
as \"renewable\" can become irreparably damaged, overexploited,
contaminated and pushed to a point of ecosystemic
elimination]{.underline} (e.g., ecocide) by extractive activities.
[Because of large-scale extraction \"many \'renewable\' resources, such
as forests or soil fertility, are becoming non-renewable]{.underline},\"
Acosta (2013: 62) continues. Therefore, [\"the problems of non-renewable
natural resources may equally affect all resources, renewable or not.\"
Agro-extractivism]{.underline} (Veltmeyer & Petras, 2014; Tetreault et
al., 2021; McKay et al., 2021) [and forestry extractivism]{.underline}
(Kröger, 2016; Ehrnström-Fuentes & Kröger, 2018; Ramcilovic-Suominen et
al., 2022) [have since come under the broad banner of green
extractivism.]{.underline} More recently, these insights have been
complemented by work acknowledging the diverse and dynamic lives of
[soil microorganisms]{.underline} and how they [are denied, ignored and
killed by industrial agriculture, giving rise to]{.underline} the notion
of \"[soil extractivism]{.underline}\" (Hokkanen, 2024). In sum, in the
context of current industrial operations, [the renewable/nonrenewable
dichotomy in most instances does not exist]{.underline} (Dunlap, 2021b,
2023b). This demonstrates how [green extractivism is fundamentally based
on politico-psychological maneuvering, as it crucially hinges on the
idea of sustainability and the renewability of \'resource\'
use.]{.underline}

### Research

#### The scientific and resource ends of the aff are fundamentally coercive -- and means to an end goal of land enclosure by corporations and the State.

Emerging alongside, or even intertwined, with EDCs has been a renewed
[emphasis on land grabbing and land control]{.underline} (Peluso & Lund
2011; White et al. 2012). This research soon began to [focus on
conservation, biofuels and sustainable development projects]{.underline}
(Fairhead et al., 2012; Corson et al., 2013; Rocheleau, 2015; Núñez et

[wind turbines]{.underline} (Dunlap, 2019a, 2017; Avila, 2017; Siamanta,
2019; Singh, 2023, this Section) [and marine territories]{.underline}
(Bennett et al. 2015; Mallin & Barbesgaard 2020). This shift in focus
led to the concept of [green grabbing, defined]{.underline} by Fairhead
and colleagues (2012, 238) [as \"the appropriation of land and resources
for environmental ends.\"]{.underline} As explained above, gr[een
grabbing is the \'green\' accumulation by dispossession,]{.underline}
which overlaps with extractivism through the idea of appropriation (see
Gudynas, 2009) and, as the same time, [it \"represents the proliferation
of ecological distribution conflicts]{.underline}\" (Dunlap, 2017, 18).
[Green grabbing also entails using deceptive and coercive
scientific]{.underline} (e.g., surveying, [studies]{.underline}, etc.),
[financial]{.underline} (e.g., capital investment) [and
material]{.underline} (e.g., machines, equipment, workers, fences)
[means to organize land enclosures and the capture and commodification
of]{.underline} ([traditionally]{.underline}) rapidly [regenerative and
renewable natures, leading to the displacement, subjugation, or
destruction of the]{.underline} human and non-human [inhabitants of the
targeted areas]{.underline} (Fairhead et al. 2012). [Green extractivism
indicates an entrenchment and systematization of green
grabbing]{.underline}. Green grabbing, Natacha Bruna (2022a, 142),
explains, \"focuses on the process of resource grabbing as a driver of
dispossession and hidden accumulation agendas,\" while \"the concept of
green extractivism allows us to explore asymmetric exchange relations --
including ecological relations -- between actors and regions that feed
accumulation.\" In this definition, [green grabbing is]{.underline}
relegated to \"a process of resource grabbing\" and acquisition, but
[not systematized extractivism.]{.underline} Bruna\'s (2022a) reference
to \"[asymmetric exchange relations\" further binds green extractivism
and EDCs scholarship.]{.underline} The latter charts the asymmetrical
distribution of costs and benefits, which also extends to
center-periphery exchange dynamics. [Green extractivism]{.underline},
nevertheless, goes beyond this by [looking]{.underline} not only
[at]{.underline} processes and relations of extraction and distribution
but also at the [structures and broader conditions
(material/political/ontological) that enable]{.underline} them. The
relation between green grabbing and green extractivism can thus be
understood by Patrick Wolfe\'s (2006, 388) famous quote on settler
colonialism: \"[invasion is a structure not an event]{.underline}.\"
[Green grabbing is the logistical preparation, act or \'event\' that
encloses land; while green extractivism is the modality and structure
that organizes continuous extraction of human and nonhuman natures in
the service of state affirmation, capital accumulation and value
grabbing]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in turn [leads to the
proliferation of ecological destruction conflicts.]{.underline} Green
extractivism, then, represents a successful and sustained process of
green grabbing, where land, natures and existences are not only
grabbed---appropriated, expropriated, enclosed and rendered legible---
but minerals, wind, sun, water, biodiversity and forests become
systematically integrated into circuits of capitalism and related forms
of political control. [Green grabbing is driven by and creates the
conditions for green extractivism]{.underline}---[it establishes and
enables the complex supply-webs that sustain it, by
promoting]{.underline} the [successful commodification, marketization
and extraction of humans, nonhumans]{.underline} (flora, fauna, etc.)
[and more-than-humans]{.underline} (river spirits, mountains, etc.) [to
propel the expansion of capitalist mentalities, development, and
natures.]{.underline} This broader, multi-scalar and multidimensional
structure of green extractivism has been well documented by political
ecologists, who have conducted extensive research on green
financialization, the ecotourism-extraction nexus, green/control
grabbing, blue grabbing/growth and, more recently, green extractivism
(e.g. Büscher & Davidov 2013; Corson et al., 2013; Sullivan 2013;
Siamanta, 2017; Dunlap 2019a; Marijnen & Schouten, 2019; Brock 2020b;
Huff & Orengo 2020; Bresnihan & Brodie, 2021; Le Billion 2021; Ulloa,
2021 Nygren et al., 2022). Said simply, political ecologists have been
at the forefront of investigating green extractivism.

#### The 1AC generates [new vectors]{.underline} of Arctic securitization by demanding [immediate]{.underline} scientific and technological responses to complex future threats. 

**Johnson, 24**---Assistant Professor of Humane Artificial Intelligence
and International Relations in the department of International Relations
and International Organizations at the University of Groningen
(Benjamin, "This world of tomorrow: sociotechnical imaginaries of
security in the Canadian Arctic," Critical Studies on Security, 12(2),
187--208, dml)

[Arctic security in the modern era is **bound** with **futurity**
because threats that undermine the state's sovereignty are considered
**potentialities** rather than clear and present dangers]{.underline}.
While the term 'threat' already implies what may happen rather than what
will, [the nature of those threats as potentialities is spatially and
temporally **expanded**]{.underline}. [The risks associated with threats
**increase** as threats are **projected farther** into the
future]{.underline}, [especially concerning state
sovereignty]{.underline}, [which offers a sense of **immediacy** to the
Arctic's security in the present]{.underline}. For instance, former
Prime Minister Stephen Harper drew explicitly from this Arctic imaginary
by insisting that, in an often-cited passage, Canadians in the 22nd --
century demand action in the 21st and that Canada was at risk of
'losing' the Arctic if it did not 'use' it (Dodds Citation2012, 994).

[There is a consistent thread that **permeates** the various **Arctic
imaginaries** over time]{.underline}, [from efforts towards **colonial
expansion**]{.underline} that rested on the themes of adventure,
mystery, and taming the Arctic's wildness as a frontier space [through
the mastery of **marine navigation** to the equally colonised
imaginaries of **northward expansion** in service of]{.underline}
Canada's **[nation-building]{.underline}** efforts [and the defence of
**sovereignty**]{.underline} throughout the Cold War and now. In all
cases, [the axes of sovereign control have rested **principally** on
notions of **scientific progress** and **technological
innovation**]{.underline}. [Science and technology are **critical
vectors** of modernisation as an **idealised practice**]{.underline},
[which have **consistently underpinned** political efforts by the state
to **rationalise** and **control** the Arctic]{.underline}. Thus, [the
**goal**]{.underline} of rationalising the Arctic's spatial and temporal
vectors [is not new]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, the specific
characteristic of networked complexity and [the **intensity** of
the]{.underline} spatial and temporal [components]{.underline} (i.e. the
degree to which time and space are collapsed as impediments to accessing
and controlling the Arctic) [underlying the New Arctic implies a
**novelty** in how the Arctic is understood concerning this complexity
and how it should be secured]{.underline}.

### China/Russia

#### Securitization of Russia and China is a result of its imperial decline\-\--the inherent desire for power recreates the security dilemmas of the 1AC

This article used a consistent set of primary sources, an explicit
methodology, and both qualitative and quantitative data to account for
the evolution of the current securitization process which portrays great
power competition, in the form of [Russia's and China's open challenge
to America's position in the international system,]{.underline} as an
[existential threat to America's place in the international
system]{.underline}. While at some level the specific elements of this
new narrative -- revisionism, the democracy-autocracy binary, and
spheres of influence -- are revivals of Cold War tropes, [this analysis
allowed for a better understanding of the broader issues involved
in]{.underline} how this narrative [shift reflects U.S. geopolitical
culture,]{.underline} how it believes this challenge has occurred, and
how it perceives America's role in the changing international system.
From these, the [likely future of American grand strategy]{.underline}
and geopolitical culture is [coming into clearer focus]{.underline}. It
is the open recognition that the geopolitical status quo is actually
slipping, a situation which some IRT scholars have been saying for some
time (Schweller and Pu 2011; Layne 2012; Mearsheimer 2019), which has
precipitated this narrative shift. This **[demonstrates exactly how
closely tied U.S. self-identity]{.underline} and geopolitical culture
[are to the preservation of primacy]{.underline}, unipolarity, and the
liberal-democratic world order. [Should one or more of these conditions
fully collapse,]{.underline}** then we are **[likely to see a dramatic
rupture in American geopolitical culture -- with a difficult
redefinition of its place in the world]{.underline}**, a popular
backlash, and unpredictable results. Moreover, the quantitative data
reveal that this narrative shift has had less to do with the growing
capabilities of Russia/China than their ultimate goal to promote a new
global architecture based upon multipolarity[. The ability of Russia's
and China's nuclear programs to end the physical existence of the U.S.
has remained virtually the same since the end of the Cold
War,]{.underline} and while these states have begun closing the military
and technical gap between themselves and the U.S., [this new
geopolitical narrative more closely corresponds to a notable rise in
references to their intentions, rather than capabilities]{.underline}.
This is seen most clearly by the fact that Russia's more overt challenge
has resulted in it being singled out as the more significant threat over
China, which, based upon raw current and future capabilities, is
objectively a far larger danger. This [raises]{.underline} important
[theoretical questions about threat perceptions and securitization
processes]{.underline} which seemingly [have more to do with perceptions
about current and future aggressiveness than capabilities]{.underline}.
This invites further study. Finally, LeGreco and Tracy (2009) noted that
an equally important aspect of discourse/narrative tracing is to track
what is not said. There was [little acknowledgment from the American
side that it had a substantive hand in precipitating these changes by
either promoting a security dilemma between itself,]{.underline} on the
one hand, [and China/Russia,]{.underline} on the other[, or that it has
engaged in a grand strategy which has led to **overextension** and
**imperial decline.**]{.underline} Therefore, according to this
(self-)limited understanding on Washington's part, there appears little
that it can do to ameliorate the situation, and no course correction is
seen as necessary except for confronting these states when their actions
run contrary to U.S. interests. If the pattern leading up to the 2019
threat assessment is any indication, [we are likely to see a closer
alignment between this intensified threat narrative and a reinvigorated
mission to preserve the status quo,]{.underline} without any
self-awareness that this [policy]{.underline} may be
[self-defeating.]{.underline} America appears to be firmly in the "'Try
Harder!'" phase of strategic thinking, to use Legro's (2005, 37)
formulation. This is reflected in the Trump administration's National
Security Strategy (NSS), which appears to double down on the strategy of
pursuing American primacy, even to the point of direct confrontation
(Clarke and Ricketts 2017). By doing so, [these officials are neither
preparing American foreign policy]{.underline} nor its citizens [for a
revised geopolitical culture better suited to ensure a soft-landing of
unipolarity.]{.underline} Consequently, it is [likely that the United
States "won't see \[the end\] coming until it's too late,"]{.underline}
as Schweller (2011) speculated. Thus, a full accounting of why this
broader structural change is occurring will likely elude American
policymakers for the foreseeable future, leading to an [even weaker
United States and more fraught great power relations as the defining
features of the international system and America's place within
it.]{.underline}

#### Discourse of threats to critical infrastructure legitimize China as an existential threat.

[Western understandings of critical infrastructure (CI) play an
intrinsic role in the contemporary China Threat Discourse.]{.underline}
Examinations of foundational tenets of CI serve to illustrate how
understanding security requires widening the conversation in ways
traditional realists argue risk 'making both scholarship and state
policy incoherent' (Hameiri & Jones, 2015, p. 17). Leif C. Jensen states
that 'one must now "speak security" across a never-widening array of
thematic contexts' (2013, p. 94) and Hansen successfully demonstrates
through her 'case plus study' in Security as Practice how one can use a
post structural approach to security to widen the conversation without
making it boundless. Widening the ﬁeld allows us to explore discursive
relationships, including the 'complex of critical systems that are
vulnerable to catastrophic disruption' that constitute critical
infrastructure (Collier & Lakoﬀ, 2015, p. 20). Claudia Aradau notes that
'"[critical infrastructure" is]{.underline} generally considered [a new
coinage]{.underline} that goes back to US developments in the mid-1990s'
and CI [is 'predominantly about the role of things in society, their
functioning as well as their resilience']{.underline} (2010, p. 492). It
is essential to note that [CI refers both to public services as well as
private companies]{.underline} (Moteﬀ & Parfomak, 2004) because this
draws out the fact that [audience acceptance of security concerns is
necessary in order for governments to have ultimate domain over assets
that can]{.underline}, in essence, [be private.]{.underline} Although
lists of critical infrastructure can diﬀer signiﬁcantly -- for instance,
the US currently lists 16 sectors (Cybersecurity Information Sharing
Act, 2019), while Australia lists eight (Department of Home Aﬀairs,
2018) -- two assets are [central to any conception of critical
infrastructure: energy and telecoms/cyber]{.underline}. One's
[understanding of security inherently impacts how one reads critical
infrastructure]{.underline}. Buzan and Waever claim, '[security is what
actors make of it']{.underline} which suggests that out of a world of
potential threats [the 'security' label locates and prioritizes speciﬁc
threat(s) based on a set of criteria]{.underline} (2003, p. 48). This
article examines what actors perceive [security]{.underline} to be and
it [eschews notions of objective threats,]{.underline} aiming, instead,
to explore how security is represented in dominant American policy
discussions. Fundamentally, [the US reads security in the negative sense
in that value is placed on insulation from insecurity]{.underline}
(Gjorv, 2012, p. 836). This has become intrinsic to [notions of critical
infrastructure where security is deﬁned by resilience against
potentially catastrophic disruption to complex,]{.underline} large-scale
[systems]{.underline} (Collier & Lakoﬀ, 2015, p. 27). [Energy fears stem
from discontinuity so]{.underline} that 'deﬁnitions of energy security
[focus on the continuity of commodity supplies']{.underline} (Winzer,
2012). This is equally true with telecoms/cyber security wherein
'anxieties about risk and resilience' prioritize the maintenance of
secure information ﬂows (Herrington & Aldrich, 2013, p. 299).With a
focus on resilience, [critical infrastructure cannot be disentangled
from security,]{.underline} and [the way CI has been invoked in the US
is predicated on discursive practices that highlight negative
security]{.underline}. President [Obama stated that, 'no single issue is
as fundamental to our future as energy. America's dependence on oil is
one of the most serious threats that our nation has faced']{.underline}
(2009). By [linking the notion of 'threat' with that of
'energy,']{.underline} Obama's [claim]{.underline} not only [illustrates
the relationship between security of supply, oil scarcity, and US
perceptions of energy security,]{.underline} but it also, with audience
acceptance[, legitimizes them as security concerns]{.underline}.
Similarly, President Trump directly engaged in cyber securitization
stating that 'cyber threats are ever-evolving and may come from
sophisticated adversaries' (2018a). Trump not only twinned notions of
'threat' and 'cyber', but he ampliﬁed their potential impact by removing
any sunset clause through his statement that these threats are
ever-evolving. Moreover, taking into account the full context of his
wider discourse where China is habitually portrayed as a threat actor,
[Trump]{.underline} also [plays on audience fears by painting China as a
'sophisticated adversary']{.underline} (2018a). While speech-acts, like
these, do not securitize energy or cyber issues on their own, they
represent important steps within the translational process of
securitization as they contribute to a broader narrative. As security is
not an objective condition[, the way one reads energy is vital because
'energy itself has the potential to aﬀect substantially the way actors
and theorists think about security in general']{.underline} (Ciuta,
2010, p. 21). Knowledge of what telecoms and cybersecurity references is
also important because it 'is an integral component of all facets of
American life, including our economy and defense' (Trump, 2018b). While
such notions and their links to security are critical, they are elusive.
[Energy security is a notoriously diﬃcult notion to deﬁne]{.underline}
and there is much disagreement about what it is (Winzer,2012). For its
part, telecoms and cybersecurity have '\[i\]n recent years ... appeared
in a variety of contexts, many of which have little or no relationship
to the original meaning of the term' (Galinec et al., 2017, p. 273).
However, [the US negative security readings of energy security emphasize
scarcity and relative-gains with a priority given to the short-term
security of supply of non-renewable resources with an emphasis on
oil.]{.underline} Such [perceptions help to position China, as a growing
oil importer, in direct competition with the US.]{.underline} Relative
gains and competition underlies conceptions of telecoms and
cybersecurity as well, where 'cybersecurity is ... defending assets and
compromising the assets of adversaries' (Galinec et al., 2017, p. 273).
Reading the discourse surrounding the case studies exposes the [US
attempts to clearly defend its own assets and compromise those of
China.]{.underline} The cases are interesting in that [highly visible
American strategies to maintain its security by compromising Chinese
assets took place 'below the threshold' in]{.underline} the realm of
[politics]{.underline} (Lewis, 2018, p. 13). Examinations of CNOOC's
2005 bid for Unocal and the contemporary blacklisting of Huawei in the
US demonstrates how two [diﬀerent constructs of critical infrastructure
have been mobilized in very similar ways to reinforce the China threat
in America.]{.underline}

#### Use of the China threat normalizes an aggressive and militaristic response to all Chinese politics.

President Clinton stated that China's ascension to the World Trade
Organization (WTO)was 'the most signiﬁcant immediate action we can take
to move China in the right direction' (Mufson, 2018). Two decades later,
a US Trade Representative reﬂected the funda-mental change in tone
stating the US 'erred in supporting China's entry into the WTO on terms
that have proven to be ineﬀective in securing China's embrace of an
open, market-oriented trade regime' (Levy, 2018). [Rather than aligning
with US norms and values, China's newfound economic clout,]{.underline}
fronted by national champions including CNOOC and Huawei, [is
perceived]{.underline} by the US [to challenge]{.underline} to [the
status quo.]{.underline} The misinterpretation of Chinese actions was
predicated on assumptions of why Chinese 'normalization' should occur.
However, [when one asks whether or not China poses a threat to the US,
one is]{.underline} actually [asking the wrong question. The more
constructive question]{.underline}, and the one this article asks [is
how China has been produced as a threat actor by exploring how meanings
are produced and reproduced]{.underline}. This article examines how the
[China Threat Discourse positions China as an existential threat to US
interests,]{.underline} and how its [securitization has occurred
incrementally over time]{.underline}. It sidesteps the CS binary
approach to security in favour of more nuanced and cumulative approaches
to securitization. [Traditional security]{.underline} concerns,
[like]{.underline} freedom of navigation in [the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [or]{.underline} potential conﬂict
over the status of [Taiwan]{.underline}, certainly [add elements of
traditional realpolitik to Sino-American relations,]{.underline} but
[China has primarily been securitized at the level of normal
politics.]{.underline} China is [read as a non-status quo power that
poses an existential threat to US national security through the
exploitation of post-Cold War]{.underline} regimes and [governance
architecture. With a lack of crisis]{.underline}, or other inﬂection
point that would legitimize more extraordinary reactions, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [responds within the same
architecture]{.underline}, the end result being that [the space between
the normal political sphere and the security sphere has become
increasingly indistinct.]{.underline} Thus, [while China is portrayed
and read as a threat, its actions and US responses to them, while
remarkable, do not go 'beyond rules that would otherwise
bind']{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998, p. 5) even if they break
established norms. Examinations of Huawei's securitization become more
illuminating when examined alongside US responses to CNOOC a decade
earlier. US reactions to Huawei, ZTE, and CNOOC before them, demonstrate
a pattern of practices rather than a mere occurrence. Discourse analysis
of these events allows us to see not only how China has been read by 61
America in the ﬁrst two decades of the twenty-ﬁrst century, but also how
diﬀerent sectors of analysis gain importance. [Critical
infrastructure,]{.underline} hitherto a rather niche subject for
experts, has captured the public's attention and [has itself become
securitized.]{.underline} Increasingly nuanced [understandings of
securitization theory that privilege cumulative impact over the security
binary]{.underline} oﬀer added depth of understandings of the
contemporary Sino-American relationship and [allow us to clearly see
how]{.underline} CNOOC's 2005 bid for Unocal provided [a framework for
America's blacklisting]{.underline} of Huawei which [was used by US
elites to entrench China's position as a challenger to American
interests.]{.underline}

Consequences [[**US securitization towards China** is not simply a
declarative statement, but **has effects in
reality**]{.underline}]{.mark}, through decisions and actions aimed at
the identified dangers. This is related to the estimates China makes and
the actions it executes according to those estimates. For example, after
Pelosi's visit in 2022, this [country carried out a series of air and
naval exercises over the island as a way to "send a warning" to those
"seeking Taiwan
independence".]{.underline}[\[55\]](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-55)
The same occurred after the Taiwanese president's visit in 2023, with
three days of large-scale exercises in Taiwanese territorial waters and
airspace.[^\[56\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-56)
Since then, according to Ben Lewis, China has taken advantage of
Pelosi's visit to "permanently change the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait" by "normalizing violations of the Median Line" (once the de
facto air boundary between China and
Taiwan).[^\[57\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-57)
As Lewis mentions, "if an operation over Taiwan were to occur now, China
would have cover for the movement of large quantities of air assets as a
result of such
changes".[^\[58\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-58)
[The extent to which these fears are justified remains to be
determined.]{.underline} Undoubtedly, [**[China has strengthened its
military capability]{.mark}**, which has allowed it to take a more
belligerent stance on international law, backing up its territorial
claims, which have no legal basis, through the direct or indirect use of
armed force]{.underline}. Although [China is **[acting
illegally]{.mark}**]{.underline} in disputes in the South Sea, where [it
has [**failed to reach an agreement** with other countries]{.mark},
mainly due to its refusal to recognize their claims]{.underline}. As far
as Taiwan is concerned, the U.S. is violating that understanding with
China. However, [[**securitization** prevents Washington from
recognizing that its attitude is **encouraging Beijing to demonstrate
even greater assertiveness**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The use of force in
the Taiwanese case]{.underline} fits with what M. Taylor Fravel on its
use by China as an instrument of its foreign policy: it [uses it when it
seeks to rebut perceived challenges to its sovereignty claims in
territorial and maritime
disputes]{.underline}.[^\[59\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-59)
Its employment stems from a primarily political logic, as Michael Swaine
points out, since [Beijing can directly attack the island if it believes
that the US is about to abandon the tacit understanding that exists
between the two powers regarding
Taiwan]{.underline}.[^\[60\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-60)
According to Swaine, [such a US move would corner Beijing, forcing it to
use force, either to force Washington to change course or to try to
resolve the Taiwan problem once and for
all]{.underline}.[^\[61\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-61)
Conclusion This article has sought to study U.S. securitization without
ignoring the responsibility of Chinese actions that reinforce it. [In
the]{.underline} case of [the US, [the main **risk lies in exaggerating
the challenge posed by China,** **discarding diplomatic options** in
order to show firmness in the face of a powerful rival, **which could
trigger the conflict** it seeks to avoid]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Washington is right to want to maintain international order and prevent
China from using force to assert itself in the aforementioned
territorial disputes and with its support for Taiwan. [[Another **danger
lies in the reciprocal securitization**]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
increasingly characterizes this bilateral relationship, which [could
lead to a "**securitization dilemma**" between the two

This would be the preliminary step to the formation of the cycles of
action and reaction, typical of security crossroads, identified as one
of the main causal processes leading to wars, according to the academic
literature.[^\[63\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-63)
Agreeing with Hay, [[the main risk lies in the **constraint** that
**U.S. securitization imposes** on the options that China considers
viable]{.mark} vis-à-vis Washington's posture]{.underline}. Faced with
this situation, **[[China is forced to show a similar

In this regard, recent statements such as Biden's "not recognizing

or the lack of a large-scale Chinese response similar to the one
following Pelosi's visit after the Taiwanese elections in 2024, could
help to reduce
tensions.[^\[66\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-66)However[,

Conclusion This paper offers a novel contribution to the burgeoning
literature on Arctic security and provides an intervention to
understanding Canada's past and current interest in Arctic-focused
sensing technology, which has largely avoided critical investigation by
researchers. Specifically, the paper has argued that [**[technological
development for Arctic surveillance and security]{.mark}** **can be
historically situated within a long line of state-led
efforts**]{.underline} spanning the 20^th^century. Importantly, [this
strategic thinking [indicates the need to]{.mark} create and integrate
as many sensors as possible for all domain awareness to **[respond to
the proliferation of complex threats emerging across the
world]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Canada's Arctic is considered uniquely
vulnerable because of its extensive coastline and the intersection of
other trends, including climate change and geopolitical competition.
Sociotechnical imaginaries are collective visions of the future
interlaced with notions of scientific progress and advancement towards
achieving or navigating that future. Sociotechnical imaginaries provide
a unique framing mechanism for understanding how the Arctic was
historically presented as a future frontier to be tamed through
scientific progress within a broader lens of economic expansion and
modernisation that populated the early 20th century and post-war vision.
**[The Cold War entailed a more overtly securitised imaginary, whereas
the 21st-century Arctic entails different combinations of earlier
imaginaries within a contemporary field of expanded threats and
opportunities, ultimately culminating in the New Arctic]{.underline}**.
Others have already defined the New Arctic, but in this context, it is
the sociotechnical expression of multiple international and global
trends underpinned by a particular interaction of forces. Sociotechnical
imaginaries involve ontological and epistemological issues.
[**[State-led efforts towards enhancing]{.mark} sensing [abilities in
the Arctic represent a specific epistemic approach to an ontology of
complexity]{.mark}, which resists easy and direct intervention.** The
empirical material discussed in this paper is not exhaustive and should
not be seen as overly authoritative.]{.underline} However, as a whole,
that material demonstrates a consistent approach to understanding the
contemporary Arctic environment, and the interaction of efforts in the
marine and space domains illustrate this approach to Arctic security.
Thus, the Arctic imaginaries of the present echo some aspects of the
past. However, [while the imaginary of the past portrayed the Arctic
frontier as a space that would ultimately be conquered through science
and technological superiority, **[the contemporary frontier dissolves in
the face of science and technology because it is those same forces that
undermine the Arctic's environmental integrity and expose it to
extra-sovereign interventions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As with any
sociotechnical imaginary, imagined futures often encounter the limits of
technology, including its socioeconomic valorisation in the world. The
earlier sociotechnical imaginary of a 'Canada of the North' never
materialised for many reasons, including the technical and economic
realities of building northern infrastructure. It is within this wider
sociotechnical lens that sensing technologies gain their currency and
form, especially as they are an attractive policy goal that is malleable
to multiple and possibly contradictory sociotechnical imaginaries of the
Arctic's future. [Sociotechnical imaginaries thus amount to more than
simple representations and (re)produce relations of power that
circumscribe the dominant ontological foundations of the
world.]{.underline} Consequently, the New Arctic is shaping forms of
state intervention and governance. This paper has argued that [**[the
Arctic is]{.mark} a region considered within a relational worldview
[premised on complexity and risk]{.mark}, [which makes future threats
increasingly challenging to predict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Consequently, [the New Arctic requires techniques of sovereign power and
governance that can make sense of this environment. **These [techniques
depend on technological innovation]{.mark}** related to advances in
sensing capability **[because the sheer complexity of this environment
overwhelms human cognition]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This paper
demonstrates how the New Arctic is a sociotechnical imaginary shaping
[the development of sensing technologies designed for sovereign
enforcement through the example of space-based surveillance capabilities
and the use of intelligence applications]{.underline} like the BlueHawk
product. While [the Arctic represents a unique space where these
technologies are being developed and deployed, **[the proliferation of
sensing represents a much larger trend in geostrategic
thinking]{.mark}.**]{.underline} However, **[[current efforts are only
possible within the contemporary security landscape's broader social and
political context]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A recent evolution in that
thinking flows from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and involves the
acceleration of debates on what it means for Arctic governance. This
issue speaks to the re-internationalisation of Arctic security alongside
its globalisation, intensifying the complexity and intensity of those
issues. Future research should engage with this trend more
substantially, particularly as Canada's focus on Arctic sensing aligns
with US and NORAD strategic thinking for continental defence and as
sensing technology intersects with other developments in artificial
intelligence and quantum. Overall, the [**[cases]{.mark} discussed here
[offer]{.mark} one example of [a much larger trend]{.mark} in defence
thinking, and [technological development]{.mark} centred on integrating
global sensor architectures [to pre-emptively secure the Arctic of today

## Impact/Turns Case

### **[Disease]{.underline}**

#### Securitization of health crises hinders the ability to solve real health crises by discouraging cooperation and putting global interests of the rich before individuals.

[Securitization encourages conceptualizing health crises as external
threats that need to be neutralized rather than mutual problems that
need to be solved]{.underline} I posit that [securitization
undermines]{.underline} such [efforts.]{.underline} First, [the
traditional theory of securitization creates an [us versus
them](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2346.2010.00934.x/abstract)
paradigm, while effective GHG from a global community perspective
necessitates simply an us.]{.underline} [Securitization only promotes
cooperation insofar as maintaining the security and stability of
powerful states without regard to whether such actions promote the
health and well being of the individuals in afflicted
states.]{.underline} In other words[, securitization encourages
conceptualizing health crises as external threats that need to be
neutralized rather than mutual problems that need to be
solved.]{.underline} \[figure removed\] There is not a clear consensus
on the definition of an existential health threat [Securitization
presents a second obstacle for effective GHG because there is not a
clear consensus on the definition of an existential health threat or a
mechanism to enforce the securitization of a threat on an international
scale.]{.underline} The [powerful players that set the securitization
agenda naturally highlight infectious diseases,]{.underline} which are
likely to cross borders[, regardless of whether this reflects the global
burden of disease.]{.underline} However, securitization still depends on
the compliance of affected states, which might be reluctant to fall in
line if it negatively impacts other sectors such as the authority of the
government or the economy. Thus, it similarly allows for the
desecuritization of pressing health challenges, which could be equally
detrimental to the pursuit of global health. Perhaps most troubling,
[securitization]{.underline}, by definition[, involves reacting to
crises rather than a creating a state of preparedness. In the case of
many global health challenges, prevention through capacity building and
systems strengthening is key to finding sustainable and scalable
solutions to protect the world's vulnerable populations.]{.underline}
Therefore, adopting a strategy of reaction limits the ability of GHG to
promote and protect health effectively on a global scale. \[figure
removed\] Securitization represents a compelling strategy to grab the
attention However, securitization represents a compelling strategy to
grab the attention and, thus, the money of wealthier states in order to
divert more resources towards tackling urgent global health challenges.
As such, proponents of securitization could contend that this point
outweighs any disadvantages if an alternative does not exist to mobilize
these necessary resources and political will. But is this argument
really justifiable if these [resources are devoted so as to keep the
wealthy safe at the expense of ignoring, and sometimes exacerbating, the
underlying determinants that drive disease among the poor]{.underline}?
I do not believe it is. Instead, I contend that an International Health
Systems Fund offers a potential alternative that could better achieve
communal progress in health by creating an infrastructure to serve the
enduring needs of vulnerable populations and meet the demands of the
global community during health crises.

[The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the rise of China have
catalyzed a powerful \"[securitization]{.mark}\" narrative in the
West]{.underline}, which has, in turn, [[influenced academic freedom and
intellectual discourse]{.mark}, especially in subjects [concerning
Russia and China studies]{.mark}, security (policy) studies, and
international relations]{.underline}. The narrowing of academic freedom
is partly driven by political, public and [diplomatic
pressure]{.underline} on universities to align with government stances
against Russia and China. This [[overwhelming securitization
environment]{.mark} can and [has]{.mark} not only [stifled]{.mark}
[research]{.mark} critical of Western strategies (incl NATO\'s role) in
the region but has forbidden working together with Russian
[academics]{.mark} and [limited]{.mark} academic [collaboration]{.mark}
with China. Consequently, we are losing insights into the trajectories
of Russian and Chinese societies. We in the academic community face a
paradox]{.underline}: while universities should do critical work on our
own societies and policies and advocate for freedom of speech and
critique authoritarianism abroad, we are facing a new normative
environment where [open domestic discourse are threatened]{.underline}
to be [silenced under the pressure of securitization
discourse]{.underline}. Rising Tide of Securitization Narrative In this
article we utilize [securitization framework as a process in which
academic work with [Russia]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [China]{.mark} are
[treated]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [security]{.mark} [threats]{.mark} and
therefore should be [banned]{.mark} [or]{.mark} [restricted]{.mark} and
align with government policies]{.underline}. We can pinpoint certain
moments and processes that have triggered and are feeding into
securitization framing processes in our Western societies. It was since
Russia\'s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the continuation of Russia's
war of aggression on Ukraine that began in February in 2022 and China's
fast technological advancements and becoming a genuine economic
super-power challenging the position of US, when [[Western
nations]{.mark} have increasingly [label]{.mark}led [Russia and China as
security threats]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This rising tide of a
securitization narrative has become the dominating line in
policy-making, news media, public perception, labeling both Russia and
China as challenging and threatening our Western security, economic
rights and order, and even fundamental values and
practices.]{.underline} Restrictions on and consequences of Russian and

Western [governments]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [impose]{.mark}
[[direct]{.mark} and indirect [restrictions]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
[research]{.mark} concerning Russia and China.]{.underline} Following
the Russian war on Ukraine, the European Union Commission decided to
suspend cooperation with Russian entities [in]{.mark} research,

### Climate:

#### Climate securitization increases environmental degradation -- it creates a militarized response that guarantees an increase in resource consumption

DF

Yet there are multiple problems in this gendered "climate security"
framing, as well as [dangers with the overall securitization of the
climate crisis]{.underline}. First, it [centers]{.underline} a vision of
the world from [the perspective of Northern elites]{.underline}, which
[locates climate change threats as coming from "out
there]{.underline}"---from its victims, from outsiders, [from people in
Global South countries]{.underline} where the violence that threatens
"stability" will supposedly occur, and from where displaced people will
supposedly be trying to flee[---instead of correctly locating the
threats to the planet as coming from the Global North countries,
militaries, and corporations that are actually]{.underline} the most
[responsible]{.underline} for it. Second, it is a framing that [leads to
a militarized response, which justifies increases in budgets of military
and other "security" institutions, capturing the resources we need to
solve the climate and wider ecological crises]{.underline}. It further
[compounds the problem by fostering and legitimating the expansion of
military training and operations---thereby increasing their vast use of
fossil fuels and other forms of environmental degradation---making the
climate and eco-crises worse,]{.underline} not better. Third, it sets up
[preservation of the status quo as the goal]{.underline}, whereas
[dealing with the climate crisis requires massive changes to the status
quo.]{.underline} This is especially so if the countries that are least
responsible for carbon emissions, and where those most affected live,
are ever going to get access to the resources they need to respond.
Fourth, and perhaps the most devastating, is that, [if our intention is
to head off the worst of climate change and even try to reverse it,
framing the climate crisis as a security crisis completely misdirects
our attention]{.underline}. The [climate crisis is not a crisis of
security; it is a crisis of extractivist capitalism]{.underline}, an
economic system that [incentivizes the exploitation of natural
resources]{.underline} as if they were unlimited and "externalizes" the
environmental costs of production---[from pollution to the release of
greenhouse gases.]{.underline} Through its dependence on fossil fuels
for cheap energy and industrial agriculture that overexploits soil and
water supplies, [extractivist capitalism champions growth at all costs,
including the destruction of the environment.]{.underline} Its
neoliberal insistence on "liberating" markets and denouncing regulation
and collective action has made it impossible to take the actions needed
to halt climate breakdown.

The Rationality of Ontological Security Creating a decision-making model
with a large N sample size can provide enough data to inductively derive
hypotheses for certain events given a particular set of conditions.
[However, this study aims to understand Russia's decision-making rules
that it employs to satisfy its ontological security needs.
**[Ontological security needs are not met through the direct action of
the actor]{.mark}**. Instead, **[the actor seeks ontological security
reflexively]{.mark}**, as Steele proposes, or socially defined, as
Mitzen argues. In either case, ontological security does not come from
direct decision-making. Much like an emotion, which, as mentioned,
**is** more of **an intervening variable, so is ontological
security**]{.underline}. For example, giving money to someone on the
street can be considered irrational in the most strict sense. Money, it
can be argued, is not earned to give it away to strangers. Nevertheless,
people give money away to strangers every day. Giving away money earned
by working a job means that the money cannot be used for which a person
earned it. However, people experience an emotion that results from the
act of giving money away to a stranger in need. The action is to give
away money. The outcome is two- fold. The person giving away money has
less, but the person in need has more. The amount people give away does
not usually involve risk to themselves or their families; therefore, the
financial impact is minimal. However, the effect on the person in need
is significant. Therefore, the person in need may be able to eat that
day, and knowing that makes the person who gave the128 money away feel
some type of satisfying emotion. [The emotion is not the direct outcome
of the action but an indirect result. The same is true for ontological
security[. **A state seeking to satisfy its ontological
security**]{.mark} **needs [decides on actions that it believes
will]{.mark} likely [result in a particular outcome.]{.mark}** The
outcome of the state's decision-making may elicit a sense of ontological
security. For example, when Russia decided to militarize the Arctic, the
outcome was that the U.S. and NATO responded by increasing their Arctic
military capabilities and force posture. When Russia threatens to invade
Ukraine, the result is that the U.S. and NATO respond by discussing
options, showing support for Ukraine's foreign policy decisions as a
sovereign state.]{.underline} When Russia steps in to support Syria's Al
Asaad regime and deploys forces to support the government forces, the
U.S. and its coalition partners must coordinate operations directly with
Russia to avoid unwanted contact and potential conflict[**[. Russia's
actions are, through the neorealist lens, rational acts that any
state]{.mark} under the given systemic conditions [would take,]{.mark}**
given its material strength. However, **[through the ontological
security lens, Russia's actions notably solicit a response from the U.S.
and NATO]{.mark}**. The U.S. and NATO response is the outcome Russia
seeks because it helps confirm its status as a great power. The realist
explanations for Russia's actions presuppose Russia as a
power-maximizing actor. As previously mentioned, realism's
power-maximizing goals can partially explain Russia's actions in the
Arctic. However, a counter-argument can be made that Russia's
militarization of the Arctic is not power-maximizing.]{.underline}
Russia improved military facilities, increased the capabilities of
strategic airbases, and even built several new garrisons in the very
high north. Moscow has invested heavily in Arctic defenses but at the
cost of other options that might have proved more efficient efforts to
maximize Russia's hard power. As a result, Moscow's investments in
Arctic military capabilities may have diminishing returns.129 If the
U.S. and NATO were to end up in a military conflict with Russia, it
would likely be due to something outside of the Arctic. [**[If
escalation were to occur, the Arctic would likely be relevant as a
region of ballistic missile volleys.]{.mark}**]{.underline} It is
difficult to imagine a scenario where NATO forces, other than the border
between Norway and Russia, would use the Arctic as an avenue of approach
or seek to seize territory. Therefore, if we regard Russia as a rational
actor, we must assume that Moscow is pursuing goals beyond solely power
maximizing. Using game theory methodology can assist in determining if
ontological security is motivating Russia's actions in the Arctic. If we
seek to further understand Russia's militarization of the Arctic in
ontological security terms instead of realist terms, we should specify
different actors' policy choices and preferences in that case. 230
Duncan Snidal argues that game theory can be thought of as a theory of
international politics by assuming a set of empirical assumptions.
However, he points out that arguing over whether states are rational
actors does not require the assumption that states are solely power
maximizers, nor does the state need to be assumed to be the actor. If
the rational actor is assumed to be a state and a power maximizer by
convention, game theory becomes an instrument of realism. Snidal argues
that while treating an actor as rational in game theory is necessary,
"the game-theoretic approach is not coincident with Realism."231 As
previously discussed, the realist explanation alone does not
sufficiently explain Russia's relatively recent Arctic defense
expenditure. If Russia has other motivations than power maximizing and
is assumed to be a rational actor, another utility must exist for
building military infrastructure and capabilities in the Arctic. [As
stated above, Russia seeks to achieve and maintain great power status
and be recognized]{.underline} as a 230. Duncan Snidal, \"The Game
Theory of International Politics.\" *World Politics*, 1985, p. 35. 231.
Snidal, \"The Game Theory of International Politics,\" p. 35.130 great
power. However, providing significant evidence to demonstrate that
Russia's Arctic militarization is motivated by identity is problematic.
Therefore, it is necessary to establish a formal process for determining
the likelihood that identity, and ontological security needs, are a
source of Russia's motivation. The Russian defense policymakers, much
like any policymaker, are likely to be uncertain about the action they
undertake and the likelihood that those actions will lead to the
outcomes they seek. [**If [seeking to maximize ontological
security]{.mark}, Russian [policymakers will]{.mark} need to [choose a
set of actions based on their belief in the state of the
world]{.mark}**. If Russia seeks great power status and prestige among
the world's great powers, it must also perceive a specific state of the
world. The probability that a particular state of the world exists
represents the policymakers' degree of belief about the likelihood of
that state existing compared to other potential states.]{.underline} The
probability is subjective, which means that the firmer the Russian
policymakers' belief about the likelihood of a particular state, the
more likely the policymaker is to believe that state is the actual state
of the world.232 As conditions change and policymakers receive new or
updated information about the world, policymakers may update their
belief about the likelihood that a particular state of the world exists.
For example, suppose Russian policymakers see the state of the
geopolitical world as one in which the U.S. and western European powers
attempt to contain Russia. However[, if Russia perceives itself to be on
equal footing as a great power, then its policymakers may believe that
Russia must assert greater power to demonstrate its continued global
presence as a great power.]{.underline}

#### The need to affirm ontological security causes nuclear war -- states project power to maintain a sense of selfhood, which results in security dilemmas.

Conclusion [[Rather than focusing solely on]{.mark} the **[external
security threats]{.mark}** that states face from one another[, a]{.mark}
more **[comprehensive theory of the security dilemma must account for
the internal security challenges]{.mark}** emanating from within states.
**[Internal insecurities]{.mark}** can **[catalyze security dilemmas
with other states]{.mark}.**]{.underline} States that suffer from
internal insecu- rity related to the weak legitimacy of their political
re- gimes, state institutions, national identity, and borders will fear
that these vulnerabilities are being exploited by outside powers. As a
result[, [they]{.underline}]{.mark} [will begin to [adopt]{.mark} inter-
nal and external [policies to push back]{.mark} against the perceived
intervention. **[These policies will threaten the intervening states,
setting off the]{.mark}** **familiar cycle of response and
counter-response that characterizes the [security dilemma]{.mark}**. A
world where **the most prominent potential chal- lengers to US hegemony,
[China and Russia]{.mark}, are developing states that exhibit internal
vulnerabilities,** [present]{.mark}s [a]{.mark} par- ticularly
**[difficult problem for policymakers that want to avoid security
dilemmas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. States can try to address the fears
caused by the external dimension of the security dilemma by adopting
security policies that signal their defensive intentions and thereby
reassure other states. Trying to institute these kinds of policies is
difficult enough in the real world. [**[Policies of reassurance come
with great risks]{.mark}**, as they leave states that adopt them
vulnerable to attack by aggressive powers (Montgomery 2006). The picture
is further complicated by the internal dimension of the secu- rity
dilemma, as **[fears about the intentions of other states]{.mark}**
[are]{.mark} not necessarily [generated by]{.mark} other states'
behavior but by **[the internal vulnerabilities themselves.]{.mark}**
Western states may be able to assuage some fears that rise out of
internal vulnerabilities]{.underline}. They could, for instance, affirm
their commitments to the territorial status quo and be careful to avoid
encouraging the separatist aspirations of disgruntled minorities.
However, when it comes to poli- cies that threaten the legitimacy of
authoritarian regimes, the situation is much more complicated. Even
policies that may have the most benign motives behind them, such as
American and European efforts to promote democracy and human rights, may
be misinterpreted as efforts to destabi- lize and take advantage of
internal weaknesses. Western leaders must recognize that democracy and
human rights promotion can give rise to acute security concerns in the
target states that can exacerbate conflict and increase geo- political
conflict in cases where these states are great powers, such as China and
Russia. This does not necessar- ily mean that the West needs to abandon
its commitment to the advancement of these core principles and values.
Advocates of democracy and human rights can tailor their efforts to make
them less threatening. Rather than promot- ing policies that give rise
to fears of "regime change" and internal destabilization, they can
promote more policies that work toward gradual change by strengthening
domes- by guest on June 5, 2016 http://jogss.oxfordjournals.org/
Downloaded from124 Catalyzing Conflict: The Internal Dimension of the
Security Dilemma tic political institutions, property rights, and the
rule of law. These kinds of policies may ultimately be more effec- tive
than the current agenda, which has emphasized free elections and
political and human rights. Some scholars of democratization argue that
the gradual development of lib- eral values, institutions, and practices
may lead to the kind of deeper cultural and societal transformations
that will prepare these societies to eventually adopt effective and sus-
tainable democracies (Zakaria 2003, Chapter 3; Pan 2006). Moreover,
these kinds of programs could very well be welcomed by target states'
leadership, as they would strengthen domestic institutions and help
their societies ad- vance toward political and economic modernization.
The above discussion suggests that the internal dimen- sion of the
security dilemma is most acute when it involves mixed dyads of
authoritarian and democratic states. Authoritarian states are
particularly vulnerable to issues of regime legitimacy, and democracies
have a predilection for externalizing their domestic norms and looking
to spread them worldwide. At stake is not only each side's physical
security but also their ontological security: each actor's need to
establish predictability in its relationships to the outside world and a
stable sense of social identities (Gid- dens 1991). [The growing
literature on [**ontological security** explores the ways in
which]{.mark} actors, including [states]{.mark}, struggle to **[maintain
their sense of identity and selfhood]{.mark}** (Wendt 1994; Mitzen 2006;
Steele 2008). It is readily apparent that **[democracies challenge the
ontological security of authori- tarian regimes]{.mark}** through their
promotion of democracy and human rights---and through the demonstration
effects of democratic governance and popular sovereignty. However, it is
less well understood that **[authoritarian regimes also threaten the
ontological security of democracies]{.mark}**, as their very existence
tacitly challenges the ideological basis of their legitimacy: that is,
that democracy is the only morally just and truly effective form of
government. [States, like individuals, **need to feel secure in who they
are**]{.mark} and to establish a sense of social purpose. [Their **sense
of self**]{.mark} (or identity) [is]{.mark} profoundly **[shaped by
their relationship to other actors]{.mark}**, par- ticularly those they
see as being in opposition to themselves. **[Authoritarian-democratic
dyads]{.mark}** may therefore **[face an additional hurdle to solving
security dilemmas]{.mark}**, as **[the perpetuation of conflict between
them is integral to the ontological security of both sides]{.mark}** and
**[critical for the legitimacy of domestic]{.mark}** **political
institutions and [regimes]{.mark}** (Mitzen 2006). Thus, [**the quest
for ontological security** can]{.mark} lead states to adopt policies
that **[increase security competition]{.mark}** and thereby **[decrease
their]{.mark}** actual **[physical security]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
present study focuses on the physical dimensions of security, on the way
in which the weak legitimacy of national and state institu- tions can
act as a catalyst for security competition between states. The
literature on ontological security is also highly relevant to the issue
of legitimacy. **[Maintaining a coherent sense of identity and purpose
is essential to states' legitimacy in the eyes of domestic publics as
well as other states]{.underline}**. Exploring the ontological
dimensions of the security di- lemma thus represents a promising area
for future research that may help us develop a better understanding of
how states establish and maintain legitimacy. Moreover, it may also
allow us to link security dilemma theorizing with theo- ries of
democratic peace, something that surveys of the secu- rity dilemma
literature have found lacking (Tang 2009). Some scholars believe that
today's emerging powers' internal vulnerabilities will help keep the
peace by hinder- ing their ability to project power on the world stage
(Nye 2011). But, ironically, this may not be the case if these states
believe that their internal weaknesses are being ex- ploited by other
states. [These [**states may have internal weaknesses,** but]{.mark}
they are still great powers. **[They have the ability to]{.mark}**
project their state power externally beyond their borders and to
**[threaten the security of other states]{.mark}**, includ- ing **[with
their nuclear weapons. This can lead to the rise of security
dilemmas]{.mark} in their relations with other great powers,
[exacerbating security competition]{.mark} and [creating more
instability and conflict]{.mark}** in world politics.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC's realist quest for power risks illegitimizing non-actor based threats that turn their impact.

The **[predominance of realism is evident in the studies on actor-based
threat images]{.underline}**.6 Ever since Thucydides' analysis of the
Peloponnesian wars, a history of realist theorizing can be traced in the
works of a number of significant thinkers, such as Machiavelli, Hobbes,
and Clausewitz. Since the mid-1900s' various [realist assumptions have
set the research agenda for security studies]{.underline}, from
classical realism, with its [focus on **human nature's inherent quest
for power**]{.underline} (Morgenthau, 1948; Waltz, 1959) to structural
realism/neorealism, which stresses the roles of states in the anarchic
system (Mearsheimer, 2001, 1990; Walt, 1987; Waltz, 1979). The Cold War
era became the heyday of neorealism, as the structure of the
international system and the security priorities by the two superpowers
called for work on issues like power balancing, security dilemmas,
deterrence and alliances. Although the international structure and the
issues that are deemed important have changed since the beginning of the
1990s, realist works still are quite dominant in IR (see, for example,
Schweller, 2004; Paul, 2005; 2006; Posen, 2006; for recent review essays
on current realist research, see Layne, 2009; Nexon, 2009). This means
that the [traditional and well-established definition of national
security]{.underline} -- set almost twenty years ago by Walt in his
seminal article -- [still prevails]{.underline}. According to this
definition, national security concerns the phenomenon of war, and
security studies should thus focus on "the study of the threat, use, and
control of military force" (Walt, 1991: 212). In this line of
argumentation, the [inclusion of issues beyond the purely military
dimension "runs the risk of expanding 'security studies'
excessively]{.underline} /\.../ \[and would\] [destroy its
**intellectual coherence**]{.underline}" (Walt, 1991: 213). In other
words[, issues like **environmental hazards, migration, or epidemics**
are not viewed as legitimate problem areas to explore within a realist
framework of national security.]{.underline} Instead, the [realist focus
is on threats linked to antagonistic actors and on strategies to manage
these threats.]{.underline} This view is mirrored by contemporary
neorealist research as well, with studies employing [realist theoretical
assumptions mainly investigate phenomena like the balance of power
and/or balance of threats]{.underline} (Wivel, 2008; Yetiv, 2006; Ross,
2006; Posen, 2006), the security dilemma (Holslag, 2009), and power
asymmetry (Paul, 2006). As a natural result of these foci, the [units of
analysis are great powers and regional powers]{.underline} -- such as
the [United States, China, India, Pakistan and the EU]{.underline} --
and the dyadic relationships between them or with other, smaller
states.7 Even in more recently developed forms of realism, such as
neoclassical realism which incorporates domestic variables into the
analysis of foreign policy behavior (Schweller, 2004), the **[threats
investigated are linked to antagonistic actors.]{.underline}** It is not
only realist works, however, that view this linkage between threat
images and external actors as more or less given. Studies employing
other theoretical points of departure, such as various constructivist
approaches, also often focus on empirical cases where the [perceived
threat stems from an 'other'.]{.underline} This 'other' can be [another
state]{.underline} (Rousseau, 2006), [or terrorist group]{.underline}s
(Meyer, 2009; Hulsse & Spencer, 2008). The latter, in particular, has
become the [issue to investigate in security studies in the decade after
9/11]{.underline}. This is true for all theoretical disciplines and
there has been an [upsurge of studies analyzing various aspects of the
terrorist phenomenon in relation to national security.]{.underline}8
Many recent studies have investigated the [psychological effects of
terrorism on a state's perceived sense of security]{.underline} and how
the terrorist threat image influences foreign policy (Gadarian, 2010;
Aly & Green, 2010; Shambaugh, Matthew, Silver, et al., 2010; Fettweis,
2010; Meyer 2009; Huddy, Feldman & Weber, 2007). Others have focused on
counterterrorism strategies (Adler, 2010; Hoffman, 2009), some have
[investigated whether these]{.underline} [strategies are exaggerated
(]{.underline}Wolfendale, 2007), [and]{.underline} some have [even
whether terrorism is a national security threat at all]{.underline}
(Mueller, 2006). It can thus be argued that [terrorism]{.underline}, if
not replacing the traditional state-origination of threat images, has
[at least positioned itself at the forefront of the actor-based
category]{.underline}. Although it has been argued that there are some
[differences between threat images coming from states and
terrorists]{.underline} in a number of regards, such as,
counter-strategies (Adler, 2010), they share enough resemblances to be
justifiably placed in the same category (see Essay I). Turning to
non-actor based threat images, [realist works are basically absent since
realists tend to examine military issues and do not consider issues like
epidemics to be national security concerns]{.underline}. However, [non-
actor based threat images]{.underline} are analyzed by works from
several other theoretical disciplines which [view them as being of equal
importance to actor-based threats]{.underline}. This category is,
however, fairly new, and issues like **[epidemics, environmental
hazards, and migration]{.underline}** were more or [less ignored in
security studies]{.underline} until the early 1990s. One notable
exception to this were seminal works by Buzan and Ullman that attempted
to broaden the security concept as early as 1983 (Buzan, 1983; Ullman,
1983). Although security in the midst of the Cold War was very much
linked to counter-balancing activities by the two superpowers, Buzan
nevertheless argued that the concept of national security should not be
limited to the military sphere, but could also be economic or ecologic
in nature. A threat image can also affect different levels of analysis,
not only the state level (Buzan, 1983). Ullman emphasized the importance
for security theorists and practitioners alike to recognize non-military
threats images since a sole focus on the military "conveys a profoundly
false image of reality" (Ullman, 1983: 129). This suggests that issues
like [climate change and epidemics, which can threaten several different
sectors and societal levels, should belong to the sphere of national
security.]{.underline} It is generally understood that the [non-actor
based threat images are distinguished from actor-based
issues]{.underline} in that they, for instance, "cross state borders but
generally [cannot be linked directly to the foreign policies or behavior
of other states]{.underline}" (Matthew and Shambaugh, 1998: 163).
Nonetheless, like actor-based conditions, [they threaten "the core
values of national security]{.underline}: territorial integrity and
political independence; preservation of the well-being, freedom, and
property of citizens; and national culture" (Matthew and Shambaugh,
1998: 163). It is sometimes even claimed that they have [superseded
traditional military issues]{.underline} in importance since "few of
today's dangers have the character of direct military aggression
emanating from a clearly defined sovereign source" (Brower and Chalk,
2003: 3; also Heinecken, 2003; Price-Smith, 2002; Prins, 2004).
[Non-actor based threat images can actually be viewed as
more]{.underline} threatening than actor based conditions since there is
no sender, or identifiable actor, behind them: "There is **[nothing as
dangerous or terrifying as the unknown]{.underline}**" (Johnson, 1994:
12). Apart from offering a broadening of the security concept, the non-
actor-based threat images also differ from actor based approaches by
investigating other levels of analysis than the national. Human
security, for instance, focuses on issues that demand international
collective action, and calls for a broadening and deepening of the
security concept through paying attention to the everyday security
concerns of individuals rather than the traditional security threats of
high politics (United Nations Development Programme, 1994). Although
still popular in policy circles, human security has been criticized by
academics for being too vast, lacking a proper definition, and having an
unclear unit of analysis. These problems lessen its analytical value
(Buzan, 2004; Paris, 2004, 2001). Similarly, global security (Prins,
1995), which investigates transnational, [non-actor based threat
images]{.underline} at the international level of analysis also [faces
problems with clarifying the unit of analysis]{.underline}. 9 A number
of works have focused on different non-actor based [threat images such
as the environment]{.underline} (Herman & Treverton, 2009; Borgerson,
2008; Klare, 2007; Campbell, 2008[) and migration]{.underline}
(Huysmans, 2000; 2006). Of particular interest to this dissertation is
the previous research on [epidemics as issues of national security.
Infectious disease, such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, is
claimed to be one of the most central security issues]{.underline} in
the post Cold-war security era; although, as argued by Price-Smith, it
is by no means a new threat image, rather , it is "one of humanity's
oldest and direst enemies" (Price-Smith, 2002: 3). In other words, the
distinction between 'old' and 'new' is neither useful nor accurate.
Instead, [infectious disease]{.underline}, like global warming, is a
[non-actor based threat image]{.underline} since it is not the
individuals that carry an infection that constitute the threat image,
but rather the virus itself (Elbe, 2006). Unlike climate change,
however, the [direct effects of infectious disease on mortality are much
more evident.]{.underline} Together with the [long-term
effects]{.underline} they can have on the social, political, economic
and military spheres, epidemics are perhaps the [most alarming of the
non-actor based security conditions]{.underline}. Epidemics are thus a
[central concern]{.underline} not only at the individual level, but [to
national security]{.underline}: [The infectious disease that is most
commonly recognized as possible threat is HIV/AIDS]{.underline}.
However, viewing HIV/AIDS or other epidemics as threat images can be
controversial; not only from a realist point of departure, but also by
those who believe that moving this issue into the security sphere is
actually counter-productive for managing the epidemic in a proper and
efficient manner. Nevertheless, many argue that AIDS can affect a
greater number of different security sectors than any other non-actor
based issue and therefore is a self-evident matter for national
security. First, it can [affect the economic sector, due to decreased
productivity and strains in the work force population]{.underline}
(McInnes and Lee, 2006). Second, it can [affect the social
sector,]{.underline} due to particular demographic effects (AIDS often
eliminates the middle-aged hump of a population). Third, it can be
[linked to political insecurity as "infectious disease prevalence levels
show a significant **negative empirical association with measures of
state capacity"**]{.underline} (Price-Smith, 2002: 172). Finally, there
is a particular [link between AIDS and the military,]{.underline} as
"the [average infection rates of soldiers are significantly higher than
equivalent age groups in the regular civilian population]{.underline}"
(Singer, 2002: 147). In turn, this means that "**t[he state's ability to
stabilize, defend, or protect their citizens weakens]{.underline}**
/\.../ \[which\] **[provides fertile ground for conflict and war, or
exploitation by dissident groups]{.underline}**" (Heinecken, 2003: 282).

"Insecurity is What States Make of It: US Securitization of China" CEEEP
https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en)

Consequences [[**US securitization towards China** is not simply a
declarative statement, but **has effects in
reality**]{.underline}]{.mark}, through decisions and actions aimed at
the identified dangers. This is related to the estimates China makes and
the actions it executes according to those estimates. For example, after
Pelosi's visit in 2022, this [country carried out a series of air and
naval exercises over the island as a way to "send a warning" to those
"seeking Taiwan
independence".]{.underline}[\[55\]](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-55)
The same occurred after the Taiwanese president's visit in 2023, with
three days of large-scale exercises in Taiwanese territorial waters and
airspace.[^\[56\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-56)
Since then, according to Ben Lewis, China has taken advantage of
Pelosi's visit to "permanently change the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait" by "normalizing violations of the Median Line" (once the de
facto air boundary between China and
Taiwan).[^\[57\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-57)
As Lewis mentions, "if an operation over Taiwan were to occur now, China
would have cover for the movement of large quantities of air assets as a
result of such
changes".[^\[58\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-58)
[The extent to which these fears are justified remains to be
determined.]{.underline} Undoubtedly, [**[China has strengthened its
military capability]{.mark}**, which has allowed it to take a more
belligerent stance on international law, backing up its territorial
claims, which have no legal basis, through the direct or indirect use of
armed force]{.underline}. Although [China is **[acting
illegally]{.mark}**]{.underline} in disputes in the South Sea, where [it
has [**failed to reach an agreement** with other countries]{.mark},
mainly due to its refusal to recognize their claims]{.underline}. As far
as Taiwan is concerned, the U.S. is violating that understanding with
China. However, [[**securitization** prevents Washington from
recognizing that its attitude is **encouraging Beijing to demonstrate
even greater assertiveness**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The use of force in
the Taiwanese case]{.underline} fits with what M. Taylor Fravel on its
use by China as an instrument of its foreign policy: it [uses it when it
seeks to rebut perceived challenges to its sovereignty claims in
territorial and maritime
disputes]{.underline}.[^\[59\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-59)
Its employment stems from a primarily political logic, as Michael Swaine
points out, since [Beijing can directly attack the island if it believes
that the US is about to abandon the tacit understanding that exists
between the two powers regarding
Taiwan]{.underline}.[^\[60\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-60)
According to Swaine, [such a US move would corner Beijing, forcing it to
use force, either to force Washington to change course or to try to
resolve the Taiwan problem once and for
all]{.underline}.[^\[61\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-61)
Conclusion This article has sought to study U.S. securitization without
ignoring the responsibility of Chinese actions that reinforce it. [In
the]{.underline} case of [the US, [the main **risk lies in exaggerating
the challenge posed by China,** **discarding diplomatic options** in
order to show firmness in the face of a powerful rival, **which could
trigger the conflict** it seeks to avoid]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Washington is right to want to maintain international order and prevent
China from using force to assert itself in the aforementioned
territorial disputes and with its support for Taiwan. [[Another **danger
lies in the reciprocal securitization**]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
increasingly characterizes this bilateral relationship, which [could
lead to a "**securitization dilemma**" between the two
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}
^[\[62\]](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-62)^
This would be the preliminary step to the formation of the cycles of
action and reaction, typical of security crossroads, identified as one
of the main causal processes leading to wars, according to the academic
literature.[^\[63\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-63)
Agreeing with Hay, [[the main risk lies in the **constraint** that
**U.S. securitization imposes** on the options that China considers
viable]{.mark} vis-à-vis Washington's posture]{.underline}. Faced with
this situation, **[[China is forced to show a similar
attitude]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as it did with the exercises following
the visits described above. Therefore, [[such an interactive cycle may
end up **reinforcing negative attitudes and perceptions**, characterized
by the **constant search** to show firmness]{.mark} towards the
other]{.underline}.[^\[64\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-64)
In this regard, recent statements such as Biden's "not recognizing
Taiwanese
independence"[^\[65\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-65)
or the lack of a large-scale Chinese response similar to the one
following Pelosi's visit after the Taiwanese elections in 2024, could
help to reduce
tensions.[^\[66\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-66)However[,
[**if the underlying causes** of the current US-China
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}[, which are related to the erosion of the
original understanding regarding Taiwan, [**are not addressed**, the
**situation will continue to
deteriorate**]{.mark}]{.underline}.[^\[67\]^](https://ceeep.mil.pe/2024/06/13/insecurity-is-what-states-make-of-it-u-s-securitization-of-china/?lang=en#post-25159-endnote-67)
[All of the above is]{.underline} increasingly [[reducing the
possibility of reaching an **acceptable diplomatic solution** that
**avoids direct armed confrontation**]{.mark} between the two
powers.]{.underline}

### Colonial violence/Racism

#### Securitization ignores lived experiences of racialized "others" and justifies violence---prioritizes Western views.

Until recently, securitization theory had not dealt candidly with race
and racism, and with the problematic racist and colonial roots of IR
theory[.]{.underline} Machanda (2021) argues that the way security
studies organises its subject matter is whitewashing. She draws on the
narrative of the great debates to demonstrate where international
relations has introduced race or grappled with it, while [security
studies has retained a degree of removal, arguing that '\[T\]he emphasis
on the 'international' (colour-blind) state of these events normalises
an inattention to the pedestrian (racialized) destruction of lives,
lifeways and livelihoods']{.underline}(Manchanda 2021). [The examples
are compelling: security studies structured the Cold War]{.underline} in
such a way that it has been adopted into popular discourse as a synonym
for hostility without violence. [The 'proxy wars' fought across Africa,
East Asia, and in decolonising states are dismissed as insignificant to
international security. [The conceptual structuring of security studies
denies lived experiences]{.mark} and organises events into sanitised
conceptual categories as if only this elevated, scientific gaze can
properly allow a rational analysis of forces that are supposedly bigger
than human pain, death and destruction]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the
discipline of security studies relies upon the analytical unit of the
state. State identities, including the relevant formation of 'society'
that resides within a bounded state, rely on emotional attachment and an
always already racializing mentality. As nation state citizenship is an
exclusionary form of birth-right identity in and of itself (whether this
birth-right is based on place or blood), it makes and reproduces
racism[. [The European-centrism and white supremacy at the heart of the
state unit reproduce colonial power structures]{.mark} in a world that
claims inclusivity by calcifying citizenship as the only acceptable form
of international identity even while failing to guarantee that every
human holds a state citizenship. Racialisation is then embedded in the
structure of the state system, as it was used to mark bodily categories
of differentiation]{.underline} during colonialism, decolonisation, and
within the economic infrastructure of globalised capital (Urciuoli 2020;
Mullings 2005; Omi and Winant 1993). Stanfield (2016) describes
['race-making as a mode of institution and nation-state building ...
race-making and its generator, racism, are part and parcel of the manner
by which major industrial European-descent nation-states ... have
originated and developed. ...\[this has\] been normative, not
accidental,]{.underline} coincidental, or a contradiction between
democratic ideas and human interests' (Stanfield Ii 2011): 113--114). To
ontologically underpin an academic discipline with the analytical unit
of the state means internalising the racism that such a unit relies
upon. [While there is a pragmatist argument to make, that the state is
in practice the unit of international relations and we cannot deny its
existence, this does not mean that we should be uncritically reproducing
the power of the state.]{.underline} Rather [we must attend to the
violence inherent in that power, how it is used, and who it is used
against. National identity and state-based exclusions require a logic of
racism to function.]{.underline} Racialised identities transcend state
borders and exist across them and also produce inequality and violence
within a state identity. This is associated with mythical ideas of who
does or does not properly belong to the imagined in-group. Urciuoli
suggests that 'race is about having no legitimate place as a citizen in
a larger order while ethnicity and diversity are about citizens and
workers having provisional places' (Urciuoli 2020: 108). [[Processes of
racialization and ethnicization produce inequality in the]{.mark} very
ordering [structure of the nation state]{.mark} and the nation state
relies on these categories to function as an identity unit. Accepting
the unit of the state as a birth-right identity legitimises this way of
thinking in the world and [is particularly problematic in international
security studies]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} that directs analytical
attention to the state-as-actor even while being well-able to identify
the problems it causes. [[Security studies]{.mark}, and even critical
security studies, can be charged with [lack]{.mark}ing [critical
attention to race,]{.mark}]{.underline} but what of securitization more
specifically? Howell and Richter-Montpetit argued that [[securitization
theory is unambiguous in its racism]{.mark},]{.underline} that 'its
conceptualization of 'politics' and 'security' is founded in
civilizationist thought' and 'antiblackness is a crucial building-block
in securitization theory's conceptual division between security and
politics.' (Howell and Richter-Montpetit 2020: 5). [[The
argument]{.mark} is structured around [that which securitization theory
overlooks, and the way it characterises forms of
violence]{.mark}.]{.underline} [For example, [social security is
overlooked]{.mark} as being marginal to the politics of international
security, [and police violence is accepted]{.mark} as part of 'normal'
politics.]{.underline} The authors point to case studies and empirical
subject matter as reproducing extant anti-black and anti-Muslim biases
within the body of securitization literature. [These omissions on the
part of securitization theory and theorists certainly indicate a lack of
critical reflection with regard to race,]{.underline} although it should
also be noted that there are indeed also some (acknowledged) omissions
in Howell and Richter-Montpetit's characterisation of the field: they
speak directly to 'classic securitization theory' and take on the
canonical works of the field. The authors acknowledge work that has
incorporated a critical analysis of race in securitization, although
they argue these critiques are thin as they still rely on the speech act
methodology. For example, Moffette and Vadasaira (2016) reframe [[the
state of exception that is produced by
securitization]{.underline}]{.mark} as a lift on the prohibition of
violence, which [[allows uninhibited violence towards racialised
others]{.underline}]{.mark} that liberal states conventionally keep
hidden to be practiced openly. Yet, other texts identify the racialised
outputs of securitization, such as D'Argangelis (2017) who identified
the racialised 'bio-terror' narratives that emerge from the
securitization of public health, focusing more on narrativizing
racialized concepts that produce racialised practices. And in an
exemplary piece, Ybarra (2018) recentres the discussion to examine how
[the experience of [racialised violence feeds back into geopolitical
divisions that]{.mark} [emerge and are sustained by racialised
securitization]{.mark} practices.]{.underline} Ybarra does not centre on
the speech act but focuses her analytical attention on the experience of
racialized violence. Of course, the debate on race in securitization
theory has developed: Waever and Buzan (2020) and Hansen (2020) both
responded to the critiques, Hansen marking the self-reflection it
inspired. Here I seek to acknowledge the debate on race and argue that
best practice is always for theory, not least securitization theory, to
be reflective. We are not always capable of recognising and accounting
for normative biases, yet we should always be held to a process of
reflection towards this and held responsible if we do not do this well.
Being cognizant of the racialised composition of the power structures
that comprise our analyses (and govern our lives) is important. I
suggest here two methods for improving the capacity of securitization
theory to account for race, coloniality, and racialized structures, the
systemic oppression of other forms of minoritization, and the consequent
sustaining inequality. The first is to un-silo securitization and
recognise that discrete examples of [[securitizing practices occur under
the]{.underline}]{.mark} same [[racialised, ethnicized, gendered
structures of power]{.mark}.]{.underline} This means that the
implications of securitization are often layered, and manifest
intersectional oppression and inequality. By advancing an understanding
of intersecting securitizations and intersectional insecurities we can
begin to address this more fully than has been achieved to date.
Secondly, I argue [that securitization ought to be decentred away from
elites, to focus on the violence of securitization in the communities
and among the identities where that violence manifests.]{.underline}
Following the methodological model of Ybarra (2019), I argue for a
theoretical decentring of securitization theory, where the violence of
securitization leads the analysis.

#### Laundry list of impacts -- destruction of livelihood, traditional practices, sacred relationships, psychological anguish, death. It's the duty of the settler to provide support to Indigenous opposition to extraction.

The third tendency is the [increased harm done to Arctic Indigenous
Peoples\' territory, cultures, knowledge, practices, health, and
lifeways]{.underline} (Figure 3 a). Fifteen out of the sixteen cases
reported these life and death concerns (Batalla, 2020; Kuokkanen, 2023).
The Sámi, Iupiat, Nenets, Doglan, Evenki, Dena, Entsy, Inuvialuit, and
Nganasan are Indigenous communities actively resisting them (Figure 3
b). Their primary concern is the [loss of reindeer herding or caribou
migration and survival, along with]{.underline} their [knowledge,
practices, landscapes, sacred sites, and]{.underline} overall
[human-nature relationships]{.underline}. This cultural revival
throughout the examples analyzed reveals that reindeer herding is
essential to Sámi and Nenets culture. Normann (2021) explains that
shared memories, interactions with other communities, and collective
activities are effective modes of mobilization against green
colonialism, which continue to damage reindeer herders and other Arctic
peoples. Thus, [the continuation of historical extractivist colonial
pressures intensifies through the green shift, territorial invasion, and
socio-cultural and environmental erasure]{.underline} (Clark, 2021;
Kuokkanen, 2023). Access to hunting, fishing, whaling, and sealing is
also a source of contention. As Inuvialuit hunters and community members
of Baffin Island stated \'\'\[...it is\] our right to eat, and our right
to continue to live off the land as we choose, as we have always
done\'\' (Bennett, 2021). Yet, the long history of anti-mining and
anti-oil struggles has had a significant influence on both the physical,
the emotional, and mental wellbeing of the Arctic peoples (Bjørst et
al., 2022). [Extractivisms cause emotional anguish to locals by turning
highly political issues into apolitical and technical
questions]{.underline} (ibid). [Corporate-state nexuses]{.underline}
also [try to dissuade people from radical resistance, but instead to
express their views by colonial and]{.underline} often [Eurocentric
forms of private negotiation, participating in certification,
stakeholder dialogue and other non-contentious politics,]{.underline}
such as sustainable mining [roundtables or]{.underline} even [state
consultation and corporate dialogue]{.underline} in green colonial
contexts (Fjellheim, 2023). Dunlap & Riquito (2023) discuss in depth the
[psycho-social damage that the pro-mining corporate-government nexuses
contribute to in green extractivism attempts]{.underline}, such as
lithium mining. The fourth tendency is rising resistance to Arctic
extractivisms. [Impacts of climate change have long influenced
mobilization of socio-environmental conflicts across the
Arctic]{.underline} (Balzer, 2015; Fedorova & Mitryaykina, 2021;
Magomedov, 2019). In fact, [the links between land and nature,
livelihoods, and survival and resistance are all intertwined with Arctic
climate challenges.]{.underline} Concerns over water, land, culture,
hazardous waste, and climate change have surfaced as key elements in the
anti-colonial efforts in the Arctic (Figure 2). In the Arctic, [the
resistance revolves around historical and green extractivisms in
particular]{.underline}. This is because [green
extractivisms]{.underline} perpetuate climate colonialities and
[establish an uninterrupted axis of false climate solutions,
exacerbating an already worrisome situation]{.underline} on Arctic
changing territories and climates. Increasingly, [anticolonial
movements, in the broad sense, reshape extractivist
trajectories]{.underline}. [Opposition does this by similar
strategies]{.underline} to those used in other contexts,
[including]{.underline} for example [collective resistance, media
activism, and blockade actions]{.underline} against extractive
colonialities that devastate the people and the Earth (Dunlap &
Jakobsen, 2020; Kröger, 2020). Finally, [we also observe]{.underline}d
[non-Indigenous dimensions, but these were so limited that they cannot
be called a tendency]{.underline} (Figure 2). Lassila (2020) previously
reported on non-Indigenous dimensions in green mining disputes (i.e.,
the Sakatti project in Sodankylä, Finland) with ramifications for
Finnish reindeer herders and disagreement over the mine\'s proximity to
a conservation area. Although an important factor for better
understanding of how green extractivism develops and the forms it takes
across the region, we do not observe such a pattern in our dataset. The
cases we observed included disagreements by non-Indigenous people over
seabed mining and potentially hazardous waste leaking into the ocean
between mining and large-scale fishing industries. [Scientists,
international, and national environmental justice
organisations]{.underline} (EJOs) typically [mobilise]{.underline} in
such situations (Figure 3 a). [Instead of forming their own resistance
to extractivism, these actors typically offer support for Indigenous
struggles.]{.underline}

#### Threat perceptions are justifications of racism and xenophobia.

Some scholars have dismissed the argument that [China threat narratives
are actually about capabilities and argue instead that they are caused
by the interaction of American and Chinese identities. This perspective
is firmly grounded in **social constructivism**, which argues that
**identity is at the root of threat perceptions/narratives** and is tied
to the (perceived) inherent character- istics of a particular state --
e.g. **ethnicity, race, religion, ideology, form of government, domestic
politics, and/or self-image**]{.underline} (Rousseau 2006[). Narratives
under this theory are not about what an object can do, but rather who
they are and how they represent a threat to the identity of the subject.
Often, identity insecurity trumps physical insecurity]{.underline}
(Malmvig 2014; Huysmans 2016). In the present case, [**China could be
seen as representing the "other" to the U.S., either because of racism,
historical prejudices, or legacies of the Cold War**]{.underline} (Pan
2012; Turner 2013). It is therefore [the perceived identity-based
characteristics of China, and how those run contrary to America's sense
of self, that make the country appear threatening to the United
States.]{.underline} Tsygankov (2017) and Tsygankov and Parker (2015)
argued that current American narratives of the Russia threat are really
about identity factors which paint Russia as having an expansionist and
authoritarian political culture, thus making it inherently threa- tening
to the United States.

#### Extractivism causes appropriation that leads to the genocide of peoples and knowledges, and ecosystems.

**Dunlap et. al. 24** \[(Dr. Alexander Dunlap is a research scientist at

<https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.6131>\] //KH

[A second core feature]{.underline} of extractivism [is that
appropriation and the related process of producing legibility always
lead to the breakdown of socioecological reciprocity,
implying]{.underline} the [infliction of irreparable harm on
socioecological systems]{.underline}. \'Harm\' should be interpreted
here in a broad sense, [entailing]{.underline} one or multiple forms of
[homogenization of people and knowledges, socioecological degradation,
depletion, destruction or subordination to profit-generation of
habitats, existences and social ecologies]{.underline} (Blaser, 2013;
Kröger, 2022; Kallianos et al., 2023), [which]{.underline} can [have
genocidal/ecocidal effects]{.underline} (Short, 2016; Crook & Short,
2021; Dunlap, 2021d). The harm inflicted by creating [socioecological
disbalance is]{.underline} generally [externalized]{.underline},
implying [extractive corporations do not account for it,
but]{.underline} they [offload harms onto local ecosystems]{.underline}
(e.g., habitats), [the]{.underline} existences and [peoples that
constitute them and]{.underline}, of course, [the public
sector]{.underline}. The [unequal distribution of harms combined
with]{.underline} the unequal, [adverse]{.underline} or highly limited
[benefit sharing]{.underline}, [point]{.underline}ing [to ecological
distribution conflicts]{.underline} (EDCs), discussed further in the
next section. Because of the severing of reciprocity, we interpret
[extraction]{.underline} to indicate extra-action that [creates
socioecological disharmony by appropriating extra]{.underline} (via
rents or capital valorization), [or simply consuming more \'resources\'
or existences than can sustain habitats and socioecological and
epistemic vitality and diversity]{.underline}. This, as Anna Willow
(2019) shows us, requires \"*extra-Activisms*\" to confront and attempt
to remedy the imposition of extractivism.

#### Green extractivism reinforces value grabbing, encouraging appropriation of land, resources, and ecosystems\-\-- leads to manipulation and violence.

**Dunlap et. al. 24** \[(Dr. Alexander Dunlap is a research scientist at

<https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.6131>\] //KH

While [value grabbing]{.underline} has always been a central dynamic to
extractivism, its importance [has increased with the growing
financialization of the world economy]{.underline} from the 1980s
onwards. This also applied to situations where the [government took on
an important role in financing, enabling and regulating extractivism, as
occurred with \"neoextractivism\" in Latin America]{.underline} (Lang &
Mokrani, 2013). With the rise of global commodity prices,
[(neo)extractivism involves governments extracting more rents and
accumulated value]{.underline} (see Bebbington, 2012; Perreault, 2013),
[which]{.underline}, in the case of rentierism, [advances the
\"collateralization\" of national assets through legal-technical
instruments]{.underline} (Rosales 2019, 1317). [The importance of value
grabbing within extractivism is only reinforced through the rise of
green extractivism, which is importantly driven by processes of \'green
financialization]{.underline},\' involving carbon markets, payment for
ecosystems services and green bond markets (Lohmann, 2016; Andreucci et
al. 2017; Bruna, 2022a; Büscher & Fletcher, 2015; Fletcher, 2024;
Sullivan, 2013, 2023, this Section). Another key dynamic of green
financialization is governmental \'de-risking,\' or favorable
private-public partnerships (PPA), which are currently being used to
finance climate change mitigation and industry decarbonization projects.
De-risking seeks to reduce, or eliminate, investment risks by leveraging
public funds. In a recent report, Steffen Haag and colleagues (2024)
demonstrate [how lower-carbon energy projects, grid reinforcement and
\'green\' hydrogen, among other projects, are being \'derisked\' with
public funds]{.underline} in a number of African countries, revealing
how new [\'green finance schemes,\']{.underline} such as Germany\'s Just
Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs), [will be essential technologies
in advancing green extractivism. Green financialization is also key to
ecotourism, a manifestation of extractivism almost purely driven by
value grabbing]{.underline} (Andreucci et al., 2017). This Special
Section discusses ecotourism in relation to trophy hunting in Namibia
(Sullivan, 2023), jaguar conservation in Mexico (Ruelas & Dunlap, 2023)
and dams and carbon \'offsets\' in Colombia (Feeney, 2024). [While
ecotourism aims for the preservation of biodiversity and
ecosystems]{.underline}, rather than their depletion, [it reinforces a
system where]{.underline} many existences, notably [Indigenous peoples
and their knowledges, are excluded from protected areas]{.underline}
(Marijnen et al., 2021; Duffy & Brockington, 2022; Fletcher, 2024). [The
result is the commodification of ecosystems and the reorganization of
relationships in the service of value extraction]{.underline}, which is
frequently [compounded by companies using conservation to justify
mega-infrastructure projects and]{.underline}, frequently,
[mining]{.underline} (Büscher & Davidov, 2013; Le Billon, 2021). Green
financialization plays a growing role in this, as [ecotourism projects
are enabled by finance from carbon markets and new
tech]{.underline}nologies, such as [block chain]{.underline} (Duffy,
2015; Le Billon, 2021; Tornel, 2023b, this Section; Ruelas & Dunlap,
this Section). [Extractivism, said simply, takes on various public
and/or private forms to advance capital accumulation and \'grab\'
value.]{.underline} Based on this extensive overview of core debates and
features of [extractivism]{.underline}, we identify [three core
features]{.underline}, The first feature relates to the [appropriation
of resources]{.underline} (Gudynas, 2009) [and rendering them legible,
specifically for]{.underline} the purposes of [value
creation]{.underline} (Moore, 2015). Appropriation has been an important
focus within political ecology research (Fairhead et al. 2012; Leff,
2015; Andreucci et al. 2017; Cavanagh & Benjaminsen 2017; Tornel 2023a).
Discussing green grabbing, James Fairhead and colleagues (2012, 238)
[define appropriation as \"the transfer of ownership, use rights and
control over resources that were once publicly or privately owned -- or
not]{.underline} even the [subject of ownership -- from the
poor]{.underline} (or everyone including the poor) [into the hands of
the powerful]{.underline}.\" The [appropriation of land, resources and
ecosystems goes hand-in-hand with making them legible to
capital]{.underline}. [This process, generally driven by
state-capital-science complexes (]{.underline}Moore, 2015), [entails
identifying, measuring, mapping, labeling and]{.underline} often
[quantifying phenomena in order to commodify them and render them
governable and extractable]{.underline} (Scott, 1998; Li, 2014; Avila,
et al., 2022; Vidalou \[2017\] 2023). Both the [production]{.underline}
of legibility [and appropriation]{.underline} generally [involve
different forms]{.underline} and degrees [of coercion, manipulation and
violence]{.underline}, ultimately [serving to enable the accumulation of
capital.]{.underline} As discussed below, green grabbing and
extractivism therefore share overlap with accumulation by dispossession
(Harvey, 2003), a term employed to extend Marx\'s notion of primitive
accumulation (Perreault, 2013; Andreucci et al., 2017). [Green
grabbing]{.underline}, following Fairhead and colleagues (2012),
[positions itself as green accumulation by dispossession]{.underline}.

#### Extractivism is rooted in exploitation of beings Western society objectifies--- justifying violent elimination of ecosystems and peoples.

**Dunlap et. al. 24** \[(Dr. Alexander Dunlap is a research scientist at
the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability (IGS). Judith
Verweijen is an Assistant Professor in Political Geography at Utrecht
University. Carlos Tornel holds a PhD in Human Geography from Durham
University.) Dunlap, A., Verweijen, J., & Tornel, C. (2024). The

<https://doi.org/10.2458/jpe.6131>\] //KH

Moving [in]{.underline}to [the cognitive realm]{.underline}, the concept
of [extractivism has been extended to capture its relation to diverse
lifeways and knowledges and how these are consumed, repackaged, sold and
destroyed through (neo)colonial processes and extractive
development.]{.underline} For instance, Ramón Grosfoguel (2016: 126,
137) describes how [extractivism is enabled by \"an attitude of
objectification\" rooted in racial, colonial and capitalist logics that
is justified by ideas of techno-industrial \'progress\']{.underline}
(see also Von Werlhof, 2015; Neyrat, 2018; Dunlap & Jakobsen, 2020).
These [logics point to]{.underline} what Grosfoguel calls [\'epistemic\'
and \'ontological\' extractivism,]{.underline} relating to how one views
and knows the world. [Seeing different existences, beings and nonhumans
as \'resources\' to be \'exploited\'---instead of]{.underline} our
[\'relatives\' whose existence is fundamentally interlinked with that of
humans]{.underline} and bodies/territories---[is a crucial psycho-social
and ontological condition for justifying and legitimizing the violent
degradation and elimination of ecosystems and]{.underline} diverse human
and non-human [beings]{.underline} (Kröger, 2022; L. B. Simpson, 2017;
Simpson, 2019). Kröger (2022: 65) calls this the \"[political economy of
existences,\"]{.underline} which [examines how \"extractivist expansions
and projects influence existences]{.underline},\" for example, by
killing or [replacing forests]{.underline} and transforming them [into
soy monoculture fields.]{.underline} Indeed, [what]{.underline} the term
[\'extractivism\' ultimately]{.underline} describes is a particular way
of seeing and being in the world---it accurately [captures how theft,
looting and pillage remain constant in the political economy of
capitalism, no matter its differing (]{.underline}statist[)]{.underline}
political and economic accumulation [regimes]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} conditioning, [manufacturing]{.underline} and teaching
[of these worldviews]{.underline}, knowledges and beliefs [relates to
the production of \"extractive subjectivities\"]{.underline} (Verweijen
et al., 2024). Taking inspiration from Foucauldian notions of
governmentality, [a focus on subjectivities implies looking at how
people\'s mentalities, attitudes and conduct are shaped by and shape
extractive activity]{.underline}. [Extractivism]{.underline}, Judith
Shapiro and John McNeish (2021) argue[, is the result of a particular
ontological assemblage]{.underline} which is animated by a mindset that
shapes expressions, contestations, and logics for and/or against a
singular worldview [that sees human and nature as separate and (some)
humans as more exploitable than others]{.underline}. In a similar vein,
Chris Chagnon and colleagues (2022, 761) demonstrate that [extractivism
\"forms a complex ensemble of self-reinforcing practices, mentalities,
and power differentials underwriting and rationalizing
socio-ecologically destructive modes of organizing life through
subjugation, violence, depletion, and non-reciprocity.\"]{.underline}

[The Arctic]{.underline}, however[, is not]{.underline} --- and should
not --- be [destined for that end state]{.underline}. We, the
journalists who report on our news, and the policymakers who create
reports, have a choice in how we frame issues. [Rather than always
treating the Arctic as a place where competition is inherent, we can
instead see it as a place of possible cooperation.]{.underline} [After
all, the largest security threat in the Arctic is climate
change]{.underline}. It impacts not only the people living in the Arctic
itself, but also states surrounding the Arctic, and the rest of the
world, as sea and ocean levels increase, oceans become desalinated, and
temperatures increase worldwide[. There is a choice to focus on how
states can and have been cooperating on this issue, thereby
incentivizing further collaboration down the line instead of thinking
solely on old-school ways of thinking about security.]{.underline} HOW
TO AVOID THE SECURITIZATION TRAJECTORY While we can think and write
about geopolitical hard security issues in the Arctic, we can do so in a
way that also gives airtime to cooperation and collaboration rather than
thinking solely about the latest Russian military exercise or most
recent scare about Chinese investment in Greenland. This is not to say
that reporting on Russia and China is not important or necessary, but
rather, reporting in a balanced way that takes the responsibility of
reporting all sides of an issue seriously. [On a policy level,
policymakers]{.underline} and diplomats can --- and [should]{.underline}
--- [change the framing of the Arctic in official policies, speeches,
and critical international organizations, such as the Arctic
Council.]{.underline} Security shouldn't be only about the construction
of new ships, submarines, and military exercises. Planners who are
thinking about the role of militaries and institutions should consider
how security also refers to the individual security of Arctic residents,
focusing on their ability to access food and water, potential
insecurities arising from coastal erosion --- 70% of which in the Arctic
is built on currently thawing permafrost --- as well as societal
insecurities that come about from a lack of community resilience.
Lastly[, there is a tendency in international politics to focus on
conflictual issues when instead we should be finding]{.underline} other,
[more cooperative issues to encourage relationship-building among actors
in the Arctic.]{.underline} Instead of immediately pivoting to trying to
negotiate arms control treaties amongst Arctic states, countries could
instead find issues, such as transparency, search and rescue
cooperation, and pollution clean-up that does not require as much
political capital. These issues might be framed as low-stakes but they
should not be, particularly if all stakeholders want to ensure that the
Arctic is not securitized. RHETORIC MATTERS AFTER ALL [It matters how we
talk about the Arctic. Whaling is a great example of where changing
rhetoric has impacted policy.]{.underline} While in the first half of
the 20th century, whaling was considered a fairly normal aspect of the
economy, anti-whaling discourse changed the depiction of whales to
intelligent mammals. This transformed the perception of whaling to
morally repugnant. It goes to show that the way we talk matters, and [it
can matter more than material interests that might seem more
logical.]{.underline} [We can continue to use bellicose rhetoric to
describe relations between states and encourage militarization on every
side, but that will end exactly the way worse-case scenarios describe
it.]{.underline} Instead, [we can --- and should --- change the way we
talk and think about the Arctic]{.underline} to focus on cooperation,
change the way we frame the region, and find low-stakes issues on which
to cooperate and hopefully reverse or at least slow the trajectory of
securitizing the Arctic.

#### Post-positivism fundamentally rejects the aff's scenario planning and predictive claims as never neutral or objectively true -- the exercise of IR is instead to theorize patterns and consequences of their assumptions.

One of the most common ontological and epistemological divides you will
encounter in the pages that follow is whether "a fact is a fact" and
whether it can be objectively known and measured. A scholar's judgment
on this question determines how he or she will conceptualize, study, and
write about a subject such as Iraq and what types of templates he or she
will utilize to categorize it. Those [scholars who insist that there is
an objective state of being, an objective "reality," that is relatively
obvious and can be accurately known and measured, are]{.underline}
commonly [referred to as positivists]{.underline}. [For]{.underline}
most [positivists, the primary activity of an IR theorist is to test IR
theoretical perspectives against one another]{.underline}. This is done
[by collecting data and by devising methods that would be the equivalent
of an experiment in the hard science]{.underline}s (no easy feat in a
subject area that does not allow for controlled experiments to isolate
causal variables). The goal of the IR theorist from a positivist's
perspective is to weed out those theories and hypotheses that
consistently fail to account for data, although one of the primary
sources for diversity within particular theoretical perspectives is also
theoretical revision in response to empirical anomalies. In undertaking
such activity, the positivist hopes to produce more explanatory
theories, which in an ideal world would make both prediction and better
foreign policy making possible. [Positivists]{.underline} would tend to
[define the nature and purpose of IR theory in scientific
terms]{.underline} as a result. Dougherty and Pfaltzgraff claim, for
example, that theory is "a series of propositions or hypotheses that
specify relations among variables in order to present explanations and
make predictions about the phenomena," with its purpose being "the
discovery of laws that govern how people and collectivities . . . act
under specific circumstances" (1997: 21--22). Similarly, Viotti and
Kauppi state that, "'If A, then B' as hypothesis may be subject to
empirical test---that is tested against real-world or factual data," so
"the stage is set for making modest predictions about the nature and
direction of change" (1999: 3). While positivists disagree among
themselves over a variety of substantive theoretical issues[, there is a
shared consensus among them regarding the objective accessibility of
reality and our ability to discover universal laws that are amenable to
causal explanations and prediction]{.underline}. This consensus also
[provides the basis for]{.underline} common methodological and
[analytical tools]{.underline}, with the best known of these being
[levels of analysis.]{.underline} Levels of analysis refers to
[identifying potentially causal variables and then categorizing or
locating them according to a micro-macro spectrum for the purposes of
explanatory organization]{.underline}. Although there is variety in how
many categorizing levels may be utilized, IR scholars have typically
relied on three primary levels: the individual, the nation-state, and
the system. 4 The individual level is the most micro, where causality is
traced to the individuals who make foreign policy and the psychology of
human decisionmaking. The nation-state level is the middle level and
involves the examination of government structures, bureaucratic
politics, interest groups, media influences, and other internal factors
that might influence or account for a nation-state's foreign policy
behavior and international activity. The systemic level is the most
macro level, involving not only the examination of state-to-state
relations but also shared environmental or structural factors, such as
geography, relative power, or capitalist interdependence, that might
influence or direct the behavior of all nation-states. [Disagreements
among positivists often involve which level of analysis, and particular
factors therein, are responsible for and hence best explain a given
outcome or event]{.underline}. Variants within a particular theoretical
perspective often evolve as, in their quest to test and modify their
theories against the empirical evidence, [IR theorists pit levels of
analysis against one another as if they were competing explanations
(rather than useful heuristic, organizing tools).]{.underline}
[Postpositivism]{.underline}, on the other hand, [refers to IR scholars
who are skeptical that "a fact is a fact" and that it can be objectively
known and measured]{.underline}. 5 Postpositivists observe that [all
events are subject to interpretation, with the interpreter's own
situation,]{.underline} context, and language often [determining how an
event is]{.underline} characterized and [explained.]{.underline} Since
[neither language nor the act of communication is ever unproblematic or
value-free,]{.underline} [postpositivists]{.underline} [challenge the
notion that we could objectively know or access reality by relying on
methods drawn from]{.underline} the [hard science]{.underline}s. [Such
methods are based on an erroneous conviction that]{.underline}, as
Marysia Zalewski puts it, "[what gets included and what gets excluded"
in the theory and practice of IR is due to "'natural' or 'obvious'
choices, determined by the 'real' world, whereas they are instead
judgments"]{.underline} [about what should be taken seriously and what
can]{.underline} safely [be ignored]{.underline} (1996: 34, emphasis in
original). [Such judgments are never neutral]{.underline} or innocent.
[They are]{.underline} instead [made by those who hold]{.underline}
relative [power]{.underline}, both among nation-states and within the IR
discipline where positivism dominates. This means that certain [equally
important topics, perspectives]{.underline}, and choices [are
marginalized by the]{.underline} very [theories and methods to which
positivist IR scholars subscribe]{.underline}. As S. Smith puts this,
"[some epistemological positions 'see' certain aspects of the political
world as]{.underline} being a problem [to be researched while others are
kept out of view]{.underline}" (2008: 307--308). One result, as Smith
goes on to note, is that "[IR has consistently treated death by politics
as being more visible than death by economics]{.underline}." Similarly
Zalewski observes that [war has been a central concern of IR theorists
and policymakers, yet it is poverty, which receives very little
attention]{.underline} among IR scholars, [that remains a leading cause
of death]{.underline} in the world (1996: 351). [Postpositivists would
define the nature and purpose of IR theory very differently]{.underline}
in comparison [to positivist]{.underline}s. Testing competing
hypotheses, [developing causal explanations, and making predictions are
seen as the]{.underline} dominant and relatively [destructive ways in
which we have come to interpret the world, impose meaning, and
continually recreate particular patterns of knowledge and
behavior]{.underline} in IR. According to Zalewski, [whereas most
positivists think of IR theory as merely a tool or critique, a
postpositivist would define it as "everyday practice" in which
"theorizing is]{.underline} a way of life, a form of life, [something we
all do, every day, all the time,"]{.underline} which means that
"[theorists are global actors and global actors are
theorists]{.underline}" (1996: 346, 348). Similarly Smith argues about
IR that "what we think about these events and possibilities, and what we
think we can do about them, depends in a fundamental sense on how we
think about them. In short, [our thinking about the 'real' world, and
hence our practices, is directly related to our theories]{.underline}"
(1996: 1, emphasis in original). [Although postpositivists eschew the
notion that there are universal laws that are objectively
discoverable]{.underline} with scientific methods, [they do see
patterns]{.underline} to the way positivists describe and theorize IR.
Such patterns could [derive from, for example, the values
of]{.underline} eighteenth-century European [Enlightenment]{.underline}
(which promotes a faith in science) [or the politics of identity within
IR]{.underline} (which is dominated both in practice and in theory by
men).

#### The alt is key---without postpositivist deconstruction we're left with political choices and obscuring of marginalized theory disguised as a neutrally correct conclusion.

[For]{.underline} most [postpositivists, the primary activity of an IR
theorist is to reveal how international events are described, whether by
policymakers]{.underline}, positivist IR [theorists, or]{.underline}
within [commonplace texts]{.underline} such as magazines, works of
fiction, or military manuals. More specifically, [the postpositivist is
interested in how those descriptions are acted upon as if they were
natural descriptions rather than constructions, and]{.underline} how
those descriptions [justify actions and arguments in a self-fulfilling
cycle of codetermination]{.underline}. Revelation is [accomplished by
examining texts]{.underline} by, for example, policymakers or fellow IR
theorists, [with the goal being to reveal]{.underline} not only the
[philosophical commitments, biases, and commonly subscribed to social
realities that ground]{.underline} the activity of [IR]{.underline} (in
both its policymaking and theoretical forms), but [also what has
been]{.underline} excluded or [marginalized]{.underline} by such
activity. Postpositivists do this by [providing alternative readings and
interpretations]{.underline} of how policymakers and theorists have
characterized and justified events and topics. [Critics often disparage
postpositivist methodology as mere "interpretivism,"]{.underline} which
lacks any standard of judgment [and]{.underline} could lead to "[a form
of epistemological anarchy]{.underline}" in the discipline (Dougherty
and Pfaltzgraff 1997: 36). 6 [Postpositivists counter that positivism is
no more capable of providing a neutral vehicle for assessing theoretical
analysis]{.underline}, since [it "merely presents what is unavoidably a
political choice as if it was a technical application of a system of
knowledge]{.underline}" (S. Smith 2008: 307).
[Counterinterpretations]{.underline}, however, whether they are of a
policymaker's speeches or of a fellow theorist's articles, [play an
essential role in revealing the ideas that]{.underline} we take for
granted, that shape the way we see the world, that [we rely upon to
justify the actions we take, and]{.underline} that [reproduce the world
we take for granted.]{.underline} In addition, [the patterns identified
and "tested" by positivist IR theories are,]{.underline} postpositivists
point out, [drawn almost exclusively from the Western imperial
experience]{.underline}. [Yet many IR theories make sweeping universal
claims that]{.underline} do not actually apply beyond the West and, [due
to the West's cultural and intellectual hegemony]{.underline},
simultaneously [marginalize alternative, nonWestern ways of
understanding]{.underline}. Hence many [postpositivists eschew the
categorization of knowledge into IR theory "isms"]{.underline} as
reifying Western ways of seeing. They seek instead to [explore
alternative voices and non-Western perspectives]{.underline}. As B.
Jones argues, [What is needed is a broader and deeper form of critique
that encompasses the discipline as a whole---its underlying assumptions,
modes of thought and analysis, and its consciousness and]{.underline}
very [attitude]{.underline}---and that, moreover, is committed not only
to critique but also to elaboration of more adequate accounts and
explanations of international relations. (2006: 6, emphasis in original)
[Without such a critique]{.underline}, postpositivists argue, [existing
IR theories will continue to misread and obscure the dynamics of
contemporary global politics in ways that perpetuate existing inequities
and subjugations.]{.underline}

### Extra-Activisms

#### The alt is extra-Activisms -- key to pierce through their "green" rhetoric to the reality of extractivist projects and the cost of modernity.

The emergence of [green extractivism]{.underline} has complicated and
fragmented the fight against extractivism and concomitant dispossession
and destruction (Dunlap, 2023b). It [has created confusion and division
within environmental movements]{.underline} and public debate [by
presenting supposedly \'just\' green energy \'transitions\' as the sole
solutions to the capitalist/planetary crisis.]{.underline} As
highlighted in this Special Section, [concepts like \'energy justice,\'
\'biodiversity conservation,\' \'transition materials,\' \'critical
minerals\' and \'decarbonization\' are used as strategies for
accumulation that ultimately serve to sustain the unsustainability of
capitalist modernity.]{.underline} [The proliferation of ecological
destruction conflicts]{.underline} (Scheidel et al., 2020; Temper et
al., 2020), moreover, not only [reflects the shortcomings of state-led
forms of environmental justice]{.underline}, but also [the erasure of
life-worlds and]{.underline}, consequently, [alternative ways of being,
knowing, and doing in the world]{.underline}. This erasure of worlds and
knowledges necessitates the intensification of research on how
[so-called]{.underline} [renewability leads to
extractivism]{.underline}. As it currently stands **[there is no such
thing as \'renewable energy\']{.underline}** (Dunlap, 2021b). This, as
mentioned above, extends to charting how [extractivist activities entail
slow and progressive forms of socioecological degradation]{.underline},
related to the quality and vitality of wind, wave, river and solar
flows. It also entails [exploring the long-term changes within habitats
through a \"political economy of existences\"]{.underline} lens (Kröger,
2022, 65), looking not only at how [different existences are
killed,]{.underline} but also at how [different knowledges, ontologies
and existences are replaced by others]{.underline}. [Such research is a
precondition for holding conventional and green extractive industries
accountable.]{.underline} [It is therefore fundamentally important, not
only scientifically but]{.underline} also [in terms of political action,
and public and international policy]{.underline}. [Universities
themselves remain extractive institutions]{.underline} (Giroux, 2014;
Burawoy et al., 2024), [which require immediate socioecological
transformation]{.underline} (see Dunlap et al., 2023). Changing
[exploitative and extractivist practices demands concerted efforts
by]{.underline} staff and [students]{.underline}. To properly
investigate direct and indirect green extractivism, it is crucial to
challenge what constitutes \"data,\" the assumptions within models and
their narrow sectoral nature. [Data modeling]{.underline}, and the power
it holds, [needs to be challenged by political ecology, and infused with
other knowledges and epistemologies to undo the skewed and reductive
visions presented by models and their (mis)use within]{.underline}
public [policy]{.underline} (Dunlap, 2023b). The study of
\"political-industrial ecology\" (Newell, et al., 2017), we speculate,
could likely become a natural companion in advancing to more extensive
research on (green) extractivism. There is a particular need for
employing multi-scalar and mixed-methods approaches to critically
investigate and generate new data on extractive supply-webs and the
multiple places and industrial sectors impacted. Such an approach should
target green and conventional extractive industries together (e.g. oil,
gas, coal and nuclear), examining their infrastructures, equipment and
energetic costs. Finally, [there remains an urgent necessity to, first,
**acknowledge the amount of hydrocarbons used within lower-carbon
infrastructural systems and supply-web**s]{.underline} (as researchers
and the public are apt to ignore this) and, secondly, to begin
documenting it. [**Ignoring the extractivist reality of lower-carbon
energy production stifles and prevents people from adequately assessing
the harms of modernity a**nd,]{.underline} consequently, **[working
towards creating sociopolitical systems based on genuine socioecological
sustainability and renewability.]{.underline}** If done well, it will
[help acknowledge the **real socioecological/climatic costs** of
capitalist modernity, which will enable social movements, so-called
\'insurgents,\' lawyers and policy makers alike to better address the
socio/ecological/ontological catastrophe we are]{.underline} currently
[experiencing]{.underline}. In sum, this research may [contribute to
efforts towards systemic transformation to (re)establish socioecological
harmony]{.underline} and/or balance, [which are vital to ensure
continued existence on earth]{.underline}. While green extractivism is a
farce---it is just extractivism--- we argue that it deserves greater
analytical specificity and it remains a useful tool for conceptualizing
capitalism\'s techno/industrial growth. We are witnessing a [remarkable
expansion of \'extra-actions\' accompanying the relentless]{.underline},
often [brutal, and intensifying spread of extractivism into \'less
developed\' or previously inaccessible areas ranging from]{.underline}
material sources at [the bottom of the ocean,]{.underline} to [the
Moon,]{.underline} or even [Mars]{.underline}, and [mineral deposits at
greater depths.]{.underline} This expansion includes indirect and
so-called \'immaterial\' forms of extractivism, such as global
value-chains, logistics, financialization, and data-extraction
algorithms required to sustain green extractivism. **[This proliferation
of extra-actions can only be countered by an intensification of
extra-Activisms]{.underline}**. By understanding how ecological
destruction conflicts proliferate and the role of green extractivism in
their expansion[, **it is possible to see and reject the ideologies and
political strategies used to legitimize extractivism and begin a process
of healing and bringing balance to our social ecologies**]{.underline}.
While this is easier said than done, conducting research to accurately
assess the root of our current socioecological predicament and working
to remedy it remains a \'first step\' within reach of the University
system.

[The question of why states wage war has been one of the key issues
preoccupying IR scholars]{.underline} (Waltz 1959). While realists focus
on survival instincts of states, [ontological security scholars stress
that honor, self-esteem, and a healthy sense of self can be powerful a
motivation to engage in war.]{.underline} As Lebow points out in his
reading of Thucydi des' Peloponnesian War, "\[t\]he Spartan decision for
war was not motivated by concern for physical security but by
ontological security: the need to defend Spartan values and identity"
(Lebow 2008: 180). [Similarly, Steele shows that neutral Belgium did not
reject the German ultimatum in June 1914 to protect its cold-calculated
material interests but rather to preserve its honor as a neutral state.
By doing so, Belgium put its physical survival in harm's way for the
sake of ontological security]{.underline} (Steele 2008). The ontological
security perspective can also provide a different take on why conflicts
endure. Realists argue that security dilemmas are so persistent because
of uncertainty in others' intentions (Herz 1950). Mitzen turns this
argument around and posits that [security dilemmas persist, because they
are a source of certainty as states become attached to violent routines
that drive security dilemmas hence stabilizing their
identities]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006a). If states have a healthy basic
trust, they will be able to reflect, learn, and eventually break free
from the violent routines. C 214 Conflict, Peace, and Ontological
Security [However, if they have a rigid basic trust, they might be
permanently attached to routines that provide ontological security,
despite their obvious physical harm, and hence locked in protracted
conflicts. The conflicts are exceptionally durable when the very master
narrative about the conflict has become so ingrained in the national
self that it survives despite partial desecuritizations]{.underline}. A
case in point is the Arab-Israeli conflict which has over the past
decades only partially desecuritized thanks to the series of peace
agreements on the one side (with Egypt in 1979, with Jordan in 1994).
The process was partial not only because the core Israeli-Palestinian
conflict has not been solved but also because the wider conflict has
expanded by including new securitizations such as the Iranian threat
(Lupovici 2019). Another often studied case is Serbia and its
perseverant opposition to Kosovo's independence, which was declared
unilaterally in 2008. Serbia's counter-secessionist policy, primarily
motivated by ontological rather than physical security needs, has been
an obstacle to the normalization of relationships between Belgrade and
Pristina (Ejdus and Subotić 2014; Subotić 2016; Ejdus 2018, 2020[). The
pursuit of ontological security also drives the behavior of
international organizations to engage as peace and security actors.
Steele, for instance, has made a strong case that NATO intervened in
Kosovo in 1999 to avoid shame over past inactions during genocides in
Rwanda and Bosnia and Herzegovina]{.underline} (Steele 2008:114--148).
Cupać broadens this argument and posits that virtually all NATO's
post-Cold War out-of-area interventions are attempts to fend off
existential anxiety brought about by the disappearance of the Soviet
threat as the foundational raison d'être of the Alliance (Cupać 2012).
In other words, NATO's interventions in Afghanistan, Bosnia and
Herzegovina, Kosovo, Horn of Africa, and Libya have all been [deployed
not to protect the material interests of the Alliance but rather as a
part of its soul searching]{.underline}. Similarly, Mälksoo explains the
recent turn of both NATO and the EU towards the issues of hybrid
warfare, resilience, and strategic communication as a strategy of
[turning growing anxieties over the vulnerability of the West into
manageable and knowable threats]{.underline} (Mälksoo 2018). The concept
of ontological security has also been employed to make sense of
contemporary geopolitical conflicts. Guzzini explains the post Cold War
"return of geopolitics" in Europe as an ontological security-driven
replacement of post ideological uncertainty ushered in by the end of
bipolarity with the symbolic order well-known in the old continent
(Guzzini 2012). While the EU had long resisted this geopolitical turn as
a dangerous relic of a bygone era, it has recently adopted an
increasingly geopolitical posture. [Browning explains this policy return
to historically known coordinates of geopolitical action as an attempt
of the EU to calm anxieties generated by an increasingly assertive and
self-confident Russia]{.underline} (Browning 2018a). On the other hand,
[Russia's behavior has also been explained as being motivated by
ontological rather than physical security needs. After a decade of
failed and humiliating attempts to emulate the West in the 1990s, Russia
under Putin is fending off its anxieties by engineering a hostile West
into the constitutive part of Russia's identity]{.underline} (Hansen
2016[). Achurina and Della Sala have depicted these two interlocking and
mutually reinforcing anxieties as yet another example of an ontological
security dilemma]{.underline} (Akchurina and Della Sala 2018). A case
has also been made that other geo political conflicts, including the one
between the USA and China over the South China Sea (Heritage and Lee
2020) and the one between China and Japan over the Senkaku Islands
(Hwang and Frettingham 2018; Suzuki 2019) are also motivated by
ontological security concerns. Several scholars have used [ontological
security lenses to investigate terrorism. By disrupting the binaries of
friend/enemy, inside/outside, civilian/ military, etc., as Zarakol
points out, terrorism undermines the ontological security of the West
phalian state]{.underline} (Zarakol 2011: 2315). One case in point is
the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. In contrast to 9/11, which was
orchestrated by a foreign enemy, the Boston attack was home grown. In
other words, "strangers, both inside and outside of society," conducted
it (Huysmans Conflict, Peace, and Ontological Security 215 1998: 241).
As such, this attack endangered not only physical but also ontological
security in the USA. By deciding to process the surviving attacker as a
fully-fledged citizen rather than an enemy combatant, the USA recovered
its bio graphical continuity of a liberal society ruptured by 9/11 and
its aftermath (Combes 2016: 13). Chan provides another example in his
study of the Malaysian countering violent extremism strategy (Chan
2020). The rising numbers of Malaysians who joined ISIS ontologically
challenged this predominantly Muslim state. To placate its anxiety,
Malaysia undermined a counter narrative strategy that interpreted the
foreign fighters not as enemies but as correctable citizens who were
misled into the wrong interpretation of Islam (Ibid: 8[). Finally,
ontological security lenses open up a new avenue to study securitization
more broadly]{.underline}. As we know from post-structural scholarship,
physical securitization constructs objects of fear and provides
stability of self/other narratives (Neumann 1999). [Consequently, the
question of "who we are" is inseparable from the question "whom we
fear]{.underline}" (Campbell 1998: 73). Securitization of a social group
constructs objects of fear, but it also provides a sense of identity for
the endangered self. One case in point was the securitization of the
British Muslims in the aftermath of 9/11 and 7/7 attacks, which made
this community insecure but also provided a sense of stability for the
redefined "new British Self" (Croft 2012b: 201).

#### Ontological Security results in war- countries fend off anxieties and fears that come from the vulnerabilities of self

Ontological Security Studies: Origins, Concepts, and Debates The concept
of ontological security was coined by psychiatrist Ronald David Laing
(Laing 2010 \[1960\]) and was further developed in social-psychology
(Erikson 1968). For R.D. Laing, an onto logically secure individual has
a "sense of his presence in the world as a real, alive, whole, and, in a
temporal sense, a continuous person" (Laing 2010: 39). On the contrary,
an ontologically insecure person lacks this sense of internal or
external permanence and is haunted by anxiety of engulfment, implosion,
and petrification (Ibid: 39--65). According to Anthony Giddens, who
imported the concept into sociology, ontological security is a
"confidence that most human beings have in the continuity of their
self-identity and in the constancy of the surrounding social and mate
rial environments of action" (Giddens 1991: 92). C 212 Conflict, Peace,
and Ontological Security To be ontologically secure, in his view, is to
possess at the level of practical knowledge answers to fundamental
questions of human existence. These questions concern the nature of
existence, the finitude of human life, the experience of others, and the
continuity of self-identity (Giddens 1991: 55). Habits of daily life and
routinization of relationships with significant others emotionally
inoculate agents from existential anxieties about the indeterminacy of
human existence. As ontological security is maintained through habits
and routines of daily life, ontological security is challenged, in
Giddens' view, by the speed and breadth of change characteristic for
high modernity (Giddens 1990, 1991). [The concept of ontological
security was imported into IR in the 1990s]{.underline} (Wendt1994; Huys
mans1998;McSweeney1999)and soon after that theoretically and empirically
developed into a budding research agenda (Kinnvall 2004, 2006; Mitzen
2006a; Steele 2008). [Alexander Wendt made one of the earliest attempts
to turn ontological security into an IR idiom (Wendt 1994). He argued
that all states, as corporate actors, have four basic interests or
motivations: (1) physical security defined as "differentiation from
other actors"; (2) ontological security or "predictability in
relationships to the world, which creates a desire for stable social
identities"; (3) recognition; and (4) development (Ibid:
385)]{.underline}. The central assumption of ontological security
studies has been the distinction between physical and ontological
security. While physical security is denoting freedom from threats to
physical integrity, ontological security is about maintaining stable
self-other relationships (Huys mans 1998: 242). Physical security or
"security as survival" is about freedom from fear of dangerous objects.
[Ontological security or "security as being" is about freedom from
anxiety, which stems from the vulnerability of the self (Giddens
1991:43--44; Rumelili 2015: 200). While fear and anxiety can come
together, states often fend off anxieties by stabilizing their
relationships with others, including their rivals or enemies (Huys mans
1998, 242, Mitzen 2006a)]{.underline}. As a consequence, [ontological
security seeking can bring calm to agents but can also]{.underline}
[lead to antagonism and conflict with others.]{.underline} Ontological
security in world politics is maintained through routines with
significant others. These can be both cooperative routines such as
diplomacy, special relationships, alliances, or security integration,
and in this case, the pursuit of ontological security contributes to
peace. However, [ontological security can also be maintained through
conflictual routines such as extremist violence, protracted conflicts,
erection of security barriers, anti-migration policies,
counter-secessionist violence, or denial of historical
crimes.]{.underline} [When this is the case, the pursuit of ontological
security can be a driver of securitization, conflict, and
war]{.underline}. Ontological security is unmade by critical situations,
unpredictable events that affect a large number of individuals, catch
state agents off guard, and disrupt their self-identities (Steele 2008:
12). Collective actors such as social groups, states (or a group of
states) become ontologically insecure when critical situations rupture
their routines hence overwhelming their discourse with fundamental
questions (Ejdus 2018, 2020). As actors are unable to "bracket out"
these questions, they burst into the public sphere hence piercing
agents' protective cocoon resulting in anxiety, self-doubt, shame,
guilt, and other incapacitating emotions resulting in a loss of
purposeful agency. Theoretical debates within ontological security
studies have revolved around three questions. The first one is about the
unit of analysis and the question of who is the ontological seeking
entity. Some authors scale up the analysis and treat collective actors
such as states (Wendt 1994, 1999; Mitzen 2006a; Steele 2008; Rumelili
2015; Subotić 2016, Ejdus 2018, 2020), alliances (Greve 2018),
supranational organizations (Della Sala 2017), or bureaucracies (Steele
2017). Other scholars, although agreeing that collectives provide a
framework for individual ontological security (Marlow 2002), keep the
individual as the key unit of analysis (Abulof 2015; Krolikowski 2008;
Kinnvall 2006; Roe 2008; Croft 2012a, b). To them, the individual is the
only actor who is Conflict, Peace, and Ontological Security 213 seeking
ontological security and should therefore be the focus of analysis. The
second debate is about agency/structure, and it boils down to the
question of where the sources of ontological (in)security lie (Zarakol
2010). Some scholars zoom on ontological (in) security stemming from
agents' social relation ships (Mitzen 2006a). Building on relational
sociology, Pratt takes this a step further and argues that a referent in
ontological security is not the self but the social arrangement (Pratt
2017). Others focus on the introspective construction of biographical
continuity through what Steele terms "the dialectics of the Self"
(Steele 2008; 50; Ejdus 2020). The third group of scholars strike a
middle ground and study social and introspective aspects of ontological
insecurity as mutually constitutive (Zarakol 2010: 8; Kinnvall 2004).
The third debate has been about the relation ship between ontological
security and modernity[. According to Anthony Giddens, the need for
ontological security is a condition created by high modernity, a world
"replete with risks and dangers" in which crisis is not merely an
interruption but "a more or less continuous state of
affairs"]{.underline} (Giddens 1991: 12). [Some authors, drawing on
Giddens, posit that the pursuit of ontological security in world
politics is a feature of radical trans formations brought about by
contemporary processes such as globalization]{.underline} (Kinnvall
2004). Others, such as Zarakol, construe [ontological security as a
universal and trans-historic need of the individual and collective
agents alike (Zarakol 2017). Historically, therefore, the modern state
is only one among many institutional sources of ontological
security]{.underline}. Ontological security providing polities varied
through history and either relied on the predominance of secular or
religious authority or merged the two. In addition to these internal
debates, ontological security studies in IR have also been subjected to
a number of external critiques. In his more recent work, Richard Ned
Lebow takes issue with an assumption, underpinning in his view much of
the ontological security literature in IR, that collectives have one
dominant identity narrative (Lebow 2016:22--44). He also contests that
ontological security is one of the primary goals of individuals and/or
states (Ibid: 29). Another prominent critique was penned by Chris
Rossdale, who posits that by focusing on stability of self identity
narratives as a desired goal of actors, ontological security studies
obscure and marginalize forms of progressive subjectivity which resists
closure such as, for example, queer figurations or anti-militarist
movements (Rossdale 2015). Similarly, Berenskoetter argues that onto
logical security literature is "trapped in the conservative bias"
because it cannot account for emancipatory agency (Berenskoetter 2020)

Understanding the China threat requires nuanced analyses of how security
is read in the United States. This article examines the securitization
of China through critical discourse analysis.
[Securitization]{.underline} outlines the process of how something comes
to be read as a threat and how it is moved from the domain of politics
to that of security. Buzan, Waever, and deWilde note that [it is
initiated through a 'speech-act' and occurs 'when a securitizing actor
uses **a rhetoric of existential threat and thereby takes an issue out
of what under those conditions is "normal politics**"']{.underline}
(1998, pp. 24--25). [Through this process '**an issue is dramatized and
presented as an issue of supreme priority; thus by labelling it as
security an agent claims a need for and right to treat it by
extraordinary means**']{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998, p. 26).[For the
process of securitization to be **successful, the audience must accept
this positioning** 49 so that 'emergency measures' are
legitimized]{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998, p. 25). The [acceptance of
the audience underscores the **central role of discourse** and the fact
that securitization goes beyond the speech act]{.underline}
alone[.]{.underline} Watson emphasizes the [roles of **'audience,
communicator and culture'** as the 'power of language \[is\] dependent
on and embedded in power-laden relationships and
structures']{.underline} (2012:, p. 284). Thus, [**addressing discourse
is addressing 'questions of how knowledge, truth and meaning are
constituted'** (]{.underline}Spegele, 1992, p. 148[). Rather than
describing objective truths, **discourses have their own inherent
logic**, and 'anyone who classiﬁes an issue as a "security problem"
makes a **political rather than an analytical decision'**]{.underline}
(Eriksson, 1999, p.315). [Poststructural conceptions of the
relationships between power, knowledge, and discourse, therefore, become
central in understanding these constructions because **knowledge
'establish\[es\] authority, and this in turn creates a new analytical
optic for discourse analysis of foreign policy'**]{.underline} (Hansen,
2006, p. 8).Because security emerges from subjective interpretations of
how identity impacts foreign policy (Hansen, 2006), [the]{.underline}
China [threat is not objectively valid, but discursively
produced]{.underline}. Textual analysis helps uncover how something so
seemingly concrete is actually socially con-structed and based on social
contexts not objective 'facts' (Eaglestone & Pitt, 1998, p. 309).CNOOC
and Huawei provide the foci for analysis and discursive examinations
will help to show how China is produced, and reproduced as a threat
actor. [Analysis of 'text and talk']{.underline} will help [uncover the
'**central role that institutions play in the analysis of discourse and
that discourse occupies in institutional practices'**]{.underline}
(Holzscheiter, 2010, p. 22). Textual analysis will reveal the
securitization processes that position China as a threat to US
interests. Hansen's Security as Practice (2006) oﬀers a framework for
analysis and this paper employs similar intertextual models that address
particular genres in order to explore the securitization process. Oﬃcial
discourse, including US government statements, demonstrates how the
China Threat Discourse has become institutionalized via CNOOC and
Huawei. Presidential addresses and other oﬃcial statements are used to
explore the position of the American Self. Engaging with the Chinese
Other would require a scope beyond that which is allowed here. The paper
examines **[wider foreign policy debate]{.underline}** as it **[helps
demonstrate audience acceptance of oﬃcial discourses]{.underline}**, as
well as [how]{.underline} the China [Threat Discourse reinforces, and is
reinforced by other discourses of critical infrastructure]{.underline}.
Cultural representations are also essential to understand the
con-struction of the China threat. While the China Threat Discourse is,
itself, a relatively recent phenomenon, understanding it and locating it
in the current context requires an historical exploration of Western
conceptions and discourses of China that precede the China Threat
Discourse. Cultural texts that are explored include early missionary
accounts, travelogues, and other artefacts. Intertextual [discourse
analysis helps expose the essential process of
securitization,]{.underline} although this article contends that the
case studies highlight [limitations with the dichotomy between 'normal'
and 'exceptional' politics]{.underline} as outlined by the Copenhagen
School (CS). Critics argue that this conception of securitization is
undertheorized (Balzacqet al., 2016, p. 499), and more nuanced concepts
that transform the 'notion of security, the speech act into security,
the translation' (Stritzel, 2011, p. 343) help ensure that
securitization, writ large, retains its utility. [Subtler readings help
frame how **an issue can be given 'suﬃcient saliency to win the assent
of the audience, which enables those who are authorized to handle the
issue to use whatever means they deem most
appropriate**]{.underline}**'**(Balzacq et al., 2016, p. 495), while
addressing the methodological shortcomings of the binary between
security and insecurity. Because it has occurred as a gradual process,
the securitization of China helps to reveal the limitations of the
dualistic conception of security, and highlight the eﬃcacy of more
gradual and translational approaches.

#### Questions of discourse and representation are key- debate's emphasis on research makes this a prior question and ethical responsibility of each participant

**Murphy, 22**---Banting Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of
Political Studies at Queen's University (Michael, "Entangled observers?
A quantum perspective on authority in critical security studies,"

If the [research]{.underline} apparatus is not defined by its laboratory
instrumentation, then what is it? Well, for Barad, '[apparatuses are
specific material configurations]{.underline}, or rather, dynamic
(re)configurings of the world [through which bodies are **intra-actively
materialized**]{.underline} ... [apparatuses are not bounded objects or
structures]{.underline}; [they are open-ended practices]{.underline}'
(Barad Citation2007, 169--170). If [the apparatus is **fundamentally
entangled** with the matter under observation in a broader
phenomenon]{.underline}, then [the]{.underline} former [idea of
ontological objectivity **evaporates**]{.underline} with the notion of
definitive borders and boundaries. In its place we find a new agential
kind of objectivity, where what defines [the research
apparatus]{.underline} is that 'the apparatus [enacts an **agential
cut**]{.underline} ... [within the phenomenon]{.underline}' (Barad
Citation2007, 175). While Barad's new materialist commitments recognise
the agency of nonhuman actants, their key argument about the
experimental apparatus is that [the decision to **observe** should be
understood as an act of **agency** within a broader
context]{.underline}. [As researcher]{.underline}, [I am an
**intra-actor**]{.underline} Footnote5 [exercising agency within a
system and participating in the construction of measurements and
findings]{.underline}. [I am **responsible** and
**accountable**]{.underline} (Barad Citation2007, 382) [for the
**entanglements** and **collapses** that I help enact with the research
apparatus and social context]{.underline}. Because the researcher,
research apparatus and object of attention are all entangled with one
another and within a broader natural/cultural and social/material
phenomenon, [the researcher has an **ethical duty** to
intra-act]{.underline} responsibly in a manner that balances a respect
for nonhuman agency [without **deflecting** responsibility]{.underline}
onto other human or nonhuman entanglements (Barad Citation2007, 391).
Through the process of becoming researcher, I emerge from the
pre-existing relation of observation, and [my entanglement within this
system entails an **ethical responsibility** to the **full description**
of my]{.underline} social and experimental [positionality within
it]{.underline}.Footnote6

In addition to Barad's exposition of entanglement as it relates to the
ethical stakes of transparency in research as a natural/cultural and
social/material process, we find a more directly political reflection in
Patricia Noxolo's quantum-inspired work on entanglement in social,
spatiotemporal and emancipatory contexts. In her application of quantum
ideas to cultural analysis, entanglement (and superposition) provides a
more direct expression of the postcolonial and postdiasporic presents to
explain and futures to explore. Similar to the work of Karen Barad, we
encounter in Noxolo's work a quantum social theory that is dynamic,
relational and agential:

Just as the post- of postcolonial is about living with a continued
entanglement with the colonial, the post- of postdiaspora is about
living with the continued consequences of the diasporic move, within the
postcolonial conditions that have motivated a wider range of movements
to former colonial centres, and which determine the conditions of
settlement. Postdiaspora denotes a legacy of diaspora but also of the
colonial, and neither is yet settled. (Noxolo Citation2020, 137)

The colonial, like the diaspora, remains entangled with the social
system of its subsequent post- form, and like any entangled system, the
latter cannot be fully understood independently. While connectedness
need not always be framed in quantum terms, the non-locality of
spatio-temporality in Noxolo's social theory clearly connects quantum
ideas with the postcolonial and decolonial. While the Newtonian
assumptions of colonial politics (see Bowman Citation2021) are rife with
local-realist reductionism, a quantum postcoloniality radically rejects
this fixed spatial scale: 'reality is not actually determined at the
local scale: [each local reality is **inextricably linked** with very
many elsewheres]{.underline}' (Noxolo Citation2020, 136). [Transversal
connections bind]{.underline} homeland, hostland and global family
[relations **far exceeding** the local]{.underline} realism of Newtonian
social science. Similarly, Noxolo frames the temporal connectivity as a
temporally nonlocal entanglement with colonial violences and histories.
'There is a very intimate, entangled affect around place and identity in
indigenous and decolonial theories,' she says, which 'starts from the
embodied self in place, and the violences done to the body, to place, as
well as to the entangled relations between them' (Noxolo Citation2018,
803). Taking this political dimension of Noxolo's project seriously, we
come to realise that quantum social theory supports decolonial and
postcolonial politics both ontologically (insofar as its relationality
gives voice to colonial, diasporic and other relations ontologically
erased by Newtonian separability) and epistemologically (insofar as the
very possibility of a quantum social theory deflates the universalising
claim to knowledge found within the tacitly Newtonian social science).

But there is something even more fascinating to be found here, at least
in the context of [this]{.underline} special issue's theme on authorship
and authority is concerned, because Noxolo's account [emphasises the
creative authority of written expression in **forwarding political
goals**]{.underline}. [It is by]{.underline} creative
[expression]{.underline} -- the authority [of activist and academic
alike]{.underline} -- through a quantum worldview [that we can
contribute to the **broader emancipatory politics** of
critique]{.underline}.Footnote7 [Language serves as the **medium** for
non-local community-building and writing can thereby **directly
support** the pursuit of postcolonial political projects]{.underline}
(Noxolo and Preziuso Citation2012, 133). Furthermore, 'decolonial
writing ... reflects very acutely on these body-place entanglements, and
the epistemic questions they raise in and for academic work' (Noxolo
Citation2018, 803). Just as Barad calls for the rejection of a binary
between nature and culture, Noxolo similarly draws on quantum notions of
entanglement to express the connectivity of body and place. We find,
also, meaningful resonance of this account of decolonial writing within
Zanotti's (Citation2018, Citation2021) quantum IR, where agents are
called to recognise their embeddedness in material/cultural phenomena
and the radical, relational responsibility entailed by that
entanglement.Footnote8 Finally, I would like to suggest that Karen
O'Brien's (Citation2021) account of transformational change becoming
possible through a recognition of our entanglements helps us to
understand the agential dimension of this decolonial project. While
O'Brien's empowering call that '**[you matter more than you
think]{.underline}**' emerges in the context of an agent facing the
existential threat of climate change and certainly resonates there, we
find a new emancipation when we read O'Brien and Noxolo in a diffracted
manner: decolonial quantum social theory asserts that the marginalised,
colonised and displaced peoples matter; that their places in the world
matter; and that their actions matter. Let us not underplay the
emancipatory significance of this quantum move.

Critical security studies and entangled observation: three insights on
authorship

[The ways we **imagine** how the world is made **shapes** what we
consider **politically possible**]{.underline}. [Knowledge and how we
validate it are **political acts**]{.underline}. Quantum ontological
imaginary repositions us vis-à-vis the universe. In engaging the world
as agents, [we do not act as **monadic**]{.underline}, perpetually
[**divided** subjects endowed with a reason capable of **understanding
God's plan**]{.underline} and elevating us closer to him, [but as
**entangled** phenomena that are part of what-is]{.underline}. We do not
act upon the world. Instead, we have agency as part of it. (Zanotti
Citation2021, 458)

Quantum IR is not the first new imaginary to be proposed in critical
International Relations (e.g. Cohn Citation1987), though its particular
path is novel. The new research community at the nexus of critical and
quantum approaches describe the quantum world as offering a novel
imaginary that challenges the positionality of the human, the
researcher, and -- most importantly for the topic of this special issue
-- the author vis-à-vis the social world, if not the entire universe
(Zanotti Citation2018; Murphy Citation2021). [The inseparability of
observers from their social relations]{.underline}, [the
experiment]{.underline}, [and the observations **challenges
fundamentally** the positivist imaginary]{.underline} grounding much of
mainstream social sciences. To this end, quantum social theory's lessons
for epistemology, methodology, ethics and politics should come as no
surprise to many critical security studies scholars -- but that, as they
say, is a feature rather than a bug. Many of the arguments voiced in
earlier moments of critical security studies (such as the broadening and
deepening debate and the methods turn) are triangulated from the first
principles of a quantum perspective. Therefore, in addition to providing
a common language to describe the entanglement of the observer to the
observed and the author to the text, there is also a freedom from
Newtonian/positivist constraints that must first be fought back against
in the earlier efforts within critical theory. This section discusses
three conceptual intersections of critical and quantum thought to help
address the question, 'What is an Author?'

Full description of the apparatus includes the observerFootnote9

[Authorship is an **essential** part of the research
process]{.underline}, just [as the designer of the apparatus becomes
**entangled** with its construction through the choices
made]{.underline} and the observer effect entangles the observer with
the ontological (and/or epistemological, depending upon the
interpretation) status of the wavefunction. This is a concern expressed
well in the language of the methods turn, from Mutlu's repudiation of
sanitised methods sections that erase researcher's footsteps to
Leander's description of the embeddedness and embodiment of ethnographic
observation. The conceptual discussion of Bohr and empirical discussion
of the Stern--Gerlach experiment provide a clear argument from a quantum
perspective for the necessity of including the researcher in the
description of the experiment. And, given that the decisions continue
far into the process of writing, [entanglement of the researcher with
knowledge-production continues well into the stage of
authorship]{.underline}.

The social construction of knowledge extends into its social context

Barad's deconstruction of the Stern--Gerlach apparatus points out how
the conditions of possibility for the production of silver sulphide rely
not merely on the materiality of a particular cigar, but also on the
cultural influences of gender, class, social norms and myriad other
factors that influence the scholar's positionality in approaching the
research process. Like Stern's cheap cigar, [we may not
**expect**]{.underline} ([and]{.underline} post-hoc, we [may **naively
ignore**]{.underline}) [the importance of social factors in contouring
the **conditions of possibility** for the knowledge production in which
we participate]{.underline}, [but recognising the entanglement of
society into research is **paramount** to ensuring]{.underline} that the
[full description]{.underline} proposed so many decades ago by Bohr can
be ensured. Here, too, we uncover the utility of quantum concepts, as
Noxolo's use of entanglement to expresses identity, continued historical
influences and relationality in postcolonial, postdiasporic and
Indigenous theories.

Authorship enacts agential cuts into the broader socio-material context

[The broader **political implications** of scholarship are]{.underline}
already [documented in the]{.underline} broadening debate and methods
turn, with the Aberystwyth school arguing for the [**inherent political
stakes** of defining **security**]{.underline} and Mutlu highlighting
the emancipatory power of openly shared knowledge. Quantum transforms
this conversation both by expanding the scope of relevant agency while
also raising the ethical stakes of responsibility in becoming entangled
with the broader research context. The author does not have a monopoly
on agency in the research process (nor even authorship). Material
configurations of computers, servers and internet connections facilitate
the recording and sharing of the written word, while [social
constellations]{.underline} support research financially, incentivise
placement in prestigious venues and [**discipline debates** to privilege
**established** and **mainstream** perspectives]{.underline}. But [at
the same time]{.underline}, the agential cut that the author makes by
participating in the production of knowledge cannot be effaced by the
existence of agency beyond the self, and [the author bears an **ethical
responsibility** to their entanglements]{.underline}. While this may
seem to be a burden or a negative statement, Noxolo's discussion of the
ability of language to foster nonlocal community-building reveals that
ethical entanglement can be as emancipatory as it is daunting.

Conclusion

Approaching entanglement through language allows us to consider that
'**[meaningful]{.underline}**' [conversations can **influence** how we
**engage with social change**]{.underline}: [when we are **aware** that
we are entangled within]{.underline} a quantum system and part of [the
phenomena that we are measuring]{.underline}, [we have **greater
potential** to **open up inquiries** with others and **generate
insights** that are **truly transformative**]{.underline}. (O'Brien
Citation2021, 70)

In the end, then, what is an author [in critical security
studies]{.underline}? Inspired by quantum social theory, I argue that
[the critical author is an **entangled observer**]{.underline}, [an
**intra-actor** who recognises the agency that emerges from the
practices and processes of scholarship]{.underline} (beyond the self)
[and the **unerasable ethical responsibility** for the agential cuts
that the author helps to enact]{.underline}. [It is not only the
definition of **what counts as security** that has **ethico-political
implications** for authors and their contexts]{.underline}. [Nor
is]{.underline} the fulsome account of [methodology]{.underline} and
social positionality of research [relevant **solely** as a matter
of]{.underline} transparency, rigour, or [research ethics]{.underline}.
Quantum social theory suggests that [these considerations are **woven
together**]{.underline}, inseparably entangled and only fully
understandable in relation to the other. Quantum IR places the
broadening debate and the methods turn in superposition, challenging all
to recognise responsibility, transparency and agency in the production
of what Karen O'Brien calls truly transformative insights.

In an important way, this recognition of the ethical stakes of academic
creativity brings our conversation on authorship back to the common root
of authority. [When we take on the **authorial role**]{.underline}, [we
enact our authority in the word and in the world]{.underline}.
[Recognising this connectivity of word to world demands]{.underline}, in
turn, [the **acknowledgement** of our entanglement in our
surroundings]{.underline}. [This is true of our place in
**institutions**]{.underline}, [our connectedness to our **subject
matter**]{.underline}, [our embeddedness in the **research process** and
beyond]{.underline}. And, [recognising the **ethical imperatives** of
entanglement]{.underline} in quantum social theory (Barad Citation2007;
Zanotti Citation2018, Citation2021), it is precisely this recognition of
the fundamental connectivity between authorship/authority that [infuses
critique with a **transformational agency**]{.underline} (O'Brien
Citation2021). As scholarship continues to explore the quantum/critical
nexus, authors will help to enact a variety of agential cuts, embedded
and embodied in the research that they collaborate to produce.

#### While the speech act is harmful in itself, its success isn't determined until you accept it -- don't let them capitalize on your ingrained fears and vulnerability to convince you of their threats.

**Markiewicz 24** \[(Postdoctoral Research Fellow in IR at [Uppsala

The securitisation literature underlines that [in order to be
successful, a security act needs to be externally validated: 'the issue
is securitised only if and when the audience accepts it as
such]{.underline}' (Buzan et al., 1998, p. 25). Unfortunately, in
research practice, the conditions of a successful speech act are rarely
discussed. [Many]{.underline} of the empirical [studies have put aside
inquiries into 'what' processes stand behind successful security
acts,]{.underline} instead focusing on answering 'how' securitisation is
used. This [leads to the implicit assumption of the audience's
passivity. The widespread presence of a vulnerability in security
practices challenges this outlook]{.underline} and underlines the
intersubjective character of security. [In order to be successful and
gain acceptance from the population, a security act refers to and builds
on collective vulnerabilities. Vulnerability]{.underline} is what ties
the political elites and their constituents. It [is a common denominator
on which securitisation is predicated. By accounting for it, we give a
greater sense of agency to the audience.]{.underline}
[Vulnerability]{.underline} is a crucial tool of inquiry into the
ideational processes and sociological characteristics of securitisation.
It [can be used as a platform allowing us to conceptualise
securitisation, not as a top-down]{.underline} 14 [but a relational
process where the (security) meaning is negotiated between the political
actor and the audience]{.underline} (Roe, 2012). [It increases our
awareness of non-instrumental reasoning behind states' employment of
security.]{.underline} Vulnerability contributes to developing our
understanding of what constitutes a successful security act. It [links
the security act]{.underline} [(designator of threat) with the
self-perceptions of the audience]{.underline}. It accounts for the fact
that [collective fears of threats are not necessarily a political given,
coming from the top, but rather a situated outcome of their
identiﬁcations.]{.underline} Drawing on the second-generation
securitisation theorists (e.g. Balzacq, 2005; Floyd,2007; Stritzel,
2007), the article moves towards a more contextual understanding of the
threats and fears (broadly perceived as foundations for securitisation).
Employing Furedi and Mills' writings, it is contended that the key
securitisation studies under-theorise how [threats and fears are
mediated by the personal values of actors.]{.underline} [It is not a
threat that constructs our fears, but our sense-making that decides
whether we are vulnerable to a particular threat, or not]{.underline}.
[Vulnerability]{.underline} is ordered as a primary phenomenon from
which fear and threat stem from. Its presence [illustrates the
conditionality of threat and the fact that securitisations hinge on
deep-seated identiﬁcations of the collective]{.underline}. By
acknowledging the role of vulnerability in the politics of security we
problematise the normative dimension of critical security studies.
[Vulnerability of the securitised and the securitiser cannot be equated
with the acquittal of the security act. It does not undermine the
negative implications of security and is not advocating against the
emancipatory politics of desecuritisation.]{.underline} However, it
[goes against the reductionist coupling of securitisation with
socio-political failure]{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998, p. 209; 29).
There is political importance in the central role vulnerability plays in
security practices. [The fear and precariousness of actors]{.underline}
(see Markiewicz, 2023) [that securitise our surroundings must be
accounted for in the coming debates about the role securitisation plays
in the political.]{.underline}

### Discourse Key

#### Securitization discourse is key to understanding policy---only through a critical analysis of the representations of the affirmative can we resolve threats

[Critical geopolitics has been negatively assessed for generally lacking
an explicit and systematic methodology for data collection and analysis
-- criticisms that could be applied to securitization studies as
well]{.underline}. While studies that avoid this criticism are certainly
not as "comparatively rare," as Müller (2010, 2) referred to them a
decade ago, his point is well-taken: [the field would only benefit from
a stronger methodological foundation for content analysis]{.underline}.
This is especially [important for discourse tracing and narrative
analysis, since they are both **driven by an examination of speech acts
in order to move from the "what to how" and to show how discourse is
used to "create or transform a certain phenomenon, policy, or action
over time**"]{.underline} (LeGreco and Tracy 2009, 1522). At its core,
[**secur- itization studies** seek to]{.underline} do the same thing**:
[explain]{.underline}** [how an object is transformed into an
existential threat by a subject.]{.underline} According to Müller (2010,
7), "[discourse must first and foremost be treated as a corpus whose
organisation is systematic and subject to certain
regularities]{.underline}," and that [by studying "patterns and
regularities in the construction and altera- tion of discourses" **we
can gain deeper insights into how it is constructed and how it
evolved.**]{.underline} [Discourse tracing works best when primary
sources are gath- ered in such a way as "to detect the emergence of
social processes across time and context," as well as to "articulate
those discourses that are absent"]{.underline} (LeGreco and Tracy 2009,
1526). In order to gather consistent data from policymakers, this
article utilizes congressional testimony by executive branch officials
as its primary resource.

#### Our discourse matters -- the day-to-day politics translated through debate shapes our conceptions of the China threat.

Nyman notes that 'while the relationship has seen many securitizing
moves before, full successful securitization has not occurred in energy
relations between the US and China before Unocal' (2014, p. 45). Far
from suggesting that this singular event deﬁnes the process in its
entirety, the securitization of China that became acute during CNOOC's
bid for Unocal was actually predicated, in many ways, on moves that
preceded it. Further-more, the CNOOC event was an important milestone in
a securitization process that actually reached fruition with Huawei over
a decade later. The case studies illustrate how the CS' division between
levels of politics and extraordinary measures becomes somewhat
indistinct in the contemporary context as new iterations of the China
threat exist mostly within the realm of normal politics. Gad and

Of course, [threat perceptions are not the same as threat
discourse/narratives]{.underline}. Nonetheless, these paradigms have
provided scholars with a structure for analysis which can be of use to
us here, given that these [studies have almost always used
discourse/narratives to gage why a particular state was perceived as
threatening -- either because of their material power (capabilities),
inherent nature (identity), or perceived purposes
(intentions).]{.underline} Precisely because they used
discourse/narratives as their primary source of evidence, this
[tripartite division can serve as a framework for coding how executive
branch testimony has sought to securitize these states in a manner which
is both systematic and manageable,]{.underline} as well as one which is
firmly rooted in both the IRT literature and preexisting studies of
these countries. While it does limit the coding from a purely inductive
analysis, this [framework provides a pre-observational struc- ture to
code the testimony in a systematic way that is not solely
interpretative.]{.underline} It mixes inductive and deductive reasoning
by allowing the data from these hearings to speak to the frames which
evolved in these post-Cold War narra- tives, but also having a
connection to the well-established literature on threat
perceptions/narratives. It is also [theoretically justified in that each
of these frames is backed by a substantial literature within IRT and,
more importantly, connects to the key questions involved in the
securitizing move: what can the threatening object do (capabilities),
who or what they are (identity), and what are their goals (intentions)?
Securitizing actors will emphasize one or more of these questions when
developing their narratives. Thus, from this tripartite division, we can
best isolate the specific means by which this rearticulation of the
Russia/China threat has occurred and what this says about America's geo-
political culture]{.underline}. As the below analysis demonstrates, the
**[belief that these states actually intend to endanger America's
position in the international system and the American-dominated world
order is what has elevated them to existential threats in the executive
branch's securitization narratives.]{.underline}**

[Imperialist extractivisms in Alaska and around the Bering Strait began
around 1740]{.underline} under Russian rule, [with the fur and wild
animal trade that drove depletions and extinctions of entire
species]{.underline} (such as Hydrodamalis gigas, Steller\'s sea cow, up
to 8m in length, extinct after just 27 years of their rule) [and the
exploitation of Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. The history of Alaska
also involves British and later American settler colonialisms since the
territory was sold by Russia in 1867 (Gibson, 1980; Hixon, 2013).
[Alaska\'s history is reflected in land ownership patterns, but also in
the salmon industry]{.underline}. There was a military boom from
1940-1960; the discovery of the Prudhoe Bay oil field discovery in 1968;
pipelines built in 1970s, and the State oil-revenue boom in the 1980s
(Foster, 2006). More recently, Kivalina in Alaska, an island severely
threatened by sea levels, has become an emblematic climate justice court
case (EJAtlas, 2020c). The [Iñupiat Indigenous peoples brought Federal
public nuisance claims against 24 fossil fuel giants]{.underline} such
as Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Peabody Energy and Shell (see
Johnson, 2013). Their [main argument is that corporate contributions to
global warming through their emissions of carbon dioxide and other
greenhouse gases are causing damaging coastal storms and erosion that
continuously swallows their land, disturbs fishing practices, and access
rights to their fast disappearing ancestral territories]{.underline}. It
is estimated the island will be completely submerged by 2025. Although
[the case was dismissed]{.underline}, the inhabitants of Kivalina
appealed to the United Nations in January 2020, together with other
peoples in Louisiana also threatened by climate change (EJAtlas, 2020d).
In yet another part of the Alaskan territory, a [private
350-kilometer-long road project named]{.underline} Ambler has been
pursued by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority
(Picture 1 c). [Ambler is a Trump-era \"development\"
project]{.underline} currently being challenged in court, and is under
administrative review by the Biden administration. Pro-project actors
argue that the Ambler Mining District, known for decades to be rich in
copper, magnesium, and gold cannot be fully developed unless there is
extensive access to the deposits (EJAtlas, 2021d). [Indigenous and
non-Indigenous peoples formed the]{.underline} Brooks Range Coalition
([BRC) and have brought to attention potential impacts to caribou
migration from the road infrastructure]{.underline}5 . Mine workers,
however, have partnered with Ambler Metals company behind the project,
to safeguard their jobs (EJAtlas, 2023b). Finally, on April 19, 2024,
the US Interior Department refused the Ambler Road proposal.

[Green extractivisms and climate colonialities are intertwined with past
oil exploitation, uranium and iron mining, LNG extraction, and the
effects of climate change in the Arctic area]{.underline} (Figure 1).
[Colonial consequences affect land and socio-ecological disruptions,
which in turn trigger resistance]{.underline} (Ford et al., 2021; Holz,
2023). Similar findings showing resistance by Indigenous peoples,
reindeer herders, and other supporters against these activities have
been reported in the previous work of Hanaček et al. (2022) as well as
Naykanchina (2012). The 16 cases, as explained below, involve
indivisible sequences of historical and contemporary struggles against
extractivism and climate coloniality in the Arctic, imposed by different
nation-states. Counter-extractivist struggles, both local and worldwide,
are a call for real transformations towards sustainability and social
equity (Scheidel et al., 2018). The sixteen cases reveal four
significant tendencies surrounding green extractivisms and climate
colonialities in the Arctic (Figure 2). The first is a [positive
solution framing of new Arctic extraction by its
proponents]{.underline}, in which discourses, promotions, technological
innovation, [as well as support from nation states and multinational
companies, are performed in an environmentally responsible
manner.]{.underline} This includes greening the full supply chain
including raw material extraction, processing and production, waste
management, transport, and distribution (Garbis et al., 2023). [The
trend also involves specific references to the Nordic context, where oil
and mining activities have (supposedly) always been committed to
environmental and socioeconomic improvements]{.underline} (Egerman et
al., 2003). [In Russia, greening the supply chain is associated with the
modernization of]{.underline} industrial [(Soviet)
facilities]{.underline}, which would allow for further development of
emerging energy transition materials, LNG and nuclear power utility in
the supply chain, and overall global trade (Venovcevs, 2021; Wu et al.,
2021). [In the]{.underline} Canadian and the [US]{.underline} parts of
the Arctic, th[e need for additional infrastructure or expansion of
existing mines]{.underline} (copper, iron) [are justified and promoted
because of the growing demand for energy transition metals and
infrastructure]{.underline}. In Greenland, uranium and rare earths, both
of which are radioactive, are promoted as helpful for combating climate
change and for independence. These findings are in line with the work of
Össbo (2023), who proposes that [green colonialism blends past
expropriation with contemporary deprivation]{.underline}. Historically
contested energy and mining projects have previously been discussed as
part of the contemporary green transition and \"sacrifice zones\" in the
Arctic. We connect such processes to the climate emergency affecting
Arctic peoples. [The region\'s extractivism-based development has
resulted in a scenario in which the interests of the fuel, mining, and
now green energy complexes are framed as \"required\" to deliver a
\"solution\" to climate change]{.underline} (Dorn et al., 2022;
Gelderloos, 2022; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). [Arctic Indigenous
peoples regard climate change problems and solutions to it as a
continuation of colonialism, with strong ties between capitalism and
extractivisms\' past and current act]{.underline}s (Callison, 2014;
Whyte, 2017). The second tendency is that [Arctic socio-environmental
and atmospheric violence becoming inextricably linked]{.underline}
(DeBoom, 2022; Hughes et al., 2023), [forming colonial
atmosphere]{.underline}s through a variety of political, social,
economic, and environmental means (Mahony & Endfield, 2018; Osborne &
Carlson, 2023). In this [(neo)colonial climate-led resource frontier
expansion, non- and anti-extractivist forms of knowledge and ways of
being are systemically ignored]{.underline} (Kröger, 2022), [and serve
as a foundation for global green extractivism, increased energy use, and
the destruction of human and other-than-human nature]{.underline}
(Sheller, 2023; Sultana, 2022). We came across several Arctic
\"sacrifice zones\" that can be compared to other studies explaining
climate induced crises of green accumulation and hegemonic profiteering
in colonized countries and regions (Andreucci et al., 2023; DeBoom,
2022; Dunlap, 2023). Here, [epistemic, ontological, infrastructural, and
atmospheric violence are central to
colonial-extractivism(s).]{.underline}

### AT: Extractivism def too broad

#### Their definition of extraction is over generalized leading to a lack of accountability\-- our supply web centered definition establishes accountability by examining the root of extractivism.

**Dunlap et. al. 24** \[(Dr. Alexander Dunlap is a research scientist at
the Boston University Institute for Global Sustainability (IGS). Judith

This conceptual expansion of extractivism has received pushbacks. To
maintain conceptual clarity, Gudynas (2021, 6) contends that the four
\'classical\' attributes mentioned above \"must be met\" if a project is
going to be considered extractivist. This will help us avoid \"falling
into the trap of thinking that any activity with severe
socioenvironmental impacts represents extractivism.\"
[Others]{.underline}, like Imre Szeman and Jennifer Wenzel (2021), [have
also voiced skepticism]{.underline} around an expanded understanding of
extractivism. [They argue that the concept has become overly broad when
also encompassing symbolic and knowledge production]{.underline}. By
including such diverse realms, they contend, important historical,
geographical, and cultural distinctions are overlooked, hindering a
comprehensive understanding of extraction\'s specific operations.
Indeed, [the primary concern of calling everything
extractivism,]{.underline} as Gudynas (2021, 4) warns, [is that \"rigor
and precision \[will be\] lost]{.underline}.\" A lack of rigor and
precision [generates \"ambiguity,\" which]{.underline}---Gudynas (2021,
4) explains---[allows advocates of mineral and oil companies, including
states, \"to insist that any use or abuse of Nature was ultimately
extractivism, and therefore it should be]{.underline} tolerated and
[protected as a fundamental condition for humanity]{.underline} \[sic\]
survival.\" [Dunlap]{.underline} (2021a, 2023a, 5) [refutes this line of
argumentation]{.underline} by reminding us that \"[the misuse and
manipulation of information by mining companies and politicians should
never temper our criticisms or assessments.\"]{.underline} Thus, [the
fact that corporations can use a broad interpretation of extractivism to
their advantage should not limit a thorough discussion of its conceptual
meaning and analytical purchase.]{.underline} While the argument for
conceptual boundary-making is understandable, we contend that [the
classic criteria for extractivism remain inadequate]{.underline}. They
[suffer from a nationalist and state-centered approach]{.underline} by
focusing on the national economy, material export/import rates and how
foreign influence shapes national policies. Consequently, [they ignore
the networked, multi-scalar nature of extractivism, which extends far
beyond the point of extraction, interlinking people, places and
nature(s) through global financial operations and complex supply-chains.
A narrow focus]{.underline} on a single point of extraction [obscures
the prior extractive operations required to produce the technology,
equipment and energy that enable this extraction]{.underline} (Dunlap,
2023a; Artiga-Purcell, 2024). The ubiquity of water-use within mining
and industrial production indicates another point of networked and
multilayered impact of conventional and green extractivism (Tetreault &
McCulligh, 2018; Caretta et al., 2020). Challenging Gudynas\' (2021)
distinction between non-extractive and extractive modes of resource
appropriation, Alejandro Artiga-Purcell (2024, 5) notices how [classic
approaches to extractivism]{.underline} not only \"[overlooks the uneven
geographies of production within countries]{.underline}\" --- such as
far-removed points of processing or consumption---but also [fails to
account for the \"analytical isolation, separation, categorization, and
ranking of categories that typifies \[the\] taxonomic thinking\'\' that
shapes extractive activities]{.underline} like sand or gravel mining
(Artiga-Purcell, 2024, 5). [Classic approaches therefore lead to
obscuring broader crises]{.underline} embedded in value chains of, for
example, building materials like concrete or glass production4 and
overlooking the relational politics of extractive activities. [Similar
critiques]{.underline} have been [raised regarding agrarian
extractivism]{.underline}. [Focusing solely]{.underline} on [the
classica]{.underline}l ([state-centric]{.underline}) attributes of
[extractivism]{.underline} (McKay, 2020; McKay et al., 2021) [leads to
overlooking networked]{.underline} and accumulative regional
[impacts]{.underline} (Tetreault et al., 2021), but also [the entire
supply-webs of agricultural mechanization]{.underline}, the production
of chemical inputs and pesticides as well as the digital applications
and surveillance integrated into plantations (Dunlap, 2021a, 2023a).
[Digital technologies are now notoriously central to
ag]{.underline}ricultural [production]{.underline} (Rotz et al., 2019;).
As Glenn Stone reminds us, these technologies \"are becoming established
as the next major external input into agriculture and are used on over
75% of corn acres in the United States, 80% of grain farms in Australia
and two-thirds of all arable land in the Netherlands\" (2022, 608). In
sum, [there is an extensive multi-sectorial, multi-scalar production
network of extractivism(s) that enables ag]{.underline}rarian
[extractivism to take place. This demonstrates the relevance of further
developing and exploring digital extractivisms]{.underline} (Chagnon et
al., 2021, 2022; Brodie, 2024). Looking critically at these supply webs
implies expanding how we identify and measure the volume of extracted
material and the intensity of extraction.5 It also implies looking
differently at foreign influence and ownership, which we do not consider
a determining factor for extractivism. [National industry concentrations
and processes of \'internal\' colonization can be manifestations of
extractivism without involving much foreign capital]{.underline}.
Finally, [a supply-web rather than point-of-extraction-centered
understanding of extractivism(s) will extend accountability for
ecosystem degradation and habitat loss.]{.underline} These observations
show the unbounded nature of the material and the sectoral extent of
extractivism, which deserves further unpacking and investigation.

physical processes of extraction, but also their embodied and gendered
impacts. [The body, human or otherwise,]{.underline} Latin American
decolonial feminisms have shown (Ulloa, 2016; Cabnal, 2018; Caretta et

waters, kill trees and abuse the soil, this violence, among other acts,
becomes embedded within bodies]{.underline} (Cruz et al., 2020). [The
same applies to abusing, killing and traumatizing people and other
beings.]{.underline} The [result is fear, illness]{.underline} and
[erratic and harmful behavior,]{.underline} which can lead to [hurting
animals, forests, rivers, mountains, humans and other more-than-human

### AT: Perms

### [AT: Realism]{.underline}

#### Realist theory outdated and real-world application of realism fails- Realist advocacy during Iraq war proves

**Van Rythoven '15** (Eric Van Rythoven, Department of Political
Science, Carleton University, "The perils of realist advocacy and the
promise of securitization theory: Revisiting the tragedy of the Iraq War
debate", European Journal of International Relations, 22(3), 487-511,

Kenneth Waltz may have been correct in that states are security
maximizers, but today, this may be occurring in a profoundly different
way than he originally envisioned. His famous dictum argues that states
look to maximize security though a balance of power that discourages
both predation and counterbalancing (Waltz, 1979: 126). [However, since
the end of the Cold War, we have seen a distinctively different sense of
security maximization: an ever-expanding domain of security issues.
Despite appeals to the contrary (e.g. Walt, 1991), the broadening of
security has risen to the status of international institutions,
globalization and great power rivalry in terms of being a central, if
ambiguous, feature of contemporary world politics.]{.underline} Evidence
of this broadening is pervasive. The executive summary of the Pentagon's
recent 'Quadrennial defense review' begins with the clichéd claim that
the [US 'faces a rapidly changing security environment', defined not
only by interstate war, but also by 'sectarian conflict' and
cyber-threats]{.underline} (DoD, 2014: iii). While intended to limit
great power conflict, the United Nations (UN) Security Council now
increasingly deliberates over the dangers of infectious diseases
including HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS, 2011), Polio (UN News Centre, 2013) and,
more recently, Ebola (UNSC, 2014). The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe offers an even starker example. Its 'comprehensive
and co-operative' approach to security holds arms control, the rule of
law and minority rights as all equally viable 'security' concerns (OSCE,
2009: ii). This broadening includes the wholesale addition of new
sectoral concerns (e.g. cyber-security), as well as an intensifying of
traditional dangers. [Once materially insignificant and geographically
distant 'rogue' states, terrorists groups and local militias are now
nderstood by policymakers and publics alike as 'genuine' threats to
international security]{.underline}. Debates over what is and is not a
security issue are now akin to a rowdy dinner table where several ---
often uninvited --- guests rub elbows with more traditional military
concerns. [In the midst of this broadening, there is a serious political
and practical concern for realist scholars of security. If a state is
encumbered by an ever-expanding security agenda that consumes more and
more resources and promotes reckless adventurism abroad, what then will
be left when the genuine problem of great power conflict emerges
again]{.underline}? As a corrective, realists have repeatedly, and often
admirably, engaged in sustained advocacy campaigns to convince publics
and policymakers alike of the need to constrain the national security
agenda. Lost in the extensive literature on the realist tradition is a
rich history of political practice embodied by E.H. Carr's interwar
polemic against liberal idealism (Cox, 2001), Hans Morgenthau's and
Kenneth Waltz's resistance to the Vietnam war (Oren, 2009), and even
contemporary neorealism's criticism of the US's role in Iraq (Payne,
2007; Schmidt and Williams, 2008). While realist advocacy is diverse,
speaking out against expansive conceptions of national security, or
'threat inflation' as it is more commonly known, is a recurrent theme.1
[While previous works by Payne (2007) and Oren (2009) highlight the key
tensions between neorealist theory and practice, this article joins
Schmidt and Williams (2008) in questioning why such advocacy
fails]{.underline}. Like Schmidt and Williams, I see the 2003 Iraq War
as a crucial example of realism's failure to influence public debate and
to curb an expansive vision of national security.2 Also, in line with
Schmidt and Williams, I am broadly sympathetic to explanations rooted in
how a variety of 'symbolic and political resources' (Schmidt and
Williams, 2008: 194) were employed rhetorically by neoconservatives
against realists. [My concern, however, is that this explanation elides
how realists sceptical of the Iraqi threat were committed to a very
specific model of advocacy anchored in the metaphorical marketplace of
ideas. In this ironically liberal model of public discourse, the market
valuation of the Iraqi threat was grossly inflated, something to be
corrected through the provision of superior information and reasoning.
Even if realists had been sensitive to the value of the rhetorical
resources outlined by Schmidt and Williams --- and I believe at some
level that they were --- the marketplace of ideas model is predicated on
objective rational actors debating over facts and logic, not values. It
is against this backdrop of a tacitly liberal model of discourse that I
argue for the value of securitization theory in explaining the failure
of realist political advocacy]{.underline}. Contra the marketplace of
ideas, securitization theory envisions debates over security as
explicitly power-laden, where 'some actors are placed in positions of
power by virtue of being generally accepted voices of security' (Buzan
et al., 1998: 31). Focusing specifically on the 2003 Iraq War debate, I
examine how rhetorical resources in the form of identity and emotion
were employed by neoconservatives against realists. Of course, the term
'advocacy' has a wide array of meanings and can be studied in a number
of different ways. These include Kingdon's (1995) classic framework
centred on problem, policy and politics streams, studies of
transnational advocacy networks (Keck and Sikkink, 1998), accounts
rooted in Habermasian forms of deliberative argument (Risse, 2000), and
Weberian interventions focused on objective analyses (Jackson and
Kaufman, 2007). Yet, the use of the term 'advocacy' here is less
concerned with its deliberative, persuasive or educational dimensions,
important as they may be. An advocate, as is so often represented in US
legal dramas, can be engaged in a forceful and competitive struggle.
Rather than being an exercise in 'soft power', practices of advocacy can
entail 'representational force' (Bially Mattern, 2005) and even
'rhetorical coercion' (Krebs and Jackson, 2007). [The unique value of
securitization theory, then, is how it envisions security discourse as a
competitive field structured by an uneven distribution of
power.]{.underline} This offers a distinct path into realist advocacy
that exists apart from conventionally liberal approaches focused on
peaceful Habermasian dialogue under cooperative ideal-speech conditions
(Krebs and Jackson, 2007: 39--40). The added value of this strategy,
then, is that by presenting the securitization framework as the 'study
\[of\] the power politics' of the concept of security (Buzan et al.,
1998: 32), the analysis is parsed in fundamentally realist terms. [The
resulting encounter between realism and securitization theory is then
ripe for dialogue as it presents a critique that speaks the 'language'
of realism and is less defined by outsider challenge than by familial
resemblance.]{.underline} In making this argument, I begin by tracing
contemporary neorealism's anaemic interventions to a critique of threat
inflation rooted in the liberal model of the marketplace of ideas.
Despite downplaying questions of (discursive) power, this model
persists, a persistence I trace to a tragic misuse of Kuhnian
incommensurability. The bulk of the article then draws on the tools of
securitization theory to explain the failure of realist advocacy in the
2003 Iraq War debate. While I begin with the Copenhagen School's
'facilitating conditions', [I ultimately stress how processes involving
social identity and collective emotion came to be turned against
realists by their neoconservative interlocutors]{.underline}. Finally,
sensitive to concerns over one-way dialogue, the third section sketches
the beginnings of what may be a common research agenda for realism and
securitization theory organized around a common lingua franca of
statecraft drawn from classical realism. [Ultimately, understanding this
failure is essential for the discipline of International Relations (IR)
for two reasons.]{.underline} First, regardless of empirical and
theoretical differences with realist thinkers, there are a number of
scholars within IR who hold sympathetic policy views. On this point,
academia's broadly shared opposition to the 2003 Iraq War looms large
(Peterson et al., 2005: 39). Second, realism is typically held as the
dominant paradigm within IR, particularly within security studies
(Freyberg-Inan, 2004; Krause and Williams, 1996; Miller, 2010). [If the
so-called dominant tradition remains politically impotent, what does
that mean for more marginal approaches in influencing public debate?
Understanding this failure then becomes a pressing question, with
broader implications for understanding the theory--practice divide that
characterizes the field as a whole.]{.underline}

[Threat inflation, in the eyes of these commentators, reflects a
pathological exaggeration of a danger in comparison to the objective
(systemic) distribution of power. In this view, domestic political
elites take issues that represent marginal dangers, at least in
comparison to interstate conflict, and portray them as 'existential
threats']{.underline} (Mearsheimer, 2011a: 21). Thus, John Mearsheimer
(2011a: 22) argues that the 'assessment of America's terrorism problem
... was threat inflation of the highest order' as it took a marginal
danger and portrayed it as 'existential'. In this context, threat
inflation is synonymous with elite 'fear mongering' in order to build
support for policy (Mearsheimer, 2011b: 90--92).4 Concern over threat
inflation is equally evident in Stephen Walt's writing, particularly as
the central theme in a number of his pieces in Foreign Policy magazine
including 'The threat monger's handbook' (Walt, 2009b), 'Is the cyber
threat overblown?' (Walt, 2010) and 'Threat inflation 6.0: Does
al-Shabab really threaten the U.S.?' (Walt, 2013c). In his 2012
endorsement of former Senator Chuck Hagel for the position of secretary
of defense, Walt (2012) suggested that '\[Hagel is\] also not prone to
threat-inflation, which makes him almost unique' within the US foreign
policy establishment. Finally, in his obituary for Kenneth Waltz,
Stephen Walt frames his former supervisor's scepticism of threat
inflation as a significant virtue. He notes that '\[Waltz\] was an early
opponent of the Vietnam War and deeply skeptical of the paranoid
threat-inflation that has informed so much of U.S. foreign and defense
policy' (Walt, 2013b[). For these realists, inflated images of danger
drain resources, draw states into unnecessary conflicts and distract
attention from the 'real' national security issue of great power
competition]{.underline}.5 [At first glance, the concept of threat
inflation has great appeal for realist thought]{.underline}. At its core
is a baseline understanding of foreign policy deliberation as a
'marketplace of ideas', an economic metaphor for politics where public
institutions such as the media help 'to weed out unfounded, mendacious,
or self-serving foreign policy arguments' as open debate ensures that
'reasoning and evidence are subject to public scrutiny' (Kaufman, 2004:
5).6 [In a normally functioning marketplace, rational actors with
adequate information will agree on the ideas with the most value and,
thus, which threats are most significant and deserving of public
attention.]{.underline} Whether one is concerned with the broader public
or more narrowly on political elites, both of these groups are
envisioned as investors and exaggerated threats are akin to an
overvalued share price that would plummet if investors just had the
right information. This microeconomic explanation fits perfectly with
neorealism's enduring preference for social theory based on models of
utility-maximizing actors (Wendt, 1999: 15--16). [Furthermore, by
portraying inflated threats as anomalies from the otherwise timeless
cycles of great power politics, it preserves the centrality of
neorealism's system-level theorizing]{.underline}.7 [Closer scrutiny,
however, reveals deep problems with this formulation. For one, the
concept of threat inflation is deeply utopian. By presupposing a
marketplace of ideas characterized by an orderly and rational public
dialogue, the concept of threat inflation relies on premises
historically chastised as idealistically naive by realists.]{.underline}
Carr offers the classic critique of the marketplace of ideas, where
[liberal utopians presume 'human reason']{.underline} (rational actors)
can discover the underlying 'harmony of interests' (Pareto efficiency)
within a community if they are just given enough time and information
(Carr, 2001 \[1981\]: 43). The contradiction is even sharper for
contemporary realists, who are critical of democratic peace theory
precisely because it holds that robust public information and
deliberation can accurately gauge threats to a community (e.g. Rosato,
2003: 598--599). [One might argue that, here, realists are simply using
the language of threat inflation heuristically while being agnostic with
respect to any underlying domestic marketplace of ideas. Yet, the link
between the two cannot be severed as the former relies on the latter to
be intelligible. What determines the proper valuation of a threat if not
for the underlying marketplace of ideas]{.underline}? Such a valuation
may be determined by elites rather than mass society, but this simply
envisions a more circumscribed market. [In the end, the concept of
threat inflation is meaningless in the absence of a baseline 'market'
comparison to make the idea of 'inflation' intelligible]{.underline}.8
[Moreover, spurning the metaphor of the market means separating the
concept of inflation from its original economic logic of rational
utility-maximizing actors that makes it so appealing to neorealism in
the first place. The problem is that such economic metaphors present a
neutral process of political deliberation that obscures the role of
power. In treating threat perception as a matter of economically
efficient decision-making, realists gloss over why some threats come to
be understood as matters of national security while others remain
mundane. Putting aside concerns over Trojan Horse utopianism, the
concept of threat inflation still suffers from an additional problem of
logical consistency. If threat inflation presupposes a marketplace, then
this marketplace appears perpetually dysfunctional]{.underline}. As the
recent collection of Thrall and Cramer (2009) demonstrates, there is now
a cottage industry of research assessing the roots of persistent market
failure and threat inflation. [What is notable about these contributions
is that explaining threat inflation entails moving away from its
original economic logic and stressing the role of psychology (Jervis,
2009), myths (Snyder, 2009), norms (Cramer, 2009) and language (Krebs
and Lobasz, 2009), to name only a few of the current correctives. This
presents a picture of the marketplace of ideas as an aspirational ideal
of rational choice theory that bears little relation to empirical
reality. This makes it look like an idealist theory, not a realist one.
Moreover, the fact that realists like Walt and Mearsheimer have spent
much of the last decade raising the alarm over threat inflation raises
the question of whether any self-regulating marketplace really exists.
What value does the metaphor of the market add if scholars are always
justifying why it so sharply deviates from practice? The depth of these
problems raises questions over why realism has come to rely on such a
problematic conceptualization of security agenda expansion in the first
place]{.underline}. This is puzzling precisely because of the breadth of
alternatives offered by the widening and deepening debates in the 1990s
(e.g. Baldwin, 1997; Krause, 1998). Why, for example, did the
contribution of securitization theory go completely unnoticed by
realists? Part of the answer needs to acknowledge the national and
cultural divides that are part and parcel of the broader development of
IR between the US and Europe (Buzan and Hansen, 2009; Wæver, 1998). [IR
theory is neither good at being international, nor good at
relating]{.underline}. Yet, I argue that a more robust accounting of
realism's reliance on threat inflation resides in the broader
intellectual trajectory of the discipline, specifically in its
fragmentation into self-styled Kuhnian paradigms at the end of the Cold
War (Lapid, 1989). While the rise of paradigms is a well-worn narrative,
the parallel institutionalization of incommensurability is often
ignored. As Wight (1996: 296--297) notes, the organization of the
discipline into differing paradigms is made possible only by holding the
view that different epistemological and ontological commitments form
irreconcilable differences. The consequence of this incommensurability
is the inability to communicate across paradigms, making dialogue
impossible (Wight, 1996: 297). Early post-Cold War texts like Hollis and
Smith's (1990: 57--61) Explaining and Understanding (see also Lapid,
1989: 248; Wight, 1996: 296--298, fn. 32) played a key role in
institutionalizing this idea.9

After the end of the Cold War, realism has been again on the defensive.1
Aﬁrst debate was triggered by a piece John Vasquez (1997) published in
the American Political Science Review. In this blunt attack, Vasquez
argued that [realists reject the systematic use of scientiﬁc criteria
for assessing theoretical knowledge. Vasquez charged (neo)realism either
for producing blatantly banal statements or for being
non-falsiﬁable]{.underline}, i.e. ideological. A second debate followed
an article by Jeffrey Legro and Andrew Moravcsik (1999) in International
Security[. Realists were asked to accept that their recent work was good
only because they have incorporated ideas and causal variables from
other approaches. Here, realism is not denied scientiﬁc status. But by
being allotted a small and usually insufﬁcient terrain on the academic
turf, realism becomes structurally dependent on a division of
theoretical labour deﬁned elsewhere.]{.underline} Whereas these debates
tended to focus on realism's recent developments, this article argues
that [they are but the latest manifestations of two intrinsic and
enduring dilemmas of realism in]{.underline} International Relations
([IR]{.underline}). I will call them the 'identity dilemma' and the
'conservative dilemma'. As I will expose in more detail, [realism's
identity or determinacy/distinctiveness dilemma results from the fact
that classical realists, when making more determinate empirical claims,
usually relied on explanatory elements which were not genuinely realist.
Much of the 'richness of the realist tradition' stems from these wider
sources.]{.underline} As this article will show, the reason is to be
found in [the indeterminacy of its central concept of
power]{.underline}, which [can]{.underline} simply [not bear the
theoretical weight assigned to it.]{.underline} As long as realism
needed no exact delimitation (its vocabulary being often confused with
the discipline of IR at large), this was of little theoretical
consequence. But in times of open theoretical debate, this necessary
eclecticism leads to a dilemma: [contemporary realism may be distinct
from other approaches at the price of being theoretically indeterminate.
It may also produce more determinate hypotheses which are then
indistinguishable from (or worse, subsumable by) some other approaches
in IR.]{.underline} In other words, while Legroand Moravcsik are right
in their critique, they stop short of drawing the full consequences.
They ultimately persist in the belief that realism, properly deﬁned, can
serve as an adequate explanatory theory. I claim that [realist
ambiguities are not accidents of recent realist research, but necessary
consequences of an enduring theoretical dilemma.]{.underline} Following
Kissinger's (1957: Ch. XI) analysis of Metternich, I propose to call the
second enduring dilemma of realism the 'conservative' or
justiﬁca-tion/tradition dilemma. [Faced with criticism of realism's
scientiﬁc character or its ﬁndings]{.underline}, I will argue that
[realists have been repeatedly tempted to lean towards less stringent
understandings of their own theory's status.]{.underline} Realism then
refers to a philosophical tradition or more generally to 'an attitude
regarding the human condition' (Gilpin, 1986: 304). Yet, [when realists
want to retreat to a more 'traditionalist' position, they are caught by
a dilemma which has existed since its beginnings in IR.]{.underline}
Despite Morgenthau's (1946)early insistence on the intuitions of
statesmen and the 'art' of politics, realism derived much of its appeal
from its claim to understand reality 'as it is' rather than as it should
be (Carr, 1946). But ever since the foreign policy maxims of realpolitik
have ceased to be commonly shared knowledge or understood as legitimate
politics[, realism cannot refer to the world as it is and rely on its
intuitive understanding by a responsible elite.]{.underline} Instead,
[it needs to justify the value of traditional practical knowledge and
diplomacy. To be persuasive, such a justiﬁcation comes today in the form
of controllable knowledge]{.underline}. Moreover, since realism
self-consciously refers to the world 'as itis, not as we would like it
to be' (Mearsheimer, 2001: 4), it necessarily requires a kind of
objective status. In other words, [by avoiding justiﬁcation, realism
loses its persuasiveness in times of a rational debate it decides not to
address. Alternatively, by consistently justifying a world-view that
should be natural and taken for granted, realist defences testify to
realism's very demise. Today, there is no way back to a time when
realism needed little justiﬁcation.]{.underline}

### AT: Securitization is in Human Nature/Inevitable

#### Securitization isn't inevitable or in human nature -- it's a social construct designed by politicians to shape the nature of the threat and only functions if the audience agrees

[**[Securitisation theory shows us that national security policy is not
a natural given, but carefully designated by politicians and
decision-makers]{.mark}**. According to securitisation theory,
**[political issues are constituted as extreme security issues]{.mark}**
to be dealt with urgently **[when they have been labelled as
'dangerous']{.mark}**, 'menacing', 'threatening', 'alarming' and so on
**[by a 'securitising actor' who has the social and institutional power
to move the issue 'beyond politics']{.mark}**. So, **[security issues
are not simply 'out there' but rather must be articulated as problems by
securitising actors]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Calling immigration a
'threat to national security', for instance, shifts immigration from a
low priority political concern to a high priority issue that requires
action, such as securing borders. [Securitisation theory challenges
traditional approaches to security in IR and asserts that **[issues are
not essentially threatening in themselves]{.mark}**; rather, **[it is by
referring to them as 'security' issues that they become security
problems]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The basics of securitisation theory The
end of the Cold War sparked a debate over ideas of security in IR
between 'narrowers' and 'wideners'. The narrowers were concerned with
the security of the state and often focused on analysing the military
and political stability between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Dissatisfied with this, wideners sought to include other types of threat
that were not military in nature and that affected people rather than
states. This expanded the security agenda by including concepts such as
human security and regional security -- together with ideas of culture
and identity. Feminism had an important role in widening the agenda by
challenging the idea that the sole provider of security was the state
and that gender was irrelevant in the production of security. On the
contrary, the state was often the cause of insecurities for women.
Widening the agenda from a feminist perspective brought gender into
focus by placing gender and women as the focus of security calculations
and by demonstrating that gender, war and security were intertwined. It
was an105 International Relations Theory important development in the
rise of a wider perspective on security. Whether one agrees with the
wideners or the narrowers, the end of the Cold War indicated that
security was an essentially contested concept -- 'a concept that
generates debates that cannot be resolved by reference to empirical
evidence because the concept contains a clear ideological or moral
element and defies precise, generally accepted definition' (Fierke 2015,
35). By pointing at the essentially contested nature of security,
critical approaches to security argue that 'security' is not necessarily
positive or universal, but context and subject dependent and even
negative at times. Because some administer security while others receive
security, security produces uneven power relations between people. For
example, in the context of the Global War on Terror, a person who looks
Arab has been regarded with suspicion as a dangerous 'other' and there
has been an increase in surveillance operations in Muslim communities on
the presum- ption that because they fit a certain profile, they may be
connected to terrorism. Viewed in this light, surveillance becomes a
security apparatus of control and a source of insecurity. It is by
questioning the essence of security in cases such as this that
securitisation theory developed and widened the scope of security to
include other referent objects beyond the state. A referent object, a
central idea in securitisation, is the thing that is threatened and
needs to be protected[. Securitisation theorists determined five
sectors: the economic, the societal, the military, the political and the
environmental sector. In each sector, a specific threat is articulated
as threatening a referent object.]{.underline} For example, in the
societal sector, the referent object is identity, while the referent
objects in the environmental sector are the ecosystem and endangered
species. It is only in the military sector that the referent object
remains the state. By 'sectorialising' security, we understand that
existential threats are not objective but instead relate to the
different characteristics of each referent object. This technique also
highlights the contextual nature of security and threats. Suicide bomb
attacks, for example, are a greater source of anxiety for some people
today than they are for others. Yet we often hear suicide terrorism
framed as a 'global' threat. Securitisation shows that it is incorrect
to talk about issues such as terrorism as if they concern everyone
around the world equally. By talking about referent objects we can ask:
Security for whom? Security from what? And security by whom? Central to
securitisation theory is showing the rhetorical structure of decision-
makers when framing an issue and attempting to convince an audience to
lift the issue above politics. This is what we call a speech act -- 'by
saying the words, something is done, like betting, giving a promise,
naming a ship'Securitisation Theory 106 (Buzan, Wæver and de Wilde 1998,
26). [**[Conceptualising securitisation as a speech act]{.mark} is
important as it [shows that words do not merely describe reality, but
constitute reality]{.mark}, which in turn triggers certain responses.
[In]{.mark} the process of [describing]{.mark} the [reality]{.mark} we
see, [we also interact with that world]{.mark} and perform an action
that will greatly contribute to seeing that reality in a different
way**.]{.underline} For example, referring to an immigration camp in
Calais as 'the Jungle' is not simply describing what the camp really is,
but portraying it as a lawless and dangerous place. Hence, [**[threats
are not just threats by nature, but are constructed as threats through
language.]{.mark}** In order to convince an audience to take
extraordinary measures, **[the securitising actor must draw
attention]{.mark}** and often exaggerate the urgency and level of the
threat, communicate a point of no return, i.e. 'if we do not tackle this
problem, everything else will be irrelevant', **[and offer a possible
way out]{.mark}** (lifting the issue above politics) -- which is often
framed in military terms. In so doing, **[the securitising actor]{.mark}
[makes some actions more intelligible than others and enables a regime
of truth about the nature of the threat]{.mark} and about the referent
object's nature. [An issue becomes securitised when an audience
collectively agrees on the nature of the threat]{.mark} and supports
taking extraordinary measures.** If the audience rejects the
securitising actor's speech act, it only represents a securitising move
and the securitisation has failed.]{.underline} In this respect, the
focus on the audience and on process requires considerably more than
simply 'saying security'. This has generated criticism from some
[**[scholars]{.mark},** who **[recommend understanding securitisation
as]{.mark} a long process of ongoing [social constructions and
negotiation]{.mark} between various audiences and
speakers.**]{.underline} Any security issue can be presented on a
spectrum ranging from non-politicised (the issue has not reached public
debate) to politicised (the issue has raised public concerns and is on
the agenda) to securitised (the issue has been framed as an existential
threat). [When an issue is securitised, actions are often legitimised
under the language of 'urgency' and 'existential threats' and are
measures that may be deemed undemocratic in normal
situations]{.underline}. Security measures in the War on Terror, such as
the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, the use of torture, the increased
surveillance of citizens, extraordinary renditions and secretive drone
strikes, illustrate the logic of exceptionality. Had the War on Terror
not been framed in a context in which a suspension of normal politics
was permissible and necessary, these security measures would probably
not have existed -- nor would they have endured to the present day. A
successful securitisation places 'security' as an exceptional realm,
investing securitising actors (nominally states) with the power to
decide when the democratic framework should be suspended and with the
power to manipulate populations. For Wæver (2015 and 2000),
securitisation theory was built to protect politics against the
disproportionate power of the state by107 International Relations Theory
placing the success and failure of securitisation in the hands of the
audience, rather than in the securitising actor. [**Wæver also voiced
his preference for 'desecuritisation' -- a return to normal politics.**
After all, audiences are not complete dupes at the mercy of the
securitising actor, and by making the process more transparent,
securitisation theory endows the audience with agency and
responsibility. In this context, the role of the security analyst moves
from objectively analysing the threat to studying the processes by which
securitising actors construct a shared understanding of what is
collectively recognised as a threat.]{.underline} Securitisation theory
is thus not so much involved with answering 'why' an issue has been
securitised. **[It is more important that we be concerned with the
conditions that have made the securitisation possible by [ask]{.mark}ing
'how' questions: [how has a specific language enabled the actor to
convince the audience of the threat?]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde argue in Security: A New Framework for
Analysis that [a state of [security]{.mark} threat [**does not exist as
an objective "fact"** easily recognized by all]{.mark} concerned.5
Instead, it [arises out of an intersubjective, **socially constructed**
security process]{.mark}. At the core of securitization theory is the
premise that the act of [calling something "security" makes it a
security issue]{.mark}. This is the security speech act (called the
securitizing move), in which the [securitizing actor claims]{.mark} a
particular actor or [issue poses an existential threat]{.mark} to
something of value (e.g., individual or collective physical beings, the
state, culture, identity). Security [is]{.mark} "thus a
[self-referential]{.mark} practice, because it is in this practice that
the issue becomes a security issue -- not necessarily because a real
existential threat exists but because the issue is presented as such a
threat."]{.underline}6 Because the claim of a security threat concerns
the continued survival of an object of value, the immediacy and
existential nature of the problem precludes handling through normal
political processes, which are often time-consuming and focused on
generating workable compromises rather than decisive action. Instead,
[to address the existential threat the security claim seeks to move the
issue into a Schmittian, authoritarian political framework in which
deliberation is suspended, power is centralized, and political rights
are deemphasized.]{.underline}7 The securitizing move is an effort to
break free of the rules that govern normal political behavior. Although
making an issue one of security may facilitate a response, the
authoritarian nature of security politics makes the state of security
corrosive to democratic societies and generally should be seen in a
negative light.

[Why are some issues seen as threats]{.underline}? Why do
decision-makers place a particular issue on the national security agenda
at a particular point in time? The component parts of this dissertation
are [linked by the common theme]{.underline} of explaining threat
construction and [exploring which factors influence national
decision-makers to frame an issue as a threat.]{.underline} The
theoretical ambition is twofold: first, the dissertation aims at
improving the research on threat construction by suggesting a broad
approach that analyzes this process in a structured manner. Second,
through this theoretical development of threat construction research,
the dissertation also contributes to the more [mainstream International
Relations (IR) security research agenda,]{.underline} which [often
under-problematizes this issue. **Threat construction is
dynamic**]{.underline}. An [issue that has been ignored]{.underline} or
only viewed as one of many on the political agenda can [suddenly receive
highest priority]{.underline}. The [opposite is just as
true]{.underline} -- issues that have been central to national security
decision-making can suddenly be downplayed. A [third possibility is that
an issue never receives attention.]{.underline} The empirical record
demonstrates all of these three possible sets of threat frames. An
example of the first type is the post-9/11 accentuation of terrorism,
even in places not directly affected by the attacks. That case also
illustrates how a [threat image can diffuse among actors]{.underline}.1
An [example of the second kind]{.underline}, i.e. the downgrading of an
issue that used to be in focus security- wise, is the change of
perception regarding the military power of Russia. Although predominant
in the Western political and societal discourse for several decades, for
most states the Russian threat image has now been surpassed by things
like terrorism, unemployment, environmental issues, and international
crime. That case indicates that [threat construction can alter over
time.]{.underline} Finally, one example of when a decision-making elite
has chosen not to view a possibly harmful condition as a threat to
national security is the South African leadership's perception of the
HIV/AIDS pandemic. That case illustrates the assumption that underpins
this dissertation: that although certain conditions -- be they
structural or contextual -- may constitute a threat, the [actual threat
construction]{.underline}, or threat framing process [is **subjective
and varies among actors**.]{.underline} The point of departure of this
dissertation, as illustrated by the preceding three sets of threat
framing, is that the [link between a condition]{.underline} (e.g.
structure) [and threat framing]{.underline} (e.g. agency) is not to be
taken for granted. This assertion is supported by the findings of the
dissertation's component parts---that is, a
[securitization,]{.underline} or threat framing, is **[not an automatic
response to a condition that could be perceived as
threatening]{.underline}**.2 Essay I finds that US security doctrines
such as the [Truman and Bush doctrines are not routine responses to
external threats but rather the natural continuation of a political and
societal discourse]{.underline} in which certain norms and identities
interact. Essay II finds that a condition that could lay the foundation
for a threat construction does not necessarily evoke such a reaction,
such as the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Russia. Essay III demonstrates the
opposite situation; that a [securitization can take place although the
contextual conditions do not necessarily point toward such a
move,]{.underline} such as US President Clinton's declaration that AIDS
is a threat to the national security of the United States. These three
empirical investigations thus all [indicate that the correlations
between conditions and threat constructions are intricate and far from
self evident.]{.underline} Instead, as developed in Essay IV, the
central questions to ask are how, why and when a securitization occurs.
The four articles demonstrate in different ways that the answer to this
question lies in the interaction of certain social and cognitive
processes. In order to examine these processes and to explain the
construction of threat images I argue that a broad conceptual and
analytical framework is needed. This dissertation thus proposes a
framework that incorporates different explanatory factors and includes
the international, the domestic, and the individual levels of analysis.3
Such a framework contributes to the research on security and threat
construction by allowing for a more refined analysis which better
captures the contingent relationships between factors.4 A methodological
contribution of this dissertation is that the various theoretically
driven concepts have been applied to empirical settings in a systematic
manner, employing a combination of a structured form of discourse
analysis and process tracing.

### Plan Focus Key

#### Plan focus [turns]{.underline} their offense. Links must be [predictive]{.underline} and [contextual]{.underline} to the plan, not a "prior question."

**Silva, 24**---Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy,
University of Regina (Caroline Cordeiro Viana, "Securitization theory
and its empirical application: a literature review," Revista de
Sociologia e Política, Vol. 32, 2024, dml)

The theory explains the process by which a theme to enter a country\'s
security agenda and has become a reference point in international
[security studies]{.underline}. However, strong critiques [suggest the
existence of **challenges** in the **empirical operationalization** of
the theory]{.underline}. Therefore, the first research question guiding
this work was focused on these problems, assuming that the theory had
flaws. Nevertheless, after collecting and analyzing 260 articles, in a
process that will be described below, the research question was
redefined to identify the problems academic papers face in
operationalizing the theory: Why do [academic]{.underline}
paper[s]{.underline} in the field of international relations
[**struggle** to **empirically apply**]{.underline} the [securitization
theory]{.underline} of the Copenhagen School?

As mentioned above, the initial research path was based on the
hypothesis that securitization theory was flawed. With this in mind, we
selected, from among 260 articles that mentioned the term securitization
in their titles, abstracts, and keywords, 184 studies that specifically
addressed the empirical application of the securitization theory in
international relations. It was expected that the systematic analysis of
these articles would provide evidence of the points where there were
flaws in the empirical application of the theory, issues that would be
subject to criticism. However, the analysis of the studies revealed that
it was impossible to systematize theoretical flaws.

Therefore, the research changed focus, but not to claim that the theory
is perfect. It may have flaws in its empirical application. We do not
intend to suggest to the authors are exempt from responsibility for
failing when applying the theory or that there is no need for
theoretical updates and adaptations. Instead, [this]{.underline} work
[argues for the necessity of a **preliminary debate** **before**
asserting that the theory is **flawed**]{.underline}.

When reflecting on these initial questions, it is essential to resume
the concept of theory. Using the seminal work by Thomas Khun (2017),
every theory has two essential characteristics. First, its achievements
were unprecedented, to the point of attracting a lasting group of
supporters. Second, its accomplishments are open to contribute to
practitioners in the field, allowing them to address a wide range of
problems. Securitization theory undoubtedly embodies these two essential
characteristics, which lead us to the following concerns.

How rigorous is the application of the securitization theory in
international relations articles? How precise were the authors in
addressing securitization theory? Also, how much attention have
international relations analysts paid to methodology in their scientific
work? Finally, how can one assert that securitization theory is flawed
if it has not been applied as described by the scholars who developed
it?

This article was structured around these questions. Unfortunately, [many
studies that aim to demonstrate the existence of securitization
processes encounter **difficulties** with **empirical
verification**]{.underline}. These [issues relate to]{.underline} two
main aspects. The first is [the lack of precision in]{.underline}
adopting the concept of securitization and [carrying out the analysis as
determined by]{.underline} securitization theory. The second is [the
need for]{.underline} methodological rigour in studies published in
scientific journals.

Securitization Theory primarily involves hypothetical and counterfactual
arguments about future alternatives. The statements always include two
**[predictions]{.underline}**: [what will happen if securitizing action
are **not taken**]{.underline}, [and what will happen if they
**are**]{.underline}. Research on securitization is qualitative in
nature, involving the analysis of three stages: nonpoliticized,
politicized and securitized. In addition, [its development
requires]{.underline} (i) [identifying the **securitizing agent** and
the discourse they use to socially construct the threat]{.underline};
(ii) [analyzing the **capacity** of this discourse to **convince** a
**specific audience** of the risks of the threat]{.underline};
[and]{.underline} (iii) [studying the emergency **policies** and
**actions** that states adopt to confront the threat]{.underline}. In
other words, empirical evidence of securitization involves an analytical
roadmap that demands, from the researcher\'s perspective, a focus on
securitizing discourses and their ability to convince an audience of the
need to adopt emergency measures.

#### Sweeping theories can't explain policy decisions---if they can, then our framework [link turns]{.underline} their offense.

**Rose, 21**---editor of Foreign Affairs (Gideon, "Foreign Policy for
Pragmatists," Foreign Affairs, March/April 2021, dml)

[[Theories]{.mark} of]{.underline} history, fundamental beliefs about
**[how the world works]{.underline}**, [[are]{.mark} usually
[**assumed** rather than **argued**]{.mark} and **[rarely]{.mark}** get
[subjected to]{.mark} **serious [scrutiny]{.mark}**. Yet these general
ideas **set the parameters** for]{.underline} all the **[specific policy
choices]{.underline}** an administration makes. Know an administration's
theory of history, and much of the rest is easy to fill in.

There are a lot of possible [theories]{.underline} of history, but they
[tend to fall]{.underline}, like Bush's and Trump's, [into two main
camps: **optimistic** and **pessimistic**]{.underline}. Thus, the
Clinton administration followed its own version of happy
directionality---think of it as Bush with less muscular Christianity.
And there have been earlier believers in Trump's dark and stormy night,
as well.

Unfortunately, [given the stakes of the question, **[no one]{.mark}
really [knows]{.mark}** [whether]{.mark} the [optimists or]{.mark} the
[pessimists have the better case]{.mark}]{.underline}. Political
[theorists have fought about that for **centuries**]{.underline}, with
neither side winning. A few generations ago, modern social scientists
joined in, [**generating** and **testing** lots of theories in lots of
ways, but still, **neither** camp bested the other]{.underline}. And
then, in the last few years, history got interesting again and erased
some of the few things the scholars thought they had learned.

As individuals, presidents have had strong views on these matters. As a
group, they have not. [[American]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign
[[policy]{.mark} is **notorious** for its **[internal
tensions]{.mark}**. Its fits and starts and reversals [**do not fit
easily** into any single theoretical framework]{.mark}. Yet this
pluralism has proved to be a **feature**, not a **bug**. Precisely
because [it **has not embraced any one approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}
to foreign policy [**[consistently]{.mark}**, Washington has managed to
**avoid the worst aspects** of all]{.underline}. Blessed with
geopolitical privilege, it has slowly stumbled forward, moving over the
centuries from peripheral obscurity to global hegemony. [Its genius has
been less **strategic insight** than an ability to **cut
losses**]{.underline}.

By now, [it seems fair to say that [the debate]{.mark} between the
optimists and the pessimists **[will never be settled]{.mark}
conclusively**, since each perspective knows something big]{.underline}
about international politics. [[Instead of **choosing**]{.mark} between
them]{.underline}, the new administration should [[keep **both**]{.mark}
truths in its pocket, [taking **each** out as
appropriate]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Learning in U.S. foreign policy has come largely across administrations.
President Joe Biden's goal should be to speed up the process, allowing
it to happen within an administration. Call it the Bayesian Doctrine:
rather than being wedded to its priors, the administration should
constantly update them.

[The way to do so is to [make theorists]{.mark}]{.underline}, not
principals, the administration's true team of rivals, forcing them to
[[make **real-world predictions**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[offer
**testable practical advice**]{.mark}, and then [seeing whose **turn
out**]{.mark} **to be [better]{.mark}** in real time]{.underline}. In
this approach, searching [[**intellectual honesty** is more important
than **ideology**; what people think **matters less** than whether they
can **change their minds**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Constantly calculating
implied odds won't always win pots. But it will help the administration
fold bad hands early, increasing its winnings over time.

[may contain **multiple**]{.mark} complete or incomplete
[frames]{.mark}]{.underline} (Steensland 2008). This means that [the
frame contest takes place [not only **between**]{.mark}]{.underline}
news [[items but]{.mark} also **[within a single]{.mark}**]{.underline}
news [[item]{.underline}]{.mark}. This, however, does not mean that one
frame cannot dominate the single news item, the particular media outlet,
or the media at large. It just means that [when analyzing]{.underline}

## Perms

### Perms:

#### Perm do the Aff with the lens of the Alt- Realism is compatible with securitization framing

**Van Rythoven '15** (Eric Van Rythoven, Department of Political
Science, Carleton University, "The perils of realist advocacy and the
promise of securitization theory: Revisiting the tragedy of the Iraq War
debate", European Journal of International Relations, 22(3), 487-511,

Critiques of realism all too often devolve into claims of its imminent
demise (e.g. Legro and Moravscik, 1999; Vasquez, 1997). Instead, I look
to steer to a different track with a brief sketch of a [shared research
agenda for both realism and securitization theory. One way to establish
a common coherence for such an agenda may be to frame it around the much
older and largely forgotten classical realist concept of
statecraft.]{.underline} In Chris Brown's (2012: 441) formulation:
\[classical\] [realist prudence involves both a deep knowledge of
statecraft, that is, of how to practise international relations, as well
as the possession of the intellectual ability to think through how
things might be different, and to weigh the consequences of
action.]{.underline}20 [Threat construction, including both practices of
securitization and desecuritization, can be thought of as a form of
statecraft whose emphasis on practical knowledge cuts across both
schools of thought. This form of explicitly political knowledge can be
explored in at least two concrete areas: the advocacy of restraint and
the politics of emotion in security debates.]{.underline} In the
aftermath of the 2003 Iraq War and the subsequent excesses of the Global
War on Terror, realist advocacy has gravitated towards a more active
promotion of restraint. Walt's (2006)Taming American Power makes the
case to a popular audience for the value of the US exercising restraint
on the global stage. Similarly, Posen (2013, 2014) [has argued for a
grand strategy of restraint against an increasingly expansive liberal
hegemony. Rosato and Schuessler's (2011: 813) realist foreign policy
manifesto explicitly 'counsels restraint' in dealing with minor powers
such as Iran. While less visible, a similar concern with restraint is
also evident in securitization theory.]{.underline} Increasingly, its
proponents are carving out a nuanced middle ground, where the [dangers
of intense patterns of threat construction mean that the practice of
'desecuritization is preferable in the abstract, but concrete situations
might call for securitization']{.underline} (Wæver, 2011: 469). Vibeke
Schou Tjalve goes even further by pointing to how visions of civil
society inspired by early 20th-century Atlantic republicanism could be
used to curb, but never altogether eliminate, securitizing moves. She
argues: Ultimately, human beings can only restrain each other. The
creation of a system of checks and balances, of playing interest against
interest, was the only viable means of restraining the monopoly of ideas
or the advance of uncontested demonizing, securitizing moves. (Tjalve,
2011: 446, emphasis in original) [Tjalve's work represents a stark
departure from the metaphor of the marketplace by focusing on an
agonistic and competitive public sphere. Yet, it shares with US realists
a distinct understanding of restraint as a virtue in security discourse.
How one advocates for the importance of this virtue to contemporary
forms of statecraft is possibly one of the most fruitful grounds for
dialogue between these two approaches today.]{.underline} Yet, restraint
in security debates is typically held to be elusive, especially when
such debates play to populist impulses such as fears over terrorism or
nuclear proliferation. As noted in the previous section, both realism
and securitization theory are beholden to a vision of fearful publics
acquiescing to security arguments. The problem with this logic is that
it artificially narrows the range of emotional dynamics at play.
[Reducing security debates to popular and elite fears ignores how such
debates circulate and are sustained by a variety of different emotions
and affects.]{.underline} Great power politics is frequently punctuated
by a diplomacy of anger, which may escalate into conflict in the absence
of conciliatory gestures (Hall, 2011). Honour and shame have powerful
catalyzing effects for security policy, as exemplified by the broadly
circulating feelings of shame in the US after 9/11 (Saurette, 2006).
Humanitarian operations, such as the Western intervention in Libya, may
be wellsprings of joy and jubilation for liberal internationalists, who
envision them as heroic efforts that avert near-genocides and produce
deeply grateful local populations (e.g. Kristof, 2011). Nor is the role
of emotions purely facilitative in making security arguments. [In some
cases, societies may come to fear the politics of fear itself as it
allows for the 'collective concentrations of power that make possible
"institutionalized cruelty"']{.underline} (Williams, 2011: 455). Thus,
the use of torture by the US may have left an enduring anxiety over how
public fears have been manipulated to support and sustain
institutionalized cruelty. [The broader point is that as long as these
emotional dynamics are part and parcel of security debates --- in ways
that both inhibit and expand the security agenda --- they should be of
special interest to both realist and securitization
studies.21]{.underline}

#### An understanding of security threats is consistent with realism -- they have to prove our truth claims wrong.

The approach adopted by the Copenhagen School accentuates the
[self-referentiality of securitisation]{.underline}. It is argued that
security emerges as speech acts: 'In this usage, security is not of
interest as a sign that refers to something more real; [the utterance
itself is the act. By saying it, something is done']{.underline} (Wæver,
1995, p. 55). This approach perceives the collective construction of
security knowledge as a direct outcome of a state's discursive
enunciations. The securitising actor 'does not refer to external,
objective reality but establishes a security situation by itself'
(Huysmans, 1998, p. 232). [It is an ultimate performative act, a social
enabler.]{.underline} Pointing out the contextual nature of security, it
is accentuated that securitisation in the political domain is not an
objective reﬂection of a problem (e.g. Williams, 2003), but a mobilising
tool in the hands of a state: '[something is a security problem when the
elites declare it to be so']{.underline} (Wæver, 1995, p. 54). More
importantly, it is a political practice that -- due to its
self-referentiality -- does not have to be grounded in facts (Buzanet
al., 1998, p. 24). Securitisation is interpreted as a phenomenon that
does not have to speak to external phenomena: 'security is not of
interest as a sign that refers to something more real; the utterance
itself is the act' (Wæver, 1995, p. 55). [The understanding of
securitisation as a self-referential practice supports a realist outlook
on state politics]{.underline} (Floyd, 2010). [Since security acts have
perlocutionary eﬀects, since they enable the political actors to achieve
their goals, this conceptualisation often leads to research positions
interpreting politics as a self-serving, amoral competition. In this
race, securitising actors are driven by the 'lust for
Power']{.underline} (Morgenthau,1962, p. 42). While the Copenhagen
School is one of many theories in the diversifying ﬁeld of
securitisation studies (Balzacq et al., 2016), its research perspective
echoes in multiple empirical investigations. Consequently,
[securitisation is often analysed through the prism of power and
politics of the strong. This moves the debate towards 'the logic of
political realism]{.underline}' (Aradau, 2004, p. 406). [Security is
treated as a method that is used ad hoc to solve political actors'
problems. It is 'a quality actors inject into issues' and 'stage them in
political arena']{.underline} (Buzan et al., 1998, p. 204).
[Securitisation research conventionally focuses on exposing how the
mighty use it to disenfranchise the weak]{.underline}. How Americans
after 9/11 securitised Islam (Shipoli,2018), how aﬄuent majorities
securitise poor, exploited minorities [and impose excessive surveillance
of 'problematic' communities]{.underline} (Kinnvall & Nesbitt-Larking,
2013). [Securitisation is associated with nationalism and bigotry and is
interpreted as a fertile ground for 'extreme history
politics']{.underline} (Jutila, 2015, p. 927). Drawing on the case of
the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Combes (2017) shows how media and
politics use the ﬁgure of a stranger as a method of securitisation.
Hellberg states that the EU elites' governmentality is based on the
securitisation of terrorists, migrants, criminals etc. (2011). The
[perception of securitisation as a pragmatic, calculative tool of
political enabling of the ruling power stems from the normative
character of the brunt of critical security studies. At times, the
literature advocates against securitisation associating it with
illiberal, undemocratic forces.]{.underline} It calls for the
desecuritization of societies, and as a panacea for securitisation ills,
suggests societal self-emancipation. Since it is a tool that often leads
to oppression, securitisation studies advocate for emancipatory politics
of desecuritisation (e.g. Aradau, 2004; Hellberg, 2011; Jutila, 2015;
Kinnvall & Nesbitt-Larking, 2013)

[Conflict resolution improves physical security, but it can also bring
about ontological insecurity]{.underline}. Desecuritization, or the
process of the unmaking of objects of fear, indeed fosters
peacebuilding. However, [desecuritization's unintended consequence may
be what Rumelili calls "peace anxiety," a state of unease stemming from
the ideational destabilization created by conflict
resolution]{.underline} (Rumelili 2015). The implosion of the Soviet
Union, for example, brought [an end to the Cold War but created a
"crisis of representation" in the USA, which embarked on a quest for a
new antagonist]{.underline} (Campbell 1998). [The 9/11 attacks and the
ensuing Global War on Terrorism provided a replacement for the Soviet
threat]{.underline} hence temporarily solving the representation crisis
and stabilizing the US sense of self in the post-Cold War era. An
often-studied case of "peace anxieties" is the peacebuilding process in
the Northern Ireland, where the 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought to an
end the longstanding armed conflict between Protestant unionists who
wanted to stay inside the UK and Catholic nationalists who aimed to
secede and join the Republic of Ireland. [Since then, the advent of a
more inclusive mode of politics has challenged the ontological
insecurity of those who anchored their identities in the previously
dominant friend-enemy ideology]{.underline}. However, it [also
destabilized those who endorsed the fragile civility as it continues to
be undermined by lurking animosities]{.underline} (Cash 2017; also Kay
2012; Mitchell 2015). [In the aftermath of wars, states seeking
recognition and a healthy sense of self are often unable to come to
terms with their past crimes or crimes committed against their
countries, which can undermine peacebuilding efforts. As a result, they
securitize specific collective memories, a process whereby "our" version
of history is seen as being under existential threat by "their"
interpretation of the past. This process of "mnemonical securitization"
leads to security dilemmas and eventual relapse into
conflict]{.underline} (Mälksoo 2015). Zarakol studied
ontological-security driven Turkey's denial of the Armenian genocide or
Japan's unease to acknowledge its atrocities in World War Two (Zarakol
2010, 2011). [States victimized during wars also tend to securitize
their war memories, which can hamper reconciliation and breed security
dilemmas, as is the case with the use of patriotic education about the
War of Resistance against Japan]{.underline} (Gustafsson 2014). The end
of the Cold War generated ontological insecurity for post-communist
states in Europe. All of a sudden, they were not only on the new path of
becoming Western but also overwhelmed with feelings of inferiority
vis-à-vis the West. To deal with this inferiority complex, they forged
new state narratives and redefined their formative C 216 Conflict,
Peace, and Ontological Security collective memories. Part of this
process across post-communist countries, as Subotić argues, was a
redefinition of the Holocaust remembrance in which fascist crimes became
communist ones practically overnight (Subotić 2018, 2019[). Furthermore,
international institutions involved in peacebuilding also engage in
ontological security-driven memory politics]{.underline}. As Lea David
has shown in Bosnia and Herzegovina's case, the international community,
embodied in institutions such as the [EU and the Office of the High
Representative (OHR]{.underline}), securitized its interpretation of the
war (1992--1995). This interpretation revolves around three
[essentialized categories of participants in the Bosnian War: victims,
perpetrators, and bystanders. The international community did this for
the sake of its own biographical continuity as a humanitarian
intervener. Its hegemonic memory politics, however, has only cemented
the grossly simplifying clear-cut division of all the parties into
either victims or perpetrators and deepened ethnic divisions in the
country]{.underline} (David 2019).

#### The neg's integration of Indigenous ontology into the political space of debate ends up reinforcing it as 'separate' and 'other' \-- claims at the root of Indigenous genocide.

A political ontology lens also changes how we understand politics, by
critically assessing the hegemonic modes of knowing that shape what is
tolerated and allowed on the \'political menu\' in policy debates or
mainstream media outlets. [Politics]{.underline}, in the modernist
sense, [preemptively eliminates certain socio/ontological concerns from
political discussions, often from Indigenous, farmers, environmentalists
and autonomists that view their habitats as living and
sacred]{.underline} (Blaser, 2013; Cruz et al., 2020; Kröger, 2022;
Hokkanen, 2024). However, [integrating alternative lifeways, knowledges
and hostile practices into dominant institutions, public policy and the
modernist grid of knowledge also presents concerns]{.underline} (see
Kothari, 2001; Dunlap, 2019a; Altmann, 2020; Wiegink, 2020; Tornel,
2023b, this Section). \"In effect, [analysts may be trying to empower
indigenous claims by bringing them into reasonable politics as culture
claims or expressions of a different epistemology]{.underline},\"
explains Blaser (2013, 21), \"[but by doing this they end up reinforcing
the modern ontological assumptions that are central to the very process
by which indigenous worlds are being destroyed]{.underline}\" (see also
De la Cadena & Blaser 2018; Benally, 2023; Artiga-Purcell, 2024). EDCs
were on the forefront of including social movements, or the
\"environmentalism\[s\] of the poor\" (Martínez-Alier, 2002), not only
as objects of study but also as knowledge producers who seek recognition
for alternative valuation systems (Temper, et al., 2015).
[Despite]{.underline} this [emphasis on socio/cultural values,
much]{.underline} EDC [research has insufficiently recognized the
political/ontological dimensions of destruction conflicts, being
implicitly inscribed in state-centered developmentalism and a related
materialist ontology]{.underline}. Mainstream environmental justice
scholars, however, are moving away from this position (Temper, 2019;
Menton et al., 2020), while critical and decolonial incarnations are
pushing decolonial and anti-colonial concerns front and center (Pellow,
2016; Álvarez & Coolsaet, 2020; Rodriguez, 2020; Tornel, 2023a; Dunlap,
2023a). As further elaborated below, green extractivism scholarship
emerges from, but also goes beyond the EDC framework, redressing its
limitations by centering the epistemological and ontological dimensions
of extractivism.

### Realism Good

#### Realism is key to accurately evaluate the effect of securitization -- reject their surface level claims in favor our AFF-specific analysis.

Delaram **Akhavein et. al. 25**, \[5/28/25, PhD Student at University of
Sydney, Master\'s in International Public Health. "How health
securitisation shapes health system priorities: A realist synthesis",
<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12118837/>\] //Sreekantan

[Different [contextual conditions]{.mark} -- locally, nationally, and
internationally -- can [shape]{.mark} how **[health]{.mark}
[securitisation]{.mark}** is triggered, operationalised and
institutionalised, [and its]{.mark} varying [outcomes]{.mark} across
countries and across different governance levels]{.underline}.
Therefore, it is important that health sector actors engage with and
understand how deploying the health security framing may impact health
systems differently in different environments. [In this article, we
aimed to contribute to the understanding of the impacts of health
securitisation within the complex and adaptive systems that are health
systems.]{.underline} Our aim was to develop a framework to explain how,
through various causal forces (i.e., mechanisms) that are influenced by
different circumstances (i.e., context), health securitisation generates
patterns of prioritisation in health systems. [A **[realist
synthesis]{.mark}** is particularly [suited for this]{.mark} type of
[analysis]{.mark} as it [allows]{.mark} us [to examine]{.mark} and
uncover how and why health securitisation, or health security practices,
produce di[fferent effects in different contexts]{.mark}. The realist
approach to evidence synthesis is well suited for [answer]{.mark}ing the
[questions]{.mark}: '[what]{.mark} works, for [whom]{.mark}, in what
context?']{.underline} \[39,40\]. [The application of this approach to
our synthesis helps to gain a more contingent understanding of how
health securitisation unravels on the ground, [given]{.mark} the
[complexity]{.mark} of health systems.]{.underline} Using this approach,
we explored how health security functions at different levels of
governance -- at international, national, and subnational levels. If the
underlying rationale for adopting the health security framing and
associated actions is primarily to mobilise resources and increase the
political importance of the events that triggered it, we aimed to
uncover or hypothesise causal links involved in why certain actors
choose to securitise the response to an event, how such framing leads to
action, and the effects of those actions. [The realist approach
[encourages syntheses]{.mark} of the evidence on complex social
realities [that go beyond simple]{.mark} or binary [effectiveness
assessments]{.mark} and [takes into account]{.mark} the
[interplay]{.mark} between structures and agents (systems and
individuals) -- how the [reasoning]{.mark} or rationale behind an action
(mechanisms) is influenced by social, political, and economic conditions
(context), and, in turn, together, influence the results or
[impacts]{.mark} of those actions (outcomes)]{.underline} \[39,41\]. In
this synthesis, we aimed to understand how securitisation manifests
within different context-mechanism interactions. We aimed to answer--
how and under what circumstances does securitisation impact health
system priorities?

Realism in International Relations can be considered as the discipline's
oldest theory, having its first advocate in Thucydides, who presented
the idea that power trumps justice and morality in The Peloponnesian
War. Among many others, Machiavelli and Hobbes, first, E.H. Carr and H.
Morgenthau, then, offered to their readers provocative and eternal
questions that still challenge our times (Boucher 1998, 47-170; Molloy
2006). In a way, [realism]{.underline} (also with its more contemporary
versions with Waltz and Mearsheimer) [can be considered as one of the
most enduring approaches in IR.]{.underline} One of the reasons for this
is that '[it sets itself up as a no-nonsense practical science of
international politics]{.underline}' (Sutch and Elias 2007, 42). [In
realism, all events in international politics make sense and can be
explained through]{.underline} relatively [clear and immediate
principles.]{.underline} For these reasons, [realism not only remains a
cornerstone of International Relations theory]{.underline} (Gold and
McGlinchey 2017, 46-49), [but also a thriving approach in the broad

### Gen Securitization Good

#### As long as our impact has sufficient magnitude, our securitization is valid and an inescapable part of politics.

This is [not]{.underline} to say that [all issue areas are rendered less
effective by securitization]{.underline}, but rather that some are
better politicized (desecuritized) than others. Accordingly, Rita Floyd
(2007, 2010) argues that a[ny judgment over the
positiveness/negativeness of employing either normal or extraordinary
politics is very]{.underline} much [issue-dependent]{.underline}. Thus
[utilizing a consequentialist ethics]{.underline}, Floyd posits that
security outcomes will inevitably serve the interests of some rather
than others. While cautioning that the interests of the majority must
not always be accepted uncritically, Floyd (2007: 337--40) is
nonetheless of the opinion that such [an outcome -- security for the
many rather than for the few -- is generally indicative of a positive
securitization]{.underline}. Aradau's (2004, 2008) work, however,
rejects Floyd's proposition. [Aradau views security's production of 'us'
and 'them' categories as something negative: whatever the categories,
there will always be winners and losers. This approach reflects a more
deontological ethics]{.underline}, inasmuch as judgment rests as much on
an understanding of what security is as on what security does. Aradau's
thinking in this respect derives from the assumption that the Copenhagen
School's extraordinary politics is again reflective of Schmitt's notion
of the political -- particularly its emphasis on the production of an
intense antagonism that constitutes and delineates bodies of friend and
enemy.8 Aradau's view as to the necessary production of 'us' and 'them'
is shared, for example, by Huysmans. In its identification of
existential threat and the nature of the referent thus brought into
question, Huysmans (1998: 571) notes how, in terms of Schmittian
political realism, 'securitisation turns into a technique of government
which retrieves the ordering force of fear of violent death by a
mythical replay of variations of the Hobbesian state of nature'. Read in
this way, 'fear of violent death' -- anxiety over the extinction of the
referent (and the human life it contains) -- constructs the political
community in a particular way: 'securitization makes the kind of
politics that defines the self on the basis of hostility' (Huysmans,
1998: 576). Andreas Behnke (2006: 650) similarly contends that without
the process of identifying and excluding Others, order in itself is made
impossible: 'Inclusion and community can only be had at the price of
exclusion and adversity.' While Williams (2003: 522) notes that, in much
the same way as Schmitt, members of the Copenhagen School 'view
[securitization]{.underline} as [a social possibility intrinsic to
political life'.]{.underline}

#### The reading of the 1AC is valuable -- it pulls security issues into the public realm instead of behind closed doors.

This is not to say that agreement is necessarily reached on an equal
basis, as actors often possess, and indeed employ, the resources to
cajole and bully audiences into acquiescing to their depiction of
events. But, it is to say that some kind of agreement is nevertheless
required. Indeed, the potential for securitization to avoid its
Schmittian connotations in this way is also recognized by Williams. For
Williams, the importance of the audience relates to a 'discursive
ethics' that goes against the decisionist account of securitization.
[The security speech act entails the possibility of dialogue and thereby
also the potential for the transformation of security]{.underline}
(Williams, 2003: 522--3). And although Williams (2003: 524) seems
somewhat sceptical as to the extent to which securitizations are subject
to such 'discursive legitimation' -- also noting how security issues
often 'operate in the realm of secrecy, of "national security", of
decision' -- he nonetheless makes clear the [potential for
securitizations to be 'pulled back' into the public realm, 'particularly
when the social consensus underlying the capacity for decision is
challenged, either by questioning the policies, or by disputing the
threat, or both'.]{.underline} More recently, Juha Vuori has also
questioned the degree to which the intersubjective establishment of
threat can always reflect an Arendtian conception of politics. For Vuori
(2008: 72), [some acts of securitization simply serve to make salient
the difference between friends and enemies]{.underline}. And [here the
securitizing audience is 'quite general and encompassing'.]{.underline}
In other acts, however, such as 'tense crisis situations', the process
might be restricted to 'inter-elite audiences', such as the executive or
the legislature. Moreover, Vuori notes how the identification of threats
can become institutionalized through the use of what he calls 'master
signifiers'. These, as Vuori (2010: 259) explains, 'decrease the need
for elaborate arguments about the "securityness" of specific cases'.
Certain words, such as 'terrorism', 'automatically bring the logic of
danger \... whereby the necessity to combat them does not have to be
argued every time'.11

#### Its valuable to securitize extraordinary threats. We shouldn't reject security, but debate within its framework.

Normative Debate over Normal versus Extraordinary Politics." Security
Dialogue, vol. 43, no. 3, June 2012, pp. 249--266,

Securitized issues indeed have the potential to disrupt the processes of
open and accountable government: through its very nature, fast-tracking
serves to limit the proper functioning of normal politics. But,
[extraordinary politics]{.underline} (in the form of the expedition of
legislation) [does not mean an abandonment of legislative
mechanisms:]{.underline} while the legislative process is surely
accelerated, a degree of [scrutiny and oversight nevertheless
remains]{.underline}. As a result, [in the context of liberal
democracies, securitization rarely resembles]{.underline} Schmittian
decisionism. Rather, the [commitment to maintaining openness and
deliberation in the relationship between the executive and the
legislature]{.underline} equates the concept far more with Wæver's own
preferred Arendtian politics. Indeed (Paris School contentions aside),25
as Olav Knudsen makes clear, [the speed and silence of securitization is
largely characteristic of the military]{.underline} sector, particularly
[during the Cold War]{.underline} period. However, [things 'just aren't
so any more.]{.underline} In the post-Cold War period, ag[enda-setting
has been much easier to influence than the securitization approach
assumes]{.underline}' (Knudsen, 2001: 359). Besides which, in certain
circumstances [there are also dangers involved in not expediting
legislation]{.underline}. In highlighting how [securitization can give
the necessary prominence to some problems]{.underline}, for example,
Booth (2007: 168) warns against the general recourse to desecuritization
(politicization): [Desecuritisation can disempower. Having issues
settled by 'ordinary' politics is a nice idea]{.underline}: who would
not prefer it to the threat of political violence? [But 'ordinary'
politics might not help in extraordinary circumstances]{.underline};
indeed, [treating extraordinary issues as ordinary politics is a
problem, not a solution]{.underline}. For some, however, to treat an
issue as extraordinary politics necessitates the production of
abjectivity and exclusion. Where security is concerned, there will
always be winners and there will always be losers. Accordingly, any
attempt to address the plight of the security 'have-nots' only
rearranges the delineations of secure and insecure: other Others are
produced and defined as threatening. The security situation is thus only
redefined and not solved (Behnke, 2006: 63). Consequently, as Columba
Peoples (2011: 1129) has recently reiterated, the fundamental question
is 'whether emancipation \[read "security as \..."\] can be at nobody's
expense'. For Aradau, it cannot; thus, the transcendence of us/them
delineations can only be realized outside of security. For Booth,
however, it can: the imagining of emancipatory communities predicated on
a plurality of identities makes possible the recognition of Other as
self. Either way, Wæver himself questions the utility of setting
'standards of judgement', such as outcome, against securitization.
Directing his comments largely at the Aberystwyth School, Wæver rejects
the consequentialist ethics he ascribes to Booth's approach. Commenting
that as a 'standard for measuring various concrete policies and
actions', security as emancipation 'reduces politics to outcomes', Wæver
contends that 'policies are always relational, their effects and
implications contingent on other actors \... and therefore not amenable
to such types of assessment'. In other words, [particular
securitizations cannot be positive or negative]{.underline} per se;
rather, [their quality 'depends on who else is involved, doing
what']{.underline} (Wæver, 2011: 467). Moreover, as a 'political
programme' that 'offers a vision of how to improve the human lot',
Boothian emancipation is logically prior to securitization; that is to
say, judgment over securitization, over how an issue is handled, can
only make sense in the specific context of such a programme. In other
words, although Wæver (2011: 469) also refers to the 'inevitable
negative effects of any securitization', for him, 'the logic of
necessity, the narrowing of choice, the empowerment of a smaller elite',
the value of securitizing or desecuritizing can only be determined in
relation to what 'state of being' is, a priori, desired. Accordingly,
making judgments about desired states of being warrants consideration
not only of the (positive) values according to which, for example,
inclusion is made possible, but also of those (negative) values
according to which exclusion might be justified. The recognition of the
value of human equality makes possible the celebration of some
differences and the condemnation of others. As Booth (2007: 140)
asserts: the fashionable injunction to celebrate difference should be
rejected. Why should we celebrate the 'difference' exhibited by cultures
dominated by racist ideas or religious bigots, or by extreme
nationalists, or by those with traditional practices that involve
cruelty towards their weakest members? \... By all means let us enjoy
differences between people(s) when they add to the richness of human
experience. ([Re)engagement with the normatively defined debate over
normal versus extraordinary politics should therefore strive not to
escape from security (securitization) but rather to 'break back in'
precisely to reclaim it as a site for such contestations over the
possibilities for inclusion/exclusion.]{.underline}

### AT: Climate Link

#### The 1AC impact frame is not baseless securitization, rather, it engages in the politics of the extraordinary in order to spur the urgency needed to combat the climate crisis.

To envision how climate emergency strategies may galvanize democratic
political-economic transformation rather than resulting in either failed
securitizations or authoritarian erosion of democracy, we can begin by
taking inspiration from Kalyvas's (Citation2008) concept of the
'politics of the extraordinary'. [As opposed to the relatively 'static
and frozen' periods of 'normal' institutionalized democratic politics,
the [politics of the extraordinary involves **high levels of collective
mobilization**]{.mark}**;** extensive popular [support for]{.mark} some
[fundamental changes]{.mark};]{.underline} the emergence of irregular
and informal public spaces; and the formation of extra-institutional and
antistatist movements that directly challenge the established balance of
forces, the prevailing politico-social status quo, the state legality,
and the dominant value system (6--7). In short, these are periods of
revolutionary rupture catalyzed by 'self-organized insurgent publics'
that institute the basis of a new kind of political-economic order (13).
If 'state of emergency' suspensions of ordinary legality represent one
form of extraordinary politics, then a different form emerges when the
latent 'constituent power' of a demos manifests itself to disrupt
prevailing systems of rule. The ultimate goal of such movements at such
times, as Kalyvas writes, is to mobilize and encompass broader strata of
the population, to form wider organic alliances, to articulate new norms
and rights, to formulate original collective aims that transcend the
confines of the existing regime, and to propose a new hegemonic founding
project (299). Michael Williams suggests that [by [rethinking
securitization]{.mark} theory [through]{.mark} the lens of
[extraordinary politics]{.mark}, it is possible to develop a more
positive understanding of securitization as '[a **process of openness
and self-determination with democratic potential**']{.mark} that may
[enable 'a more foundational]{.mark} -- if always fraught -- revaluation
of the [political order]{.mark} itself in ways that [can be **inclusive
and reformative**]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as violently
exclusionary' (Citation2015, p. 115). In other words, from this view,
there is no inevitability that emergency claims (if accepted) lead to
suppression of democracy and exclusionary injustice, though this is
always a danger. Instead, [[enunciations of security]{.mark} or
declarations of emergency from grassroots movements may be viewed as
expre[ssions of **latent constituent power** that]{.mark} also [have
**democratizing potential**]{.mark}**.** As Ben Anderson shows, both
[climate]{.mark} and racial [justice movements use emergency
declarations as]{.mark} 'a [pragmatic-contextual intervention]{.mark} in
the present that [aims]{.mark} precisely [to **disrupt what has already
become normal'**]{.mark}, or to [fold 'a sense emergency into]{.mark}
the mode of [operation]{.mark} of the very systems and infrastructures
that, for some, once produced a sense of stability']{.underline}
(Citation2017, p. 473, 472). In this way [they aim to [**generate
urgency** among]{.mark} otherwise [complacent publics]{.mark}, erode the
legitimacy of constituted political regimes, inspire hope that rapid
transformative action can stave off the emergency and create a better
future]{.underline}, and call forth 'self-organized insurgent publics'
capable of realizing this alternative future (Anderson, Citation2017,
pp. 469--470; Kalyvas, Citation2008, p. 13).

#### (Environmental) Securitization is good and necessary -- we center human security, which leads to direct benefits and cooperative measures. Reject their zero-sum thinking.

Focusing on the environmental sector of security, Floyd reasons that
[there are certain referents]{.underline}, however, [that can indeed be
privileged over others. In revising the securitization concept to enable
inquiry into actors' intention]{.underline}s, Floyd proposes what she
calls [a 'referent object benefiting securitization' and an 'agent
benefiting securitization'.]{.underline} The distinction between these
two securitizations, put simply, is that [while one corresponds to the
benefit of the wider, declared referent, the other benefits the narrower
concerns of the securitizing actor.]{.underline} Besides:
[Distinguishing between different types of securitization according to
the beneficiary is important b]{.underline}eyond allowing insights into
intentions of securitizing actors; [it suggests that not all
securitizations are morally equal]{.underline}. It holds open the
possibility that, [depending on who/what benefits from any given
securitization, it can be either morally right or morally
wrong]{.underline} (Floyd, 2010: 56). Additionally, though, moral
rightness is also dependent on the nature of the wider referent: for
Floyd (2011: 431), [referent objects must be 'conducive to human
well-being In this particular regard]{.underline}, Floyd (2007)
[distinguishes between state-centric and human-centric approaches to
environmental security and,]{.underline} subsequently (Floyd, 2010),
[between environmental security as 'national security']{.underline}
(state-centric), [as 'human security']{.underline} (human-centric), [and
as 'ecological security']{.underline}. Floyd rejects the
national-security approach on the ground that it reflects too narrow a
conception of human well-being (our citizens over yours), and the
ecological security approach for failing to privilege human life over
and above other animal and life species.20 '[Only environmental security
as human security', she concludes, 'directly benefits human beings' and,
importantly, 'seeks to address the root causes of environmental change
through (global) cooperative measures with the ultimate aim of
establishing a healthy and functioning environment for us
all']{.underline} (Floyd, 2010: 184).21 Although, as some critics have
pointed out,22 Floyd's work maintains that some securitizations may
reflect a Schmittian notion of the political, for Floyd herself [looking
at actors' intentions makes it possible to distinguish between, on the
one hand, those securitizations that maintain existing power structures
and relations]{.underline} (agent-benefiting) [and]{.underline}, on the
other, [those]{.underline} (referent object-benefiting) [that not only
enable the securing of wider interests but also envisage a more
transformatory process.]{.underline} Through a concentration on
environmental security as human security and a normative commitment to a
conception of human well-being,23 Floyd's work thus reveals the
[possibilities for a different (positive) mode of politics based on a
rejection of zero-sum thinking.]{.underline} As Floyd (2010: 4) herself
is keen to stress, [the outcome of securitization is not always
'conflict and the security dilemma'.]{.underline} In efforts to
transcend negative, friend/enemy identifications, certain ecological
issues -- such as global warming -- may thus be conducive for the
construction of non-divisive referents (humanity). And in this way Floyd
acknowledges that the environmental sector may be relatively
unproblematic in relation to the value of human well-being. But, 'what
else in other sectors', she asks, 'could be said to have the same
status?' (Floyd, 2010: 193).

Ferguson addressed [the increased attention that the People\'s Republic
of China has in the Arctic.]{.underline} She spoke at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies today. Paratroopers descend onto an
Alaskan drop zone. China is, by no means, an Arctic nation. But [Chinese
leaders see the region as a new crossroads of the world, a new source of
raw materials and new avenues for manifesting its growing power. China
is working closely with Russia in its attempt to be seen as an Arctic
power,]{.underline} Ferguson said. Even with Russia\'s unjust war on
Ukraine[, President Vladimir Putin is investing heavily on military and
economic strategies in the Arctic. \"We\'re seeing Russia continue to
have immense focus on the Arctic region, and it\'s part of their ...
security calculus, vis-a-vis the U.S. and NATO,\"]{.underline} Ferguson
said. \"[Despite the attrition in Ukraine, we still see them \...
heavily focused on the region.]{.underline}\" A shifting climate is
speeding the pace of change in the region. \"[Climate
change]{.underline} is still a factor in the region, where the region
warms at some four times the rate of the rest of the world,\" she said.
This [means more]{.underline} access for settlements in the high North
and more chances for what she calls \"[competitor
activity]{.underline}.\" \"\[[China\] is one of the newer entrants on
the scene]{.underline},\" Ferguson said. \"[Over time, the strategic
interests that they have in the region are ... giving us pause. How
their long-term vision for the region could affect our interests, is
\[also\] giving us pause.\"]{.underline} \[figure removed\] [Even more
disturbing is the increasing levels of collaboration between Russia and
China especially in the military domain]{.underline}, she said. Russia
and China exercised together in the Bering Strait in summer of 2023.
\"Just this past summer, [right after we released our department
\[Arctic\] strategy, we saw a joint bomber patrol off of the coast of
Alaska.\" There has also been increasing cooperation between the Chinese
and Russian coast guards in the region. \"This kind of increasing levels
of military cooperation is new,\"]{.underline} she said. \"Certainly,
it\'s new within and around Alaska.\" The new DOD Arctic strategy is
aimed at preserving the region as a place that is both stable and
secure, Ferguson said. She also discussed the Defense Department\'s
three main lines of effort in the region. The first is enhancing domain
awareness to see and detect threats, and to ensure U.S. forces can
operate in the region effectively. \"We\'re also really focused on
engaging with our allies and partners,\" she said. These nations are a
unique U.S. strategic advantage that stretches from the border of
European Russia to the Bering Strait. These are \"seven like-minded
partners that are incredibly militarily capable and also have heavy
geostrategic alignment with us,\" she said. \[Figure removed\] Finally,
the United States is working on using military exercises in the region.
\"We\'ve long had exercises that operate in the region, but we\'re
really looking at how we can use those as a deterrent effect, working
alongside our allies and partners,\" she said. There\'s an evolution in
how competitors think about the region, Ferguson said. \"We\'re going to
continue on the DOD side to monitor military activity.\" But this
attention cannot be just limited to that[. The Chinese are using other
aspects of their national power to insinuate themselves into the region.
China is involved in scientific and research projects in the region.
China is looking to establish economic ties within the Arctic. \"We
really just need to be clear-eyed about some of their intentions and,
how we can be like thinking about their long-term interests and, how we
can best protect ours,]{.underline}\" Ferguson said.

heavy metal mining and construction of smelters, with highly
controversial political, social, and national economic reforms (Bartels

hydrocarbons, metal mining, and nuclear powered infrastructure with the
aim of expanding regional and international shipping routes to both Asia
and Europe (Soroka, 2016). [The Russian Federation\'s gas reserves come
from the Yamal peninsula, the Indigenous Nenets\' homeland. Although
based on heavy extraction, the project is promoted as the cleanest in
the world,]{.underline} \'\'with 30% below the sector average in terms
of emission intensity given its high fuel efficiency\'\' (TotalEnergies,
2019). [Carriers along the Northern Sea Route]{.underline}, which run on
LNG, [are also promoted as \'\'the cleanest maritime
fuel\'\']{.underline} (ibid). [In the northwest part of
Russia]{.underline}, the Kola peninsula, [two green extractive projects
are inherently related to the modernization of the Monchegorsk nickel
and copper refinery]{.underline} (Venovcevs, 2021; EJAtlas, 2020a). For
decades, environmentalists have protested the air pollution from the
smelter on the peninsula, and the case even became a transnational
border pollution issue between Finland, Norway, and the Russian
Federation itself. Currently, development of Monchegorsk takes place
through \'\'sustainable\'\' mining and new technologies. The first green
project is the [Kolmozero field, mining lithium]{.underline} for
production of batteries in electric cars and the like (Pripachkin et
al., 2022; EJAtlas, 2022a). [Indigenous Peoples and supporters oppose
the project as it will further damage their homelands, already affected
by mining and heavy industrial processing in the region]{.underline}.
The second case is the Fyodorova Tundra platinum and [palladium mining
project on Sámi ancient burial places and reindeer pastures]{.underline}
(EJAtlas, 2022b). In addition to the mine, \'\'The 30 kilometers of dirt
road leading to the Fyodorova Tundra will need to be renovated, as well
as the 80 kilometers of high-voltage electrical lines\'\' (The Ministry
for the Development of the Russian Far East and Arctic, n.d.). The Sámi
defend lands, rivers, and cultural traditions related to the place.
Still, [the lands have been put under (green) Arctic development plans
by the government.]{.underline} Explaining the whole situation on the
Kola peninsula and elsewhere across Sapmí, [Sámi people explain how
development projects, green or otherwise, are oppressive, exploitative,
and intrinsically colonial.]{.underline} Similarly, [the palladium,
platinum, and nickel project of Russia]{.underline}n Platinum and
Norilsk Nickel [is taking place in Taymyr, Siberia]{.underline}
(EJAtlas, 2021a). In their efforts to raise concerns about the project,
activists travelled more than 4,000 kilometers to Switzerland to call
investors\' attention to long-lasting historical consequences related to
the state-owned Norilsk Nickel company on their lands. However, [much is
at stake for Russia because these two palladium/platinum
projects]{.underline} (Kola and Taymyr) [make the country perhaps the
biggest producer of these rare metals in the world]{.underline}. In an
open letter to the company Tesla, [Indigenous activists across the
Russian Arctic expressed their worries regarding new nickel mining on
their lands]{.underline}, asking the company to pay attention to the
historical environmental degradation of their territories (Voskoboynik &
Farrugia, 2022; EJAtlas, 2020b). The activists also called Tesla to stop
purchasing commodities from Russian Norilsk Nickel until the Russian
company accepts responsibility for socio-environmental damage, including
a [massive oil spill in the Arctic that took place in June
2020]{.underline}. The spill is related to permafrost thaw and eroding
infrastructure (Hjort et al., 2018, 2022). As a result of the
initiative, more than 70 Indigenous, climate, and mining justice
organizations around the world, have signed the letter urging Tesla to
reconsider colonial and extractive relations in the Arctic through these
and other proposed mines (Indigenous Russia, 2020; Picture 1 a).

#### Extractivism is inevitable under capitalism and can't be avoided -- prefer harm reduction in the aff.

[Extractivism is fundamentally entangled with capitalism]{.underline},
which is another reason why bounding it-- both spatially and
conceptually-- is challenging. As Jingzhong Ye and colleagues (2020)
argue, [one of the key features of extractivism is that it cannot be
reduced to simply taking from the non-human world]{.underline}. Rather,
[extractivism entails an organized and internally coherent feature of
capitalism]{.underline}---increasingly global in scope---[that enables
it to exert control over flows to maintain value
extraction]{.underline}. In a similar vein, Sando Mezzadra and Brett
Neilson (2019) and Martín Arboleda (2020) argue that [technologies of
financialization have blurred the boundaries between manufacturing and
extraction, rendering extractivism an increasingly central feature of
contemporary capitalism. The project of capital accumulation retains
little-to-no respect for boundaries,]{.underline} whether of economic
sectors or nation states. Limiting and [\"separating extractivism from
the dynamics of global capitalism,]{.underline}\" explains Facundo
Martín (2017, 26), \"[leads to serious theoretical and methodological
shortcomings.\" The conceptual bounding of extractivism that the
classical definition entails radically underestimating the pervasive,
networked nature of the extractive activities required for the
reproduction of technocapitalist societies.]{.underline} In fact, [any
single extractive operation---from a plantation to a mine---depends on a
vast existing array of extractive infrastructures and (digital and
non-digital) networks.]{.underline} This is why Dunlap (2021, 2023, 5)
asks: \"[How can industrial capitalist operations not be extractivism?\"
Roads to enter rural areas; lower-carbon infrastructures; schools to
train specialized labor; banks to facilitate monetary transactions;
factories that produce mining equipment; police/military barracks6 and
equipment to secure extraction sites all require extensive networks of
extractivism and associated forms of exploitation. Therefore,
extractivism can only be accurately grasped when exploring multiple
direct and indirect forms (as described below), and intersecting
extractivism(s) and their planetary ramifications.]{.underline}

[Improving security while avoiding the security dilemma]{.underline}
Search and rescue are an accepted function of states within their
territory and maritime zones as well as on adjacent high seas. It is
[recognized in international treaties dating back to the early twentieth
century, and most recently the 2011 Arctic SAR agreement]{.underline},
Article 3.3 of which states that ''\[[e\]ach Party shall promote the
establishment, operation and maintenance of an adequate and effective
search and rescue capability]{.underline}.''46 Investing in [SAR
capabilities supports cooperation and confidence-building, including
within the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, which was established with full
Russian participation after Russia's annexation of
Crimea]{.underline}.47 [Russia, China, and the NATO states have a long
history of SAR cooperation]{.underline} through the International
Cospas-Sarsat Programme, which picks up signals from handheld and
air-and-shipborne emergency beacons using a network of satellites that
provide worldwide coverage.48 The satellites are owned and operated by
Russia, the United States, Canada, France, the European Union, and the
European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites,
while China contributes by forwarding signals received at its satellite
ground stations. More than 200 countries and territories benefit from
the service, which is provided at no cost, either to the owners of the
beacons or to the governments receiving notice (including the precise
location) of any beacon activated on their territory or off their
coastline. Many [thousands of lives have been saved]{.underline} by
Cospas-Sarsat, while governments have saved many millions of dollars as
a result of the ''search'' being taken out of SAR.49 Satellite SAR
beacons are now promoted throughout the Canadian Arctic as critically
important safety equipment for hunters, pro spectors, scientists, and
adventurers. 45. Pompeo, ''Looking North.'' 46. Arctic Council,

510 International Journal 74(4) Most Arctic SAR equipment is well-suited
for constabulary duties directed at non-state actors. Long-range
maritime helicopters equipped with winches are ideal for interdicting
small boats and commercial ships. Canadian Coast Guard [ice breakers can
go anywhere that other vessels might venture]{.underline}, and can carry
armed Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Canadian Border Services
Agency, or f isheries officers as necessary. Canada's new fleet of
fixed-wing SAR aircraft, equipped to detect persons in distress, are
well-suited for surveillance. [Arctic SAR equipment, however, is not
easily mistaken for offensive weapons systems. Nor is its presence in
any way problematic, since the primary SAR mission is one that all
Arctic states are legally bound to fulfill]{.underline}. For all these
reasons, [invest ing in Arctic SAR is an excellent way to address the
readily foreseeable, non-state security threats in the region without
creating a security dilemma for Russia or China]{.underline}
