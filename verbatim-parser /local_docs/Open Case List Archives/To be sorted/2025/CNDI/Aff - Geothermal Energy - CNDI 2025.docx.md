**[Within]{.underline}** [Existential Risk Studies it is common to
hear]{.underline} people ask [the question "[is ﻿ climate change]{.mark}
an ﻿ [existential]{.mark} risk[?]{.mark}"]{.underline}, and
[many]{.underline} who ask this question [answer
**negatively**]{.underline}, [arguing]{.underline} that [as a result ﻿
climate change is not an important topic of research **within the
field**]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, whether it is [answered
affirmatively or not,]{.underline} [this question [is
**misguided**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are three reasons for thinking
this. [Firstly]{.underline}, [it makes little sense on a
**probabilistic** level]{.underline}; whether something will be [a
threat to]{.underline} our [collective existence is not]{.underline} a
[**binary** matter]{.underline}, [it is a question of
likelihood]{.underline}. However, **[many researchers]{.underline}**
[within Existential Risk Studies **mistakenly**]{.underline} [conflict ﻿
existential risk with **events**]{.underline} [that could be existential
﻿catastrophes]{.underline}. [Secondly]{.underline}, ﻿ [[climate change is
not a **single uniform process**]{.underline}]{.mark} that will affect
everyone in the same way; [[it is]{.mark} a set of **[diffuse
impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to different]{.underline} ﻿ exposed
[populations]{.underline}, [interacting with different ﻿ vulnerabilities
and ﻿ exposures]{.underline}, and [[activating different **risk ﻿
cascades**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Richards et al. show, [[it]{.mark}
will inevitably [interact with]{.mark} a **host** of [other
threats]{.mark} (not only ﻿ **[food security]{.mark}** and **[societal
collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} even [factors such
as]{.underline} the explosivity of ﻿ [[volcanic eruptions]{.mark}
or]{.underline} the [emergence of **[zoonotic
pathogens]{.mark}**),]{.underline}1 and [[these]{.mark} can
**interact**]{.underline} with one another [to [create
**reinforcing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [feedback loops or
**"[global]{.mark} systems [death spirals]{.mark}"**.]{.underline}2
Finally, "﻿ existential risk" is too vague and arbitrary a concept for
the question to ever be answered. All the definitions of ﻿ existential
risk that have received the greatest public attention thus far, such as
Toby ﻿ Ord's, focused not in terms of an impact on humanity at any point
in time but rather in terms of "the loss of long-term future value";3
either referring to the author(s) particular vision of a high-tech
intergalactic utopia, or a fuzzy undefined idea of "our potential".4

Other [[authors]{.mark} have practised]{.underline} attribution
**[substitution]{.underline}** [and sought to [answer]{.mark} an
**easier question**]{.underline} [such as ["will]{.mark} the **[direct
impacts]{.mark}** of ﻿ climate change [make]{.mark} the [**Earth
uninhabitable**?"]{.mark}]{.underline} [as a proxy for existential
risk]{.underline},5 [or suggested agricultural
**impossibility**]{.underline} [as a **proxy** for ﻿ civilisational
collapse at a given level of temperature rise]{.underline}.6 [[These
are]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly [more tractable
questions]{.underline}, but [they are also [**entirely different**
questions]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [there is a **danger**]{.underline}
[in thinking that answering them is **sufficient**]{.underline} [to
assess]{.underline} the [overall level of ﻿ **climate
risk.**]{.underline}

We are better off reverting back to the common-sense definition of ﻿
existential risk as the risk to the existence of a given object, and
specifying whether the object under threat is humanity as a whole (﻿
extinction risk), global industrial society (collapse risk), or
something else entirely. We should be thinking of an overall level of
risk emergent from a particular socio-ecological system, and how much ﻿
climate change influences this level.7 And the question we should be
asking about this risk is what contribution, under certain scenarios, ﻿
climate change will make, bearing in mind that it will almost certainly
be operating in tandem with many other drivers of risk.

Considering [this]{.underline} revised question can also [help to
**rectify**]{.underline} [a **recurring** problem in the ﻿ climate risk
literature: using mean global temperature rise as the **sole** threat
indicator]{.underline}. Authors and ﻿ activists alike have frequently
made a direct link between the level of warming and the likelihood of
global ﻿ catastrophe, with 4--6 °C being most frequently used as this
terrible threshold.8 However, [global surface
**temperature**]{.underline} [is **only one**]{.underline} [of the ﻿
climate]{.underline} change induced [factors we need to worry about. 3
°C of warming]{.underline} above pre-industrial levels [could
be]{.underline} entirely **[manageable]{.underline}** [if]{.underline}
it occurs [in a world of adaptive technologies]{.underline}, high levels
of [multilateral cooperation]{.underline}, [wealth
equality]{.underline}, [trust in institutions]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the [safe management of other ﻿ planetary
boundaries]{.underline}. [It could]{.underline} also [be
**catastrophic**]{.underline} [in a world where other ﻿ planetary
boundaries are **transgressed**]{.underline}, [the international order
is **riven with conflict**]{.underline}, lethal autonomous weapons are
in mass production, [and societies are scarred by
**inequality**]{.underline}, low trust, [and
**polarisation**]{.underline}. Understanding the contribution of ﻿
climate change to Global Catastrophic Risk requires a more sophisticated
approach which looks beyond the direct impacts of a given level of
warming to think through fully formed climate scenarios. We believe
that, when conceived of in this way, the risks associated with ﻿ climate
change are more appreciable and it is far harder to argue that
understanding them is unimportant; however, even if others disagree with
this assessment, we still maintain that this is the right way to think
about the problem.

2\. Catastrophic Neglect

Given how poorly questions about [[catastrophic]{.mark} ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} are often framed, it is hardly surprising that it
[has been a highly neglected subject of study]{.underline}, not only
among ﻿ existential risk researchers but also among ﻿ climate change
researchers. Even at the basic level of temperature rise scenarios, [we
give **far more attention**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} studying the
impacts of [lower- end [warming]{.mark} rather than high-end
warming]{.underline}. Text-mining of IPCC reports shows that mentions of
[3 °C and above [is **underrepresented**]{.mark}]{.underline} [relative
to]{.underline} its **[likelihood]{.underline}** ([and
impact]{.underline}),9 a finding that has been verified by both
literature sampling and the reports of popular authors trying to
summarise the climate risk science.10 If anything, [this trend appears
to have **worsened**]{.underline} [over time]{.underline} with
subsequent IPCC reports.111 The [use of **complex**]{.underline} [risk
assessments to study climate scenarios has]{.underline} also [been
**neglected**]{.underline}: [looking at compound hazards is]{.underline}
already **[rare]{.underline}**,12 [let alone considering risk ﻿
**cascades**]{.underline} and integrated climate ﻿ catastrophe
assessments. Yet catastrophic ﻿ climate change remains high on the public
and political agenda, creating both a perception that this is a risk
receiving far more attention than it is, and also an intellectual vacuum
that is easily filled by poor quality research, ranging from speculative
doom-mongering13 to overly simplistic neoclassical economic models.14

[There are four]{.underline} key [reasons for this
oversight]{.underline} of extreme global ﻿ climate risk. First is
international climate policy. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement on
Climate Change has channelled scientific attention toward the
agreement's goal of limiting warming to 2 °C above pre- industrial
levels and pursuing efforts to stabilise it below 1.5 °C, as these are
now the publicly stated goals of climate ﻿ negotiations (even if they are
highly unlikely to actually be realised). Second, [[analysis]{.mark} of
high-end warming]{.underline} scenarios [and complex risk assessments
[are]{.mark} simply **[harder]{.mark} to do**]{.underline}. [The higher
the warming gets]{.underline}, [the more difficult it becomes to
study]{.underline}, as these scenarios are more displaced for the
current climatic niche. Moreover, **[complex]{.underline}** ﻿ climate
[risk assessments involving multiple factors are]{.underline} far [more
**challenging**]{.underline} than a ﻿ hazard-centric analysis focusing on
only the direct impacts of mean global temperature rise. Third,
[[climate scholarship]{.mark} has had a **strong
incentive**]{.underline} [to "[err on the side of **least
drama**]{.mark}".]{.underline}15 [Climate change has
**long**]{.underline} [been the target of [fossil-fuel]{.mark} industry
[campaigns]{.mark} to **[sow doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [not just
on]{.underline} attempts to assess ﻿ climate change's [catastrophic
potential but even the **fundamental science**]{.underline}, and [this
[create]{.mark}s [incentives for **conservative
science**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that builds
**consensus**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and does not **risk** exploring
divergent hypotheses]{.underline}.16 Finally, [many
**fear**]{.underline} that [discussing extreme risk could]{.underline}
cause people to dwell too much on worst case scenarios,
[breed]{.underline}ing [fatalism]{.underline} and paralysis. However,
[this concern is misplaced]{.underline}; meta-analyses over hopeful vs.
fearful messaging are mixed,17 and in any case this is a false
dichotomy. One of the most referenced pieces for those concerned about
the paralytic effect of fear does show that hopeful messaging is more
poignant than fear but also that "worry" is even more effective than
hope.18 The difference between worry and fear is one of degrees; the
latter could even dissipate into the former over time. Furthermore,
research should not be a PR exercise aimed to sway the public, in open
democracies we have a duty to do honest risk assessments combined with
clear recommendations for what can be done.19

Of course, these factors are only compounded by the consensus procedures
of the IPCC, which seeks to synthesise scientific evidence for political
purposes but is still often held up as a neutral arbiter of climate
science. While useful, these procedures tend to produce lowest
common-denominator outcome, which is precisely what is not needed when
exploring extreme risks.20 This is an important point of reflection for
any future efforts to build similar bodies aimed at bringing scientific
research to bear on the governance of other global risks.

3\. The Risks and Rewards of Responding

Climate change is inherently tractable and we already have the
technologies we need to stop creating it, albeit without the
institutions to fairly distribute them with a sufficient level of
urgency. However, responding to risks like ﻿ climate change can incur
risks of its own. Indeed, the IPCC, in its risk concept notes to the
sixth assessment report, does not just discuss the usual three
determinants of risk, ﻿ hazard, ﻿ vulnerability, and exposure, but also
identifies "﻿ response risks".21 Others have suggested that response
should be added to the classic list of determinants.22 In some cases,
responses may be far worse than the initial perceived risk, that is,
they are iatrogenic: the treatment is worse than the disease.

Existential risk is especially prone to ﻿ response risks due to its
scale, severity, and often speculative ﻿ nature. For instance, at the
extreme a speculative fear of dispersed ﻿ weapons of mass destruction
could justify a mass surveillance state.23 In general, there is always
the potential for concerns over global risk to justify a Stomp Reflex
--- the abuse of emergency powers which inappropriately empower those
atop a hierarchy and shield them from scrutiny. 24 This is also true for
climate change

**[Reacting]{.underline}** [to ﻿ climate change could lead to
**[emergency responses]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[such as]{.mark} ﻿
stratospheric aerosol injection (﻿ [SAI]{.mark}),]{.underline} in an
attempt [to **manipulate**]{.underline} [the **quantity** of solar
radiation hitting the earth and]{.underline} thus [counter]{.underline}
some of the impacts of ﻿ [climate change]{.underline}. [Existing data
on]{.underline} the direct impacts of ﻿ [SAI and]{.underline} its
[[contribut]{.mark}ion [to ﻿ **systemic risk**]{.mark} or triggering
other ﻿ hazards is **sparse**]{.underline}. Preliminary analysis suggests
that [[the]{.mark} **greatest [problem]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} the ﻿ [latent risks of **"﻿ [termination
shock]{.mark}".**]{.underline} [[If]{.mark} a
[calamity]{.mark}]{.underline} such as a nuclear ﻿ war
[**[deactivates]{.underline}** [the system]{.underline}]{.mark} for a
prolonged time, then [[this]{.mark} could [**significantly accelerate**
warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence ﻿ [SAI shifts]{.underline} the ﻿ [risk
distribution by]{.underline} likely lowering the level of risk in an
average scenario but **[fattening the tail]{.underline}** [or
"worst-case" scenarios]{.underline} depending on how ﻿ SAI is deployed,
to what degree it is used, and what geopolitical and ecological world it
is dispersed into.25 On the other hand, there are also frequently
neglected ﻿ co-benefits of climate mitigation policies, such as the
public health benefits of eliminating coal smoke and other pollutants
from our air.26

[Such problems of ﻿ response risk are]{.underline} perhaps [the most
**neglected**]{.underline}. Yet [they are **precisely**]{.underline}
[what the study of ﻿ existential risk **needs to grapple
with.**]{.underline} This could include by using robust decision-making
procedures, such as the minimax principle, to aid in selecting policy
options under ﻿ uncertainty or using ﻿ deliberative democratic processes
to combine ﻿ diverse perspectives and co-create effective policy
responses.

#### [Domino effects]{.underline} create [catastrophic]{.underline} indirect impacts.

**[Cascading risks]{.underline}**

Researchers have been explaining that [[climate change
is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[catastrophic]{.underline}** for decades.
Recently, major political figures, including heads of state are
finally starting to acknowledge the magnitude of this threat. Just last
week, President Biden warned that the clock is ticking toward a climate
catastrophe --- a signal that maybe, just maybe, we may need to start
taking climate change seriously. But acknowledging that it's a big
problem is just the first step.

[How big of a problem is it?]{.underline} [Is it [an **existential
threat**]{.mark}? Could it]{.underline} literally **[wipe out
humanity?]{.underline}** Could it change our way of living
fundamentally, bring us back to the Dark Ages, or is it "just" as bad as
the COVID-19 pandemic?

**[At first glance]{.underline}**, [the idea that climate change could
be]{.underline} an [existential]{.underline} threat to humanity [seems
exaggerated]{.underline}. [After all, even in the direst scenarios,
climate change would "only" kill or relocate a few hundred million
people]{.underline}. Setting aside for a moment the sheer magnitude of
that catastrophe, it doesn't sound like something like that could wipe
out billions of people, [right?]{.underline}

[Well]{.underline}, **[society doesn't really work that
way]{.underline}**. Think of the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance. Let's
simplify things and say the virus would have killed 2% of humans on
Earth if left unchecked. We kept it in check somewhat with lockdowns and
restrictions, we've developed a vaccine in a year, and still, it has
caused a huge disruption in our society (a disruption that's still
unfolding). If it had actually killed 2% of the population, the results
would have been catastrophic and would have cascaded in ways that are
hard to predict. Herein lies the problem: [[problems aren't problems in
a **void**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[they create a **domino
effect**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[ripples]{.mark} throughout society.]{.underline}**

[If climate change makes some areas **unlivable**]{.underline} (which
it's already doing), [if it affects global food production and global
health]{.underline}, if it causes water scarcity for millions of people,
[this could [translate into]{.mark} **social
[unrest]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and]{.mark} who knows how many [other problems]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[We need to understand **how bad things can get**]{.underline}, the
authors of the new study urge.

"[There are **plenty of reasons** to believe [climate change could
be]{.mark}come **[catastrophic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[even at
**modest**]{.mark} **levels of [warming]{.mark}**]{.underline}," [said
lead author Dr. Luke Kemp from Cambridge's Centre for the Study of
Existential Risk]{.underline}. "[[Climate]{.mark} change [has played a
role in **every mass extinction**]{.mark} **event**]{.underline}. [It
has helped **fell empires** and shaped history.]{.underline} Even the
modern world seems adapted to a particular climate niche," he said.

"[[Paths]{.mark} to disaster [are **not limited** to]{.mark} the
**[direct impacts]{.mark}** of high temperatures, such as extreme
weather events.]{.underline} **[Knock-on effects]{.underline}** [such as
**[financial crises]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[new
[disease]{.mark} outbreaks]{.underline}** [[could trigger **other
calamities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} impede
recovery from [potential disasters such as **[nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

#### [Energy]{.underline} focus is critical -- The transition is [inevitable]{.underline} but too slow to avoid 2-degree warming. Rapidly decarbonizing [electricity production]{.underline} is critical

That's because [global [**demand** for electricity has
**grown**]{.mark}]{.underline} [even [**faster** than clean
**energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, leaving [[fossil
fuels]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[fill the gap]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The
dynamic]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[pushed up]{.underline}]{.mark} carbon
[[**emissions** from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}** sector at a time
[[when]{.underline}]{.mark} scientists say [[they need to]{.mark} be
**[fall]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} --- and [[fast]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- [[to **avoid** dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark} levels of global
**[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Much of the rising power demand has
come from rapidly-developing countries like China and India, where new
coal plants are still coming online alongside wind and solar farms to
power meteoric economic growth. But many industrialized nations are also
not moving away from fossil fuels fast enough to meet their stated
climate change goals. Even on today's trajectory, many experts expect
that [[**fossil-fueled** power will **peak**]{.mark} **globally** [in
the next]{.mark} **few [years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It's already
**falling** in]{.underline}]{.mark} major economies like [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
**Europe**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and analysts expect China, by far the
world's largest power producer, to begin reducing coal-fired generation
soon. [[The]{.mark} world's **[climate]{.mark}** future [will
**depend**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in large part, [[on what happens
**next**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Experts **broadly
agree**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[keeping]{.underline}]{.mark} global
[temperature [rise]{.mark}]{.underline} to ["[well below" **2
degrees**]{.mark}]{.underline} Celsius, the world's self-imposed climate
goal --- and ideally as low as 1.5 degrees --- [[will
**require**]{.underline}]{.mark} peaking and then [[rapidly
**reducing**]{.mark} [fossil-fueled **power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in
favor of **carbon-free** sources]{.underline}, like wind and solar. (The
world has already warmed about 1.2 degrees since preindustrial times.)
["[The **big question**]{.mark},"]{.underline} said Dave Jones, an
electricity analyst at Ember, a London-based think tank, [[is]{.mark}
whether countries can increase]{.underline} the pace of
[**[re]{.mark}**newable]{.underline} energy [[deployment]{.mark} so that
they're]{.underline} not just bringing down power sector emissions
slowly, but "actually [[enabling **deep**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
**[[rapid]{.underline}]{.mark}** carbon dioxide [[emissions
**cuts**]{.underline}]{.mark}." That question will take center stage at
a global climate summit later this month. The stakes are enormous. The
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}** sector [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
already [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} world's single [[**biggest** source
of]{.underline}]{.mark} planet-warming
**[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [[plans to
decarbonize]{.underline}]{.mark} many **[[other
parts]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the global economy --- like
transportation, buildings and industry --- also [**[rely on]{.mark}**
plugging in to **[cleaner power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. How
[**[electricity]{.mark}** generation]{.underline} has changed in recent
decades for the world's major power producers, both rich countries and
rapidly-developing ones, helps explain today's global picture and
[[**underscores** the]{.mark} climate
**[challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline} ahead.

Accessed 2/10/2025\]

According to the sixth assessment IPCC report, [[there is unequivocal
proof that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land,
contributing to climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [human
influence is from the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,
most prominently,]{.underline} carbon dioxide ([CO2]{.underline}). These
[[emissions are generated from all sectors of the economy]{.mark}, from
agriculture and aviation to cement production and steelmaking, via the
use of fossil fuels]{.underline}, namely coal, oil, and natural gas.
[[To have a 66% chance of achieving average global warming less than 1.5
ºC by 2100]{.mark}, an important goal laid out in the Paris Agreement,
[emissions need to be drastically]{.mark} reduced and legacy emissions
in the atmosphere must be removed]{.underline} (IPCC 2021). While some
culprit industries are much easier to decarbonize than others, [due to
recent advancements in technology, a common slogan among the climate
conscious is "electrify everything."]{.underline} The idea is that [one
path to achieving global climate goals is to use electricity to power
all]{.underline} applications and industries because carbon-free
electricity can be generated via renewable energy quite "easily." The
[intermittency of these resources is often addressed using some version
of "there is already existing technology that can be used to store this
electricity easily]{.underline}," i.e., batteries. However, few of these
conversations are discussing just how large battery infrastructure needs
to be to meet seasonal demand and how the raw materials for solar
panels, wind turbines, and batteries are sourced, let alone disposed of
at end-of-life. **[[Within these same conversations, the only renewable
energy resource that has the capacity to generate electricity 24/7, or
baseload power, is rarely mentioned: geothermal
energy]{.mark}]{.underline}** (U.S. DOE 2019). [Geothermal energy is the
energy that comes from the heat deep in the Earth's surface. There are
traditionally three types of geothermal power plants, which are designed
to maximize the energy production from a given resource]{.underline}
based on the formation, fluid temperature, and salinity of the
geothermal fluid (Shulman 1995). Hot geothermal fluid is accessed by
drilling wells (3-7 km deep) into the earth (U.S. DOE 2019), attaching a
pump to draw the hot geothermal fluid up to the surface. It is then used
to power via a thermo-power cycle, often a turbine, which generates
electricity (Shulman 1995). [Geothermal energy is responsible for
producing less than 1% of US electricity today, but with conventional
methods, has the potential to produce more than 8% by 2050]{.underline}
(Geothermal Technologies Office 2021). Other countries that rely on
geothermal energy include Iceland (799 MW), Kenya (\~790 MW), and
Indonesia (2.28 GW). [[Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are being
developed to expand access to geothermal energy in regions where deeper
wells are needed to access this resource, to bolster t]{.mark}he
[potential]{.mark}]{.underline} for low-carbon electricity generation.
[Although geothermal energy has many attractive qualities, namely, the
ability to produce baseload, low-carbon electricity, and its wide
expanse of access, it is still deeply rooted in the essence of
extraction. This positionality makes for a contentious
place]{.underline} in the portfolio of solutions to avoid the
detrimental impacts of climate change. Provided that the fossil fuel
industry is underpinned by extraction, [deep parallels between the two
industries can be drawn. However, there are still critical
distinctions]{.underline} that set geothermal energy apart and make it a
valuable addition to a comprehensive strategy for mitigating climate
change. These [deep parallels have the potential to serve a much wider
purpose that should not be ignored; they allow for expertise, skills,
and assets to be transferred from the fossil fuel industry to the
emergent and more climate conscious geothermal energy
industry]{.underline} (Smith 2023). [There is explicit expertise that is
transferrable between the two industries. Geothermal energy is based on
the extraction of geothermal brine and reinjection]{.underline} into an
underground reservoir where the brine is reheated. [Reservoir and
drilling engineers in the oil and gas industries have expertise within
the areas of reservoir dynamics and management, and deep well drilling
and management]{.underline}, respectively. As the demand for
carbon-intensive oil and gas declines and companies begin to constrict,
the [[geothermal energy industry may become home to some of the previous
oil and gas labor force due to the reduced need for
retraining]{.underline}]{.mark}. In addition to expertise and labor
force, the often-proprietary [geologic data collected by oil and gas
companies stands to benefit the geothermal energy industry]{.underline}
as well. Prior to drilling an operational well for oil or gas
extraction, [companies must have the subsurface characterized either via
contract services or in-house. Throughout this process, samples are
taken, analyzed, and geomechanical models are developed; leading to a
lot of data acquisition]{.underline} (Santos, Dahi Taleghani, and
Elsworth 2022). The results from these tests and models are then
analyzed to determine if the subsurface has the potential for
productivity (i.e., oil and gas extraction) and the economics that would
surround this project. Whether or not the project is pursued, the
company has acquired data via the drilling exploration process. The data
collected from this process is not uniquely useful for the oil and gas
industry. Before geothermal energy wells can be drilled, drilling
exploration must also be done to determine the existence of a geothermal
reservoir, formation temperature, and geothermal brine conditions and
composition (Santos, Dahi Taleghani, and Elsworth 2022). Furthermore,
[[there are projects that have begun to evaluate the potential to
repurpose abandoned or retired oil and gas wells]{.mark} for the use in
geothermal energy production. In 2021, the first abandoned oil well was
converted into a closed-loop geothermal system]{.underline} in Hungary
and went on to produce 0.5 MW of thermal energy (Santos, Dahi Taleghani,
and Elsworth 2022). Further demonstration projects are underway in the
U.S. and Slovenia (Santos, Dahi Taleghani, and Elsworth 2022). To
illustrate the vast opportunity for geothermal energy production using
existing abandoned or retired oil and gas wells, in the U.S. alone,
there are 3.7 million abandoned oil and gas wells as of 2020 and only
41% of those have been decommissioned or plugged, according to the U.S.
EPA (Smith 2023). [With the U.S. positioned to repurpose these wells and
institute low-carbon baseload power generation, we have the potential to
lessen the reliance on other renewable energy sources, like solar and
wind, protecting grid stability and bolstering energy
independence]{.underline}.

[**Geothermal** energy is]{.underline} [an]{.underline}other [important
type of **renewable energy source**]{.underline}, [which has attracted
the interest of many countries]{.underline}, especially in areas with
intense geothermal activity. Iceland, for example, has developed
advanced geothermal power generation and heating systems on the
periphery even though it is not exactly in the Arctic, demonstrating
that geothermal energy can be a central pillar of the energy transition.
[Some Arctic regions]{.underline}, [such as **Russia** and
**Canada**]{.underline}, [have already identified very important
**geothermal fields** in the **Arctic** and have already invested
heavily in this **tech**nology]{.underline}, [and are expected to
**invest more** in this technology]{.underline}. [The interest of
international actors demonstrates in any case that the **exploitation**
of **geothermal energy** in the Arctic can provide continued and
**reliable energy production**]{.underline}, [despite the adverse
climatic conditions]{.underline} prevailing in the region (Kolker et
al., 2022).

In conclusion [the exploitation of **geothermal** energy in the
**Arctic** has an extremely important **geopolitical
dimension**]{.underline}, [as Russia and other countries in the region
seek to expand their **influence** through]{.underline} partnerships and
[investments]{.underline} in renewable energy projects. [At the same
time]{.underline}, [the development of **geothermal projects** in the
region is **linked** to the **increase** in **energy security** and the
**strengthening** of the **diplomacy** of the Arctic
countries]{.underline}.

#### New government support supercharges geothermal innovation -- That's key to breaking fossil-fuel dependency.

[In the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, **[geothermal
energy]{.underline}**, which uses the Earth's heat to create
electricity, [supplies less than **half of 1 percent** of the country's
electricity]{.underline}, [but few other clean-energy sources offer as
much promise]{.underline} right now. Many climate activists support
geothermal energy as a renewable power source that generates zero-carbon
electricity. [A recent report]{.underline} from the Rhodium Group, an
energy-research firm, [projected that geothermal could meet as much as
**64 percent** of **new** electricity **demand**]{.underline} from data
centers [by the early 2030s]{.underline}. [America is far behind rivals
such as **China** and **Russia** in manufacturing solar panels or
building nuclear plants]{.underline}. [But **geothermal** makes use of
an area of the **U.S. industrial base** that has **grown** in recent
years]{.underline}---[oil and gas production]{.underline}.

Cindy Taff, whose company, Sage Geosystems, is anticipating geothermal's
potential growth, told me about a recent drive she took through southern
Texas that illustrated that overlap. "The same drilling rig that drilled
our well in September was on a lease right off the highway drilling an
oil-and-gas well," she said, laughing. "It's just the same."

Taff came from the oil industry: She was once a vice president at Royal
Dutch Shell who commanded a team of 350 employees using hydraulic
fracturing (better known as fracking) to drill their way through five
countries' bedrock. Fracking had driven an oil-and-gas boom starting in
the mid-2000s, and her team had looked at using the same technique to
tap the Earth's underground heat. At Shell, "we never actually drilled
wells" to try it on geothermal energy, she told me. "It was
frustrating." The opportunity looked big enough to her that she started
Sage.

Much like oil and gas, [**geothermal** energy]{.underline}, which
harnesses the planet's molten core to make steam, [had long been
**confined** to]{.underline} the places where access came easy---[the
American **West**]{.underline}, where Yellowstone's famous geysers hint
at the heat below, or volcanic Iceland. In those places---generally
volcanic hot spots where magma flows at shallow depths in the Earth's
crust and underground water reservoirs---geothermal energy can be a
substantial source of power. Currently, it provides roughly 10 percent
of Nevada's electricity generation and as much as 5 percent of the power
California produces; Iceland generates 30 percent of its electricity,
and Kenya nearly half, from geothermal. Traditional coal or nuclear
plants generate heat to turn water into steam, which spins turbines to
make electricity. Geothermal power stations do the same using hot water
from underground reservoirs.

[Sage uses **fracking** **tech**nology to crack open hot rocks even
deeper underground]{.underline}, [enabling access to heat in **more
locations**]{.underline}. The company's drillers then inject water into
the well, prying open the stone fissures and creating an artificial
reservoir. When Sage releases that water, the pressure from underground
shoots it upward, and the heat creates vapors that spin turbines and
crank out electricity. This system can also serve as storage for
weather-dependent wind and solar: Extra electricity from turbines and
panels can pump water into Sage's wells that can be released later to
produce electricity.

Sage expects to have its first energy-storage facility up and running in
Texas in the coming weeks, but already has a deal to sell power to
Meta's data centers. And a similar start-up, Fervo Energy, demonstrated
that it could use fracking technology to successfully produce 24/7
carbon-free energy back in 2023, at a pilot project in Nevada.

[Geothermal does have certain **advantages** compared with other sources
of renewable energy]{.underline}. [Solar and wind need **large areas**
of land]{.underline}, [huge volumes of **minerals**]{.underline}, [and a
massive new network of **transmission lines**]{.underline}. (Plus, China
dominates those industries' supply chains.) [Hydroelectric dams are less
dependable in a world where water is growing scarcer]{.underline} and
precipitation harder to forecast. [Nuclear reactors cost billions of
dollars and take years]{.underline} to build; the U.S. depends heavily
on countries such as Canada, Kazakhstan, and Russia for uranium fuel,
and has yet to establish the infrastructure to either permanently store
or recycle nuclear waste.

For now, most of the efforts to debut next-generation geothermal
technology are still in the American West, where drilling is relatively
cheap and easy because the rocks they're targeting are closer to the
surface. But if the industry can prove to investors that its power
plants work as described---which experts expect to happen by the end of
the decade---geothermal could expand quickly, just like oil-and-gas
fracking did.

[That the]{.underline} "enhanced" [**geothermal** industry piggybacks on
**tech**nology from the fossil-fuel industry also puts it in a position
to **grow**]{.underline}. "In the U.S., our manufacturing base is
falling apart. But we have a ridiculously good industrial base in oil
and gas," Charles Gertler, who until recently worked at the Energy
Department's Loan Programs Office and co-authored a report outlining a
pathway for the industry's growth, told me. "The fact that you can just
rely on many of the same tools and people and technologies and supply
chains is the reason a lot of folks are so excited." [Investors have
been cool on the industry since a handful of conventional geothermal
projects went under two decades ago]{.underline}. [But Gertler estimated
that]{.underline}, [if **five** to **10 new geothermal projects** prove
**successful**]{.underline}, [banks will **open** their **wallets**
again]{.underline}.

[Unlike other renewable-energy sources]{.underline}, [the emerging
geothermal sector has received **little direct support** from the
**federal government**]{.underline}. By the time Fervo had demonstrated
it could frack for geothermal energy, the Biden administration had
already passed two monumental climate-spending laws, which directed
billions of dollars toward technologies such as solar, wind, and nuclear
power, but just \$84 million for early-stage geothermal. Companies such
Fervo and Sage could still benefit, though, from tax credits for
producing zero-carbon electricity, if Republicans in Congress don't
repeal key parts of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.

"I don't know where that's going," Representative Celeste Maloy, the
Utah Republican in whose district Fervo is building its first
large-scale plant, told me. But she said [slashing the requirements for
obtaining **federal permits**]{.underline}---which her party is eager to
do---[could give the industry enough of a boost]{.underline} that "it
almost doesn't matter what happens to the IRA incentives." (No company
has made that case to her, she allowed.)

Like any energy industry, geothermal has external costs that could
become bigger issues as it grows. In 2017, an early experiment in
enhanced geothermal energy in South Korea triggered a serious
earthquake. (Earthquakes doubled in Texas in 2021 thanks to oil and gas
companies injecting sludgy wastewater into underground wells.) Locations
with particularly good hot-rock resources could end up overlapping with
threatened species, just as one of the nation's biggest lithium projects
ran up against an endangered wildflower or one of California's largest
solar farms put tortoises at risk. Environmentalists primed to see
anything with Big Oil's fingerprints on it as suspicious will find
plenty of connections between this industry and fossil-fuel companies.
And, as the industry scales up, it will use larger volumes of water.

Fervo, for one, has been pushing to use water too brackish for
agricultural or municipal purposes, Tim Latimer, Fervo's chief
executive, told me: "So we're not really fighting with people over water
even though we're in the western desert." Other companies, such as XGS
Energy, are boring more conventional wells and keeping water contained
in closed-loop pipes, eliminating the risk of losing any water at all in
the process.

[Electricity has to come from somewhere]{.underline}, though, and as
demand surges, the Trump administration is winning over support even
from some Democrats to keep coal plants open longer. Meanwhile, [gas
power plants are **expanding**]{.underline}. To keep the lights
on---while keeping utility bills and global temperatures down as much as
possible---[the country will need to employ all available resources of
**clean power**]{.underline}, an[d perhaps especially those the current
administration is willing to support]{.underline}.

climate targets.**

[[The US holds]{.mark} the [potential to **lead** the **world** as a
**clean energy superpower**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our *When America
Leads* project, released last year, illuminates the path forward. Our
breakthrough findings lay out how the US can not only seize global
leadership but also carve out a distinct advantage across ten pivotal
clean energy technologies, [[representing a **\$130 trillion**
market]{.underline}]{.mark}, [all [while helping the world **reduce 30
gigatons** of **CO2 annually**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

One year later, our work has proved prescient. Propelled by the trifecta
of legislation of the Inflation Reduction Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure
Law, and CHIPS & Science Act, America's clean technology investments
have nearly tripled since 2018. And we're just getting started.

Here are three reasons why when America leads in clean energy, we all
thrive. 

1\. Battle of the Superpowers: There's no question about it: [[China is
leading globally]{.underline}]{.mark} when it comes to renewable power.
Last year, the country spent a whopping \$99 billion in wind and
large-scale solar projects, firmly seizing control of key aspects of the
two technologies\' clean energy supply chains. In fact, China spent
\$546 billion total on clean energy last year, which also included
investments in electric vehicles and batteries.

[[But that]{.underline}]{.mark} can--and
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark}--**[[change]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Since
the Inflation Reduction Act, [[we have seen **\$213 billion**
in]{.underline}]{.mark} actual new **[[clean
investment]{.underline}]{.mark}** across the economy, representing a 37%
jump from the previous year and a remarkable 165% rise from five years
ago.

Our report shows that, [[with the right
investments]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the **US** is poised to
**excel**]{.underline}]{.mark} in various forms of clean energy segment
of the supply chain, [[**challenging China's**
control]{.underline}]{.mark} of this growing manufacturing sector. 

#### [Finally, every degree]{.underline} of mitigation matters. Trump puts stable pathways in [jeopardy]{.underline} but doesn't [guarantee]{.underline} irreversible climate change.

[With **Trump**]{.underline} once again [ascendant]{.underline} and
seemingly committed to dismantling the historic climate progress made by
the United States over the past four years[, one can be forgiven for
feeling **anguish** about]{.underline} the [opportunities]{.underline}
we've [lost]{.underline}, rage about the very real suffering that will
result from further delay, or deep despair about the darker days ahead.

[But only for a moment]{.underline}. Because [the fight to
**defend**]{.underline} that [**progress** begins
**today**]{.underline}, and [there is no time to lose]{.underline}.

In 1992, the nations of the world established the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change and pledged to \"prevent
dangerous human induced interference with the climate system.\" As the
parties to the UNFCCC gather once again in Azerbaijan this December, one
thing should be clear to all: We have failed in that task. [This year
is]{.underline} virtually [**certain** to be]{.underline} the
[**warmest** on record and]{.underline} the [first to breach **1.5
degrees**]{.underline} Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures.
[Wildfires]{.underline} and [droughts, hurricanes and
floods]{.underline} now seem to [strike with alarming frequency
and]{.underline} terrible [ferocity]{.underline}.

Yet [the [**best science** tells us]{.mark}]{.underline} that climate
change is not like an asteroid hurtling towards earth, an all-or-nothing
battle for survival. Rather, scientists tell us that [[every **billion
tons of CO2**]{.mark} and [every **10th of a degree**]{.mark} **of**
warming [we prevent will]{.mark} save lives, prevent suffering, and
[avoid **countless damage**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The fight cannot be surrendered, and the [[project of
building]{.underline}]{.mark} a world where the lives and aspirations of
8-going-on-10 billion people can be powered by clean, [[**abundant
energy** remains essential]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Indeed, I have been in this fight long enough to have experienced
[**several gutting defeats** before]{.underline} --- and to have
witnessed real, transformative progress.

When I began my career nearly [two decades ago]{.underline}, a good
onshore [wind]{.underline} project [cost]{.underline} \$100 to \$200 per
megawatt-hour, two to **[five times]{.underline}** the average [cost of
fossil power]{.underline}. Germany had just launched a subsidy program
paying a lavish €400 to €500 per megawatt-hour for solar photovoltaics.
And it would be several years still before the first Tesla Roadster
would even hit the streets.

Today, either solar or wind power is the cheapest way to generate new
electricity almost everywhere in the world, and the
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**nergy **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**gency
[[expects **solar**]{.underline}]{.mark} to overtake nuclear, wind,
hydro, gas, and, finally, coal, [[to become]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[largest source of electricity]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world [[by
**2033**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here in the U.S., clean electricity and
battery storage constitute virtually all of the more than 2.5 terawatts
of projects requesting interconnection to our grids. Likewise, electric
vehicles (whether two-, three-, or four-wheeled) are now the cheapest
and fastest growing mobility solution for those in emerging economies
and the rich world alike. One in five cars and trucks sold globally
are now electric --- in China, that figure is nearing 50%.

Annual U.S. emissions are more than a billion metric tons (or 16%) lower
than their peak in 2007, even as the economy is 40% larger. The
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**uropean [**[U]{.underline}**n]{.mark}ion
has [[cut emissions]{.mark} by **37%**]{.underline} from their peak, and
by 8% in 2023 alone. Even **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the world's
top polluter, may have [[seen]{.mark} its [emissions **peak**]{.mark}
**in 2023** --- seven years ahead of schedule]{.underline}.

In sum, the [[trajectory of global emissions]{.mark} has been
**[wrestled down]{.mark}**]{.underline} from inexorable rise to plateau
and impending peak. [That may **[not be enough to prevent]{.mark}
dangerous [climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but [it]{.underline}
is sufficient to transform the outlook from a bleak world of around 4
degrees of warming and [[put]{.underline}]{.mark} a much more manageable
[world of [**2 degrees** within reach]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The truth is that Donald [[**Trump** can only **slow**, not
**stop**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[clean energy
transition]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. is only responsible for about
a 10th of global emissions, and China, not America, is now the world's
largest market (by far) for cars and trucks, electricity, and industrial
commodities like steel and cement. [[Trump **cannot** wind
back]{.underline}]{.mark} the [clock on **tech**]{.underline}nological
[**[innovation]{.mark}** or dampen]{.underline} the [appetite for EVs
and clean energy]{.underline} in the rest of the world. Emerging climate
technologies like decarbonized steel, cement and industrial heat can
take root elsewhere, even if they face dimmer prospects in America. And
a [[bipartisan consensus to advance
**tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [like **geothermal**]{.underline},
nuclear, and carbon capture [in the U.S. [remains]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While executive actions can be easily repealed, the [legislative
achievements of]{.underline} the [past four
years]{.underline} lower energy prices for American consumers and
businesses, have [sparked]{.underline} a long-promised American
[manufacturing **renaissance**]{.underline}, and direct
substantial investment and job creation to Republican-represented
districts and states. Texas, that paragon of conservatism, is now the
undisputed king of clean energy. Factories producing batteries, EVs and
solar panels are sprouting across Georgia, the Carolinas, Kentucky,
Indiana, Michigan, and beyond. [**[Clean energy]{.mark}** is [now **big
business**]{.mark}, and [influential companies]{.mark} stand to [lose
**billions** if]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nflation
**[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**eduction **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ct [[is
repealed]{.mark}. With [Republicans]{.mark} securing
**[razor-thin]{.mark} legislative [majorities]{.mark}**, these [laws
could]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[prove surprisingly
**durable**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In times of struggle and defeat, those brave champions of civil rights
would remind themselves that, [though long, the **arc of history** bends
towards **justice**]{.underline}. Today, [[it remains]{.mark} our
[collective task to **continue to bend**]{.mark} the arc of global
[emissions towards **net zero**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Vice President Harris began her historic campaign by declaring, "When we
fight, we win!" That isn't always the case, but we can say with absolute
certainty that [if we give up the fight, we are guaranteed
defeat]{.underline}.

There is no "game over" in the fight against climate change. The next
battle begins today.

[[Geothermal energy offers the 24/7/365 **baseload electricity**]{.mark}
supplies that countries need for building out and operating competitive
industrial bases]{.underline}. Because it can continually run regardless
of weather or sunlight, every megawatt of geothermal power that comes
online can displace coal, gas, or oil-based dispatchable generation.
[Climate benefits follow.]{.underline} Furthermore, unlike hydropower
and many other thermal power plant types, [[**geothermal** is
substantially decoupled from drought risk]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is
also potentially capable of load-following to fill gaps in wind and
solar generation, a capability that Sage Geosystems has recently
demonstrated at megawatt-scale.

[[Geothermal generation's engagement]{.mark} of physical heat [also
opens possibilities for supporting food cultivation]{.mark} in
greenhouses [and distillation of seawater]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Where
warranted by remoteness (Aleutian Islands) or by strategic circumstances
(Taiwan), [geothermal power can also potentially support **green
hydrogen production and liquid fuel synthesis**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Geothermal power also brings security benefits. Policymakers are
recognizing in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine that during
industrial warfare, energy assets can and will be targeted.]{.underline}
Fossil fuel generation facilities on islands are the most vulnerable
because an adversary can trigger blackouts through interdicting seaborne
fuel imports and does not even need to strike on land to create
potentially strategic effects. This is true for vital U.S. territories,
including the Aleutian islands of Unalaska and Adak; Shemya Island;
Guam; and Hawaii.

\"Hydrogen fuel as an important element of the energy storage needs for
future smart cities.\" *International Journal of Hydrogen Energy* 48,
no. 78 (2023): 30247-30262. hpd\]

Is hydrogen being the best energy storage for smart cities?

The first inhabitants are anticipated to move into the net-zero-emission
megacity of the future, where smart cities have already begun to expand.
Even if wind and solar photovoltaic are the anticipated contributions,
**[[it is very unlikely]{.mark} that [smart cities would be]{.mark}
entirely [powered by renewable]{.mark} energy sources
\[105\].]{.underline}** Renewable energy sources such as **[[wind and
solar]{.underline}]{.mark}** photovoltaic **[energy [cannot be
sent]{.mark} where they are needed, [and there is no]{.mark} commercial
[way to store]{.mark} large amounts of energy for a long
time]{.underline}** to meet grid needs. Although the problem could have
been solved with dispatchable renewable energy, such as concentrated
solar power, which stores thermal power internally and allows
dispatchability \[\[106\], \[107\], \[108\]\], a grid that uses only
uses solar and wind energy needs external energy storage, which is not
available off-the-shelf.

Since inconsistent and unexpected power output from wind turbines and
photovoltaic arrays cannot meet grid demand alone in the absence of
energy storage, **[energy storage is unquestionably the biggest
challenge facing renewable energy today]{.underline}**. Unfortunately,
this problem receives no attention and nothing is being done to create
the tools required to address it. **[[Only a small]{.mark} [number
of]{.mark} the very few energy storage [tech]{.mark}nologies that have
been offered so far [are]{.mark} technologically [ready, and
none]{.mark} of them [are good enough to meet]{.mark} the [needs of
smart cities]{.mark} right now.]{.underline}**

The acceptable option like pumped hydro energy storage has a slower
reaction time and poorer round-trip energy storage efficiency than
batteries, ranging around 80% \[\[109\], \[110\], \[111\]\].
Additionally, it is difficult to execute without a river or lake. As
there has not been much research done on saltwater-pumped hydro energy
storage, and there are still numerous obstacles to be addressed in the
particular area, this would be a somewhat innovative idea. Other energy
storage options are possible in theory, but they are more like pleasant
concepts than functional off-the-shelf items due to their relatively low
degree of technological preparedness. Flywheels, stacked blocks,
batteries, and outdoor thermal storage are notable examples of these
non-traditional energy storage methods. Excess wind and solar
Photovoltaic energy are used to warm the molten salt, which is then
utilized in a power cycle using Rankine or supercritical CO2, for
example, in concentrated solar \[112\], despite the fact that it is not
yet a commercially accessible product and has a low round-trip
efficiency of less than 50%.

**[Energy storage in [hydrogen is]{.mark} the [best]{.mark} replacement
for battery energy storage or a superior addition to battery energy
storage]{.underline}**. In recent years, **[[battery]{.mark} energy
[storage has unfairly]{.mark} competed]{.underline}** with hydrogen
energy storage, **[which has [attracted]{.mark} far [more
financial]{.mark} and political [backing, pushing hydrogen]{.mark}
energy storage [into the background]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Nevertheless, despite the vast prospects for additional advancement,
**[[the technical]{.mark} [readiness]{.mark}]{.underline}** level of
individual technologies for hydrogen generation, storage, delivery,
**[[and usage is]{.mark} unquestionably [high]{.mark}]{.underline}**. We
reiterate that the energy **[storage industries for [batteries and
hydrogen are]{.mark} not competing in any way, but rather
[complementary]{.mark} and synergistic]{.underline}** technologies from
a net-zero viewpoint \[113,114\]. Therefore, the two most promising
technologies: battery energy storage and hydrogen energy storage should
be the foundation of energy storage of smart cities. Both of these
technologies are currently under development. Electrolyzers are
well-known goods; electrolyzers, which are readily available items, have
attained efficiencies of about 80% \[115\]. Aside from being stored and
later converted back into energy using more conventional combustion
systems or fuel cells, the hydrogen that smart cities ultimately create
may also be sold for applications such as transportation fuel or others.
While electrolyzers produce electricity using hydrogen as fuel, hydrogen
fuel cells produce electricity using hydrogen as the fuel. **[[Fuel cell
tech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark} likewise [well-established]{.mark}
\[116\]. The [efficiency]{.mark} of fuel cells has also increased,
[reaching 80%]{.mark}]{.underline}** for somewhat higher round-trip
efficiencies. **[Both fuel cells and electrolyzers have the [potential
to further increase]{.mark} their efficiency.]{.underline}**

**[Hydrogen may be used to generate energy in gas turbines, fuel cells,
and boilers]{.underline}**. The expelled gas is a water vapor after
burning in an oxygen-containing combination, with no harmful emissions.
**[Hydrogen gas is necessary to synthesize using CO2-\[carbon dioxide\]
capture techniques from energy sources or different
substances]{.underline}**, such as water, **[by converting carbon fuel
into a clean and carbonless fuel]{.underline}**. Both methods cost a lot
of money and waste a lot of energy, which is annoying.

Planning more hydrogen production for exportation may help the grid
balance by taking into account cross-, interannual, and multidecadal
variation, as well as maintenance needs or power plant breakdown. The
delivery of wind and solar photovoltaic energy to energy storage may
enable the generation of excess hydrogen that is not used to generate
electricity that is delivered back to the grid when needed, but rather
exported. Since the demand for hydrogen is clearly expanding, however,
this requires more solar PV, wind, and electrolyzer capability, which is
lucrative \[117,118\]. It is possible to see hydrogen energy storage as
more than just a way to stabilize the smart city grid of renewable
energy. Wind and solar power plants could have higher outputs, and
electrolyzers could be used to make hydrogen, which could then be sent
abroad.

Renewable energy is only likely to help in balancing. For the best
results, which include complete grid demand at the lowest levelized
price of electricity without carbon dioxide emissions, energy storage
can also contribute from external thermal energy storage, batteries,
and, in some cases, seawater pumped hydro energy storage. Hydrogen
energy storage should, however, predominate. Whereas the energy
conversion efficiency of hydrogen energy storage using electrolyzers and
fuel cells is undoubtedly lower than that of lithium-ion batteries,
**[we make the case that [hydrogen]{.mark} energy storage, which has
other advantages, [can be the answer to the]{.mark} [immediate]{.mark}
energy [storage problem for smart cities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
sooner the energy storage problem is accepted, the more likely it is
that the renewable energy-only grid of the smart city will move toward a
permanent solution rather than adopting temporary workarounds such as
the use of electricity generated from the combustion of hydrocarbon
fuels purchased along with carbon credits. **[Without energy storage, [a
system that uses exclusively renewable energy is not feasible]{.mark},
and without hydrogen, energy storage is also not
feasible]{.underline}**. If we want to use only renewable energy in the
future, we should pay more attention to how important hydrogen and
battery storage are \[119,120\]. It is important to note that hydrogen
can also be utilized to make hydrocarbon fuels such as methane, which
employ CO2 that is collected during their combustion as feedstock in
power plants that use more conventional combustion fuels but only have
carbon capture \[121,122\]. It has been acknowledged that hydrogen,
together with biofuels and electric vehicles, is one of the three main
low-carbon transportation options. Hydrogen is a valuable fuel that can
readily replace fossil fuels, petroleum, and natural gas. By using
hydrogen, the negative effects of biofuels on the environment, land use,
and the short range and long charging times of electric cars can be
lessened \[123\].

Germany planning to invest \$10.6 billion, to France, and Portugal
putting forward \$8 billion each, even countries on the African
Continent like Namibia, investing \$9.4 billion on green hydrogen
production commenting operations in 2026 with over 300,000 tons of
production. Also, the British government anticipates spending around
\$16.6 billion and Japan \$3 billion, and China invested \$16 billion to
make industries greener \[124\].

Hydrogen energy with integrated system for future smart cities

**[An integrated system for [hydrogen]{.mark} energy [in smart cities
could include]{.mark}]{.underline}** the following components.

- Hydrogen **[[production]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Renewable sources such
  as solar or wind power can be used to produce hydrogen through
  electrolysis. This process splits water into hydrogen and oxygen,
  producing a clean and sustainable source of fuel.

- Hydrogen [**[storage]{.underline}**:]{.mark} Hydrogen can be stored
  **[in tanks or pipelines for later use]{.underline}**. This allows for
  flexibility in the use of hydrogen energy, as it can be produced and
  stored during times of excess renewable energy production and used
  during times of peak energy demand.

- **[[Fuel cells]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Fuel cells use hydrogen and
  oxygen to produce electricity, with only water and heat as byproducts.
  Fuel cells can be used to power a range of applications, from
  buildings to transportation.

- **[Smart [grid integration]{.mark}]{.underline}**: A smart grid can be
  used **[to manage the flow of hydrogen energy and optimize its
  use]{.underline}**. This includes monitoring energy demand, managing
  energy storage and distribution, and ensuring energy security.

- **[[End-use applications]{.underline}]{.mark}**: Hydrogen energy can
  be used in a range of applications, **[[including heating]{.mark} and
  [cooling]{.mark} systems, [transport]{.mark}ation, [and power
  generation for]{.mark} buildings and other
  [infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

An integrated system for hydrogen energy in smart cities can help to
reduce carbon emissions and improve energy security. However,
**[[significant]{.mark} infrastructure [investments will be required to
develop and deploy]{.mark} this system [at scale.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**Sustainable cities prevent [extinction]{.underline}.**

**[By the mid-twenty-first century]{.underline}** the world's
**[[cities]{.underline}]{.mark}** will be home to approaching eight
billion inhabitants and will carpet an area of the planet's surface the
size of China. **[Several]{.underline}** megacities will have 20, 30,
and even 40 million people. The largest city on Earth will be
Guangzhou-Shenzen, which already has an estimated 120 million citizens
crowded into in its greater metropolitan area (Vidal 2010).

By the 2050s **[these]{.underline}** colossal conurbations **[will
absorb 4.5 trillion tonnes of fresh water]{.underline}** for domestic,
urban and industrial purposes, **[and [consume]{.mark}]{.underline}**
around **[[75 billion tonnes of]{.underline}]{.mark}** metals, materials
and **[[resources]{.mark} every year]{.underline}**.
**[Their]{.underline}** very **[[existence will depend
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[preservation of]{.mark} a precarious
[balance between]{.mark} the essential [resources]{.mark} they need for
survival and growth]{.underline}**---**[[and]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
**[[capacity of the Earth to supply them]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Furthermore, **[they will generate]{.underline}** equally **[phenomenal
volumes of waste, reaching an alpine 2.2 billion tonnes by
2025]{.underline}** (World Bank)---an average of six million tonnes a
day---and probably doubling again by the 2050s, in line with economic
demand for material goods and food. In the words of the Global Footprint
Network "**[The [global]{.mark} effort for [sustainability will be won,
or lost, in]{.mark} the world's [cities]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (Global
Footprint Network 2015).

As we have seen in the case of food (Chap. 7), **[these giant [cities
exist on a razor's edge, at risk of resource crises]{.mark} for which
none of them are fully-prepared]{.underline}**. **[[They are]{.mark}
potential [targets for w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass

[biotech]{.mark}nology,]{.underline}** nanoscience, chemistry **[and
[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence.]{.underline}**

**[Beyond]{.underline}** all **[this]{.underline}**, however,
**[[they]{.mark} are]{.underline}** also **[the places where human minds
are joining]{.underline}** at lightspeed **[to share
knowledge]{.underline}**, wisdom **[and [craft solutions to]{.mark} the
multiple [challenges]{.mark} we face.]{.underline}**

**[For good or ill, in cities is the future of civilisation
written]{.underline}**. They cradle both our hopes and fears.

Urban Perils

The Brazilian metropolis of **[Sao Paulo is a harbinger
of]{.underline}** the **[challenges]{.underline}** which lie ahead for
Homo urbanus, Urban Human. In a land which the New York Times once
dubbed "the Saudi Arabia of water" because its rivers and lakes held an
eighth of all the fresh water on the planet, Brazil's largest and
wealthiest city and its **[20 million inhabitants were almost brought to
their knees by a]{.underline}** one-in-a-hundred-year
**[drought]{.underline}** (Romero 2015). It wasn't simply a drought,
however, but rather a complex interplay of factors **[driven by human
overexploitation of the]{.underline}** surrounding
**[landscape]{.underline}**, **[pollution of the]{.underline}**
planetary **[atmosphere]{.underline}** and biosphere, corruption of
officialdom, mismanagement **[and governance failure]{.underline}**. In
other words, **[the sort of mess that potentially confronts most of the
world's megacities.]{.underline}**

In the case of Sao Paulo, climate change was implicated by scientists in
making a bad drought worse. This was compounded by overclearing in the
Amazon basin, which is thought to have reduced local hydrological
cycling so that less water was respired by forests and less rain then
fell locally. This reduced infiltration into the landscape and inflow to
river systems which land-clearing had engorged with sediment and
nutrients. Rivers running through the city were rendered undrinkable
from the industrial pollutants and waste dumped in them. The Sao Paulo
water network leaked badly, was subject to corruption, mismanagement and
pilfering bordering on pillage. Government plans to build more dams
arrived 20 years too late. "Only a deluge can save São Paulo," Vicente
Andreu, the chief of Brazil's National Water Agency (ANA) told The
Economist magazine (The Economist 2014). Depopulation, voluntary or
forced, loomed as a stark option, officials admitted. Although the
drought eased in 2016, water scarcity remained a shadow over the
region's future.

**[Sao Paulo is far from alone: many of the world's great cities face
the spectre of thirst]{.underline}**. The same El Nino event also struck
the great cities of California, leading urban planners---like others all
over the world---to turn to desalination of seawater, using electricity
and reverse osmosis filtration (Talbot 2014). This kneejerk response to
unanticipated water scarcity echoed the Australian experience where,
following the 'Millennium Drought' desalination plants were producing
460 gigalitres of water a year in four major cities (National Water
Commission 2008)---only to be mothballed a few years later when the dry
eased. By the early 2010s there were more than 17,000 desalination
plants in 150 countries worldwide, churning out more than 80 gigalitres
(21 billion US gallons) of water per day, according to the International
Desalination Association (Brown 2015). Most of these plants were powered
by fossil fuels which supply the immense amount of energy needed to push
saline water through a membrane filter and remove the salt. Ironically,
by releasing more carbon into the atmosphere, desalination exacerbates
global warming and so helps to increase the probability of fiercer and
more frequent droughts. It thus defeats its own purpose by reducing
natural water supplies. A similar irony applies to the city of Los
Angeles which attempted to protect its dwindling water storages from
evaporation by covering them with millions of plastic balls (Howard
2015)---thus using petrochemicals in an attempt to solve a problem
originally caused by ... petrochemicals.

These **[examples illustrate the]{.underline}** 'wicked' character of
the **[complex challenges now facing the world's
cities]{.underline}**---**[where [poor]{.mark}ly-conceived
'[solutions']{.mark}]{.underline}** may only **[[land
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** metropolis, and the
[**[planet,]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[deeper
[trouble]{.mark} that it was before]{.underline}**. **[[This is]{.mark}
a direct [consequence of]{.mark} the pressure of demands from our
swollen [population outrunning]{.mark} the [natural
capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[of the Earth]{.underline}** to supply
them, **[and short-sighted]{.underline}** or corrupt local **[politics
leading to 'bandaid' solutions that don't work or cause more trouble in
the long run.]{.underline}**

**[Other forms of increasing [urban vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[include: storm]{.mark} damage, [sea level rise, flooding and
fire]{.mark} resulting from climate change]{.underline}** or geotectonic
forces; governance failure, **[[civic unrest]{.mark} and civil
war]{.underline}** exemplified in Lebanon, Iraq and Syria over the
2010s; disruption of oil supplies and consequent **[failure of food
supplies]{.underline}**; **[[worsening urban health problems]{.mark} due
to the rapid spread of pandemic diseases]{.underline}** and industrial
pollution and still ill-defined but real threats posed by the rise of
machine intelligence and nanoscience (Gencer 2013). The issue was
highlighted early in the present millennium by UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, who wrote:

Communities will always face natural hazards, but **[today's disasters
are]{.underline}** often **[generated]{.underline}** by,
**[or]{.underline}** at least **[exacerbated by, human
activities]{.underline}**... **[At no time in]{.underline}** human
**[history have so many people lived in cities]{.underline}** clustered
around seismically active areas. Destitution and demographic pressure
have led more people than ever before to live in flood plains or in
areas prone to landslides. **[[Poor]{.mark} land-use planning;
[environmental management]{.mark}]{.underline}**; and a lack of
regulatory mechanisms both **[increase the risk and [exacerbate]{.mark}
the [effects of disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Annan 2003).

**[[These]{.underline}]{.mark}** factors **[[are a warning sign
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** the real possibility of megacity
**[[collapses]{.underline}]{.mark}** within **[coming]{.underline}**
decades. With the universal spread of smart phones, the consequences
will be vividly displayed in real time on news bulletins and social
media. Unlike historic calamities, the whole world will have a virtual
ringside seat as **[future urban nightmares]{.underline}** unfold.

### Adv 2 -- AI Innovation

**Advantage 2 is AI Innovation**

**AI innovation is driving [unprecedented]{.underline} demand for
electricity.**

**Rus and Enriquez 9/24** -- Director, MIT Computer Science and
Artificial Intelligence Laboratory; Technology-to-Market Scholar at the
Energy Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency and student at the
Stanford Graduate School of Business. Daniela Rus and Nico Enriquez, "To
compete with China on AI, we need a lot more power," The Washington
Post, 09-24-2024,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/09/24/ai-power-grid-china-competition/

[Sophisticated]{.underline}, [impactful use of artificial intelligence
is vital for **holding our own against China**]{.underline} and other
rivals in an increasingly competitive world.

[But AI uses **a lot of electricity**]{.underline}. [A simple ChatGPT-4
query uses **more than 10 times the wattage** of a Google
search]{.underline}. The difference arises from complexity: The GPT
model utilizes 1.76 trillion parameters to predict each word in a
sentence, while Google uses just 4 to 10 million to rank screenfuls of
webpages. **[[America's aging]{.mark} power [grid isn't]{.mark} going to
be [able to handle AI's]{.mark} increasing [load]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[Imagine]{.mark} each electron used to power a single
computation]{.underline} --- [for a GPS route]{.underline}, say, [or a
medical test]{.underline}, [or a cybersecurity system]{.underline} ---
[is [a car]{.mark} trying to get home]{.underline}. [Today]{.underline},
[that car must make its way [on]{.mark}]{.underline} a complicated
network of aluminum power lines that are the equivalent of [[back
roads]{.underline}]{.mark}, [many]{.underline} of them
**[crowded]{.underline}**, [[with **no interstate**
highways]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[That's]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark}
electricity [transmission]{.mark} system]{.underline}**: [more than a
**century old**]{.underline}, [patching together **3,200 local and
regional utilities**]{.underline}, [struggling to carry **even the
existing load**]{.underline}.

[Before we can use the **most advanced microchips** and run our
**state-of-the-art AI models**]{.underline}, [[we need
**interstate**]{.mark}**-type [corridors]{.mark}** [to transmit]{.mark}
sufficient]{.underline}, [reliable [power to]{.mark} our data
centers]{.underline}. [More than 150 [AI]{.mark} experts]{.underline}
that we have interviewed [in the last year affirmed]{.underline} that
[[our]{.mark} outdated electric [grid]{.mark} capacity [is **holding us
back**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[If]{.mark} America's computer [servers
**hit their limits**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [suddenly the GPS in your car
will take a while to load]{.underline}. [The robotics assisting your
gall bladder surgery will pause to compute]{.underline}. [Even
**[critical]{.mark} cybersecurity and [infra]{.mark}structure** systems
[could be affected]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[It takes]{.underline} the United States 10 to 20 [years to get approval
for]{.underline} and build [new transmission]{.underline} lines.
[Compare that to China]{.underline}'s autocratic centralized efficiency:
Beijing has largely consolidated its regional utilities into one
state-run organization, and it can build new power lines in under five
years. [China]{.underline} now has a power system with a speed and scale
that may be challenging for the United States to match; [from 2014 to
2021]{.underline} China [built 80 times the interregional grid capacity
that we did]{.underline}.

China is also the fastest builder of energy generation in the world. In
the 11 years it took us to add two reactors to the Vogtle nuclear plant
near Augusta, Ga., our only new reactors in three decades, China built
almost 40. Meanwhile, between 2022 and 2023 China added more solar
capacity than the rest of the world combined.

[Our new "hyperscale" [data]{.mark} [center]{.mark} campuse[s]{.mark}
consume massive amounts of electricity]{.underline}. [Amazon's
development outside Pittsburgh uses more electricity than **750,000
homes**]{.underline}. [Microsoft and OpenAI are planning a "Stargate"
campus that would use **more power than 3 million homes**]{.underline}.
[These sites]{.underline} often [[**need** to be]{.mark} in or [near
**population centers**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[where]{.mark} our [grid
is **already stretched to its limit**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

We must innovate to assure we can power such concentrated computation.
First, the fastest and greenest way to address the problem is to use
less power. So we must build more efficient AI software and better
computer chips.

This goal is within our reach: Our research at MIT has resulted in
smaller, physics-based AI models that use 1/1000th the energy of ChatGPT
--- yet yield more accurate results. This exponential improvement would
mean that calculations that now require supercomputers could run on our
laptops and phones. And our colleagues have built computer chips that
use a tenth the energy of the world's best AI chips while yielding the
same results. As such innovations are put into use, an AI calculation
could become no more energy-intensive than a Google query.

Second, [we must]{.underline} more quickly [upgrade our power
transmission system]{.underline}. This means encouraging utilities to be
more efficient. Several safe, proven and low-cost "grid enhancing
technologies" could save taxpayers billions if widely deployed. One
example is upgrading existing metal power conductors by using new
composite materials that can carry two or three times more electricity;
a recent study estimated they could triple grid capacity at 25 percent
of the cost. Furthermore, because they would be using existing
transmission towers, they could be deployed in one to five years. Many
countries in Europe and Asia already use these systems.

Regulators should encourage these more efficient investments by changing
laws so utilities can profit from them --- for example, by letting them
retain 30 cents of every dollar they save for their customers. Britain
has instituted this incentive system to much success.

Last, [[we must]{.mark} learn from China and **[create national
high-voltage transmission]{.mark}** corridors]{.underline}. To support
this, we should take some of the \$150 billion our tech companies devote
annually to U.S. data center construction and pool it with federal and
utility funding. This year, the Energy Department designated 10 National
Interest Electric Transmission Corridors with access to inexpensive
federal loans and faster permit processes because they would
significantly improve our grid's reliability and reduce consumer energy
costs. We should expand these corridors to cover our nation.

To accelerate state and local approvals for transmission lines, Congress
should pass legislation proposed this summer by Sens. Joe Manchin III
(I-W.Va.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) to speed environmental reviews,
limit local comment periods and properly compensate people who have
lines built in their backyards.

Much of the United States' economic growth during the 2000s has come
from our global leadership in tech. [AI is the next wave]{.underline}.
[The United States has the talent]{.underline}, [investor
base]{.underline}, [corporations and research institutions to write
**the most advanced AI** models]{.underline}. [But **without a powerful
data highway** system]{.underline}, [our great technology advances will
be **confined to back roads**]{.underline}.

**Electricity supply is the [crucial linchpin]{.underline} to US AI
dominance.**

At the Geothermal House DC MAGMA event in Washington, [Energy
Secretary]{.underline} Chris **[Wright]{.underline}** emphasised the
need to integrate advanced geothermal energy into the national energy
strategy to achieve the energy abundance goal set by President Trump. He
[stated that **geothermal energy** holds significant **potential** as a
power source]{.underline}, [provided that advanced **tech**nologies are
used to harness this natural resource]{.underline}.

Geothermal Energy and the Energy Needs of Artificial Intelligence

Chris [Wright also pointed out that the artificial
intelligence]{.underline} (**[AI]{.underline}**) [industry will lead to
a **significant increase** in **energy demand**]{.underline}. [He warned
that if this demand is not met]{.underline}, [energy-intensive
industries may be tempted to **relocate** their operations **out**side
of the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. [He stressed the importance
of keeping these industries **within** the country]{.underline}, [not
only for jobs]{.underline} and investments [but also for scientific
progress and **national security**]{.underline}.

Initiatives to Accelerate the Development of Geothermal Energy

The event, organised by Project InnerSpace in collaboration with the
CRES Forum, brought together representatives from the industry,
policymakers, the media, and energy consumers. The goal was to discuss
how advanced geothermal energy can enhance U.S. energy security,
stimulate economic growth, and create quality jobs in the energy sector.
Attendees had the opportunity to discover innovations in geothermal
energy, including virtual reality experiences and presentations from
specialised startups.

Topics covered included responding to the growing energy demand of data
centres and artificial intelligence, the strategic role of geothermal
energy in national security, policies to encourage geothermal
deployment, and how to leverage American innovation and the oil and gas
industry to scale up geothermal energy. Over 40 speakers participated in
the event, including Senator John Curtis from Utah and Representatives
Randy Weber and August Pfluger from Texas.

An Underutilised Geothermal Potential

[Currently]{.underline}, [the **U**nited **S**tates is only tapping into
a **fraction** of its **geothermal potential**]{.underline} [due
to]{.underline} high costs and [complex **permitting**
processes]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, [geothermal energy is an
**abundant** and renewable resource capable of providing baseload
electricity]{.underline} as well as industrial heat. [The oil and gas
sector]{.underline}, with its technology and workforce, cou[ld play a
key role in **rapidly developing** geothermal energy at
scale]{.underline}.

**[Introduction]{.underline}**

Two [tectonic trends in the international security environment appear to
be **on a collision course**. The first trend is the intensifying
geopolitical rivalry between the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
and the People's Republic of China (**[PRC]{.mark}** or
China).]{.underline} Since the mid-2010s, relations between Washington
and Beijing have descended into what U.S. President Joe Biden has called
"extreme" strategic competition that spans the diplomatic, economic,
military, and governance arenas.1 [Leaders from both countries have
further asserted that **[emerging tech]{.mark}**nologies [will play a
**decisive role** in the contest]{.mark} between the two superpowers
**[over]{.mark} the future of global power**, including by **shaping
[the military balance]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The second trend is the rapid development of artificial intelligence
(AI) technologies. Recent AI breakthroughs, such as ChatGPT, DALL•E, and
other generative AI models, have splashed across headlines worldwide and
racked up astronomical user numbers in record time.2 They illustrate how
emerging technologies might revolutionize entire sectors quickly once
they reach maturity. Major developments in AI have largely been confined
to the civilian sector so far. However, [[AI systems]{.mark} that [can
be used for a **range of military
app**]{.mark}**lication[s]{.mark}**---a broad category this report
refers to using the shorthand military AI---are likewise evolving
swiftly]{.underline}. The [combination of [these]{.mark} two trends has
the potential to increase what this report calls **strategic risks**.
That term is used here to refer to **[increase]{.mark}**d [risks of
**armed conflict** or]{.mark} the threat of **[nuclear war]{.mark}**
between Washington and Beijing]{.underline}.3

This report explores how the United States can manage strategic risks
that could be created or exacerbated by military AI in its relationship
with China. The report proceeds in four sections. The first section
details how China sees AI playing roles in both its civilian economy and
the modernization of its military, the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
It also explores how Beijing sees these emerging capabilities shaping
the future character of warfare.4 The second section details five
categories of what the authors call pathways, or causal links, through
which applications of military AI could undermine stability and increase
strategic risk between Washington and Beijing. The third section
assesses three categories of options for managing strategic risks along
those pathways. Finally, the fourth section offers recommendations for
how U.S. policymakers can reduce and mitigate the risks military AI
might pose to peace and stability in strategic competition with China.

Beijing's AI Plans and AI's Role in China's Military Modernization

Both public and private actors within [the PRC view artificial
intelligence as **crucial to China's future**.]{.underline} For the
party-state, AI's importance goes beyond any contribution to military or
political power, though those are of course important benefits. It
regards AI as key to enhancing economic growth and social welfare---in
short, as critical to the country's future in every respect.

[China's top leaders have repeatedly stated their commitment to making
the country into]{.underline}, as Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General
Secretary Xi Jinping put it in his work report to the 19th Party
Congress in October 2017, a ["**science and technology great
power**."]{.underline}5 At the 20thParty Congress in October 2022, Xi
stated that "innovation will remain at the heart of China's
modernization drive"; that by 2035, China would "join the ranks of the
world's most innovative countries, with great self-reliance and strength
in science and technology"; and that it should "resolutely win the
battle over key and core technologies."6 This commitment by Xi was
reaffirmed in an April meeting of the CCP Politburo in which he called
for the "development of general artificial intelligence," often referred
to in the West as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and defined as a
form of AI capable of broad problem-solving across different
environments.7 The definition of AGI is somewhat vague, though, and
often changes with new advancements in the technology

As the 2017 "New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan"
(AIDP) put it, "AI has become a new engine of economic development."8
Given that data is one of the key inputs to AI development, China's AI
goals were a key motivation to create a National Data Administration as
part of the overall reorganization of the State Council announced at the
2023 "Two Sessions" meetings.9 China's leaders believe worldleading AI
capabilities are necessary for their country to continue climbing the
global value chain and to move beyond its legacy development
model---which has delivered rapid gains in gross domestic product (GDP)
but produced geographic imbalances, environmental costs, and industrial
overcapacity---to "high-quality" and sustainable growth.

Chinese planners look to applications of AI in specific fields to
address myriad economic and social challenges.10 They expect AI and
related technologies like robotics to increase industrial productivity,
offsetting the shrinking of China's working-age population while also
better harnessing the increased human capital of younger generations who
are better educated than their predecessors. "Smart" agriculture,
cities, transit, and logistics will enable the continued urbanization
and transition to domestic consumption that underpin China's medium- and
longterm economic plans. Leaders in Beijing also view AI as the next
step in a long-standing drive to improve public service provision
through digitization of government functions. AI-enabled advances in
medicine promise to deliver better health care outcomes at reduced cost
and help alleviate the burdens of caring for an aging populace. More
efficient and dynamic planning and use of resources are key to
accomplishing all these objectives while meeting China's climate and
environmental protection targets.

[The CCP values AI]{.underline} not only for economics and welfare, but
also [for securing its domestic rule and **projecting its power
internationally**.]{.underline} At a basic level, sustaining [China's
decades-long buildup of military and internal security forces depends
upon resources that can only be delivered from **continued economic
growth**.]{.underline} Moreover, [AI is knit into the CCP's intricate
system of social control.]{.underline} While narratives of an AI-driven,
all-seeing "social credit system" describe Beijing's ambition more than
the current technological reality,11 the use of automated content
moderation is already a crucial part of China's vast system of internet
censorship.12 Facial and other biometrics recognition, computer vision,
and other AI technologies are key tools in the genocide against Uyghurs
in Xinjiang. Those techniques are increasingly employed to monitor and
control other minority groups and the broader population, too.13

Finally, while the CCP aims to direct and coordinate the development and
use of AI throughout Chinese society, the party recognizes that it
cannot do so alone. Private actors in business, academia, medicine, and
civil society will be the primary ones figuring out how to use these
tools to push the boundaries in their fields. For its part, the party
aims to create public goods by investing in both basic and applied AI
research, while yoking AI developments to its own goals.14 Mechanisms
for this approach include the creation of a "national team" of large
firms chosen to lead in specific fields, the use of industry alliances
between firms and various levels of government, and the decentralized
local experimentation that has long characterized Chinese economic
policymaking.15 In addition, China's system of Military-Civil
Fusion---although its scope remains ambiguous---seeks to appropriate
select private technological advancements, including some developed in
cooperation with international research partners, to augment the PLA's
capabilities.16

China's Unique Model for AI Development and Deployment

[The Chinese government's ability to **marshal and coordinate
resources** to push artificial intelligence development has led many
[commentators]{.mark} to [predict]{.mark} that **[it will]{.mark}
inevitably ["win the race" for AI]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}17 In
addition, [there is some evidence that Chinese society overall is more
receptive to these technologies: a 2022 Ipsos poll found that
**supermajorities** of Chinese respondents were highly aware of AI
progress and felt that it would **change their lives for the better**.
**Less than half of U.S. respondents felt similarly.**]{.underline} 18

However, a number of institutional factors may shape the extent to which
China can become the world's leader on AI. First, like others around the
globe, China's government has sought to articulate ethical limits
guiding the type of AI that is developed.19 In 2019, for example, the
Ministry of Science and Technology published "governance principles" for
"responsible AI," which urged that AI development should be prosocial,
fair, inclusive, privacy-respecting, safe, controllable, open, and
agile.20 The AIDP anticipates that such regulations will be expanded and
developed into laws throughout the plan's 2030 timeline.

Second, China has placed limits on industry's use of data, which is a
critical input for AI development. The government expects private
companies---especially those on its "national team"---to lead the way in
key areas of AI development. At the same time, responding to public
outcry over repeated breaches of privacy, China has issued several
binding regulations to limit those companies' ability to exploit private
customer data. The 2021 Personal Information Protection Law and Data
Security Law mandates that data handlers obtain consumers' informed
consent about data collection and use, create suitable procedures for
protecting data against unauthorized disclosure, and establish
nontrivial penalties for enterprises that violate these rules.21

As part of the overall reorganization of the State Council announced at
the 2023 "Two Sessions" meetings, China created a new National Data
Administration that will, among other things, both enable and constrain
industry's use of data for AI development.22 However, these laws
explicitly establish that no privacy restrictions will apply to state
security organs, which continue to conduct increasingly AI-enabled mass
surveillance on the population. In general, the Chinese approach has
been the inverse of the United States'. In America, there are legal and
institutional limits on what information the state can collect and
maintain on citizens but almost no constraints on private enterprises'
data collection and use outside of select industries such as finance or
health care.

Finally, the PRC government is moving to limit the ways in which
businesses and other actors can use AI algorithms within China. In March
2022, new regulations on internet services' algorithmic recommender
systems went into effect, administered by the Cyberspace Administration
of China (CAC).23 These regulations ostensibly seek to prevent
monopolistic behavior, such as anticompetitive walled gardens or
excessive price discrimination, and prevent the spread of fake
news---again, a contrast to the laissez-faire approach of the United
States. They also created an "algorithm registry" intended to give the
government greater visibility into and oversight of businesses'
AI-powered services and the data used to train them.24

In the wake of ChatGPT's explosion, China also aims to regulate
generative AI. CAC issued draft regulations in April 2023 intended to
control both the systems' training data and their output. Not only must
training data comply with the aforementioned privacy laws, but it also
must respect copyright and be "accurate." Moreover, the rules required
that outputs be "true and accurate"---a response to the danger that
inherently unpredictable AI systems may spit out content the CCP deems
politically subversive. Interim regulations released in July 2023
softened the rules, though, by exempting non-public-facing R&D
activities and jettisoning the fake content liability so that it
requires only "effective measures" to increase accuracy.25 It is unclear
how much the need for political control will undermine China's ability
to fully harness generative AI technology.2

It remains to be seen whether China's domineering regulatory stance
leads in practice to reduced societal risks from AI. Both individual
officials and the party at large have the incentives to downplay bad
news and the tools to do so.27 These information problems can mask
ongoing issues, allowing risks to build up out of sight. This dynamic
could impair implementation of China's AI regulations or hinder efforts
to update them as conditions evolve.

In sum, as it pursues diverse breakthroughs in AI, China will have to
continually manage tradeoffs between the openness that fosters
innovation, the need to regulate business excesses, and its own desire
to maintain tight political control over every part of Chinese society.
Given these trends, U.S. policymakers and experts will need to eschew
preconceived notions about China's strengths and weaknesses and
continually update their assessments as this dynamic field progresses.

**[AI and China's Military Modernization]{.underline}**

[China also sees AI playing a critical role in advancing its military
power. [Xi has set ambitious goals]{.mark} for the PLA [to]{.mark}
**"basically [complete" its modernization]{.mark}** []{.mark}by 2035 and
transform into a "world-class" military by the middle of the
century.]{.underline}28 In March 2023, [Xi called on the PLA to "raise
the **presence of combat forces in new domains and of new
qualities**.]{.underline}"29 As part of those goals, [Xi wants the PLA
to continue to move through stages of military-technological
development, from **mechanization** to **informatization** and
ultimately **intelligentization**. Broadly, mechanization refers to
**[fielding]{.mark} modern [platforms]{.mark}** and equipment;
informatization refers to **[linking those systems to networks such as
GPS]{.mark}**; [and]{.mark} intelligentization refers to **[integrating
artificial intelligence]{.mark}, quantum computing, big data, and other
emerging technologies into the joint force**.]{.underline} In 2020,
China set a new goal to "accelerate the integrated development of
mechanization, informatization, and intelligentization" by 2027.30 In
other words, Beijing aims to make progress on all three stages
simultaneously rather than sequentially.

[Beijing sees progressing through these stages as necessary to keep up
with changes in the technological character of warfare in the 21st
century. Chinese scholars speak about the **ongoing revolution** in
military affairs as one of weapons "systems confrontation" that requires
"**systems destruction warfare**" to win]{.underline}.31 [To compete in
this emerging era of conflict, the PLA is developing an overarching
concept it calls "multidomain precision warfare."]{.underline}32 In
layman's terms, this concept posits that the very networking that gives
the U.S. military its power creates interdependencies between its
forces, which are also vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Thus,
[[rather than needing to **destroy U.S.** ]{.mark}**enemy [forces
directly]{.mark}**---ship-to-ship or tank-to-tank---[China can
attack]{.mark} the [**weak points** that link U.S. systems]{.mark} and
domains [together]{.mark} and thereby neutralize or overwhelm U.S.
advantages[.]{.mark} Those weak points can include **internet**,
**satellite**, or electromagnetic communications links as well as
logistical **supply systems**. [AI is a **critical part of this
strategy** because]{.mark}, in the dynamic environment of an actual
conflict, [identifying]{.mark} and targeting U.S.
[vulnerabilities]{.mark} will [**require sensing**, **relaying**, and
**processing** vast amounts of info]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation [at a
speed only computers can match.]{.underline}

At the level of capabilities, the specific roles for military AI within
China's overall program of military modernization are still coming into
focus.33 Researchers at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology
analyzed 343 [PLA equipment contracts and found seven areas of interest
for current AI investments: (1) **intelligent and autonomous vehicles**;
(2) **intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance**; (3) **predictive
maintenance and logistics**; (4) **information and electronic warfare**;
(5) **simulation and training**; (6) **command and
control**]{.underline}; [and (7) **automated target
recognition**.]{.underline}34 Those categories are illustrative but not
necessarily exhaustive.35 Moreover, AI is a general-purpose technology
like electricity or railroads, so analysts cannot yet know all of its
potential uses or implications.36 In the near- and mid-term, most of the
changes AI will usher in will be incremental and narrow. But in the mid-
to longterm, some could be revolutionary and general. China provides
little transparency on its military modernization efforts, including for
AI, which could someday lead to strategic surprise for the United States
if Beijing manages to make breakthroughs in secret.

Neither articulating lofty goals nor simply throwing money and people at
the issue will ensure Beijing fulfills its ambitions to lead in military
AI. China could fall short of, or at least face delays in reaching, its
goals for integrating AI into the PLA due to several obstacles. Some
obstacles might be material. The PLA officially declared that it
achieved full mechanization in 2020, is making rapid progress on
informatization, and is pushing to develop cutting-edge capabilities
necessary for intelligentization. But as large numbers of once-new
ships, aircraft, and other weapons systems age, the cost to operate and
maintain them will rise quickly, potentially crowding out investments in
next-generation AI-enabled capabilities. Should China's domestic economy
face sustained headwinds, fewer resources might be available for
advancing AI within the PLA.

Furthermore, the technology itself might prove difficult to master even
with abundant resources. Technology controls imposed by the United
States and its allies could hamper Beijing's ability to develop and
operate AI-enabled systems at scale (see additional details below). In
addition, China could simply lack the capacity to innovate at the
bleeding edge of military technology. In earlier stages of its military
modernization, China could imitate the United States, Russia, and other
advanced militaries. By contrast, intelligentization requires pioneering
totally new military technologies and operational concepts for how to
use them.

Impediments related to personnel, bureaucratic structure, or political
control could further constrain the PLA's AI ambitions. These include a
lack of skilled personnel needed to operate AI systems and stovepiped
military bureaucracies. The PLA's Strategic Support Force (SSF)---a
stand-alone military service created in 2015 to focus on space, cyber,
and electromagnetic warfare---appears to control the lion's share of AI
development resources and authority within the PLA.37 While the SSF may
have been created in part to enable jointness through advanced
networking and now AI, it may be loath to relinquish control of its
creations to the rest of the PLA, or other services might resist relying
on capabilities run by the SSF.38 Finally, the CCP values control above
other aims. The dictum that "the party controls the gun"---first stated
by Mao Zedong and reaffirmed by Xi---and the prominent role of political
commissars in the PLA reflect that fact.39 Even for expert researchers,
today's state-of-the-art AI models present challenges for
predictability, "explainability," and transparency. This opacity could
make commanders reluctant to trust it for fear that they do not control
its actions.40 Alternatively, however, Chinese leaders might be more
willing to place trust in programmable machines over people. Given these
contradictory impulses, it is not yet clear to what extent China's
military leadership and operational-level commanders will embrace or
avoid AI.

Strategic Risk Pathways Military AI Could Create or Exacerbate in
U.S.-China Relations

China, along with the United States, is moving quickly to integrate AI
into its military. Many analysts have observed that this could feed
instability in the already-tense security competition between Washington
and Beijing.41 But exactly how emerging military AI capabilities could
increase strategic risks is not always clear. This section addresses
that gap by detailing five categories of pathways through which
applications of military AI could undermine stability and increase
strategic risk between the United States and China. Some of the military
AI applications envisioned below are already available, while others are
still emerging or only at the conceptual stage. Moreover, some strategic
risks derive from AI working as intended. Others derive from AI acting
in ways that are unintended.

Pathway 1: Individual Capability Improvements That Combine to Give China
a Military Edge

Perhaps [[the most likely source of]{.mark} U.S.-China strategic
**[risk]{.mark}**s stemming from military applications of AI [will
be]{.mark} one that is difficult to measure precisely and cannot be
solely attributable to AI: **[the overall military
balance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Many of the most practical uses for
military AI in the near term will be for purposes that are relatively
mundane but could help the PLA use resources more efficiently and
therefore generate more military capabilities per yuan or dollar
spent.42 These include helping to improve processes for maintenance,
logistics, training, and decision-support.43 Such "back office" tasks
rarely receive the sustained attention devoted to "tip of the spear"
capabilities that appear on the front lines of combat. However, the
strength of modern militaries depends as much on their enabling
bureaucracies as their frontline troops and weapons.

In addition, some emerging military AI systems will improve the PLA's
combat capabilities. Initially, those improvements are likely to be
evolutionary rather than revolutionary. Consider the air domain, to name
just one of many examples. "Loyal wingman"-type systems where unmanned
aircraft fly with manned aircraft could improve on what human pilots
could do on their own.44 But fully autonomous and uncrewed air
systems---capable of greater persistence, maneuverability, and other
attributes due to their lack of human bodily limitations---will likely
be necessary for a complete paradigm shift in air combat operations.

A similar story is playing out across nearly every aspect of military
affairs. If, when improvements in military AI across every area are
added together, the U.S.-China military balance turns in Beijing's
favor, then the risks of conflict could rise. China's assertiveness on
its periphery has grown in line with the PLA's rapid modernization
campaign since the 1990s, which has transformed the PLA into the world's
second-most-powerful military. In East Asia, U.S. military dominance, in
conjunction with a network of American security allies and multilateral
organizations, has underwritten a "long peace" free from major-power
conflict in Asia since at least 1979.45 China's military rise and
attendant coercive behavior threaten to undermine that peace, especially
if Beijing's combat capabilities in the region eclipse Washington's. As
the U.S. National Security Strategy states, China is "the only
competitor with both the intent to reshape the international order and,
increasingly, the economic, diplomatic, military, and technological
power to do it."46

Of course, [**[U.S.]{.mark}** and allied [actions will]{.mark} **[also
shape the]{.mark} regional military [balance]{.mark}**, which is dynamic
rather than static[. Washington and]{.mark} its [allies are **trying to
leverage AI** to bolster]{.mark} their military [capabilities]{.mark},
just as Beijing is.]{.underline} The unfortunate but inescapable reality
is that East Asia is seeing a military-technological arms race, of which
military AI is a part. And [[one way]{.mark} that [China could]{.mark}
eventually **[outgun the United States]{.mark}** and its allies [is to
develop]{.mark} and field technologies such as military [**AI**
that]{.mark} would [give Beijing a **substantial
advantage**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Pathway 2: AI's Effects on the Decision-Making and Information Domain

Military AI tools could increase strategic risks emanating from the
decision-making and information domain in three main ways: by
compressing the time policymakers have to make high-stakes decisions, by
generating bad inputs to decision-making processes, and by tempting
actors to try to undermine states' deliberations through large-scale
information operations. First, AI-augmented decision-making could on its
own speed up the pace of events and compress timelines for leaders to
act in uncertain situations. One speculative application for AI systems
is to supplement existing national security processes through which
evolving situations are monitored, options developed, and decisions made
about the threat or use of force.

For any one state on its own, accelerating information processing could
help buy additional time for humans to make more accurate and informed
decisions. The net effect, however, of multiple states compressing their
decision text, audio, images, or video at scale could empower greater
use of mis/disinformation operations. These could be used to undermine
an adversary's political unity, confuse their decision-making, create
rifts with their allies, or tilt the opinion of third-party actors
against them.51 Many Chinese strategists already see such propaganda as
a vital tool to undermine enemy cohesion and initiative. And PRC
party-state organs such as the Central Propaganda Department and the
United Front Work Department expend great effort on internet influence
campaigns designed to seed favorable narratives among key constituencies
abroad.52 For its part, the PLA emphasizes "cognitive domain
operations," which "take people's will, belief, thinking, and psychology
as direct combat targets, and seek to affect decision-making and actions
by changing the opponent's cognition."53

Doing so could manifest as using inflammatory message campaigns to
exploit political divisions over U.S.-China relations or national
security writ large, or perhaps as generating fake news reports to cast
doubt on an administration's case for acting in a crisis. Research
suggests that Beijing has already begun using AI to enhance its practice
of information operations surrounding Taiwan's elections.54 The use of
large language models (LLMs) like the now-ubiquitous ChatGPT could lower
the cost and may increase the persuasiveness of such activities. Indeed,
in the wake of generative AI's popularization, many PLA strategists
worry that the United States' lead in the category could enable it to
conduct damaging information campaigns against China.55 However, the
effects of a given campaign will likely be unpredictable, as the impact
of even flawlessly generated text still depends upon an accurate
diagnosis of the relevant societal cleavages and upon often-volatile
public opinion.56 If AI incentivizes either side---most likely
Beijing---to more frequently wade into these murky waters, it could
provoke or exacerbate political crises.

Pathway 3: Uncrewed Autonomous Systems

One of the main military applications of AI could be to enable uncrewed
systems---often called "drones"---to operate autonomously.57 The authors
use "robotic systems" as shorthand for those that can carry out their
missions largely without human input, while recognizing that in practice
systems may exhibit a spectrum of autonomy. Sophisticated and numerous
military robots create increasing potential for deliberate, inadvertent,
or accidental escalation, especially in times of crisis.58 The United
States and China are developing such systems, both in familiar
configurations, such as aircraft and submersibles, as well as in more
novel ones, such as "swarms" of small robots.59 Artificial intelligence,
whether machine learning or other computational techniques such as
control theory, is a key component of functional autonomy.

Robotic systems can lead to deliberate escalation in four main ways.
First, if autonomy provides superior capability, political and military
leaders may simply be more inclined to use force because they believe
their chances of success on the battlefield are higher. Second, the
lower expected risk, in human casualties, of military operations using
robots could make leaders on either side more likely to undertake them.
Paradoxically, the target country similarly could be more likely to
respond with force. When leaders perceive a cap on the severity of
violence, it may make them more risk-acceptant in operating and
responding to robotic systems in ways they otherwise would not with
crewed platforms. Recent circumnavigations of Taiwan by Chinese combat
and reconnaissance drones provide an illustrative example of this
dynamic. 61

Third, increased computational power could also augment the autonomous
capabilities of existing systems in ways that may lead to crisis
instability. For example, military AI can help improve hypersonic
weapons' ability to maneuver in the terminal phase to avoid air and
missile defenses. On the other hand, machine learning could also
heighten the predictive power of air and missile defenses, enabling the
deployment of counter-hypersonic and other high-end missile defense
systems.62 More broadly, analysts debate the degree to which hypersonic
weapons are destabilizing and provide truly new capabilities to the
countries that operate them.63 All things considered, it is too soon to
be certain about the net impact of AI-enabled autonomy on
military-technological concepts such as cost-exchange ratios,
first-strike advantages, and costs of power projection across various
domains. But policymakers will have to closely watch the development of
military AI for signs that it might push these variables in
destabilizing directions.

Fourth, low-cost uncrewed aircraft operating in swarms could
theoretically create new options for conventional counterforce strikes
against an adversary's nuclear arsenal. This potential capability
contributes to a larger trend that threatens to upset the strategic
balance: Chinese analysts frequently express concerns about the
possibility of effective U.S. nuclear counterforce strikes, including
with advanced conventional weapons such as drone swarms.64 They see that
possibility as undermining what they call the "asymmetric strategic
stability" between the United States and China by threatening Beijing's
second-strike retaliatory capability.65 And they contend that Beijing's
nuclear buildup is, at least in part, aimed at restoring balance in that
area.

Next, related dynamics could lead to inadvertent escalation---that is,
escalation arising from an action taken intentionally but that has
unintended effects. Because robotic systems are still relatively new and
expectations around them are evolving, countries may harbor
misperceptions about whether an adversary views a given action as
crossing some escalatory threshold.66 If one state shoots down or seizes
an enemy asset under the assumption that its adversary views such an act
as part of the normal push and pull of international rivalry, but the
adversary instead views it as a provocation or even an act of war, the
first state will have inadvertently crossed an important strategic line.

At first blush, the historical record suggests that an incident
involving an uncrewed system is unlikely to lead to serious escalation.
In the past several years, both Iran and Russia have shot down U.S.
drones; in neither instance did the United States retaliate with
force.67 In these examples, both states seemingly treated an uncrewed
aircraft as less of an escalatory catalyst than a crewed aircraft would
have been. [The United States and China have confronted a similar, if
less drastic, situation: [In December 2016, China seized a]{.mark} U.S.
Navy **[uncrewed]{.mark} underwater [vehicle]{.mark}** (UUV) [in
the]{.mark} **[S]{.mark}**outh **[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea. That
incident was resolved swiftly and without escalation. In addition,
[China has used **drones** as part of its]{.mark} larger **[campaign to
harass Taiwan]{.mark}**'s military forces and contest Taipei's
administration of the territory, waters, and airspace of Taiwan and its
outlying islands. Taiwan military personnel have shot down such civilian
drones without provoking immediate military retaliation.68]{.underline}

[However, the above examples should not lead to complacency, as they
**lack important features of plausible U.S.-China crisis
scenarios**.]{.underline} Neither the Iranian drone nor the U.S.-China
UUV incident included armed systems. In the Russia case, while the drone
concerned was capable of attack operations and the incident happened
during an ongoing political crisis, it also took place amid a context in
which both sides have exercised caution about a direct U.S.-Russia
confrontation.69 [[In a **potential future** ]{.mark}**Taiwan
[contingency]{.mark}** []{.mark}in which high-end **[U.S.-China combat
is a live possibility]{.mark}**, there is no guarantee that actions
against robotic systems, especially if armed, will be met with such
restraint.]{.underline}

Finally, autonomous systems may lead to accidental escalation in cases
of error, malfunction, or the limited flexibility of autonomous
systems.70 If machines are given the wrong parameters for a mission or
if they malfunction, they could stray into an adversary's territory;
encounter adversary civilian or military forces in the sea, air, or
space; or accidentally harm human beings. This could lead to a crisis
initiation or escalation, depending on the adversary's response. Even if
they are given proper parameters and perform as programmed, robotic
systems may fail to adjust to rapidly changing, "out-of-sample"
environments. Or they could correctly perform as programmed, but the
political context or environment changes. Such failures could lead them
to take actions different from what a human would have done (or wanted
the robots to do) in the changed circumstances. Moreover, one of the
advantages of autonomous systems is their relative lower cost per unit.
Depending on the configuration, that may mean more assets operating
independently in contested areas and therefore more possibilities for
incidents to occur.

Pathway 4: Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance

Military AI is already enabling new tools for fulfilling intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and will likely do more
in the future. Military AI can be combined with old technologies to do
new things or do them better or more cheaply. Possible examples include
combining AI with balloons or microsatellite constellations to conduct
surveillance in "near space" or employing swarming capability for ISR
drones.71 When norms around such surveillance technologies do not exist
or are flimsy, crises may arise. This happened earlier in history with
the advent of high-altitude aircraft and satellite ISR in the 1950s and
1960s, despite attempts by the Eisenhower administration to reach an
understanding on those capabilities with the Soviet Union.72 It was not
until the waning days of the Cold War that the United States revived the
idea of international agreement on aerial reconnaissance, leading to the
1992 signing of the Treaty on Open Skies.73

Next, some improvements in military AI could beget capabilities that
would change structural elements of the military-technological
landscape. AI systems could enable large-scale processing of data from
various sensors to track mobile missile systems on land and even
submarines at sea, especially if combined with other emerging
technologies, such as quantum sensors.74 Those applications are still
only theoretical but could be feasible in the medium term.75 If they
come to pass, they would create transparency with destabilizing effects.
They could undermine the survivability---the property of a military
system that makes it hard for adversary forces to find and destroy---of
components of two legs of the nuclear triad by enabling adversary
tracking and targeting of those assets for counterforce strikes. To be
sure, some analysts contest those predictions.76

Still, one real possibility could be that military AI has the highly
destabilizing impact of suddenly making vulnerable capabilities that
were developed and fielded precisely because of their survivability.
Fear of vulnerability to a sudden first strike can create
use-it-or-lose-it pressures that increase the risk of nuclear
escalation. Indeed, Chinese scholars have noted this trend, along with
the potential challenges to second-strike capabilities posed by
conventional AI-enabled drones. Chen Qi and Zhu Rongsheng of the Center
for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University explain
that China and Russia "fear that \[the United States'\] powerful
reconnaissance capabilities could mature into a threat to their more
sophisticated retaliatory forces" and note that "all AI needs to do is
undermine the level of retaliatory capability" to elicit a response.77
Moreover, perceptions or fears that an adversary could gain a particular
capability are sometimes enough to create a sense of vulnerability or
even precipitate countermeasures, regardless of whether those actually
exist or could exist in a relevant time frame.

At the same time, more transparency could be stabilizing in some
instances. AI could improve radar tracking systems and other
surveillance tools. In the nuclear deterrence and arms control domains,
some analysts argue that military AI could enhance stability and
mitigate risks across a variety of applications. These include providing
earlier warning, generating more accurate information to dispel
misperceptions or correct sensor malfunctions, improving military
planning and wargaming, and empowering new arms control verification
tools.78

Pathway 5: Command, Control, and Communications

Improvements in military AI could also unleash a revolution in command,
control, and communications (C3). China is trying to capture a leading
edge in C3 through its multidomain precision warfare concept. The United
States likewise seeks advantage through its Joint All-Domain Command and
Control (JADC2) concept.79 Both want to develop improved C3 that can
gather and fuse data from different "sensors" and rapidly feed that data
as battlefield information to commanders and then as targets for
"shooters." And they want to simultaneously degrade, disrupt, or destroy
the other side's C3. The net outcomes of a real-world interaction
between those two systems---each improving its own C3 while damaging its
adversary's---will be impossible to assess in advance. That is due to
the relative immaturity of these fully integrated "system-of-systems"
capabilities; a lack of transparency, especially for China; and the many
variables at play.

Nevertheless, AI promises improvements in several areas related to C3.
AI could make cyber and electromagnetic warfare (EW) attacks more
potent.80 As big data assumes ever-greater importance as both an input
to and object of AI, both sides will face incentives to "poison" the
adversary's data by modifying training or fine-tuning datasets to
intentionally degrade the system's performance. That could lead to
uncertain downstream behavior, or predictable malfunctions that
adversaries could exploit, of AI-enabled C3 systems.81 One study found
that data poisoning in dual-use systems, such as large language models,
can be done with as few as 100 poison examples in a large data set.82

AI could also improve China's capacity to direct attacks on the
satellites that form the backbone of C3 networks. To be sure, most
existing antisatellite (ASAT) capabilities do not rely on artificial
intelligence. Instead, they employ conventional missiles, EW, and
cyberattack techniques.83 But press reports have shown PRC researchers
exploring concepts for small "hunter" satellites that could use AI to
guide propulsion and steering as they move in irregular patterns to seek
and disable or destroy the satellites they target.84 As both countries'
C3 and counter-C3 capabilities evolve, national leaders could face
increased pressures to "use or lose" weapons during a crisis or
conflict, which could lead to rapid escalation.

Another specific concern is that military AI could affect C3 systems for
nuclear weapons. Nuclear early warning systems will increasingly rely on
AI for fusing and rapidly analyzing data from a variety of sensors. Such
systems could misinterpret the data and produce either false positives
that report a missile is incoming when it is not, or false negatives
that show no threats when in reality a missile is on its way.85 China's
decision to move at least some of its nuclear forces to a
launch-on-warning posture could shorten the time available to
double-check or reassess information about incoming threats.86

Finally, concerns over time pressure or threats to senior levels of
government with command-and-control authority might lead to nuclear
capabilities, posture, or policy changes. Both countries will face
pressures and incentives to devolve control over nuclear launch
decisions down the chain of command to ensure those decisions can be
made quickly in a crisis or even after a nuclear exchange. Taken to its
logical extreme, China--- or any other nuclear state---could decide to
build an automated retaliatory capability. That concept is often
referred to as a "dead hand" after a Soviet system of that type from the
Cold War.87 Neither Beijing nor Washington appears to be developing such
a capability, and their official policies rule it out.88 But the
structural pressures will remain and could become more intense over time
as military AI matures.

Options for Managing Strategic Risks from Military AI

The United States will need to undertake a portfolio of measures to
address the various dangers that military AI poses in the bilateral
security relationship with China. Just as these sources of risk may
overlap in practice, approaches in a risk management portfolio will aim
at reducing multiple different drivers of instability. This section
describes three major categories of strategic risk reduction options
and, where applicable, outlines the steps already taken by Washington
and Beijing within each line of effort.

**[Competition through Obstructing China's Military AI and U.S.
Capability Development]{.underline}**

One pathway by which [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark} may **[encourage
[deliberate escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}** is [[if it provides **one
side** with a large enough]{.mark} military capability [advantage that
the country **believes it can launch a war**]{.mark} [and **achieve**
]{.mark}**its [objectives at]{.mark} an [acceptable
]{.mark}**[cost.]{.mark} In almost all plausible contingency scenarios,
the [PRC would be]{.mark} the **[first mover given]{.mark} its
[revisionist ambitions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Therefore, one set of
[[policy options]{.mark} for Washington **[involve]{.mark}**s
**[preventing Beijing from using AI to tip the military balance of
power]{.mark}** decisively **[in China's favor]{.mark}**.]{.underline}89
To do so, the United States can attempt to deny China the technological
advancements necessary to achieve the PLA's "intelligentization" goals.
Or [Washington can develop the **U**nited **S**tates' own AI
capabilities to be **sufficiently advanced** and **well-performing** so
that China never achieves a commanding lead]{.underline}.

**[U.S. leaders are already attempting to do both
simultaneously]{.underline}**. In October 2022, Washington enacted
far-reaching prohibitions against exporting advanced computing and
semiconductor manufacturing items and know-how to China.90 The United
States has also imposed sanctions and export controls on entities and
individuals that work with the PLA, including on military AI issues (in
addition to other reasons).91 Washington places some restrictions on
investments into the United States and is expected to restrict some
outbound investments into China soon.92 Taken together, these actions
are aimed at constraining China's ability to develop military AI by
stymieing commercial and industrial developments on which the PLA could
draw. [At the same time, the Department of Defense (DoD) is proceeding
with efforts to develop and deploy military AI that can increase its
overall combat power]{.underline}.93

#### \-\--Extra Impact

**Independently, maintaining the [U.S. lead]{.underline} is key to
prevent [authoritarian]{.underline}, [misaligned]{.underline} AI. That's
an [existential risk]{.underline}.**

not end humanity," ASPI, November 2023,

Other scientists and world leaders took note and, seven years later,
[the **race to control AI**]{.underline} and its [**governance** is
**on**. Over the **past month**, US President]{.underline} Joe
**[Biden]{.underline}** has [issued an **executive order on AI
safety**]{.underline}, [the **G7** announced the Hiroshima AI Process
and **28 countries signed** the **Bletchley Declaration** at the UK's AI
Safety Summit.]{.underline} Even [the]{.underline}
**[C]{.underline}**hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty [is seeking to **carve out its
own**]{.underline} [leadership role with the **Global AI**]{.underline}
Governance **[Initiative]{.underline}**.

These developments indicate that governments are starting to take the
potential benefits and risks of AI equally seriously. But [as the
**security implications** of AI **become clearer**, [it's
**vital**]{.mark} that [democracies **outcompete**]{.mark}
**[authoritarian]{.mark}** political system[s]{.mark} [to ensure]{.mark}
**future [AI]{.mark} models** [reflect **democratic values**]{.mark} and
are **[not]{.mark} concentrated** in **institutions beholden** to the
**[whims of dictators]{.mark}**. At the same time,
countries]{.underline} [must proceed cautiously, with adequate
guardrails, and shut down unsafe AI projects when
necessary.]{.underline}

[**Whether** AI models will]{.underline} outperform humans [in the
**near future**]{.underline} and [pose **existential risks** is a
**contentious** question. [For]{.mark}]{.underline} some
[[**researchers** who have **studied**]{.mark} these technologies [for
**decades**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the **[performance]{.mark}** of AI
models like]{.underline} AlphaGo and [**ChatGPT [are evidence]{.mark}**
that the general **[foundations]{.mark}**]{.underline} for human-level
AI [[have **been achieved**]{.underline}]{.mark} and that an AI system
that's more intelligent than humans across a range of tasks will likely
be deployed within our lifetimes. Those systems are known as artificial
general intelligence (AGI), artificial superintelligence or general AI.

[For example, most [AI]{.mark} models now [use **neural
networks**]{.mark}]{.underline}, an old machine-learning technique
created in the 1940s that was [inspired by]{.underline} the biological
neural networks of animal [brains]{.underline}. The abilities of modern
neural networks like AlphaGo weren't fully appreciated until computer
chips used mostly for gaming [and]{.underline} video rendering, known as
graphics processing units, became **[powerful enough]{.underline}** in
the 21st century [to process the computations needed
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} specific **[[human]{.mark}-level
[tasks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The next step towards AGI was the arrival of large-language models, such
as OpenAI's GPT-4, which are created [using]{.underline} a version of
neural networks known as '**[transformers]{.underline}**'. OpenAI's
previous version of its chatbot, GPT-3, surprised everyone in 2020 by
generating text that was indistinguishable from that written by people
and performing a range of language-based tasks with few or no examples.
GPT-4, the latest model, has demonstrated human-level reasoning
capabilities and outperformed human test-takers on the US bar exam, a
notoriously difficult test for lawyers. Future iterations are expected
to have the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge at a level
equal to, or beyond, humans across all useful tasks.

[[AGI would be the **most** disruptive]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology
humanity **has created**]{.underline}. An AI system that can automate
human analytical thinking, creativity and communication at a large scale
and generate insights, content and reports from huge datasets would
bring about enormous social and economic change. [It would be **our
generation's Oppenheimer moment**]{.underline}, only [with **strategic
impacts** beyond just **military** and **security** applications. The
**[first]{.mark} country** [to]{.mark} **successfully [deploy]{.mark}**
[it would have **significant advantages** in **every**]{.mark}
**scientific** and **economic** **[activity]{.mark}** across almost
**all industries**. For **those reasons**, long-term **geopolitical
competition** between **liberal democracies** and **authoritarian
countries** is **fuelling** an **arms race**]{.underline} to develop and
control AGI.

[At the **core** of this race is **ideological competition**, which
**pushes governments** to **support the development** of AGI in **their
country first**, [since]{.mark} the **[tech]{.mark}nology**
[will]{.mark} **likely [reflect]{.mark}** the [**values of the
inventor** and **set**]{.mark} **the [standards]{.mark}** for **future
applications**. This raises important questions about **what world
views** we **want AGIs to express**. Should an AGI value **freedom** of
political expression]{.underline} above social stability[?]{.underline}
Or [[should it align]{.mark} itself [with]{.mark} a
[rule-**by**]{.mark}-law [or rule-**of**]{.mark}-[law]{.mark}
society?]{.underline} With our current methods, researchers don't even
know if it's possible to predetermine those values in AGI systems before
they're created.

[It's **promising** that universities, corporations and civil research
groups **in [democracies]{.mark}** are **[lead]{.mark}ing** the
development of AGI **[so far]{.mark}**. **Companies**]{.underline} like
OpenAI, Anthropic and DeepMind are household names and [have been
**working closely** with the **US government** to consider a **range of
AI safety policies**. **[But]{.mark}** **startups**, **large
corporations** and **research [teams]{.mark}** developing **AGI [in
China]{.mark}**, under the **authoritarian rule of the CCP**,
[are]{.mark} quickly [catching up]{.mark} and pose **significant
competition**. [China]{.mark} **certainly [has]{.mark}** the
**[talent]{.mark}**, the [**resources** and]{.mark} the
**[intent]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}but faces additional
regulatory hurdles and a lack of high-quality, open-source
Chinese-language datasets. In addition, large-language models threaten
the CCP's monopoly on domestic information control by offering
alternative worldviews to state propaganda.

Nonetheless, [we **shouldn't underestimate** the **capacity** of
**Chinese entrepreneurs** to **innovate** under difficult regulatory
conditions. If a research team in [China]{.mark}, **subject to the
CCP**'s National Intelligence Law, were to **develop** and tame AGI or
**near-AGI capabilities first**, it [would]{.mark}]{.underline} further
[**[entrench]{.mark} the party's [power]{.mark}** [to
**repress**]{.mark}]{.underline} its domestic population
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} ability to [[**interfere** with]{.mark} the
**[sovereignty]{.mark}** of **other countries**. China's state security
system or [the]{.mark} **[P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation
[A]{.mark}rmy** [could]{.mark} **deploy it** to **[supercharge]{.mark}**
their **[cyberespionage]{.mark} operations** or **[automate]{.mark}**
the **discovery of [zero-day vulnerabilities]{.mark}**. The Chinese
government could **[embed]{.mark} it** as [a **superhuman
adviser**]{.mark} in its **bureaucracies** [to make]{.mark}]{.underline}
better [**operational**, **military**, **economic** or **foreign-policy
[decisions]{.mark}** [and **propaganda**]{.mark}. **Chinese companies**
could]{.underline} [**[sell]{.mark}** their **[AGI]{.mark} services** to
**foreign government** departments and **companies** [with **back
doors**]{.mark} in[to]{.mark} their systems or covertly **[suppress
content]{.mark}**]{.underline} and topics [**[abroad]{.mark}** at the
direction of Chinese security services]{.underline}.

At the same time, an [**unfettered** [AGI]{.mark}]{.underline} arms race
between democratic and [**[authoritarian]{.mark} system[s]{.mark}**
[could **exacerbate**]{.mark} **various e[x]{.mark}istential
[risks]{.mark}**, either [by **enabling** future **malign use**]{.mark}
by **state** and **non-state** actors [or]{.mark} through **[poor
alignment]{.mark}** of the **AI's own objectives**. [AGI
could]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance, [**lower the impediments** for
**savvy malicious actors** to develop **bioweapons** or
**[supercharge]{.mark} [disinfo]{.mark}rmation**]{.underline} and
influence [operations. An AGI could **itself become destructive** if it
pursues **poorly described goals** or takes **shortcuts** such as
**deceiving humans** to achieve goals more efficiently.]{.underline}

[When Meta **trained** Cicero to play]{.underline} the board game
[Diplomacy **'honestly'**]{.underline} by generating only messages that
reflected its intention in each interaction, [analysts
**noted**]{.underline} that [it could **still withhold**
information]{.underline} [about its **true intentions**]{.underline} or
not inform other players when its intentions changed. [These are
**serious**]{.underline} considerations with **[immediate
risks]{.underline}** [and have **led many AI experts** and people who
study existential risk to **call** for a **pause**]{.underline} on
advanced AI research. [**But** **policymakers worldwide** are **unlikely
to stop** [given]{.mark} the [**strong incentives** to be a **first
mover**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This all may sound futuristic, but it's not as far away as you might
think. In a 2022 survey, 352 AI experts put a 50% chance of human-level
machine intelligence arriving in 37 years---that is, 2059. The
forecasting community on the crowd-sourced platform Metaculus, which has
a robust track record of AI-related forecasts, is even more confident of
the imminent development of AGI. The aggregation of more than 1,000
forecasters suggests 2032 as the likely year general AI systems will be
devised, tested and publicly announced. But that's just the current
estimate---experts and the amateurs on Metaculus have shortened their
timelines each year as new AI breakthroughs are publicly announced.

That means democracies have a lead time of between 10 and 40 years to
prepare for the development of AGI. [[The **key challenge** will
be]{.underline}]{.mark} how [[to]{.mark} **prevent AI existential
risks** while **[innovat]{.mark}ing [faster]{.mark}**
[than]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[authoritarian]{.mark} political
system[s]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

First, [**policymakers** in **democracies** **must attract** **global AI
talent**, including from **China** and **Russia**, to help **align AGI
models** with **democratic values**]{.underline}. Talent is also needed
within government policymaking departments [and]{.underline} think tanks
[to **assess** AGI **implications** and **build** the **bureaucratic
capacity** to **rapidly adapt** to future developments]{.underline}.

Second, governments should be proactively monitoring all AGI research
and development activity and should pass legislation that allows
regulators to shut down or pause exceptionally risky projects. We should
remember that Beijing has more to worry about with regard to AI
alignment because the CCP is too worried about its own political safety
to relax its strict rules on AI development.

We therefore shouldn't see government involvement only in terms of its
potential to slow us down. At a minimum, all countries, including the US
and China, should be transparent about their AGI research and advances.
That should include publicly disclosing their funding for AGI research
and safety policies and identifying their leading AGI developers.

Third, [liberal democracies **must**]{.underline} collectively [maintain
**as large a lead as possible** in **AI development**]{.underline} and
further restrict access to high-end technology, intellectual property,
strategic datasets and foreign investments in China's AI and
national-security industries. Impeding the CCP's AI development in its
military, security and intelligence industries is also morally
justifiable in preventing human rights violations.

For example, Midu, an AI company based in Shanghai that supports China's
propaganda and public-security work, recently announced the use of
large-language models to automate reporting on public opinion analysis
to support surveillance of online users. While China's access to
advanced US technologies and investment has been restricted, other
like-minded countries such as Australia should implement similar
outbound investment controls into China's AI and national-security
industries.

Finally, [governments should **create incentives** for the **market** to
develop **safe** AGI and **solve the alignment problem**]{.underline}.
Technical research on AI capabilities is outpacing technical research on
AI alignment and companies are failing to put their money where their
mouth is. Governments should create prizes for research teams or
individuals to solve difficult AI alignment problems. One model
potential model could be like the Clay Institute's Millennium Prize
Problems, which provides awards for solutions to some of the world's
most difficult mathematics problems.

Australia is an attractive destination for global talent and is already
home to many AI safety researchers. The Australian government should
capitalise on this advantage to become an international hub for AI
safety and alignment research. The Department of Industry, Science and
Resources should set up the world's first AGI prize fund with at least
\$100 million to be awarded to the first global research team to align
AGI safely.

The National Artificial Intelligence Centre should oversee a board that
manages this fund and work with the research community to create a list
of conditions and review mechanisms to award the prize. With \$100
million, the board could adopt a similar investment mandate as
Australia's Future Fund to achieve an average annual return of at least
the consumer price index plus 4--5% per annum over the long term.
Instead of being reinvested into the fund, the 4--5% interest accrued
each year on top of CPI should be used as smaller awards for incremental
achievements in AI research each year. These awards could also be used
to fund AI PhD scholarships or attract AI postdocs to Australia. Other
awards could be given to research, including research conducted outside
Australia, in annual award ceremonies, like the Nobel Prize, which will
bring together global experts on AI to share knowledge and progress.

A \$100 million fund may seem a lot for AI research but, as a
comparison, Microsoft is rumoured to have invested US\$10 billion into
OpenAI this year alone. And \$100 million pales in comparison to the
contributions safely aligned AGI would have on the national economy.

[The **stakes are high** for **getting**]{.underline}
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**G**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**right**.
**If** [properly **aligned**]{.mark} and developed, it [could

**[prosperity]{.mark}** and enlightenment. **[But]{.mark}**]{.underline}
AGI [[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} pursued recklessly [[could]{.mark}
pose **real risks** of creating **dangerous superhuman AI** systems
**or** [bring]{.mark}ing about **[global catastrophes]{.mark}**.
Democracies **must not cede leadership** of AGI development to
**authoritarian** systems, **but nor** should]{.underline} [they rush to
secure a **Pyrrhic** victory by going ahead with models that fail to
embed respect for]{.underline} human rights, [liberal values and basic
safety]{.underline}.

[This tricky **balance** between innovation and safety is **the reason**
[policymakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, intelligence agencies, industry,
civil society and researchers **[[must]{.underline}]{.mark}** work
together to [**shape the future** of AGIs and cooperate with the
**global community**]{.underline} [to [navigate]{.mark} an uncertain
period of **elevated human-[extinction risks]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

### Plan

#### Plan: The United States federal government should significantly increase its development of geothermal energy projects in the Arctic.

### Solvency 

#### US development of geothermal in the Arctic demonstrates and streamlines the tech -- that causes rapid uptake and modeling.

Opportunities on the Pacific Rim can kick-start a critical sector,"

https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/10/07/alaska-geothermal-military-china/)

[Strategic [energy tech]{.mark}nologies often [start small but can
**scale quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with]{.mark} judicious
front-end [policy support]{.mark}]{.underline} if they possess
competitive thermodynamic and technological advantages. Since World War
II, the U.S. Defense Department and other agencies have played key roles
in helping nuclear power, grid-size batteries, and other new energy
concepts achieve commercial scale. [[**Geothermal** energy]{.mark}
development [now presents the next such **development**
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the U.S. Energy Information
Administration explains, "\[t\]he slow decay of radioactive particles in
the Earth's core" creates hot rock and subsurface water that can be
tapped for direct heat and to create steam energy that spins turbines
and generates electricity.

The Pacific Rim is one of the world's most promising prospective places
for expanding geothermal power development, with advantages for both
local energy security, emissions reduction, and U.S. geoeconomic
position. [[Alaska can anchor this new geoeconomic energy
vector]{.underline}]{.mark}. America's largest and westernmost state
features strategically located ports, cities, and current (and likely
future) military facilities that often sit atop or near areas of high
geothermal potential.

[[To realize this potential requires financing "first of a kind"
**demonstration projects** that]{.underline}]{.mark}, if successful,
[**[can de-risk the resource and catalyze broader regional
scale-up]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [Achieving eventual multi-gigawatt
scale would both enhance U.S. strategic resilience and]{.underline},
critically, the strategic resilience of [allies such as Taiwan who face
coercion, especially over energy, by China.]{.underline} Key government
agencies' substantial facility footprints, need for resilience, and
ability to underwrite power purchase agreements can make them
transformative early adopters.

[There appears to be the political will to get this done]{.underline},
with Ravi Chaudhary, the U.S. Air Force assistant secretary for energy,
installations, and the environment, saying in September 2023,
"Geothermal sources strengthen our energy grids and give us the ability
to isolate threats before they impact our operations. This type of
capability will translate into victory in a high-end fight."

[Alaska's geographic importance coincides with emerging U.S. technical
excellence. [**Geothermal powe**r]{.mark}]{.underline}, like high tech
and aerospace[, is a sector of American competitive advantage that [can
be leveraged as part of a broader energy abundance agenda]{.mark} in a
region that is leading global energy transitions. [In the geothermal
space, firms]{.mark}]{.underline} such as Eavor, Fervo Energy, GreenFire
Energy, Sage Geosystems, Teverra, and Zanskar Geothermal and Minerals
are developing cutting edge approaches that [[leverage the massive
subsurface **expertise** and **experience U.S. companies have built**
through drilling and fracking]{.underline}]{.mark} tens of thousands of
shale oil and gas wells [over the past 20 years.]{.underline}

The new generation of enhanced geothermal wells use cutting-edge oil and
gas techniques including horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and
distributed fiber optic sensing to monitor reservoir conditions. They
also dramatically expand the number of locations suitable for geothermal
power development and, because well pairs can be added modularly, help
manage project developers' financial risk.

[U.S. firms enjoy unique competitive advantages here, ones that if
harnessed through smart policy can help advance energy security
interests on our own soil in Alaska]{.underline} and the Aleutians, as
well as in Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan.

[[Geothermal energy offers the 24/7/365 **baseload electricity**]{.mark}
supplies that countries need for building out and operating competitive
industrial bases]{.underline}. Because it can continually run regardless
of weather or sunlight, every megawatt of geothermal power that comes
online can displace coal, gas, or oil-based dispatchable generation.
[Climate benefits follow.]{.underline} Furthermore, unlike hydropower
and many other thermal power plant types, [**geothermal** is
substantially decoupled from drought risk]{.underline}. It is also
potentially capable of load-following to fill gaps in wind and solar
generation, a capability that Sage Geosystems has recently demonstrated
at megawatt-scale.

[Geothermal generation's engagement of physical heat also opens
possibilities for supporting food cultivation in greenhouses and
distillation of seawater.]{.underline} [Where warranted by remoteness
(Aleutian Islands) or by strategic circumstances (Taiwan), geothermal
power can also potentially support **green hydrogen production and
liquid fuel synthesis**.]{.underline}

[Geothermal power also brings security benefits. Policymakers are
recognizing in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine that during
industrial warfare, energy assets can and will be targeted.]{.underline}
Fossil fuel generation facilities on islands are the most vulnerable
because an adversary can trigger blackouts through interdicting seaborne
fuel imports and does not even need to strike on land to create
potentially strategic effects. This is true for vital U.S. territories,
including the Aleutian islands of Unalaska and Adak; Shemya Island;
Guam; and Hawaii.

For Taiwan, which faces the real risk of a blockade by China, each
gigawatt of geothermal power brought online could, potentially displace
about 1.25 million tons per year of liquified natural gas imports, or
roughly 6 percent of the island's total import volume in 2023. That
estimate assumes that the geothermal facilities run at a 90 percent
utilization rate and that the LNG would have been used to generate
electricity in modern combined cycle power plants with a 50 percent
thermal efficiency.

Geothermal projects could be sized to power all, or at least a major
part, of some of these key islands' electricity needs in way that helps
resist potential blockades. Geothermal also has the advantage of being
less politically controversial than nuclear power and, unlike
contemporary nuclear generators, can be deployed in increments more
modularly sized to the local market.

[Accelerated geothermal energy developments in the Indo-Pacific, perhaps
backed by the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. or Office of
Strategic Capital as part of a low-carbon energy abundance package,
would also offer a template for U.S. firms to play leading
roles]{.underline} in Latin America and East Africa, two other priority
regions that are---pun fully intended---geothermal power hotspots. [The
potential global addressable market in key regions of interest
encompasses tens of gigawatts of generation capacity at the outset---a
major commercial and strategic opportunity.]{.underline} **[[If the
first advanced geothermal projects pan out commercially, the market
space would likely expand substantially]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Measuring the effectiveness of adaptation

The [latest assessment]{.underline} report [from]{.underline} the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC]{.underline})
[shows]{.underline} that [**current adaptation efforts** are
**insufficient** to cope with the increasing severity of warming-related
impacts across the world.]{.underline}

This ["**[adaptation gap]{.underline}**]{.mark}" -- the difference
between what is needed to reduce impacts and what has been implemented
-- [[**is growing, despite increasing** adaptation **efforts**]{.mark}
across all world regions.]{.underline}

Where adaptation has been documented, many benefits -- such as economic
gains, better educational outcomes or infrastructure improvements --
have been observed. However, we still have very limited evidence and
knowledge about how effective adaptation is in reducing climate risks --
arguably the key purpose of adaptation.

This is, of course, an inherently difficult thing to measure, as it is
not possible to calculate impacts that have been avoided because of
adaptation.

Different ideas of how to measure adaptation effectiveness have been put
forward. In a very narrow sense, the IPCC defines adaptation
effectiveness as the extent to which an adaptation option is anticipated
or observed to reduce climate-related risk, an approach we use in our
study. More encompassing definitions of effectiveness include the
multiple benefits adaptation can have on a broader set of outcomes, such
as human well-being and equality.

A better understanding of the risk reduction potential of adaptation is
crucial, as climate impacts will become more severe over the next
decades. With limited resources to invest, it is essential that informed
decisions can be made.

Adaptation as the world warms

In our study, we look at a set of frequently used adaptation
interventions in the water and agricultural sectors, which are central
in current modelling approaches of future impacts.

We collated a set of published case studies distributed across all world
regions. We grouped these options into nine different types of
adaptation interventions -- shown in the map below.

For example, adaptation measures under "changes in cropping patterns and
crop systems" include approaches such as shifting planting dates or
substituting different crops. Measures related to "water and soil
moisture conservation" include approaches such as reduced tilling
(turning of the soil) or introducing mulching (covering topsoil with
plant material).

Each case study assesses in detail how a particular option could be
implemented according to specific local conditions and provides results
on its potential to reduce climate risks.

In many studies, different combinations of measures or different
specifications of one measure -- for example, shifting planting dates by
10, 20 or 30 days -- are tested. Where this leads to different levels of
effectiveness, we focus on those specifications that show to be most
effective in reducing risk.

Declining effectiveness

To set these case study results into a global context and align them
with important levels of warming, as in the IPCC reports, we translate
all results into a representation of adaptation effectiveness at 1.5C,
2C, 3C and 4C. To represent effectiveness, we assess the proportion of
projected risk that an adaptation option is able to avoid.

Our findings suggest a concerning picture: adaptation options are
effective in reducing risks in most assessed settings up to 1.5C of
warming, but with increased warming, effectiveness declines across all
options and regions.

The central estimate (that is, the median) of [[adaptation
effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark} across all assessed measures at 1.5C
is 90%. However, this **[[declines]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a median
effectiveness of 69% [[at 2C]{.mark}]{.underline} and 62% at 3C -- [[a
level that current policies could still take warming close
to]{.underline}.]{.mark}

At 4C, effectiveness declines even further to a median of 46%,
indicating that [[**less than half** of projected impacts **would be
avoided**]{.underline} [under the adaptation
measure]{.underline}.]{.mark}

The [decline in effectiveness]{.underline} is [most pronounced
for]{.underline} adaptation options related to
[agriculture]{.underline}. For example, changes in cropping patterns and
crop systems show high effectiveness at 1.5C, with more than 50% of data
points in this category, but the share of highly effective adaptation
decreases to 14% at 4C.

At the other end of the scale, we find that energy related adaptation
(85%), flood risk reduction measures (78%) and urban water (78%) are the
most likely categories to reduce 80% or more of projected risk across
all warming levels.

As models do not account for adaptation limits and barriers,
[[effectiveness in practice]{.underline} is [likely]{.underline} to be
**[lower]{.underline}** [than under idealised model
conditions]{.underline}]{.mark} we assess in our study.

In many cases, adaptation in a 1.5C world comes with potential
co-benefits, where the adaptation option improves conditions more
widely, relative to the baseline of current conditions. For example,
shifting from rain-fed agriculture to irrigation systems produces
co-benefits in multiple cases.

Our findings for adaptation across Africa show that co-benefits could be
substantial in closing existing adaptation gaps: 54% of assessed studies
indicate potential co-benefits at 1.5C. However, this potential declines
to 12% at 4C.

Similarly, in Asia the potential for co-benefits declines from around
56% at 1.5C to 16% at 4C. In Central and South America, our
[data]{.underline} also [shows a shift towards less effective adaptation
outcomes]{.underline}. There is no apparent shift in the level of
co-benefits that could be achieved, though it must be noted that much
fewer studies were available for this region.

In some situations, [adaptation]{.underline} becomes not just
ineffective in reducing risk, but it actually aggravates the situation,
[leading to "maladaptation]{.underline}".

Africa shows the largest share of maladaptive outcomes at all levels of
warming. For example, intensifying the cultivation of maize and sorghum
in west Africa or earlier planting of maize in Uganda further decreases
yields -- in addition to climate impacts -- rather than reducing
projected risk, even at 1.5C warming.

[[Models]{.underline} often **[overestimate the potential for
adaptation]{.underline}**]{.mark}

Currently, adaptation is not well represented in quantitative models.
Integrated assessment [models]{.underline} provide information on energy
system transition pathways to limit warming, but they [do not account
for **climate impacts** or costs and potentials for
adaptation.]{.underline}

Climate impact models assess the sectoral effects of warming -- for
example, on agriculture or the water system. Sectoral climate impact
models implement selected adaptation measures, such as irrigation in the
agricultural sector, for example, but [**do not account for
limitations** such as water availability.]{.underline}

But, even more importantly, models [do not account for other
**constraints and limits to adaptation**, which have been documented in
practice.]{.underline}

Beside **[financial barriers]{.underline}**, which are a fundamental
impediment to effective adaptation, there are also constraints and
[limits related to governance and institutions]{.underline},
**[availability of information]{.underline}**, awareness, **[human
capacity]{.underline}** and **[socio-cultural
constraints]{.underline}**. Similarly, adaptive capacity plays an
important role in the ability to implement effective adaptation.

Consequently, where [models]{.underline} include adaptation, they likely
**[overestimate its potential]{.underline}**. This is also true for our
own assessment: [we assess]{.underline} adaptation in a modelled
context, where **[ideal conditions]{.underline}** for implementing the
respective option are assumed. If additional adaptation constraints and
adaptive capacities were considered, the [extent to which adaptation can
effectively reduce climate risks may be further reduced.]{.underline}

[**Climate-resilient development** requires limiting warming to
1.5C]{.underline}

Our study focuses on a limited set of adaptation options, which are
currently frequently used and have direct entry-points into the
modelling space. It can be assumed that progress and learning unlock
further innovation for adaptation in the future, increasing the options
and approaches available to adapt and reduce risk.

However, we also know that additional limits and constraints are likely
to affect effectiveness as compared to a modelling environment that does
not consider such aspects.

Our findings show that [[effective adaptation]{.underline} is **[only
truly possible]{.underline}**]{.mark} [if it occurs **[alongside
ambitious mitigation action]{.mark}**]{.underline} that limits warming
to 1.5C. Our study also emphasises that **[[adaptation is not an
alternative to mitigation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, nor can it be seen as
a way to allow for a delay in mitigation efforts.

#### Every impact defense argument is [antithetical]{.underline} to the consensus of science.

science misconceptions -- debunked." 9/20/19.
https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2019/sep/analysis-five-climate-change-science-misconceptions-debunked

The science of climate change is more than 150 years old and it is
probably the most tested area of modern science. However the [energy
industry, political lobbyists and others have spent the last 30 years
sowing doubt about the science where **none really
exists**]{.underline}. The latest estimate is that the world's five
largest publicly-owned oil and gas companies spend about US\$200m each
year on lobbying to control, delay or block binding climate-motivated
policy.

This [organised and orchestrated climate change science denial has
contributed to the lack of progress in reducing global]{.underline}
greenhouse gas ([GHG]{.underline}) [emissions]{.underline} - to the
point that we are facing a global climate emergency. And when climate
change deniers use certain myths -- at best fake news and at worse
straight lies -- to undermine the science of climate change, ordinary
people can find it hard to see through the fog. Here are five commonly
used myths and the real science that debunks them.

1\. **[Climate change is just part of the natural cycle]{.underline}**

The [climate of the Earth has always changed, but the study of
[palaeoclimatology]{.mark} or "past climates" [shows us]{.mark} that the
changes in the [last 150 years]{.mark}]{.underline} -- since the start
of the industrial revolution -- [have been **[exceptional]{.mark}** and
**can[not]{.mark} be [natural]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Modelling results
suggest that future predicted warming could be unprecedented compared to
the previous 5m years.

Global temperatures for the last 65m years and possible future global
warming depending on the amount of greenhouse gases we emit. Burke et al
(2018)

The ["natural changes" argument is supplemented with the story that the
Earth's climate is just recovering from the cooler temperatures of the
Little Ice Age]{.underline} (1300-1850AD) and that temperatures today
are really the same as the Medieval Warm Period (900--1300AD). [The
problem is that both the Little Ice Age and the Medieval Warming period
**were not global** but **regional changes** in climate affecting
north-west Europe, eastern America, Greenland and Iceland.]{.underline}

A [study using [**700 climate records** show]{.mark}ed that, over the
last 2,000 years]{.underline}, the [[only time]{.mark} the [climate all
around the World has changed]{.mark} at the same time and in the same
direction [has been]{.mark} in the **[last 150
years]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} when [**[over 98%]{.mark}** of
the surface of the planet has warmed.]{.underline}

2\. **[Changes are due to [sunspots]{.mark}/galactic cosmic
rays]{.underline}**

Sunspots are storms on the sun's surface that come with intense magnetic
activity and can be accompanied by solar flares. These sunspots do have
the power to modify the climate on Earth. But [scientists using sensors
on satellites have been recording the amount of the sun's energy hitting
Earth since 1978 and **there [has been no upward
trend]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So [they [cannot be]{.mark} the [cause
of]{.mark} the recent global [warming]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are high-energy radiation that originates
outside our solar system and may even be from distant galaxies. It has
been suggested that they may help to seed or "make" clouds. So reduced
GCRs hitting the Earth would mean fewer clouds, which would reflect less
sunlight back into space and so cause Earth to warm.

But [there are two problems with this idea]{.underline}. First, [the
scientific evidence shows that [GCRs are **not**]{.mark} **very
[effective at seeding clouds]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And second, [over
the last 50 years, the amount of [GCRs]{.mark} have actually
**[increased]{.mark}**, hitting record levels in recent years. If this
idea were correct, GCRs **[should be cooling]{.mark} the
[Earth]{.mark}**, which **[they aren't]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

3\. **[CO₂ is a small part of the atmosphere]{.underline}** -- it can't
have a large heating affect

[This is an attempt to play a classic common-sense card but is
**completely wrong**]{.underline}. In 1856, American scientist Eunice
Newton Foote conducted an experiment with an air pump, two glass
cylinders and four thermometers. It showed that a cylinder containing
carbon dioxide and placed in the sun trapped more heat and stayed warmer
longer than a cylinder with normal air. Scientists have repeated these
experiments in the laboratory and in the atmosphere, demonstrating again
and again the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide.

As for the "common sense" scale argument that a very small part of
something can't have much of an effect on it, it only takes 0.1 grams of
cyanide to kill an adult, which is about 0.0001% of your body weight.
Compare this with [carbon dioxide]{.underline}, which currently [makes
up 0.04% of the atmosphere and is a **strong greenhouse
gas**]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [nitrogen makes up 78% of the atmosphere
and yet is **highly unreactive**.]{.underline}

4\. [[Scientists manipulate]{.mark} all [data]{.mark} sets to show a
warming trend]{.underline}

This is **[[not true]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and a]{.underline}
**[simplistic device]{.underline}** used to attack the credibility of
climate scientists. [It would [require]{.mark} a [conspiracy covering
**thousands**]{.mark} **of scientists [in more than]{.mark} a [100
countries]{.mark}** to reach the scale required to do this.]{.underline}

[Scientists do correct and validate data all the time]{.underline}. For
example we have to correct historic temperature records as how they were
measured has changed. Between 1856 and 1941, most sea temperatures were
measured using seawater hoisted on deck in a bucket. Even this was not
consistent as there was a shift from wooden to canvas buckets and from
sailing ships to steamships, which altered the height of the ship's deck
-- and these changes in turn altered the amount of cooling caused by
evaporation as the bucket was hoisted onto deck. Since 1941, most
measurements have been made at the ship's engine water intakes, so
there's no cooling from evaporation to account for.

We must also take account that many towns and cities have expanded and
so that meteorological stations that were in rural areas are now in
urban areas which are usually significantly warmer than the surrounding
countryside.

If we didn't make these changes to the original measurements, then
Earth's warming over the last 150 years would have appeared to be even
greater than the change that has actually been observed, which is now
about 1˚C of global warming.

5\. [Climate [models]{.mark} are unreliable and [too sensitive]{.mark}
to carbon dioxide]{.underline}

This is **[incorrect]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[[misunderstands
how models work]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It is a way of downplaying the
seriousness of future climate change]{.underline}. [[There is a **huge
range**]{.mark} **of climate models**]{.underline}, from those aimed at
specific mechanisms such as the understanding of clouds, to general
circulation models (GCMs) that are used to predict the future climate of
our planet.

[There are [over 20 major international centres]{.mark} where teams of
some of smartest people in the world have built and [run GCMs]{.mark}
containing **millions of lines of code**]{.underline} representing the
very latest understanding of the climate system. [These models are
**[continually tested]{.mark}** against historic and palaeoclimate data
as well as individual climate events such as large volcanic eruptions to
make sure they reconstruct the climate, which **they do extremely
well**]{.underline}.

No single model should ever be considered correct as they represent a
very complex global climate system. But [having so many different models
constructed and calibrated independently means that **[we can have
confidence when]{.mark} the [models agree]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Taking the whole range of climate models suggests a doubling of carbon
dioxide could warm the planet by 2˚C to 4.5˚C]{.underline}, with an
average of 3.1˚C. [**[All]{.mark} the models** [show]{.mark} a
[**significant amount of warming** when extra carbon]{.mark} dioxide is
[added]{.mark} to the atmosphere]{.underline}. [The [scale]{.mark} of
the predicted warming **has [remained]{.mark} very [similar]{.mark}**
over the last 30 years **[despite]{.mark} the huge increase in the
[complexity]{.mark}** of the models, showing it is a **robust outcome of
the science**]{.underline}.

By combining all our scientific knowledge of natural (solar, volcanic,
aerosols and ozone) and human-made (greenhouse gases and land-use
changes) factors warming and cooling the climate shows that 100% of the
warming observed over the last 150 years is due to humans.

[There is **no scientific support** for the continual denial of climate
change]{.underline}. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC), set up by the United Nations to openly and transparently
summarise the science, provides six clear lines of evidence for climate
change. As extreme weather becomes more and more common, people are
realising that they do not need scientists to tell them the climate is
changing -- they are seeing and experiencing it first-hand.

#### It erodes [ecosystem]{.underline} integrity, which is [independently]{.underline} existential AND collapses [general nuclear deterrence]{.underline}.

[A third set of]{.underline} plausible [scenarios stem from climate
change's **broader** environmental impacts]{.underline}. Apart from
being a planetary boundary of its own, Steffen et al. (2015) point out
that [climate change is **intimately** connected with other planetary
boundaries]{.underline} (see Table 1). Climate change is thus identified
by the authors as one of two 'core\' boundaries with the potential "to
drive the Earth system into a new state should they be substantially and
persistently transgressed." This transformative potential was elaborated
on in subsequent work exploring how the world could be pushed towards a
'Hothouse Earth' state, even with anthropogenic temperature rises as low
as 2 °C (Steffen et al., 2018).

[\[TABLE 1 REMOVED\]]{.underline}

[The [connection between climate]{.mark} change [and **biosphere
integrity**]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.underline}the [[survival
of]{.mark} complex **adaptive [ecosystems]{.mark}** supporting
**diverse** forms of life)]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} particularly
[strong]{.mark}]{.underline}. The IPCC is highly confident that
[[climate change is]{.mark} adversely impacting terrestrial
ecosystems]{.underline}, [[contributing to
**desertification**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and land
[degradation]{.mark}]{.underline} in many areas [[and]{.mark}
changing]{.underline} the [range, abundance and seasonality of many
plant and animal **species**]{.underline} (Arneth et al., 2019).
Similarly, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity
and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has reported that climate change is
restricting the range of nearly half the world's threatened mammal
species and a quarter of threatened birds, with marine, coastal, and
arctic ecosystems worst affected (Diaz et al., 2019). According to one
estimate, [climate change [could cause]{.mark} **15--[37 % of all
species]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to become]{.mark} 'committed to
**[extinct]{.mark}ion**']{.underline} [by mid-century]{.underline}
(Thomas et al., 2004).

[Disruption to biosphere integrity can have **profound**]{.underline}
[economic]{.underline} and [social repercussions]{.underline}, ranging
from loss of ecosystem services and natural resources to the destruction
of traditional knowledge and livelihoods. For instance,
[desertification]{.underline}, which threatens a quarter of Earth's land
area and a fifth of the population, is already estimated to [cost
developing nations 4--8 % of their GDP]{.underline} (United Nations,
2011). [Many other **[rapid]{.mark} regime
[shifts]{.mark}**]{.underline} [involving loss of biosphere integrity
[have been observed]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} shifts
[[in]{.mark} arid [vegetation]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[freshwater]{.underline}]{.mark}** eutrophication,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[collapse of **fish
populations**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Amano et al. 2020). [[There is
a]{.underline}]{.mark} theoretical [[possibility of]{.mark} still
**[more profound]{.mark}**]{.underline} [regime [shifts]{.mark} at the
**global** level]{.underline} (Rocha, Peterson, Bodin, & Levin, 2018).
However, the contribution of [loss of [biosphere
integrity]{.mark}]{.underline} to GCR is yet to be assessed.
**[[Kareiva]{.mark} and Carranza]{.underline}** (2018)
[[argue]{.underline}]{.mark} that it [[is unlikely to threaten]{.mark}
human [civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}, due both to a lack of
plausible mechanisms for this threat and the fact that "local and
regional biodiversity is often staying the same because species from
elsewhere replace local losses." **[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in
their classification of GCRs, [Avin]{.underline} et al. (2018) [suggest
the potential for [ecological collapse]{.mark} to
[threaten]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[safety]{.mark} boundaries [of
**multiple critical systems**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with **diverse
spread mechanisms** at]{.mark} a **range of
[scale]{.mark}s**]{.underline}, [from]{.underline} the [biogeochemical
and anatomical to]{.underline} the [ecological and
sociotechnological]{.underline}. Note that both these studies were
conducted for largely conceptual purposes and should not be taken as
rigorous analyses of this risk, this topic warrants further
investigation.

3.2. Classifying climate change's contributions to global catastrophic
risk

[Climate change\'s contribution to GCR goes **well beyond**]{.underline}
[its impact on the **earth system**]{.underline}. Taking Avin et al.'s
list of critical systems, we note that [previous studies have **mostly
focused**]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the [effects of climate change
on **physical** and **biogeochemical**]{.underline} [systems (e.g.
global temperature and sea-level rise)]{.underline} or the lower-level
critical systems that are most directly related to human health and
survival (e.g. Heath Stress). However, [these represent a **very
limited** assessment of risk]{.underline} as [it only accounts for
climate change as a **direct hazard**]{.underline}/threat
[and]{.underline} our \"**[ontological]{.underline}**\"
[vulnerabilities]{.underline} to it. [A more comprehensive risk
assessment must consider]{.underline} the **[higher-order]{.underline}**
[critical systems threatened by climate change]{.underline} passively
(through a lack of alternatives) and actively (through intentional
design).

[The probability of a global **catastrophe**]{.underline} [is higher
when **sociotechnological**]{.underline} [and environmental systems are
tightly coupled]{.underline}, [creating a potential for reinforcing
**feedback loops**]{.underline}. [If environmental change produces
**social changes**]{.underline} [that perpetuate further environmental
change]{.underline}, then [this could actively work
**against**]{.underline} our efforts at [adaptation]{.underline}. [When
this change]{.underline} has the potential to [produce significant
harm]{.underline}, via human vulnerabilities and exposure, [we
describe]{.underline} such loops as ['global [systems **death
spirals**]{.mark}.']{.underline} [These spirals]{.underline} could
[[produce **self-perpetuating** catastrophes]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[whereby]{.underline}]{.mark} the [energy and [resources]{.mark}
required [to]{.mark} **reverse or [adapt]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to
collapse [are **beyond**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[means of
**dwindling**]{.mark} human [societies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Feedback
loops like this could thus create tipping points beyond which returning
to anything like present conditions would become extremely difficult.
Global systems would shift to very different states in which the
prospects for humanity would likely be bleaker.

In the rest of this section, [we explore **just one potential
spiral**]{.underline}, [between]{.underline} an ecological system ([the
biosphere]{.underline}) [and]{.underline} two sociotechnological systems
([the human **food**]{.underline} [and global **political**]{.underline}
[systems]{.underline}). We explore each system and its interactions.
Fig. 2 illustrates our model of this spiral.

[\[FIGURE 2 REMOVED\]]{.underline}

3.2.1. The human food system

[[Climate change]{.mark}'s impact on biosphere integrity]{.underline}
(discussed in the previous section) [could [harm]{.mark} the human
**[food]{.mark} system**]{.underline} [[due to]{.mark} loss of ecosystem
services]{.underline}, [**[disruption]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [cycles of [water]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[nitrogen]{.mark} and [phosphates]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark}
changes in]{.underline} the dynamics of [[plant]{.mark} and animal
[health]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bélanger & Pilling, 2019). [Crossing this
planetary boundary is **already**]{.underline} [having
**severe**]{.underline} [implications for global **food
security**]{.underline}, including loss of soil fertility and
insect-mediated pollination (Diaz et al., 2019).

[Systems for]{.underline} the [production and allocation of food
are]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}** [enduring **significant
stress**]{.underline}. The [sources]{.underline} of stress [include
climate change]{.underline}, [soil erosion]{.underline}, [water
scarcity]{.underline}, [and **phosphorus**]{.underline}
[depletion]{.underline}. [The natural resource base]{.underline},
[**[arable land]{.underline}** [and freshwater]{.underline}]{.mark}
[upon which food production rely [are]{.mark} being
**[degraded]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While [global food
**productivity**]{.underline} and production [has increased]{.underline}
dramatically over the past century to meet rising demand from an
expanding global population and rising standard of living, these
[constraints]{.underline} and risks [are increasing]{.underline} the
[vulnerability of our **global** food supply]{.underline} to rapid and
global disruptions that could constitute global catastrophes (Baum,
Denkenberger, Pearce, Robock, & Winkler, 2015).

[[Climate change will]{.mark} **further reduce**]{.underline} [food
security in]{.underline} at least [three]{.underline} interconnected
[ways]{.underline}. [First, it will affect **growing
conditions**]{.underline}, [including direct threats to agricultural
yields from **heat**]{.underline}, **[humidity]{.underline}**, [and
**precipitation**]{.underline} in many regions; [although]{.underline}
**[initially]{.underline}** [improving conditions in some]{.underline}
(Lott, Christidis, & Stott, 2013). [Second]{.underline}, [it will
[increase]{.mark} the range of [agricultural **pests and
diseases**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Harvell et al., 2002).
[Third]{.underline}, it will increase the occurrence of [extreme weather
events]{.underline} that [impair the integrity of food production and
distribution]{.underline} networks, [from production to
harvest]{.underline}, post-harvest, **[transport]{.underline}**,
**[storage]{.underline}**, [and distribution]{.underline}, thereby
[increasing]{.underline} our [vulnerability]{.underline} and exposure
[to **supply shocks**]{.underline} (Bailey et al., 2015). The IPCC
estimates, with medium confidence, that at around 2 °C of global warming
the risk from permafrost degradation and food supply instabilities will
be 'very high', while at around 3 °C of global warming the risk from
vegetation loss, wildfire damage, and dryland water scarcity will also
be very high (Arneth et al., 2019). Very few studies have considered the
impacts of 4 °C of global warming or more; however, the IPCC highlighted
one study finding that any potential agricultural gains from climate
change will be lost by this point and there could be a decrease of 19 %
in maize yields and 68 % in bean yields in Africa, an 8 % reduction in
yields in South Asia, and a substantial negative impact on fisheries by
2050 (Porter et al., 2014). Furthermore, multiple extreme weather events
could disrupt food distribution networks (Bailey and Wellesley, 2017).

[While there are opportunities to **adapt**]{.underline}, [disruption to
the entire global food system **cannot be resolved**]{.underline} [via
food aid **alone**]{.underline}. Indeed, [there is the potential for
**isolationist**]{.underline} or [heavy-handed responses that would do
more harm than good]{.underline}. Given the high degree of
interconnectivity and feedback within the global food system, our
initial research suggests that any one of these climate change effects
could trigger scenarios that would critically undermine the global food
system's ability to meet the minimum nutrition for well-being; making
food security for all an unachievable goal, let alone rise to the
challenge of continuing to grow (A. Tzachor, 2019, 2020); this would
constitute what Kuhlemann (2019) terms a 'threshold of significance.'

3.2.2. The global political system

[Disrupting the global food system can]{.underline} create and
[exacerbate conflict and **state failure**]{.underline} (Brinkman &
Hendrix, 2011). However, once again, [this needs to be seen against the
backdrop of a global political system **under stress**]{.underline},
[with climate change as a **significant contributing
factor.**]{.underline} [Climate change influences political
systems]{.underline} in many ways, from being a locus of activism and a
stimulus for reform to [driving rising **inequality**]{.underline} [and
population **displacement**]{.underline} (Arneth et al., 2019;
Diffenbaugh & Burke, 2019). This is not a new phenomenon, [changes in
the climate]{.underline} are believed to have [contributed to
**conflict**]{.underline} [between]{.underline} people and [states
**throughout**]{.underline} [human history]{.underline}, [driven by
resource scarcity, population displacement, and inequality]{.underline}
(Lee, 2009; Mach et al., 2019). As part of a comprehensive risk
assessment of climate change, King et al. (2015) conducted an extensive
literature review on climate change and conflict and used this to inform
a series of international wargaming exercises. These found that climate
change is expected to increase international conflict while highlighting
the role that population displacement, state failure, and water and food
insecurity would play in this (see also Mach et al., 2019; Natalini,
Jones, & Bravo, 2015).

Quantitative studies of the impact of climate change on violence and
conflict have provided more mixed results. A survey of empirical studies
by Detges (2017) found that there may be multiple differing trends:
extreme weather events appear to have more significant effects on
violence than do long-term climate trends, while levels of small-scale
conflict and interpersonal violence appear to be more affected than
large-scale conflicts and international war. [Empirical
studies]{.underline} also [highlight]{.underline} how [climate change's
impact on conflict]{.underline} is predominantly [as a risk **multiplier
and intensifier**]{.underline}. Thus, [climate change may]{.underline}
contribute more by [increas]{.underline}ing [our vulnerability to
**other**]{.underline} [conflict-inducing factors, such as loss of
livelihood, **forced migration**]{.underline}, [environmental change,
and food insecurity]{.underline}, than by acting as a direct cause of
conflict (Abel, Brottrager, Cuaresma, & Muttarak, 2019; Hsiang, Burke, &
Miguel, 2013; Schubert et al., 2008).8

[Of particular relevance]{.underline} to GCR [is the effect of climate
change on the risk of **nuclear war**]{.underline} (Parthemore, Femia, &
Werrell, 2018). However, to our knowledge, this has never been
rigorously assessed, although the potential is certainly there. [One
recent model]{.underline} of the risk of nuclear war [highlighted
how]{.underline} varied, and **[common]{.underline}**, [incidents with
the potential to trigger a nuclear exchange are]{.underline} (Baum, de
Neufville, & Barrett, 2018). [It outlined 14 different **causal
pathways**]{.underline} [to an exchange]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} the **[escalation]{.underline}** [of
conventional wars and international crises]{.underline}, **[human
error]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} the [emergence of new non-state
actors]{.underline}. For all but two of these, they identify historical
examples of potentially precipitating incidents, with 60 incidents in
total (i.e. a little less than one a year). This suggests that [the
[absence of nuclear war was less due to]{.mark} a [lack of]{.mark}
potential **[causes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[tan the]{.mark} global
[political system's ability to **defuse** them]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Thus, [the]{.underline} real [significance of [climate change]{.mark}
may be its capacity to **[undermine]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[this
system]{.underline}]{.mark}: [the combination of
**[social]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[political]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[and [**environmental** disruption]{.mark}]{.underline}, [a lingering
sense of [global **injustice**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark}
rising [food]{.mark}, [water]{.mark}, [and energy
**insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline} [could
[increase]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[probability]{.mark} that [crises
**escalate**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[**[false alarms]{.underline}** [are mistaken for]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[genuine [emergencies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This topic needs further
research.

3.3. The emergence of a global systems death spiral

Yet, we should not conclude that a nuclear exchange is the only, or even
most likely, scenario in which political instability might produce a
global catastrophe. Conflict and political instability, even of moderate
severity, are themselves two of the most significant drivers of
biodiversity loss due to breakdowns in monitoring, governance, and
(public and private) property rights (Baynham-Herd, Amano, Sutherland, &
Donald, 2018). This closes a potentially reinforcing feedback loop
between loss of biosphere integrity, food insecurity and political
breakdown.

[The mechanisms by which]{.underline} these **[cascading
failures]{.underline}** [might spread include]{.underline} many of the
[natural, anthropogenic, and **replicator** effects]{.underline}
identified by Avin et al. (2018), [making them **harder to
contain**]{.underline}. At the natural level, climate change involves
changes to the global atmospheric and biogeochemical systems and poses
other naturally spreading harms, like global ecological collapse. At the
anthropogenic level, the [global interconnectedness of
sociotechnological systems means]{.underline} that [while **small
shocks** are easier to recover from]{.underline}, **[larger
shocks]{.underline}** [can be **harder** to contain and
control]{.underline}. Finally, [**biological** and informational
replication can]{.underline} also [spread]{.underline} the [negative
impacts of climate change]{.underline}, [from **vector-borne
diseases**]{.underline} [and **invasive species**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} climate fatalism and [dangerous
geoengineering]{.underline} technologies.

[Given these **numerous** spread mechanisms]{.underline}, [critical
system failures could precipitate **global catastrophes.**]{.underline}
Furthermore, [the spiral we have explored is **unlikely**]{.underline}
[to be the **only**]{.underline} [set of interlinked systemic
disruptions that climate change could initiate (other death spirals
could involve bio-insecurity and **disease**),]{.underline}
[nor]{.underline} are these [the only]{.underline} causal [connections
between these three systems]{.underline}. Until we understand the nature
of such death spirals better, we must act cautiously. We now turn to
consider what this would mean.

### Renewables Good

#### Renewable energy security staves off a [host of existential threats]{.underline}, otherwise oil and gas lock us into an [unlivable]{.underline} future.

[Instead]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [acquiescing]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} the [demands of the fossil fuel industry]{.underline},
the [[United]{.underline} [States]{.underline} **[must]{.underline}**
[reduce]{.underline}]{.mark} the nation's
[[dependence]{.underline}]{.mark} on oil and gas
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[support]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[rapid
switch to clean energy]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} can [[provide]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[immediate]{.underline}** **[relief]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
[rising energy costs and]{.underline} [unlock]{.underline}]{.mark} more
than \$550 billion in [[investments in]{.mark} climate, [clean
energy]{.mark}, and aid for overburdened communities]{.underline}.
Additionally, the Biden Administration can also strengthen fuel economy
standards that improve the efficiency of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty
cars and trucks (reducing the use of gasoline and diesel) and accelerate
the transition to electric vehicles.3 This will usher in greater energy
and economic security, mitigate the worst effects of the climate crisis,
and protect public health.

INCREASING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION IS NOT THE ANSWER TO HIGH ENERGY
PRICES

There are several problems with the industry's demands. For one thing,
**[it is [not easy to simply increase fuel
production]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It typically takes three to five
years to build a new LNG export terminal.4 Similarly, after drilling
leases for oil and methane gas (also known as natural gas or fossil gas)
are issued, it can take years to explore and develop deposits,
regardless of whether they are beneath federal, state, or private land.5
New or expanded federal leasing and permitting---clearly a top priority
for the industry---would do nothing to boost U.S. oil and gas supplies
in the near term and little in the long term either, as more than 70
percent of our oil and nearly 90 percent of our gas come from state and
private leases.6 [Agreeing to the industry's demands would do nothing to
help the current market situation---and the oil and gas producers know
this]{.underline}.

Moreover, U.S. oil and gas [[prices]{.underline}]{.mark}
[are]{.underline} [[tethered]{.underline} [to a global
market]{.underline}]{.mark} [that is influenced by a variety of factors
that aren't easy to manipulate or predict, [including price shocks from
**war**, **infrastructure** **failures**, **disease**, **weather**, and
**OPEC** supply **decisions**.7]{.mark}]{.underline}

OUR [RELIANCE]{.underline} [ON [FOSSIL FUELS]{.mark} ONLY
[CREATES]{.mark} MORE **[INSTABILITY]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The specifics of API's misinformation aside, increased oil and gas
production is not the answer. The [global]{.underline}
[reliance]{.underline} on oil and gas has **[never]{.underline}**
[made]{.underline} [America, or the world, **safer**]{.underline}.

The United States is the world's largest producer of oil and gas---and a
net exporter of both, meaning that we export more than we import.8 But
the [significant [increase in oil and gas production
domestically]{.mark} over the last decade has [not]{.mark}
[insulated]{.mark} us [from]{.mark} the
**[volatility]{.mark}**]{.underline} we have seen [in fossil fuel
prices]{.underline}. In fact, [as]{.underline} [the [United States has
become]{.mark} a major exporter of fossil fuels, we have become more
**[exposed]{.mark}** and **vulnerable** to]{.underline} the [dramatic
price swings of the global gas and oil markets.]{.underline}

**[[Instability]{.underline}]{.mark}** caused by
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
fossil **[[fascists]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and sudden changes in
supply has historically [led to major jumps]{.underline} and falls in
the price of oil and gas (Figure 1).9 Moreover, [those]{.underline} very
[commodities]{.underline} [are]{.underline} [drivers]{.underline} of
**[[armed]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**:
Between one-quarter and one-half of wars between nations since 1973 have
been linked to oil.10 [[Oil and gas do not provide stability]{.mark}, no
matter how much we produce.]{.underline}

\*\*\*FIGURE EXCLUDED\*\*\*

At the same time, global [[fossil fuel dependence means a reliance
on]{.underline}]{.mark}, and tacit support of, autocratic petro-states
like **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Russia gets 36 percent of its
federal budget from oil and gas exports and is now using that money [[to
finance its military aggression]{.mark}, attack its neighbors, and
[**disrupt** **global** **security**]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 The best
way to stop autocrats who sell oil and gas to pay for war is to stop
using those fuels.

Amid this **[global]{.underline}** **[unrest]{.underline}**, it's the
oil and gas companies that reap the rewards. [Oil and gas
companies]{.underline} were [making]{.underline} [enormous]{.underline}
[profits]{.underline} [prior to the invasion of
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [these]{.underline}
[[returns]{.underline}]{.mark} are only
**[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[as]{.mark} [geopolitics]{.mark}
and world events continue [driving up the price of oil and
gas]{.mark}]{.underline}.12 Those record profits benefit the small
number of people who own oil and gas company stocks, leaving the rest of
us with higher prices at the pump and higher electricity bills at home.
In addition, the climate crisis---driven primarily by greenhouse gas
emissions released when producing and burning fossil fuels---is already
here.13 One need look no farther than the latest newspapers filled with
accounts of fires and floods to see the urgent need to move past fossil
fuels and transition to clean energy. In February 2022, the United
Nations released its latest report on the rising costs and
**[[mounting]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[dangers]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that [**[climate]{.underline}** **[change]{.underline}**]{.mark} is
inflicting on the world's people, **[[natural]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
**[[critical]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**.14 The report is a
high-definition map of **[global]{.underline}**
**[[misery]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with rates of
**[[disease]{.underline}]{.mark}** and death rising;
**[[crops]{.underline}]{.mark}** and [**[livestock]{.underline}**
**[stricken]{.underline}**; **[social progress
constrained]{.underline}**]{.mark}; **[[economic growth
hampered]{.underline}]{.mark}**; and **[[forests]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[coral reefs]{.mark},]{.underline}** and other essential
**[[ecosystems]{.underline}]{.mark}** and species
**[[stressed]{.underline}]{.mark}**, often [to the [brink of
**extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But [we can curtail these dangers by dramatically and immediately
reducing fossil fuel usage]{.underline}. Americans understand this: Some
69 percent support taking steps to become carbon neutral by 2050 and
prioritizing the development of alternative energy sources over fossil
fuels.15

\*\*\*IMAGE EXCLUDED\*\*\*

WE MUST TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS

Here's the bottom line: [The [only]{.mark} real [solution is]{.mark} to
get [away from oil and gas and move to]{.mark} a **[clean energy

Methane gas is consumed across the U.S. economy, serving as the largest

buildings.16 The vast majority of oil is made into gasoline and diesel
fuel to power our vehicles. The solutions for reducing our dependence on
these fossil fuels--- **[[renewable]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Hydrogen Impacts

#### Lowering [hydrogen costs]{.underline} ensures [microgrid effectiveness]{.underline}\-\--conventional renewables are [intermittent]{.underline} and [unstable]{.underline}.

**Reshef '21** \[Rami; December 2; B.A. in Finance, Tel Aviv University,
CEO, Gen Cell Energy; Energy Network Media Group, "Microgrids matter:
How Hydrogen can Respond to Crisis,"
https://shalemag.com/microgrids-matter-how-hydrogen-can-respond-to-crisis/\]

If world leaders are to stand a chance of reaching net-zero targets and
the ambitious goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, then sustainable
energy sources must be made more accessible and affordable. This is a
sentiment that we have heard repeatedly over the past few years, but
COP26 has once again raised the urgency of the need to look to
alternative energy solutions. Indeed, one of the key achievements of the
summit in Glasgow was the 'breakthrough agenda,' which pledges to make
renewable energy sources more widely available across the globe. [[As
nations]{.underline}]{.mark} look to [increase the
**[deploy]{.mark}**ment of **[clean tech]{.mark}**nologies,
[cracking]{.mark} green [**hydrogen** will be
**crucial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's already being touted as a way to
reduce carbon emissions in a range of areas and will be particularly
pertinent [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} those
[**[hard-to-decarb]{.mark}**onize]{.underline} sub-[[sectors,
including]{.underline}]{.mark} telecoms, [remote utilities, **[long-haul
transport]{.mark}**ation [and **industrial**]{.mark}
processes.]{.underline}

However, to bring innovative hydrogen technologies to market quicker,
there needs to be a focus on smaller and sector-specific initiatives as
well as enhancing utility-grade production for large-scale networks.
These projects are not only more economical and quicker to deploy, but
they provide a great opportunity to trial and ultimately scale
solutions. Enter **[[microgrids]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
[[represent the **perfect**]{.mark} environment in which to
**[test]{.mark}** new]{.underline} clean power [generation]{.underline}
technology upfront. 

Going micro 

Microgrids can operate autonomously from the traditional grid, and this
disconnection means they can solve a variety of challenges. These
include relieving pressure on overworked grids, especially during peak
times of use or during extreme weather when electricity consumption is
highest, building capacity to meet future energy demands, reducing
overall energy costs and meeting compliance with environmental
legislation. Energy resiliency, in particular, is one of the central
reasons that this business model is becoming increasingly popular. 

Given that power outages are still a pressing issue in many parts of the
world (a problem that is being exacerbated by rapid climate change),
having a local energy grid, or 'microgrid,' that can operate
independently of the traditional grid is appealing. In areas such as
North and South America, where frequent severe weather incidents can
bring down grid power for extended lengths of time, microgrids are not
only being trialed for emergency backup power but also as a
mainstream primary power source for some remote communities. 

[**[Micro]{.mark}**grid[**s** are **growing**]{.mark} in popularity [and
are]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[focused on]{.underline}]{.mark}
leveraging [[**renewable** energy]{.underline}]{.mark} resources [such
as **sun**, **wind** and **hydro**-energy.
[However]{.mark}]{.underline}, to ensure reliable, uninterrupted power,
[**[micro]{.mark}**grid[**s** require **constant** power, which
**cannot** depend]{.mark} up[on **intermittent**
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. Therefore, [they need]{.underline} to
incorporate [energy **storage** that can **kick in**]{.underline} when
intermittent resources are not available. Traditionally, backup power
has been supplied by fossil fuel generators, but today the world is
seeking cleaner and more reliable alternatives. [Batteries]{.underline}
are one solution, but they too [have **limit**ation**s** around **how
long** they can operate for, their **deterioration** over
time]{.underline} and the need for them to be properly disposed of at
their end of life. [This is where **hydrogen**]{.underline}-powered fuel
[**cells** and generation come in]{.underline}. 

As a modular and scalable technology, hydrogen fuel cells can be added
to the microgrid as energy demands grow. Unlike solar and wind farms
that require large areas of land, fuel cells are significantly easier to
install in urban environments. Producing zero emissions, almost no noise
and no vibrations, fuel cells can sit outside or inside a building. So,
in the event of severe weather, [**fuel cells** can be placed within
**protected** environments to ensure that there is no **disruption** to
emergency power]{.underline}. The modern fuel cell, powered by
[[hydrogen, can]{.mark} thus [serve as a **lynchpin** to]{.mark} improve
both the **[reliability]{.mark}** of microgrids in areas [where]{.mark}
the [grid is **unstable**]{.mark} and boost the grids'
**sustainability**]{.underline} credentials. As the hydrogen economy is
being rapidly built out around the world, hydrogen fuel is becoming more
available, regulations and safety measures governing the deployment of
hydrogen are expanding, and the price of hydrogen is coming down, all of
which make hydrogen fuel cells a more attractive energy source.

Responding to crisis 

Extreme weather threatens our energy stability, so we need to be
well-equipped to ensure that power is maintained at all times.
[Hydrogen]{.underline} fuel cells [can complement **d**istributed
**e**nergy **r**esource**s**]{.underline} (DERs) [by [offering]{.mark} a
**[reliable]{.mark}** source for [**long-duration** backup power]{.mark}
when grids are unavailable or **unstable**]{.underline}, both during
unplanned outages and during peak power demand. More frequent extreme
weather patterns, such as storms and wildfires, which interfere with the
ability to propagate and maintain the traditional centralized energy
model, are only serving to encourage the transition to DERs and
microgrids. 

The DER model incorporates several sources of power generation,
including renewable sources such as hydrogen. Hydrogen fuel cells can
kick in immediately and provide long-duration power availability. Beyond
generating clean power, they also play a role in energy storage and
regulating power flow, making them an effective component for
microgrids. Incorporating hydrogen fuel cells into local microgrids for
long-duration backup power is fast becoming an incredibly viable and
sustainable solution to mitigating the devastating impact of outages.
This growing use case presents a great opportunity to trial and scale
these solutions. 

California is no stranger to severe weather events and increasingly
suffers from devastating wildfires each year. These wildfires result in
both unplanned outages due to fire damage, as well as deliberate
shutdowns for preventative maintenance aimed at avoiding unplanned
outages. This year, the Californian legislature has passed the SB341
Bill, mandating telecommunications operators to provide backup power for
72 hours. This new bill is not only great for ensuring effective
disaster response, but it's also an opportunity for this sector to play
a part in mitigating against the impacts of climate change --- here,
too, hydrogen fuel cells can play a significant role in enabling the
mandatory long-duration backup power. 

Given the escalation of climate crises that we have seen over the past
several years, utilities are now recognizing the value that
[**hydrogen** technologies]{.underline} in microgrids can offer. They
[[empower]{.mark} the [**industry** to respond to grid
**instability**]{.mark}]{.underline} and peak demands, [as well as
encourage the **transition** away from **fossil fuels**]{.underline} to
clean energy sources. As world leaders and climate activists stress the
need to implement and scale renewable energy solutions such as hydrogen
quicker, distributed local power models involving microgrids are the
perfect way to trial these solutions and test their capabilities at a
macro-scale.

#### Microgrids prevent [existential]{.underline} blackouts and [nuclear war]{.underline} with Russia, China, Iran

[**Russia**, **China**, North **Korea**, other [hostile

[target]{.mark}]{.underline} an individual [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}
State [for **[EMP]{.mark}**]{.underline} or cyber-[[blackout as]{.mark}
a [**demonstration** of]{.mark} their [**power** and]{.mark} to [coerce
**Washington** into surrender]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, in
April 2021, during the previous big crisis between [Russia]{.underline}
versus the U.S. and NATO over Ukraine, Moscow's state-run TV
[broadcast]{.underline} to the world [that: "[War is
**inevitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}...it will be a Cyber War." Florida
and its electric grid were specifically threatened with a state-wide
blackout, [to **deter** the U.S. from helping **Ukraine**]{.underline}.
In January 2022, during the current international crisis over Ukraine, a
member of the Russian Duma (equivalent to U.S. Congress) proposed
warning Washington that [Moscow is **serious** about **nuclear
war**]{.underline} over Ukraine---[by [launching]{.mark} a
**[hypersonic]{.mark}** warhead [to detonate on]{.mark}]{.underline} or
over [the [**Nevada** nuclear **test area**]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[could blackout]{.underline}]{.mark} Nevada, Colorado or [the
[**entire** Western Grid]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Protection for the State of Colorado

[[An]{.underline}]{.mark} electromagnetic pulse [(**[EMP]{.mark}**) from
a solar superstorm or nuclear or non-nuclear weapon [poses an
**existential threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} to the people of the United
States and the citizens of Colorado:

--[A rare but **[inevitable]{.mark}** solar superstorm]{.underline},
like the 1859 [[**Carrington Event**, can blackout]{.mark} electric
**[grids]{.mark}**]{.underline} and life-sustaining critical
infrastructures [[worldwide, putting **at risk**]{.mark} the lives of
**[billions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. NASA estimates the likelihood of
recurrence of another Carrington Event is 12% per decade.

--[[**Russia**, **China**, and]{.mark} North **[Korea]{.mark}** all
[have]{.mark} capability to make a **[nuclear EMP]{.mark}**
attack]{.underline} against the United States, [[and]{.mark} all have
[**plans to do so** as part of]{.mark} their military
**[doctrine]{.mark}**]{.underline} for Cyber Warfare.
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the world's leading sponsor of
international terrorism, [is nearing]{.underline} the capability to make
**[[nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}**lear weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
according to some analysts already has nuclear weapons
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the capability to make a
**[[nucl]{.underline}]{.mark}**ear **[[EMP]{.underline}]{.mark}**
attack, which is also part of Iran's military doctrine for Cyber
Warfare.

--[[**Non-nuclear** EMP]{.mark} weapons]{.underline}, also called
Radio-Frequency Weapons, [[are]{.mark} readily **[available]{.mark}**,
can be [made]{.mark}]{.underline} or purchased [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
terrorists, **[[criminals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or unstable
individuals, [and used to **blackout** electric **grids**]{.underline}.

--The Congressional EMP Commission found that protecting against the
worst threat---nuclear EMP attack---will mitigate all [[lesser threats,
including]{.underline}]{.mark} solar storms, non-nuclear EMP weapons,
[**[cyber]{.mark}**-attacks, [**physical** sabotage, and **severe
weather**]{.mark} including **hurricanes**]{.underline}. The EMP
Commission recommended following an "all hazards" strategy, protecting
electric grids from EMP and other threats whenever possible.

The Colorado Critical Infrastructure Resiliency Initiative (CCIRI),
which was provided to Govenor Polis and his energy advisors, would
protect the electric grid and other critical infrastructure from all
threats, including devastating nuclear and space weather
Electrormagnetic Pulse (EMP) events, that could damage or destroy the
electrical power grid for months, if not years. Here are the top four
features of the project.

1\. The CCIRI directs the power and utilities to work with the
Department of Defense (DoD) engineering community, that has experience
hardening power grids and allows flexibility for power and utility
companies to recoup their expenses for grid resiliency protection.

2\. Collectively the CCIRI team of power and utility network designers
and Electromagnetic engineering hardening experts will develop a minimal
architecture to achieve 90% Rolling Brown Out (RBO) operational
capability.

3\. CCIRI leverages hundreds of millions of dollars of lessons learned
and proven technologies transferred from the DoD into the civilian
sector.

4\. CCIRI develops the design solutions needed to secure the state's
power generation, transmission, and distribution grid, natural gas
network, water (clean water supply and wastewater treatment) facilities,
and the state's 5g telecommunications network. Meaning real solutions,
hardware maybe even kits\... no studies or discussion groups that to
date have been a waste of time.

Please do everything in your power to make this electrical
infrastructure project a reality.

[[**Microgrid** and home **solar**]{.mark} **systems** [are]{.mark} an
**[important]{.mark}** and quicker solution for many]{.underline} rural
and urban [communities, and [as **backup** to critical infrastructures
for **E**]{.mark}lectro**[m]{.mark}**agnetic **[P]{.mark}**ulse
protection]{.underline}, but only if done right. Some microgrids have
been deployed in Colorado and millions of homeowners in Colorado have
solar but it is not protected from EMP. [The **tech**nology **exists**
to protect these **microgrids** and home **solar systems** from an
EMP]{.underline}. The military has been protecting critical assets and
structues from EMP for many years. Also, one commercial solar company
hardens their systems to or exceeding military EMP protection standards.
On the other hand, microgrids and home solar systems deployed in
Colorado are generally not protected from EMP and homeowners don't know
how to get them protected or even if they can afford to do so. Can the
Governor and state legislators encourage or require solar companies to
protect their existing and new solar systems from EMP? [[EMP threat
is]{.mark} a [**clear** and **imminent**]{.mark} danger and
[protecting]{.mark} existing **[microgrid]{.mark}**]{.underline} and

### Demand Increasing

**Yes demand increase**

**Kindig 24** -- CEO and Lead Tech Analyst for the I/O Fund and delivers
weekly in-depth tech stock analysis

Beth Kindig, "AI Power Consumption: Rapidly Becoming Mission-Critical,"

[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/06/20/ai-power-consumption-rapidly-becoming-mission-critical/]{.underline}](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/06/20/ai-power-consumption-rapidly-becoming-mission-critical/)

[As a result of **booming demand** for generative AI and for
GPUs]{.underline}, **[[AI's electricity demand is forecast to
surge]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially in the data center. [We have a
handful of [different]{.mark} viewpoints and [analyst
projections]{.mark} that]{.underline}, [while differing slightly in the
timelines]{.underline}, [[all point to that]{.mark} **same
[conclusion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For example, Morgan Stanley is estimating global [[data center power use
will **triple this year**]{.underline}]{.mark}, from \~15 TWh in 2023
[to \~46 TWh in 2024]{.underline}. This coincides with the ramp of
Nvidia's Blackwell chip later in the year as well as utilization of the
entirety of its deployed Hopper GPUs, and increased shipments from AMD
and custom silicon ramps from Big Tech.

Morgan Stanley also projects [[generative AI]{.mark} power demand may
exceed 2022's data center power usage by 2027]{.underline} if GPU
utilization rates are high, at \~90% on average; however, [their base
case still [calls for a]{.mark} **nearly [5x increase]{.mark}** in power
demand [over]{.mark} the next **[three years]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Wells Fargo is projecting [AI]{.mark} power [demand]{.mark} to **[surge
550% by 2026]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [from 8 TWh in 2024 to 52
TWh]{.underline}, [[before]{.mark} rising **[another 1,150%]{.mark}** to
652 TWh **[by 2030]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This is]{.mark} a
**remarkable [8,050% growth]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} their [2024]{.mark}
projected level]{.underline}. AI training is expected to drive the bulk
of this demand, at 40 TWh in 2026 and 402 TWh by 2030, with inference's
power demand accelerating at the end of the decade. In this model, the
652 TWh projection is more than 16% of the current total electricity
demand in the US.

The Electric Power Research Institute forecasts that [[data centers may
see]{.underline}]{.mark} their [electricity [consumption]{.mark} **more
than [double by 2030]{.mark}**]{.underline}, reaching 9% of total
electricity demand in the US. [The IEA is projecting]{.underline} global
electricity [demand]{.underline} from AI, data centers and crypto [to
rise to 800 TWh in 2026]{.underline} in its base case scenario, [a
**nearly 75% increase**]{.underline} from 460 TWh in 2022. [The agency's
**high case scenario** calls for demand to **more than double** to 1,050
TWh]{.underline}.

Arm's executives also see data center demand rising significantly: CEO
Rene Haas said that without improvements in efficiency, \"[by the end of
the decade]{.underline}, [AI data centers could consume as much as 20%
to 25% of U.S. power requirements]{.underline}. [Today
that's]{.underline} probably [4% or less]{.underline}.\" CMO Ami Badani
reiterated Haas' view that that [[data centers could account for **25%
of**]{.mark} **US [power consumption]{.mark} [by 2030]{.mark}** based on
surging demand for AI chatbots and AI training]{.underline}.

**U.S. data center demand will surge 160%. That\'s never happened.**

**Goldman Sachs 24**

"AI is poised to drive 160% increase in data center power demand,"
Goldman Sachs, 05-14-2024,
[[https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand]{.underline}](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/AI-poised-to-drive-160-increase-in-power-demand)

On average, [a [ChatGPT]{.mark} query [needs]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly
[**[10 times]{.mark} as much electricity** to process as [a Google
search]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[In that]{.mark} difference [lies a
**coming sea change** in how the US]{.mark}]{.underline}, Europe, and
the world at large [[will **consume power**]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
[[and **how much that will cost**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

For years, data centers displayed a remarkably stable appetite for
power, even as their workloads mounted. Now, [[as the]{.mark} pace of
efficiency gains in electricity use slows and the **[AI revolution
gathers steam]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Goldman Sachs Research estimates
that [data center [power demand will grow **160% by
2030**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

At present, data centers worldwide consume 1-2% of overall power, but
this percentage will likely rise to 3-4% by the end of the decade. In
the US and Europe, this increased [demand will help drive]{.underline}
the kind of [electricity growth [that hasn't been seen in a
**generation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Along the way, the carbon dioxide
emissions of data centers may more than double between 2022 and 2030.

development of courses of action in a conflict, thus improving its
overall capabilities in the nuclear space and [reducing]{.mark} the
[risk of unintended]{.mark} [escalation]{.mark} in the midst of a crisis
with a nuclear dimension.]{.underline}

[In a nuclear exchange, national [leadership]{.mark} [may have **just
minutes**]{.mark} to **assess a situation** and determine whether to
launch its own nuclear response]{.underline}. [Nuclear weapons states
such as the United States have sought to **increase** this
**decision-making time** to reduce the potential for misunderstanding or
**miscalculation** in a crisis]{.underline}, given the immense
consequences of using nuclear weapons.21 [**[Incorporating AI into early
warning]{.mark}** and decision-making analysis may [improve]{.mark} both
the [**speed** and **quality**]{.mark} [of]{.mark} information
[processing]{.mark} as well as eliminate p**otential biase**s from
military leadership, which will be crucial in a crisis [to allow time
for de-**escalation**]{.mark} and **[tension reduction]{.mark}** between
sides]{.underline}

[[AI can]{.mark} similarly [enhance]{.mark} the [ability to
**discriminate**]{.mark} [between **real and false
info**]{.mark}**rmation**, which is critical to preventing
miscalculation or mistake in a crisis]{.underline}. [A number of
"**close calls**" have occurred throughout the years, in which nuclear
weapons use was only avoided through **human intervention** based on
uncertain information]{.underline}.22 In 1983, NATO undertook Command
Post Exercise Able Archer to "practice command and staff procedures,
with particular emphasis on the transition from conventional to
non-conventional operations, including the use of nuclear weapons." 23
At the time, Soviet paranoia about a US nuclear first strike, with
preparations under cover of a war game, was at an alltime high. When
NATO began its Able Archer exercise, Soviet officials thought the
exercise was real and put mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs) on a three-minute alert.24 [The same year, the Soviet early
warning computer system signaled **five incoming US Minuteman ICBMs**.
The watch officer on duty, Soviet Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov, did not
report the incident, concluding that it must be a false
alarm.]{.underline} [If he had reported that US nuclear missiles were
inbound, the Soviets would have followed their nuclear doctrine and
retaliated with no time to double-check or negotiate]{.underline} with
the United States.25 Petrov ultimately made the right call---as the
Soviet early warning system had mistaken sun shining off clouds for
incoming missiles.

Even after the end of the Cold War, in 1995, a Norwegian civilian
research rocket launch was detected by the radar crews from the Russian
Missile Attack Warning System (MAWS) and mistaken for a US Trident II
submarinelaunched ballistic missile. Command and control procedures were
enacted, including notification of President Boris Yeltsin and
activation of the Russian "cheget" system---essentially its nuclear
football. Russian authorities eventually determined that this was not a
nuclear-armed ballistic missile launch after reviewing satellite and
other intelligence information.26

While these and other incidents were ultimately resolved successfully
through the intervention of military experts and political leaders,27
they illustrate the dangers of imperfect systems that rely on human
analysts with potentially inaccurate or inadequate information. [As
defense researcher Jaganath Sankaran argues, "future applications of AI
to nuclear command and control should aspire to create an algorithm that
could argue in the face of overwhelming fear of an impending attack that
a nuclear launch isn't happening]{.underline}." 28 [Such an [approach
could]{.mark} both **[reduce]{.mark} the [fog of war]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[reassure decision-makers]{.mark}** that their course of
action is correct in the face of uncertain information, either using
nuclear weapons or refraining from it.]{.underline}

[Although most nuclear-armed nations now use multiple systems to reduce
the chances of a false positive warning signal, [advancements]{.mark} in
AI [could]{.mark} significantly [improve **confidence**]{.mark} in [and
**functionality**]{.mark} of these systems [when integrated with]{.mark}
**human [decision-making]{.mark}**]{.underline}. AI tools could play a
significant role in helping to identify patterns of life and reduce
potential operator biases in conducting analysis. For instance, [in
order to be able [to]{.mark} quickly [**discriminate** between]{.mark} a
country's launch of a sounding/**[research rocket]{.mark}** [as
**opposed to an ICBM**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which have very similar
radar signatures, [big data analytical tools could be used to collate
and process massive amounts of electronic data---including signals,
imagery, and open source collection---over time to [identify **patterns
of behavior**]{.mark} unique to each type of launch]{.underline}. [Then,
if there is an ambiguous or unexpected launch, these systems would be
able to quickly determine whether or not the current circumstances more
closely resemble one type of launch over the
other]{.underline}---actually preventing future close calls or
misinterpretations of data, as occurred in Able Archer in 1983. A human
analyst would likely still need to make a final determination, but
[through the use of AI and data analytics, they would have a more
accurate, timely, and complete picture on which to base any
decisions.]{.underline}

[Similarly]{.underline}, [these]{.underline} same types of [[tools
might]{.mark} **eventually** be able to discern and
**[discriminate]{.mark}** [between **nuclear and conventional
weapons**]{.mark} systems in an incoming
attac]{.underline}k---[preventing the risk of **unintended escalation**
in a conflict between nuclear armed adversaries]{.underline}. [More
countries are developing dual-capable missile
systems]{.underline}---that is, missiles that can carry either
conventional or nuclear warheads on the same missile airframe---[which a
country on the receiving end would not be able to distinguish between
until it detonates on the ground]{.underline}. [**AI** may be able to
**[quickly assess]{.mark}** such **[technical information]{.mark}** as
telemetry and flight trajectory [to determine]{.mark} [whether]{.mark}
the [payload is **nuclear**]{.mark} **or conventional**.]{.underline}
[Alternately]{.underline}, "[pattern of life" analysis---that is,
regular monitoring of activities and behaviors through intelligence so
that anomalies can be quickly and easily identified]{.underline}---[may
reveal signs in advance of a [launch]{.mark} that [would signal]{.mark}
the **[type of warhead]{.mark}** on the missile system,
[enabling]{.mark} military [officials to **calibrate responses**]{.mark}
in a crisis]{.underline}. [Either way, big data analytical systems could
cull through large quantities of ISR, open source, and other sensor data
to mitigate problems with single data sources or sensor
malfunction]{.underline}---[and do so within the timelines necessary in
a wartime environment, where there will be **imprecise information**,
**short timelines**, and **chaos** in the information
space.]{.underline}

[[AI]{.mark}-enabled [systems might]{.mark} also be critical to
[fuse]{.mark} various [forms of data]{.mark} that are individually
ambiguous]{.underline}, [but, when synthesized quickly enough,
collectively indicate that a missile has in fact been
launched]{.underline}. Jason Matheny, a member of the National Security
Commission on AI, notes that this is particularly important for
"[different scenarios [where]{.mark} [you may not have a]{.mark}
**definitive [warning]{.mark}** [from a **single
sensor**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And particularly as missile designs are
meant to evade certain classes of missile warning systems, we're going
to have to use some form of sensor fusion that's AI enabled in order to
alert the human operator that a missile has likely been
launched]{.underline}." 29

Imperil Nuclear Deterrence?\", War on the Rocks,

[While strategists]{.underline} have [generally offered more sober
explorations]{.underline} [of the future relationship]{.underline}
between [AI and nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [some of the most
widely]{.underline} [received musings on the issue,
including]{.underline} a recent call for an AI-enabled "[dead
hand]{.underline}" [to update America's]{.underline} aging [nuclear
command]{.underline}, control, and communications infrastructure, [tend
to obscure]{.underline} more than they illuminate due to an
[insufficient understanding]{.underline} of the [technologies
involved]{.underline}. An appreciation for technical detail, however, is
necessary to arrive at realistic assessments of any new technology, and
particularly consequential where nuclear weapons are concerned. Some
have warned that advances in AI could erode the fundamental logic of
nuclear deterrence by enabling counter-force attacks against heretofore
concealed and mobile nuclear forces. [Such secure second-strike forces
are considered the backbone of effective nuclear deterrence by assuring
retaliation. Were they to become vulnerable to preemption, nuclear
weapons would **lose** their **deterrent value**]{.underline}.

[**We**,]{.underline} however, **[view this concern as
overstated]{.underline}**. [[Because of AI's **inherent
limitations**]{.underline}, [splendid **counter-force**]{.underline}
[will remain **out of reach**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[While
emerging]{.underline} [technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} and nuclear
force [postures [might interact to alter the dynamics]{.mark} of
strategic competition]{.underline}, [**[AI in itself will not
diminish]{.underline}** [the **deterrent value**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [today's]{.underline} **[nuclear
forces]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Understanding the Stability Concern

The exponential growth of sensors and data sources across all
warfighting domains has analysts today facing an overabundance of
information. The Defense Department's Project Maven was born out of this
realization in 2017. With the help of AI, then-Deputy Secretary of
Defense Robert Work sought to "reduce the human factors burden of
\[full-motion video\] analysis, increase actionable intelligence, and
enhance military decision-making" in support of the counter-ISIL
campaign. Hans Vreeland, a former Marine artillery officer involved in
the campaign, recently explained the potential of AI in facilitating
targeted strikes for counterinsurgency operations, arguing that AI
should be recognized and leveraged as a force multiplier, enabling U.S.
forces to do more at higher operational tempo with fewer resources and
less uncertainty. Such a "magic bullet" would surely be welcome as a
great boon to any commander's arsenal.

Yet, some strategists warn that the same AI-infused capabilities that
allow for more prompt and precise strikes against time-critical
conventional targets could also undermine deterrence stability and
increase the risk of nuclear use. Specifically, AI-driven improvements
to intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance would threaten the
survivability of heretofore secure second-strike nuclear forces by
providing technologically advanced nations with the ability to find,
identify, track, and destroy their adversaries' mobile and concealed
launch platforms. Transporter-erector launchers and ballistic missile
submarines, traditionally used by nuclear powers to enhance the
survivability of their deterrent forces, would be at greater risk. A
country that acquired such an exquisite counter-force capability could
not only hope to limit damage in case of a spiraling nuclear crisis but
also negate its adversaries' nuclear deterrence "in one swift blow."
Such an ability would undermine the nuclear deterrence calculus whereby
the costs of imminent nuclear retaliation far outweigh any conceivable
gains from aggression.

These expectations are exaggerated. During the 1991 Gulf War, U.S.-led
coalition forces struggled hard to find, fix, and finish Iraqi Scud
launchers despite overwhelming air and information superiority. Elusive,
time-critical targets still seem to present a problem today. Facing a
nuclear-armed adversary, such poor performance would prove disastrous.
The prospect of just one enemy warhead surviving would give pause to any
decisionmaker contemplating a preemptive counter-force strike. This is
why nuclear weapons are such powerful deterrents after all and states
who possess them go to great lengths to protect these assets. While some
worry that AI could achieve near-perfect performance and thereby enable
an effective counter-force capability, inherent technological
limitations will prevent it from doing so for the foreseeable future. AI
may bring modest improvements in certain areas, but it cannot
fundamentally alter the calculus that underpins deterrence by
punishment.

Enduring Obstacles

[The [limitations AI faces are **twofold**]{.mark}]{.underline}:
**[[poor data]{.mark} and the [inability]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of even
state-of-the-art AI [to **make up for poor data**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Misguided beliefs about what AI can and cannot accomplish further
impede **realistic assessments**]{.underline}.

[The data used for training and **operationalizing**]{.underline}
automated [**[image-recognition]{.underline}** [algorithms suffers from
**multiple shortcomings**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Training an AI to
recognize objects of interest among other **objects requires prelabeled
datasets**]{.underline} [with both **positive** and **negative
examples**]{.underline}. [While pictures of commercial trucks are
abundant, [much fewe]{.mark}r **ground-truth
[pictures]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of mobile missile **launchers**
are]{.underline} **[available]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [In addition to
the ground-truth pictures potentially not representing]{.underline} [all
launcher models]{.underline}, [this data imbalance in itself is
**consequential**]{.underline}. [To increase its accuracy with training
data that includes fewer launchers than images of other vehicles, the AI
would be incentivized to **[produce false
negatives]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by misclassifying]{.mark} mobile
[launchers as **non-launcher vehicles**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Synthetic]{.underline}, e.g., manually [warped]{.underline},
[variations of missile-launcher images could be
**included**]{.underline} [to identify launchers that would otherwise go
**undetected**]{.underline}. This would increase the number of false
positives, however, because now trucks that resemble synthetic launchers
would be misclassified.

[Moreover, images are a **poor representation**]{.underline}
**[of]{.underline}** **[reality]{.underline}**. [Whereas humans can
infer the function of an object from its external
characteristics]{.underline}, **[AI still struggles]{.underline}** [to
do so. This is not so much an issue where an object's
**form**]{.underline} [is meant to inform about its
**function**]{.underline}, [like in handwriting or speech recognition.
But a vehicle's structure does **not necessarily inform**]{.underline}
[about its function]{.underline} --- [a problem for an AI tasked with
differentiating between **vehicles**]{.underline} [that carry and launch
nuclear-armed ballistic missiles and those that do not]{.underline}.
Pixilated, [two-dimensional images are not only a **poor
representation**]{.underline} [of a vehicle's **function**]{.underline},
[but also of the three-dimensional **object itself**]{.underline}. Even
though resolution can be increased and a three-dimensional
representation constructed from images taken from different angles, this
introduces the "curse of dimensionality." With greater resolution and
dimensional complexity, the number of discernable features increases,
thus requiring exponentially more memory and running time for an AI to
learn and analyze. AI's inability to discard unimportant features
further makes similar pictures seem increasingly dissimilar and vice
versa.

[[Could]{.mark} clever]{.underline}, high-powered **[[AI
compensate]{.underline}]{.mark}** for these data deficiencies?
**[[Machine-learning theory suggests not]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [When
designing algorithms]{.underline}, [AI researchers face **trade-offs**.
[Data describing **real-world problems**]{.mark}, particularly those
that pertain to **human interactions**, [are]{.mark} always
[**incomplete** and **imperfect**]{.mark}. Accordingly]{.underline},
[researchers must specify **which patterns AI is to
learn**]{.underline}. [Intuitively it might seem reasonable for an
algorithm to learn all patterns]{.underline} present in a particular
data set, but [many of these]{.underline} patterns [will represent
random events]{.underline} and noise or be the product of selection
bias. [Such an [AI]{.mark} could also fail]{.underline}
**[catastrophically]{.underline}** [when encountering **new
data**]{.underline}. In turn[, if an algorithm learns only
the]{.underline} [**strongest patterns**, it may
[perform]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[poorly]{.underline}**]{.mark} ---
although not catastrophically --- [[on any **one
image**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consequently, [attempts to **improve an
AI's performance**]{.underline} by reducing bias generally [increase
variance and vice versa]{.underline}. Additionally, while any tool can
serve as a hammer, few will do a very good job at hammering. Likewise,
no one algorithm can outperform all others on all possible problem sets.
Neural networks are not universally better than decision trees, for
example. Because there is an infinite number of design choices, there is
no way to identify the best possible algorithm. And with new data, a
heretofore near-perfect algorithm might no longer be the best choice.
Invariably, some error is irreducible.

Nevertheless, **[tailoring improves AI performance]{.underline}**.
Regarding image recognition, [intimate knowledge of the object to be
detected allows for greater]{.underline} [specification]{.underline},
**[yielding higher accuracy]{.underline}**. On the counter-force
problem, [however]{.underline}, a priori [knowledge is not easily
obtained]{.underline}; it [is likely to be neither clean
nor]{.underline} [concise]{.underline}. As discussed above, because
function cannot be fully represented in an image, [it cannot be fully
**learned by the AI**]{.underline}. Moreover, like most military
affairs, counter-force is a contested and dynamic problem. Adversaries
will attempt to conceal their mobile-missile launchers or change their
design to fool AI-enabled ISR capabilities. They could also try to
poison AI training data to induce misclassification. This is
particularly problematic because of the one-off nature of a
counter-force strike, which prevents validating AI performance with
real-world experience. [Simulations can only get AI so far]{.underline}.

[When it comes to **AI**,]{.underline} [[near-perfect performance is
tied]{.mark} **inextricably [to operating]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in
**environments**]{.underline} [that are predictable, even
**controlled**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The counter-force challenge is
anything but. Facing such a complex and dynamic problem set, AI would be
constrained to lower levels of confidence. Sensor platforms would
provide an abundance of imagery and modern precision-guided munitions
could be expected to eliminate designated targets, but automated image
recognition could not guarantee the detection of all relevant targets.

#### AI innovation solves extinction---it's a [better decision-maker]{.underline} than humans

Michigan online library) wtk

A threat even more dire than misinformation is the "risk of extinction
from AI" that the Center for AI Safety highlights in its open statement.
Yet, [[in terms of whether machines or humans are more likely to
initiate extinction]{.mark}-level events such as nuclear
war]{.underline}, [[humans]{.mark}]{.underline} still seem to [[have the
upper hand]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In recent empirical work that
analyzes]{.underline} the decision processes employed by senior leaders
in [war-game scenarios]{.underline} involving weapons of mass
destruction, **[[humans showed an alarming tendency to err on the side
of initiating catastrophic attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**.Footnote5
[[These]{.mark} simulations, if implemented in reality, [would pose much
graver risks to humanity than machine-driven ones]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Our [exploration]{.mark} of the use of AI in critical decision-making
[has shown **AI's superiority to human decisions**]{.mark} **in nearly
all scenarios**]{.underline}. In most cases, the AI makes the choice
that humans do not make at first---but then, upon more careful
consideration and deliberation, change their minds and do make,
realizing it was the correct decision all along.

[Other]{.underline}, more quotidian [concerns raised about AI apply far
more to human beings than to machines]{.underline}. Consider algorithmic
bias, the phenomenon whereby algorithms involved in hiring decisions,
medical diagnoses, or image detection produce outcomes that unfairly
disadvantage a particular social group. For example, when Amazon
implemented an algorithmic recruiting tool to score new applicants'
resumes, the algorithm systematically rated female applicants worse than
men, in large part because the algorithm was trained on resumes
submitted over the previous 10 years that were disproportionately
male.Footnote6 In other words, [an algorithm trained on human bias will
reproduce this bias.]{.underline}

Unlike humans, [however, [algorithmic bias can be **readily
deprogrammed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or as economist Sendhil
Mullainathan puts it, "[[Biased algorithms are easier to fix than biased
people]{.underline}]{.mark}."Footnote7 Mullainathan and colleagues'
research showed that an algorithm used by UnitedHealth to score
patients' health risks systematically underscored black patients
relative to white patients because it measured illness in terms of
health-care costs (which are systematically lower for black versus white
individuals, given that society spends less on black patients)
(Obermeyer et al. Citation2019). However, once identified, the
researchers could easily modify this feature of the algorithm to produce
risk scores that were relatively unbiased. Other work has shown that
algorithms can produce less racially biased outcomes (and more effective
public safety outcomes) than human judges in terms of decisions about
whether or not to grant bail to defendants awaiting trial (Kleinberg et
al. Citation2018). As biased as algorithms can be, their biases appear
less ingrained and more pliable than those of humans. Compounded by
recent work showing that, in hiring and lending contexts, managers
reject biased algorithms in favor of more biased humans, the suggestion
that humans should remain at the helm of those functions is, at best,
questionable (Cowgill, Dell'acqua, and Matz Citation2020).

Finally, consider the threat to cybersecurity. Although commentators
have warnedFootnote8,Footnote9,Footnote10 that large language models add
tools to the arsenals of hackers by democratizing cybercrime, [most
high-profile information leaks and hacks to date are ushered in by human
beings with no reliance on AI]{.underline} (i.e. a disgruntled employee
who knows the system\'s flaws and perpetrates an attack by remembering
key passwords, or bad programmers who effectively enable future attacks
by making wrong assumptions on their software use-cases---such as "no
one would create a password that is 1,000,000 characters long" leading
to a classical buffer overflow hack). In fact, [[AI is often the last
bastion of defense against]{.mark} those [hacks]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[identifying complex human coding mistakes early-on and correcting
them]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

Recently, national guardsman Jack Teixeira, who exposed highly
classified material in an online chat group, did not require
sophisticated technology to access sensitive documents---he was granted
top secret clearance from the Pentagon. Further, a recent study
conducted by IBM indicates that 95 percent of security breaches were
caused by human errors such as biting on phishing scams or downloading
malware.Footnote11 If anything, the most concerning cybersecurity risk
currently posed by AI results from its increased reliance on human
trained code, which is flawed. AI takes hackable human codes and uses
them to generate new codes, spreading these human-generated errors
further. The only concerning current cybersecurity attacks by AI involve
AI that simulates human communication to dupe humans into revealing key
information. Cybersecurity may represent a case in which technology is
more likely to be the solution rather than the problem, with research
indicating, for example, that humans working with AI outperform humans
alone in detecting machine-manipulated media such as deepfakes (Groh et
al. Citation2021).

[[Even when tech]{.mark}nology [contributes to unwanted outcomes, humans
are]{.mark} often [the ones pressing the buttons]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Consider the effect of AI on unemployment. The Future of Life Institute
letter raises concerns that AI will eliminate jobs, yet whether or not
to eliminate jobs is a choice that humans ultimately make. Just because
AI can perform the jobs of, say, customer service representatives does
not mean that companies should outsource these jobs to bots. In fact,
research indicates that many customers would prefer to talk to a human
than to a bot, even if it means waiting in a queue.Footnote12 Along
similar lines, increasingly common statements that AI-based
systems---like "the Internet," "social media," or the set of
interconnected online functions referred to as "The Algorithm"---are
destroying mental health,Footnote13 causing political
polarization,Footnote14 or threatening democracyFootnote15 neglect an
obvious fact: These systems are populated and run by human beings.
Blaming technology lets people off the hook.

Although expressions of concern toward AI are invaluable in matching the
excitement around new technology with caution, outsized news cycles
around the threats of technology can distract from the threats of human
beings. Recent research indicates that humans have a "finite pool of
attention" such that "when we pay more attention to one threat, our
attention to other threats decreases" (Sisco et al. Citation2023). So,
as we contend with the rise of AI and its concomitant harms to privacy,
human survival, and our relationship with truth itself, we must equally
pay attention to the humans who are already well equipped to perpetrate
these harms without the assistance of machines. Specifically, [it has
not escaped our notice that when engaging in a conversation about the
risks of AI, [the benchmark is often "is AI perfect in handling this
task]{.mark}"]{.underline} (making critical decisions or guiding a
self-driving car), [[rather than "is it better than humans]{.mark}." The
[answer to the latter question in many cases, is that yes, **AI can
mitigate the risks to humanity.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

​

#### No model collapse---the original training set will anchor new models even if they are trained with synthetic data

**Claburn 24** (Thomas Claburn is a senior reporter at The Register.
"Big brains divided over training AI with more AI: Is model collapse
inevitable?" 5/9/2024. Accessed 6/10/2024.

wtk

[[AI model collapse]{.underline}]{.mark} -- the degradation of quality
expected from machine learning models that recursively train on their
own output -- **[[is not inevitable]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at least
according to 14 academics.

The risk that ongoing generative AI output, known as synthetic data,
will dilute human-created organic data and impair the performance of
models trained on this increasingly fabricated corpus was highlighted by
a separate group last year, in a paper titled: \"The Curse of Recursion:
Training on Generated Data Makes Models Forget.\"

Ilia Shumailov, lead author of that paper, spoke to The Register earlier
this year about this phenomenon, which has been documented in other
studies.

Now another set of boffins -- Matthias Gerstgrasser, Rylan Schaeffer,
Apratim Dey, Rafael Rafailov, Henry Sleight, John Hughes, Tomasz Korbak,
Rajashree Agrawal, Dhruv Pai, Andrey Gromov, Daniel Roberts, Diyi Yang,
David Donoho, and Sanmi Koyejo -- contend that [**[the problem of
training AI on AI-made data isn\'t significant]{.underline}**, [given
the way that model training is **actually
done**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

This latest baker\'s dozen plus one -- from Stanford, AI safety group
Constellation, the University of Maryland at College Park, MIT, and
Sequoia Capital -- make the case for not worrying in a paper titled:
\"Is Model Collapse Inevitable? Breaking the Curse of Recursion by
Accumulating Real and Synthetic Data.\"

It\'s worth noting that some of these boffins acknowledge support
through grants from commercial entities including OpenAI and Google,
although the authors insist their research results do not necessarily
reflect the positions or policies of their funders.

Gerstgrasser, a postdoctoral research associate at Harvard SEAS and
visiting postdoctoral scholar at Stanford, outlined on social media the
argument he and his colleagues want to make.

\"As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent on the internet,
there\'s a growing concern that future AI models will be trained on this
\'tainted\' data,\" he asserted. \"It\'s like a virus that could infect
the entire AI ecosystem!

\"Many experts have warned that this could lead to a doomsday scenario
for AI. If models keep getting worse and worse with each generation, we
could face an \'AI apocalypse\'! But don\'t panic just yet ...\"

Gerstgrasser argued that [[while previous studies]{.mark} have [warned
about this \"doomsday scenario]{.mark},\" all [that research relies on
the assumption that each succeeding generation of AI would train
**exclusively** on the synthetic data]{.mark}]{.underline} produced by
the previous generation model.

He argues that **[[legacy data won\'t just be
discarded]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Instead of being replaced]{.mark}
every generation, [it\'s more likely to accumulate]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- the [synthetic data will just get mixed with the organic data, and
[the resulting model will **continue to perform.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"Our findings extend these prior works to show that [[if data
accumulates and models train on a mixture of \'real\' and synthetic
data]{.underline}, **[model collapse no longer
occurs]{.underline}**]{.mark},\" Gerstgrasser et al declare in their
\"Is Model Collapse Inevitable?\" paper.

[\"\[T\]hese results strongly suggest that [the \'curse of recursion\'
may not be]{.mark} as [dire]{.mark} as had been portrayed]{.underline}
-- provided we accumulate synthetic data alongside real data, rather
than replacing real data by synthetic data only.\"

vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, with [temp]{.mark}erature[s
rising at]{.mark} more than [twice the global
average]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This phenomenon, known as Arctic amplification1, has profound
consequences not only for local ecosystems and Indigenous communities
but also for global weather patterns, sea levels, and biodiversity.

[[Combating]{.mark} Arctic [c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange
[requires]{.mark} [urgent]{.mark} and comprehensive [policy
response]{.mark}s [at]{.mark} local, [national]{.mark}, and
international [levels]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This article discusses several key [policies]{.mark} and strategies
[that have been implemented]{.mark} and improvements to help further
address this pressing issue.]{.underline}

International policy to combat Arctic climate change

Worldwide policies and initiatives to combat Arctic climate change
include:

EU Arctic Policy

The EU aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable
energy sources in the Arctic. It also supports the Arctic Council's goal
of reducing black carbon emissions by 33% by 2025.

UK Glasgow Climate Pact

The UK's policy framework aims to reduce emissions and achieve a net
zero transition. The UK also recognises the need to protect the Arctic
environment from increased activity.

Arctic Council Strategic Plan

The Arctic Council's plan promotes conservation and sustainable use of
the Arctic marine environment. The plan also encourages safety at sea,
prevention of marine pollution, and cooperation to improve knowledge of
the Arctic marine environment.

WWF Arctic

The WWF's Arctic Plan advocates for Arctic states to establish Arctic
Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and Other Effective Area-Based
Conservation Measures (OECMs).

We need change, now

[[Despite these measures, there is still a long way to go]{.mark} in
combating Arctic climate change.]{.underline}

[What happens in the Arctic will influence the rest of our planet.
Without urgent action to slash greenhouse gas emissions, the world will
continue to feel the effects of a warming Arctic.]{.underline}

**\[IMAGE OMITTED\]**

For areas around the world---even thousands of kilometres south of the
Arctic---this will mean rising sea levels, changing temperature and
precipitation patterns, and more severe weather events.

Let's look at some policy improvements which could help reduce Arctic
climate change.

Strengthening global climate agreements

The Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to below 2°C
(preferably to 1.5°C) above pre-industrial levels, is one of the primary
international mechanisms to combat climate change.

However, while the Agreement provides a framework for global
cooperation, it needs to be more robustly enforced, particularly in the
Arctic. Policies to strengthen commitments to climate mitigation, with
specific attention to emissions reduction in high-impact regions like
the Arctic, are essential.

Governments can push for stronger targets and timetables for carbon
emissions reductions, ensuring that the Arctic's vulnerability is fully
considered in future climate talks.

In particular, the international community needs to address the need for
action on short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) like black carbon and
methane, which are disproportionately affecting the Arctic.

By prioritising reductions in these pollutants, we can significantly
reduce regional warming.

Investing in renewable energy and green technologies

One of the most effective ways to reduce global warming is by
transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.

[[The Arctic]{.mark} region, often seen as rich in oil and gas reserves,
[has been a focus of]{.mark} resource [extraction]{.mark}. However,
continued fossil fuel exploration and exploitation are accelerating
climate change in the region.]{.underline}

[[A shift in policy is needed to incentivise the development]{.mark} and
deployment [of renewable energy tech]{.mark}nologies, [such as]{.mark}
wind, solar, and [geothermal energy]{.mark}. Governments can introduce
tax credits, subsidies, and grants [to promote green]{.mark} energy
[solutions]{.mark}, not only in the Arctic but also in countries with
Arctic territories, like Canada, the United States, Russia, and
Norway.]{.underline}

[Moreover, promoting innovation in energy storage, grid integration,
[and]{.mark} low-carbon technologies can help these regions [transition
to a low-carbon economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In this dynamic context, [[U.S. energy policy has evolved]{.mark}
significantly in terms of markets, supplies, regulation, and
legislation.]{.underline} The country's success in using fracking
technology and exploiting abundant shale reserves have made it the
world's largest producer of hydrocarbons and a major exporter,
especially of natural gas.1 [Further, [as]{.mark} national and
international [concerns about climate change have grown,]{.mark} U.S.
energy [policy]{.mark} [has become more aligned with
transitioning]{.mark} [to]{.mark} renewable sources. So far, the focus
of clean energy additions has been on [wind, solar, and nuclear
power.]{.mark}]{.underline} Beginning in the mid-2000s, the United
States issued legislation and policies raising renewable energy to the
level of industrial policy. Among those were the Energy Policy Act
(2005), the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (2009), the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) (2021), the CHIPS and
Science Act (2022), and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) (2022).

[[However, geothermal energy]{.mark}---which uses the heat of the
earth's crust for power---[has been]{.mark} largely [left out of
U.S.]{.mark} industrial [policy]{.mark}. This is [despite the facts that
utilizing this source]{.mark} of renewable energy [requires]{.mark} some
of [the same technologies that have made the U]{.mark}nited

[capacity]{.mark} [while reducing]{.mark} or eliminating net [carbon

now is: how should public and private resources be directed to provide
the United States with an energy system optimized for the current
national and international environment?

### Arctic Key

#### Arctic region key leader in [renewable modelling]{.underline} -- Alaska [proves]{.underline}.

[As a matter of necessity]{.underline}, [the **Arctic region** has
become a **leader** in **renewable** energy **development** and
**integration**]{.underline}, [with more than **double** the global
average in the percentage of power generated from renewable
resources]{.underline}. Countries like Iceland and Norway source
virtually 100% of their energy for heat and power from renewable
resources. [The **U**nited **S**tates is actively working with partners

region's overall **energy resilience**]{.underline}. In an estimated 250
locations, [diesel fuel is augmented with local]{.underline} sources of
renewable energy such as hydropower, wind, solar, biomass, marine
hydrokinetic or **[geothermal energy]{.underline}**. [Alaska has played
a **leadership role** in **incorporating** renewable
resources]{.underline} into community-scale microgrids.

#### **Geothermal energy systems are key to resilience for Arctic communities**

[[Energy systems in remote communities in Arctic countries]{.mark} [can
be viewed as]{.mark} integrated heatpower-food systems
[essential]{.mark} [for]{.mark} community [survival]{.mark} and
resilience. [Conventional]{.mark} energy [systems]{.mark} in Arctic
countries [are susceptible to disruptions]{.mark}---both [grid-connected
and remote communitie]{.mark}s are likely to [face]{.mark} continuing
[threats from]{.mark} severe [weather]{.mark} events, [supply chain
disruptions]{.mark}, unstable [and]{.mark} [increasing diesel
cost]{.mark}, etc]{.underline}. The question this paper seeks to answer
is: are integrated geothermal energy systems resilient solutions for
communities in Arctic countries? The answer appears to be yes.
[[Geothermal is]{.mark} a [resilient]{.mark} energy source for power
[and]{.mark} heat, and in turn, its use [can]{.mark} [enhance]{.mark}
[the resilience of communities in Arctic countries]{.mark}. This is true
in smaller, isolated microgrid contexts as well. Although the economics
of small-scale geothermal applications may remain a barrier today
(though one that is getting smaller with each new technological
advancement), from the perspective of technical viability, reliability,
and sustainability, geothermal can play a significant role in providing
resilient energy solutions to remote communities in areas where
resources are present (see Figure 5). Notably[, geothermal offers a
known technology that is reliant only on locally occurring
resources]{.mark} (and thus independent of outside fuel supplies) [and
can supply]{.mark} dispatchable and flexible baseload heat and
[power]{.mark}---[a unique mix of characteristics that no other energy
source can yet lay claim to]{.mark}.]{.underline} Limited deployment of
geothermal microgrids in off-grid settings means that many unknowns
remain about their performance, but the success of large grid-connected
geothermal in providing ancillary services---particularly critical to
microgrid operation---and the success of small geothermal in providing
inexpensive power to remote communities are promising steps.

[[Geothermal]{.mark} energy [systems]{.mark} also [stand out as]{.mark}
[being incredibly resilient against]{.mark} extreme [weather]{.mark}
events or physical attacks.]{.underline} Most of a geothermal system is
underground and is therefore [much less vulnerable to environmental
challenges, [such as hurricanes]{.mark}, winter [storms]{.mark}, or
wild[fires]{.mark}, [or man-made threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}19 As
concerns over grid reliability continue to grow, such attributes will
become more valuable to consumers and regulators.20 Secure: [[Uses
Existing Domestic Supply Chains]{.underline}]{.mark} Geothermal also
offers a more secure and more domestic supply chain when compared to
other energy sources. For instance, [China currently dominates the solar
industry, controlling over 80% of the world's solar panel supply
chains.21 Next-generation [geothermal does not]{.mark} [suffer
from]{.mark} the same [reliance on Chinese supply
chains]{.mark}.]{.underline}22 Compact: Small Footprint and Minimal Land
Use [[A]{.mark} geothermal [plant can produce energy all year]{.mark}
around the clock and do so [with a]{.mark} relatively [small]{.mark}
land [footprint]{.mark}. A 2022 study indicates that [geothermal energy
has one of the lowest levels of land use]{.mark}.]{.underline} 23 More
specifically, the study shows that today's geothermal energy fleet uses
approximately 4.5% of the same surface area as coal, 0.37% of wind
energy, or 0.08% for crop-based biomass.24 Clean: [Minimal Emissions
[and]{.mark} Water Use Geothermal energy systems [offer positive
environmental attributes]{.mark} with relatively minor and manageable
risks. First and foremost, [geothermal-associated emissions are far
lower than]{.mark} for [most other types]{.mark} of energy.25 According

emits "97% less acid rain-causing sulfur compounds and about 99% less

#### Geothermal power incredibly [reliable]{.underline} and [consistent]{.underline} 

**Biello, 13** -- award-winning journalist, current science curator for
TED, and previous Environment and Energy Editor at Scientific American

Player,\" Scientific American, 7-29-2013,

[Although similar natural bounty has turned Iceland into a geothermal
powerhouse, there are only so many such sites around. That\'s
where [fracking](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=can-fracking-be-done-without-impacting-water),
the controversial practice of pumping fluid underground to shatter shale
and release oil or gas, can help. [Fracking "**enhances"**
geothermal]{.mark} by making cracks in hot rocks where none existed,
[allowing heat to be harvested]{.mark} from Earth's interior
[practically anywhere,]{.mark}]{.underline} although this reduces the
total power produced because of the need to pump water through the
system[.]{.underline}

As an [[added benefit]{.mark},]{.underline} however: [[[geothermal
power](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/deep_geothermal_the_untapped_energy_source/2077/) can
run **constantly**---]{.mark}the hot rocks don\'t cool very fast---which
makes it [renewable and predictable]{.mark}. \"Geothermal is homegrown,
reliable and clean,\" says Rohit Khanna, program manager at the World
Bank for its Energy Sector Management Assistance Program. That is a big
part of the reason it is being pursued in developing countries such as
Chile, Indonesia, Kenya and the Philippines.]{.underline}

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} the case of the [[Philippines [geothermal
power](http://e360.yale.edu/feature/deep_geothermal_the_untapped_energy_source/2077/)]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[[produces]{.mark} nearly 2,000 mega]{.underline}watts, or nearly [[**20
percent** of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[country\'s
electricity]{.underline}]{.mark}, thanks to investments that were made
in the 1990s. And Kenya, according to its ambassador to the U.S.,
Elkanah Odembo, would like to derive more than half its electricity from
geothermal by 2030. The goal: a combination of geothermal and
hydroelectric power that will make them entirely renewably powered.
\"The potential is there,\" Odembo promises. He says the Rift Valley
contains an estimated 15 gigawatts of potential geothermal power.
Nairobi has already become a boomtown for such development

As a result, there\'s [a [**large role** to play for supporting research
and development]{.mark}]{.underline} to lower risks and improve the
technology. The DoE, which [invested in Ormat\'s Nevada
project](http://energy.gov/articles/nevada-deploys-first-us-commercial-grid-connected-enhanced-geothermal-system),
also has programs to explore how to expand geothermal's reach. [For
example, it may be possible to take advantage of lower temperatures from
cooler rocks found throughout the subsurface]{.underline}. The hot water
co-produced with oil and gas wells [[could also be used to produce
**electricity**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Slimmer test wells might
decrease costs of exploration. Of course, better drilling technology
developed for geothermal energy production may find a use in the oil and
gas industry first, such as the laser drilling being pioneered with
the [help of
ARPA--E](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=arpa-e-us-invent-future-of-clean-energy-slideshow) by
Foro Energy. [In fact, the oil and gas industry may find itself
developing technology that can be applied to enhanced geothermal. Their
efforts to frack shales and free natural gas or oil require them to
understand flow rates of fluid through the rock. \"We know that has to
tie into what we do,\" DoE\'s Hollett notes.]{.underline}

[[Penetration of geothermal has been limited due to the low-cost of
fossil fuels]{.mark}. However, with the right incentives and forthcoming
carbon tax schemes geothermal could appear increasingly
attractive.]{.underline} [[Geothermal]{.underline} [provides a
low-carbon baseload power, which importantly offers grid stability,
meaning it could provide a realistic pathway to the closure of coal and
gas power plants10]{.underline}]{.mark},11. To date, the [preference of
the, apparently, cheaper wind and solar-PV technologies, unfortunately,
lock economies into a carbon-based gas or coal infrastructure38,
precisely because wind and Solar-PV lack the baseload component.
[Geothermal power is also flexible, allowing power plant operators to
ramp up and down the resource, therefore making it the perfect
low-carbon partner]{.mark}]{.underline} with wind and solar-PV and
hydroelectric resources. [Given the geotectonic position of several
world's megacities, we see a huge potential for the use of geothermal
power which would also reduce the environmental impact and help
contrasting the energy challenge in overpopulated areas]{.underline}.
Regarding regulation, there are a series of legal issues which are a
good guide for the proper regulation of this resource (e.g., royalty
payments, use fees, environmental protection, freedom of Information,
rights-of-way under the land policy and management, minerals management,
leasing, operations, rights of local communities, etc.) that are
permanently updated by countries and states that have a developed
geothermal industry (see, for example, the USA code of the state and
federal regulations39), in the process of development (see, for example,
the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 21 of 2014 about Geothermal40),
or that foresee the potential use of this resource in the medium or long
term (see, for example, the proposal to modify the Decree 1073 of 2015
of the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Colombia41).

#### We have the capability to drill to access Geothermal energy needed to meet demand

energy source below our feet
<https://news.mit.edu/2022/quaise-energy-geothermal-0628> Accessed
2/8/2025\]

[There's an abandoned coal power plant in upstate New York that most
people regard as a useless relic]{.underline}. But MIT's Paul Woskov
sees things differently. [Woskov, a research engineer in MIT's Plasma
Science and Fusion Center, notes [the plant's power turbine is still
intact and the transmission lines still run to the
grid.]{.mark}]{.underline} Using an approach he's been working on for
the last 14 years, he's hoping it [will be back online, completely
carbon-free, within the decade.]{.underline} In fact, Quaise Energy, the
company commercializing Woskov's work, believes [[if it can retrofit one
power plant, the same process will work on virtually every coal and gas
power plant]{.underline}]{.mark} in the world. [Quaise is hoping to
accomplish those lofty goals by tapping into the energy source below our
feet.]{.underline} [[The company plans to vaporize enough rock to create
the world's deepest holes and harvest **geothermal** energy at a scale
that could satisfy human energy consumption for millions of
years]{.mark}. T]{.underline}hey haven't yet solved all the related
engineering challenges, but Quaise's founders have set an ambitious
timeline to begin harvesting energy from a pilot well by 2026. The plan
would be easier to dismiss as unrealistic if it were based on a new and
unproven technology. [But Quaise's drilling systems center around a
microwave-emitting device called a gyrotron that has been used in
research and manufacturing for decades.]{.underline} "This will happen
quickly once we solve the immediate engineering problems of transmitting
a clean beam and having it operate at a high energy density without
breakdown," explains Woskov, who is not formally affiliated with Quaise
but serves as an advisor. "[[It'll go fast because the underlying
technology, gyrotrons, are commercially available]{.mark}. You could
place an order with a company and have a system delivered right now ---
granted, these beam sources have never been used 24/7, but [they are
engineered to be operational for long time periods]{.mark}. In five or
six years, I think we'll have a plant running]{.underline} if we solve
these engineering problems. I'm very optimistic." [Woskov and many other
researchers have been using gyrotrons to heat material in nuclear fusion
experiments for decades. It wasn't until 2008, however, after the MIT
Energy Initiative (MITEI) published a request for proposals on new
geothermal drilling technologies]{.underline}, that Woskov thought of
using gyrotrons for a new application. "\[Gyrotrons\] haven't been
well-publicized in the general science community, but [[those of us in
fusion research understood they were very powerful beam sources --- like
lasers, but in a different frequency range,"]{.mark} Woskov says. "I
thought, [why not direct these high-power beams, instead of into fusion
plasma, down into rock and vaporize]{.mark} the hole]{.underline}?" As
power from other renewable energy sources has exploded in recent
decades, [geothermal energy has plateaued, mainly because geothermal
plants only exist in places where natural conditions allow for energy
extraction at relatively shallow depths of up to 400 feet beneath the
Earth's surface. At a certain point, conventional drilling becomes
impractical because deeper crust is both hotter and harder, which wears
down mechanical drill bits]{.underline}. Woskov's idea to use gyrotron
beams to vaporize rock sent him on a research journey that has never
really stopped. With some funding from MITEI, he began running tests,
quickly filling his office with small rock formations he'd blasted with
millimeter waves from a small gyrotron in MIT's Plasma Science and
Fusion Center.

six Research Areas. This Multi-Year Program Plan (MYPP) lays out these
Research Areas and the associated technical objectives (Table 1.1),
which include five technical areas and one less technical
technologyagnostic area (Geothermal Integration and Awareness).
[Progress in each area is critical to meeting the promise of geothermal

"Overall, [[geothermal projects bring significant economic value to
communities across the Western United States through their job creation
and tax revenue for communities]{.mark} in which plants
operate.]{.underline}" The data of the brief -- which can be accessed
here (pdf) is based on a survey that was conducted by GEA of the major
geothermal power producers in the United States. [Geothermal power
plants employ about 1.17 persons per MW]{.underline} at each operating
power plants. [These are permanent jobs that last the
entire]{.underline} 30-50 year [lifetime]{.underline} [of the power
plant]{.underline}. In some circumstances, GEA estimates [the persons
per MW employed is 19 times the reported onsite employment of wind or
solar PV]{.underline} project [and 5 times reported onsite employment
for concentrating solar project]{.underline}. In total, [adding
governmental, administrative, and technical related jobs, the geothermal
industry employs about 2.13 persons per MW. ? An average 50 MW facility
will create permanent employment for about a 100 people]{.underline}. In
2013, [[geothermal power producers paid \$29 million dollars in]{.mark}
annual [property taxes]{.mark}, including \$21 million dollars to the
State of California. ? Geothermal paid about \$26 million in Rents and
Royaltie]{.underline}s to state, federal and local governments
nationwide in 2014 of which quarter (about \$19.5 million) is returned
to benefit state and local county governments. [[Developing]{.mark} the
remaining identified [geothermal resources]{.mark} estimated to exist in
California]{.underline} by the United States Geologic Survey [could [add
2500 permanent on-site jobs]{.mark} in the State of California,
[generate another 20-30 million dollars in property tax revenue for the
state, and generate almost 15,000 construction and manufacturing
jobs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over the course of [[30 to 50 years an
average 20 MW facility will pay nearly \$6.3 to \$11 million dollars in
property taxes]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Geothermal plants during
construction employ about 3.1 person-years per MW and the manufacturing
of the equipment requires an additional 3.3 person-years per
MW]{.underline}. A [[50 MW geothermal plant will require 310
person-years of construction and manufacturing
employment]{.underline}]{.mark}. Measured in person-years of employment,
and [given their long lifetime geothermal plants produce stable,
long-term, local employment]{.underline}. Producing electricity using
geothermal resources as opposed to fossil fuels or natural gas provides
an environmental externality benefit of \$0.01 compared to natural gas
and \$0.035 for coal per kWh. GEA estimates that
[[geothermal]{.underline} [provides]{.underline}]{.mark} [approximately
[\$117 million in externality benefits]{.mark} per yea]{.underline}r to
the states of Nevada (\$29 million) and California (\$88 million) [[by
avoiding fossil fuel emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} based on current
geothermal generation.

**increasing**]{.mark} [the amount]{.mark} of money [**households pay**
for electricity]{.mark}]{.underline} --- even as the agency found that
the relative importance of gas to the power sector is falling.

[The federal [**projections** of electric growth]{.mark}]{.underline}
largely [[powered by renewables]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[contradict]{.underline}]{.mark}** recent
[[arguments]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that]{.mark}
**[only]{.mark}**]{.underline} a buildout of
**[[gas]{.underline}]{.mark}** infrastructure [[can protect
the]{.underline}]{.mark} nation's **[[grid]{.underline}]{.mark}** from
skyrocketing demand.

Earlier this week, CNBC carried a report by Wells Fargo that found
electricity demand would shoot up 20 percent by 2030 --- driven largely
by the push to build new data centers for artificial intelligence.

The fossil fuel industry this week seized on those numbers to argue that
only natural gas can reliably meet the rising demand --- and that new
gas plants must be built quickly. (Goldman Sachs has argued that as much
as 60 percent of new AI demand will be powered by gas.)

The recent EIA projections of rising electric demand roughly
tracked with those of the banks --- but suggested that [**renewables**
are so far the **lion's share** of new capacity]{.underline}.

"[In 20**25**]{.underline}, [we expect]{.underline} generation from
[**solar** to **exceed**]{.underline} the contribution from
[hydroelectricity]{.underline} for the first year in history," EIA
Administrator Joe DeCarolis said in a statement.

According to the agency, [[total U.S. **power**]{.mark} [generation is
expected to]{.mark} [**grow 3 percent** in]{.mark}
20**[24]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- which if it holds would represent a
roughly 15 percent rise by 2030. That increase is equivalent to about 13
gigawatts, or enough electricity to power a little under 10 million
homes.

But the agency found that about [[**92 percent** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[new generation is]{.mark} coming [from
**wind**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[hydropower]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and, above all, large-scale **[[solar]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### Government Key

#### Funding and support for Geothermal is key for stability that guarantees increased deployment & Support

[[Accelerate commercialization and deployment]{.mark} of geothermal
innovations. De[-risking private investment and commercializing more
geothermal technologies at home is critical to beating competitors in
international market]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark} later on.
[Geothermal projects already carry relatively higher fixed capital
costs]{.underline}. When combined with the exploration risk, investors
are disincentivized to support new projects. However, [[when that risk
is minimized and projects become more profitable, deployment
accelerates]{.mark}, giving domestic developers more opportunities to
learn, enhance their industry know-how, and achieve economies of
scale.]{.underline}

[[Increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} public [[funding]{.mark} [for research
and development]{.mark} to \$216 million]{.underline} as requested by
the Energy Department for FY24 [[is a strong first
step]{.underline}]{.mark} in reducing investment risk.4
[[Supporting]{.mark} more [programs]{.mark}]{.underline} through the
Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO), Office of Science, and facilities
like FORGE [will develop [better downhole materials and
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} [--]{.mark} lowering failure rates and
bringing more geothermal innovations to market. Additionally, [[Congress
should focus on increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} demonstration grant
[[funding for technologies that will drive durable competitive
advantages and can be exported]{.underline}]{.mark} -- like EGS and
supercritical drilling technologies that have the potential to bring
geothermal virtually anywhere.5 [The US should also expand support for
geothermal-lithium extraction projects that separate dissolved minerals
from the hot brine produced by geothermal power plants.6 Geothermal
brine could account for as much as 60% of global lithium production by
2025,]{.underline} and the Salton Sea in California alone could produce
600,000 metric tons annually, worth \$6-12 billion, from its geothermal
waters.7 [[Congress should also seek to sustain and even increase these
investments well through the end of the decade]{.mark} to achieve the
goals outlined in the Enhanced Geothermal Shot,]{.underline} which runs
through 2035.

De-risk financing for early-stage projects. [Creative [financing can
de-risk demonstration and early-stage commercialization]{.mark}, [giving
US companies the confidence to develop faster]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[This could be accomplished by DOE reimplementing and Congress
supporting risk insurance and cost-sharing programs]{.underline} through
GTO like those phased out in the 1980s, such as the Program Research
Development Announcement (PRDA, 1976), Program Opportunity Notice (PON,
1979), and User-Coupled Confirmation Drilling Program (UCDP, 1980).8
Additionally, access to DOE financing programs specifically for
geothermal energy projects like the 1974 Geothermal Loan Guarantee
Program and 1980 Loans for Geothermal Reservoir Confirmation Program may
also be helpful.9 [Improved versions of these programs could ensure
percentages of available loan authorities are applied to independent
stages of EGS developmen]{.underline}t like lease acquisition,
exploratory drilling, development drilling, or power plant
construction.10 [While DOE's Loan Programs Office currently provides
loan guarantees for clean energy projects, including geothermal
technologies, available funds are not specifically parsed out for
different technologies or stages of project development]{.underline},
and for the most part come with additional statutory requirements that
are absent from these prior programs, such as innovation or
site-specific stipulations.11 These loans would have an even greater
impact if they could be paired with or converted into grants supported
by a Congressionally appropriated geothermal risk reduction fund, to
offset exploratory drilling risks, making public and private debt more
feasible for the industry.

[Streamline barriers to domestic deployment. A favorable permitting and
regulatory environment can unlock geothermal deployment, facilitate
learning, and help US companies achieve economies of scale]{.underline}.
According to BCG, [it takes an average of 7-10 years to develop
geothermal plants, and 4-6 of those years are spent mainly on well
permitting]{.underline}.12 In contrast, the average deployment timelines
for both O&G and utility-scale wind and solar projects are 2-6 years.13
[Longer timelines compound the cost of capital, with financing making up
30% of geothermal's already high capital costs]{.underline}.14 When
compared to 2-7% for wind and solar, the [appetite for private
investment into firm geothermal energy can diminish in favor of other,
more variable energy technologies]{.underline}.15 [[Easing permitting
and the implementation of an efficient regulatory environment could
decrease timelines by 25-50%]{.underline} [and increase geothermal
capacity by as much as 15-20 times by 2050]{.underline}]{.mark} as new
technologies like EGS and supercritical drilling unlock vast untapped US
reservoirs.16 [The US could allow for streamlined review through
continued support for development of a geothermal-specific Renewable
Energy Coordination Office]{.underline} (RECO) as outlined in the 2021
MOU to Improve Public Land Renewable Energy Project Permit
Coordination.17 [Such a RECO could be designed to raise awareness and
harmonize geothermal regulations and permitting requirements as well as
provide centralized information sharing opportunities between federal,
state, and local permitting agencies. This interagency office could
create templates for new wells to speed approvals and target lease
approvals]{.underline} on specific federal land for geothermal projects.
Such an office could also ensure streamlining does not come at the
expense of seeking social license and community engagement. Additional
Department of Interior and Bureau of Land Management funding would be
essential to supporting such an office.

5.2. Policy implications The [[findings of this study]{.mark}, which
examined the influence of geothermal energy on GDP and GHG emissions,
[highlight the need for targeted policies to promote its global
adoption]{.mark}]{.underline}. In developing countries, the [[adoption
of geothermal energy requires a multifaceted approach]{.mark}. [Key to
this is the implementation of financial incentives and support
mechanisms, such as subsidies]{.mark} or tax incentives]{.underline},
[[which make geothermal projects more feasible and attractive for
investors]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Streamlining regulatory processes is
equally important to expedite project approvals and reduce bureaucratic
delays]{.underline}. Furthermore, public [financing can play a crucial
role, especially in the early stages of geothermal projects]{.underline}
where risks and costs are higher. This could take the form of grants,
loans, or guarantees. [Capacity building is also vital; developing local
expertise through training programs ensures a skilled workforce capable
of supporting the geothermal sector\'s growth. Lastly, it\'s essential
to engage communities in geothermal projects]{.underline}, ensuring that
the development is inclusive and that benefits like job creation and
infrastructure improvement are equitably shared. For developed
countries, the [focus should be on advancing the geothermal sector
through innovative policies and technologies. This includes setting
ambitious renewable energy targets with a significant role]{.underline}
for geothermal energy. Regularly [updating policies to keep pace with
technological advancements and market changes is crucial for maintaining
a conducive environment for geothermal development. Investing in
research and development is key to fostering innovation in this sector,
leading to more efficient and cost-effective geothermal
technologies]{.underline}. Policies for geothermal leasing and land use
need to be clear and effective, facilitating smoother project
development while ensuring environmental sustainability. Additionally,
[developed countries should engage in international collaborations,
sharing knowledge and best practices in geothermal
technology]{.underline}. Such collaborative efforts not only enhance the
global knowledge base but also support the worldwide adoption of this
sustainable energy source. Like many empirical studies, the present
study has certain limitations that constrain the generalizability of its
findings. The limited sample size, due to missing data, necessitated the
use of specific econometric techniques to test the hypotheses. While not
definitive, [this study provides a starting point for future research
examining the impacts of geothermal energy on economic and environmental
indicators in various national contexts. Significant knowledge gaps
remain regarding geothermal energy\'s impacts on local
communities]{.underline} and how benefits can be inclusive and equitably
distributed. Moreover, there is limited comparative analysis on
geothermal\'s sustainability effects relative to other renewable
options. For future studies, it is crucial to consider adding more
related variables to geothermal energy, such as technology factors,
technological advancements, infrastructure development, investments in
R&D, public perception, energy policies and regulations. Investing in
rigorous, multifaceted research on geothermal sustainability is
essential to unlock its full potential as a renewable energy source.
This study\'s findings and methodology provide a foundation for future
research to investigate the sustainability impacts of geothermal energy
across various factors.

[As the **U.S.** considers expanding its **military** **op**eration**s**
in the **Arctic**]{.underline}---including the U.S. Coast Guard which
one presenter described as "chronically underfunded"---[it should do so
in a way that does not **exacerbate** the effects of **climate
change**]{.underline}. **[Energy]{.underline}**, of course, [is
**essential** to **military** **op**eration**s**]{.underline}, and one
presenter stipulated that [fuel consumption by the **U.S.** armed forces
represents **2 percent** of **all** global fuel use]{.underline}.
[Presenters agreed that opportunities for **military decarbonization**
could drive change in **key areas**]{.underline} [including]{.underline}
microgrids and distribution of decarbonization infrastructure, electric
vehicle and charging station infrastructure, [**expansion** of
**geothermal** energy supply]{.underline}, safe deployment of nuclear
power including micro-reactors, and acceleration of demand for
sustainable shipping and aviation fuel.

Conversely, [continued **reliance** on traditional **fossil energy**
sources has negatively affected force **readiness** as the **fuel price
spikes** can literally cost the Department of Defense **billions** of
dollars in unforeseen and unbudgeted expenses]{.underline}. One
participant acknowledged "that's a big number, even for D.o.D."

As one presenter put it, "climate change is not a new issue for the
military." The Department of Defense has seen and felt its implications
from sea-level rise threatening infrastructure like the world's largest
naval base in Norfolk, Virginia to the spike in humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief missions related to extreme weather events. Today,
military operations are already at the cutting edge of U.S. renewable
energy implementation. Two-thirds of energy consumed on bases, 1.2
gigawatts annually, comes from renewable sources and saves \$400 million
per year in energy costs. And [leadership believes that accelerating the
transition to renewables in the long-term will]{.underline} "[give us a
**war-fighting advantage** and protect **national
security**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the biggest threat we face:
**[climate change]{.underline}**."

U.S. Energy Choices

Of course, climate change is not just a challenge for military
operations; it also threatens global society as a whole. So, what energy
choices should the United States make now to address the threat and
pivot to a clean energy future? On these points, experts presented on
technologies that can accelerate America's transition and ways to
optimize our energy grid to handle new sources of electricity and avoid
the extreme weather-fueled breakdowns we have witnessed in recent years,
most notably in Texas and California. On the former point, one expert
broke the challenges down to six factors: scalability, affordability,
reliability, carbon and "traditional" pollution reduction, position on
the learning curve, and position on the price curve. Of the options
currently under consideration, this presenter ranked solar, wind,
offshore wind, EVs, batteries, and heat pumps as technologies that are
ready today for large scale deployment. However, there are key
[constraining factors]{.underline}, such as siting and deployment
challenges for solar and wind, and minerals and installer/labor
availability [for]{.underline} the others. Solar thermal energy,
**[geothermal energy]{.underline}**, hydrogen, and storage tech were in
the next tier, with the main challenges to deployment being research and
development investment. The presenter ranked other options in the
"future" (4th generation nuclear and carbon capture and storage) and
"pipe dream" (nuclear fusion and direct air capture) categories.

The Inflation Reduction Act took significant steps to begin addressing
many of these challenges, yet the major blockade to rapid deployment,
particular for the "ready" suite of technologies, [comes down to issues
of **siting** and **permitting**]{.underline}. [Across the spectrum of
members of **Congress**]{.underline} and presenters alike, there [was
clear agreement that the pace of **permitting** is a major
**hurdle**]{.underline}, [and it should be addressed if the **U.S.** is
to **keep up** with other developed countries]{.underline} in renewable
energy deployment.

As promised, President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} [began reversing]{.mark}
the country's [energy policies his first day in office]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} a spate of [orders]{.mark} [largely favoring oil, gas and
coal]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [[there is one renewable energy that did
find favor: geothermal]{.mark}.]{.underline} Energy experts say that
makes sense --- [[geothermal energy makes electricity
24/7]{.underline}.]{.mark} Many [people working in the field came from
the oil and gas industry and they use much of the same technology for
drilling wells.]{.underline} Trump strongly supports and gets support
from the oil and gas industry. [And [there's bipartisan support in
Congress for geothermal]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The [embrace of advanced
geothermal under this new administration, I'd say is not a giant
surpris]{.underline}e," said Alex Kania, a managing director at Marathon
Capital. "[[It's reliable, it's efficient, and frankly their ties to the
more conventional forms of energy production]{.underline}]{.mark}, I
think, is probably not lost on some people." [Geothermal creates
electricity cleanly by making steam from the Earth's natural heat and
using that steam to spin a turbine. It's a climate solution because it
reduces the need for]{.underline} traditional power plants that burn
[fossil fuels]{.underline} and cause climate change. [[Trump declared an
energy emergency on Monday, and included geothermal heat as one of the
domestic energy resources that could help e]{.mark}nsure a reliable,
diversified and affordable supply]{.underline} of energy. [[Solar, wind
and battery storage were omitted, and wind was singled out]{.underline}
in]{.mark} a separate order [[with]{.mark} [measures intended to slow it
down]{.mark}]{.underline}[. "]{.mark}[Geothermal is heating up and the
Trump administration is going to empower the industry over the next four
years to achieve its potential,"]{.underline} said Bryant Jones,
executive director of the geothermal trade association, Geothermal
Rising. It's a vibrant business right now. New [geothermal companies are
adapting technology and practices from oil and gas to create steam from
ubiquitous hot rock. That would make this kind of electricity
possible]{.underline} in many more places. The [[Energy Department
estimates the next generation of geothermal projects could provide some
90 gigawatts in the U.S. by 2050]{.mark} --- enough to power 65 million
homes or more]{.underline}. Former Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm
supported geothermal as a climate solution. [[Trump's pick for energy
secretary]{.underline}]{.mark}, Chris Wright, is a fossil fuel executive
who [[values]{.underline} [geothermal]{.underline}]{.mark}, too. His
company, Denver-based Liberty Energy, invested in Fervo Energy, a
Houston-based geothermal company. Wright said at his confirmation
hearing that he's excited about geothermal as an "an enormous, abundant
energy resource below everyone's feet." Wright's appointment is a clear
signal that this administration will support geothermal, said Terra
Rogers, a program director who focuses on the technology at the
nonprofit Clean Air Task Force. "He's well-informed of its risks and
opportunities, and continues to be a strong advocate for what it could
be," Rogers said. [The United States is a world leader in electricity
made from geothermal energy, but it still accounts for less than half a
percent of the nation's total large-scale generation]{.underline},
according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The big states
are California, Nevada, Utah, Hawaii, Oregon, Idaho and New Mexico,
where reservoirs of steam, or very hot water, lie close to the surface.
In its first actions this week, [the new administration also indicated
support for nuclear power]{.underline} and removing obstacles to mining
uranium, which can be refined into nuclear fuel. [Like geothermal,
nuclear power does not cause climate change. The executive order also
backs hydropower]{.underline}. Solar is the fastest-growing source of
electricity generation in the United States. Trump wants to increase
production of oil and gas in order for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost
energy and electricity of any nation in the world, he says. He took aim
at wind energy, temporarily halting offshore wind lease sales in federal
waters and pausing federal approvals, permits and loans for projects
both onshore and offshore. Trump says wind turbines are horrible, only
work with subsidies and are "many, many times" more expensive than
natural gas. Offshore wind is one of the most expensive sources of new
power generation, but onshore wind is cheaper than new natural gas
plants, according to estimates from the Energy Information
Administration. Jones, at Geothermal Rising, said [[the industry hopes
the support for geothermal energy will lead to streamlined permitting,
more federal research and tax credits to promote
innovation]{.underline}.]{.mark} Sage Geosystems in Houston is a
geothermal company launched by former executives at oil and gas giant
Shell. CEO Cindy Taff said [it's exciting to see more momentum building
for geothermal. She hopes it will spur investment in large projects,
including those that meet surging demand for electricity from data
centers and artificial intelligence]{.underline}, and projects to make
military facilities energy resilient. [[If geothermal projects could
multiply fast across the country, she said, it would bring the cost
down]{.mark}, and that would be good for everyone. "This could be the
decade of geothermal,]{.underline}" Taff said.

### AT: CCS CP

#### CCS fails -- too small, expensive and uses too much energy

In the inevitable crescendo of hype and [[greenwashing
that's]{.mark}]{.underline} coming our way, we'll doubtless hear a lot
about [[industrial carbon capture]{.underline}]{.mark} technologies that
attempt to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The COP 28 host
country, the United Arab Emirates, the world's largest oil companies and
even programs in the U.S. Department of Energy are working hard to
pushthis stuff.

Don't be fooled. It's mostly a distraction from what we really need to
do right now: phase out fossil fuels and deploy more effective climate
solutions.

Industrial carbon capture technologies come in many flavors, but the
most prominent are carbon capture and storage (CCS), which removes
carbon dioxide from highly concentrated point sources like power plants,
and direct air capture (DAC), which attempts to remove CO2 from open
air, where concentrations are much lower.

At first blush, this sounds great. But, as I've written previously,
counting on these technologies today is a bad idea. First, [[industrial
c]{.underline}]{.mark}arbon [[c]{.underline}]{.mark}apture projects
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} far [[too small to
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Even after decades of
investment]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[r]{.underline}]{.mark}esearch
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[d]{.underline}]{.mark}evelopment, [[today's
largest carbon capture projects **only remove a few seconds' worth of
our yearly** g]{.underline}]{.mark}reen[[h]{.underline}]{.mark}ouse
[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}a[[s]{.mark} emissions]{.underline}. And even
the planned Regional Direct Air Capture Hubs the Department of Energy is
supportingwill only be able to capture one million metric tonnes of CO2
every year; last year, the world emitted 40.5 billion.

Second, they are [[far too expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}, costing
thousands of dollars for every ton of CO2 removed.
[[Other]{.underline}]{.mark} climate [[solutions]{.underline}]{.mark},
including improving [[energy efficiency]{.underline}]{.mark}, deploying
[[renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} energy source[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}
and addressing emissions in agriculture and industrial sectors, [[are
far more cost-effective]{.underline}]{.mark}. Industrial carbon removal
costs at least \$1,000 per tonne removed; many other climate solutions
either have costs lower than \$10 per ton, and some have negative costs,
saving money immediately.

Third, these industrial carbon removal techniques also [[consume
excessive amounts of energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[present
enormous challenges to scalability]{.underline}]{.mark}. If we power
carbon capture projects with CO2-spewing fossil fuels, the projects lose
much of their proposed climate benefit. Moreover, powering them with
renewable or nuclear energy sources would provide far less climate
benefit than using that energy to directly displace fossil fuels.

In addition, CO2 captured by industrial carbon capture projects is
[[often used to drive more oil and gas back
out]{.underline}]{.mark}---for something known as enhanced oil recovery,
which uses fluids like carbon dioxide to push oil and gas out of rock
formations---[[helping fossil fuel companies continue
working.]{.underline}]{.mark}

One big dispute is over how big a role this technology, known as carbon
capture and storage, should play in the fight against global warming.
Some oil and gas producers say it should be central in planning for the
future. Others, including many activists and world leaders, dismiss
[[carbon capture]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[too unproven
and]{.underline}]{.mark} too [[risky]{.underline}]{.mark}.

keep [[burn]{.underline}]{.mark}ing fossil fuels [[at current rates and
capture or offset every last bit]{.underline}]{.mark} of carbon dioxide
that goes into the air. The [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[is
expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}, and in many cases [[there are better
alt]{.underline}]{.mark}ernative[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Despite billions]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars in investment,
[[countries and industries have]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[struggled to
get carbon capture projects up and running]{.underline}]{.mark} so far.
Unless that changes quickly, experts say, the technology might not play
more than a marginal role in climate efforts.

"Carbon capture and storage definitely could be a critical technology,"
said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.
"But the [[history of]{.mark}]{.underline} carbon
[[capture]{.underline}]{.mark} to date [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}
largely [[been a disappointment]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The (Limited) Role of Carbon Capture

In September, the I.E.A. published a detailed road map for what it would
take to slash the world's energy-related emissions to nearly zero by
midcentury in order to lessen the risk of catastrophic climate
disruptions.

In that road map, carbon capture accounted for just 8 percent of the
world's total emissions cuts between today and 2050. By contrast, the
vast majority of reductions would come from countries shifting away from
fossil fuels entirely: relying more heavily on wind and solar power for
electricity and swapping out gasoline-powered cars for electric ones.

Cost is one reason. In theory, [[companies could attach a carbon capture
device]{.underline}]{.mark} onto almost any factory or power plant that
burns fossil fuels today. But in practice, [[it's]{.mark}]{.underline}
often [[cheaper to shut down a coal plant and replace it
with]{.underline}]{.mark} some combination of [[wind,
solar]{.underline}]{.mark} and batteries, or to swap out a gas boiler
for an electric heat pump.

[Here are five reasons why embracing carbon capture is a fool's
errand.]{.underline}

[1. [Carbon Capture Is]{.mark} an **[Expensive]{.mark}**
Failure]{.underline}

[[After **billions**]{.mark} of dollars [in]{.mark}]{.underline} public
and private [**[investments]{.mark}** over decades, [there are]{.mark}
no carbon capture success stories --- [only **colossal
failures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One of the largest was the Petra Nova
coal plant in Texas, once the poster child for CO2 removal. But the
plant consistently underperformed, before it finally closed for good
last year.

Another high-profile example --- the San Juan Generating Station in New
Mexico, touted as the largest capture project in the world --- may
already be headed to a similar fate.

Between 2005 and 2012, [[the]{.mark} U.S. **[D]{.mark}**epartment
**[o]{.mark}**f **[E]{.mark}**nergy [spent \$6.9 **billion**]{.mark} to
try to demonstrate the **feasibility** of CCS]{.underline} for coal.
However, little came of this investment.

From 2014 to 2016, [**less than [4%]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the
[planned]{.mark} CCS [capacity]{.mark} had been
[deployed.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Biden administration wants to shift
its focus to carbon capture for gas-fired power plants. Yet, there's no
reason to think the outcome will be any different.

[2. **[C]{.mark}**arbon **[C]{.mark}**apture
I**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} [Energy Intensive]{.underline}

Running a carbon capture system is incredibly energy-intensive. [It
essentially requires building a new power plant to run the **system**,
[creat]{.mark}]{.underline}ing another source of air and **[carbon
[pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. That undermines the whole goal of
capturing carbon in the first place.

[[Our **country** emits]{.mark} roughly [**5 billion tons** of
carbon]{.mark}]{.underline} into the atmosphere [every year. [Removing
**1 billion**]{.mark} **tons**]{.underline} of that through direct air
capture [[would **require**]{.mark} nearly [the **entire** **electricity
output** of the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}.

It's also important to consider the scale of what would be needed. The
Energy Department recently announced \$12 million to fund "direct air
capture" projects. It also touted the possible removal of 100,000 tons
of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

To put this in perspective, the largest corporate polluter in 2018 was
responsible for releasing 119 million tons of CO2 equivalent --- and
that's only one of them.

[3. Carbon Capture Actually Increases **Emissions**]{.underline}

[[Due to]{.mark} the **large amount** of [**energy**
required]{.mark}]{.underline} to power carbon capture, [plus the **life
cycle** of fossil fuels, **[carbon capture]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
this country [[has]{.mark} actually **[put more CO2 into the atmosphere
than it has removed.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

That's not an accident. "Succesful" capture projects only exist at
facilities where the carbon is injected into existing wells to extract
more oil. This practice is known as "enhanced oil recovery." While an
oil company CEO might argue that doubling down on fossil fuels is a
climate solution, the planet begs to differ.

[4. [Storage]{.mark} Presents Significant
**[Risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}s

There are also other significant risks related to the disposal and
storage of carbon. For example, [**well failure** during
**injection**]{.underline} or [a blowout could result in a [release of
**large amounts** of CO2]{.mark}. Storage locations can [leak]{.mark}
CO2]{.underline}, as they are often sited near fossil fuel reservoirs.
There, oil [and]{.underline} gas [**wellbores** provide a **pathway**
for CO2 to **escape** to the surface]{.underline}. Those [storage
leaks]{.underline} could [[contaminate]{.mark} ground[water and
soil.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, CO2 [injections could
[cause]{.mark} **[earthquakes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which have already
been measured at injection sites.

As Friends of the Earth noted recently, when a CO2 pipeline in a
majority Black community in Mississippi ruptured last year, residents
had to seek medical treatment. The incident also killed local plants and
wildlife.

[5. [C]{.mark}arbon [C]{.mark}apture **[Trades Off]{.mark}** With Other
Critical Solutions]{.underline}

Wishful thinking about carbon capture isn't just an ineffective response
to the climate crisis --- it's dangerous. We have a small window where
we can take the bold action needed to avert runaway climate chaos.
[[Counting on **carbon capture**]{.mark}**'s effectiveness**
[squanders]{.mark} the [**opportunity** to enact]{.mark} actual
**[emissions reductions]{.mark}**]{.underline} (a phenomenon known as
"mitigation deterrence").

[The reason that the [oil]{.mark} and gas [industry loves
**c**]{.mark}arbon **[c]{.mark}**apture i**[s]{.mark}** simple: [It
**extends** the fossil fuel era]{.mark} instead of ending
it.]{.underline}

Already, dirty energy companies are pitching the construction of new
pipelines and fracked gas power plants. They're also making totally
empty promises about their ability to install capture technology to make
this polluting infrastructure "clean."

[If carbon capture continues to fail]{.underline}, it doesn't matter
much to the company running the dirty power plant. [They will just
continue on with business as usual.]{.underline}

[So long as]{.underline} fossil fuel companies, [government
officials]{.underline}, and even some progressive advocates [are fooled
by carbon capture, there will be less pressure to actually stop climate
pollution]{.underline} by putting an end to drilling and fracking. [[The
**carbon capture mirage**]{.mark} will **[block]{.mark}** any hope for
the [**political will** needed for]{.mark} a
**[rapid]{.mark}**]{.underline} and just [[**transition** to]{.mark}
**100% [renewable]{.mark} energy**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### CCS Increases oil production and use---net emissions increase

**Fern 22** \[NGO cooperating with the EU-based European Commission over
environmental protection; \"Six Problems with BECCS\",

published 3-1-2022, accessed 1-12-2025\]

6 -- [[BECCS is a **barrier** to]{.mark} the [energy]{.mark}
transition]{.underline}

There are already many ways we could reduce fossil fuel emissions
globally, such as reducing unnecessary use, improving efficiency, and
increasing solar and wind. But instead of delivering on those solutions,
the fossil fuel industry is keen to tout BECCS as a fossil fuel-free
source of energy, while expecting governments to pay (directly or via
incentives) for the actual development costs. [BECCS also encourages
continued fossil fuel use in several concrete ways]{.underline},
particularly when it comes to coal and oil.

For example, [[instead of]{.mark} being [decommissioned]{.mark}, many
[coal]{.mark} power [plants are being converted to]{.mark}
allow]{.underline} the co-firing of [[biomass]{.underline}]{.mark} and
coal. [BECCS]{.underline} power [[stations]{.underline}]{.mark} that
allow for co-firing of biomass [with coal would be no
different]{.underline}. Co-firing is envisaged as the way to make BECCS
facilities economically and technically more feasible. Demonstration
projects in the UK and Norway are already testing the CCS of emissions
from co-firing biomass with coal.

Even more worrying is the prospect of using the [[**carbon**]{.mark}
dioxide captured [from BECCS]{.mark}]{.underline} plants [[to extract
oil]{.mark} from depleted oilfields [through]{.mark}]{.underline} a
technique known as **[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}**nhanced
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**il **[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**ecovery
(EOR). [It]{.underline} involves pumping gas at high pressure
underground to drive oil to the surface and [currently
allows]{.underline} a further [5 -15 per cent of oil]{.underline} in
some reservoirs [to be exploited]{.underline}.

[[Carbon]{.mark} dioxide]{.underline} captured from the current
generation of CCS applications (mostly fitted to coal power stations and
high emission industrial plants) [[is already being used on]{.mark} a
considerable scale for [EOR]{.mark}]{.underline}, partly [[**because**
CCS is]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}
technology [[and selling]{.underline}]{.mark} the captured [carbon
dioxide]{.underline} to oil companies [[to help]{.mark} them
**[extract]{.mark}** more [oil is]{.mark} a way of [financing]{.mark}
the investment]{.underline}. For example, a recently completed
largescale retrofit application of CCS to a power plant at Petra Nova in
Texas is expected to pay for itself in less than 10 years as a result of
carbon dioxide being piped for EOR.

Another concern is the possibility of carbon dioxide leakage, which
undermines the climate value of sequestering it in the first place. The
US oil industry estimates that [[about 30 per cent of carbon]{.mark}
dioxide [**piped** to]{.mark} an [EOR]{.mark} site [is]{.mark} directly
**[emitted back]{.mark}** into the atmosphere]{.underline}. If old oil
fields are not capped properly, carbon dioxide held underground may also
find a way out.

#### Turn

#### a. CCS produces toxic [chlorine gas]{.underline}, causing [chemical weaponization]{.underline} AND [amine-modified]{.underline} solutions, which destroy [water]{.underline} supply.

[3. [Carbon **Capture**]{.mark} Relies on Toxic Solvents]{.underline}

[Direct air capture]{.underline} not only [threatens the
climate]{.underline} --- it threatens our public health and safety, too.
That's because [the most "promising" carbon capture technologies [rely
on two]{.mark} kinds]{.underline} of [toxic
[solvents]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The first, [aqueous **hydroxide**]{.mark}]{.underline} solutions,
[[produce deadly]{.underline}]{.mark} and [corrosive [chlorine]{.mark}
gas, which has been [used as a chemical weapon. Scaling]{.mark} DAC
[would produce]{.mark} vastly [**more chlorine**
gas]{.mark}]{.underline} than we currently use, [raising questions about
whether it could be disposed of safely. Capturing just a quarter
of]{.underline} U.S. annual CO2 [emissions would produce [triple the
amount of]{.mark} chlorine [gas]{.mark}]{.underline} that we use
globally.

The second, amine-modified solutions, release chemical carcinogens
during DAC that harm human health, even at very low levels. [[DAC
releases]{.mark} one kind of [amine-modified solution]{.mark} at a rate
[that exceeds toxicity]{.mark} limits [for]{.mark}]{.underline} drinking
[[water]{.underline}]{.mark} and aquatic ecosystems.

The truth is, DAC comes with some nasty side effects --- and [[we don't
have]{.mark} any **[sustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline} or [economical
[solutions to **dispose** of]{.mark} all [these]{.mark} toxic
chemicals]{.underline}.

#### b. Chemical [weapons]{.underline} cascade [globally]{.underline}, causing [extinction]{.underline}.

[[Humanity]{.mark} being [annihilated by **chemical**

sound like the plots of Hollywood disaster movies, but they [are [in
fact **among** the]{.mark} very [real ways mankind could be wiped

[The Global Challenges Foundation]{.underline}---an organization which
aims to reduce the global issues which we all face---[highlighted the
most probable scenarios to finish off the human race]{.underline} in its
annual Global Catastrophic Risks report. To compile the document,
[[researchers assessed]{.mark} scientific [**papers** and]{.mark}
consulted [academics]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Martin [Rees]{.underline}, the U.K.\'s Astronomer Royal, and co-founder
of the Cambridge Center for the Study of Existential Risk,
[warned]{.underline} in the report that while most of us are worried
about familiar risks like air crashes \"[[we\'re in **denial
about**]{.mark} some emergent threats---the potential [downsides of
fast]{.mark}-developing new [tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} and the
risk of crossing environmental \'tipping points.\'

\"These may seem improbable, but [[in our]{.mark} interconnected
[world]{.mark}]{.underline}, their [**[consequences]{.mark}** could
[cascade]{.mark} globally, [causing]{.mark}]{.underline} such
[[devastation]{.underline}]{.mark} that even one such incident would be
too many,\" said Rees.

Nuclear warfare

The likelihood that nuclear war could break out is higher than it was a
decade ago, the experts warned. In the wake of the Hiroshima bombing
which killed up to 150,000 people in the immediate aftermath, \"the
world has lived in the shadow of a war unlike any other in history,\"
they said.

Weapons with the highest yield have the power to obliterate 80 to 90
percent of lifeforms, including humans, in a 1-4 kilometer radius. With
around 7,000 warheads each, the U.S and Russia have the biggest
arsenals, with the U.K., France, China, India, Pakistan, North Korea and
Israel confirmed or believed to possess some form of nuclear device.

A nuclear war could not only wipe out lives and cities, and leave behind
the threat of radioactive disease, but the resulting fallout could
trigger a mini ice-age.

Biological and [chemical warfare]{.underline}

[[Compared with]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[traditional]{.mark} means
of [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}, biological and [chemical [weapons
are]{.mark} relatively [cheap to make]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
[technological [advances]{.mark}]{.underline} in genetic engineering and
synthetic biology [[make it easier]{.underline}]{.mark} than ever [[to

ways]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are several real-world examples of failure to keep gas

Arctic Circle Definition

[The **[most common]{.mark}** and basic **[definition]{.mark}** of the
[**Arctic** defines]{.mark} the region as the [land and sea area north
of the Arctic Circle]{.mark}]{.underline} (a circle of [latitude at
about 66° 34′ North).3 For surface locations [within this zone]{.mark},
[the sun is]{.mark} generally above]{.underline} the horizon [[for 24
continuous hours at least once per year]{.underline}]{.mark} (at the
summer solstice) and below the horizon for 24 continuous hours at least
once per year (at the winter solstice). The land and sea area within the
Arctic Circle is about 8.14 million square miles,4 which is about 4.1%
(or between 1/24th and 1/25th) of the Earth\'s surface, and more than
twice the land area of the United States, which is about 3.5 million
square miles.

The Arctic Circle definition of the Arctic includes the northernmost
part of Alaska---more than one-quarter of the state\'s land area5---as
well as the Chukchi Sea, which separates that part of Alaska from
Russia, and U.S. territorial and Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) waters
north of Alaska. It does not include the more southerly parts of Alaska
or the Bering Sea, which separates that lower part of the state from
Russia.

[[The **Arctic Ocean**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is roughly at the
center of the Arctic region, [[accounts for much of the region\'s total
area]{.underline}]{.mark}. By one calculation, the Arctic Ocean has an
area of about 6.01 million square miles, which is about 4.3% of the
Earth\'s ocean area.6 This figure uses boundaries for the Arctic Ocean
that include some waters south of the Arctic Circle.7 Other sources,
using different boundaries for the Arctic Ocean, put the size of the
Arctic Ocean at about 5.4 million square miles.8

[[Geothermal energy's]{.mark} primary [benefits make it]{.mark} an
[ideal]{.mark} energy candidate [in America's fight against]{.mark}
[c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange.]{.underline} First, geothermal
electricity offers [[clean]{.mark} firm, [reliable]{.mark}, [and
stable]{.mark} baseload [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such[, it easily
complements wind and solar energy]{.underline}, which can fluctuate and
produce only intermittent power. [Not only does geothermal energy offer
more resilient and renewable energy, but]{.underline}----unlike nuclear
and biomass energy and battery storage----[it does so [with no harmful
waste by-products]{.mark}. **[Geothermal energy does not depend on
extractive activities]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., mining)
[[that]{.mark} have a history of [adversely]{.mark} [impact]{.mark}ing
[the environment and Indigenous communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
underlying energy source----the literal heat beneath our feet----is
local, is 100% American, and has demonstrated gigawatt-scale operation
since the 1980s, unlike every other prospective clean energy
technology[. [Geothermal energy offers]{.mark} a [tech]{.mark}nology
that we can export as a service provider and manufacturer to the rest of
the world [to reduce]{.mark} global [GHG emissions]{.mark}, [increase
U.S. energy independence]{.mark}, **[and improve the country's economy
and national defense]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Additionally, climate
change continues to change outside air temperatures and weather patterns
impacting building energy consumptions (e.g., heating and cooling),
which are expected to increase. Geothermal heating and cooling meets
these demands by providing reliable and distributed electricity
generation, winter heating, and summer cooling. Geothermal heating and
cooling offer solutions to other economic sectors that produce harmful
carbon and methane emissions. Getting to net-zero by 2050----and
eventually to 24/7 carbon-free energy----is a community problem, a
public sector problem that affects America's public health, economic
survival, and national security. We can get here if geothermal is
provided the same opportunities that the government has afforded all
other energy technologies. Geothermal Energy: The Forgotten Energy
Technology Today, geothermal power production is at the same
developmental stage that oil production was 100 years ago. Geothermal
power production has been proven at gigawatt scale, but in a limited
range of locations where conventional hydrothermal systems are easily
accessible. Petroleum drilling in the United States began in 1859 and
expanded first in places where oil was visible, easily identifiable, and
quickly accessible. In the 150 years since, continuous market support
from governments and societies has allowed the fossil fuel economy not
just to continue but to expand through technology innovation. Fossil
fuel technologies have matured to the point where engineers regularly
drill seven to eight miles underground, drill in deep ocean water, and
utilize efficient recovery technologies such as steam-assisted gravity
drainage. [[Geothermal]{.mark} carries the same potential to [drive new
technologies of energy production]{.mark} and enable huge increases in
energy recovery and output. However, unlike the petroleum industry,
[geothermal energy has never received]{.mark} comparable and effective
[policy support from the federal and state governments]{.mark} to drive
this needed technology development, innovation, and deployment. As a
result, the geothermal industry has been left behind in the United
States.]{.underline}

#### Understanding climate change as [existential]{.underline} does [not]{.underline} require understanding it as [binary]{.underline} or [linear]{.underline}. Instead, we should understand it as an [ongoing]{.underline}, [non-linear]{.underline} risk to the very [existence]{.underline} of humanity itself.

Within Existential Risk Studies [it is **common** to hear people
ask]{.underline} the question ["**[is climate change]{.mark} an
[existential]{.mark} risk**?", and many who ask this question **answer
negatively**, **arguing** that as a]{.underline} [**result** climate
change is **not an important topic of research**]{.underline} within the
field. However, whether it is answered affirmatively or not, **[this
question is misguided]{.underline}**. There are three reasons for
thinking this. **[First]{.underline}**ly, [it makes **little sense** on
a **probabilistic level**; whether something will be a threat to our
collective existence [is **not**]{.mark} **a
[binary]{.mark}**]{.underline} matter, [[it is a question of
**likelihood**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [However, many researchers within
Existential Risk Studies **mistakenly conflict** existential risk with
events that could be existential catastrophes]{.underline}.
**[Second]{.underline}**ly, [[climate change is **not**]{.mark} **a
single [uniform]{.mark} process** that will affect **everyone** in the
**same way**; [it is]{.mark} a set of [**diffuse impacts** to
**different exposed** populations]{.mark}, **interacting** with
different **vulnerabilities**]{.underline} [and exposures, and
**[activating]{.mark}** different **[risk
cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Richards et al. show, [[it will
**inevitably** interact with]{.mark} a **host** of **other**
threats]{.underline} (not only [**[food security]{.mark}** and
**[societal collapse]{.mark}**, but even]{.underline} [factors such as
the explosivity of **[volcanic eruptions]{.mark}** or the emergence of
**[zoonotic pathogens]{.mark}**]{.underline}),1 [and **these** can
**interact with one another** [to create]{.mark} **reinforcing feedback
loops**]{.underline} [or "**[global systems death
spirals]{.mark}**]{.underline}".2 [**Finally**, " **existential risk**"
is **too vague** and **arbitrary** a concept for the question to ever be
answered. All the definitions of existential risk]{.underline} that have
received the greatest public attention thus far, [such as]{.underline}
Toby [**Ord's**, focused]{.underline} not in terms of an impact on
humanity at any point in time but rather [in terms of "the loss of
**long-term future value**]{.underline}";3 either [referring to the
author(s) particular vision of a high-tech intergalactic utopia, or a
fuzzy undefined idea of "our potential".]{.underline}4

Other authors have practised attribution substitution and sought to
answer an easier question such as "will the direct impacts of climate
change make the Earth uninhabitable?" as a proxy for existential risk,5
or suggested agricultural impossibility as a proxy for civilisational
collapse at a given level of temperature rise.6 These are certainly more
tractable questions, but they are also entirely different questions, and
there is a danger in thinking that answering them is sufficient to
assess the overall level of climate risk.

[[We are **better**]{.mark} **off** **[reverting]{.mark}** back [to
the]{.mark} **common-sense [definition]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
[ex]{.mark}istential [risk]{.mark} [as]{.mark} the [**risk** to]{.mark}
the **[existence]{.mark}** of a given object]{.underline}, [[and
**specifying** whether the object]{.mark} under threat
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[humanity]{.mark} as a whole** ( extinction
risk), **global [industrial society]{.mark}** (collapse risk), [or
**something else**]{.mark} entirely. We should be thinking of an
**overall level of risk** **emergent**]{.underline} [from a particular
socio-ecological system, and **how much** climate change **influences
this** level]{.underline}.7 And [[the **question** we should]{.mark} be
[ask]{.mark}ing about this risk [is **what contribution**]{.mark}**,
under certain scenarios**]{.underline}, **[[climate change will
make]{.underline}]{.mark}**, bearing in mind that it will almost
certainly be operating in tandem with many other drivers of risk.

[[Considering **this**]{.mark} **revised question**
[can]{.mark}]{.underline} also [help to [**rectify** a]{.mark}
**recurring [problem]{.mark}** in the climate risk literature:
**[using]{.mark} mean [global]{.mark} [temp]{.mark}erature** rise [as
the **sole**]{.mark} **threat [indicator]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Authors and activists alike have frequently made a direct link between
the level of warming and the likelihood of global catastrophe, with
**4--6 °C** being **most frequently used**]{.underline} [as this
terrible threshold.8]{.underline} [However, **global surface
[temp]{.mark}erature** [is **only one**]{.mark} of the climate change

be]{.underline}]{.mark} [**entirely [manageable]{.mark}**
[**if**]{.mark} it occurs in a world of **[adaptive]{.mark}

equality, trust in institutions, [and]{.mark} the **[safe
management]{.mark}** of other]{.underline} [planetary

in a world [where other]{.mark}]{.underline} [**planetary

**international [order]{.mark}** [is **riven with

trust, and polarization. [[Understanding]{.mark} the contribution of
climate change]{.underline} to Global Catastrophic Risk [[requires
a]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[**sophisticated** approach]{.mark} which
looks **beyond** the direct impacts of a given level of warming [to
**think through** **fully formed** **climate
scenarios**]{.mark}]{.underline}. We believe that, [when **conceived**

climate change [are **more appreciable** and it is]{.mark} **far [harder

with this assessment, we still maintain that this is the right way to

Our impacts guarantee elimination of the conditions of possibility for all politics and justice, which necessarily precedes individual vectors of injustice.

2.1 Introduction

It is a tragic feature of human cooperation that the most efficacious
allocation of burdens is not always the fairest. In contemporary
political thinking, fairness holds so much weight that we often believe
it better to abandon a common project than to accept an inequitable
distribution of benefits and burdens. Yet, in some cases, the ends of
our shared endeavors are not elective, or are so valuable that we may
think cooperation should proceed regardless of fairness concerns. This
appears true of warfare and diplomacy, for instance, and often also for
healthcare. In such cases, we may hope that our shared goals can be met
without unduly or arbitrarily burdening any particular party.
Nevertheless, trade-offs are often unavoidable, such that we must
sacrifice either some amount of fairness if our goals are to be met, or
of efficacy if uncoerced cooperation is to continue. A fundamental
political problem, then, is determining which should take priority in a
given situation.

In this chapter, I argue that the imperative of preventing climate
catastrophe represents another example of this dilemma. After decades of
inaction, we may no longer be able to limit [**some** of climate
change's most **harrowing**
[effects]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[includ]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[**[sea-level rise]{.mark}**, **[extreme weather]{.mark}**, the
**proliferation** of **[mosquito]{.mark}-borne [diseases]{.mark}**,
**[mass extinctions]{.mark}**, [ag]{.mark}ricultural
**[collapse]{.mark}**, [and **water
scarcity**]{.mark}]{.underline}---without imposing unfair burdens on
some parties. This is particularly clear in the intergenerational
context: [there is likely no way to prevent climate catastrophe unless
those of us alive today make substantial **sacrifices** for the sake of
**future people**]{.underline}, who are widely expected to be wealthier
than we are now. [But the **same** may **also** hold
**intragenerationally**: **effective [precautionary action]{.mark}**
against climate catastrophe **[may require]{.mark}**
imposing]{.underline} [significant [costs]{.mark} or developmental
delays [on]{.mark} relatively [poorer states]{.mark} like **China** and
**India**, for which they may never receive full
compensation.]{.underline}

[[The **tension** between **fairness** and **efficacy**]{.mark} in the
**context of climate change** [has not been]{.mark} very [well
explored]{.mark} in the literature]{.underline}.2 It therefore remains
unclear under what conditions, or to what extent, prioritizing effective
precautionary action over distributive fairness could be justifiable.
This comprises the focus of the present chapter.

I begin, in section 2.2, by considering the possibility [[that **no
trade-offs**]{.mark} between fairness and efficacy [are]{.mark}
**actually [necessary]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This view [[is **popular**
in the]{.underline}]{.mark} intergenerational-justice
[[lit]{.mark}erature]{.underline}; it is [staked on the idea that
current generations should **simply defer the costs**]{.underline} of
presently undertaken action onto richer, future people in the form of
public debt. [For **various reasons**,]{.underline} I argue that
[[this]{.mark} proposal **[fails]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In section 2.3, I turn to an alternative approach developed by Simon
Caney. This approach acknowledges the potential for conflict between the
goals of efficacy in avoiding harm and fairness in distributing burdens,
and offers a sophisticated account of when we might justifiably
prioritize the former over the latter. What results is an improvement
over the intergenerational-justice approach. I argue, however, that
Caney's proposal also falls short in several key respects.

I then advance a new position in sections 2.4 and 2.5. [Broadly, I argue
that [**prioritizing** efficacy **over fairness** is **justified when**
societies]{.mark} are [face]{.mark}d with the prospect of "**[political
catastrophe]{.mark}**." Political catastrophe occurs [when]{.mark}ever
[**material scarcity** is **so extreme**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that
[fair social]{.mark} cooperation [and political stability become
**impossible**]{.mark} **to realize** or sustain. My **essential claim**
is that **[preventing]{.mark}** the **[loss]{.mark}** of the
[**conditions** that **make justice possible** ought]{.mark} to [be
given greater weight than]{.mark} **satisfying [any particular
instance]{.mark}** or application [of justice]{.mark}. **Defining
catastrophe** in **relation** to the **circumstances of justice** helps
**explain** how **precaution** **coheres** with broader theories of
**justice**, making my argument **less ad hoc than alternatives**.
[It]{.mark} also **[clarifies]{.mark}** the **specifically [political
stakes]{.mark}** of precaution: [we should]{.mark} take action **both**
to]{.underline} [[**avoid harm** and]{.mark} to **[prevent
social-institutional collapse]{.mark}**. [The prospect]{.mark} of
collapse [provides]{.mark} a **[strong moral]{.mark}** and **prudential
base** of **[motivation]{.mark}** for **states** and **other**
temporally unbounded **actors** [to act **immediately** and
**decisively**]{.mark} against credible threats.]{.underline}

In section 2.6, I argue that [climate change threatens political
catastrophe and, **given this**, those of us **alive today** are
**obligated** to take **all reasonable measures** to]{.underline}
[**address** it---**including** reducing emissions, **enhancing carbon
sinks**, supporting adaptation measures, and ensuring that losses and
damages do not precipitate extreme scarcity. Moreover]{.underline}, I
claim that [this obligation **must be fulfilled even if** doing so
**conflicts** with **ordinary** principles or rules of
justice]{.underline}.

2.2 Intergenerational-justice approaches One well-discussed example of
conflict between fairness and efficacy in the context of climate change
appears in the intergenerational-justice literature. This stems from the
fact that virtually every economist expects future generations to be
wealthier and more technologically advanced than we are now.3 If future
generations will be better off, then imposing strenuous climate-action
burdens on current generations seems unfair, as it would amount to
requiring poorer people to sacrifice for the benefit of richer ones.4 We
can call this the "intergenerational equity objection" to immediate
climate action, of which there are many examples in the literature.
Robert Lind, for instance, asks: "Can we justify current generations
sacrificing 2--3% of GWP to increase the wealth of future generations
who even after deduction for the high damage scenario are 2--15 times
richer than the present generation?"5 Others have argued similarly that,
even accounting for the likely costs of climate change, "it will be far
more expensive to cut carbon-dioxide emissions radically than to pay the
costs of adaptation"6; accordingly, justice would be better served by
devoting our scarce resources to assisting the global poor alive
today---even if this means continuing fossil fuel-intensive
development.7 Political theorists and climate ethicists have developed
various responses to the intergenerational equity objection, all of
which aim at making space for effective precautionary action without
undercutting the priority of fairness.8 Most commonly, scholars argue
that even if we grant that future generations will in fact be richer,9
imposing climate action burdens on those alive today would nonetheless
be justified so long as the costs of present action can be shifted onto
the future (e.g. through heritable debt).10 In other words, by
separating the costs of climate action from the actions themselves, we
can ensure that the (richer) future pays, and thereby preserve
intergenerational equity. Any apparent conflict between effective
precaution and intergenerational fairness would thus disappear. While on
first blush this proposal seems plausible, on closer inspection a number
of issues arise. Most pressingly, significant doubt exists about whether
shifting costs onto future generations is actually possible. Many
economists argue that wealth can only be transferred between
contemporaries, not generations.11 As Matthew Rendall explains: "it does
not seem possible for the present generation taken as a whole to borrow
money from the future," because any "loan made now comes out of today's
spending and investment, and will in turn be repaid to future people."12
If this is right, then any attempt to borrow must clarify which
contemporary agents should be the debtors and which the lenders, and on
what terms. Doing this while preserving intergenerational equity would
require disaggregating generations, sorting agents with differing
debt-bearing capacities into distinct economic strata, producing some
reliable estimate of how those agents' capacities will change over time
(e.g. will they continue occupying the same economic strata?), and,
finally, selecting a global-justice principle that takes these factors
into account when allocating burdens.13 Suppose for the sake of argument
that this can be done or that some other mechanism for fairly deferring
the costs of present action onto future generations can be found. Two
problems remain. First, even if we could defer some of the costs of
present climate action onto the future, it is nonetheless impossible to
defer all of the costs.14 For instance, effectively addressing climate
change will ultimately entail many workers losing their
jobs---particularly in the fossil-fuel and animal-agriculture
industries. Yet one's occupation is often an integral part of one's
identity and sense of self-respect. (This may be especially true for
those in iconified industries, like farmers or Appalachian coal miners.)
Moreover, many displaced workers may have limited ability to adopt new
professions. These costs and sacrifices cannot be deferred, and
pecuniary compensation can only go so far. Thus, some residual injustice
remains. While this cost of course pales next to that of climate
catastrophe, so long as it cannot be fairly distributed, it represents
another example of the tension between fairness and efficacy. We might
also worry that any plan that proposes transferring costs onto the
future ultimately depends on unverifiable assumptions about future
economic conditions. Should it turn out that future generations are
poorer, or that growth in the costs associated with climate change
outpace general economic growth, then deferring even some of the costs
will turn out to have been unfair. When we defer costs, we take a gamble
with justice that might not bear out. This suggests a broader problem:
to justify any particular program of action, intergenerational-justice
approaches must regard certain assumptions about the future as matters
of fact. This is necessary for specifying unambiguously what each
generation owes to future ones. For our purposes this means that, to
require current generations to act, intergenerational-justice theorists
must maintain that the future effects of unmitigated climate change
will, in fact, be grave. Regardless of scientific consensus about the
anthropogenic origins of climate change, however, it remains impossible
to predict precisely what (or when) climatic changes will occur, or how
such changes will impact human well-being. Consider, for instance, the
IPCC's prediction that a doubling of atmospheric CO2e\[15\] will
"likely" increase global mean temperature by 1.5 to 4.5ºC.16 If warming
falls at the low end, many (though not all) states should be able to
adapt without suffering catastrophic losses. Warming at the high end,
however, is likely to prove devastating for ecological, economic, and
political systems throughout the world. This variability weakens
intergenerational-justice theorists' ability to insist on a particular
allocation of climate-action burdens.17 For if we were to know that
temperature increases will be low, present generations could justifiably
leave the bulk of climate action to the (likely wealthier and more
technologically advanced) future. Conversely, if we were certain that
temperature increases will be great, the case for imposing stringent
burdens on present generations would be much stronger.18 A related issue
is that, in the absence of certainty, the normative motivation for
immediate climate action on intergenerational-justice approaches goes
unstated. Most likely, intergenerational-justice scholars wish to reduce
the likelihood that climate change will overwhelm the response
capacities of future generations, leaving them with an uninhabitable
planet. But if this is right, then these scholars are implicitly relying
on a notion of precaution without considering the implications this
might have for their other theoretical commitments---including the
potential tensions that realizing effective measures may have with
standards of fairness. Even if solutions to these various problems could
be devised, we might still worry that the possibility of deferring costs
provides only a contingent (and thus precarious) justification of
contemporary precautionary climate action. For, on this view, immediate
action is permissible if and only if present generations can in fact
shift costs onto the future. Such a qualified position is likely to be
unsatisfying for anyone centrally concerned with preventing catastrophe.
2.3 Prioritizing precaution: Caney's approach Recent work by Simon Caney
offers another way of navigating conflicts between fairness and efficacy
in responding to the climate crisis. Caney starts with "the assumption
that it is of paramount importance that humanity avoids dangerous
climate change," and acknowledges that it may be impossible to achieve
this without upsetting distributive justice.19 He then attempts to
specify the conditions under which effective preventative action
justifiably takes priority over fairness.20 Central to Caney's argument
is a distinction between "first-" and "second-order responsibilities."
First-order responsibilities cover core climate duties: to "mitigate
climate change," "enable adaptation," "compensate people for harm done,"
and to pick up others' slack in instances of non-compliance.21 While the
claim that such duties exist is uncontroversial, Caney's account leaves
us with a number of unanswered questions. For one, it does not specify
to which agents first-order responsibilities fall, although, considering
Caney's earlier work, it is likely this would be some construal of "the
most advantaged"22---in particular, the most advantaged states.23 Caney
also does not indicate clearly what the normative foundations for these
responsibilities are, though, again judging by his earlier work, the
imperative to prevent harm or the erosion of just entitlements (to
health, safety, and a decent standard of living) likely fulfills this
role.24 Finally, and most pressingly, Caney's account does not specify
under which conditions, if any, first-order responsibilities to prevent
climate catastrophe should take priority over ensuring that burdens are
distributed fairly.25 These ambiguities owe to the fact that Caney is
principally concerned with "second-order responsibilities," which are
those agents have (a) to ensure that others (presumably states) comply
with their first-order responsibilities, and (b) to promote a
normative-institutional context in which preventing climate catastrophe
is likely to succeed.26 Caney's priority argument is meant to apply only
to these second-order responsibilities. His essential claim is that
those who have the power to prevent dangerous climate change (in the
second-order sense) have a responsibility to do so. He refers to this as
the "power/responsibility principle" (hereafter PRP).27 The PRP applies
when the following, jointly sufficient conditions obtain: (1) "humanity
faces a prospect of disastrous harms";28 (2) certain agents have the
capacity to "reduce, or severely limit, the chances of these dire
outcomes" coming to pass;29 (3) moreover, these agents are uniquely able
to prevent catastrophe---which means both that others lack similar
capacities and that "if disaster is to be averted, \[all qualified
agents\] must act";30 (4) there are no "sufficiently weighty
countervailing considerations" that "take priority" over the
responsibility to act.31 Caney argues compellingly that the first three
conditions are satisfied with respect to climate change, and offers a
plausible defense of (4). But a number of issues remain. First, and most
critically, we are looking for a priority argument that applies to
core---i.e. first-order---climate duties. Caney repeatedly insists,
however, that his argument applies only to second-order
responsibilities.32 His reasoning for this appears to be that
first-order responsibilities can be distributed in accordance with a
principle of corrective justice (for past emissions), and so no
trade-off between fairness and efficacy is necessary.33 Yet so long as
it is at least possible that the most efficacious distribution of
climate-action burdens will not be the fairest or must just (however
construed), our original problem remains. Whichever justice principle we
employ, we must still ask: under what conditions and to what extent
should efficacy of action take priority over fairness in the context of
preventing climate catastrophe? One way to answer would be simply to
extend Caney's priority argument to cover first-order responsibilities.
We might stipulate that, whenever the four conditions noted above
obtain, all states (or other relevant actors) with the power to prevent
catastrophic climate change (in a first-order sense) also have the
responsibility to do so. Granting that this extended PRP is possible, we
can consider what problems, if any, it faces.34 Starting with condition
(1), Caney is right to argue that climate change portends serious future
harms if we fail to take decisive and immediate action. But whenever we
speak about the duty to prevent future harms, some account of how
probability affects responsibility is needed. At what point, exactly,
does the threat of climate catastrophe generate a duty to act? Does the
strength of one's responsibility scale up with increased likelihood? Or
is it categorical---i.e. does one have an obligation above a certain
minimal threshold of probability? Caney does not address these issues.
Regarding conditions (2) and (3), two problems arise. First,
particularly with respect to first-order responsibilities, every capable
agent is not needed for effective climate action; a critical mass would
suffice. This is especially clear if we consider that in 2018 the top
ten state polluters alone were responsible for more than 68 percent of
global emissions, while the bottom hundred countries accounted for only
about 3.6 percent.35 Of course, many of the countries between the top
ten and bottom hundred have the power to reduce their emissions
substantially. But their reductions are far less important for
preventing catastrophe; they may even be unnecessary if the top
polluters act. Caney later concedes that, even for second-order
responsibilities, "it may be too strong to say that the intervention of
all \[capable\] agents is necessary," but he holds nonetheless that
"\[w\]hether dangerous climate change is averted ... depends on whether
a sufficient number of ... agents take up these roles."36 The problem
with this is not only the ambiguity surrounding what counts as a
sufficient number; Caney's admission also undercuts the basic
motivational force of the PRP, which holds that "acting on it is
necessary to protect those whose interests are threatened."37 Even
accepting the (sound) assumption that the actions of some capable agents
are necessary to prevent catastrophe, in most cases, complying with the
PRP will not be necessary for any particular agent. Thus, we have a
collective action problem. If the concerted action of a certain number
of capable agents is necessary to avert disaster, but the participation
of any particular agent is unnecessary, then individuals have
considerable incentive to free-ride.38 Without a coordination mechanism
or a principle that can allocate responsibility in instances of
redundancy, how can the PRP be effective?39 This problem becomes more
worrying if we accept that fulfilling climate duties may come at a cost
to an agent's other important values or ends. Then, instead of just
lacking an incentive to comply, agents will have an incentive not to
comply. Perhaps in recognition of this, condition (4) stipulates that
agents possess no "sufficiently weighty countervailing considerations"
that "take priority" over their responsibility to act. While this may
hold true for second-order responsibilities, it almost certainly does
not for first-order ones. Reducing emissions, enhancing sinks,
establishing and financing compensation mechanisms, enabling adaptation,
and so on, are difficult and expensive tasks. This is especially true
for poor states, for which general climate inaction and fossil fuel
industrialization are often still regarded as expedients to essential
developmental gains.40 More importantly, even if costs were not a
concern, we still might worry that condition (4) is tautological and
ambiguous: tautological in the sense that it stakes the priority of
preventative action on the ground that there are no considerations that
take priority over preventative action (and thus asserts what it is
meant to prove); and ambiguous in the sense that it does not indicate
clearly what kind of consideration, if any, would be sufficiently
weighty so as to overpower an agent's duty to act. Thus, while Caney's
account is laudable for directly addressing the essential problem---how
should we balance efficacy and fairness in the context of preventing
dangerous climate change?---it suffers from a number of critical issues
when extended to cover core precautionary duties, like reducing
emissions. Consequently, we are still in need of an account that
explains under which conditions, and to what extent, the value of
efficacy may justifiably take priority over fairness when attempting to
prevent climate catastrophe. 2.4 Alternative justificatory bases for
prioritizing precaution Over this section and the next, I present a new
approach. I argue that prioritizing efficacy over fairness is
justifiable whenever the conditions that make justice and political
stability possible are themselves compromised or credibly imperiled. I
refer to such situations as political catastrophes, a concept introduced
in the introductory chapter and further elaborated later in this
chapter. 2.4.1 Catastrophe The idea of "climate catastrophe" is
frequently invoked when attempting to motivate the need for (or
otherwise justify) precautionary action. But what catastrophe signifies
is not always clear. The most recent OED entry defines it as a "sudden
disaster, wide-spread, very fatal, or signal." Cass Sunstein, on the
other hand, describes catastrophes as instances of harm that "involve a
large number of human deaths."41 Perhaps more stringently, Richard A.
Posner defines them as events that "threaten the survival of the human
race."42 The focus on death in these and many other accounts43
accentuates the moral relevance of precautionary action. Yet we might
wonder if death is a sufficient or even necessary feature of
catastrophe. Are not instances of extreme suffering catastrophic, before
or apart from human death? What about cases of severe political
instability, in which norms, cooperation, and institutions break down?
What I call political catastrophe captures these omitted elements.44
Political catastrophe is not defined by a body count, though it may
follow from, or result in, human death. Rather, political catastrophe is
characterized foremost by a state of extreme material scarcity, in which
one can only meet one's basic needs by denying another (or others) the
ability to do the same. To count as political catastrophe, scarcity must
be enduring, though not necessarily permanent or irreversible; it must
be irremediable by simple local efficiency gains or redistributions; and
it must afflict at least a sizable minority of a given population.45
When extreme and enduring scarcity of this sort occurs, it becomes
impossible to realize or sustain relations of justice and, by extension,
uncoerced forms of social cooperation, all of which critically endangers
the stability of democratic governance structures (or any governance
structure at all). Central to the idea of political catastrophe, then,
is something like John Rawls's "objective circumstances of justice,"
which he defines as "the conditions under which human cooperation \[is\]
both possible and necessary."46 The most important of these
circumstances is "the condition of moderate scarcity," which obtains
when "\[n\]atural and other resources are not so abundant that schemes
of cooperation become superfluous, nor are conditions so harsh that
fruitful ventures must inevitably break down."47 In describing the
latter condition, that of extreme scarcity, Rawls refers to a passage by
David Hume, which describes a society that has fallen into such want of
all common necessaries, that the utmost frugality and industry cannot
preserve the greater number from perishing, and the whole from extreme
misery; it will readily ... be admitted, that the strict laws of justice
are suspended in such a pressing emergency, and give place to the
stronger motives of necessity and self-preservation.48 This passage
makes vivid the idea that, without adequate material resources, justice
becomes difficult (if not impossible) to realize or sustain. Without
redress, such extreme scarcity inevitably leads to social and political
collapse.49 I argue that the imperative of responding to political
catastrophe sanctions deviations from ordinary moral constraints---not
the complete and self-centered abandonment of justice that Hume
portends,50 but rather shifts in the allocation of burdens and benefits
necessary to alleviate or resolve the catastrophe quickly and
effectively. I develop a justification for this claim and address some
potential objections to it in sections 2.4.2 and 2.6, respectively. But
we should note here that something like this idea is already widely, if
often only tacitly, accepted in various contexts. Medical triage offers
a clear example.51 Under normal conditions, clinicians are expected to
"devot\[e\] maximum time and resources to the sickest patients,"52
without respect to morally arbitrary factors like age, weight, expected
recovery time, etc. Yet, when medical supplies are limited and/or
services are under extreme duress, these expectations change, and
factors previously considered arbitrary for allocating medical resources
may become determinative.53 For instance, in the case of vaccine
shortages, officials may justifiably discriminate based on age,
prioritizing the very young and the very old. Likewise, in military
triage situations those patients most likely to recover quickly and
resume action may justifiably be prioritized.54 In short, under
conditions of extreme scarcity, the principles, rules, and values that
normally govern the dispensation of medical care are justifiably
outweighed by---and are subordinated to---higher-order concerns like
saving the most lives, protecting the most vulnerable, or maintaining
the war effort. I claim that the same dynamic holds true in more general
instances of extreme scarcity: the principles and values that normally
guide the moral-political calculus---especially distributive
fairness---may justifiably be subordinated if and to the extent that
doing so is necessary to restore conditions of moderate scarcity, which
constitute the material basis of justice. In this sense, political
catastrophe may be used to define genuine states of exception because it
gives content to the concept of "necessity":55 making exceptions to
moral principles or the legal order is legitimate when doing so is
necessary to preserve or restore the conditions that sustain them.56
2.4.2 Two priority arguments Accepting all of this, however, we must
still ask: are deviations from moral principles justified to prevent
future political catastrophes? (After all, mitigating risk is at the
core of precaution.) And if such deviations are so justified, what makes
them so and to what extent? 2.4.2.1 Contractualist argument One
potential means for justifying the prioritization of efficacy over
fairness in addressing risks of political catastrophe is by adopting an
impartial decision-making framework that melds the perspectives of
justice's beneficiaries and burden-bearers.57 We can model impartiality
within such a framework by prescinding information about the place or
time to which each person taking part in the decision-making process
belongs.58 Therein, participants should assume that the actions or
inaction of some agents can precipitate extreme scarcity for others, and
thus that political catastrophe must be deliberately avoided.59 Ignorant
of their temporal or spatial locations, rational, self-interested agents
occupying such a framework would, I argue, seek to ensure that every
generation takes all reasonable measures to reduce the likelihood of
political catastrophe. Of course, preventative action is not without
costs.60 Thus these agents will also want to ensure that the burdens on
any person or group are not so great that they themselves artificially
induce political catastrophe. Deliberators could therefore be expected
to reject an austerity program that forces extreme scarcity in the
present simply to avoid the same later on.61 Yet it would be rational
for them to accept any necessary burdens falling below this upper limit.
If this is right, then from an impartial perspective---one that
represents the interests of all people and generations62---imposing
strenuous (but not politically catastrophic) burdens on some to prevent
political catastrophe from befalling others is morally justified. Put
another way, from the perspective of the least-advantaged members of the
least-advantaged generation (i.e. those facing political catastrophe),63
precautionary efficacy justifiably outweighs fairness. Thus, should it
be the case that protecting future generations from political
catastrophe is possible only by imposing stringent burdens on earlier,
poorer generations, doing this would be justified. Future generations
consigned to previously preventable political catastrophe would likely
find any other conclusion unacceptable. For them, it would be no
consolation at all to be told that their plight is simply what fairness
required. Anyone at risk of occupying such a position would undoubtedly
prefer an unfair schedule of burdens64 that prevents political
catastrophe to a fair one that does not. 2.4.2.2 Paradox of justice
Another way of justifying the priority of precautionary efficacy over
fairness is suggested by Karl Popper's famous "paradox of tolerance,"
which holds that "\[u\]nlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance
of tolerance." The essential idea here is that if a society tolerates
the expression of all beliefs, including intolerant ones, it may be
unable to sustain tolerance in the long run---particularly if the
intolerant views proliferate. In such a case, "the tolerant will be
destroyed, and tolerance with them."65 Rawls shares Popper's view,
arguing that if "the tolerant \[in a given society\] sincerely and with
reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of
liberty are in danger," they may justifiability "restrict the freedom"
of "intolerant sects."66 A similar paradoxical relationship appears to
hold with respect to justice. That is, if the only way to realize or act
upon a particular conception of justice entails causing or allowing
political catastrophe (which, again, constitutes a dissolution of the
conditions that make justice possible), then it follows that sometimes
remaining just may only be possible at the cost of justice in general.
It therefore seems reasonable to assume that we may limit or subordinate
particular applications of justice when doing so is necessary to ensure
the continued general viability of justice (and, with it, political
stability). Below, I argue that the climate crisis represents just such
a case: that is, that the demands of intergenerational or international
justice may undermine our ability to prevent political catastrophe and
thus sustain the conditions that make justice possible. Consequently,
justice may require accepting some amount of injustice. 2.5 What does
effective precaution entail? So far, I have argued that efficacy should
be prioritized over fairness in the context of responding to or
preventing political catastrophe. Assuming this is plausible, we must
now consider what exactly precaution against political catastrophe
entails. 2.5.1 General precautionary posture We can begin to answer this
question by considering some standard notions of precaution. The
precautionary principle has been largely developed in the context of
environmental policy and law.67 Consider Principle 15 of the Rio
Declaration: In order to protect the environment, the precautionary
approach shall be widely applied by States according to their
capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage,
lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for
postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.
The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) features similar
language, as do the Montreal Protocol, the Maastricht Treaty, and the
Third North Sea Conference.68 While these policy documents refer to
"the" precautionary principle or approach, there is no single,
universally accepted formulation.69 (One scholar has identified nineteen
versions.70) Nevertheless, following Jonathan Wiener, we can delineate a
general "precautionary posture," which includes five elements that are
common to most precautionary principles: (1) "A threat of serious or
irreversible or catastrophic risk or damage." (2) An epistemic position
that does not preclude action on the basis of scientific uncertainty
about the magnitude or likelihood of a given risk. (3) A tendency to
favor "earlier measures" that "anticipate and prevent the risk"
preceding harm. (4) A tendency to favor "greater protection," though
permitting degrees of stringency (from simple preventative measures to
complete prohibitions). (5) A "qualifying stance on the impacts of the
precautionary measures themselves, calling for assessment of their
cost-effectiveness" and "improvement over time as knowledge is
gained."71 In sum, a precautionary posture enjoins agents to act early
to prevent or attenuate major risks or damages, despite uncertainty,
with the intention of securing the greatest protection possible within
reasonable limits. This way of conceptualizing precaution requires
further refinement to be practicable. Some of what we have already said
is useful here. We can stipulate, for instance, that the relevant notion
of (1) is political catastrophe---i.e. this is what precautionary action
is meant to prevent. We have not yet addressed (2), which holds that
agents should not preclude precaution on the basis of uncertainty about
the likelihood of a given risk. While this condition seems reasonable,
it is vague. Most pressingly, we need a clearer idea of what level of
probability is necessary to warrant precautionary action. One
possibility is to stipulate that risks should be "scientifically
plausible" and "reasonably likely" to occur.72 The former requires that
we understand the means by which catastrophe could occur and can explain
that process to others in the language of public reason. Thus, for
instance, even if Ba'al worshippers truly believe that failing to make
certain sacrifices risks planetary destruction, this is a matter over
which people might reasonably disagree, and without a clear way of
settling this disagreement---for instance, by scientific
consensus---there are no compelling grounds for taking public action
against it. The reasonably likely criterion, on the other hand, requires
that the causal mechanisms capable of causing catastrophe are observably
at work. This excludes very remote possibilities from our consideration,
but does not rule out all low-probability or unknown-probability events.
Drawing a line without raising the charge of arbitrariness is difficult
here. A defensible threshold should be sensitive to potential magnitude,
likelihood of occurrence, and societal aversion to risk. One candidate,
suggested by the recent history of US foreign policy, is that
high-impact events with a greater than 1 percent likelihood of
occurrence warrant a response.73 While this may appear overly stringent,
many governments place even more demanding requirements on insurance
companies in relation to their "risk of ruin": the probability that a
surfeit of claims in any given year will push the insurer into
bankruptcy and thus leave policyholders unprotected. For example, as a
recent article in Climatic Change explains, the UK requires that
insurance companies maintain sufficient capital holdings such that their
risk of ruin does not exceed 0.5 percent within a one-year time horizon.
Yet: In practice, insurance companies normally hold sufficient capital
such that the risk of ruin is far lower than this level. Large
reinsurance companies such as Munich Re and Swiss Re typically aim for a
credit rating in the region of AA. An estimate of the average default
probability for corporations rated AA over a one-year horizon is
currently 0.02%.74 The article later observes that "society is currently
running a larger risk" of "climate ruin" than "insurance companies are
prepared or allowed to run with their own solvency."75 This, of course,
seems irrational given the far more encompassing catastrophic potential
of climate change. The key point here, however, is just that, for
whatever threshold of risk we adopt, events falling below it would not
warrant consideration. Henry Shue's "anti-paranoia requirement" offers
additional means for refining our two risk-assessment criteria. Shue
argues that we should only take precaution when (i) "we can understand
the mechanisms by which \[political catastrophe\] would happen," and
(ii) "can see conditions favorable for the working of the mechanisms
arising."76 We can stipulate, then, that for a risk to be scientifically
plausible, (i) must apply; while (ii) must hold for it to be considered
reasonably likely to occur. This precludes action against all merely
conceivable or possible threats of political catastrophe, stipulating
instead that action is warranted only against risks that we understand
and can observe developing. 2.5.2 Normative bases of precaution Points
(3) and (4) of the precautionary posture suggest two distinct normative
bases for undertaking precaution: the duty not to harm others77 and the
duty to protect others from harm, respectively. 2.5.2.1 Negative duty
not to harm The former duty covers cases in which a deliberate action or
omission constitutes a credible risk of significant future harm.78
Following Lukas Meyer and Dominic Roser, we can define harm in relation
to a threshold, such that "an action (or inaction) at time t1 harms
someone only if the agent thereby causes (\[or\] allows) this person's
life to fall below some specified threshold."79 In such cases, an agent
causes or allows others to be worse off than they are "entitled to
be."80 To assess harm in this way, we must specify a particular
entitlement threshold, which (again) is difficult to do without
arbitrariness.81 But the idea of political catastrophe offers one
plausible candidate: a person, P, is harmed whenever the unnecessary
actions or inexcusable omissions of another (or others) causes or allows
P to be in a situation of extreme material scarcity, such that P can
only meet his or her basic needs by denying another (or others) the
ability to do the same.82 We can understand "unnecessary actions" here
in two ways. First are those actions that are necessary for a
satisfactory life but that are undertaken in ways that unnecessarily
exacerbate given risks. A relevant example here is energy production:
while energy is generally considered necessary for a satisfactory life,
the way in which it is currently produced is unnecessarily harmful,
particularly when cost-effective carbon-neutral technologies are
available. Second are actions that contribute to a given risk and yet
are unnecessary for a satisfactory life.83 For example, consuming animal
products appears unnecessary for (and often even detrimental to) a
healthy and satisfying life,84 at least for most people in the West.85
Nevertheless, the livestock sector has exploded in the last fifty years,
particularly in the West, and is now "responsible for 18 percent of
greenhouse gas emissions"---more than all the world's trains, planes,
cars, boats, and other transport vehicles combined.86 The duty not to
harm also proscribes "inexcusable omissions." An omission, or failure to
act, is excusable if the party failing to act is (i) ignorant of the
consequences and (ii) lacks the means to overcome that ignorance.
Otherwise, it is inexcusable. Thus it may be wrong to hold generations
before, say, 1990 accountable for harming present and future generations
with GHG emissions, given the lack of broad scientific consensus about
the causes and effects of climate change up to that point.87 Failing to
take preventative action today, however, is inexcusable, as this
ignorance no longer exists, or, where it does, the means of overcoming
it are readily available. 2.5.2.2 Positive duty to protect The second
normative basis of precaution follows from the positive duty to protect
others from harm.88 Much like the closely related duty to rescue, the
content and scope of the duty to protect are controversial. In standard
formulations, however, the duty to protect holds that when one is able
to prevent harm from befalling another (or others) at reasonable cost to
oneself, then one ought to do so. Here again harm may be defined in
relation to a threshold, such that others (e.g. future people) are
harmed whenever their quality of life falls below a certain level.
Unlike the negative duty not to harm, however, the positive duty to
protect holds whether or not an agent is responsible for the potential
harm. Thus, assuming climate change threatens political catastrophe (a
point I defend below), this duty would require us to undertake
precautionary action even if we were not personally or principally
responsible for causing the risk. While the duty not to harm is
absolute---only ignorance or necessity can excuse deviations---the duty
to protect must have limits or else it will be overly demanding.89 This
is intimated by elements (4) and (5) of the precautionary posture, which
stipulate that, while we should favor a greater degree of protection
over a lesser one, considerations of cost-effectiveness may limit what
actions we take. This again is vague, however. How stringent should we
be in protecting others, particularly against risks of political
catastrophe? A point from the contractualist priority argument laid out
above (section 2.4.2.1) is relevant here. Recall that, from an impartial
perspective, a rational limit to our precautionary duty is given by
political catastrophe itself. In allocating burdens to prevent political
catastrophe, none should be so great that they themselves result in
extreme material scarcity. This prevents precaution from becoming
self-defeating and thus preempts the so-called "black-hole problem,"
which affects principles that prioritize the prevention of worst-case
scenarios.90 The concern is that strictly prioritizing the prevention of
such scenarios would quickly exhaust society's resources. For this
reason, many prefer principles that minimize aggregate or average
deprivation.91 Although my argument gives strict priority to preventing
political catastrophe, it hedges against the black-hole problem by
precluding the complete material sacrifice of any group for the sake of
others. 2.5.3 The pluralist precautionary approach In light of these
considerations, we can formulate a more precise account of our
precautionary climate duties as follows: (1) GENERAL PRECAUTIONARY DUTY:
All agents have a general duty to prevent scientifically plausible,
reasonably likely threats of political catastrophe where possible. This
implies two correlate duties: (a) DUTY NOT TO HARM: Agents should not
harm others. Harm occurs whenever some agents, by their unnecessary
actions or inexcusable omissions, cause or allow political catastrophe
to befall others. (b) DUTY TO PROTECT: Agents should take all reasonable
measures to protect others from harm in the form of political
catastrophe. i. REASONABLENESS PROVISO: The limit of reasonability in
(1b) is given by political catastrophe itself: precautionary burdens
cannot be so great as to themselves cause politically catastrophic
conditions. And to this, we should add the following secondary
principle: (2) FAIRNESS PRINCIPLE: Agents should ensure the burdens of
precaution are distributed fairly to the fullest extent compatible with
satisfying (1a) and (1b).92 Taken together, these principles provide an
account of precautionary duty that balances moral and realist political
commitments. Accordingly, we can hereafter refer to it as the "pluralist
precautionary approach" (or PPA). While novel in structure and
formulation, the PPA has practical implications similar to those of John
Broome's well-known "efficiency without sacrifice" (EWS) proposal.93 For
Broome, "the very most important thing about climate change" is that it
"can be solved without anyone making any sacrifice."94 In other words,
"fixing climate change" is possible, he contends, without imposing
(uncompensated) economic costs on current generations; recognizing this
effectively neutralizes the greatest political objection to immediate
action.95 Notably, this sounds like a version of the
intergenerational-justice argument described in section 2.2. And indeed
Broome accepts one of the basic premises of that argument: that
"\[u\]nless climate change turns out to be much more damaging than
expected, economic growth will continue, so that ... future people will
be better off than we are"; consequently, "\[g\]iving them more benefits
at our expense would be benefitting the rich at the expense of the
poor."96 Critically, however, Broome does not present EWS as a way of
preserving the priority of fairness; on the contrary, he regards it as a
significant moral compromise, in that EWS requires accepting some amount
of unfairness for the sake of motivating people to implement action now
and thereby prevent future harm. Far better than EWS, morally speaking,
would be "efficiency with sacrifice," Broome argues. This is so for a
number of reasons. Perhaps most significantly, EWS essentially amounts
to a "bribe" paid by future people---who, through no fault of their own,
are at risk of grave harm---to those alive today (above all, the global
rich)---who will continue causing harm (via emissions) unless they are
compensated for acting otherwise.97 This suggests serious moral
corruption: current generations should not require a bribe from their
potential victims to fulfill their basic moral duty not to harm others.
Moreover, Broome argues there are strong consequentialist reasons for
preferring policies that require present sacrifices. As he explains,
while "\[o\]ther things being equal, it would be a bad idea to benefit
the rich at the expense of the poor," "if the total of benefits can be
greatly increased by doing so," as he argues would be the case following
an efficiency-with-sacrifice plan, "it may be a good idea."98 In short,
then, Broome believes that the moral balance of reasons is tipped
unequivocally toward policies that would involve present action and
sacrifice. Nevertheless, he endorses EWS as a strategically more viable
position, and one that is at least morally superior to "business as
usual" climate politics: "Aiming for efficiency with sacrifice rather
than efficiency without sacrifice is to encumber the task of fixing
climate change with the much broader task of improving the distribution
of resources between generations."99 In other words, for Broome,
efficaciously responding to the threat of climate change is more
important than satisfying the full requirements of distributive
fairness, and thus should the former become considerably more likely to
succeed if we were to set aside the latter, then we have good reason to
do that.100 Moreover, at least with EWS, Broome argues, we have
something that "is better for some people and worse for no-one."101 To
insist on anything more than that would be to "make the best the enemy
of the good."102 The pluralist precautionary approach (again, PPA)
shares with Broome's view the basic idea that undertaking effective
action must not be made conditional on satisfying the full demands of
distributive fairness. In other words, however regrettable it may be, if
the only viable options we have for responding to the perilous threat of
climate catastrophe are in some way unfair, we must pursue them
nevertheless. Unlike Broome's view, however, the PPA does not locate the
reason for this outside of justice---i.e. by appeal to strategic or
prudential considerations alone. Rather, according to the PPA,
unfairness in the context of preventing climate catastrophe is
permissible for the sake of preserving the conditions that make fairness
possible; thus, we act out of a concern for justice, not in spite of it.
It does not follow from this, however, that the PPA is incompatible with
Broome's EWS proposal. Quite the opposite: should it be the case that an
EWS policy were able to prevent climate catastrophe and be the fairest
option we have among comparably effective proposals, then the PPA would
readily endorse it. The key difference, however, is that the PPA is able
to offer a deeper, more explicitly moral defense of why this would be an
acceptable approach, despite its unfairness. 2.6 Objections to the
pluralist precautionary approach In what remains of the chapter, I
consider several potential objections: (1) that climate change will not
actually be politically catastrophic; (2) that, on various plausible
accounts of intergenerational justice, the PPA is superfluous and so
unnecessary; (3) that the PPA has ambiguous policy prescriptions; and
(4) that the PPA would legitimate the use of dangerously illiberal and
undemocratic emergency powers. 2.6.1 Climate change will not be
politically catastrophic The first objection charges that although
climate change may cause serious future damage, it is unlikely to
precipitate political catastrophe; thus there is no need to undertake
extensive precautionary action, particularly if doing so comes at the
cost of justice. This is an empirical question that we can settle by
examining the evidence. I argue that climate change threatens political
catastrophe both globally and regionally. The former pertains to
climatic changes and events that are worldwide in scope, totalizing in
effect, and irreversible, though unlikely to occur before 2100. The
latter pertains to less severe, but more immediate, climatic changes and
events capable of upending the objective circumstances of justice in
vulnerable states or regions. 2.6.1.1 Globally politically catastrophic

\[i\] As noted above, the IPCC reports that a doubling of CO2e will
"likely" result in a net increase of 1.4ºC to 4.5ºC in mean temperatures
over preindustrial levels. The IPCC defines "likely" as having a 66
percent chance, meaning that if we stabilize CO2e at around 550 ppm---an
ambitious goal, given that the atmospheric stock of CO2e is already in
excess of 400 ppm and continuously rising---there remains a 34 percent
chance that global warming will fall outside the 1.4--4.5ºC range. Note,
however, that it is considerably more likely that temperature increases
will exceed 4.5ºC than fall below 1.4ºC.104 And on one estimate, there
is as much as "a 10% chance of eventual temperatures exceeding 6ºC."105

Although [six degrees of warming]{.underline} may sound innocuous, it
[is enough to **extinguish**]{.underline} or severely endanger much of
**[the planet's plant and animal life]{.underline}**---much as a fever
of 6ºC above normal body temperature is enough to kill a human being.106
According to Nicholas Stern, [with just a 5ºC rise, "\[h\]uman life

**[impossible]{.underline}** in many regions that are currently heavily
populated, thus necessitating large population movements \[... which\]

extensive water scarcity]{.underline}.111 Stern is not alone in
predicting conflict---the White House, the US Department of Defense,

violence arising from global warming. As Martin Weitzman describes,
["\[t\]he **massive unrest** and **uncontainable

\[ii\] Another path to global political catastrophe involves surpassing
"tipping points"---i.e. "thresholds beyond which major changes occur
that may be self-reinforcing and are likely ... irreversible over
relevant time scales."114 These thresholds are typically defined by
specific levels of warming; [[it is **impossible**]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, [[to **predict**]{.mark} **[precise]{.mark}ly**]{.underline}

2.6.1.2 Regionally politically catastrophic climate change Catastrophic
linear temperature increases and many of the most disruptive tipping
points may not occur until the end of the twenty-first century. In the
meantime, however, climate change poses a credible risk of political
catastrophe on a smaller scale, in particular regions and states.119
Economists and policymakers have paid far less attention to this
possibility, perhaps because the changes and events culminating in
regionally politically catastrophic climate change are less sweeping and
may be (partly) remediable through international action. To understand
how climate changes risk regional political catastrophe, note first that
when scientists speak of temperature increases they are typically
referring to global averages. This can obscure the fact that even minor
increases in global mean temperature can entail considerable increases
for certain areas.120 Moreover, tipping points can be
localized---increases of just 1--2ºC can abruptly impact regional
weather patterns, resulting in protracted droughts, topsoil
aridification, etc.121 Warming in the Pacific, for instance, has already
led to considerably more frequent and severe cyclones in east Asia.
Regional climate change does not necessarily entail political
catastrophe. Rather, catastrophe will occur only when affected states'
or regions' anticipatory and response capabilities are overwhelmed and
international assistance is lacking. This suggests two areas on which to
focus precautionary action beyond abatement: (i) ensuring that affected
states or regions are prepared for climatic changes by providing the
necessary resources to implement effective adaptation measures;122 and
(ii) providing assistance or compensation to attenuate the effects of
unavoidable loss and damage.123 2.6.2 Precaution is superfluous A second
objection holds that sufficientarian accounts of intergenerational
justice---like Rawls's just-savings principle or Locke's more inchoate
"enough-and-as-good" proviso---already adequately insure against
political catastrophe by requiring that contemporaries not deprive
future people of adequate material resources. If this is right, then
there is no need for the pluralist precautionary approach (PPA), or
perhaps any other theory of precautionary duty. This objection misses
the difficulties sufficientarian accounts face in the following,
pertinent case: when contemporaries act in such a way that enriches
future people (in pecuniary terms) but also severely depletes or
degrades the natural environment.124 Because accounts like Rawls's and
Locke's assume fungibility between natural and artificial material
resources, even irreversible environmental damage is regarded as
compensable. Accordingly, even if future generations are forced to adapt
to severe environmental austerity, these accounts assume that their
greater wealth and productivity should make this, on balance, acceptable
to them.125 (Hence Brian Barry's observation that, on accounts like
these, a relevant question becomes: what amount of manufactured plastic
trees, astroturf, and singing electronic birds can compensate for the
loss of real trees, real grass, and real birds?126) In this sense,
Rawlsian or Lockean intergenerational sufficientarianism appears to
favor promoting economic growth over preventing environmental loss. It
is by no means clear, however, that adapting to unmitigated climate
change is (or at least will remain) a viable option for future
generations, even granting extensive "wealth" accumulation. Insisting
otherwise requires the implausible assumption that no amount of
ecological devastation can exceed our ability to adapt. This reproduces
the problematic view challenged earlier---that the condition of moderate
scarcity is invulnerable to human action---with the sole difference that
artificial goods are construed here as suitable replacements for natural
goods. The objection thus fails to take seriously the risk of political
catastrophe. So long as credible doubt exists over whether endless
adaptation is possible, precaution remains necessary. 2.6.3 The PPA is
prescriptively ambiguous A third objection holds that it is difficult to
identify minimum requirements for preserving the condition of moderate
scarcity, and this indeterminacy should lead us to reject the PPA, or at
least exclude it from practical deliberation. One way to respond is to
assert a simple baseline: that justice requires material conditions to
be such that all individuals can (continue to) meet their basic needs
without having to deny others the ability to do the same.127 While this
may be vague, defining a more exact threshold is not essential. It
suffices to fix on credible risks of political catastrophe (like those
posed by climate change), and structure our action so as to reduce the
likelihood and/or potential magnitude of those risks as far as we are
reasonably able to do, which is precisely what the PPA prescribes. 2.6.4
The PPA sanctions dangerous state power The final objection holds that
subordinating ordinary moral constraints to efficacy seems to entail
vesting states with dangerous emergency powers, thus opening the door
for authoritarian abrogations of rights, diminutions of democracy, or
other such abuses. For this reason, the PPA should be rejected.
Responding to this concern, and defining the justification and proper
scope of climate emergency powers, comprises the focus of Chapter 3. It
will be helpful to consider a few points here, however. First, there is
no reason to suspect that undertaking precautionary action against
politically catastrophic climate change would require sacrificing any of
the most intimate individual freedoms and rights---e.g. freedoms of
conscience or worship, or the right to peaceably assemble. Moreover, if
fulfilling our precautionary duties were to impinge on individual
rights, it must do so only to the extent necessary for alleviating or
preventing political catastrophe. Of course, any potential limitation of
rights may rightly be considered disconcerting; it is important to
recognize, however, that, should such limitations indeed be necessary,
this would not constitute a break from ordinary politics, inside or
outside of emergency scenarios.128 Consider the possibility of
prohibiting climate disinformation campaigns like those that have been
carried out to great effect for decades by the fossil-fuel industry.129
This would undeniably constitute censorship, and so represent a limit on
free expression. Yet freedom of expression has never been absolute: even
the most liberal thinkers, like J.S. Mill, make exceptions for
harm-inducing speech,130 and even the most liberal states maintain
statutes against libel, hate speech, inciting public riots or violence,
and so on.131 Likewise, in the course of fulfilling our precautionary
duties, we may think it necessary to curtail certain property rights,
for example by prohibiting fossil-fuel producers from developing the oil
assets they already own, or by severely limiting the scope and duration
of green technology patents so as to encourage their propagation. These
measures, again, would not mark a significant departure from normal
practice, particularly during emergencies: it is often thought
legitimate, for instance, to seize and redistribute the stocks of food
suppliers during a famine, or to nationalize and repurpose factories
during a war.132 The same basic point holds with respect to the
possibility of imposing limits on democratic institutions or practices.
There are no plausible grounds for thinking that precaution would
require any of the most serious antidemocratic measures, such as
suspending elections, disenfranchising voters, or instituting fully
dictatorial regimes. (Again, I take this up in far greater detail in
Chapter 3.) Yet a commitment to precaution may lead us to consider
implementing certain limits on what democratic decisions can authorize,
much as ordinary constitutional restrictions already do. For instance,
we might stipulate that, just as no democratic public or representative
government can authorize enslavement, neither can they enact policies
that pose a scientifically plausible, reasonably likely risk of
political catastrophe. We might also consider barring citizens with deep
ties to the fossil-fuel industry from holding certain public offices,
particularly those who have a history of public climate denialism. Again
though, such measures would not constitute a radical break with existing
practices in many places. In postwar Germany and Austria, for instance,
former Nazi Party members were barred from holding public offices; and
so too are convicted felons in Texas133 today.134 These examples suggest
a second line of response, concerning public reason and the weight of
moral duties. Many political obligation theorists maintain that duties
only hold in a pro tanto sense---i.e. that they may be justifiably
outweighed in certain (exigent) circumstances. But these theorists also
carefully stipulate that, while exigency may override duty, it never
erases it. For this reason, an explanation is owed to adversely affected
parties after the fact. Crucially, this suggests a requirement of
accountability. Such a requirement would mean that those (e.g. current
generations) who are to bear the heaviest burdens of preventing
politically catastrophic climate change are owed an explanation,
assuming that overall distribution of burdens is in some plausible way
unfair. Such explanations exist---as this chapter is, in part, meant to
show. But in addition to general explanations, specific explanations for
particular policies are necessary. These should specify clearly who is
responsible for acting, why, when, and how. Accountability can thus
protect against ineffective, unnecessary, or inordinately burdensome
policies. 2.7 Conclusion This chapter has considered under what
conditions, and to what extent, we can justifiably prioritize efficacy
over fairness, particularly in the context of the climate crisis. I
began by surveying two main responses to these questions. The first,
prominent in the intergenerational-justice literature, attempts to avert
any trade-off by separating the costs of climate action from the actions
themselves, and stipulating that the former be deferred to (likely)
richer future generations. With this, the most efficacious distribution
of climate-action burdens (i.e. one that imposes strenuous requirements
on earlier, poorer generations) remains fair. As I showed, however, this
proposal falls short in a number of respects. For one, there is great
uncertainty about the future effects of climate change and the actual
economic situations of future people. More problematically, it is not
clear that costs can actually be transferred between generations; and
even if some could, many more (like the costs of lost employment) simply
cannot, meaning that some injustice will remain. The second response,
advanced by Simon Caney, takes as its starting point the urgent need to
prevent climate catastrophe. It then proceeds to elucidate a set of
conditions under which we would be justified in prioritizing the
prevention of harm over ensuring that the burdens of cooperation are
fairly distributed. While Caney's account is in many ways compelling,
extending it to cover core climate actions---like reducing emissions or
supporting adaptation---proves problematic. Moreover, several of the
conditions Caney sets out are vague (e.g. how likely must a risk of
future harm be before action is justified?; which agents should act when
all are not needed, and why?).

I thus proposed an alternative: [the **pluralist precautionary
approach**]{.underline} (PPA). Like Caney's account, the PPA starts with
the assumption that preventing catastrophe is essential. Yet it [focuses
on a **unique** form of catastrophe]{.underline}: what I call [political
catastrophe]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, again, **[occurs
when]{.underline}**ever [material scarcity becomes so extreme and
enduring that **agents are unable to satisfy their most basic needs**
**without denying another or others the ability to do the same**.
**Under such conditions**, realizing or sustaining fair terms of social
cooperation, and thus political stability, **becomes
impossible**.]{.underline}

[**When** faced with political catastrophe]{.underline}, I argue that
[agents are **justified** in prioritizing **precautionary efficacy**
over fairness.]{.underline} [**Crucially, though**, **this is not for
reasons external to justice** but **for the sake of justice itself**; my
essential claim is that we may relax or suspend particular principles
and rules of justice **if** doing so is necessary]{.underline} [for
**preserving the material conditions that make justice in general
possible**]{.underline}. In practice, this means subordinating
considerations of fairness to those of precautionary efficacy.

This argument has direct relevance to [the problem of climate
change]{.underline}, which, [if left unaddressed, **promises** political
catastrophe on a **global scale**]{.underline}. Regrettably, the only
way to prevent catastrophe at this late stage may involve imposing
unfair burdens on some for the benefit of others. This is especially
clear in the intergenerational context: precautionary climate action is
likely to succeed only if current, (presumably) poorer generations make
potentially substantial sacrifices now for the benefit of (presumably)
wealthier future people. But the same dynamic may hold true
intragenerationally, that is, among states today: it may, for instance,
be impossible to avert catastrophe without imposing unfair costs or
developmental delays on high-emitting but relatively poorer states like
China and India---burdens for which they may never be fully compensated.

[[**None** of this is to say]{.mark} that [**fairness** should
be]{.mark} **totally [evacuated]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the **[political
calculus]{.mark}**. **[Quite the opposite:]{.mark}** **when weighing
comparably effective schemes** of action, [we should always **prefer the
fairest option**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Nevertheless]{.mark}**,
[**if** a **trade-off**]{.mark} between fairness and efficacy [is
**necessary**]{.mark}, then [the **latter must take priority**]{.mark}.
For [political catastrophe is **inhospitable to everything that we
value**]{.mark}**, [fairness included]{.mark}**. A **fundamental end of
government**---and]{.underline} one of [the deepest sources of its
legitimacy135---must be to prevent political catastrophe from arising;
**for [should it fail]{.mark} at this**, **[there can be no
justice]{.mark}, no [rights]{.mark}, no [democracy]{.mark}, and no
[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at least for long.
