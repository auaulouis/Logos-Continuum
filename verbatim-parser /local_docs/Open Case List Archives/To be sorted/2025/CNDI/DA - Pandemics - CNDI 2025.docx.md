[Humanity is facing a bizarre new [pandemic threat]{.mark}]{.underline},
scientists have warned. Ancient [[viruses]{.underline}]{.mark} frozen
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Arctic permafrost]{.mark} **[could one
day be released]{.mark}**]{.underline} by Earth's warming climate [and
[unleash]{.mark} a **[major disease outbreak]{.mark}**]{.underline},
they say.

Strains of these Methuselah microbes -- or **[[zombie
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}** as they are also known -- have already
been isolated by researchers who have raised fears that a new **[[global
medical emergency]{.mark} could be [triggered]{.mark}]{.underline}** --
not by an illness new to science but by a disease from the distant past.

As a result, scientists have begun planning an Arctic monitoring network
that would pinpoint early cases of a disease caused by ancient
micro-organisms. Additionally, it would provide quarantine and expert
medical treatment for infected people in a bid to contain an outbreak,
and prevent infected people from leaving the region.

"At the moment, analyses of pandemic threats focus on diseases that
might emerge in southern regions and then spread north," said geneticist
Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University. "By contrast, little
attention has been given to an outbreak that might emerge in the far
north and then travel south -- and that is an oversight, I believe.
There are viruses up there that have the [[**potential** to **infect
humans**]{.mark} and [start]{.mark} a **[new disease
outbreak]{.mark}**]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

This point was backed by virologist Marion Koopmans of the Erasmus
Medical Center in Rotterdam. "We don't know what viruses are lying out
there in the permafrost but I think [there is a real **risk that** there
might be one capable of triggering a **disease outbreak**]{.underline}
-- say of an ancient form of polio. We have to assume that something
like this could happen."

In 2014, Claverie led a team of scientists who isolated live viruses in
Siberia and showed they could still infect single-cell organisms -- even
though they had been buried in permafrost for thousands of years.
Further research, published last year, revealed the existence of several
different viral strains from seven different sites in Siberia and showed
these could infect cultured cells. One virus sample was 48,500 years
old.

"[The **[viruses]{.mark}** we [isolated]{.mark} were only able to infect
**amoebae** and **[posed no risk to humans]{.mark}**]{.underline}," said
Claverie. "However, that does not mean that **[[other
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[currently frozen in the
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- might not be [[**able** to
**trigger illnesses** in humans]{.underline}]{.mark}. We have identified
genomic traces of poxviruses and herpesviruses, which are well known
human pathogens, for example."

Permafrost covers a fifth of the northern hemisphere and is made up of
soil that has been kept at temperatures below zero for long periods.
Some layers have remained frozen for hundreds of thousands of years,
scientists have discovered.

"The crucial point about permafrost is that it is cold, dark and lacks
oxygen, which is perfect for preserving biological material," Claverie
told the Observer last week. "You could put a yoghurt in permafrost and
it might still be edible 50,000 years later."

But the world's permafrost is changing. The upper layers of the planet's
main reserves -- in Canada, Siberia and Alaska -- are melting as climate
change affects the Arctic disproportionately. According to
meteorologists, the region is heating up several times faster than the
average rate of increase in global warming.

However, it is not melting permafrost directly that poses the most
immediate risk, added Claverie. "The [[danger comes
from]{.underline}]{.mark} another global warming impact: the
[[**disappearance** of **Arctic sea**]{.underline}
**[ic]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**e**.]{.underline} That is allowing
increases in shipping, traffic and industrial
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Siberia. Huge mining
operations are being planned, and are going to **[[drive vast
holes]{.underline}]{.mark}** into the deep permafrost to extract oil and
ores.

"Those operations will release vast amounts of pathogens that still
thrive there. Miners will walk in and breath the viruses. The
**[[effects could be calamitous]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

This point was stressed by Koopmans. "If you look at the history of
epidemic outbreaks, one of the key drivers has been change in land use.
Nipah virus was spread by fruit bats who were driven from their habitats
by humans. Similarly, monkeypox has been linked to the spread of
urbanisation in Africa. And that is what we are about to witness in the
Arctic: a complete change in land use, and that could be dangerous, as
we have seen elsewhere."

Scientists believe that [[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark} --
**[[at]{.mark} its [deepest levels]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- may
**[[contain viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are up to a million
years old and so will be far older than our own species, which is
thought to have emerged about 300,000 years ago.

[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[creating]{.mark} new
[pathways for]{.mark} the [spread of infectious
diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} like brucellosis, tularemia, or E. coli in
the Arctic, according to a broad international consortium of scientists
with a wide range of expertise in human, animal, and environmental
health in the North Pole.The scientists have published their findings in
the journal Science of the Total Environment in which they demonstrate
how the [[melting ice]{.mark} is [opening]{.mark} new [areas for]{.mark}
travel or [industry]{.mark} with people coming into closer
[contact]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [once pristine
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. (DOI:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.176869)They warn that the
[[thawing]{.mark}]{.underline} of soil frozen for thousands of years in
the Arctic could [[unlock dormant microbes]{.mark}]{.underline} housed
in bodies of dead animals and other creatures, [[raising]{.mark} the
[risk of]{.mark} diseases with [pandemic]{.mark}
[potential]{.mark}]{.underline}. The authors recommend measures "to
enhance awareness and management of existing and emerging zoonoses with
epidemic and pandemic potential while also focusing on the impacts of
various environmental stressors and lifestyle factors on zoonoses in the
Arctic." As the ice in the Arctic melts, [[more industries]{.mark} and
people are flocking to the area, [raising the chance for infectious
diseases to spread]{.mark}]{.underline}, says Dr. Khaled Megahed Abass
of the University of Sharjah and a co-author, stressing that
["permafrost thawing could even release ancient bacteria or viruses that
have been frozen for thousands of years]{.underline}." In their
extensive review, the authors analyze scientific studies about and
government documents from the Arctic, with a particular focus on Canada,
Alaska, Greenland, and Northern Europe. "The aim of this investigation
was to understand what lessons we can learn the past to help Arctic
communities better prepare for future health risks," adds Dr. Abbas.
"Climate change and pollution are affecting both animal and human health
--- our research looked into how these two forces are interconnected.
[As]{.underline} the [Arctic warms faster than most other parts of the
world, we're seeing changes in the environment---like [melting
permafrost and shifting ecosystems]{.mark}---that could help
[spread]{.mark} infectious diseases between animals and
people."]{.underline} In scientific jargon, these [diseases
are]{.underline} called [[zoonotic pathogens with]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[ability to jump from wildlife to humans]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially when human activities and animal habitats overlap in a manner
upsetting environmental balance. The pathogens may be parasitic, viral,
or bacterial. They can include unconventional agents with the ability to
spread to humans through different means like water food or the
environment. Climate change is blamed for the erratic and long-term
shifts in the Earth's weather and temperature with scientists reporting
a world that has been warming up quickly in the past decades. The
Earth's [[warming]{.mark}]{.underline} is [[behind the permafrost
thaw]{.underline}]{.mark} -- a process which refers to the melting of
the ice in the frosty soil of Arctic regions. A thawing permafrost [can
[have]{.mark} grave [consequences]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the
[environment]{.mark} and the inhabitants as the frozen soil
melts.]{.underline} The study is an extensive review of the literature
and government documents from the North Pole in which a broad
international consortium of scientists with a wide range of expertise
"describe a selection of case studies highlighting the importance of a
One Health approach to zoonoses in the circumarctic, encompassing human
health, animal health, and environmental health aspects," the authors
write. The significance of the study emerges from the authors' adoption
of and reliance on the One Health approach in analyzing previous
literature and government reports documenting transformations taking
place in the Arctic due to climate change. In their extensive review,
they attempt to sustainably balance and optimize the health of
ecosystems in the Arctic, recognizing that [[health
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether [related to]{.underline}
[people]{.underline}, [animals]{.underline}, plants, or the
[environment]{.underline}, [[are closely linked]{.underline}]{.mark} and
interdependent. The study, according to Abass, shows that "local
communities and researchers have already noticed signs of these changes,
and some are adapting---but many risks are still poorly understood." Dr.
Abass warns that [[what is happening "in the Arctic doesn't stay in the
Arctic. The environmental stressors we studied have ripple effects that
reach far beyond the polar regions]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Climate change
is not only melting ice---it's melting the barriers between ecosystems,
animals, and people. This study shows how [[environmental disruption can
directly impact human health]{.underline}]{.mark}." The authors reaffirm
the need to "enhance awareness and manage Arctic zoonoses with pandemic
potential," underscoring the fact that "about three-quarters of all
known human infectious diseases are zoonotic including Arctic ones" at a
time "[[pollution, climate change and biodiversity loss aggravate
zoonoses transmission in the Arctic".]{.mark}]{.underline} They write,
"The cases highlight critical gaps in monitoring and current knowledge,
focusing on environmental stressors and lifestyle factors, and they are
examples of current occurrences in the Arctic that inform on critically
needed actions to prepare us for the future." Dr. Abass says he and
colleagues authoring the study are upbeat about the interest their
project has already generated. "This research has attracted interest
from outside academia. Public health organizations, environmental
agencies, and even northern industries (like mining and shipping) are
starting to recognize the need to monitor health risks linked to
changing Arctic conditions. This includes policymakers concerned about
pandemic prevention and food safety in remote areas." The authors see
their comprehensive review as a [[warning]{.mark} for
"[governments]{.mark} and communities [to]{.mark} [take]{.mark}
[action]{.mark} early---[before]{.mark} [outbreaks]{.mark}
occur.]{.underline} It supports the development of better disease
surveillance, more robust environmental monitoring, and
climate-resilient public health systems. The study also shows the
importance of indigenous knowledge in detecting early signs of ecosystem
and health changes." The study [[highlights]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[importance]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [international]{.mark}
[cooperation]{.mark} coupled with transdisciplinary research
collaboration.]{.underline} The fact that the findings stem from an
international consortium involving over 15 institutions across Europe
and Canada, notes Dr. Abass, is a sign "of the significance of
multidirectional knowledge exchange, thematic networks and
internationalization in addressing climate change issues in the Arctic".

Several [**epidemics**, such as the Black Death and the Spanish flu,
have]{.underline} [**threaten**ed]{.underline} **[human
life]{.underline}** [**throughout history**; however, it is]{.underline}
**[unclear]{.underline}** [if humans]{.underline} [will]{.underline}
**[remain]{.underline}** [safe from the]{.underline}
**[sudden]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[fast spread of epidemic
diseases]{.underline}**. Moreover, [the transmission]{.underline}
**[characteristics]{.underline}** [of epidemics remain]{.underline}
**[undiscovered]{.underline}**. In this study, [we present]{.underline}
the results of [**a**n epidemic]{.underline} **[simulation
experiment]{.underline}** [revealing the relationship between epidemic
parameters and pandemic risk]{.underline}. To analyze the time-dependent
risk and impact of epidemics, we considered two parameters for
infectious diseases: the recovery time from infection and the
transmission rate of the disease. Based on the epidemic simulation, we
identified two important aspects of human safety with regard to the
threat of a pandemic. First, humans should be safe if the fatality rate
is below 100%. Second, even when the fatality rate is 100%, humans would
be safe if the average degree of human social networks is below a
threshold value. Nevertheless, **[certain]{.underline}**
[diseases]{.underline} **[can]{.underline}** potentially **[infect all
nodes in]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** **[human]{.underline}**
**[social]{.underline}** **[networks]{.underline}**, and
[these]{.underline} diseases [cause a pandemic when the average degree
is]{.underline} **[larger than the threshold]{.underline}**
[value.]{.underline} [These]{.underline} results indicated that certain
infectious [diseases]{.underline} **[lead to human
extinction]{.underline}** and can be prevented by minimizing human
contact. 1. Introduction [The emergence of a]{.underline}
**[pandemic]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} one of the various scenarios
frequently discussed as [a]{.underline} **[human extinction
event]{.underline}**, and it is listed as [one of the
global]{.underline} **[catastrophic]{.underline}** [risks in studies
regarding the future]{.underline} \[1,2,3\]. In particular,
[several]{.underline} pandemics, [such as]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[Black Death]{.underline}** \[4,5\], [Spanish flu]{.underline} \[6\],
and those caused by **[smallpox]{.underline}** \[7\], severe acute
respiratory syndrome (**[SARS]{.underline}**) \[8\], [and]{.underline}
**[Ebola]{.underline}** \[9\], [have]{.underline} [affected
a]{.underline} **[large population]{.underline}** [throughout history.
The]{.underline} [risk]{.underline} [of pandemics]{.underline}
**[increases]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} [an increase in
population]{.underline} **[mobility]{.underline}** between cities,
nations, and continents, thereby [threatening]{.underline}
**[humankind]{.underline}** \[10,11,12\]. [It is essential to analyze
the epidemic spread in]{.underline} **[society]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[minimize]{.underline}** the **[damage]{.underline}**
from epidemic disasters; however, extinctive epidemic spreading
experiments have limitations in real-world situations, as they predict
stochastic effects on the spread without considering the structure of
human society. Network-based approaches have been proposed to overcome
these limitations and perform epidemic spreading simulations by
considering the network structure of numerous real-world connections
\[13,14,15\]. These methods use various models of epidemic spreading,
such as the susceptible--infectious--susceptible (SIS) \[16,17,18\],
susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) \[19,20,21\], and Watts
threshold models \[22\]. While these methods are mathematically
convenient, they are epidemiologically unrealistic for various
infections because they require exponentially distributed incubation and
infectious periods \[23,24,25\]. Moreover, previous epidemic studies did
not perform quantitative assessment of the pandemic risk depending on
the network connectivity in individuals and fatality rate of various
diseases \[26\]. In the present study, we applied an SIR epidemic model
to a scale-free network with Monte Carlo simulation to identify the
quantitative relationship between infectious diseases and human
existence. Our fundamental hypothesis states that [when the epidemic
spreads to all]{.underline} **[nodes]{.underline}** of the network and
the fatality rate is 100%, [it can increase the]{.underline}
**[pandemic]{.underline}** [risk]{.underline}. To address this, we
initially constructed a scale-free network to simulate a society.
Moreover, for the epidemic spreading simulation, an SIR model was
applied to the network to describe the immune state of an individual
after infection. From the simulation study, we found that the mean
degree of a scale-free network was an essential factor in determining
whether epidemics threaten humans. This approach provides important
insights into epidemic spreading analysis by investigating the
relationship between epidemic and scale-free network parameters.
Furthermore, it highlights the necessity of determining information flow
during an epidemic. 2. Materials and Methods [We designed an
epidemic]{.underline} **[simulation process]{.underline}** to identify
the relationship between pandemic risk and network parameters. This
study was performed in four steps (Figure 1): (i) generating a
scale-free network model to reflect real-world conditions; (ii) applying
an SIR model to the scale-free network for epidemic spreading
simulations; (iii) adapting the Monte Carlo method to reflect the
stochastic process in the node status of the SIR model; and (iv)
iteratively performing simulation for every parameter set and analyzing
the results. We have provided the source code and sample results of
epidemic simulation in Supplementary Materials. Figure 1. Overview of
epidemic simulation process based on the Monte Carlo method. (A) We
generated scale-free networks for a fixed population (N = 1,000,000) and
various node degrees (k = 2, 5, 7, and 10). (B) Epidemic spreading was
simulated by applying a susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) model
to the scale-free network. We set the epidemic parameters, β and γd. β
represents the spreading rate of epidemics, and γd is the reciprocal of
γ and reflects the time interval between infection and recovery.
Randomly, 0.05% of nodes were initially infected. (C) [We adapted
the]{.underline} **[Monte Carlo method]{.underline}** [to determine the
status of the transition]{.underline} from the infection node to
immunization node. Repeated simulations were performed until a steady
state was achieved. (D) For every parameter set, 10,000 simulations were
performed. 2.1. Network Generation Based on a Scale-Free Model We
constructed a network model for the epidemic spreading simulation
(Figure 1). The nodes and edges of the network represent people in the
society and their physical contacts, respectively. We used a scale-free
network model, which follows the preferential attachment property
observed in numerous real-world networks, such as social networks,
physical systems, and economic networks \[27,28,29\]. In the scale-free
network, when a node is added to the network, its likelihood of
connecting to existing nodes increases with an increase in the node's
degree. Hub nodes, which lead to fast and vast spreading of epidemics,
exist. Two characteristic parameters, including N and k, affect the form
of scale-free networks. The parameter N denotes all nodes in the
network. In the real world, N indicates the whole population size. The
parameter k is the average degree of the network, which determines the
degree of the newly attached node for each step during network
generation. Following the characteristics of the network model, we
generated scale-free networks representing human contacts for epidemic
spread. The scale-free network was generated by the Barabasi--Albert
graph distribution, in which the network is constructed from a cycle
graph with three vertices, followed by the addition of k edges at each
construction step \[30\]. The k edges are randomly attached to the
vertex based on the degree distribution of the vertex. After network
generation, we investigated the degree distribution properties of the
network (Figure 2). The results indicate that the degree distributions
have similar tendency for networks with varying number of nodes and
edges. This study constructed scale-free networks with the largest
number of nodes considering computational complexity (N = 1,000,000).
Figure 2. Degree distribution of the scale-free network. We analyzed the
degree distribution of the network based on the number of nodes (N) and
mean degree (k). 2.2. Epidemic Spreading Based on the SIR Model For the
epidemic spreading simulations, we applied an SIR model to the generated
scale-free network. The classical SIR model can be expressed by the
following nonlinear differential equations \[21\]: where S, I, and R
represent susceptible, infected, and recovered compartments,
respectively, in the whole population. S represents people who have not
been infected yet but can be infected in future. I represents infected
people who can spread the epidemic to susceptible people through
physical contact. R denotes people who have recovered or died from the
epidemic and who no longer participate in the epidemic spreading
process. The sum of the S, I, and R values represents the whole
population size N. Epidemics have two parameters in the SIR model,
transmission rate (β) and recovery rate (γ), which arise from the basic
reproduction number R0 (Figure 1B). The basic reproduction number is the
number of infections caused by one infective node \[31,32,33\]. If the
R0 is more than 1, the infection can spread in a population, whereas if
R0 is less than 1, the infection cannot spread. We express the basic
reproduction number as R0 = β/γ, where β represents the spreading rate
of epidemics between infective nodes and adjacent susceptible nodes and
γ represents the probability of recovery from infection \[34\]. We
mainly used γd, which is the reciprocal of γ and reflects the time
interval between infection and recovery. 2.3. Investigation of Epidemic
Status Based on the Monte Carlo Method The epidemic simulation was
performed for a time series event by constructing epidemic status matrix
(z) to represent the status of the nth node at time step t. For each
node, the value of epidemic status matrix at time step t can be 0, 1, or
2, indicating that a node is susceptible, infective, or recovered,
respectively. We initially (t = 0) set every value of epidemic status
matrix to 0 because all nodes are susceptible before the epidemic
spreads. At the initial infection stage, randomly selected 0.05% of
nodes were infected. At every time period, we performed immunization and
observed the infection stages (Figure 3). At the immunization stage, we
identified infective nodes and determined whether these nodes would be
recovered in the next time step. To calculate the transition probability
of infected and recovered phenomena, the Monte Carlo method was applied
\[35,36\]. When infection and recovery parameters are provided, it is
possible to investigate whether a node transitions from an epidemic
state to another state. To accomplish this, we compared the method
revealing the change in each population in every compartment over time
(Figure 4). The final steady state of the epidemic spreading simulation
model indicates the total number of casualties of the epidemic who
either are dead or have recovered from the disease. Infective nodes at
time t (zn \[t\] = 1) are transformed to recovered nodes at time t + 1
(zn \[t + 1\] = 2) when 1/γd is larger than a random real number between
0 and 1. We determined whether the neighbor nodes of the infection node
would be infected by identifying susceptible nodes adjacent to the
infective nodes at time t (zn \[t\] = 0, with the adjacent infective
node) (Figure 5). When β is larger than a random real number between 0
and 1, a susceptible node becomes an infective node at time t + 1 (zn
\[t + 1\] = 1); this scenario represents epidemic spread. For each time
step, we recorded the number of susceptible, infective, and recovered
nodes during epidemic spread. 2.4. Simulation Parameters We carried out
simulation trials for various mean degrees of networks (k = 2, 5, 7, and
10). Each network considered the following epidemic parameters: β ranges
from 0.05 to 0.95 and γd ranges from 1 to 10. The Monte Carlo model was
repeatedly simulated to observe saturation of the recovery process.
Considering that the simulation pipeline contains random processes such
as initial infection and Monte Carlo trials, we performed the simulation
iteratively until the status of nodes remained unchanged. After
simulation, time series data from every simulation were interpolated in
the time domain. The fatality rate determines the ratio of deceased and
recovered individuals in the final population \[37,38,39\]. If the
fatality rate is below 100%, the recovered population contains both dead
and recovered individuals. Such a situation does not always cause a
pandemic. In this simulation, we assumed a 100% fatality rate. To
accomplish this, we enumerated the recovered nodes as dead for
considering the pandemic risk. 3. Results Through our method, we
obtained epidemic spreading data with various network and epidemic
parameter sets. In the present study, we focused on the case where the
epidemic infects all nodes and defined this phenomenon as "extinctive
spread". [[Diseases causing]{.underline}]{.mark} [**extinctive**
spread]{.underline} [are potential candidates of]{.underline} **[high
pandemic risk]{.underline}**. In the real world, [extinctive spreading
indicates]{.underline} that the [disease]{.underline} [will]{.underline}
**[infect every person]{.underline}** **[in the society]{.underline}**.
From the simulation data, we calculated the extinctive spread score by
dividing the total number of simulation trials by the number of
extinctive spread cases. Thereafter, we identified that the number of
extinctive spread cases is mainly influenced by spreading speed, which
is determined by β, γd, and k (Figure 6). The extinctive spread region
(brown area in Figure 6) is expanded as the value of mean degree of
network (k) is increased, thereby indicating that the area of extinctive
spread becomes noticeably wider in a dense network than in a sparse
network. Thus, the more contact between people, the higher the risk of
epidemics. Moreover, high γd and high β cause extinctive spread across a
large region, indicating that the high spreading rate and short time
interval between infection and recovery are risk factors of epidemic
diseases. In contrast, the infective nodes recover before they transmit
the disease to their neighbors in low β and low γd scenarios, thus
disconnecting the network and preventing extinctive spread. This occurs
because the infective nodes need more time to transmit the disease in
low β and high γd scenarios. Therefore, the disease begins to subside
due to a lack of new infective nodes. Furthermore, we investigated the
range of β and γd for existing epidemics of the common cold \[40,41\]
and fatal diseases, namely, cholera \[42,43\], Marburg \[44,45\], Ebola
(Congo and Uganda) \[46,47,48,49\], SARS \[50\], and MERS \[51\] (Table
1). We selected diseases with relatively well-known epidemic parameters,
such as average duration of infection and basic number of reproductions
from previous studies. Transmission rates were calculated using the mean
duration of infectious periods and basic reproduction numbers of the
epidemics. Different studies reveal multiple values of infectious period
and transmission rate for some of these diseases; we considered these
values separately \[40,41,42,43,46,47,48,49\]. For example, the
infectious period of a common cold is from 3 to 7 days and that of Ebola
is 6.5 days. Next, we placed the possible regions of these epidemics as
a disease band for various k values (colored lines in Figure 6). When k
\> 5, fatal diseases have an opportunity to cause a pandemic. Even when
k = 5, diseases such as cholera and Ebola (Congo) can be threatening in
regions of low γd and high, thus demonstrating that the knowledge of
network parameters of the society and the characteristics of epidemic
diseases can aid in quantifying the risk of epidemics. 4. Discussion
[Many]{.underline} **[previous]{.underline}** [studies]{.underline}
[have]{.underline} [made]{.underline} **[stochastic]{.underline}**
[SIR]{.underline} [models]{.underline} [to analyze the dynamics or
stability of epidemic diseases]{.underline}. They investigated the
distribution of susceptible, infected, and removed populations for
specific epidemic disease spreading, such as cholera, SARS, Marburg, and
MERS, based on mathematical modelling \[52,53,54,55\]. [However,
they]{.underline} [did not conduct]{.underline} [a]{.underline}
**[quantitative]{.underline}** [assessment]{.underline} [of pandemic
risk taking into account]{.underline} **[physical contact between
people]{.underline}**. To solve this limitation, we performed epidemic
spreading simulations by applying an SIR model to scale-free networks
with Monte Carlo simulation. In the simulation, [we
consider]{.underline} **[various]{.underline}** [connectivity
and]{.underline} **[disease]{.underline}** [characteristics]{.underline}
on scale-free networks. For each network and epidemic parameter set, the
probability of extinctive spread was calculated. [The]{.underline}
[results]{.underline} [**reveal**ed that]{.underline}
**[certain]{.underline}** **[infectious]{.underline}**
**[diseases]{.underline}** **[can]{.underline}** **[lead
to]{.underline}** **[extinction]{.underline}**. Moreover, even if the
disease band extends over the extinctive spread regions, it does not
indicate that human extinction results from the disease, as the fatality
rate is below 100%; however, in the case of 100% fatality, the disease
can cause a human extinction event. The risk of infectious disease is
influenced by the network structure. A dense network has a higher risk
of spreading infectious disease than a sparse network, as we observed in
the extinctive spreading maps. According to our results, when the
average degree of human social networks is below the risk threshold,
i.e., less than 4 in this study, human society is safe from an
extinctive outbreak based on our knowledge regarding the epidemic
parameters of the infectious disease. Nevertheless, in other cases,
**[human extinction]{.underline}** [is possible]{.underline}. For
example, if the population is 1,000,000 and there are 4 or more
instances of physical contact between people, human extinction events
may occur, depending on the fatality rate of the epidemics. Hence,
physical contact between people is closely related to an extinction
event of infectious diseases. Eventually, from a public health
perspective, lowering the average contact level of society is an
appropriate way to increase the robustness of strategies against the
occurrence of extinction. In the real world, reducing network density
can be accomplished by epidemic prevention activity, such as isolation
and quarantine treatment. This action prevents epidemic risk to the
society, thereby avoiding human extinction. Additional considerations
may improve our analysis. First, large population size and various
proportions of initial infective nodes were not considered in the
experiments. We have confirmed that the result was consistent when the
proportion of initial infective nodes was 0.05% of the total population;
however, this can vary depending on the distinct proportion of initial
infective nodes in a different population. To achieve robust results, we
need to perform additional experiments for various parameters; however,
we could not address this issue due to computational complexity. Second,
we did not consider numerous known epidemic diseases. We calculated the
transmission rates of epidemic diseases using the known infectious
periods and reproduction numbers of the epidemics from evidence in the
literature. In the present study, we only considered five epidemic
diseases, since the information on infectious periods and reproduction
numbers of diseases was mostly unavailable for other epidemic diseases.
Third, this study only considers the SIR model on scale-free networks in
epidemic simulation. Since the dynamics of epidemic diseases can be
varied in different models or networks, it is important to experiment in
various simulation environments to confirm the robustness of the
results. Nevertheless, these limitations can be considered in future
experiments or using improved computational methods. With these further
improvements, our approach can be used as a computational tool to
analyze the risk of epidemic diseases. 5. Conclusions In this study, we
analyzed the risk of epidemic diseases by creating an epidemic
simulation on a scale-free network. [Based on the]{.underline}
**[simulation results]{.underline}** for various epidemic parameters,
[we]{.underline} **[confirmed]{.underline}** that
**[certain]{.underline}** [infectious diseases]{.underline} **[can lead
to extinction]{.underline}** and can be prevented by minimizing human
contact. We believe that [identifying]{.underline} potential
**[candidate]{.underline}** [diseases]{.underline} that may lead to

**[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is not]{.mark} truly [interested
in]{.mark} competing for [the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It has
relatively less military, economic, or ideational interest in the region
when compared to Russia or China. Its strategic plans for the region
have become increasingly assertive in reaction to Russia's and China's
efforts, but lack funding or prioritization. However, this lack of
genuine interest carries some benefits for the US when considering the
larger geopolitical context of the international system. America's lack
of interest in the region has paradoxically pushed the other Arctic
states to increase their security ties with the US and to take on more
security responsibilities for the region. Similar to World War II, when
Iceland and Denmark invited the US to help protect their territory from
foreign adversaries, Russia's aggression pushed Sweden and Finland to
formally petition to join the US-dominated NATO. The inclusion of these
states into the organization means that half of the Arctic will soon be
administered by NATO member states. Specifically, the Nordic states of
Norway, Sweden and Finland have significant capabilities and economic
stakes in the region that will make up for America's relative lack of
willingness and ability to contain Russia's and China's ambitions in the
region. These countries' capabilities will be further complemented by
Denmark and Canada, and the other non-Arctic NATO states that have
recently increased their defense spending to deal with Russian
aggression. This collective defense in the Arctic will allow the US to
better focus on domains like space, cyberspace, the Americas, and the
Indo-Pacific, which are more important than the Arctic to America's most
critical national interests. **[Economically speaking, the [Arctic
will]{.mark} likely [remain a backwater for market-driven
economies]{.mark} for the foreseeable future. The relatively [high costs
of extracting resources and transporting goods]{.mark} from the Arctic
[means the region is unlikely to become]{.mark} much more [attractive
for Western companies,]{.mark} [even if the ice continues to
retreat]{.mark} (which has slowed in recent years) [and icebreakers
improve]{.mark},]{.underline}** except in times when specific resources
are in sharp demand or when there are long-term bottlenecks in other
trade routes. The resources that Russia and China extract from the
Arctic will contribute to the overall global supply of these resources
and decrease their overall price for American consumers. As such,
Americans will gain many of the benefits of Russia's and China's efforts
in the Arctic while Russia and China absorb the costs. In the case of
scarce rare-earth minerals that have spiked in demand and are
monopolized by China, it appears Sweden may fill this void for the US
with its own Arctic resources, even as companies search for substitutes
for these critical resources. Overall, the US should not ignore the
Arctic, and it should put to rest the notion that this region is a
unique zone of peace in an otherwise quite turbulent world. That being
said, Americans should also not deem that losing the "race for the
Arctic" will critically threaten America's larger national interests. By
not attempting to compete head-to-head with Russia or China to "conquer"
the region, the US has incurred some advantages against these
competitors. As the US has been reminded again in Iraq and Afghanistan,
and through its observation of Russia's disastrous invasion of Ukraine,
conquering territory comes with significant costs that can weaken the
material strength and ideational attractiveness of a country. This, in
turn, weakens a country's ability to secure its most significant
national interests. The US should continue to diplomatically,
militarily, and economically challenge Russia's and China's actions in
the Arctic on humanitarian and environmental grounds, but it also should
identify that China's and Russia's actions in the Arctic come with high
economic and soft power costs that may relatively benefit the US. Doing
so will allow the US to increase its ability to collectively defend its
interests in the Arctic with its allies and to prioritize its attention
and resources on domains that are more important to it than the Arctic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has re-focused attention on mechanisms that lead
to zoonotic disease spillover and spread. Commercial wildlife trade, and
associated markets, are recognized mechanisms for zoonotic disease
emergence, resulting in a growing global conversation around reducing
human disease risks from spillover associated with hunting, trade, and
consumption of wild animals. These discussions are especially relevant
to people who rely on harvesting wildlife to meet nutritional, and
cultural needs, including those in Arctic and boreal regions. Global
policies around wildlife use and trade can impact food sovereignty and
security, especially of Indigenous Peoples. **[We reviewed known
zoonotic pathogens and current risks of transmission from wildlife
(including fish) to humans in North American Arctic and boreal biomes,
and evaluated the epidemic and pandemic potential of these
zoonoses.]{.underline}** We discuss future concerns, and consider
monitoring and mitigation measures in these changing socio-ecological
systems. [**While [multiple zoonotic pathogens circulate]{.mark} in
these systems, [risks to humans are]{.mark} mostly [limited]{.mark} to
individual illness or local community outbreaks. These [regions
are]{.mark} relatively [remote, subject to very cold
temperatures,]{.mark} have relatively low wildlife, domestic animal, and
pathogen diversity, [and]{.mark} in many cases [low density]{.mark},
including [of humans]{.mark}. [Hence, favorable conditions for emergence
of novel diseases or major amplification of a spillover event are
currently not present.]{.mark}** The [greatest risk]{.mark} to northern
communities from pathogens [of pandemic potential is]{.mark} via
introduction with [humans visiting from other
areas]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, Arctic and boreal ecosystems are
undergoing rapid changes through climate warming, habitat encroachment,
and development; all of which can change host and pathogen
relationships, thereby affecting the probability of the emergence of new
(and re-emergence of old) zoonoses. Indigenous leadership and engagement
in disease monitoring, prevention and response, is vital from the
outset, and would increase the success of such efforts, as well as
ensure the protection of Indigenous rights as outlined in the United
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Partnering with
northern communities and including Indigenous Knowledge Systems would
improve the timeliness, and likelihood, of detecting emerging zoonotic
risks, and contextualize risk assessments to the unique human-wildlife
relationships present in northern biomes.

#### Development in the arctic exacerbates disease spread

Arctic shipping as a disease spreader. **[[Increased shipping and
accelerating development are closely tied in the Arctic and present a
significant risk for disease spread]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is
great interest in a trans-Arctic shipping route between the Atlantic and
Pacific Oceans because it could shave five days off the current transit
time through the Suez and Panama Canals for voyages between Asia,
Europe, and eastern North America. Shipping interests eagerly anticipate
the point when the trans-Arctic Sea routes are ice-free year-round.
It\'s uncertain whether industrial and commercial development in the
Arctic will continue apace in the short run. The Russia-Ukraine war has
somewhat dampened enthusiasm for trans-Arctic shipping, as have the
ongoing threat of sea ice blockages and problems maintaining **[[land
infrastructure crucial to both shipping and oil and gas
exploration]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including pipelines. But absent some
reversal of climate warming or a global economic shock, shipping
activity in the Arctic is expected to only go up. Over the last decade,
Arctic shipping has certainly done so, as measured by overall ship
traffic, distances sailed, and the striking example of the Mary River
iron mine in Baffinland, where traffic in the nearby port of Milne Inlet
jumped 583 percent in five years. Ship traffic to and from the Mary

PAME Arctic Shipping Status Report Ships move about 10 billion tons of
ballast water around the world annually. Ships typically dump their
ballast water, which helps maintain ship stability, in port and take in
new water for the next journey. Expanded Arctic shipping brings with it
a severe threat of microbe exchange between more southerly and Arctic
waters. David Lodge, professor at Cornell's Atkinson Center for
Sustainability, has studied the explosion of invasive species in the
world's ports and coastlines. There is little data on the Arctic, so he
stresses he is speculating, but says, "I think ships are the more likely
way to bring quite novel organisms including microbes into the Arctic
and out of the Arctic." The Russian city of Murmansk is the port with
the highest risk of spreading invasive species, according to a 2016
paper by Notre Dame University computer scientist Mandana Saebi and
colleagues. Most of the Murmansk traffic moves between Russian ports and
those in Nordic countries. But many voyages also connect with ports to
the south; for example, some voyages stopping at Murmansk also visit
West African ports. **[[This could exacerbate the spread of polar
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}** southward and move tropical diseases
**[[into regions with expanding human presence that are rapidly losing
permafrost and sea ice.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Tourist ships can also be
a source of microbe exchange. The Arctic Council's shipping survey found
that the number of cruise ships in the Arctic jumped from 58 in 2013 to
96 in 2023, and cruise ships remain the sixth largest ship type behind
fishing and cargo ships. One experiment found that antibiotic shoe wash
placed where tourists moved on and off their ship did not effectively
reduce their shoes' microbial load. The passengers in the study visited
the Svalbard archipelago, where concerns about microbial invasions
affecting the terrestrial ecosystem are high. Workers drill for gas

and disease transmission Clearly, **[[the more people move around, the
higher the risk of disease transmission]{.mark}. In the Arctic, the
most]{.underline}** mobile population is likely the pool of extractive
industry workers. A 2019 demographic atlas of the Arctic found that "the
highest share of working-age population was in regions where a high
proportion of employment is related to extracting natural resources,
e.g. oil, gas and minerals. This is especially the case in the Russian
Arctic regions." Some of these workers are residents, but industrial
activity bringing in "non-resident male worker populations" is likely a
pipeline for rapid dispersal of infectious diseases. According to a 2019
analysis from University College London, such transitory workers often
live in "camp-like conditions" that encourage "increased demand for
commercial sex and, thereby, potentially human trafficking." Because of
the rapid travel patterns and cramped living quarters typical of
extractive operations, "you don't need a huge dispersal of a pathogen,"
Mora says. You just need person-to-person transmission in close quarters
and one infected person to carry the disease quickly to a more populated
area.

**However, it is not [melting permafrost]{.underline} directly that
poses the most immediate [risk]{.underline}, added Claverie. "The danger
comes from another** [global warming impact]{.underline}**: the
disappearance of [Arctic]{.underline} sea ice. That is allowing
increases in shipping, traffic and industrial [development]{.underline}
in Siberia. Huge mining operations are being planned, and are going to
drive** [vast holes into the deep permafrost to extract oil and
ores.]{.underline} "Those [operations will release vast amounts of
**pathogens**]{.underline} **that still thrive there. Miners will walk
in** [and]{.underline} **breath the viruses. The [effects could be
calamitous]{.underline}."This point was stressed by Koopmans. "If you
look at the history of epidemic outbreaks, one of the key drivers has
been change in land use. Nipah virus was spread by fruit bats who were
driven from their habitats by humans. Similarly, monkeypox has been
linked to the spread of urbanisation in Africa. And that is what we are
about to witness in the Arctic: a complete change in land use, and that
could be dangerous, as we have seen elsewhere." Scientists believe that
[permafrost -- at its deepest levels --]{.underline} may [contain
viruses that are up to a million years old]{.underline}** [and so will
be far older than our own species]{.underline}, which is thought **to
have emerged about 300,000 years ago. "Our** [immune systems may have
**never been in contact with**]{.underline} **some of** [those
**microbes**]{.underline}**, and that is another worry," said Claverie.
"The** [scenario of an unknown virus]{.underline} once infecting a
Neanderthal coming back at us, although unlikely, has become [[a
real]{.mark} possibility]{.underline}**." For that reason, Claverie and
others are working with UArctic, the University of the Arctic -- an
international educational network in the polar region -- on plans to
establish quarantine facilities and provide medical expertise that could
pinpoint early cases and treat them locally to try to contain the
infection.**

[Permafrost]{.underline}, or permanently frozen land, [covers around 23
million square kilometres in the northern hemisphere]{.underline}. Most
of the permafrost in the Arctic is up to a million years old --
typically [the deeper it is, the older it is]{.underline}. [In addition
to microbes, it has housed a diverse range of chemical compounds over
millennia]{.underline} whether through natural processes, accidents or
deliberate storage[.]{.underline} However, with climate change causing
the Arctic to warm much faster than the rest of the world, it is
estimated that up to two-thirds of the near-surface permafrost could be
lost by 2100. [Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases -- carbon
dioxide and methane -- to the atmosphere, as well as causing abrupt
changes to the landscape.]{.underline} However, research, published
recently in Nature Climate Change, found the **[implications of waning
permafrost could be much more widespread -- with potential for the
release of bacteria, unknown viruses]{.underline}, nuclear waste and
radiation, [and other chemicals of concern.]{.underline} The paper
describes how deep permafrost, at a depth of more than three metres, is
one of the few environments on Earth that has not been exposed to modern
antibiotics.** [More than 100 diverse microorganisms in Siberia's deep
permafrost have been found to be antibiotic resistant.]{.underline} [As
the permafrost thaws, there is potential for these bacteria to mix with
meltwater and create new antibiotic-resistant strains]{.underline}.
Another risk concerns by-products of fossil fuels, which have been
introduced into permafrost environments since the beginning of the
industrial revolution. The Arctic also contains natural metal deposits,
including arsenic, mercury and nickel, which **have been mined for
decades and have caused huge contamination from waste material across
tens of millions of hectares. Now-banned pollutants and chemicals, such
as the insecticide dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane, DDT, that were
transported to the Arctic atmospherically and over time became trapped
in permafrost, are at risk of re-permeating the atmosphere. In addition,
increased water flow means that pollutants can disperse widely, damaging
animal** and bird species as well as entering the human food chain.
[There is also greater scope for **transportation of pollutants,
bacteria and viruses**. More than 1000]{.underline} settlements, whether
resource extraction, military and scientific [projects, have been
created on permafrost during the last 70 years. That]{.underline},
coupled with the local populace, [increases the likelihood of accidental
contact or release]{.underline}. Despite the findings of the research,
it says the risks from emergent microorganisms and chemicals within
permafrost are poorly understood and largely unquantified. It states
that further in-depth research in the area is vital to gain better
insight into the risks and to develop mitigation strategies. The
review's lead author, Kimberley Miner, from NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said, "We have a very small understanding of what kind of
extremophiles --- microbes that live in lots of different conditions for
a long time --- have the potential to re-emerge. These are microbes that
have coevolved with things like giant sloths or mammoths, and we have no
idea what they could do when released into our ecosystems.

[Genetic analysis of soil and lake sediments from Lake Hazen, the
largest high Arctic freshwater lake in the world, suggests the risk of

first time -- may be higher close to melting glaciers. The findings
imply that as global temperatures rise owing to climate change, it
becomes more likely that viruses and **[[bacteria locked up in glaciers

their range also shifts closer to the poles]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For
instance, in 2016 an outbreak of anthrax in northern Siberia that killed
a child and infected at least seven other people was attributed to a
heatwave that melted permafrost and exposed an infected reindeer
carcass. Before this, the last outbreak in the region had been in 1941.
To better understand the risk posed by frozen viruses, Dr Stéphane
Aris-Brosou and his colleagues at the University of Ottawa in Canada
collected soil and sediment samples from Lake Hazen, close to where
small, medium and large amounts of meltwater from local glaciers flowed
in. A 2015 image of the Kebnekaise massif in Sweden. The south peak of

Next, they sequenced RNA and DNA in these samples to identify signatures
closely matching those of known viruses, as well as potential animal,
plant or fungal hosts, and ran an algorithm that assessed the chance of
these viruses infecting unrelated groups of organisms. The research,
published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, suggested that the risk
of viruses spilling over to new hosts was higher at locations close to
where large amounts of glacial meltwater flowed in -- a situation that
becomes more likely as the climate warms. The team did not quantify how
many of the viruses they identified were previously unknown -- something
they plan to do in the coming months -- nor did they assess whether
these viruses were capable of triggering an infection. However, other

Humanity is facing a bizarre new pandemic threat, scientists have
warned. [**[Ancient viruses frozen in the Arctic permafrost
could]{.mark} one day [be released by Earth's warming climate and
unleash a major disease outbreak]{.mark}**, they say.]{.underline}
Strains of these Methuselah microbes -- or zombie viruses as they are
also known -- have already been isolated by researchers who have raised
fears that a new global medical emergency could be triggered -- not by
an illness new to science but by a disease from the distant past. As a
result, scientists have begun planning an Arctic monitoring network that
would pinpoint early cases of a disease caused by ancient
micro-organisms. Additionally, it would provide quarantine and expert
medical treatment for infected people in a bid to contain an outbreak,
and prevent infected people from leaving the region. "At the moment,
analyses of pandemic threats focus on diseases that might emerge in
southern regions and then spread north," said geneticist Jean-Michel
Claverie of Aix-Marseille University. "By contrast[, [little attention
has been given to an outbreak]{.mark} that might emerge in the far north
and then travel south -- [and that is an oversight]{.mark}]{.underline},
I believe. **[[There are viruses]{.mark} up there [that have the
potential to infect humans and start a new disease
outbreak]{.mark}]{.underline}**." This point was backed by virologist
Marion Koopmans of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. ["We don't
know what viruses are lying out there in the permafrost but I think
[there is a real risk that there might be one capable of triggering a
disease outbreak]{.mark}]{.underline} -- say of an ancient form of
polio. We have to assume that something like this could happen." In
2014, Claverie led a team of scientists who isolated live viruses in
Siberia and showed they could still infect single-cell organisms -- even
though they had been buried in permafrost for thousands of years[.
Further [research]{.mark}, published last year, [revealed the existence
of several different viral strains from seven different sites in Siberia
and showed these could infect cultured cells]{.mark}.]{.underline} One
virus sample was 48,500 years old[. "The viruses we isolated were only
able to infect amoebae and posed no risk to humans," said Claverie.
"However, that does not mean th**at other viruses -- currently frozen in
the permafrost -- might not be able to trigger illnesses in humans. [We
have identified genomic traces of poxviruses and herpesviruses, which
are well known human pathogens]{.mark},**]{.underline} for example."
"The crucial point about permafrost is that it is cold, dark and lacks
oxygen, which is perfect for preserving biological material," Claverie
told the *Observer* last week. "You could put a yoghurt in permafrost
and it might still be edible 50,000 years later." But the world's
permafrost is changing. The upper layers of the planet's main reserves
-- in Canada, Siberia and Alaska -- are melting as climate change
affects the Arctic disproportionately. According to meteorologists, the
region is heating up several times faster than the average rate of
increase in global warming. However, it is not melting permafrost
directly that poses the most immediate risk, added Claverie. "**[The
[danger comes from another global warming impact: the disappearance of
Arctic sea ice]{.mark}. [That is allowing increases in shipping, traffic
and industrial development ]{.mark}]{.underline}**in Siberia. [[Huge
mining operations are being planned, and are going to drive vast holes
into the deep permafrost to extract oil and ores.]{.underline}]{.mark}
["Those operations will release vast amounts of pathogens that still
thrive there. Miners will walk in and breath the viruses. The effects
could be calamitous."]{.mark}

Factors such as close contact with animals, traditional consumption of
harvested wildlife, crowded housing, co-morbidities, severity of climate
change and extreme weather events as well as poor access to health care
and clean water increase risk of zoonotic infectious diseases (Barnes et
al., 2020; Hennessy and Bressler, 2016; Hueffer et al., 2013; Huot et
al., 2019; Revich et al., 2022). These factors occur in many Arctic
communities, and several studies highlight these risks and the limited
attention they are given (e.g., Campagna et al., 2011; Dudley et al.,
2015; Goyette et al., 2014; Huot et al., 2019; Jenkins et al., 2013;
Lévesque et al., 2007; Parkinson et al., 2014; Revich et al., 2012;
Sampasa-Kanyinga et al., 2013). Traditional circumpolar food systems are
both of immense importance in the Arctic and highly vulnerable to
pathogens and contaminants. This creates accentuated exposure risks to
Indigenous communities, while at the same time, these risks are a
challenge to survey and zoonotic infections are likewise a challenge to
detect (Keatts et al., 2021; Stimmelmayr and Sheffield, 2022). Disease
dynamics in the Arctic are already changing due to climate driven range
expansion and in some circumstances subsequent major epidemics have
occurred (Forde et al., 2016; Kafle et al., 2020; Kutz et al., 2015;
Mavrot et al., 2020; Seru, 2023). Global warming, toxic biomagnifying
industrial long-range transported pollutants, biodiversity loss and
increasing [**[human activities in the Arctic]{.mark}** (e.g., mining,
over-fishing, and increased ship traffic) **[are likely to amplify
endemic disease transmission and facilitate invasion and establishment
of invasive hosts and pathogens]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Davidson et al.,
2011; Desforges et al., 2016;For example, wildlife species may expand
their habitat range northwards due to climate change causing an increase
in transmission of endemic pathogens or introducing pathogens novel for
local, pristine Arctic species This occurs concurrent with other
contemporary wildlife stressors, mentioned above, some of which may be
reaching levels of immune-suppression . In addition, ancient pathogens
are re-emerging from thawing permafrostA recent study by Lemieux et al.
(2022) utilizing a metagenomics approach showed that viral spillover
risk increases as more runoff from glacial melt occurs with e.g., global
warming. Considering the likely shifting species range of potential
vectors and reservoir animal hosts northwards, Lemieux et al. (2022)
suggested that the Arctic could be the origin of emerging pandemics.
Keatts et al. (2021) [however, argued that, thus far, **[the low density
of humans]{.mark}** and animals along with a cold climate **[has limited
the risk of pandemics originating from Arctic regions.]{.mark} [But
this]{.mark}** relatively **[low risk may change in the near future due
to anthropogenic factors that alter host-pathogen-environment
relationships.]{.mark}** Despite this, zoonoses in the circumpolar
Arctic remain neglected infectious diseases which have received lower
study effort and financial support compared to diseases occurring in
more temperate latitudes]{.underline}. The reasons for this neglect may
be demanding logistical conditions, relatively low population density,
lack of coordinated effort and funding, and misconceptions of the Arctic
as an environment possessing low microbial activity. Recent global
epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19 and highly pathogenic avian
influenza (Lane et al., 2024) have underscored the significance of
existing knowledge gaps with regards to Arctic zoonoses, but have also
offered insight into One Health-related themes specially related to
wildlife and the environment, and societal factors which complicate
management of disease outbreaks (Fig. 1). 1.1. Towards more coherent
research-efforts on zoonoses in the Arctic An estimated 75 % of emerging
infectious diseases (EIDs) are zoonotic (in origin or current
transmission) and of these, around 72 % originate from wildlife (Jones
et al., 2008), while ca. 63 % of all known human and animal infectious
diseases are defined as climate sensitive (McIntyre et al., 2017).
Microbes and their community composition, function, physiological
response and evolutionary adaptation are inherently sensitive to climate
change (Cavicchioli et al., 2019) and zoonotic diseases are generally
more climate sensitive than infectious diseases, in part due to their
wider host ranges and modes of transmission including vector-borne and
environmental transmission (McIntyre et al., 2017; Naicker, 2011

[Permafrost]{.underline}, or permanently frozen land, [covers around 23
million square kilometres in the northern hemisphere]{.underline}. Most
of the permafrost in the Arctic is up to a million years old --
typically [the deeper it is, the older it is]{.underline}. [In addition
to microbes, it has housed a diverse range of chemical compounds over
millennia]{.underline} whether through natural processes, accidents or
deliberate storage[.]{.underline} However, with climate change causing
the Arctic to warm much faster than the rest of the world, it is
estimated that up to two-thirds of the near-surface permafrost could be
lost by 2100. [Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases -- carbon
dioxide and methane -- to the atmosphere, as well as causing abrupt
changes to the landscape.]{.underline} However, research, published
recently in Nature Climate Change, found the **[implications of waning
permafrost could be much more widespread -- with potential for the
release of bacteria, unknown viruses]{.underline},** nuclear waste and
radiation, [**and other chemicals of** **concern.**]{.underline} The
paper describes how deep permafrost, at a depth of more than three
metres, is one of the few environments on Earth that has not been
exposed to modern antibiotics. [More than 100 diverse microorganisms in
Siberia's deep permafrost have been found to be antibiotic
resistant.]{.underline} [As the permafrost thaws, there is potential for
these bacteria to mix with meltwater and create new antibiotic-resistant
strains]{.underline}. Another risk concerns by-products of fossil fuels,
which have been introduced into permafrost environments since the
beginning of the industrial revolution. The Arctic also contains natural
metal deposits, including arsenic, mercury and nickel, which have been
mined for decades and have caused huge contamination from waste material
across tens of millions of hectares. Now-banned pollutants and
chemicals, such as the insecticide dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane,
DDT, that were transported to the Arctic atmospherically and over time
became trapped in permafrost, are at risk of re-permeating the
atmosphere. In addition, increased water flow means that pollutants can
disperse widely, damaging animal and bird species as well as entering
the human food chain. [**There is also greater scope for transportation
of pollutants, bacteria and viruses**. More than 1000 settlements,
whether **resource extraction, military and scientific projects, have
been created on permafrost during the last 70 years.
That**]{.underline}**,** coupled with the local populace, **[increases
the likelihood of accidental contact or release]{.underline}**. Despite
the findings of the research, it says the risks from emergent
microorganisms and chemicals within permafrost are poorly understood and
largely unquantified. It states that further in-depth research in the
area is vital to gain better insight into the risks and to develop
mitigation strategies. The review's lead author, Kimberley Miner, from
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, said, "We have a very small
understanding of what kind of extremophiles --- microbes that live in
lots of different conditions for a long time --- have the potential to
re-emerge. These are microbes that have coevolved with things like giant
sloths or mammoths, and we have no idea what they could do when released
into our ecosystems.

[Increased]{.underline} shipping **[and [accelerating
development]{.mark}]{.underline}** are closely tied [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[present a significant risk for disease
spread]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is great interest in a trans-Arctic
shipping route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans because it could
shave five days off the current transit time through the Suez and Panama
Canals for voyages between Asia, Europe, and eastern North America.
Shipping interests eagerly anticipate the point when the trans-Arctic
sea routes are ice-free year-round. It\'s uncertain whether industrial
and commercial development in the Arctic will continue apace in the
short run. The Russia-Ukraine war has somewhat dampened enthusiasm for
trans-Arctic shipping, as have the ongoing threat of sea ice blockages
and problems maintaining land infrastructure crucial to both shipping
and oil and gas exploration, including pipelines. But absent some
reversal of climate warming or a global economic shock, shipping
activity in the Arctic is expected to only go up. Over the last decade,
Arctic shipping has certainly done so, as measured by overall ship
traffic, distances sailed, and the striking example of the Mary River
iron mine in Baffinland, where traffic in the nearby port of Milne Inlet
jumped 583 percent in five years. Ships move about 10 billion tons of
ballast water around the world annually. Ships typically dump their
ballast water, which helps maintain ship stability, in port and take in
new water for the next journey. [[Expanded Arctic shipping brings with
it a severe threat of **microbe exchange**]{.underline}]{.mark} between
more southerly and Arctic waters. David Lodge, professor at Cornell's
Atkinson Center for Sustainability, has studied the explosion of
invasive species in the world's ports and coastlines. There is little
data on the Arctic, so he stresses he is speculating, but says, "I think
ships are the more likely way to bring quite novel organisms including
microbes into the Arctic and out of the Arctic." The Russian city of
Murmansk is the port with the highest risk of spreading invasive
species, according to a 2016 paper by Notre Dame University computer
scientist Mandana Saebi and colleagues. Most of the Murmansk traffic
moves between Russian ports and those in Nordic countries. But many
voyages also connect with ports to the south; for example, some voyages
stopping at Murmansk also visit West African ports. [[This could
exacerbate the spread of polar diseases]{.underline}]{.mark} southward
and [move tropical diseases into regions with expanding human presence
that are rapidly losing permafrost]{.underline} and sea ice. Tourist
ships can also be a source of microbe exchange. The Arctic Council's
shipping survey found that the number of cruise ships in the Arctic
jumped from 58 in 2013 to 96 in 2023, and cruise ships remain the sixth
largest ship type behind fishing and cargo ships. One experiment found
that antibiotic shoe wash placed where tourists moved on and off their
ship did not effectively reduce their shoes' microbial load. The
passengers in the study visited the Svalbard archipelago, where
[concerns about microbial invasions affecting the terrestrial ecosystem

Permafrost thaw is one of the gravest yet lesser discussed impacts of
climate change. **[[Permafrost covers 24 percent of]{.mark} the surface
of land masses in [the northern hemisphere]{.mark} and accounts for
nearly half of all organic carbon stored within the planet's
soil.]{.underline}** As long as this organic matter remains frozen, it
will stay trapped in the permafrost. However, if it thaws, microbes will
begin to eat the material, causing it to decay and releasing carbon
dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Even if a small fraction of
these greenhouse gases are released, it will have major consequences on
not only the Arctic, but Earth's entire climate system, as they
intensify global climate change. **[[Permafrost temperatures]{.mark} are
[rising]{.mark} at a much [faster]{.mark} rate [than]{.mark} the
temperature of the [air in the Arctic, and have risen]{.mark} between
[1.5 to 2.5 degrees Celsius]{.mark} in the last 30 years. As a result,
permafrost layers are melting. A [3 degree Celsius increase]{.mark} in
global [temperatures]{.mark} could [melt 30 to 85 percent of]{.mark} the

degradation buckles roads, compromises homes, and changes the landscape
of a homeland to four million people, it is without a doubt one of the
most serious threats to people both within and beyond the Arctic in this
century. The Arctic Institute's new two-part series examines permafrost
thaw from different perspectives in an effort to understand and
contextualize this complex phenomenon. The first part will be published
this September, October, and November 2020, while the second part will
follow in winter 2021. The papers in this series include personal
encounters with permafrost thaw, scientific analyses of the issue,
reflections on how permafrost thaw affects North American security and
economics, and artistic initiatives aimed at education. The Institute
also aims to host several webinars with guest experts who will further
discuss and analyze the implications of permafrost degradation and how
it affects not only the Arctic, but the rest of the world. We look

In the unusually hot summer of 2016, a bacterium that causes anthrax
killed more than 2,500 reindeer in Siberia's remote Yamal Peninsula,
according to one study. Normally locked deep in a layer of permanently
frozen land, or permafrost, the once-dormant pathogen eventually spread
to humans, claiming the life of a 12-year-old boy and causing dozens of

say it could unleash a wave of potentially deadly microbes that for
centuries have been trapped in ice. That threat is being highlighted in

in warmer climates for centuries, with pathogens hopping between people

but it's happening in a new place." Experts worry that diseases from

contains an estimated 1,500 gigatonnes of carbon, about twice as much as
the atmosphere. As permafrost thaws, its carbon is broken down and
released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide or methane. Those
greenhouse gases warm the planet further, melting more permafrost in a
potentially catastrophic cycle. To avert runaway climate change and
disease outbreak, Hinwood says the world must rein in the greenhouse
gases driving climate change. Countries also need to continue to monitor
receding permafrost and invest in charting the types of microbes that
reside there. "At the moment, we are very much in an 'if-and-maybe
scenario'," she says. "There is a lot of uncertainty and the best we can
do is use the tools and science we have to inform ourselves."

The impact of human activities on species often results in demographic
changes, with some of them declining in numbers and others increasing.
Such changes have an impact on the pathogen pressure and can push a
parasite to broaden its spectrum of hosts. In addition to the abundance
of the host, [[there are other parameters affecting pathogen pressure
that could be considered, such as the natural history of the infection
(duration, intensity, and severity of infection and shedding), the
behavior and movements of the hosts, and the efficiency of its spread
(density, demographics and health of host).]{.underline}]{.mark} But the
impact of the biodiversity crisis affects primarily the density and
distribution of hosts, and this is what is highlighted in the following
paragraphs. Several documented examples show that biodiversity loss can
release carriers of human disease agents from predation and competition
(Civitello et al. 2015, Gascon et al. 2015). In the past decades, human
activities have resulted in a substantial reduction and degradation of
natural habitats. The IPBES Global Assessment Report estimates that 75%
of land surface, 65% of oceans and 85% of wetland areas are
significantly altered or lost altogether (Díaz et al. 2019), including
the damming of most major rivers (Chao et al. 2008, McCartney 2009) and
the degradation of a majority of freshwater habitats (Vörösmarty et al.
2010, García-Moreno et al. 2014). This has affected the population sizes
of many species, with many wildlife populations declining and often
brought to the brink of extinctions even when the species is not
actively hunted, to the point that many are becoming functionally
extinct (Maxwell et al. 2016, WWF 2016, Ceballos et al. 2017). Also,
common species of low conservation concern show dwindling population
sizes and range shrinkages. Rosenberg and colleagues (2019) reported a
decrease of almost 3 billion breeding birds in Canada and the United
States in comparison with numbers from 1970 (almost one-third of the
breeding population), mostly due to habitat loss and degradation; a
similar large-scale decrease is presumed for Afro-Palearctic birds
(Morrison et al. 2013, Vickery et al. 2014). Across all terrestrial
vertebrate orders, the proportion of species with decreasing populations
is staggering, with large species, so-called megafauna, particularly
badly hit (Ceballos et al. 2017). Amphibians, although they are
generally small, are the most threatened terrestrial animal class of
vertebrates, with estimates of between 30% and 45% of species on the
brink of extinction and many species having recently become extinct in
the wild (Collins and Crump 2009, Bishop et al. 2012). At the same time,
the human population and that of domestic animals have exploded, to the
point that the biomass of people and livestock combined outweigh that of
all terrestrial vertebrates (Bar-On et al. 2018). There are currently
roughly 8 billion people, 1.5 billion cows, 1 billion goats, over 1
billion sheep, another 1 billion pigs, 50 million horses, and just short
of 25 billion chickens (FAO 2023). The biomass of humans and livestock
combined surpasses that of wild mammals by over 20 times, with the
present-day biomass of wild mammals seven times lower than that of the
period before this accelerated extinction (Barnosky et al. 2011). As a
consequence of this dynamic, the original host reservoirs have shrunk,
and the pressure for spillovers has increased: From a pathogen\'s
perspective, it has now become very attractive to be able to establish
complete infection cycles in humans or domestic animals. At a local
scale, [[there are many man-made perturbations that alter the original
patterns of species distribution and abundance.]{.underline}]{.mark}
This can result in situations with relatively few but very abundant
species: [[the reduction or removal of predators or competitors, habitat
fragmentation limiting host species dispersal, invasive species,
pollution or enrichment of nutrients, etc.]{.underline}]{.mark} (Dobson
and May 1986). [[When the species that benefits from these alterations
is also an efficient human--pathogen host, the pathogen pressure
increases proportionally.]{.underline}]{.mark} Examples of such species
and the parasites they host are listed in table 1.

perspectives on the risk of pathogenic viruses from thawing permafrost",

Climate change is inducing wide-scale permafrost thaw in the Arctic and
subarctic, triggering concerns that long-dormant pathogens could
reemerge from the thawing ground and initiate epidemics or pandemics.
Viruses, as opposed to bacterial pathogens, garner particular interest
because outbreaks cannot be controlled with antibiotics, though the
effects can be mitigated by vaccines and newer antiviral drugs. To
evaluate the potential hazards posed by viral pathogens emerging from
thawing permafrost, we review information from a diverse range of
disciplines. This includes efforts to recover infectious virus from
human remains, studies on disease occurrence in polar animal
populations, investigations into viral persistence and infectivity in
permafrost, and assessments of human exposure to the enormous viral
diversity present in the environment. **[Based on currently available
knowledge, we conclude that the [risk]{.mark} posed by viruses [from
thawing permafrost is no greater than viruses in other
environments]{.mark} such as temperate soils and aquatic
systems.]{.underline}** Permafrost underlies a quarter of Earth's
terrestrial surface (1) and, despite millennia of subzero temperatures,
hosts diverse microbial communities (2). Some microorganisms survive by
altering their physiology and maintaining low rates of metabolic
activity. Others adopt dormant forms such as endospores or cysts (3--7).
Viruses that infect bacteria, archaea, and microeukaryotes (e.g., fungi
and amoebae) are also abundant members of these microbial communities,
both in thawing and intact permafrost (8, 9). They can survive by
infecting active cells, through passive existence as prophages, or as
"stowaways" when an infected cell enters dormancy. In some cases,
cold-adapted viruses may persist frozen outside of their hosts (10--13).
Permafrost also contains the remains of dead microbes, plants, animals,
and occasionally humans, which are preserved by frozen conditions (3,
14, 15). Climate change may thaw up to 40% of Arctic and subarctic
permafrost by the end of the century (16), exposing the preserved
remains of infectious disease victims (both human and animal). If viral
pathogens maintain infectivity while frozen in permafrost, or if
permafrost viruses with microbial hosts can jump to humans or animals,
thaw could potentially initiate disease outbreaks (17). However, there
are many reasons why this possibility should not result in a heightened
sense of alarm. The possibility of pathogenic microorganisms emerging
from thawing permafrost and causing disease is not completely without
precedent. In 2016 an anthrax outbreak, caused by the bacterium Bacillus
anthracis, resulted in the death of one person, sickened dozens more,
and killed thousands of domesticated reindeer on the Yamal Peninsula in
Russia (18). Prior to the introduction of a vaccine around 1930, anthrax
was common on the Yamal Peninsula and periodically decimated reindeer
populations (19). Reindeer herds likely acquired anthrax through the
uptake of environmentally resistant endospores, which can remain dormant
in the soil for decades. This is akin to transmission pathways in
grazing animals from temperate regions (20). From \~1930 to 2016,
anthrax was virtually absent on the Yamal Peninsula due to reindeer
vaccination programs (19). However, routine vaccination was discontinued
in 2007, leading to an immunologically naive host population that was
susceptible to infection by B. anthracis (18, 21). It is unclear whether
the 2016 outbreak was caused by B. anthracis acquired from thawing
permafrost and/or thawed reindeer carcasses, or if it occurred
independent of thaw in a region where anthrax was endemic (22).
Vaccination has since resumed, and no further outbreaks have been
reported (23). The inability of anthrax to spread from person to person
and the availability of modern vaccines and antibiotics (24) suggest
that emergence of B. anthracis spores from thawing permafrost would be
unlikely to cause a geographically widespread epidemic or pandemic. In
general, modern antibiotics make potential emerging bacterial pathogens
more containable than viral pathogens. We therefore focus on viral
pathogens for the remainder of this perspective. Box 1. Definitions and
terminology Viral pathogen A virus that "causes damage in a susceptible
host or has the potential to do so" (25). Spillover Transmission of a
virus from one species to another, establishing an infection in a new
host (25, 26). This definition includes spillovers that are followed by
transmission between individuals in the new host species and spillovers
that dead-end in the new host (i.e., there is no subsequent transmission
between individuals in the new host species), as occurs when
hantaviruses and the rabies virus spillover into humans from animal
hosts (27, 28). Host jump We define host jump as a spillover followed by
sustained transmission between individuals in the new host species.
Zoonosis Infection transmitted from non-human animals to humans. Giant
viruses The existence of giant viruses was first recognized in 2003 when
a virus measuring 0.7 µm in diameter was isolated from an amoeba host
(29). Since then, many additional giant viruses have been identified
through cultivation-based approaches and in metagenomic sequence data
from environmental samples (30--32). They are characterized by their
exceptionally large size, can typically be observed with a light
microscope, and are larger than some bacterial cells. Giant viruses have
been placed in the diverse Nucleocytoviricota phylum, which includes
other lineages of large (but not giant) viruses. There is not a formal
consensus on which clades within Nucleocytoviricota constitute giant
viruses, in part because taxonomic classification is challenging (33),
but they typically include members of the Mimiviridae, Marseilleviridae,
Pithoviridae, and Pandoraviridae families (31, 34--37). In some
instances, the term "giant viruses" has been expanded to describe the
entire Nucleocytoviricota phylum (38). However, this phylum covers an
enormous phylogenetic range (including variola virus, which causes
smallpox) with lineages that differ substantially from giant viruses
found in permafrost and other environments (31, 39, 40). Here, we adhere
to the non-expanded use of the term that differentiates between large
and giant viruses. Potential viral pathogens from thawing permafrost
could cause human disease outbreaks through three general pathways. The
first is reintroduction of human viral pathogens, such as those causing
influenza and smallpox, from thawing graves, mass burial sites, or soil
or ice to the modern environment. The second is reintroduction of
viruses with wildlife or domestic animal hosts from thawed remains or
soil and ice, which could be transmitted directly to humans or could
infect animals before jumping to humans. The third is the spillover of
permafrost viruses with microbial hosts, such as microeukaryotes,
bacteria, and archaea, to humans or animals when permafrost thaws. To
initiate an outbreak, viruses spilling over would need to both establish
an infection in the new host and subsequently be transmitted between
individuals in the new host species. As discussed in more detail in
later sections, this third pathway is an especially unlikely scenario.
All of these general pathways depend on whether viruses can survive and
remain infectious for decades to millennia in permafrost in sufficient
numbers to cause disease. The latter two also depend on the ability of
viruses to spillover from the original reservoir and initiate a
successful chain of transmission in the new host (41). This perspective
discusses each scenario and the factors that inform risk assessments.
HUMAN PATHOGENIC VIRUSES IN PERMAFROST Smallpox Smallpox is caused by
the variola virus, a double-stranded DNA virus with a 186-kb genome
(42). The last known natural case occurred in 1977, and the World Health
Assembly declared it officially eradicated in 1980 (43). Since
eradication, bodies from permafrost have been tested for evidence of
viable virus at archeological sites or when warm temperatures threaten
burial sites (15, 44). The first such test was in the 1990s, initiated
by the discovery of a wooden vault, near the village of Pokhodsk in
northern Siberia, that contained mummified bodies of smallpox victims
(44). Scientists from the Vector Institute (a facility near Novosibirsk
that is one of the two places on Earth that holds remaining stores of
smallpox virus) and their colleagues collected samples from the chamber,
including from smallpox pustules. Back in the lab, they were unable to
isolate live virus from the samples (44--46) and explained that the
virus may have been destroyed by prior freeze--thaw cycles since the
burial site was near the permafrost surface and may have periodically
thawed during warm years (44, 46). Another attempt at testing for
variola virus was from well-preserved frozen mummies at an archeological
site in the central Sakha Republic in Eastern Siberia (15). Quick burial
after death and preservation efforts during excavation and sampling
increased the probability of virus preservation. Rather than attempting
to recover viable virus, the length of variola virus DNA fragments was
used as a proxy for the presence of intact virus. Since an intact genome
is necessary for viability, infectivity would be possible only if long
pieces of DNA remained. PCR products were obtained for three short DNA
fragments (139, 145, and 590 bp), and sequence analysis confirmed
amplicons were from the variola virus. Long-distance PCR (targeting an
\~2-kb region of the viral genome) failed to produce amplification
products, ruling out the presence of intact viral particles. The
influenza pandemic of 1918 The influenza pandemic of 1918, caused by an
H1N1 influenza A virus with a 13.5-kb RNA genome, resulted in the deaths
of tens of millions of people (47). The pandemic was particularly
devastating for residents of Alaska Native communities, who suffered 82%
of influenza-associated deaths in Alaska (48). The story of virus
recovery efforts from human remains in permafrost is centered in Brevig
Mission (called Teller Mission in 1918), a small Inupiat village. On 14
November 1918, Brevig Mission had \~80 adult residents. From 15 to 20
November, influenza claimed the lives of 72 residents. A burial site was
dug into the permafrost, where the preserved remains of victims were
undisturbed until 1951 when scientist Johan Hultin obtained permission
from village elders to excavate the burial site (49, 50). Tissue was
collected from the lungs of four individuals who had been interred in
permafrost. To determine if infectious H1N1 virus persisted, the lung
tissue was cultured in embryonated chicken eggs (51), a highly sensitive
method for influenza virus detection (52). However, no evidence of
infectious virus was observed (50, 51). Forty-six years after the first
attempt and 79 years after the pandemic, Hultin and colleagues again
obtained permission to excavate the Brevig Mission gravesite for an
attempt at H1N1 virus recovery. Lung tissue was collected from the
remains of four individuals buried at a depth of approximately 2 m.
Influenza virus RNA was detected in one of the individuals using reverse
transcription PCR (RT-PCR) testing. However, only small fragments of the
viral genome (\<120 nucleotides) could be amplified (51, 53), showing
that viable viral particles did not remain in the samples and suggesting
that influenza virus does not survive in permafrost. The interred
remains of individuals from Brevig Mission represent the highest
probability scenario investigated to date in terms of human pathogenic
virus preservation. Gold miners, who were skilled at excavating in
permafrost, were employed by the territorial government to dig the
burial site. Individuals were buried at 2 m, below depths susceptible to
occasional thaw during warm years. The 1951 excavation recovered
"generous" biopsies from eight lungs, which all tested negative for the
presence of influenza virus (51). In 1997, the remains of four
individuals were uncovered (53). One was well preserved, which was
likely due to subcutaneous fatty tissue that had protected the internal
organs. It was tissue from that lung that yielded small viral genome
fragments (51). Lessons learned from variola virus and the 1918 H1N1
influenza virus These examples suggest that human pathogenic viruses
probably do not remain infectious when frozen in permafrost, even when
preservation conditions are nearly ideal and samples are carefully
collected using procedures to preserve viability or genome integrity
(17, 54). The small number of examples makes the precise hazard
difficult to predict, but also points to another consideration:
specifically, that the number of well-preserved grave sites may be quite
small. Digging into frozen ground is difficult and requires special
tools and/or techniques (51). Burial in the active layer (soil
overlaying permafrost that freezes and thaws annually), as occurred in
the case of 1918 influenza victims on Svalbard (55), or in shallow
permafrost that is near freezing and occasionally thaws during warm
years, can reduce the number of viable viral particles by many fold due
to freeze--thaw cycles (54). Even for recently deceased influenza
victims, the infectious hazard of human remains is low. Guidelines for
funeral directors and mortuary staff place influenza in the low-risk
category, and viewing and embalming are considered safe (56--58).
**[Together, the combination of [limited infectious virus survival in
permafrost, a]{.mark} potentially [small number of]{.mark}
well-[preserved burial sites, and low transmission risk from human
remains suggests that thawing permafrost is not a probable
exposure]{.mark} pathway.]{.underline}** WILDLIFE AND DOMESTIC ANIMAL
HOSTS Reintroduction of a virus from thawing animal remains or water and
soil that previously served as wildlife habitat could have potentially
deleterious impacts on non-human animal populations. Human populations
could be affected if the pathogen is able to shift hosts. There is,
however, no precedent for a domestic animal or wildlife disease outbreak
following emergence of a viral pathogen from frozen soils, nor
recognized events where viruses from recently thawed permafrost caused
zoonotic disease. This does not mean that such a scenario is impossible,
but it does imply that it is improbable. The closest example,
specifically the 2016 anthrax outbreak, was caused by an environmentally
resistant endospore-forming bacterium rather than a virus, and it is
still unclear whether thawing permafrost was a causative factor (22).
Pathogenic viruses in animal remains face the same degradative processes
that compromise influenza and variola viruses in permafrost, as
described in previous sections. Delays between death and entombment in
permafrost, nucleic acid damage that accumulates over time, and exposure
to freeze--thaw cycles cause the degradation of viral particles,
limiting the potential for viable virus to persist in animal remains
(59--62). Damage begins to occur almost immediately after death (59),
causing a rapid decline in the number of infectious viral particles
(63--65). A few exceptionally well-preserved animal specimens show
evidence of immediate burial in permafrost or ice (66, 67), but the
majority exhibit signs of delay between death and the point of
preservation (e.g., tissue destruction, partial decomposition, or
dismemberment) (68--72). Though permafrost slows nucleic acid
degradation, significant damage still occurs in the form fragmentation,
crosslinking, and lesion accumulation (62). DNA extracted from ancient
faunal remains contains a mix DNA from the animal itself, microorganisms
(including viruses) present at the time of death, and microorganisms
introduced postmortem (59, 73, 74). This DNA is typically highly
fragmented, usually less than a few hundred base pairs in length but
often much smaller (73--77). RNA, when recoverable, is even more
degraded (78). Even remains preserved soon after death experience
nucleic acid damage (79, 80), which accumulates over time (59). Most
well-preserved animal specimens found in permafrost date back to the
late Pleistocene (between 11,700 and 129,000 years ago) and early
Holocene (between 8,200 and 11,700 years ago) (68, 81, 82). These
timeframes exceed the expected survival of fully intact nucleic acids
from viral and other microbial sources unless they are protected by
stress-resistant forms (e.g., capsids that shield against harsh
extracellular environments or cysts) or they have low levels of
metabolic activity that enable DNA repair (79, 83, 84). Unlike viruses
associated with microbial hosts in permafrost (discussed in the next
section), animal viruses lack adaptations to the permafrost environment
and do not have the protection of a cold-adapted host that can perform
DNA repair or enter dormancy (11, 79, 83, 85, 86). In stark contrast to
the hypothetical risk posed by viruses from thawing permafrost, viruses
circulating among wild and domestic animals have repeatedly jumped into
human hosts, causing disease outbreaks. Examples include the viruses
causing coronavirus disease 2019, Ebola, and avian influenza (87--89).
This suggests that risks of disease outbreaks from viruses of animal
origin are much more likely to stem from contact with extant wildlife
(direct or indirect) in the Arctic and subarctic rather than emergence
from permafrost (90, 91). PERMAFROST VIRUSES WITH MICROBIAL HOSTS Giant
viruses in permafrost In contrast to the viruses causing smallpox and
influenza, numerous giant viruses have been revived from late
Pleistocene-aged permafrost (31, 92). These giant viruses infect
Acanthamoeba (31), a genus of amoeba that is broadly distributed in both
natural and built environments (93, 94). Beyond permafrost, giant
viruses have a widespread global distribution and can infect amoebae and
other protist hosts such as algae (95--98). Their persistence in
permafrost likely stems from a wide range of virus and host adaptations
to extreme conditions (86). Giant virus capsids are incredibly stable
(99), and their outer walls are comparable in thickness to Gram-positive
bacterial cell walls (100), which enable the viruses to retain
infectivity after exposure to chemicals, desiccation, and extremes in
temperature, pH, and salinity (85, 101--103). Beyond the robust viral
structure, Acanthamoeba hosts may offer protection against extreme
conditions (104). Acanthamoeba form rugged double-walled cysts
(105--108) and may also have freeze-resistant non-encysted forms with
low levels of metabolic activity (109). Encystment of an infected cell
or maintenance of an infection in a non-encysted state could facilitate
virus survival and enable reemergence when permafrost thaws. Human
pathogenic viruses are comparatively fragile and are not protected from
extreme conditions by a cold-adapted host. Even variola virus, which can
survive outside a host for several years in scabs and lesion crusts
(often collected for variolation efforts) and is known for being stable
(110), does not appear to survive for a few hundred years in permafrost
(15, 54), let alone thousands of years as seen in giant viruses.
Together, these data suggest that the persistence of giant viruses in
permafrost is not a reliable indicator of the ability of human viral
pathogens to likewise survive in permafrost. Giant viruses have been
associated with conditions in humans, such as pneumonia and keratitis,
leading to questions about their potential to cause disease (111, 112).
However, amoebae that host giant viruses are also present in such cases.
These amoebae either directly cause disease (e.g., Acanthamoeba
keratitis \[113\]) or play a crucial role in infections, such as
facilitating the transmission of Legionella pneumophila in respiratory
illness (114). There is no evidence of a causal link between giant
viruses and disease (37). The absence of such connections strongly
suggests that giant viruses are unable to infect humans directly.
Associations between giant virues and humans are probably incidental,
caused by viruses co-occurring with thier amoeba hosts (93, 99, 102,
107). Other microbial viruses in permafrost In addition to giant
amoeba-infecting viruses, permafrost (like other soils) contains diverse
viral communities with bacterial, archaeal, and other microeukaryotic
hosts (9, 115--117). Stable isotope probing, RNA sequencing, and thaw
experiments show that at least a subset of these viruses maintain
viability and can be active at subzero temperatures (10, 118). In
extreme environments, including permafrost, viruses can have multiple
survival mechanisms, such as increased virion (viral particle) stability
and integrity, auxiliary metabolic genes that aid host survival in cold
conditions, and the ability to integrate their genetic material into the
host genome, allowing the virus to coexist within a (cold adapted) host
in a quiescent state (11, 12, 119--121). Potential for viruses with
microbial hosts to spillover to humans and animals The theoretical risk
posed by permafrost viruses with microbial hosts to human populations
can be evaluated by exploring the origin and evolution of pathogenic
viruses and examining whether there is precedent for microbial viruses
spilling over to humans or animals. Host jumps between closely related
species are common at evolutionary timescales; 61% of human pathogens
and 75% of emerging human pathogens have zoonotic origins (122). The
likelihood of successful host jumping decreases as the phylogenetic
distance between hosts increases (123--125). Viruses bind specifically
to molecules on the host cell surface, rely on the host's cellular
machinery for replication, and must evade the host's immune system
(126--128). As a result, they are typically highly adapted to specific
hosts and can only "work" in hosts with similar molecular pathways (129,
130). Given the large phylogenetic distance between soil microbes and
humans, such a shift would be extraordinarily unlikely, if not
impossible. Investigating the origins of human pathogenic viruses shows
that microorganisms are not a source of spillovers. The majority of
zoonotic viruses (\>80%) are from mammals, while the remaining \~20% are
primarily from birds (87, 124, 131, 132). Instances of viruses infecting
both humans and other vertebrates, such as reptiles, are rare (131, 133,
134). Non-zoonotic viruses, such as papillomaviruses and herpesviruses,
which are host specific, offer insights into potential host jumps in the
more distant past. For these viruses, the host phylogenetic tree roughly
mirrors the viral phylogenetic tree (135--137). For example, human
papillomaviruses are most closely related to papillomaviruses with
non-human primate hosts, and the phylogenetic distance between viruses
increases with evolutionary distance between hosts (136, 138, 139).
These evolutionary relationships can largely be attributed to
co-speciation between virus and host and occasional instances of
interspecies virus transfer (135, 137, 140). However, there is no
evidence to support a microbial origin for these viruses (135, 137, 139,
141, 142). [**[The lack of precedent for microbial viruses jumping to
human or animal hosts suggests this scenario is unlikely to arise from
thawing permafrost.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Humans are constantly exposed
to an enormous diversity of viruses from the environment. Viruses are
crucial members of all Earth's ecosystems (143), and soils are perhaps
the largest viral reservoir on Earth (144). In some soils, viral
abundance can exceed more than one billion per gram, and similar counts
are found per gram of human intestinal content (144--146). Billions of
viruses can be swallowed during a swim in the sea (147, 148). Despite
this constant bombardment, there is no indication that microbe-infecting
viruses represent a major disease risk for humans, wildlife, or domestic
animals (87). **[[Research, surveillance, and prevention strategies
aimed at mitigating the risk and impact of future pandemics do not
identify these viruses as potential threats]{.mark} (90, 149,
150).]{.underline}** There is no reason to think that viruses from
permafrost represent a greater risk for spillover than viruses
maintained in other environments such as temperate soils and aquatic
systems. CONCLUSIONS Currently available data indicate that there is no
increased risk of human viral pathogen emergence from permafrost
compared to other environmental sources. We do not claim that viral
pathogens in permafrost pose zero risk or that surveillance of putative
viral pathogens in permafrost is unnecessary. **[However, [there
is]{.mark} currently [no evidence]{.mark} that [human or animal viral
pathogens frozen in permafrost pose a]{.mark}n imminent [disease
outbreak threat.]{.mark} Though climate change is accelerating thaw, the
entry of microbes from ancient permafrost into the modern environment is
not a new phenomenon. Permafrost is continually and naturally exposed to
the modern environment by processes such as erosion, cryoturbation,
frost heave, solifluction, wildfire, and climate fluctuations
(151--153). [Humans have been in the Arctic for more than 40,000
years]{.mark} (Alaska up to 25,000 years and Scandinavia \~5,000 to
12,000 years) (154--156).]{.underline} [T[his suggests that
people]{.underline}]{.mark} [are and [have been regularly exposed to
viruses from permafrost soils, with no clear evidence for large-scale
health consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Framing viral discovery
efforts in the cryosphere as a search for "zombie viruses" or
potentially pandemic pathogens is not particularly useful and perhaps
even harmful. Stoking fears of viruses in thawing permafrost may
inadvertently discourage customary and traditional cultural practices
among subarctic and Arctic residents or divert attention from the more
pressing ways that pathogens in the warming Arctic pose risk to human
health and well-being (157). For example, wildlife and humans
increasingly occupy shared habitats, providing opportunities for viruses
maintained in animals to spillover into humans (90). Arthropod and
rodent disease vector ranges are expanding and shifting northward (158).
Extreme precipitation and flooding events are increasing, threatening
infrastructure such as water and waste treatment facilities (159--161).
Higher temperatures increase the survival of some water-borne disease
agents (91). Furthermore, wildlife health may be affected as a
consequence of climate change, which further compromises fragile
ecosystems and the people that rely upon them (162). Box 2. Zombies are
fictional and have racist origins The frequent presentation of "zombie"
pathogen in news articles and a few academic articles has received
immense and improper attention (31, 163). The term zombie pathogen is
typically shorthand for a pathogen from the past that has been preserved
in permafrost and could become active and cause human disease when
released by thaw. As we discuss here, this outcome is highly unlikely,
and yet the term zombie virus is used to elicit an apocalyptic fear
response in the reader, often to grab headlines. It is not well known,
and thus important to examine, that the zombie fantasy has origins in
the racist past against people of color, particularly in North America
and the Caribbean (164, 165). It originated from the dehumanizing
violence against Haitian slaves in the 17th century, born of Vodou
folklore but then modified and used as a means of control and oppression
(166). It was later made popular in horror movies containing escapist
end-time fantasy (166, 167). Because of its racist origins, this
mythology perpetuates the idea that "invaders" that are unlike us are
coming to destroy our world and that destruction is imminent and fast
moving (168). Despite the collective interest in zombies, it is
important to note its cultural origin so that the concept can be more
easily put aside as fiction, rather than a scientific metaphor. The
word's use in scientific literature is unhelpful, provides only
titillating headlines, and unconsciously supports a narrative of
xenophobic fear of things we do not understand (169).

#### Disease [doesn't]{.underline} cause extinction.

The risk of natural pandemics

For most of human history, the greatest risk of mass fatalities has
stemmed from natural pandemics. In the 1300s, the Black Death plague
outbreak killed 30--50% of the European population.86 The 1918 'Spanish
flu' killed 50 million to 100 million people,87 more people than died in
World War One. [These events are **outliers**]{.underline}, but history
is punctuated by episodes of mass death from disease outbreaks.

However, there are some reasons to think that naturally occurring
[[pathogens are **unlikely** to cause]{.mark} human [extinction]{.mark}.
Firstly, Homo sapiens have been around for **[200,000
years]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the Homo genus for around six million
years [[without being **exterminated**]{.mark} by an infectious disease,
which [is **ev**]{.mark}idence that [the **base**]{.mark} **rate** of
**extinction-[risk]{.mark}** natural pathogens [is
**low**]{.mark}]{.underline}.88 [Indeed, [past]{.mark} **disease
[outbreaks]{.mark}** [have not **come close**]{.mark} to rendering
humans extinct]{.underline}. Although bodies were piled high in the
streets across Europe during the Black Death,89 human extinction was
never a serious possibility, and some economists even argue that it was
a boon for the European economy.90

[Secondly, infectious disease has **[only]{.mark}** contributed to the
[extinction of]{.mark} a **small [minority]{.mark}** [of
**animal**]{.mark} specie**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.91 [[The
**only**]{.mark} confirmed case of a **[mammal]{.mark}**]{.underline}ian
species extinction being caused by an infectious disease [[is a]{.mark}
type of [**rat** native **only** to Christmas
Island]{.mark}]{.underline}.92 [For [humans]{.mark}, who [are]{.mark}
**geographically [dispersed]{.mark}**, **genetically [diverse]{.mark}**
[and capable of]{.mark} a **rational [response]{.mark}** to problems,
the risk therefore appears **small**]{.underline}.

Having said that, the context may be importantly different for modern
day humans, so it is unclear whether the risk is increasing or
decreasing. The risk may be increasing due to : (1) global travel, which
allows more rapid pathogen spread; (2) increased population density; and
(3) more close contact with animal populations due to both densely
packed factory-farms and expansion into uninhabited areas lead to higher
rates of emergence.93 On the other hand, [[interconnectedness]{.mark}
could also [increase **immunity** by]{.mark} increasing [**exposure** to
**lower**]{.mark} **virulence** [strains]{.mark} between
subpopulations]{.underline}.94 [Moreover, advancements in [**medicine**
and **sanitation** limit]{.mark} the potential [damage]{.mark} an
outbreak might do]{.underline}. It is overall unclear how high the level
of natural risk is today.95 In our view the global catastrophic risk
this century from natural pathogens is likely much lower than that of
engineered pathogens, but the risk of natural pathogens may well have
increased over the last 200 years. Our two recommended biosecurity
charities each work to reduce the risk of both natural and engineered
pathogens, so this debate does not appear to have important practical
implications for the purposes of this report.

Faster Vaccine Development

The [[most effective way to stop pandemics is with
vaccines]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, with [Ebola there was no
vaccine]{.underline}, and [only now, years later, has one proven
effective.]{.underline} [This has been the case with Zika,
too]{.underline}. [Though there has been rapid progress in developing
and getting a vaccine to market, **it is not fast** enough, and Zika has
already spread worldwide.]{.underline}

[**[Many]{.mark}** other [diseases do not have
vaccines]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [developing them takes too long when
a pandemic is already under way]{.underline}. [[We need faster
pipelines]{.mark}, such as the one that the Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations is trying to create]{.underline},
[[to]{.underline} **[preemptively develop
vaccines]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[for diseases]{.mark} predicted to
cause outbreaks in the near future.]{.underline}

Point-of-Care Diagnostics

[[Even with such efforts, vaccines will not be ready for many
diseases]{.mark}]{.underline} and would not even be an option for novel
or artificially engineered pathogens. With no vaccine for Ebola, [[our
next **best strategy** was to identify who was infected as quickly as
possible and isolate them before they infected
others]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because Ebola's symptoms were identical to
common illnesses like malaria, [diagnosis required laboratory testing
that could not be easily scaled]{.underline}. [As a result, many
patients were only tested after several days of being contagious and
infecting others.]{.underline} Some were never tested at all, and about
[40% of patients in Ebola treatment centers did not actually have
Ebola.]{.underline}

Many dangerous pathogens similarly require laboratory testing that is
difficult to scale. [Florida, for example, has not been able to expand
testing for Zika, so pregnant women wait weeks to know if their babies
might be affected]{.underline}. What's needed [are **point-of-care
diagnostics** that, like pregnancy tests, can be used by frontline
responders or patients themselves to detect infection right away, where
they live]{.underline}. These tests already exist for many diseases, and
the technology behind them is well-established. However, the process for
their validation is slow and messy. Point-of-care diagnostics for Ebola,
for example, were available but never used because of such bottlenecks.

Greater Global Coordination

[[We need stronger global coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[responsibility for controlling pandemics is
fragmented]{.underline}]{.mark}, spread across too many players [**[with
no unifying authority]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In Guinea we forged a
response out of an amalgam of over 30 organizations, each of which had
its own priorities. [In Ebola's aftermath, there have been calls for a
mechanism for responding to pandemics similar to the advance planning
and training that NATO has in place for its numerous members to respond
to military threats in a quick, coordinated fashion.]{.underline}
