# Military Capacity Aff -- Cal Starter Pack

## Notes

This is designed to be a very large aff on the topic so that you get
experience debating the core issues of the Arctic. The plan is HUGE! It
does a bunch of stuff regarding military capacity (the ability to do
something frequently and for a sustained amount of time at a robust
level) and capability (new tech, new ships, etc.)

For context, the Arctic is becoming more contested for a variety of
reasons. For example, global warming means that different shipping lanes
and resource deposits are opening up. That can cause states to try to
stake their claim more in the Arctic. In this affirmative, we explore
the potential implications of what that means for both the United States
and Russian militaries.

The conflict advantage is pretty straightforward -- it just says that
Russia is building up its military might and becoming more aggressive in
the Arctic now and that the plan is key to stop war.

The early warning advantage is about missile defense systems. Missile
defense is basically if someone shoots a missile at us we intercept it.
The advantage argues that missile defense over the Arctic is especially
key because the Arctic is the most strategic place for many of our
adversaries (Iran, North Korea, China, Russia) to launch weapons at us.
We only claim impacts off of North Korea and Iran in the 1AC, but there
is a China add-on for the 2AC if you decide to pursue that option.

The 1AC took me about 10 minutes to read as is but I am elderly and do
not speak quickly. I would definitely time it ahead of your first
debates as you may need to make some adjustments.

For writing 2AC blocks, here are some hints:

1)  Against the Russia disadvantage, we have specific answers but keep
    in mind that the entire AFF is an answer to the Russia DA. Think
    about how the links interact with the thesis of your affirmative.

2)  Answering the diplomacy counterplan is the same thing. The aff
    asserts that military buildup is needed which is in direct
    opposition to the idea that we can just use diplomacy.

3)  Against the warming turn, think about how the first few cards of the
    1AC help you answer this turn.

HAVE SO MUCH FUN!!!!

ABSTRACT

[[The U.S.]{.mark} and its Arctic allies are [facing a strategic dilemma
in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[With Russia having a predominance
of cold weather capable forces]{.mark} and bases inside the Arctic
Circle, and with China showing greater economic and military interest in
the region, in tandem with Russia, [the U.S. is failing to compete
around the North Pole]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to project effectively
military force in the harsh Arctic environment, numerous lessons about
polar warfare need to be relearned by the American
military]{.underline}. This article provides context on the issues of
Arctic operations, presents five historical case studies of military
operations in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, and identifies how to
improve U.S. military capabilities for polar warfare.

Introduction

[[The strategic importance of the Arctic was forgotten b]{.mark}y the
U.S. military [after the fall of the Soviet Union]{.mark}. However, [a
resurgent Russia is changing threat perceptions]{.mark} [around the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia increased its Arctic military
activities beginning in 2007 when they symbolically planted a Russian
titanium flag underwater at the North Pole to signal the Arctic as a
priority "with Vladimir Putin's vision of restoring Russia's status as a
great power."]{.underline} The 2008 invasion of Georgia further
signalled Russia's return to its imperial tendencies. Russia owns 53% of
Arctic coastline and climatic reductions in sea ice has facilitated a
growing presence.2 [[Seven of Russia's]{.mark} eleven ballistic missile
submarines ([SSBNs) are located]{.mark} on the Kola Peninsula,
[in]{.mark}side [the Arctic Circle]{.mark}. [Russia has invested heavily
in its Arctic military capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}---[reopening
"50 previously closed Soviet-era posts" and investing in new
capabilities like hypersonic missiles and "nuclear-powered undersea
drones]{.underline}."

Similarly, a rising China declared itself a "near-Arctic state" in its
2018 Arctic Strategy.China has acted on this ambition by investing
heavily in infrastructure, assets, and various projects in the Arctic
Circle region, with an emphasis on energy and minerals. A Brookings
Institute report argues that China has serious "aspirations to become a
polar great power" and notes that Beijing has sent 33 high-level
diplomats to the region, joined numerous Arctic organisations, invested
in icebreaker fleets, and has sent its navy independently into the
region in both 2015 and 2021.

[As the Russian war in Ukraine drags on, sanctions are leading Moscow to
become more dependent on Beijing for trade, finance, and war matériel.
Growing Chinese-Russian collaboration includes a Chinese-Russian Polar
Silk Road and the shipping of oil through Russian controlled Arctic
routes. As Russia loses political and diplomatic influence in the region
due to its suspension by the Arctic Council in 2022, China is filling
that void through various attempts to establish itself as an Arctic
player "to bend the established order to its liking]{.underline}." For
instance, China and Russia signed a maritime law agreement that
established joint coast guard patrols in the Arctic. On the surface such
a deal would seem beneficial, however, the Chinese Coast Guard is
notorious for bullying neighbouring navies and fishing vessels in the
South China Sea as "Beijing's patrol vessels often resemble warships."
Whether Beijing and Moscow's maritime law agreement will lead to similar
activities remains to be seen.

[Increasing strategic [focus on the Arctic]{.mark} in national security
discussions [is the result of]{.mark} two factors. First, as
[anthropogenic climate change accelerates in the Arctic]{.mark}, which
was previously locked in permanent pack ice, [the area is]{.mark} now
[becoming more accessible]{.mark} for economic and military purposes.
Second, [growing]{.mark} [Arctic distrust is pitting the West]{.mark}
(and NATO) [against Russia]{.mark} and China, with growing strategic
competition leading to China and Russia increasingly performing more
economic, military, and supposed scientific activities in the
Arctic]{.underline}. In response, the 2022 National Security Strategy
(NSS) has a dedicated section on how the U.S. must "Maintain a Peaceful
Arctic" due to Chinese and Russian activities and investments in the
region.14

The American origins of modern Arctic concerns can be traced back to a
1948 U.S. Naval War College "Polar Operations" lecture. In remarks given
by Rear Admiral R.H. Cruzen, he stated "there is a general realization
by civilian as well as military personnel, of the present and future
strategic importance of the north polar area."15 The value of Cruzen's
lecture, based on his naval experience in the Arctic and Antarctic, was
the identification of the numerous challenges facing military forces
operating in a cold weather environment and how the U.S. was not
prepared for a potential conflict in the Arctic. Whilst Cruzen had
little impact in fielding U.S. forces capable of conducting "polar
warfare," his lessons about cold weather degrading military capabilities
remain.

[As China and Russia challenge the liberal rules-based order, such as
illegal claims to certain economic exclusion zones (EEZs), their Arctic
behaviour is reshaping laws, rules, and norms of that region in their
favour]{.underline}. [[Growing military investments]{.mark} and
bellicose postures by Beijing and Moscow in the Arctic [means that
Washington and its Arctic allies will need to invest in cold weather
capabilities]{.mark} and train to fight and win in the
region]{.underline}. [[Changes in the Arctic's physical
environment]{.mark} coupled with increased geopolitical tension and
competition between the U.S., China, and Russia (and their respective
allies and partners) [is creating an increasingly volatile
environment]{.mark}]{.underline} that requires a thorough analysis of
the military capabilities needed for successful polar operations. [This
article [push]{.mark}es [back]{.mark} [against scholars that advocate
for the peaceful co-operation of Arctic exceptionalism]{.mark} and other
academics that contend Russia is only pursuing a soft power strategy in
the Arctic]{.underline}.16 [[The reality is that Russia has focused on
increasing hard power]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic
[since]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin came to power]{.underline}. [Even
after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to build up its
Arctic military presence despite major combat losse]{.underline}s.

This essay begins by describing the context of harsh Arctic conditions
and the historical rationale for Russian interest in the region. The
second section illustrates the challenges of polar warfare, by utilising
five historical case studies of military operations in the Arctic Circle
and sub-Arctic zones. The lessons learned from these historical cases
inform the third section on how joint forces can be successful in future
Arctic operations. Finally, [the article concludes with an emphasis on
how polar warfare needs to be normalised in the American
military]{.underline} -- and how the U.S. can improve its Arctic
capabilities by training and exercising with the other Arctic-nations
who all happen to be members of NATO after the ascension of Finland and
Sweden to the treaty.

#### The U.S.'s current approach to the Arctic is [too]{.underline} passive -- global warming and Russian ambitions means that the squo causes [global instability]{.underline}

"The position of the United States upon the two oceans would be either a
source of great weakness or a cause of enormous expense." When Alfred
Thayer Mahan penned these words, Alaska was not yet a state and the
Arctic was still a vast icescape. But now Mahan's predictions must
undergo a twenty-first-century update to account for the arrival of the
third frontier: [a blue Arctic.]{.underline} [[As ice melts]{.mark}, new
trade routes will emerge]{.underline}, [resources long hidden beneath
the ice will become accessible, and [a new strategic battleground will
emerge]{.mark} at the top of the world]{.underline}. While politicians
and pundits debate the validity of climate change and its causes, [the
Arctic continues to melt, with blue waterways capable of supporting
deep-draft commercial and military vessels predicted by
2050]{.underline}. Although continued focus on the Indo-Pacific,
Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Red Sea regions holds merit, [accepting
risk in the Arctic may result in failure to prepare for and adapt to the
significant diplomatic, economic, cultural, and military transformations
already in the making]{.underline}.

[As the Arctic's melting ice opens new shipping routes, thaws previously
ice-protected shores, and unlocks access to untapped resources, the far
north takes on new strategic importance]{.underline}. Indeed, [the
Bering Strait---expected to become the Arctic's Gibraltar---is already a
chokepoint for global shipping and military operations]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [[Russia's militarization]{.mark} [of Arctic
territories]{.mark} and China's growing Arctic ambitions [demand our
urgent attention]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[In order to]{.mark} safeguard
our national interests and [promote global stability]{.mark}, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must ignore the red herring of climate
debates and]{.mark} instead [accept the reality]{.mark} of ice melt
[by]{.mark} [honing a comprehensive and aggressive Arctic
strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[We have not a moment to
waste]{.mark}: already lagging years behind our competitors in this
arena, such a combined effort among US military, federal, and private
entities will require decades of planning]{.underline}**.

Climate Change and Warfare: An Environmental History

While Earth's climate is changing at a faster pace than ever before,
climatic episodes over the past two thousand years---like the Roman
Climate Optimum (200 BCE--150 CE), the Little Antique Ice Age (300
CE--700 CE), the Medieval warming period (950 CE--1250), and the Little
Ice Age (1350--1850)---offer important perspective. In this era of
human-influenced climate change, these periods tell us that climate
change does not always spell disaster. Indeed, studies of these periods
tell us that [climate influences the conduct or outcome of war rather
than determining it. Our modern era of climate change can certainly
exacerbate vulnerabilities for those militaries who ignore it; but for
those who most capture the winds of history into the sails of their
respective war machines, it can provide strategic
opportunities]{.underline}.

[[Climate can influence]{.mark} who you fight, what you fight over, when
you fight and where, and perhaps most importantly, [why you
fight]{.mark}. Changing Arctic conditions demand strategists consider
those five W's in a twenty-first-century context]{.underline}. Before
2050, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, Canada, Denmark,
Norway, Sweden, and Finland [must assess how the
diminishing]{.underline} North Pole [ice wall will transform into blue
borders accessible]{.underline} not only to trade, but also [to other
strategic competitors, like Russia and China.]{.underline} **[[The
importance]{.mark} of such considerations [could hardly be
overstated]{.mark}: [Arctic flashpoints include]{.mark} vast [mineral
resources]{.mark}, largely untapped [oil and gas reserves, and disputes
over sovereignty]{.mark} within exclusive economic zones and resultant
trade wars]{.underline}**. In the past, such considerations have only
been necessary in the summer months (except for submarine and long-range
air assets), when climate conditions were most hospitable to both land
and sea forces. Yet [melting ice is projected to allow for year-round
naval and commercial shipping competition as early as 2050---with sea
trade via the region expected to double by 2035]{.underline}. [Compared
to the Panama and Suez Canals, the Northern Sea Route offers
significantly reduced transit times---and with it, fuel costs---thus
rendering it perhaps the most lucrative alternative to traditional
shipping lanes]{.underline}.

But why reallocate resources from our present strategic footprint?
Simply put, **[[the Arctic is quickly evolving into the new dance floor
for geopolitical competition]{.mark} ([including]{.mark}, in its most
extreme manifestation, [warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**), replete with
all the classic Thucydidean trappings of fear, honor, and interest.
[This is not an exaggeration: [Russia and China have already signaled
their desire for Arctic dominance]{.mark}. With the world's largest
icebreaker fleet, Russia poses the most dominant and formidable force in
the region]{.underline}. [[Russia has seized the strategic]{.mark} and
operational [advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [maintaining
near-continuous operations in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}[,
sharpening firsthand experience in the seascape, and challenging any
foreign militaries who dare transit these frigid waters. Not far behind
Russia, China---the self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state"---has similarly
declared itself a regional force]{.underline}. [China has invested
heavily in its Polar Silk Road, thus expanding its maritime and global
spheres of influence and all but guaranteeing strategic and economic
returns in the region.]{.underline}

[US Arctic Strategy]{.underline}

In recent years, [DoD's Arctic Strategy has undergone considerable
review and revision]{.underline}. Indeed, current policy is drastically
different from the policies of a decade ago. These new strategic visions
no doubt have heightened our awareness of the Arctic's growing
geopolitical importance, and these policies are not without their
strengths. But [our most recent strides leave one
wondering]{.underline}: [Are we doing enough]{.underline}? [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is an Arctic
nation, but does our strategic policy]{.mark} fully [reflect
this]{.mark}]{.underline}? [Current US strategy
acknowledges]{.underline}, for example, [the Arctic is not just
warming---it's becoming a new arena for strategic
competition.]{.underline} In this light, **[[the strategy's
"monitor-and-respond" approach reads as both too passive and too
reactive]{.mark} for the competitive contest likely to develop in the
far north]{.underline}**. While we recognize the innate importance of
robust monitoring and other intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance capabilities in the region, we also acknowledge that
[[China and Russia are]{.mark} already [conducting combined
exercises]{.mark} off the coast of Alaska]{.underline}. Considered in
this light, **[[our monitor-and-respond strategy resembles]{.mark} the
military equivalent of relying on [a giant Ring camera: it's great for
observation, but insufficient for deterring adversaries and projecting
power]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[More alarming still]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [lags woefully behind her fellow great powers in
Arctic preparations]{.underline}. [By the time the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [published its first radical transformation of
Arctic strategic policy, it was decades]{.underline}, even centuries,
[behind Russia's interest in the region]{.underline}---an interest that
transformed into action by the 2000s. Likewise, [China has been honing
its Arctic intentions since 2013, when it gained "observer" status in
the Arctic Council]{.underline}. The following year, Russia created its
Arctic Joint Strategic Command, and just three years after that,
declared its plans to "phase NATO out of the Arctic." By 2018, China
published its first Arctic policy white paper, and shortly after
launched its first domestically built icebreaker. [In 2023, Russia
declared the Arctic its second priority---a priority Moscow is well
positioned to promote with its already robust Arctic presence and
operating bases]{.underline}. **[Two of the world's most powerful
militaries have signaled their intent to establish strategic,
diplomatic, and economic dominance of the world's smallest ocean. Can
the United States really afford to simply monitor and
respond?]{.underline}**

We recognize this call to action is not without significant obstacles.
As our most current Arctic Strategy rightly points out, we must "balance
against other DoD global commitments"---and we have to determine how to
do this in an environment replete with fiscal, structural,
environmental, and manpower challenges. [We are not suggesting that
[DoD]{.mark} abandon our global commitments in favor of Arctic
operations]{.underline}. [We are arguing]{.underline}, however, **[that
the department [cannot abandon Arctic power projection in favor
of]{.mark} keeping [global commitments]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It will
be hard. It will stretch our forces and our capabilities. But [it is
worth remembering that [Russia is doing both. China is doing]{.mark}
[both]{.mark}]{.underline}. And increasingly, [they are doing both
together---including in back-to-back naval exercises in 2022 and 2023
off the coast of Alaska]{.underline}. Accordingly, **[[we must do both,
and we must start now]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[US Arctic
strategy]{.mark} and policy [must shift from a future-oriented
mindset]{.mark} of what we will do when time and resources allow to an
ethos of what we are doing now, lest we look back in 2030 or 2050 at
what we should've, could've, or would've done differently to prepare for
a blue Arctic]{.underline}**. In this light, **[[aiming]{.mark}
principally [to "manage risk in the region]{.mark}" [is]{.mark} [not
a]{.mark}n acceptable [substitute for establishing
presence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[must take action now]{.underline}** [to ensure
we are prepared to successfully maintain peace and prosperity in the
blue Arctic]{.underline}.

#### Failure to check Russia in the Arctic risks [World War Three]{.underline}

As the Munich Security Conference gets underway, [[the spectre of a
third world war looms on the horizon]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Military and
political [leaders]{.mark} in NATO nations [have issued]{.mark}
[chilling warnings]{.mark} for populations [to brace for the possibility
of devastating superpower conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Admiral Rob [Bauer, chair of NATO's Military Committee, fired the
opening salvo in the grim round of predictions]{.underline}. [He
cautioned that Russia could launch an attack within the next two
decades. In words reminiscent of World War II, Bauer urged allied
countries to mobilise citizen armies]{.underline}.

[British Defence Secretary]{.underline} Grant [Shapps has gone even
further, foreseeing potential wars involving China, Russia, North Korea
and Iran within the next five years]{.underline}. The situation is
transitioning "from a post-war to pre-war world", he asserted bleakly.

[General]{.underline} Sir Patrick [Sanders, the UK's army chief, echoed
that dark prediction]{.underline}. He described the British population
as a "pre-war generation" that may need to prepare for conflict with an
increasingly aggressive Russia.

German politicians and military leaders have discussed resurrecting
mandatory military service in response to growing threats and Sweden has
already introduced a form of national service as it closes in on NATO
membership.

**[[With Russia holding]{.mark} over [53% of the Arctic]{.mark} [Ocean
coastline]{.mark}, Vladimir [Putin believes domination]{.mark} of the
region's resources [is critical to]{.mark} the economic [survival of his
regime]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[To many, the idea that increased tensions sparked by Russia's attacks
on Ukraine could lurch towards a wider European conflict seems not only
probable but inevitable]{.underline}.

However, [[amid the drumbeats of international conflict]{.mark}, [one
crucial factor is being overlooked: the impact of climate change as a
potential trigger for war]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[NATO has committed to taking a leading international role on climate
and security]{.underline}. Yet [the landmark climate agreement reached
late last year at the COP28 conference in Dubai underscores the need for
Western leaders meeting in Munich to raise their climate ambitions and
translate them into tangible action]{.underline}.

[NATO recognises climate change as a 'threat amplifier' for traditional
security issues]{.underline}, but it needs to go further as studies
indicate [global warming is already rapidly accelerating the likelihood
of armed conflict, especially in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[[Arctic icecaps are melting at record rates]{.mark}, making deposits of
gas, oil and minerals worth trillions of dollars accessible for the
first time. Over the coming years, [this will spark a race for Arctic
dominance that Russia is hellbent on winning]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[With Russia holding over 53% of the Arctic Ocean
coastline]{.underline}, Vladimir [Putin believes domination of the
region's resources is critical to the economic survival of his
regime.]{.underline} The Arctic is estimated to hold 412 billion barrels
of oil and gas, about 22% of the world's undiscovered reserves.

[Putin is hardly trying to hide his agenda. [Russia already operates a
third more Arctic military bases than the US and its NATO
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Now [[Putin is moving soldiers,
icebreakers, warships and submarines to the region]{.mark}, as well as
conducting Arctic drills that test hypersonic missiles capable of
evading American defences]{.underline}.

His propaganda machine regularly releases pictures of troops training in
white fatigues and clutching assault weapons as they zip over the snow
on sleighs pulled by reindeer.

[[It]{.mark} is time for world leaders to act in the knowledge
that]{.underline} failure to urgently address the climate emergency
**[[exposes the world to]{.mark} the risk of [a devastating conflict
between NATO and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**

America and Denmark have filed sovereignty claims in the central Arctic
Ocean but it was Moscow that, in 2007, planted a titanium Russian flag
on the seabed two-and-a-half miles under the North Pole.

**[More aggressive Russian claims in the Arctic could force NATO to act
and risk sparking the global conflict]{.underline}** that the generals
and politicians are warning of. While traditional military preparations
for global war are undoubtedly vital, leaders convening at Munich must
also prioritise climate action to mitigate the risk of global warming
becoming the catalyst for a catastrophic clash.

#### The war in Ukraine makes it [even likelier]{.underline} that Russia will escalate to nuclear use in the Arctic

**Shute 23** \[Joe, journalist, author, and postgraduate researcher at
Manchester Metropolitan University, "An Arctic war is coming," UnHerd,
<https://unherd.com/2023/09/an-arctic-war-is-coming-russia-china/>,
ALB\]

A similar story is being recorded right across the High North. "Arctic
amplification" is the term meteorologists use for the accelerated rate
of global warming. But the same amplification is occurring with the
geopolitics of the region. [The Arctic is melting --- one scientific
study, published in June, claimed that the first summer in which all sea
ice disappears could occur as early as the 2030s --- and, from China to
the US to Putin's Russia, suddenly everyone wants a piece]{.underline}.
The era of "Arctic exceptionalism" declared by Russian president Mikhail
Gorbachev in 1987 is resolutely over, his entreaties for the Arctic to
remain a "zone of peace" free from conflict and exploitation forgotten.
[As climate change accelerates and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has
cleaved apart the international order]{.underline}, **[[the Arctic has
emerged as the]{.mark} potential [theatre of the next global
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Alexander, who also represents the Gwich'in on the Arctic council (which
includes the eight Arctic states, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Iceland, the US and Russia) warns that the global race to
plunder the Arctic could have devastating consequences. "If you don't
co-operate on the Arctic and we don't get these things right, then I'll
tell you this, my friend: the world can change very rapidly."

[[Russia,]{.mark} whose territory spans around 53% of the Arctic Ocean
shoreline, [and China are rapidly developing plans to expand the
Northern Sea Route]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} maritime
[passage]{.mark} between the east and west of the Arctic Ocean [is
regarded by the Kremlin as vital to avoid Western
sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is already possible to navigate the
route for anyone with several briefcases full of dollars to pay for the
mandatory Russian ice breakers which accompany any transit as patrol
vessels. In 2024, the Kremlin is planning to commence year-round
navigations of the route, through which it hopes to increase the amount
of cargo shipped from around 30 million annually to 80 million.

[China --- which has ominously declared itself a "near-Arctic state" ---
also harbours ambitions to transform the passage into a silk road of the
far north]{.underline}, while in March, a Russian delegation to India
held talks over new co-operation over the route. The West is similarly
flexing its muscles, with Finland (and the expected accession of Sweden)
extending Nato's borders into the Arctic. In June, the US Secretary of
State Anthony Blinken announced that the US would be opening an outpost
in the far-north Norwegian town of Tromsø, stressing the need to have "a
diplomatic footprint" above the Arctic Circle. "[The war in Ukraine has
really torpedoed this idea of Artic exceptionalism," explains Dr Neil
Melvin, Director of International Security at the Royal United Services
Institute (RUSI). "The whole focus of northern Europe has basically now
shifted to building security against Russia]{.underline}."

As Melvin points out[, the [heavy losses]{.mark} sustained by Russia's
land army [in Ukraine will force it to become]{.mark} increasingly
[reliant on its nuclear forces stationed in the
Arctic]{.mark},]{.underline} where the UK and US have also long operated
their own attack submarines. [Russia's Northern Fleet comprises of a
dozen or so nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as surface
vessels, including two heavy nuclear-powered missile battle
cruisers]{.underline}. In recent years, [Russia has also reoccupied old
Cold War-era Arctic bases to bolster its presence]{.underline}.
"**[[They will feel more vulnerable as a result of not having a strong
army]{.mark}, and I think [we are likely to see them threaten nuclear
options much more as part of national defence]{.mark}]{.underline}**,"
Melvin says of Russia's designs in the Arctic. "[They are going to be
much more explicit and threatening]{.underline}."

[Beneath the ice, [the Arctic possesses untold riches]{.mark}. The
region is estimated to contain a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil
and gas reserves and rare earth elements]{.underline} such as gold,
nickel and zinc. While most of these are present within the largely
undisputed land borders of the Arctic nations, **[[it is the]{.mark}
increasingly [navigable international waters that present the most
likely flashpoint]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} An ongoing process
led by a United Nations commission is considering sovereignty rights to
the central Arctic Ocean between Russia, Denmark and Canada. While Putin
is cooperating with the process so far, he has also planted a flag in
the most literal sense --- dropping a titanium standard of the Russian
Federation two miles beneath the ocean on the North Pole seabed in 2007.
Fishing rights are also key; as southern oceans heat up, species will
migrate ever further north, causing estimated catches in higher
latitudes to increase by up to 20 per cent by 2050.

[According to Professor]{.underline} Klaus [Dodds, an expert in
geopolitics and ice studies based at Royal Holloway and author of the
recent book, Border Wars, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard could
prove another area of conflict]{.underline}. Under a treaty originally
signed in 1920, a host of countries including China and Russia have
rights to engage in commercial activities across Svalbard. Moscow
conducts coal mining operations on the island of Spitsbergen (and
insists on referring to Svalbard by the same name, to emphasise its
historic claim on the land). In settlements such as Barentsburg, Russian
is the predominant language.

"[The concern is [we know we have potential flashpoints]{.mark} like
Svalbard [which]{.mark}, having caused agitation and tension in the
past, [might be **escalated**]{.mark} **very
[quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Dodds says. [Aggression could be
anything from attacks on underwater cables]{.underline} (last year, a
Russian trawler was linked to the severing of a sub-sea fibre-optic
cable which linked Svalbard to the Norwegian mainland), [to an outright
attack on oil and gas infrastructure]{.underline}. "The Norwegian
European Arctic will be the space where, if anything, this is most
likely to happen," Dodds says. "That would also be the ultimate
opportunity for Russia to test Nato's resolve."

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was **under way**]{.mark}, the "[**fog of
war**" and]{.mark} **rising [unpredictability]{.mark}** [would
**inevitably** set]{.mark} in, **complicating** the implementation of
any]{.underline} predetermined theories of escalation, deescalation and
inter-[conflict management. The **actual** dynamics of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are
**extremely difficult** to predict. Simulations]{.underline} and
table-top exercises can [give]{.underline} only [limited
insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making processes and
interactions.

Still, [Russian military theorists]{.underline} and practitioners seem
to **[assume]{.underline}** that [a conflict with NATO can be
**managed** and **controlled** in a way that would bring it to a **swift
end** consistent with Russian aims. The [Russian **theory**]{.mark} **of
victory**]{.underline} would [seek to [**exploit weak points**
in]{.mark} an [Alliance]{.mark} war effort. Based on the **conviction**
that democracies are weak and]{.underline} their leaders and populations
are [risk-averse, [Russia]{.mark} may **[assume]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} its [[threats of]{.mark} **horizontal** or **vertical
[escalation]{.mark}** [could be]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
[[effective. It would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has **much higher stakes** in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to **[push]{.mark} the [boundaries]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[conflict further. It would]{.underline} most likely [[try to]{.mark}
**test** and **[exploit]{.mark}** potential **[divisions]{.mark}**
within the Alliance, combining **selective diplomacy** and
**activation** of its intelligence assets in]{.underline} some [NATO
states]{.underline} with a degree of selectivity in terms of targets of
particular attacks.

[**[Any]{.mark}** NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} **inevitably**
[have a **nuclear**]{.mark} **[dimension]{.mark}**. The role of
**nuclear weapons** as a tool [for **escalation control**]{.mark} for
Russia has been]{.underline} thoroughly [debated by experts, but
when]{.underline} and how [Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely
showcase or activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**. Beyond]{.underline} catch phrases such as ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.underline} or "escalate to win" [[there are a]{.mark}
**wider [range]{.mark}** [of options for Russian]{.mark} **nuclear
weapon [use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [[a single
**nuclear**]{.mark} **warning [shot]{.mark}** [could be lethal]{.mark}
or non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely
[military target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. [Detonation
could be]{.mark} configured for an **[EMP effect]{.mark}**. A "**false
flag**" attack is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These
options]{.underline} might be used to [**signal escalation** and could
**significantly complicate** NATO's responses]{.underline}.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. [It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be **willing to escalate** the
conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and what
mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.

[The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a conflict with Russia
would]{.underline} probably [have to be limited in order to avoid a
**massive nuclear exchange**. Such limitations]{.underline} would also
involve restrictions on striking back against targets on Russian
territory. But too narrow an approach [could put **too much restraint**
on NATO's operations: the Russian **regime's stability**
may]{.underline} ultimately [need to be threatened]{.underline} in order
[to **force the leadership** into **terminating** the
conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus need to establish what a
proportional self-defence response to Russian actions would involve, and
to what extent cyber operations or attacks against military targets in
quite different parts of Russia would be useful as tools of escalation
to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO Allies, especially
those directly affected by Russia's actions, might pursue their
individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of **[escalation
control]{.mark}**]{.underline} and on lessons [from the Cold
War]{.underline} confrontation [[might be **misleading**]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [**Russia-NATO conflict** would]{.mark} play
out would [be]{.mark} **radically different** from the 20th
century]{.underline} screenplay. Moreover, [instead of
**gradual**]{.underline} (linear) [escalation or **salami tactics**
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline} surprizing [["**leap
frog**" escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly
[connected]{.underline} with actions [in **different
domains**]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack against critical
infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in
responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline} most likely [**not survive** the **first hours**
of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. Both sides are capable of
**underestimating** the **resolve** of the other side to
prevail]{.underline} in a conflict [and the other side's **willingness**
to]{.underline} commit the necessary resources and [endure the costs,
especially once both]{.underline} sides [start committing]{.underline}
their [political capital]{.underline} and resources and the casualties
accumulate.

**The plan fulfills both capacity and capability shortfalls**

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [Has Important Arctic
Capacity and Capability Shortfalls]{.underline}

[Analysis]{.underline} conducted over the course of this project
[suggests that [a primary limitation for the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is capacity]{.mark}, rather than
capability, to operate in the Arctic. ([Capability refers to what can be
accomplished, while capacity refers to the volume, frequency, or
amount]{.mark} that can be done.)]{.underline} In other words, [[there
is no evidence]{.mark} [of other]{.mark} [Arctic actors]{.mark} [being
able to access parts of the Arctic that the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates fundamentally [[cannot]{.mark}, based on
the inventory of U.S. capabilities that are]{.underline} either
currently [available or planned]{.underline} for the near term.
[[However]{.mark}, the team found that [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} (in
both government and commercial interests) [[has the capacity to sustain
a strong day-to-day presence]{.mark} in the maritime Arctic [in a
way]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[does not]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Furthermore, Russian knowledge of operating in varying sea ice
conditions is considerable, although safely navigating the maritime
Arctic appears to be a challenge for all actors. [China's capacity is
also growing, while the capacity of several U.S. allies]{.underline} and
like-minded partners [is also growing or steady]{.underline}, with few
exceptions. [Other Arctic countries also have a strong capability to
operate across the Arctic]{.underline} land, coastal, and air
environments.

**[[The]{.mark} U.S. armed forces' [most-urgent needs for Arctic access
and presence]{.mark} fall into the following categories:]{.underline}**

**[• [assets with proximity to support response]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[• multidomain]{.mark} awareness and
[communications]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[• infrastructure]{.mark} for response and logistics]{.underline}**

**[• [sufficient]{.mark} cadres of [personnel]{.mark} who are trained,
current, and proficient with the skills to operate in
this]{.underline}**

**[harsh environment]{.underline}**

**[• [tactics and equipment for low-probability, high-impact
incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[• [the ability to scale presence]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[In comparing U.S. Arctic capabilities with those of other Arctic
states, the research team observed that [each of four
attributes---capacity, priority, capability, and
interoperability---limits U.S.]{.mark} access to and [presence in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. These attributes are defined in Figure S.1.

Most important is that [the [U.S. armed forces face a lack of
capacity]{.mark} in the region to meet strategic security interests in
ways articulated by national, departmental, and service-specific Arctic
strategies]{.underline}. **[[There are]{.mark} simply [not enough
polar-capable assets and trained personnel to ensure enduring
presence]{.mark} across the region at scale.]{.underline}** Also notable
is that [other Arctic actors' regional capabilities are generally scaled
to their geographies, needs, and interests. In contrast, despite its
polar interests, the United States faces substantial capacity shortfalls
in many areas]{.underline}. For example, as of this writing, [the USCG
had two operational polar icebreakers:the half-century-old heavy
icebreaker USCG Cutter (USCGC) Polar Star and the medium icebreaker
USCGC Healy. Historically, aside from the period when the USCGC Polar
Star was temporarily out of service pending a major refit from 2006
through 2012, the current fleet is the smallest it has been in the past
60 years]{.underline}, as \<CHART OMITTED\> shown in Figure S.2. In the
early 1960s, the USCG had eight icebreakers capable of operating in the
Arctic or Antarctic; as of this writing, it had two active icebreakers
capable of operating in the polar regions.

The capacity attribute is exacerbated by priority at the national level
for the Arctic, which drives decisions about global force management and
capability allocation and apportionment. [The USCG would benefit from
operating in the Arctic with additional joint resources for domain
awareness, communications, and defensive capabilities]{.underline}.
Achieving this end could be hindered at least in part by the priority
attribute, although we acknowledge that undertaking a decision at the
national level to prioritize more resources for the Arctic would
necessarily reduce resources for other important missions. This report
does not offer any recommendations as to whether the Arctic should be
prioritized, just that more assets might be available for the region if
it were afforded even higher priority.

Capability issues also exist, most prominently for domain awareness,
communications, logistics, and USCG defensive measures. However, these
are, in part, similar challenges for all Arctic actors. [The main
difference is that some other actors have prioritized their existing
capabilities for Arctic operations to a greater extent than the United
States has, and they have invested in capacity]{.underline} (i.e.,
having more instances of those capabilities). Finally, [even where
allies and partners have capabilities that can mitigate U.S. military
shortfalls in the Arctic, being able to rely on those capabilities
requires a high degree of interoperability]{.underline}

[Leaving these issues without resolution could lead to]{.underline}
several types of [risk to U.S. regional interests]{.underline},
including the following:

• potential inability to fulfill responsibilities (e.g., for search and
rescue and oil spill response) when called on

• [loss of life, property, economic potential, and environmental
integrity]{.underline}

[• limitations in being able to operate with and rely on
partners]{.underline}

[• growth in Russian control and potential for aggression in concert
with a loss of possible opportunities]{.underline}

[to engage in positive diplomacy]{.underline}

[• expansion of China's regional influence]{.underline}

[• accidental escalation of NATO--Russia tensions]{.underline}

[• global perception of U.S. absence and a security void, which would
exacerbate some of the other risks]{.underline}

• lack of control over Arctic narratives.

#### Capabilities are also key to deter and manage conflict

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs to better secure
its Arctic territories and waters]{.underline}, while working more with
its allies to better secure theirs. Although the Arctic has been
relatively peaceful since the end of the Cold War---a recurring mantra
has been "high latitude, low tensions"---[U.S. military forces need to
be prepared for unexpected conflicts that can erupt
quickly]{.underline}, like Putin\'s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and
Hamas\' devastating attack on Israel.

[[The U.S. military\'s ability to operate effectively in the Arctic is
impeded by]{.mark} various factors]{.underline}. As we described in a
recent report, [chief among these are [the fact that it has so few
assets that can operate in the region and so little
infrastructure]{.mark} there]{.underline}, [particularly in comparison
with Russia]{.underline}. [[Increased investments in platforms,
infrastructure, equipment, communications]{.mark}, multidomain
awareness, [and enhanced tactics and training would enable the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to better
secure its critical interests in the Arctic]{.underline}.]{.mark}

These interests span the vast Arctic region: [the United
States]{.underline} needs to work alongside NATO allies to secure North
America\'s Arctic approaches and its European allies\' long, vulnerable
Arctic coastlines and borders with Russia. It also [has a key interest
in countering Russian submarines at the Arctic\'s edge, where the gaps
between Greenland, Iceland, and Britain are gateways for Russian
submarines to enter the Atlantic. The United States also has homeland
security responsibilities within its own Arctic territory and
waters]{.underline}, where thousands of Americans live. This area also
harvests roughly half of the nation\'s seafood, plus substantial amounts
of oil, zinc, and other resources. As sea ice abates during parts of the
year, the Arctic\'s maritime routes are becoming increasingly important
shortcuts between oceans.

[The importance of the region to overall U.S. interests is highlighted
in the Implementation Plan for the National Strategy for the Arctic
Region]{.underline} (PDF), released in October 2023, and in the 2022
National Security Strategy (PDF). It was also underscored by the U.S.
Coast Guard\'s publication of its Arctic Strategic Outlook
Implementation Plan just a week ago. Although Coast Guard operations in
the Arctic are particularly visible to civilians, the Army, Navy,
Marines, Air Force, and Space Force also conduct training, exercises,
and operations there.

The U.S. needs to work alongside NATO allies to secure North America\'s
Arctic approaches and its European allies\' long, vulnerable Arctic
coastlines and borders with Russia.

[[Challenges from]{.mark} both [Russia]{.mark} and China [underscore the
urgency of improving Arctic military capabilities]{.mark}. Russia was
building up its Arctic military and civilian capabilities in the years
before its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This included re-opening
Arctic bases that had closed after the Cold War, conducting more
extensive training and exercises, stationing more forces in the Arctic,
and operating more throughout the region]{.underline}. It also has over
50 polar icebreakers, far more than any other country. The United
States, by comparison, currently has two, though more are being
acquired.

[China has also become increasingly involved in the region]{.underline}.
[Both of its polar icebreakers have been extensively collecting
information on the Arctic\'s physical environment]{.underline}. [It has
invested, or tried to invest, in Arctic properties from Greenland and
Europe to Siberia, and has secured the diplomatic status of an observer
at the Arctic Council]{.underline}. In an effort to achieve a greater
role in the Arctic, [China has alternately referred to itself as a
"near-Arctic state" and to the Arctic as a shared environment belonging
to all nations, neither of which is accurate]{.underline}. Beijing\'s
increasing collaboration with Moscow across all areas has also been
deepening in the Arctic. The two countries have operated naval vessels
together in the approaches to Alaska during the last few summers, and
also recently signed a maritime law enforcement agreement that
facilitates further Arctic collaboration.

[For the United States]{.underline}, **[[Arctic-specific capabilities
are needed because of the effect of the region\'s unique environment on
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Any system]{.mark} that was
[not]{.mark} specifically [designed for that environment is likely to
fail]{.mark}: fuels gel, materials shatter, lubricants freeze, and
batteries do not work.]{.underline} [The environment is even harder on
people, who struggle just to survive in extreme temperatures. Arctic
operations are further impeded by the region\'s tremendous internal
distances and its remoteness from the rest of the world]{.underline}.
**[[Sparse infrastructure that is relentlessly battered by the
elements]{.mark}, limited satellite coverage, and unique electromagnetic
effects that degrade communications [also contribute to
challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Climate change is also degrading
coastal infrastructure]{.underline} and contributing to less predictable
conditions.

U.S. military services can also make themselves more effective by more
extensively emulating the tactics, training, and equipment choices of
allies that specialize more in Arctic operations than the United States
does. These include Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and even
non-Arctic Britain and the Netherlands. Expanding already substantial
training, exercises, and operations alongside these nations can improve
both U.S. capabilities and interoperability.

U.S. military services can make themselves more effective by more
extensively emulating the tactics, training, and equipment choices of
allies that specialize more in Arctic operations.

[Our report]{.underline} on the U.S. military\'s ability to protect U.S.
national interests and people in the Arctic primarily focused on the
Coast Guard\'s operations there, but also considered those of other
services. It [recommends investing in additional Arctic-capable
platforms and infrastructure]{.underline}. **[[Beyond]{.mark} vitally
needed [icebreakers, other investments include a]{.mark} deepwater [port
in Nome, more ground transportation infrastructure, more communications
infrastructure, and systems that contribute to multidomain
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Given the destructive power of the
Arctic environment, these investments will require more intensive and
frequent maintenance than is required for comparable systems at lower
latitudes]{.underline}.

In addition, there is a need for more personnel to be trained to operate
in Arctic conditions. Maintaining personnel in this environment and the
resources needed to support them will also require sustained
investments. Another good investment would be in enabling some future
icebreakers to be homeported in New England, in addition to the current
facilities that exist in Seattle. This would increase the responsiveness
and on-station time for icebreakers addressing the eastern parts of the
North American Arctic and the European Arctic.

[[By making substantial investments in Arctic platforms, equipment,
infrastructure, and training, U.S. military forces will be better able
to shape the Arctic security environment, helping to deter potential
threats]{.mark} and protect U.S. interests in a region that is tightly
linked to overall U.S. interests]{.underline}.

### Advantage Two -- Missile Defeat

[Since the dawn of the Cold War, [the high north has been seen
as]{.mark} an [attractive attack vector for]{.mark}]{.underline} long
range [[strike]{.mark} for one simple reason: [it provides shortest
distance between the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
Eurasia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today, [[the Arctic]{.mark} it [is still
seen]{.mark} by U.S. adversaries like Russia and China [as]{.mark} an
[appealing]{.mark} attack vector for their missiles and long-range
aviation assets [given]{.mark} both the Arctic's geography and
[insufficient monitoring by the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. [The growing Arctic presence]{.underline}
[of China---a self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state" and custodian of an
increasingly robust long-range aviation and missile
inventory---reinforces the region's significance as a staging ground for
conventional air and cruise missile attacks]{.underline}.

Yet [[the U.S. ability to]{.mark} detect, track, [attribute]{.mark}, and
[counter]{.mark} [attacks]{.mark} coming from the north [has]{.mark}
significantly [diminished since the end of the Cold War]{.mark}, even as
America's potential adversaries have prioritized development of missiles
of all types over the same three decades]{.underline}. [China and Russia
have explored options to employ long-range, conventional weapons to
deter U.S. leaders without provoking a nuclear response]{.underline}.
[Chinese doctrine describes precision strikes as a means of "war
control" to manage escalation and frame power-projection
nodes]{.underline}. [Missile warfare is becoming a premier means for
Russia to project power; in Ukraine, Russia has launched hundreds of
ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as suicide drones, targeting
power grids and other critical infrastructure in an attempt to force
Kyiv into a settlement.]{.underline}

[As the 2022 Missile Defense Review noted]{.underline}, [[missile
threats to the U.S. homeland have "rapidly expanded]{.mark} in quantity,
diversity, and sophistication]{.underline}." [Modern conventional cruise
missiles pose the greatest threat]{.underline}; [they are harder to
detect, track, target, and intercept than ballistic
missiles]{.underline}.

[Adversaries have begun to favor cruise missile development over
ballistic missiles because they greatly complicate detection and early
warning. This is part of a broader missile development trend that favors
increasingly maneuverable designs]{.underline}. Hypersonic cruise
missiles, for instance, fly at Mach 5 or faster. While hypersonic
missiles produce a greater heat signature and are less maneuverable,
their extreme speed produces a considerable advantage. China's
fractional orbital bombardment system, or (FOBS), takes this capability
to a still more striking level, with a highly maneuverable hypersonic
glide missile that is launched into orbit and then re-enters the earth's
atmosphere on an unpredictable trajectory.

**[To date, [the U.S. has only mounted a tepid response]{.mark} to these
threats]{.underline}**. **[Throughout the post-Cold War period of the
1990s and early 2000s, [Arctic defense planning took a backseat to other
geopolitical concerns]{.mark} for both the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and Russia. Following the collapse of the
Soviet Union in 1991, the Russian economy imploded, and its Northern
Fleet and air assets fell into disrepair. Post-Cold War arms reduction
treaties, combined with a major shift in the U.S. military's focus
toward operations in the Middle East after Sept. 11, 2001, contributed
to DOD reducing its Arctic focus]{.underline}. [DOD closed or downsized
almost all of its bases in Alaska and significantly shrank other
capabilities for defending the northern approach to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [This is reflected by NORAD's
continued reliance on the aging North Warning System (NWS), a network of
47 long-range and short-range radars first fielded in the 1980s and
equipped with 1970s-era technology]{.underline}.

[This system was only designed to identify approaching Soviet bombers
after launch and flying within radar range]{.underline}. Today, [it
cannot provide early indications and warning of adversary force posture
changes in the Arctic]{.underline}, [which could be a prelude to an
attack]{.underline}. [Nor can the NWS detect air and missile threats
launched from inside Russia or bombers, cruise missiles, drones flying
too low or too far to be detected by its radar]{.underline}.

[As Russia and China develop stealthier cruise missiles and diversify
their cruise missile launch options to include land-based, surface, and
subsurface platforms, the gaps in the North Warning System's effective
radar coverage will continue to increase]{.underline}.

"[[Imagine a solid fence shrinking to a picket fence]{.mark}," notes
Gen. Glen D. VanHerck, head of the North American Aerospace Defense
Command and U.S. Northern Command. "And [now you have cruise missiles
that can get through]{.mark} your capability to detect]{.underline}."

[[The legacy U.S.]{.mark} air and [missile defense]{.mark} paradigm,
focused as it is on kinetic intercept, [remains important and needs to
be]{.mark} urgently [modernized]{.mark}, but an overreliance on kinetic
kill platforms, delivery systems, and weapons alone limits warfighter
options]{.underline}.

[A network of ground-based radars]{.underline}---[including those in the
North Warning System---and a small number of fighters on air defense
alert at air bases around the country provide today's air defense of the
contiguous U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [These fighters are
on alert status to rapidly respond to and intercept foreign military
aircraft, such as Russian bomber patrols that routinely fly near and
occasionally into U.S. airspace]{.underline}. Air Force fighters also
intercept unidentified aircraft, aircraft that have strayed from planned
flight paths, and aircraft that are not properly communicating with air
traffic control.

[The small numbers of fighters and the lack of a system of sensors that
can detect low-flying targets over long ranges limit the system's
effectiveness against modern cruise missiles and other
threats]{.underline}. Air defense systems such as Patriot, Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), or the National Advanced Surface-to-Air
Missile System (NASAMS), which is used to defend the Washington, D.C.,
National Capital Region, offer some defense against low-volume missile
threats, but these low-density, high-demand assets are extremely costly;
they cost more per shot than the missiles they defend against, and are
ineffective against many types of cruise missile and drone threats.

[[U.S. defense leaders have]{.mark} gradually adopted [a new]{.mark}
emphasis over the last decade on a holistic [concept called "missile
defeat]{.mark}." and then than narrowly focusing on kinetic kill options
to deny adversary attacks, [missile defeat involves using the entire
spectrum of options to prevent and defeat missile threats,]{.mark} from
countering proliferation to early indications and warning and, of
course, detection, tracking, and intercepting cruise missiles. It also
seeks to integrate defensive, offensive, passive, kinetic, and
non-kinetic capabilities, such as cyber warfare, directed energy, and
electronic attack.]{.underline}

NORAD/NORTHCOM embraces this new emphasis on domain awareness and
information dominance. [[Early detection of a]{.mark} potential [threat
can open up decision space for U.S. leaders]{.mark}, enabling moves
left-of-launch or even left-of-conflict to reduce the risk of an attack
in the first place]{.underline}. As VanHerck notes, "If I'm shooting
down cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, we've failed in deterrence,
and that's not where we want to be." Domain awareness and information
dominance likewise remain prerequisites for any actions to defeat
missiles right-of-launch---after kinetic or non-kinetic attacks have
occurred.

[However, the new emphasis on domain awareness and information dominance
is not without challenges. VanHerck testified to Congress that [the
missile defeat approach]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[which favors detection
over tracking and countering, [is at risk because of a sheer lack of
capabilities in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The January 2023
intrusion of a Chinese spy balloon into U.S. airspace by way of
northwest Canada caught the nation off-guard and highlighted this severe
lack of domain awareness in the Arctic. VanHerck told lawmakers: "We are
not organized, trained or equipped to respond in the
Arctic]{.underline}."

Another Arctic expert, Ketil [Olsen, formerly Norway's military
representative in NATO and the European Union, who now heads Andoeya
Space, a Norwegian state-controlled company that tests new military and
surveillance technologies, called the region "a dark area on the
map]{.underline}." [[The lack of domain awareness prevents the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [from
obtaining the early warning and intelligence, surveillance, and

A Layered Approach to Missile Defeat

[Recognizing the gaps in U.S. northern tier defenses, VanHerck has
continued to push for a modern, layered air and cruise missile defense,
which involves working with other U.S. combatant commands as well as
allies and partners]{.underline}. He has said NORAD/NORTHCOM's missile
defeat architecture, known as Homeland Defense Design 2035, will be
"vastly different from the way we do it today with fighters, tankers,
AWACS, and those kinds of things."

Weapons

**[DOD is already investing in certain components of air and missile
defense that will improve NORAD's ability to detect, track, attribute,
and counter hostile air threats in the Arctic and across its full area
of responsibility, but [funding for the effort is not coordinated under
one portfolio or a strategy for]{.mark} air and cruise [missile
defense]{.mark} of the homeland. [DOD can achieve a more secure future
by accelerating these efforts]{.mark} and developing a common vision
shared by all the stakeholders in the Arctic.]{.underline}**

Analyzing the risks and opportunities in the Arctic, the Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Studies has developed a framework for a layered
missile defeat approach in the Arctic, with particular emphasis on
left-of-launch detection and tracking.

**[[The first layer is regional threat awareness, consisting of
networked sensors operating in multiple domains to provide early
indications and warning of potential threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Adversaries may show signs of intent by making force posture changes
and logistical preparations in the days, weeks, and even months prior to
an attack]{.underline}. Today for instance, [Russia is building up its
military bases in range of Alaska. By tracking activities that could be
a prelude to hostilities, U.S. leaders could be better equipped to
manage the threat, providing more time and options for the United States
to deter or prevent an attack]{.underline}.

ISR satellite assets that can be used to map out activity and detect
changes in adversary behavior are one obvious and attractive solution to
improve indications and warning in the Arctic. Already, commercial
companies and U.S. partners and allies operating satellites with Arctic
coverage could help fill current DOD satellite gaps.

#### The advantage is not just about missiles over the Arctic -- Arctic early warning infrastructure is crucial to overall missile defense

[The Utility of Situational Awareness in the Arctic]{.underline}

[[Harnessing benefits from tech]{.mark}nological [development is]{.mark}
particularly [important given the ongoing geopolitical changes in the
Arctic]{.mark}. Growing tension between NATO and Russia is likely to
lead to increased naval activity in the High North, where vulnerable
military, communications, and energy infrastructure is at risk of
sabotage and interference]{.underline}. While China is unlikely to
establish a significant presence in the Arctic, monitoring Chinese
maritime traffic and their potential activities in building C4ISR ground
infrastructure remains important.8 Monitoring Russian activity around
its nuclear deterrent posture has been of particular consequence since
the beginning of the war in Ukraine---in September 2024, Russian
president Vladimir Putin announced changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine
involving an "expansion" of its mission, although any substantial
differences are yet to be revealed.9

The White House has already identified C4ISR capabilities as essential
to its Arctic ambitions. Reflecting its "monitor-and-respond" global
posture as outlined in its National Defense Strategy, the United States
asserts a general readiness to respond to threats in the Arctic along
with its regional allies, yet highlights two focal points: the Arctic
(1) houses various early-warning and intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, and (2) acts as the U.S. northern
flank in carrying out Indo-Pacific operations.10 In the strategy's
implementation plan, the first strategic objective is improving the
understanding of the Arctic operating environment, particularly
emphasizing the bolstering of space capabilities and maritime domain
awareness.11

[[The strategic utility of an Arctic presence is considerable for early
warning]{.mark} purposes.]{.underline} [[Its geographical location makes
the Arctic an important vantage point for monitoring potential ballistic
missile launches]{.mark} and other airborne threats.12 Russia and [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates---with its allies---[depend on Arctic
infrastructure for their early warning systems,]{.mark} both [through
ground-based radars and ground stations for]{.mark} satellite
communications [(SATCOM]{.mark}).]{.underline} Russia and China are
increasingly collaborating in developing defense technology, decidedly
prioritizing space and new technologies, and [it is with Russia's
cooperation that China is seeking to develop and deploy its own early
warning infrastructure]{.underline}.13

More broadly, with their increasing dependence on space-based
capabilities for advanced warfare, states seeking global or Arctic
regional coverage for their space systems are reliant on ground
infrastructure in the Arctic due to its latitude-restricting coverage.14
The Arctic is also an ideal location for this type of infrastructure.
Particularly for states with ambitions of global space-power projection
such as the United States and China, this incentivizes a growing
physical presence in the Arctic to support developing space
infrastructure, including dual-use projects.15 China has advanced its
global space capabilities drastically in recent years, and reports have
emerged that Russia is becoming reliant on Chinese satellite imagery of
Ukraine.16 Moreover, the geopolitical tension between NATO and Russia
heightens the risk for assets such as Norway's K-SAT satellite station
on Svalbard and the space-launch capabilities in Andøya, Norway, and
Kiruna, Sweden.17

[[Arctic states are focusing on]{.underline}]{.mark} credible means to

robust air and [[missile defense capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[How might missile defense developments]{.underline} in the Arctic
region including the developments in the Arctic countries [be
viewed]{.underline} from this perspective?

Offensive Developments in the Arctic Region

[As global powers tussle for superiority, the region of the Arctic has
also faced the brunt of great power politics with weaponization and
militarization]{.underline}. Deployment of hypersonic weapon systems
which include Russia's decision to deploy Kh-47 M2Kinzhal hypersonic
missiles puts pressure on strategic stability. [Russia may have tested
or planning to test nuclear capable cruise missiles on its own base in
the Arctic region]{.underline}.\[1\]

[Nuclearization of the region due to deployment of nuclear deterrent
assets make deterrence complex in the region. The Arctic region remains
a hot spot for clashes among powers]{.underline}. [The ongoing Ukraine
War further makes Arctic states apprehensive and concerned about their
own security and seek to develop missile defense
capabilities]{.underline}.

Missile defense systems in the Arctic region could create strategic
destabilization as it could lead to states focusing on offensive means
that could defeat air and missile defense capabilities.

Nevertheless, **[[missile defense capabilities seem to be the perfect
solution]{.mark} at this moment [to strengthen deterrence in]{.mark} the
region [and also strengthens the deterrence of Arctic countries
as]{.mark} intercontinental ballistic [missile]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(ICBM) **[[capabilities]{.mark}, the nuclear deterrence backbone of both
the United States and Russia [have trajectories that cross Arctic
region]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Missile defeat in the Arctic is fundamental to the [entire global nuclear complex.]{.underline} Climate change makes current systems inadequate.

stability, at the time of writing was pursuing her PhD in War Studies at
King's College London, "A Warning About Warming: Climate Change
Threatens Arctic Nuclear Security," December 11,
https://www.rusi.org/networks/uk-poni/nuclear-reactions/warning-about-warming-climate-change-threatens-arctic-nuclear-security)

Early in the Cold War, [security experts recognized the strategic
importance of the Arctic]{.underline}.

[A flight path over the North Pole provided the US and USSR the quickest
route to a nuclear attack on each other.]{.underline} So as early as the
1950s, US military planners worked with their Canadian counterparts to
place radar systems in the far north to detect an incoming Soviet
attack. The Soviet Union based its Northern Fleet in the Kola Peninsula
for similar reasons, leading to regular nuclear submarine patrols
beneath the Arctic's icy surface by the Soviets, Americans, and British
alike.

Today, [[the Arctic remains]{.mark} an [important region]{.mark} in the
global nuclear security complex]{.underline}. [The US and Canada operate
[the North Warning System]{.mark} in the region, [a complex of radars
designed to work with other assets]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as the US
space-based infrared system) [[to provide warning]{.mark} and
classification [of missile threats]{.mark} from that
quarter.]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline}, too, [has placed defense
systems in the Arctic, most recently deploying specially designed
surface-to-air missiles.]{.underline} Its Northern Fleet continues to
operate in the region, with both nuclear-powered icebreakers and
ice-capable corvettes armed with cruise missiles, and President Putin
has made it a priority to recommission old and build new Arctic military
facilities. These nuclear infrastructures and activities, however, are
threatened by the climate changes occurring in the Arctic.

[[Melting permafrost]{.mark}, for example, [will pose a]{.mark} key
[challenge to nuclear infrastructures as the thawing]{.mark} of the
Arctic's underlying land layer [disrupts the structural foundations on
which these systems are built]{.mark}]{.underline}. Take NORAD's North
Warning System, a 1980s era US-Canadian radar system that traces its
heritage to the radars of the 1950s and now itself needs updating.
[Architects will be tasked with designing a replacement system that can
cope with new and continuously changing ground foundations]{.underline},
especially if that system---like its predecessors---is meant to last
30-40 years.

[As the Arctic becomes ice free for longer periods of time each year,
states will also need to adjust their nuclear operations in the
region]{.underline}. For example, Russia relies on the cover from aerial
observation and heightened background noise provided by layers of Arctic
ice to hide its patrolling SSBNs. As that ice melts---with some climate
reports projecting ice-free Arctic summers by 2050---there will be a
greater need for escorts and patrol aircraft to help secure the
underwater battlespace around these SSBNs, with consequent impact on
military resourcing and the potential for encounters between NATO and
Russian nuclear-related military assets.

[Effects like these will only expand as the region experiences more and
more drastic climate changes. [Ground-based defense systems must account
for a wider array of climates, satellites must be positioned to detect
greater activity in the region made possible by melting iceways]{.mark},
and new capabilities must be developed and deployed to effectively
operate in an ever-changing environment]{.underline}.

[The confluence of climate change and nuclear stability therefore merits
significant scrutiny. But expert discourses on climate and security seem
unconnected. In the climate domain, a series of reports citing the rise
in global temperature have gained international attention over the past
few weeks]{.underline}. [This rise is most drastic in the Arctic, where
thawing permafrost and changing weather patterns threaten an already
vulnerable ecosystem and pose fundamental challenges to regional
infrastructures and ways of life]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, a separate conversation focuses on the militarization of the
Arctic. Both Russia and China have increased their presence in the
region amidst growing competition for natural resources and control of
sea lanes made more accessible by melting ice. Russia in particular has
expanded its military capabilities, re-opening Cold War-era bases,
building and deploying icebreakers, and increasing the Northern Fleet's
capabilities and presence in the region. Western states, in turn, have
recognized a need to respond. The UK, for instance, recently released a
report calling for greater attention to Arctic defense initiatives.

While these two conversations largely exist in parallel to one another,
[the pressing challenges that each domain poses to nuclear security in
the Arctic receives even less attention]{.underline}. **[[Considering
the critical role the Arctic plays in the global nuclear security
complex]{.mark} and the potentially drastic effects climate change poses
to the Arctic nuclear infrastructure, [greater acknowledgement must be
given to this link]{.mark} and the broader implications it poses for the
future of deterrence in the 21st century.]{.underline}**

#### Failure to develop these systems in the Arctic leads to war with China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea

[[If there is anything we've learned]{.mark} from the conflicts in
Ukraine and Israel---and [the growing threats from China, Russia, Iran,
and North Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}---it is that **[massed air and
[missile attacks are now]{.mark} a [fundamental]{.mark} component of
modern warfare]{.underline}**. [This puts our U.S. homeland at
risk.]{.underline}

President Trump's executive order calling for an "Iron Dome Missile
Defense Shield for America" to protect against "ballistic, hypersonic,
advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks" is
right on target. Achieving that vision, however, is far from simple.
Fortunately, the U.S. already possesses the building blocks for such a
defense, what we might call a phase one solution. Now we need to get
serious about scaling and employing it.

[Today's threats present a "back to the future" moment. During the Cold
War, when Soviet nuclear-armed bombers and ballistic missiles threatened
the United States and our allies, America invested aggressively,
advancing the state of the art in air defense and early
warning]{.underline} by establishing defenses including 43 primary and
96 supplementary radar sites, mostly in Canada and the northern U.S.,
each designed to detect and track threats. An airborne interceptor
capability composed of over 800 air defense fighters and hundreds of
surface-to-air missiles complemented the early warning systems. [But
[following the Cold War, many of these defenses were
dismantled]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Although air defenses were given a
close look after the attacks of 9/11, [the]{.mark} 2023 [Chinese balloon
fiasco]{.mark} clearly [demonstrated]{.mark} remaining
[deficiencies]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[Today's determined adversaries---China, Russia, [Iran, and North
Korea]{.mark}---are now aligned, as are [their means of
attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [These [include a range of]{.mark}
airborne drones, ballistic [missiles]{.mark}, cruise missiles,
hypersonic missiles]{.underline}, and even a space-based fractional
orbital bombardment system. [Many of these weapons have been employed
against Ukraine by Russia and against Israel by Iran]{.underline}.
**[Yet those attacks pale in comparison to what China or Russia might be
able to muster against the United States in a full-scale
conflict]{.underline}**.

[[By holding U.S. targets at risk, adversaries hope to]{.mark} degrade
core elements of the U.S. national security enterprise and limit
American force projection overseas]{.underline}. **[By keeping U.S.
combat forces focused on homeland defense, they [aim to curb America's
capacity]{.mark} and capability [to repulse China in a fight over the
Taiwan, Russia in Europe, and Iran in the Middle
East.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[This new global security environment requires a U.S. national defense
reset]{.underline}. [As in the Cold War]{.underline}, **[[the U.S.
military must acquire the sensors to detect an attack]{.mark} [and the
interceptors to defeat inbound aircraft and
missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The difference between then and now is
technical complexity. Today's threats are fast, maneuverable, stealthy,
and in some cases can transit both air and space.

[Defending against such threats requires a modern layered
defense]{.underline}. The drone and cruise missile threat highlights the
wisdom demonstrated when the U.S. Air Force, backed by Congress,
committed to replacing the struggling 46-year old AWACS aircraft with
the advanced E-7 Wedgetail early-warning aircraft. Partnering Wedgetail
with long-dwell unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) like MQ-9 Reapers and
RQ-4 Global Hawks can provide an effective initial solution.
[Retrofitted with advanced radars and connected to
interceptors---including both missile-equipped fighter aircraft and
surface-to-air missiles on the ground and at sea---this sensor-shooter,
manned-unmanned solution closes existing coverage gaps, especially in
the high north. Indeed, **[the closest axis of airborne attack for
China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea]{.mark}---every one of them---[is
over the polar region and across Alaska and/or
Canada.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[North Korea's]{.mark} recent [launch of a long-range ballistic
missile]{.mark} over Japan is the latest reminder that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [faces an increasingly perilous
security environment. [It is an environment defined by the expansion of
offensive missile arsenals]{.mark} of potential opponents, who continue
to integrate these weapons into their strategies of coercion,
intimidation, and aggressive military behavior]{.underline}. Today,
[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [possesses defenses against]{.mark}
an intercontinental ballistic missile ([ICBM) attack on the homeland by
"rogue states" like North Korea and]{.mark} potentially
[Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a result of investments made over
the last twenty years in the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system
that presently includes 44 Ground-based Interceptors (GBIs).

However, [over the past half decade, [the missile threat]{.mark} to the
homeland [has become more urgent]{.mark}. [North Korea has launched more
than 30 ballistic missiles]{.mark} in 2022, the most it has ever
launched in a single year, and it is continuing to make progress in its
nuclear weapons program, including preparing for another nuclear
test]{.underline}. North Korea's ICBM launches this year follow the
flight test of two different types of road-mobile ICBMs in 2017, the
2020 display of a new, larger ICBM during a military parade, and the
test of a submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) this past spring.
[Meanwhile, [Iran's continued development of several different types of
space launch vehicles]{.mark}, along with its ongoing pursuit of nuclear
activities, [promises to shorten Tehran's pathway to a]{.mark}
long-range ballistic [missile that can reach the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}.

In response, [U.S. officials are considering how to improve missile
defenses to deter possibly larger and more sophisticated rogue state
missile threats and, if deterrence fails, to continue providing reliable
protection to the nation]{.underline}. At the same time, these
developments have raised concerns among some in the [national security
community that an increase in the scale or complexity of the North
Korean missile threat may eventually overwhelm the GMD system, thereby
calling into question the broader strategic value of improving or
maintaining the nation's missile defenses]{.underline}.

[This argument too readily discounts the contribution missile defense
makes to U.S. deterrence and defense strategy even in the context of an
expanding missile threat. Moreover, it leads to a mistaken "all or
nothing" approach to defending the United States against significant
dangers]{.underline}.

#### War with North Korea is [existential]{.underline}. 

Alex **Ward 18**. Staff writer at Vox covering international security
and defense issues, co-host of Vox\'s \"Worldly\" podcast, formerly an
associate director in the Atlantic Council\'s Brent Scowcroft Center on
International Security where he worked on military issues and US foreign
policy. "This is exactly how a nuclear war would kill you."
https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/19/17873822/nuclear-war-weapons-bombs-how-kill.

But the United States has consistently refused to adopt a "no first use"
policy --- a policy not to be the first one in a conflict to use a
nuclear weapon, and to use them only if the other side uses them first.
That means Trump could theoretically decide to launch a nuclear strike
before an adversary's nukes go off in America. In the heat of battle,
the US military might detect an incoming nuclear attack from North Korea
and the president could decide to respond with a similar strike. Either
way, the president is the one who ultimately decides to put the process
of launching a nuclear strike in motion --- but he still has a few steps
to complete. 2) A US military officer opens the "football" Once the
president has decided the situation requires a nuclear strike, the
military officer who is always by the president's side opens the
"football." The leather-clad case contains an outline of the nuclear
options available to the president --- including possible targets, like
military installations or cities, that the US's roughly 800 nuclear
weapons ready to launch within minutes can hit --- and instructions for
contacting US military commanders and giving them orders to launch the
missiles with warheads on them. 3) Trump talks with military and
civilian advisers The president is the sole decision-maker, but he would
consult with civilian and military advisers before he issues the order
to launch a nuclear weapon. A key person Trump must talk to is the
Pentagon's deputy director of operations in charge of the National
Military Command Center, or "war room," the heart of the Defense
Department that directs nuclear command and control. The president can
include whomever else he wants in the conversation. He would almost
certainly consult Gen. John Hyten, commander of US Strategic Command,
since Hyten is responsible for knowing what the US can hit with its
nuclear weapons. But Trump would likely also include Defense Secretary
James Mattis, National Security Adviser John Bolton, and Gen. Joseph
Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in that conversation as
well. The chat also doesn't have to be held in the White House's
Situation Room; it can happen anywhere over a secured phone line. If any
of the advisers felt such an attack would be illegal --- like if Trump
simply wanted to nuke Pyongyang despite no apparent threat --- they
could advise the president against going ahead with the strike. Last
November, Hyten publicly said he wouldn't accept an illegal order from
Trump to launch a nuclear attack. "He'll tell me what to do, and if it's
illegal, guess what's going to happen?" Hyten told an audience at the
Halifax International Security Forum last year. "I'm gonna say, 'Mr.
President, that's illegal.'" He continued by outlining what the military
could consider an illegal order: if a nuclear attack isn't proportional
to the actual threat, for instance, or if the attack would cause
unnecessary suffering. However, what does and doesn't constitute a
"legal" order is still up for debate and was the focus of a
congressional hearing last November. Either way, if Hyten refused to
follow the order, Trump could fire him and replace him with someone who
would carry it out. 4) The president gives the official order to strike
After the conversation, a senior officer in the "war room" has to
formally verify that the command is coming from the president. The
officers recite a code --- "Bravo Charlie," for example --- and the
president must then respond with a code printed on the "biscuit," the
card with the codes on it. Then members of the "war room" communicate
with the people who will initiate and launch the attack. Depending on
the plan chosen by the president, the command will go to US crews
operating the submarines carrying nuclear missiles, warplanes that can
drop nuclear bombs, or troops overseeing intercontinental ballistic
missiles on land. 5) Launch crews prepare to attack The launch crews
receive the plan and prepare for attack. This involves unlocking various
safes, entering a series of codes, and turning keys to launch the
missiles. Crews must "execute the order, not question it," Cirincione
told Maizland. 6) Missiles fly toward the enemy It could take as little
as five minutes for intercontinental ballistic missiles to launch from
the time the president officially orders a strike. Missiles launched
from submarines take about 15 minutes. And then the president waits to
see if they hit their target. The three main risks of nuclear war ---
and one wild card Those that have nuclear weapons, many have argued,
will never use them. The destruction and human devastation is so
unimaginable that it's hard to believe a world leader will launch them
again, they say. But no one can guarantee they won't be used at least
once more --- and that possibility keeps most nuclear experts up at
night. They disagree wildly as to what the next nuclear use might look
like or how it might happen, but they almost unanimously cite the same
three risks. 1) US vs. North Korea war The [potential nuclear conflict
between [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea
**[[worries]{.mark} most [experts]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- and likely
most people on Earth. That makes sense: [Trump and Kim]{.underline}, the
North Korean premier, [spent most of 2017]{.underline} **[threatening to
bomb each other with nuclear weapons]{.underline}**. Kim actually gained
a missile capable enough of reaching the entirety of the United States,
although questions remain about whether it could make it all the way
with a warhead on top and detonate. Still, [there remains a genuine fear
--- perhaps slightly **allayed**]{.underline} [now following Washington
and Pyongyang's **diplomatic thaw**]{.underline} [--- that the [leaders
might]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[escalate]{.mark} their public [squabble
into]{.mark} a [nuclear conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In February,
Yochi Dreazen wrote for Vox that ["a full-blown war with North Korea
wouldn't be as bad as you think. It would be]{.underline} **[much, much
worse]{.underline}**," in part because
"**[[millions]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- plural --- [[would
die]{.underline}]{.mark}." As Dreazen recounts, [the US would likely
have to send in around 200,000 troops to destroy Kim's nuclear arsenal.
**[Seoul]{.mark}**]{.underline}, South Korea's capital,
[would]{.underline} soon --- if not **[already]{.underline}** [--- lie
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[ruins]{.underline}**]{.mark} [due to North
Korea's large artillery capabilities.]{.underline} None of that may even
be the worst part: Bruce Klingner, a 20-year veteran of the CIA who
spent years studying North Korea, told me that Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein had stood by in 2002 as the US methodically built up the forces
it used to invade the country --- and oust Hussein --- the following
year. He said there was little chance that Kim would follow in Hussein's
footsteps and patiently allow the Pentagon to deploy the troops and
equipment it would need for a full-on war with North Korea. "The
conventional wisdom used to be that North Korea would use only nuclear
weapons as part of a last gasp, twilight of the gods, pull the temple
down upon themselves kind of move," said Klingner, who now works for the
conservative Heritage Foundation. "But we have to prepare for the real
possibility that Kim would use nuclear weapons in the early stages of a
conflict, not the latter ones." In effect, any attempt to overthrow the
[[Kim]{.underline}]{.mark} regime [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} prompt
North Korea to **[[launch nukes]{.mark} at the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. [Washington would almost
certainly]{.underline} [**respond in kind**, [leading to]{.mark} one of
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[worst wars in]{.mark} world
[history]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 2) US vs. Russia war Few experts
discounted the idea that the US and Russia could yet engage in a nuclear
war despite a decades-long standoff. After all, they've come close a few
times. Here are just two examples: In September 1983, a missile attack
system made it seem like the US had launched weapons at the Soviet
Union. One man, Soviet Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov, decided it was a false
alarm and didn't report the alert. Had he done so, Moscow likely
would've responded with an actual nuclear strike. Stanislav Petrov, a
former Soviet military officer known in the West as "The man who saved
the world'' for his role in averting a nuclear war over a false missile
alarm, died in May, 2015 at age 77. Stanislav Petrov, a former Soviet
military officer known in the West as "The man who saved the world'' for
his role in averting a nuclear war over a false missile alarm, died in
May 2015 at age 77. Pavel Golovkin/AP Two months later, a too-real NATO
war game --- Able Archer 83 --- made the Soviets believe Western forces
were preparing for an actual attack. Moscow put its nuclear arsenal on
high alert, but ultimately, neither side came to nuclear blows. Today,
two main reasons explain why a US-Russia nuclear fight is a major
concern. The first is the most obvious: Moscow just has so many nuclear
weapons. Russia is the only country that could match the US
bomb-for-bomb in any conflict. The longer Moscow has its weapons, the
thinking goes, the higher the chance it uses them on the US --- or vice
versa. The second reason is the most troublesome: Washington and Moscow
may be on a collision course. Russia is expanding further into Europe
and encroaching on NATO territory. There's even fear that Putin might
authorize an invasion of a Baltic country that once was a part of the
Soviet Union but is now in NATO. If that happens, the US would be
treaty-bound to defend the Baltic country, almost assuredly setting up a
shooting war with Moscow. Experts disagree on what would happen next.
Some, including the Trump administration, claim Russia would use nuclear
weapons early in a fight as a way to "escalate to deescalate" --- do
something so brash at the start of a conflict that it has to end before
it gets even worse. Others say Russia would use the weapons only if its
forces are on the brink of defeat. Magnets depicting Russian President

Baklitskiy, experts on Russia's nuclear strategy, wrote at War on the
Rocks in February that Moscow's "military doctrine clearly states that
nuclear weapons will be used only in response to an adversary using
nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction," or if the country's
survival is in doubt. In other words, they say Russia would only use
nukes in retaliation or to avoid certain extinction. Washington, of
course, would likely respond with its own nuclear strikes after Moscow
dropped its bombs. At that point, they'd be in a full-blown nuclear war
with the potential to destroy each other and much of the world (more on
that below). 3) India vs. Pakistan war India and Pakistan have gone to
war four times since 1947, when Britain partitioned what had been a
single colony into Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan.
The worry today, though, is that a fifth conflict could go nuclear.

Andrabi/Hindustan Times via Getty Images After decades of testing, India
officially became a nuclear power in 1998. Islamabad, which had started
a uranium enrichment program in the 1970s, soon joined New Delhi in the
nuclear club. Two of their fights --- the 1999 Kargil War and the
2001-'02 Twin Peaks Crisis --- happened with fully functioning nuclear
arsenals, but ultimately, neither country chose to use them. But the
opportunity keeps presenting itself. Each side claims the other has
violated an ongoing ceasefire in the contested, but India-administered,
Kashmir region. The region continues to be roiled by violence; for
instance, six people were killed in separate instances on September 27.
The dispute over Kashmir is a key reason for current India-Pakistan
tensions --- and has the potential to spiral out of control. Javier
Zarracina/Vox Some fear that India and Pakistan may reach for the
proverbial nuclear button sooner rather than later. Here's just one
reason why, according to an April report by Tom Hundley for Vox: The
Pakistan navy is likely to soon place nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on
up to three of its five French-built diesel-electric submarines. \...
Even more disturbing, Pakistani military authorities say they are
considering the possibility of putting nuclear-tipped cruise missiles on
surface vessels. \... Pakistan says its decision to add nuclear weapons
to its navy is a direct response to India's August 2016 deployment of
its first nuclear submarine, the Arihant. A second, even more advanced
Indian nuclear submarine, the Arighat, began sea trials last November,
and four more boats are scheduled to join the fleet by 2025. That will
give India a complete "nuclear triad," which means the country will have
the ability to deliver a nuclear strike by land-based missiles, by
warplanes, and by submarines. In effect, India and Pakistan are in a
nuclear arms race, and historical enemies will soon patrol dangerous
waters in close proximity with nuclear weapons aboard their vessels.
While there's no real indication a fifth India-Pakistan war is on the
horizon, it's possible one flare-up puts both countries on the path to a
nuclear crisis. Wild card: Trump's temperament Cirincione, the head of
the Ploughshares Fund, told me the risk of nuclear war is increasing
because of one factor: Trump. "He is the greatest nuclear risk in the
world, more than any person, any group, or any nation," he said. "The
policies he is pursuing are making most of our nuclear risks worse, and
he is tearing down the global institutions that have reduced and
restrained nuclear risks over the last few decades." Activists marches

against the escalation of threat of nuclear attack between the US and
North Korea. Adam Berry/Getty Images Here's what he means: The
administration's Nuclear Posture Review, released in February, lowered
the threshold for dropping a bomb on an enemy. Basically, the US said
that it would launch low-yield nuclear weapons --- smaller, less deadly
bombs --- in response to nonnuclear strikes, such as a major
cyberattack. That was in contrast with previous US administrations,
which said they would respond with a nuke only in the event of the most
egregious threats against the US, like the possible use of a biological
weapon. The document also calls for more, smaller weapons on submarines
and other platforms to attack enemies. Many experts worry that having
tinier nukes makes them more usable, thereby increasing the chance of a
skirmish turning into a full-blown nuclear war. (Think, for example, of
the US-China trade war escalating to the point that Trump thinks his
only option is to launch a smaller nuke, or how Trump could respond to
Beijing after a devastating cyberattack on US infrastructure.) Plus,
increasing the arsenal in this way would partially undo decades of the
US's work to stop nuclear proliferation around the world. Some experts,
like Georgetown's Kroenig, say having smaller tactical weapons is
actually a good idea. Our current arsenal, which prioritizes older and
bigger nukes, leads adversaries to think we would never use it. Having
smaller bombs that America might use, then, makes the chance of a
nuclear conflict less likely. "It gives us more options to threaten that
limited response," Kroenig told me. "We raise the bar with these
lower-yield weapons." But the Trump risk may have less to do with what
kinds of bombs he has and more to do with his temperament. Take his

this While tensions with North Korea were high early on in Trump's
presidency, he has yet to face a situation, like his predecessors did,
where it seemed nuclear war was likely. The 13-day Cuban missile crisis
in October 1962, where the Soviet Union had secretly placed missiles in
Cuba --- just 90 miles from the US mainland --- comes to mind. Members
of President John F. Kennedy's team, especially his military advisers,
called for airstrikes on Cuba and even an invasion. But Kennedy decided
to set up a blockade of the island and try to work out a diplomatic
settlement with the Soviets, in part because a military confrontation
might turn nuclear. Ultimately, the situation ended when they agreed on
a deal: The Soviets would withdraw the missiles from the island, and the
US would take out its missiles in Turkey. Before that conclusion, both
sides came as close to nuclear war as ever. Customers gather to watch

Collection/Getty Images How would Trump handle himself in a similar
situation? Would he resist the urges of some in his military brass to
strike an enemy --- perhaps with a lower-yield nuke --- or would he
simply tweet out a threat in a hair-trigger moment? The fact is we don't
know --- but what we do know about Trump makes his demeanor in such a
situation a potential, even if very small, nuclear risk. Here's what
happens in a nuclear attack The theory around whether someone might drop
a nuclear bomb takes away from the most serious matter in these
discussions: the human and physical toll. Simply put, a nuclear strike
of any magnitude would unleash suffering on a scale not seen since World
War II. And with the advances in nuclear technology since then, it's
possible the devastation of the next nuclear strike would be far, far
worse. It's hard to picture what the effect of a modern-day nuclear
attack would actually look like. But Wellerstein, the nuclear historian,
created a website called Nukemap that allows users to "drop" a specific
bomb --- say, [the roughly 140-kiloton explosive North Korea tested in
September 2017]{.underline} --- on any target. So I did just that,
detonating that North Korean device on the Capitol building [[in]{.mark}
the heart of Washington, [DC]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and, well, see for
yourself: Christina Animashaun/Vox Roughly
**[[220,000]{.underline}]{.mark}** people [[would die from]{.mark}
this]{.underline} **[[one attack alone]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according
to the Nukemap estimate, [while another 450,000 would
sustain]{.underline} **[injuries]{.underline}**. By comparison,
America's two nuclear attacks on Japan in 1945 killed and injured a
total of around 200,000 people (granted, Hiroshima and Nagasaki had
smaller populations than the Washington metro area). [It's very likely
that North Korea wouldn't launch just one bomb, but]{.underline}
**[multiple]{.underline}** [at DC and likely some at New York City, the
West Coast, and possibly US military bases in Guam and/or
Hawaii.]{.underline} But for simplicity's sake, let's focus on the
effects of this one horrible attack. The center yellow circle is the
fireball radius --- that is, the mushroom cloud --- which would extend
out about 0.25 square miles. Those within the green circle,
approximately a 1.2-square-mile area, would face the heaviest dose of
radiation. "Without medical treatment, there can be expected between 50%
and 90% mortality from acute effects alone. Dying takes between several
hours and several weeks," according to the website. [Radiation poisoning
is a horrible way to die]{.underline}. Here are just some of the
symptoms people sick with radiation get: Nausea and vomiting Spontaneous
bleeding Diarrhea, sometimes bloody Severely burnt skin that may peel
off The dark grey circle in the middle is where a shock wave does a lot
of damage. In that 17-square-mile area, the bomb would flatten
residential buildings, certainly killing people in or near them. Debris
and fire would be everywhere. People in the bigger yellow circle, a
33.5-square-mile area, would receive third-degree burns. "There's a
bright flash of light," Brian Toon, a scientist and expert on nuclear
disasters at the University of Colorado Boulder, told me about when the
bomb goes off. Those exposed to the light, which would stretch for
miles, would get those burns if their skin were exposed. The light would
also "easily ignite fires with flammable objects like leaves, twigs,
paper, or your clothing," he added. The victims may not feel much pain,
however, because the burn will destroy pain nerves. Still, some will
suffer major scarring or have the inability to use certain limbs, and
others might require amputation, according to Wellerstein's site. A

Hiroshima. A mother tends her injured child, a victim of the atomic bomb

the near entirety of the air-blast zone: a 134-square-mile area. People
can still die, or at least receive severe injuries, in that location.
The blast would break windows, and those standing near the glass might
be killed by shards, or at least shed blood from myriad cuts. Those who
survive the bombing and its effects will have to walk through burning
rubble and pass lifeless, charred bodies to reach safety. Some of them
will ultimately survive, but others will succumb to sustained injuries
or radiation. The wind, meanwhile, will carry the irradiated debris and
objects --- known as fallout because they drop from the sky --- far
outside the blast zone and sicken countless others. As for Washington,
it will likely take decades and billions of dollars not only to rebuild
the city but clean it of radiation entirely. [It's worth reiterating
that all of the above are estimates for **one strike on one location**.
An]{.underline} **[actual nuclear war]{.underline}** [would
have]{.underline} **[much wider and more devastating
consequences.]{.underline}** [And [if that war]{.mark}]{.underline}

idea of what a post-nuclear hellscape looks like. After all, disaster
movies are obsessed with that kind of world. But scientists and other
nuclear experts care deeply about this issue too --- and their research
shows the **movies may be too optimistic**.]{.underline} Alan Robock, an
environmental sciences professor at Rutgers University, has spent
decades trying to understand what a nuclear war would do to the planet.
The sum of his work, along with other colleagues', is based on economic,
scientific, and agricultural models. Here's what he found: [The most
devastating long-term effects of a nuclear war actually come down to
the]{.underline} **[[black smoke]{.underline}]{.mark}**, along with the
dust and particulates in the air, [that attacks produce]{.underline}.

The impact on the world, however, depends on the amount of rising smoke.
While scientists' models and estimates vary, it's believed that around 5
million to 50 millions tons of black smoke could lead to a so-called
"nuclear autumn," while 50 million to 150 millions tons of black smoke
might plunge the world into a "nuclear winter." [If the]{.underline}

#### US-Iran war goes nuclear. Extinction. 

Ken **Klippenstein \'3/19**, Independent journalist covering national
security and U.S. politics, \"The Nuclear War Plan for Iran,\"
3-19-2025,
https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/the-nuclear-war-plan-for-iran,
Accessed 4-17-2025 by NT-MP

[To the casual observer that might sound like more of the targeted
airstrikes the U.S. has been doing, but behind the scenes, as the
[**Pentagon** prepares for]{.mark} a \"[**major\" regional war**
with]{.mark} [Iran]{.mark}, the [use of **nuclear weapons**]{.mark} is
on the table.]{.underline}

The [**[new Iran war preparations]{.mark}** that have been underway
since last year [include]{.mark} new **[nuclear
options]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

["One might find it [extraordinary to think]{.mark} that [nuclear
weapons are]{.mark} even **[considered]{.mark}**," a **[retired senior
military officer]{.mark}** who has been [briefed on]{.mark} the
**[planning]{.mark}** tells us, "but [we have]{.mark} [entered]{.mark} a
**[new era]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

The officer says that a combination of factors --- none of them
precipitated by Donald Trump directly --- have created a perfect storm
to bring nuclear weapons back into the picture.

"Reintroducing nuclear deterrence," the officer says, serves three
purposes:

To directly deter Iran from developing nuclear weapons (or then from
using them).

To convince Israel not to use its own nuclear weapons --- that is, by
making it clear that the U.S. equally would (or could) preempt Iran if
something dire happened.

To dissuade Saudi Arabia from perceiving that it has to develop its own
nuclear weapons because Iran is doing so.

To implement these seemingly unconnected national objectives, [Central
Command (**[CENTCOM]{.mark}**), the U.S. combatant command for the
Middle East, is charged with maintaining capabilities to back up
Washington.]{.underline} Today, for instance, the White House claimed
that in a telephone call between Trump and Putin that the two agreed
"that Iran should never be in a position to destroy Israel." To
Washington, an Iranian nuclear program is just "destroy Israel" spelled
another way.

"[Preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon remains a top priority
with global implications," CENTCOM commander Gen. "Erik"
Kurilla]{.underline} told Congress last year. "[We will continue to
develop military options for the Secretary of Defense and President,
should they be necessary."]{.underline}

Down in Tampa where CENTCOM headquarters is located, there is scrambling
to make sure that whatever capabilities exist supports the new position.
The nuclear options are contained in Appendix 1 to Annex C of the Iran
war plans, I am told.

[CENTCOM's [planning for]{.mark}]{.underline} the potential [[**use of
nuclear weapons** in]{.mark} the **[Middle East]{.mark}**]{.underline}
has undergone three significant shifts in the past 45 years.

\<\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS END\>\>\>

Cold War Era The first generation of war plans (called the "OPLAN 1004"
series) were written during the era of the Shah and were completed after
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The plans included the potential use
of nuclear weapons to counter a potential Soviet invasion. This included
two "vertical escalation" options --- referring to stepping upwards on
the nuclear escalation ladder ---, one "passive escalation" envisioning
the 5th Special Forces Group parachuting into northern Iran and
detonating backpack nuclear land-mines on Iranian soil, and the other
"active escalation envisioning B-52 bomber strikes on targets in the
Soviet Union and frontline Army artillery and missile strikes on Soviet
forces in Iran to buy time. The last war plan of this generation was
completed in 1984. "With four decades of hindsight, the idea of the US
and the Soviets engaged in a great battle in the Zagros \[mountains\]
for control of the Middle East seems unrealistic at best," CENTCOM
itself said at a retreat in 2020. Planning for war in the Middle East
was essentially moribund under the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August
1990. CENTCOM OPLAN 1002, finished in the 1994-1995 timeframe, included
a nuclear annex that planned for nuclear strikes against targets in Iraq
and Iran, now in the name of countering proliferation. U.S. policy had
shifted to having the capability to threaten nuclear strikes against any
and all potential nuclear adversaries. War on Terror Era After 9/11, new
"strategic concepts" regarding Iran were articulated by President Bush.
Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and its inclusion in the "axis of
evil" dominated war planning during the next decade. The war on terror
was the singular focus of Washington, and Iraq war planning (now under
CONPLAN 1025 and first prepared in August 2003) ignored nuclear weapons.
CENTCOM continued as a "nuclear" command, but "regional" nuclear
planning was shifted to Strategic Command (STRATCOM) so that Tampa could
focus on the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and counterterrorism. A U.S.
military attack on Iran is \"simply not on the agenda at this point,\"
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in February 2005. That same
month, Lt. Gen. Lance Smith, deputy commander of CENTCOM, said that
there were no new plans to deal with Iranian nuclear weapons. The
command, he said, was focused on Iran's support for the insurgency in
Iraq. In 2008, Iran test fired a new missile capable of hitting Israel.
The next year, it launched a satellite into space. More missiles came.
Gen. James Mattis, who was then CENTCOM commander (and would go on to
become Trump's first secretary of defense) pushed for a regional
collective approach to air and missile defense against Iran but found no
takers. The rest of the Obama administration focused on Iran nuclear
diplomacy and the new war on ISIS, with Iran military options falling
off of Washington's radar screen. The Trump Era When Donald Trump
announced in May 2018 that he was withdrawing from Obama's nuclear deal,
he said that during Washington's singular focus on nukes, Iran had
"escalated its destabilizing activities in the surrounding region."
Trump didn't know it, but he was articulating the Obama administration
"whole of government" approach, that everything was connected. He
reinstated sanctions on Iran and designated the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization. It was the first time
that the U.S. officially identified another country's military as a
terrorist organization. Throughout the next year, Trump imposed more
sanctions even as he articulated that the U.S. "does not seek conflict
with Iran." Iran had other ideas though, and in September 2019, Tehran
shot missiles and drones at Saudi oil facilities. It was at a time when
Secretary Mattis was declaring the war on terror over and a new era of
"Great Power Competition." Iranian attacks continued, and in December
2019, Secretary of State Pompeo said that any attack on a U.S. base by
Iran or its proxies "will be answered with a decisive U.S. response.\"
The next month, Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani was killed in a drone
strike. "They see we have the will to act," said Gen. Frank McKenzie,
the CENTCOM commander at that time. "For far too long, all the way back
to 1979, to be exact, nations have tolerated Iran\'s destructive and
destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond," Trump said in an
address to the nation upon Soleimani's killing. "Those days are over.
Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism and their pursuit of
nuclear weapons threatens the civilized world. We will never let that
happen." That same month, my editor revealed that nuclear weapons were
already back in the picture and that a war game undertaken just days
before Trump was elected in 2016 ended with the U.S. nuking Iran. A new
nuclear weapon was deployed in February 2020, a low-yield warhead for
Trident II submarine-launched missiles. The Pentagon said it was "to
strengthen deterrence." Just days before Biden was elected,
responsibility for Israel shifted under CENTCOM for the first time,
accelerating the current generation of war plans. Iran's development of
a full array of missiles and attack drones, now combat proven in the
Houthi war (and later in Ukraine) finally resulted in the collective air
defense system for the Middle East and even put Arab and Israeli
generals in the same room to discuss common war plans against Iran.
President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Lapid met in Jerusalem in
July 2022 and signed a declaration reaffirming the \"unshakeable U.S.
commitment to Israel\'s security,\" and, as part of the pledge, to use
\"all elements of its national power\" to ensure Iran never acquires a
nuclear weapon. With the Saudis now saying that they could pursue their
own nuclear capability if Iran gets an operational nuclear weapon and
Israel saying that its capabilities against Iran had "dramatically
improved" and that it was "ready for the day when an order is given,"
the Gaza war erupted. The ingredients came together as Iran put its full
might behind Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah and then attacked Israel
directly. The massive use by Russia of Iranian drones (and, more
recently, ballistic missiles) against Ukraine has raised the stakes.

\<\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RETURN\>\>\>

I described yesterday the [general development of the war plans against
Iran]{.underline}, but buried within those plans, I've learned from
[[**procurement documents** and **corporate internal communications**,
including]{.mark} a renewed [focus on nuclear
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} The basic framework of OPLAN 1025
persists, but [behind the "C-Iran" strategy (counter-Iran) to attack
Iran's missile and drone capacity, and now to **[attack
Iranian]{.mark}** **[leadership]{.mark}**, either **[with]{.mark}**
"kinetic" or "non-kinetic" means (including [covert]{.mark} and [cyber
actions]{.mark} and **[s]{.mark}**pecial **[o]{.mark}**peration
**[f]{.mark}**orces) lurked the **[nuclear
options]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

As part of the current "SEED Project" that I described yesterday, there
is a more highly classified nuclear planning effort. Escalating an Iran
conflict to the use of nuclear options can originate in two ways: One,
with the [**[CENTCOM]{.mark}** commander]{.underline} "requesting" the
[**[use]{.mark}** of **[nuclear weapons]{.mark}**, mostly [to stave off
Iranian **conventional military success**]{.mark}]{.underline}; and two,
in a ["**[top down"]{.mark}** order, that is, [by]{.mark} the
[President]{.mark}, mostly [as]{.mark} a "[demonstration" to]{.mark}
"**[signal]{.mark}**" to [Iran]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Once again the [Trident II low-yield option is in Donald Trump's
hands]{.underline}. A submarine can stealthily deploy and the White
House can decide. This is the problem of having secret and unexamined
plans. The option is now available to this president.

In the decade or so I've been reporting, I don't recall ever once
writing about nuclear weapons. Not because it wasn't important, but I
didn't take it seriously and it never seemed real. Now, the [**[nuclear
threat]{.mark}** seems very much a **[live issue]{.mark}** [with]{.mark}
this latest generation of **[detailed military planning]{.mark}** that
could be put in motion at any time and by a single person who has
already shown himself to have a much bigger appetite for risk, even than
in his first time.]{.underline}

[The **[voices of complacency]{.mark}**, those who are telling America
to go back to bed and that everything is under control, will
[insist]{.mark} that [all]{.mark} of this is **[hypothetical]{.mark}**
and that military plans are just plans. (He's just loading the gun and
cocking it, what's the big deal!)]{.underline} As I've shown, the
[**[nuclear options]{.mark}** go way back; but they're now being
[actively modified]{.mark} in completely novel ways]{.underline}. With
Donald Trump openly threatening "the other option," it's surreal that
this isn't front-page news.

#### Missile defense [makes deterrence effective]{.underline} -- Prevents impending conflict with China/Iran/North Korea 

**Peters 25** \[Robert, Senior Research Fellow for Strategic Deterrence
at Heritage, "A Missile Defense Review for the United States,"
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/missile-defense-review-the-united-states>,
ALB**\]**

[[Missiles have become the lynchpin of adversaries' strategies
to]{.underline}]{.mark} deter, [coerce, and [defeat the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates. China, [Iran, North Korea]{.mark}, Russia, and
non-state actors [value]{.mark} the speed, survivability, and
[destructive effects of missiles]{.mark} and have centered their
aggressive military strategies around their use and threatened use to
advance their revisionists' aims at the expense of the United States and
its allies]{.underline}.

[[The ability to defeat missile-based attacks is]{.mark}, by extension,
[the ability to defeat an adversary's theory of victory]{.mark}. Indeed,
[when an adversary believes an attack]{.mark} against the United States
or its allies [will likely be unsuccessful]{.mark}, in addition to
provoking an unacceptable response, [deterrence is more likely to
hold]{.mark}, [and war can be avoided]{.mark}. Or, [should
deterrence]{.mark} nevertheless [fail, missile defenses limit the damage
of adversary strikes]{.mark}, enable more effective responses, and
impose costs that the adversary may prefer to pay
elsewhere]{.underline}.

Thus, it is not surprising that discussions about missile defense, both
regional and for the U.S. homeland, are growing in parallel with the
news around the world. Israel's hyper-effective integrated air and
missile defense (IAMD) system, Iron Dome, has defeated hundreds of enemy
drones and missiles over the course of a few months, not to mention
thousands of shorter-range rockets. Ukraine has used U.S. regional
missile defense systems, such as the Patriot system, to defeat Russian
cruise and ballistic missiles---again demonstrating impressive kill
ratios. In both cases, the adversary has been forced to adjust its
strategy and make costly changes to its weapons, while Israel and
Ukraine defend their most valued assets and retain freedom of action on
how to respond.

Even though there is little difference in the missions assigned to
regional and U.S. homeland IAMD, a decades-long debate has focused on
the strategic value and utility of U.S. homeland missile defenses within
U.S. national strategy. President Donald Trump has repeatedly advocated
an expanded and improved U.S. homeland IAMD system, echoing the
recommendations of the congressionally mandated bipartisan 2023 report
of the Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United
States. Critics, however, believe that expanding and improving the U.S.
ability to defeat adversary missiles, far from countering America's
adversaries' theory of victory, would only cause them to build more
missiles to overcome U.S. missile defenses, raise tensions, and
ultimately undermine U.S. security.

The real-world successes of missile defenses of the past three years in
Ukraine and the Middle East have proven these critics wrong.

The United States has not held a national debate on homeland missile
defense this significant since President Ronald Reagan's 1983
announcement of his Strategic Defense Initiative. Given the increasingly
central role that missiles play in U.S. adversaries' strategy, coupled
with the massive improvement in technology since the 1980s, it is high
time that the U.S. and allied officials seriously consider the strategic
value that U.S. homeland missile defense can provide. This draft MDR
examines why U.S. homeland missile defense can and must play a central
role in the U.S. theory of victory and details the steps that officials
should take to ensure its long-term success in defense of this nation.

This draft MDR therefore provides options to the Department of Defense
(DOD) and guidance to the broader U.S. government as it develops and
fields an integrated missile defense architecture that, along with
America's nuclear arsenal and conventional capabilities, will deter
America's adversaries and safeguard American interests.

Further, this draft MDR provides a framework by which the United States
can deploy a capability that will support the overarching strategic
objectives of the government's National Defense Strategy (NDS) and the
subordinate deterrence objectives of the Nuclear Posture Review (NPR).
Indeed, this draft provides a vision by which missile defense
capabilities can and will be a strategic imperative and provide
defensive capabilities of strategic importance and effect on par with
America's nuclear deterrent.

In support of the NDS, this draft MDR articulates a vision for a missile
defense architecture that integrates existing ground-based midcourse
defense (GMD) interceptors with shorter-range, underlayer defenses
deployed as part of theater IAMD with a space-based missile defense
overlayer capable of intercepting missile threats from all of America's
adversaries---not simply those from rogue states. America's missile
defenses will provide an "Iron Dome--like" protection not only to the
U.S. homeland but will also integrate with theater IAMD architectures of
key allies and partners to obviate and overcome the missile threats
posed by shared adversaries.

[[America's missile defense architecture must]{.mark} and will [change
dramatically]{.mark} from the posture of years past. This necessity is
due to (1) the deteriorating security environment and the growing
missile threats posed by U.S. adversaries; (2) the dramatic successes of
missile defense in real-world operational environments, from Europe to
the Middle East; and (3) the incredible technological breakthroughs that
make possible capabilities that were aspirations in years past. Due to
these three developments, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will not
be able to rely]{.mark} only [on its nuclear arsenal]{.mark} to deter
strategic threats from China and Russia [but will]{.mark} also [have to
rely on]{.mark} its new integrated [missile defense]{.mark} architecture
[to deter]{.mark}---and if necessary, defeat---[strategic missile
threats emanating from]{.mark} the autocrats in Beijing and Moscow,
along with those in [Pyongyang and Tehran]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The world is becoming more dangerous as]{.mark} the [autocrats]{.mark}
and those who oppose U.S. interests [become more emboldened]{.mark}.
Missiles have become a weapon of choice for America's adversaries. U.S.
interests and the safety of the American people require systems that can
obviate these threats]{.underline}. American ingenuity and engineering
prowess can provide the missile defense shield that the American people
deserve.

Conclusions and Recommendations

[[Failing to address the]{.mark} operational [needs of the]{.mark} armed
forces in the [Arctic can lead to multiple types of risks]{.mark}. These
include the international perception of a security void and tacit
tolerance of nefarious Russian and Chinese activities, loss of life,
damage to national security, diminished economic potential,
environmental degradation, and loss of resilience among resident
communities.]{.underline}

[Several of the experts elicited in interviews and the TTX emphasized
the problem of priority given to the Arctic relative to other
acquisition, logistics, personnel, training, and decisions that
facilitate operations in other parts of the United States and
the]{.underline} world. Historically, the United States has invested
federal funds in the Arctic for strategic military or economic reasons
or in support of other national-level goals. [Much less priority and
attention have been placed on fulfilling potential needs to enable
security, safety, and stewardship in U.S.-administered areas of the
region and on the United States' ability to support regional allies and
partners as needed]{.underline}. [This applies to specialized
infrastructure, equipment, and training needed to operate in the region,
as well as to availability of more-generalized capabilities for Arctic
operations, because these are often deemed needed
elsewhere]{.underline}.

We did not formally assess needs in the Arctic relative to other demands
on the U.S. armed forces. The strategic benchmark for our analyses was
in the summary of interests and goals (Chapter 2), examination of
Russia's and China's ambitions and activities in the region (Appendix B,
available online), and a look at ongoing regional disputes (Appendix H,
available online). Policymakers will need to consider what other global
or domestic aims will need to give to enable more focus on the Arctic.

[In the remainder of this chapter, we offer seven broadly formulated
recommendations that describe some pathways through which the United
States can begin or continue taking steps to address the central issues
of capacity, priority, interoperability, and capability
(]{.underline}Appendix C, available online).

Recommendation 1: Bolster Momentum in Implementing U.S. Department of
Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Department of Defense, and
Military Service Arctic Strategies

Funding and the need to attend to other priorities can make it
challenging to bridge the gap between Arctic strategies and action.
Despite acknowledging the importance of the Arctic, many general
(non-Arctic) U.S. strategy documents that strongly determine or
influence priority-setting at every level of government place the bulk
of their emphasis on other regions. For example, the 2022 National
Defense Strategy recognizes China as the pacing threat for the United
States, although it also acknowledges the continued presence of Russia
as an important problem set.1 Naturally, the United States must make
choices in what to prioritize, and we do not debate these. It is merely
a point of fact that, if the Arctic is not clearly prioritized in
priority setting national strategies, investing in the capabilities,
people, partnerships, and training and exercisesthat Arctic strategies
suggest are needed for securing national interests in the region will
continue to be difficult.

Regularly updating strategy documents, formalizing actions and
collaborations through implementation plans, advocating for stronger
emphasis on the Arctic in national-level strategies and plans as
appropriate, and continuing to place liaisons in other U.S. government
and foreign-partner offices will help to enable momentum and continuity
of effort. Another aspect for which the USCG and DHS could consider
additional advocacy would be for the White House to release a new U.S.
national-level Arctic strategy. At the time of this writing, nearly ten
years and three administrations had passed since a national Arctic
strategy wasreleased. In contrast, both Russia and China have produced
much more-recent Arctic strategy documents.Timely national strategy
documents not only demonstrate and communicate interests in the region
but also provide key guidance to coordinate efforts at securing
interests in dynamically changing security and physical environments.

[Recommendation 2: Continue Efforts to Expand Funding for Priority U.S.
Coast Guard and U.S. Department of Homeland Security Needs]{.underline}

This report and others have articulated numerous needs for improving
Arctic access and presence. We must emphasize that there are no silver
bullets---no single investment will resolve the multitude of problems.
However, we also recognize that not every good investment can be made,
and there are some important first steps that can be taken.

Thus, [we recommend that funding continue for the new icebreakers
(precise numbers and fleet mix to be determined) and an additional
Alaska deepwater port]{.underline}, based on our interviews, TTX, and
modeling. This recommendation follows from the well-documented disparity
in icebreaking capacity between the United States and many other
nations, Arctic and otherwise, that have some icebreaking capabilities,
despite vast size of the U.S. Arctic maritime area (not all requiring
icebreaker support to access) and having national responsibilities at
both poles. This recommendation also draws on the GIS-based analysis of
transit times through the Arctic between port locations. Fully funding
additional icebreakers (PSCs and ASCs) could mitigate presence
shortfalls and increase the likelihood that an icebreaker would be close
enough to any event in the Arctic to effectively address it in time.

Icebreaking vessels are valuable for Arctic surface maritime access, but
we also caution against inflating the need for icebreaking vessels,
considering that the preponderance of Arctic activity (especially by
those arriving in the region from lower latitudes for economic,
military, or other purposes) will continue to be in the expanding warm
season. It might be quite feasible to support many Arctic needs using
ice-hardened or ice-strengthened vessels; more analysis is needed to
determine when these types of assets will be an appropriate option.

Icebreaking vessels are also slow, are needed to support missions at
both poles, and require especially rigorous maintenance. Thus, when
icebreaking vessels are needed to meet the challenging conditions of the
maritime Arctic, multiple vessels homeported on different coasts will be
needed to increase responsiveness:Attempting to support every subregion
of the Arctic from a home port on one coast would result in long delays.
These vessels come with a need for specialized personnel, maintenance,
and logistics. Furthermore, because the Arctic operating environment is
changing, icebreakers might need to carry out and support such functions
as self-defense and law enforcement, which must be considered in their
design.

For example, as noted above, Congress appropriated PSCs for the USCG in
the FY 2021 NDAA and authorized up to six; the USCG's program of record
is for three PSCs. A heavy icebreaker can access almost any location
within the Arctic under most conditions. The problem is that these
assets need to operate across two vast areas at opposite poles of the
planet, and each will be operationally available for only part of the
year because of maintenance and training requirements. Even if they are
homeported in distributed locations, icebreakers' presence is inherently
limited by their small numbers, their slow speeds when breaking ice, and
the Arctic's vast scale. In the TTX, we assumed that additional
icebreakers that had been conceived of but not formally proposed or
funded were not available in 2035, to help us determine whether the
funded icebreakers alone were sufficient; they were not. Fully funding
additional icebreakers (PSCs and ASCs) could mitigate presence
shortfalls and increase the likelihood that an icebreaker would be close
enough to any event in the Arctic to effectively address it in a timely
manner.

Completing the deepwater port at Nome, Alaska, with partners from across
the U.S. government could also prove to be a game changer. This will
emplace a more capable key maritime logistics node in the U.S. Arctic.
With Washington and Maine being the northernmost states on either coast
within the contiguous United States, a deepwater port in northern Alaska
would be a substantial improvement in the timeliness of access to the
Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort Sea areas of the Arctic. This being noted,
there are important local community and environmental considerations
related to port expansion. The high volume of silt from the Snake River
means that deepwater-draft vessel access to the port will need to be
monitored and managed on a regular basis, perhaps via periodic dredging.

[The deepwater port at Nome would also positively affect
logistics]{.underline} but is only one piece. Numerous experts
articulated concerns about fuel, maintenance, and medical logistics in
particular. Given the vastness of distance and general lack of
infrastructure in the Arctic, operators are always concerned about when
and how to refuel, especially if the scale of operations might expand.

[Lack of infrastructure and vast distances also affect maintenance and
medical logistics]{.underline}. At present, the armed forces must return
to lower latitudes in the event of anything beyond very minor
maintenance ormedical issues (or, in the case of the latter, potentially
facilitate transport for the affected people). Once again,this is not an
adequate solution if scaling up presence is the aim.

In addition to new capabilities at Nome, the United States can consider
the possibility of making more use of naval facilities along the New
England coast. This is also a case in which partnering can be useful,
such as when Canada completes refurbishing the Nanisivik Naval Facility
in Nunavut. Additional work on mobile technical capabilities and tactics
should also be investigated. Logistics on the Atlantic side of
continental North America are particularly important for increasing
responsiveness and on-station time in the European Arctic.

Finally, [there could be opportunities for making investments in
"low-hanging fruit" for domain awareness and
communications]{.underline}. This could involve carefully reviewing the
design of new cutters and considering what missions these might conduct
that might require specialized equipment, such as undersea monitoring
equipment to support the defense readiness mission. This could also
involve working with joint partners to determine whether the USCG and
other DHS components, as needed, can take advantage of existing
contracts or plans to buy equipment and services that could help limit
the cost for DHS.

**[[Early Warning Systems The Utility of Situational Awareness in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[Harnessing benefits from technological development is particularly
important given the ongoing geopolitical changes in the Arctic]{.mark}.
Growing tension between NATO and Russia is likely to lead to increased
naval activity in the High North, where vulnerable military,
communications, and energy infrastructure is at risk of sabotage and
interference]{.underline}**. While China is unlikely to establish a
significant presence in the Arctic, monitoring Chinese maritime traffic
and their potential activities in building C4ISR ground infrastructure
remains important.8 Monitoring Russian activity around its nuclear
deterrent posture has been of particular consequence since the beginning
of the war in Ukraine---in September 2024, Russian president Vladimir
Putin announced changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine involving an
"expansion" of its mission, although any substantial differences are yet
to be revealed.9

[The White House has already identified C4ISR capabilities as essential
to its Arctic ambitions]{.underline}. [Reflecting its
"monitor-and-respond" global posture as outlined in its National Defense
Strategy, the United States asserts a general readiness to respond to
threats in the Arctic along with its regional allies, yet highlights two
focal points: the Arctic (1) houses various early-warning and
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities, and
(2) acts as the U.S. northern flank in carrying out Indo-Pacific
operations.10 In the strategy's implementation plan, the first strategic
objective is improving the understanding of the Arctic operating
environment, particularly emphasizing the bolstering of space
capabilities and maritime domain awareness]{.underline}.11

**[[The strategic utility of an Arctic presence is considerable for
early warning purposes. Its geographical location makes the Arctic an
important vantage point for monitoring potential ballistic missile
launches and other airborne threats]{.mark}. Russia and [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates---with its allies---[depend on Arctic
infrastructure for their early warning systems,]{.mark} both through
ground-based radars and ground stations for satellite communications
(SATCOM). Russia and China are increasingly collaborating in developing
defense technology, decidedly prioritizing space and new technologies,
and it is with Russia's cooperation that China is seeking to develop and
deploy its own early warning infrastructure]{.underline}**.13

[DOD and Congress: Next Steps]{.underline}

[[To create]{.mark} the [capabilities]{.mark} needed for this
multi-layered defense, [Congress]{.mark} and DOD [must]{.mark} work
together to]{.underline}:

[Establish a Joint Capability Technology Demonstration Focused on Cruise
Missile Defense of the Homeland. DOD and Congress should launch a joint
capability technology demonstration]{.underline} (JCTD). After
acquisition responsibility for cruise missile defense of the homeland
moved from the Missile Defense Agency to the U.S. Air Force, a previous
JCTD to examine a layered approach to cruise missile defense was scaled
down to focus on the National Capital Region. [Congress and DOD should
fund a broader JCTD to experiment with air, space, surface, and
subsurface capabilities that could provide an overlapping, layered
cruise missile defense for the Arctic.]{.underline}

[[Create a Dedicated Fund to Bolster Deterrence in the Arctic]{.mark}. A
[new North American Deterrence Initiative focused on increasing
investments]{.mark} for cruise missile defeat and bolstering physical
military presence in the Arctic [would shift awareness
left-of-launch]{.mark} and help to reduce overall costs of missile
defeat]{.underline}. The Congressional Budget Office assessed that a
comprehensive missile defense strategy for the contiguous United States
would cost from \$75 billion to \$465 billion for an architecture with
relatively robust funding for right-of-launch defense. [Emphasizing
[left-of-launch capabilities in the Arctic might better bolster
deterrence]{.mark} and reduce costs. A second focus of the new fund
would be physical infrastructure improvements, including pre-positioned,
hardened shelters to store aircraft equipment, spares, and other
logistics needs, and modernizing Pituffik Space Base, DOD's northernmost
installation (formerly known as Thule Air Base, in Greenland).
[Expanding the U.S. military's physical presence in the Arctic is
another key to bolstering deterrence in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Deepen Ally and Partner Ties to Support Arctic Missile Defeat. The U.S.
Government should strengthen and deepen bilateral and multilateral
relationships with Arctic nations to bolster deterrence against air and
cruise missile threats in the region. Allies have their own incentives
to pursue increased capabilities in the Arctic. Denmark, for example,
has already allocated \$245 million to improve drone surveillance in the
Arctic and is modernizing air surveillance in the Faroe Islands, while
Canada is acquiring new drones for Arctic domain awareness. Norway is
already working with the United States to launch communications
satellite payloads.

[In addition, uncrewed aircraft that are operational today---such as the
MQ-9 Reaper and RQ-4 Global Hawk---can also contribute to regional
threat awareness. The MQ-9 can carry a variety of sensors, including
maritime surveillance radar and a signals intelligence payload. The
high-altitude, long-duration RQ-4 carries a synthetic aperture radar
that can persistently map an adversary's Arctic infrastructure and
activities on a persistent basis. They can also be equipped with
defensive payloads, such as electronic countermeasures, to help dissuade
or prevent adversaries from targeting these assets]{.underline}.

[[If]{.mark} indications and [warnings suggest an adversary is posturing
for missile strikes]{.mark}, NORAD/[NORTHCOM needs the means to track
suspected strike platforms in the threat detection]{.mark} and
attribution [phase]{.mark} of the framework]{.underline}. [Examples
might include a Russian bomber taking off from an Arctic base where a
ship full of cruise missiles unloaded the week before, or a submarine is
thought to be headed toward Canadian waters]{.underline}.

[Routine patrols of MQ-9s equipped with maritime surveillance, signals
intelligence, and electro-optical/infrared sensors could be valuable in
helping to identify the number and type of potential
threats]{.underline}. Likewise, crewed P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and
reconnaissance aircraft could augment MQ-9 tracking operations.

Once a specific threat is detected, defenses must maintain tracking
custody; at this threat tracking point, strikes are expected, and the
goal is to provide target-quality data to kinetic and non-kinetic
effectors, which could take action to deter, prevent, or respond to a
missile launch.

Initial air, surface, and subsurface threat detection and attribution
information could be passed to an over- the-horizon radar (OTHR), which
bounces radar energy off the ionosphere to track targets over very long
ranges---up to 4,000 nm. An OTHR could pass target location information
on to other inhabited and uninhabited aircraft and land-based radars in
the North Warning System that can reconfirm the type and number of
threats.

If available, airborne early warning and control aircraft could be cued
by other sensors to establish a track on airborne threat aircraft and
direct fighters or other effectors to the right place at the right time
to counter those threats if necessary. If available, fighter aircraft
such as F-35A Lightning II jets, with their integrated sensor suites,
could help track and intercept missile launch platforms before they
could launch their missiles.

In the absence of available inhabited aircraft, however, it is possible
that an augmented OTHR and the North Warning System could help maintain
custody. Current generation UAVs possess neither the radar capabilities
nor the high speeds needed to keep pace with enemy strike aircraft. But
UAVs could be deployed to provide overwatch of likely launch vectors,
accepting cueing data for threats from OTHR and then using on-board
electro-optical and infrared sensors to verify and characterize threat
aircraft. Long-duration UAVs could employ their maritime surveillance
radar to locate and track potentially hostile ships and could be
equipped with sonobuoys to help monitor submarine threats.

Should these left-of-launch actions fail to prevent an adversary from
perpetrating a missile strike, detecting and tracking the missile right
of launch becomes necessary. The Space Development Agency (SDA) has
begun deploying missile-tracking satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO),
which will detect missile launches and be able to track both hypersonic
and ballistic missiles powered by engines that burn hot enough to be
detected.

For cruise missiles, however, inhabited aircraft, including airborne
early warning and control (AEW&C) and fighters with their powerful
airborne moving target radars, would be better able to track and vector
countermeasures, both kinetic and electronic, to intercept incoming
missiles. After this, terminal area defenses would provide the last line
of defense.

Next Steps for the Air & Space Forces

[The first step the Department of the Air Force must take is to exploit
existing weapon systems and accelerate procurement of new ones to
support a missile defeat approach]{.underline}. [As the lead acquisition
authority for cruise missile defense of the homeland, the Air Force will
need to spearhead its own efforts to enhance NORAD/NORTHCOM's emerging
cruise missile defeat approach]{.underline}. Four of the most urgent
areas the USAF should address include:

[[Support for the fielding of a new radar capability in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. The department is funding four new OTHR to
expand coverage in the Arctic, but those systems won't be fully
operational until 2031. [DOD should provide funds to allow the Air Force
to invest the additional \$55 million on NORAD's unfunded priority list
to accelerate OTHR fielding to 2027 and amplify the capabilities of the
North Warning System with an investment of about \$211 million to
acquire nine NORAD-dedicated advanced mobile Three-Dimensional
Expeditionary Long-Range Radars]{.underline} (3DELRR).

[Developing a plan for a rotational UAV presence in the Arctic. With
support from Canadian Forces through the NORAD/NORTHCOM chain of
command, the Air Force should bolster its UAV posture in the Arctic to
support domain awareness]{.underline}. Acting alone or in concert with
other radar platforms, [the MQ-9 and other UAVs can provide ISR across
the layers of a missile defeat strategy. Canada may soon be joining the
United States in operating the MQ-9 Reaper, which would provide
additional ISR capacity and further deepen the U.S.-Canadian NORAD
partnership]{.underline}.

[Accelerating the E-7 Wedgetail. The Air Force is now confronting a
major gap in its battle management capabilities as it retires the E-3
AWACS inventory and waits for the new E-7 Wedgetail to come online, with
the first two arriving in 2027. The U.S. Congress should support an
unfunded \$633 million Air Force request to accelerate procurement of
the rest of the E-7 Wedgetail inventory. This would allow the Air Force
to buy parts in advance to accelerate procurement of the rest of the
inventory to four per year]{.underline}.

[Preserve legacy fighter capacity. The Air Force now plans to retire
over 600 fighters over the next five years, while acquiring less than
half of that number of new fighters. For the homeland defense mission,
the Air Force must rely on its current and planned fighter inventory.
This means the F-35, F-16, and F-15EX should not become targets for
additional force cuts.]{.underline}

[The Space Force, meanwhile, can continue to enhance and expand its
collaboration with the commercial sector to boost satellite capabilities
in the Arctic.]{.underline}

While the SDA is working to rapidly field new satellite architectures
for communications and missile tracking, commercial and scientific
satellites may be able to fill in immediate gaps. NORAD/NORTHCOM should
build on recent prototyping efforts to test commercial satellite
capability in the Arctic to develop a plan to procure commercial
satellite services in the Arctic that can fill gaps until SDA
constellations are fully online.

Establishing Information Dominance

[Arctic domain awareness and information dominance hinge on the ability
to get timely information to decision-makers---that is, both the broad
understanding of the operational environment left-of-launch and the
tactical information required to make an intercept
right-of-launch.]{.underline}

[To achieve that dominance, the U.S. must invest to improve several
capabilities]{.underline}. [Satellite communications are the first
requirement]{.underline}, [essential for early threat indications and
warning because they provide a means to share intelligence with remotely
piloted UAVs flying in the farthest regions of the Arctic, control their
operations, and pipe their feeds back to decision-makers]{.underline}.
Today, satellite communications coverage is sparse in the Arctic, but
both OneWeb and SpaceX's Starlink are expanding their network of
commercial proliferated LEO communication satellites to improve coverage
in the high north. The SDA's ongoing fielding of a satellite
communications transport layer in LEO will also provide high-speed data
connectivity for U.S. warfighters operating in remote regions worldwide,
including in the Arctic.

[Connectivity between UAVs and any other aircraft to the space-based
transport layer requires the benefits of optical communications
technology. Laser communications leverage the highly resilient,
satellite proliferated transport layer now being fielded by the SDA. The
result is high-speed, flexible, and secure communication links across
the air defense network that enables not only force projection abroad,
but also homeland defense. Allies and partners can contribute: Norway's
Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission (ASBM) will launch two satellites
into highly elliptical orbit by 2024, and these will provide improved
broadband satellite communications within the Arctic
region]{.underline}.

[While environmental sensing deep into the Arctic can be facilitated by
an all-weather UAV like the MQ-9B, there is a need for a multi-faceted
approach to sensing weather that affects air, sea, and land operations
in the Arctic]{.underline}. However, [the Defense Meteorological
Satellite Program (DMSP) is well past its lifetime as a
defense-dedicated weather sensor that covers the Arctic in a polar
orbit, and the U.S. Space Force is developing its Electro-optical
Infrared Weather Satellite Program]{.underline} (EWS), [which will
ultimately need to be disaggregated as a constellation of satellites
that provide both higher performance and resilience against attack by an
adversary]{.underline}. While the Space Force is handling the program
well, [Congress needs to ensure adequate resources are available to keep
the program on track.]{.underline}

Artificial intelligence could help get the right information to the
right decision-makers at the right time. NORAD and NORTHCOM have
conducted global information dominance or (GIDE) experiments to fuse
sensor data from a variety of platforms and dramatically reduce the time
required to get threat information to decision-makers. Once one sensor
picks up a potential threat, AI cross-cues that data with other sensor
information to confirm, identify, and attribute the threat. VanHerck
said this enables U.S. forces to go from being reactive to proactive.

Battle management platforms, including AEW&C aircraft, can add to
tactical information dominance once a threat is incoming.

[[This overlapping]{.mark}, layered [approach to missile defeat in the
Arctic can give U.S. leaders more time to proactively]{.mark} shape
adversary behavior and [manage]{.mark} [escalation. Early threat
detection buys time to]{.mark} more effectively [apply non-kinetic
options]{.mark}, including diplomatic, economic, or strategic signaling
actions, such as revealing U.S. capabilities or moving U.S.
forces]{.underline}.

Panel Moderator: Maj. Gen. Larry Stutzriem, USAF (Ret.), Director of
Research, AFA's Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies:

Well, welcome to all. Again, I'm with the Mitchell Institute, and I just
want to give you a pre-commercial. Stop by our booth, sign up,
everything's free that we produce and distribute. [But today, we've got
a tremendous topic, Deterring Russia in the Arctic]{.underline}. And we
know, if you're not aware already, that [the Arctic is rapidly growing
in strategic importance, and we have receding ice because of climate
change and that produces more economical sea lanes than we have
today.]{.underline} It's also providing access to natural resources, and
that's quite profitable. And at the same time, [the Arctic has always
been an avenue of potential attack, be it from missiles, or bombers, or
nuclear submarines]{.underline}. So, **[in an era of great power
competition, Arctic security becomes a front burner,
imperative.]{.underline}**

So here we are today. [Russia has significantly expanded its military
presence and activities in the region. It's leveraged its long Arctic
coastline to project power and threaten the interests of the United
States and our allies]{.underline}. And [deterring Russia's use of the
Arctic to impede the interest of the United States]{.underline} and its
allies, we have represented today, is a big challenge. In particular, it
requires close collaboration among the NATO nations, in particular, the
NATO Arctic nations, and perhaps new initiatives may be proposed today
or are needed in the future, especially with the recent expansion of
NATO membership.

To explore these critical issues, it's a pleasure to host a
distinguished group of us and allied Air power leaders. They all have
rich experience and expertise in Arctic security. First, we're pleased
to welcome from the Swedish Air Force, Major General Jonas Wikman, from
the Royal Norwegian Air Force. Jonas, you're already a star here in
America. That's fantastic. We also have Chief of the Royal Norwegian Air
Force, Major Oivind Gunnerud. Then, of course, we know General Scorch
Hecker, Commander of US Air Forces in Europe and Allied Air Command.
\[inaudible 00:03:10\]. And we also have Lieutenant General Case
Cunningham, Basket. He's got three hats. He's Commander of Alaskan
Command, Alaskan NORAD region, and 11th Air Force. And so welcome,
Generals.

So today, what we're going to do, we don't have a lot of time, but what
we're going to do is three things. One is talk about what Russia is
doing. Number two, what do we need to do from an air and space power
perspective to better deter Russia. Then we'll peel it down a little bit
into some specific issues we've got going. So, for all the panelists,
and we'll start [with General Hecker and move down the line, we know
that Russia's taken significant steps to increase its presence and
capabilities to project power into the Arctic and through the
Arctic]{.underline}. So, I'd like to ask you, what are some of the
examples of these increased military capabilities and activities and
what might be most concerning to you at this time? General Hecker.

Gen. James B. Hecker, Commander, U.S. Air Forces in Europe:

Okay, well thanks, Larry, appreciate that and I appreciate AFA for the
opportunity to talk to the crowd. And I'd really like to thank Junior,
who just took over the Norwegian Chief of Staff of the Air Force two
weeks ago, so pretty good to be up here this quickly. And then, of
course, Basket. Basket only took over here about five weeks ago, so he's
pretty new in the seat as well. So, it's great to have you all here and
great to have you on the panel. [A lot of things concern us when it
comes to Russia and to the Arctic. When you look at their northern
fleet, you talked about that the ice is receding and opening up sea
lanes. They have 55 icebreakers; they have 37 surface vessels, and they
have eight nuclear submarines. So, a pretty big threat.]{.underline}

[When you look at the air, what we're seeing that they're doing is they
have some runways on the north side of their coast on some islands and
they're extending those runways so they can use them with their
long-range aviation bombers. They're also increasing their domain
awareness by adding radars, by adding satellites]{.underline} that they
haven't had before. So, they're getting a lot more information in that
domain way up north than they've had before. So that concerns us.
They're also doing a lot more flying up in the north. I think Basket
will probably talk about it, but they recently did their first bomber
flight with China in the Alaska ADIZ. So that's concerning.

[The other things that is concerning applies to all of Russia, but it
also applies to the Arctic and that's the proliferation of using one-way
UAVs]{.underline}. This has really taken off recently. If you remember
at the start of the war, they didn't really have one-way UAVs, then they
bought some Shahed 136s from Iran and then they built their own factory
in Russia and they're producing them themselves and then they're
producing a lot more. And when I get my reports daily, sometimes it's
30, sometimes it's 60, sometimes it's 90 of these that are going a day.
[And then you add that to the cruise missiles that they already have,
and then you look at what North Korea and Iran are providing them in the
terms of ballistic missiles, it's a threat not only for the
Arctic]{.underline}, but really, for everybody. And we got our eyes on
all of those things.

National Security a Top Line Concern

The Biden administration released its National Strategy for the Arctic
Region in October 2022. It has four pillars: national security, economic
development, infrastructure development, and environment. National
security is the first priority. [In light of Russia's full invasion of
Ukraine, the strategy cites the requirement to protect the homeland and
ensure that the Arctic region is peaceful]{.underline}, with guardrails
to manage competition and resolve disputes without force or coercion.
The strategy also draws attention to China's efforts to increase its
influence in the Arctic, doubling its investments with a focus on
critical mineral extraction and using scientific engagements to conduct
dual-use research in military or intelligence applications in the
Arctic.

[These worries are **not purely theoretical**]{.underline}. [**The
military balance in the Arctic is heavily weighted towards Russia**. It
has more bases than NATO and is upgrading air strips to improve
operability]{.underline}. [Russia's icebreaker fleet vastly outnumbers
NATO states]{.underline}, even with the addition of Finland. [Despite
the Ukraine War, Russia is continuing to invest, maintain and exercise
its forces in its Northern Region]{.underline}, [which is home to many
Russian strategic military assets (ballistic missile submarines,
strategic test sites, advance radar systems, etc]{.underline}.). **[The
shortest distances for a Russian missile or bomber attack against the
U.S. is over the polar cap.]{.underline}**

China also seeks to become a polar great power. Beijing has declared
itself a "near-Arctic state," claiming rights to freedom of navigation
and overflight, scientific research, fishing, and resource development.
China's intelligence-gathering activities became front page news this
year with the detection and eventual downing of a Chinese balloon first
detected near St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea.

[Moscow has historically pushed back against Beijing's interest in the
Arctic to protect its sensitive military assets. However, the war in
Ukraine has changed the strategic landscape. In June, Russian and
Chinese vessels conducted a joint exercise near Alaska's Aleutian
Islands]{.underline}. The U.S. Coast Guard warned the ships off when
they entered U.S.-regulated waters. The U.S. military views this as a
test of U.S. readiness. Since then, there have been other
Russian-Chinese patrols in the area, and the U.S. has made a show of
tracking them.

[The Threat Has Changed]{.underline}

[There is no question -- the North is changing. Warming trends affect
the region as much as four times more than the rest of the
world]{.underline}, [dramatically amplifying sea ice melt, coastal
erosion, permafrost thaw, and myriad other geophysical and
hydrographical characteristics of the region]{.underline}. But [the
change does not end there]{.underline}. [Russia's 2022 invasion of
Ukraine has frozen dialogue and cooperation within the Arctic
Council]{.underline}, little of which has subsequently resumed. Further,
[the demonstrated aggression prompted the unthinkable -- Finland and
Sweden became Allies under the North Atlantic Treaty]{.underline}. The
Arctic now consists of seven NATO Allies and Russia, the latter
increasingly turning to China2) to provide much-needed economic and
technological investment to continue development of northern resources.

[The Arctic is emerging as a new frontier in strategic competition,
which is particularly worrisome given the potential implications of a
growing Sino-Russian partnership]{.underline}. Indeed, [the multi-domain
environment of the North is being shaped by convergence of climate
trends with geopolitical competition, which is increasing concerns for
economic, environmental, and human security]{.underline}. [New
tech]{.underline}nology -- [such as hypersonic missiles -- combines with
evolving gray zone tactics to create a time-sensitive threat
environment]{.underline} that spans traditional military domains.

While the region has always been filled with geopolitical complexities
and a challenging operational environment, [the increasingly global
focus on the North demands that we reexamine its regional security
architecture in order to build better military deterrence]{.underline}
-- while also offering swift response to crisis or conflict by upholding
NATO's commitment to collective defense. The most effective way to
ensure NATO's ability to rapidly respond to potential crises in the
Arctic is to create and empower a distinct NATO JFC focused on the
North.

ALB\]

Over the past five years, [Russia has moved aggressively to build its
Arctic military capabilities]{.underline}, apparently [in an effort to
secure its claims and interests in the region]{.underline}.
Increasingly, [human activity is occurring in the Arctic as the sea ice
recedes and economic opportunity opens to nations via new shipping
lanes]{.underline}. Characteristically, [in any geographical area, with
the rise in human activity there is also the corresponding possibility
that friction will occur as people compete to exploit the natural
resources and corresponding economic possibilities]{.underline}. **[Such
friction---and potential conflict---in the Arctic is highly likely at
some point unless preparations are made to mitigate it.]{.underline}**

Alaska makes the United States an Arctic nation, and its location places
the state and country at the center of this fast-evolving region.2 Thus,
Alaska is critical to the national security of the United States;
however, [we are not, as a nation, keeping pace with the rapidly
changing security situation in the Arctic]{.underline}. Lagging here
could also have an enormous impact on our economy. To change this
dynamic, there are several things that the U.S. military can do to
ensure the future security of the region.

Alaska's Geostrategic Importance

"Alaska is the most strategic place on earth," stated Brig. Gen. Billy
Mitchell in testimony before Congress in 1935.3 The reason for this bold
statement is that Alaska is the closest U.S. location to the center of
the Northern Hemisphere (see figure 1). The state is singularly closer
to many national capitals in the hemisphere than most points in the
lower forty-eight states. This makes Alaska the perfect power projection
platform for the United States from a military standpoint. Further,
because Alaska sits astride the Bering Strait chokepoint and the Great
Circle Routes between North America and Asia as can be seen in figure 2,
it is critical to our economic and national security.4

Graphic courtesy of North American Aerospace Defense Command \[NORAD\];

Alaska is close to the center of the hemisphere and Joint Base
Elmendorf-Richardson \[JBER\] is uniquely positioned to project power.
The distances depicted in nautical miles are to select world capitals
from JBER.)

The air lanes and sea lanes of the Great Circle Routes are heavily
trafficked by shipping companies because they shorten the distance
between the two continents, saving time and money for shippers.
Consequently, the city of Anchorage and Alaska are at the center of
existing commercial shipping lanes between East and West. Anchorage, at
roughly the halfway point between the major commerce centers of North
America and Asia, is an important hub for such international
corporations as Federal Express and DHL.5 Moreover, many nations such as
China and Russia are routinely making use of these routes for their
economic benefit.

However, while Alaska is critical to intercontinental shipping now,
emerging routes due to shrinking ice impediments could raise the state's
economic stature to even greater heights. The retreat of ice coverage in
the Arctic Ocean has opened up the potential for shipping along the
Northern Sea Route and the fabled Northwest Passage (see figure 3).6 The
Northern Sea Route parallels Russia's Arctic coastline, as much of it is
within the country's exclusive economic zone. In the past few years,
shipping along this route has increased, topping out with seventy-one
passages in 2013.7 Moving goods along this route cuts off thousands of
miles, saving money on fuel costs and insurance (since there are no
pirates along this route).8 Moreover, Russia is facilitating passages
through the use of its large icebreaker fleet, making her an
indispensable player in shipping through the High North while profiting
from such transit by charging fees for services akin to a toll.9

Thus, the emerging Northwest Passage has recently become a possibility
for shippers. For centuries, explorers and adventurers sought a route
from Europe to Asia across Canada's High North. Most of these
individuals failed in this attempt, but now the dream is nearing
reality. In 2017, the luxury cruise liner Crystal Serenity made a trip
through the Northwest Passage starting from Seward, Alaska, and
terminating in New York City.10 While much of the Northwest Passage
remains difficult to navigate due to remaining heavy ice pack, continued
ice retreat could make this route feasible in the future. Alaska's
position on the east side of the Bering Strait places the state in a
central position on the choke point of both routes. However, with
increasing human activity, it is inevitable that disagreements among
nations making claims in the area will arise as competition heats up.
Again, Alaska's location thrusts her to the forefront of strategic
calculations that the United States must make to deal with emerging
geopolitical and geoeconomic circumstances.

Incidentally, what makes the Great Circle Route good for shipping also
makes it the preferred route for the employment of missiles aimed at
North America. As previously noted, this route shortens the distance
between the two continents. Just as shippers prefer the route because
the reduced distance saves time and money, the same principle of
distance holds true for ballistic missiles. Potential adversaries could
fire weapons along this trajectory to close the distance more quickly
while lessening the potential for early warning to their attacks. Thus,
Alaska's location makes the state a critical component of the nation's
ballistic missile defense system.

\<FIGURE OMITTED\>

Arctic Natural Resources

In addition to the great potential for shipping through the Arctic,
there is considerable capacity for economic expansion based on the
abundant natural resources in the region. There are across the entire
Arctic oil, gas, coal, rare-earth metals, and fisheries. It is estimated
that 13 percent of the undiscovered oil and 30 percent of the gas
worldwide is in the region, along with a host of other resources.11 As a
result, Arctic nations are very interested in tapping into these to
facilitate economic growth and generate revenue. The retreat of sea ice
and glacial melt is making these resources more accessible to Arctic and
interested near-Arctic nations like China.

The desire to obtain this mineral and energy wealth is stimulating
competition among these countries. All of the Arctic nations have made
claims beyond their exclusive economic zones on the outer continental
shelf so that they have exclusive right to exploit these resources (see
figure 4). Claims are made under the auspices of the United Nations
(UN), which then adjudicates them according to the UN Convention on the
Law of the Sea. The problem is that many of these claims overlap,
complicating the UN's ability to judge in a manner satisfactory to all
the claimants. This in turn gives rise to friction among the nations as
they increasingly confront each other. Herein lies the potential for
conflict in the Arctic region, which has heretofore been known for
regional cooperation and peace.

\<FIGURE OMITTED\>

Sources of Conflict

[The obvious source for possible conflict is the increasing human
contact and the claims put forth by the various Arctic nations. One
nation making such claims in the Arctic region has made a concerted
effort to assert or expand its sovereignty in other areas of the globe
recently; that nation is Russia. The Russian Federation already derives
20 percent of its gross domestic product from economic activity in the
Arctic, and its claims would expand its reach to make further economic
growth possible]{.underline}.12 [Over the past five-plus years, Russia
has systematically embarked on a program to establish new or refurbish
abandoned military bases in the Arctic]{.underline} (see figure 4). [The
reasons for this effort include providing protection to the emerging
Northern Sea Route and securing its economic interests]{.underline}. As
already noted, [the Northern Sea Route has the potential to provide
great benefit to Russia through direct trade or the facilitation of
trade between Asia and Europe]{.underline}. Further, [should Russia win
its claims on the outer continental shelf, it will control vast areas
and resources to its benefit]{.underline}.13 Thus, **[refurbishment and
expansion of new bases is an effort to secure what Russians believe is
theirs. However, this gives rise to the strong possibility of conflict
if other nations do not accept Russian claims]{.underline}**.

[A reason for concern that Russia may press its claims even if the UN
decides against it is based upon recent developments in other regions.
As we have seen over the past four years, Russia has aggressively
pressed forward with territorial claims in its "near abroad" at the
expense of Russia's neighbors.]{.underline}14 [Russia annexed Crimea
from Ukraine in a brazen land grab. Later, under the pretense of
protecting ethnic Russians, it fomented a war with Ukraine to seize
territory on its western border with Ukraine. Most recently, Russia has
intervened in Syria on behalf of Bashar al-Assad's government to prop
that regime up to ensure its survival as well as to enable Russia to
gain access to new locations in Syria from which to stage both Russian
air and sea power in the Mediterranean Sea and Middle East. This raises
the question, Would Russia move in a similarly aggressive manner to
establish military hegemony and control over much of the
Arctic?]{.underline}

#### Russia conflict goes [nuclear]{.underline}.

Leadership Network; European Leadership Network, "Envisioning a

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was **under way**]{.mark}, the "[**fog of
war**" and]{.mark} **rising [unpredictability]{.mark}** [would
**inevitably** set]{.mark} in, **complicating** the implementation of
any]{.underline} predetermined theories of escalation, deescalation and
inter-[conflict management. The **actual** dynamics of]{.underline} a
[conflict]{.underline} and the perceptions of the stakes involved [are
**extremely difficult** to predict. Simulations]{.underline} and
table-top exercises can [give]{.underline} only [limited
insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making processes and
interactions.

Still, [Russian military theorists]{.underline} and practitioners seem
to **[assume]{.underline}** that [a conflict with NATO can be
**managed** and **controlled** in a way that would bring it to a **swift
end** consistent with Russian aims. The [Russian **theory**]{.mark} **of
victory**]{.underline} would [seek to [**exploit weak points**
in]{.mark} an [Alliance]{.mark} war effort. Based on the **conviction**
that democracies are weak and]{.underline} their leaders and populations
are [risk-averse, [Russia]{.mark} may **[assume]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} its [[threats of]{.mark} **horizontal** or **vertical
[escalation]{.mark}** [could be]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly
[[effective. It would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has **much higher stakes** in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to **[push]{.mark} the [boundaries]{.mark}** of]{.underline} the
[conflict further. It would]{.underline} most likely [[try to]{.mark}
**test** and **[exploit]{.mark}** potential **[divisions]{.mark}**
within the Alliance, combining **selective diplomacy** and
**activation** of its intelligence assets in]{.underline} some [NATO
states]{.underline} with a degree of selectivity in terms of targets of
particular attacks.

[**[Any]{.mark}** NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} **inevitably**
[have a **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [dimension]{.mark}**. The role of
**nuclear weapons** as a tool [for **escalation control**]{.mark} for
Russia has been]{.underline} thoroughly [debated by experts, but
when]{.underline} and how [Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely
showcase or activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**. Beyond]{.underline} catch phrases such as ["**escalate to
de-escalate**"]{.underline} or "escalate to win" [[there are a]{.mark}
**wider [range]{.mark}** [of options for Russian]{.mark} **nuclear
weapon [use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [[a single
**nuclear**]{.mark} **warning [shot]{.mark}** [could be lethal]{.mark}
or non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely
[military target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. [Detonation
could be]{.mark} configured for an **[EMP effect]{.mark}**. A "**false
flag**" attack is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These
options]{.underline} might be used to [**signal escalation** and could
**significantly complicate** NATO's responses]{.underline}.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. [It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be **willing to escalate** the
conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and what
mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.

[The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a conflict with Russia
would]{.underline} probably [have to be limited in order to avoid a
**massive nuclear exchange**. Such limitations]{.underline} would also
involve restrictions on striking back against targets on Russian
territory. But too narrow an approach [could put **too much restraint**
on NATO's operations: the Russian **regime's stability**
may]{.underline} ultimately [need to be threatened]{.underline} in order
[to **force the leadership** into **terminating** the
conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus need to establish what a
proportional self-defence response to Russian actions would involve, and
to what extent cyber operations or attacks against military targets in
quite different parts of Russia would be useful as tools of escalation
to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO Allies, especially
those directly affected by Russia's actions, might pursue their
individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of **[escalation
control]{.mark}**]{.underline} and on lessons [from the Cold
War]{.underline} confrontation [[might be **misleading**]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [**Russia-NATO conflict** would]{.mark} play
out would [be]{.mark} **radically different** from the 20th
century]{.underline} screenplay. Moreover, [instead of
**gradual**]{.underline} (linear) [escalation or **salami tactics**
escalation, it is possible to imagine]{.underline} surprizing [["**leap
frog**" escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly
[connected]{.underline} with actions [in **different
domains**]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack against critical
infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in
responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline} most likely [**not survive** the **first hours**
of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. Both sides are capable of
**underestimating** the **resolve** of the other side to
prevail]{.underline} in a conflict [and the other side's **willingness**
to]{.underline} commit the necessary resources and [endure the costs,
especially once both]{.underline} sides [start committing]{.underline}
their [political capital]{.underline} and resources and the casualties
accumulate.

### Capabilities + Capacity Solve

**The aff's mechanisms of capabilities and capacity are crucial to
resolve threats**

Public Policy, "Enhancing Security in a Changing Environment," Testimony

<https://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CTA3097-1.html>, ALB\]

The second risk is related to [the United States' limited ability to
fulfill responsibilities in the Arctic]{.underline}. [Due to limited and
primarily seasonal presence in Arctic areas of Alaska]{.underline},
**[the USCG and other U.S. federal entities lack the typical
infrastructure, capabilities, and capacity found in other areas of
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[that permit the regular and extensive execution of such missions as
search and rescue, law enforcement, environmental response, and disaster
response]{.underline}. From an international perspective, the United
States and other Arctic countries have signed key agreements, including
the Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and
Rescue in the Arctic (2011),7 the Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil
Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic (2013),8 and the
Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation
(2017).Yet [it is not clear whether the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and the other Arctic signatory countries have
the]{.underline} **[capabilities and capacities]{.underline}** [to
fulfill]{.underline} the [responsibilities]{.underline} and needs that
are outlined in these agreements under varying scenarios. However, [many
of the other Arctic countries, including Russia, yield more-extensive
Arctic-based and -focused capabilities, such as in icebreaking and
transportation logistics, for response compared with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.

[From a U.S. perspective, this disparity in capabilities is an important
risk to heed]{.underline} because there is a substantial difference
between conducting SAR missions immediately off the coast of a location
such as the North Slope Borough in Alaska, where local responders may be
able to quickly carry out an active response, and in an area such as
eastern Greenland, where the Ocean Explorer ran aground in September
2023. During this incident---in which there were fortunately no
casualties---it took multiple days for a vessel navigating relatively
nearby to pull the cruise ship free.

Additional consideration must also be given to the ability of the United
States and other Arctic countries to enforce existing agreements. A
recent milestone in Arctic governance was the development of the
International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters (Polar Code),10
through the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO)
and which entered into force in 2017. This code lays out important
guidelines and needs for ships operating in specified areas at high
northern and southern latitudes. Still, in September 2023, Russia
permitted oil tankers without the required hull engineering to transit
the NSR for the first time. It has not been immediately clear what, if
anything, can be done about such code violations in the near term.

A third risk is that the lack of the United States' and other Arctic
states' ability to respond to various possible contingencies in the
Arctic can result in loss of life, property, economic potential, and
environmental integrity. These tragedies can occur anywhere in the
world, but [the Arctic is one region where U.S. readiness to prevent,
mitigate, and respond to life-threatening incidents and other types of
threats is very low due to a combination of limited U.S. capacity and
capabilities in areas relevant to Arctic emergencies, vast distances,
and a harsh environment.]{.underline} Historically [low levels of human
activity and presence in the region have limited the occurrence of such
consequences]{.underline}. Yet, there is much concern surrounding the
potential for increased risks to human life (e.g., through increasing
cruise ship traffic, slow response to storm damage), the environment
(e.g., via fuel spills), and infrastructure (e.g., through storm
damage). For instance, in 2022, Typhoon Merbok severely destroyed
infrastructure and had impacts on many displaced families and
livelihoods in western coastal Alaska, serving as a sobering reminder of
the power that one storm can have.

[The fourth risk focuses on partnering as a way of reducing a country's
risk, especially in a region such as the Arctic where all Arctic states
have fairly limited infrastructure and capabilities]{.underline}.
However, **[without having adequate access and presence, as well as
sufficient capabilities]{.underline}**, to bring to the table, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will be able to participate
only in a limited fashion in exercises relevant to contingency
preparedness, readiness, and response. The United States has tremendous
capabilities across air, ground, maritime, space, and other
areas]{.underline}, some of which are located in Alaska or in other U.S.
states, such as Washington, Maine, and New York, which are
geographically proximal to the Arctic. [The vast majority of these
assets, though not all, are primarily dedicated to such strategic needs
as deterrence and global power projection]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[must also be able to offer
more Arctic-specific or at least Arctic-relevant capabilities in order
to best position itself]{.underline}** to take advantage of what other
Arctic partners have to offer. For example, any theoretical plans to
formally network fuel and connect logistics points across North American
high northern latitudes to enable contingency response would necessitate
the inclusion of locations in Alaska and perhaps Maine and New York to
provide the best value domestically and for potential partners, such as
Canada, Greenland, and Denmark.

The Role of Missile Defense in America's Strategic Posture

[The United States maintains credible nuclear capabilities and highly
lethal, battle-proven conventional capabilities that give its
adversaries pause, deter aggression, assure its allies, and defeat
threats should deterrence fail. A credible, integrated, and multilayered
missile defense architecture is a strategic imperative on par with
maintaining a credible and diverse nuclear arsenal,]{.underline}
particularly in an era when America's adversaries are developing,
deploying, and employing ever-more capable and lethal missile threats.

[Indeed, adversaries may grow more desperate over a prolonged
conventional conflict with a superpower like the United States, leading
them to take riskier strategies like conventional or even nuclear
strikes on the U.S. homeland and its critical infrastructure. To counter
this threat, the United States should deploy IAMD systems that can deter
and defeat such coercive attacks over a protracted conflict and be
prepared to defeat multiple salvos conducted over extended periods of
time. Indeed, it is likely to strain credibility to have defenses that
can defeat a single salvo of attack. A credible missile defense
architecture must be able to defeat (or seem to be able to defeat)
multiple waves of attacks during a protracted conflict.]{.underline}

[There are three possible ways in which the United States can respond to
its adversaries' long-range missile threats]{.underline}---be they
lower-escalation pathway strikes, repeated salvos on the American
homeland during a protracted conflict, or even larger-scale strategic
attacks---to its allies and the American homeland. Washington can ([1)
acquiesce]{.underline} to the wishes of U.S. adversaries and accept a
fragmented NATO, reduced American global influence, and limits to its
ability to project power; (2) [rely solely on the threat of
punishment]{.underline} to deter a growing list of ever-more capable
adversaries from striking civilian population centers; or [(3) build
effective missile defenses to deny U.S. adversaries the ability to
coerce]{.underline} the United States or its allies.

Given the emerging threats and the apparent desire for America's
adversaries to field an arsenal of ICBMs, long-range cruise missiles,
hypersonic capabilities, and FOBS---many of which are optimized to
overwhelm or evade U.S. missile defenses---[the United States must, can,
and will build an integrated, multilayered missile defense architecture
that can deter and defeat coercive strikes]{.underline} on the homeland
while also providing a regional defense of key capabilities overseas.

Indeed, an integrated missile defense architecture that incorporates
existing homeland missile defenses, to include existing GBIs and
regional missile defenses in the Indo--Pacific, Europe, and the Middle
East, and builds additional capacity and capabilities in several key
areas is required given the expanding threats. [Such a missile defense
architecture must perform a number of functions, including:]{.underline}

[Defending the homeland. The United States must ensure that its
population centers and critical locations are protected and
preserved.]{.underline}

[Defending key overseas nodes. Such nodes could be key bases, logistical
sites, or allied population centers.]{.underline}

[Defending the U.S. and its allies against a variety of inbound threats.
Typically, the United States has focused its missile defense on
intercepting ballistic missiles and cruise missiles overseas, and
ballistic missiles at home. Given the evolving nature of the threat, the
United States should field the capabilities necessary to defeat all
nature of inbound threats, to include long-range cruise missiles,
hypersonic threats, and those delivered from orbit.]{.underline}

[Defending the U.S. and its allies against a variety of actors. No
longer should the United States optimize its missile defenses against
rogue actors, such as Iran or North Korea, but it will also field
capabilities that can destroy threats coming from other, more advanced
adversaries, such as China and Russia.]{.underline}

An expanded and improved U.S. homeland and regional missile defense
architecture would support a number of U.S. defense objectives,
including:

**[Deterring attack. Deterrence by denial, which is the ability to
prevent an attacker from achieving his operational objectives, can be a
powerful tool. An effective missile defense architecture that could
credibly intercept a variety of long-range threats from a variety of
actors could deter U.S. adversaries from launching an attack in the
first place because they do not believe that such an attack would
achieve their objectives---and instead, leave them vulnerable to
significant reprisals from the United States]{.underline}**.

Limiting damage should deterrence fail. Even if a missile defense
architecture is not perfect it could significantly limit the extent of
damage through a partial success rate. That is, if an adversary seeks to
destroy six critical targets, even a partially effective missile defense
could ensure that some quantity of those targets survive an attack.

Assuring allies. Regional allies, particularly those located close to
U.S. adversaries and who would therefore be on the front line should a
conflict erupt, often seek assurance that the United States will support
them during times of crisis or conflict. In many cases, their need for
assurance drives their calculations about whether they need an
independent nuclear arsenal. In many ways, the more insecure they feel,
the more likely they are to pursue an independent nuclear weapons
program, which it has been U.S. policy to oppose since 1963. Forward
deploying nuclear weapons is one way to assure allies and convince them
not to pursue their own nuclear weapons programs. Integrated missile
defenses are another important tool.

Finally, it is America's policy that no nation should be allowed to put
nuclear weapons in orbit for the purposes of targeting sites on Earth.
Therefore, the United States reserves the right to destroy,
pre-emptively, any adversary orbital platform that carries nuclear
weapons, and may do so using any tool best suited to the
purposes---whether that tool is based terrestrially or in orbit.

#### Missile defense deters lower level attacks that escalate

**Peters 25** \[Robert, Senior Research Fellow for Strategic Deterrence
at Heritage, "A Missile Defense Review for the United States,"
<https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/missile-defense-review-the-united-states>,
ALB**\]**

The Lower Escalation Pathway Temptation

China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia are challenging American interests
and seeking to constrain American influence and freedom of action around
the world. Russia is attempting to use nuclear weapons to coerce the
West due to its support for Ukraine and has hinted at pursuing a
low-escalation pathway attack on NATO states in pursuit of such a goal.
Other actors may also pursue a lower-escalation pathway attack, as their
missile forces expand and diversify.

[In a lower-escalation pathway, an enemy would attack an American
homeland site, potentially including military assets, with a limited
number of conventional or low-yield nuclear weapons, limiting civilian
casualties, in an attempt to change the behavior of the United
States.]{.underline}

In a low-escalation pathway attack, China or Russia may try to escalate
its way out of a conventional conflict it is losing against the United
States by conducting a series of limited conventional or nuclear strikes
at key targets in the U.S. homeland. These coercive strikes would be
intended to demonstrate enough resolve and result in significant damage
to convince U.S. political leaders to give in to adversary demands but
limited enough in scope and scale (meaning not catastrophic) to not
prompt an overwhelming U.S. response.

This lower-escalatory pathway of forcing a nation to negotiate has not
been tested, but the logic is sound, and there is some indication that
America's adversaries are considering such a strike. China is building a
nuclear arsenal that in the coming years could enable it to carry out
such a strike, and Russia openly discusses the prospects of limited
nuclear strikes against targets in the West.

[The United States' existing approach to missile defense, as enacted
through the Missile Defense Agency, is not comprehensive]{.underline}.
It cannot address lower-escalation coercive attacks from China or Russia
or compete with China's pacing challenge due to the limited nature of
the existing missile defense posture or capacity. According to the DOD's
2023 annual report, Military and Security Developments Involving the
People's Republic of China:

In 2020, the DoD estimated China's operational nuclear warhead stockpile
was in the low-200s and expected to at least double by 2030. However,
Beijing has accelerated its nuclear expansion, and DoD estimates China's
stockpile had more than 500 operational nuclear warheads as of May 2023.
By 2030, DoD estimates that the PRC will have over 1,000 operational
nuclear warheads, most of which will be fielded on systems capable of
ranging the CONUS \[Continental United States\].

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [requires a comprehensive
set of missile defense layers to counter an adversary's lower-escalation
temptation]{.underline}. [A set of comprehensive missile defense layers
that can destroy at least a hundred adversary nuclear-armed
missiles---be they from China, North Korea, or Russia---would
incentivize these adversaries' leaders to abandon plans for "easy
coercion" or "cheap shot" attempts with a few missiles to coerce or
intimidate American political leaders]{.underline}. [Forcing adversary
leaders to consider the lower likelihood of success]{.underline} for
attacks below 100 missiles, in addition to the potential for provoking
an unacceptably damaging U.S. response, [will help to improve deterrence
and raise the threshold for missile-based strikes against the U.S.
homeland. Making escalation more difficult and riskier to achieve lowers
the risk that adversaries will see value in escalation.]{.underline}

While [adversaries]{.underline} might be tempted to execute a
lower-escalation pathway strike (say, firing only a dozen nuclear-armed
missiles at the American homeland) as a high-risk but potentially
high-reward strategy to end a conflict on terms acceptable to them, they
[would be far more cautious about firing more than a hundred
nuclear-armed missiles at the United States]{.underline}. Such a strike
would almost certainly trigger the kind of massive nuclear retaliation
by the United States that they would otherwise try to avoid, in addition
to the uncertainty of success for the initial attack.

In this way, **[a credible and effective multilayered missile defense
architecture could deter America's adversaries from pursuing an
otherwise attractive lower-escalation pathway in the near
future]{.underline}**. Indeed, the existing Ground-Based Interceptor
(GBI) architecture first fielded in 2004---designed to defend against
limited attacks from North Korea---may no longer be sufficient to defend
against even a rogue state attack, given the expansion and maturation of
North Korea's missile program. To put another way, [effective and
credible missile defenses are not a "future like to have"---they are a
"near term must have]{.underline}."

### A2 Asymmetric (Missile Defense Good/Bad\]

#### The thesis of the DA is false -- China and Russia missile defense is already asymmetric to the United States

he leads its Nuclear Strategy Project. He is also an adjunct professor
at Georgetown University's Center for Security Studies, teaching courses

Threats and challenges

First, the expansion of North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM) arsenal will likely drive an increase in the number of deployed
US Ground-Based Interceptors (GBIs) as the United States tries to stay
ahead of the threat. The Biden administration's intent to increase the
number of GBIs by twenty starting in 2028 will [spark a debate about
whether US homeland missile defenses could upset strategic stability
with Russia and China as these countries grow concerned about rising
levels of US homeland missile protection, albeit intended against North
Korea. Some analysts judge that the United States can rely on nuclear
deterrence against North Korea, arguing that staying ahead of the North
Korean threat is unaffordable---**and will upset strategic stability
with Russia and China**]{.underline}.3 [Other analysts find that
reducing US vulnerability to rogue nation missile threats is essential
for a US grand strategy reliant on allies]{.underline}.4 Allies might
perceive a United States unwilling to protect itself against North Korea
as unwilling to take risks on their behalf.

Second, [the United States must now simultaneously deter two
nuclear-armed great powers---Russia and China]{.underline}. A feature of
this problem is a Russian and Chinese nuclear doctrine (supported by
forces) that allows for the limited use of nuclear and conventional
weapons to coerce the United States. According to some US experts,
"Moscow and Beijing appear now to calculate that their respective
threats to escalate to limited nuclear war will be sufficient to
paralyze direct US opposition to their regional expansionism."5 These
forces may include dual-use capabilities to attack US nuclear forces,
command and control, and national leadership. The 2022 Nuclear Posture
Review (NPR) recognizes this problem, stating that the United States
must prepare to deter large-scale and limited nuclear use from its
nuclear-armed adversaries, especially in light of the increasing
reliance on the coercive threat of limited nuclear use in these states'
strategies.6 Likewise, the congressionally mandated Strategic Posture
Commission, a bipartisan twelve-appointee group,7 recommended in its
October 2023 report that the "United States should develop and field
homeland IAMD \[integrated air and missile defense\] capabilities that
can deter and defeat coercive attacks by Russia and China."8

[Another facet of the two-nuclear-great-power problem is the potential
vulnerability of US nuclear forces to a combined or nearly sequential
Chinese and Russian disarming nuclear first strike]{.underline}.9 [As
China expands its nuclear forces, defense strategists must consider
whether US nuclear forces suffice to deter two great powers, perhaps at
the same time, under any conditions. The US ability to retaliate with
nuclear weapons under any circumstances is essential]{.underline}.
**[Layered, preferential missile defenses for US nuclear forces;
national leadership; and nuclear command, control, and communications
(NC3) would enhance US nuclear survivability. Such
defenses]{.underline}**, which would not provide significant protection
for the population, could enhance deterrence by complicating [Russian
and Chinese first-strike plans.]{.underline}10 **[Even short of a
combined disarming strike, missile defense of the nuclear triad could
increase the endurance of US nuclear forces in a limited nuclear
exchange from one power, preserving sufficient nuclear forces to
dissuade an opportunistic aggressor armed with nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}**

Finally, [any assessment of expanding US homeland missile defense should
consider Russia's and China's capabilities in this area. Russia and
China claim a role for missile defense in their security
strategies]{.underline}. [Both are building defenses against cruise and
ballistic missiles (including ICBM defenses). For example, Russian
homeland missile defenses include sixty-eight nuclear-armed interceptors
protecting the Moscow region and likely some portion of Russia's ICBM
force]{.underline}. [Russia's missile defenses are undergoing
modernization with new interceptors. According to the US Department of
Defense (DOD), China is pursuing a ballistic missile defense
architecture with endo- and exo-atmospheric components, including a
midcourse element "that may have capabilities against IRBMs
\[intermediate-range ballistic missiles\] and possibly
ICBMs";]{.underline} further, the "PLA's cruise missile defense
capability is more robust than that of its ballistic missile
defenses."11 **[Defense against US ICBMs and cruise missiles could
provide Russia and China an asymmetric advantage that could impact the
military balance in certain situations and complicate US limited
options.]{.underline}**

### A2 Arms Race (Missile Defense Good/Bad)

#### No arms race from missile defense

**Soofer 25** \[Robert, senior fellow in the Forward Defense practice of

ALB\]

[Addressing Russian and Chinese concerns]{.underline}

[Russia and China will react negatively to any expansion of US homeland
missile defenses, even if intended only to address the North Korean
missile threat]{.underline}. The extent of that reaction is unknowable,
despite past rhetoric. If history is any guide, [an arms race is not the
guaranteed result. Russia could have expanded its nuclear forces when
the United States withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty
in 2002, yet Moscow chose not to do so]{.underline}. Instead, the United
States and Russia reduced their respective deployed strategic nuclear
forces by some two-thirds. [Some have argued that Russia's new novel
nuclear systems and China's new ICBM silos are meant to hedge against
future US missile defenses. Yet, other experienced US researchers reason
that political, rather than strategic, imperatives explain these
actions]{.underline}.18

[Russia's and China's vocal objections to US missile defenses often
reflect strategic posturing rather than genuine security
threats]{.underline}. Both nations have invested heavily in their
missile defense systems and possess substantial offensive capabilities,
suggesting [their concerns are more about maintaining geopolitical
influence than reacting to a direct threat.]{.underline} [Rather than
grow their nuclear forces, Russia and China could choose to expand their
existing homeland defense coverage to a level comparable to future US
deployments, putting these states on an equal footing with the United
States while avoiding an offensive arms race]{.underline}. Regardless,
the United States could consider sharing its intentions and missile
defense plans in a more formal way with Russia and China.

ALB\]

[For the U]{.underline}nited States, [the Arctic remains strategically
relevant for homeland missile defense capabilities]{.underline}. [It
hosts a greater part of the U.S. missile defense architecture meant for
homeland defense]{.underline}. [Alaska, the region that makes the United

States completed construction of Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR)
that would help track and defend against long range ICBMs and hypersonic
weapons \[20\] forming the backbone of US layered missile defense to
protect its homeland.\[21\]

In addition, the United States is also working on Next Generation
Interceptors (NGI) to replace the existing Ground Based Interceptors
(GBIs) which had myriad limitations. The interceptor would need to
counter enemy missiles as well as counter measures fitted on missiles as
well as counter high speed missile systems.

Hence, LRDR could complement the NGIs. **[There are also recommendations
to retain the GBIs also in Alaska owing to the North Korean missile
threats as the GBIs are undergoing Life Extension Program]{.underline}**
(LEP). \[22\] [In the near future, the U]{.underline}nited

ALB\]

In 2005, an anticipated missile threat to the homeland prompted the
expeditious fielding of a missile defense capability to defend the
United States. Today, that threat is real, expanding, and most likely
nuclear. Our defense needs to also be real and effective for today and
into the future.

A recent report by the think tank Rand estimates North Korea has 50
nuclear weapons in its arsenal and, by 2027, will have in excess of 200
and several dozen intercontinental ballistic missiles to complement its
several hundred theater ballistic missiles. The director of national
intelligence's 2021 Annual Threat Assessment clearly states: "North
Korea will be a \[weapons of mass destruction\] threat for the
foreseeable future, \[and\] the country is actively engaged in ballistic
missile research and development."

While we must not cast diplomacy aside, [we should recognize deterrence
is an essential element in any strategy for dealing with the North
Korean nuclear missile threat. Deterrence matters, and Adm. Charles
Richard, commander of U.S. Strategic Command, framed the point well when
he said: "A robust and credible layered missile defense system paired
with our conventional and nuclear force capabilities provide the ability
to deter strategic attacks, deny benefits, and impose costs against any
potential adversary."]{.underline}

[Deterrence discourages an adversary by instilling doubt and anxiety in
their decision calculus. Our Ballistic Missile Defense System "denies
benefit" by planting that seed of doubt in North Korea's decision
calculus; the doubt that an attack on the United States will
succeed]{.underline}.

### Missile Defense Effective

#### Missile defense will work -- deterrence and opponent capabilities prove

**DeBiaso 22** \[Peppi, former director of the DOD Office of Missile
Defense Policy and a nonresident senior associate at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, "Why the US still must invest in
homeland missile defense," Defense News,
<https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2022/09/20/why-the-us-still-must-invest-in-homeland-missile-defense/>,
ALB\]

[North Korea's test of an unprecedented number of ballistic missiles in
2022]{.underline}, including several types of intercontinental ballistic
missiles, [is the latest reminder the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [faces an increasingly perilous security
environment]{.underline}.

[U.S. adversaries continue integrating offensive missiles into their
strategies]{.underline} to support coercion, intimidation and aggressive
military behavior. [While it might be tempting for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to throw up its hands and
allocate missile defense resources elsewhere]{.underline} in this
increasingly unpredictable missile threat environment, **[the U.S.
should instead continue to strengthen its capabilities for effective
homeland defense.]{.underline}**

Today, the nation is defended against a limited ICBM attack on the
homeland posed by the missile arsenals of "rogue states" such as North
Korea and Iran (who is also continuing its pursuit of longer-range
missiles and a nuclear capability). [In response to North Korean and
Iranian efforts, the United States is considering how to improve its
missile defenses to deter possibly larger and more sophisticated missile
attacks and, if deterrence fails, to reliably protect the homeland
against missile attacks]{.underline}.

At the same time, [these developments have raised concerns an increase
in the scale or complexity of the North Korean missile threat may
eventually overwhelm the ability of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense
system]{.underline} [to defend against most or all of these threats.
This possibility calls into question the broader strategic value of
improving, or even maintaining, the nation's missile
defenses]{.underline}.

**[An argument in favor of scaling back missile defense development too
readily discounts the role defenses play in U.S. deterrence and defense
policy]{.underline}** --- even in the context of an expanding missile
threat. Moreover, [it leads to an erroneous "all or nothing" approach to
defending the United States against significant dangers.]{.underline}

At least four crucial considerations help make the case for sustaining
and strengthening the homeland missile defense posture.

[The first is uncertainty around how the threat will evolve over the
next decade]{.underline}. While North Korea is committed to its ICBM
program, the projected size of its arsenal and timing remain uncertain.

North Korea has encountered technical and developmental setbacks in its
ICBM program that not only affect the pace of this threat, but also
raise questions about the operational reliability of such complex weapon
systems --- at least for the foreseeable future.

Second, **[defenses do not have to be large or perfect to inject
complexity and doubt into the adversary's pre-war planning and execution
of missile strikes. Even limited defenses are capable of weakening an
opponent's confidence in its ability to achieve its military
objectives]{.underline}**.

#### New missile defense will work 

**DeBiaso 22** \[Peppi, former director of the DOD Office of Missile
Defense Policy and a nonresident senior associate at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, "Why the US still must invest in
homeland missile defense," Defense News,
<https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2022/09/20/why-the-us-still-must-invest-in-homeland-missile-defense/>,
ALB\]

Third, [even in the face of possible advances in rogue state long-range
missiles, missile defenses provide significant value to blunt blackmail
or coercion where the adversary seeks to test American political
will]{.underline} --- especially by threatening limited strikes. In
these circumstances, defenses would confront the aggressor with the
prospect its attack would be futile, while risking a devastating U.S.
counterattack.

Fourth, [it is dangerously imprudent to rule out the possibility
deterrence might fail. Crises have unpredictable dynamics fraught with
misperception and miscalculation. There will also be situations in which
deterrence may be simply irrelevant]{.underline}, particularly in those
instances where an adversary's ruler believes he has nothing to lose in
launching his ICBMs. [Under these conditions, defenses remain vital to
reducing the scale of destruction in the United States.]{.underline}

The Department of Defense's 2023 budget request takes a number of steps
to align the homeland missile defense posture with increasingly
challenging missile threats. It maintains the bipartisan focus on
sustaining and enhancing the current GMD system while funding
modernization efforts to ensure it can effectively counter larger and
more sophisticated rogue state ICBM threats.

This includes developing a new Next Generation Interceptor expected to
add 20 defensive interceptors and potentially replace the 44 existing
GBIs by the end of the decade. The budget also funds a network of space-
and land-based sensors crucial to tracking and targeting more advanced
ballistic and hypersonic missile threats.

Collectively, [these efforts to build a second-generation homeland
defense system begin laying a foundation to address more capable North
Korean and Iranian missile threats.]{.underline} However, it is
essential for the Biden administration and Congress to not only sustain
current modernization efforts but also define a clear strategy for the
next generation of missile defense concepts, technologies and
capabilities.

[Directed-energy weapons, like high-powered microwave systems and
kinetic interceptors deployed on airborne platforms for boost phase
engagement, hold considerable promise for more effective intercept
capability at lower cost]{.underline}. Progress in the commercial
satellite sector over the last decade has produced more capable, smaller
and cheaper platforms and offers innovative opportunities for advanced
military space-based sensors to defend against more complex missile
threats.

**[While the United States may not be able to eliminate all rogue state
ICBM risks over time, that does not mean it should turn away from
missile defense]{.underline}**. [The United States can reduce these
risks by investing in emerging and disruptive technologies to improve
the capabilities of effective missile defenses while continuing to offer
significant deterrence and, should deterrence fail, a way to limit
damage.]{.underline}

#### The point is to create doubt from adversaries -- we don't have to win total effectiveness

Fifth, **[the objective or purpose of US homeland missile defense is not
to create an impenetrable missile shield for the American public, but
rather to frustrate adversary strategies that rely on threatening
missile attacks against the United States]{.underline}**. [Missile
defense systems are meant to supplement the deterrence value provided by
US nuclear forces and the prospect of an overwhelming conventional
response to attacks against the homeland---not to replace deterrence by
the threat of punishment]{.underline}. [The objective]{.underline} of
the missile defense system [is to create enough doubt in the adversary's
mind about the prospect of a successful attack that the adversary
concludes such an attack is not worth the risk]{.underline}---especially
alongside fears of enormous consequences. In other words, such an attack
would be futile and fatal.

#### No leak proof detection needed and now is key

To summarize, [the missile threat to the homeland is real and growing
and, if left unaddressed, could seriously undermine US grand
strategy]{.underline} and the very basis of national defense strategy.
[Since the objective of missile defense is to]{.underline} supplement
and [enhance deterrence by complicating attacker
plans]{.underline}---[rather than comprehensive population
protection---the defensive architecture does not need to be
leak-proof]{.underline}. Rather[, a layered architecture]{.underline}
with certain key attributes, based on existing and future technology,
[can]{.underline} provide an affordable defense to [restore the basis
for US defense strategy while reassuring allies]{.underline}.

Next, let me discuss why [South Korea -- [Korean Peninsula has **more
favorable conditions for crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait]{.underline}**.
First, **[[geography]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So [[Taiwan enjoys]{.mark}
the **[stopping power of the water]{.mark}** for the PLA to invade
Taiwan. It has to cross the sea of the Taiwan Strait, and [amphibious
attack requires **time for mobilization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Plus,
[[PLA]{.mark}'s preparation for the amphibious invasion will -- at such
a scale, **[cannot proceed without being noticed]{.mark}** by the U.S.

In contrast[, [North]{.mark} Korea [and South Korea]{.mark}, they
[share]{.mark} about **[160 mile-long border on land]{.mark}**, and they
also have [a **record of naval conflict**]{.mark} near the Northern
Limit Line in the west sea. So military conflict is easier to break out
on the land, or near the overlapped sea borders on the Korean Peninsula,
rather than across the sea of the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}

The second condition is [the [Korean Peninsula]{.mark} is [**more likely
to have a conflict** because of]{.mark} the **[frequency of military
exercise]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So the record shows that [both [China
and North Korea]{.mark}, they tend to **[increase]{.mark} military
[provocation]{.mark}** whenever South Korea or Taiwan conduct military
exercise]{.underline}. **[[South Korea implements two]{.mark}
times]{.underline}**, [two combined [exercises with U.S. forces]{.mark}
a year, [and **three national**]{.mark}**-level joint
[exercises]{.mark}**, whereas [Taiwan implements only **one**]{.mark}
**joint exercise** at the national level, Han Kuang, per year. So this
implies that **[North Korea has five times more opportunities to
justify]{.mark} their [aggression]{.mark}**, using South Korea's
military exercises.]{.underline}

Lastly, [conflict on [the Korean Peninsula]{.mark} can
**[escalate]{.mark} much [faster]{.mark}** than Taiwan Strait [because
of **South Korea's**]{.mark} military]{.underline} -- **[[offensive
military doctrine]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So, since 2012, [South Korea
has developed this strategy called [the **Three Axis
System**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So it consists of three parts. First is
[a kill-chain platform, which is [a **preemptive strike
against**]{.mark} North Korea's **[nuclear]{.mark}** and missile
**[facilities]{.mark}**. The second is an **[air- and
missile-defense]{.mark}** system, and third is what they call Korea
Massive **Punishment and [Retal]{.mark}iation [Plan]{.mark}**, such as
precision missile attack or infiltration of special operational forces
for leadership decapitation. All this part -- all these strategies are
recorded openly at the South Korea white defense paper.]{.underline}

In comparison, [[Taiwan's]{.mark} military [strategy is
**defensive**]{.mark} in nature]{.underline}. Taiwan's defense white
paper explains that [Taiwan will focus on attack the enemy at the most
vulnerable, Strait-crossing phase]{.underline}. So they understand [the
geographical advantage of the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}. [Taiwan's
strategy [does not include]{.mark} **preemptive or [retal]{.mark}iatory
[strike]{.mark}** [against PLA]{.mark} military bases on the mainland,
[or **decapitation operations**]{.mark} in Beijing]{.underline}. But
**[South Korea does have that,]{.underline}** and they openly say that.

So, to summarize, all these elements -- Korean Peninsula's geography,
the heightened state of everyday confrontation, and South Korea's
offensive doctrine -- suggests that even if Kim Jongun does not have any
intention to start a major crisis, a limited -- even a limited offense
on the Korean territory can quickly escalate into a bigger crisis than
Kim Jong-un himself may intend in the first place.

So [[accidental clash]{.mark} is [**more likely to happen** on the
Korean Peninsula]{.mark}]{.underline} [than]{.underline} -- [**[and
escalate much faster]{.underline}** [than Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Strait]{.underline}. Of course, I do not mean to underestimate China's
threat posed to Taiwan. However, China's military challenges in the
Taiwan Strait are uncertain, but within predictable range, whereas
[North Korea's military provocation and their chain reactions are
certainly unpredictable]{.underline}.

#### [Independently]{.underline}, interception of North Korean missile launches triggers [US-Russia war]{.underline}.

Accidentally Trigger a U.S.-Russia Nuclear War"
https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-a-north-korean-missile-could-accidentally-trigger-a-us-russia-nuclear-war?ref=scroll\]

[You]{.underline} might have [heard]{.underline} that
[No]{.underline}rth [Ko]{.underline}rea [launched an
i]{.underline}nter[c]{.underline}ontinental [b]{.underline}allistic
[m]{.underline}issile this week. Well, [not in Russia!]{.underline} [The
[Russian]{.mark} government]{.underline} is [stubbornly
[insisting]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the [missile]{.mark}
launched]{.underline} [by North Korea]{.underline} on Tuesday morning
[[was]{.underline}]{.mark} merely [a [medium-range]{.mark} ballistic
missile]{.underline}, capable of traveling no more than a thousand
kilometers or so. That's what the Russian mission to the United Nations
Security Council said on Thursday, anyway.

All of this raises a disquieting thought: [Did the Russians miss the
launch?]{.underline} Maybe the Russians are just being stubborn, but is
it possible that **[[Russian]{.mark} [radars]{.mark} and warning
satellites are [so lousy,]{.mark} they]{.underline}** **[might [not
see]{.mark} a [No]{.mark}]{.underline}**rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rean **[[ICBM]{.mark} climbing to seven
times]{.underline}** the altitude of **[the International Space
Station]{.underline}**? And could [that [tech]{.mark}nology
[gap]{.mark}]{.underline} [[start]{.mark} an [accidental]{.mark} nuclear
[war]{.mark}]{.underline} [[between]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}?

Consider this. [[If No]{.underline}]{.mark}rth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea [[fired]{.mark} an
[ICBM]{.mark}]{.underline} at [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, the American military
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} attempt to [[shoot]{.mark} the
[missile]{.mark} [down]{.mark}]{.underline} [[using]{.underline}]{.mark}
the 36 [ground-based [interceptors]{.mark}]{.underline}
[located]{.underline} [at Fort Greely]{.underline}, roughly 100 miles
southeast of Fairbanks, Alaska. [The plan would]{.underline} be to [fire
several]{.underline}---four or five---[interceptors at each incoming
North Korean missile.]{.underline} [If we get lucky,]{.underline}
[one]{.underline} of [those interceptors strikes]{.underline} the
missile and destroys it. Here is a stray thought, though: **[What
happens to the others?]{.underline}**

[U.S. missile defenses use kinetic energy]{.underline}, not explosives,
[to destroy enemy missiles]{.underline}---the "kill vehicle" simply
slams into the target. The [kill vehicle carries no
explosives]{.underline}, which [means the [kill vehicles]{.mark}
[that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[don't hit the target]{.mark}]{.underline}
simply continue on their merry way, [re-entering the
atmosphere]{.underline} and, for the most part, burning up. [For
scenarios in which the Alaska]{.underline} site [shoots at a North
Korean missile]{.underline}, [the kill vehicles]{.underline}
[should]{.underline} mostly [[re-enter]{.mark}]{.underline} the
atmosphere [[over]{.mark} [Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

You might feel a twinge of unease, thinking about **[a large number of
[U.S. missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[streaking into Mother Russia,
[light]{.mark}ing [up]{.mark} [Moscow's]{.mark} [early warning]{.mark}
system]{.underline}** before burning up. The Russians would know we
aren't attacking them, right? I mean, they wouldn't do something crazy
like get out the Cheget, their version of the nuclear football used to
launch a nuclear retaliation, would they?

Well, they might. First of all, [they [might]{.mark}]{.underline} [[not
see]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[No]{.mark}rth]{.underline}
[[Ko]{.mark}rean [launch]{.mark}]{.underline} in the first place. **[In
2009, the Russians missed a North Korean space launch]{.underline}**.
[Russia's early warning network fell on hard times]{.underline} after
the collapse of the Soviet Union and was pretty spotty back then. After
the 2009 fiasco, Russia built a new radar that was supposed to provide
better coverage of North Korea. But if that radar is working so well,
how come **[Russia thinks the Hwasong-14 is a medium-range
missile?]{.underline}**

Moreover, [we can't assume]{.underline} that [Russia would
realize]{.underline} [the launch from Alaska was]{.underline} [a
[missile defense]{.mark} [interceptor]{.mark} rather than an
[ICBM]{.mark}]{.underline}. From Russia, [the
[trajectories]{.mark}]{.underline} might [[appear]{.mark} quite
[similar]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} **[especially if the radar
operator was under]{.underline}** a great deal of
**[stress]{.underline}** or pressure. [In 1995]{.underline}, for
instance, [the Russian military mistook]{.underline} [the launch of a
sounding rocket]{.underline} [from Norway for a launch of a
nuclear-armed Trident]{.underline} [missile]{.underline} from the sea
and alerted Boris Yeltsin. The Norwegian rocket was actually flying away
from the Russia, but it took several very tense minutes for the Russian
warning system to figure that out.

It doesn't matter how [Russia's early warning system]{.underline} ought
to work on paper, the reality of the Russian system in practice [has
been a lot less impressive]{.underline}.

[Nor can the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates simply [call up
the Russians.]{.underline} [The [timeline for]{.mark} a [missile
defense]{.mark} intercept [is]{.mark} so [tight]{.mark}---just a few
minutes]{.underline}---that the president probably won't even know about
an intercept until after it happens. After the 1995 incident, the United
States and Russia agreed to try to solve these kinds of problems by
establishing a "Joint Data Exchange Center" to make sure that both sides
had the same early warning data---like, "Hey, look, it's a North Korean
ICBM. We're going to shoot that." But Russia slowly strangled the JDEC
idea and it never went anywhere. A reporter described the abandoned site
in 2001 as "windows boarded up or cracked, its walls marked with
graffiti" and serving "mostly as a clandestine hangout for young beer
drinkers."

A small number of us pushed the Obama administration to make another
effort to revive JDEC. I recall sitting in a meeting at the Pentagon
where I asked a senior official how he planned to overcome the obstacles
that had stalled JDEC during the Bush administration. He assured me they
had the situation under control. They were going to establish a joint
data "fusion" center with Russia. This might shock you, but simply
changing the name didn't help.

Then there is the disturbing possibility that **[even if Russia realized
the launch was coming from Fort Greely, [Putin]{.mark} [might]{.mark}
still [think it was]{.mark} [a sneak attack.]{.mark}]{.underline}** When
he was secretary of defense, Robert Gates stated that the [Russians were
convinced]{.underline} that [the U.S. planned to secretly install
nuclear-armed missiles]{.underline} [in missile defense
silos]{.underline}, a remark that a senior Obama official later told me
he was shocked to hear in an unclassified setting.

### Iran Impact Extensions

#### Iran war escalates\-\--[extinction]{.underline}.

**Beres 17** -- Louis René Beres, Emeritus professor of international
law at Purdue University. 2-10-2017. \"The Fast Track to Armageddon.\"
US News & World Report.
https://www.usnews.com/opinion/world-report/articles/2017-02-10/donald-trump-iran-and-the-fast-track-to-nuclear-war-in-the-middle-east
// LR

When all pertinent factors are taken into account, U.S. President Donald
[Trump could sometime undertake more-or-less **selective** military
action against [Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In response, the Islamic
Republic]{.underline} -- then having absolutely no meaningful option to
launching at least certain forms of armed reprisal --
[would]{.underline} **[[target American]{.mark} military [forces]{.mark}
in the region]{.underline}** and/or carefully chosen Israeli targets.
Whatever its precise configuration of selected targets, Tehran\'s
retaliatory blow would be expressly designed so as not to elicit an
unacceptably massive (possibly even nuclear) counter-retaliation. With
particular regard to Israel, moreover, this sort of retaliation would
plausibly include, inter alia, a substantial reliance upon Iran\'s own
surrogate militia forces in Hezbollah. All such bewildering
[calculations]{.underline}, of course, [must assume **perfect
rationality**]{.underline} on all sides. [If]{.underline}, for example,
[the new American president should **cast all caution to the
winds**]{.underline} [with his own first strike]{.underline} (a strike
that would be defended by Washington, in law, as an allegedly legitimate
expression of international law-enforcement, or \"anticipatory
self-defense\"), [the Iranian response, whether **rational or
irrational**]{.underline}, [could expectedly be \"proportionate\" --
that is, **comparably massive**]{.underline}. [In that prospectively
escalatory case, any **contemplated [introduction of nuc]{.mark}**lear
weapon**[s into the]{.mark} ensuing
[conflagration]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[might not]{.mark} necessarily
[be dismissed]{.mark} out of hand.]{.underline} At that point, moreover,
[any such introduction would have to originate from [the
American]{.mark} and/[or Israeli side]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
indisputable inference is \"true by definition,\" \"simply\" because
Iran would not yet have become an operationally nuclear power. In such
circumstances, [Trump]{.underline}, especially in view of his favored
argumentum ad baculum stance in virtually all matters, [[might
decide]{.mark} up[on a so-called **\"mad dog\" strategy**]{.mark}
vis-a-vis Iran]{.underline}. Here, [the American president would display
a last-resort dependence upon a strategy [of **pretended
irrationality**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or what I have called in my own
latest books and monographs, the \"rationality of pretended
irrationality.\" Significantly, [any such residual reliance, while
intuitively sensible and apparently compelling, could]{.underline} still
**[backfire]{.underline}**, thereby [[opening up]{.mark} an
**\"Armageddon path\"**]{.underline} [to a now **[unstoppable
escalation.]{.mark}**]{.underline} If, on the other hand, Trump\'s
\"punishing\" or defensive initial strike against Iran were
conspicuously less than massive, a fully rational Iranian adversary
would likely ensure that its chosen reprisal was correspondingly
\"limited.\" But if Trump\'s consciously rational and calibrated attack
upon Iran were wittingly or unwittingly launched against an irrational
enemy leadership, [[the Iranian **response** could then be]{.mark}
**\"roaring missiles,\"** or an **[all-out
retal]{.mark}**iation.]{.underline} This presumably unanticipated
response, while non-nuclear, could be directed at some as yet
undeterminable combination of U.S. and Israeli targets. Cumulatively, it
could still inflict very substantial harms. For the moment, at least,
any Iranian missile reprisal against U.S. interests and personnel would
have to exclude the American homeland. This same limiting prediction,
however, cannot be made in reference to any considered Israeli targets.
On the contrary, [any reciprocal Iranian attack directed against Israel
would plausibly target that country\'s **military assets**]{.underline}
[and could also include a significant number of **\"soft\" civilian
populations**]{.underline} and corollary infrastructures. Even if it is
being played only by rational adversaries, the advancing strategic
\"game\" would demand that each contestant relentlessly strive for
\"escalation dominance.\" Ominously, it is [in the thoroughly
unpracticed internal dynamics of any such rivalry]{.underline} that the
serious prospect of [[a genuine]{.mark}ly **[\"Armageddon\"
scenario]{.mark}**]{.underline} [could]{.underline} sometime [be
realized. This]{.underline} intolerable [outcome could be
produced]{.underline} either [in unexpected increments]{.underline} of
escalation by any or all of the three dominant national players,
[or]{.underline} instead, [by any sudden quantum leap in
destructiveness]{.underline} undertaken by Iran, Israel and/or the
United States. The only thing that is wholly predictable in usefully
deciphering such complex dynamics is that they are all unpredictable.
For example, even under the best or optimum assumptions of enemy
rationality, [all pertinent decision-makers would have to concern
themselves [with **miscalculation**]{.mark}s,
**[error]{.mark}**s]{.underline} in information, **[[unauthorized
uses]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of strategic weapons]{.underline},
mechanical or computer **[[malfunctions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [poorly
recognized instances of **cyberdefense**]{.underline},
[**[cyber-war]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} even adversarial
**[[coups]{.mark} d\'etats]{.underline}**. In the final analysis,
informed citizens and participants in these hideously complicated games
of strategy will need to recall that [[it is]{.mark} mathematically
[meaningless to assign]{.mark} any [**comforting probabilities**
to]{.mark} unique events]{.underline}. Because [an authentic nuclear war
would represent]{.underline} precisely such [[an
event]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [[with **utterly unforeseen
intersections**]{.underline}]{.mark}, interactions and \"synergies,\"
[we can never predict with any reassuring degree of precision whether
such a conflict would actually be more or less probable]{.underline}.
Indeed, [should Trump ever proceed to strike Iran on the erroneously
nonspecific assumption]{.underline} that his generals have already \"got
everything covered,\" he ought then to be reminded of the classic
military warning of Carl von Clausewitz: Long before any military
planners could even envision a nuclear war, the great Prussian general
had cautioned about \"friction,\" or \"the difference between war on
paper, and war as it actually is.\" Where it would be minimized or
disregarded altogether by Trump, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} difference
[[could **propel the unsteady Middle East toward**]{.mark} **an
[irreversible Armageddon]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Despite the willingness of Iran\'s new President, Hassan Rouhani to make
all reasonable concessions to [[US]{.underline}]{.mark} demands, Israeli
pressure groups in Washington continue to demand [an [attack on
Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}. But such an attack [might [escalate into a
global nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}, with catastrophic consequences.
As we approach the 100th anniversary World War I, we should remember
that this colossal disaster escalated uncontrollably from what was
intended to be a minor conflict. [There is a danger that an attack on
Iran would escalate into a large-scale war in the Middle East, entirely
destabilizing a region that is already deep in problems. The unstable
government of [Pakistan might be overthrown]{.mark}, and the
revolutionary Pakistani government might enter the war on the side of
Iran]{.underline}, thus [[introducing nuclear weapons]{.mark} into the
conflict. [Russia and China]{.mark}]{.underline}, firm allies of Iran,
[might also be [drawn in]{.mark}]{.underline}to a general war in the
Middle East. Since much of the world\'s oil comes from the region, [such
a war would]{.underline} certainly [cause the price of oil to reach
unheard-of heights, with catastrophic effects on the global
economy]{.underline}. In the dangerous situation that could potentially
result from an attack on Iran, there is a risk that [[nuclear weapons
would be used]{.underline}]{.mark}, either [[intentionally, or
by]{.mark} accident or [miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. Recent
research has shown that [besides making large areas of the world
uninhabitable]{.underline} through long-lasting radioactive
contamination, [a [nuclear war would damage]{.mark} global
[agriculture]{.mark} to such a extent that a global famine]{.underline}
of previously unknown proportions [would result]{.underline}. Thus,
[nuclear war is [the ultimate ecological catastrophe]{.mark}. It could
[destroy human civilization and]{.mark} much of [the
biosphere]{.mark}.]{.underline} To risk such a war would be an
unforgivable offense against the lives and future of all the peoples of
the world, US citizens included.

## China Add On

### 2AC China Add On

**China conflict will happen now and it will escalate globally via the
Arctic -- early warning systems are crucial.**

**Inside the Air Force 25** \["Deepened China-Russia Cooperation
Increases Threats to U.S. Homeland," pg. Lexis, ALB\]

**[The likelihood of direct military conflict between the U.S. and its
top adversaries is growing, fueled by deepening strategic cooperation
between China, Russia, North Korea and Iran]{.underline}**, according to
the head of North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and U.S.
Northern Command (NORTHCOM).

[Air Force Gen. Gregory Guillot warned that these adversaries are
expanding their military capabilities and strengthening ties in ways
that directly threaten the U.S. homeland in Feb. 13 written testimony
prepared for the Senate Armed Services Committee]{.underline}. [He
described a broad coordinated effort among America\'s adversaries **that
could escalate a regional conflict into a global one.**]{.underline}

\"**[The likelihood of direct conflict between the United States and one
of its four principal adversaries is increasing]{.underline}**,\"
Guillot testified.

\"[Strategic cooperation among these adversaries has grown substantially
since the beginning of the Ukraine war, increasing the risk that war
with one adversary could quickly expand into war with an enemy
coalition]{.underline}.\"

[The testimony underscores how U.S. defense officials are recalibrating
their threat assessments to account for not just China\'s growing
military power but]{.underline} **[also the potential for coordinated
operations with Russia and North Korea.]{.underline}** The shift marks a
significant evolution in strategic concerns as adversaries that have
historically acted independently are now leveraging each other\'s
military assets and expertise to challenge the U.S. and its allies.

[One of the major developments highlighted by Guillot is the **closer
military collaboration between China and Russia**. In the summer of
2024, he said China deployed bomber aircraft to a Russian Arctic airbase
for the first time and conducted a joint bomber patrol over the Bering
Sea alongside Russian heavy bombers]{.underline}.

**[\"Such \'access transfer\' accelerates and extends China\'s ability
to threaten North America in the air domain and raises the specter of
coordinated military operations in the event of a strategic conflict,\"
Guillot testified.]{.underline}**

[The move represents a shift in China\'s military posture]{.underline},
he said. **[While Beijing has historically focused its military
modernization on regional conflicts, its expanded presence in the Arctic
and North Pacific suggests a broader strategic intent]{.underline}**.
**[If China gains routine access to Russian airbases and naval ports in
the Arctic, it could significantly shorten the time required to launch
strikes against North American targets]{.underline}**, according to the
four-star general.

While the Pentagon has long tracked China\'s nuclear modernization,
[Guillot\'s testimony pointed to an increasing threat from conventional
Chinese weapon systems that can strike U.S. territory]{.underline}. Over
the past year, [China has:]{.underline} \* [Deployed warships to the
Bering Sea]{.underline} for the fourth consecutive year, [operating
within cruise missile range of critical infrastructure in
Alaska]{.underline}. \* Expanded its fleet of Shang III-class
nuclear-powered guided-missile submarines (SSGNs) which in the coming
years could provide Beijing a clandestine land-attack capability against
the U.S. West Coast. \* Integrated air-refuellable H-6N bombers into
joint Sino-Russian bomber patrols extending China\'s ability to conduct
long-range strikes without needing forward bases. \* [Developed
conventionally armed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) which
could allow China to strike U.S. territory without crossing the nuclear
threshold.]{.underline}

#### U.S. China war causes draw-in and escalates quickly to nuclear war

**Ottenberg 24** \[Eve, "War with China Will Negate Peace with Russia,"
Counter Punch, pg. Ebsco, ALB\]

It\'s somewhat reassuring that Donald Trump vows to make peace between
Russia and Ukraine pronto, upon becoming president. But [it will all be
absolutely for naught if Washington then pivots to war with
Beijing]{.underline}, **[a war that will quickly become
nuclear]{.underline}**. [And not just because of an Atomic
Apocalypse]{.underline} - [if Trump thinks Russian troops won\'t flood
to China\'s aid, he is sorely mistaken. That\'s because Moscow and
Beijing have a de facto mutual aid military pact]{.underline}. Or is it
de jure? To judge from the presence as recently as July 19 of Chinese
soldiers in Belarus, where over the course of a week they executed
military maneuvers with Belorussian troops on the Polish border, the
answer may very well be that the current Washington regime\'s imbecilic
bellicosity toward both superpowers led Moscow and Beijing to sign an
ACTUAL mutual defense pact. So yes, [Russian soldiers will very likely
assist Chinese ones in the event of a U.S. war]{.underline} in East
Asia. And those Russians are some of the most battle-hardened troops on
the planet.

[The lousy idea of war with the five-thousand-year-old civilization,
cherished by the American right, stinks for a multitude of
reasons]{.underline}. Following the bleak, hypothetical scenario that
pentagon and also China expert David Goldman tweeted June 18, a Chinese
blockade of Taiwan would end the island\'s gas supplies in three weeks,
leaving it without power. Then \"the U.S. blockades Chinese trade via
the Strait of MalaccaChina blockades South Korea and Japan (which import
virtually all energy).\" Unlike those nations, China produces 80 percent
of its energy, and Russia can replace half its food imports by rail.

\"[Japan and South Korea shut down. China tightens its belt but keeps
functioning: World stock markets crash, etc]{.underline}[China can
conduct its blockade using nothing but missile launchers on the
mainland.\"]{.underline} [Since there\'s no way to disable these, \"1)
The U.S. sends F-18s to hit mainland targets and China destroys the
Okinawa and Guam airbases. 2) The U.S. sends carriers to attack China,
and China sinks them. 3) The U.S. fires missiles at China from the
Philippines, and Chinese missiles obliterate the Philippines. 4) We go
straight to a nuclear exchange. Meanwhile the world economy shrinks by
20 percent to 30 percent.\"]{.underline}

[That sound bad enough for you? Apparently not to rabid GOP
congressional China hawks]{.underline} and the likes of Elbridge Colby,
whom Trump is considering for a cabinet position. [These warmongers
actually flirt with policies that will cause this catastrophe, and
catastrophe it is, because **what Goldman omits is that Moscow and
Tehran would likely rush to aid their ally China and pile on - and with
Russia in the fight, it becomes incandescently nuclear, with cities in
the U.S., Russia, Europe and China incinerated**]{.underline}.

Though fanatics like erstwhile GOP representative Mike \"Sinophobic
Rampage\" Gallagher have left the House, plenty of maniacs remain, who
appear to think war with China is \"winnable\" and hunky dory, and
they\'re bolstered by Dr. Strangeloves in the pentagon. [This is a real
danger. Could Trump contain it? Unlikely. Could Joe Biden? Not to judge
from the dismal trajectory of Biden\'s pet Ukraine proxy war, a
trajectory on which western escalation has followed escalation like
night follows day. And with a Trump white house, the prospect darkens
considerably with the likes of Colby waiting - with all his ferocious
anti-China lunacy - in the wings]{.underline}.

Meanwhile rhetoric and actions heat up. On June 21, Beijing sanctioned
Lockheed Martin over another Taiwan arms sale. Congress is all for these
provocative sales to the island, in case you didn\'t know, and China has
made its anger known. \"The sanctions will target Lockheed Martin ceo
James Teclit, chief operating officer Frank St. John, chief financial
officer Jesse Malefe, and others,\" RT reported June 21, including
subsidiaries such as \"Lockheed Martin Missile Systems Integration
Laboratory, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technologies Laboratory and
Lockheed Martin Ventures.\" For those morons who poo-poohed these moves,
please remember that China is an economic behemoth, and an industrial
giant that controls many of the supply chains on which our insanely
over-priced defense industry depends. These arms sales to Taiwan are,
besides dangerous, profoundly stupid.

The sale that caused the latest sanctions is worth \$360 million and
includes hundreds of armed drones and missiles. It follows China\'s May
sanctions \"on 12 American defense contractors, including subsidiaries
of Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, as well as ten executives.\" This was
Beijing\'s counterattack to Washington arming Taiwan. Lots of tit for
tat here. Remember, \"the U.S. Treasury had previously slapped
restrictive measures on more than a dozen Chinese entities for allegedly
supplying military-related goods to Russia.\" Incidentally, American
weapons sales to Taiwan scored another grotesque casualty, as Beijing
ended nuclear non-proliferation talks with Washington July 17. Why?
Because of U.S. arms inundating Taiwan

But here and there hope glimmers on a dark horizon, though only faintly
and at a great distance. Back on October 15, Goldman published an
opinion piece in Newsweek, headlined, \"China Isn\'t Going To War
Because It Doesn\'t Have To,\" in which he argued that the prospect of
combat between Beijing and the west over Taiwan is \"a scam, a goof, a
Muppet show, whose point is to cover up the incompetence and corruption
which led the Pentagon to spend trillions on obsolete weapons. We lost
the South China sea years agoand we know it. We just can\'t admit it.\"

[Goldman notes that the U.S. defense department recognized since at
least 2012 \"that Chinese surface-to-surface (STS) missiles can destroy
U.S. aircraft carriers, or any other military asset that isn\'t
submerged]{.underline}.\" According to Goldman, there will be no war
between Beijing and Washington, and China will simply wait to absorb
Taiwan peacefully, as was always the plan. Also, complicating
Washington\'s insane pow wows over war with China is Taiwan\'s
reluctance to shoulder the military burden, despite Beltway cajoling,
and its alarm that acceding to China-hawk fanaticism could crater the
island\'s economy and population, leaving it like Ukraine, i.e.
destroyed. Kiev is a byword among nations. No one in their right mind
wants to end up like Ukraine.

This is welcome news, but it doesn\'t make the more recent
saber-rattling any less unnerving. On July 15, RT reported that another
round of Russian-Chinese joint naval maneuvers kicked off in the
Pacific, near the city of Zhanjiang. Beijing\'s defense ministry
announced that \"the fourth joint maritime patrol in the western and
northern Pacific Ocean did not target a third party and had nothing to
do with the current international and regional situation.\"

[There have also been joint naval maneuvers with Russia, China and Iran
over the past year. And don\'t forget the Kremlin\'s shiny new defense
pact with North Korea. Suffice it to say that in three short years, team
Biden succeeded in creating a Eurasian Gargantua, united in its
opposition to western aggression. There is no turning back the clock.
This eastern alliance is here to stay. And as military experts like Will
Schryver have observed, the U.S. and NATO would fare poorly against
it]{.underline}.

Why? Well, for starters, [Russia and China are industrial giants who
avoided the hubristic mistake of privatizing their defense industries
and who have beefed their weapons production up to altitudes the west
simply can\'t reach. Washington and NATO could not long withstand this
new alliance, and that\'s **before things go nuclear**.]{.underline}
**[Then, once it does, it\'s curtains for the west, and the
east.]{.underline}** [Moscow has more nukes that Washington, as well as
technology the west lacks, like hypersonic missiles. China and Iran now
have \'em too. And that\'s before you even consider the problem of air
defense]{.underline}. [The continental United States doesn\'t have
it.]{.underline} (Russia has the best in the world.) [So we\'re
defenseless when it comes to missile attacks and under-equipped, and the
geniuses in the white house forged us a frighteningly powerful enemy.
Good going, American war party. You really shot the west in the head
with your latest idiocies. Peace talks anyone?]{.underline}

### China Impact Extensions

#### The crisis escalates into full blown war

ALB\]

[In 2021, at the contentious first meeting between senior Chinese
foreign policy officials and their counterparts in the Biden
administration, Beijing's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, declared that the
United States could no longer "speak with China from a position of
strength]{.underline}." The statement, which seemed to unsettle U.S.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken and U.S. National Security Adviser
Jake Sullivan, has proved instructive for understanding China's
strategic outlook. In the four years since, [Beijing has operated under
the assumption that a profound shift in the balance of power between the
two countries is underway. Chinese strategists perceive their country's
decades-long "strategic weakness" in its competition with the United
States as coming to an end,]{.underline} driven by steady advances in
China's industrial, technological, and military capabilities and an
increase in its international influence. This progress has ushered in
what Beijing views as a "strategic stalemate" with the United States, in
which both nations now wield comparable power.

The reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump did little to shake
Beijing's optimism that it can navigate continued threats from the
United States, secure a lasting equilibrium, and vie for global
supremacy. And Trump's early second-term actions have strengthened
Beijing's conviction that the United States is accelerating its own
decline, bringing a new era of parity ever closer. The perception that
China likely does not face an existential threat from the United States
has had a stabilizing effect on policy in Beijing, which has responded
to Trump's escalation of trade tensions in April with patience,
anticipating that Trump will eventually lower U.S. tariffs in an attempt
to reach an agreement.

But despite the low immediate risk of conflict between the United States
and China, [the current stalemate may not prove durable]{.underline}.
**[Over the next four years, the risk of a military crisis will likely
rise as the two countries increasingly test each other's
resolve]{.underline}**. By the time Trump's current term nears its
conclusion, China will have had ample opportunity to reevaluate the
United States' domestic political environment, its commitment to Taiwan,
the global economy's dependence on the island's semiconductor industry,
and the trajectory of China's own economic development and military
modernization. **[The risk of a U.S.-Chinese military crisis could
sharply escalate]{.underline}** if Beijing further closes the capability
gap with Washington and perceives international indifference to Taiwan's
status, grows frustrated with nonmilitary efforts to unite Taiwan with
China, and foresees more pro-Taiwan leadership in Washington and Taipei.
[What appears today as strategic stalemate could rapidly transform into
something more volatile---and dangerous---for both
countries.]{.underline}

BEAT THE DEALER

Beijing has been willing to bide its time as Trump unilaterally weakens
the United States' standing in the world. Despite the Trump
administration's aggressive tariffs on China, many Chinese strategists
have downplayed the frequently voiced international concern that the
trade war raises the risk of military conflict. In their eyes,
heightened trade tensions are simply the first phase of Trump's
signature negotiating tactic: squeeze hard, then back down and cut a
deal. China, it appears, is content to let Trump's trademark strategy
run its course, expecting it to falter as the United States faces severe
economic and diplomatic consequences.

Beijing has shown similarly little inclination to initiate near-term
military conflict, even over issues of core national interest such as
Taiwan. [This restraint, however, has been underwritten by a military
buildup, spanning conventional and nuclear forces]{.underline}, that
Chinese officials see as critical to shifting the balance of power with
the United States. Trump's fixation on "holding the cards" in
international disputes only reinforces Beijing's conviction that hard
power rules. And Beijing believes it is in position to gain the upper
hand.

Despite Trump's stated interest in arms control talks with China and
Russia, officials in Beijing see the White House's erratic, disjointed
decision-making as an impediment to any potential grand bargain. They
feel less inclined to pursue cooperative security measures and are
prioritizing the development of China's own military capabilities. As
the United States' global authority fades rapidly, international
pressure on China to join arms control talks will diminish. Moreover,
[Beijing sees the U.S. defense industrial base as faltering, hampered by
an increasingly disordered governance system]{.underline}. Trump's
posturing, including his commitment to maintaining the world's most
powerful military and his proposal to build a "Golden Dome" missile
defense system, no longer rattles Beijing as it once did. As the United
States diverts resources toward fanciful efforts to defend its homeland
against China's comparatively low-cost attack capabilities, Beijing
effectively strains U.S. resources at little cost to itself.

[China's military buildup and its assessment of the United States'
stagnation has also emboldened Beijing to act more assertively to shape
the behavior of smaller countries in the region. As Washington's
capacity and credibility erode]{.underline}, China is openly courting
U.S. allies such as Australia, Japan, and South Korea while drawing
firmer redlines around its core interests. Its seemingly contradictory
surges in economic and diplomatic outreach and its military muscle
flexing, evident in high-profile drills near Australia and Japan in
February, are, in China's view, actions characteristic of the great
power it believes it has become.

PLAYING FOR THE STRAIT

Chief among those interests is Taiwan. Despite rising political and
military tensions across the strait since Taiwanese President Lai
Ching-te took office in 2024, China's Taiwan Work Conference in February
and the convening of the Chinese Communist Party's "Two Sessions"
conferences in March revealed more continuity than change in Beijing's
near-term Taiwan strategy, which combines patience with the methodical,
systematic expansion of control over cross-strait relations. This
indicates no significant elevation in the threat of an attack in the
near term.

Although the Chinese Communist Party's recent meetings have not
suggested that a Chinese military move against the island is imminent,
the risk of a conflict in the medium term is growing. In recent years,
Beijing's strategy has evolved from primarily preventing Taiwanese
independence to actively pursuing unification, culminating in the CCP's
2021 plan, "Overall Strategy for Resolving the Taiwan Question in the
New Era." Details are limited, but the new approach seems to emphasize
the boosting of China's influence within Taiwanese society, nudging
Taiwanese to see unification as their least bad option. According to
authorities in Taiwan, Beijing has been collaborating with Taiwanese
civil-society organizations, political parties, and influencers to
undercut Taipei's narratives, handing out Chinese ID cards to Taiwanese
citizens, and even securing loyalty pledges from Taiwanese military
officers. China may see such measures as legitimate, whereas Taiwan's
countermeasures, such as Lai's 17-point plan to combat such
infiltration, appear to Beijing as acts of pro-independence defiance
that have required China to intensify its air and sea incursions and
carry out bigger, bolder military drills. Beijing, which has largely
turned its back on Lai's administration, has little hope that a
pro-Chinese leader will win Taiwan's 2028 presidential election,
increasing the likelihood of escalation with Taipei. Ultimately, even
nonmilitary unification measures regarded by Beijing as peaceful carry a
risk of military escalation to all-out conflict, one that could draw in
the United States.

T. His reluctance to engage in conflicts with a great power, lack of
interest in defending other democracies, and shaky commitment to Taiwan
loom lar[rump's lack of clear foreign policy priorities amplifies this
risk]{.underline}ge to Chinese officials. Many in Beijing suspect that
if any U.S. president might quietly tolerate China's coercive takeover
of Taiwan, it would be Trump. China's early April military exercises in
the strait served in part as a probe of his resolve. The Trump
administration's verbal condemnations in response did not impress
Beijing, with Chinese analysts highlighting the relatively muted nature
of the U.S. response.

[Other restraining forces are also rapidly weakening. As the United
States engages in naked coercion of allies and adversaries alike,
smaller states in the region and beyond face new dilemmas. They have
fewer incentives to antagonize China, especially as it positions itself
as a comparatively more predictable and less disruptive global power
that consistently outpaces the United States in economic and military
growth]{.underline}. As the U.S.-led Western bloc fragments, the
international will and capacity to pressure China toward restraint in
Taiwan may wane in a more multipolar world.

AUDIENCE CAPTURE?

[For its part, the Trump administration is beefing up the United States'
military deterrent against China amid growing concerns about Beijing's
aggressive actions in Asia. But internal fissures have impeded the
effort]{.underline}. Erratic, disruptive overhauls in the Pentagon and
broader bureaucracy, driven by administration loyalists eager to carry
out the president's agenda, have made Beijing doubt the United States'
ability to bolster its military capabilities. Senior Defense Department
officials aren't fully aligned on the importance of Taiwan to U.S.
strategy. Elbridge Colby, the Pentagon's policy chief, for example, has
said that "Americans could survive without it" and is pushing instead to
thwart China's broader regional dominance. Trump's own wavering
commitment to Taiwan further risks rendering any military preparations
hollow. His recent dismissal of National Security Council senior
officials insufficiently committed to his "America first" foreign policy
sounded a warning shot to like-minded peers across the administration.

Meanwhile, the ratcheting up of tensions sparked by the trade war has
strengthened national cohesion within China. Even the country's most
liberal-leaning strategists, previously less critical of U.S. policy,
now label Washington the aggressor and advocate for tougher measures to
counter U.S. economic and foreign policy pressure. To many, Chinese
President Xi Jinping's forecast of "great changes unseen in a century"
appears prescient. This growing internal consensus, however, makes
Beijing less likely to engage in the critical self-reflection necessary
to dispassionately evaluate its own strategic planning---and more likely
to intensify its military buildup and pursuit of unification.

Likewise, Trump's demand for loyalty and his expansive use of executive
power to enforce compliance and conformity across the government have
eroded the administration's ability to self-evaluate. And without
dissenting voices within the administration, the United States cannot
plan and develop effective military deterrence and responsibly manage
future military crises.

Ultimately, these internal dynamics---more than long-standing trade and
foreign policy disputes---pose the greatest threat of turning strategic
stalemate into acute crisis. **[To reduce the risks of catastrophic
conflict, strategists in Beijing and Washington should look
inward]{.underline}** and scrutinize their own leadership before the
uneasy stalemate can no longer hold.

#### War with China will draw in other regions---it's an existential threat

**Kerg 24** \[Brian- Lieutenant Colonel Brian Kerg is a nonresident

But **[[wars between great powers are rarely short and
sharp]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[They are]{.underline}]{.mark} more often
[[long, grueling slogs of attrition]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to [[expand horizontally, ensnaring
other regions]{.underline}]{.mark} in their wake. Of course, it is
possible that [[a US-China conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} over Taiwan
could be an exception, that it could be brief and limited instead of
protracted and wide-spread, [[but it's irresponsible to assume such an
outcome given history]{.underline}]{.mark}. For the French and the
British, the American Revolutionary War was but a single theater of war
in what was then the latest episode of an enduring conflict that spanned
the globe. [At the outset of World War I, popular opinion in
Britain]{.underline}, among other belligerents, [held that the war would
be "over by Christmas]{.underline}," only for that nation and the world
to endure four long years of slaughter. [Imperial Japan launched its
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor]{.underline} [based on the assessment
that it would convince the United States to cede to Japan its interests
in the Pacific. Instead, Japan found itself fighting for
years]{.underline} on the strategic defensive, [until the atomic
bombing]{.underline} of Hiroshima and Nagasaki [forced Japan's
unconditional surrender.]{.underline} Examples abound, but the
[historical record repeats this simple but critical theme: Great powers
rarely settle military conflicts with other great powers in a neat, tidy
fashion]{.underline}. Yet despite career requirements to attend
professional schools where military history is at the heart of the
curriculum, military planners continue to chase the unicorns of decisive
battles and short wars. Cathal Nolan documents this phenomenon, and
reveals its hollowness, in his masterful The Allure of Battle. But if
one were to write [the novel that more precisely
illustrates]{.underline} [the]{.underline} long, [global grind that a
war between the United States and China would entail]{.underline}, it
might appear something like this: The opening pages showcase the trends
of modern war games and novels, where [naval combatants,
fifth-generation aircraft, missile forces, and non-kinetic effects wreak
havoc in the war's opening days]{.underline}, crippling the air and
naval power of the belligerents. [[Thousands upon thousands are killed
in this first stage of the conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark} But [[**the
war expands horizontally**, with China, Russia, and North Korea aligned
against the United States,]{.underline}]{.mark} Taiwan, [[Japan, the
Philippines, Australia, South Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}, and others.
[[Fighting occurs in multiple theaters]{.underline}]{.mark} within
United States Indo-Pacific Command and beyond, [[including **a massive
conflagration on the Korean peninsula**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Soon, the
ability to hurl precision munitions back and forth culminates as
expenditure rapidly outpaces production capacity and as US fuel stocks
in the Pacific dwindle. [[With pressure increasing and options
decreasing, tactical **nuclear weapons are employed** on the
battlefield]{.underline}]{.mark} . . . and yet the war drives on. Thus
would end the first chapter. The reader turns the page, which says:
"Three years later." And with some skillfully placed exposition, the
author reveals [the massive changes that have occurred across society as
belligerents commit to a long, bloody war]{.underline}. [[Nations have
fully mobilized their economies to support]{.mark} what is now **[an
existential war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Drafts and conscription
are]{.underline}]{.mark} made [[mandatory]{.underline}]{.mark} to fill
and maintain the ranks of multiple field armies, amphibious corps,
fleets, and air forces. [**[The war is not
limited]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the first island chain, [**[but has
multiple theaters]{.mark}** that span the globe]{.underline} and
escalates horizontally, with simultaneous conflicts drawing in
additional belligerents. [[Emergency powers are universally
invoked]{.mark} by executive branches, curtailing liberties]{.underline}
in even the historically freest societies**[. [The threat of nuclear
holocaust is ever-present]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and [[continuous
fighting through tactical nuclear exchanges shatters previous
conceptions of escalation management]{.underline}]{.mark}. While [[these
are logical conclusions should a US-China war
occur]{.underline}]{.mark}, they usually take a backseat in policy
analysis, strategic thinking, and operational planning, eclipsed again
and again by a hyperfocus on a limited conflict in and around Taiwan.
Committing the preponderance of security studies to the first phases of
a global war of attrition is short-sighted, like a chess player who
studies openings but fails to study the mid-game or its closing. None of
this is easy, of course. [[Large-scale war disrupts societies and
technology in profound and]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[unexpected
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}. But because of this feature and not in spite
of it, US policymakers and military leaders must rigorously study and
plan for a broad range of implications of a years-long war with China.

[Key adaptation strategies include]{.underline}:

Relocating vulnerable communities: As sea levels rise and permafrost
thaws, some Arctic communities may need to relocate to safer areas. This
requires not only physical infrastructure but also policies that respect
the rights and cultural heritage of indigenous peoples.

[Strengthening infrastructure: Building more resilient infrastructure
that can withstand the changing climate is vital. This includes
reinforcing coastal defenses]{.underline}, developing more durable
buildings in areas with melting permafrost, and upgrading transportation
systems to handle the new environmental conditions.

[Alarming narratives that have an]{.underline} **[aura of

**[effective]{.underline}** tools [for shaping]{.underline} **[public
opinion]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} public [**policies**.
When]{.underline} such narratives are **[false]{.underline}** or
seriously misleading, [they can do]{.underline} **[significant
damage]{.underline}** because of unintended consequences of their policy
prescriptions. For example, an alarming narrative -- rooted in a false,
but plausible-sounding, analogy between the risks of nuclear power
plants and nuclear bombs -- turned public opinion against nuclear power
and thereby induced much greater use of coal over the last 50 or so
years (Shellenberger (2020, chapter 8)). The substitution of coal for
nuclear power shortened millions of lives (due to greater air pollution)
and led to higher CO2 emissions than would have otherwise occurred.

These unintended consequences of the anti-nuclear-power narrative should
make us think carefully before the U.S. goes too far down the energy
path prescribed by the Apocalyptic climate narrative.

[The]{.underline} **[[Apocalyptic climate]{.mark}
narrative]{.underline}** [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[deeply
flawed]{.underline}]{.mark}** guide for public policies because it:

• focuses on the risks/costs of global warming and ignores any benefits
from warming and the myriad benefits to humanity from fossil-fuel use.

• advocates aggressive near-term suppression of fossil-fuel use without
considering the huge costs that such suppression would inflict on
humans.

• lacks a realistic sense of proportion about the risks/costs from
continued global warming, which are manageable, not existential.

This paper details the flaws in the Apocalyptic climate narrative,
including why the threat from humancaused climate change is not dire and
why urgent suppression of fossil-fuel use would be unwise. We argue that
sensible public policies would focus instead on developing a diversified
portfolio of energy sources to support greater resilience and
flexibility to respond to whatever weather and climate extremes that
might occur. We identify nine principles for sensible U.S. public
policies toward energy and discuss implications of the flaws in the
narrative for investors and their agents.

**[variability]{.underline}** -- a difficulty that adds to the
uncertainty in estimates of how much human-caused warming to expect over
the 21st century.

Warming over the past 120 years

[The question of whether]{.underline} global [warming is]{.underline}
**[dangerous]{.underline}** (**[whatever]{.underline}** [its
cause]{.underline}) [can be addressed by examining the]{.underline}
**[behavior]{.underline}** [of the climate]{.underline}
[[since]{.underline}]{.mark} **[before]{.underline}** the time **[human
activity]{.underline}** [generated large]{.underline} amounts of
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse **[g]{.underline}**as
[emissions. Human-caused global warming is typically measured with
reference to [pre-industrial times]{.mark}]{.underline}; for practical
reasons in terms of the availability of data, the usual approach employs
a baseline period in the late 19th century. Since the late 19th century,
Earth's average temperature has increased by about 1.3o C (2.3o F).
[During the **same period**]{.underline}, average global sea level has
risen 8-9 inches, and [[there has been]{.underline}]{.mark} little or
**[[no]{.mark} detectable [change]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} most types of **[[extreme
weather]{.underline}]{.mark}** events when [measured against
the]{.underline} **[background]{.underline}** of natural weather and
climate variability.

Since the late 19th century, with 1.3o C of global warming, [humanity
has seen]{.underline} **[unprecedented increases]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} **[prosperity]{.underline}** and well-being. Global
population has increased from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to 8.2 billion
people in 2024. In 1900, the global average lifespan was 34 years; in
2024 the global average lifespan more than doubled to 73 years. From
1961 to 2020, global agricultural output nearly quadrupled, with a 53%
increase in per capita output despite a 2.6-fold increase in global
population.

Since the early 1900s, [[per capita]{.underline}
**[mortality]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from]{.underline}
**[hurricanes]{.underline}**, **[floods]{.underline}**,
**[droughts]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
wild**[fires]{.underline}** has **[[decreased]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by
almost]{.underline} **[[98%]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Koonin (2021, page
170)). [These]{.underline} favorable **[[trends]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in weather- and climate-related mortality rates [[reveal]{.mark} that
[the world is]{.mark} now]{.underline} **[much
[better]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[at]{.underline} **[preventing
deaths]{.underline}** [from]{.underline}]{.mark} extreme weather and
**[[climate]{.mark} events]{.underline}** than it was a century ago.
[The sharp reduction in]{.underline} **[death]{.underline}** rates [has
been]{.underline} **[accomplished]{.underline}**
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} **[greater [wealth]{.mark}]{.underline}**
([driven by]{.underline} **[energy]{.underline}** derived
[[from]{.underline} **[fossil fuels]{.underline}**]{.mark}), [which
provides better infrastructure, superior advance-warning technologies,
and greater capacity to recover from weather-related
disasters.]{.underline}

Although the role of higher temperatures and atmospheric CO2
concentrations in these favorable changes in mortality rates is open to
debate, two aspects of the increases are unambiguously beneficial.
First, [**[sat]{.mark}**ellite observation**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}
since the 1980s [[indicate]{.underline}]{.mark} **[widespread
[greening]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of the planet. The satellite data show
that, over the last two decades, Earth has **increased**]{.underline}
[its]{.underline} **[green leaf area]{.underline}** [by
approximately]{.underline} **[5%]{.underline}**. [[This]{.mark} greening
[reflects]{.mark}]{.underline} [**increased [CO2
fertilization]{.mark}**, warmer]{.underline} [**temperatures**,
and]{.underline} **[more rainfall]{.underline}** (Chen et al. (2024)).

The second aspect relates to heat and cold extremes. An unambiguous
consequence of global warming is more frequent heat extremes, coupled
with less frequent cold extremes. It is well known that mortality is
substantially greater (almost a factor of 10) for extreme cold than for
extreme heat (Zhao et al. (2021). Consequently, [[rising
**temp**]{.mark}erature[**s** are associated with]{.mark} a **[net

mortality** from]{.underline} extreme [**cold events**.

Prospective warming over the 21st century

[What about]{.underline} warming over [the]{.underline}
**[rest]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} 21st
**[century?]{.underline}** [Is there reason to expect **dire
consequences for humanity** going forward in time**?**]{.underline}

[The Apocalyptic climate narrative and the most extreme impacts are
driven by]{.underline} **[extreme emissions scenarios]{.underline}**,
with 4-5o C of warming by 2100 (above a baseline in the late 19th
century). [However]{.underline}, since 2021, [[the **UN**]{.mark}'s
climate **negotiators**]{.underline} [have]{.underline} **[[abandoned
extreme]{.underline}]{.mark}** emissions [**[scenarios]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline} **[unrealistic]{.underline}**]{.mark} for two reasons.
First, [they make]{.underline} **[unrealistic
assumptions]{.underline}**, especially [about]{.underline}
**[coal]{.underline}** use. Second, [**[actual]{.underline}**
[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} [have been
[tracking]{.mark}]{.underline} **[well [below]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[their most extreme]{.underline} emission [scenario, and
indeed]{.underline} slightly [below their]{.underline}
**[medium]{.underline}** emissions [scenario]{.underline}. The UN is now
working with an estimated year 2100 warming of 2.5°C (UNFCCC (2022)),
while the IEA Roadmap to NetZero projects 2.4°C of warming by 2100 (IEA
(2023)). [When]{.underline} **[plausible scenarios]{.underline}** of
natural climate variability and values of climate sensitivity on the
lower end of the UN's IPCC likely range [are considered]{.underline},
the [expected]{.underline} **[warming]{.underline}** [could
be]{.underline} **[significantly lower]{.underline}** (Lee et al.
(2021)).

If we work with 2.5°C projected warming by 2100, more than half (1.3°C)
of the predicted increase in temperature has already occurred. There are
good reasons to expect continued advances in prosperity and well-being
over the remainder of the 21st century -- and ample reasons such as AI
to expect such advances to accelerate. Moreover, [[the]{.mark} so-called
**[threshold]{.mark}**]{.underline} of danger [of]{.underline}
**[2]{.underline}**o **[C]{.underline}** warming since pre-industrial
times [[is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}**]{.mark} [an]{.underline}
**[[objective]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}** of danger.
[[Rather]{.underline}]{.mark}, 2o C is a **[[political]{.mark}ly
negotiated target]{.underline}** [designed [to
**motivate**]{.mark}]{.underline} broadbased
**[[action]{.underline}]{.mark}**s to reduce emissions (Curry (2023,
page 9)).

Importantly, [[there is]{.underline} **[no credible case]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} **[missing]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
2o C [target would [pose]{.mark} an]{.underline} **[[ex]{.mark}istential
[risk]{.mark}]{.underline}** to humanity. [[Humans have]{.underline}
**[adapted]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to]{.underline}**
[(and]{.underline} **[thrived]{.underline}** [in)]{.underline} climates
[extremes]{.underline} **[far worse]{.underline}** [than]{.underline} in
[the **pessimistic extreme scenario**, [as]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[summertime residents of [Phoenix]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[wintertime residents of Minneapolis]{.underline}**
[[demonstrate]{.underline} **[every year]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Two other risk-related points are relevant here. First, a basic
assumption in the socioeconomic scenarios used in formulating the UN
climate-assessment reports is that vulnerability to weather and climate
extremes decreases with greater wealth and economic development, as
adaptive capacity increases. All of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
(SSPs) scenarios constructed for the most recent UN climate assessment
entail dramatic growth, with global GDP in 2100 between four and ten
times larger than in 2010 (Dellink et al. (2017)). These scenarios do
not imply any futures for humanity that are worse than today.

Second, risks from human-caused global warming are difficult to separate
credibly from natural weather and climate variability and the risks are
dominated by the vulnerabilities of less-developed countries and poorer
populations generally. Increasing wealth and productivity will continue
to reduce humanity's vulnerability to weather- and climate-related
risks.

Tipping points and surprises

**[Uncertainty]{.underline}** about the impact on humans of continued
use of fossil fuels [is]{.underline} **[dominated]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} the difficulties of estimating the likelihood of
catastrophic outcomes from climate **[tipping points]{.underline}** that
could cause severe and possibly irreversible damage.

Climate tipping points are defined as abrupt or nonlinear transitions to
a different climate state, which are hypothesized to occur once some
threshold has been crossed, with regional or global consequences that
are largely uncontrollable and beyond our management. In other words,
tipping points are points of no return, at least on the century
timescale. In recent geologic history, abrupt climate change has been
caused by changes in ocean circulation patterns and ice-sheet dynamics,
including (i) the Younger Dryas (12,900- 11,700 years ago) when global
temperatures dropped by up to 15o C in some regions, (ii) an unnamed
sudden cooling event that occurred around 8,200 years ago and that
lasted about 150 years, and (iii) the DansgaardOeschger Events
(115,000-11,500 years ago) with a series of abrupt warmings and cooling
during the last Ice Age with temperature shifts of 5-10o C occurring
within decades.

The IPCC Assessment Reports have considered a number of potential
tipping points associated with global warming, including ice-sheet
collapse, collapse of the Atlantic Overturning Circulation, carbon
release from permafrost thawing, and destruction of the Amazon
rainforest and coral reefs. There are some preliminary climate model
simulations for some of these conjectured tipping points. However,
climate models do not include the appropriate physical, chemical, and
biological processes to adequately simulate such events. Hence, these
hypothesized climate tipping points have been based largely upon the
consideration of imperfect analogues from the geologic past, process
models, and physically based storylines.

[The]{.underline} [**[likelihood]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
any of the above types of [hypothesized **[tipping points]{.mark}**
occurring in the]{.underline} 21st **[century]{.underline}**
[under]{.underline} the **[medium emissions]{.underline}** scenario
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[generally regarded]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline} **[[low]{.underline}]{.mark}**, although there is also
low confidence in any conclusions surrounding possible tipping points
owing to deep (Knightian) uncertainties in our understanding of the
complex climate system.

Could something genuinely catastrophic happen to the climate on the
timescale of the 21st century? Yes, although continued use of fossil
fuels is not the only possible cause. For example, a climate catastrophe
could also be caused by nuclear war, a series of explosive volcanic
eruptions, natural shifts in ocean circulation patterns, and/or shifts
in ice-sheet dynamics driven by geologic processes.

[It is impossible to remove]{.underline} **[all]{.underline}** sources
of [climate]{.underline}-related [risk, and it would be]{.underline}
**[unwise]{.underline}** [to attempt to try [to
avert]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[low probability]{.underline}**]{.mark}
climate **[[catastrophes]{.underline}]{.mark}** [with policy actions
that [would]{.mark}]{.underline} themselves surely [[impose]{.underline}
**[massive]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[near-term
[costs]{.mark}]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}
**[humanity]{.underline}**. There is no doubt that aggressive near-term
suppression of fossil-fuel use would impose significant costs on humans
until such time as viable replacements for fossil fuels were found for
the roles they play in the production of food, steel, cement, and
plastics.

The critical implication: In terms of rational risk management, there is
no case for policies that would suppress fossil-fuel use aggressively
simply because something bad might happen. For such suppression to be
rational, we should have good reason to think that the low probability
climate catastrophe we would avoid would be far worse than the
catastrophe we would surely induce by moving aggressively to net zero.
We have yet to see anyone provide credible support for the latter
argument.

3\. Fossil-fuel suppression: Shooting ourselves in the foot The
Apocalyptic climate narrative incorrectly portrays CO2 emissions as
inherently and unequivocally dangerous and an economic "bad" i.e., a
purely negative externality. This portrayal ignores the fact that CO2
yields direct benefits (e.g., it is plant food) and the inarguable
technological reality that fossil fuels are currently irreplaceable
inputs for producing food (via ammonia-based fertilizer), steel, cement,
and plastics (Smil (2022, chapter 3), Gates (2022, chapter 3)), which
are central features of modern life. The last 150 years have seen an
enormous increase in human welfare that occurred to a large degree
because of the use of fossil fuels for electricity, transportation,
agriculture, and the material inputs for manufacturing and
infrastructure construction. Fossil fuels have enabled huge advances in
medicine, food production, communications, computing, ground and air
travel, and much more. They have enabled billions of people to have
lives of much higher quality, longer length, and generally greater
material abundance than our ancestors -- most of whom lived on the
Malthusian margin of survival. The 2015 Paris climate agreement set a
goal of "net-zero" global emissions (a balance between greenhousegas
emissions and offsetting emission removals) by 2050, which as a
practical matter targets a drastic reduction in fossil-fuel use over the
next 25 years. By 2024, 107 countries had adopted net-zero pledges. The
U.S. entered the agreement under President Obama, exited under President
Trump, re-entered under President Biden, and is in the process of
exiting again under President Trump's second administration. The problem
with the Paris agreement is its urgent timeline for abandoning fossil
fuels before we have viable replacements for the energy they provide and
the myriad other roles they play in creating products that benefit
humanity. As Vaclav Smil (2020) bluntly put it: Designing hypothetical
roadmaps outlining complete elimination of fossil carbon from the global
energy supply by 2050 is nothing but an exercise in wishful thinking
that ignores fundamental physical realities. Failure of net-zero
policies After the Paris agreement, atmospheric CO2 concentrations
increased 5.0% from 401 ppm in 2015 to 421 ppm in 2023. Global emissions
from burning fossil fuels increased 6.6% from 34.7 billion metric tons
in 2015 to 37 billion metric tons in 2023. Today, the world is far from
reaching the net-zero emissions target and the post-Paris emissions
trend is away from target. In recent years, the world has spent enormous
amounts on clean energy in the hope of curtailing fossil-fuel use. In
every year since 2015, outlays on clean energy have been \$1 trillion or
more, with outlays for 2024 on track to reach \$2 trillion (IEA (2024)).
These efforts have succeeded in slightly lowering the percent of global
energy from fossil fuels, but they have done so by expanding other
sources of energy -- notably solar and wind -- and not by reducing
fossil-fuel use. Today, the world gets 81% of its energy from fossil
fuels, down slightly from 82.8% in 2010 and 81.2% in 2000. In absolute
terms, global use of oil, natural gas, and coal have all increased.
Although a decade of government subsidies of electric vehicles has led
to less oil usage than would otherwise have occurred, absolute
consumption of gasoline is now at a record high. In public discourse,
capitalism and democracy are sometimes unfairly blamed for increasing
emissions and the failure of net-zero policies. China has strong
elements of a government-planned rather than capitalist economy and no
reasonable observer would mistake it for a democracy. Yet China is the
world's largest greenhouse-gas emitter. Fossil-fuel firms are also
portrayed as the root cause of global warming. If humans did not desire
the products made with fossil fuels, there would be no firms producing
such products. Consumption demand by individual human beings is the root
cause of fossil-fuel use and greenhouse-gas emissions. Net-zero policies
are failing because they do not deal with this fundamental reality. A
variety of underlying economic and political considerations have played
roles in the failure of the netzero policies embraced by many of the
world's governments. Most obviously, government subsidies have induced a
greater supply of solar- and wind-generated energy, but a range of
technical and political issues have hampered the widespread deployment
of these clean-energy sources. Governments could motivate reductions in
fossil fuels by enacting carbon taxes, which would penalize activities
in proportion to the emissions they cause. However, proposals to enact
such taxes have been very unpopular, especially in the U.S., and thus
have gained virtually no political traction. Although many people say
they are concerned about global warming, there is widespread resistance
among the U.S. electorate to paying for climate-related actions. Voters'
resistance to a carbon tax would be especially difficult to overcome
once they have a realistic understanding of its limited climate impact.
If the U.S. hypothetically cut its greenhouse-gas emissions to zero
today, there would be no reliably detectable effect on Earth's weather
or climate over the 21st century. If we accept the climate model
projections of 1.2o C or maybe 1.3o C additional warming over the rest
of the 21st century, U.S. annual emissions of about 13% of the world's
total would contribute less than 0.2o C of warming over the next 75
years. It would be a very tough sell to convince U.S. voters to incur
massively higher tax bills for a small reduction in the warming trend.
It would be especially tough to make that sale when China, India, and
many other countries are continuing to emit greenhouse gases at
prodigious rates. These problems with clean-energy subsidies and carbon
taxes have led U.S. and European governments to attempt to address
global warming through a variety of other tactics such as mandates,
quotas, prohibitions, and regulations on specific products and
activities because of their carbon footprint. These tactics include
mandating electric-vehicle production through setting caps on total
product-line emissions for automobile firms; outlawing the use of gas
stoves; controlling the supply of fossil fuels by regulatory
restrictions on permits for production; canceling oil and gas pipelines;
lobbying pension funds, university endowment funds and other such
organizations to divest their investment holdings of fossil-fuel firms;
and use of regulatory pressure to discourage banks and other financial
institutions from making loans to support investment in fossil-fuel
projects, both in the U.S. around the world. These tactics have been
adopted because of the urge to "do something" about a potential problem
and because few people recognize that these actions will have negligible
impact on global warming. Geopolitical concerns about fossil-fuel
suppression Another political impediment to suppression of fossil-fuel
use is that it would weaken our national security position by impeding
reliable access to large amounts of energy. China, Russia, and Iran may
say they will eventually reduce carbon emissions, but their incentives
to do otherwise are obvious. All three countries will be stronger in
military and economic terms by continuing to exploit their use of fossil
fuels. The lessons of history indicate that we ignore at our peril the
national security dimensions of energy policy. Consider, for example,
what Daniel Yergin (2008) says about World War II in "The Prize," his
Pulitzerprize winning history of oil (with italics added for emphasis):
"Petroleum was central to the course and outcome of World War II in both
the Far East and Europe. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor to protect
their flank as they grabbed for the petroleum resources of the East
Indies. Among Hitler's most important strategic objectives in the
invasion of the Soviet Union was the capture of the oil fields in the
Caucasus. But America's predominance in oil proved decisive and by the
end of the war German and Japanese fuel tanks were empty." Moral
concerns about fossil-fuel suppression Aggressive suppression of
fossil-fuel use would be morally unconscionable under any reasonable
ethical code, as it would impose costs on the more than 3 billion people
who have virtually no access to electricity. This large swath of
humanity would like access to abundant, cheap, and reliable
fossil-fuel-based energy to help lift themselves out of poverty and to
reduce the substantial health risk from long-term exposure to airborne
particulate matter caused by indoor burning of dung and wood. There are
now more than 6 billion people who would like to live in ways that most
of us in wealthy countries take for granted, with abundant and reliable
energy that few of us would willingly give up to any degree. The
ostensible urgency of attaining net-zero is seriously hampering progress
towards the UN's Sustainable Development goals of no poverty, no hunger,
affordable and clean energy, and the development of industry,
innovation, and infrastructure. International funds earmarked to aid
less developed countries are being directed away from efforts to reduce
poverty, and toward emission reductions, particularly in Africa. Hunger
eradication has been made more difficult by climate-mitigation efforts,
including (1) restrictions on livestock and fertilizer; (2) impediments
to the development of industry and infrastructure that require steel and
cement, which currently require fossil fuelsfor production; and (3)
continued emphasis on biofuels (because they are renewable and despite
their greenhouse-gas emissions). Other economic, technological, and
social impediments to fossil-fuel suppression Countries that have taken
the lead in the movement toward net-zero have had disappointing track
records, which discourages others from following their lead. For
example, widespread implementation of government-subsidized solar and
wind power has led to increased energy costs in the U.K. and Germany,
contributing to a domestic industrial decline. In 2022, Sri Lanka
experienced a dramatic drop in crop yields and food shortages after the
government banned fossil-fuel-based fertilizers, which led to social
unrest that was so serious that the president and his wife fled the
country. The broader problem is that many of the technologies needed for
net-zero either do not exist or are still in the demonstration or
prototype phase. Substantial innovation and investment is needed to
scale prototypes to be efficient and affordable for users. For solar and
wind, the needs are acute. At present, there is nothing close to viable
energy storage (batteries) available at scale to address the fact that
these sources provide no power absent sunshine and wind. Also needed are
large investments in transmission grids -- not just to move power to
locations far from rural points of origination, but also to accommodate
the asynchronicity of power from wind, solar, and batteries. These
impediments to net-zero are compounded by concerns about the enormous
amounts of materials needed for solar, wind, and battery infrastructure
changes, along with significant environmental impacts from mining of
inputs needed for their production. A closely related impediment is that
the huge land requirements for solar and wind farms are fostering
conflicts with both environmentalists and residents of rural areas about
issues of aesthetics, ecosystem impacts, and competing economic uses for
the land. Bad energy choices Bad choices about future energy systems are
a damaging consequence of the false sense of urgency that the
Apocalyptic climate narrative has created about suppressing fossil-fuel
use. That urgency effectively dictates that existing technologies like
solar and wind must replace fossil fuels. However, overcoming the low
power quality, intermittency, and synchronicity problems of solar and
wind power remains an ongoing challenge that may not ever be solved in a
cost-effective way. The technological reality is that solar and wind are
far inferior to fossil fuels for producing energy at the needed scale
and, at present, they are incapable of producing many of the materials
that are responsible for the lives of remarkable abundance available to
people who live in advanced industrial economies. The unfortunate result
is to distract attention from the potential role of more advanced energy
technologies that are under development and that are expected to provide
better medium- and long-term solutions than solar and wind. The issue is
not if, but when, more advanced energy technologies will emerge as
practical and economically viable at scale. Meanwhile, human flourishing
today requires enormous amounts of lowcost energy. That energy can come
only from the technologies and systems that we know how to build right
now, which are mainly fossil-fuel-based. Attempts to suppress
fossil-fuel use aggressively are therefore socially destructive in that
they would impose significant avoidable costs on humanity. Ever-growing
demand for energy All of these impediments to net-zero exist against the
backdrop of ever-growing demand for energy. There is huge pent-up demand
from developing nations, many of which are mired in energy poverty and
whose billions of citizens would like to lead lives with power access
that is commonplace in wealthy countries. There is a remarkable degree
of self-absorption among net-zero advocates in wealthy nations who
personally have ample access to energy and who feel comfortable arguing
that people in developed countries should exercise energy and material
restraint to slow down global warming when the climate impact of such
restraint will almost surely be undetectable. Greater access to
electricity can help reduce our vulnerability to weather and climate
through air conditioners, water desalination plants, irrigation,
vertical farming operations, water pumps, coastal defenses, and
environmental monitoring systems. And ever-growing amounts of
electricity will be needed for humans to be able to capture the benefits
from innovations in advanced materials, manufacturing, artificial
intelligence, robotics, photonics, quantum computing, blockchain,
electronics, and other economic arenas that are currently unforeseen or
unimagined. There is good reason to fear a future without cheap,
abundant fuel and the continued economic expansion that it fosters far
more than to fear planetary warming from the use of fossil fuels.
Degrading our energy supply by suppressing fossil fuels and forcing a
move to wind and solar will restrict the lifeblood of modern society.
Since there is no credible case of an impending Apocalypse from
continued use of fossil fuels, we would be shooting ourselves in the
foot by urgently suppressing their use. 4. Rational energy policy for
the 21st century Although fossil fuels have played a critical role in
generating enormous gains for humanity, there are good reasons for
seeking ways to reduce our reliance on them, including geopolitical
concerns, environmental degradation, and increasing costs of extraction.
What then makes sense for public policies to foster development of more
abundant, secure, inexpensive, and clean energy? The foundation of any
reasonable approach should be: First, do no harm. That means abandoning
the Apocalyptic climate narrative's prescription of aggressively
suppressing fossil-fuel use to attain net-zero CO2 emissions in the
near-term. We should build on that foundation by (i) recognizing that
human flourishing requires abundant and everincreasing energy, (ii)
pursuing research into a broad range of alternatives to fossil fuels as
energy sources and as material inputs to production (e.g., as with
fertilizer and plastics), (iii) approaching the next 25 years (and
perhaps longer) as a learning period grounded in intelligent trial and
error, and (iv) evaluating all technologies holistically for abundance,
reliability, costs calculated on an "all-in" lifecycle basis, sensible
land and resource use, air-quality impact, and environmental impact
generally. Implications for public energy policies We offer nine
principles for operationalizing this approach to U.S. energy policies,
with #3, #5, and #6 specifying actions we should take and the remainder
highlighting what we should not do. 1. We should not inflict costs on
U.S. citizens -- reduced overall economic prosperity, constrained
individual choice, and diminished national security -- by adopting
public policies intended to mitigate global warming that will not
detectably affect Earth's temperature in the short or long run. 2. We
should not eliminate fossil fuels before we have technologically viable
and cost-effective replacements for the critical inputs they provide in
the production of food, steel, cement, plastics, and electricity. 3. We
should use "carrots" to foster investment in innovation in energy,
materials science, and agricultural science, as well as in the ability
of humans to adapt to a changing climate. 4. We should not use "sticks"
to punish consumption that generates greenhouse gasses (e.g., banning
gas stoves, jet travel, internal combustion engines, and non-vegan
food), while having no material effect on temperatures now or in the
long run. 5. We should cultivate clean energy (to reduce air pollution)
and energy independence (for national defense and economic security
reasons) with a diversified set of reliable energy sources to hedge the
risks of adverse "unknown unknowns" in the evolution of our political,
economic, and physical environments. 6. We should put major emphasis on
the resuscitation (and refined development) of nuclear power, which is
at least as safe as solar and wind and far safer than coal and oil
(based on comparisons of death rates due to both accidents and air
pollution per unit of electricity generated). 7. We should not focus
narrowly on solar panels, wind turbines, and biofuels. Solar and wind
are problematic because of their (i) unreliability and consequent need
for a stand-by power system, (ii) low energy density and consequent
massive land requirements to deliver energy at scale, and (iii) negative
externalities (e.g., from rare-earth mining to produce batteries to
address the unreliability problem). Biofuel emissions are at least as
bad as gasoline, while biofuel production uses massive amounts of
cropland and played a significant role in three major food crises in the
last 20 years. 8. We should not engage in backdoor regulation of
fossil-fuel use by the Federal Reserve (through bank oversight) and the
SEC (through ESG empowerment) that will warp the allocation of
investment capital. 9. We should not use our power to impose credit
policies toward developing countries (e.g., by the World Bank) that
discourage fossil-fuel-based projects and thereby make it more difficult
for world's poorest people to elevate themselves out of poverty. The
three proactive principles (#3, #5, and #6) reflect the physical reality
that human flourishing depends critically on the abundant availability
of energy and on the currently irreplaceable role that fossil fuels play
in the production of food, steel, cement and plastics. Deterrent
principle #7, which cautions against a narrow focus on solar, wind, and
biofuels, reflects the strong technological limits of these
technologies. The remaining deterrent principles (#1, #2, #4, #8, and
#9) reflect the fact that it makes no sense to mandate or constrain
choices that will cause humanity to bear costs when those choices will
have no detectable effect on global warming in the short- or long-run.
These costs have a direct component: Avoidable waste from outlays on
unpromising technologies and on consumption goods that simply sound good
from a carbon emissions perspective. They also have an opportunity cost
component in terms of diverting resources from worthwhile causes,
including investments to foster greater resilience to weather and
climate extremes as well as to help wide swaths of humanity to elevate
themselves out of poverty. Implications for investors and their agents
The flaws in the Apocalyptic climate narrative have three important
implications for the risk-management decisions of private investors and
for the corporate directors and money managers who work on their behalf.
• The actual risks of fossil-fuel-generated climate change are not
nearly as great as portrayed in the drumbeat of worried discussions of
global warming in public discourse that the Apocalyptic climate
narrative has fostered. • Those who nonetheless want to do something to
help mitigate global warming should realize that the long-run
consequences for the planet of the ESG pursuit of a reduced corporate
carbon footprint will do little, if anything, to change the climate over
the course of the 21st century. • The Apocalyptic climate narrative is
itself an element of investment risk. The narrative has gained such
powerful traction -- especially in the U.S. and other wealthy countries
-- that it is significantly affecting the allocation of real resources
and the stock-market values of companies. The latter traction creates
upside investment potential and downside risk. The upside, of course, is
the potential for profits by responding to the demand for green
investments. The downside risk is the possibility that many people will
eventually come to realize that the importance of suppressing
fossil-fuel use has been blown far out of proportion in public
discourse. From a capital markets perspective, the current
green-investment situation accordingly has elements of a stock-price
bubble that is supported by a false narrative. One can expect that
bubble to sustain or grow provided that many people continue to buy into
the premise of an urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels and
as governments add more subsidies to renewable-energy projects. The
danger is that the bubble will pop or dissolve as it becomes
increasingly clear that the Apocalyptic climate narrative is an
extremely effective form of environmentalist propaganda that markedly
overstates the risks to humanity of continued global warming. One might
be tempted to take investment positions that effectively "short the
bubble" and wait for the gains to come rolling in when the bubble pops
or dissolves. The problem with such strategies is that substantial
valuation errors in the capital market can take a long time to correct.
Consequently, arbitrageurs who have finite capital to invest and who
make strong bets against the bubble can be wiped out financially before
the asset-pricing errors are corrected. The upshot is that there is no
clear path to a "free lunch" of abnormal investment performance from
shorting green investments. The reason is that one simply cannot be sure
about whether or when the world will come to broad recognition of the
flaws in the narrative.

Is it worth it? Is an undetectable reduction in the warming trend worth
a huge sacrifice in the quality of life caused by an urgent move to
net-zero? According to the Apocalyptic climate narrative, the answer is
yes because humanity (ostensibly) faces an existential threat from
global warming. However, [there is]{.underline} **[no credible

threat]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} global

Public policies that enforce an urgent move to net-zero would be

### Link Turn

#### Link turn - boosting military presence in the Arctic is key to dialogue and engagement with Russia

The fifth risk concerns the impact that Russia's full-scale war on
Ukraine has on preventing the United States and its like-minded allies
and partners in the region from engaging in Arctic "business as usual."
[The reality is that the United States shares a maritime border with
Russia, and Russia will continue to be an important player in the Far
North for years to come as the region's largest country with great
economic aspirations for the Arctic and a substantial military presence
there]{.underline}. Thus, **[managing an Arctic relationship with Russia
is a necessity]{.underline}** **[and requires that the United States
improve its access to and presence in the Arctic to successfully do
so]{.underline}**. [This will facilitate engagement when needed to
conduct responsibilities and improve the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' ability to balance Russia's presence around
strategic areas, such as the Bering Strait. **[More regional activity
runs the risk of escalating tensions or causing accidents, which further
emphasizes the importance of a U.S. presence that can facilitate domain
awareness and strong communications]{.underline}**.

[The sixth risk concerns the potential for accidental escalation of
NATO-Russia tensions]{.underline}. **[The United States' limited access
to and presence in the Arctic can also prevent the U.S. government from
having the appropriate domain awareness, communications, and other
capabilities necessary to prevent military accidents and
escalation]{.underline}**. This escalatory potential is particularly
relevant in the context of Sweden's imminent accession to NATO, which
would mean that seven of eight Arctic countries will be NATO members.
[In this context, Russia may increasingly perceive NATO encroachment in
the Arctic, which could potentially result in further increasing
tensions in the region.]{.underline}

### Canada Thumps

#### Canada should have triggered the link 

**Agence France Presse 24** \["Canada bolstering Arctic presence in face
of Russia threat," pg. Lexis, ALB\]

[Canada will boost its military and diplomatic presence in the Arctic to
counter what it calls threats from Russia]{.underline} and others
seeking a foothold in the far north, as part of a new doctrine unveiled
Friday.

[The government envisions the deployment of new patrol ships and navy
destroyers, ice breakers and submarines]{.underline} capable of
operating beneath ice sheets, as well as more aircraft and drones.

Along with the United States it is modernizing continental defences
including surveillance of northern approaches with new maritime sensors
and satellites.

[The foreign policy document notes that Ottawa for years has sought to
manage the Arctic cooperatively with other states and keep it free from
military competition]{.underline}.

\"[However, guardrails that prevent conflicts are increasingly under
immense strain]{.underline},\" Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told a news
conference.

[\"The Arctic is no longer a low-tension region,\" she said, blaming
Russian designs on the Artic and deepening geopolitical
rivalries]{.underline}.

[The minister said Russia was also teaming up in the far north with
China]{.underline}, which is itself seeking greater influence in the
governance of the region

The Arctic is warming on average four times faster than the rest of the
world. That is opening up new opportunities for shipping and exploration
of resources like oil, gas and minerals.

The growing access is heightening security challenges, Defense Minister
Bill Blair warned.

[Canada\'s revised doctrine, he said, calls for strengthening military
capabilities to \"conduct and sustain operations in the
Arctic\"]{.underline} where biting cold and unpredictable storms, long
periods of darkness, and drifting sea ice pose severe hazards.

[Ottawa will also seek deeper collaboration \-- including more joint
military drills \-- with allied Nordic nations]{.underline}, of which
five are now also NATO members with the recent additions of Finland and
Sweden.

The report outlining Canada\'s shift highlighted recent increased
Russian activity along the edges of North American airspace.

[It also called \"deeply troubling\" Russian weapons testing and
deployment of missile systems in the Arctic capable of striking North
America and Europe]{.underline}.

Canada accused China of regularly deploying in the north vessels
equipped with dual-use military-research capabilities to collect data.

In response, [Canada will now apply a national security lens to foreign
research in its Arctic region,]{.underline} while Ottawa explores ways
to deepen Arctic cooperation with Japan and South Korea, similar to the
allies\' Indo-Pacific partnership.

It will also create a new Arctic ambassador post and open consulates in
Alaska and Greenland, as it seeks to settle a boundary dispute with the
United States in the Beaufort Sea and finalize a deal with Denmark to
split Hans Island.

In 2022, Canada and Denmark agreed to effectively create the first land
border between Canada and Europe on the tiny, barren, and uninhabited
outcrop in the Arctic.

Enduring Russian attitudes

Means of exercising deterrence are as many, as varied and as complex as
the different domains in which it can be exercised. One factor, however,
remains relatively constant: the doctrine, preconceptions and conceptual
underpinnings of the party to be deterred. In the case of Russia, this
introduces a layer of relative predictability, since the [[behaviours of
Russia's military]{.mark} and state leadership in **response** to
external stimuli have [remained]{.mark} **remarkably
[consistent]{.mark}** [throughout]{.mark} social, political and
technological upheaval]{.underline}, not only during the Soviet and
post-Soviet period but back [through [centuries]{.mark} of Russian
history]{.underline}.23 Historical parallels can be overstated, but past
performance can nevertheless be a guide to future results. As noted by
RUSI's Jack Watling, '[Deterrence is about **cognitive
effects**]{.underline}. Governments are not very revealing as to how
they assess threats, and their public statements can be highly
misleading. However, [analysing statements over time]{.underline}, and
tracking how they correspond with actions, does [provide a **baseline**
against which to **assess** threat perception]{.underline}.'24 In the
case of Russian security thinking, the responses displayed throughout
the past are so strikingly uniform that they present a weighty argument
for considering that they are likely to be emulated today. This chapter
therefore introduces a number of guiding principles of Russian state
thought and action which appear persistent and dependable, and which
therefore provide a basis for calibrating actions and messages intended
to deter.

Expansionism

[[Russia has]{.mark} a [**consistent history** of seeking
stability]{.mark} and security [through
**expanding**]{.mark}]{.underline} the geographical area under its
occupation or control, based at least in part on a drive to reduce
potential threats by pushing them further away. This desire for a cordon
sanitaire under Russian control remains strong, and was an important
contributing factor to Russia's decision to seize Crimea and undertake a
military campaign in eastern Ukraine in order to avert the perceived
danger of Ukraine escaping the Russian sphere of dominance -- a move
Russia later capitalized on by transforming Crimea into a militarized
outpost protecting its Black Sea approaches in a mirror image to the
role of Kaliningrad on the Baltic. But in the present decade, Russian
control need not be achieved by the traditional means of military
occupation. It remains the case that in order to stop losing ground,
Russia sees the utility of seizing small slices of territory in order to
create frozen conflicts and political impasses (a process known as
piece-keeping, in the sense of keeping small pieces of other people's
countries). But its intensive focus on asymmetric measures, and in
particular the utility of information warfare for exerting control
without the need for overt military intervention, means that the threat
from Russian expansionism is far more diverse and nuanced than when it
could be detected through the simple fact of Russian tanks crossing a
border.25

The [fact that [one]{.mark} of the **[motivation]{.mark}s**
for]{.underline} this [expansionist urge is [to **reduce
threats**]{.mark} to Russia]{.underline} itself
[[presents]{.underline}]{.mark} a [further **[challenge]{.mark}**, in
the form of arguments [that]{.mark} Russia's actions
**must**]{.underline} consequently [be forgiven, excused and tolerated
and]{.underline} -- above all -- [that its **[aspiration]{.mark}** to a
sphere of unchallenged dominion in Europe [is]{.mark} entirely
**[defensive]{.mark}** in nature. **[However]{.mark}**, the [drive to
expand]{.mark} control at the **expense** of neighbouring states has
[persisted even in]{.mark} the [**absence** o]{.mark}f any [perceptible
threat]{.mark} to Russia]{.underline}. An assessment in 1955 concluded
that [the seizure of control over Eastern Europe **[following]{.mark}**
the [Second World War]{.mark} was driven by **persistent attitudes**,
not immediate stimuli]{.underline}: 'The Soviet regime merely
accentuated certain basic Russian cultural themes,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Russians would have been expansionists in
the post World War II period even if there had been no Soviet regime.'26
A [**similar conclusion** was reached at the end of the **[Cold
War]{.mark}**]{.underline}: 'As Russians today \[1994\] rediscover their
tsarist past, they come face-to-face with an older and deeper national
tradition of imperial rule over their neighbours.'2

There is a perpetual debate over whether the background noise of hostile
actions by Russia in a wide range of domains -- in cyberspace, in
disinformation, in military interventions in third countries -- is
caused by a belief that it is defending itself against an actual and
genuine threat from the West, or is simply an expression of its nature
as an unreconstructed expansionist power. But the net result is the
same. In order to achieve its aspirations of expanded control, Russia
needs to check and roll back, not cooperate with, the US and its
influence worldwide. This is an inherently destructive impulse and one
that it is essential to constrain.

Willingness to withdraw

However, [[another]{.mark} **consistent [pattern]{.mark}** in Russian
expansionist behaviour is [readiness to **stop**]{.mark} or indeed pull
back [when]{.mark} **significant [resistance]{.mark}** [is
encountered]{.mark}]{.underline}. A [saying]{.underline} commonly
[attributed to]{.underline} Vladimir [[**Lenin**
held]{.underline}]{.mark} that in order to expand its influence, Moscow
should '[probe with a bayonet; [when]{.mark} you [encounter **mush**,
push on]{.mark}; if you find [**steel**, pull
back]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}.28 Russia's adversaries have at
times perceived this approach clearly: in the mid-19th century British
prime minister Lord Palmerston noted: 'The policy and practice of the
Russian government has always been to push forwards its encroachments as
fast and as far as the apathy and want of firmness of other governments
would allow it to go, but always to stop and retire when it met with
decided resistance.'29 Certainly [[Russia]{.mark} and its leaders and
military commanders have [**consistently** acted]{.mark} as though
**guided** [by this]{.mark} principle]{.underline}. A year later a
French political commentator observed that 'it matters little to Russia
to be right or wrong, or to draw back if required',30 and this principle
held good throughout the Soviet period in the next century, consistent
with a 'general rule that the Russians are cautious to a degree, are
quite good at sensing danger, and, when they do miscalculate in the
grand manner, think nothing of going into reverse and cutting their
losses'.31 George Kennan observed that [[showdowns]{.mark} with Moscow
could be [**avoided** through]{.mark} sufficient [demonstrations of
**strength**]{.mark} and resolve]{.underline}: 'Impervious to logic of
reason \[[Russia]{.underline}\] is [**highly sensitive** to logic of
force]{.underline}. For this reason [it can **easily**
withdraw]{.underline} -- [and **usually does** when strong resistance is
encountered]{.underline} at any point. Thus, if the adversary has
sufficient force and makes clear his readiness to use it, he rarely has
to do so.'32 The example of the 2017 Syrian standoff described in
Chapter 1 suggests that demonstrations of resolve and willingness to
stand firm in the face of Russian demands, assertions or threats
continue to be the best means of avoiding conflict; and anecdotal
evidence from US and other service personnel encountering their Russian
counterparts in similar situations suggests that this principle
consistently holds good.

At the same time it should not be assumed that Moscow's ambitions are
limited to the immediate cause or focus of conflict, whether
geographically or politically. Open invitations to seize control or
ground will be taken, as in the armed conflict with Georgia in 2008,
when the leading elements of Russian troops continued their advance
towards Tbilisi after the effective end of the fighting simply because
nobody had told them to stop. [[If Russia achieves]{.underline}]{.mark}
its [[objectives]{.mark} and is]{.underline} still
**[unchecked]{.underline}**, previous [[patterns of]{.mark} behaviour
[**suggest** that it will **continue**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in order
[to marshal **additional means** for leverage at the negotiating
table]{.underline}. Following another principle that holds good
throughout both recent and more distant history, Russia has shown itself
content to take two steps forward and one step back in order to advance
its position. There is a consistent pattern, whether in territorial
control or in any other aspect of international relations: [Moscow
**routinely wins** by demanding the **whole** of somebody else's cake
and then **ingraciously** settling for only half]{.underline}.

Respect for strength

According to former Estonian defence minister Sven Mikser: '[[For Putin,
**weakness**]{.mark} is [more provocative than
**strength**]{.mark}]{.underline}.'33 President [Putin]{.underline} has
indeed [expressed this view **clearly**, justifying]{.underline} his
country's far-reaching and enormously [expensive military]{.underline}
transformation and [rearmament with]{.underline} the
**[concern]{.underline}** that [Russia 'must not **tempt** anyone by our
weakness']{.underline}.34 In this mindset, both [[deficiencies in
**conventional**]{.mark} **military [power]{.mark}**]{.underline} and a
visible deficit in will to resist [[present]{.mark} a temptation and an
[invitation]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Weakness provokes]{.mark}**, but
**[readiness deters]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Overall conclusions

[Russia]{.underline} can [exploit **differences** in strategic cultures
between itself and Western powers. This includes **greater willingness**
by Russia to accept risk, and to **accept** brief or protracted conflict
as a means to further **state aims**, as evidenced in]{.underline}
continuing operations in [**Ukraine** and Syria]{.underline}.173 A
distinguishing feature in Russian conduct is a higher acceptance of risk
and a lower threshold for the use of force, be it military or
non-military. In order to avoid this trap, it is essential that Russia's
adversaries also display willingness to exhibit a firm response to
challenges, up to and including meeting force with force and maintaining
escalation dominance. A 2020 RUSI study noted:

> The prospect of actually harming Russians and the perceived escalatory

Two of the case studies explored above -- the Russia--Turkey air
encounter and the Deir ez-Zor incident -- support the conclusion that
given Russia's higher tolerance both of casualties and of setbacks
incurred in the course of probing the boundaries of the possible, these
incidents should be seen as a successful demonstration of red lines to
Moscow. The lesson from both cases is that escalation from an unplanned
clash can be managed, and firm enforcement of boundaries does not
preclude a constructive relationship with Russia.

[Crucially, [Russia]{.mark} does **[not]{.mark}**]{.underline}
necessarily [[regard assertive action for]{.mark} the **purpose** of
[deterrence as **provocative**]{.mark}]{.underline}; rather, [it is
[considered]{.mark} a [**normal part** of interaction]{.mark} between
states]{.underline}. This takes the form of a non-verbal conversation,
since as Dima Adamsky notes, 'the deterrence equation, for the product
of this cognitive milieu, is a function of one and one's competitor
interacting, and not of mere static balances, an insight from which
emanates another instinct -- the inclination to constantly shape the
adversary'.175 Moscow is ready for this conversation to be robust:
according to Daniel Flynn, '[since Russia is at **war**, [for]{.mark}
the [Kremlin]{.mark}, there]{.underline} \[[are
**[no]{.mark}**]{.underline}\] [[unacceptable]{.mark} forms of
**[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, compellence, or coercion'.176
[This]{.underline} also [highlights]{.underline} a
[**[dangerous]{.mark}** false [premise]{.mark} guiding]{.underline} many
[**West**ern approaches to confrontation]{.underline} with Russia
overall: the [[notion]{.mark} that [Western states]{.mark} can
[**choose** whether they enter]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[conflict with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} or not. This [**[false premise]{.mark}**
underpins every action that simultaneously seeks to **punish** Russian
hostility but also [to]{.mark} '**[avoid
escalation]{.mark}**']{.underline}. This [avoidance [is
**counter-productive**]{.mark}, [since]{.mark} 'the **[more
confident]{.mark}** the Russian [leadership is]{.mark} in the ability to
manage escalation]{.underline}, and in the existence of workable war
termination strategies in each possible type of war (local, regional,
and large-scale), [the [more **likely** they]{.mark} are to [engage in
activities **short of war**]{.mark} or competitions in risk
taking]{.underline}'.177

[The North American Arctic is a focus for geopolitical

interests in the region]{.underline}. [The PRC, although not an Arctic
nation, is investing in capabilities to exploit the region for strategic
purposes]{.underline} and seeks to participate in its governance and
economy.

The Arctic focus is heightened by a steady melting of the polar ice cap,
enhancing shipping access to the resource-rich and strategically
critical region that once was largely ignored, hidden beneath frozen
terrain. Arctic temperatures are rising as much as four times faster
than the global average, studies show.

As part of its One Belt, One Road infrastructure scheme, [the PRC is
expanding naval operations in an attempt to secure sea lanes for a
growing shipping industry, leveraging dual-use military and research
vessels to increase Chinese Communist Party military engagement and
Arctic domain awareness. Growing cooperation between the PRC and Russia,
as evidenced by recent combined maritime and bomber patrols, could
undermine Arctic stability, potentially leading to misunderstandings and
miscalculations]{.underline}.

[The North American Arctic holds critical defense infrastructure for the
U.S. and its Allies and Partners]{.underline}, **[including long-range
radars essential to domain awareness and Indo-Pacific capabilities

expand into the Arctic, the U.S. could face domain awareness disruption
across Alaska, and disruption of power projection infrastructure that
could compromise deployment of advanced capabilities to the Indo-Pacific

Such scenarios are driving a resurgence of the U.S. Department of

On August 6, 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise cross-border
offensive into Russia's Kursk region---the biggest foreign incursion
into Russian territory since World War II. Russian President Vladimir
Putin's response was telling. [Days after **Ukraine's offensive**,
[Putin **railed** against]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates and Europe]{.underline}. "The West is fighting us
with the hands of the Ukrainians," he said, [**[reiterating]{.mark}**
his [view]{.mark} that [Russia's war]{.mark} in Ukraine [is]{.mark} in
fact [a **proxy battle** with the West]{.mark}]{.underline}. But he
initiated no immediate military counterattack. Putin was unwilling to
divert substantial numbers of troops away from their operations in
eastern Ukraine even to recover territory back home. Three months later,
with Ukrainian forces still in Kursk, Moscow instead brought in North
Korean troops to help push them out---the first time in more than a
century that Russia has invited foreign troops onto its soil.

[Moscow's actions **underscore** how]{.underline}, after almost three
years since Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor,
[[Putin]{.mark} is now [**more** committed than ever
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the war with Ukraine [and his **broader
[confrontation]{.mark}** with the West]{.underline}. Although the
conflict is first and foremost an imperial pursuit to end Ukraine's
independence, [Putin's [**ultimate** objectives are to
**relitigate**]{.mark} the post--[Cold War order]{.mark} in Europe,
**[weaken]{.mark}** the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, [and
usher in]{.mark} a [**new** international system]{.mark}]{.underline}
that affords Russia the status and influence Putin believes it deserves.

[These goals are **not new**. But the [war]{.mark} has
**[hardened]{.mark}** Putin's [resolve]{.mark} and **[narrowed]{.mark}**
his [options]{.mark}. There is **no** turning back: Putin has
[**already** transformed]{.mark} Russia's [society]{.mark},
[economy]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} foreign [policy]{.mark} to **better
position** the Kremlin to take on the West. Having **[accepted]{.mark}**
the [mantle of]{.mark} a **[rogue]{.mark} regime**]{.underline}, Russia
is now even less likely to see a need for constraint.

[[confrontation]{.mark} with Russia [to **intensify**]{.mark},

interest in normalizing relations with Moscow. The war is not going well
for Ukraine, in part because the limited assistance the West has sent to

**revise** the security order in Europe]{.underline}. What's more, the
Kremlin will look to pocket any concessions from the Trump
administration for ending the current war, such as sanctions relief, to
strengthen its hand for the next one. [Russia is **already** preparing
the ground through the **sabotage** and other special operations it has
**unleashed** across Europe]{.underline} and through its alignment with
other rogue actors, including Iran and North Korea. European countries
are only slightly more prepared to handle the Russian challenge on their
own than they were three years ago. And depending on how the war in
Ukraine ends, [the [possibility of **another war**]{.mark} with Russia
**[looms]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The question is not whether Russia will pose a threat to the United
States and its allies but how to assess the magnitude of the danger and
the effort required to contain it. China will remain the United States'
primary competitor. But even with much of its attention called to Asia,
Washington cannot ignore a recalcitrant and revanchist adversary in
Europe, especially not one that will pose a direct military threat to
NATO members.

The Russian problem is also a global one. Putin's willingness to invade
a neighbor, assault democratic societies, and generally violate accepted
norms---and his seeming ability to get away with it---paves the way for
others to do the same. The Kremlin's provision of military equipment and
know-how to current and aspiring U.S. adversaries will amplify these
threats, multiplying the challenges that Washington will face from
China, Iran, North Korea, and any other country that Russia backs.

The United States and Europe, therefore, must invest in resisting Russia
now or pay a far greater cost later. The incoming Trump administration,
in particular, does not have the luxury of shoving Russia down its list
of policy priorities. If Putin sees Washington doing so, he will grow
only more brazen and ambitious in his efforts to weaken the United
States and its allies, both directly and through the axis of upheaval
that Russia supports. To prevent that outcome, Washington and its allies
must help Ukraine strengthen its position ahead of negotiations to end
the current war. The United States is right to prioritize China, but in
order to effectively compete with Beijing, it first needs to set
European security on the right path. Washington must remain the primary
enabler of that security for now, while making sure that Europe ramps up
the investments required to better handle its own defense in the years
ahead. By taking the steps necessary to counter Russia today, the United
States and Europe can ensure that the threat they face tomorrow will be
a manageable one.

IN TOO DEEP

[[Putin]{.mark} has [**changed** Russia]{.mark} in ways that will
[**ensure** it remains]{.mark} a [challenge to]{.mark} the [West]{.mark}
as **long** as he is in power and likely **well beyond**.
[Confrontation]{.mark} is [now]{.mark} the [**hallmark** of]{.mark}
Russia's **[fo]{.mark}**reign **[po]{.mark}**licy,]{.underline} with
Putin citing his country's "existential struggle" with the West to
justify his regime and its actions. This idea of a Russian civilization
in constant conflict with its Western foes strengthens the ideological
foundation of his rule---a source of legitimacy he now needs to
safeguard his hold on power.

Putin's increased reliance on repression has generated risks to the
stability of his regime. Political science research shows that
repression is effective in the sense that it increases autocrats'
longevity in office. But depending too heavily on it, as Putin has done,
can raise the prospect that leaders will make destabilizing mistakes.
Heavy-handed tactics compel people to mask their private views and avoid
sharing anything but what the government wants to hear, which means the
autocrat, too, loses access to accurate information. High levels of
repression also create a rising reservoir of general dissatisfaction, so
that even a small outburst of discontent can quickly spiral into trouble
for the regime. To mitigate these risks and reinforce his hold on power,
Putin has used his control over the information environment to convince
the Russian people that their country is at war with a West that wants
to break it apart.

[Putin has]{.underline} also [**[reoriented]{.mark}** the [Russian
economy around]{.mark} his **[war]{.mark}**. Russia's [defense
spending]{.mark} is [set to reach]{.mark} its **[highest point]{.mark}**
since the collapse of the Soviet Union]{.underline}, with \$145 billion
allocated in the 2025 budget---the equivalent of 6.3 percent of GDP and
more than double the \$66 billion Russia budgeted for defense in 2021,
the year before the invasion. And the true amount of such spending will
likely be higher, possibly exceeding eight percent of GDP, once other,
unofficial forms of defense-related expenditures are accounted for.
(When also adjusting for considerable differences in purchasing power
parity between Russia and the United States, Russia's actual defense
spending is much higher than \$145 billion, exceeding \$200 billion.)
Russian factories producing military equipment have added shifts to
increase production; workers have moved from civilian to military
sectors, where the wages are higher; and payouts for military service
have skyrocketed. The war has become a wealth transfer mechanism
channeling money to Russia's poor regions, and many economic elites have
moved into the defense sector to cash in on lucrative opportunities.
Elites have, by now, adjusted to the system's current configuration,
enabling them not just to survive but to profit from it.

Having gone through the pain of shifting the economy to a wartime
footing and feeling the pressure of new vested interests, Putin is
unlikely to undo these changes quickly. After the fighting in Ukraine
ends, he will probably instead look to justify the continuation of the
wartime economy. Such was the inclination of Soviet leader Joseph
Stalin, who, after the Allied victory in World War II, soon began to
speak of Moscow's new five-year plans as necessary preparation for the
next inevitable war.

[Russian foreign policy is also **transforming** in ways that will be
difficult to undo]{.underline}. The [invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark} has
[made it **impossible**]{.mark} for Russia [to build ties with]{.mark}
the [West]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Moscow has had to look for
opportunities elsewhere. Its deepening [[partnerships]{.mark} with
China, Iran, and North Korea]{.underline} may [have been
[driven]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[by **necessity**]{.mark}: Russia
needs]{.underline} their [help to **sustain** its economy and
warfighting machine]{.underline}. But [Moscow also **understands** that
by working with these countries, [it is in]{.mark} a [**better
position** to sustain]{.mark} a [long-term **competition** with]{.mark}
the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates and its
**allies**]{.underline}. Not only does their support make Russia less
isolated and less vulnerable to the United States' tools of economic
warfare; Russia also benefits from having cobelligerents working in
tandem to weaken the West. The [[Kremlin]{.mark} has [gone **all
in**]{.mark} on these partnerships, [having **abandoned**
caution]{.mark} in cooperating with North Korea, **overcome** its
concern with overdependence on China, and **elevated** relations with
Iran beyond transactional engagement]{.underline}. All of this amounts
to a new strategy for Moscow, one that will not simply disappear after
the fighting in Ukraine subsides or ends.

RUSSIA RELOADS

Russia's military threat is not going away, either. The question of
Russian military reconstitution is not an if but a when. Even if Russia
cannot sustain its current wartime spending, the defense budget is
likely to remain substantially above prewar levels for some time to
come. The Russian military, too, is unlikely to shrink back to the
relatively small army Russia fielded before the war. One lesson that
Russia's military brass took from Ukraine is that the Russian army was
not "Soviet" enough in that it lacked mass and the capacity to replace
losses. In reality, the Russian military was stuck in a halfway state,
having acquired some advanced or modernized capabilities but also
retaining some Soviet-era characteristics, including conscription and a
culture of centralized command that discouraged initiative. Now, Russia
is likely to maintain a large overall force with an expanded structure
and greater manpower allocation, although it will still depend on
mobilization in the event of war to reduce the cost of its standing
army.

Reconstitution is about not just materiel but also the capacity to
conduct large-scale combat operations. The Russian military has shown
that it can learn as an organization; it is capable of scaling the
deployment of new technology such as drones and electronic warfare
systems onto the battlefield, and it will be a changed force after its
experience in Ukraine. Despite its initial poor showing, the Russian
military has demonstrated staying power and the ability to withstand
high levels of attrition.

Russia's military reconstitution will face headwinds, especially from
the country's limited defense industrial capacity and skilled labor
shortage. Russian industry has not been able to significantly scale the
production of major platforms and weapons systems. Labor and machine
tools remain major constraints because of Western sanctions and export
controls. Russia has still been able to significantly increase the
production of missiles, precision-guided weapons, drones, and artillery
munitions, and it has set up an effective repair and refurbishment
pipeline for existing equipment. But it is also drawing from aging
stocks that it inherited from the Soviet Union for much of its land
force equipment. Thus, as it expands its forces and replaces losses, it
is depleting its resources.

From now on, the Russian military will have a duality to it, with areas
of strength but equally prominent weaknesses. On the one hand, it has
become much better at dynamic targeting, precision strikes, the
integration of drones in combat operations, and more sophisticated
methods of employing long-range precision-guided weapons. Russia has
adapted to---and in some cases developed effective tactics to
counter---the Western capabilities it confronted in Ukraine. Over time,
Russian forces reorganized logistics and command and control, coming up
with ways to reduce the efficacy of Western equipment and intercept
Western munitions, and they have learned to operate with the presence of
Western long-range precision-guided weapons, intelligence, and
targeting.

For NATO, this ought to set off alarms. Some analysts argue that the way
Ukraine is fighting now is not the way NATO would fight in a potential
future war with Russia. They contend specifically that NATO would
quickly earn and maintain air superiority, changing the nature of the
conflict. Although this may be true, airpower will not solve every
battlefield challenge NATO might face. And most European air forces lack
munitions for a sustained conventional war. The time it would take to
deplete their arsenals can best be measured in weeks and in many cases
days.

On the other hand, a substantial percentage of the Russian ground force
will likely continue to field dated Soviet equipment, and it will take
years to rebuild force quality and replace the officers lost in
Ukraine.T he outlook for Russia's defense capacity will also depend on
whether its economy is running flat out and the defense sector has
already maximized production or if there is still room for production to
increase as new and refurbished plants and facilities come online.
Overall, the Russian military will remain a patchwork, with some parts
more advanced and capable than they were at the start of 2022 and other
parts still using equipment from the middle of the Cold War, if not
earlier. But the chances of the Russian armed forces being decisively
knocked out and unable to pose a major threat for a prolonged period are
low.

A GROWING GAP

The [[risks from]{.mark} the **[reconstitution]{.mark}** of Russia's
military are [**compounded** by]{.mark} the West's [**lackluster**
response]{.mark} to rising Russian aggression]{.underline}. Europe still
has a long way to go before it is prepared to handle the threat from
Russia on its own. [[European]{.mark} defense [production]{.mark} is
**[insufficient]{.mark}** to meet rearmament goals]{.underline}, despite
Europe's advantages in capital, machine tools, and labor productivity.
European countries have substantially depleted their stocks by
transferring older equipment to Ukraine, limiting their militaries'
mobilization potential. These countries will soon face the dual pressure
of funding Ukraine's war effort and recovery while replacing their own
expended war materiel. Given how limited their arsenals were to begin
with, if they want to be equipped to handle Russian belligerence, they
will need to build well beyond 2022 levels---not just restore what was
lost.

Current trends suggest that although European defense spending is likely
to rise, the increases may not be enough to significantly expand
military capability. There are exceptions, such as Poland and the Baltic
states. But many countries with large budgets, such as Italy and Spain,
are lagging behind. Many have yet to meet the commitment made by all
NATO allies to spend the equivalent of two percent of GDP on defense.
Across Europe, defense production is constrained by industrial capacity,
the slow pace of finalizing contracts, and competing budgetary
imperatives. All these issues can be overcome with sufficient political
will, but European leaders first have to be clear-eyed in their
assessment of the security environment. The United States is not going
to significantly expand its presence in Europe; at best, Washington's
commitment to European security will remain constant as it pushes Europe
to do more, and there is a real risk that it will turn its focus
elsewhere. Europe must prepare to foot more of the bill to ensure that
Ukraine is in a position to defend itself and to deter future Russian
aggression against both Ukraine and Europe as a whole.

[American leaders]{.underline}, for their part, [will have to be
**realistic** about Europe's capabilities]{.underline}. Even those
countries that are now investing heavily in equipment and procurement
are still having issues recruiting, retaining, and training sufficient
forces. And defense spending does not easily translate into the ability
to conduct large-scale combat operations[. Modern operations are
**complex**, and [Europe]{.mark}an countries generally [**cannot**
execute]{.mark} them [without U.S. support]{.mark}. Most militaries on
the continent have **coevolved** to complement the U.S. military rather
than to operate **independently**]{.underline}.

European militaries and NATO have made some progress matching their
defense investments with the requirements of regional defense plans. But
the forces active on the continent are not capable of handling a
large-scale war on their own. They would find it difficult to agree on
who would lead such an operation and who would provide the necessary
supporting elements. European militaries would struggle to defend a
fellow NATO member, or Ukraine, without U.S. help---a dependence that
Washington has, to some extent, perpetuated. Thus, although the United
States should continue to press its European allies to take on more of
the security burden, Washington must appreciate that it will take a long
time for Europe to get there.

THE RISING RISK OF WAR

Europe and the United States are not preparing for some far-off threat.
[[Moscow]{.mark} is [**already** waging]{.mark} an [unconventional
war]{.mark} against Europe. Within the past few years, suspected
[Russian]{.mark}-backed [actors]{.mark} have **[set fire]{.mark}** to
warehouses [in Germany and]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[K]{.mark}**ingdom that were **full** of arms and ammunition for
Ukraine, [tampered with **water**]{.mark} **purification** centers in
Finland, [pushed **migrants**]{.mark}]{.underline} from the Middle East
and North Africa crossing through Belarus and Russia [[to]{.mark} the
borders of [**Poland** and **Finland**]{.mark}, [targeted **railway
infrastructure**]{.mark} in the Czech Republic and Sweden,
**[assassinated]{.mark}** a Russian military [defector]{.mark} in Spain,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} even plotted to assassinate the German [head
of a major European [arms manufacturer]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Kremlin's goal with these measures is to show European governments and
citizens that Russia can retaliate for their support for Kyiv.

Yet [once the war in Ukraine **ends**, Russia's efforts **won't
subside**. [Moscow's broader aim]{.mark} in pursuing these tactics [is
to **degrade** the West]{.mark} and its ability to counter
Russia]{.underline}. It wants to weaken Western societies, drive wedges
between the United States and Europe, reduce Europe's capacity for
collective action, and convince Europeans that it's not worth the
trouble to push back against Moscow. Part of its strategy is to use
nuclear intimidation, such as the [recent [changes to]{.mark} Russian
**[nuclear doctrine]{.mark}**]{.underline} that seem to [[lower]{.mark}
the [threshold for]{.mark} **nuclear [use]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to
heighten Western fears of confronting Russia.

Russia is not in a position to challenge NATO directly. The current
low-scale conflict with NATO countries is likely to persist until the
Russian military rebuilds---a process that could take years. But the
Kremlin will then be looking for opportunities to further undermine
NATO. Moscow will still have reason for caution, not least because it
considers the alliance to be a superior force, but it may be tempted if
it becomes clear that the allies---the United States the most important
among them---lack the resolve for collective defense. The Kremlin would
be most prone to make this calculation if the United States is engaged
in a major conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific, which Washington has
deemed its highest national security priority. [[Should]{.mark} the
[Kremlin **calculate**]{.mark}]{.underline} that Washington would not or
could not come to Europe's defense and that [[Europe]{.mark} **alone**
would [not]{.mark} be [capable of victory]{.mark}, then [Moscow]{.mark}
could **[target]{.mark}** a country on [NATO's eastern flank]{.mark},
**daring** NATO to respond]{.underline}.

The picture is further complicated by the Kremlin's propensity for both
risk-taking and miscalculation. Already, Moscow has seriously misjudged
its ability to rapidly defeat the Ukrainian military and to shake
Western resolve. Personalist autocrats such as Putin are the type of
leader most inclined to make mistakes, in part because they surround
themselves with yes men and loyalists who tell the leaders what they
want to hear. Washington and its allies should thus not sleep
comfortably even if NATO forces are well equipped to defeat the Russian
military. Having confidence that NATO would prevail in the end is not
enough, especially having observed what Ukraine is experiencing now:
cities destroyed, tens of thousands killed, millions made refugees, and
areas under prolonged Russian occupation. Even if Russia were defeated
today, a future war with Russia could be devastating for the country it
invades and for the NATO alliance. [The [**imperative** for]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} and NATO [[is to
make sure Moscow **never tries**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

AIDING AND ABETTING

The confrontation with Russia will remain most intense in Europe, but
the challenge from Moscow is global. [Although the **U**nited **S**tates
and Europe levied **significant** costs on Russia in the **aftermath**
of its invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has **circumvented** Western
sanctions and export controls and **defied** predictions of
international isolation]{.underline}. In October, Russia hosted the
annual summit of BRICS (whose first five members were Brazil, Russia,
India, China, and South Africa), with dozens of world leaders in
attendance, demonstrating a growing interest in the group's role as a
platform for challenging Western power and influence.

[T]{.underline}he more that Putin clashes with the United States and its
allies and is perceived to get away with it, the more other countries
will be emboldened to issue challenges of their own. [Russia's war in
[Ukraine]{.mark} is [exposing]{.mark} not only a [**gap**
between]{.mark} the [West's **rhetoric** and]{.mark} its **practical
[commitment]{.mark}** but [also]{.mark} the [**limits** of]{.mark}
Western **[military capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is not to say
that a seeming Russian success in Ukraine would automatically prompt
Chinese leader Xi Jinping to invade Taiwan; other factors, such as the
military balance of power in the region and political imperatives in
Beijing, will be more decisive in shaping Xi's calculus. Yet China is
taking notes, as are onlookers around the world. Would-be Western
adversaries are assessing the price of using force and considering what
they might expect were they to launch a similar gambit. Likewise, the
inadequate response to Russian sabotage in Europe might encourage other
potential foes to get in the game.

Not content to simply inspire, [[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} is also
actively aiding opponents of the West. Russia has lent support to rogue
actors across the Sahel region of Africa, dispensing materiel and
diplomatic backing that [**[enabled]{.mark}** military [officials
to]{.mark} forcibly [seize power in **Mali**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
2021, in **[[Burkina Faso]{.underline}]{.mark}** in 2022,
[and]{.underline} in **[[Niger]{.underline}]{.mark}** in 2023 and
subsequently curtail ties with the United States and Europe. [Russia
is]{.underline} also [[sending arms into **Sudan**]{.mark},
[prolonging]{.mark} the country's **[civil war]{.mark}** and the
resulting humanitarian crisis, [and]{.mark} has [lent support to]{.mark}
the **[Houthi]{.mark}** militia**[s]{.mark}** in Yemen]{.underline}, who
have attacked vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting global trade, and have
fired missiles at Israel, a close U.S. ally.

Although the consequences for the United States of any one of these
developments may be limited, in aggregate, Russia's actions are
magnifying the challenges facing Washington. In Niger, Russian support
eased the new government's decision to force the United States to
abandon a base it used to launch counterterrorism missions in the Sahel.
If Russia were to ramp up its support for the Houthis and provide them
with antiship missiles, the militant group would be better able to
strike commercial vessels in the Red Sea and raise the threat to the
U.S. and European warships defending them. Once the fighting in Ukraine
ends, Russia could devote significantly more resources and attention to
the Houthis and other groups or countries that threaten U.S. interests.

Some observers have held out hope that China's concern for its economic
interests will induce it to rein in Russia. But Beijing's actions so far
indicate no such effort. China did not object to Russia's support for
the Houthis, despite the risks to global shipping. Even if Beijing is
wary of Russia's deepening relations with North Korea, it is unlikely to
intervene, not least because it does not want to spoil its long-standing
relationship with Pyongyang. Instead, China seems content to let Russia
roil the international system and take advantage of the resulting
disorder to further its own rise. If there is to be any check on
Russia's destabilizing activities, then, it will have to come from the
West.

THE AXIS OF UPHEAVAL

Russia's effort to support China, Iran, and North Korea is among the
most pernicious problems posed by Moscow. Russia's war in Ukraine has
spurred a level of cooperation among those countries that few thought
was possible, and the Kremlin has operated as the critical catalyst. The
arrival of North Korean troops in Russia is a worrisome reminder that
with highly personalized authoritarian regimes at the helm in Russia and
North Korea and with the regimes in China and to a lesser extent Iran
moving in this direction, cooperation can evolve rapidly and in
unpredictable ways.

A body of political science research shows that this particular type of
regime tends to produce the most risky and aggressive foreign policies.
Countries with personalist authoritarians at the helm are the most
likely to initiate interstate conflicts, the most likely to fight wars
against democracies, and the most likely to invest in nuclear weapons.
Russia's growing military and political support for China, Iran, and
North Korea will only facilitate these tendencies. And Moscow, by now
having shed its concern with its international reputation, is likely to
become even less constrained in its willingness to aid even the most
odious of regimes.

Russian support for fellow members of this axis of upheaval, therefore,
could bring disorder to key regions. Take the Chinese-Russian
relationship. Although Moscow has supplied Beijing with arms for
years---including advanced fighter aircraft, air defense systems, and
antiship missiles---their defense ties have deepened at an alarming
rate. In September, for example, U.S. officials announced that Russia
had provided China with sophisticated technology that will make Chinese
submarines quieter and more difficult to track. Such an agreement was
hard to imagine just a few years ago, given the sensitive nature of the
technology. With Beijing and Moscow working together, the U.S. military
advantage over China could erode, making a potential conflict in the
Indo-Pacific more likely if China believes it has the upper hand.

Russia's support for Iran is similarly troubling. Moscow has long sent
tanks, helicopters, and surface-to-air missiles to Tehran, and it is now
supporting the Iranian space and missile programs. Since Russia's
intervention in Syria in 2015 to shore up the rule of President Bashar
al-Assad---joining Iran in that effort---Moscow and Tehran's increased
interaction has enabled them to overcome a historic distrust and build
the foundations of a deeper and more durable partnership. A decade ago,
Russia participated (if warily) in the international negotiations that
led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. But today, Moscow seems far less
interested in arms reduction or nonproliferation. As the wars in the
Middle East degrade Iran's proxies and expose the limits of its ability
to deter Israel, Tehran's interest in acquiring a nuclear weapon may
grow---and it may turn to Russia for help. That help could be overt,
with Moscow offering the expertise needed for weapon miniaturization,
for example, or it could be indirect, with Russia shielding Tehran from
UN action. Iran's acquisition of a nuclear weapon, in turn, could send
other countries in the region, such as Egypt or Saudi Arabia, scrambling
to nuclearize, effectively ending the current era of nonproliferation in
the Middle East.

In the case of North Korea, Russia's support raises the risk of
instability on the Korean Peninsula. According to South Korean
officials, Pyongyang has requested advanced Russian technologies to
improve the accuracy of its ballistic missiles and to expand the range
of its submarines in return for North Korea sending its troops,
ammunition, and other military support to Russia. And it is not just
advanced equipment that could make North Korea more able and, perhaps,
more willing to engage in a regional conflict. North Korean troops
deployed to Russia are now gaining valuable battlefield experience and
insight into modern conflict. Moscow and Pyongyang also signed a treaty
in November establishing a "comprehensive strategic partnership" and
calling on each side to come to the other's aid in case of an armed
attack---an agreement that could potentially bring Russia into a fight
between North Korea and South Korea.

It is tempting to imagine that if the United States presses Ukraine to
end the war and pursues a more pragmatic relationship with Russia,
Moscow's cooperation with members of this axis could lessen. Yet this is
wishful thinking. The growing ties among China, Iran, North Korea, and
Russia are driven by incentives far deeper than the transactional
considerations created by the war in Ukraine. If anything, concessions
made to Russia to end the war would only enhance the Kremlin's ability
to help its partners weaken the United States.

ORDER OF OPERATIONS

Russian ambitions may not stop at Ukraine, and [[in]{.mark} the
[**absence** of Western action]{.mark} today, the [costs of
resisting]{.mark} Russian [aggression will]{.mark} **only
[rise]{.mark}**. Russia is a declining power, but its potential to
**stir conflict** remains significant]{.underline}. Thus, [the
[**burden** of deterrence]{.mark} and defense against it is [not going
to **lighten**]{.mark} in the]{.underline} near term. And because
changes to defense spending, procurement, and force posture require
significant lead times, Washington and its allies must think beyond the
current war in Ukraine and start making investments now to prevent
Russian opportunistic aggression later on. Europe must channel its
rising defense spending into expanding the organizational capacity and
logistical support necessary to make independent action possible if the
U.S. military is engaged elsewhere. Giving in to Russia's demands will
not make it any easier or cheaper to defend Europe---just look at the
events of the past two decades. At every turn---the war in Georgia in
2008, Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and its deployment of
troops to Syria in 2015---Putin has grown only more willing to take
risks as he comes to believe that doing so pays off.

Washington undoubtedly has competing priorities that will shift its
focus away from the Russian threat---China foremost among them. But to
effectively address China, Washington must first set European security
on the right path. The United States cannot simply hand off European
security to a Europe that is not yet capable of managing the Russian
threat. If Washington downsized its commitment to Europe prematurely,
Moscow could take it as a sign of growing U.S. disinterest and use the
opportunity to press ahead.

The prioritization of U.S. policies is important, but so is the
sequencing. The Trump administration will first have to manage the war
in Ukraine. Helping Ukraine achieve an end to the war on favorable terms
is the clearest way to reduce the threat of aggression from Russia and
the axis of upheaval that supports it. This agreement would need to be
embedded in a larger strategy to contain Russia and preserve Ukrainian
security. NATO should do away with the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act,
which prohibits permanent deployments of allied forces near Russia, and
station troops on NATO's eastern flank. The alliance should also raise
its members' defense spending targets, increase its readiness, and
improve its ability to deploy forces to defend threatened member states.
Western countries should maintain and better enforce sanctions and
export controls on Russia for at least as long as Putin remains in
power. Western countries must also invest in Ukraine's defense sector
and ensure that Ukraine can sustain its own armed forces to deter Russia
from invading again. Although these measures would not end the
confrontation with Russia, they would blunt Moscow's ambitions and its
capacity to both stir conflict in Europe and strengthen its partners in
other parts of the world.

The Trump administration must also preserve the United States' role as
the primary enabler of European security while working to reduce the
burden of its maintenance. European states must become more capable of
collective action that does not require U.S. aid. They may still rely on
the United States in some circumstances, but the extent of their
dependence can be significantly reduced. Over time, the United States
will become freer to focus on China as it shifts more defense
responsibilities to Europe. And in the meantime, it will avoid an overly
hasty, chaotic pivot that would only encourage and embolden Moscow and
could result in Russia eventually launching a reckless war, either
against NATO or once again against Ukraine.

[There is **no** easy resolution to the West's **confrontation** with
Russia. [Russian **revisionism**]{.mark} and aggression are [**not**
going]{.mark} away]{.underline}. Even if the current war in Ukraine is
settled via an armistice, without some kind of security guarantee for
Ukraine, [[another war is **likely**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Ignoring
Russia]{.mark} or assuming that it can be **easily
managed**]{.underline} as the United States turns its attention to China
[would only [allow]{.mark} the [threat to **grow**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It would be far better for the United States and its allies to take the
challenge from Russia seriously today than to let another conflict
become a more costly proposition tomorrow.

[of [**word embedding** with]{.mark}]{.underline} a naïve [[**time
series model** to look at]{.underline}]{.mark} the relative changing
meaning of a compound word like "world order" in a modest [corpus of
**[political speeches]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Specifically, I cut the
corpus into chronological time slices and modeled each slice separately.
Finally, I analysed how these strategies have evolved over time and vary
across individuals.

This [paper's substantive contribution is,]{.underline} first, [showing
that the [post-Cold War **trend** in increasing contestations]{.mark}
toward the LIO [in Russian discourse]{.mark} has been **accompanied** by
increasing **intensity** in the expression of ideological positions.
This **[new rhetoric]{.mark}** about Russia and the world order is [more
**negative** toward Western countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. In line with
this key idea, I find that **[[revisionist
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [Eurasianism and Security
Concerns]{.underline} -- as well as the traditionalist strategy of
Westphalianism, [have been **[increasing]{.mark}** over time in general,
while **[Multipolarity]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- which initially stemmed
from a more pragmatic attitude toward global affairs -- [has been
**[decreasing]{.mark}** in the last]{.underline} presidential [term
of]{.underline} Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}. The steep increase in the
other three positions appears to be related to the 2012 re-election of
Putin and the related introduction of a conservative and
civilisationalist narrative in the Kremlin. [When it became **clear**
that integrating into the Atlantic block as an equal
partner]{.underline} and a great European power [would be
**impossible**, [Russia switched to]{.mark}]{.underline} another mode of
multipolarity or polycentricity by [[**emphasising** Russia as]{.mark} a
Eurasian power and an influential [**centre** of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} (a [civilisation extending **beyond** its
borders]{.underline}) and following plans of cooperation in the
frameworks of the BRICS countries. At the same time, though Russia's
outlook became more negative towards Western domination of the world
order, the Kremlin did not abandon its expressed positive engagement
with the rest of the world by raising the voice for a multipolar (still
reactionary) world order. Finally, although we cannot speak about the
diffusion of a coherent conservative ideology but rather of diffuse
conservative ideas, [these trends show that the [**balance**
between]{.mark} Russia's **[pragmatic]{.mark}** strategic [interests
and]{.mark} its more [**ideologically loaded** constructs]{.mark} now
seems to have been **[lost]{.mark}**]{.underline}: a sign of the ascent
of an increasingly rigid ideology in the Kremlin (Laruelle/Grek 2022).

Second, based on previous studies regarding the attractiveness of
illiberal state soft power, I [applied a **[matrix]{.mark}** that
[combines **posture**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([revisionist vs
traditionalist]{.underline}) [[and source]{.underline}]{.mark} (ideas vs
interests) [of LIO contestants to **visualise** several types of
contestation strategies]{.underline}. As previous works have shown
(Börzel/Zürn 2021; Varga/Buzogány 2021), [this matrix
**[encourages]{.mark}** an [engagement with]{.mark} the [**multilayered
nature** of]{.mark} the concept of [LIO
contestation]{.mark}]{.underline} in general and of illiberalism in
particular. Moreover, the initial descriptive results set the stage for
further empirical studies. Notably, [[Russia **continues** to
identify]{.mark} itself [as]{.mark} a cultural [**beacon** for]{.mark}
contesting and [**challenging** LIO]{.mark}]{.underline}. Due to this
greater confluence with conservative attitudes on the rise in the West
and the Global South, Russia takes advantage of these new voices,
consorts with them, and often tries to amplify them. This work could go
beyond the case of Russia by applying this two-dimensional matrix to
conceptualise LIO contestation strategies of other illiberal actors and
their discourse. This study aims to further expand this methodology to
other cases that could respond to two questions: 1) to what extent does
rhetoric of different illiberal actors diverge or intersect? and 2)
which, if any, rhetorical patterns help constitute an illiberal
discourse? Such comparison would be helpful to understand whether there
is a central core in illiberal discourse and, therefore, whether we can
talk about an "illiberal international" world order.

### Condemning the West is Bad

#### Condemning 'The West' embraces a [racist colonial logic]{.underline} that assumes Eastern Europeans are 'backwards' and 'not able to understand' [their own history]{.underline}. Instead, [embrace]{.underline} local knowledge and [unequivocally reject]{.underline} Russian chauvinism.

Sadly, [I experience the [**continuity** of colonial]{.mark}
hierarchical [thinking]{.mark}, [instead of]{.mark} any **real**
[acknowledgments of]{.mark} the insider's [experience]{.mark} and
expertise]{.underline}. Moreover, [the [Russian war]{.mark}]{.underline}
in Ukraine [**[sharpens]{.mark}** these [ruptures]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[deepens]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[divisions]{.mark} in academia,
and [makes]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[hierarchies]{.underline}]{.mark}
in academia **[[more explicit]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Darya
Tsymbaliuk, an anthropologist from Ukraine working in the UK, writes,
the invasion of Ukraine causes academics "to question the epistemic
authority of scholarly knowledge production, when it keeps a safe
distance from the wreck of reality" (Tsymbalyuk 2022). Thus,
[[analysis]{.mark} is [**surrendered** to]{.mark} a [facile]{.mark}
"**[westplaining]{.mark}**".]{.underline}

"[Westplaining]{.underline}" seems to have replaced Said's notion of
orientalism (Kazharski 2022), particularly in reaction to commentary on
Ukraine by established Western intellectuals --- be they German
intellectuals (Krieg in der Ukraine 2022), American realists (Walt 2022)
or cultural anthropologists and historians (Harvey 2022; Kalb 2022a,
2022b; Fitzpatrick 2022) --- [that [reveal]{.mark} a
**[patronising]{.mark}** and **privileged** [position]{.mark} when
[express]{.mark}ing their opinions and [claims about]{.mark}
"**[backward]{.mark}**" [Eastern Europeans]{.mark} who are [not]{.mark}
"**[able]{.mark}**" [to understand]{.mark} the situation in [their
countries]{.mark} and [**lack** basic knowledge about their
**region**]{.mark}. It can [also mean **perceiving**]{.mark} the [world
exclusively]{.mark} "**[through]{.mark}**" and "**by**" [the
West]{.mark}. The [latter]{.mark} can be [seen]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
example, [[in]{.mark} the [**facile accusation** against]{.mark} the
[US]{.mark}A and NATO [of **seeking** the]{.mark} Russian
[invasion]{.mark}]{.underline} (Artiukh 2022a).

Many "**[[local]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[scholars]{.mark} from
Central-Eastern Europe]{.underline}, as well as some of their Western
colleagues, tend to [[find such commentary]{.mark} **useless** and even
**[harmful]{.mark}**, as it [introduces **false assumptions**]{.mark}
and projections into **public opinion** and media coverage]{.underline}.
In doing so, "[[westplaining]{.underline}]{.mark}"
[**[strengthens]{.mark}** existing [boundaries]{.mark} in academia and
creates new ones]{.underline}. Taras [Bilous]{.underline}, the editor of
the left-wing Ukrainian magazine "Commons" wrote a "letter to the left
in the West" shortly after the war began, on 25 February, when Kyiv was
under Russian siege. In his piece, he **[criticised]{.underline}** the
[fact that [**actual people** in Eastern Europe]{.mark} and their
political ideas]{.underline} --- [[as well as]{.mark} **aggressive**
[Russian]{.mark} imperial [chauvinism]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [**[do
not]{.mark}** seem to [exist for **left-wing intellectuals** in the
West]{.mark}, who are [instead **obsessed** with]{.mark} "**[NATO
imperialism]{.mark}**".]{.underline} He wrote, "[a [large part
of]{.mark} the [**Western Left** should]{.mark} honestly [admit]{.mark}
that [it **completely fucked up** in]{.mark} formulating [its response
to]{.mark} the '**[Ukrainian crisis]{.mark}**'"]{.underline} (Bilous
2022). There has also been a considerable critical response from
Ukrainian sociologist Oksana Dutchak (2022), anthropologists from
Ukraine Volodymyr Artiukh (2022b) and Taras Fedirko (2022), both
currently living in the UK, Polish journalists and publicists (Troost
2022; Smoleński, Dutkiewicz 2022) who also condemn the false logic of
"westplaining" Ukraine.

[[However]{.mark}, **[what]{.mark}** kind of

**unarticulated**]{.underline}]{.mark}, even by Hann himself. The
"**[[Russian perspective]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [we hear from Russian

"RIA Novosti" [published a piece]{.underline} written by pro-Kremlin
analyst Timofei Sergeitsev, entitled "What Russia should do with
Ukraine", in which one finds justification for the war by
[[call]{.mark}ing [for]{.mark} the [**destruction** of]{.mark} the
[Ukrainian identity, language, state and people]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Sergeitsev even claims that the word "Ukraine" is synonymous with Nazism
and should not be allowed to exist, therefore the entire Ukrainian
people and the country should be erased.13 [There are **no illusions**:
[Russia **does** speak]{.mark}; its "[perspective]{.mark}" [is]{.mark}

**[[kidnapping]{.underline}]{.mark}** children, stealing, [[and]{.mark}

Unfortunately, [this]{.underline} "[Russian perspective]{.underline}" is

[**absent** from other essays by Western intellectuals and scholars

(Fitzpatrick 2022). A response has been written by Ukrainian historian
Vitalii Mykhailovskyi, refuting such concerns (Mykhailovskyi 2022).
However, despite their existence, voices and insider perspectives from
Ukraine are still marginal on a global scale (see in particular

## A2 Diplomacy CP

### Solvency Deficit -- Russia Won't Cooperate

#### Negotiations fail -- Russia will be disingenuous 

**Dalziel 24** \[Alexander, senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier
Institute in Ottawa, "Russia's Tough Talk on Arctic Sovereignty Must Be
Taken Seriously,"
<https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/russias-tough-talk-on-arctic-sovereignty-must-be-taken-seriously/>,
ALB\]

So, what about Russia? **[There is good reason to think that Russia will
be less than an amicable negotiator]{.underline}** [and not leave it to
the diplomats alone]{.underline}.

Here [it is important to look at what the Russian leadership is
saying]{.underline} on the matter. Useful resources are its main
strategic documents, released over the last four years. [The 2023
Foreign Policy Concept, the 2023 amendments to the 2020 Arctic Strategy,
the 2022 Maritime Doctrine and the 2021 National Security Strategy
reveal that Russia indeed thinks that it has a lot at
stake]{.underline}. Canada, Denmark and the United States should take
these seriously and prepare accordingly.

To start, [these documents make clear that the Arctic Ocean and its
continental shelves are an integral part of Russia's geopolitics and
prosperity. The Russian position is committed to exercising an extended
jurisdiction on the Arctic Ocean's continental shelf.]{.underline}
Significantly, the National Security Strategy identifies the military's
defense of the continental shelf as a priority, a "goal of state
security," which dovetails with the document's emphasis on resource
exploitation rights as a function of national security and the general
priority of the Arctic region in this regard.

The Maritime Doctrine lists the Arctic as the top priority of maritime
strategy and is outspoken on Russian interests beyond its exclusive
economic zone to the continental shelf and the delimitation of maritime
boundaries under international law. The Foreign Policy Concept says that
Russia will "step up" (Russian: активизации) the delineating of these
borders in a region it identifies as the second most important after the
countries of central Asia and eastern Europe, and what it calls the
"near abroad."

These statements fit into a process of geopolitical transformation
Russia is trying to undertake to turn into a coastal Eurasian power,
defined as much by its northern maritime edge as its terrestrial land
mass. While the Arctic has long been touted as central to Russian
identity, global warming is opening sea lanes that also conveniently
enable Russia's pivot to Asia, accelerated by the precarious relations
with Europe.

[This vision of Arctic coastal Russia is closely tied to its prosperity
agenda]{.underline}. The region had already been an important part of
economic planning. Now it is coming to be seen as the linchpin of future
economic development. The Maritime Doctrine describes the Arctic Ocean
as the only "vital" ocean to national interests, with its socio-economic
development a "decisive condition" for future prosperity. Seabed
resources on the continental shelf, it claims, are "predetermined" to be
essential to alleviating depleted terrestrial deposits (itself a
questionable claim).

[Into this mix the strategies assess a sharply competitive, sometimes
violent international context, including in the Arctic]{.underline}.
[The strategic documents describe the other Arctic countries as
exhibiting varying degrees of hostility to Russia]{.underline}. The
Foreign Policy Concept (Section 50.2, for instance), [accuses the other
Arctic countries of "militarizing" the region --- conveniently ignoring
Russia's own steady modernization of its armed forces in its
north.]{.underline}

[Russia then goes on to state it will "counteract unfriendly states' ...
militarization of the region." The United States and its allies are
pursuing an explicit "containment" strategy and trying to limit its
access to the oceanic resources, according to the Maritime Doctrine; it
goes on to say the Arctic is a place of "strategic
competition]{.underline}." According to the National Security Strategy,
Russia's Arctic development is being "obstructed" (a reference to
sanctions on oil and gas projects). The disparaging epithet of
"Anglo-Saxon" is hurled in Canada's general direction in the Foreign
Policy Concept as one of the United States' henchmen.

[The updated Russian Arctic Strategy introduces ambiguity into this
overall depiction]{.underline}. It has retained an earlier description
of the other Arctic states as "challenges" (Russian: вызовы) and did not
elevate them to threats (Russian: угрозы). While it did deprioritize the
relations with the other Arctic states from the 2020 document and
replace them with bilateral, case-by-case relations with any states, the
retention of the "challenge" language is almost certainly not an
oversight and optimistically might be seen to represent something of an
underlying offer to the Arctic community in the case of improved
relations, against the hyperbolic accusations of militarization and
Anglo-Saxonism in the other strategies. (A workable hypothesis here is
that Russia's long-term concerns in the Arctic include managing a
potentially overreaching China, for which having Arctic partners would
be decidedly beneficial for Moscow.)

The Arctic Trilemma: The United States' Way Forward

[Given the regional and strategic complexities outlined above, what
should the U.S. policy be, and why]{.underline}? To recall, the Arctic
trilemma has three legs: access to the TSR, a greater U.S. military
presence in the region, and stability and cooperation vis-a-vis Russia.
One may consider each side of the trilemma. First, [if the U.S. wants
free economic access to the TSR but wants to avoid a hostile economic
environment by cooperating with Russian interests]{.underline} , it must
sacrifice establishing a greater military presence in the region.
[Russia will not unconditionally cooperate and promote an uncontested
peace if the U.S. military challenges their positions in the
region]{.underline}. Putin's invasion of Ukraine provides telling
evidence: [the authoritarian has asserted that he can and will respond
forcefully to perceived U.S.and NATO threats to Russian
sovereignty]{.underline}. As a result, **[the U.S. would have to concede
to Russian oversight to ensure cooperation and economic access, a
position which Washington should -- and would -- never
accept]{.underline}**.

Figure 2: The Arctic Trilemma for the United States

Alternatively, [the U.S. can have primary access to the TSR and advance
military objectives in the region , but sacrifice cooperation with
Russia and prompt Great Power Competition in the Arctic]{.underline}.
[The Russians already have an entrenched military presence in the Arctic
and can leverage its assets to dominate the TSR if they are
uncontested]{.underline}. Thus, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must cultivate a formidable military force in the
region to ensure that U.S.companies can utilize the TSR to their maximum
economic advantage]{.underline}. Open sea lanes would have to be secured
through U.S. and Allied sea control. The competition to be the economic
hegemon of the TSR makes any opportunity for joint efforts toward mutual
prosperity unlikely and military steadfastness a necessity.

[Lastly, the U.S. can maintain peace and project a strong military
footprint but suffer from suboptimal access to the TSR. The political
climate of the Arctic would resemble a Cold War-esque gridlock due to
military build-up by both nations and potentially others who wish to
enter the mix. The militarization of the Arctic would sacrifice the
greater economic gains both sides could have achieved through a
demilitarized strait]{.underline}..

[Within this trilemma, the U.S. must secure access to the TSR and
establish a strong military presence in the Arctic, embracing great
power competition]{.underline}. **[Given Putin's militarism and
completely shattered relations with the West post-February 2022,
Washington should not pursue cooperation]{.underline}**. [To secure
U.S.economic interests in the TSR in the 2040s is to ensure no adversary
will threaten U.S. ships. Naval theorist Alfred Thayer Mahan argued that
securing access to the high seas for trade and commerce is crucial for a
nation. Sea lines like the TSR are the economic arteries of Great
Powers. They sustain economic life]{.underline}. And [they are too
important to be left under adversarial control]{.underline}. **[The U.S.
must command the Arctic sea, like it has commanded the Pacific and other
oceans for the better part of half a century.]{.underline}**

Abstract

[After February 2022]{.underline}, [it seemed that a breakdown
of]{.underline} political, economic and scientific [cooperation in the
Arctic would be one of the many examples of collateral damage from
Russia\'s war]{.underline} of aggression [in Ukraine]{.underline}. [Two
years on]{.underline} from the invasion, however, [the Arctic 7 (the
United States, Canada and the Nordic countries) have renewed their
engagement with Russia on polar issues.]{.underline} [The Arctic Council
has emerged as the exceptional case of a regional body in which Russia
and NATO nations continue to collaborate]{.underline}, albeit at a more
limited level through the working groups.This article examines the
dilemmas facing the Arctic 7 as they seek to balance a values-based
policy and strong stance against Russia in solidarity with Ukraine, with
a desire to ensure the continuing survival of the Arctic Council and its
primacy in regional governance. **[We argue that Russia has sought to
weaponize the Council---withholding vital climate data and threatening
to bring China further into regional politics---as part of a wider
strategy of coercive diplomacy and hybrid threats in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. **[The Arctic 7 should recognize that they
ultimately stand to lose more from giving into Russian tactics than from
freezing Moscow out of the Arctic Council while the war in Ukraine
continues]{.underline}**.

### Solvency Deficit -- Arctic Council

#### Including military matters at the Arctic [causes]{.underline} conflict

[The predominant view]{.underline} of practitioners [is that including
military issues in the Arctic Council's deliberations could
be]{.underline} seen as [violating the forum's inherent stated
principles and could undermine its mandated focus]{.underline}.\[x**[\]
Furthermore, the inclusion of military issues could
exacerbate]{.underline}** existing **[tensions]{.underline}** and
mistrust **[among certain member states, especially given]{.underline}**
the ongoing **[geopolitical tensions between Russia and the A7 members
of the Arctic Council]{.underline}**.\[xi\] **[There are]{.underline}**
also **[concerns that the militarization of the Arctic Council could
escalate regional tensions and contribute to a future security dilemma,
where nations increase their military capabilities in response to
perceived threats from others.\[xii\] This could potentially lead to an
arms race and heighten the risk of conflicts, undermining the Arctic
Council\'s goal of promoting peace and stability in the
Arctic]{.underline}**.

1\. Maintain the Arctic Council\'s Scope on non-military issues:

[The Arctic Council has to retain its non-military focus to maintain its
future and current effectiveness in response to multilateral
non-military issues]{.underline}. [It is critical the Arctic Council
does not discuss military]{.underline} [issues as it]{.underline} [can
continue to play a vital role in establishing mutual
collaboration]{.underline} and debate among the states and indigenous
populations [on shared concerns such as environmental protection,
sustainable development, or scientific research]{.underline}. The Arctic
Council's inclusion of Russia as a member-state allows the council to
remain a potential diplomatic forum if there is to be a re-engagement of
Russia on Arctic issues in the future.

### Perm Do Both

#### Perm do both - Russia will circumvent just the counterplan-- only having the tools the plan gives makes negotiations successful

**Dalziel 24** \[Alexander, senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier
Institute in Ottawa, "Russia's Tough Talk on Arctic Sovereignty Must Be
Taken Seriously,"
<https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/russias-tough-talk-on-arctic-sovereignty-must-be-taken-seriously/>,
ALB\]

[So, will Russia leave the resolution of any disputes over the
continental shelves purely to international law]{.underline}? In the
Foreign Policy Concept, Russia reaffirms the "special responsibility of
the Arctic states" regarding the Law of the Sea, with a specific
reference to maritime delimitation" and sustainable development. It
clearly has not abandoned international law.

But [Putin and his regime see international law differently from the
other (liberal and democratic) Arctic states. They import into their
claims about international law the array of deeply cynical assumptions
about how the world works, captured in the Foreign Policy Concept's
acknowledgement of the "power factor" in current international
relations; diplomacy, it contends, is of decreasing
effectiveness]{.underline}.

Cynicism, though, does not exclude sincerity. For Russia, international
law is an instrument. The starting point from any consideration of the
question in Copenhagen, Nuuk, Ottawa and Washington must be Russia's
flagrant dismissal of international law by its invasion of Ukraine.
Russia is not a country defined by its strict adherence to legality.

[Expressing this, the subordination of international law to the national
interest is a theme running through the strategic
documents]{.underline}. The Foreign Policy Concept declares that
delimiting the continental shelf will be done in accordance with
international law but "unconditionally" in line with its "national
interests" and "sovereign rights;" the amended 2023 Arctic strategy
added new language foregrounding national interests.

In addition, [doubts about the efficacy of international law pervade
these documents. The Arctic Strategy and Maritime Doctrine both speak of
a group of unspecified countries, presumably Arctic ones, seeking to
revise international agreements along national legislative lines. These
statements exhibit the leadership's tendency to use international law
instrumentality and see it as malleable to the interests of the "great
powers]{.underline}." They have culminated recently in talk (unlikely to
be fulfilled) in Russia about leaving the Law of the Sea entirely.

In short, international law is generated by centers of global power and
smaller countries expressing their interests, and balancing them in
accordance with power. What the Kremlin is offering when it talks of
international law is a framework for discussing national interests, but
justice here is not an equally accessible good, instead something that
will be decided by the powerful. This is something for Canada and
Denmark, in particular, to be attentive to in Arctic matters.

**[As a consequence, preparedness should be made for a Russia acting
superficially in line with international law but covertly seeking to
advance its position]{.underline}**. The likelihood that Russia will
come to open blows over the Arctic is low, but [the main threat is not
open aggression.]{.underline}

[It is to the asymmetric "grey zone" of deniable "hybrid" tools that we
should be looking]{.underline}. [The strategic documents fully
acknowledge the use of force in international affairs, below and above
the threshold of open warfare]{.underline}. [Notably, in the Foreign
Policy Concept it asserts that Russia is the target of a hybrid warfare
campaign conducted by the United States and its allies, and the National
Security Strategy and Maritime Doctrine provide additional enabling
language for asymmetric responses. Reciprocity is a premise of Russian
international conduct. These statements provide a clear justification
for its use of so-called hybrid or grey zone coercion to achieve policy
ends. If it perceives its negotiating position has deteriorated, Russia
will be ready to deploy a range of tools, likely to include deniable,
coercive ones, below the threshold of open aggression to strengthen its
bargaining position]{.underline}.

**[The strategic documents make clear that Russia is already trying to
shape the negotiation space in the Arctic Ocean. If Russia's relations
with its Arctic neighbors remain on the same fraught footing that they
are now --- a near certainty with another six years of Putin about to
start this spring --- then it will agitate for maximalist outcomes in
obtaining its "sovereign rights" in the Arctic Ocean.]{.underline}**

Russian claims are unlikely to extend past what they have stated they
want. That does not mean that the coercive "grey zone" will not be an
active front in maneuvering for a Russia-optimal settlement or that
Canadian and Danish or (by extension) U.S. interests are not at risk.

[These three countries need to think about this and start to act now.
**Acquiring the capabilities that will keep Russia honest at the
negotiating table, like icebreakers, submarines, subsea sensors and
patrol aircraft,** and the infrastructure to support them, takes
years]{.underline}. **[Negotiations in a decades-long time frame will be
advanced by establishing a situational awareness that needs to start
being built today]{.underline}**.

[The timelines are long, and we can hope for a different Russia in the
next decade or two. But hope, as is often quipped, is not a policy.
Canadian, Danish, Greenlandic and U.S. leaders may well face in a
decade's time in the Arctic the same aggressive, uncooperative, and bad
faith Russia that we face today in Ukraine. Ensuring we are prepared for
hardball hybrid behavior from Russia in the Arctic is a matter for
today, so we can be ready tomorrow]{.underline}.

[Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine effectively cut Western financial and
diplomatic ties in the Arctic region. Even long-standing cooperation
through the Arctic Council came to a halt during Russia's
Chairmanship]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [Russia depends heavily on
developing its Arctic zone's abundant natural resources to sustain
economic growth]{.underline}. With Western partnerships now out of
reach, Russia has turned to China to fill the looming gap in the Arctic.
Under the "no-limits" friendship declared between Chinese President Xi
Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two nations have
intensified their cooperation in the region.
