# Military Neg -- Cal Starter Pack

## Notes

This is the case negative against the military aff. You should also be
reading the off case positions (Das, Ks, CPs) in addition to these case
neg arguments.

I tried to generally include a lot of Arctic specific evidence in both
case defense and offense. There are two case turns -- the warming turn
and the missile defense bad turn. The warming turn argues that increased
military activity in the Arctic will lead to more global warming because
the military is very environmentally damaging. This is especially a
problem because the Arctic is a very fragile environment.

The missile defense turn basically just says that instead of the aff's
approach ("missile defeat") preventing conflict it CAUSES conflict
because a) other countries see the systems as a threat so they also
develop new stuff and b) it makes the U.S. reckless in conflict because
they think their enemies can't effectively retaliate.

The counterplan tests the thesis of the aff. Instead of saying we should
beef with Russia militarily, it says we should cooperate instead. It
also proposes that the Arctic Council (a governing body in the Arctic)
cooperates on military issues.

The case turns and the disadvantages produced by the camp are all net
benefits to the counterplan.

## A2 Conflict Adv

### 1NC No Arctic/Russia War

**No war with Russia over the Arctic -- their own solvency advocate
concludes**

Three Issues Related to Arctic Change Are Often Misunderstood

[Recognizing the security issues laid out above is imperative. However,
to enhance U.S. security in the Arctic, it is also imperative for U.S.
policymakers to be aware of what is not happening in the
region]{.underline}. In this vein, I next highlight three factors
related to changes underway in the Arctic that are often misunderstood,
misrepresented, and/or misinterpreted: (1) how climate change is
affecting physical accessibility, (2) the imminence of conflict for
contested resources, and (3) the ability of global geopolitical issues
to spill over to regional security matters.

First, regarding physical accessibility, physical changes are not
uniformly easing mobility challenges for those living in the Arctic and
for people coming in from lower latitudes. In many cases, the opposite
is actually true: The rapid diminishment of multi-year sea ice in most
areas is increasing the ability of non-icebreaking vessels to operate in
the Arctic Ocean during some times of the year. However, this ice loss
is uneven across the region; some areas near Russia and Alaska are more
accessible than others. Loss of multi-year ice also does not imply safe
conditions for transit and other economic activities (e.g., resource
extraction, fishing); in fact, the unpredictability of sea ice could
make some journeys more hazardous, especially to vessels without the
appropriate fortifications and experienced crews. Furthermore, the same
drivers of more ocean accessibility are also causing many coastal and
inland areas to become less accessible due to permafrost melt, the
shortening of ice road seasons, and erosion, among other factors.

Second, [[no evidence]{.mark} yet [exists of]{.mark} a resource race or
of [impending resource wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. [All Arctic land falls
clearly under the jurisdiction of one of the eight Arctic states, and
[there are increasingly fewer land-based]{.mark} territorial
[disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Claims for extended continental shelf
rights, which the United States cannot submit due to the fact that it
did not ratify the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,
follow internationally agreed on processe]{.underline}s. Although the
legal status of both the Northwest Passage along the Canadian coast and
the Northern Sea Route (NSR) or Northeast Passage along the Russian
coast are certainly disputed in a legal sense, the volume of any
international shipping through such routes over the coming years is
likely to be at a degree much, much smaller than elsewhere in the
world---if it exists---leaving the legal status of these routes as
important in principle but not practically relevant from an economic
standpoint for decades to come. This being said, the NSR will remain
critical for the shipping of Russian resources to global markets,
especially to Asia, which is a different matter economically (though not
legally) than using the route as a shortcut from Europe to Asia and vice
versa.

Moving from international to regional focus, there are continuing
important discussions about the early integration of rights-holders such
as Alaska Native groups into the decisionmaking process, along with such
concepts as shared benefits and risks and free, prior, and informed
consent regarding resource-extraction projects. Although the U.S.
government took an important and high-impact step with the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act,5 for example, work on inclusion and securing
futures for local communities continues to be important across the
Arctic region. The work is not yet done.

[Third, with respect to the possibility of global geopolitical issues
spilling over to regional security matters]{.underline}, [it is true
that dialogue between Russia, China, the United States, and other
Western countries has deteriorated as a result of the war in Ukraine and
tensions in the South China Sea and over Taiwan]{.underline}. Yet [my
experience suggests that these [tensions have not directly affected
Arctic security]{.mark}]{.underline}, [other than the associated
difficulties in maintaining dialogue across the board]{.underline}.
Overall, [[the Arctic region has remained]{.mark} relatively [stable
i]{.mark}n this uncertain global security environment]{.underline}.
Regarding Arctic dialogue and cooperation between Russia and the other
seven Arctic states, I do not foresee a return to the "business as
usual" model that pre-dated the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
However, [among other things, with the restarting of Arctic Council
activities and in the context of the day-to-day stewardship of border
areas, I observe evidence that [there has not been a systemic breakdown
in regional security.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[This makes me]{.mark}
cautiously [optimistic]{.mark} [that Arctic stakeholders can continue to
seek opportunities for constructive,]{.mark} collective
[dialogue]{.mark} about the region's future]{.underline}.

### 2NC No Arctic/Russia War

**Their author's summary to Congress [minimizes]{.underline} the threats
in the Arctic -- no war**

**Tingstad 23** \[Abbie, visiting professor of Arctic research at the
Center for Arctic Study and Policy, U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Scott
Savitz, Senior Engineer and Professor of Policy Analysis, RAND School of
Public Policy, "Enhancing Security in a Changing Environment," Testimony

<https://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CTA3097-1.html>, ALB\]

Second, the U.S. armed services will be challenged in the Arctic by
foreign military and commercial activities. The Arctic has become
increasingly visible globally through climate change and expectations of
regional economic potential, which may also make the region more
vulnerable to the spillover of geopolitical tensions or even armed
conflict. U.S. armed forces will likely increasingly contend with
strategic competition in this region to promote U.S. interests and
support allies and partners. [However, we did not assess that the Arctic
would see an independent conflict caused by tensions arising over
regional economic or other issues]{.underline}

In addition, U.S. armed forces---especially the USCG, because of its
particular statutory missions that include law-enforcement roles---will
need to monitor the growth in regional commercial activities, both licit
and illicit. The most pressing area will be in continuing to monitor and
manage fisheries, especially anticipated growth in illegal, unreported,
and unregulated fishing as global demand for protein increases,
fisheries respond to a warming climate, and Indigenous groups in some
areas gain more political and economic autonomy. Growth in tourism,
especially ecotourism, will increase demand for SAR and environmental
response, as well as for customs and border protection.

Third, potential security risks to USCG forces are largely driven by
U.S. capacity and capability issues. Limitations on U.S. capacity and
capability to scale up for enduring regional presence contribute to
three types of issues:

First, there are scenarios in which the USCG, more generally, would find
it difficult to perform self-protection and self-rescue regardless of
the reason (e.g., military threat, lawenforcement problem, natural
hazard) for the need.

Second, these limitations set the conditions for developing a security
void in parts of the North American Arctic. Limited domain awareness,
the inability to quickly communicate relevant information, and a lack of
presence to proactively manage problems place USCG forces at a starting
disadvantage before a bad actor ever makes a move.

Third, these same challenges affect the ability of the USCG and other
U.S. armed forces to respond to emerging situations (including NATO
defense) elsewhere in the Far North.

[The United States has been fortunate that the overall security risks in
the Arctic region have historically been limited. In the future, these
risks will be likely to remain less severe than those in other parts of
the United States and the world in which the USCG and other armed forces
operate. In other words, the so-called pacing threat in the Arctic is
not an external set of bad actors like it is elsewhere]{.underline}. The
United States itself is placing the USCG and its armed forces in a
difficult position in the Arctic by necessitating presence through
overarching strategies and plans without providing the appropriate
capabilities in sufficient capacities to perform these missions to the
same level of success as they would be if performed elsewhere in the
United States and in the world.

### 1NC No Global Warming Magnifier

#### Global warming doesn't magnify the warming threat -- it HURTS Russia

[No notable power shifts are indeed registered in the High
North]{.underline}, but [it happens to be the region where]{.underline}
President Donald [Trump's ambitions]{.underline} for grandeur
[meet]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin's aspirations to assert
Russia's position of power]{.underline} -- and exacerbate European
worries about US disengagement from the collective security
arrangements.

[Neither of these drivers can stand a Realpolitik test of strict
examination of national interests]{.underline}. But, [in real
policy-making]{.underline}, [emotions and delusions]{.underline} often
[matter more than rigorous calculations of costs and
benefits]{.underline}.

Climate change

[One often invoked reason for rising geopolitical competition is climate
change]{.underline}, and [the Arctic ice is indeed
retreating]{.underline}, [albeit not as fast as typically
perceived]{.underline}. The summer minimum was registered in 2012, and
it is theoretically possible that the mark of 3.39 million square
kilometres may be altered this year, since the winter maximum is the
lowest on the record.

[Russian scientists have]{.underline}, nevertheless, [recently reported
to Putin that navigation in the Northern Seas will not be any easier by
2050]{.underline}, so the fleet of icebreakers needs to be modernized.
The delays and cost-overruns with the construction in the Vladivostok
shipyard of a new nuclear Leader-class icebreaker are, therefore, more
than a little unfortunate.

[An even greater problem for Russia is the melting permafrost, which
causes deformations in the energy infrastructure in Siberia.
International scientific cooperation on this phenomenon has been badly
affected by Russia's aggression against Ukraine, so the data on the
volumes of methane released into the atmosphere is rather
approximate.]{.underline}

### 1NC A2 Russian Build-Up

#### There is [no rising threat]{.underline} to counter -- Ukraine proves

ALB\]

Northern Sea Route (Sevmorput)

[The expansion of this route]{.underline} (called Sevmorput in Russian)
[is one of Putin's big ambitions for the Arctic, but his insistence on
maintaining full control over the navigation is a major impediment for
international investors]{.underline}. [Investments in the port
infrastructure are far below needs]{.underline}, so most of the maritime
traffic on the Sevmorput is the LNG export from the Yamal Sabetta
terminal.

[Russian obsession with sovereignty over the Arctic underpins its claim
for expanding its continental shelf]{.underline} by some 2.1 million
square kilometres between the Lomonosov and Mendeleev undersea ridges
and beyond the North Pole. The UN Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf has registered this claim. [Still, it cannot issue a
final recommendation because of the overlap with the claims submitted by
Canada and Denmark]{.underline}.

Militarization of the Arctic

[Instead of investing in the development of infrastructure, Moscow
channeled funding into the construction of a chain of military bases
along the Sevmorput]{.underline}. This course on accelerated
militarization of the Arctic was a major concern for the neighbours and
a worry for China, which insists on the peaceful development of the
"global common" in the High North.

[Typically, this Russian military build-up is presented as a key
justification for the increase of Western efforts aimed at countering
this threat, but in fact, since the start of the Ukraine War, Moscow was
compelled to downsize its Arctic garrisons.]{.underline}

[The Northern Fleet has effectively lost capacity for amphibious
operations as three of its landing ships were deployed to the Black Sea
and suffered hits from Ukrainian missiles and naval drones]{.underline}.
[Both the 61st Naval Infantry "Kirkenes" Brigade and the 80th Motorized
Infantry Arctic Brigade are engaged in combat operations and have
suffered heavy losses.]{.underline} Finland plans for deploying more
units along its 1.340 kilometres long border with Russia, but on the
other side of this new Russian interface with NATO, hardly any troops
are present.

The only element of Russian military might in the High North that is
full strength and even gaining more capabilities is the squadrons of
nuclear submarines, both strategic and multipurpose.

### 2NC A2 Russia Build Up

[Even in the better researched analyses, the need to protect Russia's
control over the grossly exaggerated natural resources in the Arctic is
presumed to be self-evident, while Western desire to gain access to
these riches is depicted as the major driver of the escalating
geopolitical scramble]{.underline}.

The new US discourse on the Arctic

[These distorted assumptions are, in a peculiar way, reflected in the
new US discourse on the Arctic, in which the goal of gaining control
over Greenland is advanced as an absolute imperative.]{.underline}

[National security is invoked as the main rationale for this
goal-setting, while the real value of its deposits of rare-earth
elements is unknown, and the costs of mining these minerals cannot be
estimated]{.underline} even provisionally. The price tag is apparently
not an issue in Trump's far-fetched proposition for building an armada
of 40 icebreakers. Characteristically, he is not offering to purchase
Greenland but relies on crude pressure, so Denmark's Prime Minister
Mette Frederiksen cannot counter it with polite dissuasion and has to
take a firm stance.

[Ensuring Arctic security is a complex task demanding the sustained
efforts of many stakeholders, from experts in anti-submarine warfare to
environmental activists.]{.underline} [This collective work clashes with
political agendas shaped by personal ambitions, delusional threat
perceptions, and fanciful geopolitics]{.underline}.

## A2 Missile Defeat Advantage

### Missile Defense Fails

#### Missile defense fails

**Cirincione 24** \[Joe, served as the president of the Ploughshares
Fund, a public grant-making institution focused on nuclear
nonproliferation and conflict resolution, former non-resident fellow at
the Quincy Institute, and an adjunct faculty member at the Georgetown
University School of Foreign Service, "The National Missile Defense
Fantasy,"
<https://joecirincione.substack.com/p/the-national-missile-defense-fantasy>,
ALB**\]**

[National missile defense advocates live in a world of magic and
make-believe]{.underline}. Fantasy replaces science, assertions replace
facts, and cartoon weapons replace real capabilities.

This enduring fantasy, however, has real-world consequences.

President Donald Trump's pledge last week to build "a next-generation
missile defense shield" that would "defeat any foreign aerial attack on
the Homeland \[with\] space-based interceptors" has provoked a
predictable reaction. Russia blasted Trump's plan, detailed in his new
executive order, "The Iron Dome for America."

But [no magic shield is going to protect the United States against
nuclear attack]{.underline}.

An idea that never dies. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria
Zakharova said on Friday of Trump's plan that "it directly envisages a
significant strengthening of the American nuclear arsenal and means for
conducting combat operations in space, including the development and
deployment of space-based interception systems."

"We consider this as another confirmation of the US focus on turning
space into an arena of armed confrontation... and the deployment of
weapons there," Zakharova added.

The Russian reaction could scuttle Trump's stated desire to negotiate
limits on nuclear weapons. If so, it would repeat the role strategic
defenses have played in the Cold War's nuclear arms race. [Efforts to
build national defenses always trigger efforts to overcome them with
more missiles and other counter-measures]{.underline}---the well-known
security dilemma.

[Despite all the formidable technical and geopolitical evidence against
such schemes, however, "faith in national missile defense never dies,"
Washington Post columnist Max Boot observes]{.underline} in his column
blasting the plan.

It is no coincidence that Trump's new order is lifted almost entirely
from the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 wish list. In the 1980s, the
group championed President Ronald Reagan's original dream to "put in
space a shield that missiles could not penetrate---a shield that could
protect us from nuclear missiles just as a roof protects a family from
rain," as he told a 1986 high school graduating class.

Costly delirium. As Rep. John Conyers, a Democrat of Michigan, put it
when chairing the extensive Government Operations Committee
investigation into SDI in 1991, "Over the past eight years, the
administration has been remarkably successful in convincing Congress to
give it billions for SDI. But the program has proved remarkably
unsuccessful in producing much of anything. SDI has pulled a reverse
Rumpelstiltskin -- it has spun gold into straw."

I was Conyers' chief congressional investigator for those hearings. I
conducted oversight over SDI since the very first testimonies to
Congress in 1984. Then, too, officials promised an impenetrable shield.
They delivered boondoggles.

"[Money was poured into these exotic weapons projects that were later
abandoned," Conyers said]{.underline}. "\$1 billion for the Free
Electron Laser. \$1 billion for the Boost Surveillance and Tracking
Satellite. \$720 million for the Space-based Chemical Laser. \$700
million for the Neutral Particle Beam. \$366 million for the Airborne
Optical Aircraft. The list goes on."

To cover up these failures, Trump blames (as he does with everything
from losing elections to fatal plane crashes) a deep conspiracy. He
claims in his new order that Reagan's program "was canceled before its
goal could be realized." Other presidents then handcuffed the US
population by, still according to Trump's executive order, limiting the
effort "only to stay ahead of rogue-nation threats and accidental or
unauthorized missile launches."

Again, this is nonsense. As it became clear that the space-based laser
weapons Edward Teller told Reagan he could build were a fantasy, Reagan
and subsequent presidents scaled down the program to try to get some
kind of workable defense. But after spending over \$415 billion over
decades, all the United States has to show for the effort is 44
ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California that can hit a
cooperative target in carefully scripted demonstrations---about half of
the time. Congress currently allocates \$30 billion a year on missile
defense and defeat programs, most run by the SDI successor, the Missile
Defense Agency.

Not an iron dome; more like an iron colander. [The major technical
problems that remain unresolved---and eventually forced the cancellation
of all SDI's ambitious plans---are the same obstacles that have ruled
out an effective ballistic missile defense for more than 60
years]{.underline}:

[the ability of the enemy to overwhelm a system with offensive
missiles]{.underline};

the questionable survivability of space-based weapons;

[the inability to discriminate among real warheads and hundreds or
thousands of decoys;]{.underline}

[the problem of designing battle management, command, control, and
communications that could function in a nuclear war;]{.underline} and,

[the low confidence in the ability of the system to work perfectly the
first---and, perhaps, only---time it is ever used]{.underline}.

These problems have been detailed at length already in the Bulletin's
columns, congressional reports, and independent expert studies,
including two that played a major role in the Star Wars debates---the
1987 American Physical Society Directed Energy Weapon study and the 1988
Office of Technology Assessment Ballistic Missile Defense study.

[These and other technical problems would have to be resolved before an
effective missile defense system can be deployed]{.underline}. In the
long term, new technologies, particularly directed energy weapons, hold
some promise. In the short term, however, there is little reason for
blind technological optimism.

[Intentionally confusing the US public and gullible politicians by
conflating the limited success of less-complicated defenses against
short-range rockets with the infeasibility of destroying hundreds of
long-range ballistic missiles is part of the sales effort.]{.underline}

"Israel has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system," Trump
promisedat the Republican Party convention last year. "Why should other
countries have this, and we don't?"

Because it is technically impossible to build a system that can protect
the United States from ballistic missile attack, Mr. President. No
amount of hucksterism will change that.

"Iron Dome defends small areas from short-range nonnuclear missiles.
It's a vastly easier task than defending the whole country against
missiles that travel 100 times further and seven times faster," missile
defense expert Laura Grego of the Union of Concerned Scientists
explains.

["There is zero possibility of a comprehensive missile defense of the
United States in the foreseeable future]{.underline}," [James N. Miller,
who served as undersecretary of defense in the Obama administration,
told Max Boot. "We are not going to escape mutual assured destruction
vis-à-vis Russia or China]{.underline}."

[As shown repeatedly over the past 60 years, the only way to eliminate
the threat of nuclear-armed missiles is to negotiate their
elimination]{.underline}. [Pretending that there is a magic shield that
can be willed into existence will only make the problem of national
missile defense worse.]{.underline}

"Like Israel's highly effective system of the same name, President
Trump's Iron Dome will provide an impenetrable defense for the American
people that will bring peace through strength," Heritage Foundation
fellow Victoria Coates said. It "will fulfill President Reagan's vision
for the Strategic Defense Initiative laid out some four decades ago,"
she added.

### Threat Overblown/Fails

#### The missile threat is overblown and missile defense won't work

**Cirincione 24** \[Joe, served as the president of the Ploughshares
Fund, a public grant-making institution focused on nuclear
nonproliferation and conflict resolution, former non-resident fellow at
the Quincy Institute, and an adjunct faculty member at the Georgetown

Fantasy,"
<https://joecirincione.substack.com/p/the-national-missile-defense-fantasy>,
ALB**\]**

Doomed to fail. Trump's executive order is a jumble of false claims and
imaginary solutions. It begins by declaring that [the risk of a missile
attack "remains the most catastrophic threat facing the United
States]{.underline}." [That would surprise most experts on existential
risks]{.underline}. [The climate crisis, the threat of new pandemics,
artificial intelligence, and crippling cyber attacks are all at least as
likely catastrophic event]{.underline}s --- as are nuclear weapons
delivered by other means. But [threat inflation has always been a key
part of efforts to justify urgent action and massive
investment]{.underline}.

Trump claims that "over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the
threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense
and complex." Despite being utter nonsense, this claim has gone largely
unchallenged.

While it is true that new technologies have increased the lethality of
missiles, [the missile threat to the United States has decreased
dramatically]{.underline}. [Arms control treaties and the collapse of
the Soviet Union slashed the number of nuclear weapons and nuclear-armed
missiles threatening the United States.]{.underline}

[In 1985, the Soviet Union deployed 2,345]{.underline} [land-based and
submarine-based missiles carrying over 9,300 nuclear
warheads]{.underline}. That was the threat Reagan hoped to render
"impotent and obsolete" with his missile shield.

[Thanks to negotiated agreements, today's Russia fields only 521
missiles, carrying 2,236 warheads. China's land-based nuclear-armed
missiles capable of reaching the United States have increased from
around 20 in 1985 to some 135 today]{.underline} (carrying 238 warheads)
and perhaps 72 single-warhead submarine-based missiles. [In sum, the
United States today faces roughly one-fifth the number of enemy missiles
compared to 40 years ago]{.underline} and one-quarter of the nuclear
warheads (728 vs. 2,365 missiles and 2,546 vs. 9,320 warheads). That is
still a very dangerous threat but by no means a greater one.

[Where arms control succeeded, missile defense technology
failed]{.underline}.

None of the scores of systems developed by Reagan's Strategic Defense
Initiative (SDI) and its successor organizations have ever come close to
providing the imaginary shield that Reagan promised. [National missile
defenses did not work then. They do not work now. They will likely never
work.]{.underline}

[[U.S.-North Korean]{.mark} [relations are]{.mark} another
[example]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [mutual
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} [continuing to hold despite official
concern. In some ways, the Korean Peninsula has been]{.underline}
[heating up again]{.underline} [as a potential flashpoint]{.underline}
for nuclear conflict. [The regime]{.underline} in Pyongyang continues to
[conduct frequent [missile tests]{.mark}]{.underline}, with some flying
over Japan or landing near South Korean territorial waters.32 Meanwhile,
South Korea and the United States have again held large-scale, live-fire
military exercises.33 North Korea loathes the exercises because they
rehearse a preemptive strike against the DPRK and because military
exercises are sometimes a cover for real invasions.34 North Korea and
South Korea at night [Due to these developments, some [observers fear we
could]{.mark} [be heading]{.mark} [toward]{.mark} the [dangerous
days]{.mark} of six years ago]{.underline}.35 In 2017, the Korean
Peninsula saw not only U.S.-South Korea joint exercises and North Korean
testing, but also very heated rhetoric. President Donald Trump and
Chairman Kim Jong-un led the chest-thumping: President Trump threatened
to "totally destroy" North Korea with "fire and fury," and Chairman Kim
talked of "taming" the adversary with "fire." The warnings were followed
by dutiful subordinates doing their level best to create a vision of
victory in war. However, [[a closer look]{.mark} at the supposed
"winning" scenarios]{.underline} [[makes it]{.underline}
[unsurprising]{.underline}]{.mark} [that]{.underline} [[neither
side]{.underline}]{.mark} [ultimately [favored war]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Collision with reality began e]{.underline}arly. According to TIME, in
April 2017, briefers showed President Trump a well-known satellite image
of the Korean Peninsula at night. President Trump asked why Seoul was so
close to the North Korean border and declared that its residents would
"have to move,"36 presumably to blunt a North Korean response to a
U.S.-South Korean joint attack. To put it mildly, a strategy contingent
on South Korea abandoning its capital and largest city was unlikely to
win much support. Those responsible for providing President Trump with
military options against North Korea did not paint a pretty picture.
Secretary of Defense James Mattis told a House committee that "\[i\]t
would be a war like nothing we have seen since 1953," when the last
Korean War killed more than 2.5 million people.37 Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford worked hard to keep threats against
North Korea credible, but in describing the war, he recalled an even
more deadly precedent. At an Aspen Institute forum, he said that a war
on the peninsula "would be horrific, and it would be a loss of life
unlike any we have experienced in our lifetimes, and I mean anyone who's
been alive since World War II has never seen the loss of life that could
occur if there's a conflict on the Korean Peninsula." 38 Seoul, the
capital of South Korea, is approximately 40 miles from the DMZ and 170
miles from Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. The Trump
administration may have also considered limited strikes against North
Korea---what the press called the "bloody nose" option---but
circumstantial evidence suggests that the U.S. Department of Defense saw
the move as prohibitively risky. On a 2021 public panel, Gen. Vincent
Brooks, the top U.S. commander in South Korea in 2017, recommended
against U.S. or South Korean strikes to thwart imminent North Korean
missile tests since no one could be confident that Pyongyang would see
the attacks as limited rather than a casus belli.39 Less is known about
North Korea's theory of victory, but what has been revealed is telling[.
The [North Koreans have focused]{.mark} most of their [rhetorical
arrows]{.mark}]{.underline} [on what they would do to the United
States]{.underline} if forced. For instance, a Foreign Ministry
spokesman warned that North Korea would "strike a merciless blow at the
heart of the U.S. with our powerful nuclear hammer" if the United States
should "dare to show even the slightest sign of attempt to remove our
supreme leadership."40 [[North Korea has said]{.mark} much [less
about]{.mark} the consequences]{.underline} [of an [American
response]{.mark}, but what [it has
said]{.mark}]{.underline}---[admitting that]{.underline} [[enormous
casualties]{.underline} [were]{.underline}]{.mark} [[likely]{.mark} and
only "a few thousand" would still survive---[bolsters the idea]{.mark}

[North]{.mark} [Korea has enough]{.mark}]{.underline} [nonnuclear
[firepower]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to ensure war is not worth the

#### Their plans are [nowhere close]{.underline} to being operational

**News4 23**. Hong-Kong Based News Agency. North Korea showcases nuclear
assault ability in major ever ICBM parade\". News 4 Social English.

https://en.news4social.com/uncategorized/north-korea-showcases-nuclear-assault-ability-in-major-ever-icbm-parade-news/

[[North Korea]{.underline} [showcased]{.underline}]{.mark} virtually a
dozen [innovative [i]{.mark}nter[c]{.mark}ontinental [b]{.mark}allistic
[m]{.mark}issile[s]{.mark} [at a]{.mark}]{.underline} [nighttime [armed
service parade]{.mark} on Wednesday]{.underline}, in the most
significant display screen but of what its condition-operate media
described as Pyongyang's "nuclear assault capacity."

The missiles were paraded via Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung sq. as leader Kim
Jong Un, accompanied by his spouse, and a youthful girl thought to be
his daughter looked on.

Described: How considerably harm can North Korea's weapons do?

The broadly anticipated party, which marked the founding anniversary of
the North Korean army, comes considerably less than two months
immediately after Kim called for an "exponential increase" in his
country's nuclear arsenal in response to what he statements are threats
from South Korea and the United States.

Final yr noticed North Korea examination far more missiles than at any
time in its record, which include an intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM) that could in concept strike the US mainland.

North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles move past leader Kim
Jong Un in a reviewing stand during Wednesday night\'s military parade
in Pyongyang.

That missile, the Hwasong-17, is what analysts explained was showcased
on Wednesday evening.

"It appears to be like like 10-12 Hwasong-17 ICBMs designed an overall
look. [This is cumulatively a lot more ICBM launchers than we have ever
observed in advance of at a North Korean parade]{.underline}," Ankit
Panda, a nuclear plan qualified at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, claimed on social media.

Panda reported if every missile ended up outfitted with a number of
nuclear warheads, they could represent more than enough volume to
overwhelm US ballistic missile defenses.

The unparalleled display seems to display Kim is subsequent as a result
of on his pledge to equip the place with a nuclear arsenal that can
threaten the US.

In addition to the Hwasong-17, analysts explained North Korea confirmed
off what could be a mockup of a new stable-fueled ICBM, which, if it
were being to turn into operational, would give Pyongyang a additional
cellular and tougher to detect nuclear missile.

Solid-fueled rockets are additional secure than the liquid-fueled ones
like the Hwasong-17. That suggests a good-fueled ICBM could be moved
additional quickly and introduced a lot more speedily than a
liquid-fueled one.

North Korea stated in December it experienced effectively examined a
sound-fueled rocket motor.

A mockup of what analysts think could be a new North Korean solid-fueled
intercontinental ballistic missile is paraded in Pyongyang on Wednesday
night in image from state-run media.

But [[the presence of]{.mark} the [potentially reliable-fueled
missiles]{.mark} at the parade [does not]{.mark} [imply they are
workable]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[North Korea is not considered to have
flight analyzed a sound-fueled missile]{.mark}, and authorities say [it
faces numerous technical hurdles]{.mark} in advance of getting in a
position [to deploy just one.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Aside from the ICBMs, North Korean condition media mentioned the parade
showcased tactical missiles and very long-range cruise missiles.

The Kim regime uses its armed forces parades to shore up domestic
support for its military programs although sending a sign to the United
States, South Korea and other folks. [But North Korea's missile buildup
will come in violation of United Nations sanctions and soaks up sources
that could be made use of somewhere else.]{.underline}

"Kim Jong Un enable North Korea's growing tactical and
prolonged-selection missile forces talk for by themselves," mentioned
Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. "The regime
has staked its legitimacy on nuclear weapons at the price of diplomacy
and the economic climate."

Easley and other analysts say the future stage in North Korea's nuclear
weapons advancement could be an underground examination of an precise
weapon and could arrive at any time.

### Iran Impact Defense

#### No Iran wars.

and expert on Middle East politics and military affairs, a resident
scholar at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on Middle Eastern
political-military affairs, former Senior Fellow at the Saban Center for
Middle East Policy, and former and a Senior Advisor at Albright
Stonebridge Group. \[Is war with Iran imminent? Here\'s the real truth,
5-16-2019,
http://www.aei.org/publication/is-war-with-iran-imminent-heres-the-real-truth/\]

[[Is the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[going to war]{.mark} with [Iran?]{.mark} Probably
[no]{.mark}t]{.underline}.

Should the United States go to war with Iran? Probably not.

Now that that's out of the way, we can unpack the current tensions with
Iran, where they are likely to lead, and the potential pitfalls the
United States should avoid on the road ahead.

[It is unlikely]{.underline} that we [will]{.underline} find ourselves
in a [war]{.underline} with [Iran]{.underline} in the near term because
[[both sides are eager to avoid one]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although some
of President Trump's advisors may welcome a clash with Tehran, he has
consistently made clear that he wants to end American wars in the Middle
East, not start new ones. That has been behind his impetus to pull US
troops out of Syria and his unwillingness to become further involved in
the Yemeni civil war.

On the other side of the Persian Gulf, [[Ayatollah]{.mark} Ali
Khamene'i, Iran's Supreme Leader [announced]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[there would be [no war]{.mark}. In case you don't believe him, the
[Iran]{.mark}ians]{.underline} have typically
[[show]{.underline}]{.mark}n [[enormous respect for American]{.mark}
conventional military [power since they were shellacked]{.mark} by it
[in the]{.mark} late 19[80s. They know]{.mark}]{.underline} full well
that in a full-on war, [the [US would]{.mark}]{.underline} do tremendous
damage to Iran's armed forces and could [[threaten the
regime's]{.underline}]{.mark} grip on [[power]{.underline}]{.mark} --
which is the very thing they are seeking to avoid.

Of course, just because two countries don't want a war doesn't mean that
they won't stumble into one anyway. Given the current tensions created
by the American pressure on Iran and Tehran's nascent efforts to push
back, the deployment of additional American military forces to the
region, and the tendency for Iran's Revolutionary Guards to occasionally
take unauthorized aggressive actions, no one should rule out [an
unintended [clash]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even then, however, the most
likely scenario [[would be a limited]{.mark} American [retaliatory
strike to demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline} to Iran that [[Washington
won't be pushed around by a]{.mark} 98-pound [weakling]{.mark} and that
Tehran needs to keep its problem children under control]{.underline}.

[[5. Iran doesn't]{.underline}]{.mark} really
[[want]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[war]{.underline}]{.mark} with the United
States. Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah [[Khamenei]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [publicly [stated]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[Iran does not seek
war]{.underline}]{.mark} with the United States. Iranian officials [know
that [while]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [might
not]{.mark}]{.underline} be able to [conclusively [win, Iran would bear
the]{.mark} majority of the human [costs]{.mark}. The [shadow of]{.mark}
the [1980]{.mark}--88 Iran-Iraq War still [looms]{.mark}
large]{.underline} in the mind of the Iranian public. [[Iran
suffered]{.underline}]{.mark} an estimated one million deaths in the
conflict, or 2 percent of its population at the time---impacting
[[a]{.mark}n entire [generation]{.mark}. Iran's [objective]{.mark} isn't
to bait]{.underline} the United States into a [war]{.underline}. Rather,
[[it]{.mark} is to play a careful game of [chess]{.mark} that allows the
regime [to improve]{.mark} its [bargaining]{.mark} position]{.underline}
by demonstrating the ability to impose costs on the United States and
its allies. Tehran has done this [[through]{.underline}]{.mark} a series
of [limited and [reversible escalations]{.mark}]{.underline} while
avoiding what their own leaders admit would be a devastating war against
a more powerful foe. [[They]{.mark} have carefully [avoided]{.mark}
[provocations]{.mark}]{.underline} that might force Trump's hand,
[[relying on]{.underline}]{.mark} the use of [[proxy forces and covert
action]{.mark} in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen]{.underline}. And
[Iran has good reason to believe [this]{.mark}]{.underline} strategy
[[may work, given Trump's cancelation of]{.mark} previous
[strikes]{.mark} on Iran [and willingness to bargain]{.mark} with North
Korea]{.underline} following intensification of its rhetoric and nuclear
and missile activities.

### 1NC Missile Defense Impact Turn

#### Missile defense [causes]{.underline} nuclear war and the counterplan solves it

**Regehr 23**, Senior Fellow in Arctic Security and Defense at The
Simons Foundation Canada, and Research Fellow at the Institute of Peace
and Conflict Studies, Conrad Grebel University College, University of
Waterloo (Ernie Regehr, July 11, 2023, "US Strategic Ballistic Missile
Defence: Why Canada won't join it," The Simons Foundation Canada,
https://www.thesimonsfoundation.ca/highlights/us-strategic-ballistic-missile-defence-why-canada-wont-join-it)

Emerging missile threats

So, once again, [the threat profile has changed
significantly]{.underline}. In addition to NORAD's aerospace and
maritime warning roles (and the ongoing air defence operations), the
attention of defence planners has turned to those [[cruise and
hypersonic missile]{.mark} threat[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cruise
missiles [have [been gaining]{.mark} both range and speed]{.underline}
to supersonic levels, while hypersonic missiles include variations on
cruise missiles using specialized engines, or "scramjets" (HCMs),15 and
hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) launched by rocket, and also boosted to
hypersonic speeds by special jet engines,16 before gliding to a target.
[Both varieties are [highly maneuverable, unlike ICBMs]{.mark} which
follow predictable trajectories.]{.underline}

[[Potential defences]{.mark} against such weapons [are envisioned
through]{.mark} layered]{.underline} and integrated air and [[missile
defence]{.mark} systems. The primary American concern is]{.underline}
focused on threats to American military installations overseas and at
home, [[fearing]{.mark} that [rival states]{.mark} could [use]{.mark}
cruise and hypersonic [systems to threaten]{.mark} conventional
([non-nuclear]{.mark}) [attacks on]{.mark} key [US]{.mark} military
facilities]{.underline} anywhere in the world [[to]{.mark} try to [deter
Washington]{.mark}]{.underline} from conducting major military
operations abroad.

Freedom of military action abroad is deemed to be key to Washington's
global role, but if overseas operations expose key facilities at home to
conventional attacks the calculations change. Nuclear threats to the
homeland are viewed to be deterred by nuclear counter threats, but
[conventional threats to the homeland would be [assumed]{.mark} by the
attacker [not to provoke]{.mark} a [nuclear response because of]{.mark}
the [threat of]{.mark} it [escalating]{.mark} to broader nuclear
conflagration]{.underline}. Hence, much of the strategic defence focus
has shifted to searching for defences against hypersonic and cruise
missiles deemed not to be deterred by nuclear threats.

The elusive technology fix

Systems designed to defend against air and diverse missile threats will
depend substantially on technologies and weapons systems that are still
being developed or imagined. And it must be said that much of the same
technology optimism that animated Ronald Reagan remains in play.

There is no denying extraordinary advances in technology and artificial
intelligence, suggesting that even the more extravagant claims for
AI-assisted weapons should not be easily dismissed. And the idea that
"machine learning" can be mobilized to facilitate unprecedentedly "fast
decision-making" must be taken as credible, but it is surely worth
asking, what could possibly go wrong? Little of the Reagan Star Wars
vision has survived, and it remains to be seen how much of the "hardened
shield" now being imagined17 for North America will come to fruition.
And what of its likely impact -- will it yield a more secure North
America or a more robust threat and more dangerous strategic
environment?

That said, it is clear that the Canada/US North Warning System
(successor to the DEW line) and more generally the ability to monitor
northern approaches to North American land, air, and maritime territory
need updating -- a process that is now underway. Situation awareness
across all domains in the Arctic is obviously not only important but
essential.

[[It does not follow, however]{.mark}, that [every military
threat]{.mark} that is detectable [can be defeated]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For the better part of seven decades North America has had the capacity
to detect and provide early warning of nuclear-armed air and ballistic
missile attacks but has never had the capacity to defeat them. Indeed,
the experience has been that [[even]{.mark} the [pursuit of]{.mark} a
[defence capability against]{.mark} such [threats has exacerbated
them]{.mark}]{.underline} as Russia and China pursue new capabilities to
get around the defences. And, of course, that is why the Pentagon is now
at pains to assure Russia and China that America's homeland missile
defence operation is not directed at their warheads.

An ABM irony

After decades of effort, and cost,18 strategic missile defence sponsors
claim advances in "hitting a bullet with a bullet," but not in
protection. What GMD has proven instead is the opening premise of the
ABM Treaty of 1972,19 which Washington abandoned in 2002 -- namely, that
there is a link between missile defence and efforts to expand offensive
missiles. New START makes the same link, "recognizing the existence of
the interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic
defensive arms."20 In other words, [while [strategic]{.mark} missile
[defence]{.mark} is not able to protect the homeland]{.underline}
population, [it still [spurs]{.mark} the [offensive efforts of
adversaries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Reagan imagined that strategic defence would "pave the way for arms
control measures to eliminate the weapons themselves,"21 but what
[GMD]{.mark} has achieved instead is to [exacerbate]{.mark} a technology
driven [arms race]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia and China both now focus
on new strategic systems that are designed to circumvent GMD, just in
case some distant future might yet produce dramatically improved
capacity against ballistic missiles.

To date, strategic defence has not managed to deliver actual defence,
only the fear that it might. And in order to mitigate that fear, the US
tries to assure Russia and China that the GMD system is definitely not
aimed at their offensive systems.

And therein lies a major irony. The technical and strategic limits that
now de facto constrain the GMD homeland missile defence system are
remarkably close to the constraints that were operative under the ABM
Treaty for three decades. The Treaty's chief objective was strategic
stability and to prevent a destructive offensive arms race, and so each
of the parties agreed "not to deploy ABM systems for a defense of the
territory of its country..." (Article II). The George W. Bush
Administration pulled out of the Treaty to avoid those very limits, but
now Washington openly declares that GMD is not at all about protecting
its territory from Russian and Chinese nuclear attack. Furthermore, GMD
now deploys fewer interceptors (44, to be increased to a total of 64)
than the 100 allowed by the Treaty.

When the ABM Treaty was abandoned, confidence in strategic stability
took a serious hit, as did US taxpayers, and in the end, there is still
no protection. After the damage of abandoning the Treaty was done and a
new missile race set in motion, the irony is that the Treaty's basic
provisions have in effect prevailed, but without the benefit of an
international agreement that should be in place to institutionalize
mutual restraint.

Arms control and diplomacy

[All of [that argues against]{.mark}]{.underline} Canada joining [[GMD
and points to]{.mark} the [need to work towards a]{.mark}
credible]{.underline} arms control [[response to expanding missile
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}. Experience tells us that [[strategic
defence]{.mark} schemes [are]{.mark} much [more likely to exacerbate
than allay]{.mark} such [threats]{.mark}]{.underline}. Throughout the
nuclear age [there has never been a reliable defence against nuclear
attack. Effectively [responding]{.mark} to nuclear threats
[must]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily [[come down to]{.mark} trying to
reduce the threat through]{.underline} arms control, [[easing tensions
through diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, and preventing attack through
deterrence. But, [[given]{.mark} that the threat of [m]{.mark}utually
[a]{.mark}ssured mass [d]{.mark}estruction [can never be]{.mark} a
[satisfactory]{.mark} foundation]{.underline} for long-term security,
[the [urgent need is for]{.mark}]{.underline} arms control and
disarmament, and for [sustained [strategic dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}
among adversaries -- [[the only]{.mark} safe, [durable solution to the
existential]{.mark} nuclear [threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Arms control and [strategic dialogue are not options to be held in
reserve and worked on once the threats are gone and the tensions have
eased. The [threats and tensions need]{.mark} urgent
attention]{.underline}, and it is for Canada to be part of and promote
an international arms control community that insists that arms control
and disarmament measures, as well as [strategic stability
[diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}, become [the frontline [responses
to]{.mark} strategic [missile threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Rethinking Missile Defense

[U.S. missile defense efforts have produced a worst-of-both-worlds
situation]{.underline}. On the one hand, against increasingly
sophisticated regional missile threats, the efforts to deploy a robust
regional missile defense shield appear improbable. At the same time, the
growing pace of North Korean capabilities and systemic U.S. technical
failures raises severe doubts about the viability of the GMD homeland
missile defense system.23 On the other hand, [the accumulation of a
range of technological capabilities to support the missile defense
mission undermines strategic stability.]{.underline}

U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, discussing U.S. fears of a
Soviet technological breakthrough in missile defense systems in 1967,
observed that it did not make "much difference what the evidence
indicates...because I believe we must assume for planning" purposes that
a system with the probable characteristic of a missile defense system
can at some future point emerge as a capable defense.24 Throughout the
1960s, U.S. nuclear war planners espoused a greater-than-expected threat
metric to offset any future Soviet technical breakthroughs in missile
defense. Similarly, prudence requires Russian and Chinese analysts to
assume any limited U.S. system is a stalking horse for a more
substantial defense. If worst-case planning is the baseline to determine
requirements for strategic deterrence, Russia and China could easily
postulate imminent U.S. qualitative and quantitative breakthroughs.

[After the end of the Cold War, U.S. policymakers were willing to
suspend the logic of strategic stability in the pursuit of missile
defense]{.underline}. Yet, [such a posture is no longer
possible]{.underline}. [The United States has declared the reemergence
of great-power competition. The 2022 Nuclear Posture Review asserts the
emergence of two major nuclear powers, Russia and China, as U.S.
strategic competitors and potential adversaries]{.underline}. [The
review acknowledges "new stresses" on stability and
deterrence]{.underline}.25 [The pursuit of unconstrained missile defense
systems is one of those stressors]{.underline}. U.S. efforts to maintain
a viable homeland and regional missile defense have reached the point
where the vector sum of the emerging capabilities of the various
interceptors and sensors already surpass, in theory, the requirements of
a highly capable homeland defense that could function against major
nuclear powers.

[A rethinking of the logic and purpose of the U.S. missile defense
enterprise is urgently needed]{.underline}. First, the role of defensive
and offensive forces against regional missile threats has to be
reexamined in light of recent experiences, including the Russian war
against Ukraine. Missile defense in a regional context may play niche
roles, but it cannot be the essence of the U.S. deterrent and
war-fighting strategy. Second, technology creep continues to erode the
separation between regional and homeland systems. U.S. policymakers must
institute clear limits to highlight the separation between these
systems. Finally, policymakers also must explore arms control measures
to constrain regional ballistic missile arsenals.

#### Missile defense causes conflict and causes Russia and China to militarize -- turns the case

**Union of Concerned Scientists 21** \["US Missile Defense,"
<https://www.ucs.org/nuclear-weapons/missile-defense#:~:text=It's%20potentially%20dangerous:%20policy%20makers%2C%20misled%20to,as%20a%20reason%20to%20maintain%20more%20weapons>.,
ALB\]

Unfortunately, the United States has invested tens of billions of
dollars in a system that has not proven to work under real-world
conditions---a practical reality that more money and research won\'t
fix. What\'s more, [missile defense systems create other problems
including potential overconfidence in the defense and incentive for
adversaries to build more nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

Known as the "Ground-based Midcourse Defense" (GMD), the system's basic
premise is simple: incoming warheads are tracked by radar and satellite
and targeted by defensive "interceptor" missiles, launched from the
bases in Alaska and California---a task sometimes described as "hitting
a bullet with a bullet."

The Union of Concerned Scientists has analyzed the technical and
political aspects of missile defense for more than three decades.
[Though the idea of a missile shield may sound attractive, today's
homeland system is hugely expensive, counterproductive, and offers no
proven capability to protect the United States---and no credible path
forward for achieving success.]{.underline}

Missile defense is supposed to protect the US public. The evidence
suggests that it doesn't.

Most military systems face mandatory oversight and accountability
requirements, developed to keep projects on-time, at-cost, and to make
sure they work as the military needs them to work.

The current system---started by the Bush administration in a post-9/11
security environment---was exempted from many of the normal, routine,
and important requirements and only parts of this oversight have been
reinstated.

As a result, the system has had a poor test record even under a limited
range of simplified conditions.

Early analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists also showed how
countermeasures like decoy warheads could easily defeat missile defense,
an issue never credibly addressed by administration officials.

[As it exists today, the system could not guarantee protection in a
realistic scenario]{.underline}. [It's potentially dangerous: policy
makers, misled to believe in missile defense's effectiveness, may act in
ways that increase the likelihood of conflict. It also can be a barrier
to deep cuts in the nuclear arsenals of Russia and China, who cite it as
a reason to maintain more weapons.]{.underline}

[Colleen:]{.underline} It\'s also misleading the public. Because it
exists and I would assume that\...many, [many people would assume that
it works or it works well enough]{.underline} and you get conflicting
information now from the Trump administration about its success rate.

[Laura:]{.underline} Right. So it exists, right? So you think it should
work. We spent lots of money and we are continuing to and we\'re
proposing to spend many more billions of dollars on it. So, again, we
think it should work, not only the Trump administration but stretching
back through the Obama administration and the George W. Bush
administration, government military administration officials saying,
\"This system protects us.\" Well, right now, really against all
evidence, there had been, sort of, no tests that demonstrated that it
worked, right? So you\'re, sort of, taking it on faith.

And maybe, you know, maybe that was satisfying and in some sense to some
people, at that point but as the North Korean missile program advanced,
I think more people are turning a critical eye and saying, \"Okay, so
let\'s see how\...can you back that up with real evidence. Does the
system really work like that?\" And you look at the test program. And
one of the beautiful things we have in this country is transparency
about a lot, and it\'s very difficult to hide [a [missile
defense]{.mark} test]{.underline}. They\'re big, loud, hard to hide type
of thing, you know, big rocket launches. So you know when they happen
and you know whether they worked or not. So we know a lot about the
system and how its performed and, you know, that [[doesn\'t square
with]{.mark} the [claims]{.mark} that [it protects America]{.mark}n
people right now.]{.underline}

\[Break: We'll be back in a minute with the second half of our
interview\]

[Colleen:]{.underline} So let\'s think about this scenario, you\'re
having dinner with some friends, they\'re super smart, and you\'re
saying that you don\'t think spending billions of dollars for a missile
defense system that doesn\'t work is the way to go. And whenever you
bring this up, [[the]{.mark} automatic [response is]{.mark}, \"Well, [if
we don\'t]{.mark} keep working on it or [have something]{.mark} like
that, you know, [we\'re sitting ducks]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} So how do
you answer that question?

[Laura:]{.underline} Yeah. Well, like, I\'m pretty sympathetic to that
and a lot of what you\'ll hear, you know, [a lot of the automatic
reaction is something\'s better than nothing]{.underline}, even if it\'s
terrible, something is better than nothing. [And that sounds, kind of,
right, but [I don\'t think it\'s]{.mark} actually [right]{.mark} and
here\'s why]{.underline}. So [[missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark}
isn\'t like, \"It works in a vacuum of space, but it doesn\'t work in
a\...\" [it\'s [not in a]{.mark} strategic or [political
vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline}. So [[all]{.mark} your [decisions]{.mark}
that you make]{.underline}, in general, [need to be [based on a]{.mark}
clear [assessment of how it works]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For example, let\'s say you have [a [missile defense]{.mark} system
[that doesn\'t work]{.mark} very well]{.underline}, like we don\'t [[but
you think it does]{.mark}. You [might be inclined to take more risks
in]{.mark} your [foreign policy]{.mark} and \[brinkship\]]{.underline}
~~brinksmanship~~ [and]{.underline}, you know, [you think you have a
shield, you go poke the bear, but your shield actually isn\'t
great]{.underline}, right? So you might not have gone to poke the bear
in the first place if you knew your shield didn\'t work so well. I mean,
having a shield is better than not, but best of all is not to go poke a
bear, right?

So [you don\'t want a system to [distort]{.mark} your [decision-making
because you]{.mark} think it works better than it does or you might [not
have]{.mark} as much [domestic pressure to find]{.mark} creative
[diplomatic solutions]{.mark} to a hard problem [like]{.mark} the
[No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rean problem because
[you]{.mark}]{.underline}, kind of, [[deflate that pressure because you
can say]{.mark}, \"Well, [we got]{.mark} a [missile
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. We\'re working on this, [[we don\'t
need]{.mark} to do this hard work of [diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}
because we\'ve got a missile defense.\"

But if you have things that make you make worse decisions overall and
really\...like, a missile defense, even if we did a great job on the
GMD, even if it worked much better than it does, it still would not ever
work 100%. It still would be overwhelmed. It\'s still in an attack of
the way a real adversary would attack. I mean, maybe if North Korea were
like, \"Yeah we\'re gonna send one or two bare simple missiles, no
countermeasures, really easy, just a couple.\" You know, maybe the
system would have a fair chance of that, but when would North Korea
think about doing something like that. I mean North Korea would
assuredly no longer exist if it sent any nuclear-armed missiles towards
the United States. Whether or not we intercepted them or not, they would
have to assume that they would...

Colleen: Perish.

[Laura:]{.underline} \...perish. Yes, exactly, right. So maybe it works
in this small situation, but that\'s not the likely situation. If North
Korea had decided, I just don\'t see how it would be likely that North
Korea would take the decision to attack the United States. I think it\'s
very unlikely. But if so it would do it, you know, throw everything at
us as possible to make it successful. So in that case, you know, [the
[GMD]{.mark} system [is not likely to catch
everything]{.mark}]{.underline}. So when you\'re thinking about, \"Where
do I put my resources? How do I spend my time? How do I spend my
political capital? How do I spend my energy?\" [Really, [the problem
is]{.mark}, \"[How do we make sure]{.mark} these [missiles are never
launched in the first place]{.mark}, right?]{.underline} That has to be
your focus. So if [[missile defense]{.mark} becomes [a distraction from
that]{.mark}]{.underline}, that\'s where I see that something may not be
better than nothing.

You know, well, I don\'t think North Korea is gonna have\...has an
intention to launch intentionally, thoughtfully, nuclear-armed missiles
towards the United States, but [[it\'s more likely]{.mark} that [we\'ll
stumble into]{.mark} a [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. We\'ll stumble into
[because]{.underline} we\'ve got, you know, a fairly impulsive head of
state in the United States and [we don\'t have good relationship with
North Korea. We don\'t have good communications that could reliably
ratchet crises down]{.underline} or misunderstandings, you say, \"Is
this what you\'re intending? This is how we see the problems.\"

[[We\'re not doing that]{.mark} basic to [work]{.mark} together that
[you need to]{.mark} do [to make sure]{.mark} you [don\'t accidentally
get into]{.mark} a [nuclear conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. So that, and
[when we\'re talking about where our energy and our time is]{.underline}
and [when we\'re talking about [diplomacy engagement, we have to]{.mark}
do that part]{.underline} just to make sure that we lower the risk of
accidentally doing this.

Colleen: And it\'s that the turnaround time is so short, you hardly have
any time to figure out if\...if a real crisis happens, you don\'t want
to have to make that horrible decision in 10 or 20 minutes.

Laura: Well that is the way we've set up nuclear weapons and nuclear
missiles. Is that they can be used very quickly and on demand, rather
than for example taking nuclear weapons off the missiles and only
putting them on later after deliberation.

Colleen: Well, it felt just last week with the alert in Hawaii that
terrified people. For me, that struck a chord because I remember growing
up, I was at the, sort of, the tail end of duck and cover where, you
know, a nuclear warhead is coming in and that was a terrifying time. I
remember as a kid being very scared about nuclear war and that\...I
can\'t imagine how people felt getting that text message. I mean, what
do you do? Where do you go? You know, and I don\'t know on the alert if
it said it was a nuclear weapon or\...I don\'t know. Could you tell from
the alert if it was or you\'d just assume that?

Laura: That\'s a good question, actually. I don\'t know the details
about that. I think it was, \"Take cover.\" But, you know, it\'s a
different\...you know, there are a lot of people who didn\'t grow up
during the Cold War now and who didn\'t watch wargames and who
don\'t\...so it\'s a different right there. Their life experience has
been different. So this may be, sort of, shocking, \"Wait, what? I
thought we, sort of, sorted with this nuclear weapons stuff out like
decades ago.\" It sounds a little old-fashioned but it\'s still with us.
We still have these. These are still shaping the way we live in this
world and in a not positive way. So, I think, people are more aware of
it than they have been.

Colleen: Maybe that will be a good thing, maybe it will raise awareness.
One other thing that we didn\'t really touch on but we\'re talking
about, North Korea, and the U.S., and our missile defense system, but
this is all in the much larger context of other big countries with
nuclear weapons and just how complicated it is. If we make this one move
to beef up our security that might look like we\'re threatening another
larger country, maybe we\'re threatening China now.

Laura: Right. So going back to your friend at the dinner party who is
like, \"Why wouldn\'t we wanna have this?\" There is yet another piece
and you\'ve landed on it which is the potential for missile defense to
increase the threats that you see against you. So, you know, sometimes
people say, \"Oh, it\'s gonna dissuade countries from building missiles,
in the first place, because they\'re gonna see this impenetrable wall
and be like, \"I\'m not gonna bother.\" We don\'t really see any
evidence of that, you know, the GMD system has been on an accelerated
schedule since 2001 and that coincides with the North Korean. You know,
they clearly didn\'t look at this and say, \"We shouldn\'t bother.\"

So that\'s one thing it does, but the other thing is even though it\'s
demonstrated to not work very well in the United States, we\'re not
saying, like, \"But here\'s the horizon. This is when it works like this
and it can tackle this threat, that\'s when we\'re done.\" So countries
like Russia and China who are thinking about their own nuclear pasture
and thinking about, \"How do we keep a deterrence balance with the
U.S.,\" they look at the missile defense and say, \"How do we
incorporate this into our decision-making?\"

And we can see that this provides an incentive for them to build more or
more sophisticated types of nuclear weapons that overcome missile
defenses, maybe not this particular system but where they think the U.S.
might be going. So what that does is increase the threats that we see
against us rather than trying to find a way to draw down these hugely
destructive nuclear weapons as an incentive to increase their
sophistication and their numbers. So we\'ll be paying a price for having
a missile defense system.

[You will pay that and also in the long-term future]{.underline} where
you\'re hoping that countries reduce the number of nuclear weapons, you
know, that will be a factor. So you have to balance what you think
you\'re getting out of it with the price you have to pay in terms of,
you know, the [[fooling yourselves into]{.mark} a [more dangerous
foreign policy]{.mark} or seeing more nuclear weapons aimed against
you]{.underline} and you have to try to overcome your missile defenses,
all sorts of things. You have to balance against what you\'ve decided to
build.

Colleen: Well, if there was one thing that you could make people
understand about weapons and missile defense, if you could just put this
thought into the minds of people, what would you want?

[Laura:]{.underline} Yeah. I guess what I would say is that the way you
should be thinking about missile defense is not that it solves this
problem and it doesn\'t even do a great job of making it less hard to
solve. You\'re still gonna have [to do the hard work of diplomacy to
find a real solution and real security for all actors]{.underline}. And
in fact, if you\'re not careful, [you might fool yourself into thinking
it does something more for you than it does, and it might actually be
harmful]{.underline}, you know, counter-intuitively. It [might [end up
making]{.mark} your [world more dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}.

My colleague says it this way, \"Missile defense often sounds better
after 30 seconds than it does after 3 minutes.\" [[It\'s]{.mark} really
[appealing]{.mark} to think that [we could]{.mark} build
something]{.underline} technologically [to [make ourselves
invulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}. I see the appeal of that, [[but
missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark} doesn\'t do that. It [doesn\'t
solve your problem]{.underline} for you. And in fact, [it might be [a
red herring and pull you off the hard task]{.mark} which is [dealing
with the root of the problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. So it doesn\'t save
your bacon, you need [to fix the problems
[diplomatically]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The Failed]{.underline} Experiment of the [GMD System]{.underline}

[[After twenty years of]{.mark} dedicated effort and]{.underline}
unconstrained [[funding]{.mark}, the [GMD]{.mark}
system['s]{.mark}]{.underline} readiness is [still [in
doubt]{.mark}]{.underline}. As of June 2021, the GMD system [has
[been]{.mark}]{.underline} flight-[[tested twenty times]{.mark}.85 [Even
under idealized]{.mark} test [conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
[[only]{.mark} about [50 percent]{.mark}]{.underline} of the attempts to
intercept targets [have [succeeded]{.mark}]{.underline}.86 Furthermore,
the first ten tests (with five successful intercepts) were conducted
using prototype interceptors or other surrogates that may not reflect
the abilities of the deployed interceptors. [The initial flight [tests
were]{.mark} conducted [with cued info]{.mark}rmation [rather
than]{.mark} information from the network of [sensors that would track
an]{.mark} incoming North Korean [ICBM]{.mark}]{.underline}.87 Several
[flight [tests]{.mark} were timed to [occur in]{.mark} the [daytime
and]{.mark} in [favorable weather]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby avoiding
the uncertainty of real-world conditions.88 Given these factors, [the
ability of the GMD]{.underline} system to now offer reliable defense
against North Korean ICBMs [has [caused]{.mark} even]{.underline} the
Joint Staff and other [[warfighters to question]{.mark} the
system's]{.underline} practical [[utility]{.underline}]{.mark}.89 In
addition to these shortcomings, debilitating programmatic failures and
conceptual [flaws have yet to be resolved]{.underline}.

Programmatic Failures: The Perpetual Search for a Kill Vehicle

[The GMD program [has yet to field a]{.mark} reliable [kill
vehicle]{.mark}]{.underline}. The first kill vehicle, the CE-I, was
deployed in 2004---three years before its first flight test.90
Similarly, the CE-II kill vehicle was deployed more than five years
before its first flight test.91 The decision to deploy these kill
vehicles as an operational system before testing not only weakened the
GMD system's reliability but also led to costly retrofits and delays.92
The MDA has since acknowledged that the CE-I and CE-II kill vehicle
designs were "costly to produce and sustain and require the warfighter
to fire more interceptors to overcome anticipated in-flight reliability
failures."93

In 2014, Frank Kendall, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition,
Technology, and Logistics, said [[the]{.mark} existing [CE-I and]{.mark}
CE-[II]{.mark} kill [vehicles]{.mark} were [plagued by "bad
engineering"]{.mark} because "there was a rush" to get something
out]{.underline}.94 He advocated for the development of a new and more
reliable kill vehicle. In 2014, the MDA began the Redesigned Kill
Vehicle (RKV) program to replace CE-I and CE-II kill vehicles.95

Learning from past mistakes, the MDA initially adopted a robust
development and deployment plan for the RKV program that included
rigorous testing and evaluation.96 But in October 2017, in response to
North Korean ICBM tests, these weapons acquisition best practices were
abandoned. The MDA was tasked with accelerating the RKV program by
"concurrently performing development and production and reducing the
number of necessary flight tests" to increase the number of deployed
interceptors from forty-four to sixty-four by 2023.97 The altered
deployment schedule forced [[the contractor]{.underline}]{.mark} to hire
several new personnel to work on the project and to [[use]{.mark}
"commercial [off]{.mark}-the-[shelf hardware]{.mark}]{.underline} and
re-use Aegis SM-3 Block IIA components," both of [which compromised
reliability]{.underline}.98 By 2018, the RKV program was over budget and
behind schedule, prompting the Department of Defense to terminate the
RKV program in August 2019 after determining that [its design
[flaws]{.mark} were [too severe]{.mark} to [be fixed quickly]{.mark} or
cheaply]{.underline}.99 Without an operable RKV, the plan to increase
the number of interceptors to sixty-four by 2023 is infeasible.100
Moreover, [the GMD]{.underline} system [will continue to operate with
CE-I and CE-II]{.underline} kill vehicles, further [eroding confidence
in its effectiveness]{.underline} in real-world conditions.101

We find that these failures are a result of the decisions to rush to
field the GMD system. The Bush administration empowered the MDA to
independently define system requirements, review its performance, and
establish and cancel programs without external review.102 The MDA was
also exempted from standard reporting and oversight on the program's
technological progress and cost increases.103 These exceptions allowed
the MDA to circumvent rigorous knowledge-based acquisition processes
that otherwise might have averted many of the [deficiencies]{.underline}
that [now plague the efforts to develop a kill vehicle]{.underline}.104
[The [next iteration]{.mark}]{.underline} of a kill vehicle, the
Next-Generation Interceptor (NGI), is estimated to cost \$18 billion and
[[is not]{.mark} expected to be [ready until]{.mark} the [late
2020s]{.mark}]{.underline}.105 [Even if a high-reliability interceptor
eventually emerges]{.underline} from the NGI program, [it must
overcome]{.underline} the enduring conceptual flaw of the GMD system:
[the countermeasures challenge]{.underline}.

Conceptual Flaw: The Countermeasures Challenge

Like all midcourse defense systems, the GMD system is vulnerable to
countermeasures.106 This vulnerability of midcourse missile defense
systems has long been well understood. Former Secretary of Defense James
Schlesinger, recounting the U.S. reaction to Soviet missile defense
deployments in the 1960s, writes that the Soviet deployment provoked
extensive research to defeat the Soviet defenses.107 In a short time,
the United States had developed a variety of countermeasures to confuse,
deceive, and evade Soviet missile defenses.108 [[A high-altitude]{.mark}
nuclear [detonation]{.mark} is a particularly effective]{.underline}
countermeasure.109 In the case of the GMD system, [North Korea could
detonate a warhead just [outside]{.mark} the [range of
GMD]{.mark}]{.underline} interceptors, warheads could be designed to
detonate upon interceptor impact, [or an intercept could lead to a
nuclear detonation]{.underline} of a warhead that is not one-point
safe.110 In all these three instances, [the resulting]{.underline}
nuclear [explosion [would ionize]{.mark}]{.underline} a large volume of
space, [making accurate [radar tracking]{.mark}]{.underline} of
follow-on warheads [impractical]{.underline}.111

[[Decoys remain]{.underline}]{.mark} a major, if not
[[insurmountable]{.underline}]{.mark}, countermeasure to the GMD system.
Decoys [[such as lightweight balloons]{.mark} follow the same flight
path]{.underline} as missile warheads in the vacuum of space, [making it
difficult to distinguish]{.underline} between decoy and warhead using
only their trajectories. Moreover, [hiding a warhead inside a
balloon]{.underline} (i.e., an anti-simulation decoy) [is an effective
countermeasure]{.underline}. As Richard Garwin writes, "it may be very
costly and difficult to make decoys which resemble in all observable
respects real warheads in space, but it becomes a lot easier if the
warhead is first modified or enclosed in a balloon so that it looks like
a cheap decoy."112 A 2010 study by the scientific advisory group, JASON,
conducted at the request of the U.S. Congress, concluded that "given a
reasonable amount of time, money, initiative, and expertise, the offense
can (in principle) field countermeasures that the defense cannot handle
at any reasonable marginal cost."113

[There is [no evidence]{.mark} to indicate that the [GMD]{.mark} system
has [overcome this]{.mark} challenge]{.underline}. Additionally, a 2019
GAO report found that [a "[culture exists within]{.mark} the \[[missile
defense]{.mark}\] agency [that]{.mark} generally [tolerates]{.mark} the
use of]{.underline} \[threat\] [[models]{.mark} that have [not]{.mark}
been sufficiently [vetted]{.mark}]{.underline}" and the agency "is too
willing to accept the associated risk."114 The report further noted that
the MDA restricts the DIA's "insight into and input on" developing
accurate threat models, even though it is uniquely capable of assisting
the MDA.115 Given these limitations, analysts question the GMD system's
ability to respond to countermeasures, unexpected launch scenarios, or
incomplete sensor data during an actual North Korean attack.116

Based on available evidence, we argue that [[there is no]{.mark} lasting
technical [solution]{.mark} to the countermeasures
challenge]{.underline}.117 North Korea might have access to Russian or
Chinese countermeasures, which are technologically mature and are
designed to breach the GMD system.118 Additionally, as long as it is
easier to refine countermeasures than to update the GMD system, any GMD
system refinements are unlikely to overcome this enduring conceptual
flaw.

Incorporating Missile Defense in Future Arms Control Agreements 

Currently, New START allows no more than 1,550 deployed strategic
nuclear warheads on intercontinental ballistic missiles,
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and heavy bombers equipped for
nuclear armaments (each such heavy bomber is counted as one warhead
toward this limit). These limits have been verifiably met for a decade
and can finally be used as a foundation for one of the treaty's original
purposes: to provide a new start to future arms control. 

[[Moscow --- and Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} for that matter ---
[[are]{.mark} legitimately [concerned about]{.mark} U.S.
[m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efenses']{.underline} future
[expansion]{.underline}. While U.S. missile defenses are meant to
protect against long-range missile threats from North Korea or, maybe in
the future, Iran, [efforts to stay ahead of rogue-state threats are
pushing the]{.underline} technological [envelope toward capabilities
that]{.underline}, if ever perfected, [[might]{.mark} [threaten]{.mark}
Moscow or Beijing's [confidence in]{.mark} their [nuclear
deterrents.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, it will be years before
technologies that would be of real concern to Russian and Chinese
deterrents are even adequately tested, and then still more years to full
development if they were ever proved reliable.

[As a first step to restore some trust]{.underline} in the bilateral
relationship, [Russia and [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should]{.mark} commit to [publicly explain]{.mark}ing [the role]{.mark}
of missile defenses [in]{.mark} their nuclear deterrent
[strategy]{.mark}, and [emphasizing]{.mark} that their missile defense
[systems do not target the other.]{.mark}]{.underline} This basic
understanding is not as clear to both parties as one might assume. Trump
muddied the water over the role of missile defenses in U.S. strategy
when he announced the 2019 Missile Defense Review saying, "Our goal is
simple: to ensure that we can detect and destroy any missile launched
against the United States --- anywhere, anytime, anyplace." Presumably,
this opened the door to using missile defense to defeat Russian
missiles. These concerns have been amplified since the phrase "strategic
stability" was stricken from the review, and Congress has given the
president even more flexibility to inflame tensions with nuclear
adversaries by eliminating the legislative language committing the
United States to seek only protection against limited (meaning rogue
state or accidental) strikes. [Acknowledging that missile defenses do
not target Moscow could go a long way to buttress strategic
stability.]{.underline}

[The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was]{.underline} in essence [an
admission that]{.underline} the concept of [missile defense
is]{.underline} in itself [destabilizing and likely to lead to an arms
race.]{.underline} Still, if the United States is unwilling to abandon
its expensive folly, [there are some who posit]{.underline} that
[[development in coop]{.mark}eration [with adversaries could
mitigate]{.mark}]{.underline} such [[danger.]{.mark} The]{.underline}
U.S. [National Academy of Sciences and]{.underline} the [Russian Academy
of Sciences]{.underline} recently [published a joint
report on]{.underline} the [technical feasibility]{.underline} of
ballistic missile defense cooperation. [The report finds that "far from
being destabilizing, cooperation on BMD]{.underline} \[ballistic missile
defense\] [may]{.underline} help [[improve]{.mark} overall [strategic
stability]{.mark}" and "]{.underline}some [forms of cooperation are
technically feasible, militarily beneficial to both]{.underline}
countries, [and a threat to neither."]{.underline} The key
recommendation from this joint effort: "[The United States
and]{.underline} the [Russian Federation should establish]{.underline},
as soon as political conditions permit, [joint information sharing of
missile defense data]{.underline} from satellites [and ground-based
radar systems]{.underline} through a dedicated information-sharing
center." While this idea may seem idealistic in the current political
climate, it is not dead on arrival.

Representatives from both countries plan to meet in "the coming weeks"
to discuss a U.S.-Russian summit. Further, the paperwork to implement
such an arrangement was actually drawn up in 1998 between Presidents
Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin. Any future cooperation could be modeled
on the proposed Joint Data Exchange Center, which could share militarily
significant data on detecting and tracking of third countries' ballistic
missiles. Cooperation could be feasible as joint U.S.-Russian and
NATO-Russian command post computer-based exercises were conducted even
after the U.S. withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
[Dialogue on this issue [would]{.mark} also allow Moscow to express its
concerns about U.S. plans and [remove a barrier to]{.mark} serious [arms
control]{.mark} discussions.]{.underline}

Time to Seize the Moment

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [might]{.mark} be able to get
Russia to [discuss nonstrategic nuclear forces without]{.mark} bringing
up [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efenses --- [but it's]{.mark} highly
[unlikely.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [Trump]{.underline} administration
[tried that approach and came up empty-handed.]{.underline} As recently
as May 17, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov repeated Moscow's
position, arguing, "Everything that affects strategic stability (nuclear
and non-nuclear arms, offensive and defensive weapons \[italics added\])
must be on the negotiating table. The Americans know our approach."

The [Biden]{.underline} administration [[should not give Russia an
excuse to walk away]{.mark} from the negotiating table by refusing to
discuss missile defense.]{.underline} There's no time to lose --- the
White House has a few years to try to negotiate an extremely complex
arms control agreement and figure out how to verify it. [By
demonstrating an [openness]{.mark} to addressing missile defenses in
strategic stability talks, the United States [will remove]{.mark} one of
Putin's [pretexts to evade]{.mark} serious [negotiations]{.mark} with
the Biden administration. This]{.underline} posture [will put the United
States in the driver's seat.]{.underline}

## A2 China Add On

### No China Threat

#### There is no China threat in the Arctic -- it has no military presence 

**Bekkeold and Hilde 24** \[Jo Inge, senior China fellow at the
Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies and Paal Sigurd, professor at
the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, "The New U.S. Arctic
Strategy is Wrong to Focus on China," Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/11/us-arctic-strategy-china-russia-alaska-geopolitics/>,
ALB\]

[The U.S. Defense Department]{.underline}'s latest Arctic strategy,
issued in July, [clearly states that China is not an Arctic nation, yet
it identifies China as the main challenge to U.S. interests in the
region]{.underline}. [This is the first time the Pentagon officially
placed China front and center of its approach to the
Arctic]{.underline}. China was not even mentioned in its 2013 Arctic
strategy and only once in the 2016 version. In the 2019 version, under
the first Trump administration, China was given a more prominent
position---but not as a primary emphasis. The 2024 strategy thus
reflects China's status as the pacing challenge to U.S. national
security worldwide. With the second Trump administration expected to
double down on the U.S.-China strategic rivalry, this reframing of
Arctic policy will likely be continued or even accelerated.

[In the context of the U.S.-China superpower rivalry]{.underline}, [it
is]{.underline} natural and [understandable that China features
prominently in U.S. strategic thinking]{.underline} and policies on
various topics and regions around the world. [Nonetheless, it is widely
acknowledged that]{.underline} [global]{.underline} and regional [power
balances may differ]{.underline}. [This means that]{.underline} [even
though]{.underline} [China is now the pacing challenge for U.S. national
security]{.underline} at large, [its power and ability to threaten U.S.
interests varies from one region to another]{.underline}. And indeed,
[the Arctic power structure differs from the global one]{.underline},
not least due to Russia's dominant position.

At its core, the United States' new Arctic strategy prioritizes Alaska
as a strategic flank in its rivalry with China. Alaska has played an
important role in U.S. national security since the start of the Cold
War. It hosts aerospace warning and control systems important to U.S.
homeland defense, and, in recent years, the state has become integral to
the execution of U.S. operations in the Indo-Pacific theater.

Nevertheless, [the Pentagon's strong focus on the U.S.-China rivalry in
its Arctic strategy has two potential pitfalls]{.underline}.

First, [by identifying China as the main threat to U.S. interests in the
Arctic, the Pentagon's new strategy contributes to enhancing a somewhat
skewed narrative of the threat China actually poses there. While some
commentators portray China as a "polar great power" attempting to push
its way into the Arctic---and as Beijing runs highly visible Arctic
diplomacy]{.underline}---[the reality is that China currently has very
limited political, economic, and military influence there]{.underline}.

[Whereas the U.S. strategy observes that China "seeks to promote the
Arctic region as a 'global commons,'" the Arctic is neither unclaimed
nor ungoverned]{.underline}. The United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (UNCLOS) constitutes not only the legal basis on which the
Arctic littoral states can claim sovereign rights to most of the Arctic
Ocean (this includes the United States, despite its failure to ratify
the treaty), but also a core of the governance regime covering the
region.

[Beijing's ability to use bilateral channels to enhance its influence is
also limited because four of the five are strong democracies and NATO
members]{.underline}---and that number increases to seven out of eight
if the entire Arctic Council (made up the five littoral states plus
Finland, Iceland, and Sweden) is included. [It is difficult to see any
Arctic nation beyond Russia being keen on enabling China to gain a
strong foothold in the region]{.underline}. Indeed, [evidence suggests
that the Arctic democracies have all become increasingly aware and wary
of Chinese overtures.]{.underline} For instance, when rumors surfaced in
September that local Norwegian authorities welcomed Chinese investors in
the Arctic port of Kirkenes, Norwegian Minister of Justice and Public
Security Enger Mehl quickly clarified that Oslo will not allow such an
investment if it runs counter to national security interests. Similarly,
China has failed to entice Iceland and Greenland---both of which are
often seen as particularly vulnerable to the lure of large Chinese
investments.

In fact, most of China's attempts at investing in Arctic resources
outside Russia have been put on hold or have failed altogether. Even in
the Russian Arctic, China's economic footprint is relatively limited
beyond its engagement in the Yamal liquefied natural gas project.
Moreover, China's ambition for a so-called Polar Silk Road through the
Arctic Ocean has yet to result in any substantial shipment of goods
through Arctic waters.

[Regarding military activities]{.underline}, which is the Pentagon's
main concern, [China has no military presence in the Arctic beyond brief
visits]{.underline}. Chinese icebreaking research vessels occasionally
operate in the Arctic Ocean, and some of their research activities may
indeed have military value. In early October, Chinese Coast Guard
vessels sailed into the Arctic Ocean for the first time on a joint
patrol with two Russian Border Service ships. It will take more than a
couple of icebreakers and coast guard vessels to make China a military
player in the Arctic.

[Wider research activity by China in the Arctic, which members of the
U.S. Congress drew attention to recently, clearly may have a dual-use or
purely military purpose]{.underline}. [Yet this should also be kept in
perspective]{.underline}. [While the Chinese Polar Research Institute
has a]{.underline} [presence]{.underline} in Ny Alesund on Svalbard, a
Norwegian archipelago, and on Iceland, [this is a minor
engagement]{.underline} compared to its five independent research
stations in Antarctica. [Moreover, China's lack of military presence and
activity in the Arctic obviously reduces the military value of any
dual-use research]{.underline}. This is clearly the case for the land
and sea domains, but perhaps less clear-cut with regard to aerospace
activities.

"hot-swappable" missile system start an accidental nuclear war?" April

<https://thebulletin.org/2022/04/could-chinas-hot-swappable-missile-system-start-an-accidental-nuclear-war/>

In the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission's most recent
[annual
report](https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/Chapter_3_Section_2--Chinas_Nuclear_Forces_Moving_beyond_a_Minimal_Deterrent.pdf)
to Congress, the commission suggested that the DF-26 Chinese missile
system presents a unique escalatory threat in a potential conflict
between China and the United States. The DF-26, which has a range of
approximately [4,000
kilometers](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Sep/01/2002488689/-1/-1/1/2020-DOD-CHINA-MILITARY-POWER-REPORT-FINAL.PDF),
is a dual-capable,
"[hot-swappable](https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1209405/chinas-df-26-a-hot-swappable-missile/)"
system: The missile can carry either a conventional or a nuclear
warhead, and warheads can be quickly swapped on launch-ready missiles.
Ever since its public debut in
[2015](https://www.andrewerickson.com/2015/12/academy-of-military-science-researchers-why-we-had-to-develop-the-dongfeng-26-ballistic-missile-bilingual-text-analysis-links/),
the DF-26's nuclear role has attracted significant attention from
experts in the field. Some have suggested that using these missiles may
lead to accidental nuclear escalation between China and the United
States. The [worry is that the United States might see an incoming salvo
of DF-26s and assume they are loaded with nuclear warheads]{.underline}.
The American leadership might then decide to retaliate with nuclear
weapons of its own, not knowing that the Chinese missiles are actually
carrying conventional warheads. Other analysts have argued that
[pre-launch
ambiguity](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/Acton_NukeorNot_final.pdf)
may contribute to unintended escalation. However, upon closer
examination, [[nuclear escalation is not]{.mark} as [likely]{.mark} [as
some believe]{.mark}]{.underline}. **The US response to incoming
DF-26s.** [[Modern early-warning systems are capable of
calculating]{.mark} the [trajectory and]{.mark} [potential
]{.mark}]{.underline}[[impact
points]{.mark}](https://www.afspc.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/1126401/upgraded-early-warning-radars/)
[for incoming warheads]{.underline}. In the case of a Chinese missile
attack against US forces in the Indo-Pacific region, the [United States
would be able to identify incoming DF-26s as intermediate-range
ballistic missiles heading toward US military bases located in the
Pacific, rather than intercontinental ballistic missiles heading to the
US homeland.]{.underline} Even if the Chinese missiles were loaded with
nuclear warheads, these warheads would not hit major US population
centers or reduce the effectiveness of US nuclear forces. [[US]{.mark}
[decision makers]{.mark} would [not have much to lose by waiting]{.mark}
until the missiles detonate before launching a
counterattack]{.underline}. On the other hand, [immediately launching a
nuclear strike against China would likely result in a nuclear war that
neither side wishes to fight]{.underline}. The [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates also [has]{.mark} a [very survivable sea-based
deterrent]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [significantly more]{.mark}
[nucl]{.mark}ear [warheads than China]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would be
[[nearly impossible for China to disarm the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [in a first strike]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even if
American leaders were convinced that China was launching a nuclear
strike against the United States, they would not have to immediately
retaliate, as long as they were confident about US second-strike
capabilities]{.underline}. Also, assets that are especially vulnerable
to a first strike could be evacuated and dispersed to avoid destruction.
For example, the United States could immediately scramble strategic
bombers carrying nuclear weapons, to avoid losing them on the ground.
These measures can ensure that the United States does not have to launch
an immediate retaliation even when under threat, reducing the
possibility of an accidental nuclear war. **The Chinese response to a US
attack.** [[Some experts]{.mark}]{.underline} [have
[suggested]{.mark}](https://thediplomat.com/2017/08/meet-the-df-31ag-and-the-df-26-the-big-ballistic-missiles-at-chinas-military-anniversary-parade/)
[another type of [scenario]{.mark}, [in which]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would fire conventional weapons]{.mark}
at China's DF-26 launchers in an attempt to neutralize a conventional
attack [on Guam]{.mark}.]{.underline} [China might see such an attack as
a direct threat to its nuclear deterrent. [This could]{.mark}
[drive]{.mark} Chinese leaders to launch a [nuc]{.mark}lear
[retaliation]{.mark} [under]{.mark} the "us[e it or lose it"
mentality]{.mark}. [Yet, upon]{.mark} [closer examination, such an idea
is flawed]{.mark}.]{.underline} First, [[China is not reliant on]{.mark}
the [DF-26]{.mark} weapon system [for]{.mark} its [nucl]{.mark}ear
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. The intermediate-range DF-26 is
arguably less important than intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs), such as the DF-41, in maintaining a credible deterrent against
the United States. This is reflected in the number of warheads deployed
with each type of missile. While the exact number of nuclear warheads
allocated to DF-26 units remains unknown, [it is
estimated](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2021-11/nuclear-notebook-chinese-nuclear-forces-2021/)
that China has only deployed 60 out of some 350 total warheads with its
intermediate-range force. It is therefore unlikely for China to worry
about the credibility of its nuclear deterrent against the United
States, as long as its ICBMs remain survivable and effective.
Furthermore, [China's nuclear warheads are]{.underline} [deployed
separately](https://armscontrolcenter.org/fact-sheet-chinas-nuclear-arsenal/)
[from its launch systems. The warheads are stored in]{.underline}
[underground
bases](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/chinas-underground-great-wall-subterranean-ballistic-missiles)
[and are only mated with their delivery systems in preparation for a
strike]{.underline}. Warheads may also be dispersed and hidden within
these large underground complexes to avoid destruction during a first
strike. A [conventional strike against missile launch vehicles on the
ground is unlikely to damage nuclear warheads stored
underground]{.underline}. In the worst-case scenario, in which a small
number of nuclear warheads are accidentally destroyed by the United
States during a conventional strike, the [Chinese nuclear deterrent
would remain credible if it is able to inflict unacceptable losses on
the United States in a nuclear exchange]{.underline}. Finally, it [is
unlikely that the United States would accidentally hit Chinese ICBM
launchers when trying to hit DF-26s.]{.underline} DF-26 brigades are
separate from other types of Chinese [missile
brigades](https://thebulletin.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Kristensen-Korda_Nov-Dec-China-Table2_final.pdf).
ICBMs such as the DF-31 and DF-41 are also much larger than DF-26s. They
do not share a common launch vehicle and can be identified more easily.
Operationally, [it is unlikely that China would intentionally disguise
its ICBM launchers as intermediate-range missile launchers, knowing that
the United States would likely target the latter in a conventional
conflict]{.underline}. [[In]{.mark} the [worst-case scenario]{.mark},
[in which]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [accidentally hits
Chinese]{.mark} [ICBM vehicles]{.mark}, [it is unlikely]{.mark} that [an
accidental strike would be big enough]{.mark} [to]{.mark} neutralize all
[Chinese second-strike assets]{.mark} immediately. China's]{.underline}
[silo-based
missiles](https://fas.org/blogs/security/2021/11/a-closer-look-at-chinas-missile-silo-construction/)
[and nuclear submarines would also survive. [There]{.mark} [would be no
need]{.mark} [for China to]{.mark} [immediately launch a nuc]{.mark}lear
[retaliation]{.mark}.]{.underline} In short, [[DF-26s do not generate
additional]{.mark} [instability]{.mark} in the current deterrence
relationship between China and the United State]{.underline}s.
[[Launching conventional attacks]{.mark} with or against these missiles
[is unlikely to result]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [accidental nuc]{.mark}lear
[escalation]{.mark}. The [dual-use nature]{.mark} of DF-26s [is unlikely
to]{.mark} [significantly change]{.mark} the [US strategic
calculus]{.mark} when considering a conventional strike against these
launchers.]{.underline}

#### No US-China war\-\--mountains of [domestic barriers]{.underline} and lack of [capabilities]{.underline}.

Competition,\" in Great Power Competition as the New Normal of China--US
Relations, Chapter 8, 2023, pg. 215-225.

Even if China is willing to fulfill its mission by launching a war with
the U.S., [can [China]{.mark}]{.underline} [afford it]{.underline}?
First, [the top Chinese leader [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [[not ready for
war]{.underline}]{.mark} [with U.S]{.underline}. [China
will]{.underline} [not]{.underline} [be able to take a risk]{.underline}
[without]{.underline} internal [coordination and support]{.underline}.
The voice of China's foreign policy comes from different departments.
[They are]{.underline} [[not]{.mark} well
[coordinated]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and lack]{.mark} a]{.underline}
[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} with a long-term vision. [China does not
have a]{.underline} [system]{.underline} [for]{.underline} making
[consistent and workable foreign policy]{.underline}, and the top leader
has not gained sufficient power to manage foreign relations. [China is
[facing a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[mountain of domestic
problems]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} [corruption]{.underline}
[in the military]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [Chinese
government]{.underline} has [learned the lesson]{.underline} that [a
combination of internal violence and external conflict can contribute to
the]{.underline} [collapse]{.underline} [of the regime]{.underline}. Now
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [is]{.underline} more [likely to
[focus on]{.mark} China's]{.underline} [domestic]{.underline} [issues
especially [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[pandemic]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [its [consequences in]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[economic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [financial]{.underline}
[areas]{.underline}]{.mark}. Xi's [top priority]{.underline} before the
20th Congress of the CCP [is to]{.underline} carefully [manage
the]{.underline} [power balance]{.underline} [among factions in the
party]{.underline}, attempting to ensure his third term of presidency.
After the 20th Congress, Xi will take some time to reorganize the system
and put new policies in place. It is [not wise for the CCP to
take]{.underline} [military risks]{.underline} [in dealing with
territorial disputes with various countries at the same time as it tries
to maintain]{.underline} [domestic]{.underline} [social
stability]{.underline}. China cannot afford to fight against multiple
countries at the same time because [the [U.S. has]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[military treaties]{.underline}]{.mark} [with several allies in the
region]{.underline}. [[Taking military action]{.mark}s
[could]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [[destroy]{.underline} [Xi's China
Dream]{.underline}]{.mark}, his lifelong
[[presidency]{.underline}]{.mark}, his [domestic [agenda
and]{.mark}]{.underline} China's [global [ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}
eventually. Considering all these challenges, [Chinese
leaders]{.underline} may [continue]{.underline} their [efforts
to]{.underline} [rebalance]{.underline} [the relationship between China
and the U.S. while boosting]{.underline} the [economic
growth]{.underline} and preparing the unification with Taiwan after the
20th National Congress of the CCP in 2022.

Second, [China]{.underline} has [understood]{.underline} that [any
conflict]{.underline} between China and the U.S. [would be
a]{.underline} [global]{.underline} [disaster]{.underline}, especially
between the two nuclear powers.78 A war between the two giants is
unthinkable.79 It could be a Third World War if the U.S. had a war with
China.80 China now has 260 nuclear weapons in its stockpile, while the
U.S. has 4670 or more. [[China]{.mark} promised that it would [implement
a]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}o
[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}irst [[u]{.underline}]{.mark}se" nuclear
[policy]{.underline}, implying that the country possesses nuclear
weapons only to deter other states from a nuclear attack and expresses
the purely self-defensive nature of China's nuclear strategy. More
fundamentally, [it has demonstrated a]{.underline} viable [path
toward]{.underline} international [nuclear disarmament]{.underline}.81
Many China experts "appear not to be worried by China's rapidly growing
nuclear capabilities, because [Beijing's official policy
promises]{.underline} that [China will not be the]{.underline}
[first]{.underline} [to employ nuclear weapons in a
conflict]{.underline}. Beijing promises that its nuclear forces are for
deterrence and retaliation only, not for aggression."82 However, China
continues to develop its nuclear weapons. China is likely to double the
size of its nuclear stockpile in a few years.83 U.S. military leaders
are not as naïve as academics about China's "no first use" pledge.
Charles Richard, chief of U.S. Strategic Command, testified to the
Senate Armed Services Committee that he could "drive a truck through
China's 'no first use' policy, because China's unprecedented rapid
expansion of its nuclear and missile capabilities is not consistent with
a belief in 'minimum deterrence' and 'no first use.'"84 In January 2022,
five global nuclear powers who are the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, the U.S., the UK, Russia, China, and France, signed a
joint statement and agreed to prevent nuclear weapons from spreading and
to ensure a nuclear war would not happen. The agreement itself is a
positive sign, indicating that nuclear deterrence is working and there
will be no massive war between China and the U.S.85 Practically, it is
hard to trust a dictator's words. In March 2022, Putin already put
nuclear deterrent forces on high alert and attacked Europe's largest
nuclear plant just a month after Russia signed the joint statement.

Third, [the Chinese [economy and military]{.mark} are]{.underline} [[not
strong enough]{.underline}]{.mark} [to support war]{.underline} with the
U.S. China will unlikely enter to war if it cannot win because [the
CCP]{.underline} [cannot]{.underline} [afford a loss]{.underline}. China
will wage war when it sees itself winning at least cost. China is the
fastest-growing economy in the world but [there are many]{.underline}
more [statistics that]{.underline} come to the front of arguments, which
[question the]{.underline} size of the [Chinese]{.underline} economy and
its actual [economic]{.underline} [situation]{.underline}. The economic
and social [consequences of]{.underline} [zero-case]{.underline}
[tolerance policy are]{.underline} clearly [serious and
far-reaching]{.underline}. China is still a developing country. [China
does]{.underline} [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} [rank [among the 100
richest]{.mark} nations]{.underline} based on [[per
capita]{.underline}]{.mark}. Among 1.4 billion people, about 50% of
Chinese people live in rural areas, 400 million people live on less than
\$2 a day, and 200 million people live on less than a dollar per day.
Even if China will continue its economic growth for years, [it
may]{.underline} [never]{.underline} [surpass the U.S. because it
faces]{.underline} [many obstacles]{.underline}.86 [[U.S. military
spending grows]{.mark} as]{.underline} [policy shifts]{.underline}
[[to]{.mark} "prioritize China" with]{.underline} [\$[813]{.mark}.3
[billion]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2022 [while [China's]{.mark} military
spending has reached]{.underline} [\$[230]{.mark} billion]{.underline}
in 2022. China's military budget is only about 28% of the U.S. The PLA
has approximately 975,000 active-duty personnel, the largest navy in the
world with an overall battle force of approximately 355 ships and
submarines, the largest aviation force in the region and the third
largest in the world, with over 2800 total aircraft of which
approximately 2250 are combat aircraft. China develops new
intercontinental ballistic missiles, continues to increase its inventory
of road-mobile DF-26 intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBM), and
has its first operational hypersonic weapons system, the DF-17
hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), and medium-range ballistic missile
(MRBM). China is determined to build a "world-class" military by the end
of 2049.87 However, [the]{.underline} [[comprehensive]{.underline}
[power]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the PLA]{.underline} still [[lags far
behind]{.mark} the U.S.]{.underline} [If China learned a lesson
from]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline}'s failures in the invasion of
Ukraine, [it should never take on the U.S. head even when fully
modernized]{.underline}. Although China's navy, ground troop, and air
forces have developed rapidly in the past two decades,
[[considering]{.mark} the]{.underline} [[quality]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [overall strength]{.underline}]{.mark} [of the
military, [as well as]{.mark} the strength of military
[alliances]{.mark}, China would]{.underline} [lose]{.underline} [the war
if it launched a war with the U.S.]{.underline} Any war with the U.S.
will be near its shores where [the U.S. will have a]{.underline}
[decisive]{.underline} [winning advantage]{.underline}.88

Fourth, [China will feel]{.underline} [difficult]{.underline} [to
justify a war]{.underline} with U.S. Military strength is the basis for
consideration if China goes to war. [If China's military power is at
an]{.underline} absolute [advantage]{.underline}, [it]{.underline} still
[lacks the]{.underline} [pre-conditions]{.underline} [for war with the
U.S.]{.underline} If China's military power evenly matches with the
U.S., it should be cautious about starting a war. China has not arrived
at the stage to initiate a war. Military power is not simply about
military budget and weapons. [Real]{.underline} war
[experience]{.underline} [must be taken into consideration]{.underline}.
[China does not have real]{.underline} military [experience to win
a]{.underline} [modern]{.underline} [war]{.underline} with the U.S.
After the establishment of the PRC, China went to conventional war
several times, including the Korean War, the war with India (1967), and
the Vietnam War (1979). It cannot rule out that China will follow the
same pattern to go to war in the future. However, the Iraq war and the
2022 War between Russia and Ukraine indicate that contemporary war is
completely different from traditional war. Chinese military power is
untested in the contemporary military war. Moreover, the CCP has not
faced an immediate military threat from the U.S. Military experts'
[research projects on when and why Beijing]{.underline} [uses
force]{.underline} have [reached a]{.underline} [similar]{.underline}
[conclusion]{.underline}: [[China attacks not when]{.mark} it
feels]{.underline} [[confident]{.underline}]{.mark} about the future,
[[but when it]{.underline} [worries]{.underline}]{.mark} [its [enemies
are closing in]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thomas Christensen, the director of
the China and the World Program at Columbia University, points out that
the Chinese Communist Party wages war when it perceives an opening
window of vulnerability regarding its territory and immediate periphery,
or a closing window of opportunity to consolidate control over disputed
areas. This [pattern holds]{.underline} [regardless]{.underline} [of the
strength of China's opponent]{.underline}.89 The [Biden]{.underline}
Administration has [made it clear]{.underline} that [the U.S. does not
intend to change the Chinese regime]{.underline} while competing with
China on various fronts. When China does not face a direct military
threat from the U.S., [the CCP does not have]{.underline}
[reason]{.underline} [to take risk of going to war]{.underline}.

Fifth, [it could be [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [[suicide]{.underline}
[mission]{.underline}]{.mark} [if China decided [to go to
war]{.mark}]{.underline} with the U.S. before improving its military
quality. [The]{.underline} [quality of]{.underline} military
[commanders]{.underline} [is the key]{.underline} to win or defeat in
wars. The quality of fighters and the wisdom of commanders are
inseparable. Wise commanders should be capable of planning and deploying
a variety of plans before the war starts. Even if Chinese military power
cannot match the U.S. as long as they can carry out military strikes at
a right time and at a favorable location, China can still win. Overall,
[Chinese military commanders]{.underline} [do not]{.underline}
[possess]{.underline} such a [quality]{.underline}. Soldier qualities
include military skills and knowledge, actual combat and decision-making
capabilities, physical endurance, and psychological qualities. Since the
war between China and Vietnam in 1979, China has been no war with other
countries for more than 40 years. China's active military personnel grew
up in peacetime and enlisted in a peaceful environment. During the forty
years of reform and opening-up period, the military is inevitably
influenced by the peaceful lifestyle. [Although China]{.underline} has
[dramatically]{.underline} [increased military expenditures and speeded
up]{.underline} its [military modernization, the PLA obviously
[lacks]{.mark}]{.underline} [[sufficient actual]{.underline}]{.mark}
combat [[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}, [involving the integration of
sea, land, and air battles]{.underline}. In recent years, China has
tried to improve its military combat effectiveness, but [the Chinese
military has a]{.underline} [long way to catch up]{.underline}
[[with]{.mark} the [U.S.' experience]{.mark} of real war]{.underline}.
The one-child policy seriously affects the quality of the military.
China's active military personnel have grown up in a relatively superior
environment, and men will be particularly favored regardless of whether
they come from the city or the countryside, so they lack self-care
ability, communication skills, patience, and endurance. Their personal
character is very fragile and is likely to collapse on the battlefield.

Sixth, the morale of the Chinese army is low. The [morale of the army is
the]{.underline} [spiritual pillar]{.underline} [in the
war]{.underline}; morale makes the war invincible under certain
conditions; and the army would be a mess without morale. Morale is not
an empty political slogan, but it is courage and determination when they
face the enemy. Morale is not injected by propaganda but is nurtured by
faith and the example of officers and actual interests. Under the
one-party system and the rigid censorship system, [Chinese
soldiers]{.underline} like all Chinese citizens [have been]{.underline}
[brainwashed]{.underline} [by communist ideas]{.underline}. The
[injected]{.underline} so-called [communist belief]{.underline} [without
faith could be]{.underline} [suddenly]{.underline} [collapsed during a
real war in a real world]{.underline}. In addition, China's [corruption
is]{.underline} [systematic]{.underline}, [and the military
is]{.underline} [no exception]{.underline} [from the top to the
bottom]{.underline} of the military system. By January 2015, sixteen
senior military officers were under investigation for accusations of
corruption. These officers are at the corps level or above. They include
one general, four lieutenant generals, nine major generals, and one
senior colonel. After Xu Caihou, former vice-chairman of the Central
Military Commission, was caught in 2014, the CPC began to investigate
Guo Boxiong in 2015, the second former top military officer on suspicion
of corruption. Fang Fenghui, China's military chief of staff was jailed
for life for corruption in 2019. Military corruption deadly threatens
China's security and degrades China's military capability in protecting
its nation. One of the causes of the Nationalist government's defeat was
corruption, which destroyed the morale of the military. [Chinese
[soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline} have [witnessed]{.underline} [systematic
corruption]{.underline} in the post-Mao era, [so they [will not]{.mark}
be willing to]{.underline} [[sacrifice]{.underline}
[for]{.underline}]{.mark} [corrupted [Chinese]{.mark} military
[leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. To regain morale, China must reform its
political system, clean up corrupted military officials, change the
compulsory military service system, and improve Chinese soldiers'
salaries and benefits.

Seventh, [[peaceful resolution to]{.underline}]{.mark} [resolve
territorial [disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} [[remains the first
choice]{.mark} for]{.underline} [both]{.underline} [sides]{.underline}.
The goal of diplomacy is to persuade your enemy to surrender without a
fight. A weak country does not have diplomacy. National comprehensive
power determines diplomatic confidence; and military power and popular
support provide the precondition for winning war. If a country's
comprehensive power is insufficient, it can only deal with territory
disputer through unequal diplomacy. If the military is powerful and the
people's aspirations are strong, military force deterrence should
cooperate with diplomatic means. If a country is not ready, it must not
advocate war. Otherwise, the government would lose its credibility at
home and abroad. [[China and]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}
still [[have]{.underline} [sufficient]{.underline}]{.mark} [time to
take]{.underline} [[diplomatic measures]{.underline}]{.mark} [to fulfill
their mission]{.underline} [without]{.underline} [any cost]{.underline}.
In addition, a [possible war over the]{.underline} [S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [and]{.underline} the
[Taiwan]{.underline} Strait [is not a conventional land war but sea-air
warfare]{.underline}. [If war occurs]{.underline} over the region, [the
U.S.]{.underline} [superiority]{.underline} [in the]{.underline}
[ASB]{.underline} [is still absolute and China's military attempts
would]{.underline} [fail]{.underline} although China has massive ground
troops and the largest size of navy force in the world.

Eighth, [Russia]{.underline} could be a negative equity for China on the
global stage and [will]{.underline} [not help China]{.underline} [win
war with the U.S. after]{.underline} Russian invasion of
[Ukraine]{.underline}. [[China has]{.underline}]{.mark} very [[few
allies]{.underline}]{.mark} [whereas American allies in the Pacific
include]{.underline} [Japan]{.underline}, [Australia]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea. While China
is losing its neighboring friends, [the U.S. has been]{.underline}
[strengthening]{.underline} [its alliance with China's neighboring
countries]{.underline}, including Japan, South Korea, the Philippines,
Afghanistan, and India. [Other countries, such as]{.underline}
[Vietnam]{.underline}, [Malaysia]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[Myanmar]{.underline} [are drawing closer]{.underline} to the U.S. The
Chinese government views the regional tension as the outcome of
Washington's "returning to Asia" policy. Under this circumstance, [China
needs]{.underline} [help]{.underline} from Russia [to avoid escalating
confrontations]{.underline} with multiple neighboring countries. In a
global context, Russia has played a considerable role in China--U.S.
relations since the Cold War. The recent development of China--Russia
relations has once again raised American concerns about the implications
of Beijing--Moscow relations. Many experts believe that China's motive
for deepening its relations with Russia is anti-America. According to
the joint statement between Russia and China released before the 2022
Beijing Winter Olympic Games, the two countries' relationship has no
limits and there are no forbidden areas. Now there are two parallel
geopolitical conflicts---the Ukraine--Russia war and China--U.S. tension
over the Taiwan Strait. After Russia invaded Ukraine, Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi reaffirmed that the China--Russia partnership is solid
as stone and the Sino-Russian partnership continues, no matter how
serious the international situation is. China's current stance seems
that China has fully thrown itself into a de facto alliance with Russia.

China and Russia are almost impossible to form a solid partnership.
Superficially, the top leaders of the two countries can get along but
their personal relationship cannot be automatically translated into
foreign policy and military alliances. The restoration of the friendship
between Beijing and Moscow is mainly driven by their domestic pressures
and security concerns. A stable relationship between the two countries
will relieve the financial burdens in support of the hostility along the
sizeable border. Beijing and Moscow also have common interests to work
together. Beijing demands more oil and natural gas from Russia and needs
more advanced military weapons supplies, including submarines, warships,
and aircraft. Russia wants more investments from China to speed up the
development of the Russian economy. Arguably, China does not really need
military technologies from Russia. For example, the Chinese J-20 fighter
is more advanced than Su-35, equivalent to Russia's T50 and the U.S.
F-22. The purpose of China to purchase 24 Su-35 is not to bridge the gap
between Chinese and U.S. military power, but to show its sincerity to
consolidate its ties with Russia by offering economic incentives.
Strategically, they believe that the two nations face similar strategic
challenge posed by the U.S. and its allies: NATO expansion for Russia
and the U.S. conflicts with China over the Taiwan Strait. On the global
stage, they stand against American hegemony with sovereignty and
non-intervention as their core values.90

China's quick move closer to Russia has not convinced the Russian people
to believe that China is trustworthy in part because of the
inconsistency of Chinese foreign policy. China aligned with Russia in
the 1950s and with the U.S. in the 1970s but implemented a nonaligned
policy in the 1980s. In recent years, the Russian protests against the
Chinese economic invasion have taken place from time to time. The most
recent Russian protests took place in March 2019, which were triggered
by a China-funded project to bottle water from Russia's Lake Baikal that
has caused environmental problems and made Russian people very angry.
The Russian protests indicate that the China--Russia tie is fragile.91
China's move closer to Russia has received a lukewarm response from
public opinion in China. The Chinese people also have reasons to doubt
Moscow's sincerity. China is not happy that Russia has maintained close
military ties with and sold advanced weapons to India and Vietnam, both
are locked in territorial disputes with China.92 From a historical
perspective, Russia occupied China's territories totaling more than four
million square kilometers from 1689 to 1898, forced China to sign the
Yalta Agreement for recognizing Outer Mongolia as an independent country
in the 1940s, and stopped all financial and technological aid during the
Chinese economic crisis in the 1960s. Finally, Zhen Bao Island military
conflict in Heilongjiang Province broke out in 1969. Although in 1991
Russia acknowledged that the island belonged to China, the tension
between the two countries along the 2500 miles long border remained high
until the Chinese military troops retreated 500 km in 2008. In addition,
China cannot forget that Russia took the territories in northeast China
more than 100 years ago. On 2 July 2020, the Russian embassy in Beijing
posted a video of a party celebrating the 160th anniversary of the
founding of Vladivostok, which means "ruler of the east" in Russian and
was annexed from China by the Tsarist empire in 1860. The video reminded
the Chinese emotions over historic wounds and prompted an online
backlash with the posts such as "Today we can only endure, but the
Chinese people will remember!" "This ancestral land will return home in
the future!"93 In comparison with China--U.S. relations, the U.S. never
had a single territory dispute with China, so the Chinese people have
not had a similar historical complex toward the U.S. The mutual distrust
between China and Russia partially explains why Chinese students do not
enthusiastically choose to study in Russia. According to Russian media,
in 2020, only about 48,000 Chinese students studied in Russian
universities while 20,000 Russian students were in Chinese
universities.94 By contrast, more than 317,000 Chinese students enrolled
in U.S. institutions in 2020/21 regardless of Covid-19 spread across the
country. The list of other favorite destinations for Chinese students
does not include Russia, but Britain, Australia, Canada, Japan, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, and South Korea. As a result,
Russian culture has little impact on Chinese society and intellectual
circle while American culture is very popular in China. The future of
Sino-Russia relations will be tested by public opinion in both
countries. It is expected that it would be difficult for both countries
to continue drawing closer without the support of the public opinion.

For now, the status of Sino-Russia relations is not a full-fledged
alliance, but a quasi-alliance. It seems that China and Russia are
closer than ever. Although a close relationship between China and Russia
could help China to get more advantage in bargaining with the U.S. to
smoothly solve its territorial disputes with neighboring countries, in
the long run, [[China will]{.mark} gain]{.underline} less but [[lose
more]{.underline} [in the]{.underline}]{.mark} [great power
[competition]{.mark} when China moves]{.underline} [closer to
Russia]{.underline}. Moscow and Beijing are on their honeymoon now, but
it may not last long. On the one hand, China's initial move closer to
Russia reflects that Chinese leaders lack confidence in dealing with
potential regional crises alone. Beijing does not necessarily have the
intention to save Russia, but it must save the Putin's regime in order
to retain Xi Jinping's power and the one-party system. On the other
hand, Russia will not satisfy with its lower position under Xi's
umbrella after Russia becomes significantly weaker because of the
failures of Putin's war with Ukraine. Russian ambassador already made it
clear that Russia does not seek an alliance with China. If China
unilaterally pursued the goal, the result would be poor. Therefore, it
is un-matured to predict that China and Russia will become alliances in
a decade. According to Schell-Shirk China Task Force, "China's alignment
is not set in stone. There are significant ways in which China's
long-term national interests are not, in fact, aligned with Russia's,
and deft U.S. diplomacy might still be able to find ways to temper
Beijing's alliance with Moscow."95 In the long term, Beijing and Moscow
might have more potential conflicts than cooperation and could become
main competitors or rivals down the road. [It is]{.underline} [not
wise]{.underline} [for Chinese leaders to]{.underline}
[distance]{.underline} themselves [from the U.S. by]{.underline}
[overplaying]{.underline} [the "Russian card."]{.underline} Essentially,
[China--[U.S. relations]{.mark} will [continue to be
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[top priority]{.underline} [of
China]{.underline}]{.mark}['s foreign policy]{.underline}, when the CCP
carefully balances the triangle relations between China and the U.S. and
Russia.

## Warming Turn

#### Arctic militarization causes warming that is existential -- prefer our comparative ev

**Carliner 22** \[Sam, CODEPINK, "Arctic Military Build-up Poses New
Geopolitical and Climate Risks,"

[Experts warn that at a time when]{.underline} tensions between the
United States and Russia are escalating and [the threat from climate
change increases, a military build-up in the Arctic comes with
new]{.underline} geopolitical and [environmental risks]{.underline}.

Gabriella Gricius, a PhD student and political scientist who follows the
Arctic, tells me that a U.S. build-up envisioned in the senate bill
could fuel military competition with Russia.

"There are certainly real consequences for the U.S.'s greater military
presence in the Arctic," Gricius said. "It may very well be treated as a
military provocation by Russia and may result in increased Russian
military exercises."

Dr. Neta [Crawford, co-director of Brown University's Costs of War
Project, sees the military's view towards competition and build-up in
the Arctic as a poor use of resources.]{.underline}

"[We have a certain catastrophe on its way," Crawford said]{.underline}
in an interview. "It's not a possible war. It's a certain catastrophe,
and the resources that we put to mitigating the risks by reducing
emissions and also by adaptation are much better spent, I think, in
terms of saving lives and livelihoods."

In the past the Arctic Council oversaw cooperation of various countries
and Indigenous nations navigating the geopolitics and climate risks in
the Arctic. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the council
suspended its activities.

Gricius says that a lack of cooperation in the region is unsustainable.

"The Russian Arctic makes up around 50 percent of the entire Arctic,
meaning that it's not truly possible for Russia to be shut out of the
Arctic in any real way," Gricius said. "U.S. policy then, I would think,
is influenced by that fact: Russia cannot be removed from the Arctic and
will continue to be a key stakeholder in the region."

[Militarism's Impact on Climate]{.underline}

[Along with risking greater conflict between the United States and
Russia, a U.S. military build-up in the Arctic threatens to exacerbate
climate change]{.underline}. [Though the Department of Defense and
various branches of the U.S. military have recently released "climate
adaptation" plans, the content focuses primarily on adapting operations,
rather than accounting for and reducing emissions]{.underline}.

In fact, the U.S. Navy published a climate adaptation plan in May this
year that was scrutinized for mostly omitting any mention of its ships
and planes, the two main sources of the U.S. military's pollution.
However, [much of the impact of military emissions remains unknown
because of a loophole in the Paris Climate Agreement which exempts
governments from reporting their military's emissions]{.underline}.

Despite the lack of available information, Dr. Crawford used what data
is public to calculate U.S. military emissions for the Costs of War
Project. According to her research on military emissions published in
2019, "the DOD is the world's largest institutional user of petroleum
and correspondingly, the single largest institutional producer of
greenhouse gasses (GHG) in the world."

She explained that roughly 30 percent of the military's emissions come
from "installation emissions," meaning the energy use of military bases
and other installations. The other 70 percent comes from "operational
emissions," or the energy use of all training, missions, transport, and
other activities.

"[To boil it down, anything that involves transportation is an emitter
of serious significance," Crawford said]{.underline}. [With this
context, increased military activities in the Arctic are likely to
result in increased emissions]{.underline} if activities are not reduced
elsewhere.

Crawford elaborated that aircraft in particular contribute to the 70
percent of operational emissions. This is notable given that the U.S.
Air Force reportedly has the largest presence of any military branch in
the Arctic.

While the Arctic Commitment Act primarily focuses on military build-up
and trade competition with Russia, Gricius and Crawford see a need for
different priorities.

"[Despite the media frenzy about militarization and conflict in the
Arctic, climate change is the largest and most pervasive threat to the
region]{.underline}," Gricius said. She suggests that rather than being
used to escalate conflict, [climate change should be used as an
opportunity for cooperation]{.underline}.

"[The U.S]{.underline}., in particular, [should and can play an
important role both in supporting local initiatives in Alaska on climate
change and also bringing together cooperative initiatives between
scientists, diplomats, and other actors in the region,]{.underline}"
Gricius said.

Crawford laid out a worst-case scenario.

"Let's say there's an accident or an incident that escalates," she said.
"That's hardly helpful and may be disastrous, ultimately, if it
escalates to significant use of force. But it's also the case that when
we do that, the other guys increase their emissions. ... [Climate change
is a much more urgent, and ultimately existential threat compared to
these short-term concerns about showing the flag]{.underline}."

#### Warming causes [extinction]{.underline}\-\--feedback loops and tipping points make it [rapid]{.underline} and [catastrophic]{.underline}.

Luke **Kemp '22** \[August 1; Research Affiliate at the Center for Study
of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, Ph.D; Chi Xu; Joanna
Depledge; Timothy Lenton; "Climate Endgame: Exploring catastrophic
climate change scenarios,"
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119\]

Although [bad-to-worst case scenarios]{.underline} remain underexplored
[in the scientific literature]{.underline}, statements labeling
[[climate]{.mark} change [as]{.mark} catastrophic]{.underline} are not
uncommon. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called climate change
[an]{.underline} "[[existential]{.mark} threat.]{.underline}" Academic
studies have warned that warming above 5 °C is likely to be "[beyond
catastrophic]{.underline}" (50), and above 6 °C constitutes "an
[indisputable [global catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}" (9).

Current discussions over climate catastrophe are undermined by unclear
terminology. The term "catastrophic climate change" has not been
conclusively defined. [An existential]{.underline} [risk]{.underline} is
usually defined as a risk that cause an enduring and significant loss of
long-term human potential (51, 52). This existing definition is deeply
ambiguous and requires societal discussion and specification of
long-term human values (52). While a democratic exploration of values is
welcome, it is not required to understand pathways to human catastrophe
or extinction (52). For now, the existing definition is not a solid
foundation for a scientific inquiry.

We offer clarified working definitions of such terms in Table 1. This is
an initial step toward creating a lexicon for global calamity. Some of
the terms, such as what constitutes a "plausible" risk or a "significant
contributor," are necessarily ambiguous. Others, such as thresholding at
10% or 25% of global population, are partly arbitrary (10% is intended
as a marker for a precedented loss, and 25% is intended as an
unprecedented decrease; see SI Appendix for further discussion). Further
research is needed to sharpen these definitions. The thresholds for
[global catastrophic and decimation risks]{.underline} are intended as
general heuristics and not concrete numerical boundaries. Other factors
such as morbidity, and cultural and [economic loss]{.underline}, need to
be considered.

We define risk as the probability that exposure to climate change
impacts and responses will result in adverse consequences for human or
ecological systems. For the Climate Endgame agenda, we are particularly
interested in catastrophic consequences. Any risk is composed of four
determinants[: hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and
response]{.underline} (3).

We have set global [warming of 3 °C or more]{.underline} by the end of
the century as a marker for extreme climate change. This threshold is
chosen for four reasons: [Such a [temp]{.mark}erature
[rise]{.mark}]{.underline} well [[exceeds]{.mark} internationally agreed
[targets]{.mark}]{.underline}, all the [IPCC "reasons for
concern"]{.underline} in climate impacts [are]{.underline} either "high"
or ["very high" risk]{.underline} between 2 °C and 3 °C, there are
substantially heightened risks of [[self-amplifying changes]{.mark} that
would [make it impossible to limit]{.mark} warming to 3 °C,]{.underline}
and [these]{.underline} levels [relate to far greater
uncertainty]{.underline} in impacts.

Key Research Thus Far

The closest attempts to directly study or comprehensively address how
climate change could lead to human extinction or global catastrophe have
come through popular science books such as The Uninhabitable Earth (53)
and Our Final Warning (10). The latter, a review of climate impacts at
different degrees, concludes that a global temperature rise of 6 °C
"imperils even the survival of humans as a species" (10).

We know that [[health risks worsen with]{.mark} rising
temperatures]{.underline} (54). For example, there is already an
increasing probability of multiple "[breadbasket failures]{.underline}"
(causing a [[food]{.mark} price shock]{.underline}) with higher
temperatures (55). For the top four maize-producing regions (accounting
for 87% of maize production), the [likelihood of production
losses]{.underline} greater than 10% [jumps]{.underline} from 7%
annually under a 2 °C temperature rise to 86% under 4 °C (56). The IPCC
notes, in its Sixth Assessment Report, that 50 to 75% of the global
population could be exposed to life-threatening climatic conditions by
the end of the century due to [[extreme heat]{.mark} and
humidity]{.underline} (6). SI Appendix provides further details on
several key studies of extreme climate change.

The IPCC reports synthesize peer-reviewed literature regarding climate
change, impacts and vulnerabilities, and mitigation. Despite identifying
15 [tipping elements in biosphere, oceans, and cryosphere]{.underline}
in the Working Group 1 contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report, many
with irreversible thresholds, there were very few publications on
catastrophic scenarios that could be assessed. The most notable coverage
is the Working Group II "[reasons for concern]{.underline}" syntheses
that have been reported since 2001. These syntheses were designed to
inform determination of what is "dangerous [anthropogenic
interference]{.underline}" with the climate system, that the UNFCCC aims
to prevent. The five concerns are unique and [threatened
[ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}, frequency and severity of [[extreme
weather]{.mark} events]{.underline}, global distribution and balance of
impacts, total [economic and ecological impact]{.underline}, and
[irreversible]{.underline}, large-scale, [abrupt
[transitions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Each IPCC assessment found greater
risks occurring at lower increases in global mean temperatures. In the
Sixth Assessment Report, all five concerns were listed as very high for
temperatures of 1.2 °C to 4.5 °C. In contrast, only two were rated as
very high at this temperature interval in the previous Assessment Report
(6). [[All]{.mark} five [concerns are]{.mark} now]{.underline} at "high"
or "[[very high]{.underline}"]{.mark} for 2 °C to 3 °C of warming (57).

A Sample Research Agenda: Extreme Earth System States, Mass Mortality,
Societal Fragility, and Integrated Climate Catastrophe Assessments

We suggest a research agenda for catastrophic climate change that
focuses on four key strands:

Understanding extreme climate change dynamics and impacts in the long
term

Exploring climate-triggered pathways to mass morbidity and mortality

Investigating social fragility: [vulnerabilities, risk
cascades]{.underline}, and risk responses

Synthesizing the research findings into "integrated catastrophe
assessments"

Our proposed agenda learns from and builds on integrated assessment
models that are being adapted to better assess large-scale harms. A
range of tipping points have been assessed (58--60), with effects
varying from a 10% chance of doubling the social cost of carbon (61) up
to an eightfold increase in the optimal carbon price (60). This echoes
earlier findings that welfare estimates depend on fat tail risks (31).
Model assumptions such as discount rates, exogenous growth rates, risk
preferences, and damage functions also strongly influence outcomes.

There are large, important aspects missing from these models that are
highlighted in the research agenda: longer-term impacts under extreme
climate change, pathways toward mass morbidity and mortality, and the
risk cascades and systemic risks that extreme climate impacts could
trigger. Progress in these areas would allow for more realistic models
and damage functions and help provide direct estimates of casualties
(62), a necessary moral noneconomic measure of climate risk. We urge the
research community to develop integrated conceptual and semiquantitative
models of climate catastrophes.

Finally, we invite other scholars to revise and improve upon this
proposed agenda.

Extreme Earth System States.

We need to understand potential long-term states of the Earth system
under extreme climate change. This means mapping different "[Hothouse
Earth]{.underline}" scenarios (21) or other extreme scenarios, such as
alternative circulation regimes or [[large, irreversible changes]{.mark}
in ice cover and sea level]{.underline}. This research will require
consideration of long-term climate dynamics and their impacts on other
planetary-level processes. Research suggests that previous [mass
extinction events]{.underline} occurred due to [threshold
effects]{.underline} in the carbon cycle that [we could cross this
century]{.underline} (40, 63). Key impacts in previous mass extinctions,
such as [ocean hypoxia and anoxia]{.underline}, could also
[escalate]{.underline} in the longer term (40, 64).

Studying potential tipping points and irreversible "committed" changes
of ecological and climate systems is essential. For instance, modeling
of the [Antarctic [ice sheet]{.mark}]{.underline} suggests there are
several tipping points that exhibit hysteresis (65). [Irreversible
[loss]{.mark}]{.underline} of the West Antarctic ice sheet was
[found]{.underline} to be triggered [at]{.underline} ∼[2 °]{.underline}C
global warming, and the current ice sheet configuration [cannot be
regained]{.underline} even if temperatures return to present-day levels.
At a 6 °C to 9 °C rise in global temperature, slow, [irreversible loss
of the East Antarctic ice sheet]{.underline} and over 40 m of sea level
rise equivalent could be triggered (65). Similar studies of areas such
as the Greenland ice sheet, permafrost, and terrestrial vegetation would
be helpful. Identifying all the potential Earth system tipping elements
is crucial. This should include a [consideration of wider planetary
boundaries]{.underline}, such as biodiversity, that will [influence
[tipping points]{.mark}]{.underline} (66), [[feedbacks beyond the
climate]{.underline}]{.mark} system, and how [tipping
elements]{.underline} could [[cascade]{.mark} together]{.underline}
(67).

[Mass]{.underline} Morbidity and [Mortality]{.underline}.

There are many potential contributors to climate-induced morbidity and
mortality, but the "four horsemen" of the climate change end game are
likely to be famine and undernutrition, [extreme weather events,
conflict, and vector-borne diseases.]{.underline} These will be
[worsened by additional risks]{.underline} and impacts [such
as]{.underline} mortality from [air pollution and sea level
rise.]{.underline}

These pathways require further study. Empirical estimates of even direct
fatalities from heat stress thus far in the United States are
systematically underestimated (68). A review of the health and climate
change literature from 1985 to 2013 (with a proxy review up to 2017)
found that, of 2,143 papers, only 189 (9%) included a dedicated
discussion of more-extreme health impacts or systemic risk (relating to
migration, famine, or conflict) (69). Models also rarely include
adaptive responses. Thus, the overall mortality estimates are uncertain.

How can potential mass morbidity and mortality be better accounted
for? 1) Track compound hazards through bottom-up modeling of systems and
vulnerabilities (70) and rigorously stress test preparedness (71). 2)
Apply models to higher-temperature scenarios and longer timelines. 3)
Integrate risk cascades and systemic risks (see the following section)
into health risk assessments, such as by incorporating morbidity and
mortality resulting from a climate-triggered food price shock.

Societal Fragility: Vulnerabilities, Risk Cascades, and Risk Responses.

More-complex risk assessments are generally more realistic. The
determinants of risk are not just hazards, vulnerabilities, and
exposures, but also responses (3, 72). A complete risk assessment needs
to consider climate impacts, differential exposure, systemic
vulnerabilities, responses of societies and actors, and the knock-on
effects across borders and sectors (73), potentially resulting in
systemic crises. In the worst case(s), a domino effect or spiral could
continuously worsen the initial risk.

[Societal risk cascades could involve [conflict, disease]{.mark},
[political change]{.mark}, and economic crises]{.underline}. Climate
change has a [complicated relationship with conflict]{.underline},
including, possibly, as a risk factor (74) especially [in areas
with]{.underline} preexisting [ethnic conflict]{.underline} (75).
Climate change could affect the [spread]{.underline} and [transmission
of infectious disease]{.underline}s, as well as the expansion and
severity of different [zoonotic infections]{.underline} (76), creating
conditions for [[novel outbreaks]{.mark} and infections]{.underline}
(6,77). [Epidemics]{.underline} can, in turn, [trigger cascading
impacts]{.underline}, as in the case of COVID-19. Exposure to ecological
stress and natural disasters are key determinants for the cultural
"tightness" (strictness of rules, adherence to tradition, and severity
of punishment) of societies (78). The literature on the median economic
damages of climate change is profuse, but there is far less on
[financial tail risks]{.underline}, such as the possibility [of global
[financial crises.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Past studies could be drawn upon to investigate societal risk.
Relatively small, regional climate changes are linked to the
transformation and even [[collapse of]{.underline}]{.mark} previous
[[societies]{.underline}]{.mark} (79, 80). This could be [due to
declining resilience and]{.underline} the passing of [tipping
points]{.underline} in these societies. There is some evidence for
critical slowing down in societies prior to their collapse (81, 82).
However, care is needed in drawing lessons from premodern case studies.
Prehistory and history should be studied to determine not just how past
societies were affected by specific climate hazards but how those
effects differ as societies change with respect to, for example,
population density, wealth inequality, and governance regime. Such
framing will allow past and current societies to be brought under a
single system of analysis (37).

The characteristics and vulnerabilities of a modern globalized world
where food and transport distribution systems can buffer against traumas
will need to feature in work on societal sensitivity. Such large,
[interconnected systems bring]{.underline} their own sources of
[fragility]{.underline}, particularly if networks are relatively
homogeneous, with a few dominant nodes highly connected to everyone else
(83). Other important modern-day vulnerabilities include the rapid
spread of misinformation and disinformation. These epistemic risks are
serious concerns for public health crises (84) and have already hindered
climate action. A high-level and simplified depiction of how risk
cascades could unfold is provided in Fig. 3.

diagram, in which a complete line represents a positive polarity (e.g.,
[amplifying feedback]{.underline}; not necessarily positive in a
normative sense) and a dotted line denotes a negative polarity (meaning
a dampening feedback). See SI Appendix for further information.

Integrated Catastrophic Assessments.

Climate change will unfold in a world of changing ecosystems,
geopolitics, and technology. Could we even see "[warm
[wars]{.mark}]{.underline}"---[technologically enhanced great power
conflicts [over]{.mark}]{.underline} dwindling carbon budgets, climate
impacts, or [[SRM]{.underline}]{.mark} experiments? Such developments
and scenarios need to be considered to build a full picture of climate
dangers. Climate change could reinforce other interacting threats,
including [rising [inequality]{.mark}, demographic stresses,
[misinfo]{.mark}rmation, new destructive [weapons, and]{.mark} the
[overshoot]{.mark} of other planetary boundaries]{.underline} (85).
There are also [natural [shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as [[solar
flares and]{.underline}]{.mark} high-impact [[volcan]{.mark}ic
erupti[o]{.mark}n[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, that present possible deadly
synchronicities (86). Exploring these is vital, and a range of
"standardized catastrophic scenarios" would facilitate assessment.

1\. Introduction

Despite recent social protests and climate emergency declarations,
[efforts to mitigate climate change to date are
insufficient]{.underline}.1 Greenhouse gas ([GHG]{.underline})
[[emissions]{.mark} continue to [rise]{.mark} and global [warming above
3 °]{.mark}C [is]{.mark}]{.underline} [increasingly [likely]{.mark} this
century]{.underline}.2 [There is emerging evidence of]{.underline}
amplifying [[feedbacks accelerating]{.underline}]{.mark}3 and dampening
feedbacks decelerating.4 These [feedbacks [exacerbate]{.mark} the
possibility of [runaway]{.mark} global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline},5
[estimated [at 8 °]{.mark}C]{.underline} [or greater]{.underline} by
2100.6 Such temperature increases translate to a range of real dangers,7
shifting the narrow climate niche within which humans have resided for
millennia.8

Looking beyond the framing of "global warming", there is concern that
the [effects of ﻿ [climate change]{.mark} may [pose an ﻿ existential
risk]{.mark}]{.underline} [to humanity]{.underline}, one [that threatens
"societal collapse" or]{.underline} even [extinction]{.underline}.9
Understanding these worst-case scenarios is essential for good risk
management.10 Improving awareness of potential pathways through which ﻿
climate change poses such a risk can help inform decision- making about
interventions.11 Considering societal impacts that are more tangible for
individuals, businesses and governments,12 and better ﻿ aligned with
conventional risk priorities,13 may facilitate more effective action to
mitigate ﻿ climate change.14

A number of pathways through which ﻿ climate change could cause societal
collapse have been identified, one being via food insecurity.15
[[Climate]{.mark} change]{.underline} is predicted to [[undermine
ag]{.mark}ricultural systems [and disrupt food]{.mark}
supply]{.underline},16 [[which]{.mark} may [lead to economic
shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[socio- political]{.underline}
[instability]{.underline}]{.mark} [as well as starvation]{.underline},
[[migration]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and conflict at]{.mark} local through
to [global scale]{.mark}]{.underline}.17 [While]{.underline} the
[climate science]{.underline} underpinning global warming estimates [is
well established]{.underline},18 albeit subject to sensitivities, the
[uncertainties increase significantly]{.underline} [when we]{.underline}
start to [consider]{.underline} these [tangible societal
impacts]{.underline} given the complex relationships involved.19 [Our
[understanding of worst-case scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} particularly of empirical evidence addressing the
[causal pathways]{.underline} through which ﻿ climate change may cause
societal collapse, [[is]{.underline}
[underdeveloped]{.underline}]{.mark}.20

In this chapter we aim to identify and structure an empirical evidence
base of the relationships between ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse. We do this using Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD), a system
dynamics approach that is useful for visualising the relationships
between variables in a complex system.21 This chapter is organised as
follows. In Section 2, we review the societal collapse and ﻿ existential
risk literature to refine the aim introduced above. In Section 3, we
develop an original methodology to establish a new empirical evidence
base and create a novel-format CLD of causal pathways between ﻿ climate
change and societal collapse. In Section 4, we present and discuss the
results from the application of this methodology to the ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway of interest. We
conclude, in Section 5, by identifying avenues of future work that may
build upon this chapter.

2\. Literature Review

To refine the aim of this chapter, introduced in Section 1, our review
examines whether there is historical evidence of ﻿ climate change as a
mechanism of societal collapse and to what extent have causal pathways
been documented to inform our understanding of ﻿ climate change as an
existential threat to contemporary society.

We first define the terms "﻿ existential risk" and "societal collapse" as
used in this chapter. Adopting ﻿ Ord's definition, "an ﻿ existential risk
is a risk that threatens the destruction of humanity's long-term
potential" be it incomplete destruction, such as societal collapse, or
complete destruction, such as extinction.22 Adopting Kemp's definition,
[societal collapse]{.underline} is an "enduring loss of ﻿ population,
identity \[and/or institutional\] complexity";23 it [may be abrupt or
gradual]{.underline}, [but is typically rapid]{.underline} because it is
notably transformative, [and may be experienced by]{.underline} a local,
national or [the global community of people]{.underline}. Fig. 1
presents a conceptual model of societal collapse, synthesised from the
broader literature, to provide further contextual definition.

[\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]]{.underline}

The rise and fall of civilisations has been documented since the
earliest recordings of history and is increasingly studied to inform our
understanding of societal collapse.24 We consider two types of
historical studies that provide insight into ﻿ climate change as a
mechanism of societal collapse in the past. We note that other
mechanisms are also discussed in the literature, and there is debate
about the role of different mechanisms in particular societal collapse
events.

The first type of historical study empirically investigates an
individual societal collapse event using primary sources, including
anthropological, archaeological and paleontological data. Based on such
data analysis, natural ﻿ [climate change has been]{.underline} asserted
as [a mechanism of societal collapse in]{.underline} [many]{.underline}
of these [case studies]{.underline}, as established by de Menocal25 and
Weiss and Bradley.26 For example, Hodell et al.,27 Haug et al.,28 and
Medina-Elizalde and Rohling29 analyse paleoclimate data alongside the
[archaeological record]{.underline} to [show]{.underline} that
[drought]{.underline} conditions, [driven by ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} likely due to solar forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the [collapse]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} Classic
[Maya]{.underline} [civilisation]{.underline} of Mesoamerica in
\~8--10th century CE. Weiss et al.,30 Cullen et al.,31 and Cookson et
al.32 show that [regional aridity]{.underline}, [driven by ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} likely due to ﻿ volcanic forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the [collapse of]{.underline} multiple [societies across
Mesopotamia]{.underline}, including the Akkadian Empire in \~22nd
century BCE. Similarly, natural ﻿ [climate change has been implicated
in]{.underline} the [collapse of multiple Late Bronze Age
societies]{.underline} around the Mediterranean,33 [including Mycenaean
Kingdoms]{.underline} in \~12th century BCE,34 the Harappan Civilization
of South Asia in \~19th century BCE,35 the Angkor Empire of Southeast
Asia in \~15th century CE,36 [multiple Chinese Dynasties]{.underline}37
[and civilisations along the Silk Road]{.underline}38 during the
previous millennium, [the Norse Vikings]{.underline} of Greenland in
\~16th century AD,39 and the Tiwanaku Empire of Pre- Columbian South
America in \~10th century CE40 amongst others.

This first type of studies establishes precedence of natural ﻿ climate
change as a mechanism of societal collapse throughout history,
demonstrating the risk that anthropogenic ﻿ climate change similarly
poses to contemporary society. However, the events examined occurred
more than 100 years ago, with most dating back to ancient history, when
societies were relatively isolated. Because these case studies pre- date
contemporary society, they do not provide empirical evidence of
anthropogenic ﻿ climate change in context of today's highly
interconnected society.41

Statistical evaluation of the frequency and significance of natural ﻿
climate change relative to other mechanisms of societal collapse
identified across these case studies has not yet been established within
the literature. However, the second type of historical study does
qualitatively examine collections of these case studies to develop
theories of predominant modes of societal collapse. Three major modes
are observed, as follows.

Fagan42 and McMichael43 focus on natural impact on the human system
across multiple civilisations, concluding that natural ﻿ climate change
is predominant having significantly influenced human existence
throughout history. [Over]{.underline} the past [12,000
years]{.underline}, the [natural and human systems developed within the
stable climate niche]{.underline} [of the Holocene]{.underline} Epoch.44
The associated geographic endowments governed human transition from band
societies based on foraging to complex societies based on agriculture.
Unfavourable subtle (e.g. weather variations) and drastic (e.g. natural
disasters) shifts in climate influenced the collapse of complex
societies either by direct loss of life or indirectly via resource
insecurity. In particular, in this mode, typically, the loss of
agriculture led to de-﻿ population via famine, migration or conflict due
to food insecurity.

Ponting,45 Wright,46 and Diamond47 focus on human impact on the natural
system across multiple civilisations, concluding that human
overpopulation and overexploitation relative to the carrying capacity of
the environment is predominant. [Societal collapse via environmental
degradation]{.underline} often [involved unsustainable]{.underline}
[agriculture]{.underline}, [exacerbated by]{.underline} natural ﻿
[climate change]{.underline}, [leading to de-﻿ population as well as
institutional breakdown]{.underline} [via loss of economic
stability]{.underline} [and socio-political dysfunction]{.underline} due
to magnified inequality. [This]{.underline} mode [aligns
with]{.underline} early "Malthusian ﻿ catastrophe",48 "tragedy of the
commons",49 and "[overshoot-and- collapse]{.underline}"50 theories.

In their 12-volume magnum opus exploring the rise and fall of 28
civilizations, Toynbee concludes that "[great civilizations are not
murdered]{.underline} \[[but]{.underline} rather\] they [take their own
lives]{.underline}."51 Building on this, Tainter,52 Acemoglu and
Robinson,53 and Johnson54 focus on human impact on the human system
across multiple civilisations, concluding that societal complexity in
relation to problem-solving inability (e.g. environmental degradation)
and institutional dysfunction (e.g. inequality and oligarchy internally,
trade ally and hostile neighbour relations externally) is predominant.
As a society becomes more complex, it reaches a point beyond which
"continued investment in complexity as a problem-solving strategy yields
a declining marginal return" and it will be at risk of collapsing under
its own weight via institutional breakdown and de-﻿ population.55 This
mode aligns with "energy returned on energy invested" theory,56 applied
to explore societal collapse by Homer-Dixon.57

Diamond,58 Turchin,59 and Schwartz and Nichols60 examine why some
civilisations have been able to thrive or recover, rather than collapse.
They similarly conclude that societies have flourished due to
combinations of favourable geographic endowment, managing their
existence within the carrying capacity of the natural system, and
co-operative action in problem-solving.

This second type of studies highlights that societal collapse involves a
complex nexus of factors and dynamically interlinked events. For
instance, Gibbon details how all three of the modes, described in the
preceding five paragraphs, contributed to the collapse of the ﻿ Roman
Empire.61 These modes of societal collapse, although based on empirical
evidence pre-dating contemporary society, describe key aspects of the
anthropogenic ﻿ climate change problem faced today. While these studies
describe causal pathways of relevance, to the best of our knowledge, no
study has used CLDs to untangle the complexity and give structure to the
dense information in this evidence base.

Across these historical studies, we observe no apparent temporal or
spatial influence on the occurrence of societal collapse. Rather,
societal collapse has been described as occurring in various forms,
whether it be by known "white-swan" or surprise "black swan" events,62
in different geographic locations and times throughout history.
Additionally, a quantitative statistical analysis by Arbesman shows that
societal collapse has occurred randomly and independent of civilisation
life- spans.63 These qualitative and quantitative observations highlight
that any society may be susceptible to collapse, much in-line with the
Red Queen Hypothesis of the Law of Extinction.

From these historical studies, we observe sets of secondary determinants
for each of the primary determinants introduced in Fig. 1, which are
defined in Fig. 2. Considering a geographically bounded society,
emigration refers to any permanent departure of ﻿ population including
both voluntary or forced migration, conflict mortality accounts for
deaths directly arising from any form of domestic or international
conflict (e.g. due to ﻿ war), and natural mortality accounts for deaths
related to domestic environmental conditions (e.g. due to famine). The
loss of socio-cultural norms, political structures or economic value
accounts for that which notably transforms the identity and institutions
of the society.

[\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]]{.underline}

In addition to these historical studies, we consider the relatively
nascent studies of existential risks (X-risks) that provide insight into
how ﻿ climate change may trigger societal collapse in the future.

Comprehensive surveys of X-risks reveal mechanisms that could cause the
collapse of contemporary society. Bostrom and Ćirković,65 ﻿ Rees,66 and
Ord67 provide eminent scholarly treatment of the field, drawing from the
academic literature. The World Economic Forum68 and Global Challenges
Foundation69 produce global risk reports drawing from decision-makers
and experts across intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations.
These surveys establish that [many historically]{.underline} [observed
mechanisms of societal collapse]{.underline}, [including]{.underline}
natural [﻿]{.underline} [climate change]{.underline}, [remain applicable
as X-risks today]{.underline}. However, the ﻿ state of existence of
contemporary society has led to a different landscape in which these
mechanisms apply, and to a number of unprecedented mechanisms, including
anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. ﻿ Ehrlich and ﻿ Ehrlich70 and Häggström71
note that [although [increased complexity]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such as
globalisation and ﻿ tech]{.underline}nological advancement, [can increase
a society's resilience and adaptability]{.underline}, [it can also
[increase ﻿ vulnerability]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example,
globalisation increases resilience to local agricultural production
shocks through access to global markets; however, it also increases ﻿
vulnerability through ﻿ exposure to sudden reversal in connectivity, such
as trade restrictions.72 Some [geoengineering technologies]{.underline},
for example, [may enable society to mitigate]{.underline} and adapt to ﻿
[climate change]{.underline}; [however]{.underline}, [they
may]{.underline} also [increase ﻿ vulnerability]{.underline} [to ﻿
termination shocks]{.underline}, [where failure]{.underline} [of the
technology exposes society to sudden temperature
increases]{.underline}.73 [[In this]{.mark} highly [interconnected
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline}, "[[synchronous]{.underline}]{.mark}"74
and "[[cascading]{.underline}]{.mark}"75 [[failures
create]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential for]{.underline}]{.mark}
mechanisms and outcomes of [societal [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline},
[once contained to a single]{.underline} localised
[civilisation]{.underline}, [[to rapidly spread]{.underline}
[across]{.underline}]{.mark} multiple [nations and impact humanity on [a
global scale]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Works by Lynas,76 Wallace-Wells77 and Gowdy78 draw on the scientific ﻿
climate change literature to explore hypothetical futures under best- to
worst-case scenarios. The scenarios consider the feedbacks within the
natural system that could worsen, as well as the potential for humans to
mitigate, anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. [Shifts in]{.underline} average
weather (e.g. [temperature]{.underline}) [and natural
disasters]{.underline} (e.g. floods) affected by ﻿ climate change [could
impact human mortality directly]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} two
effects, [coupled with sea level rise]{.underline} due to melting of ice
caps, [could indirectly impact human mortality via
degradation]{.underline} [of the natural world]{.underline} system
([e.g. land quality]{.underline}) [and the human world]{.underline}
system ([e.g. ﻿ infrastructure failures]{.underline}) [resulting in
resource]{.underline} and service [insecurity]{.underline}. [This
insecurity could impact institutional stability]{.underline}, [resulting
in economic loss]{.underline}, [political dysfunction and social
unrest]{.underline}, [as well as migration and conflict]{.underline}.
The hypothetical outcomes for contemporary society against the threat of
anthropogenic ﻿ climate change range from dystopian (collapse) to utopian
(recovery).

These futures studies identify endpoints of different causal pathways
between anthropogenic ﻿ climate change effects and potential impacts on
the human world system, with the latter reflecting key determinants of
societal collapse observed in the historical studies. Scholars have made
limited in-roads to empirically investigating the top-level
relationships between some of these endpoints using recent datasets. The
direct links between ﻿ climate change and the endpoint impacts of
mortality, conflict and migration are, respectively, examined by Mora et
al.,79 Hsiang et al.80 and Hauer et al.81 The feedback between migration
and conflict driven by climate change is examined by Abel et al.82 The
direct links between ﻿ climate change and the endpoint impacts of
economic loss, political instability and shifts in cultural norms are
examined by Burke et al.,83 Sofuoğlu and Ay,84 and Adger et al.85
respectively. However, the complex bottom-level links between and
surrounding these endpoints are generally ill understood,86 and the
strength of empirical evidence is poorly documented from a systems
science perspective.87 To the best of our knowledge, [no
study]{.underline} has [empirically examined how the impacts of ﻿ climate
change could explicitly translate into societal collapse for
contemporary society]{.underline}. [We do not have a clear
picture]{.underline} [of ﻿ climate change as a ﻿ systemic risk to our
globalised society]{.underline}, particularly at spatial scales
accounting for the heterogeneity of individual identity, business
governance and policymaking across nations, and international exchanges.
This limits our ability to understand feedbacks, identify intervention
points, develop quantitative models and inform strategies to minimise
the risk of societal collapse occurring in the future.88

Given the insights from this review, we refine the aim of this chapter
as follows. Firstly, the empirical evidence base should specifically
address contemporary society. Secondly, the CLD should be constructed at
a scale and granularity that addresses the heterogenous characteristics
of nations and international interactions. The refined aim of this
chapter is thus to identify an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate
change, food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society
and structure the evidence base with a CLD defined at global scale and
national granularity.

3\. Methodology

A two-stage framework, consisting of five steps, was developed to
achieve the aim of this chapter. For each step, below, we first
introduce it generically and then describe its application to our
specific analysis of the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway.

3.1. Stage 1: Establishing an empirical evidence base of societal
collapse in contemporary society

Step I deploys societal collapse proxies via a key word search to
identify "evidence points", which in this instance may be considered
data points, in the form of publications that empirically examine the
causal pathway of interest in contemporary society.

The determinants defined in Fig. 2 provide these societal collapse
proxies to establish the new empirical evidence base in lieu of
historical societal collapse events pre-dating contemporary society. The
﻿population loss set are straightforward to isolate, consistent to
measure across nations and describe tangible consequences. The
institutional breakdown set are relatively less so. Thus, the societal
collapse proxies adopted in this study were natural mortality (i.e.
starvation, with respect to food insecurity), conflict mortality and
emigration; subsequent studies could use the institutional breakdown
set. Key words were selected based on terminology of ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and the societal collapse proxies. Peer-reviewed journal
articles were chosen as the form of evidence point in this study;
subsequent studies could use other publications, such as books and
reports.

The keyword search was performed in Scopus. A record of the search is
contained in the Supplementary Information (A.). Approximately 3,000
publications were reviewed by reading the title, abstract and main body
as needed. Evidence points were selected based on satisfaction of the
following criteria: the publication (a) is a peer-reviewed, English-
language, journal article; (b) uses empirical, data driven methods; (c)
examines the period from 1990 to present (2019), representative of
contemporary society; and (d) primarily examines the causal pathway of
interest. We made an exception to (a) to include the most recent Limits
to Growth book,89 which was not itself a search result but documents the
World3 model that was identified in the search results. We note that (b)
precluded selection of review or essay-style publications; however, we
found that these were often discussed in the literature review of
selected evidence points, so were, nonetheless, accounted for
indirectly.

This step resulted in a new empirical evidence base consisting of 41
evidence points, which are summarised in Fig. 4.

Step II defines a custom colour-coded typology for the new empirical
evidence base. This typology is used in Stage 2, to construct a final
CLD (f-CLD) in a novel format showing the spread of the evidence base
across the system.

In this study, we were interested in the methodological spread as this
provides information on data that may be useful for future studies. Four
methodological categories were identified in the new empirical evidence
base. Each evidence point was classified into one of these categories
and assigned a colour coding, namely: quantitative ﻿ complex systems
model --- red; statistical analysis of quantitative dataset --- blue;
collection / analysis of qualitative interview / survey data --- green;
quantitative data-led case study / scenario --- yellow.

The resulting typology of the new empirical evidence base is shown in
Fig. 4.

3.2. Stage 2: Constructing a novel-format causal loop diagram from the
empirical evidence base

Step III involves creating an individual CLD (i-CLD) for each evidence
point to clearly structure the complex causal relationships examined.
These i-CLDs provide the building blocks from which to construct the
f-CLD in Step IV.

[\[FIGURE 3 REMOVED\]]{.underline}

The process to create an i-CLD is as follows. The corresponding evidence
point was examined in its entirety to identify and record key
information in the form of variables (nodes), links (arrowed lines) and
relationship notation (positive or negative). Key information derived
from the original data-driven content, i.e. the main analysis, of the
evidence point was colour coded in the i-CLD according to the typology
classification established in Step II. Any relationships hypothesised
but not supported by the main analysis were coloured grey. Key
information derived from other content, i.e. the literature review, of
the evidence point was coloured black. The scale and granularity of the
i-CLD was recorded as detailed in the evidence point. This process was
repeated for each evidence point in isolation until a complete set of
i-CLDs was produced for the new empirical evidence base.

All 41 i-CLDs created in this study are contained in the Supplementary
Information (B.). One of the i-CLDs is shown in Fig. 3 as an example.
Step IV reconciles the set of i-CLDs into a standardised format in order
to construct the f-CLD of the system of interest at the desired scale
and granularity.

The standardisation process has two aspects. One aspect is related to
component (variables and links) definition, necessary to maximise
clarity of the f-CLD while covering all information contained in the
evidence base. This addresses the typical challenge of CLDs becoming
dense and overcomplicated, which decreases their ﻿ utility. The other
aspect is related to level of aggregation, necessary to ensure the f-CLD
conveys information at the intended scale and granularity. The
standardisation is an iterative process, as follows.

The \~950 variables from the set of 41 i-CLDs were recorded on a blank
worksheet for the f-CLD, without links between them. A clustering
approach was used to reconcile these variables into like groups. For
each group, an overarching major node was isolated and the i-CLD
variables in the group were virtually deposited into a matrix for that
major node. For example, drought, sea level rise and crop disease were
some of the i-CLD variables clustered into an environmental risk factors
f-CLD major node matrix. The f-CLD major nodes were defined at a level
of aggregation representative of a nation. Doing so effectively scaled
down any global or regional aggregation, and scaled up any sub-national
or local aggregation, in the i-CLD variables. For example, household
food imports was an i-CLD variable of local aggregation that was scaled
up to national food imports (trade) in the f-CLD.

The \~1150 links from the set of 41 i-CLDs were reconciled into arrowed
lines between the major nodes in the f-CLD. This sometimes- required
interpretation of implied causality in the i-CLD relationships in order
to route them across the major nodes in the f-CLD. For example, where an
i-CLD showed a direct link from international food price to conflict
variables, this was routed using arrowed lines from international food
price to national food price to food ﻿ accessibility to food insecurity
and finally to conflict major nodes defined in the f-CLD. Where there
was a discrepancy between relationship descriptions, the relationship
with the most supporting i-CLDs was adopted.

The interim f-CLD produced at the end of each standardisation iteration
was examined to determine whether the major node definition could be
refined to maximise clarity. For example, in one iteration water and
land were defined as separate major nodes, but examination determined
that each had the same arrowed lines to other major nodes; therefore,
another iteration was undertaken with water and land now clustered under
a single natural resources major node in order to minimise redundant
arrowed lines. This process was iterated several times until an f-CLD
had been constructed at an appropriate level of detail for this study.
Additionally, relevant literature reviewed in Section 290 was cross-
referenced, but not included as evidence points, to ensure comprehensive
coverage of key relationships in the f-CLD.

The standard-format f-CLD, consisting of uncoloured and unweighted
components, resulting at the end of this step is contained in the
Supplementary Information (C.).

Step V maps each i-CLD to the f-CLD using a weighted (line thickness)
typology (colour-coded) approach. This visually documents the spread of
the evidence base across the system described by the f-CLD.

The process to map an i-CLD to the f-CLD is as follows. Each variable
(node) of the i-CLD was assigned to its corresponding major node(s) in
the f-CLD. Each link (arrowed line) of the i-CLD was assigned to a
corresponding route along the arrowed lines in the f-CLD. Each time an
arrowed line in the f-CLD had an i-CLD link assigned to it, an
incremental weighting of one-unit line thickness in the corresponding
typology colour-coding of the i-CLD link was added to the f-CLD arrowed
line. This process was repeated for each of the 41 i-CLDs until all had
been mapped to the f-CLD. A record of this process for each of the 41
i-CLDs is contained in the Supplementary Information (D.).

The novel-format f-CLD, consisting of colour-coded and weighted
components, resulting at the end of this final step is presented in Fig.
5.

4\. Results and Discussion

The new empirical evidence base and novel-format CLD of ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society resulting
from the application of our original methodology (Section 3) are
discussed in turn below.

4.1. Empirical evidence base of climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse in contemporary society

The new empirical evidence base (Section 3, Step I), along with its
colour-coded typology (Section 3, Step II), is presented in Fig. 4. It
consists of 41 evidence points, of which 9 examine the natural mortality
(i.e. starvation, with respect to food insecurity), 20 the conflict
mortality and 12 the emigration societal collapse proxy, alongside other
human and natural world system factors. We discuss three key aspects of
the evidence base, namely temporal and spatial distribution, data-driven
method distribution, and advantages of each data-driven methods, below.

The temporal scale and granularity of study varies across the evidence
base; however, our methodology limited the possible scale of study to
the period from 1990 to present, representative of contemporary society.
Within this period, approximately half of the evidence points cover a
scale of less than one decade and the other half a scale of greater than
one decade. Approximately half of the evidence points conduct analyses
at yearly granularity and the other half conduct analyses at granularity
greater than one year, with only a few studies conducting analyses at
monthly granularity. The spatial scale and granularity of study varies
across the evidence base. Approximately one third of the evidence points
investigate the system at a global scale, with the remaining two thirds
focusing on regional or national scales, primarily in Africa as well as
the Middle East and Asia. Approximately half of the evidence points
analyse the causal pathway at sub-national granularity, with the other
half primarily focusing on national-level granularity. This variation
provided different coverage of the complex relationships within the
system, which was informative for constructing our CLD.

The distribution of data-driven methods used across the evidence base is
notably different for each societal collapse proxy. Evidence points for
natural mortality mostly use collection/analysis of interview/ survey
data. This is likely because the minimum daily food intake for human
survival is well established;91 as such, statistical analysis of food
and mortality data sets would not yield significantly new insights into
thresholds whereas interviews/surveys can provide insight into an
individual's circumstances influencing this relationship. Evidence
points for conflict mortality mostly use statistical analysis of
existing datasets. This likely reflects the interest in rigorously
curated conflict datasets, such as UCDP/PRIO,92 across the conflict and
peace fields. Evidence points for emigration mostly use
collection/analysis of interview/survey data, likely because this
provides nuanced insight into an individual's decision to migrate. It
may also be due to data availability and quality challenges that limit
quantitative statistical analyses, which are being addressed by groups
such as the International Organization for Migration's Global Migration
Data Analysis Centre.93 Amongst these data challenges, it is important
to recognise the issue of reconciling different types of voluntary and
forced migration with causal drivers, given the complex social, economic
and political factors at play; this challenge similarly applies to the
other societal collapse proxies but is particularly noted in the
migration studies. We observe from these studies that a food insecurity
threshold for natural mortality is well established but thresholds for
conflict mortality and emigration are not. Indeed, distinguishing causal
drivers within datasets and defining quantitative thresholds for these
determinants remains a "grand challenge".94

[\[FIGURE 4 REMOVED\]]{.underline}

Each data-driven method offers different advantages. The ﻿ complex ﻿
systems models each describe "chunks" of the system at different scale
and granularity. The models provide mathematical definition, are ﻿
calibrated to real-world data and enable quantitative simulation of key
relationships in the system. The statistical analyses quantitatively
examine relationships between a dependent variable and one or more
independent variables within the system, which can be used as a
mathematical basis for extending ﻿ modelling capabilities. The
collection/ analysis of interview/survey data provides insight into
qualitative aspects of human perspective and decision-making that
quantitative data sets cannot provide directly. The data-led case
study/scenarios combine quantitative data with qualitative expert
interpretation to better understand global trends and ﻿ forecasts. These
latter two methods can also be used to inform the development of ﻿
modelling capabilities, the scenarios analysed by such models and their
application in decision- making processes. Collectively, these different
data-driven methods can yield useful insights into the nuances of
relationships in the system of interest.

4.2. Causal loop diagram of the climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse in contemporary society at global scale and national
granularity

The main result of this chapter is the CLD (the f-CLD from Section 3,
Step V), presented in Fig. 5. It structures the relationships between ﻿
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse as described in
our new empirical evidence base (presented in Fig. 4 and discussed in
Section 4.1). We discuss three key aspects of the CLD, namely insights
related to the spread of empirical evidence, the qualitative ﻿ complex
system depicted, and quantitative ﻿ complex system ﻿ modelling, below,
alongside consideration of well-established benefits and limitations of
CLDs.

Our CLD is presented in a novel format that documents the spread of our
empirical evidence base. We use line thickness and colour, respectively,
to depict the density and type of the data-driven methods used by the
empirical evidence points to analyse a given link between two variables.

Doing this aids comprehension of where existing work has been focused
with respect to the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway. It may also help with the identification of
gaps in existing analyses. For example, we can see that the link between
food insecurity and conflict has been investigated mostly by evidence
points using statistical analyses (blue), whereas the links between food
insecurity and migration, and food insecurity and natural mortality,
have been investigated mostly by evidence points using
interviews/surveys (green). This hints that it may be useful to
investigate the former using quantitative statistics, and the latter
using qualitative interviews/surveys, to gain further insights offered
by the different data-driven methods as described in Section 4.1.

It is important to recognise that our CLD may show negligible density
for important links or even be missing important variables and/or links,
either because they have not yet been studied or because our key word
search failed to identify evidence points that have studied them. For
example, our study focused on the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse causal pathway, so the density of our empirical
evidence is concentrated along links central to this pathway, whereas
the links between peripheral variables in the system, such as between
fertility and births, show a lower density of empirical evidence.
Similarly, our use of the ﻿ population loss set of societal collapse
proxies means that the evidence base details natural mortality, conflict
mortality and emigration, whereas the institutional breakdown set are
not detailed. In considering this issue, our methodology attempted to
maximise the ﻿ rigour and transparency of our study by documenting the
spread of our empirical evidence base to help make the reader aware of
exactly how much and what type of evidence was supporting the CLD
presented here.

Further, we can see that while empirical studies have linked ﻿ climate
change via food insecurity to our societal collapse proxies of natural
mortality, conflict mortality and emigration, we found no empirical
studies linking these proxies to the explicit term of societal collapse.
This was expected given the motivation of this study (Section 1) and is
due to the fact that there are no contemporary events of societal
collapse, under the same definition as those in the historical studies
pre-dating contemporary society, that enable these links to be
empirically studied.95

Having considered the spread of empirical evidence, we now consider the ﻿
complex system documented. A key benefit of CLDs is that they simply
present a myriad of information in a single diagram; in doing so, CLDs
enable comprehension of the structure and behaviour of ﻿ complex systems,
including feedbacks, intervention points and far- reaching
interdependencies.96 Our CLD visually depicts a system of 39 variables,
105 links and 32,000 feedback loops,97 integrating information from
different fields including climate science, ﻿ food security, conflict,
migration and health research.

Walking through the CLD at a high-level, we can see how ﻿ population
growth and lifestyle emissions, influenced by institutional/demographic
factors (e.g. emission reduction incentives), combine to directly drive ﻿
climate change. Similarly, they indirectly drive ﻿ climate change via
consumer demand on food production, which produces emissions directly
(e.g. ruminant livestock) and indirectly via industrial capital/ output
(e.g. processing factories). The environmental risk factors (e.g.
extreme weather events) of ﻿ climate change may cause losses of food
production either directly (e.g. plant disease) or indirectly via
agricultural input availability (e.g. loss of water source for
irrigation). A country's food availability is influenced by domestic
food production and international food trade. Food ﻿ accessibility is
influenced by its food price, which responds to domestic (e.g. cost of
food production and distribution) and international (e.g. international
food price) markets, and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. food
subsidies). Food utilisation is influenced by ﻿ infrastructure/services
(e.g. ﻿ education) and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. cultural
traditions). Food insecurity is underpinned by these three pillars of
food availability, food ﻿ accessibility and food utilisation. For a given
country, food insecurity can drive natural mortality (i.e. starvation),
conflict and migration, contributing to ﻿ population loss, as well as
economic shocks and socio- political instability, contributing to
institutional breakdown, which exacerbates the risk of societal
collapse.

[Beyond]{.underline} a given country suffering [increased natural
mortality]{.underline}, [famines]{.underline} (i.e. [food
insecurity]{.underline}) [can place pressure on international
humanitarian efforts]{.underline} ([i.e. institutional risk
factors]{.underline}). [Conflict may occur domestically or
internationally]{.underline} [and can feedback]{.underline} [to
exacerbate]{.underline} [food insecurity and institutional
fragility]{.underline} (i.e. institutional risk factors). Potential
[mass emigration can increase pressure on food
availability]{.underline}, [natural resources and ﻿
infrastructure/services in the destination nation]{.underline}, which
can lead to socio- cultural tensions (i.e. institutional risk factors)
that fuel conflict. [Food insecurity can]{.underline} also
[directly]{.underline} [contribute to]{.underline} institutional risk
factors such as [social unrest, political instability and economic
inequality]{.underline}, [which increase the risk of societal collapse
due to institutional breakdown]{.underline}, [that may also ﻿ cascade
internationally]{.underline}. [While already fragile ﻿ states are
expected]{.underline} [to be hit the worst directly]{.underline}, these
[insights reveal the indirect ramifications of ﻿ climate change on our
globalised society]{.underline},98 [with serious
consequences]{.underline} [for humanity's "existential
security".]{.underline}99

[While some of these relationships may appear obvious]{.underline}, it
is the act of [bringing this information]{.underline}, [which may
otherwise be siloed]{.underline} and thus preventing consideration of
the full story, [together]{.underline} [in one place]{.underline} that
[is of value]{.underline}.100 In doing so, our CLD attempts to provide
readers with the opportunity to explore the ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway, consider worst-case
scenarios that we want to avoid, develop transformative narratives of
"where we want to go" and think about interventions that may help us
attain this desired future.101

It is important to appreciate that CLDs are only as good as their
information inputs; our CLD documents relationships based on information
portrayed in our empirical evidence base as well as our interpretation
of that information. As such, there exist challenges and limitations.102
For instance, CLDs may mask variability of relationships in different
contexts and locations, because they can only depict a single scale and
granularity. The portrayal of explicit causality between variables in a
CLD is a challenge as this can often work in both directions rather than
one. CLDs can often become either too complicated or too simplified,
which undermines their usefulness. In considering each of these issues,
our original methodology attempted to maximise the ﻿ rigour and
transparency of our study by first documenting the information in each
evidence point with an i-CLD and then consistently applying, and
recording, the iterative process of reconciling the variables and links
from each i-CLD to construct the f-CLD at the selected global scale and
national granularity. In doing so, we sought to enable the reader to be
aware of the nuances of the different scales and granularity of
information underpinning our CLD, as well as our process of carefully
reconciling causality, over 950 variables to 39 variables and 1150 links
to 105 links to maximise the information conveyed while balancing
readability.

It is also important to note that, due to their qualitative and static ﻿
nature, CLDs do not enable us to comprehend the dynamics of the system,
including nonlinear and emergent behaviour, non-intuitive quantitative
results and time delays.103 Complex systems models, although with their
own challenges and limitations,104 provide the opportunity to
quantitatively analyse the dynamics of a system and gain insights into
the potentially far-reaching impacts of our decisions.105 However, ﻿
complex ﻿ systems models that explicitly examine societal collapse in
contemporary society are underdeveloped. The World3 system dynamics
model106 --- an evidence point in this study (refer to Supplementary
Information D).107 --- is the eminent model of relevance, with only a
limited number of studies building on it. World3 examines the potential
for "overshoot-and-collapse" given ﻿ population and industrial growth
within the finite carrying capacity of the natural world system,
implicitly accounting for ﻿ climate change and explicitly accounting for
food availability.

The information contained in our CLD and empirical evidence base may be
useful in identifying and informing opportunities to improve these
existing ﻿ complex systems ﻿ modelling capabilities for ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse scenarios. For example, our CLD
highlights important factors at global scale and national granularity
that World3 does not incorporate because it is defined at global scale
and granularity.108 World3 does not distinguish heterogenous
characteristics of nations, such as distribution of ﻿ population or
geographic endowment of natural resources. It also does not account for
international interactions, such as food trade, conflict and migration.
Relatedly, World3 evaluates societal collapse only by natural mortality
(defined by food availability, age and pollution) and does not include
the other two ﻿ population loss secondary determinants, as noted in the
previous sentence, nor the three institutional breakdown secondary
determinants. While our empirical evidence base may provide useful
direction to datasets, it is important to note that quantitatively
defining these relationships, particularly thresholds as discussed in
Section 4.1, remains a key challenge of developing ﻿ complex ﻿ systems
models. Nonetheless, given that individuals associate with national
identity, business governance and policy-making are concentrated at
national level, and international interactions underpin the functioning
of contemporary society it could be valuable to model societal collapse
risk profiles of different nations to inform the prioritisation and
development of intervention strategies.

5\. Conclusions and Future Work

This chapter identified an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society and
structured the evidence base using a novel-format CLD defined at global
scale and national granularity.

Two types of future work could extend from the results of this chapter.
Identification of gaps in the spread of evidence across the CLD may
guide future data-driven efforts to examine these causal relationships
and define thresholds. The CLD and evidence base may be used to develop
quantitative ﻿ modelling capabilities, particularly by transforming the
structure of World3 to account for heterogenous national characteristics
and international interactions. Three types of future work could extend
from the methodology and literature synthesis. The causal pathway
examined in this chapter could be further detailed by re-applying the
methodology using the institutional breakdown set of societal collapse
proxies instead of the ﻿ population loss set. The methodology, using
either set of societal collapse proxies, could be applied to detail
other causal pathways between ﻿ climate change and societal collapse. The
methodology, excluding the contemporary time- period limitation, could
be applied to document the information in the historical studies
identified in the literature review. Similarly, the methodology could be
applied to construct CLDs at different scales and granularities.

It is hoped that this chapter has contributed to developing our
understanding of the causal pathways through which ﻿ climate change poses
an ﻿ existential risk to humanity and facilitates opportunities for
future work.

Highlights:

• In this short chapter the authors draw on several research strands and
papers within CSER to offer a theoretical reflection on how to think
about catastrophic climate change and what Existential Risk Studies can
learn from climate change research.

• [This is intended to build on the previous chapter]{.underline}, [in
which Catherine Richards]{.underline}, Richard Lupton, and Julian
Allwood [provide an empirical assessment of one highly
concerning]{.underline} [risk cascade]{.underline} involving climate
change and highlight its potential contribution to global catastrophic
and existential risk.

• Climate change is one of the most empirically well-studied risks and
has deep links to pre-existing bodies of literature, such as disaster
risk management, environmental studies, and food security.

• Drawing on these studies and more, the chapter reflects on how to
frame research questions in existential risk, what causes catastrophic
climate change to be neglected by climate and existential risk
researchers alike, and how to incorporate assessments of response risk
and co-benefits into thinking about catastrophic climate change.

This short chapter brings together a number of important ideas and draws
readers attention to other extant bodies of literature. The relative
value of ﻿ co-benefits approaches is discussed in other chapters in this
volume, including Chapter 4, in more detail. The dangers of ﻿ response
risks are further discussed in Chapter 2.

1\. [Asking the Wrong Questions for the Right Reasons]{.underline}

[Within]{.underline} [Existential Risk Studies it is common to
hear]{.underline} people ask [the question "[is ﻿ climate change]{.mark}
an ﻿ [existential]{.mark} risk[?]{.mark}"]{.underline}, and
[many]{.underline} who ask this question [answer
negatively]{.underline}, [arguing]{.underline} that [as a result ﻿
climate change is not an important topic of research within the
field]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, whether it is [answered
affirmatively or not,]{.underline} [this question [is
misguided]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are three reasons for thinking
this. [Firstly]{.underline}, [it makes little sense on a probabilistic
level]{.underline}; whether something will be [a threat to]{.underline}
our [collective existence is not]{.underline} a [binary
matter]{.underline}, [it is a question of likelihood]{.underline}.
However, [many researchers]{.underline} [within Existential Risk Studies
mistakenly]{.underline} [conflict ﻿ existential risk with
events]{.underline} [that could be existential ﻿
catastrophes]{.underline}. [Secondly]{.underline}, ﻿ [[climate change is
not a single uniform process]{.underline}]{.mark} that will affect
everyone in the same way; [[it is]{.mark} a set of [diffuse
impacts]{.mark}]{.underline} [to different]{.underline} ﻿ exposed
[populations]{.underline}, [interacting with different ﻿ vulnerabilities
and ﻿ exposures]{.underline}, and [[activating different risk ﻿
cascades]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Richards et al. show, [[it]{.mark}
will inevitably [interact with]{.mark} a host of [other threats]{.mark}
(not only ﻿ [food security]{.mark} and [societal
collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} even [factors such
as]{.underline} the explosivity of ﻿ [[volcanic eruptions]{.mark}
or]{.underline} the [emergence of [zoonotic
pathogens]{.mark}),]{.underline}1 and [[these]{.mark} can
interact]{.underline} with one another [to [create
reinforcing]{.mark}]{.underline} [feedback loops or "[global]{.mark}
systems [death spirals]{.mark}".]{.underline}2 Finally, "﻿ existential
risk" is too vague and arbitrary a concept for the question to ever be
answered. All the definitions of ﻿ existential risk that have received
the greatest public attention thus far, such as Toby ﻿ Ord's, focused not
in terms of an impact on humanity at any point in time but rather in
terms of "the loss of long-term future value";3 either referring to the
author(s) particular vision of a high-tech intergalactic utopia, or a
fuzzy undefined idea of "our potential".4

Other [[authors]{.mark} have practised]{.underline} attribution
[substitution]{.underline} [and sought to [answer]{.mark} an easier
question]{.underline} [such as ["will]{.mark} the [direct
impacts]{.mark} of ﻿ climate change [make]{.mark} the [Earth
uninhabitable?"]{.mark}]{.underline} [as a proxy for existential
risk]{.underline},5 [or suggested agricultural
impossibility]{.underline} [as a proxy for ﻿ civilisational collapse at a
given level of temperature rise]{.underline}.6 [[These
are]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly [more tractable
questions]{.underline}, but [they are also [entirely different
questions]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [there is a danger]{.underline} [in
thinking that answering them is sufficient]{.underline} [to
assess]{.underline} the [overall level of ﻿ climate risk.]{.underline}

We are better off reverting back to the common-sense definition of ﻿
existential risk as the risk to the existence of a given object, and
specifying whether the object under threat is humanity as a whole (﻿
extinction risk), global industrial society (collapse risk), or
something else entirely. We should be thinking of an overall level of
risk emergent from a particular socio-ecological system, and how much ﻿
climate change influences this level.7 And the question we should be
asking about this risk is what contribution, under certain scenarios, ﻿
climate change will make, bearing in mind that it will almost certainly
be operating in tandem with many other drivers of risk.

Considering [this]{.underline} revised question can also [help to
rectify]{.underline} [a recurring problem in the ﻿ climate risk
literature: using mean global temperature rise as the sole threat
indicator]{.underline}. Authors and ﻿ activists alike have frequently
made a direct link between the level of warming and the likelihood of
global ﻿ catastrophe, with 4--6 °C being most frequently used as this
terrible threshold.8 However, [global surface temperature]{.underline}
[is only one]{.underline} [of the ﻿ climate]{.underline} change induced
[factors we need to worry about. 3 °C of warming]{.underline} above
pre-industrial levels [could be]{.underline} entirely
[manageable]{.underline} [if]{.underline} it occurs [in a world of
adaptive technologies]{.underline}, high levels of [multilateral
cooperation]{.underline}, [wealth equality]{.underline}, [trust in
institutions]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the [safe management of
other ﻿ planetary boundaries]{.underline}. [It could]{.underline} also
[be catastrophic]{.underline} [in a world where other ﻿ planetary
boundaries are transgressed]{.underline}, [the international order is
riven with conflict]{.underline}, lethal autonomous weapons are in mass
production, [and societies are scarred by inequality]{.underline}, low
trust, [and polarisation]{.underline}. Understanding the contribution of
﻿climate change to Global Catastrophic Risk requires a more sophisticated
approach which looks beyond the direct impacts of a given level of
warming to think through fully formed climate scenarios. We believe
that, when conceived of in this way, the risks associated with ﻿ climate
change are more appreciable and it is far harder to argue that
understanding them is unimportant; however, even if others disagree with
this assessment, we still maintain that this is the right way to think
about the problem.

2\. Catastrophic Neglect

Given how poorly questions about [[catastrophic]{.mark} ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} are often framed, it is hardly surprising that it
[has been a highly neglected subject of study]{.underline}, not only
among ﻿ existential risk researchers but also among ﻿ climate change
researchers. Even at the basic level of temperature rise scenarios, [we
give far more attention]{.underline} [to]{.underline} studying the
impacts of [lower- end [warming]{.mark} rather than high-end
warming]{.underline}. Text-mining of IPCC reports shows that mentions of
[3 °C and above [is underrepresented]{.mark}]{.underline} [relative
to]{.underline} its [likelihood]{.underline} ([and
impact]{.underline}),9 a finding that has been verified by both
literature sampling and the reports of popular authors trying to
summarise the climate risk science.10 If anything, [this trend appears
to have worsened]{.underline} [over time]{.underline} with subsequent
IPCC reports.111 The [use of complex]{.underline} [risk assessments to
study climate scenarios has]{.underline} also [been
neglected]{.underline}: [looking at compound hazards is]{.underline}
already [rare]{.underline},12 [let alone considering risk ﻿
cascades]{.underline} and integrated climate ﻿ catastrophe assessments.
Yet catastrophic ﻿ climate change remains high on the public and
political agenda, creating both a perception that this is a risk
receiving far more attention than it is, and also an intellectual vacuum
that is easily filled by poor quality research, ranging from speculative
doom-mongering13 to overly simplistic neoclassical economic models.14

[There are four]{.underline} key [reasons for this
oversight]{.underline} of extreme global ﻿ climate risk. First is
international climate policy. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement on
Climate Change has channelled scientific attention toward the
agreement's goal of limiting warming to 2 °C above pre- industrial
levels and pursuing efforts to stabilise it below 1.5 °C, as these are
now the publicly stated goals of climate ﻿ negotiations (even if they are
highly unlikely to actually be realised). Second, [[analysis]{.mark} of
high-end warming]{.underline} scenarios [and complex risk assessments
[are]{.mark} simply [harder]{.mark} to do]{.underline}. [The higher the
warming gets]{.underline}, [the more difficult it becomes to
study]{.underline}, as these scenarios are more displaced for the
current climatic niche. Moreover, [complex]{.underline} ﻿ climate [risk
assessments involving multiple factors are]{.underline} far [more
challenging]{.underline} than a ﻿ hazard-centric analysis focusing on
only the direct impacts of mean global temperature rise. Third,
[[climate scholarship]{.mark} has had a strong incentive]{.underline}
[to "[err on the side of least drama]{.mark}".]{.underline}15 [Climate
change has long]{.underline} [been the target of [fossil-fuel]{.mark}
industry [campaigns]{.mark} to [sow doubt]{.mark}]{.underline}, [not
just on]{.underline} attempts to assess ﻿ climate change's [catastrophic
potential but even the fundamental science]{.underline}, and [this
[create]{.mark}s [incentives for conservative
science]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that builds
consensus]{.underline}]{.mark} [and does not risk exploring divergent
hypotheses]{.underline}.16 Finally, [many fear]{.underline} that
[discussing extreme risk could]{.underline} cause people to dwell too
much on worst case scenarios, [breed]{.underline}ing
[fatalism]{.underline} and paralysis. However, [this concern is
misplaced]{.underline}; meta-analyses over hopeful vs. fearful messaging
are mixed,17 and in any case this is a false dichotomy. One of the most
referenced pieces for those concerned about the paralytic effect of fear
does show that hopeful messaging is more poignant than fear but also
that "worry" is even more effective than hope.18 The difference between
worry and fear is one of degrees; the latter could even dissipate into
the former over time. Furthermore, research should not be a PR exercise
aimed to sway the public, in open democracies we have a duty to do
honest risk assessments combined with clear recommendations for what can
be done.19

4\. Diplomatic efforts and international governance

[Due to the soft power strategy, Arctic governance has created the
Arctic Council as a model of inclusiveness and high-level
intergovernmental forum, where science diplomacy has played a pivotal
role in promoting cooperation, coordination, and interaction among
circumpolar states on issues of common concern, including those relating
to sustainable development and environmental protection]{.underline}.
The council brings together the eight Arctic member states,
organizations representing the region's native peoples, and several
observer states and organizations, including China. \[24\] [The Arctic
Council]{.underline} was officially established in 1996 under the terms
of the Ottawa Declaration, whose signatories were Canada, Denmark
(including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), the U.S., Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Russia and Sweden. It [cannot deal with military and sovereignty
issues (which are excluded from its field of competence) to]{.underline}
concentrate discussions on subjects that can more easily be the subject
of consensus such as scientific cooperation, environmental protection,
well-being and economic development of indigenous populations, safety of
navigation, etc. Much of the Arctic Council's work focuses on scientific
and technical topics that are studied in thematic working groups. \[25\]

Outside the Arctic Council, there are a multitude of official
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, whose purpose is to
manage various issues in the Arctic; The Arctic Circle is an
organization established by Iceland on 15 April 2013. Its mission is to
facilitate dialogue between political leaders, business leaders,
environmental experts, scientists, indigenous representatives and other
international stakeholders on issues related to the Arctic. The four
Arctic states located in Europe (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden)
and Iceland, which has strong historical ties to Europe, are known as
the "Nordic countries". Much of the cooperation between these states
relates to issues they have in common with Western Russia, the Baltic
and Barents Sea regions and the greater Nordic region, including
international waters. In addition to those organizations, six other
organizations representing Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have
permanent participant status. \[26\]

There are also non-Arctic countries that have been granted observer
status, such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, France, Spain,
Italy, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland.
This is in addition to many other international organizations such as
the UN through some of its programs related to environment and
development. European and Asian countries have shown their interests and
responsibilities in a strategy document on the Arctic. The EU adopted an
integrated policy on the Arctic zone in 2016 and is currently
considering updating these guidelines. Asian states' ongoing research
agendas and scientific cooperation have made their engagement crucial
for the development of Arctic knowledge. Japan and South Korea launched
the construction of an icebreaker for scientific purposes, to be
deployed in 2026. \[27\]

[There is no doubt that the war in Ukraine has made cooperation and
diplomacy in the Arctic more difficult. However, the U.S. can expect
Russia to remain open to peaceful discussions]{.underline}. [Even at the
height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union cooperated with the West on
Arctic issues, including initiatives such as the 1973 Convention on the
Conservation of Polar Bears]{.underline} \[28\] [and the 1987 Murmansk
Initiative toward regional cooperation, recognizing the special
responsibilities and special interests of the States of the Arctic
Region in relation to the protection of the fauna and flora of the
Arctic Region and recognizing that the polar bear is a significant
resource of the Arctic Region that requires additional
protection.]{.underline}

[To manage the escalating tensions in the Arctic, states must strike a
balance between cooperation and strategic rivalry through bilateral and
international diplomacy. Important Arctic nations like the U.S. and
Russia hold bilateral discussions to lower the likelihood of armed
conflict, frequently concentrating on keeping lines of communication
open about security-related issues.]{.underline} Despite the modest
progress made in these discussions, [they are nonetheless crucial for
defusing any confrontations considering the Arctic's growing
militarization.]{.underline} [Security matters are noticeably missing
from multilateral institutions like the Arctic Council, which offers all
Arctic nations a diplomatic forum to debate environmental, economic, and
indigenous issues]{.underline}.

Despite the current high tensions and given the potential for mutual
destruction, [Russia and NATO share an interest in maintaining peace in
the Arctic region]{.underline} in [addition to diplomatic frameworks
that provide legal channels for settling competing claims to seabed
resources]{.underline}, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea (UNCLOS). \[29[\] NATO's attempts to coordinate security
plans among its Arctic member states, strengthening regional stability,
are another example of multilateral diplomacy in action]{.underline}.
Although these diplomatic efforts aid in the management of tensions,
they frequently fail to address the more serious security threats
brought on by military buildups and geopolitical rivalry in the Arctic.
\[30\]

Conclusion

[With rivalry for resources, vital shipping lanes, and military
supremacy driving war, the Arctic is quickly changing into a disputed
geopolitical region. Global powers like China, the U.S., and Russia are
vying for control of the region because of the melting ice, which has
made it more accessible for economic exploitation. Territorial claims
overlap when states bolster their military presence, raising the
possibility of error or conflict. The Arctic runs the risk of turning
into a hot spot for future hostilities in the absence of defined methods
to handle these tensions]{.underline}.

[There is an urgent need for more international collaboration to stop
this escalation]{.underline}. [Although the UNCLOS and the Arctic
Council have facilitated communication, they are ill-equipped to handle
the region's growing security concerns]{.underline}. [Redoubled efforts
should concentrate on broadening diplomatic channels to cover security
and military matters, setting up a platform for Arctic countries to
discuss weapons control and developing guidelines for military
behavior]{.underline}. [The moment has come for Arctic countries to
engage in formalized diplomatic discussion that covers military and
security matters]{.underline}. [Whether through a distinct treaty or the
Arctic Council, a new global security framework might offer a forum for
controlling the military buildup, negotiating arms control measures, and
defining explicit rules of engagement to avoid unintentional
conflicts]{.underline}. [In addition to lowering the likelihood of
violence, this would establish a crisis management system in the Arctic.
International organizations must also mediate conflicts and make sure
that competition in the Arctic doesn't jeopardize indigenous rights or
the sustainability of the environment. In the face of mounting global
pressure, the Arctic can only continue to be a region of harmony,
collaboration, and shared wealth via concerted effort.]{.underline}

cooperation]{.underline}. [US-Russia rapprochement may broadly benefit
the world by bringing an end to the disastrous war in Ukraine and
reducing the risk of nuclear war, but existential environmental issues
still demand attention]{.underline}.

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the \'canary in the coal mine\' for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, [Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region as
a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: \'We need to pursue joint
projects, including, for example, in the Arctic]{.underline}.\' [The
Arctic region makes sense as a setting for cooperation as the two sides
have explicitly expressed interest in exploring cooperation in energy,
investment, and geopolitical issues]{.underline}. Western sanctions on
Russia have led Moscow to step up its cooperation in the Arctic with
China in joint energy ventures and grand plans for Arctic shipping. [US
officials now see Arctic cooperation as a potential means to \'drive a
wedge\' between Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}.

[In my meetings in Moscow with American and Russian
diplomats]{.underline} and ~~businessmen~~ \[businesspeople\]over the
past few weeks[, it is clear that many are interested in diverse forms
of Arctic cooperation]{.underline}, from cultural diplomacy that
celebrates the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the
Bering Strait, to scientific diplomacy to understand and adapt to
climate hazards faced by both nations. Business interests, however, are
at the top of the agenda.

Trump\'s suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump\'s threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump\'s statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump\'s plan \'can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region.\'

Together with Trump\'s desire to acquire Ukraine\'s resources and reduce
the US\' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump\'s political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin\'s
offer to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the
US may also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships \'all over the
place\' near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition
in Trump\'s Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

[The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the countries\' diplomatic missions will significantly reduce the
current obstacles to US-Russia scientific cooperation in the Arctic. By
making it easier to issue visas and travel between the two countries,
Americans and Russians will again be able to conduct joint research,
expeditions, and scientific conferences and build models to better
understand the unfolding climate emergency. Scientific cooperation to
understand the changes affecting sea ice, permafrost, ecosystems, and
local communities has been blunted by the political fallout of the war
in Ukraine.]{.underline}

[Cooperation in the Arctic can help build regional stability. More
importantly, Arctic cooperation will build trust between the US and
Russia that could complement or spill over into other crucial fields of
cooperation such as arms control, Middle East peace, and global
health.]{.underline}

Donald Trump\'s cruel and chaotic second term is just getting started.
In his first month back in office, Trump and his lackey Elon Musk (or is
it the other way around?) have proven that nothing is safe from
sacrifice at the altar of unchecked power and riches

Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine effectively cut Western financial and
diplomatic ties in the Arctic region. Even long-standing cooperation
through the Arctic Council came to a halt during Russia's Chairmanship.
Nevertheless, [Russia depends heavily on developing its Arctic zone's
abundant natural resources to sustain economic growth]{.underline}. With
Western partnerships now out of reach, [Russia has turned to China to
fill the looming gap in the Arctic]{.underline}. Under the "no-limits"
friendship declared between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian
President Vladimir Putin, the two nations have intensified their
cooperation in the region.

.The return to great power politics is intensifying the desire among
competing states to establish interests in the Arctic region. [The
erosion of the cooperative spirit that has defined the region over the
past three decades could have a profoundly negative impact on Arctic
governance, scientific collaboration, environmental protection, and
sustainable development]{.underline}. Indeed, [the emergence of an ice
curtain]{.underline}---nearly eighty years after Churchill's famous
declaration of an iron curtain descending across Europe---[will
particularly hinder cooperation in critical areas such as understanding
climate change, preserving fragile ecosystems, and protecting the
environment from unscrupulous resource extraction
practices]{.underline}. [This situation may also adversely affect
Indigenous communities in the region]{.underline}, limiting dialogue and
collaboration in the circumpolar Arctic. Most concerningly, [the
militarization of the region could reach new heights -- a dangerous
prospect given the lack of mechanisms for dialogue and
deconfliction]{.underline}. [The Arctic security dilemma that has
already taken root may continue to escalate as Western nations seek to
counterbalance Russian militarization]{.underline} and a nascent
Sino-Russian Arctic partnership.

### Solvency -- Multilateral Coop - U.S. Lead

#### The U.S. [taking the lead]{.underline} on establishing Arctic diplomacy solves

Previously thought of as a frozen landscape of interest only to
scientists, [the Arctic has increasingly garnered the attention of the
international community]{.underline}. Climate change has seen on average
rise in global temperatures of 0.0 degrees Celsius in the past 140
years. [In the Arctic]{.underline}, however, [temperatures have risen
twice that of the global average due to a reinforcing feedback loop
called "Arctic amplification]{.underline}," where more dark-colored
seawater absorbs heat, and in turn, melts more ice. In the past fifty
years, Arctic sea ice has shrunk to about half its original size. While
scientists do not yet agree on the exact timeline of the melt, it is
estimated that within fifteen to thirty years, parts of the Arctic will
be ice-free for significant durations annually.

[For the littoral Arctic states---Canada, Finland, Iceland, the Kingdom
of Denmark, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States---this melt
brings the potential of accessing previously inaccessible
resources]{.underline}. It is estimated that a fifth of the world's
hydrocarbons is locked under the Arctic ice. Beyond hydrocarbons, a
melted Arctic would also bring additional sources of fish; minerals;
metals; and hydro, wind, geothermal, tidal, and solar power. On the
other hand, [the reduction of the natural barrier formed by the ice is a
security threat. The Arctic states, therefore, all have distinct
interests in maintaining trade routes, resource development, sea ice
claims, and regional stability]{.underline} (see figure 1, page 82).

[Other non-Arctic states---China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom---have all declared interest in the region and joined
the Arctic Council as permanent observers]{.underline}. For them, the
most important development is arguably the potential viability of new
waterways through the Arctic as the ice melts. If fully opened, the
Transpolar Sea Route, Northern Sea Route, and the Northwest Passage can
significantly cut shipping times from Europe to Asia. Furthermore,
without the canal limitations of traditional shipping routes, bigger
cargo ships can provide greater economies of scale each trip.
Underwater, the access to more ocean floor means more fiber-optic cables
can be laid, making telecommunications more efficient and reliable. [As
many of these non-Arctic states are beneficiaries of the traditional
trade routes, the potential disruption in trade caused by the melting
Arctic is possibly an existential threat]{.underline}. Beyond trade
routes, many of these states are also highly keen on gaining access to
the potential resources in the Arctic.

states are also highly keen on gaining access to the potential resources
in the Arctic.

Against this backdrop, multiple Arctic and non-Arctic states are making
moves to gain an edge, or even hegemony, before the ice fully melts.
Thus, the question of whether the regional governance should be
restricted locally or expanded globally is an important one. To this
end, [the authors argue that as the environmental, economic, and
security impacts of the Arctic are global in nature, its governance
should be correspondingly global]{.underline}. Hence, [as both an Arctic
state and the largest economy in the world]{.underline}, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should take the lead in
fostering international cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline}.

#### The U.S. leading global collaboration on the Arctic is key to solve the aff's impacts

Conclusion

The potential economic gains from the melt are tantalizing. If fully
realized, [global trade currents could shift, threatening countries half
a world away while invigorating regions previously frozen out of the
international economic community]{.underline}. Perhaps even more than
the South China Sea, [impacts of developments in the Arctic are global
in nature]{.underline}. Thus, [the key priority must be in keeping the
peace and stability of the region by promoting international
collaboration and reducing counterproductive competition]{.underline}.
[While the current geopolitical situation in the region seems to be
generally collaborative]{.underline}, [most Arctic states
and]{.underline} other [interested non-Arctic states]{.underline} [are
making]{.underline} diplomatic, economic, and military [moves in
preparation for future competition as the melt progresses]{.underline}.

[As an Arctic state and the currently recognized global
leader]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
in a unique position to shift the current Arctic paradigm]{.underline}.
[With effective diplomacy]{.underline} and military collaboration, [it
can be the leading voice for establishing a more inclusive global
governance model for the Arctic that will overcome the current weak
mandate of the Arctic Council on military issues. The governance model
should be based on the three key principles of free and open trade, a
rules-based order, and environmental conservation.]{.underline}

### 2NC Multilateral Treaty Solves

#### Only an [international body]{.underline} can solve the aff's impacts

[Collaboration, Competition, and Conflict]{.underline}

At a casual glance, [it appears that the trend in the Arctic is one of
cooperation rather than conflict, leading to claims that the tensions in
the South China Sea can be solved by learning how the Arctic states
resolve and manage their conflicts]{.underline}. For example, since its
formation in 1996 as part of the Ottawa Declaration, the Arctic Council
has established three legally binding agreements on search and rescue,
oil pollution preparedness, and scientific research. In addition,
countries in the Arctic region and the European Union (EU) have
collectively agreed to not increase fishing activities in Arctic waters
for at least sixteen years so the scientific community can study the
long-term ecological impacts of melting sea ice. Thus far, conflicting
territorial disputes in the region are largely arbitrated by United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) submissions or
bilateral agreements.

[Look below the surface, however, and one can discover a variety of
diplomatic, informational, economic, and military posturing by countries
with Arctic interests. The official position of most of these countries
is primarily that of adhering to an international rules-based
order]{.underline} [and cooperation]{.underline} between states.
However, [a number of competing claims have not been resolved, and
countries are defending their claims with military buildup.]{.underline}

Of the Arctic states, [Russia appears to be making the most aggressive
moves]{.underline}. With \$300 billion in Arctic infrastructure
investments, Russia is sending a clear signal about its hegemonic Arctic
ambitions. Russian President Vladimir [Putin openly declared the
Northern Sea Route as an international shipping artery rivaling
traditional routes and claimed parts of it as Russia's internal
waters]{.underline}, [meaning the country can decide who can transit
through it, effectively monopolizing the waterway]{.underline}.

Beyond rhetoric, [Russia looks prepared to defend its claims
militarily]{.underline}. Alarm bells first rang in 2007, when a Russian
submarine expedition planted a titanium Russian flag under the North
Pole. Since then, it has built up an extensive collection of forty
icebreakers, naval ships, land-based military deployments and military
infrastructure the Far North. Antiship missile sites and ports have been
established along the northern sea border of Russia, including sites on
islands that pose a threat to any vessels that have an interest in the
Arctic. Although not directly related to the Arctic, withdrawal from the
Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Treaty by both Russia and the United
States is a cause for concern as it is a sign of hostility.20 In its
defense, the Arctic ice was traditionally seen as a natural barrier
between Russia and NATO states. With that natural barrier melting,
Russia feels the pressure to bolster its northern defenses.

Uncharacteristically, [Canada makes similar claims that parts of the
Northwest Passage are its internal waters]{.underline}. Consequently, it
protested the 1969 voyage of the USS Manhattan as an intrusion by the
United States into Canadian sovereignty. To defend its claims, Canada
plans to upgrade its Arctic military capabilities with icebreaker ships,
offshore patrol ships, snowmobiles, surveillance equipment, and
satellite communications. As a show of deterrence, the Canadian Armed
Forces have also conducted annual sovereignty defense exercises in the
Arctic under Operation Nunalivit since 2007. In another display of
sovereignty, Canada prevented the sale of Canadian radar technology to
the United States on grounds of national security in 2008.24 That said,
Canada is taking care not to appear too aggressive with permanent Arctic
deployments.

[The newest big player in the arena is China.]{.underline} In the 2018
Arctic Policy, China declared itself as a "near-Arctic State" and
expressed the desire to build a "Polar Silk Road" through the Arctic.26
Unlike its hegemonic posturing in the South China Sea, China's Arctic
rhetoric has been about trade freedom and respect for UNCLOS.27 Overtly,
China's moves in the Arctic are largely an exercise of soft power via
research, investments, and infrastructure development with multiple
Arctic states.28 It currently spends \$60 million annually on research
in the region.29 Economically, China engaged with many Arctic states to
fund projects in a bid for influence in the region. In 2013, it
established a free trade agreement with Iceland, the first with a
European country. In 2014, it supplied \$12 billion to the Yamal LNG
project---a Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) company---to complete a
project when funding fell as a result of U.S. sanctions on Russia. China
also engaged with the United States and signed a deal to provide funding
for the Alaska LNG project in 2017. Most recently, in late 2018, China
is in talks with Greenland on infrastructure projects. However, some
government officials fear it may come at a price of Greenland's control
over its raw materials. Despite the focus on economy, military buildup
is still relevant here, as China recently launched its first
domestically produced icebreaker, the Snow Dragon II. Furthermore, it is
making plans for naval and submarine operations in the Arctic.

[Apart from the countries mentioned above, other non-Arctic littoral
entities are also putting more focus on the Arctic. The EU is looking to
build icebreakers and announced its own Arctic policy]{.underline}. NATO
has likewise studied into its future involvements in the Arctic. Asian
countries like South Korea and Singapore have also built large
icebreakers to access the Arctic shipping routes.33 All these actions
suggest that the attention on the Arctic is global in nature and
countries are willing to invest significant capital to get ahead in the
Arctic game.

[Despite these developments, some scholars believe that hostile
competition in the Arctic is a remote scenario due to its current harsh
conditions, poor infrastructure, and the relatively peaceful stability
of the Arctic states. However, this view may be too temporally and
geographically myopic. First, unlike the South China Sea, the resources
promised by the Arctic are not ready for exploitation yet. Thus, while
there is little benefit currently for overt conflict, many countries are
preparing the theater using diplomatic, informational, and economic
campaigns while simultaneously building their militaries]{.underline}.
Second, China's military developments are running in tandem with its
demonstrated ambitions under its global Belt and Road Initiative. [Thus,
once conditions are ripe, it may well resort to the hard power tactics
it is pursuing in the South China Sea to achieve its economic
aims]{.underline}. Therefore, [to avoid escalation into another Cold War
or armed conflict, the priority in the Arctic must be to establish an
inclusive governance model to ensure all stakeholders' interests are
addressed]{.underline}, wherever their geographical locations may be.

An Ideal Arctic Governance Model

[Despite the heavy global influence of the region, the Arctic Council
only allows the eight Arctic states to be full members while non-Arctic
states can only become permanent observers. With no binding legal powers
and mandate to discuss military topics, the Arctic Council, in its
current form, is a weak institution to guard against aggressive
geopolitical posturing in the Arctic]{.underline}. [A stronger
governance model based upon sound principles needs to be
established]{.underline}.

With such potential for economic growth, it is easy to forget that the
Arctic melt poses severe environmental impacts that will far outweigh
the economic gains discussed above. First, temperature increases in the
Arctic will in turn increase global temperatures and could result in
rising sea levels. Irresponsible development and ice breaking in the
region may very well add to these temperature increases. Second, native
food security is reduced due to the loss of whaling and sealing from the
warmer waters, leading to potential relocations of whole communities in
the Arctic.39 To minimize these negative impacts, the primary principle
of Arctic governance must be environmental sustainability and climate
change prevention.

[Given current predictions, however, the Arctic melt is probably more a
matter of when than if]{.underline}.40 [As such, development governance
and territorial conflicts need to be addressed early]{.underline}. [On
economy and resources, the most globally equitable position is to treat
the Arctic as a global common that is free and open for international
trade and resource exploration while maintaining way-of-life safeguards
for the four-million-person indigenous Arctic population]{.underline}.41
This position is aligned with that of the United States, the EU, and
most non-Arctic states, suggesting a strong potential for enforcement
collaboration.42 Thus, freedom of trade anchored by an international
rules-based order must be a key principle in Arctic governance

[Given the global impacts of the Arctic, governance of the Arctic's
developments and enforcement of the safeguards should be done by a truly
international body]{.underline}. [Membership of the Arctic Council
should be expanded to all countries with Arctic interests. In addition,
all aspects of Arctic development, including military ones, should be up
for debate in the council. A possible model to follow is that of the
Antarctic Treaty System that governs resource extraction and scientific
exploration in Antarctica. Under the legally binding treaty,all
signatories suspended territorial claims and military
activities]{.underline}. Instead, [they collaborated to jointly
facilitate the stipulations of the treaty. The Antarctic Treaty
Consultative Meetings are open to all countries as long as they conduct
"substantial research activity" as proof of commitment to the
region]{.underline}.

Of course, there are significant differences between the Arctic and
Antarctica. First, there is little great power competition between the
littoral Antarctic states. Second, because it is an actual landmass, the
melt in Antarctica will not change trade routes but will instead have a
significant impact on global sea levels. As such, the economic and
strategic gains in the Antarctic are seemingly less significant, making
it easier for countries to focus on environmental factors and be more
altruistic in their approaches to the region.Nevertheless, [with strong
international leadership and advocacy for collaboration rather than
competition, a similar system could be achieved in the
Arctic]{.underline}

Implications for U.S. Policy

[While it appears to the general American public that Arctic
developments only impact the remote Arctic state of Alaska, these
developments, in fact, have serious implications on the United States'
national security]{.underline}. First, [if competition in the Arctic
leads to militarization, the consequences of conflict will affect the
overall U.S. military and economy]{.underline}. [Thus, the U.S. Arctic
Region Policy states that "U.S. national security interests \[in the
Arctic\] include such matters as missile defense and early warning;
deployment of sea and air systems for strategic sealift, strategic
deterrence, maritime presence, and maritime security operations; and
ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight]{.underline}." [Second,
beyond militarization, the U.S. Department of Energy states that the
definition of national security with regards to the Arctic must be broad
in nature and include security in freedom to conduct economic, resource
extraction, and scientific research activities as well.46 As an Arctic
state and an international leader, the United States must take steps to
ensure its national security interests in the Arctic are
protected]{.underline}.

### Solvency - Deterrence

#### The CP deters conflict better through deterrence -- solves both advantages

[With just one heavy-class icebreaker and minimal troops in
Alaska]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[deterrent is not credible on its own]{.underline}. Diplomatically, the
United States needs to work out its conflicts with Canada first and then
capitalize on its special relationship with the country to convince its
leadership to relinquish its internal waters claim on the Northwest
Passage and respect the provisions of UNCLOS.49 Thereafter, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should champion international
collaboration in lobbying for a more inclusive governance body for
Arctic development]{.underline}. [This push for global Arctic governance
should]{.underline} also [be underpinned by multilateral military
cooperation with interested nations]{.underline}. In a key demonstration
of good faith to rally the nations, the United States should ratify
UNCLOS. Given all other Arctic states are abiding by UNCLOS and the
United States abides by it in action already, the ratification should be
little more than a formality. [Establishing multilateral cooperation
will also alleviate perceptions of hegemonic Arctic ambitions by the
United States.]{.underline}

[The twin pillars of deterrence and diplomacy only work if the
deterrence is credible]{.underline}. [This is especially so if China and
Russia collaborate]{.underline} not just economically but also
[militarily]{.underline}. It [is neither cost effective nor timely for
the U]{.underline}nited [States to attempt to catch up to Russia's, and
potentially China's, over forty icebreakers]{.underline}. However, [if
it can pair its own icebreaker build up with the twenty-nine icebreakers
and other naval assets of the NATO countries and friendly non-Arctic
states like Japan and South Korea]{.underline}, [it can send a dual
message of deterrence and international unity against any country trying
to assert hegemony over the Arctic]{.underline}.51

[Beyond deterrence, there are plenty of other benefits of military
collaboration in the Arctic. First, partner nations can gain much from
jointly developing the poor communications infrastructure]{.underline}
and navigational data in the region so all vessels can pass through
safely. Due to the harsh conditions, cost sharing to develop
Arctic-hardy unmanned systems will be of special value. Second, the
possibility of oil spills as more oil tankers traverse the Arctic will
undoubtedly increase. In the difficult conditions of the Arctic,
clean-up operations for spills will likely be even more complex than
those of the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989. Thus, joint emergency response
plans for this scenario need to be well developed and constantly
rehearsed. Finally, [search-and-rescue operations in the region will
also be fraught with difficulty and would provide a good platform for
all nations to collaborate militarily]{.underline}.

### Russia Cooperates

#### Russia will cooperate effectively -- most qualified experts prove

**Thai News Service 25** \["Russia: Cooperation between Russia, US in
Arctic May be Maximum Effective," pg. Lexis, ALB\]

[The joint implementation of projects in the Arctic]{.underline} [by
Russia and the United States]{.underline} [may be a most effective area
in cooperation between the countries]{.underline}, in particular, not
only in hydrocarbons extraction, but also in development of the Northern
Sea Route and making the Northern Air Bridge, Alexey [Fadeev, Doctor of
Economics, Deputy Chairman of the Public Council at St. Petersburg\'s
Committee on Arctic Affairs, told TASS]{.underline}.

[Earlier, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Kirill
Dmitriev, said in an interview with the Politico that Russia and the
United States during a meeting in Saudi Arabia discussed possible joint
projects in the Arctic]{.underline}.

\"[Russia has always been open to cooperation with international
partners. The Arctic is exactly the area where cooperation may be most
effective]{.underline}. Its hydrocarbon potential\'s development is a
possible area for agreements between the US and Russia. The United
States has significant experience in developing both offshore fields in
the Gulf of Mexico and shallow-water fields in the Beaufort Sea in
Alaska. The transfer of effective organizational, economic,
environmental experience and knowledge would be useful for both sides,\"
Alexey Fadeev said.

In 2012, Russia began cooperation with the United States in this area,
he continued. In 2012, Rosneft signed agreements with ExxonMobil and
General Electric, and they discovered the Pobeda field in the Kara Sea,
but in 2014, due to complicated Russian-American relations, the
cooperation was frozen, and ExxonMobil was forced to quit the project.

Transport and logistics links

[Transport and logistics may be another area of cooperation between
Russia and the US in the Arctic]{.underline}. \"[The Northern Sea Route
is a true alternative to existing global solutions]{.underline}. It may
be used to ship goods from the West to the East and back, including
liquefied natural gas, which over recent years the US has been
developing actively. In addition, some 20 years ago, in the 2000s, quite
popular was the Northern Air Bridge project of cross-polar flights from
Southeast Asia crossing the Arctic towards North America,\" the expert
said.

The air route through the Arctic cuts flight time, where long distances
between continents may be covered within 10 hours. One of the global
problems that hindered this project was the necessary substantial cargo
base - such a flight\'s load should be at least 80-85% to be profitable.
The two countries could solve this task, and the airports on the route
could develop into major transport hubs.

Ecology of high latitudes

No less important than economic projects in the Arctic remain the
environmental consequences of developing high altitude areas, the expert
continued. The US and Russia are members of the Arctic Council, which
features also Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark represented by Greenland,
Iceland and Canada. Russia\'s cooperation with that organization has
hardly been full-fledged in recent years. Despite their political
differences, those countries are collectively responsible for the region
in terms of the environmental agenda, since the changing Arctic climate
can change the climate of the entire planet. Major powers, such as
Russia and the United States, have all the necessary knowledge and
technology to preserve the fragile Arctic ecosystem.

[\"The Arctic is no longer a territory of heroism]{.underline}. [It is a
promising economic zone with opportunities for international cooperation
in various areas]{.underline}. [Both Russia and the US have interests
also in the military-industrial complex in the region]{.underline}, as
well as in the extraction of biological resources, aquaculture, and in
the transport sector development. [The Arctic is becoming a truly
inhabited territory with a high prospect of development through joint
efforts]{.underline},\" the expert said in conclusion.

**Russia will cooperate to ensure stability**

**Thai News Service 25** \["Russia/United States: Russia open to
cooperation with US to ensure security in Arctic embassy," pg. Lexis,
ALB\]

[Russia is open to cooperation with the United States on ensuring
stability in the Arctic region]{.underline}, Russia\'s embassy in
Denmark told Izvestiya.

\"[Russia assumes that security in the Arctic should be built by joint
efforts of countries of the region through dialogue and cooperation.
Russia is open to cooperation with the US on a mutually beneficial basis
in the interests of ensuring stability and sustainable development of
the Arctic]{.underline},\" the embassy said amid reports of a visit by
the American delegation to Greenland.

Russian President Vladimir [Putin said earlier this week that he is
convinced that the United States would keep promoting its military,
political and economic interests in the Arctic Region]{.underline}. The
president also commented on Washington\'s plans to gain control over
Greenland, noting that it was a matter for the two sovereign states
Denmark and the United States - to decide. It \"has no relation\" to
Russia, Putin added.

#### Russia will cooperate despite military build up

**Anadolu 25** \[Anadolu = news service, "Russia plans Arctic military
buildup, eyes cooperation with West," pg. lexis, ALB\]

\"[The number of Russian military personnel in the Arctic will
grow]{.underline},\" Putin said, adding that Russia will develop new
shipyards and acquire both domestic and foreign-built vessels to support
Arctic trade routes.

[Despite Western sanctions and tensions, he expressed his readiness for
cooperation]{.underline}.

\"[We are open to joint work not only with Arctic nations but with all
who share responsibility for a stable future of the
planet]{.underline},\" he said.

### A2 Perm Do Both

**Russia casts military buildup as an excuse for aggressive behavior in
the context of cooperation -- the perm fails**

**Gricius 25** \[M.A. in International Security from the University of
Gronigen who specializes in Arctic research, Ph.D candidate in Political
Science at Colorado State, "Russia's Double Game in Arctic is
Cooperation in Name, but Confrontation in Practice," The Jamestown
Foundation via Targeted News Service, pg. Lexis, ALB\]

\* [Moscow portrays itself as a constructive actor advocating for
economic cooperation in the Arctic and Baltic seas while also conducting
an increasing rate of hybrid attacks and engaging in provocative
discourse]{.underline}.

\* [This double game of cooperation]{.underline} [has long marked the
Kremlin\'s Arctic agenda]{.underline}, but [recent months have seen an
increase in this strategy of engagement and expanded Arctic
militarization]{.underline}.

\* [Russia\'s dual strategy of confrontation and cooperation in the
Arctic seeks to exploit divisions among Western allies while portraying
their actions as provocations]{.underline}, forcing Arctic states to
navigate a delicate balance in their responses.

The Russian-hosted International Arctic Forum (IAF) held on March 26-27
painted a vision of Russia as a responsible and constructive Arctic
player. The high-profile event included Russian President Vladimir Putin
as a speaker and framed the Arctic as a region for cooperation between
both Arctic and non-Arctic states. During his speech, Putin claimed that
[Russia has \"advocated and continues to advocate for equal cooperation
in the region\" and that \"unfortunately, international cooperation in
the northern latitudes is currently going through difficult times\" as
\"many Western countries have taken a confrontational
course\"]{.underline} (Forum Arctica, March 27). [This image of Russia
seeking cooperation in the region, however, is belied by an increasing
military buildup in the Baltic and Arctic]{.underline}, as evidenced by
exercises and provocative language (DIIS, February 14). [While this
two-pronged approach is not new, Russia has been intensifying its Arctic
military operations in recent months, while continuing to maintain a
rhetorical commitment to peace and cooperation in the
region]{.underline} (see EDM, March 31). [Responding to this approach is
difficult as Western states must acknowledge that responding militarily
to Russia\'s Arctic strategy risks legitimizing Moscow\'s narratives of
Western aggression and expansion into the Arctic, which in turn could
fuel Russian disinformation that is meant to weaken alliances across the
other Arctic states]{.underline} (Topwar.ru, April 3).

During his speech at the IAF, [Putin announced that \"the number of
\[Russian\] military personnel \[in the region\] will be increased\" in
accordance with the annual federal budget, to strengthen Russia\'s
military presence in the Arctic]{.underline} (see EDM, October 3, 2024;
President of Russia, March 27). This buildup is part of a pattern of
expanded Russian military presence in the Baltic Sea and Arctic region
(High North News, August 20, 2024). Hybrid attacks are growing more
prevalent since Russia\'s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including
rising hybrid attacks on undersea cables (European Leadership Network,
December 8, 2023; see EDM, February 5). While military exercises in the
Barents Sea are not necessarily increasing in quantity, it is notable
that exercises now include military personnel who have served in Ukraine
(The Barents Observer, March 18). Russia is also upgrading its submarine
capabilities, with Putin recently officiating a ceremony launching the
multi-role Perm nuclear-powered submarine, part of the Project 8851885M
Yasen class (see EDM, March 31). The Perm has a dual hunter-killer role
as well as the ability to vertically launch cruise missiles (President
of Russia, March 27; The Barents Observer, March 28). It is the first
Project 885M submarine to carry Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles, which
reportedly carry a 300-kilogram warhead originally designed to be an
anti-ship missile but has been used against Ukrainian cities in
Russia\'s war against Ukraine (Kyiv Independent, March 30, 2024).

[Russia\'s military build-up is reinforced by the narrative that the
United States is an aggressive actor in the Arctic and that Russia is
merely responding to imperialist behavior]{.underline}. [This is evident
in Putin\'s responses to U.S. President Donald Trump\'s recent rhetoric
regarding the purchase of Greenland]{.underline} (see EDM, January 21).
During his speech at the IAF, Putin claimed that the United States\'
plan to \"annex\" Greenland is part of plans to \"systematically advance
its geostrategic, military-political, and economic interests in the
Arctic\" (President of Russia, March 27). Beyond the headlines on
Greenland, however, Russian officials have also accused other Arctic
states such as Norway and Finland of seeking confrontation with Russia.
For example, one official claimed recently that Norway is seeking to
militarize Svalbard (Aftenposten, December 19, 2024; see EDM, March 20).
Another recent example is Russian presidential aide Nikolai Patrushev\'s
accusation that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\'s (NATO) naval
forces are seeking to block Russia from the Baltic Sea and conducting
cyber operations on Russian ships in the region (Kyiv Independent, March
13).

[In tandem with these accusations, Russia promotes itself as a
cooperative actor in the Arctic]{.underline}. [The vast majority of
panels at the IAF described Russia as a central actor for future Arctic
business investment, particularly emphasizing the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline} (Forum Arctica, accessed April 3). The event also
highlighted Russia\'s efforts to protect the Arctic environment and its
humanitarian cooperation with other states. Beyond the IAF, Russian
officials have pushed a narrative of the necessity of U.S.-Russian
economic cooperation and rapprochement in the Arctic (Arctic Today,
February 27; The Barents Observer, March 12).

[Russia has the opportunity to use the increasing division between the
United States and its European Arctic allies on issues such as Greenland
to create confusion over its intentions in the Arctic and Baltic
regions]{.underline} (see EDM, January 21). [This presents Moscow with
an excuse to frame any Western responses to its actions in the Arctic as
aggressive]{.underline} (Arctic Today, February 19). [Such responses
would further justify, in Moscow\'s eyes, an increased Russian military
presence in the Arctic]{.underline}. For example, Poland and the Baltic
states said they would recommend withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention,
an international treaty banning anti-personnel mines, to prepare for
Russia\'s growing military threat in the Baltic space (Euronews, March
18). [Such a policy response will certainly be framed in Moscow as an
aggressive anti-Russia approach that warrants increased Russian military
build-up]{.underline}. On the other hand, Moscow uses engagement by
Western actors, such as Norway\'s virtual participation in the IAF, as a
calling card that Russia is a legitimate partner in the region (Forum
Arctica, March 26; The Barents Observer, March 27). [Responding to
Russia\'s double game of cooperation-confrontation discourse in the
Arctic will come with a cost.]{.underline}
