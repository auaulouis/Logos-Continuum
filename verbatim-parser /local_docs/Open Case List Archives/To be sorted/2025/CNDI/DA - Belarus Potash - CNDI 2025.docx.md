# \*DA\-\--Belarus Potash\-\--CNDI 25\*

## Notes

This DA (or case turn) is a little silly---it's meant to be an impact
turn to the idea Aff reduces Russian Arctic control in the Northern Sea
Route (NSR). The link is based on the Aff deterring Russian Arctic port
operations that are necessary for Belarusian fertilizer exports. While
the exact link mechanism isn't great, four of the camp Affs make some
claim in the 1AC about Russian NSR expansion being bad; it could be read
as a case turn.

Military Capacity: Shute '23--- "rapidly developing plans to expand the
Northern Sea Route."

Icebreakers: Katz '24--- "Northern Sea Route, further bolstered by
partnership with Russia in the Far East, North Pacific Ocean and
Russia's Northern Sea Route, connect Beijing to Europe"

REM: Perez '24--- China has partnered extensively with Russia, as both
an importer of Russian natural gas and an investor in infrastructure
development along the Northern Sea Route (NSR)... The opening of the NSR
would also benefit Europe, granting easier access to China.

Science Research: Pezard, et al. '25--- "monitoring the NSR 'to improve
navigation and ice forecasts on the route.'"

Chibis said that "At the end of 2023, we constructed a 50km road, which
was built in record time. It connects the eastern shore of the Kola Bay

terminal, state-of-the-art, and environmentally friendly. The railway
provides a perspective for the development of other port facilities.
Additional work is underway to increase the capacity of the railway,
including long-range approaches that allow cargo to be transported from
Belarus. The main task now is to fulfil the priorities outlined in the
Efficient Transport System project and that the capacity of the railway
to Murmansk should be increased from 45 million tonnes to at least 100
million tonnes."

The **[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Navy and its NATO allies [may be
**gearing** up [to **challenge** Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} excessive
legal **[[claims to the N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea
[r]{.mark}oute]{.underline}** by conducting a freedom of navigation
operation. Multinational naval exercises have been taking place in the
Barents Sea, and at some point they might include a freedom of
navigation operation. The stakes are high, given the tensions following
Russia's reinvasion of Ukraine in 2022. The Russian government's
warnings about naval operations in the area have become more bellicose
and the political leadership appears more willing to take risks. As a
result, the [fallout]{.underline} from any freedom of navigation
operation **[could rapidly escalate.]{.underline}**

The [**Northern Sea route** passes through some of **Russia's most
militarily sensitive** areas]{.underline}. The Arctic region hosts the
largest number of Russian ballistic missile submarines, provides a test
bed for new weapons, hosts important air bases for strategic bombers,
and holds other important military and intelligence infrastructure.

[Russia defines the Northern Sea Route as a **national unified transport
route**]{.underline} running from the Kara Gates in the west to Deznev
Cape **[in the eastern Arctic]{.underline}**. The Northern Sea Route
consists of multiple lanes, but the most commonly used route passes
through four straits: the Vilkitskii, Shokalskii, Dmitri Laptev, and
Sannikov Straits. [[Russian law defines]{.mark} [these]{.mark} straits
[as]{.mark} **[internal waters]{.mark}**, while the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates and others key actors **beg** to **[disagree]{.mark}**
and define them as international straits, thus subject to the right of
transit passage]{.underline}. The difference in interpretation is
longstanding: The United States and the Soviet Union first exchanged a
series of diplomatic notes arguing over the status of these straits in
the 1960s.

Since then, however, the salience of the legal dispute has grown,
together with the continued opening of the Arctic Ocean, drawing
international interest and facilitating foreign access. Consequently,
[[Moscow]{.mark} has been increasingly [concerned about **foreign
military presence in the Arctic**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The growing
conventional capability gap between Russia and NATO may also increase
President Vladimir [Putin's **sense** of **vulnerability in the
Arctic**]{.underline}. At least 80 percent of Russian ground forces were
withdrawn from this area to support the war in Ukraine. Consequently,
preventing the erosion of Russian control has been high on the Russian
government's agenda. Since 2022, [Russia has taken]{.underline}
political, legal, and military [steps to]{.underline} further
**[restrict access]{.underline}** for foreign warships and
**[deter]{.underline}** a potential [**freedom** of **navigation**
operation in the region]{.underline}. Should that not work, the Northern
Fleet has been rehearsing "[repelling]{.underline} unauthorized passage
of [[foreign]{.underline}]{.mark} ships and
[[vessels]{.underline}]{.mark}" [that]{.underline} could [[**challenge**
**Russia's** **sovereignty** in Arctic waters.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Eyes North

All eyes should be on the High North, where a multinational
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} flotilla recently steamed
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}to [[northern waters]{.mark} to send a
**strong** **signal** of **[deter]{.mark}rence** to
**[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Warships from the United Kingdom,
Norway, Germany, Belgium, and France, with aircraft from the United
States, Finland, and Sweden, trained together in the region. At the
center of the exercise is HMS Queen Elizabeth, a British aircraft
carrier. This large naval exercise comes as NATO is strengthening its
defense and deterrence close to Russia's northern waters.

While a freedom of navigation operation has been under discussion for
years, there may be more appetite now than ever before. Following
Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, some [[NATO
nations]{.mark}]{.underline} may [have a **greater [desire]{.mark}** [to
apply **pressure**]{.mark} to **Russia**, particularly to a **sensitive
region** like the Arctic]{.underline}. NATO is [**keen [to deter
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} and may see an Arctic freedom of
navigation operation as a good opportunity to demonstrate NATO's ability
to operate jointly in a remote region that Russia considers its
backyard. While [[the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[orthern
[S]{.mark}ea [R]{.mark}oute]{.underline}** itself does not hold great
importance to NATO naval operations, the Barents Sea is Russia's pathway
to the North Atlantic, and [[is]{.mark} **[critical]{.mark}** in
**undersea** and **transatlantic strategy.**]{.underline}

Naval exercises in the High North were ticking upwards in scale and
frequency before Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. For
example, in 2020, a U.S. and U.K. surface action group conducted
exercises in the Barents and Norwegian seas, rehearsing anti-submarine
warfare with a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine and marine patrol and
reconnaissance aircraft. In 2019, a U.S. surface action group also
operated north of the Arctic Circle. In 2018, elements of the Harry S.
Truman Strike Group participated in NATO exercise Trident Juncture in
the region, for the first time since the end of the Cold War. This was
yet another sign of a more assertive U.S. stance in the region
demonstrated by periodically deploying strategic capabilities. Recently
departed U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Michael Gilday spoke out in
support of a regular massive naval exercise in the Arctic, using RIMPAC
--- the world's largest international maritime exercise --- as an
example and calling for its equivalent in the Arctic.

The increase in [**scope** and **quantity** of
[U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} surface naval [[operations]{.mark} in the
High North [send a **clear signal** of]{.mark} renewed [U.S.
interest]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}, and commitment to
[[restoring **presence**]{.underline}]{.mark} and familiarity. More is
yet to come: in April 2023, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro noted
that the U.S. Navy is increasing its operations in the Arctic in
partnership with allies, and called for "a lot more work and a lot more
commitment" to operations in the region.

Why Is the Northern Sea Route a Problem?

Russia has accused the [[Western states]{.underline}]{.mark} of attempts
to "internationalize" the Northern Sea Route by changing its legal
status. The fear materialized in 2018, when a French naval logistics
ship conducted what was a de facto freedom of navigation exercise
through the Northern Sea Route. The "Rhone" transit, which was
[[intend]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [[to **contest Russian territorial
claims**]{.underline}]{.mark}, was conducted without making a formal
request for permission. France employed a logistics vessel rather than a
warship, though, possibly to send a less threatening message and lower
risks.

In the following years, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[taken]{.underline} further [**[steps]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} [strengthen
its **jurisdiction** over the N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea
[R]{.mark}oute]{.underline}, and possibly deter NATO countries from
venturing into these waters. Among recent examples, the Russian Ministry
of Defence proposed to adjust the 1998 law on Internal Sea Waters,
Territorial Sea and Adjacent Zone of the Russian Federation. The
objective has been to [**[tighten]{.mark}** the **[rules]{.mark}** for
access of foreign warships and other non-commercial government
vessels]{.underline} to Russian territorial waters, internal waters,
naval bases, and seaports, including [along the Northern Sea
Route.]{.underline}

The new regulations, signed by Putin in December 2022, require an
application for permission to enter 90 days before the intended passage.
What is novel in the updated regulations is a restriction to no more
than "one foreign warship" in these waters at a time. The new
regulations are intended as an additional security measure to prevent
NATO and other countries from posing a threat to Russia. The
requirements apply only to the Northern Sea Route's internal waters,
which constitute a relatively small portion of the maritime channel.
Importantly, however, it covers all four of the disputed straits.

As Russo-Western relations have deteriorated, the Russian military has
been badly attrited, increasing the disparity in conventional forces
with NATO. The sanctions have also undermined the Russian economy and
may make rebuilding the military more difficult. This partly explains
why, despite the disastrous war in Ukraine, Russia has continued to
devote a significant attention to the Arctic. The region continues to
support the core of Russian military strategy, such as maintaining
nuclear deterrence and second-strike capability concentrated in the Kola
Peninsula. Russia has also systematically used forces deployed in the
region in direct assaults on Ukraine, including ground, naval, and air
assets. Since the start of the reinvasion, the Russian authorities have
highlighted the importance of the Arctic as a "vital" region in
strategic policy documents, high-level statements, and military
activity. An [Arctic freedom of navigation [operation led by the
**U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline} or another key NATO
country could be [seen by Russia as an attempt to [**test**
**Moscow's**]{.mark}]{.underline} resolve and
[**[capabilities]{.mark}**, as well as establishing a precedent for
others to follow]{.underline}. [It would likely be a **high-level test**
for both sides.]{.underline}

Given all these factors, what might a freedom of navigation operation
along the Northern Sea Route look like? The new Russian legislation
opens additional opportunities. A pair of [**warships** could
[**challenge** **Russia's claims**]{.mark}]{.underline}, by entering the
Kara Gate without requesting permission. The most likely opportunity for
conducting such an operation would be in September, when the annual sea
ice in the area is at its minimum.

The U.S. Navy has frequently operated in the High North with allies and
it is likely that a freedom of navigation operation along the Northern
Sea Route would be a multilateral operation. Such an approach would also
strengthen the message of NATO unity. Given the United Kingdom's
interest and increased activity in the High North, it appears a likely
partner. Norway's extensive knowledge of the area and the Russian
military would be an important asset, though it is less likely that the
Norwegian government would directly join the operation, given
differences in naval potential and ambition.

Geographically, the [transit]{.underline} passage could [run in close
proximity to **critical Russian military infrastructure**]{.underline}
in the region. Although not formally part of the Northern Sea Route, the
passage of ships in this area would likely bring them close to [the Kola
Peninsula,]{.underline} which **[hosts bases]{.underline}** for Russian
nuclear-armed submarines. Importantly, some parts of the Northern Sea
Route are significantly more sensitive than others. The passage through
the Kara Gate south of Novaya Zemlya is one example. Novaya Zemlya is
Russia's nuclear weapons test area and now is a test bed for new weapon
systems. It is also the location of an air base at Rogachevo. Likewise,
Moscow would likely be concerned about what foreign sensors may catch at
the bottom of the sea.

What's at Stake?

A freedom of navigation [**[operation]{.mark}** in the **region**
[carries]{.mark} **[inherent]{.mark} risks**]{.underline}. The
[**[Kremlin]{.mark}** has **cultivated** the [**image** of **Russia** as
the **leading Arctic power**]{.mark}]{.underline} and this is a potent
domestic symbol of national strength and pride. Under current domestic
conditions, Russia's political response is difficult to predict. It
remains equally uncertain how such an operation would be handled by the
Russian commander once ships meet, especially if the commander is under
pressure: What would be his reading of the situation, of NATO's
intentions, and of Moscow's wishes? The potential [for misunderstanding
cannot be excluded]{.underline}. As recent Russian exercises have
attempted to demonstrate, [the Northern Fleet]{.underline}, possibly
supported by the border guard of the Federal Security Service,
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} attempt to **[[block
passage]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We could see Russian commanders
operating in unsafe proximity to U.S. and NATO platforms, as often
demonstrated in the Black Sea region.

Furthermore, there are operational risks involved in high-latitude
operations. The Russian Arctic, especially the eastern parts of the
Northern Sea Route, is a harsh and unforgiving operational environment,
remote and with scarce infrastructure. Naval exercises at lower
latitudes --- notably Trident Juncture --- faced hardships operating in
the Arctic environment. The conditions are rapidly evolving and there is
a possibility of drifting ice even in summer months, so the ships making
the passage should be therefore ice-strengthened or have icebreaker
escort. This would require assistance from the U.S. Coast Guard or an
icebreaker from a NATO ally. Contingencies should be made for other
unforeseen emergencies, too, including an accident during the passage,
either as a result of fire, technical malfunction, or natural disaster.

These physical challenges would likely be paired with a Russian
diplomatic and information offensive to pressure political leaders in
Washington and elsewhere. Russia could seek to exploit any freedom of
navigation operation by claiming it as a provocation and violation of
international and Russian law and sovereignty.

Hence, how, when, and with what capabilities to conduct a freedom of
navigation operation would need to be carefully calibrated and
coordinated with other allies in the region to manage risks.

Proponents of a freedom of navigation [[operation along the
N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea [R]{.mark}oute]{.underline} could argue
that it would build on the recent U.S. diplomatic
**[[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}** to excessive [[Russian legal
claims]{.underline}]{.mark}. Arguably, the longer a country waits to
act, the bigger challenge a freedom of navigation operation in the
region poses. The risk, of course, is that [[by not
conducting]{.underline}]{.mark} a freedom of navigation [[operation,
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} risks [[**sending** a **signal** to
**Moscow**]{.mark} that [it]{.mark} de facto **[accepts its territorial
claims]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Russia's weaknesses and struggles in
Ukraine could mean that it has limited capabilities and may choose to
avoid a direct confrontation with NATO.

#### **Belarus fertilizer disruption causes [global famine]{.underline}. [No]{.underline} fill in.**

A growing concern today is the [[**risk of global famine** due
to]{.mark} **potential [disruptions ]{.mark}**[in the **supply of
Belarusian potash**]{.mark}; as [**fertilizer** **shortages**]{.mark}
persist, the [threat]{.mark} of [**food insecurity** and **severe
hunger**]{.mark} **looms large**]{.underline} for millions
**[[worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Statistics from the United Nations World Food Programme reveal that
approximately 345 million people across 82 countries are currently
grappling with acute food insecurity. This figure is up from 282 million
at the end of 2021. Furthermore, up to 50 million people across 45
countries are on the brink of starvation.

[[**Fertilizers** are **pivotal** to]{.mark} achieving **[global food
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Amidst the ongoing fertilizer crisis,
which goes back to a similar situation in the 1970s, the [[importance of
potassium]{.mark}]{.underline} as one of the three primary crop
nutrients (alongside nitrogen and phosphorus) **[[cannot be
overstated]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The absence of these nutrients can
potentially reduce crop yield by as much as 50% for certain crops.

JSC Belaruskali, the only producer of [[potash]{.underline}
[fertilizers]{.underline}]{.mark} in Belarus and the world's
second-largest potash producer, used to account for 20% of global potash
trade. However, due to [[restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark} and sanctions
imposed on Belarusian potash and its sole producer by the US, the EU,
and certain EU members, the company's contribution to global production
and export plummeted to 10% by mid-2022. This has [[led]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} a]{.underline} global output reduction of 16.3% (or 5.9
million tonnes) and a [20.2% [decrease in global
exports]{.mark}]{.underline} (or 5.8 million tonnes) compared to the
same period in 2021.

Interestingly, other countries, including Russia, have been exempted
from these measures due to the humanitarian nature of the commodity.
Meanwhile, the [[**demand for potash** continues to grow in]{.mark} line
with the **increasing global population**]{.underline}. Due to the
lifecycle of potash production, any significant increase in capacity is
likely only in Canada, and not before 2025. Thus, [[**neither**
**Canada** **nor any other country can**]{.mark} **adequately**
[**compensate** for]{.mark} the volume of [**Belarusian potash** **taken
off the market**]{.mark}]{.underline} due to these restrictions in 2023
or 2024.

The [[**global food security situation worsens** as potash shortages
develop]{.underline}]{.mark}, [allowing other global suppliers to
**exploit the situation**]{.underline}, inflate prices, and increase
profits. This trend consequently [places]{.underline} [a [**financial**
**burden** on farmers,]{.mark} **negatively [impacts
yields]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and contributes to rising **[food
prices.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In light of the **[[significant risk to global food
security]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [Belarus appeals]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} the international community for assistance in exempting
**[Belarusian potash]{.underline}** **[[from]{.underline}]{.mark}**
these **[[restrictions and]{.underline}]{.mark}** restoring
un**[[hindered transit of its fertilizers to global
markets]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [including those in]{.underline} Latin
America, **[Asia]{.underline}**, and Africa. Belarus also offers,
unconditionally, its territory as a transit route for Ukrainian grain to
reach Baltic Sea ports.

Food systems today face interconnected, systemic risks that could
culminate in widespread disruptions triggering extreme **[[global
famine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in addition to neglected extreme risks.
This paper introduces the concept of Global Catastrophic Food Failure
(GCFF) to describe such scenarios; where [food]{.underline} [shortages
[**overwhelm** **response**]{.mark} capacities of
governments]{.underline} and private sectors, necessitating
extraordinary interventions. While the exact likelihood of GCFFs is
uncertain, **[[consequences]{.mark} would be
[profound]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Currently, GCFF is a blind spot
requiring research and policy efforts [[to]{.mark}]{.underline}
strengthen food systems\' resilience and [[**capacity** to **sustain
humanity**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Main

History is full of examples where catastrophic events like war, disease
or climate shifts led to local [disruptions of the food
system]{.underline}. This in turn triggered
**[[famine]{.underline}]{.mark}** and often a [[collapse
of]{.underline}]{.mark} local **[[population]{.underline}]{.mark}**
numbers¹. Today\'s [[food security]{.mark} is strongly [reliant
on]{.mark}]{.underline} global food and energy
[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark}, as many countries are net food importers
2,3. This means that many [[events]{.mark} that would impact
**humanity\'s food system today**]{.underline} could **[be [felt
globally]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The recent
[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 pandemic [and]{.underline} geopolitical
tensions like the Russia-[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} conflict have
[underscored the [**vulnerability** of]{.mark} global [food]{.mark}
systems]{.underline}3,4. [The [current]{.mark} global food [system is
**precariously balanced**, prone to **major disruptions** that could
**trigger catastrophic food shor**]{.mark}**tages**]{.underline} greater
than 5% of global calorie supply. Reliance on intensive industrial
methods and global supply-chains has locked the food system into
unstable self-undermining dynamics that disrupt yields and supply
chains5,6. [[**Dependence** on **global supply chains** means
**disruptions**]{.mark} in one region can **[cascade]{.mark}**,
impacting food availability and prices elsewhere]{.underline}. Current
[research]{.underline} on the food system has mostly [focused on
specific risks separately]{.underline} (e.g., climate change or trade
shock), so we propose a [new concept]{.underline} to [integrate
different types of [risk]{.mark} in an **[interconnected]{.mark}
manner.**]{.underline}

We introduce the term **[[\'Global Catastrophic Food
Failure\']{.underline}]{.mark}** [(**GCFF**)]{.underline} as [a type of
[**global** **catastrophic risk**]{.mark}]{.underline}, to help bring
together different strands of research that are all focused on ensuring
food availability on a global scale. The benefits of adopting this new
term include:

Highlighting worst-case scenarios: GCFF emphasizes the need for robust
contingency planning by considering catastrophic events that could
drastically reduce global food production and supply

Catalyzing proactive risk management: GCFF shifts the focus from
reactive crisis management to anticipatory resilience-building by
identifying vulnerabilities and implementing risk reduction measures,
including through policymaking.

What is a Global Catastrophic Food Failure?

We define a Global Catastrophic Food Failure (GCFF) as an extreme,
widespread food supply shortage beyond the capacity of national
governments, international institutions, and the private sector to
manage through ordinary means. The shortage occurs in a few years or
less, triggered, either by an exceptional natural or human-caused event
such as a volcanic eruption or a nuclear attack, or by a more gradual
systemic crisis.

A GCFF is characterized by a severe reduction in the availability of
staple foods such as grains, legumes, and vegetables, leading to a
caloric deficit of at least 5% of global food supply or access. A GCFF
would be identified by a combination of factors, such as: rapid and
sustained increase in global food prices, widespread reports of food
shortages and hunger across multiple regions, depletion of strategic
food reserves without prospects for replenishment, breakdown of normal
food supply chains and distribution networks, and inadequacy of
emergency food assistance to meet the scale of need. Without effective
and timely intervention, a [[GCFF]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[result in
widespread starvation]{.mark}, causing [**tremendous** **suffering**,
**loss of life**]{.mark}, and **severe** [**disruptions** to]{.mark}
**national [governments]{.mark}**[, **i**]{.mark}**nternational
[r]{.mark}elations,** and]{.underline} social and **[[global
security]{.underline}.]{.mark}**

Defining Characteristics and Elements of GCFF

The [**[catastrophic nature]{.mark}** of a GCFF is defined by the
**[extreme severity]{.mark}** of its effects]{.underline}. In the
following we outline a range of criteria which we think cover this
severity:

Rapid Onset: a [[GCFF]{.mark} would [**occur** **suddenly**]{.mark} and
with **little warning**]{.underline}. This is important to differentiate
a GCFF from catastrophes that allow for significant time to implement
adaptations within regular coping capacity, or could be mostly resolved
by using existing food stocks. A GCFF would, in expectation, be
triggered by abrupt events and exacerbated by [a]{.underline}n abrupt
shock or [**stressor** **event**]{.underline} that [[triggers a **rapid
onset** **cascade** of **failures** across **multiple
components**]{.mark} of the system.]{.underline}

Extended Duration: While abruptness is a key factor in the onset of a
GCFF, the longevity of the crisis is equally crucial. Short-term shocks
lasting less than a year might be buffered by global trade and food
stockpiles. However, a GCFF is characterized by its potential to persist
for multiple years, severely testing humanity\'s limited resilience to
prolonged periods of low food production.

Limited Resilience: Chronic food security issues, while serious, often
allow for some level of adaptation and resilience-building over time.
Communities and nations can implement long-term strategies to mitigate
chronic food shortages. In contrast, the abrupt, extreme, and protracted
nature of GCFFs leaves little room for preparation or adaptation, making
them much harder to address effectively.

Extreme Magnitude: GCFFs are defined by their extreme and unparalleled
magnitude. Since the industrial revolution we have not seen a global
[[drop in]{.mark} globally available [food]{.mark}]{.underline} on such
a scale. These events have the potential to [[affect **not** **just one
region**]{.mark} or a particular group of people, [but]{.mark} to have
**[global]{.mark} repercussions**.]{.underline} The scale of [food
scarcity]{.underline} and its [impact on **populations**
**worldwide**]{.underline} is significantly greater in a GCFF compared
to chronic food security issues.

High Humanitarian Impact: GCFFs result in an immediate and profound
humanitarian crisis. They can lead to [[**widespread**]{.mark}
**famine**, malnutrition, and **[death on a massive
scale.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The urgency of responding to prevent such
a crisis is paramount due to the potential loss of life and suffering it
entails.

[Global Interconnectedness]{.underline}: [[In]{.mark} today\'s
[interconnected world]{.mark}, **[disruptions]{.mark}** in one part of
the globe can **quickly [affect others]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[GCFF]{.underline}]{.mark}s can arise when a global catastrophe
[[triggers a **domino** **effect**]{.mark}, [impacting]{.mark}
**[supply]{.mark} chains,** [**economies**,]{.mark} and
**[geopolitical]{.mark} [stability]{.mark}**, further **exacerbating**
their **acute** **nature**.]{.underline} The global food trade system
seems to be especially vulnerable to such systemic risks.

Causal dynamics of a GCFF

Figure 1 presents an event tree diagram that maps out potential
cascading impacts and feedback loops that could arise from a large-scale
volcanic eruption, leading to a Global Catastrophic Food Failure (GCFF).

Figure 1. Event-tree causality for a GCFF based on two potential
mechanisms.

The diagram illustrates how an abrupt climate change event could lead to
a multiple breadbasket failure, which could cause a breakdown of global
food trade or the continuation of trade with adaptations. A breakdown in
trade could result in [[widespread **food shortages**]{.mark} and
**price spikes**,]{.underline} which might [[trigger
**hoarding**]{.mark} and **[panic buying]{.mark} behaviors** that
further **[exacerbate]{.mark}** the **[crisis]{.mark}** as **[feedback
loops]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ultimately, this could lead to a breakdown
of the food system structures and GCFF.

Potential GCFF scenarios

While it is heartening to note that large-scale famines have been
decreasing over time due to advances in agricultural science,
international aid, and improved global food distribution¹, it is
essential to recognize that the specter of famine has not been banished
from reality. The following scenarios provide examples of triggers that
could generate such food system failures leading to famine:

Abrupt Sunlight Reduction Scenarios (ASRSs)

Abrupt Sunlight Reduction Scenarios represent a subset of the most
extreme food catastrophes, where a sudden catastrophic event leads to a
massive release of aerosol materials, such as sulfates or black carbon
(soot), into the stratosphere. This, in turn, causes an abrupt reduction
in absorbed solar radiation reaching Earth\'s surface, global
temperatures, and precipitation levels, which could swiftly trigger
near-total global [agricultural collapse]{.underline} and [[**push
billions** of **people into starvation**]{.underline}]{.mark} if proper
planning and preparedness are lacking⁹.

Three potential mechanisms for ASRSs have been identified in the
literature:

Volcanic Winter: A large volcanic eruption can inject a substantial
amount of aerosols into the stratosphere, leading to a volcanic winter
scenario. While the triggering of such winter scenarios is rare,
volcanic eruptions of this magnitude occur every 400-600 years¹⁰, and
have had devastating consequences for global agriculture¹¹.

Asteroid or Comet Impact Winter: An exceptionally large asteroid or
comet impact can also propel significant amounts of aerosols into the
stratosphere, causing a sudden reduction in sunlight. Although the
likelihood of such impacts is exceedingly low, their potential impact is
catastrophic¹².

**[Nuclear Winter:]{.underline}** A [[nuclear winter could
be]{.underline} [triggered by]{.underline}]{.mark} [a **large-scale
[nuclear war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly one in which numerous
cities are targeted. The subsequent [**firestorms** could
[inject]{.mark} **substantial [soot]{.mark}** into the **stratosphere**,
**[prolonging]{.mark}** the **[nuclear winter]{.mark} for**
years]{.underline}¹³.

Historical Case-study: Tambora Eruption of 1815

In April 1815, Mount Tambora in Indonesia erupted in one of the most
significant volcanic events in recorded history. The eruption was so
massive that it injected an enormous amount of ash and sulfur dioxide
into the atmosphere (estimated to be 50-70 megatons of sulfur
dioxide)¹⁴. The subsequent cooling of the Earth\'s climate resulted in
widespread crop failures, food shortages, and famines in many parts of
the world¹¹. The year 1816 became known as the \"Year Without a
Summer,\" as the Northern Hemisphere experienced unusually cold and
harsh weather conditions during the summer months. The consequences of
the Tambora eruption underscore the potential impact of extreme volcanic
events on global food security.

A GCFF may also emerge as a consequence of more gradual systemic crises.
These include, but are not limited to: extreme weather-induced crop
failures and yield reductions, loss of pollinators, collapse of critical
infrastructures supporting food production and distribution, and
breakdown of international trade and cooperation. Thus GCFF mitigation
could particularly benefit from methodologies and insights at the
intersection of **[global catastrophic risk]{.underline}** studies and
systemic risk studies

Trade Disruption Scenarios

[Trade disturbances would directly affect]{.underline} populations
dependent on **[food imports]{.underline}**, which have grown
substantially in recent decades². [Domestic **[food]{.mark}**
[production **reliant** on imported]{.mark} agricultural [inputs such as
**fertilizers**]{.mark}]{.underline}, pesticides, feeds, and machinery
would also be severely impacted⁵. [[Under]{.mark} a scenario
of]{.underline} a 50% **[[shock to the supply]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} key inputs like
**[[fertilizers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, pesticides and machinery,
[global [**maize** and **wheat**]{.mark} production could
decrease]{.underline} by up to 26% and 21% respectively, with
[high**-yielding food production areas** [hit]{.mark} the
[hard]{.mark}est]{.underline}¹⁵.

Several potential [[mechanisms]{.mark} could [trigger]{.mark} such
devastating [trade disturbances]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[includ]{.underline}]{.mark}[ing]{.underline} pandemics and the
containment measures imposed by governments, wars and [conflicts that
disrupt]{.underline} [supply chains and [trade
routes]{.mark}]{.underline}, and **[[blockages of critical trade
chokepoints]{.underline}]{.mark}** like the Suez Canal incident in 2021.
While certain disruption events alone may not cause a GCFF,
[[**compounding** risk]{.mark}]{.underline} and
**[[cascades]{.underline}]{.mark}** may lead to it, [given the deeply
interconnected nature of the global food system.]{.underline}

[[Humans have **fought over food**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and the means
of producing it [for **20,000 years**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as rock art
in Australia shows]{.underline}. [[Food]{.underline}]{.mark}, water
[[and land scarcity]{.underline} [are **primary drivers**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} two thirds of [[modern
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} today. Indeed, [many people seem to have
forgotten that the primary German war aim in **World War II** was to
take **farmland** from the Soviets and put German farmers on
it.]{.underline} It is very likely that [controlling the Ukraine's
bountiful and reliable food bowl is among **Putin's** main
aims]{.underline} also. In the short run this is imposing hunger and
even starvation on hundreds of millions of people far beyond Europe. 

**[Spreading [hunger]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in turn [**snowballs** into
**government failures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[civil
wars]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[refugee
tsunamis]{.underline}**]{.mark} [around the world]{.underline} -- as it
did in 2008 when a shortfall in Ukrainian grain exports led to
revolutions in three Arab countries. Already, a third of a billion
people -- equal to the entire population of Europe -- leave their homes
each year, either as refugees or economic migrants, to seek better lives
in countries which seem more stable and food secure. War will add to the
flood.

Thus, in developing a new food system for the world of the 21st Century,
we also have to find a way to curb the human appetite for war.

In [Food or

[Humanity is facing its **greatest test**]{.underline} [in the
million-year ascent of our kind.]{.underline} This [isn't a]{.underline}
**[single]{.underline}** [challenge]{.underline}. It's [a]{.underline}
**[constellation]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[huge man-made
threats]{.underline}**, now coming together [to]{.underline}
**[overshadow]{.underline}** our civilisation's stability and even,
maybe, its **[future survival]{.underline}**. These ten intersecting
risks are: ecological collapse, resource depletion, weapons of mass
destruction, climate change, global poisoning, food insecurity,
population and urban failure, pandemic disease and uncontrolled new
technologies (like killer robots, artificial intelligence and universal
surveillance) -- reinforced by a prodigious capacity for human
self-delusion. But sticking our heads in the sand and trying to ignore
them will not remove the danger.

These threats are known as **['[existential
risks']{.mark}]{.underline}** because they [[imperil]{.mark}
our]{.underline} **[future [existence]{.mark}]{.underline}**, both as
individuals, as a civilisation and maybe even [[as a]{.underline}
**[species]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Their most important feature is the fact that [they are]{.underline}
**[not isolated]{.underline}** from one another. [They are]{.underline}
[**deeply interwoven**. They]{.underline} **[play into]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [**feed one another**. They]{.underline} **[cannot be
addressed separately]{.underline}** or singly, because to do so creates
a situation where curbing one risk only makes other risks worse.
Together they constitute [a]{.underline} **[single existential
emergency]{.underline}** [facing]{.underline} **[all of
humanity]{.underline}**.

An example of why they cannot be addressed piecemeal is trying to solve
the global food problem by intensifying agriculture worldwide using
fossil fuels, fertilisers and petrochemicals: this will only destroy the
very climate, resources and ecosystem services on which agriculture,
itself, depends -- and is not, consequently, a viable or enduring
solution. Other answers must be sought. Another example is that trying
to end the Sixth Extinction of wildlife on our planet by turning half of
it back to forest and grassland will not work on its own, because it
would involve the sacrifice of half the current human food supply:
consequently, we need a solution that achieves both aims -- sustainable
food for all and a sufficient haven for the Earth's other species. So,
the problem of extinction needs to be solved, in part, by solving the
problem of food -- and that, in turn, entails solving the problems of
climate, global poisoning, resource depletion and other mega-risks. It
is absolutely clear from this that the solutions we adopt must be
cross-cutting. They must comprehensively address all the perils we face,
not just one or a handful of them.

Take these ten great risks together and what you have is the focal issue
of our time -- the greatest and most profound challenge ever to confront
human civilisation. The risks are all selfinflicted, a direct result of
the overgrowth in human numbers and our unbridled demands on the planet
-- for food, resources, space and a healthy environment. By solving them
together, we ensure our future. By denying them or failing to solve them
all in time, we knowingly create untold misery and suffering for most of
humanity and generations to come through the centuries ahead. We are
gambling with the very survival of our civilisation and species. The
risks are described below, along with observations about how they play
into the Food or War scenario. The detail, the scientific sources and
the solutions, collective and individual, to each risk are described in
more detail in Surviving the 21st Century.

Extinction and Ecological Collapse

More than half of the large animals that once inhabited the Earth have
been wiped from it by human action since 1970, according to the
Worldwide Fund for Nature's Living Planet Index.3 So, too, have half the
fish in the sea on which humans rely for food.4 Humans are, in the words
of the great biologist E. O. Wilson, 'tearing down the biosphere',
demolishing the very home that keeps us alive.5

Extinction, it should be noted, is a part of life: 99.9 per cent of all
species ever to evolve on this planet have disappeared, and new ones
like ourselves have arisen to replace them. But extinction rates like
today's -- a hundred to a thousand times faster than normal -- are a
freak occurrence that usually takes tens of millions of years, not mere
decades. Animal, plant and marine species are presently vanishing so
fast that scientists have dubbed our time "the Sixth Extinction" -- the
sixth such megadeath in the geological history of the Earth.6 By the end
of the present century, Wilson says, it is possible that up to half of
the eight million species thought to exist here will be gone.
Furthermore, in all previous extinctions, natural events like asteroid
strikes and vast volcanic outbursts have been to blame. This will be the
only time in the Earth's history when the wipe-out was caused by a
single species. Us.7

The probability of humans becoming extinct during the twentyfirst
century is not high -- but there are scenarios, such as an all-out
nuclear war, runaway climate change (+5--10 C or more), or a compound
collapse in the Earth's main life support systems, in which it must be
regarded as a possibility -- and the fact that it is unpleasant to
contemplate is no excuse for doing nothing to stop it.

However, there are also a number of credible scenarios in which
large-scale ecosystem collapse could endanger civilisation and cause
very high mortality among the world's population. These revolve around
the notion of 'environmental security' which is, in turn, very closely
tied to human security -- i.e. peace or war. An ecosystem is a
biological community of mutually dependent species -- and the removal of
one species after another can undermine it and render it dysfunctional,
in the same way that pulling one brick at a time out of your home will
eventually cause it to fall down. Ecosystems support all life on the
planet, and maintain the quality of air, water and soil on which it
depends. For humans, they provide food and clean water (provisioning
services), disease and climate regulation (regulatory services),
spiritual and aesthetic fulfilment (cultural services), useful chemical
energy (from plants) and soil formation (support services). As
ecosystems decay, the decline and loss of these services often causes
significant harm to human wellbeing and can inflame the tensions that
lead to conflict.

The most destructive object on the planet, as we noted in Chapter 3, is
the human jawbone. The need to keep it fed is responsible, every year,
for the loss of up to 75 billion tonnes of topsoil, the wasting of six
trillion tonnes of water, the release of five million tonnes of
pesticides, and 30 per cent of the world's climate-wrecking carbon
emissions. In addition, the contemporary food system is the chief driver
of deforestation, desertification, wildlife extinctions and impaired
ecosystems. Among the most striking examples of food's impact on the
wild world are the 400+ 'dead zones' spreading through the world's
oceans from the Arabian Sea, to the Baltic and the Mississippi delta.
These are oxygenless layers in the sea, where fish cannot survive. They
are caused by topsoil dislodged by land clearing, over-farming and
over-grazing, the use of huge quantities of artificial fertilisers,
toxic chemicals and human sewage. Along with overfishing they contribute
to an ongoing collapse in world wild fisheries and are a clear example
of how the activity of one part of the food system can impair another.
Similarly, most inland rivers and lakes in populated regions are
eutrophic and polluted -- and no longer capable of producing as much
food as in the past. The loss of wild fisheries increases tensions
between nations and fishers over what remains and can lead to 'fish
wars'. 8

The existing global food production system is therefore a major
contributor to the decline and failure of ecosystem services needed to
support the human population. This in turn rebounds on the food system
itself. Furthermore, the extinction of wild animals and plants deprives
the food industry of many edible species that may be needed as part of a
healthy, diverse global diet in future.

The solution to the extinction crisis is to cease farming and grazing on
about half the currently farmed area of the planet (25 million square
kilometres), transfer food production to the cities where it can take
advantage of all the nutrients and water currently being wasted, and
employ many of the world's farmers and indigenous people as Stewards of
the Earth to manage the rewilding and regeneration of former farmlands.
Food production can continue on the remaining 24 million square
kilometres using eco-agriculture. This process is further described in
Surviving the 21st Century and in Chapter 9 of this book.

How the existing food system plays into the risk of war can also be
viewed through the lens of environmental security: war damages
environments, making it harder for humans to sustain and feed themselves
-- and ruined environments themselves become cauldrons of war. This is
plainly to be seen in the cases of Syria, South Sudan, Yemen and the
Horn of Africa. What we most need are food systems that do not cause
knock-on damage to either the environment and wildlife, the climate, the
oceans or to consumer health -- and which ease tensions, so promoting
peace, not conflict. These are described in Chapters 8 and 9.

Resource Scarcity

The average citizen of planet Earth today uses at least ten times the
volume of resources used by their grandparents a century ago. Since the
human population has also quadrupled over the same time, this means
humanity's gargantuan appetite for minerals, metals, timber, water, food
and energy has grown fortyfold in barely a hundred years. As the Global
Footprint Network explains, we are presently using enough 'stuff' for
1.6 Earths, not just the one we have. We now outrun the Earth's natural
ability to supply our needs in August each year.9 As with the mining of
groundwater, the decline and collapse of global resources like soil,
water and phosphorus, is often imperceptible to the individual: people
have simply no idea they are living on borrowed time and, with that,
comes enormous risk.

To make the issue of resource consumption a little more personal: you
(as an average individual citizen of the planet) will in your lifetime

> -- use 99,720 tonnes (i.e. 40 Olympic pools) of fresh water
>
> -- displace 750 tonnes of topsoil
>
> -- consume 720 tonnes of metals and materials
>
> -- use 80 billion joules of energy
>
> -- release 288 tonnes of CO2
>
> -- release 320 kilograms of toxic chemicals
>
> -- waste 13.4 tonnes of food
>
> -- destroy 800 square metres of forest.

Because of the long, cryptic, industrial and international trade chains
which hide it, most of us are unaware of the vast damage we do to the
planet through our simple habit of shopping.

Yes, some of us have a notion that some of our purchases may be bad for
gorillas in the Congo, orangutans in Borneo or flamingos in the Atacama
-- but we mostly have no true appreciation of the wider havoc we inflict
on the Earth and its natural systems by the 'innocent' act of
consumption, which business and governments try constantly to convince
us is essential to 'growth and jobs'.

It should therefore come as no surprise that the world finds itself
increasingly short of key resources like fresh water, soil, phosphorus,
timber and certain minerals -- and that these shortages are giving rise
to tensions and even to conflicts. Indeed, resource scarcity has for
some time been considered by strategic experts to be one of the most
likely causes of war in the twentyfirst century.10

However, people are not equally responsible for the devastation of
Planet Earth. The diagram below (Figure 6.1), from \[\[FIGURE 6.1
OMITTED\]\] Oxfam, illustrates how just one tenth of humanity consumes
five times as much in the way of material resources (expressed here in
the form of their carbon footprint) as the poorest half of the world
population. The affluent are chiefly responsible for the destruction
taking place on a global scale as they seek to sustain lifestyles that
the planet can no longer afford or support.

The significance of this blind spot around consumption for global food
security is very great. As described in earlier chapters, the world food
system depends critically on soil, water, nutrients and a stable
climate, to supply humanity's daily need for nutriment -- and all of
these essential resources are in increasingly short supply, chiefly
because of our own mismanagement of them and our collective failure to
appreciate that they are finite. On current trends, the existing food
system will tend to break down, first regionally and then globally,
owing to resource scarcity from the 2020s onward, and especially towards
the mid century -- unless there is radical change in the world diet and
the means by which we feed ourselves. This will lead to increasing
outbreaks of violence and war. Nobody, neither rich nor poor, will
escape the consequences.

Weapons of Mass Destruction

[Detonating just]{.underline} **[[50]{.underline}]{.mark}**--100 out of
the global arsenal of nearly 15,000 **[nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** [would]{.underline} [**suffice to [end
civilisation]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} a [**nuclear winter**,
causing]{.mark}]{.underline} **[worldwide [famine]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[economic collapse]{.underline}** [affecting
even]{.underline} **[distant]{.underline}** [nations]{.underline}, as we
saw in the previous chapter in the section dealing with South Asia.
**[Eight nations]{.underline}** now [have the power to]{.underline}
**[terminate civilisation]{.underline}** should they desire to do so --
[and]{.underline} **[two]{.underline}** [have the power to]{.underline}
**[[extinguish the]{.mark} human [species]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
According to the nuclear monitoring group Ploughshares, this arsenal is
distributed as follows:

> -- Russia, 6600 warheads (2500 classified as 'retired')
>
> -- America, 6450 warheads (2550 classified as 'retired')
>
> -- France, 300 warheads
>
> -- China, 270 warheads
>
> -- UK, 215 warheads
>
> -- Pakistan, 130 warheads
>
> -- India, 120 warheads
>
> -- Israel, 80 warheads
>
> -- North Korea, 15--20 warheads.11

Although actual numbers of warheads have continued to fall from its peak
of 70,000 weapons in the mid 1980s, scientists argue the danger of
nuclear conflict in fact increased in the first two decades of the
twenty-first century. This was due to the modernisation of existing
stockpiles, the adoption of dangerous new technologies such as robot
delivery systems, hypersonic missiles, artificial intelligence and
electronic warfare, and the continuing leakage of nuclear materials and
knowhow to nonnuclear nations and potential terrorist organisations.

In early 2018 the hands of the 'Doomsday Clock', maintained by the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, were re-set at two minutes to
midnight, the highest risk to humanity that it has ever shown since the
clock was introduced in 1953. This was due not only to the state of the
world's nuclear arsenal, but also to irresponsible language by world
leaders, the growing use of social media to destabilise rival regimes,
and to the rising threat of uncontrolled climate change (see below).12

In an historic moment on 17 July 2017, 122 nations voted in the UN for
the first time ever in favour of a treaty banning all nuclear weapons.
This called for comprehensive prohibition of "a full range of
nuclear-weapon-related activities, such as undertaking to develop, test,
produce, manufacture, acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons or
other nuclear explosive devices, as well as the use or threat of use of
these weapons."13 However, 71 other countries -- including all the
nuclear states -- either opposed the ban, abstained or declined to vote.
The Treaty vote was nonetheless interpreted by some as a promising first
step towards abolishing the nuclear nightmare that hangs over the entire
human species.

In contrast, 192 countries had signed up to the Chemical Weapons
Convention to ban the use of chemical weapons, and 180 to the Biological
Weapons Convention. As of 2018, 96 per cent of previous world stocks of
chemical weapons had been destroyed -- but their continued use in the
Syrian conflict and in alleged assassination attempts by Russia
indicated the world remains at risk.14

As things stand, the only entities that can afford to own nuclear
weapons are nations -- and if humanity is to be wiped out, it will most
likely be as a result of an atomic conflict between nations. It follows
from this that, if the world is to be made safe from such a fate it will
need to get rid of nations as a structure of human self-organisation and
replace them with wiser, less aggressive forms of self-governance. After
all, the nation state really only began in the early nineteenth century
and is by no means a permanent feature of self-governance, any more than
monarchies, feudal systems or priest states. Although many people still
tend to assume it is. Between them, nations have butchered more than 200
million people in the past 150 years and it is increasingly clear the
world would be a far safer, more peaceable place without either nations
or nationalism. The question is what to replace them with.

Although there may at first glance appear to be no close linkage between
weapons of mass destruction and food, in the twentyfirst century with
world resources of food, land and water under growing stress, nothing
can be ruled out. Indeed, chemical weapons have frequently been deployed
in the Syrian civil war, which had drought, agricultural failure and
hunger among its early drivers. And nuclear conflict remains a distinct
possibility in South Asia and the Middle East, especially, as these
regions are already stressed in terms of food, land and water, and their
nuclear firepower or access to nuclear materials is multiplying.

It remains an open question whether panicking regimes in Russia, the USA
or even France would be ruthless enough to deploy atomic weapons in an
attempt to quell invasion by tens of millions of desperate refugees,
fleeing famine and climate chaos in their own homelands -- but the
possibility ought not to be ignored.

That nuclear war is at least a possible outcome of food and climate
crises was first flagged in the report The Age of Consequences by Kurt
Campbell and the US-based Centre for Strategic and International
Studies, which stated 'it is clear that even nuclear war cannot be
excluded as a political consequence of global warming'. 15 Food
insecurity is therefore a driver in the preconditions for the use of
nuclear weapons, whether limited or unlimited.

[[A **global famine** is]{.mark} a **[likely]{.mark} outcome** [of
**limited use**]{.mark} of]{.underline} **[nuc]{.underline}**lear
weapon**[s]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[any country]{.underline}**
or countries -- [and would be]{.underline} **[unavoidable]{.underline}**
[in the event of an]{.underline} **[unlimited nuclear war]{.underline}**
[between]{.underline} [**America and Russia**, making it]{.underline}
**[unwinnable]{.underline}** for either. And [**that**, as
the]{.underline} mute [hands of the 'Doomsday Clock' so eloquently
admonish, is]{.underline} also [the]{.underline} [**[most likely
scenario]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[premature termination of the]{.mark} human
[species]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Such a grim scenario can be alleviated by two measures: the voluntary
banning by the whole of humanity of nuclear weapons, their technology,
materials and stocks -- and by a global effort to secure food against
future insecurity by diverting the funds now wasted on nuclear armaments
into building the sustainable food and water systems of the future (see
Chapters 8 and 9).

Climate Change

The effects of food and war on climate change as it is presently
predicted to occur were described in Chapter 3: in brief, the stable
climate in which agriculture arose over the past 6000 years is now
becoming increasingly unstable as a result of the billions of tonnes of
carbon that humans are injecting into the atmosphere and oceans, forming
a colossal heat engine to drive more frequent, violent weather. This in
turn impairs food production in regions of the world already facing
severe stresses from population growth and resource depletion. Military
analysts describe climate change as a 'threat multiplier', augmenting
the tensions, conflict and instability which already exist. In reality
it is a feedback loop, in which worsening climate conditions cause
greater food insecurity, which is met by measures (like increased land
clearing and use of fossil fuels and chemicals), which in turn worsen
climate conditions, which worsen food security, which cause wars, which
inflict more eco-damage\...

Two degrees (2 C) of global warming -- described as the danger point for
humanity -- are predicted to occur well before 2050 because of our
collective failure to curb our carbon emissions.16 Those 2 C of warming
portend bad things for any food system that depends on the weather --
but just how bad cannot easily be forecast as both the climate state and
the response of the global food system are governed by human behaviour,
which is fairly unpredictable. Current estimates suggest crop losses of
the order of 20--50 per cent at the very time we are trying to raise
food output by 50--70 per cent. What can be confidently predicted,
however, is that there will be an increase in both the frequency and
scale of harvest failures and agricultural disease outbreaks around the
world as we approach the mid century -- and that beyond 2 C of warming
it will become very hard indeed to maintain a stable outdoors,
agriculture-based system to meet an anticipated doubling in world demand
for food by the 2060s. The 'worst case' risk of this, as previously
outlined, would be ten billion people having to subsist on enough food
to feed only four billion.

That, however, is by no means the worst case of the climate story. There
are ominous signs that humans have already unleashed planetary forces
over which we have absolutely no control -- and that these, should they
become large enough, will take charge of the Earth's climate engine and
drive it into a superheated condition of +9--10 C or even higher.

Today, more people are aware that global warming may lead to complete
melting of all glaciers and the polar ice-caps, thereby raising sea
levels by 65 metres and inundating almost all of the world's seaboard
cities, fertile river deltas and coastal plains.17 This would clearly
have a devastating effect on coastal food production. However, this
process will probably take several centuries, allowing populations ample
time to relocate inland. That sea levels previously rose by a similar
quantum at the end of the last Ice Age, flooding part of Australia,
severing Britain from Europe and America from Asia, is proof enough that
such events occur as a regular part of the Earth's warming and chilling
cycles.

The great existential threat to humanity lies in vast stores of frozen
methane gas (CH4) locked into the soils of the tundra regions of Canada
and Siberia, in colossal deposits of frozen methane on the continental
seabed surrounding the Arctic Ocean, and in massive stores of methane
submerged in peat deposits and swamps in places such as the Amazon and
the wet tropical forests of Southeast Asia and Africa. Methane is a gas
with 20--70 times the climate-forcing power of carbon dioxide. These
deposits are the accumulation of the slow decomposition of planet and
animal matter in the Earth's sediments over several hundred million
years -- they are identical in origin to the gas bubbles that surface
when we stir the bed of a pond or lake.

The actual volume of these methane deposits is still being assessed by
science. Recent estimates suggest:

> • seabed deposits -- between 500--2500 billion tonnes of frozen
> carbon;18
>
> • tundra deposits -- potentially emitting 180--420 million tonnes of
> carbon a year by 2100; and
>
> • tropical peat swamps -- could emit 480--870 million tonnes of carbon
> a year by 2100.19

That carbon released from peat swamps, tundra and possibly the oceans
can have a catastrophic effect on the Earth's climate is foreshadowed by
an event known as the Palaeocene--Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which
took place some 55 million years ago, when Earth took a sudden fever and
its temperature rocketed upwards by +5--9 C. This 'heat spike' caused a
lesser extinction event involving widespread loss of ocean life and a
smaller toll of land animals.20 However, the heating occurred over a
much longer period -- 100--200,000 years, compared with human-driven
heating (50--100 years) -- and is thought to have been mainly caused by
the drying out and burning of tropical peat swamps as the climate
warmed. However, the volume of carbon which caused this sharp planetary
heat spike in the past is estimated to be barely a tenth of that
released by humanity today.21

Today, human activity in clearing rainforests, draining swamps and
burning the world's forests to open them up for farming and food
production is releasing vast amounts of methane and CO2. Explosion
craters have been reported across Canada and Siberia as frozen methane
deposits well up and erupt with the melting of the tundra. And
scientists from Sweden, Russia, Canada and America have reported methane
bubbling from the seabed of the Arctic Ocean, though not yet in massive
volumes. The risk in all this is that, by warming the planet by only
1--2 C, we have set in train natural processes that we are powerless to
control, setting ourselves on an inescapable trajectory to a Hothouse
Earth, 5--10 C or more above today's levels.

Although it is hard to estimate, some scientists are of the view that
fewer than one billion humans would survive such an event22 -- in other
words, nine people out of every ten may perish in the cycle of famines,
wars, heatwaves and pandemic diseases which global overheating would
entail. This underlies the deadly urgency of ceasing to burn all fossil
fuels, locking up as much carbon as possible and re-stabilising the
Earth's climate. In that, food production can and will play a central
role.

This is a summation of the chemical crisis facing all of humanity, as
well as all life on Earth, which I wrote in Surviving the 21st Century,
and which is based on the extensive scientific research reported in
Poisoned Planet.23 It is a crisis with profound impact for everyone.

According to the medical journal The Lancet, nine million people -- one
in six -- die every year from chemical pollution of their air, water,
food and living environment.24 A further 40 million die from the
so-called noncommunicable or 'lifestyle' diseases (NCDs), cancer, heart
disease, diabetes and lung disease, which are mostly diet-related.25

Food production, as we have seen, is deeply implicated in the chemical
deluge. However, it is also an existential threat to human health, both
in terms of infectious disease and the new 'lifestyle' diseases. No-one
to my knowledge has compiled an accurate assessment of the total
chemical effusion of humanity or presented a realistic impression of its
true scale. Box 6.1 represents my own best estimate, drawn from various
reliable sources.

From this it can easily be seen that the scale of humanity's chemical
assault on ourselves and on the planet is many times the scale of our
climate assault -- yet this issue commands nowhere near the political or
scientific priority that it should. It is arguably the most under-rated,
under-investigated and poorly understood of all the existential threats
to humanity.

The poisoning of the Earth by human activities has grave implications
for the health and safety of the global food chain and its eight billion
consumers. It is not only the use of chemicals in food production that
is of concern, but also the contamination of water, soils and livestock
by industrial pollutants from other sources, such as mining or
manufacturing. It is also the disruption of vital services such as
pollination by insects of a \[\[BOX 6.1 OMITTED\]\] third of the world's
food crops and 90 per cent of wild plants.26 It is the contamination of
up to three quarters of the world fish catch with microscopic plastic
particles and clothing microfibres made by the petrochemical industry.27

The ending of this flood of poisons is a prerequisite for a safe,
healthy and sustainable global food supply in future. And, since
government regulation has largely failed to stem the worldwide flood,
the task now falls to consumers -- to choose foods which have been
produced by safe methods and shun foods produced by unsafe methods. That
is the only way that the food industry can be encouraged (and penalised)
into doing the right thing by humanity and the planet: by consumers
rewarding it for producing clean food and punishing it for toxic food.
Otherwise it will continue to pollute as profitably as it can. It
follows that the urgent global education of consumers about which foods
are safe and which are toxic is also a pre-requisite.

Food Security

Our demand for food is set to double by the 2060s -- potentially the
decade of 'peak people', the moment in history when the irresistible
human population surge may top out at around 10 billion. However, as we
have seen, many of the resources needed to supply it agriculturally
could halve and the climate for the growing of food outdoors become far
more hostile.

Why [**[food insecurity]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark} [an
**[existential]{.mark} threat to humanity**]{.underline} should, by now,
be abundantly clear from the earlier chapters of this book: [present
systems are **unsustainable**]{.underline} [and, as they **fail**,
will]{.underline} [pose risks **both to civilization**]{.underline}
[and, should these **spiral into nuclear conflict**, to the **future of
the human species.**]{.underline}

The important thing to note in this chapter is that [food insecurity
plays into **many, if not all, of the other existential
threats**]{.underline} [facing humanity. The food sector's role in
**extinction**]{.underline}, **[resource scarcity]{.underline}**,
[global]{.underline} **[toxicity]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
potential **[nuclear war]{.underline}** [has]{.underline}
**[already]{.underline}** [been explained]{.underline}. [Its role in the
**suppression of conflict**]{.underline} is discussed in the next
chapter. [Its role in **securing the future of the
megacities**]{.underline}, [and of a largely **urbanised
humanity**]{.underline}, is covered in Chapter 8. And its role in
**[sustaining]{.underline}** [humanity through the **peak in
population**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[into a sustainable world
beyond]{.underline}** is covered in Chapter 9.

Food **[clearly]{.underline}** has a **[pivotal]{.underline}** role [in
the future of human population]{.underline} -- both as a driver of
population growth when supplies are abundant and [as a potential driver
of population **decline**, should food chains collapse. It is no
**exaggeration to state that the fate of civilisation depends on
it**]{.underline}.

Pandemic Disease

**[Disease [pandemics]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[have been]{.mark} a
well-known **[existential]{.mark}** risk to humanity since the **plague
of Athens**]{.underline} in 430 BC -- itself linked to a war. However, a
point that escapes many people nowadays is that, as [humans have become
**so numerous**]{.underline} -- indeed the predominant lifeform on the
planet -- [we have also become the major food source for many microbes.
We are now the 'living compost heap' on which they must dine and in
which they must reproduce]{.underline}, if they are themselves to
survive.

As our own population grows, [pandemics [are]{.mark} thus **[likely to
increase]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as more and more viruses and bacteria
are forced to take refuge in humans following the depletion or total
extinction of their natural hosts, the wild animals we are
exterminating. This process is greatly assisted by our creation of
megacities, tourism and air travel, schools and child-minding centres,
air-conditioned offices, night clubs, sex with strangers, pet and pest
animals, insects which prosper from climate change or human modification
of the environment (like mosquitoes), ignorance, poor public hygiene,
lack of clean water, and deficient food processing and handling.

So, [while humanity is confronted with an **ever-expanding array of
parasites**]{.underline}, [we are simultaneously doing everything in our
power to **distribute them worldwide in record time**]{.underline} [--
and to **seed new pandemics**. The]{.underline} **[W]{.underline}**orld
**[H]{.underline}**ealth **[O]{.underline}**rganisation [has
identified]{.underline} **[19]{.underline}** major **[infectious
diseases]{.underline}** [with potential to become]{.underline}
**[pandemic]{.underline}**: chikungunya, cholera, Crimean-Congo
haemorrhagic fever, Ebola, Hendra, influenza, Lassa fever, Marburg
virus, meningitis, MERS-CoV, monkeypox, Nipah, plague, Rift Valley
fever, SARS, smallpox, tularaemia, yellow fever and Zika virus
disease.28 While none of these is likely to fulfil the Hollywood horror
movie image of wiping out the human species -- for the simple reason
that viruses are usually smart enough to weaken to a sublethal state
once comfortably ensconced in their new host -- [the]{.underline}
**[apocalyptic horseman]{.underline}** [representing Pestilence and
Death will nevertheless continue to play a **[synergetic]{.mark} role**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} his companions [**[warfare]{.mark}**,
**famine**]{.underline}, climate change, global poisoning, ecological
collapse, urbanisation [and]{.underline} **[other existential
threats]{.underline}**.

**[Food insecurity]{.underline}** [affects the]{.underline}
**[progression of pandemic diseases]{.underline}**, often in ways that
are not entirely obvious. First, **[new pandemics]{.underline}** of
infectious disease [tend to [originate]{.mark}]{.underline} in
developing regions [[where]{.underline}
**[nutrition]{.underline}**]{.mark}[al **levels [are
poor]{.mark}**]{.underline} or agricultural practices favour the
evolution of novel pathogens such as, for example, the new flu strains
seen every year -- which arise mainly from places where people, pigs and
poultry live side-by-side and shuffle viruses between them -- and also
novel diseases like SARS and MERS. Second, because totally unknown
diseases tend to arise first in places where rainforests are being cut
down for farming and viruses hitherto confined to wild animals and birds
make an enforced transition into humans. Examples of novel human
diseases escaping from the rainforest and tropical savannah in recent
times include HIV/AIDS, Hendra, Nipah, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Hanta,
Lujo, Junin, Machupo, Rift Valley, Congo and Zika.29 And thirdly,
because the loss of vital micronutrients from heavily farmed soils and
from food itself predisposes many populations to various deficiency
diseases -- for example, a lack of selenium in the diet has been linked
with increased risk from both HIV/AIDS and bowel cancer.30 A key synergy
is the way **[[hunger]{.mark} and malnourishment]{.underline}**
**[[exacerbate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the spread of

**[1918]{.underline}** Global Flu **[Pandemic]{.underline}** which

war-torn Yemen. In a fresh twist, Dr Melinda Beck of North Carolina
University has demonstrated that **[obesity]{.underline}** [-- itself a
form of malnutrition -- may cause increased deaths from influenza by
both aiding the virus and suppressing the patient's immune
response.31]{.underline}

**[[Economy-Wide Impact]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The disruptions caused by the war on Ukraine and the ensuing
intensification of international sanctions have greatly affected the
Belarusian economy. In the period January to May 2022 Belarus\'s exports
dropped by 4.2% year-on-year, to \$17.4 billion.31 According to
Belarus\'s Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko, by the month of May,
Western sanctions had blocked \$16 - \$18 billion worth of Belarus\'
exports in 2022, which accounted for \"almost all of Belarus\'s exports
to the European Union and North America.\"32 Despite the rise in
petrochemical product prices, Belarus\'s top export, Belarusian oil
refineries are struggling after losing one of their biggest markets,
Ukraine, as well as major export routes through neighboring countries.
Foreign reserves are expected to contract. In 2022, Belarus\'s GDP is
estimated to have dropped by 7% while the inflation rate reached 19%.33
The government has even made increases in consumer prices illegal in an
effort to tame inflation.34

The Belarusian Potash Industry

The sanctions imposed on the **[[potash]{.underline}]{.mark}** sector
can help explain the **[[impact]{.underline}]{.mark}** of sanctions on
Belarusian SOEs and the [[**ripple** **effect** on the **Belarusian
economy**]{.mark} **as** a **whole**.]{.underline} With \$2.44 billion,
potassic fertilizers (potash) constituted [[8.7% of Belarus\'s total
exports]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2020, second only to exports of refined
petroleum, as demonstrated in Figure 10.35 As Figure 11 shows, Belarus
is the world\'s third producer of potash, after Canada and Russia.36
With about 10-12 million metric tons of potash exported annually,
Belarus provides around a fifth of the world\'s total potash exports.37
The largest buyer of Belarusian potash is Brazil, followed by China and
India. Figure 12 shows Belarusian fertilizer exports by destination.
Fertilizers, including potassic fertilizers, are key inputs in major
commodity crops such as corn and soybeans. Russia and Belarus together
account for 38% of global potassic fertilizer exports, 17% of compound
fertilizers, and 15% of nitrogenous fertilizers.38 The sanctions imposed
on Russia and Belarus have contributed to [[**fertilizer**
**shortages**]{.mark} and **price increases**,]{.underline} with
[[serious implications]{.mark} for global food security.]{.underline}
[**Fertilizer scarcity** could eventually lead to a **reduction** in
their use, which would]{.underline} further [[reduce
**ag**]{.mark}**ricultural [yield]{.mark}s** and **production**, fueling
more [food price increases]{.mark}]{.underline}.39

The main entity exploiting Belarusian potash reserves is Belaruskali,
one of the largest producers of potash fertilizer in the world and one
of the largest SOEs in Belarus. The Belarusian Potash Company (BPC) --
the country\'s sole potash exporter -- handles the trading and
**[[exportation of potash]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Belaruskali. BPC is
partially owned by Belaruskali, among other SOEs. The Belarusian potash
industry has been heavily targeted by sanctions and trade restrictions,
as it is highly state-controlled and helps **[[finance the Belarusian
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The [**[industry]{.mark}**
[provides]{.mark} the **Belarusian government** with **tax
[revenues]{.mark}**, as well as **[foreign currency]{.mark}** through

Trade restrictions by the EU were first imposed on Belaruskali on June
24, 2021. The US, UK and Canada introduced restrictions on August 9,
2021, and again on December 2, 2021. No restrictions were imposed on the
Belarusian Potash Company (BPC) at the time, allowing Belarus to
continue to export potash, albeit at lower volumes as many buyers turned
to other sources to mitigate uncertainty.44 Sanctions on Russian and
Belarusian potash contributed to price hikes which initially compensated
for the decreasing export volumes. BPC finally received US sanctions in
December 2021, along with BPC subsidiary Agrorozkvit, as well as
Slavkali, which produces potash fertilizers and was constructing a large
mining facility in Belarus.45 Total or partial bans on doing business
with Belaruskali, BPC, and other potash-related SOEs, as well as
restrictions against the imports of Belarusian potash products, were
greatly ramped up since the start of Russia\'s war against Ukraine. For
example, the EU sanctions package introduced on June 3, 2022 included
direct bans on Belaruskali and BPC, adding to the existing restrictions
on the import of Belarusian potash fertilizers into the bloc.

These sanctions and related financial and **[[logistical
restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark}** are proving to be
[**[devast]{.mark}ating** to [the Belarusian potash
sector]{.mark}]{.underline}, even though the bulk of Belarus\'s potash
exports goes to third-party countries. Landlocked Belarus shipped
virtually all of its potash exports north through Lithuania to the port
of Klaipėda on the Baltic Sea. However, on February 1, in response to
international sanctions, Lithuania terminated the contract between
Lithuanian Railways (LTG) and Belaruskali for the transit of potash
through Lithuanian territories to Klaipėda.46 Ukrainian Railways
(Ukrzaliznytsia) had also suspended Belarusian potash shipments through
Ukraine\'s territory to the port of Odessa shortly before the start of
the war.47

Although Russia's implosion suddenly releases Minsk from Moscow's
stranglehold, the severe recession in the Russian economy snowballs into
[an [**economic** **crisis in Belarus**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russian
subsidies and financial support diminish, while Russian demand for
Belarusian exports collapses and Belarus' own oil export revenues
plummet. [An **already precarious** **Belarusian economy** is thrown
into a **severe crisis**, [lead]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} **[mass]{.mark}
protests** and **[unrest]{.mark}** among the political and security
elites]{.underline}. There are [**splits** within the **Belarusian
regime** which facilitate a renewed public willingness to
protest]{.underline}. Mass protests break out. Reminiscent of Ukrainian
President Viktor Yanukovych's fate in 2014, [**[Lukashenka]{.mark}**
**[flees]{.mark}** to Dubai.]{.underline}

Unlike the Euromaidan Revolution in Ukraine, however, [a **deep** and
**prolonged period** of]{.underline} political and [**[economic
instability]{.mark}** [takes hold]{.mark} in Belarus. **[No one]{.mark}
succeeds** in effectively]{.underline} filling the power vacuum that
Lukashenka leaves behind, nor to [[get the economy going]{.mark}
again]{.underline}. A combination of **[[economic
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}** and corrupt interests [[leads
to]{.underline}]{.mark} a privatisation programme that ends up
distributing major state-owned assets to a select few officials and
businessmen with good political connections. There is an [**increase**
in **[organised crime]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and many officials and KGB
agents now become integral parts of these growing criminal networks. In
collusion with entrepreneurs, KGB officials, and/or other state
officials, [organised crime]{.underline} becomes involved in -- and at
times even [takes control of]{.underline} -- [**significant chunks** of
Belarus' production capacities and foreign trade]{.underline}, pocketing
substantial shares of the resulting profits. With [[Belarus]{.mark} on
the verge of [**becoming** a **failed state**]{.mark}]{.underline},
around one million Belarusians decide to emigrate to Russia and the EU.

Like in scenario 4 (Lukashenka Without Putin), Russia's inward turn in
this scenario is due to supposedly temporary limited capabilities and
not accompanied by a fundamental change in strategic outlook. As such,
Moscow is very worried about the instability in Belarus, but lacks the
capabilities to do something meaningful about it. In fact, Russian
troops stationed in Belarus increasingly participate in all kinds of
illicit economic activities in Belarus. Like Belarusian KGB agents, many
[[Russian soldiers in Belarus become "**violent
entrepreneurs**]{.mark}"]{.underline}﻿\[138\] who sell their services to
protect businesses and harass their competitors.

Policy implications

This scenario poses some significant challenges for Europe, while at the
same time placing severe constraints on what the EU can achieve in its
relations with Belarus. While the EU will be forced to deal with an
expansion of Belarusian illicit trade and organised crime, as well as
the influx of significant numbers of Belarusian refugees, it would have
to look for ways to stabilise the Belarusian political system and
economy with limited instruments being available. Any decision about the
pursuit of a normative or pragmatic strategy towards Belarus would have
to be postponed until after Belarus has been stabilised.

Belarusian organised crime, illicit trade, and the influx of up to a
million Belarusian refugees into the EU create significant challenges
for European policymakers in this scenario. The rise in organised crime
and illicit trade would call for strong border controls on the
EU-Belarusian border, while the influx of large numbers of refugees
would make it difficult to screen individuals effectively. Similar to
scenario 3 (Bye-bye Belarus), difficult decisions would have to be made
regarding the short- and long-term protection of Belarusian refugees in
Europe.

Extreme versions of this scenario, in which [Belarus becomes a
**fully-fledged failed state**]{.underline}, could even [include
**[non-state actors]{.mark}** -- or state actors acting on their own
accord]{.underline} -- [[get]{.mark}ting hold of conventional
[weapons]{.mark}, using them to **[create]{.mark}** **their own
[paramilitary]{.mark}** [**forces**]{.mark} and/or [selling]{.mark} them
[on]{.mark} the [black market]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [**greatest
potential threat would**, of course, be for **[Russian nuclear
weapons]{.mark} [in Belarus]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- if there are
indeed any, which remains unclear -- [to **[fall into the wrong
hands]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Thankfully, that seems like a very remote
possibility, given that Russia has a very strong interest in preventing
that from happening as well. It would really require a simultaneous,
deep and rapid collapse of the social order in both Russia and Belarus
for something like that to become possible.

#### Sanctions means Lavna's [ages]{.underline} away---ignore the [propaganda]{.underline}.

**Staalesen '25** \[Atle; January 14, 2025. Journalist. "US Sanctions

https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/us-sanctions-target-new-murmansk-seaport/423086;
mgm\]

According to developers, the [new seaport in the Kola Bay]{.underline}
was to be ready for full-scale operations by late 2024 and already in
2025 be able to handle up to 18 million tons of coal shipments.

However, [**even before** the official opening of the new **major
infrastructure object**]{.underline}, the [Americans]{.underline} might
[have **hampered the grand plans.**]{.underline}

The [Lavna port]{.underline} is one of the many companies that is
[included in the **major**]{.underline} new [**sanctions** package
announced]{.underline} by the US Treasury on 10 January.

[The inclusion in the list is likely to **significantly trouble** the
**development** of the **project**]{.underline}. Possibly,
[Lavna]{.underline} could [end up as a **stalled** **ghost**
**project**]{.underline} similar to the nearby Belokamenka LNG
Construction Center, where energy company Novatek now is turning off the
lights.

Regional authorities have over the past two decades actively lobbied the
project. In 2022, it got a boost after the Kremlin officially named it a
\"strategically important project for Russia.\"

In a government meeting, Putin instructed construction works to
commence. In the same meeting then Secretary of the Security Council,
Nikolai Patrushev, told Putin that the inclusion of Sweden and NATO is
turning the Baltic Sea into an inland sea for alliance and that shipment
of goods via Murmansk is now one of the main transport routes for
Russia.

Patrushev argued that the importance of Murmansk now will be just as it
was "in the years of the Great Patriotic War" (Second World War).

But despite the backing from the Kremlin and the major investments,
[developments at **Lavna** have **proceeded** slower than
planned.]{.underline}

According to regional newsmaker Arktichesky Obozrevatel, both the
seaport and the connecting railway were by late 2024 **[far from ready
for full-scale operations]{.underline}**. All of 2025, and possibly even
more, will be needed to finalise the construction project, the newsmaker
argues on Telegram.

After the introduction of Western sanctions against [potash
fertilizers]{.underline} from [Belarus]{.underline} due to the policy of
Alyaksandr Lukashenka, the [share]{.underline} of the country in its
trade **[has significantly decreased]{.underline}**. [Physical **sales
volumes** also fell]{.underline}, according to data from the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

[n the **global potash trade**,]{.underline} the [share]{.underline} of
Belarus from 2021 to 2024 [decreased from 9% to 6%.]{.underline} As for
the physical volumes of **[sales]{.underline}** by Belarus, they
[decreased]{.underline} from 5.1 million to 4 million tons, or **[by
21.6%.]{.underline}**

Experts note that potash prices remained fairly stable due to improved
supplies from Belarus and Laos. But the EU duties on Belarusian
fertilizers, which will come into force on July 1, will continue to
affect both supply risks and price risks in the future. It is assumed
that prices will rise.

Bear in mind that [not only the physical volumes of sales of potash
fertilizers fell, but **also the income from them**]{.underline}. On
November 4, 2024, Alyaksandr Lukashenka said that now [domestic potash
fertilizers are sold]{.underline} \"for a song, almost [at **cost**, and

Belarus produces around 20 per cent of the world's potash fertiliser.
The [**declining share** of **Belarusian potassium exports** has
therefore raised]{.underline} serious [concerns about **world** **food**
**security**]{.underline}. Secretary-General of the United Nations
António Guterres has thus called for the restrictions on Belarusian
potash to be lifted, citing the risk of a potential food crisis.

Today, [**statements like this are** **actively** used by Belarus and
Russia for their **lobbying** and **propaganda campaigns**]{.underline}.
However, [it now seems likely that the catastrophic predictions are
**not going to take** **hold**]{.underline}. The available data shows
that after a sharp spike in prices caused by the introduction of
sanctions and the war in Ukraine, **[the global market has stabilised
again]{.underline}**. The [sanctions facilitated the **restructuring**
of **major suppliers** of **potash** **fertilisers**]{.underline}. For
example, [the **missing share** of **Belarusian** **potassium** is
now]{.underline} partly [**offset** by **increased fertiliser**
**exports** from **Canada** and the development of **new African
deposits**.]{.underline} The cost of potash fertiliser is now very
slightly higher than in 2019, but there are [no **signs** of shortages
of this product on the world market.]{.underline}

Russia provoking the rise in fertilizers and grain prices accelerated
several potash mining projects which had previously been unprofitable.

[International giant BHP]{.underline} Group Limited plans to [accelerate
the construction of the **Jansen potash mine** in Canada]{.underline}.
According to BHP, [by 2026 it will **produce** **almost** as much
potassium as **Belarus**]{.underline} exported to Europe and the
Americas.

US [Mosaic, Canadian Nutrien, and Germany\'s K+S Group]{.underline} also
announced [plans to **ramp up production and** bring over **10 million
tons** to the market in the next **2-3 years**.]{.underline} That will
be enough to [**substitute** **completely** the **export** of
**fertilizers** from **Belarus** or **Russia**.]{.underline}

In 2023 the [Canadian Millennial Potash Corp]{.underline} acquired the
[potash project Banio]{.underline} in Gabon. It covers 1238 sq. km and
[contains 1**.7 billion tons** of potash natural salts]{.underline}. One
of the largest potash deposits in the world, its [proximity]{.underline}
to major markets in the Southern Hemisphere [gives it a **significant
cost advantage.**]{.underline}

All this explains why it is critical for the Belarusian authorities to
ease the sanctions on potash as soon as possible before prices fall and
many markets are completely lost.

[The **market** **has**]{.underline} currently
**[stabilized]{.underline}**, so any lifting of sanctions on Belarusian
fertilizers might have little effect.

In 2022, [Canada and other exporters increased potash production at
existing facilities and **improved** **supplies**]{.underline}. The
price of oil fell from \$120 per barrel in June 2022 to about \$80 in

[**Leading** the list of the **top potash countries** by production is
**Canada**,]{.underline} which produced 15 million metric tons in 2024.
The world's biggest potash producer got even bigger in 2024 as it saw
its potash production level climb by more than 11 percent compared to
2023. The prairie province of Saskatchewan is home to all of Canada\'s
potash production.

The US Geological Survey said [Canada\'s potash output growth was **one
of the largest**]{.underline}, second only to Belarus, among nations
producing the fertilizer mineral in 2024.

\"[Canada was the leading exporter of potash in the world]{.underline}
in 2024, as **[it increased sales to meet growth in world
consumption]{.underline}**,\" the USGS wrote. In fact, 79 percent of US
potash imports for the year originated in Canada. This has created
concern for the US food industry in 2025 as US President Donald Trump
threatens to enact 25 percent tariffs on most Canadian imports,
including potash.

There are several major players in [Canada\'s]{.underline} potash mining
industry. Nutrien (TSX:NTR,NYSE:NTR), the [world's largest **potash
company**]{.underline}. It was born from a 2018 merger between two major
crop nutrient companies, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan and Agrium.
The deal created "a **[global agricultural giant]{.underline}**" now
valued at more than C\$35 billion. Today, the company has [six operating
potash facilities]{.underline} in Saskatchewan.

[The world\'s largest potash]{.underline} mine, the Mosaic Company\'s
(NYSE:MOS) Esterhazy K3 operation[, is capable of producing nearly **8
million MT** of the fertilizer mineral each yea]{.underline}r. Esterhazy
K3 has a mine life that extends out to 2054, according to Mining Data
Online (MDO).

Additionally, BHP\'s (NYSE:BHP,ASX:BHP,LSE:BHP) [Jansen]{.underline}
potash project is [expected to begin production]{.underline} from Stage
1 in 2026, and Stage 2, which has also begun construction, is

Since 2017, [researchers]{.underline} have empirically [connected
[12]{.mark} specific [drivers of hunger]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., crop
yields, food prices) to eight distinct types of instability and conflict
ranging from protests and riots to civil war (see Figure 3). The
[drivers of [food]{.mark}-related [instability]{.mark} can be
[grouped]{.mark}]{.underline} into three main categories: the
**[[climate crisis, resource]{.mark} conflict]{.underline}** [and
economic shocks]{.mark}. Over the past five years, half of all
peer-reviewed studies in this review have examined food-related
instability through the lens of the climate crisis. [[Food
insecurity]{.mark} **alone [rarely produces
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, [people must also be motivated
to choose conflict over peace]{.underline}. Those [motivations can
be]{.underline} grouped into three distinct categories: [desperation,
grievance or governance]{.underline}. [[Hunger]{.mark} is [not
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [necessary]{.underline}
[[precondition]{.underline}]{.mark} [for food-related
instability]{.underline}. Instead, conflict is often the product of
perceived threats to food availability, access and/ or utilization.
Therefore, [people participating in violent conflict]{.underline} are
**[not always experiencing hunger]{.underline}**. The **[inverse is also
true]{.underline}**: [People experiencing hunger are **not always
violent**]{.underline}. Food-related [[instability]{.mark} can
be]{.underline} **[[driven by]{.underline}]{.mark}** [both
food]{.underline} **[[scarcity and abundance]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[sometimes simultaneously]{.underline}. Food price riots and protests
are most common in urban areas. More [[extreme forms]{.mark} of
food-related instability]{.underline}, like [terrorism and civil
war,]{.underline} often [begin in rural areas]{.underline}
[[far]{.underline}]{.mark}ther [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} [the reach

It is perhaps surprising, then, that [[there is **little**]{.mark}

[a]{.mark}]{.underline} short-term [[reduction in access to food
**increases**]{.mark} the probability that **[conflict]{.mark} will

social [groups]{.underline}. In fact, the urban middle classes tend to
be the most likely to protest against rises in food prices, since they
often have the best opportunities, the most energy, and the best skills
to coordinate and participate in protests.

Accordingly, [[there is]{.mark} a widespread [misapprehension that
