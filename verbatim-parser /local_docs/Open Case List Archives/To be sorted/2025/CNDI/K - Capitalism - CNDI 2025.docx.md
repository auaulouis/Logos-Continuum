This K links to all the plans and has huge impacts that turn the aff.

While no team is going to read the K Aff (Ghostly Glaciers), there is a
section in this file that has special links and alternatives that you
could use to read the Cap K against critical affirmatives, so consider
developing that strategy for the regular season.

[[**Marxism** points to]{.mark} three articulations of
[abstraction]{.mark} relevant [to the contributions on Arctic late
industrialism]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Butler 2016). First, [in
capitalist society the abstract functions concretely]{.underline}. As
Paci (1969: 11, 18) puts it: "this concrete function, notwithstanding
the fact that it is really abstract, is bound to precise consequences:
the social relation not a thing. . . . [[The fundamental **character of
capitalism**]{.mark} . . . [reveals]{.mark} itself in the tendency to
make abstract categories live as if they were concrete]{.underline}"
(emphasis added). Second, Marx (1975) presents abstraction as driving
both processes of intellectual fragmentation and the alienation of
people from their labor and their lived, bodily experiences. **[[The
link between abstraction and alienation]{.mark} is
central]{.underline}** to the work of Moishe Postone's reconstruction of
Marx's social theory focusing on the central role played by the
domination of people by "abstract, quasi-independent structures of
social relations" (1993: 125). [Capitalist social relations secure
domination via abstraction and impersonality.]{.underline} In Marx's
(1973: 164) words, "Individuals . . . are now ruled by abstractions,
whereas earlier they depended on one another[. The
abstraction]{.underline}, or idea, however, [is nothing more than the
theoretical expression of those material relations]{.underline} which
are their lord and master. And third, in capitalism it is labor that is
both concrete and abstract, and that tension is replicated and
externalized in other forms" (including as Mason notes in other forms of
value, such as money) and in forms of social organization and knowledge.
Regardless of the primacy of one real abstraction (money) over another
(labor power), says Robert Gehl (2012), "the effects of any real
abstraction include material consequences . . . real abstractions
express themselves in social organization and are expressions of social
organization." The reality is human agency, the abstraction is the
immaterial constitution of a whole way of life. A central purpose of
Arctic Abstractive Industries is to explore these relations between
abstraction and forms of life and abstraction is a red thread running
across this book.

[[One domain]{.mark} in which real or concrete **abstractions** have
been deployed to great effect [is the **production of social space under
capitalism**]{.mark}---a space [for example]{.mark} like [the
**Arctic**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Henri Lefebvre (2005) in his
theorization of the multi-scalar and hyper complexity of space under
capitalism, drew upon Marx directly and the idea that abstraction
becomes real in practice (Stanek 2008; Butler 2016). Lefebvre (2009: 88)
noted that "there can be no pure abstraction"---no pure abstract
space---but rather the "concrete abstract." He offers an account of the
rise of forms of abstraction in thought, practice, and experience in
association with the different transformations of modes of production of
social space under global capitalism. Abstract forms can be understood
in part through the ways in which special processes--- fragmentation,
scale, nesting, networks---are part of the real abstraction of existing
forms of capitalism. [These sorts of [ideas]{.mark} have been usefully
employed in the extractive arena, for example, the concept [of
"hyper-extraction"]{.mark} or "**the planetary mine**" what has been
termed expanded, extended, or enhanced extraction]{.underline} (McNeish
and Shapiro 2021). These ideas draw upon three strands [[of political
economy.]{.mark} One is the move to deterritorialize and render
planetary the mine]{.underline}, and the idea that "capitalist
urbanization secrets the planetary mine---everyday, above ground,
scattered, diffuse, perpetual and swelling" (Labban 2014; also
Arias-Loyola 2020). Central to the planetary approach is not simply
scale, and interconnectivity (the city as the "inverted mine") and
breaking with methodological nationalism (the extractive nation or
state); rather **[[it is]{.mark} to see extraction as a set of [shifting
dynamic frontiers produced and enmeshed in forms of contemporary
racialized capitalism and empire.]{.mark}]{.underline}** A second is the
related work of Sandra Mezzadra and Brett Neilson (2020) in their book
The Politics of Operations.2 Their focus is on the production of
multiple edges and frontiers of expanding capitalism, the layered
sovereignties and variegated legal spaces of global capital,3 and the
new spatial and temporal complexities of capitalism associated with
capital's circulation and colonization of social life, what they call
the politics of operations. In particular it is the operations of a
trifecta of sectors and their connections that provide the core entry
point: extraction, logistics, and finance.4 Here we are necessarily
tacking back and forth between the concrete and the abstract, between
materials, flows, sensing, asset classes, money, the image world, and
multiple forms of expertise.

#### Capitalism causes [extinction]{.underline} and [devalues]{.underline} all life along the way.

TROY VETTESE A Marxist Theory of Extinction The Tragedy of Common
Environmentalism The same year the British parliament passes the 1773
Inclosure Act, the Tahitian sandpiper is extinguished as a species.
[[The Sixth Extinction]{.mark}, destroyer of worlds, [is the
annihilation of countless]{.mark} ancient and irreplaceable [branches of
the tree of life]{.mark}. [Coeval with the birth of capitalism, the
onset of the the Sixth Extinction began half a millennium ago,]{.mark}
and is now [proceeding at a]{.mark} [furious pace comparable to
the]{.mark} desolation of the [last great dieoff]{.mark} sixty-six
million years ago.]{.underline} From the perspective of earthly life,
[[capitalism differs little from colliding with a massive
meteorite]{.underline}]{.mark}. E.O. Wilson, an influential naturalist,
predicts that [[half of the world's flora and fauna will be extinguished
by the century's end]{.underline}.]{.mark} Recent studies have estimated
that mammalian species are disappearing one hundred to one thousand
times faster than the natural rate. The drivers of the Sixth Extinction
are myriad, but habitat-loss is its foremost cause, followed by
poaching, though climate change will certainly play an increasingly
important role. At least one mammal has already been extinguished by
climate change, the Bramble Cay melomys in 2016, when rising ocean
levels inundated this rat species' low-lying island home in the Great
Barrier Reef. 251 salvage Mammals, however, are only a tiny percentage
of the animal kingdom, which is overwhelmingly invertebrate. Small
creatures, like San Francisco's Xerces Blue butterfly (gone in 1941),
have borne the brunt of the cataclysm: [as many as [130,000 invertebrate
species have vanished]{.mark} since the early-modern period, some seven
per cent of all animal species]{.underline}. Yet apart from notable
efforts like Extinction by Ashley Dawson and Tragedy of the Commodity by
Brett Clark, Rebecca Clausen, and Stefano B. Longo, [[Marxists have
neglected]{.mark} the debate over [extinction]{.mark}]{.underline},
ceding the field to an unholy alliance of neoliberals and racist
Malthusians. [The dominant framework for thinking about
extinction]{.underline}, as well as many other environmental problems,
[has been the 'tragedy of the commons]{.underline}'. Garrett Hardin, a
biologist, coined this phrase in 1968, using it as the title of a short
essay he published in Science. It described an imaginary commonly-held
pasture, where unscrupulous herders grazed more cattle than the grass
could endure. 'Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush,' he
concluded, 'each pursuing his own best interest in a society that
believes in the freedom of the commons[. Freedom in a commons brings
ruin to all.' In this framework, what is rational for the individual --
cheating -- is irrational for the group, a contradiction that can only
be suspended through the implementation of property rights]{.underline}.
Hardin invoked other examples where overuse degrades a commonly-held
resource, such as free parking, campgrounds, pollution and fisheries. In
the latter instance, 'maritime nations ... bring species after species
of fish and whales closer to extinction' because of the 'freedom of the
seas'. 'The Tragedy of the Commons' remains a canonical text of centrist
environmentalism. Perhaps because the text is invoked more often than
read, or perhaps because of taboo, it is often left unsaid that Hardin's
allegory is extremely brutal, even fascist. Most people know that he
advocated privatisation to remedy the tragedy of the commons, and a few
more know he also suggested user-fees, but what is less-often discussed
is the third proposal of 'coercive' population control, coupled with the
dismantling of the welfare state. In his mind these issues were
conjoined because 252 Troy Vettese state assistance might support 'the
religion, the race, or the class \... that adopts overbreeding as a
policy.' Later, he rearticulated the 'overbreeding' of undesirables as
the 'passive genocide' of whites. Such sentiments were not mere
momentary lapses of judgement. As an ardent white supremacist, he
advocated population control for people of colour (but not for whites --
he himself had four children) and restrictions on immigration to the US
(especially from Latin America) to obviate the creation of a 'chaotic
Norte Americano Central'. He expounded these ideas until the end of his
life in fascist publications like Chronicles and The Social Contract.
Hardin may have been one of the ugliest protuberances on the body
politic of mainstream, white environmentalism, but he articulated the
logical end of a shared ideology. In 1968, the year he published
'Tragedy of the Commons', it was revealed that the US government had
sterilised thousands of Puerto Rican women over the preceding two
decades, affecting a third of the population. On the mainland five years
later, the involuntary sterilisation of two Black girls, Minnie and Mary
Alice Relf, brought to national attention that the federal government
annually underwrote the sterilisation of 100,000 to 150,000 poor people
as a condition for further welfare assistance. As many groups supported
coercive population control, they hesitated to criticise these outrages,
a stance that alienated Black and Latinx social movements for a
generation. Subsequent debates over immigration only worsened matters.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Zero Population Growth, the Sierra Club and
prominent businessmen co-founded the Federation of American Immigration
Reform (FAIR), a group designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as
a hate group. FAIR focused on fighting Mexican immigration: one of its
major early campaigns sought to prevent the counting of undocumented
migrants in the 1980 US census, to starve welfare programmes of funding.
Hardin sat on FAIR's board of directors. The tragedy of the commons, for
Hardin, was naturally transnational in scope. In 1974 he wrote 'Living
on a Lifeboat', where he compared nations to lifeboats and refugees to
people who 253 salvage 'fall out of their lifeboats and swim for a while
in the water outside, hoping to be admitted to a rich lifeboat, or in
some other way to benefit from the "goodies" on board'. In 1987 he told
a journalist from the New York Times that he opposed aid to Ethiopia
during its recent famine because the country 'has far too many people
for its resources.' Despite the prevalence of this kind of rhetoric,
environmentalists have never properly atoned for their xenophobia, nor
forsaken hateful prophets like Hardin. Herman Daly, a founder of
ecological economics and contributor to essay collections with Hardin,
recently told an admiring Benjamin Kunkel in the New Left Review that he
still desired coercive population-control, and that 'I don't believe in
open borders.' Now, when an increasingly unstable global climatic system
drives refugees from their homelands, Hardin's genocidal Weltanschauung
must be expunged from the Left's environmental discourse. No doubt
Hardin was odious, but what's worse is that he wasn't very clever --
he's no Carl Schmitt of US environmentalism. The 'Tragedy of the
Commons' has gaps big enough to drive a herd of cows through. His
fascist fable isn't historical or ethnographic, nor it does accurately
describe how commons function or how they break down, flaws that Elinor
Ostrom pointed out decades ago. That such an exercise in common sense
earned her the Bank of Sweden prize demonstrates how entrenched Hardin's
model is in economics, but Ostrom was hardly Hardin's only critic.
Neoliberals, a clever bunch, recognised early on that the tragedy of the
commons was an insufficiently rigorous framework, but were content to
have it remain as fig-leaf covering their more nuanced work in
environmental economics that still attracts too little scholarly
attention. Nowadays, the only sincere fans of Hardin are naïve centrist
environmentalists and neo-Nazis. From a neoliberal perspective, a
species should only be preserved -- even if it is privately owned -- if
it is profitable, only if the market decrees it. Although conservative
economists pen paeans to the market's sagacity in husbanding scarce
nature, neoliberal economists are much blunter. **[[From the point of
view of capital, organisms have no]{.mark} intrinsic
[value]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- even the last few individuals 254 Troy
Vettese of a species -- but are merely different capital assets in a
varied and constantly changing portfolio. This characterization of
nature as capital comes from Canadian fisheries economist, Anthony
Scott, whose insight has been picked up by other neoliberals like
Friedrich Hayek and Dieter Helm (Oxford don and chair of the Natural
Capital Committee). This logic is laid out clearly in Hayek's
Constitution of Liberty, where he argued '[from a social as well as from
an individual point of view, [any natural resource represents just one
item]{.mark} of our total endowment of exhaustible resources, and [our
problem is not to preserve this stock]{.mark} in any particular form,
[but always to maintain it in a form that will make the most desirable
contribution to total income.]{.mark}']{.underline} Yet, it was another
Canadian fisheries economist, Colin Clark, who laid out the logical
terminus such arguments in the starkest fashion in the 1973 article
'[Profit Maximization and the Extinction of Animal
Species]{.underline}'. 'Roughly stated,' he wrote, '[the following are
shown to be both necessary and sufficient conditions for extinction
under present-value maximization: (a) the discount (or time preference)
rate sufficiently exceeds the maximum reproductive potential of the
population, and (b) an immediate profit can be made from harvesting the
last remaining animals]{.underline}.' For Clark these two factors
mattered much more than whether a creature were privately or commonly
owned; [privatisation was no salve for extinction]{.underline}. Although
neoliberals have hardly hidden how they view nature, as just another
asset, [it has taken the Left far too long to realise that this is where
the centre of debate lies. [Capital's control over flora and fauna is
not as a special branch of the economy requiring its own theory, but
just as industrial as the manufacture of steel]{.mark} and
microchips.]{.underline} This insight is elaborated by Kenneth Fish in
his Living Factories -- perhaps the best book in Marxist animal studies.
Fish characterises genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as 'factories
-- living factories. [Microbes, plants and animals, indeed **[life
itself]{.mark}**, was, through techniques of genetic engineering[,
**being harnessed** as a fore of industrial
production]{.mark}.']{.underline} GMOs, however, were only an extreme
case of what capital seeks to do to all life. That is, capital erases
distinctions separating 255 salvage organism from machine. 'For all the
technological mastery marked by the coming of the machine, then,'
observes Fish, 'the significance of the factory for Marx lies in how it
approximates a living organism, that most natural of beings.' Marx's
comments on the factory being an 'organism', that it is 'dead labour'
that comes 'alive' when attached to a 'force of nature', is less a
metaphor than a near-literal description of machines as capitalist
beasts of burden. Subsume and Extinguish Trochetiopsis melanoxylon, a
'dwarf ebony' plant endogenous to Saint Helena, becomes extinct in 1771.
That year Richard Arkwright opens the first water-powered textile
factory in Cromford[. Once Marxists see that [capital seeks to transform
flora and fauna into machines]{.mark}, then it becomes easier to see
what capital's relationship to nature is, and how [the Sixth Extinction
is]{.mark} an [inherently capitalist]{.mark} problem]{.underline}.
Perhaps the most useful Marxist tools are 'formal' and 'real
subsumption', both described in the 1864--6 Economic Manuscripts[.
Formal subsumption occurs when 'production processes with a different
social determination are thereby converted into the production process
of capital'.]{.underline} If in the pre-capitalist era an individual
owned the means of production (for example., a yeoman farmer) or was
bound to a superior through dense social ties (for example, a guild
apprentice or serf), [[capitalism replaces]{.mark} these [relationships
with ones mediated through money]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, the work
process changes little if labour is only formally subsumed. 'Despite all
this,' Marx remarked, 'the change indicated does not mean that an
essential change takes place from the outset in the real way in which
the labour process is carried on ... capital thus subsumes under itself
a given, existing labour process, such as handicraft labour, the mode of
agriculture corresponding to small-scale independent peasant farming.'
Its basic form is cottage industry: the weaver works when she wants and
at the pace she wants, often at home, meeting the capitalist
infrequently for wages or supplies. This does not imply that that formal
subsumption 256 Troy Vettese is innocuous. As it is difficult to
increase productivity without machinery, greater surplus value can only
be increased absolutely by prolonging the working day. Real subsumption
begins when the capitalist introduces machinery, transforming production
through the 'conscious application of the natural sciences, mechanics,
chemistry, etc.' Instead of the worker using a tool with her hand as
during formal subsumption, the worker now uses a machine powered by a
'force of nature' (Naturkraft), like hydropower or coal. These changes
allow the concentration of labour and increase productivity,
facilitating the deskilling and devaluing of workers, but, perhaps more
significantly, it forces workers to toil at the machine's pace and thus
the pace set by the capitalist herself. Marx's conception of subsumption
is dynamic: formal subsumption often comes first, but once machine-made
commodities begin to compete with hand-made, then handicraft workers
will likely be destroyed as a class. 'History discloses no tragedy more
horrible than the gradual extinction of the English hand-loom weavers.'
Most Marxists tend to hover here, out of concern for the hand-loom
weavers and their unfortunate successors. Yet, just by slightly shifting
one's perspective, it becomes possible to see what happens when capital
extends its reach into the kingdoms of flora and fauna. One can begin in
the pre-capitalist stage of nature-human relations, say, between
fur-bearing animals and indigenous peoples in North America. While
people hunted deer, otter, muskrat, and most lucratively, beaver, it was
illogical to hunt all such animals. This is because the hunters' needs
were easily sated, it would take considerable effort to find the last
surviving muskrat, otter or deer, and there would be no more for the
future. [[Extinctions were]{.mark} thus rare in [pre-capitalist]{.mark}
societies]{.underline} (though mega-fauna extinctions thousands of years
ago may be exceptions). [Yet [indigenous peoples' relationship
with]{.mark} fur-bearing [animals changed once they became part of the
world-market]{.mark} during the seventeenth century,]{.underline} a
historic shift detailed by Richard White in his classic study, The Roots
of Dependency. Insatiable demand from European milliners 257 salvage for
furs spurred early corporations like the Hudson's Bay Company (founded
in 1670, eight years after the last dodo was killed) to fan out across
the North American continent. Corporations and merchants contracted out
hunting to indigenous peoples, transforming beaver fur into a commodity
that could be exchanged for kettles, beads, guns, horses, and knives. At
this stage, however, indigenous trappers were only formally subsumed by
capital, working when and where they wanted. Surplus value could only be
increased absolutely, so capitalists tried to find more trappers and
encouraged trappers to kill more beavers. Though they hunted more, the
needs of many indigenous peoples were modest. Not for the first time,
capitalists resorted to trading addictive commodities, alcohol in this
instance, to expand the market. Eventually, too many animals were killed
and crises ensued. Trappers could either travel inland or switch to
other species, but these solutions remained within the realm of formal
subsumption. Fur farms eventually would become a possibility, but this
marked a leap to real subsumption. Real subsumption occurs once capital
masters a plant's or animal's biological functions, allowing it to be
manipulated like any other machine. It is now possible to raise
productivity, allowing capital to squeeze more relative surplus value
from workers. Aquaculture illustrates the shift from formal to real
subsumption: as populations of many fish species have crashed since the
1990s, there has been a shift to raising fish as livestock. Farmed fish
are fed more frequently and richly than they would eat in the wild to
fatten them faster. Their size can be further increased through hormonal
treatment that can accelerate growth; hormonal treatment can even change
a fish's sex, which could be advantageous if there is pronounced
dimorphism in a species. Genetic intervention, via selective breeding or
genetic engineering, is also possible, like the trademarked AquAdvantage
salmon of AquaBounty Technologies. Within the factory setting of
aquaculture, labour becomes more efficient, say, through the automation
of feeding to replace handfeeding. The scale of production can be
expanded by concentrating fish far beyond what would be possible in the
wild, with all of the attendant problems this brings in terms of waste
and disease. The 258 Troy Vettese latter can be partially mitigated by
plentiful resort to antibiotics, while the former can be a burden
imposed on others. One can distinguish three intermediate forms between
formal and real subsumption, which could be termed 'ranching',
'kidnapping', and the 'factory in the jungle'. Ranching occurs when it
is cheaper for a capitalist to only partially subsume the lifeprocesses
of an organism. For example, the Texas longhorn cattle were prized
during the late nineteenth century because they could fend off predators
with their impressive ossein headgear and were hardy enough to survive
off prairie scrub. Their life cycle was almost feral until the animals
were rustled and driven to the railheads in Kansas. The longhorns'
hardiness was a 'free gift of nature' that lowered costs; it was useful
to capital until it became more profitable to subsume more aspects of
cattle, so they grew faster or bore more muscle. Eventually, such
artificial creatures reached proportions where they needed to be kept in
feedlots, rather than let out on the range. Fish hatcheries were similar
to the longhorn's pattern, as fingerlings are bred and then introduced
into rivers or lakes to replenish original, decimated populations. While
their births are unnatural, the fish look after themselves for most of
their lives, and capital requires labour only at the end to catch, kill,
and commodify. This was a half-way step to aquaculture. Kidnapping is
the mirror-image of ranching, because opposite moments of a creature's
life-cycle are subsumed: that is, adolescence rather than birth. An
illuminating case study in The Tragedy of the Commodity traces this
process in the tuna trade. As tuna cannot reproduce in captivity,
fishers try to capture and cage wild juvenile tuna so they can be
fattened for the market. Thus, it is a mix of formally-subsumed fishing
and really-subsumed aquaculture. Of course, this hybrid form only
hastens a species' decline, as it allows little opportunity for
reproduction. Due to a combination of overfishing and kidnapping the
Mediterranean tuna population steeply declined during the 1990s and
2000s. Globally, populations of various tuna species have dropped
seventy-four per cent since 1970. This figure obscures regional
variations and it is worst in the Pacific Ocean, where blue and
yellowfin populations have 259 salvage completely collapsed to only two
or three percent of their historic populations. In the third
intermediate variant, the jungle factory, the life-cycle of the hunted
organism remains wild, but hunting undergoes real subsumption. Formally
subsumed fishing endured for centuries in British waters because it was
generally not very effective, though the hunting of several cetacean
species in the North Atlantic was exceptionally lethal. As late as 1882,
the influential biologist Thomas Huxley could declare in his inaugural
address of the London Fisheries Exhibition that 'probably all the great
sea fisheries are inexhaustible'. Yet only eight years later, scientists
expressed concern for declining fish stocks due to the rapacity of
steam-powered trawlers, a technology then less than two decades old. In
the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, real subsumption of oceanic
hunting was taken to ludicrous extremes. Whalers and fishers pilot
powerful boats more like battleships than the modest schooners in the
age of sail. They are armed to the teeth with exploding harpoons,
satellites measuring surface temperatures, 'fish-aggregating devices',
sonar and spotter-planes. Slaughter and butchery can take place on the
ship itself and, thanks to massive freezers, these floating factories
can stay at sea for months. The brutal efficacy of industrialised
trawling, a hobby horse of the Economist, has forced even that
mouthpiece of bien pensant neoliberalism to concede that 'modern fishing
is really analogous to mining: fish are pulled from the sea faster than
they can be replenished'. Vegan Communism Karl Marx died 14 March 1883.
A hundred and fifty-one days later, the last quagga died in a Dutch zoo.
An analysis of formal and real subsumption, as well as their
intermediate forms, reveal specifically capitalist mechanisms of
extinction. [[Capitalists]{.mark} [may try to]{.mark} proceed from
formal to [real subsumption once a species' numbers become depleted,
but]{.mark}]{.underline} 260 Troy Vettese [[the life cycle of the
creature may be too delicate to bear capital's embrace]{.mark}, like
tuna. [Capital]{.mark} may [not even bother if there is a suitable
substitute]{.mark} available, such as the Texas Longhorn that replaced
the bison]{.underline}. If a creature is controlled via real
subsumption, then it is not threatened by extinction except if it is
dissolved through crossbreeding as aurochs were, in 1627. Once intensive
husbandry such as salmon aquaculture or feedlot cattle begains,
[[capital will]{.mark} attempt to [increase relative surplus value by
increasing productivity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Just as a
nineteenth-century factory worker's productivity increased by operating
steam-powered machines of greater horsepower that consumed ever more
coal, the real subsumption of nature allows the concentration of
Naturkraft. The massive, artificially sustained population of livestock,
numbering near fifty billion, rely on fossilfuelled crops to be kept
alive in such numbers. They are living factories, which is why
researchers from the Worldwatch Institute count livestock respiration as
greenhouse gas pollution -- as if it were expelled by machines --
noxious vapours that compose fiftyone per cent of total emissions. [Real
[subsumption has allowed the expansion of animal industry]{.mark}, and
it is [this process]{.mark} that [overwhelmingly propels the Sixth
Extinction]{.mark}. Animal industries require more than four billion
hectares, almost half of the Earth's inhabitable surface. Such a huge
amount of [land-theft has already caused countless extinctions, but more
will come]{.mark}]{.underline} if the meat industry doubles, as it is
projected to by 2050. It's not much better in the sea, because many
popular fish, especially tuna, are voracious carnivores, making it about
as strange and inefficient for humans to eat them as if we munched on a
tiger-salad sandwich. For every 1,000 tonnes of tuna biomass (about two
adult fish), a tuna feedlot operation requires fifty to sixty tonnes of
fishmeal per day. Such food is growing scarce as aquaculture and
tuna-kidnapping grows, forcing capital to plumb ever greater depths and
trawling the mesopelagic layer hundreds of metres deep, cutting new
swathes of extinction. In this way, it's possible to see the effects of
the intermediate forms. Ranching increases pressure on other creatures,
as the commodified animal takes massive amounts of space, while
kidnapping not only puts 261 salvage pressure on both the subsumed
animal and the surrounding ecosystem, and the third form, the jungle
factory, accelerates the decay of any mode of production that only
formally subsumes nature. [**[All these forms of subsumption must be
reversed if there is to be any hope to halting the Sixth
Extinction]{.mark}**. This means giving back]{.underline} at least half
of [the Earth,]{.underline} including half the sea, [to
nature]{.underline}. Right now, only a sixth of the world's landmass has
any protection, and only a twenty-fifth of the sea. [Marxists should
fervently oppose capital's ruthless domination of nature, of turning all
the world into a factory, mall, or garbage dump]{.underline}. Through
subsumption capital estranges both humans and other creatures from their
species-being -- from how they should naturally live. The Left must
reject the neoliberal Weltanschauung that nature is just another form of
capital: rather, the Left must endeavour to support nature's
self-actualisation too. What this might look like it is too early to
say, given the dearth of Marxist work on the topic; but at the very
least more space must be made for wild flora and fauna, and this means
livestock must be reined in. While the analysis sketched out here
applies to plants as much as it does to animals, given the wastefulness
of converting grain to animal flesh and milk, avoiding animal products
at least minimises one's complicity with the subsumption of nature.
Becoming vegan is the simplest and most effective action an individual
can take to reduce one's environmental impact, though of course, no
Marxist would be content with mere 'lifestyle' politics. Whatever form
the future's communist society will take, its emergence must be
complemented by the abolition of animal industries, to be replaced by
community-run organic vegan agriculture, so that humanity treads lightly
in the global biosphere. [Socialist mastery over nature, as [the]{.mark}
technophile [Left]{.mark} advocates, [would not halt the Sixth
Extinction.]{.mark} Instead, [humanity's relationship to nature should
be guided by humility, empathy, and restraint]{.mark}. It is the Left's
concern whenever any creature is subsumed within capital's maw to be
enthralled or extinguished, dooming half of creation to
oblivion.]{.underline} 262

**[[Historical materialism and social change]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In very abstract terms, [historical materialism]{.underline} is [[a way
to understand]{.mark} historical and contemporary [social
formations]{.mark}.]{.underline} It seeks [to **explicate what is**
historically **specific about a dominant mode of
production**]{.underline} [within a particular social
formation]{.underline} (Ollman, 1993). A mode of production can be
briefly defined as [the "complex unity]{.underline}" (Althusser, 2014)
[between the productive forces (i.e. means of production and
labor-power) and relations of production]{.underline}, which Bettelheim
(1975: 55) defines as a "system of positions assigned to agents of
production in relation to the principal means of production."
Non-economistic Marxists like Lenin, Mao, and so on, emphasize that the
relations of production play the determining role in shaping the mode of
production (Althusser, 2014). [On top of the mode of production arises a
political and cultural superstructure that works in dialectical
relation/tension with the economic base (mode of
production).]{.underline} Social change occurs do this dialectical
relation with the economic base (Marx, 1979).

[In terms of prospects for social change, Marx is strict about the need
for the productive forces to be developed to create the conditions (i.e.
the material prerequisites) for a post-capitalist world]{.underline}. In
The German Ideology, Marx and Engels (1970: 56, emphasis in original)
state: "[this development of productive forces...is an absolutely
necessary practical premise because without it want is merely made
general]{.underline}, and with destitution the struggle for necessities
and all the old filthy business would necessarily be reproduced."
Without this development, society would be stuck in a condition of
"universal mediocrity" (Marx, 1970: 928). In Capital, this occurs
through the historical process of feudalism → primitive accumulation
(first negation) → capitalism → dictatorship of the proletariat
(negation of the negation) → socialism → communism (classless,
oppressive-less, stateless society) (see Marx, 1990: 92).

However, does every social formation have to undergo the "terrible
frightful vicissitudes" and "harsh tribute" of capitalist development
(Anderson, 2010; Marx, 1881; Shanin, 1983)? In a very interesting and
enlightening correspondence between Marx and Vera Zasulich (a Russian
Menshevik), [Marx]{.underline} clearly says that he [restricted the
"historical inevitability" of the process of primitive accumulation and
the development of capitalist relations of production to the countries
of western Europe]{.underline}. In this correspondence, Marx makes the
argument that the rural commune in Russia, that still existed on a
national scale in the late 1800s, could bypass the horrors of the
historical phase of capitalism by appropriating the positives of the
capitalist mode of production and go directly into "collective
production on a national scale" (Marx, 1881). However, in order for the
Russian rural commune to appropriate the positives of the capitalist
mode of production (i.e. machines and technologies that make life
easier), this would first require the abolishment of capitalist property
relations in the countries where the productive forces are developed.
Capitalist/imperialist countries tend to not just give away technologies
to countries that have antagonistic social systems to the capitalist
mode of production. Therefore, the early Bolsheviks emphasized, over and
over, the utmost need for workers' revolution to occur in Germany as
fundamental for the survival of the new worker's state. Does this not
show the fundamental importance of overthrowing capitalism in the global
north? Not only do the material conditions already exist to have
socialism, but also, a worker's revolution in the global north could
help develop the productive forces of countries in the global south on a
revolutionary socialist basis! Cohen (2000: 389--395) suggests that the
fall of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1991 is bad for
socialist politics but good for the method of historical-materialism.
Cohen suggests that the technological determinist and teleological
version of historical materialism that he advocates for was in fact
strengthened by the fall of the former USSR, because the USSR had a
workers/socialist revolution where the productive forces were not
developed to enough degree to sustain a socialist abundant society.
Thus, his particular historical materialist framework can be applied
today, where most of the world is deploying capitalist methods to
develop the productive forces.

However, as we see with Marx's correspondence with Zasulich, Cohen's
claim is simply Eurocentrism at its core. The traditional teleological
historical-materialist model does not fit neatly with every society,
especially ones outside the confines of western Europe. [[What
is]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[**universal** about historical
materialism is the need for developed productive forces for
socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}, and there is more than one way to do
this and get to socialism. [The method of historical-materialism is
universal, but not its traditional European-centered historical
model.]{.underline}

In the famous "Preface" to A Contribution to the Critique of Political
Economy, or what Althusser (2014) calls Stalin's Bible, Marx (1970: 21)
says a similar thing, just in a broad fashion:

[No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for
which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations
of production never replace older ones before the material conditions
for their existence have matured within the framework of the old
society]{.underline}. Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such
tasks as it is able to solve, since closer examination will always show
that the problem itself arises only when the material conditions for its
solution are already present or at least in the course of formation.

[In the 21st century, we seem to have the means to solve the problem,
but still cannot do it. Why is this?]{.underline} Because the productive
forces are not the determinant factor! In fact, the "productive forces
are nothing at all if they are not rendered operational, and they can
only operation in and under the aegis of their relations of production"
(Althusser, 2014: 21). Thus, [instead of the economistic notion that the
productive forces determine the superstructure, "the relations of
production are determinant, on the basis of the existing productive
forces and within the material limits they set]{.underline}" (Althusser,
2014: 21, emphasis in original). The capitalist relations of production
and their reproduction maintain the capitalist mode of production even
when the productive forces are developed to such a degree that they have
come in conflict with the relations of production. Of course, we have
seen the relations of production change in response to shifts within the
productive forces. [When the shift from Fordist to the neoliberal regime
of accumulation]{.underline} [occurred, the relations and social
relations of production changed in response, but they remained
capitalist relations of production because the changes in the productive
forces were led and guided by capitalist relations]{.underline}. Modes
of production can have wholesale change (e.g. capitalism → socialism) or
changes within the prevalent mode of production itself (e.g.
Fordism/standardized production regimes → Neoliberalism/flexible
production regimes). It is obvious then that [the [relations]{.mark} of
production [must be revolutionized]{.mark}; working people must seize
and take control of the means of production]{.underline}. Whether there
is simply a change in the prevalent mode of production or a wholesale
change in [the mode production is determined by the degree of class
struggle]{.underline} (i.e. the subjective component).

**[[Revolutionary optimism and hope]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[The productive forces necessary for socialism exist]{.mark} in the US
and throughout the global north]{.underline}. [The conditions to
eradicate poverty, homelessness, create non-ablest spaces, and so on
exist.]{.underline} [[It]{.mark} just [takes]{.mark} the [political
wil]{.mark}l to make this material reality free from its capitalist
confines]{.underline}. [For working-class activists living in the global
north, this needs to be emphasized ad nauseum.]{.underline} As Marx
says, the bourgeoisie create their own "gravediggers": "the advance of
industry ... replaces the isolation of the workers...with their
revolutionary combination, due to association (Marx, 1970: 930 FN).
However, and most unfortunately, the simple centralization of workers in
one place (like a city or a factory) does not automatically produce
revolutionary consciousness amongst the workers themselves. Capitalism
and all of its vulgarities still persist; [[something is blocking the
transition]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many point to things such as
[[ideology]{.mark}, bourgeois cultural hegemony, "[false
consciousness]{.mark}," "desire," and ["mystification"]{.mark} as
reasons for the nonexistence of a working-class revolution in the
US.]{.underline} The argument goes: the reason feudalism could be
transcended was because in feudalism the division between the time when
serfs/peasants were working for their own subsistence and directly for
the lords was clear as noonday. Feudal exploitation was achieved through
"extra-economic" means as Wood (2017) says. In capitalism, "surplus
labour and necessary labour are mingled together" (Marx, 1970: 346).
["Mystification" is built into the wage-relation itself]{.underline}
(see Burawoy, 2012). There is some deal of truth that [workers in
capitalism can fall for imperialist-capitalist ideology,
but]{.underline} I argue that [there are actual real material and
structural reasons for the nonexistence of working-class revolutions in
the US and global north more broadly]{.underline}.

If one actually talks to [working people]{.underline}, a lot of them
know that things in their world are messed up and don't necessarily buy
into capitalist ideology. Though many do not have revolutionary
consciousness yet, they are not simply tricked by imperialist-capitalist
ideology. "[The everyday" for US workers is in the workplace. Many work
multiple jobs just to scrape by. Working people just want to come home
from work and enjoy the little free time they have]{.underline}, or they
are simply working so much that it is almost impossible to have
revolutionary consciousness, or if they do [they cannot act upon it
because they are just trying to survive]{.underline}, and thus doubt
better days are ahead. [But, [these conditions can be
overcome]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Truly revolutionary working-class ideas do not arise spontaneously
within the working class itself. [[Marxism]{.mark}]{.underline} has to
be learned by the working masses, and it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
indeed [a [science that]{.mark} working and oppressed **[people can
learn]{.mark}**; it just has to be introduced.]{.underline} It must be
introduced [by a revolutionary vanguard party composed of the most
advanced and class-conscious working people]{.underline}. [Vanguard
parties provide]{.underline} the [material and infrastructural
foundation for working-class people to join the ranks of the
revolutionaries]{.underline} (see Dean, 2016). Workers must be able to
understand and explain the class character of all political
phenomenon---Marxism provides this. In "What Is to Be Done?" Lenin says
that a class-conscious worker cannot be left to work 11 hours a day in a
factory if we want the worker to develop clear revolutionary class
consciousness. Thus, as he says, [the party must make the arrangements
necessary to ensure that the worker can have]{.underline} more [free
time for organizing and developing revolutionary class consciousness.
The vanguard party form makes joining the revolution truly accessible to
the vast masses of people]{.underline}. To paraphrase Lenin (1987
\[1929\]), the working class left to organize themselves will fall into
trade unionism, which is ingrained in bourgeois ideology and thus cannot
transcend the capitalist mode of production. [[A]{.mark} Marxist (i.e.
**[historical materialist]{.mark}) [understanding]{.mark}** [of society
can]{.mark} indeed be understood by the masses of people, which will in
turn [unleash the power of class **consciousness** itself as a real
material power.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The way Marx explains how [the capitalist mode of production develops
through time empowers workers [and provides revolutionary
optimism/hope]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As the productive forces develop,
more and more proletarians are produced and less and less capitalists
exist]{.underline} ([due to competition and monopolization,]{.underline}
etc.). Out of market competition, "\[o\]ne capitalist always strikes
down many others" (Marx, 1970: 929). The means of labor are transformed
into forms "that can only be used in common." Thus, as the capitalist
mode of production develops,

The monopoly of capital becomes a fetter upon the mode of production ...
The centralization of the means of production and the socialization of
labour reach a point at which they become incompatible with their
capitalist integument. This integument is burst asunder. The knell of
capitalist private property sounds. The expropriators are expropriated.
(Marx, 1970: 929)

[The "immanent laws of capitalist production]{.underline}" itself [leads
to]{.underline} [not only class struggle but also to communist
revolution]{.underline}. The laws of competition within the capitalist
mode of production have the tendency to constantly revolutionize/develop
the productive forces even in the era of monopoly capitalism. The
developed [productive forces]{.underline} that are [created in
capitalism create the foundations from which socialist society can
arise]{.underline} (see Phillips and Rozworski, 2019).

In Capital, Marx says [it will be easier to move beyond capitalism than
it was to move beyond feudalism]{.underline}, for the simple fact that
[during the transition from feudalism to capitalism "it was a matter of
the expropriation of the mass of the people by a few
usurpers]{.underline}." But [in the case of transitioning out of
capitalism, "we have the expropriation of a few usurpers by the mass of
the people]{.underline}\[!\]" (Marx, 1970: 929--930). Thus, [to end
capitalist private ownership of the means of production, we only have to
usurp a handful of capitalists]{.underline}, which [numerically
speaking]{.underline} should be [easier to do than usurping millions of
people as what occurred within the process of primitive
accumulation]{.underline} that created the social conditions necessary
for the capitalist mode of production.

[The [inert power]{.mark} working people have [exists at all
times]{.mark}]{.underline} ([even in eras of global working-class defeat
and retreat)]{.underline}; [workers can]{.underline} simply [shut
production by striking]{.underline}, [occupying the
workplace]{.underline}, and so on (see Allen and Mitchell, 2003;
Glassman, 2003). A nice made-up scenario I like to give students is that
[no one would really notice if all the bosses/CEOs did not show up to
work for one day, but if all workers did not show up for one day, all of
society would simply shut down and reach a standstill]{.underline}.
Additionally, and most importantly, [the proletariat can use its class
power to overthrow and transcend the bourgeois order by seizing
political power]{.underline}---that is, [the state---and radically
transform it to serve the class interests of the working class. [This
**cannot be dismissed as utopian**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It has been
done in history and it will occur again]{.underline}. This
[revolutionary takeover allows for the working class to make "despotic
inroads on the rights of \[bourgeois\] property, and on the conditions
of bourgeois production"]{.underline} (Marx and Engels, 1978: 490; see
also Lenin, 1987 \[1932\]: 336).

## Framework

### Serial Policy Failure

#### Policy is not just a matter of [possibility]{.underline}, but of [purpose]{.underline}. Their framework makes debate [meaningless]{.underline} and guarantees [serial policy failure]{.underline}.

Herman **Daly &** Joshua **Farley 11**. \*Professor, School of Public
Policy of University of Maryland. \*\*Gund Fellow & Professor of
Community Development and Applied Economics, University of Vermont.
"Ends, Means and Policy." *Ecological Economics: Principles and
Applications*, Chapter 3.

If economics is the study of the allocation of scarce means in the serv-
ice of competing **ends**, we have to think rather deeply about the
nature of ends and means. Also, [[policy **presupposes**]{.mark}
**knowledge** of two kinds]{.underline}: [of [**possibility** and
**purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline} and of means and ends. Possibility
reflects how the world works. In addition to keeping us from wasting
time and money on impossibilities, this kind of knowledge gives us
information about tradeoffs between real alternatives. [[Purpose
reflects **desirability**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[our **ranking of
ends**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[our criteria for distinguishing better
from **worse states**]{.mark} **of the world**]{.underline}. [[It does
not **help**]{.mark} **much** [to know how the world works if we cannot
distinguish better from **worse**]{.mark} **states of the
world**]{.underline}. Nor is it useful to pursue a better state of the
world that happens to be impossible. [[Without both]{.mark} kinds of
knowledge]{.underline}, [[policy discussion is
**meaningless**]{.underline}]{.mark}.1

[To relate this to **economic policy**]{.underline}, [we **need** to
consider]{.underline} two questions. First, in the realm of possibility,
the question is: What are the means at our disposal? Of what does our
ultimate means consist? By "ultimate means" we mean a common denominator
of possibility or usefulness that we can only use up and not produce,
for which we are totally dependent on the natural environment. Second,
[[what **ultimately** is the **end** or]{.mark} **highest
[purpose]{.mark}** [in whose service we should **employ these
means**]{.mark}]{.underline}? These are very large questions, and we
cannot answer them completely, especially the latter. But [[it is
**essential** to raise the questions]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are
some things, however, that we say by way of partial answers, and it is
important to say them.

### Education First

#### Capitalism trains [students]{.underline} to believe that inequality is inevitable. Educational spaces should be used to [question]{.underline} social organization. 

Eli **Cook 20**. Assistant Professor of American history at Haifa
University in Occupied Palestine. "Naturalizing Inequality: The Problem
of Economic Fatalism in the Age of Piketty." Capitalism: A Journal of
History and Economics 1.2, 338-378.
https://doi.org/10.1353/cap.2020.0004

[The fact [that]{.mark} many leading American
**[intellectuals]{.mark}**, **experts**, [and **policymakers**]{.mark}
in the early twentieth century [came to believe]{.mark} that the
**[domination]{.mark}** of the economy [by]{.mark} a few [giant
corporations was **inevitable**, and]{.mark} that [there was
**no**]{.mark} other viable **[alternative]{.mark}**, likely [played an
**important role** in]{.mark} the **[corporate takeover]{.mark}** of the
American economy]{.underline} during that era, [[as]{.mark} these
[fatalist ideas **filtered**]{.mark} down [into the]{.mark} larger
**[public.]{.mark}**]{.underline} If analogous ideas of naturalized
inequality continue to spread and gain purchase through prestigious
outlets such as Science, [a similar development could occur
today]{.underline} in the realm of economic distribution. [[If most
Americans]{.mark} are eventually led to [believe]{.mark} that the
enormous [disparities]{.mark} of wealth in their society [are]{.mark}
the product of **[natural]{.mark}** and inexorable laws, [the
chances]{.mark} that [they]{.mark} will [demand]{.mark} social,
institutional, or political [**change** will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
[**[decline]{.mark}** dramatically.]{.underline}

To avoid such a fate, this article will end by articulating how
historical [[**scholarship** can help]{.mark} serve as a counterweight
by **[denaturalizing inequality.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Here, too,
Piketty can play an important role. As I will demonstrate, and as others
before me have argued, Capital in the Twenty-First Century is
essentially a book suffering from a split personality.9 Listening to the
book's "other Piketty" leads us down a very different intellectual path
with very different political and ideological ramifications. Unlike the
fatalist laws and equations which appear in certain parts of Capital in
the Twenty-First Century and in the Science issue that helped jumpstart
the return of naturalized inequality, the historically minded parts of
the very same book provide a useful analytical framework that the
Science issue overlooks. [This **[framework]{.mark}**]{.underline} not
only **[[politicizes]{.underline}]{.mark}** economic [theory by focusing
on **[institutional forces]{.mark}**, **historical contingency**, [and
**power relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but also denaturalizes
inequality by thoroughly undermining the basis of any economic "law" of
wealth or income distribution. In his newest book, Capital and Ideology,
Piketty continues to go down this denaturalizing path, leaving the
"other" Piketty behind.

Yet while these aspects of Piketty's work can move us forward,
historians of capitalism must pick up the
**[[denaturalizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** mantle. The discipline of
history [[is]{.mark} best fitted [to reveal]{.mark} to the wider public
the **contingent**, [**power-laden**, and
**anything-but-inevitable**]{.mark} nature of]{.underline} our enormous
[income and [wealth gaps]{.mark}, and]{.underline} to [show why
naturalizing arguments that claim the opposite are]{.underline}
misguided and [wrong.]{.underline} While of course many historians have
done much work in this field already, they have often made their
arguments in an indirect and implicit way. As such, this article will
end with some general suggestions about how we can push this agenda to
the explicit fore, thus [offering the]{.underline} broader [public
[a]{.mark} very different [story that does not naturalize inequality
but]{.mark} instead [politicizes it.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet before we
turn to any of this, let's start with a very brief history of the idea
of natural inequality in the West.

## Impacts

### Cap Unsustainable

#### Capitalism is [politically]{.underline} and [economically]{.underline} unsustainable\-\--[fascism]{.underline}, [populism]{.underline}, and [war]{.underline}. 

Nick **Beams 24**. International editorial board for WSWS. "Capitalist
breakdown, barbarism and the irrefutable case for international
socialism." 1/20/24.
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/01/20/yhop-j20.html

[Two reports]{.underline} issued for the Davos meeting of the World
Economic Forum this week [have both]{.underline}, in their own way,
[detailed the **catastrophic breakdown**]{.underline} [of the world
capitalist system]{.underline}, [its drive into]{.underline}
**[barbarism]{.underline}** and consequently the irrefutable case for
international socialism. That was not their intention, but this
necessity emerges from the facts, figures and analysis in the Global
Risks Report of the WEF and the report entitled Inequality.Inc prepared
for the meeting by the international aid agency Oxfam. The WEF report
stands in stark contrast to its earlier promotion of the claim that the
liquidation of the Soviet Union was the triumph of capitalism over
socialism which would usher in a new epoch of peace, prosperity and
democracy brought about by the unfettered operation of the free market.
As the New Year statement of the WSWS editorial board explained, this
was based on a fundamentally flawed analysis. It was grounded on the
false identification of Stalinism and its nationalist dogma of
"socialism in one country" developed by the bureaucracy against the
perspective of world socialist revolution which had formed the
foundation of the October 1917 revolution. [Rather than representing
the]{.underline} **[end of socialism]{.underline}**, [the liquidation of
the USSR signified that the **fundamental contradiction**]{.underline}
[of capitalism, that between the **integrated world
economy**]{.underline} [and the persistence of the outmoded nation-state
system]{.underline} which had given rise to the horrors of two world
wars in the 20th century, [was **reasserting**]{.underline} [itself in
an **even more**]{.underline} [explosive form.]{.underline} In a
confirmation of [this analysis]{.underline}, the authors of the WEF
report wrote that it was "[[set against]{.mark} a backdrop
o]{.underline}f **[rapidly [accelerating]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[tech]{.mark}nological [change and **economic
uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as the world is **plagued** by a
**duo** of dangerous crises: **climate** and **conflict**."]{.underline}
It warned that [[governance systems]{.underline}]{.mark} were being
"[**[stretched beyond]{.underline}** [their
**limit**]{.underline}]{.mark}," that "[[weakened systems
require]{.mark} only th]{.underline}e [**[smallest shock]{.underline}**
[to edge past]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[tipping
point]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[resilience]{.underline}**," and that "[[corrosive]{.mark}
**socioeconomic [vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[will be
**amplified** in the **near term**]{.underline}]{.mark} [with looming
concerns about an **economic downturn**]{.underline}" [[amid
resurgent]{.mark} risks "such as **[interstate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}." On [climate change]{.underline}
it warned that the [tipping point]{.underline}, at which
self-perpetuating processes become irreversible, [could be reached by
the **beginning**]{.underline} [of the **next decade**]{.underline} [and
"the **collective ability** of societies to **adapt** could]{.underline}
[be **overwhelmed**]{.underline} [considering the **sheer
scale**]{.underline} [of potential impacts]{.underline}." [[Artificial
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} (AI), which was the subject of much
discussion at the meeting, [[posed]{.mark} the [question of
whether]{.mark} an [arms race in]{.mark} "**experimental technologies**"
[would present]{.mark} "**[existential]{.mark} [threats]{.mark}** to
humanity."]{.underline} Nothing in the report even suggested that it
would not, and in fact it warned that the use of [[AI]{.mark} in
"**conflict decision making**]{.underline}" [[would]{.mark}
"significantly [**raise the risk** of
**accidental**]{.mark}]{.underline} [or intentional [escalation]{.mark}
over the next decade]{.underline}." The Oxfam report focused on two
explosive trends in the socioeconomic structure of world capitalism: the
staggering increase in the wealth in the hands of a billionaire
oligarchy and, even more significant, the concentration of monopoly
economic and political power in a handful of giant global corporations.
It noted that since 2020, at the start of the pandemic, from which they
directly benefited, the world's five richest men more than doubled their
fortunes, at the rate of \$14 million per hour, from \$405 billion to
\$869 billion, while almost 5 billion people, more than half the world's
population had been made poorer. It warned that if current trends
continued the world would have its first trillionaire within a decade,
but poverty would not be eliminated for another 229 years. Oxfam has
pointed to [the accelerating **growth of wealth**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[income inequality]{.underline}** for a number of
years. A significant addition to its latest analysis was the focus on
the [increase in **[corporate]{.mark}
[concentration]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [showing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[how **[whole industries]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in vital areas]{.mark}
such as **food production**]{.underline}, **[energy]{.underline}**,
**[agriculture]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}** [[were **becoming
concentrated**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in fewer and fewer
firms]{.underline}. There were many statistics which reflected this
process, with one of the most striking being that the largest 0.001
percent of firms earned roughly one-third of all corporate profits.
Pointing to the connection between economic and political power, it
noted that far from being accidental, this economic power had been
"handed to monopolies" by governments. Reformist organisations,
including Oxfam, have called for greater taxation to rein in corporate
wealth and facilitate greater social equality through the provision of
increased social services. But as its latest report acknowledged, since
1980 corporations and their wealthy owners had intensified inequality by
waging a "highly effective war on taxation," with the result that the
official corporate tax rate had been halved in the major capitalist
countries, and that with tax havens and "tax planning" many corporations
often paid virtually no tax at all. [[Corporations]{.mark} likewise
**[dominate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[climate change]{.mark}
policy]{.underline} as they "**[own]{.underline}**,
**[control]{.underline}**, **[shape]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[financially profit]{.underline}** [from processes that
**emit**]{.underline} greenhouse gases," [and seek to "**block
progress**]{.underline} [on a fast and just transition]{.underline},"
denying and spinning the truth on climate change. In the space available
here we have only touched on some of the key points in both reports. But
even this brief examination raises the vital question, one that concerns
the very fate of humanity: What is to be done? The answer advanced by
Oxfam is that governments and the state must be somehow compelled to act
in the interests of the population against corporate power to ensure the
development of social equality. But its own report details in very many
places that governments and the state, of which they are a part, are
themselves the instrument of corporate power, functioning as the
executive committee for the enforcement its demands. In its conclusion,
entitled "Towards an economy for all," the report declared: [Powerful
corporations are]{.underline} **[driving]{.underline}** [extreme
inequality]{.underline}, all too often overpowering governments and
undermining the choice and freedoms of people globally. [Governments
must **use their power**]{.underline} [to rein in the **runaway** power
of **corporations**.]{.underline} This call has been made by Oxfam at
the conclusion of their previous reports. But they never pose the
question of why it has never been implemented. The old saying there are
none that are so blind as those who do not want to see comes to mind.
[One of the **most significant**]{.underline} [political
developments]{.underline} in the recent period [has been the rapid shift

[If it felt to you like things started going **off the
rails**]{.underline} [around]{.underline} the year [2016]{.underline},
you're not alone. Symbolically, the double blow of Britain voting for
Brexit, then the United States voting for Donald Trump, seemed like the
"end" of something. (The postwar liberal consensus? The Anglo-American
order?) [For some]{.underline} -- myself included -- [it also felt like
the **stirrings**]{.underline} [of a more **explicitly dystopian
moment**]{.underline}. If you count yourself in this category, buckle
up: Jem Bendell, former professor in sustainability leadership at the
UK's University of Cumbria, and his research team are here with more bad
news. [According to Bendell's new book]{.underline} Breaking Together: A
Freedom-Loving Response to Collapse, "[[the quality of life in most
countries]{.mark} and regions of the world]{.underline} \[...\]
**[[peaked]{.mark} [around 2016]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
\[then\] [began to **slowly decline**]{.underline}". There is no sound
reason to expect a halt to this deterioration, Bendell argues. Rather,
[[declining]{.mark} Human [Development Index statistics are one of
**many signals societal** collapse]{.mark} due to climate change
[is]{.mark} not only **[possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [or even
**imminent**]{.underline} -- [but **already happening**]{.underline},
right now. [[But what if]{.mark} [collapse is an
**ongoing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[[slow]{.mark}(ish)]{.underline}** [[process]{.underline}]{.mark},
[rather than a **one-off mega-disaster?** [And what if]{.mark} the
[cracks]{.mark} [appearing]{.mark} in the "**cultural cement**" of
modern society represent **not only a crisis**]{.underline}, [but also
an [opportunity to]{.mark} **radically [rethink]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[how [humans interact]{.mark}]{.underline} -- with each other, and with
the natural world? Breaking Together encourages us to think about
collapse in ways that are profound, possibility-expanding and
startlingly original. Bendell's "post[-[doom]{.mark}" [perspective
has]{.mark} the **[potential to change]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[individual [lives, **upend organisational
strategies**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and give birth to whole **new social
movements**]{.underline}. Bendell advocates for an ideal of
"ecofreedom". This moves beyond obvious ideas, such as reconnecting with
nature, to encompass supporting youth climate activism and decolonial,
resource-preserving movements in the Global South. The post-doom
approach also calls for [embracing a "**positive disintegration**" of
**self** and **values**]{.underline}, [to **refocus**]{.underline} one's
mind, and entire **[existence]{.underline}**, on things that really
matter. Deep adaptation Bendell is best known for his 2018 paper Deep
Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy. He submitted it to the
Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal for peer
review; the reviewers requested major changes. Instead, Bendell
published the paper himself, via the University of Cumbria's Initiative
for Leadership and Sustainability. Deep Adaptation is a brick hurled
through the window of "corporate sustainability", questioning its very
viability as a field of scholarship. The first sentence of the abstract
reads: The purpose of this conceptual paper is to provide readers with
an opportunity to reassess their work and life in the face of an
inevitable near-term social collapse due to climate change. Needless to
say, this got people's attention. The breaking-the-frame gesture of a
supposedly sober academic paper containing bold, sometimes alarming
claims resonated widely. Particularly this one: when I say starvation,
destruction, migration, disease and war, I mean in your own life. With
the power down, soon you wouldn't have water coming out of your tap. You
will depend on your neighbours for food and some warmth. You will become
malnourished. You won't know whether to stay or go. You will fear being
violently killed before starving to death. Deep Adaptation went viral.
By 2019, it had been downloaded more than 600,000 times. The argument's
appeal is based, first, on Bendell's courage to draw meaningful,
personally relevant conclusions from all the terrifying climate and
ecological data that has been floating around unsynthesised for years.
This is combined with a sense one might have stumbled upon "the paper
they don't want you to read". A whiff of contraband, the tang of illicit
knowledge -- which has, of course, become ever more appealing in these
heady, post-truth days. Bendell's "Deep Adaptation" argument influenced
the founding members of Extinction Rebellion, who sought to develop an
environmental activism commensurate with the scale of threat humans
face. It also led to the formation of an international online Deep
Adaptation Forum, which has allowed tens of thousands of people to begin
processing their fear and grief about future societal and ecological
breakdown. Bendell's work has also sparked fierce criticism: that he has
got the science wrong. Or that, even if the science is okay, the
implications of Deep Adaptation are counter to a politics of climate
justice. (It's also worth noting that some critics of Deep Adaptation
commit the classic fallacy of "shooting the messenger", blaming Bendell
for systemic problems and/or emotional responses that are not of his
making.) 'It's already far worse' Now, five years after the birth of the
Deep Adaptation movement, Bendell is back with another nasty surprise:
[as the research]{.underline} \[for Breaking Together\] [progressed, I
discovered the data was indicating things]{.underline} **[were far
worse]{.underline}** [than I had **previously assessed**. Indeed, they
were already **far worse** in the years **before 2018**]{.underline}
than I had known. [I had been wrong to **conclude**]{.underline} [that
societal collapse]{.underline} **[is inevitable]{.underline}**, [because
it had **already begun** when I was reaching that
conclusion.]{.underline} Chapter by chapter, the first half of the
500-page book presents an interdisciplinary laundry list of ruin:
[[imminent]{.underline}]{.mark} or ongoing **[[economic
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[monetary
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[energy collapse]{.underline}**,
**[[biosphere collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[climate
collapse]{.underline}**, **[food collapse]{.underline}**, societal
collapse. Depending on your background, some of this material might be
(depressingly) familiar reading. For example, anyone who's across the
Stockholm Resilience Centre's analysis that [[humanity]{.mark} has
already **[breached six out of]{.mark} [nine]{.mark}** of the earth's
"**[planetary boundaries]{.mark}**",]{.underline} or who has read
Elizabeth Kolbert's The Sixth Extinction (2014), won't need convincing
that ecological collapse is well underway. Hedge-fund gossip On the
other hand, for readers who are unfamiliar with the finer points of
economics or finance -- such as myself -- there are some huge claims
it's hard to know what to do with. Apparently, [[the world's]{.mark}
current **[monetary systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} "[are not only
**[hastening]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[the
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline} of both natural and human systems, [but
are known to be **on the verge**]{.underline} [of collapse by some
senior officials]{.underline}". His proof? "[Many **[private
bankers]{.mark}** I have spoken to **[believe]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[that the **[current monetary systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[will
not]{.mark} [last]{.mark}]{.underline}," while "**[[none of
them]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[...\] [[considered the system]{.mark} to
be]{.underline} **[ethically legitimate]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[[sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}**". This leads to an eye-popping
suggestion: [the monetary system would not **likely
collapse**]{.underline} [in a random fashion but]{.underline} \[would\]
[be triggered when a coalition of **corporate**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[banking interests]{.underline}**, both public and
private, [determine that they are ready to **profit** from **that
transformation**.]{.underline} I'm willing to be convinced on this point
-- I have very little faith in the motives of investment bankers or bond
traders -- but I need more than the cocktail-party gossip of "for the
last 15 years, in social occasions, I have occasionally chatted with
people who work in hedge funds and asked about their views on their work
and the future of the financial system". A lot more. Systems under
stress But even while Bendell and co. can get a bit carried away with
their sub-arguments in Breaking Together, its overall thrust is clear
and compelling. [[Many]{.mark} of the [world's]{.mark}
**natural**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[human-made
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which combine to make up "industrial
consumer society", [[are under]{.underline} **[severe
stress]{.underline}**]{.mark}, or are already cracking. [[These]{.mark}
[systems are **interdependent**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**[complex]{.underline}**, **[precarious]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[nonlinear]{.underline}**]{.mark} -- [which means
[change can occur]{.mark} not just **gradually**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[predictably]{.underline}**, [but also
**[abruptly]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[drastically]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[A sudden breakdown in]{.mark}
one part of the **[overarching structure]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of
global capitalism]{.mark} **can**]{.underline} -- and does -- **[trigger
disruptions]{.underline}** [in other areas.]{.underline} For example,
[if extreme weather led to widespread]{.underline} **[crop
failures]{.underline}** across multiple wheat-growing regions -- a
possibility known as "a multi-breadbasket failure" -- [this would also
**trigger economic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[political
chaos.]{.underline}** This, in turn, would make it much more difficult
for the entire world to immediately transition away from fossil fuels
and towards renewable energy, to avoid calamitous climate change. And
[that's without getting into the question of whether we
have]{.underline} **[enough rare earth metals]{.underline}** to make
such a miraculous transition. (See Chapter 3, "Energy Collapse" for the
short answer -- we don't.)

### R/C -- War

#### Capitalism makes [imperialist wars]{.underline} for [conquest]{.underline} inevitable, shattering any [potential]{.underline} for peace.

Isabel **Ringrose 24**. Journalist, Socialist Organizer. \"Why
capitalism breeds imperialism and war.\" 2/15/2024.
https://solidarity.net.au/marxist-theory/why-capitalism-breeds-imperialism-and-war/

[[Ferocious **capitalist rivalry**]{.mark} has [caused
**appalling**]{.mark} **levels** of **armed
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} and suffering for people across the
world.

[[**Imperialism** is **inseparable** from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[competition]{.mark}** that also develops [between]{.mark} **rival
[capitalist states]{.mark}** [that struggle for domination]{.mark}
**economically** and]{.underline} often
**[[militarily]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin wrote his short book
Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism in 1916 to explain the
economic underpinning of the war and the features of a global system of
conflict between capitalist states.

He wrote, "Imperialism means the partitioning of the world" and "High
monopoly profits for a handful of very rich countries."

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} at the time [[thought]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[the]{.mark} **terrible [destruction]{.mark}** [war
unleashes]{.mark}, and the **chaos** it would cause [for]{.mark}
**capitalist [profits]{.mark}**[, meant the
**rich**]{.mark}]{.underline} and powerful [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasingly [[avoid war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Contrary to those who argued that bosses and states would cooperate with
each other and become a force for peace, Lenin said that [[any balance
of power between]{.mark} the contending [imperialists could only be
**temporary**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[When]{.mark} the **[economic weight]{.mark}** of one
state]{.underline} or group of states [[shifted]{.mark} **new bloody
[struggles]{.mark}** [burst out, destroying]{.mark} any
**[agreements]{.mark}** peacefully [to divide the]{.mark} **world
[market]{.mark}** made **previously**.]{.underline}

[The early stage]{.underline} of capitalism [sees relatively **small
firms** competing]{.underline} with each other mainly inside a domestic
market.

But the process of competition sees some crush their adversaries. [The
[victors]{.mark} emerge **bigger**, **more powerful** and ready to
**expand internationally**]{.underline}.

[As they move beyond]{.underline} the home market, [they [demand]{.mark}
their [state backs]{.mark}]{.underline} them to ensure **[smooth
[profit]{.mark}-making]{.underline}**. Sometimes [[they]{.mark} also
[want **armed force** to batter]{.mark} down
**[barriers]{.mark}**]{.underline} to trade or to clear out "unhelpful"
rulers.

The gunboat blasting away on some foreign shore became a key symbol of
the British Empire because of this method.

Imperialism is the fusing of economic and geopolitical competition. And
states' warmongering also reacted back on economic systems.

Shifting balance of power

Fifty years before the First World War Britain was the dominant
industrial power. But in the run up to the war, Germany was challenging
it as the second biggest economy.

Germany and other states challenged Britain militarily, and
economically.

At some points, such as at the Congress of Berlin at the end of the
nineteenth century, all the powers could agree to divide up Africa
between them---without involving any Africans, of course. But when
almost all such sharing of the spoils was exhausted, any new expansion
could happen only by taking away from some other state.

No state was content to "freeze" its areas of domination and control.
Instead their [**economic [accumulation]{.mark}** [led to **world
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**Conflict is [inevitable]{.underline} with continued
[commitment]{.underline} to [extraction]{.underline}**

**Harvey '16** \[Chelsea Harvey; Writer about climate change for
POLITICO\'s E&E News, specializing in the intersection of science and
policy, \"How exploiting the Earth can fuel violent conflict,\"
Washington Post, published 3-22-2016,

At the end of May, the U.N. Environment Assembly (UNEA) will convene for
the second time ever in Nairobi, Kenya, to discuss the United Nations'
sustainable development goals and the environmental challenges facing
today's world. And it looks like [one major theme]{.underline} to be
addressed --- one that's a growing concern among world leaders and
activists --- [is the [link between **violent conflict** and]{.mark} an
increasingly [**over-exploited** natural world]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Just last month, representatives to the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP)
met to hammer out the Assembly's agenda ahead of time, and [discussions
largely centered on the importance of a healthy environment to human
health and security]{.underline}. It's well-established that
[[environmental crises]{.mark} can [threaten]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[**food security**]{.mark}, increase **[water stress]{.mark}**, cause
upticks in **[disease]{.mark}**, undermine the [**economy** and]{.mark}
even **[displace]{.mark}** entire [populations]{.mark} of
people]{.underline}. But an issue that's starting to gain traction among
scientists and policymakers alike is the [connection between
environmental instability and war, civil unrest or other forms of human
conflict]{.underline}. "I think [we have]{.underline}, for a long time,
[overlooked often the **root causes** of conflict]{.underline}," said
Achim Steiner, UNEP's executive director. "When civil strife, civil
wars, internal conflicts happen, the attention is on, so to speak, the
immediacy of the battle zone." But, he said, studies are increasingly
suggesting that [[natural resources]{.mark} and the environment are
often a]{.underline} [**[central factor]{.mark}** in]{.underline} these
[conflicts]{.underline} --- and this can happen in three main ways.
First, [issues involving natural]{.underline} [resources can be the
direct cause]{.underline} of conflicts. Second, [they can help prolong
conflicts that already exist]{.underline}. And third, [they can help
revive conflicts that had paused or ended]{.underline}. Evidence of
these trends can be seen in conflicts that have occurred all over the
world. In fact, a 2009 UNEP report concluded that [natural resources
[play a role]{.mark} in at least **[40 percent]{.mark}** of all internal
conflicts]{.underline} in countries. Exploitation of natural resources
can help start or revive conflicts in a variety of ways. [[Competition
for]{.mark} land and [water resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, for
instance, [[can be a big **source of tension**]{.mark} between human
communities, and environmental degradation]{.underline} --- for example,
deforestation, pollution or the redirecting of water resources --- can
increase this competition. [Damaged]{.underline} or degraded
[environments]{.underline} also [[leave]{.mark} human [populations
**more vulnerable**]{.mark}]{.underline} to natural disasters, disease,
food shortages and other crises, [which can increase]{.underline} the
odds of [civil unrest]{.underline} or even force people to migrate to
other areas. "What is of concern to us is that [we]{.underline}
currently [underestimate the speed and the scale at which these
drivers]{.underline} [will become more significant]{.underline} as a
result of climate change," Steiner said. Increases in droughts, floods,
other extreme weather events and even famines and disease outbreaks
caused by the changing climate could lead to even more forced migrations
and a sharp increase in competition over resources. Already, some
populations around the world have been displaced by the impacts of
climate change --- a Native American community in Louisiana was just
last month declared the United States' first climate refugees after
losing its homeland to sea-level rise --- and many more are believed to
be heading in that direction. Natural [resource exploitation
can]{.underline} also [[play a **big role** in keeping existing
conflicts going]{.underline}]{.mark} --- and a great deal of this likely
has to do with the illegal extraction and trading of natural resources,
which can be instrumental in funding wars and uprisings. For instance, a
2015 report from Global Witness suggested that illegal timber trading
has helped to fund rebel groups in the Central African Republic. And
other reports from the United Nations have suggested that illegal mining
operations have also helped to finance armed groups in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, as well as the Taliban in Afghanistan. Indeed,
research from the World Bank has found that at least **[[17 civil
wars]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1990 [[have been
financed]{.underline}]{.mark} in some way [[by]{.mark} the
[exploitation]{.mark} of natural resources]{.underline}. While the
trading of goods like timbers, gemstones and other minerals may seem
like obvious ways to finance a conflict, Steiner pointed out that the
illegal wildlife trade is also emerging as a significant factor in
global conflicts. "Wildlife is today the fourth-largest illegal trade,
after the trafficking of drugs, people and arms," he said. "So it gives
you its sense of economic significance." And aside from being a source
of finance, issues with wildlife can also be a cause for conflict in the
first place. Around the world, there's increasing tension between
farming communities and wildlife preserves, for instance. "It can create
a great deal of tension between communities that have different
interests," Steiner pointed out. Naturally, all of these issues can work
in reverse as well, with human conflicts contributing to the degradation
of the environment. A 2009 paper published in Conservation Biology
concluded that more than 90 percent of all major armed conflicts between
1950 and 2000 took place in countries containing biodiversity hot spots,
and at least 80 percent took place within the actual hot-spot areas. The
paper highlighted the need to incorporate biodiversity conservation
goals into peacekeeping and humanitarian programs in conflict areas
around the world. Indeed, Steiner said, there's a great need for the
global community to begin better addressing the fundamental causes
behind human conflicts. [[If]{.mark} the [environmental drivers are not
considered]{.mark}, then [it's **unlikely**]{.mark} civil
[]{.mark}conflict **can be**]{.underline} completely
**[[resolved]{.underline}]{.mark}**. So a major goal of the UNEA meeting
in May will be "to actually draw the attention that sometimes the
[environment]{.underline} may in fact be a means to [achieving conflict
resolution]{.underline} and building peace," Steiner said. "[You ignore
it and you do so at your own **peril**, because it will **come back to
haunt you** because the **[root cause]{.mark}** of the conflict [has not
been]{.mark} [addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}." Addressing this issue
will be instrumental in tackling the United Nations' sustainable
development goals, many of which are aimed at ending poverty and hunger,
protecting human health, promoting safe communities and promoting the
sustainable use of natural resources. As the research has shown, a
healthy environment is inextricably tied up with just about all of these
issues. "The numbers are intriguing, the implications staggering, and I
think a lot more attention is needed to understand the linkages,"
Steiner said. "Because [they are]{.underline} part of [driving the
conflict scenarios of our time]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} years
into [the future]{.underline}."

#### Capitalism causes climate change and creates a series of detrimental consequences

Capitalism and Climate Change Although several inventions are oftentimes
credited as ushering in the transformations in economic activity
associated with the Industrial Revolution (e.g. the spinning jenny,
water looms, locomotives, and the steam engine), colonial expropriation
was fundamental to changing these activities, with the destruction of
land and its resources in the colonial peripheries serving as
fundamental to the accumulation of wealth in the colonial centres (Amin,
2014). This was especially so with the introduction of the cotton gin,
which relied on the unpaid slave labour, dispossession, and death of
indigenous populations in the colonies (Moore, 2015; 2021[). A
carbon-fuelled colonial capitalism has,]{.underline} therefore[, been
central to the accumulation of wealth]{.underline} in the Global North
and the disenfranchisement of the Global South (see Barnwell & Wood,
2022), [and this predates the Industrial Revolution. These processes of
capitalist extraction were then accelerated during the Industrial
Revolution]{.underline} (Bastola & Sapkota, 2015; Yao et al., 2019).
Indeed[, it has been recorded that atmospheric CO2 concentration has
increased by 48% since the Industrial Revolution]{.underline}(Wuebbles
et al., 2017). [Today, the overconsumption of nature's finite resources
accounts for]{.underline} the [unparalleled destabilisation of Earth's
life-support system, heightened pressure on human survivability, and
problems consequent upon climate change, biodiversity loss, conflict,
and resource scarcity]{.underline} (Arrow et al., 2004; Gaffney, 2014;
IISD, 2019). In a landmark report, it was found that **[100 of the
world's largest corporations are responsible for 71% of industrial
greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere]{.underline}**(Griffin,
2017). Another report found that **[a single billionaire emits one
million times more carbon annually than anyone else outside of the
richest 10% of the world's population]{.underline}** (Maitland et al.,
2022). The effects of these emissions are always more acute in the
Global South and in poorer communities (Barnwell & Wood, 2022), and in
this sense they **[signify the devastating effects of an imperial
capitalism that seeks to expand into and control
territories]{.underline}** (Değirmencioğlu, 2022). **[Whether air
pollution, drought, desertification, hurricanes, food shortages, or
rising sea levels -- the impacts of climate change disproportionately
affect the poor]{.underline}** (Fernandes-Jesus et al., 2020; Ingle,
2020). Capitalism contains within it what Marx called contradictions, or
competing interests, that impact the climate negatively (Malherbe,
2022). Here, historian Ellen Meiksins Wood's words remain prescient. She
writes that capitalism may be able to accommodate some degree of
ecological care, especially when the technology of environmental
protection is itself profitably marketable. But **[the essential
irrationality of the drive for capital accumulation, which subordinates
everything to the requirements of the self-expansion of capital and
so-called growth, is unavoidably hostile to ecological
balance]{.underline}** (Wood, 1988, p. 5). [The idea of limited
government interference puts the owner of capital in a vantage position
to relentlessly exploit nature]{.underline} (Anderson & Bows, 2012;
Puaschunder, 2017). **[Even when governments do 'interfere' in market
relations, it is usually in the service of capital]{.underline}**, with
very little separation noted between the interests of the capitalist
state and big business. For example, several Big Tech companies were
named in a case brought by the families of children killed or injured
while mining cobalt in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Kelly, 2019).
The extraction of cobalt has been linked to human rights abuses,
corruption, child labour, and environmental destruction (Kelly, 2019). A
study on the lifecycle assessment of cobalt extraction processes carried
out by Farjana et al. (2019) shows that carbon dioxide and nitrogen
dioxide emissions are highest from cobalt mining (Kelly, 2019). Colonial
capitalism depends on the destruction of land and lives. **[The drive
towards economic growth has had an impact not only on the Earth's finite
resources but also on the people who interact with these resources
either through their labour or in their daily lives]{.underline}**
(Poffenberger, 1990). Understanding climate change in terms of the
Capitalocene makes clear that capitalism has always relied on unpaid
work. Indeed, it is by labelling the environment -- along with colonial
and feminised subjects -- ['Nature' that capitalist ideology seeks to
justify the violence and the expropriation of free labour from women,
colonised subjects, and the environment]{.underline} (Moore, 2015;
2021); effectively cheapening all life and labour in the process (Amin,
2014). Moore characterises this process of domination as the climate
class divide, climate apartheid, and climate patriarchy which, together,
form the \'capitalogenic trinity that now drives us full throttle
towards the planetary inferno\' (Moore, 2021, p. 752).

#### Capitalism is the [root cause]{.underline} of [climate change]{.underline}.

Yet as the [planet continues to]{.underline}
**[deteriorate]{.underline}**, climate activists are finding more common
cause with my revolutionary friend than they might care to admit. While
many would part ways on the topic of communism, both camps see unbridled
[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[a]{.underline} **[threat to
humanity]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Both assert that [economic
justice]{.underline} for all is [key to]{.underline} our **[collective
survival]{.underline}**.

But what, exactly, are the links between capitalism and climate
disruption? I started looking at the research and was surprised. This
modern brand of anti-capitalism doesn't necessarily embrace the Marxist
or communist call to abolish capitalism. It only requires believers to
be [critical of]{.underline} **[consumerism]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Big Oil.]{.underline}**

"To [mainstream commerce]{.underline}, the [[Earth]{.underline}]{.mark}
is [[both]{.underline} [loot and dump]{.underline}]{.mark}," the British
environmentalist George Monbiot wrote in his book Out of the Wreckage.
"[Commercial activity]{.underline}, broadly speaking, [consists
of]{.underline} **[[extracting]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[resources]{.mark} from a hole in the ground]{.underline} on one side
of the planet, inducing people to buy them, then [[dumping them]{.mark}
a few [days later]{.mark}]{.underline} in a hole in the ground on the
other side."

As well, many concrete climate solutions follow from an anti-capitalist
approach to climate change --- all surprisingly hope-inducing at a time
when [meaningful action is]{.underline} **[stalling]{.underline}**.

Which raises the question: Are we missing out on important ideas because
we assume these schools of thought are fringe, boring or, worse,
irrelevant?

You don't need to have any particular politics to recognize that the
climate crisis is overwhelmingly attributable to economic activity. A
study in 2019 by the Colorado-based Climate Accountability Institute,
for example, found that [from the birth of]{.underline}
**[industry]{.underline}** in 1751 to 2017, the [production]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [burning]{.underline} [of products from]{.underline}
just [103]{.underline} fossil fuel [companies]{.underline} was
[responsible]{.underline} [for]{.underline} nearly **[70]{.underline}**
[percent of all]{.underline} the [**g**reen**h**ouse **g**a**s**
emissions]{.underline}.

From 1965 onward, once the [[whole planet had]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[**[endless hunger]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[energy]{.underline}**]{.mark}, the activities and products of just 20
of those companies contributed a third of all emissions. They include
[[Chevron]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Exxon]{.mark}Mobil]{.underline},
[[BP]{.underline}]{.mark} and the state-owned [companies]{.underline} of
[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, [Russia]{.underline}, [Iran]{.underline} and
[India]{.underline}, among others.

Once [oil and coal]{.underline} are extracted, it is the
**[[rich]{.underline}]{.mark}** who [[burn]{.mark} it [the
most]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, the team at the United Nations responsible for assessing
scientific research on the matter, said in 2022 that
[households]{.underline} "[with]{.underline} the [highest per capita
emissions contribute]{.underline} a **[disproportionately
[large]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[share of]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[[global]{.underline} household\] [[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}."

How disproportionate? On a planet of eight billion people, the richest
[one percent contribute]{.underline} the [same share]{.underline} of
yearly emissions [as]{.underline} the [poorest two-thirds]{.underline},
according to the Stockholm Environment Institute. To help visualize
those numbers, imagine the population of Germany emitting about as much
carbon dioxide as the populations of North America, Europe and Asia
combined. Billions of people use electricity, drive cars, cook with gas
and buy tonnes of plastic products every year and still emit less than
the number of people who watched the Super Bowl in 2023.

No matter what scale you look at, [[climate change]{.mark}
is]{.underline} deeply [**[tied]{.underline}** [to economic
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Industry feeds]{.underline}]{.mark} it;
[[consumers sustain it]{.underline}]{.mark}. The people most affected by
the climate crisis are always the most dispossessed, whether we look at
[[flooding]{.mark} island nations in the [Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}
or [[Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark} Peoples [[in]{.mark} the
[Amazon]{.mark}]{.underline} [[defending]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[land from logging companies]{.underline}]{.mark}. A [lack of
wealth]{.underline} or rights [makes you]{.underline}
**[vulnerable]{.underline}** to the whims of the powerful. If you accept
that premise, then you can't say the [[problem]{.underline}]{.mark} is a
few greedy companies operating in a few countries. It [has to
be]{.underline} **[[systemic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the
[[only]{.mark} accurate [label]{.mark}]{.underline} for that system
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

If you find that difficult to accept, you're not alone. Right-wing
politicians have increasingly begun referring to progressive policies
they dislike as "authoritarian," a word that recalls the Red Scare of
the Cold War. This rhetoric is more prominent in the United States than
in Canada, with 60 per- cent of Americans viewing socialism negatively,
according to a 2022 Pew Research survey.

"We're so used to capitalism that we don't necessarily even know it when
we see it," says Emily Huddart Kennedy, a sociologist at the University
of British Columbia who researches sustainable food movements.

She says many people find socialism and communism so unpalatable that
the distaste can "short-circuit people's ability to think thoughtfully
and reflectively." The reaction is so strong that she's noticed some
anti-capitalist campaigners have to avoid talking about their principles
in order to mobilize more people. "One participant said, 'If I start
spewing off about capitalism and power and oppression, nobody's going to
listen to me.'"

This phenomenon isn't entirely caused by simple bias. People also
genuinely struggle to come up with concrete forms of climate action that
don't require a capitalist economy, Kennedy says. For example, trying to
create an alternative food system is difficult without the capitalist
constructs of land tenure rights and industry partners who have
financing and supply chains. Devising feasible solutions and being an
anti-capitalist seem to be mutually exclusive.

Even academic economists, who like to say that they are ideologically
neutral, have trouble assessing anti-capitalist ideas without bias.
Between 2017 and 2018, economists Mohsen Javdani of Simon Fraser
University in Vancouver and HaJoon Chang of the School of Oriental and
African Studies in London surveyed 2,425 economists around the world for
ideological bias. Participants were presented with opinions from notable
economist thinkers with the attributions jumbled up. Then they were
asked whether they agreed with the opinions. In most cases, participants
were more likely to agree with a statement when told it came from a
mainstream thinker, like Adam Smith, than a less mainstream one, like
Karl Marx.

Neither of the researchers is an outright Marxist, by the way. Chang
believes in reforming the free market, not abolishing it. In his breezy
book 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism, published in 2010,
he points to the rapid economic growth of East Asian countries like
Taiwan and South Korea as an example of how capitalism can be a force
for good.

In fact, it's a philosopher-economist, Kohei Saito, of the University of
Tokyo, who has attempted, as he puts it, to "resolve the tension between
Red and Green." His 2020 book, Capital in the Anthropocene, became a
surprise hit in Japan. In early 2023, he released a sequel of sorts,
Marx in the Anthropocene, that drew on notebooks Karl Marx kept in the
last 15 years of his life. This was Saito's first popular book in
English, and reviews soon flooded in from the New York Times, the
Guardian and other esteemed publications that seemed to be taking Saito
seriously.

At the heart of his analysis is Marx's conclusion not just that wealth
is produced by the many and hoarded by the few, but that
[[nature]{.underline}]{.mark} itself [is [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[casualty]{.underline}** [of capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
example, in 1869, Marx documented his concern about the consequences of
industrialized livestock rearing, driven by a growing appetite for meat.
"It will not be long before the Irish farmer experiences that this
system will end in the total exhaustion of the land," he wrote.

In other words, Saito argues that [[capitalism]{.underline} [and a
healthy planet are]{.underline} **[intrinsically at
odds]{.underline}**]{.mark}. He even says that our [individual lives are
**stunted**]{.underline} because [[we've lost]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[joy]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that comes [from engaging with]{.mark}
[nature]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We [seek fulfilment
in]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[destructive]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[extravagant]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[wasteful]{.underline}** [[products]{.underline}]{.mark}."

#### Capitalism is the largest contributor to climate change

Martin Hart -- **Landsberg 24** \[Martin Hart-Landsberg is Professor
Emeritus of Economics at Lewis and Clark College, Portland, Oregon. He
is the author of seven books on issues related to globalization and the
political economy "Feeling the heat: Capitalism and global warming"
https://www.streetroots.org/news/2024/07/24/feeling-heat-capitalism-and-global-warming\]
(FG)

We are in real trouble. [Global carbon dioxide emissions]{.underline}
(the main cause of global warming) [continue to rise]{.underline},
hitting a new high in 2023. Last year was also the hottest in recorded
history, and, year by year, more Americans feel the consequences. Yet,
we have seen only modest attempts to bring emissions down. Martin
Hart-Landsberg is a professor emeritus of economics at Lewis and Clark
College. Unfortunately, the U.S. government continues to believe,
despite evidence to the contrary, that market forces will encourage a
speedy transition away from fossil fuels. Instead, we need to organize
in support of direct action to bring down energy use and emissions. We
need nothing less than a system-wide transformation of our economy. It's
getting hotter Alarm bells are ringing in government circles. "Heat is
no longer a silent killer," Xavier Becerra, U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services secretary, said. "From coast-to-coast, [communities
are battling to keep people cool, safe and alive due to the growing
impacts of the climate crisis]{.underline}." According to his agency,
there were approximately 2,300 heat-related deaths in 2023, triple the
annual average between 2004 and 2018. However, because only those with
death certificates listing heat as the main cause of death are included,
most researchers believe the actual count to be far higher. And 2024 is
shaping up to be another scorcher. Much of the country is suffering from
unusually hot weather. In June, The Guardian reported "about 80% of the
country's population" were "experiencing a kind of heatwave not seen in
decades, smashing records." The Pacific Northwest is no exception, with
July temperatures soaring over 100 degrees in a number of Oregon cities.
As an Oregon Public Broadcasting article pointed out, "The abnormally
high temperatures, part of a multiyear warming trend in Oregon, are
prompting concerns about health in a state where many homes lack air
conditioning." Markets are not the answer President Joe Biden has touted
his administration's efforts to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. At
its core, his clean energy strategy can be summarized as follows:
electrify as much of the economy as possible, as quickly as possible,
using solar and wind power. The Biden administration has used financial
incentives and regulatory initiatives to push the economy in the desired
direction, but market dynamics --- the decline in the cost of renewal
energy relative to that of fossil fuels --- was always expected to be
the main driver. That cost crossover happened some five years ago, yet
[fossil fuel use continues to grow. U.S. crude oil production set a new
record in 2023. Although renewable energy production has expanded
significantly in recent years, fossil fuel use in electricity generation
continues to grow; the share generated by natural gas hit a record
high]{.underline} of 42.1% in 2023. Rather than replacing fossil fuels,
solar and wind power are largely satisfying the steady increase in
overall electricity demand. **[The main reason lower solar and wind
costs fails to speed the expected transition away from fossil fuels is
that investors don't find renewables an attractive investment. It's
about the money,]{.underline}** as Brett Christophers, a professor of
human geography, explained in a recent column in The Guardian. "Bluntly
stated**[, clean energy --- developing and operating solar and
windfarms, and selling the electricity they generate --- simply isn't a
very attractive business]{.underline}**," Christophers wrote. "Returns
are typically in the 5-8% range. Compare that with oil and gas
production, where returns generally exceed 15%, and it is little
**[wonder clean energy stocks have been falling while oil and gas shares
outperform." Profitability, not prices, matters to CEOs and
stockholders, and the profitability of fossil fuels is too good to pass
up, no matter the climate threat. It's not too late to act We must act
quickly to reduce emissions.]{.underline}** According to the United
Nations' climate chief we are on track for a "ruinously high" 4.86
degree temperature rise, far above the 2.7 degree target established by
the Paris Climate Conference. Such a rise would likely mean "Two billion
people would be pushed outside humanity's 'climate niche,' i.e. the
benign conditions in which the whole of civilization arose over the past
10,000 years," climate experts told The Guardian.

### R/C -- Disease

#### Capitalist [growth]{.underline} is the [root cause of disease]{.underline}. 

Ian **Angus 24**. Editor of the journal Climate & Capitalism, a frequent
contributor to Monthly Review, and a founding executive member of the
Global Ecosocialist Network. "Capitalism's New Age of Plagues, Part 1:
An Existential Threat." Climate and Capitalism. March 5, 2024.
https://climateandcapitalism.com/2024/03/05/capitalisms-new-age-of-plagues-1/

Unlike previous pandemics, [COVID-19 is part of a wave of [new
infectious diseases]{.mark} that scientists say mark the arrival of a
"qualitatively distinct" period in human health]{.underline},\[6\] that
will "reverse many of the 20th century's advances in the control of
lethal infectious disease. ... \[and\] [return humanity to an earlier
health pattern [characterized by **high mortality**]{.mark} from lethal
infectious disease]{.underline}."\[7\] Contrary to optimistic 20th
Century predictions, infectious diseases have not been conquered. [[New
diseases]{.mark} are [proliferating, and many]{.mark} thought to have
been wiped out [have returned as major threats]{.mark} to human
health]{.underline}.

The list of new arrivals incudes [chikungunya, Q fever, Chagas disease,
**multiple influenzas**, swine fever, Lyme disease, Zika, SARS, **MERS,
Nipah**, Mpox, Ebola, and many more]{.underline}, on top of resurgent
enemies like [cholera, anthrax, polio, measles, tuberculosis, **malaria
and yellow fever**]{.underline}. According to the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, at current rates the [annual [probability
of extreme epidemics could **triple**]{.mark} in coming
decades.]{.underline}\[8\]

As David Quammen writes, the [simultaneous emergence and
[re-emergence]{.mark} of multiple contagious diseases [is no
coincidence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

"Make no mistake, [they are connected, these disease outbreaks coming
one after another]{.underline}. And they are not simply happening to us;
[they [represent the **unintended results** of things we are
doing]{.mark}]{.underline}. They reflect the convergence of two forms of
crises on our planet. [The first **[crisis is ecological]{.mark}**, the
second is medical. As the two intersect, their joint consequences appear
as a pattern of weird and terrible new diseases]{.underline}, emerging
from unexpected sources."\[9\]

In mid-2020, while scientifically illiterate politicians were still
insisting that COVID-19 was no worse than flu and would soon fade away,
the UN's Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and
Ecosystem Services (IPBES) convened a [multidisciplinary scientific
panel to summarize the state of scientific knowledge about COVID-19 and
other diseases]{.underline} that spread from animals to humans.\[10\]
The experts' report --- which had the singular advantage that it was not
watered down or edited by politicians and bureaucrats --- offered a very
different account of the dangers posed by zoonotic diseases in our time.
Some excerpts:

"[[Pandemics represent an **existential threat**]{.mark} to the health
and welfare of people across our planet]{.underline}. The scientific
evidence reviewed in this report demonstrates that pandemics are
[[becoming more frequent]{.mark}, driven by a continued rise in the
underlying emerging disease events that spark them]{.underline}. Without
preventative strategies, [pandemics [will emerge more often, spread more
rapidly, kill more people,]{.mark} and affect the global economy with
more devastating impact than ever before]{.underline}."

"The risk of pandemics is increasing rapidly, with more than five new
diseases emerging in people every year, any one of which has the
potential to spread and become pandemic. The risk of a pandemic is
driven by exponentially increasing anthropogenic changes. Blaming
wildlife for the emergence of diseases is thus erroneous, because
emergence is caused by human activities and the impacts of these
activities on the environment."

"The [[underlying causes]{.mark} of pandemics are the same [global
environmental changes]{.mark} that drive biodiversity loss and climate
change]{.underline}. These include [**[land-use]{.mark}** change,
**[agricultural expansion]{.mark}** and intensification, and wildlife
**[trade and consumption.]{.mark}**]{.underline}"

In short, the [global ecological destruction that Earth System
scientists have dubbed [the **Great Acceleration** is driving humanity
into]{.mark} an age of [Great Sickening]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unless
radical changes are made, we can expect that COVID-19 will not be the
last global pandemic --- or the most deadly.

### R/C -- Structural Violence

#### Capitalism's response to [systemic crises]{.underline} creates conditions for fascism, environmental destruction, and militarism. The impact is [mass structural violence]{.underline} and [genocide]{.underline}.

William I. **ROBINSON 16**, professor of sociology, global studies and
Latin American studies at U.C. Santa Barbara \["Sadistic Capitalism: Six
Urgent Matters for Humanity in Global Crisis," *Truth-out*, April 12,
2016,
http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/35596-sadistic-capitalism-six-urgent-matters-for-humanity-in-global-crisis\]

[In]{.underline} these mean streets of [globalized
capitalism]{.underline} in crisis, [it has become profitable to turn
poverty and inequality into a tourist attraction]{.underline}.

The South African Emoya Luxury Hotel and Spa company has made a
glamorized spectacle of it. The resort recently advertised an
opportunity for tourists to stay \"in our unique Shanty Town \... and
experience traditional township living within a safe private game
reserve environment.\" A cluster of simulated shanties outside of
Bloemfontein that the company has constructed \"is ideal for team
building, braais, bachelors \[parties\], theme parties and an experience
of a lifetime,\" read the ad. The luxury accommodations, made to appear
from the outside as shacks, featured paraffin lamps, candles, a
battery-operated radio, an outside toilet, a drum and fireplace for
cooking, as well as under-floor heating, air conditioning and wireless
internet access. A well-dressed, young white couple is pictured
embracing in a field with the corrugated tin shanties in the background.
The only thing missing in this fantasy world of sanitized space and
glamorized poverty was the people themselves living in poverty.

[The "luxury shanty town" in South Africa is a fitting metaphor for
global capitalism as a whole. Faced with a stagnant global economy,
[elites]{.mark} have managed to turn war, [structural violence]{.mark}
and inequality [into **opportunities for capital**]{.mark}, pleasure and
entertainment]{.underline}. It is hard not to conclude that [unchecked
capitalism has become]{.underline} what I term ["sadistic capitalism,"
in which the suffering and deprivation generated by capitalism become a
source of aesthetic pleasure]{.underline}, leisure and entertainment for
others.

I recently had the opportunity to travel through several countries in
Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, East Asia and throughout
North America. I was on sabbatical to research what the global crisis
looks like on the ground around the world. Everywhere I went, [social
polarization and political tensions have reached explosive
dimensions]{.underline}.

Where is the crisis headed, what are the possible outcomes and what does
it tell us about global capitalism and resistance? [This crisis is not
like earlier structural crises of world capitalism]{.underline}, such as
in the 1930s or 1970s. [This one is]{.underline} fast becoming
[systemic]{.underline}. The crisis of humanity shares aspects of earlier
structural crises of world capitalism, but [there are]{.underline} six
[novel, interrelated dimensions to the current moment]{.underline} that
I highlight here, in broad strokes, as the \"big picture\" context in
which countries and peoples around the world are experiencing a descent
into chaos and uncertainty.

1\) [[The level of]{.mark} global social polarization and **[inequality
is unprecedented]{.mark}** in the face of out-of-control,
over-accumulated capital]{.underline}. In January 2016, the development
agency Oxfam published a follow-up to its report on global inequality
that had been released the previous year. According to the new report,
now just [62 billionaires]{.underline} \-- down from 80 identified by
the agency in its January 2015 report \-- [control as much wealth as one
half of the world\'s population, and [the top 1% owns more]{.mark}
wealth [than]{.mark} the other [99]{.mark}% combined]{.underline}.
Beyond the transnational capitalist class and the upper echelons of the
global power bloc, [the richest 20 percent of humanity owns some 95
percent of the world\'s wealth, while the bottom 80 percent has to make
do with]{.underline} just [5 percent]{.underline}.

This 20-80 divide of global society into haves and the have-nots is the
new global social apartheid. [It is evident not just
between]{.underline} rich and poor [countries, but within each
country]{.underline}, North and South, [with the]{.underline} rise of
new affluent high-consumption sectors alongside the downward mobility,
["precariatization," destabilization and expulsion of
majorities]{.underline}.

[[Escalating inequalities fuel]{.mark} capitalism's **chronic problem of
[over-accumulation]{.mark}**: The transnational capitalist class cannot
find productive outlets to unload the enormous amounts of surplus it has
accumulated, leading to stagnation]{.underline} in the world economy.
The signs of an impending depression are everywhere. The front page of
the February 20 issue of The Economist read, \"The World Economy: Out of
Ammo?\"

[Extreme levels of social polarization present a challenge to dominant
groups. They strive to purchase the loyalty of that 20 percent, while at
the same time dividing the 80 percent, co-opting some into a hegemonic
bloc and repressing the rest. Alongside the spread of frightening new
systems of social control and repression is heightened dissemination
through the culture industries and corporate marketing strategies that
depoliticize through consumerist fantasies]{.underline} and the
manipulation of desire.

As \"Trumpism\" in the United States so well illustrates, [another
strategy of co-optation is the **manipulation of [fear and
insecurity]{.mark}** among the downwardly mobile so that social anxiety
[is channeled toward **scapegoated communities**]{.mark}. This
psychosocial mechanism of displacing mass anxieties is not new, but it
appears to be increasing around the world in the face of the structural
destabilization of capitalist globalization. Scapegoated communities are
under siege, [such as]{.mark} the Rohingya in Myanmar, [the Muslim
minority in India]{.mark}, the [Kurds]{.mark} in Turkey, southern
African immigrants in South Africa, [and]{.mark} Syrian and Iraqi
[refugees]{.mark}]{.underline} and other immigrants [in
Europe]{.underline}.

As with its 20th century predecessor, [21st century fascism hinges on
such manipulation of social anxiety at a time of acute capitalist
crisis. Extreme [inequality requires]{.mark} **extreme [violence and
repression]{.mark}** [that lend to]{.mark}]{.underline} projects of 21st
century **[[fascism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

2\) [The system is fast reaching the ecological limits to its
reproduction. We have reached several]{.underline} tipping points in
what environmental scientists refer to as nine crucial [\"planetary
boundaries.\" [We have]{.mark}]{.underline} already [[exceeded]{.mark}
these [boundaries in]{.mark}]{.underline} three areas \-- [[climate
change]{.mark}, the nitrogen cycle [and diversity
loss]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There have been five previous mass extinctions in earth\'s history.
While all these were due to natural causes, for the first time ever,
human conduct is intersecting with and fundamentally altering the earth
system.

We have entered what Paul Crutzen, the Dutch environmental scientist and
Nobel Prize winner, termed the Anthropocene \-- a new age in which
humans have transformed up to half of the world\'s surface. [[We
are]{.mark} altering the composition of the atmosphere and [acidifying
the oceans at a rate that undermines the conditions for
life]{.mark}]{.underline}. The ecological dimensions of global crisis
cannot be understated.

\"We are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways
will remain open and which will forever be closed,\" observes Elizabeth
Kolbert in her best seller, The Sixth Extinction. \"No other creature
has ever managed this \... The Sixth Extinction will continue to
determine the course of life long after everything people have written
and painted and built has been ground into dust.\"

Capitalism cannot be held solely responsible. The human-nature
contradiction has deep roots in civilization itself. The ancient
Sumerian empires, for example, collapsed after the population
over-salinated their crop soil. The Mayan city-state network collapsed
about AD 900 due to deforestation. And the former Soviet Union wrecked
havoc on the environment.

However, [given capital's implacable impulse to accumulate profit and
its accelerated commodification of nature, it is difficult to imagine
that the environmental catastrophe can be resolved within the capitalist
system. "Green capitalism" appears as an **oxymoron**, as **sadistic
capitalism's** attempt to turn the ecological crisis into a
**profit-making opportunity**]{.underline}, along with the conversion of
poverty into a tourist attraction.

3\) [[The]{.mark} sheer [magnitude of]{.mark} the means of [violence is
unprecedented]{.mark}, as is the concentrated control over
the]{.underline} means of global communications and the production and
[circulation of knowledge, symbols and images. We have seen the spread
of frightening new systems of social control and repression that have
brought us into the panoptical surveillance society and the age of
thought control]{.underline}. This real-life Orwellian world is in a
sense more perturbing than that described by George Orwell in his iconic
novel 1984. In that fictional world, people were compelled to give their
obedience to the state ("Big Brother") in exchange for a quiet existence
with guarantees of employment, housing and other social necessities.
Now, however, the corporate and political powers that be force obedience
even as the means of survival are denied to the vast majority.

Global apartheid involves the creation of \"green zones\" that are
cordoned off in each locale around the world where elites are insulated
through new systems of spatial reorganization, social control and
policing. \"Green zone\" refers to the nearly impenetrable area in
central Baghdad that US occupation forces established in the wake of the
2003 invasion of Iraq. The command center of the occupation and select
Iraqi elite inside that green zone were protected from the violence and
chaos that engulfed the country.

Urban areas around the world are now green zoned through gentrification,
gated communities, surveillance systems, and state and private violence.
Inside the world\'s green zones, privileged strata avail themselves of
privatized social services, consumption and entertainment. They can work
and communicate through internet and satellite sealed off under the
protection of armies of soldiers, police and private security forces.

Green zoning takes on distinct forms in each locality. In Palestine, I
witnessed such zoning in the form of Israeli military checkpoints,
Jewish settler-only roads and the apartheid wall. In Mexico City, the
most exclusive residential areas in the upscale Santa Fe District are
accessible only by helicopter and private gated roads. In Johannesburg,
a surreal drive through the exclusive Sandton City area reveals rows of
mansions that appear as military compounds, with private armed towers
and electrical and barbed-wire fences. In Cairo, I toured satellite
cities ringing the impoverished center and inner suburbs where the
country\'s elite could live out their aspirations and fantasies. They
sport gated residential complexes with spotless green lawns, private
leisure and shopping centers and English-language international schools
under the protection of military checkpoints and private security
police.

In other cities, green zoning is subtler but no less effective. In Los
Angeles, where I live, the freeway system now has an express lane
reserved for those that can pay an exorbitant toll. On this lane, the
privileged speed by, while the rest remain one lane over, stuck in the
city\'s notorious bumper-to-bumper traffic \-- or even worse, in
notoriously underfunded and underdeveloped public transportation, where
it may take half a day to get to and from work. There is no barrier
separating this express lane from the others. However, a near-invisible
closed surveillance system monitors every movement. If a vehicle without
authorization shifts into the exclusive lane, it is instantly recorded
by this surveillance system and a heavy fine is imposed on the driver,
under threat of impoundment, while freeway police patrols are
ubiquitous.

[Outside of]{.underline} the global [green zones, warfare and police
containment have become normalized and sanitized for those not directly
at the receiving end of armed aggression. \"Militainment\" \--
portraying]{.underline} and even glamorizing [war and violence as
entertaining spectacles]{.underline} through Hollywood films and
television police shows, computer games and corporate \"news\" channels
\-- [may be the epitome of sadistic capitalism. It desensitizes,
bringing about complacency]{.underline} and indifference.

[In between the green zones and outright warfare are prison industrial
complexes, immigrant and refugee repression and control systems, the
criminalization of outcast communities and capitalist schooling. The
omnipresent media and [cultural apparatuses]{.mark} of the corporate
economy]{.underline}, in particular, aim to [[**colonize the mind** \--
to undermine the ability to **think critically**]{.mark} and outside the
dominant worldview. [A **neofascist culture** emerges through
militarism]{.mark}, extreme masculinization, racism [and racist
mobilizations]{.mark} against scapegoats]{.underline}.

4\) We are reaching limits to the extensive expansion of capitalism.
[Capitalism is like riding a bicycle: When you stop
pedaling]{.underline} the bicycle, [you fall over. [If the]{.mark}
capitalist [system stops expanding]{.mark} outward, [it enters
crisis]{.mark} and faces collapse. In each earlier structural crisis,
the system went through a new round of extensive expansion \-- from
waves of colonial conquest]{.underline} in earlier centuries, [to the
integration]{.underline} in the late 20th and early 21st centuries
[of]{.underline} the [former socialist countries]{.underline}, China,
India and other areas that had been marginally outside the system.
[There are no longer any new territories to integrate into world
capitalism]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, the privatization of education, health care, utilities, basic
services and public land are turning those spaces in global society that
were outside of capital\'s control into \"spaces of capital.\" [Even
poverty has been turned into a commodity. What is there left to
commodify? Where can the system now expand? [With the limits to
expansion comes]{.mark} a turn toward **[militarized]{.mark}
accumulation** \-- making wars of [endless destruction]{.mark} and
reconstruction and expanding the militarization of social and political
institutions so as to [continue to generate]{.mark} new opportunities
for [accumulation in the face of
stagnation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

5\) [There is the rise of a vast surplus population inhabiting a
\"planet of slums,\" alienated from the]{.underline} productive
[economy, thrown into the margins and subject to]{.underline} these
sophisticated systems of [social control and destruction. [Global
capitalism]{.mark} has no direct use for surplus humanity]{.underline}.
But indirectly, [it [holds wages down]{.mark} everywhere [and
makes]{.mark} new systems of 21st century [slavery possible]{.mark}.
These systems include [prison labor]{.mark}, the [forced]{.mark}
recruitment of [miners]{.mark} at gunpoint by warlords contracted by
global corporations to dig up valuable minerals]{.underline} in the
Congo, [[sweatshops]{.mark} and exploited immigrant
communities]{.underline} (including the rising tide of immigrant female
caregivers for affluent populations).

Furthermore, the global working class is experiencing accelerated
\"precariatization.\" [The \"new precariat\" refers to the proletariat
that faces capital under today's unstable and precarious labor
relations]{.underline} \-- informalization, casualization, part-time,
temp, immigrant and contract labor.

As communities are uprooted everywhere, there is a rising reserve army
of immigrant labor. The global working class is becoming divided into
citizen and immigrant workers. The latter are particularly attractive to
transnational capital, as the lack of citizenship rights makes them
particularly vulnerable, and therefore, exploitable.

[The challenge for dominant groups is how to contain the real and
potential rebellion of surplus humanity, the immigrant workforce and the
precariat]{.underline}. How can they contain the explosive
contradictions of this system? The 21st century [megacities become the
battlegrounds between mass resistance movements and]{.underline} the new
systems of [mass repression. Some [populations]{.mark} in these
cities]{.underline} (and also in abandoned countryside) [[are at risk
of]{.mark} **[genocide]{.mark}**, such as those in Gaza, zones in
Somalia and Congo, and swaths of Iraq and Syria]{.underline}.

6\) [There is a disjuncture between a globalizing economy and a
nation-state-based system of political authority. Transnational state
apparatuses]{.underline} are incipient and [do not wield enough power
and authority to]{.underline} organize and [stabilize the
system]{.underline}, much less to impose regulations on runaway
transnational capital. In the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, for
instance, the governments of the G-8 and G-20 were unable to impose
transnational regulation on the global financial system, despite a
series of emergency summits to discuss such regulation.

Elites historically have attempted to resolve the problems of
over-accumulation by state policies that can regulate the anarchy of the
market. However, in recent decades, [transnational capital has broken
free from the constraints imposed by the nation-state]{.underline}. The
more \"enlightened\" elite representatives of the transnational
capitalist class are now clamoring for transnational mechanisms of
regulation that would allow the global ruling class to reign in the
anarchy of the system in the interests of saving global capitalism from
itself and from radical challenges from below.

At the same time, the division of the world into some 200 competing
nation-states is not the most propitious of circumstances for the global
working class. Victories in popular struggles from below in any one
country or region can (and often do) become diverted and even undone by
the structural power of transnational capital and the direct political
and military domination that this structural power affords the dominant
groups. In Greece, for instance, the leftist Syriza party came to power
in 2015 on the heels of militant worker struggles and a mass uprising.
But the party abandoned its radical program as a result of the enormous
pressure exerted on it from the European Central Bank and private
international creditors.

The Systemic Critique of Global Capitalism

A growing number of transnational elites themselves now recognize that
any resolution to the global crisis must involve redistribution downward
of income.

However, in the viewpoint of those from below, a neo-Keynesian
redistribution within the prevailing corporate power structure is not
enough. [What is required is a redistribution of power downward and
transformation toward a system in which social need trumps private
profit]{.underline}.

[A global rebellion against the transnational capitalist class has
spread since]{.underline} the financial collapse of [2008. Wherever one
looks, there is popular, grassroots and leftist struggle, and the rise
of new cultures of resistance: the Arab Spring]{.underline}; the
resurgence of [leftist politics in Greece, Spain and elsewhere in
Europe; the tenacious resistance of Mexican social
movements]{.underline} following the Ayotzinapa massacre of 2014; [the
favela uprising in Brazil]{.underline} against the government\'s World
Cup and Olympic expulsion policies; [the student strikes in Chile; the
remarkable surge in the Chinese workers' movement; the shack dwellers
and other poor people\'s campaigns in South Africa; Occupy Wall Street,
the immigrant rights movement, Black Lives Matter, fast food workers\'
struggle]{.underline} and the mobilization around the Bernie Sanders
presidential campaign in the United States.

[This global revolt is spread unevenly and faces many challenges. A
number of these struggles]{.underline}, moreover, [have suffered
setbacks]{.underline}, such as the Greek working-class movement and,
tragically, the Arab Spring. What type of a transformation is viable,
and how do we achieve it? How we interpret the global crisis is itself a
matter of vital importance as politics polarize worldwide between a
neofascist and a popular response. [The [systemic critique]{.mark} of
global capitalism [must]{.mark} strive to
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, from this vantage point, [the discourse
and practice of [movements]{.mark} for a more just distribution of
wealth and power. Our survival may depend on it]{.underline}.

### Injustice

#### The American national economy can only [sustain itself]{.underline} by [externalizing]{.underline} the negatives of capitalist growth [onto the periphery]{.underline}.

Accessed 02-15-2022)

To answer these questions, we must come to grips with a [key feature of
the world economy]{.underline}---one that pundits in the global North
tend either to ignore or wish away---namely, the fact that
**[[capitalist growth is fundamentally dependent on
imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This arrangement, which has
persisted now for 500 years]{.underline} in various forms, [is beginning
to come under significant strain, and climate breakdown is likely to
widen the cracks]{.underline}. This opens up opportunities for change,
but also poses significant dangers. Everything depends on how
governments and social movements choose to respond.

The key thing to grasp is that, [under [capitalism]{.mark}, "growth" is
not about increasing production in order to meet human
needs]{.underline}. [It [is about increasing production in order
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[extract and accumulate
profit]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [That is the overriding
objective]{.underline}. [To keep such a system going
requires]{.underline} several interventions. First, you have to
[**cheapen** the prices of inputs]{.underline} (labor, land, materials,
energy, suppliers, etc.) as much as possible, and maintain those prices
at a low level. Second, you have to ensure [a constantly increasing
supply of those cheap inputs]{.underline}. And third, you need to
[establish control over captive markets that will absorb your
output]{.underline}.

[[Growth]{.mark} along these lines [cannot occur within an **isolated**
system]{.mark}]{.underline}. If you place too much pressure on your
domestic resource base or your domestic working class, sooner or later
you are likely to face a revolution. [To avoid such an
outcome,]{.underline} **[[capitalism always requires an
"outside,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** external to itself, [where it can
cheapen labor and nature with impunity and appropriate them on a vast
scale]{.underline}; an outside [[where it can]{.underline}
**["externalize"]{.underline}** [social and ecological
damages]{.underline}]{.mark}, where rebellions can be contained, and
where it does not have to negotiate with local grievances or demands.

[This is where the colonies come in]{.underline}. From the origins of
capitalism in the late 15th century, [[growth in the "core"]{.mark} of
the world economy]{.underline} (Western Europe, the United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan) [[has always depended on
the]{.underline} **[sabotage of labor and resources in the
"periphery"]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[Consider the silver plundered from
the Andes]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the sugar and cotton extracted from
land [appropriated from Indigenous Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
grain, rubber, gold [and countless other resources appropriated from
Asia and Africa]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the [mass
enslavement]{.mark} and indenture of African and Indigenous
people]{.underline}---all of which exacted a staggering human and
ecological toll. On top of this, [colonizers destroyed local industries
and self-sufficient economies wherever they went, in order to establish
captive markets]{.underline}. There was no lag between the rise of
capitalism and the imperial project. **[Imperialism was the *mechanism*
of capitalist expansion]{.underline}**.

As the Indian economists Utsa Patnaik and Prabhat Patnaik put it,
[[capitalist growth requires an imperial
arrangement]{.underline}]{.mark}---not as a side gig but [[as
a]{.underline} ***[structurally necessary feature]{.underline}***.
[Imperialism ensures that inputs remain cheap]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and
thus maintains the conditions for capital accumulation]{.underline}. But
it [also underpins the fragile inter-class truce that prevails in the
core states]{.underline}. If you're going to raise the real wages of the
working classes in the core, or take steps to protect the local ecology,
then in order to maintain capital accumulation you have to compensate
for this by depressing the costs of labor and nature elsewhere, namely,
among workers and producers in the global South. Ever since the rise of
the labor movement in the late 19th century, [capital's concessions to
the working classes in Europe and the United States have been
possible]{.underline} in large part [because of
imperialism]{.underline}.

[This arrangement came under strain in the middle of the 20th
century]{.underline}, however, as radical anti-imperialist movements
gained traction across the global South. After winning political
independence, many Southern governments set about dismantling colonial
systems of extraction. They protected their economies and supported
their domestic producers using tariffs, subsidies and capital controls;
they instituted land reforms; they nationalized key resources and
industries; they rolled out public services and improved workers' wages.
This movement was successful in advancing economic sovereignty and
improving human development across much of the South. But it also
constrained the core's access to cheap labor and nature, and reduced
their control over Southern markets.

[The collapse of the imperial arrangement posed a significant threat to
Northern capital accumulation]{.underline}. This problem was mitigated
for a time by Keynesian policy: massive government expenditure boosted
aggregate demand in the global North and generated an extraordinary
economic expansion, providing a temporary "fix" for capital. Further
concessions to the working classes of the core were sustained under
these conditions, permitting the rise of social democracy in some
states. But [this fix could only hold for so long]{.underline}. As wages
rose in the core and the supply price rose in the periphery, growth
ground to a halt, capital accumulation became increasingly untenable,
and [by the mid-1970s the economies of the global North were overcome by
a full-blown crisis of stagflation]{.underline}. As it turns out,
**[[capitalism cannot function]{.underline}]{.mark}** for long [**[under
conditions of global justice]{.underline}**. [Fair wages and
decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark} are compatible with a functioning
economy, but they [[are not compatible with a functioning capitalist
economy, because they limit the possibility of capital
accumulation]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[To deal with]{.mark} the [crisis]{.mark} of the 1970s, capital needed
a way to restore the imperial arrangement]{.underline}, to once again
depress Southern prices and regain access to Southern markets. [To
achieve this, the [core states]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[intervened]{.underline}** [to depose progressive leaders in the
global South]{.underline}]{.mark}---including, most prominently,
Mossadegh in Iran, Arbenz in Guatemala, Sukarno in Indonesia, Nkrumah in
Ghana, and Allende in Chile---[replacing them with regimes more amenable
to Northern economic interests]{.underline}. But [[the final blow was
delivered by]{.mark}]{.underline} the World Bank and the IMF, which
during the 1980s and 1990s imposed neoliberal structural adjustment
programs (**[[SAPs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) across the region. [This move
shifted control over economic policy from the national parliaments of
the South to technocrats in Washington and bankers in New
York]{.underline} and London, ending the brief era of economic
sovereignty. SAPs dismantled protections on labor and the environment,
privatized public goods and cut public spending, reversing the reforms
of the anti-colonial movement in one fell swoop.

[It worked: wages and prices in the South collapsed under structural
adjustment, and [the new]{.mark} "free trade" [regime allowed Northern
capital to shift production abroad]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to take
direct advantage of cheap labor and inputs. [This enabled a massive
increase in the scale and intensity of appropriation from the global
South during the 1980s and 1990s, restoring the imperial arrangement and
resolving the crisis of capitalism]{.underline}. Those who see
neoliberalism as the main problem, and who fantasize about reverting to
a less destructive version of capitalist growth, fail to grasp this
point. The neoliberal turn was not some kind of mistake; it was
necessary to restore the conditions for growth in the core. It was the
obligatory next step in capitalist development.

[[But now]{.underline}]{.mark}, as the 21st century wears on, [the
engines of imperial appropriation are slowing down again]{.underline}.
[This reality is evident in the declining rate of economic growth in the
core states]{.underline}, which economists have come to refer to as
"secular stagnation." This is happening for several reasons.

[First]{.underline}, in the wake of structural adjustment, the collapse
of the USSR, and the semi-integration of China, [there are few
nation-states and territories left that have not been brought into the
remit of the capitalist world system]{.underline}. **[[Imperialist
expansion has]{.underline}]{.mark}** effectively
**[[reached]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[limits]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of the planet. Now, instead of shifting production to new pools of cheap
labor, capital has to deal with the existing workforce and their demands
for higher wages. Second, certain regions of the South---specifically
China and the leftist states of South America---are managing to push
back against imperialism and improve their terms of trade, even while
operating within the basic structure of the capitalist economy. All of
[this is leading to a rising supply price, which spells trouble for
capital accumulation --- and growth --- in the core]{.underline}.

But perhaps most importantly --- and this is the clincher --- [climate
change and ecological breakdown are beginning to]{.underline}
**[undermine the conditions of production]{.underline}** [on the
tropical landmass]{.underline}. This is beginning to manifest already,
[with climate chaos ravaging parts of Central America, the Middle East
and North Africa]{.underline}, driving social dislocation and human
displacement. Without some kind of dramatic change in direction it will
get much worse. With [existing policies]{.underline}, we are headed for
2.7 degrees of heating this century, which is [likely to trigger
multi-breadbasket failure and sustained food supply disruptions across
large parts of the global South]{.underline}, displace more than 1.5
billion people, wipe out 30--50% of species, and render much of the
tropics uninhabitable for humans.

[This is a problem for capital, because **[growth]{.mark} in the global
North [depends]{.mark}**]{.underline} utterly **[[on]{.mark} production
in the global South]{.underline}** and depends utterly on **[[Southern
land and resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[today just as much as
during the colonial period]{.underline}. Recent research finds that
[rich countries rely on]{.underline} a net appropriation of land equal
to twice the size of India, a net appropriation of **[[10 billion
tons]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of material resources per year,
[and]{.mark} a net appropriation of embodied labor equivalent
to]{.underline} a standing army of **[[180 million
workers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This means that [as labor is displaced
and disrupted, and as the productive capacity of land is
constrained]{.underline} by heatwaves, wildfires, storms and
desertification, [[this will lead to a rising supply price in the core
that will trigger a **severe crisis for
capital**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[more serious than anything it has yet
encountered]{.underline}.

[The question is, [how will the core states
respond?]{.mark}]{.underline} To maintain the rate of growth and capital
accumulation in the face of this crisis, they will have to find a way to
cut the supply price once again.

[There are two obvious possibilities]{.underline}. [[One option
is]{.mark} to cut wages]{.underline} in the core states, [shred the
welfare system and privatize public services]{.underline}, all of which
would help cheapen inputs and open up new frontiers for accumulation,
giving some reprieve to capital. This option --- **[[domestic neoliberal
austerity]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- was deployed in the US and Britain
during the 1980s as part of the response to the initial collapse of the
imperial arrangement. Now it [is being increasingly taken up by the
European social democracies]{.underline} themselves, including the
Nordics.

Of course, the risk of [this approach]{.underline} is that it [could
trigger a backlash from the domestic working class]{.underline}, which
could coalesce into a socialist revolution. [Aware of this danger,
[politicians will seek to promote]{.mark} anti-immigrant
and]{.underline} [**[white nationalist]{.underline}**
[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}. By directing working-class grievance
toward an "other," [this approach gets people to accept their own
immiseration, so long as they can feel an affinity with the ruling class
on the basis of race]{.underline}, and feel superior to people of colour
who are kept in conditions more miserable than their own. This strategy
has long been used to support the neoliberal project in the United
States, and the ruling classes of the UK and Europe are now also turning
to this playbook. Boris Johnson is a master of this in British politics.

[[The second option is that the core states could **double down on
imperialism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It is not difficult to
imagine]{.underline} [**[new rounds of invasion]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[occupation]{.underline}**]{.mark} [intended to
force Southern prices back down]{.underline}. [[The recent coup
in]{.underline} **[Bolivia]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [backed by the U.S.
with its rising appetite for cheap lithium, offers hints of what might
come]{.underline}. And it is clear that the [Biden]{.underline}
administration, just as under Trump before him , [is]{.underline}
already [preparing the grounds for aggression against
China]{.underline}, among other things [to constrain China's domestic
demand for resources]{.underline}. Imperialist interventions that
cheapen the supply price would allow capitalists in the global North to
maintain accumulation and sustain their truce with the working classes
of the core for a little while longer, even as the world crumbles around
them.

[If left to itself, this is how the capitalist story will play out in
the 21st century]{.underline}[: **[neoliberal austerity]{.underline}**,
**[white supremacist ideology]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[violent imperialist interventions]{.underline}**---]{.mark}**[all
[for the sake of maintaining growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** and capital
accumulation **[in the core]{.underline}**. [Indeed, this]{.underline}
barbarism [is already well underway]{.underline}. [Liberal
politicians]{.underline} denounce the barbarism at every opportunity,
and yet they [cannot bring themselves to address its underlying causes
because they remain fundamentally committed to capitalist
growth]{.underline}. The solution that the liberals offer---capital
accumulation without barbarism--- is a chimera.

### Extinction

#### Capitalism causes extinction. [Climate]{.underline} change, endless [militarism]{.underline}, and [pandemics]{.underline} doom humanity.

Environmental Destruction, and Militarism." Dying for Capitalism: How
Big Money Fuels Extinction and What We Can Do About It, Chapter

[[The idea of]{.mark} a **[global extinction]{.mark} triangle** [linking
**capitalism**]{.mark}, **environmental destruction**]{.underline}
([including [**climate change**, **pandemics**, and **biodiversity
collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline}[), [and
**militarism**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([especially **nuclear
war)**]{.underline} will be viewed [in many **nations**, and especially
the United States]{.underline}, as itself madness. It is so taboo that
most [**analysts** of **climate crisis**, **pandemics** such as
**COVID-19**, and **nuclear war**]{.underline} -- [and]{.underline}
indeed [much of the **climate** and **peace**
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[avoid]{.mark} the **subject** of
the **capitalist system** and [the need for **systemic
transformation**]{.mark}]{.underline} like the plague.

To take just climate, the notion that the capitalist system drives
climate change is highlighted by only a few leading analysts, mainly on
the Left. One is Naomi Klein, who argues that extinction arises from
"the collision between capitalism and the planet" and that:

> [We have not **done**]{.underline} the [[things]{.underline}]{.mark}
> that are [[necessary to lower **emissions**]{.mark} because those
> things **fundamentally [conflict]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **deregulated
> [capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the reigning ideology for the
> entire period we have been struggling to find a way out of this
> crisis. [We are **stuck** because the [actions]{.mark} that would give
> us the **best chance** of averting **catastrophe**]{.underline} -- and
> would benefit the vast majority -- [[are]{.mark} **extremely
> [threatening]{.mark}** [to a]{.mark}n **elite [minority]{.mark}**
> []{.mark}that has a **stranglehold**]{.underline} over our economy,
> our political process, and most of our major media outlets.2

Klein acknowledges that "autocratic industrial socialism" can also cause
climate change, but argues that [the ruling **capitalist m**odel is the
**major risk** and [we need]{.mark} to pursue a **[democratic]{.mark}
"eco-[socialism]{.mark}**" to save the planet]{.underline}.

Joining Klein in the laser-like but lonely focus on the capitalist DNA
driving extinction is the journalist, George Monbiot. He writes that:

> Ecologically, economically and politically, capitalism is failing as
> catastrophically as communism failed. Like state communism, it is
> beset by unacknowledged but fatal contradictions. It is inherently
> corrupt and corrupting. But its mesmerising power, and the vast
> infrastructure of thought that seeks to justify it, makes any
> challenge to the model almost impossible to contemplate. Even to
> acknowledge the emergencies it causes, let alone to act on them, feels
> like electoral suicide. As the famous saying goes: "It is easier to
> imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism."
> Our urgent task is to turn this the other way round.3

Monbiot is not joking when he says our most important task is to "turn
this the other way round." While this sounds daunting, imagining
systemic change in the global capitalist economy has become essential to
human survival. In a period when there is a new awakening about
"systemic racism," we need now to expand our consciousness about our
economy, recognizing that we are now living in a new stage of
"extinction capitalism." Only systemic change in our political economy
can save us.

Klein is Canadian and Monbiot is British. These are both societies where
it has long been possible to offer critiques of capitalism without
sounding like a crackpot. Both Britain and Canada have labor or
socialist parties, and mainstreamed the idea that large parts of the
society should be separated from profitmaking and organized for the
provision of public goods. These societies are less complicit than the
United States in climate and military policies fueling extinction.

In the United States, mainstream socialist political parties do not
exist, and "big government" and universal welfare programs are seen as
enemies of liberty, with the exception of an enormous military. Klein
and Monbiot have an audience in the United States, but their views that
to survive means moving beyond capitalism and especially neoliberalism
capitalism runs into huge hurdles, especially in American political
discourse, even among liberals. However, we shall see that it is not an
impossible dream, and that even a President as moderate as Joe Biden,
pushed by people of color, young people, and social movements, has begun
to break with neoliberalism and shift toward a public goods economy that
could help save the planet.

Extinction denialism has limited public awareness of the new stage that
arose in the late 1940s but is rooted in the foundations of our economic
system. Indeed, **[capitalism]{.underline}**, even as it [**historically
helped** build new economic **growth** and innovation]{.underline} and
pulled millions out of poverty, has always created war and environmental
destruction. [Its **historical progress** fueled
"**development**]{.underline}" that catapulted the European and American
world [toward **prosperity**]{.underline} and material well-being for
two centuries. [But that **huge leap**]{.underline} forward also
[**froze** into society an **unsustainable quest** for **unfettered
growth** threatening **military** and **environmental
catastrophe**]{.underline} and externalized multiple costs onto the
peoples of the Global South. The history of capitalist successes
disguised latent crises now surfacing in the extinction stage. The
historical benefits of capitalism have not disappeared, but their
relative value has declined compared to the costs and risks --
ultimately of extinction.

The Triangle of Extinction: Mad Money

To save humanity and all life on the planet, we need to understand the
new extinction stage as rooted in a causal triangle of three intertwined
threats. The only way that humanity will survive is if the world --
including all states, peoples, and social movements -- come together to
dismantle the triangle and create a new circle of sustainable life
systems.

[Capitalism]{.underline} drives the triangle of extinction. Its very
nature, as a system, [foments **militarism** and drives **environmental
destruction**]{.underline}. In Chapter 2, we argue that capitalism's
constant need to expand both its resource base and its markets fosters a
militarism to pry open markets and "protect" investments. Territorial
expansion across national borders has a corollary in the capitalist
dynamic to test and break ecological thresholds, producing the third
corner of the triangle, environmental destruction.

However, these two corners -- [**militarism** and **environmental
destruction**]{.underline} also [feed back into]{.underline}, affect,
and reinforce [the logic of capitalism. Both create the
**[disasters]{.mark}** that [leave **communities**]{.mark} and
**states** [turning to **capitalists**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}for
solutions. The **[[soil]{.mark} fertility
[depletion]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for example, [that **capitalist
agriculture** produces, [leaves us]{.mark} all more [**dependent**
on]{.mark} the **petrochemical** and **agro-industrial** corporations
selling **[fertilizers]{.mark}** and **pesticides**]{.underline}.
Similarly, [[capitalism's]{.mark} **inherent
[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly in the American case,
[[produces]{.mark} a "[**military Keynesianism**," using **state
spending**]{.mark} to increase **production** and
**profits**]{.underline} of military companies. [This, in turn,
compromises **democracy**, giving **weapons contractors** privileged
**access to the state**, rendering the latter **dependent** on the
"**market" fortunes**]{.underline} of these corporations (Figure 1.1).

As we contemplate this triangle, we must recognize that its dynamics
play out in social and historical structures that are profoundly
intersectional, ones characterized at the global, regional, and national
levels by evolving hierarchies including those of race, gender, class,
and states. A more complete picture of the triangle therefore looks like
this (Figure 1.2).

This second diagram spells out the variety of forms of environmental
destruction and militarism that create existential and extinction
threats, whether they be, in Bostrom's terms, forms of bang, crunch,
shriek, or whimper risks. In both pictures, we are adhering to the idea
that existential threats -- and extinction itself -- should not be
defined exclusively as total annihilation.

The second picture shows that [there are [several]{.mark} **major
[existential risks]{.mark}**; among the risks in]{.underline} the
[**environmental destruction** corner are]{.underline} three well-known
ones, [[**climate change**, **pandemics**, and **biodiversity**]{.mark}
loss]{.underline}. But these interact with the others listed, as well as
with the many other risks that are less well known. Similarly,
[militarism produces [**nuclear**, **biological**/**chemical**, and
**cyberwar** risks]{.mark}]{.underline}. [All of these]{.underline} six
varieties of existential risk are extremely important, and all [are
"systemic]{.underline}" in that they are partly caused and fueled by the
United States and global capitalist system. [All deserve
urgent]{.underline} study leading to [emergency transformative
change]{.underline} because each of them could create devastating mass
death from which humanity might not be able to recover. In addition to
these six existential risks, the clusters around each corner of the
second diagram also name other risks that may escalate into either
existential risks or radically re- duce the quality of life and pose
civilizational risks.

In this book, mainly to keep the book shorter, we do not analyze
biodiversity collapse, cyber war, or biological war, focusing instead on
nuclear war, climate change, and pandemics. If we were to write a second
volume, we would analyze with the same sense of urgency the other three
incredibly dangerous threats; they are growing and increasingly
intertwined with the threats we focus on here.

The arrows in the diagrams reflect causation. Capitalism itself creates
a threat of extinction, independent of environmental death and war. But
it also causes and fuels the environmental threats of climate change,
pandemics, and loss of biodiversity, which multiply the extinction
threat. And [capitalism]{.underline}, [especially the **militarized
hegemonic form**]{.underline} modeled by US neoliberal capitalism,
causes war, which [further **multiplies** the extinction threat embedded
in the **possibility** of nuclear war. Climate change, pandemics, and
extreme war could arise from other systems than capitalism, but
[**capitalism** is a **leading cause**]{.mark} and accelerator [of
all]{.mark} these **[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which in turn
intensify the extinction dangers of each other. [Climate change is a
**major driver** of war]{.underline} and war has become a leading cause
of climate change. [Scholarship on **climate change** and]{.underline}
broader **[environmental matters]{.underline}** typically [recognize
several major **tipping points** and environmental thresholds beyond
which **abrupt** and **catastrophic outcomes** are to be
**expected**]{.underline}. While we do explore these in depth, we
consider these important aspects of the three corners of the triangle of
extinction.5

Let us step back and [consider]{.underline} again [the]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}** [situation]{.underline} sketched in Chapter 3.
[It]{.underline} was [[explain]{.mark}ed that [the]{.mark} increasingly
[serious range of problems, including]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[environmental destruction]{.underline}**, **[resource
depletion]{.underline}**, **[deprivation]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the
Third World]{.underline}, [**[conflict]{.underline}**
[over]{.underline}]{.mark} [access to]{.underline}
[**[resources]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[markets]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [deterioration
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[social cohesion]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [are
direct consequences of]{.underline} the fact that there is far [too
much]{.underline} **[producing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[consuming]{.underline}** going on. The main argument in this chapter
is that this society is not capable of dealing with this situation, and
that it will inevitably culminate in the more or less catastrophic
breakdown of society on a global scale.

Before detailing that argument some aspects of the trajectory should be
considered further.

What will happen?

Following is an attempt to sketch the most likely trajectory ahead.

The multi-factored [[limits]{.mark} to growth]{.underline} noose
[[will]{.underline} **[tighten]{.underline}**]{.mark}, hopefully slowly
but probably [too [quickly]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many of [its elements
are **already**]{.underline} gathering force and
**[compounding]{.underline}** [to increase difficulties]{.underline}
towards a time of great and terminal troubles. As explained, the key
determinants of our near-term fate seem to be the future of fracking and
of debt. [Most likely is a]{.underline} relatively
**[sudden]{.underline}** [end of the]{.underline} debt fuelled
[tight-oil venture which]{.underline} then [[trigger]{.mark}s
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[global debt crisis]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and a]{.underline} far more **[serious]{.underline}** [global economic
collapse]{.underline} than the 2008-2009 GFC. There are varied
expectations regarding the time scale; Ahmed (2017) explains why it
could be a matter of a decade or so before the Middle Eastern failed
states become unable to maintain oil exports. Tverberg and several
others have a similarly short-term expectation. Randers (2012) however
expects the disruption to impact around 2070.

Immiseration.

But the most important determinant of our fate is probably not directly
to do with biophysical limits. It is the [extent to which]{.underline}
the **[long-suffering]{.underline}** and docile masses [will go
on]{.underline} **[tolerating]{.underline}** [how they are being
treated]{.underline}. For at least 6,000 years people have been
astoundingly passive, putting up with tyrants, kings, and general rule
by usually brutal and greedy elites. But over the last two or three
decades [people]{.underline} in rich countries [have become]{.underline}
**[seriously discontented]{.underline}** [with their situation,
recognising]{.underline} that [governments do not attend to their
needs]{.underline}. One [[result is]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[worldwide decline]{.underline}]{.mark}** in belief [[in
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Others are the [advent
of]{.mark}]{.underline} Trump, Brexit, [**[right-wing
populism]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [support
for]{.underline} **[[fascism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Guy Standing
analyses this well (2012), pointing to the way financialisation is
replacing Neoliberalism with domination by the accumulation of assets on
which rents can be drawn while casting more and more people into the
"precariat". This is a class struggling with insecurity and personal
debt. The hard-won achievements of old labour, secure jobs and good
wages etc., are being swept away and replaced by "gig" economies in
which the precariat suffers high indebtedness and struggles to find
intermittent work, pays high rents (e.g., for mortgages, accommodation,
student fees.) Below them is the "lumpenproletariat" of chronically
unemployed, aged, infirm, homeless and excluded. The above chapter on
the US points to the Walmart-gutted towns, impoverished casual labour,
rural poverty and dying country towns, and the social wreckage
generating the opioid crisis and other harmful effects. It is not
surprising that this produced such support for a Presidential candidate
promising to "drain the Washington swamp" seen to be responsible for the
situation.

The decline in regard for democracy that is underway is another
consequence of immiseration. [People are becoming]{.underline} **[less
satisfied]{.underline}** [with the capacity or willingness]{.underline}
of the system [to attend to]{.underline} their [problems and fix
things]{.underline}. The Australian National University's recent
Australian election survey shows distrust of politicians rose from an
already high 63% in 2014 to 76% in 2016. Another question found 56%
think the federal government is run for a few big interests. (Yeginsu,
2018.)

Tverberg (2021) sees how low disposable household income is now a major
determinant of what is happening to the oil industry. The [crisis
of]{.underline} **[low prices]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[rampant bankruptcies]{.underline}** in the petroleum industry
[has]{.underline} not [been due to]{.underline} running into scarcity as
the "peak oil" thesis once predicted, but to **[falling]{.underline}**
[demand because large and increasing numbers of [people cannot
afford]{.mark} to purchase [goods]{.mark} at previous
rates]{.underline}. This is a most important and somewhat overlooked
causal factor in the discussion of global economic woes. Consider the
following evidence on it.

There has been negligible increase in household disposable income for
60-80% of Australian households since 2012, while prices have risen and
the income of the rich has risen considerably. Similarly in the US real
incomes for most workers have barely risen in 40 years and the minimum
wage has been at \$US15,000 p.a. for years. (Hutchins 2018.) Stasse
(2020) refers to literature on "...an unprecedented squeeze on living
standards for ordinary households." Wright (2019) says that in the US
"...average hourly pay is below what it was in 1973; 40 percent of
adults lack the savings to pay for a \$400 emergency expense."

The [shrinking]{.underline} **[middle]{.underline}** [class and
rising]{.underline} **[precariat]{.underline}** [class are part of the
phenomenon, and it is]{.underline} **[evident]{.underline}** [in the
rise of household debt]{.underline}, now very high in Australia. Karp
(2020) says in the US households' debt-to-income ratio was less than 40
percent in 1950 but is now120 percent, and since 1985 the wealth share
of the bottom 90 percent of adults declined from 40 percent to 27
percent. Indices of increasing hardship at the bottom are clear. In the
UK. MacFarlane (2019) reports, "Rough sleeping in England has increased
by 165 per cent, while homeless deaths have more than doubled. The
number of people using food banks has increased to 1.6 million ... up
from just 26,000 in 2009. 14 million people are living in poverty ...
the UK population is still 1.6 per cent poorer than it was more than a
decade ago on average." Menadue (2020) reports that in Australia,
"[Homelessness is]{.underline} also **[increasingly
significant]{.underline}**ly. It rose by 30% in the decade to 2016."

These [observations point to a]{.underline} **[killing of the
goose]{.underline}** [that was laying golden eggs, a failure to attend
to the way the drive to extract]{.underline} as much wealth as possible
eventually **[undercuts]{.underline}** [the capacity to go on siphoning
it out]{.underline}, by [leaving most people with]{.underline} **[too
little]{.underline}** [purchasing power]{.underline}. This situation is
a consequence of the success of the capitalist class. Their dominance
has meant that they have been able to ride over the resistance that
might have got them to make sufficient concessions to defuse the
problems they were causing. Streek (2014) puts it in terms of
[capitalism becoming its]{.underline} **[own worst enemy]{.underline}**.
"[It has]{.underline} **[eliminated]{.underline}** criticism and
[oppositional moves, which would have pushed it to]{.underline}
**[adapt]{.underline}**..."

The [accumulating power]{.underline} has also [led to]{.underline}
[**[corruption]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline}]{.mark} in time
[[reduces]{.mark} a system's [capacity to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[respond]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to challenges]{.underline}. Streek
(2014) points to the way the GFC revealed "...rating agencies being paid
by the producers of toxic securities to award them top grades; offshore
shadow banking, money laundering and assistance in large-scale tax
evasion as the normal business of the biggest banks with the best
addresses; the sale to unsuspecting customers of securities constructed
so that other customers could bet against them; the leading banks
worldwide fraudulently fixing interest rates and the gold price, and so
on." He notes the billions of dollars in fines for these offences which
several large banks have had to pay recently, including by some major
Australian banks. In more recent years several inquiries and revelations
have detailed similar criminal behaviour on the part of mainstream
institutions, especially via the Australian Banking royal commission,
and exposures of global tax haven and laundering operations.

The advent of cannibalism.

Collins (2021) and others point to the way the economy's increasing
difficulties have led it to enter a "catabolic" or "cannibalistic"
phase. [As]{.underline} the [capacity to do good business]{.underline}
producing useful things **[deteriorates]{.underline}**,
[[investors]{.mark} turn to activities that]{.underline}
[**[plunder]{.underline}** [the economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is as
if a hardware firm has to start selling the corrugated iron on its own
roof to stay in business. The illicit drug industry and the Mafia are
similar; [rather than producing]{.underline} **[new
wealth]{.underline}** [effort goes into]{.underline}
**[extracting]{.underline}** previously [produced wealth]{.underline}.
Much [financial activity]{.underline} is of this nature, [[such
as]{.underline} "**[short selling]{.underline}**", "**[asset
stripping]{.underline}**" [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [getting
[hold]{.mark} of assets that enable]{.underline}
[**[rents]{.underline}** [to be extracted]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the
GFC a lot of money was lent to home buyers incapable of meeting the
payments, because investors could not find less risky outlets. When the
borrowers could not pay their interest instalments their houses were
repossessed by the banks and sold off.

Similarly in the US some of the money in the worker's pay packet is put
into a [pension fund run]{.underline} **[by the
corporation]{.underline}**, [to be paid back on retirement, but many
corporations have taken these funds to]{.underline}
**[invest]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} "**[lost]{.underline}**"
[them]{.underline}. Often [they were]{.underline} lent to smart
operators in the financial sector to put into speculative ventures,
**[siphoning out]{.underline}** [fees in the process]{.underline}.
Sometimes money is borrowed to buy weak firms, arrange for them to
borrow too much and thus drive them into bankruptcy, and then sell them
off, and because the pension money has become an asset of the firm it
goes to the lenders and is lost to the workers who earned it and set it
aside. So, accumulation and profit making are being kept up by
activities which enrich big and smart investors (lenders) by getting
hold of the wealth of little/naive investors (borrowers), through
granting them loans they cannot repay.

Another [common mechanism is]{.underline} simply
[**[commercialising]{.underline}** [activities]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[the state once carried out]{.mark} without charge]{.underline}. This
is an aspect of "financialisation" discussed in Chapter 4. A good
example is where [students must now]{.underline} **[pay]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} college and university [education]{.underline},
meaning large loans must be taken out and large interest payments then
flow to lenders from the earnings of parents and students. Again the
process does not involve lending to produce anything, it just enables
wealth previously produced to be acquired by lenders. Collins (2021) and
others [see this process]{.underline} **[accelerating]{.underline}** [as
the ever-increasing volumes of accumulated capital find it]{.underline}
**[increasingly difficult]{.underline}** [to find investment
opportunities]{.underline} in producing anything of value. Streek (2014)
says, "... [the struggle for]{.underline} the last
**[remaining]{.underline}** [profit opportunities is
becoming]{.underline} **[uglier]{.underline}** [by the
day]{.underline}."

Collins (2021) says. "... catabolic capitalists will stoke the profit
engine by taking over troubled businesses, selling them off for parts,
firing the workforce, and pilfering their pensions." As difficulties
increase for governments and their revenues decrease they will come
under greater pressure to give business the conditions it wants in order
to stimulate economic activity.

End game.

A number of [analysts see the]{.underline} foregoing [phenomena as
aspects of a]{.underline} **[terminal decline]{.underline}**, partly
[driven by increasing]{.underline} **[resource]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[ecological]{.underline}**
[difficulties]{.underline}, partly [by worsening]{.underline}
**[inequality]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
"**[immiseration]{.underline}**", and partly by deteriorating
"legitimacy". Rising discontent in Europe and the US is evident in
support for populist and fascist movements. Blame is usually put on the
**[wrong]{.underline}** [targets, especially]{.underline}
**[immigrants]{.underline}**. That the squalor is due to capitalism is
not recognised, thanks largely to the weakness of Left parties and the
fine work done over generations by those keeping capitalist ideology in
good shape.

In my lectures on Marx I point to a list of things which I and others
think he got wrong. But there are some extremely important things I
think he got right. One is that capitalism is shot through with serious
contradictions such as the fact that the interests of workers clash with
those of the class that owns capital. Another extremely important point
he made is that as the system matures immiseration will eventually
increase. This is what we are seeing now (Marx's timing was way out.) As
the rich and super-rich cream off increasing proportions of wealth the
masses are increasingly having to struggle to get by, and are therefore
less able to keep up the purchasing that is the life-blood of the
system. And they are more and more discontented. Most importantly, he
saw that these tendencies would result in the system's self-destruction.

The question is, when will people finally cease putting up with what the
system does to them? When will they realise that the system is not
designed to work for them? When will they see that it cannot but worsen
their situation as time goes by? When will they realise what is causing
their plight?

The [tightening [limits]{.mark} will]{.underline}
**[[intensify]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [immiseration]{.mark} as
[governments]{.mark} are forced to]{.underline} [**[cut
spending]{.underline}** [on welfare]{.underline}]{.mark} [etc.
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[drive worker's conditions]{.underline}
**[down]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [give more favours to
the rich]{.underline} in order to get the economy going.
[Governments]{.underline} struggling to control dissent and to help
capital [are]{.underline} **[very [likely]{.mark} to [adopt fascist
options]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but unlike in the 1930s, now the
materials necessary to maintain armies, large bureaucracies and secret
police and stage mass rallies will not be available, so [descent towards
a]{.underline} **[warlord dominated]{.underline}** [feudalism becomes
plausible]{.underline}. In some Third World regions and even US cities
this seems to be happening, for instance in the form of drug gangs.

Many analysts have tried to draw attention to where these limits are
taking us. Mason (2003) for instance sees the many problematic trends
culminating in "The 2030 Spike", the title of his book. As noted above,
among those who discuss [the]{.underline}
**[multi-dimensional]{.underline}** [global breakdown likely to be
brought on before long by limits and scarcity]{.underline} are Korowicz
(2012), Morgan (2013), Kunstler (2005), Greer (2005), Bardi (2011),
Duncan (2013), Gilding (2011), Randers (2012) and Streeck (2014). Some
[[foresee]{.underline}]{.mark} more or less **[totally
[catastrophic]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark},
the end of Western civilisation, [[with a]{.underline} **[die-off of
billions]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

The next collapse might not be the final one; some foresee "\... a long
and bumpy road down". Randers (2012) expects the time of troubles to be
around 2070. However, Ahmed (2017), Tverberg (2021), Mason (2003) and
other "collapsologists" [give reasons to expect it to be]{.underline}
**[[before 2030]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The hope must be for a
protracted Goldilocks depression, one that is not so severe as to
destroy the chances of salvage, but savage enough to jolt people into
recognizing that they must shift to the local, cooperative and frugal
self-sufficiency detailed in Chapter 10.

The [situation will]{.underline} at best [be]{.underline}
**[confused]{.underline}** and **[chaotic]{.underline}**, [with
governments and "leaders" continuing to not understand the fundamental
causes and quick to blame the wrong things]{.underline}. The present
[[tendencies to]{.underline}]{.mark} **[right-wing
[populism]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[fascism]{.underline}** are [likely to gain momentum, [supported
by]{.mark}]{.underline} many in [**[privileged]{.underline}**
[classes]{.underline}]{.mark} [who]{.underline} will [[call
for]{.underline} **[repressive]{.underline}**
[measures]{.underline}]{.mark} [to restore order and protect their
security and property]{.underline}. Many in angry lower classes will
want strong leaders willing to break rules. (A recent survey found this
to already be true of a majority of UK people; Walker, 2019.)
[Capitalism will]{.underline} again [morph into its]{.underline}
**[fascist form]{.underline}** [whereby an authoritarian]{.underline}
central [government rules]{.underline} in cooperation with a selected
few big capitalist firms. It is highly unlikely that there will be
sober, clear headed rational thinking about causes and solutions. Poor
and struggling governments will be even less capable of analysing or
dealing with the situation effectively than they are now.

The international possibilities are similarly disturbing. [Dominant
[powers]{.mark} will]{.underline} surely [[be]{.mark}come]{.underline}
**[[more aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in]{.underline} their
[efforts [to control]{.mark} sources of [scarce resources and
markets]{.mark}]{.underline}. Third world [governments wallowing in debt
are likely to allow]{.underline} corporations to cause
**[greater]{.underline}** [environmental destruction]{.underline} and to
generate revenue, and to resort to increasingly repressive measures to
control dissent over deteriorating living conditions. (Ahmed, 2017).

The problems cannot be solved.

The conventional assumption is that the problems can and will be solved
by the institutions and processes of present society, such as by
parliaments implementing effective policies in line with international
agreements and resolutions, and ordinary people accepting legislated
adjustments to their circumstances. But from the perspective of The
Simpler Way, this expectation is now clearly mistaken. Given the
foregoing account of the nature and magnitude of the problems, the
institutions and political process of this society are not capable of
recognising the situation and rationally facing up to it and making the
enormous and difficult changes required to solve it. Consider the
following reasons.

The enormity of the changes required.

Even the Degrowth literature generally fails to adequately represent the
magnitude and difficulty of the reductions required. (Again, for the
numerical case see Trainer, 2021a). Chapter 3 explained that rich-world
volumes of production and thus consumption of resources must be cut by
up to 90%, meaning that most of the present quantities of industry,
transport, travel, construction, shopping, exporting, investing etc.
have to be phased out. How could this possibly be done? This is the
"degrowth conundrum". It cannot be a matter of just closing a coal mine
and transferring the workers to other jobs, because the amounts of
production, work and jobs have to be cut dramatically. It would have to
involve the creation and massive implementation of totally new social
structures and procedures, whereby most people could live well without
producing anywhere near so much as before. This could not be done unless
it involved historically totally unprecedented, massive and rapid
cultural change, to widespread public understanding and acceptance of
the extremely radically new systems and values. And governments cannot
impose or make the new ways work. Chapter 10 will make it clear that
this could only be done by conscientious citizens who are eager to build
and operate the new local systems.

There isn't time

Even if the understanding and the will existed, it is difficult to
imagine that the enormous required could be carried out in a few
decades. They involve reversing what have been some of the fundamental
ideas and values that have driven Western civilization over the last two
hundred years, and scrapping and replacing vast systems and structures.
Yet it is probable that the following three main global threats each
give us no more than ten years.

Carbon.

According to various estimates the "carbon emissions budget" associated
with a 67% chance of limiting temperature rise to under 1.5 degrees will
have been exhausted within about twelve years. (Levin, 2018, Steffen,
2020.) Many insist that this one-in-three chance of failure is far too
high to be acceptable. A more responsible target would significantly
reduce the budget, and therefore the time left to move off fossil fuels.
Note also that these estimates do not take into account the positive
feedbacks, such as warming causing loss of snow causing absorption of
more solar heat. Currently there are around 490 new coal-fired power
stations being built around the world, with 790 planned. (Global Energy
Monitor, 2020.)

By 2050 energy demand is likely to be around 890 EJ/y, 56% higher than
at present. (Minqui, 2019.) Input from renewable sources would have to
increase by 27 EJ every year but the current rate of increase is only
0.72 EJ/y. (Our World in Data, 2019.) This equates to building 1.5
million 2 MW wind turbines every year, costing over 6% of world GDP not
including the cost of energy storage, grid strengthening and
distribution. And plant built now will probably only last twenty years,
less than half as long as coal-fired plant. There will be at least
formidable difficulties in developing satisfactory renewable energy
solutions for emissions from the 80% of demand made up by the heavy land
transport, agriculture, military, shipping and aircraft sectors.
(Trainer, 2017.) These numbers would seem to completely rule out any
possibility that acceptable emissions targets can be met in the time
available.

Petroleum.

It is likely that a major and permanent collapse in oil availability
will occur, possibly within a decade. (Ahmed, 2017.) It is generally
recognized that the supply of conventional petroleum peaked around 2005
and has declined significantly since then. World supply has continued to
increase due to the remarkable rise in output from the advent of
"fracking" in the US "tight-oil" regions. However, there are strong
reasons for expecting this source to peak and decline soon. (Hughes
2016, Cunningham 2019, Whipple 2019, Cobb, 2019.) T0 2020 the major
producers have not made a profit in any year of operation while
accumulating a debt of over one quarter of a trillion dollars. It seems
that an oil price high enough for producers to break even is too high
for the economy to avoid recession. Unless there are major technical
breakthroughs reducing costs, which are not thought to be likely, at
some point in the near future lenders will probably cease providing
capital to the fracking sector. A major factor increasing costs is the
decline in the energy return on the energy that has to be invested to
produce energy.

There is a strong case that it will either not be possible for renewable
energy sources to replace fossil fuels or that it will be too expensive.
(Trainer, 2017.) As noted above, only 20% of demand is in the form of
electricity, which is the easiest task. It will be much more costly to
run heavy trucks, farm tractors, mining equipment, ships and aircraft on
renewables.

Ahmed (2017) presents a persuasive case that most Middle East
oil-producing nations are encountering such serious ecological, food,
water, population growth and climate problems that their capacity to
export oil could be largely eliminated within ten years. Meanwhile the
amount of energy it takes to produce a barrel of oil is increasing
significantly (Brockway, et al., 2019). Despite these alarming
observations the precariousness and urgency of the petroleum situation
is attracting little attention.

Debt.

After remaining more or less stable for decades, [[global debt]{.mark}
has]{.underline} **[quadrupled]{.underline}** since 1999. (Hienberg,
2018.) [It is now]{.underline} equivalent to around **[three
times]{.underline}** [global GDP]{.underline}, is far higher than before

Existing political institutions are not capable of making changes of the
magnitude required.

Our institutions are reasonably good at making small changes. Elections
are usually won by small margins and therefore governments cannot afford
to irritate significant numbers of voters or they will be thrown out.
But they cannot adopt policies that go against the vital interests of
significant sectors.

This situation is partly a consequence of the self-interested,
competitive, individualistic ethos built into present cultural and
political systems. Burdens are not shared fairly or appropriately but
are typically left to groups least able to avoid them. Because dealing
with the global predicament effectively would be seen to involve painful
adjustments on a massive scale people would be acutely sensitive to
perceived inequities in the changes they were called upon to make.
Fierce resistance, disputes and appeals would surely proliferate over
the new options presented, the changes in locations, and especially the
dramatically reduced levels of income, purchasing and consumption.
Authoritarian governments can force big changes through but current
democracies are much less able to.

The problems interact, compound and positively feedback.

Often solving one problem increases difficulties in other areas,
especially by increasing energy demand. More importantly,
[[problems]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[have]{.underline}
**[multiplicative]{.underline}** [interactive
effects]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, Ahmed's
[analysis]{.underline} of Middle Eastern oil producers [shows
how]{.underline} **[climate change]{.underline}**,
**[drought]{.underline}**, **[rising
temp]{.underline}**erature**[s]{.underline}**, **[soil
loss]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[rapid population
growth]{.underline}** [are [combining to generate intractable
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} for governments.
[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[capacity]{.mark} to cope]{.underline}
[**[declines]{.underline}** [they resort to]{.underline}
**[repression]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in an effort to contain discontent
and maintain order, [which]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[feeds

further]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[disrupting]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[productive [systems]{.mark} and capacity to cope]{.underline}.

Thus the [[difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark} now [being experienced due

#### Expansion into the arctic is driven by Capitalism--- causes power conflict

**ICT 21** (Internationalist Communist Tendency, non-profit organization
that advocates for global communism, "Ice Breaker Imperialism", Libcom,
October 21, 2021, <https://libcom.org/article/ice-breaker-imperialism>)
bw

This drive towards militarization in the Arctic theater can only be
understood when connected to the economic drive of both the great and
regional powers. [[With]{.mark} the [Arctic warming]{.mark} at twice the
rate of the rest of the globe [previously inaccessible resources]{.mark}
now [present themselves to profit-starved centres of capital.]{.mark}(5)
It is no surprise that when [Putin]{.mark} commissioned a northern naval
base he [highlighted the Arctic as a key to Russian economic
success,]{.mark} and in 2017 he cited an estimate of the mineral wealth
alone to be 30 trillion dollars[. Chinese industrialists eye]{.mark}
these [rich deposits]{.mark} of nickel, iron, lead, zinc, phosphates and
gold, while [Torontonian financiers seek]{.mark} to tighten their grip
[on global mining]{.mark}. In addition to mineral wealth vast [reserves
of]{.mark} unrecovered [natural gas and oil are located just under the
sea floor]{.mark}]{.underline}. The energy resources already in use have
converted the previously barren North into a region from which a tenth
of oil and a quarter of natural gas in the world is extracted. [The
[attraction]{.mark} to this region [is not purely for domestic economic
purposes]{.mark}. Energy, particularly oil, has long been critical to
"security" and "strategic" positioning inside the international
framework[. The relationship between capital and military adventurism
has never been more apparent]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, the real
prize in the scramble for the Arctic is control over the two northern
sea routes, the Northwest Passage on the Canadian side but particularly
the Northern Sea Route on the Russian side. Since the days of
mercantilism, the development of [[capitalism has always been
inseparable from the]{.mark} ever-expanding [networks of naval
distribution]{.mark}]{.underline}. From the South China Sea to the
Panama Canal, the arteries of economic life appear as the vast flow of
commodities atop massive freighters. Historical events like the Suez
Crisis in 1956, or recent events such as the blocking of the Suez Canal
by the Ever Given, confirm the indispensability of these passages for
world capital. The enthusiasm of the bourgeoisie to the opening of these
northern passages can be marked by the celebration of the cargo ship
Nunavik transporting nickel from Quebec to China in 2014. The voyage
took two weeks less than the traditional Panama Canal route. Coinciding
with the opening of Arctic shipping is the Canadian government's plan to
open and expand the infrastructure of deep-water Arctic ports, with new
commitments to build a port in Nunavut and expanding the infrastructure
of the port of Churchill, Manitoba. Across the pole, Russian policy is
even more determined. The building of new naval bases is always geared
toward controlling the NSR. With the first commercial ship making its
way through the NSR in 2018, it can be estimated that the utilization of
the NSR would lead to a reduction of days at sea by 40 percent in
contrast to the traditional route through the Suez Canal. With 7,000
miles of Arctic coast Russia understands it is well positioned
geographically to dominate what it hopes will rival the Suez Canal in
connecting European and Asian markets. The Russian strategy is based on
its ability to ferry cargo though the NSR with its modern fleet of
nuclear powered icebreakers--with a fee of course. [[Putin has
remarked]{.mark} that Russian [dominance in the Arctic is key to
Russia's economic and strategic future]{.mark}. In response to Russian
plans in 2020 the United States sailed a fleet of four destroyers with
anti-submarine equipment though the Barents Sea. Future maneuvers are
prepared to increase the number of destroyers from four to six. The
message is clear, [America wishes the]{.mark} northern routes to be
"economic free zones" and "international waters", while in real terms
[waterways would be under American power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
With the opening of the two northern routes China was quick to declare
itself a "near Arctic country" and has entered the competition to push
its interests by proclaiming a "polar silk road". The polar silk road is
attached to China's massive Belt and Road Initiative which seeks to
institute massive infrastructure projects throughout Asia, Africa and
Europe to greater tie the world economy to Chinese capital and openly
challenge American capital. Knowing that the NSR through the Russian
northern coast offers the shortest route from China to Europe, in 2017
China's state-owned shipping giant COSCO has proposed the development of
an Arctic deep-water port on the Northern Dvina River near the northern
Russian city of Archangelsk. Next to this are Chinese proposals to
develop bridges and railroads in Norway and Finland. Even earlier there
was Chinese interest in buying the Canadian Arctic port in Churchill, an
offer which was clearly rejected as the Canadian press in 2020 proudly
boasted that the port was 100 percent Canadian-owned. [The [American
response to the Chinese initiative]{.mark} in the Arctic [is exemplified
by]{.mark} former president Donald [Trump floating the possibility of
purchasing Greenland]{.mark} from Denmark, where China has invested in
rare-minerals.]{.underline} While the purchase offer for Greenland was
rejected by the Danish government, the Danes did accept a \$12.1 million
economic aid package for Greenland, "aimed at strengthening mutual ties
and boosting a renewed U.S. push for a greater military presence in the
Arctic."(6) The point is clear: The number one priority of the U.S. is
to stop the expansion of Chinese capital at all costs, and to achieve
this through preparation for future military confrontation.

Old colonialisms and the new: legacies, continuities and further issues

[While contemporary projects of [economic development in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} have reached new scales and exploit new
resource frontiers, they [are [closely related]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
continuity of]{.underline} '[**old'** **[Arctic]{.mark}
[colonialisms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In their development, the
perpetuation of the settler-colonial logic of capitalist economic
development coupled with reasons of the Euro-American polities that
claim the Arctic as part of their territory constitute the basis of
'Arctic geopolitics'. [Another new element is the [growing
importance]{.mark} of the Arctic [as]{.mark} [a **geopolitical
hotspot**]{.mark} in world politics]{.underline}. While [economic
reasons are an **important driver**]{.underline} [for **territorial
reorganizations** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}, national security and
defence issues also play an important part in such processes. The
reorganization of military structures and the redefinition of military
strategies and objectives in the Arctic -- seen in Russia, in the US and
Canada, encompassing all of the Inuit homeland -- points to a tendency
of increased control being exercised over hyperborean spaces by States.

[The [**emergence** of]{.mark} neo-**[extractivist capitalist
development]{.mark}**]{.underline}21) [might be the defining feature of
**emerging Arctic colonialisms**]{.underline}. [**Neo-extractivist**
**capital accumulation** is]{.underline} [[characterized by
**pressure**]{.mark} [over **natural resources**]{.mark} and the [demand
for greater]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**capitalist control** over
**space**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[reinforcing a **relationship** between
**humanity** and]{.mark} **[nature based]{.mark}** [on the **economic
value**]{.mark} [of **land** and **natural
resources**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [While colonial]{.underline}
[projects]{.underline} attempt to [recast themselves as
necessary]{.underline} [in the face of external threats or as the
reasonable way of seizing the Arctic resource boom]{.underline}, [their
objectives are]{.underline} [similar]{.underline} [to]{.underline} those
of [old colonialisms]{.underline}: [subsume]{.underline} [indigenous
territories]{.underline} and subjectivities [under]{.underline} [[the
**logic of**]{.mark} **[capitalist accumulation]{.mark}** [and
**extending State**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and capital) [[control over
the]{.mark} [**populations** that **inhabit them**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It is possible to note that, if their scale and methods are somehow
different from eighteenth and nineteenth century colonialisms, they
still represent a continuity of the colonial project. Moreover, [the
long history of the]{.underline} [nefarious **impacts** of
**colonialism**]{.underline} and the deep disarticulation it brought to
the Inuit peoples allowed the erasure of indigenous presences [and the
emergence of '[empty]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Arctic']{.mark}
**[narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- used by both neo-extractivist
capitalism and the national-territorial State in [[**legitimizing** the
**rationale** behind such projects.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The present situation of [the world]{.mark} as we know it [is
undergoing processes of radical change]{.mark} that have had and
continue to [have disastrous consequences]{.mark} for ecosystems and
planetary life. [Entwined in a history of capitalism, colonialism and
industrialisation, humanity is facing the effects of climate]{.mark}
[change]{.mark} with rising sea levels, draught, flood and wildfires,
alongside deforestation, the loss and toxification of nature and the
mass extinction of animal populations. [In the Arctic]{.mark},
environmental [change is happening fast]{.mark}. [For]{.mark} Arctic
[Indigenous communities]{.mark}, the warming of air and sea temperatures
and resulting reduction of land and sea ice, [fish and other marine
species are disappearing]{.mark}]{.underline}, as are the habitat of
mammals such as polar bears, seals and walruses. [[This]{.mark} in turn
[affects]{.mark} the [food supply and social]{.mark} and cultural
[fabric of the]{.mark} [Indigenous communities]{.mark} that rely on
these animals]{.underline} for sustenance.\[1\] Similarly, on the
[Arctic tundra climate instability in winter cause food insecurity for
the reindeer,]{.underline} which, alongside increased pressure from
predators, reduces the herds. This again has become a threat to the
Indigenous reindeer herders' livelihood and cultural existence.\[2\]
[[Alongside]{.mark} the rapid [climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} we
are witnessing in the Arctic, various [[nations]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Canada, USA, China, Russia, and the Nordic countries) [[stake a claim
to the region to secure 'their' share in its]{.mark} natural
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline} (including Arctic fauna, oil and metals)
-- frequently to develop so-called green solutions and clean energy
(such as windmill parks and copper mines[). This move to appropriate
inhabited and living lands to harness the work of nature in projects of
development [building]{.mark} economic [wealth and]{.mark} geopolitical
[power continues the]{.mark} centuries-long [modus operandi]{.mark} of
**[capitalism]{.mark}**, colonialism and globalisation that has
conditioned large-scale human-initiated environmental change [and
**fuels the current climate crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[3\] The
foundation of human-initiated environmental change was laid with the
rise of European capitalism in the fifteenth century, which commenced a
capitalist world ecology and what Jason W. Moore terms the Age of
Capital, or Capitalocene.\[4\] Although 'Europe' and the 'West' did not
exist as a geohistorical force or geocultural formation until the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, from 1450 the European 'seats of
imperial power and centers of financial might' began large-scale,
capitalist systems of environment-making that both enabled and
'accelerated environmental transformations beyond anything known
before'.\[5\] Understood as a system of controlling environments that
bundles economic and social relations with and within nature[,
**[capitalism made]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**possible [a radical]{.mark}
[remaking of nature and human]{.mark}** relations to nature and
work**.**]{.underline}\[6\] Alongside capitalism's new forms of
production that exploited and materially changed large tracts of nature
and its webs of life, a new ideology developed that justified these
intrusions. [[Through filters of power-inequality]{.mark} relating to
class, race, nation, gender and sexuality, capitalism invented and
operated on a separation between humanity and nature. [This
Humanity/Nature divide was created]{.mark} and enacted [by the
ruling]{.mark} [class, who saw themselves as members of Humanity]{.mark}
and unquestionably [separate from Nature]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the
same time, [[they designated other people]{.mark} and other life forms
[as Nature]{.mark}.]{.underline}\[7\] [[Capitalism's]{.mark}
Human/Nature [divide]{.mark} [allowed nature, animals and humans to
become 'cheap Nature']{.mark}: an entity external to and [abstracted
from Humanity]{.mark} and [valued only in terms of its potential to
produce]{.mark} and accumulate [capital]{.mark}]{.underline} (through
unpaid labour and extraction of human, animal and natural resources) as
cheaply as possible.\[8\] Through capitalism, [[Nature came to
represent]{.mark} '[all those forms of life and labor that
provided]{.mark} useful [work, but were]{.mark} culturally and
juridically [excluded from the cash]{.mark} nexus]{.underline}' -- and
could consequently be put to work cost-free.\[9\] Because capitalist
systems of production exhausted the life-making capacities of these
appropriated relationships and forms of labor, they harbored an inherent
need for continuous expansion only colonial ventures could satisfy. As
evident in the history of European colonialism, capitalism's inscription
of Nature, allowed the utilisation of Indigenous and African peoples,
women, animals and natural entities as unvalued reproductive labour.
Central to this development was the advent of European Transatlantic
slavery and colonisation around 1450, which commenced a landscape
transformation (including deforestation and large-scale monocrop
plantation systems) unprecedented in speed, scale and scope.\[10\]
European Transatlantic slavery and colonisation further allowed a total
devaluation and commodification of human and other forms of life,
including the social relationships that maintained the system and
constituted the very conditions of life.\[11\] Appreciating both the
world-historical, capitalist contexts of environmental change in the
Arctic and the region's own patch-work colonial history, 'Patterns of
Environment-making: the Arctic and its Global contexts' invites papers
and discussions on histories of colonialism and Arctic environmental
change.\[12\] Through a postcolonial, ecofeminist and world-historical
framework, the creative and scholarly research presented and discussed
during the workshop contributes knowledge on how to better understand
and interpret the current situation of climate change in the Arctic and
its environmental, cultural and social effects. Drawing on the theory
and concept of the Capitalocene, the workshop presents papers that
centre on one or more of the three following areas: 1) the intellectual,
political and practical ways in which dominant society historically
contributed to the climate crisis, through the creation of 'cheap
nature' and radical transformations of social worlds and human relations
to other humans, animals and the environment. 2) historical instances of
Arctic Indigenous responses and resistances to Western colonialism and
capitalist world-systems and attendant ideologies of progress and
modernity, on what grounds these resistances occurred and the
alternatives they offered. 3) historical and contemporary Indigenous
voices and aesthetic expressions that present alternative perspectives,
worldviews, knowledges and experiences of human-nature relations in the
Arctic. 'Patterns of Environment-making' builds and disseminates
critical research on the historic and continuous causes and conditions
of climate and other environmental changes in the Arctic. The workshop
engages with current debates in discourse on the Anthropocene by
presenting novel humanities scholarship nuancing and challenging the
most historically simplistic and universalising explanations of
anthropogenic climate change.\[13\] Identifying and bringing out
historic and ongoing Indigenous resistance towards, and alternatives to,
the colonial and capitalist world system's exploitation and
appropriation of humans, animals and nature, the workshop further
demonstrates the ongoing relevance and need to take Indigenous
perspectives seriously and involve local communities in political
debates and decision making concerning environmental change and
sustainable development in the Arctic.

[Neither politicians (across the continuum) nor corporate media pundits
engage in meaningful public discourse on climate and the environment.
They choose not to acknowledge the scope of the threat or to sincerely
analyze real means of addressing the gathering]{.underline} onslaught.
The bogus dialogue on climate is all smoke and mirrors, feeding the
masses fatuous illusions-promising future technological triumphs-and
wielding uncertainty as a means to disarm public ire. [Our popular
discussions about the environment are almost never about capitalism
precisely because]{.underline} (in the real world, as opposed to the
world of mass fantasy) [it is always and obviously about
capitalism]{.underline}. [The wealth of information on climate available
at the click of a computer may be staggering, but only a few stilted,
corporate approved narratives leak into the popular climate
conversations featured in political debates or commercial media. Our
climate stories have been mutilated,]{.underline} distorted or subtly
degraded by the money and influence of those whose profits come from
environmental destruction. [The major political parties avoid an honest
evaluation of our environmental crises]{.underline} in the manner of a
vampire cringing before a clove of garlic. Don\'t hold your breath
waiting for Kohei Saito or Jason Hickel to be interviewed on CNN or Fox
News. Extinction Rebellion (XR) has demanded that governments tell the
truth about climate overheating, but XR might as well insist that the
cow jump over the moon. [If the U.S. government were to voice even a
timidly honest approximation of our environmental realities it would
open the floodgates of its own complicity]{.underline}. Here are some
truths that governments will never tell: There is no adequate climate
mitigation currently in practice anywhere on earth, and no plan to
initiate any. Fossil fuels are being extracted and burned at all-time
highs with no adequate regulation. [The sixth extinction is well
underway, with species die offs now proceeding at a velocity
unprecedented in geological history.]{.underline} (The Chicxulub meteor
(Alvarez Impact Theory) would have created an even more abrupt mass
extinction, however, Gerta Keller\'s rebuttal to Alvarez, compellingly
argues that Deccan Traps volcanism (and not a meteor) did in the
dinosaurs. Until the Alvarez/Keller dispute resolves into a clear
verdict, our sixth extinction ought to be awarded the interim title for
murdering life on earth swiftly.) [CO2 concentrations are increasing at
least ten times faster than during the greatest mass extinction in
earth\'s history-the \"End Permian]{.underline}.\" In 2023, atmospheric
CO2 increased by an astonishing 4.7 parts per million. Climate ruin in
the Global South will create more than a billion climate refugees in the
next few decades, driving fascist movements and increasing the risk of
famine, genocide, and war. Temperature increases as high as 5 degrees
Celsius are very possible by the end of the century if governments do
not cooperate and radically change course globally. It must be said,
they show no signs of even considering this. A 5°C rise in temperatures
transpiring over the course of a mere two centuries would make our
planet uninhabitable for human civilization as we know it. Bear in mind
that the volcanism driving all five mass extinctions of deep time (I am
giving the nod to Gerta Keller here) transpired across hundreds of
thousands of years in each instance. Capitalism can obliterate millions
of species in a geological nanosecond. Sea level rise could be as much
as seven feet by the end of the century, displacing billions of people
in coastal areas. The immediate future will feature anoxic oceans,
slowing of ocean currents, massive dead zones, bleached coral reefs, and
the cataclysmic die-off of fish. Inland, 120,000 square kilometers turn
into desert annually. A piece by Clayton Page Aldern just published in
Aeon magazine details the ways that heat impinges on neurological
functioning. We have just been sent reeling by the Covid-19 pandemic
that, uniquely among pathogens, has a propensity to diminish cognition.
Lead, the mother of all neurotoxins, is still ubiquitous in U.S. cities
thanks to austerity that prioritizes military spending and government
handouts to fossil fuel companies while gutting infrastructure spending.
Leaded gasoline, banned several decades ago, caused tens of millions of
global deaths and created a worldwide epidemic of brain damage simply
because General Motors held the patent on tetraethyl lead and blocked
the use of cheap alternatives. Many survivors of leaded gasoline,
including myself, now have the task of using our injured brains to come
up with a solution to our environmental crises. Increasingly brain
damaged people now must tackle increasingly unsolvable environmental
assaults. Factor in pesticides, plastics, mercury and a host of
agricultural contaminants that make it difficult to think straight. The
bruised remnants of our minds gravitate toward the immediate relief of
addictive substances. The biggest of all addictions in a capitalist
universe is spending and material consumption. We can\'t think about
complex issues, but we can buy stuff created by fossil fuels. With
capitalism driving humanity toward a warp speed plunge into planetary
ruin, our democratic systems have distilled the climate narrative into a
bifurcated choice between Republican psychosis and Democratic hopium.
The Republican Party environmental narrative holds that climate change
is either a complete hoax or an over-hyped inconvenience spurred by
alarmists looking for academic funding. The Democratic Party narrative
optimistically assumes that we merely need to defer to the free market
and allow green industries to build the windmills and solar panels
needed to make oil, coal, and gas obsolete. In other words, we face a
certain apocalypse armed only with surrealistic fantasies. Out of some
sort of atavistic hope, I watched the Democratic Party convention
searching for some glimmer of rational wisdom. How stupid of me!
Conventions promote empty oratory as a matter of tradition. I ought to
know by now that the soul of democracy is made out of marshmallow fluff.
There were no speeches suggesting that our politicians have been in
touch with our scientists. No one mentioned the trajectory of
atmospheric carbon, the future certainty of catastrophic weather or the
looming extinction of myriads of species, including humanity. Hillary
Clinton and Michelle Obama did not mention climate-even in passing. A
couple of millennia ago, Nero allegedly \"fiddled while Rome burned,\"
and we still do not forgive him. Thousands of years in the future no one
will be alive to hold our orchestra members accountable. For the record,
Bernie Sanders did state that nothing in the Democratic Party platform
is radical but \"allowing polluters to destroy the planet\" (he was
talking about Republicans) is radical. Alexandra Ocasio - Cortez offered
that Americans need \"the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean
water.\" Barack Obama mentioned something about \"America protecting the
world from climate change,\" but with no elaboration. None of these
one-liners counts as climate policy. Real climate policy for either
party is greenwash and burn it down. There was no talk about
nationalizing fossil fuels, mobilizing all of the nation\'s resources
for an all-out struggle against mass extinction. None of the feel-good
slogans and platitudes had been aimed at climate. I will leave the
readers with an important quote: \"From this angle, it becomes clear
that capitalism is highly inefficient when it comes to meeting human
needs; it produces so much, and yet leaves 60% of the human population
without access to even the most basic goods. Why? Because a huge portion
of commodity production (and all the energy and materials it requires)
is irrelevant to human well-being. Consider this thought experiment:
Portugal has significantly better social outcomes than the United
States, with 65% less GDP per capita. This means that \$38,000 of US per
capita income is effectively \'wasted\'. That adds up to \$13 trillion
per year for the US economy as a whole; \$13 trillion worth of
extraction and production and consumption each year, and \$13 trillion
worth of ecological pressure, that adds nothing, in and of itself, to
human well-being. It is damage without gain.\" This quote is not from
Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, or Tim Walz. No, it is from
Jason Hickel, perhaps the most lucid and charismatic voice in the
movement for degrowth. He was not invited to speak at the DNC
convention, and I have no reason to quote him. Forgive me.

[science]{.underline} which [compels the inanimate limbs]{.underline} of
the machinery, by their construction, [to act purposefully, as [an
**automaton**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [does not exist in the worker\'s
consciousness, but]{.underline} rather [acts upon him through the
machine as an alien power,]{.underline} as the power of the machine
itself. [The **[appropriation of living labour by objectified
labo]{.mark}ur**]{.underline} -- [of]{.underline} the
[power]{.underline} or activity [which creates value by value existing
for-itself]{.underline} -- which [lies in the concept of
capital]{.underline}, is posited, [in production]{.underline} resting on
machinery, as the character of the production process itself, including
its material elements and its material motion. The
[production]{.underline} process has [ceased to be]{.underline} a
[labour]{.underline} process in the sense of a process dominated by
labour as its governing unity. [Labour appears]{.underline}, rather,
merely [as a conscious organ]{.underline}, [scattered among]{.underline}
the individual living [workers]{.underline} at numerous points of the
mechanical system; [subsumed]{.underline} [under the]{.underline} total
process of the [machinery itself]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} itself
only [a link of the system]{.underline}, [whose unity exists not in the
living workers, but rather in the living]{.underline} (active)
[machinery]{.underline}, [which confronts his individual, insignificant
doings as a mighty organism]{.underline}. In machinery, [[objectified
labour confronts living labour within the labour process itself as the
power which rules it]{.mark}; a power which]{.underline},
[as]{.underline} the appropriation of [living labour, is]{.underline}
the form of [capital]{.underline}. (Marx, 1993, p. 693, my italics) What
is relevant in the above quote is not just how **[machinery colonises
labour]{.underline}** (the 'acting upon' of machinery) but also how
labour unity both between and within the individual labourer is
'scattered' among the individual workers. As the British philosopher
Nick Land describes the process of AI takeover in industry: \[Page
647\][Modern production seems like a dream of **cyborg colonization
work**]{.underline}, a dream that makes the nightmare of Taylorism seem
idyllic. Industrial **[machines dismantle the]{.underline}** actuality
of the [**proletariat**, displacing it in the direction of cyborg
**hybridization**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} re [the]{.underline}
**[plasalizingticity]{.underline}** of **[labour power]{.underline}**.
[The]{.underline} corresponding [extraction of tradable value from the
body]{.underline} sophisticates [at the interface]{.underline},
[dissociating exertion into]{.underline} increasingly
[intricate]{.underline} [functional sequences]{.underline}, from pedals,
levers and vocal commands through the synchronization of production-line
tasks and time-motion programs, to sensory-motor transduction within
increasingly complex and self-micromanaged artificial environments,
capturing minutely adaptive behavior for capital.
**[Autocybernating]{.underline}** [market control guides the
labour-process into **immersion**]{.underline}. (Land, 2018, p. 435, my
italics) Here, Land takes further Marx\'s 19th-century considerations of
what is happening to labour in the process of industrial production.
[Labour]{.underline} in all its forms (mental and physical) [becomes
'dismantled' into discrete components through AI realising]{.underline}
the myriad ways in which it can be combined ([its
**plasticity**]{.underline}) [where **human behaviour is
captured**]{.underline}. In each of these quotes, the idea is that
[labour is consistently pushed to the limits of human embodiment as it
becomes captured by machinery into a 'grammar' of human
labour]{.underline} far [surpassing]{.underline} the ideas of
[scientific management]{.underline}. In these scenarios
[learning]{.underline} at work [does not exist within human entities but
in 'chopped up' human assemblages that would be integrated with machines
and data in many different forms]{.underline}. The
[learning]{.underline} takes places [within]{.underline} various [AIs in
terms of a 'skill bank']{.underline} [whereby]{.underline} various
[entities]{.underline} would be charged with '[produc]{.underline}ing'
types of behaviour. As stated above, [this would be an]{.underline}
[impoverished conception of human learning]{.underline} [where
**learning would become**]{.underline} reconceptualised as pure
**[outcome]{.underline}**. In the field of consumption, [**AI** is
already building up **data** on our **behavioural
patterns**]{.underline} [through]{.underline} platform **[capitalist
tools]{.underline}** [such as]{.underline} **[Facebook, Twitter and
Google]{.underline}**. [Reactions and behaviours are quantified
and]{.underline} used to [build]{.underline} up [a
**profile**]{.underline} [not only of]{.underline} our
[individual]{.underline} [behaviour but of a **model of human
behaviour**]{.underline}. Existent disciplines such as [**Psychology**
and Sociology]{.underline} in universities [appear to be rather
**insignificant** compared to]{.underline} [how accurately]{.underline}
[**social media** giants can **predict (and modify**]{.underline})
[attitudes and]{.underline} **[behaviours]{.underline}** [based
on]{.underline} the [predictions of '**Big Data**]{.underline}\'. In the
workplace, [quantification]{.underline} also [gathers]{.underline} and
uses [data on how workers]{.underline} [behave and respond]{.underline}.
As considered above, in many ways [this is an **extension of scientific
management**]{.underline} [whereby]{.underline} the movements of
[workers were laboriously logged and tested]{.underline} in a series of
scientific experiments. [Photography]{.underline} was used to
[map]{.underline} and chart [each]{.underline} human
[movement]{.underline} as part of a production process [so]{.underline}
that [each factory]{.underline} worker [was subject to **optimisation**
and]{.underline} eventually computer [tech]{.underline}nology
[developed]{.underline} more [complex techniques of process and
production management]{.underline} which were used to record and
simulate worker behaviour. As technology improves, [modes of
quantification have become]{.underline} increasingly
[extensive]{.underline} (Moore et al., 2017). High performance
[**[digital cameras]{.mark}** and sensors]{.underline} are used to
[record worker movements at **[sub-perceptual
levels]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Smartwatches]{.underline}**]{.mark}
can [record]{.underline} worker **[biometrics]{.underline}** [and allow
instant feedback on worker attitudes]{.underline}. Worker [interactions
and **vocalisations**]{.underline} [can be measured by]{.underline}
using [Alexa]{.underline}-type [devices]{.underline} in the workplace.
Employee [**sentiment** can be measured by conducting **text analysis**
of their social media posts]{.underline}. Such [devices]{.underline} can
also be used to **[[measure worker resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**
([including union organisation]{.underline}) [and the]{.underline}
worker\'s [capacity for disruptive activity]{.underline}. [These
are]{.underline} all forms of [worker surveillance]{.underline}.
[Through these means]{.underline}, [labour power production is
becoming]{.underline} even more [extensive to]{.underline}
[reflect]{.underline} not only a wider variety of [physical and mental
**[attitudes]{.mark}**]{.underline} and **[behaviours]{.underline}**,
but also worker attitudes and **[[emotions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Compliance and satisfaction can be measured]{.underline} not only
through a periodic worker satisfaction survey but
[constantly]{.underline} and \[Page 648\]consistently **[during every
moment]{.underline}** of an employee\'s day. [This is not
just]{.underline} a process of [quantifying each individual
worker]{.underline}, [it also involves building]{.underline} up [a model
of human behaviour in general]{.underline}. Zuboff (2019) argues that
'**[Surveillance Capitalism']{.underline}** [is]{.underline} not just a
method of increasing productivity in certain circumstances but also [a
method for producing a]{.underline} residue, or [surplus]{.underline},
from these surveillance activities [in which workers are dispossessed of
skills]{.underline}. Zuboff refers to [this]{.underline} activity as
'**[behavioural surplus\']{.underline}**: **[Surveillance
capitalism]{.underline}** [begins with]{.underline} the discovery of
[behavioral surplus]{.underline}. **[More]{.underline}** behavioral
**[data]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} [rendered than required for
service improvements]{.underline}. [This surplus feeds **machine
intelligence**]{.underline} -- [the]{.underline} **[[new means of
production]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [that fabricates
**[predictions]{.mark}** of user behavior]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} products [are sold to]{.underline} business
customers in [new]{.underline} **[behavioral futures
markets]{.underline}**. [The **Behavioral Value Reinvestment Cycle** is
subordinated to this new logic.]{.underline} (Zuboff, 2019, p. 97)
Zuboff primarily considers the realm of consumption in her analysis of
Surveillance Capitalism, but it is also possible to apply this work to
the behavioural surplus acquired in the workplace. Surveillance produces
streams of data which can be combined with other data pools and
resources to produce (through machine learning) insights into aspects of
human labour that could not be gained by a single observation alone.
[Owners of this data]{.underline} (who might not be the employer who
uses the technology) can create new ways of understanding the mechanisms
of worker productivity and the 'nudges' by which the labour power of
workers can be enhanced. These can be combined [with AI
knowledge]{.underline} of other entities in the production process to
specify minute interactions between those entities to [optimise
production]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} what Zuboff (2019, p. 97)
refers to as [the 'Behavioural Reinvestment Cycle\']{.underline},
[whereby behaviour]{.underline} is used to build platforms that [are
reintegrated into the production process to further optimise worker
behaviour]{.underline}. One existing example of this is the use of
so-called '[fatigue functions']{.underline} to op[timise human
performance in production]{.underline}. [A 'fatigue
function']{.underline} is a mathematical equation derived from empirical
observation which [shows when a human worker is reaching]{.underline}
the point of '[failure']{.underline} in terms of being unable to carry
on with their task successfully. At present fatigue functions are
usually determined by using existing data on worker fatigue so that a
production process can be optimised. Studies which have tested worker
fatigue in real manufacturing environments under experimentally
controlled conditions can be used to specify how workers should behave
in reality. With the advent of consistently gathered biometric and
behavioural data on workers in real time, [fatigue can be measured
consistently]{.underline}, [and the worker is consistently experimented
on by AI that can 'nudge' workers towards better
performance]{.underline}. [The accumulation of intelligence through
surveillance]{.underline} on each individual worker [[is reinvested
constantly into a superior system]{.underline}]{.mark}. It must be noted
that the idea of an intelligence that can catalogue and build a grammar
of individual skills and capacities to be used in the workplace is not a
new one. The early years of the Soviet Union produced a number of
experiments in creating a catalogue of human skills and abilities, with
their origins in the work of Alexi Gastev. Gastev sought to record and
catalogue all manifestations of physical labour (Ings, 2016, p. 79)
which could be combined in a 'performance\'. Through this manual
cataloguing performances could be choreographed, and workers would learn
through rehearsal to prepare for factory work. In the 1980s there were
similar attempts in terms of CBET to create a universal database of
competences that could be used for any occupation. Plans were made for a
vast lexicon of computerised records which could be used to select
exactly the right set of competences for a particular work task
(Preston, 2017, p. 34). These early experiments foreshadow the
contemporary situation where individual behaviours are under
surveillance and disaggregated, but the essential difference is that
learning is transferred from the worker to the AI, and that the real
learning that takes place in the workplace \[Page 649\]is occurring at
the level of machines rather than at the level of humans. This evolution
and confluence of workplace [[learning with AI and machine
learning]{.mark} is]{.underline} increasingly
[[making]{.underline}]{.mark} the prospect of '[cloud-based'
services]{.underline} for skills [more likely]{.underline}. Rather than
individuals possessing knowledge of discrete skills, the [organisation
uses 'Behavioural Value Reinvestment' to create a]{.underline}
consistently evolving [learning platform regarding worker
behaviour]{.underline}. However, there is no reason why this
[[evolving]{.mark} knowledge]{.underline} of skills and abilities should
remain at the level of the individual organisation. As is the case with
other services which can be accessed by a digital organisation, there
are plans for 'skills clouds' whereby [employers]{.underline} of various
types [could 'draw down' the particular skills components]{.underline}
that they require in their workplace. For example, Workday, a
[NASDAQ]{.underline}-listed company [with a [market capitalisation of
\$40 billion]{.mark}]{.underline}, [has produced a 'skills cloud' system
that uses machine learning to categorise]{.underline} skills between
organisations in order [to form a common 'skills
language\':]{.underline} Cristina Goldt, vice president, HCM products,
Workday commented: 'Nearly every organization wants to develop and
reskill their workforce to grow their people and their business, but
they lack a fundamental understanding of the skills they have and the
skills they need. Our skills cloud tackles this issue head on with
machine learning algorithms that bring calm to the chaotic language of
skills. This will ultimately help customers connect skills to people in
a more meaningful way to improve how they get work done, develop
existing workers, and allocate talent to better meet evolving business
needs. (Source:
www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2018/10/03/workday-unveil-skills-cloud/) The
capacity for 'skills clouds' to grow is not only premised on technology
but also on the growth of new forms of precarious employment.
Recruitment agencies, who often act to 'sift' employees to large
employers make use of skills tests, using AI and machine learning, to
filter workers into job positions and in doing so gain wider behavioural
knowledge of worker skills and abilities. Similarly, the growth of
'platform capitalism' in terms of employers who use mobile applications
to track and reward workers (such as Uber or Deliveroo) gain constant
data on employee behaviour and skills. This leads to a number of
separate 'skills clouds\', with the possibility of amalgamation at a
higher level. The implication of this for learning at work is clear in
that learning is disappearing not just from workers, but potentially
also from employers as it is integrated into the 'skills cloud' by
multinational companies.

### L - Ice Breakers

#### Icebreaker creation is motivated by capitalism

**ICT 21** (Internationalist Communist Tendency, non-profit organization
that advocates for global communism, "Ice Breaker Imperialism", Libcom,
October 21, 2021, https://libcom.org/article/ice-breaker-imperialism) bw

However, the real prize in the scramble for the Arctic is control over
the two northern sea routes, the Northwest Passage on the Canadian side
but particularly the Northern Sea Route on the Russian side. [[Since the
days of mercantilism,]{.mark} the **[development of capitalism
has]{.mark} always [been inseparable ]{.mark}**[from the]{.mark}
ever-expanding [networks of **naval distribution**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
From the South China Sea to the Panama Canal, the arteries of economic
life appear as the vast flow of commodities atop massive freighters.
Historical events like the Suez Crisis in 1956, or recent events such as
the blocking of the Suez Canal by the Ever Given, confirm the
indispensability of these passages for world capital. The enthusiasm of
the bourgeoisie to the opening of these northern passages can be marked
by the celebration of the cargo ship Nunavik transporting nickel from
Quebec to China in 2014. The voyage took two weeks less than the
traditional Panama Canal route. Coinciding with the opening of Arctic
shipping is the Canadian government's plan to open and expand the
infrastructure of deep-water Arctic ports, with new commitments to build
a port in Nunavut and expanding the infrastructure of the port of
Churchill, Manitoba. Across the pole, Russian policy is even more
determined. The building of new naval bases is always geared toward
controlling the NSR. With the first commercial ship making its way
through the NSR in 2018, it can be estimated that the utilization of the
NSR would lead to a reduction of days at sea by 40 percent in contrast
to the traditional route through the Suez Canal. With 7,000 miles of
Arctic coast Russia understands it is well positioned geographically to
dominate what it hopes will rival the Suez Canal in connecting European
and Asian markets. The Russian strategy is based on its ability to ferry
cargo though the NSR with its modern fleet of nuclear powered
icebreakers--with a fee of course. Putin has remarked that Russian
dominance in the Arctic is key to Russia's economic and strategic
future. In response to Russian plans in 2020 the United States sailed a
fleet of four destroyers with anti-submarine equipment though the
Barents Sea. Future maneuvers are prepared to increase the number of
destroyers from four to six. The message is clear, [[America wishes the
northern routes]{.mark} to [be]{.mark} "economic free zones" and
"international waters", while in real terms waterways would be [under
American power]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the opening of the two
northern routes China was quick to declare itself a "near Arctic
country" and has entered the competition to push its interests by
proclaiming a "polar silk road". The polar silk road is attached to
China's massive Belt and Road Initiative which seeks to institute
massive infrastructure projects throughout Asia, Africa and Europe to
greater tie the world economy to Chinese capital and openly challenge
American capital. Knowing that the NSR through the Russian northern
coast offers the shortest route from China to Europe, in 2017 China's
state-owned shipping giant COSCO has proposed the development of an
Arctic deep-water port on the Northern Dvina River near the northern
Russian city of Archangelsk. Next to this are Chinese proposals to
develop bridges and railroads in Norway and Finland. Even earlier there
was Chinese interest in buying the Canadian Arctic port in Churchill, an
offer which was clearly rejected as the Canadian press in 2020 proudly
boasted that the port was 100 percent Canadian-owned. The American
response to the Chinese initiative in the Arctic is exemplified by
former president Donald Trump floating the possibility of purchasing
Greenland from Denmark, where China has invested in rare-minerals. While
the purchase offer for Greenland was rejected by the Danish government,
the Danes did accept a \$12.1 million economic aid package for
Greenland, "aimed at strengthening mutual ties and boosting a renewed
U.S. push for a greater military presence in the Arctic."(6) The point
is clear[: [The number one priority of]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} [is to
stop the expansion of Chinese capital at all costs, and to achieve this
through]{.mark} preparation for future military confrontation. [The
icebreaker]{.mark}]{.underline} is the seminal piece of machinery
required to contest the Arctic waters. Icebreakers use their strong
hulls to bear down on sheets of ice to crack its upper surface. A fleet
without icebreakers is vulnerable to the unpredictability of the Arctic
climate and runs the risk of a reduction in maneuverability or even
getting trapped in the sea ice[. [Russia]{.mark} hosts a [fleet of 40
icebreakers]{.mark}, the largest stock in the world, including its new
class of nuclear-powered icebreakers. This [has American officials
lamenting]{.mark} that the Russians can treat, "\[the\] Northern Sea
Route like it's the Mississippi River."(7) The United States fears that
the [Russian edge in geography and hardware will turn]{.mark} what is
predicted to become [a major shipping route into a Russian dominated
toll route]{.mark}. In contrast, the United States can only boast of
possessing 3 icebreakers, which officials fear leaves them vulnerable
and unable to compete despite America's otherwise massive capabilities.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan to build its own class of
nuclear-powered icebreakers and Canada can field 13 of its own
icebreakers. [The current state of the stock of U.S. icebreakers
has]{.mark} the American [Defense Department decrying an "icebreaker
gap]{.mark}]{.underline}", reminiscent of the cold war "missile gap". In
response to this "gap", former President Trump demanded a new fleet of
icebreakers be commissioned, containing 3 heavy and 3 medium
icebreakers, to be ready by 2029. While the U.S. Coast Guard announced
it had signed a \$746 million contract for the design and construction
of a new class of heavy icebreakers. Nonetheless, the U.S. Defense
Department's obsession over the 'icebreaker gap' has not been quelled,
with American admirals nervously stuttering to the press "who puts
missiles on icebreakers?"(8) when remarking on Russia arming its
nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet. In contrast to the American military
worried if it can defend crucial chokepoints, such as the
Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom corridor, the Russian Northern Fleet is
conducting a study of combat operations in the western and eastern
Arctic sea zones via large military drills. [The situation is clear.
[The]{.mark} dire [economic situation]{.mark} [facing the bourgeoisie
has spurred an arms race in the Arctic Theatre. As capitalism meanders
toward another crisis, no actors]{.mark} in the fight for Arctic
dominance [appear willing to stand down]{.mark}. While it is always "too
soon" to declare a potential site for inter-imperialist bickering to
result in global conflagration, there is reason to shed light on
maneuverings in the Arctic. The [climate has]{.mark} assuredly and
permanently [opened the once-frozen landscape to
exploitation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Decades ago, the question was "is it
possible for conflict to arise here?" Today, we must ask "how soon
should we expect it?" as the massive centers of national capital
scramble to secure the dwindling profits. What is clear is that
capitalism's response to its crisis of profitability is the escalation
of imperialist competition next to massive attacks on the condition of
the working class. What does this crisis mean for Chinese workers but
the 996 work week and fighter jets over Taiwan. What does this crisis
mean for Canadian workers but larger military drills and rising rents.
What does this crisis mean for Russian workers but tank maneuvers on the
borders of Europe and longer hours. What does this crisis mean for
American workers but Uber-style jobs and an icebreaker build up. What
else can this mean but that "the main enemy is at home"! For the bosses
misery and militarism are the solutions to the crisis. Against the
bosses drive towards total barbarism the solution of the working class
can only be a world communist revolution!

[Dominant [**conceptions of (renewable) energy** as a]{.mark} resource,
object, abstract thing and a [commodity **owe much to** thermodynamics
and]{.mark} relatedly [the evolution of industrial **capitalism** and
imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Lohmann (2021) briefly traces back
[the [evolution of the modern]{.mark} concept of [energy between 1820
and 1850]{.mark} to thermodynamics. He argues that the two [laws of
thermodynamics were created by capitalist society]{.mark} and that
[energy]{.mark} as we understand it today [would have not been possible
without]{.mark} post-1800 imperial reorganizations [of
human-more-than-human relations]{.mark} made attainable through
thermodynamics]{.underline} (Lohmann, 2021). Thermodynamic energy 'is
the re-engineering of territories', whereby human-more-than-human
commons are appropriated and 'put to work' for surplus value creation
(Lohmann, 2021). [[Thermodynamics has been a mode of denying]{.mark}
numerous [subsistence and flourishing practices]{.mark} and of
concealing and subsuming anti-thermodynamic energies referred to as
'little-e-energies]{.underline}' (Lohmann, 2021: 91). These energies
'remain entangled with particular times...particular places...nor can
they be transported in as large quantities or over long distances'
(Lohman, 2013: 26). Similarly, Daggett (2019) traces back the modern
concept of energy too to the development of thermodynamics in the 1840s,
arguing that before that 'energy' was used metaphorically to refer to
life's dynamism. She contends that [thermodynamic energy has been [a
political project of industrial capitalism and imperialism,
that]{.mark}, inter alia, [forecloses and subsumes other ways of knowing
energy and the world]{.mark}]{.underline} (Daggett, 2019).
[[Thermodynamics rendered energy as]{.mark} the ability to do work and
[a unit]{.mark} of equivalence]{.underline} (Daggett, 2019; Lohmann,
2021). Meanwhile, the industrial revolution led to an important change
in how the notion 'resource' was understood. Before it, the term was
used to refer to the self's inner strength for recovering from crises.
During the eighteenth century, it came to be understood in the plural --
as resources -- chiefly 'as a set of external objects, which could be
manipulated and multiplied' (Hausmann and Perraux, 2018: 190). The
concept matured during the following two centuries under the growing
hegemony of economic rationalities (Hausmann and Perraux, 2018) and was
gradually modelled on the concept of energy of thermodynamics
(Simon-Stickley, 2021); [thermodynamic energy [meant **that all
elements**]{.mark} **of the more-than-human world** [were **recast as
resources**]{.mark} and as interchangeable]{.underline} (Simon-Stickley,
2021). [**[Thermodynamics as a political project]{.mark}** and these
[shifts in understandings **materialized within an ongoing
form**]{.mark}ation and appropriation **[of 'Cheap Nature']{.mark}**
that originated [in capitalism]{.mark}'s rise]{.underline} from ca. 1450
(Moore, 2016; 2017). 'Cheap Nature' are elements pivotal, and
appropriated as commodities, for capitalist (re)production (chiefly
labour, energy, food and raw materials) reflecting unpaid work/energy of
organic life (Moore, 2016; 2017). [The making of '**[Cheap Nature' was
based on ontologically separating 'Nature' from life's web]{.mark}**
[and transforming 'It']{.mark} into discrete units and calculable
objects [disavowing relationships]{.mark} and provided a thrust for the
colonialism of early capitalism]{.underline} (Moore, 2016; 2017). [The
current popular understanding of [energy]{.mark} as an abstract
interchangeable thing derived from exploitable resources]{.underline}
(i.e., objects) [which can be [put to work for human purposes is]{.mark}
inextricably [tied with the evolution of]{.mark} (industrial)
[capitalism and colonial]{.mark}ism/[imperial]{.mark}ism and their
[violences. It facilitates]{.mark} the exchange of [energy
commodities]{.mark} in the market [for creating surplus
value.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Such visions are myopic to the fact that contemporary 'renewable

transitioning away from capitalist energy
development]{.mark}**]{.underline} (whether fossil fuels or so-called
renewable energy) and capitalism. This resonates with Dunlap's and
Tornel's (2023: 1) call to foreground 'autonomous, insurrectionary and
postdevelopment energy systems'. Yet, this, and [[transitioning away
from capitalism]{.mark}, requires awakening nomadic thinking and
imagination. This involves dispelling and [abandoning dominant myths
surrounding]{.mark} contemporary '[renewable energy' development,
'energy sources' and growth]{.mark} and [goes]{.mark} together [with
disabusing]{.mark} and moving away from
[anthropocentrism]{.mark}.]{.underline} It includes experimenting and
inventing together with more-than-humans ways to materialize new
socio-ecological forms, which could be better facilitated under an
experiential--experimental approach to learning. [Insurrecting
subjugated knowledges existing all around but not valued, or building
new emancipatory ones, and taking note from counter-hegemonic
struggles/initiatives, is crucial to these effects]{.underline}.
Finally, forming new solidarities against neoliberal and neocolonialist
imaginations and for minoritarian becomings is pivotal. Human
geographers and political ecologists can help with these challenges.

Business]{.underline} adopting [new technologies]{.underline} to [pull
the planet back from a climate disaster]{.underline}. But **[Big
Business isn't going to save the world]{.underline}**.

A Question of Consumption

The problem isn't simply that [corporations]{.underline} often [lie,
using]{.underline} environmental rhetoric to "[greenwash]{.underline}"
their images. [It goes much deeper than that.]{.underline}

**[Capitalism must grow]{.underline}**. [Its]{.underline} blind [search
for profit might bring disaster, but it will]{.underline} still [sniff
out opportunities]{.underline} [for
expansion,]{.underline} **[indifferent to]{.underline}** experience
or **[consequences]{.underline}**. As a
result, [even]{.underline} [measures
that]{.underline} [might]{.underline} [alleviate]{.underline} [the
environmental]{.underline} [crisis
become]{.underline} [immediately]{.underline} **[weaponized against the
planet]{.underline}**.

For instance, the panels that produce solar electricity have improved at
a remarkable rate, offering a tantalizing glimpse of a future powered by
the sun's limitless power. [The advances made
in]{.underline} **[renewables]{.underline}** and associated technologies
(such as battery storage) [will play a huge role in any serious response
to the environmental crisis]{.underline}.

**[Yet]{.underline}** researchers Richard York and Shannon Elizabeth
Bell caution that capitalism has already undergone many previous energy
transitions: from biofuels (such as wood) to coal, from coal to oil,
from oil to natural gas, and now, potentially, from fossil fuels to
renewables. They warn
that [no]{.underline} [established]{.underline} [energy source
has]{.underline} **[undergone]{.underline}** **[a
sustained]{.underline}** **[decline]{.underline}** **[merely]{.underline}** **[because
a new one became available]{.underline}**. More typically, [rather than
replacing]{.underline} the older source, [the new
source]{.underline} [is immediately used to]{.underline} **[intensify
growth]{.underline}** [and thus more overall energy use.]{.underline}

In many cases, the addition of new sources has actually increased
consumption of previous types of energy. The embrace of fossil fuels
led, in relative terms, to a decline in biofuels. Yet, [in absolute
terms]{.underline}, the use of [petroleum]{.underline} in logging trucks
and mills greatly **[intensified deforestation]{.underline}** and thus
produced a net increase in the use of wood. [Similarly, the rise
of]{.underline} [petroleum did not curtail]{.underline} [trade
in]{.underline} [whale oil,
but]{.underline} [instead]{.underline} [fostered]{.underline} [a
dramatic]{.underline} **[intensification of whaling]{.underline}** ---
partly because whale **[ships became much more efficient]{.underline}**,
and partly because the industry developed new uses (such as in
margarine) for its products.

It remains to be seen whether renewables will have the same effect. The
available figures show a significant shift to renewable energy in terms
of new capacity, with investment in renewables outpacing fossil fuels.
Yet, internationally, the percentage of renewable energy as a proportion
of electricity and other energy has been very slow to
change. **[Renewable energy
consumption]{.underline}** has **[increased]{.underline}** --- **[but
overall energy consumption has increased far, far more]{.underline}**.
There's no mystery as to why.

In 1865, William Stanley Jevons published a book entitled The Coal
Question. The titular query centered on Britain's response to the rapid
depletion of its coal stocks, with the book most remembered today
because of Jevons's rejection of claims that technologically driven
energy efficiency would alleviate the shortage. "[It is wholly a
confusion of ideas to suppose]{.underline}," he said, "[that the
economical use of fuel is equivalent to a diminished consumption. The
very contrary is the truth]{.underline}."

What he meant was that **[efficiency]{.underline}** **[decreases price
and thus]{.underline}** **[encourages use]{.underline}**, leading to
a **[rebound]{.underline}** that **[wipes out]{.underline}** **[the
supposed]{.underline}** **[savings]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} so-called **[Jevons
Paradox]{.underline}** [has been demonstrated over and over
again]{.underline} [in the years since]{.underline}. A prosaic example
involves refrigerators, with the [improvements]{.underline} of new
models [correspond]{.underline}ing [not to a decline in the overall
environmental impact]{.underline} of white
goods, [but]{.underline} rather fostering [a]{.underline} huge [boom
in]{.underline} the [industry]{.underline}, **[and]{.underline}** so a
massive total **[rise in]{.underline}** both energy **[consumption and
carbon dioxide]{.underline}** output. [Because capital must expand,
technologies that]{.underline}, in the abstract, [should reduce resource
use become the basis for a reorganization that enables fresh
accumulation.]{.underline}

The first generation of computer users will remember the claim that
screen use would make paper redundant --- something that palpably failed
to occur, as computerization provided fresh markets supplying home and
office printers.

Likewise, the invention of synthetic alternatives did not mean that
natural fibers were no longer used --- instead, their production
massively expanded in parallel with the new options.

Enthusiasts for "[green capitalism" insist that]{.underline}, as
economies mature, [their "material footprint"]{.underline} --- the
measure of their environmental impact --- [declines]{.underline}. In the
digital era, [they say, technological progress decouples capitalist
growth from ecological damage, allowing the system to expand safely into
infinity.]{.underline}

Yet [while]{.underline} some [individual
economies]{.underline} have [reduced]{.underline} their [dependence]{.underline} on
nonrenewable resources, **[they've]{.underline}** generally **[done so
by outsourcing dirty
industries]{.underline}**. [As]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [meta-analysis]{.underline} [of
179 studies between 1990 and 2019]{.underline} [put it,
"no]{.underline} [evidence for the]{.underline} **[needed kind
of]{.underline}** **[decoupling]{.underline}** **[currently]{.underline}** **[exists]{.underline}**."
On the contrary, [the materials used by the global economy passed 100
billion]{.underline} [tonnes]{.underline} [per year --- a disturbing new
record, and the exact opposite of "dematerialization."]{.underline}

"Not only is there no empirical evidence supporting the existence of a
decoupling of economic growth from environmental pressures on anywhere
near the scale needed to deal with environmental breakdown," explained a
major 2019 report for the European Environmental Bureau, "but also, and
perhaps more importantly, such **[decoupling appears unlikely to happen
in the future]{.underline}**."

Think of electric vehicles (EVs) --- a mode of transport far less
destructive than internal-combustion engines. Like solar
power, [EVs]{.underline} will surely play an important role in a
sustainable future. **[Under capitalism]{.underline}**, however, they've
been seized upon by the automotive industry to preserve and [extend car
culture]{.underline}. [Rather than]{.underline} [reducing waste
and]{.underline} **[decoupling]{.underline}** [transportation]{.underline} from
material inputs, the automotive [companies]{.underline} see
opportunities to [renew]{.underline} old **[markets]{.underline}** in
Europe and North America, [and]{.underline} to **[open fresh
ones]{.underline}** in places such as China.

Their success in
selling [high-tech]{.underline} private [vehicles]{.underline} will,
accordingly, [forestall sustainable options such
as]{.underline} bicycles and [public transport]{.underline}, push cities
to maintain the wasteful infrastructure designed around
cars, [and]{.underline} [foster a]{.underline} [new and
ruinous]{.underline} **[race for]{.underline}** **[lithium, cobalt,
nickel, manganese, and other]{.underline}** **[rare
materials]{.underline}** [**needed for batteries**.]{.underline}

Against Corporate Environmentalism

If the tendency of capitalism to respond to a crisis with more
capitalism gives the system its disastrous momentum, it also provides
the capitalists themselves with insulation from the consequences of
their actions. The intensified commodification resulting from each fresh
calamity creates opportunities for those with disposable wealth to
ensure that they and their loved ones remain more or less unaffected.

The planet might be growing unbearably hot, but if you have the money,
you can still live in air-conditioned comfort in a pleasant
location. [In the midst of]{.underline} [**mass extinctions**, luxury
eco-resorts and private zoos allow the well-to-do to gaze on tigers,
orangutans, and elephants]{.underline}. That's why, even a looming
apocalypse will not, in and of itself, motivate them to change course.

[The technology to prevent climate
change]{.underline} [exists]{.underline} --- and it's getting better all
the time. [What]{.underline} [we]{.underline} **[don't
have]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** **[a social system that
allows]{.underline}** [us to use]{.underline} [it.]{.underline}

The failure of world leaders to deliver meaningful political outcomes at
COP26 will give "green" entrepreneurs more room to posture as a
meaningful alternative. In that context, [it's crucial]{.underline} for
activists not to fall in behind corporate environmentalism, but
rather [to build an]{.underline} **[independent movement]{.underline}**,
one [that prioritizes]{.underline} **[human]{.underline}** **[need over
capitalist logic]{.underline}**

### L -- Resource Exploration

#### Arctic exploration cannot be disconnected from [resource colonialism]{.underline}. Exploration is [co-opted]{.underline} by companies seeking to [exploit]{.underline} the region.

and Natural Resources. pp. 172-184;
https://doi.org/10.4337/9781783475636.00020

Over the past four centuries, [[the quest for]{.mark}
natural]{.underline}, in particular [energy [resources
has]{.mark}]{.underline} [[been the]{.mark} [major driver for]{.mark}
[Western peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
penetrate and **[[explore the Arctic]{.mark} region.]{.underline}**
[**Natural resource endowments** have contributed to
**[constructing]{.mark}** [the Arctic region as a]{.mark}
"**[commodity-supply space]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Bridge, 2001).
[Populations of whales and other marine mammals, deposits of coal, oil
and gas in the Circumpolar North have been interpreted as "**Arctic
riches**"]{.underline} [and **exported** as **valuable commodities** to
distant **consumer markets**.]{.underline} Forces driving the
incorporation of the Arctic into the global energy economy have come
from outside the Arctic region -- where benefits of the Arctic
exploitation were mainly ripped off. [[Scarcity of]{.mark} local
[population]{.mark} has [added to an image of the Arctic as a **terra
nullius**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a peopleless space that can be
understood and discovered through geology and law. [Severe climatic
conditions have brought a romantic flavour to Western narratives of
Arctic development as]{.underline} heroic exploration, [making the High
North an articulation of **human bravery** and **technological
progress**.]{.underline} [From **whale oil** to **offshore
drilling**]{.underline}, [the patterns of [material production]{.mark}
in the Arctic corresponded to international energy flows,
**[embedding]{.mark}** the [history of Arctic **exploration** within
**human energy** history **more broadly**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Since the late 2000s, changes in the natural environment coupled with
assessments of Arctic hydrocarbon deposits presented by geoscientists,
attractive investment packages produced by energy consultancies, and the
mounting energy needs of the developing world, have prompted advances in
policies and technologies for extraction and transportation of Arctic
resources. [[Discourses on energy policy]{.mark} [articulated]{.mark} by
actors from outside the Arctic produced [an image of the Arctic as a
"**final extractive frontier**," defining the Arctic in a
**resource-geographical way**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These discourses on
"Arctic riches" embedded within the broader international political
economy of energy acted as a form of entitlement to pursue extractive
activities in the Arctic. As demonstrated in this Chapter, the concept
of resource colonialism provides a powerful tool to deconstruct the
complex web of expectations about Arctic energy futures. In particular,
it shows how the remoteness of the Arctic from industrial and financial
centers that has been previously leveraged through Arctic resource
endowment has acquired a new dimension with ever-tighter incorporation
of the Arctic into the global energy system.

Until recently, the degree of apparent resource availability in the
Arctic has been the prime justification for investment into the large
scale industrialization of the High North. Yet, the fact that oil and
gas can be produced with greater ease and at less expense in many other
parts of the world, together with the growing viability of alternative
energy sources in the global energy mix and the global drop in oil
price, have undermined interest in Arctic energy development. As
peripheral Arctic was becoming global Arctic, its image as a remote
resource base increasingly came into conflict with intensifying concerns
over the environmental status of the Arctic and the planetary
consequences of Arctic climate change. With the increasing salience of
climate issues in global energy governance Arctic hydrocarbons are no
longer considered solely as a source of energy, but also as a source of
pollution. The shift from the "old" (extraction and consumption of
fossil fuels) to the "new" (carbon markets and offsetting) carbon
governance (Bridge, 2011) has also impacted the cost structure of Arctic
energy, adding the cost of carbon mitigation to already costly
exploration and transportation.

The core controversies of Arctic energy development result from the
globalization of the Arctic made manifest through its becoming embedded
within global commodity chains and global climate governance. Thus we
are at the stage when the global Arctic is simultaneously seen as an
empty space to be conquered and benefited from and, in strict contrast,
as fragile space to be protected and preserved. The tension between
these two narratives marks a significant change in the international
political economy of energy that underpins contemporary postindustrial
capitalism and offers an entry point into conversations that frame the
energy-climate nexus as "carbon governance" (Bridge, 2011). Arguably,
[[the]{.mark} ways in which [material activities will be **organized**
in the future is **inherently connected** to the **political
choices**]{.mark} [that prioritize the **image** of the Arctic as an
**extractive frontier** or as a **global
sanctuary**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Capitalism requires extractivism -- the aff is sacrificial development. 

**Tracy, 2023** (Elena, Senior Advisor, Sustainable Development World
Wildlife Fund Extractivism is damaging Arctic ecosystems and warming the
global climate, The Circle April 2023
https://www.arcticwwf.org/the-circle/stories/extractivism-is-damaging-arctic-ecosystems-and-warming-the-global-climate/)

[The Arctic region is facing down a mineral and fossil fuel exploration
and extraction bonanza. If these plans go ahead, they will have
devastating impacts on Indigenous and local communities, pristine Arctic
ecosystems, and the global climate.]{.underline}

[As a concept, "extractivism" has gained attention recently as mining
and mineral exploration companies eye frontiers that were once
inaccessible]{.underline}: the ocean seabed, the marine offshore, [areas
of the high north]{.underline} and more. Naomi Klein, the prominent
Canadian environmental author who wrote This Changes Everything---a book
about the climate crisis---describes extractivism as "a dominance-based
relationship with the earth" and connects it to what she calls sacrifice
zones: "places that, to their extractors, somehow don't count and can
therefore be poisoned, drained or otherwise destroyed."

[The fossil fuel projects across the Arctic region---in Russia, Norway
and Alaska]{.underline} (the US)---[are exactly that: sacrifice
zones]{.underline}. [Once extracted, hydrocarbons are exported over long
distances for use in other parts of the world, where they contribute to
the increase of global carbon emissions and exacerbate the climate
crisis]{.underline}. As discussed in a [research
brief](https://www.arcticwwf.org/newsroom/reports/research-brief-missing-the-target-fossil-fuel-production-in-the-arctic-is-out-of-step-with-the-1-5c-aligned-emission-reduction-goal/) recently
published by the WWF Global Arctic Programme, this increasing interest
in Arctic fossil fuel production is completely out of touch with the
Paris Agreement to hold global warming to 1.5°C or less. By 2030, the
volume of fossil fuels produced in the Arctic will be double the amount
that is consistent with that goal. By 2050, the gap may reach 700
percent.

[The lack of reciprocity in the economy of oil and gas production is
obvious: the mass-scale removal of resources for export creates an
accumulation of financial benefits far away from the sites of their
extraction, enriching distant shareholders, investment funds and oil
CEOs. But locally, these projects pollute rivers, marine coastal
environments, landscapes and the air. An oil spill in the Arctic would
also devastate ecosystems and Indigenous ways of life. The impacts could
be irreversible, wiping out wildlife populations and destroying
traditional food systems and livelihoods.]{.underline}

### L -- Mining

#### Mining fuels capitalism 

Laleh **Khalili '25** \[5/13/25 Laleh Khalili is Professor of Gulf
Studies at the University of Exeter. An expert on transnational
politics, she has written widely on globalisation, capital and
neo-colonialism, and has worked as a consultant and an engineer.
https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2025/05/13/book-review-extractive-capitalism-how-commodities-and-cronyism-drive-the-global-economy-laleh-khalili/#:\~:text\]
(FG)

There are at least two distinct interpretations of the term "extractive
capitalism". The first of these refers to [the commercial mining,
transportation and marketing of primary commodities from oil to iron ore
across the globe]{.underline}. The second refers to an [economic and
business model, long applied by **big corporations and financiers both
domestically and globally**, that is heavily geared to personal
enrichment. This is achieved by corporate and financial mechanisms aimed
at **extracting an excessive share of the gains from economic
activity**]{.underline}. Laleh Khalili's book is about the former, but
it also reveals a significant overlap between the two. **[Pumping oil,
mining resources and shipping commodities, all immensely profitable
industries across history, have long been a key driver of the global
economy]{.underline}** \[but are\] **[are riddled with 'lucrative
speculation, still low-cost labour and rapacious corporate control.'
Mining corporations and conglomerates have, over centuries, been a key
source of appropriation as well as of high levels of inequality
--]{.underline}** both within countries and across the globe. As the
author describes in the case of oil and sand, "\[t\]heir commodification
and trade hold mirrors to global inequalities and ecological plunder...
Extractive capitalism is about how the commodification of prosaic
everyday things affects lives here, now and half a world away". Pumping
oil, mining resources and shipping commodities, all immensely profitable
industries across history, have long been a key driver of the global
economy. Khalili is Professor of Gulf Studies at the University of
Exeter, and a leading expert on the oil industry and Middle Eastern
politics. Her work reveals [how these industries -- in some ways the
backbone of globalisation -- are riddled with "lucrative speculation,
still low-cost labour and rapacious corporate control."]{.underline}
They have also been a key source of the vast and growing pool of mobile
financial resources controlled by corporations, asset management
companies and sovereign wealth funds, that has been the product of
extractive capitalism, in both senses of the term. [The history of
mining is a story of strong-arm tactics]{.underline} \[...\] by western
governments and giant corporations mostly against countries of the
Global South. The book lays out in stark (albeit brief) form, the mostly
negative fall-out from crony corporate business practices in these raw
material industries, past and present. The examples used cover conquest
and colonisation[, the destruction of livelihoods along with pumped up
profit margins, and the role of state coercion. The history of the
extraction of and trade in both oil and sand is "rife with
manipulations, extortions, and abuse".]{.underline} Mining for sand has
stripped the rivers of Myanmar and Cambodia of their riverbeds and
sandbanks, [destroying ecosystems in the process]{.underline}. The book
also cites cases of protest movements against these industries. These
include the 2016-17 mass campaign of opposition mostly by indigenous
women, and eventually unsuccessful, against the construction of the
Dakota Access pipeline which crossed the Standing Rock Sioux
reservation. Another was the controversial natural Gaslink pipeline from
the Canadian Rockies to the Pacific Coast, designed to ship natural gas
to international markets. Despite multiple blockades that hindered
construction, the pipeline was eventually completed in 2024. The history
of mining is a story of strong-arm tactics -- through trade boycotts and
violent intervention to open and hidden cartels, offshore tax havens,
and corrupt financial dealing -- by western governments and giant
corporations mostly against countries of the Global South. Leading
characters include some of the world's richest tycoons. There's the 19th
century oil baron and the world's first billionaire, John D Rockefeller,
dubbed one of America's "robber barons" for his exploitative tactics.
His Standard Oil empire was eventually broken up by the anti-trust
legislation introduced by President Theodore Roosevelt: "We had come to
the stage where for our people what was needed was a real democracy"
wrote Roosevelt in 1913, "and of all forms of tyranny the least
attractive and the most vulgar is the tyranny of mere wealth, the
tyranny of a plutocracy." The surviving companies from the break-up of
Standard Oil remerged as the new giants, from ExxonMobil to Chevron,
which continued to dominate petroleum supply over the next century. A
potent summary of centuries of **[extraction of the world's natural
resources and raw materials, and of mass corporate and individual wealth
accumulation generated by ruthless business tactics.]{.underline}** And
then there's Aristotle Onassis, the unscrupulous Greek tycoon who
cornered the market in oil tankers, enabling his 'astonishing rise
through the prosperous ranks of global tycoons'. And much later, the
Russian oligarchs who were handed Russia's natural riches through the
cut-price sell-off of giant state industrial, energy and banking assets
in the chaos and corruption of the aftermath of the collapse of the
Soviet Union. None of them -- from Roman Abramovich to Alisher Usmanov
-- had built or managed the companies they effectively seized. This is a
concise account. While short books are to be welcomed, this means a
limited coverage of a complex history of predatory corporate and state
behaviour. The book draws on earlier essays published elsewhere
including The London Review of Books and Jacobin. It takes several
detours not fully relevant to the book's overall theme. These include a
brief discussion of "woke capital" and of China's "Belt and Road"
infrastructural programmes in Africa and Asia. There is also a short
account of the colonial interest in the strategic Chagos Islands, thrust
into the spotlight by the UK's decision to hand the archipelago back to
Mauritius. Despite its brevity, this is a potent summary of centuries of
extraction of the world's natural resources and raw materials, and of
mass corporate and individual wealth accumulation generated by ruthless
business tactics. **[Some parts of this mass industry have been under
pressure from the drive for renewable energy.]{.underline}** But with
some political leaders and high-profile companies, including behemoths
like BP and Shell, rowing back on their commitment to renewables, we are
a long way from the end of this story.

### L -- Space 

#### Space exploration under capitalism will only magnify inequalities---the alt is the only hope for equitable space travel

**Dickens '10** (Peter Dickens, "The Humanization of the Cosmos---To
What End?" Monthly Review, Vol. 62, Issue 6, November 2010,
<http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end>
jss)

[Society is increasingly humanizing the cosmos. Satellites have for some
time been central to the flow of information, to surveillance, and to
the conduct of warfare.]{.underline} As these examples suggest,
however[, the humanization of the cosmos is primarily benefiting the
powerful. These include major economic and military institutions.
Furthermore, the forthcoming commodification and colonization of the
cosmos is again likely to enhance the interests of the
powerful]{.underline}, the [major aerospace companies in particular. The
time has come to consider alternative forms of cosmic humanization.
These would enhance the prospects of the socially marginalized. They
would also allow humanity to develop a better understanding of the
cosmos and our relationship to
it]{.underline}.[1](http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end#en85)
Humanizing Outer Space [The 1969 Apollo 11 moon landing is often seen as
the high point of society's relationship with outer space. Nothing quite
so dramatic or exotic seems to have happened in outer space since. But
nearby, parts of the solar system]{.underline} (including the moon, some
asteroids, and Mars) [are now being routinely circled and explored and
analyzed by robots]{.underline}. Furthermore, President Obama has
recently made important announcements regarding a new U.S. space program
that involves manned missions to Mars by the mid-2030s. But the
NASA-based Constellation program to the moon and Mars has been
cancelled. Instead, [NASA will undertake a long-term research and
development program aimed at supporting future forms of propulsion and
exploration programs]{.underline}. Even more significant in the
short-term is a proposed \$25 billion being allocated to NASA to
kick-start commercial manned spaceflight over the next five years. New
forms of transport to the International Space Station will be funded,
this time using innovative forms of "space taxis" designed by private
sector space
companies.[2](http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end#en84)
[These plans entail new relations between the private and public sectors
in the United States.]{.underline} Meanwhile, a presence in outer space
is being developed by other societies. This is partly because such a
presence is seen as an important symbol of modernization, progress, and
social unity. The Indian government has announced a manned mission to
the moon in 2013, the European Space Agency envisages projects to the
moon and beyond, and the Chinese government is planning a similar
project for 2020. This last development has caused some consternation
over Obama's plans. One suggestion is that the United States may after
all be the next to send manned missions to the moon, because China's
space project is seen by some as a military threat that needs
forestalling.[3](http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end#en83)
Yet among these plans and proposals, it is easy to forget that outer
space is already being increasingly humanized. It has now been made an
integral part of the way global capitalist society is organized and
extended. Satellites, for example, are extremely important elements of
contemporary communications systems. These have enabled an increasing
number of people to become part of the labor market. Teleworking is the
best known example. Satellite-based communications have also facilitated
new forms of consumption such as teleshopping. Without satellite-based
communications, the global economy in its present form would grind to a
halt. Satellites have also been made central to modern warfare. Combined
with pilotless Predator drones, they are now being used to observe and
attack Taliban and Al-Qaida operatives in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
This action is done by remote control from Creech Air Force Base at
Indian Springs, Nevada. The 1980s Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star
Wars" program, aimed to intercept incoming missiles while facilitating
devastating attacks on supposed enemies. A version of the program is
still being developed, with the citizens of the Czech Republic and
Poland now under pressure to accept parts of a U.S.-designed "missile
defense shield." This is part of a wider strategy of "Full Spectrum
Dominance," which has for some time been official U.S. Defense
Policy.[4](http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end#en82)
Using surveillance and military equipment located in outer space is now
seen as the prime means of protecting U.S. economic and military assets
both on Earth and in outer space. Less dangerously, but still very
expensively, a full-scale space-tourism industry has for some time been
under active development. Dennis Tito, a multi-millionaire, made the
first tourist trip into outer space in 2001. Richard Branson's Virgin
Galactic has now sold over three hundred seats at \$200,000 apiece to
its first tourists in outer space. The program is due to start in 2011,
with spaceports for this novel form of travel now being built in Alaska,
California, Florida, New Mexico, Virginia, Wisconsin, the United Arab
Emirates, and Esrange in Sweden. Excursions circling the moon, likely to
cost the galactic visitors around \$100,000,000, are now under
development. Since the Renaissance period of the sixteenth century, the
word "humanization" has been used to connote something beneficial,
especially to human beings. As we will now see, humanizing the cosmos is
regarded in just these terms by some influential proponents of space
travel and space colonization. The Space Renaissance Initiative One
response to cosmic humanization is to welcome it as an early stage of a
wholly beneficial cosmic human society, one eventually encompassing the
solar system and beyond. Such is the view of the Space Renaissance
Initiative, an international group of over seventy private organizations
now promoting the expansion of society into the cosmos. The aims and
ideals of the Space Renaissance are made clear by the Initiative's
manifesto published in 2010. It reads: Help the Space Economy
Revolution! The global economy is entering a deep crisis, the worst
since 1929. This is the second act of the "Crisis of Closed-World
Ideologies", which has been developing throughout the 20thcentury. In
1989 the fall of the Berlin wall was the Crisis of Collectivist
Ideology. The recent massive failure of the financial system is the
Crisis of Neo-Liberal Ideology. Both these ideologies failed because
they are based upon a closed-world, terro-centric philosophy. There are
now almost 7 billion humans making massive demands on planet Earth: we
urgently need to open the frontier, and move to a wider vision of our
world, so as to access geo-lunar system resources and energy. In short
we need a new "Open World Philosophy". The alternative would be the
implosion and collapse of our
civilization.[5](http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end#en81)
In short, the Space Renaissance Initiative argues, society is undergoing
massive social, environmental, and population crises because it is
thinking too small. The energy of the sun can, for example, be made into
a source of clean power from outer space, which would solve society's
energy shortages at a stroke. The Initiative argues that opening up the
cosmos to humanity---colonizing the solar system, and opening up
resources in the moon, Mars, and the asteroids---could be central to
social and environmental salvation. The progress made by the private
sector in developing technologies and efficiencies for space tourism
means that commercial enterprise can now start planning to venture still
further afield. The philosophical roots of the Space Initiative are no
less than the sixteenth-century Italian Renaissance and the
Enlightenment. With the enlightened patronage of such families as the
Medicis, an unprecedented new age of development took place: arts knew a
wonderful age of innovation, culture took on some essential principles
of classical Greek philosophy, and modern science was born, with men
like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and later Copernicus and Galileo
leading the way. This movement led to the Age of Enlightenment and its
most famous offspring: the American and French Revolutions. The
manifesto also praises the writings of Descartes, Voltaire, and
Jefferson. The belief of these philosophers in the enterprising
individual, in freedom, in liberty, and in reason all mean that
political power should be vested in the common person and not in states,
kings, and nobility. The Space Renaissance Initiative believes in these
concepts, seeing them as the basis of a new, progressive, liberating,
humanization of the cosmos. But there are surely major problems here.
For example, any claim that the Medici family (and similar families such
as the Borgias) helped overthrow feudalism is far-fetched. The Medicis
were bankers and merchants who made their money at the center of an
emerging global mercantilist capitalism, one based in Northern Italy.
They used this money to enhance their position within their feudal
societies. Members of the Medicis even made themselves into popes, thus
further enhancing their wealth and that of their many illegitimate
offspring. Another of the Medicis was made the Queen of France. The
language used by intellectual elites of the day was Latin. This appealed
to scholars across Europe but not to the great mass of individuals
living in Florence, Milan, or
Venice.[6](http://monthlyreview.org/2010/11/01/the-humanization-of-the-cosmos-to-what-end#en80)
The Medicis and individuals such as Leonardo are often celebrated as
examples of "The Renaissance Universal Man," one capable of spanning
every kind of human practice such as art, music, and politics. This
"Man" is perhaps best symbolized by Leonardo's famous image of a male
human being, stretched over the circle of the cosmos, his head in the
heavens and his bowels located in earthly regions. But this Renaissance
Man---or Woman---can also be seen as prefiguring the self-centered,
narcissistic individualism of our own day, one seeing the whole of the
cosmos at his or her command. This kind of modern human identity has
since been enhanced by consumer-based capitalism and, given the problems
it creates both for ourselves and our environment, there seems rather
little reason to celebrate or restore it. The general point is that [the
vision of the Space Renaissance Initiative]{.underline}, with its prime
focus on the power of the supposedly autonomous and inventive
individual, [systematically omits questions of social, economic, and
military power]{.underline}. Similarly, [the Initiative's focus on the
apparently universal benefits of space humanization ignores some obvious
questions. What will ploughing large amounts of capital into outer space
colonization really do for stopping the exploitation of people and
resources back here on earth? The "solution" seems to be simultaneously
exacerbating social problems while jetting away from them. Consumer-led
industrial capitalism necessarily creates huge social divisions and
increasing degradation of the environment. Why should a galactic
capitalism do otherwise?]{.underline} The Space Renaissance Initiative
argues that space-humanization is necessarily a good thing for the
environment by introducing new space-based technologies such as massive
arrays of solar panels. But such "solutions" are again imaginary. [Cheap
electricity is most likely to increase levels of production and
consumption back on earth. Environmental degradation will be exacerbated
rather than diminished by this technological fix. A simplistic and
idealistic view of history, technology, and human agency therefore
underpins the starting point]{.underline} of the Space Renaissance
Initiative. [Humanization in this shape---one now finding favor in
official government circles---raises all kinds of highly problematic
issues for society and the environment.]{.underline} What would an
alternative, more critical, perspective on humanizing the cosmos tell
us?

Alami and Dixon (2021) emphasise that [**[contemporary]{.mark} state
[capitalism]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} best [conceptualised]{.mark}
systemically: [as]{.mark} a **world-historical**, variegated and
mutually reinforcing dynamic of [**proliferating state economic
interventions** aimed at fulfilling **economic and (geo)political
goals**. The]{.mark} intensifying [**rivalry** between the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark}**
[crucially]{.mark} [connects]{.mark} state capitalism with
geopolitics.]{.underline} China\'s party-state has deepened its
expansive reach across its political economy as competition has
intensified, both through the growing share of SOEs in the economy and
in deepening control over the private sector (Liu and Tsai, 2021,
Pearson et al., 2021). [Meanwhile, the United States has moved in a
similar direction]{.underline}, albeit within pre-existing ideological
constraints of its political system. Starrs and Germann (2021) [observe
[sweeping changes in]{.mark} (1) [the **US tariff regime**]{.mark},
designed to target Chinese imports in particular; (2) the **inward
[investment regime]{.mark}**, aimed restricting Chinese firms' access to
high-tech US companies; and (3) **[export regulations]{.mark}**, through
the use of technology export bans to target Chinese firms like ZTE
[and]{.mark} Huawei.]{.underline} Baltz (2022) [similarly discerns
heightened **[local procurement]{.mark} requirements** enacted through
the reformed implementation of the Buy American Act, alongside [evidence
for a growing]{.mark} consensus on the value of **state-led
investments** in **strategic technology development** and
**mission-oriented development projects** in areas such as supply-chain
reshoring and 5G provision.]{.underline} Despite these profound shifts,
the depth of Sino-US economic integration renders the cost of complete
decoupling prohibitive for both the United States and China (and for
third countries, many of which conduct a majority of trade with China
but rely upon US security guarantees) (Rosen and Gloudeman, 2021). [The
[**geopolitical** economy of]{.mark} the 'new state
[capitalism]{.mark}', then, far from generating autarchy, is instead
'characterized by **geopolitical-economic competition** [to integrate
territory]{.mark}' [into]{.mark} respective **[spheres of
influence]{.mark}** via connective infrastructure and logistics
networks]{.underline} (Schindler et al. (2021: 2) [[and]{.mark} to
[exert **greater control**]{.mark} over cross-**border economic
integration**]{.underline} (Liu and Dixon, 2021, Liu and Lim, 2022). The
most significant project in this regard is China\'s Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), which has extended China\'s reach across Eurasia,
Africa and Latin America through a sweeping range of state-backed
infrastructural investment and development financing (Gallagher, 2016,
Jepson, 2020, Lampton et al., 2020). The BRI has in turn prompted the
entry of the US government directly into the infrastructure financing
space with its Development Finance Corporation (Schindler and Kanai,
2021) and the nascent US-led G7 'Partnership for Global Infrastructure
and Investment' (PGII) infrastructure financing partnership. In this
way, the Sino-US conflict generates state capitalist imperatives far
beyond the borders of its two protagonists. A critical component of the
BRI is the 'Digital Silk Road', the objective of which is to expand the
influence of Chinese hardware and software platform firms overseas
through the provision and financing of digital infrastructures. The DSR
has completed projects valued at US\$79bn as of 2019, a mixture of the
Chinese state capital and investment from its private platform firms
(Cheney, 2021: 89). American commentators have begun to raise the alarm
at the speed of China\'s technological catch-up, asserting that Silicon
Valley\'s global leadership in digital technologies is under direct
threat. In language that echoes the hyperbole surrounding the Cold
War\'s supposed 'missile gap' and the space race, Hillman\'s (2021: 9)
analysis is illustrative: While American leaders were busy singing the
praises of connectivity, the United States was not investing enough in
actually connecting the world, including rural and lower-income
communities at home... But as Western firms raced to roll out high-speed
internet, they focused primarily on larger, richer markets, creating
digital divides... China turned these fault lines into runways for its
tech giants. Now they are cleared for takeoff. Until recently,
Hillman\'s notion that this competition represents a 'network war' that
the United States may lose would have been met with scepticism, given
the global reach and dominance of the United States 'digital empire'
(Nieborg et al., 2020). [But recognising the **growing presence** and
prowess of Chinese platforms, the United States has rapidly entered into
**direct competition** with these firms to secure the **dominance** of
its own national stack in third countries. Understanding the
significance of the '**network war**', however, requires close attention
to the novel business form at its centre: **the platform**.]{.underline}
Platforms [In this section, we demonstrate empirically how **platforms**
have become **increasingly important** to the US--China rivalry and
argue that they should be at the center of analyses of the 'new state
capitalism']{.underline}. For Alami et al. (2022), [**state [capitalist
practices]{.mark}** [are driven]{.mark} at the most fundamental level
[by]{.mark} state [responses to **technological**]{.mark} [**upheavals**
in]{.mark} the [context of]{.mark} long-run macroeconomic and
geographical shifts in [the world economy]{.mark}. Expansive [state
interventions]{.mark} are effectively [necessitated by]{.mark} the
[demands of]{.mark} '**[competing]{.mark}** in sectors [at the
**technological and productivity frontier**]{.mark} (5G technology, big
data, the internet of things, artificial intelligence and robotics)...
\[and\] ensuring the favourable participation of firms in global value
chains']{.underline} (Alami and Dixon, 2021: 18). Expanding on this
insight, we assert that [**state [capitalism]{.mark}** [is
animated]{.mark} not only [by the **rise of frontier
technologies**]{.mark} which compel more intensive forms of state
economic activity [but also]{.mark} that [this **technology-state
relationship**]{.mark} is]{.underline} (as it has historically been)
mediated by changing forms of business organisation (Bodrožić and Adler,
2022). Crucial in this regard is the emergence of the platform as a
novel form of business organisation (Davis, 2016, Vergne, 2020).
Platform studies have largely -- and erroneously, in our view --
conceived of platforms as effectively beyond the reach of, and
oppositional to, states. [By contrast, we argue that **platforms** are
amenable to **state oversight**, that they possess distinctive
affordances that make them **geopolitical agents**, and that both China
and the United States do indeed seek to **instrumentalise** and
**mobilise** platforms for geopolitical--economic ends. We refer to this
[growing **fusion between states and platforms**]{.mark} in the context
of geopolitical rivalry [as]{.mark} **state platform
[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} (SPC).

#### The "fear of China" is rooted in capitalism- America's fear of losing control over capital markets drives the theory that China is a threat.

**Lacy '12** (Dr Mark J. Lacy is a lecturer in the Department of
Politics and International Relations at Lancaster University, UK.

Realism PG 19-20)

However, it can be argued that the inclusion of China into the
architecture of the global economy (through bodies such as the World
Trade Organization (WTO). and investment by global corporations in
China) will lessen the chances of conflict (through bodies declares that
China's rulers "want to do business, and their highest priorities, by
far, are economic their adhesion to the World Trade Organization is the
surest indication that the want to be integrated into a capitalist world
economy 20 From this perspective, it could he argued that a China
included into the space of "globalization" will present less danger than
non-state actors, such as deterritorialized and flexible terrorist
networks. Although the Realist could point out that such a line of
argument is exactly what an intellectual such as Mearsheimer is trying
to protect us from as the sense of fear that people feel after 9/I
I---with its violent immediacy and visceral power---may lead politicians
to focus on sources of insecurity that are really not that dangerous for
the long term security of the state. A terrorist network could not have
access to the type of weapons of mass destruction that China has access
to states---by definition of their military capability---are still the
main agents of destruction on the geopolitical scene. Of course
the [Realist may argue that China plays by the rules of the capitalist
system because they are means to an end]{.underline}---but what happens
when it becomes a peer competitor. From the Offensive Realist
perspective, [this is the underworld to the "optimistic" vision of
liberal theorists who argue that enlargement of the spaces of economy
and democracy will lead to order and progress in international
affairs]{.underline}.

[Fear of China]{.underline} is not unique to Mearsheimer's work on
Offensive Realism and it **[is a discourse of danger that
circulates]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** **[many
areas]{.underline}** **[where]{.underline}** **[the future
of]{.underline}** **[security and]{.underline}** **[the

debated]{.underline}**, [This]{.underline} [fear of China in the
contemporary political imaginary of]{.underline} Europe and [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [appears to stem from an
awareness by the "developed" of the power of capitalism and technology
to unleash huge changes in society]{.underline} (creating a condition of
"everlasting uncertainty." as Marx and Engels put it). [It stems from
the view that in]{.underline} Europe and [the U]{.underline}nited
States [there are moral limits imposed on the market civilization of
liberal democracy]{.underline} (although these moral limits may become
flexible outside of the "core"). As Max Weber put it the "inner attitude
of the adventurer that laughs at all ethical limitation is
universal"2' **[the]{.underline}** **[fear]{.underline}** **[of
China]{.underline}** **[emerges from]{.underline}** **[the sense that
a]{.underline}** **[capitalist China competing in a global economy will
unleash the power of the market without]{.underline}** **[an sense
of]{.underline}** **[ethical limitation]{.underline}**. In this sense,
commentators from both Left and Right fear a territory where 1.3 billion
individuals are willing to work for low pay as in a zone where "even
thing is permitted" The Economist comments that China has an
"inexhaustible supply of workers, willing to work long hours for
pitifully low pay." In November 2002 Wired, a magazine that
celebrates---some would say fetishizes---the vision of an information
age driven by free markets and a borderless economy, published an
article on "The I lot zone" "An untamed technology boom is sweeping
through China's Pearl River Delta, where cheap labor, mass production,
police thugs and get-rich-quick dreams rule. It's a terrible, Horrible,
lawless frontier. And it works." [The fear of China is combined with a
perverse fascination]{.underline}---and maybe even admiration---[for the
'unrefined" market free from liberal concerns]{.underline} and maybe
this is what scares Mearsheimer: a population that does not hold the
"deep-seated" optimism and liberalism of the United
States. **[This]{.underline}** **[fear of "unrefined"
capitalism]{.underline}** **[is what]{.underline}** **[lies at the
core]{.underline}** **[of these views of China]{.underline}**, **[a fear

Another important aspect of the colonial project in Inuit Nunaat (and,
in fact, in many other colonized regions), brilliantly explored in
Demuth's work, is the remodelling of the relation between humanity and
nature in colonized spaces. Be it with land, the sea, sea ice or
animals, [[capitalism as a **mode of production**]{.underline}]{.mark},
and neo-extractivism as a path of economic development under such
system, [[demand]{.mark} the [construction of an instrumental]{.mark}
[relation to]{.mark} these **[non-human elements]{.mark}** [of the
**environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This understanding entails a
relation]{.underline} between human and non-human nature developed
[under the **mediation** of **value**]{.underline} and valorisation --
[the main goals of [capital **accumulation**]{.mark} and **economic

and temporality **[[of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
([**[capitalist]{.underline}**) **[economic
practices]{.underline}**]{.mark}. While Demuth discusses how Beringian
cultures in general did not have stark distinctions between humanity and
non-humanity, Shadian, on the other hand, highlights how such relations,
among the Inuit are expressed through the concept of inua. Rather than
seeing man as a separate of and dominating nature, [Inuit populations
understood **themselves** not only as **part of nature**, but also as
being **stewards** of the non-**human nature** and of their]{.underline}
homelands [and home-environments.]{.underline}

In the present text we focused on how Arctic colonialisms came to be and
the technologies they employed in the attempt of disarticulating Inuit
livelihoods, their social and cultural practices; this is not the only
history to be told. The Inuit -- and, in fact Indigenous peoples in the
Arctic and in the world -- have a long history of resistance to and
struggle against colonialism. The Inuit Circumpolar Council is an
institution born of such efforts and, to this day, it disputes the
contents and objectives of Arctic policies through the development of
its own political instruments and Arctic policies in many dimensions.
Rejecting the acritical acceptance of policies based on settler-colonial
understandings of Arctic geopolitics and economic development, the ICC
articulates understandings of autonomy, self-government and economic
development other than those deployed by settler-colonial, capitalist,
westphalian States.

[**[Understanding colonialisms]{.mark}** and their development [is an
**important step** in]{.mark} [reckoning with the **colonial

inform]{.underline} [future debates on Arctic]{.underline} geopolitics
and economic [development]{.underline}. While such struggles put in
question the Euro-American definitions of economic development,
sovereignty and self-government, they were also invested in the
construction of alternative understandings and alternative social
practices. [[Unearthing such understandings]{.underline}]{.mark} and
their impact over present-day Arctic Indigenous policies, [[as

### Alt -- Radical Resilience

#### The alt is RADICAL RESILIENCE---it counters the social inequity and environmental abuse of capitalism

[[The]{.mark} theoretical [framework of radical resilience]{.mark}
[retains many of resilience]{.mark} thinking'[s core concepts]{.mark}
and metaphors.]{.underline} The unit of study is still social-ecological
systems, as defined by researchers. Systems are still described in terms
of their persistence, adaptability, and transformability. Models such as
the adaptive cycle and panarchy are still utilized to conceptualize
change over space and time. [The difference [in radical
resilience]{.mark} is that it [brings]{.mark} into resilience research
and politics [an epistemological lineage that explicitly questions the
ideology of neoliberal capitalism]{.mark} - it brings a type of
skepticism or criticality around exploitative systems of production and
consumption that resilience thinking has largely lacked. [In radical
resilience, the relationship between capitalism and social-ecological
systems becomes a subject to study]{.mark} and evaluations, rather than
an assumed, or naturalized, structure of the system. To achieve these
goals, radical resilience must use vocabulary from radical political
economy to shape its research questions]{.underline}. A quote from
Robbins (2004) exemplifies the type of vocabulary that resilience needs
to incorporate to become more radical. He writes, "[[No explanation of
environmental change is complete]{.mark}.. .[without serious attention
to who profits from changes in control]{.mark} over resources,
[and]{.mark} without exploring [who takes what from
whom]{.mark}"]{.underline} (p. 75). While environmental change is
obviously within the purview of resilience thinking, it would be very
surprising for a resilience scholar to write about social agents taking
or profiting from one another in the way that Robbins 31 uses the terms.
[When [resilience thinkers]{.mark} want to indicate that something is
wrong with a system, they tend to use terms such as undesirable system
state and lock-in trap, but these terms [obscure the human
agency]{.mark} that is ultimately [responsible for the condition being
analyzed]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This issue goes back to the
critique discussed earlier about resilience thinking's tendency to
naturalize processes that lead to [[social inequity and environmental
degradation]{.mark} that [are]{.mark} actually [caused by human choice,
and therefore avoidabl]{.mark}]{.underline}[e.]{.mark} Turner (2014)
attributes resilience's hesitancy to think critically about the social
dimension of social-ecological systems to its claim to objectivity. He
writes, "Ecologists may feel that as biophysical scientists they escape
the 'bias' that plagues much of social science"; but Turner expresses
skepticism in that claim when he adds, "\[T\]he choice of the
appropriate parameter become particularly difficult and dare I say,
normative, for open socio-ecological systems" (p. 620). Turner also
suggests that [the human struggle, pain, and injustice that is endured
by some groups as social-ecological systems adapt and transform, are
abstracted and largely ignored in resilience-based
modeling]{.underline}. This unwillingness to engage difficult topics,
Turner continues, has led to a "disturbing voyeurism - coming too close,
for many social scientists, to social Darwinism" (p. 621). Turner's
criticism [suggests a need for academic resilience thinking to overcome
its normative reluctance]{.underline}. Table 1.1 presents the
contrasting approaches to social-ecological systems and the resultant
outcomes of three schools of thought - capitalism, conventional
resilience thinking, and radical resilience. [[Radical
resilience,]{.mark} drawing on Marxism, [posits that the social inequity
inherent in capitalism]{.mark} is something that [society has a moral
obligation to avoid]{.mark}]{.underline} (Harvey, 1982, 1996; Smith,
1984). Drawing on eco-Marxism, [[radical resilience posits that society
also has a moral obligation to avoid the unsustainable environmental
degradation caused by capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} (Foster 1999,
2002; 32 O'Connor, 1988). However, tempered by post-Marxist theory
(Gibson-Graham, 1996), radical resilience is not purely anti-capitalist,
but instead seeks to explore the relationship between capitalist and
non-capitalist values and material outcomes and analyze what this means
for the resilience of social-ecological systems. [[Under radical
resilience, society has a moral obligation to provide care for other
human and non-human lifeforms]{.underline}]{.mark}. A radical resilience
research agenda includes the following questions (which I return to in
the dissertation's Conclusion): • What are the key social-ecological
dynamics of the given system? • Who benefits from the arrangement, at
what scale, and how much? • Who suffers from the arrangement, at what
scale, and how much? • Is power equitably distributed in this
arrangement? • In this context, [what should be made resilient to what
and for whom]{.underline}? Having proposed this framework for
understanding and steering Arctic change, the next three chapters of
this dissertation present empirical studies of existing and possible
future industrialization processes in northern Alaska, focusing
respectively on the three sectors of tourism, natural resource
extraction, and shipping. In the Conclusion I interpret the case study
data through the lens of radical resilience to address the main research
question: How is the global capitalist system affecting the
social-ecological resilience of Indigenous communities in northern
Alaska as the Arctic continues to industrialize?

and]{.underline} [quantitative expansion]{.underline} (which, as Marx
shows, is a destructive progress[), it advocates policies founded on
**non-monetary**]{.underline} **[criteria]{.underline}**, such as social
needs, individual well-being, and ecological equilibrium.
[Ecosocialism]{.underline} [puts forth a **critique**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} both mainstream "[market ecology]{.underline}," [which
does not **challenge**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} capitalist
**[system]{.underline}**, and "productivist socialism," which ignores
natural limits.

As people increasingly realize how the economic and ecological crises
intertwine, ecosocialism has been gaining adherents. Ecosocialism, as a
movement, is relatively new, but some of its basic arguments date back
to the writings of Marx and Engels. Now, intellectuals and activists are
recovering this legacy and seeking a radical restructuring of the
economy according to the principles of democratic ecological planning,
putting human and planetary needs first and foremost.

The "actually existing socialisms" of the twentieth century, with their
often environmentally oblivious bureaucracies, do not offer an
attractive model for today's ecosocialists. Rather, we must chart a new
path forward, one that links with the myriad movements around the globe
that share the conviction that a better world is not only possible, but
also necessary.

[Democratic **Ecological Planning**]{.underline}

The core of [**[ecosocialism]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the concept of [democratic]{.mark} ecological]{.underline}
**[[planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [wherein [the **population
itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [not]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[the
market]{.underline}**" or [a]{.underline} **[Politburo]{.underline}**,
[make]{.underline} the main [decisions about the economy]{.underline}.
Early in the Great Transition to this new way of life, [with its
new]{.underline} [mode of **production**]{.underline} and consumption,
some sectors of [[the **economy**]{.underline} [must
be]{.underline}]{.mark} suppressed (e.g., the extraction of fossil fuels
implicated in the climate crisis) or
**[[restructured]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while new sectors are
developed. Economic [transformation must be accompanied by]{.underline}
active [pursuit of full employment]{.underline} [with **equal
conditions**]{.underline} [of work and wages]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} **[egalitarian vision]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[essential]{.underline}** both for building a just society and for
engaging the support of the working class for the structural
transformation of the productive forces.

Ultimately, [such [a vision is **irreconcilable** with **private
control**]{.mark} of the means of **production** and of the **planning**
process. In particular, [for **investments**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[tech]{.mark}**nological]{.underline} [[innovation to]{.underline}
[serve]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[common good]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[decision-making must be taken away]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the
banks and **[capitalist enterprises]{.underline}** that currently
dominate, [and put in the **public domain**]{.underline}. Then,
**[society itself]{.underline}**, and [neither]{.underline} a small
[oligarchy]{.underline} of property owners [nor an **elite of
techno-bureaucrats**]{.underline}, [will]{.underline} democratically
[decide which]{.underline} productive [lines are to be
**privileged**]{.underline}, and how resources are to be invested in
education, health, and culture. Major decisions on investment
priorities---such as terminating all coal-fired facilities or directing
agricultural subsidies to organic production---would be taken by direct
popular vote. Other, less important decisions would be taken by elected
bodies, on the relevant national, regional, or local scale.

Although conservatives fearmonger about "central planning," democratic
ecological planning ultimately supports more freedom, not less, for
several reasons. First, it offers liberation from the reified "economic
laws" of the capitalist system that shackle individuals in what Max
Weber called an "iron cage." Prices of goods would not be left to the
"laws of supply and demand," but would, instead, reflect social and
political priorities, with the use of taxes and subsidies to incentivize
social goods and disincentivize social ills. Ideally, as the
ecosocialist transition moves forward, more products and services
critical for meeting fundamental human needs would be freely
distributed, according to the will of the citizens.

Second, ecosocialism heralds a substantial increase in free time.
Planning and the reduction of labor time are the two decisive steps
towards what Marx called "the kingdom of freedom." A significant
increase of free time is, in fact, a condition for the participation of
working people in the democratic discussion and management of economy
and of society.

Last, democratic ecological planning represents a whole society's
exercise of its freedom to control the decisions that affect its
destiny. If the democratic ideal would not grant political
decision-making power to a small elite, why should the same principle
not apply to economic decisions? Under capitalism, use-value---the worth
of a product or service to well-being---exists only in the service of
exchange-value, or value on the market. Thus, [many **products** in
contemporary]{.underline} **[society]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
socially **[useless]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} [designed for rapid
turnover]{.underline} ("**[planned obsolescence]{.underline}**"). [By
contrast, in a **planned** ecosocialist **economy**]{.underline},
[use-value would be the **only criteria** for the
**production**]{.underline} of goods and services, [with
**far-reaching** economic]{.underline}, social, and ecological
**[consequences]{.underline}**.1

[Planning would focus on]{.underline} large-scale [economic
**decisions**]{.underline}, [not the **small-scale ones**]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} might [affect]{.underline} local restaurants,
groceries, small shops, or artisan [enterprises]{.underline}.
Importantly, such planning is consistent with workers' self-management
of their productive units. The decision, for example, to transform a
plant from producing automobiles to producing buses and trams would be
taken by society as a whole, but the internal organization and
functioning of the enterprise would be democratically managed by its
workers. There has been much discussion about the "centralized" or
"decentralized" character of planning, but most important is democratic
control at all levels---local, regional, national, continental, or
international. For example, planetary ecological issues such as global
warming must be dealt with on a global scale, and thereby require some
form of global democratic planning. This nested, democratic
decision-making is quite the opposite of what is usually described,
often dismissively, as "central planning," since decisions are not taken
by any "center," but democratically decided by the affected population
at the appropriate scale.

Democratic and pluralist debate would occur at all levels. Through
parties, platforms, or other political movements, varied propositions
would be submitted to the people, and delegates would be elected
accordingly. However, representative democracy must be
complemented---and corrected---by Internet-enabled direct democracy,
through which people choose---at the local, national, and, later, global
level---among major social and ecological options. Should public
transportation be free? Should the owners of private cars pay special
taxes to subsidize public transportation? Should solar energy be
subsidized in order to compete with fossil energy? Should the work week
be reduced to 30 hours, 25 hours, or less, with the attendant reduction
of production?

Such democratic planning needs expert input, but its role is
educational, to present informed views on alternative outcomes for
consideration by popular decision-making processes. What guarantee is
there that the people will make ecologically sound decisions? None.
Ecosocialism wagers that democratic decisions will become increasingly
reasoned and enlightened as culture changes and the grip of commodity
fetishism is broken. One cannot imagine such a new society without the
achievement, through struggle, self-education, and social experience, of
a high level of socialist and ecological consciousness. In any case, are
not the alternatives---the blind market or an ecological dictatorship of
"experts"---much more dangerous?

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} **[Great [Transition]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} **[capitalist]{.underline}** destructive
**[progress]{.underline}** [to **ecosocialism**]{.underline} [is a
**historical** process]{.underline}, a [permanent
**revolutionary**]{.underline} **[transformation]{.underline}** [of
**society**]{.underline}, culture, [and **mindsets**]{.underline}.
[Enacting [this]{.mark} transition [leads]{.mark} not only to a **new**
mode of **production**]{.underline} [and an egalitarian and democratic
**society**]{.underline}, but [also [to an **alternative**]{.mark} mode
of **life**]{.underline}, [a new **[ecosocialist
civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [beyond]{.underline} the reign of
[money]{.underline}, beyond [consumption]{.underline} habits
artificially [produced by advertising]{.underline}, and
[[beyond]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[unlimited
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}** of commodities that are useless
and/or harmful to the environment. Such a transformative process depends
on the active support of the vast majority of the population for an
ecosocialist program. The decisive factor in development of socialist
consciousness and ecological awareness is the collective experience of
struggle, from local and partial confrontations to the radical change of
global society as a whole.

The Growth Question

The issue of economic growth has divided socialists and
environmentalists. Ecosocialism, however, rejects the dualistic frame of
growth versus degrowth, development versus anti-development, because
both positions share a purely quantitative conception of productive
forces. A third position resonates more with the task ahead: the
qualitative transformation of development.

A new development paradigm means putting an end to the egregious waste
of resources under capitalism, driven by large-scale production of
useless and harmful products. The arms industry is, of course, a
dramatic example, but, more generally, the primary purpose of many of
the "goods" produced---with their planned obsolescence---is to generate
profit for large corporations. The issue is not excessive consumption in
the abstract, but the prevalent type of consumption, based as it is on
massive waste and the conspicuous and compulsive pursuit of novelties
promoted by "fashion." A new society would orient production towards the
satisfaction of authentic needs, including water, food, clothing,
housing, and such basic services as health, education, transport, and
culture.

Obviously, the countries of the Global South, where these needs are very
far from being satisfied, must pursue greater classical
"development"---railroads, hospitals, sewage systems, and other
infrastructure. Still, rather than emulate how affluent countries built
their productive systems, these countries can pursue development in far
more environmentally friendly ways, including the rapid introduction of
renewable energy. While many poorer countries will need to expand
agricultural production to nourish hungry, growing populations, the
ecosocialist solution is to promote agroecology methods rooted in family
units, cooperatives, or larger-scale collective farms---not the
destructive industrialized agribusiness methods involving intensive
inputs of pesticides, chemicals, and GMOs.2

At the same time, the ecosocialist transformation would end the heinous
debt system the Global South now confronts as well as the exploitation
of its resources by advanced industrial countries and rapidly developing
countries like China. Instead, we can envision a strong flow of
technical and economic assistance from North to South rooted in a robust
sense of solidarity and the recognition that planetary problems require
planetary solutions. This need not entail that people in affluent
countries "reduce their standard of living"---only that they shun the
obsessive consumption, induced by the capitalist system, of useless
commodities that do not meet real needs or contribute to human
well-being and flourishing.

But how do we distinguish authentic from artificial and
counterproductive needs? To a considerable degree, the latter are
stimulated by the mental manipulation of advertising. In contemporary
capitalist societies, the advertising industry has invaded all spheres
of life, shaping everything from the food we eat and the clothes we wear
to sports, culture, religion, and politics. Promotional advertising has
become ubiquitous, insidiously infesting our streets, landscapes, and
traditional and digital media, molding habits of conspicuous and
compulsive consumption. Moreover, the ad industry itself is a source of
considerable waste of natural resources and labor time, ultimately paid
by the consumer, for a branch of "production" that lies in direct
contradiction with real social-ecological needs. While indispensable to
the capitalist market economy, the advertising industry would have no
place in a society in transition to ecosocialism; it would be replaced
by consumer associations that vet and disseminate information on goods
and services. While these changes are already happening to some extent,
old habits would likely persist for some years, and nobody has the right
to dictate peoples' desires. Altering patterns of consumption is an
ongoing educational challenge within a historical process of cultural
change.

A fundamental premise of ecosocialism is that in a society without sharp
class divisions and capitalist alienation, "being" will take precedence
over "having." Instead of seeking endless goods, people pursue greater
free time, and the personal achievements and meaning it can bring
through cultural, athletic, recreational, scientific, erotic, artistic,
and political activities. There is no evidence that compulsive
acquisitiveness stems from intrinsic "human nature," as conservative
rhetoric suggests. Rather, it is induced by the commodity fetishism
inherent in the capitalist system, by the dominant ideology, and by
advertising. Ernest Mandel summarizes this critical point well: "The
continual accumulation of more and more goods \[...\] is by no means a
universal and even predominant feature of human behavior. The
development of talents and inclinations for their own sake; the
protection of health and life; care for children; the development of
rich social relations \[...\] become major motivations once basic
material needs have been satisfied." 3

Of course, even a classless society faces conflict and contradiction.
[The **transition**]{.underline} to ecosocialism [would confront
**tensions**]{.underline} between the requirements of protecting the
environment and meeting social needs, between ecological imperatives and
the development of basic infrastructure, between popular consumer habits
and the scarcity of resources, between communitarian and cosmopolitan
impulses. [Struggles]{.underline} among competing [desiderata are
inevitable]{.underline}. Hence, **[weighing]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[balancing]{.underline}** [such]{.underline}
[interests must become the task of a **democratic planning
process**]{.underline}, [liberated from the **imperatives**]{.underline}
[of **capital**]{.underline} and profit-making, to come up with
solutions through transparent, plural, and open public discourse. Such
participatory democracy at all levels does not mean that there will not
be mistakes, but it allows for the self-correction by the members of the
social collectivity of its own mistakes.

Intellectual Roots

Although ecosocialism is a fairly recent phenomenon, its intellectual
roots can be traced back to Marx and Engels. Because environmental
issues were not as salient in the nineteenth century as in our era of
incipient ecological catastrophe, these concerns did not play a central
role in Marx and Engels's works. Nevertheless, their writings use
arguments and concepts vital to the connection between capitalist
dynamics and the destruction of the natural environment, and to the
development of a socialist and ecological alternative to the prevailing
system.

Some passages in Marx and Engels (and certainly in the dominant Marxist
currents that followed) do embrace an uncritical stance toward the
productive forces created by capital, treating the "development of
productive forces" as the main factor in human progress. However, Marx
was radically opposed to what we now call "productivism"--- the
capitalist logic by which the accumulation of capital, wealth, and
commodities becomes an end in itself. The fundamental idea of a
socialist economy---in contrast to the bureaucratic caricatures that
prevailed in the "socialist" experiments of the twentieth century---is
to produce use-values, goods that are necessary for the satisfaction of
human needs, well-being, and fulfillment. The central feature of
technical progress for Marx was not the indefinite growth of products
("having") but the reduction of socially necessary labor and concomitant
increase of free time ("being").4 Marx\'s emphasis on communist
self-development, on free time for artistic, erotic, or intellectual
activities---in contrast to the capitalist obsession with the
consumption of more and more material goods---implies a decisive
reduction of pressure on the natural environment.5

Beyond the presumed benefit for the environment, a key Marxian
contribution to socialist ecological thinking is attributing to
capitalism a metabolic rift---i.e., a disruption of the material
exchange between human societies and the natural environment. The issue
is discussed, inter alia, in a well-known passage of Capital:

Capitalist production \[\...\] disturbs the metabolic interaction
between man and the earth, i.e., prevents the return to the soil of its
constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing;
hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural conditions for the
lasting fertility of the soil. \[\...\] All progress in capitalist
agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker,
but of robbing the soil \[\...\]. The more a country \[\...\] develops
itself on the basis of great industry, the more this process of
destruction takes place quickly. Capitalist production \[\...\] only
develops \[\...\] by simultaneously undermining the original sources of
all wealth---the soil and the worker.6

This important passage clarifies Marx's dialectical vision of the
contradictions of "progress" and its destructive consequences for nature
under capitalist conditions. The example, of course, is limited to the
loss of fertility by the soil. But on this basis, Marx draws the broad
insight that capitalist production embodies a tendency to undermine the
"eternal natural conditions." From a similar vantage, Marx reiterates
his more familiar argument that the same predatory logic of capitalism
exploits and debases workers.

While most contemporary ecosocialists are inspired by Marx's insights,
ecology has become far more central to their analysis and action. During
the 1970s and 1980s in Europe and the US, an ecological socialism began
to take shape. Manuel Sacristan, a Spanish dissident-Communist
philosopher, founded the ecosocialist and feminist journal Mientras
Tanto in 1979, introducing the dialectical concept of
"destructive-productive forces." Raymond Williams, a British socialist
and founder of modern cultural studies, became one of the first in
Europe to call for an "ecologically conscious socialism" and is often
credited with coining the term "ecosocialism" itself. André Gorz, a
French philosopher and journalist, argued that political ecology must
contain a critique of economic thought and called for an ecological and
humanist transformation of work. Barry Commoner, an American biologist,
argued that the capitalist system and its technology---and not
population growth---was responsible for the destruction of the
environment, which led him to the conclusion that "some sort of
socialism" was the realistic alternative.7

In the 1980s, James O'Connor founded the influential journal Capitalism,
Nature and Socialism, which was inspired by his idea of the "second
contradiction of capitalism." In this formulation, the first
contradiction is the Marxist one between the forces and relations of
production; the second contradiction lies between the mode of production
and the "conditions of production," especially, the state of the
environment.

A new generation of eco-Marxists appeared in the 2000s, including John
Bellamy Foster and others around the journal Monthly Review, who further
developed the Marxian concept of metabolic rift between human societies
and the environment. In 2001, Joel Kovel and the present author issued
"An Ecosocialist Manifesto," which was further developed by the same
authors, together with Ian Angus, in the 2008 Belem Ecosocialist
Manifesto, which was signed by hundreds of people from forty countries
and distributed at the World Social Forum in 2009. It has since become
an important reference for ecosocialists around the world.8

Why Environmentalists Need to Be Socialists

As these and other authors have shown, capitalism is incompatible with a
sustainable future. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} **[capitalist
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an economic growth machine propelled by
fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution[, [is a]{.mark} primary
**[culprit]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[climate]{.underline}** change [and]{.underline}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} wider **[ecological
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** on Earth. [Its]{.underline} irrational
[logic of endless **expansion**]{.underline} and accumulation, waste of
resources, ostentatious consumption, planned obsolescence, and pursuit
of profit at any cost is [driving the planet to the **brink of the
abyss**]{.underline}.

[[Does]{.underline}]{.mark} "green capitalism"---the strategy of
**[[reducing environment]{.mark}al impact]{.underline}**
[while]{.underline} **[[maintain]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** dominant
**[economic [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**[---[offer
a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[solution]{.underline}]{.mark}**? [[The
**implausibility** of]{.mark} such a]{.underline} **[[Policy
Reform]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}** [[is seen]{.mark} most vividly
[in the failure of]{.mark} a quarter-century of international
**[conferences]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
effectively [[address]{.mark} climate]{.underline}
**[[change]{.underline}]{.mark}**.9 [The]{.underline} political [[forces
committed to the **capitalist**]{.mark} "market
**[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [that have created the problem
**[cannot be the]{.mark} source of the [solution]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For example, at the 2015 Paris climate conference, many countries
resolved to make serious efforts to keep average global temperature
increases below 2o C (ideally, they agreed, below 1.5o C).
Correspondingly, they volunteered to implement measures to reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions. However, they put no enforcement mechanisms in
place nor any consequences for noncompliance, hence no guarantee that
any country will keep its word. The US, the world's second-highest
emitter of carbon emissions, is now run by a climate denier who pulled
the US out of the agreement. Even if all countries did meet their
commitments, the global temperature would rise by 3o C or more, with
great risk of dire, irreversible climate change.10

Ultimately, [the fatal flaw of **green capitalism**]{.underline} [lies
in the conflict between the micro-**rationality**]{.underline} of [the
capitalist **market**]{.underline}, with its [short-sighted calculation
of **profit** and **loss**,]{.underline} [and the macro-rationality of
**collective action** for]{.underline} the **[common
good]{.underline}**. The blind [logic of the market]{.underline} resists
a **[rapid]{.underline}** energy **[transformation]{.underline}** [away
from fossil fuel dependence]{.underline} in [intrinsic
**contradiction**]{.underline} of **[ecological
rationality]{.underline}**. [[The point is not to indict]{.mark}
"**[bad]{.mark}**" ecocidal [capitalists, as opposed to]{.mark}
"**good**]{.underline}" **[[green capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
[[the fault lies in a **system**]{.mark} rooted in **ruthless
competition**]{.underline} and a race for short-term profit that
destroys nature's balance. The environmental challenge---to build an
alternative system that reflects the common good in its institutional
DNA---becomes inextricably linked to the socialist challenge.

### Alt -- Aesthetics

#### Only a pragmatic shift in how we view aesthetics can challenge the destruction of the arctic

[[A paradigm shift in ruin aesthetics]{.mark} and material ruination [is
occurring]{.mark} in the Anthropocene. First, ruins are
[shifting]{.mark} from the built [to the natural environment]{.mark} as
the carbon-intensive infrastructures of global capitalism undermine
nature's foundations.]{.underline} Whereas infrastructural ruins once
lingered on the landscape, many ruins of the Anthropocene like the
Earth's icy edges will not last, at least in certain sea- sons.
[[Ruination is]{.mark} also [accelerating]{.mark} and scaling up to
encompass [the]{.mark} planet. Entire [regions]{.mark} risk losing their
[ecological underpinnings]{.mark}, [challenging the basis for how they
are]{.mark} both [imagined]{.mark} and inhabited as places. Second, by
emphasizing the picturesque [and]{.mark} sub- lime, Anthropocene ruin
aesthetics [exacerbate the problem]{.mark}s of Romantic and modern
ruin-gazing.]{.underline} Whereas ruin appreciation in Manchester or
Chernobyl risks voyeurism, consuming imagery of elegiac icebergs and
nearly-swimming sled dogs might hasten climate change if such
visualizations condone passivity rather than action. Refocusing
narratives on the beautiful and promoting a compre- hensible rather than
extraordinary aesthetics could more effectively inspire action on
climate change. Surprisingly, pop music is one place where the beau-
tiful is making itself heard, if not seen. In the absence of optics, it
might be easier for the beautiful to transcend the sublime and the
inherently visual picturesque. Elevating the beautiful could also find
inspiration within Antiquity's early explorations of philosophical
aesthetics, which associated the quality with order, harmony, and
balance (Diessner 2019)--- all attributes of a planet in sync. The
representations of the Anthropocene described in this article reflect a
worldview emblem- atic of Western media and pop culture while margin-
alizing many others. Even the epoch's name, "in its reassertion of
universality... implicitly aligns itself with the colonial era" (Davis
and Todd 2017, 763). Nevertheless, critiquing Anthropocene aesthetics---
an "unintended supplement to imperial aesthetics" (Mirzoeff 2014,
220)---can help reveal how to influ- ence those most invested with the
power to alter planetary conditions. [This is imperative because
although "not every human is responsible for bring- ing on the
Anthropocene, every human is destined to live in it" (Hamilton 2017,
77). To more fully represent the wide range of Anthropocene aesthetics,
scholars should equally address how the peo- ple living within the
landscapes, icescapes, and seascapes represented as ruins interpret such
visual- izations. Future [research should]{.mark} also [heed]{.mark} the
alternative and subaltern stories they tell about their homes. [The
emergence of]{.mark} subfields such as the geohumanities and
environmental humanities points to the growing convergence of
[geographical, environmental, and artistic concerns]{.mark} in the
Anthropocene.]{.underline} Interventions at this nexus might offer a
chance to build a more radical Anthropocene aesthetics, for art in its
truest sense constitutes not just a"radical political act" offering
alternative sociopolitical con- figurations (Tuan 1989, 239). It can be
a radical environmental act, too, which serves to realize the
commensurability between art and nature for which Dewey hoped.
[[Diversifying]{.mark} Anthropocene [aesthetics might produce]{.mark}
livelier, more [sensitive depictions of a climatically altered
planet]{.mark} whose most vulnerable places are often still inhabited.
[Fostering an effective]{.mark} as opposed to affective
[aesthetic]{.mark}s in the Anthropocene **[might]{.mark} also [increase
the possibility that these places will remain so.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Prior Question -- Historical Materialism

#### Objectivity and historical materialism are necessary methods for survival \-\-- the aff's literary analysis is depoliticizing and lacks the basis for emancipatory movements. 

**Aldama 8**---Arts & Humanities Distinguished Professor at Ohio State
University \[Frederick Luis, *Why the Humanities Matter: A Commonsense
Approach*, University of Texas Press, p. xiv-xiii\]

For me to bear this statement out, I ask for some anecdotal indulgence.
Invited to give a lecture on diasporic literature at a university in
Switzerland, I suggested that we begin to look past poststructuralist
paradigms in our analysis of Latin American, U.S. ethnic, and South
Asian postcolonial literature and move forward to the use of tools
provided by narratology and cognitive science-not exclusively, though
centrally-to explore how authors creatively reframe identities and
experiences that are located within postcolonial literary traditions and
engage readers belonging not only to those traditions but also to many
other, quite different ones. In this context, I suggested too that the
study of postcolonial literature would find it conceptually useful (and
scientifically interesting) to proceed within a world literature
paradigm. I proposed that we keep in mind that [[literary
analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} is as capacious as literature itself in
that it may contain all kinds of approaches and evaluations,
[including]{.underline}, of course, [political assessments; but no
matter how much meaning and]{.underline} \[END PAGE XIV\] [performative
theories may be stretched]{.underline} or curtailed on a Procrustean
bed, a work of fiction, a book review, or a [literary theory dealing
with politics [can **never** become the same]{.mark} animal [as]{.mark}
an **[organized]{.mark}**, actual doing of
**[politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. (For instance, Louis-Ferdinand
Celine\'s or Paul de Man\'s wartime pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic articles
drew their efficaciousness not from themselves but from the social,
political, economic, and military barbarism they were supporting as it
was spreading and vanquishing along with the deployment of Hitler\'s,
Mussolini\'s, and Hirohito\'s troops.) Also, I indicated that [[the self
is **not**]{.mark} [a conceptual construct]{.mark} designed on a blank
slate, [but a **material agency** capable of **modifying
reality**]{.mark} and being modified by it in specific circumstances
located in time and space]{.underline}. [I]{.underline} therefore
[suggested]{.underline} that [the approach]{.underline} I advocate
offers interesting means for the advancement of our literary and
humanistic endeavors because it is [based on hypotheses that are
susceptible to empirical verification or refutation and it allows for
true research programs]{.underline}. Therefore, I reminded my audience
that **[[history is paramount]{.underline}]{.mark}** for us. [Cosmology,
physics, molecular biology, genetics, paleontology, psychology,
sociology, economics, history, and]{.underline} most [other scientific
disciplines deal with time, change, and evolution and are]{.underline}
thus [in a strict sense historical disciplines]{.underline}. In the case
of the human subject and of humanity as a whole, [all sciences show that
humans are inseparably both the products and the shapers of their
bio-social-psychological-historical existence]{.underline}. Following
many others before me, I made evident that [it is scientifically
rewarding to acknowledge the fact that [since the]{.mark} ancient
[division of society into **antagonistic social
classes**]{.mark}]{.underline} (masters and slaves, for instance), [[the
**struggle against oppression**]{.mark} and exploitation [has never
ceased]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Today, [such a division takes the]{.mark} specifically historical [form
of a **system of class rule** based on the private ownership of]{.mark}
the main means of [production]{.mark}]{.underline} (held by a tiny
minority of families) [[and]{.mark} the **[exploitation]{.mark}** of the
vast majority of the planet\'s inhabitants]{.underline}. Because of
[[the **barbarism**]{.mark} this system increasingly [generates]{.mark}
([the gigantic slaughters of]{.mark} two [world wars, Hiroshima and
Nagasaki, Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Iraq]{.mark} are
but a few of its manifestations), [the very **survival of the human race
is at stake**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[humankind **must continue the
struggle** to achieve a classless society]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is,
a society [in which the world\'s population is free from oppression and
exploitation because all wealth is no longer produced, distributed,
exchanged, and consumed according to the ever-insatiable profit-making
and capital-accumulation prerequisites of capitalist
society]{.underline}. I thus recalled that while all humans share a
cognitive and emotive architecture that emerged even before we began our
\[END PAGE X\] journey as Homo sapiens sapiens, each member of our
species is unique in the way she uses this universal endowment as well
as in how she participates in the transformation of nature and society.
There are certainly genetic and psychological factors involved in the
love of cruelty and violence by some, but the evidence shows that those
[proclivities become actions]{.underline} most frequently [in social
environments that encourage them]{.underline}. I think of [today\'s
massive violations of the rights of immigrants, the massive detentions
of citizens or aliens-indefinitely, without any due process, right to
counsel, or human rights protections-the prescribed use of torture, and
the attacks against key constitutional rights, including the right to
abortion, the right to vote and to have votes fairly counted, the right
to medical care, and the right to a secular and scientific
education]{.underline}. Last, I suggested that the approach I advocate
is, all in all, beneficial to literary studies and to the humanities in
general because it does not require reliance on \"gurus\" or \"master
thinkers.\" I mentioned the findings in the work of Patrick Colm Hogan,
David Herman, James Phelan, H. Porter Abbott, Lisa Zunshine, and Kenan
Malik, among many others, to show what direction this research is taking
today.

This is not the place to enter into particulars. My examples showed, to
state it here in its most abstract terms, how postcolonial literature
draws its readers into new puzzles-cognitive webs and labyrinths they
must negotiate-as well as new forms of personal and social
empathyemotional proximity or distance with respect to the many events,
situations, mores, and cultural and individual traits so inadequately
summarized by the words difference and other. Mostly, the talk fell
flat. [Several scholars]{.underline} in the audience [declared the
subject and the world socially constructed and
indeterminable]{.underline}; others said my approach was tainted by an
epistemology of Western essentialism; one acknowledged the importance of
a materialist grounding to postcolonial scholarship, attaching to it a
\"new humanism.

In this book I offer above all a critical view of issues that concern
the humanities. And while each chapter deals with specific and delimited
questions and problems, making it possible to read them in any order,
the book is conceived as a whole. Arguments and findings in one chapter
form a chain with discussions in another, and so on. Thus whether a
chapter aims to think through the problems of translation, justice,
music, literature, or the role of the scholar in society, to name but a
few, the result is a prism of analyses and reasons that holds together
by the materialist and humanist light shed on each and all. \[END PAGE

Disciplinary demarcations are necessary for pedagogical reasons. But
they do not mirror reality. Ours is an interconnected and ever-changing
world-a supersystem composed of interconnected subsystems of various
kinds (physical, cultural, social, and so on) that possess their own
peculiar properties and laws. And so, just as nothing in our society is
isolated, so these chapters are linked, making up a whole that aims to
explore as deeply as possible many of the activities we spin out of
ourselves to transform a reality that exists independent of our creating
and that in turn shapes us and our subsequent activities. This book
keeps centrally in mind, then, not only the fact that in our society
nothing is isolated, but also that in our odyssey as Homo sapiens
sapiens we have been evolving a self able to refine, revise, and create
anew all variety of cultural phenomena and a capacity to enjoy them.
This book keeps centrally in mind that we are all situated in history.
We are all a part of history. We all make history. We are all made by
the historical conditions we create.

[This book is a formal attempt to move away from the]{.underline}
erstwhile [free-for-all construction and consumption of notions that see
\"truth\" as \"something that must be created\"]{.underline} (Friedrich
Nietzsche) [and the study of the world as \"eternal
recurrence\"]{.underline} (Nietzsche). It is to propose that
[[**objectivity** and **reasoned argument**]{.mark} can [help]{.mark} to
[show how]{.mark} arguments used to justify [racism, sexism, and class
exploitation are specious]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such, my book does
not take the position that the material realm is unobservable; that
science is de facto bad; that it is the root cause of capitalist
enslavement or an appendage to patriarchal power or both. Rather,
[[while science is not perfect]{.mark} in its measurements, [it has
allowed us to understand more clearly how certain aspects of reality
work]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We would not get on a plane]{.mark} and fly
across the country [if this were not so]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Not
all our ideas]{.mark} about the world [are
fictions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Indeed, it is [because of our building
and revising of verifiable facts]{.mark} that [we can better
understand]{.mark} the earth\'s history and the evolution of life as
well as the economics of [capitalism]{.mark}-a system based on profit
(surplus value) residing in the use of labor power by the private owners
of the means of production]{.underline}.

[Indeed, [scientific investigation]{.mark} works to
[eliminate]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Adam Katz remarks, \"[[as many false
paths as possible]{.underline}]{.mark}\" (24) [and to
demystify]{.underline} \"[obscurantist ideological
generalities]{.underline}\" (25). [Our [failure to defend a
materialist-based politics-instead of pursuing a \"politics\" of
dismantling reason and causality-will result in a **loss of any
possibility of using science**]{.mark} to open \"spaces previously
closed to scrutiny\"]{.underline} (25). [[If there is no
truth]{.mark}-no content and [no]{.mark} meaning of
[subjectivity]{.mark} and only its effects-then]{.underline}, as Katz
writes; \"[[experience]{.underline}]{.mark} and interpretations of
experience [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} \... [[no]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[END PAGE XII\] [[longer be seen as]{.mark} either legitimating
existing social relations due to their obviousness or
naturalness]{.underline} \... [or as [providing the]{.mark} kinds of
[**knowledges necessary** for **emancipatory movements** seeking
**structural transformations**]{.mark}]{.underline}\" (65). Hence, the
general-aim of this book is to promote [methods and
approaches]{.underline} that [make a difference and]{.underline} that
[advance our knowledge of the world]{.underline}.

[My book grows out of]{.underline} a restless [concern with those who
declare that my generation has arrived just as the world is dying: at
the end of history, the end of art, ideology, science, the entirety of
Western metaphysical thought and philosophy]{.underline}, the end of
social classes and class warfare, [the end, even, of social
reality]{.underline}. To mark this end, [scholars of all walks of life
from Latin American, Chicano/Latino, and postcolonial cultural studies
scholars, translation theorists, to [the **high priests of
poststructuralism** seem to be dishing out]{.mark} healthy servings of a
philosophical [Idealism that lead **only to endless
speculation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Neoliberal Capitalism and the Alternatives*, Chapter 16.

While the alternatives considered in this book have positive qualities,
they all have shortcomings. My own proposal, outlined later, is that
political and economic policy should move in the direction of regulated
market socialism. I suggest [[a **state led**]{.underline}]{.mark}
hybrid [system [of **public**]{.mark}]{.underline} and private
**[[ownership]{.underline}]{.mark}**, combining the [advantages of
**economic planning**]{.underline} at the macro level with market
relationships in the retail sectors. The objectives are to
[[satisfy]{.mark} **individual [needs]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **public
[well-being]{.mark}** [through]{.mark} the **promotion of [full
employment]{.mark}**]{.underline} of capital and labour.

Regulated market socialism

Regulated market socialism delivers a minimalist answer to the problem
of the transition to socialism. Proposals for regulated market socialism
entail the elimination of excessive unearned personal wealth.
Twentiethcentury advocates of public ownership, such as Oskar Lange,
feared that nationalisation, in depriving some citizen of their private
wealth, would fuel public discord, and he predicted consequences of
'financial panic and economic collapse'.13 The [**[October
Revolution]{.mark} in Russia** [led to civil war]{.mark}]{.underline}
and protracted internal civil conflict and repression, which have
blighted the socialist cause. These adverse consequences have to be
avoided and **[[need not occur]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [**major
objective** of [policies in]{.mark} the [transitional period]{.mark} is
to [prevent]{.mark} civil war]{.underline}. [**Traditional
[revolution]{.mark}** in the sense of **violent [state capture]{.mark}**
[is **ruled out**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike in the former communist
systems and contemporary China, [[the]{.mark} **competitive [electoral
system]{.mark}** [would not be dismantled]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[civil
society would **remain pluralistic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Forms of
electoral competition would continue giving citizens the opportunity to
modify, even reverse, the changes. As electoral democracy is not
threatened, [[opposition to]{.mark} the **installation of a
['totalitarianism']{.mark} society** [would be
disarmed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Practices of democratic participation
could be widened to include employee participation in economic
enterprises. Such proposals have the great advantage that a [transition
could take effect within the **existing [political
framework]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it would [[preserve **economic and
political stability**]{.mark} and have **immediate positive
effects**]{.underline}.

# Cap K vs K Affs

### L -- Nostalgia (Ghostly Glaciers)

#### The aff's method is one of nostalgic experience -- embracing the past condemns independent thought to a subset of capitalism, thereby devaluing experience in a nostalgiogenic cycle of self-consumption

**Chrostowska '10** (S. D. Chrostowska is a professor at York University
in Social and Political Thought and has a PhD from the University of
Toronto; "Consumed by Nostalgia?"; SubStance, Volume 39, Number 2; 2010;
https://dx.doi.org/10.1353/sub.0.0085.) RCV

[The transformations to [nostalgic experience]{.mark}]{.underline} over
the last century, particularly in the wake of two world wars, tell a
dramatically different story. As the affective landscape and everyday
life of Western culture were being reshaped, nostalgia---that erstwhile
fulcrum of philosophy--- began to change course, increasingly **[[bound
to the flow of capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**. With the emergence of
consumerism, utopias of newness and dictatorships of speed, nostalgia
"as it once was" became a reactionary vice and risked obsolescence.
[Capitalism, however, saw [nostalgia's potential for profit]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}, channeling it now into its waters, [gave]{.mark} it
[unprecedented currency.]{.mark}]{.underline} We face questions about a
belatedly "new," late-modern nostalgia, questions we nonetheless still
struggle to formulate. With affect bound for world capital, is nostalgia
the last intervening station? How was this itinerary conceived? When did
we depart? And can we turn back if we have nearly arrived at our
destination? II [The confluence of [nostalgia]{.mark} and capitalism
[infects as it affects]{.mark}. Historicist delights and privations
determine the price of longing for the past and continually expand the
possibilities of its manufacture. [Nostalgic fulfillment]{.mark}, no
matter how elaborate, [is]{.mark} by design [provisional]{.mark}, since
unfulfillment---the addiction behind the addiction---becomes infinitely
more desirable.]{.underline} I consume out of curiosity, boredom or
envy, and it is what/ how I consume that, as if by chance, consumes me
by opening onto a new lack, expressed as nostalgia for a past
gratuitously laid bare or gestured at. [[The pined-for past holds out
against our desirous inroads]{.mark}. It is this ineluctable logic so
vital to nostalgia [that capitalist praxis
perverts]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Nostalgia reproduces]{.mark} rapidly
[through the channels of]{.mark} symbolic economy. The opportunities
that accompany **[consumer capitalism]{.mark}---[to construct our
identity]{.mark} [by]{.mark} "sharing" or "[giving access" to]{.mark}
personal [history representing]{.mark}** some significant, privileged
("living") connection with the past, in case the link corrodes or the
chain linking [the past in collective memory]{.mark} loses its hold on
the imagination---these same "[opportunities]{.mark}" [excoriate]{.mark}
the [remembrance]{.mark} and with it the things remembered, their
autonomous life in our memory, beyond any justification and
benefit.3]{.underline} The more we are strip-mined for our past, coaxed
out of circumspection, and led to articulate our experiences, the
lesser, generally speaking, becomes our intimacy with what we lived and
witnessed. On the one hand, this process is culturally responsible:
depositing one's memories into the archive of culture seems the only way
of preserving them from time's ravages and sure oblivion. From the naïve
point of view of cultural sustainability, individual memory can change
hands, with the sum knowledge of the past not merely undepleted, but
enriched. Yet the most intimate relationship with a past can be
overwritten by abstract memories; we have learned from books that memory
is a palimpsest, and that only such intimacy, even a modicum of it, can
make the submerged meaning legible. [[Gradual estrangement from]{.mark}
[our memories suggests we are losing]{.mark} the art of
[decipherment]{.mark}. Likewise, [excessive nostalgia]{.mark} affords us
the [means to ignore the radically unfamiliar]{.mark} [and]{.mark} turn
away from blank, unclaimed futures. If the public commemoration of
bygone events makes us work for their restitution, if we [cling to
the]{.mark} recent past and put it on record, and if we have begun to
speak of "nostalgia for the present," it is because there seems no
breaking the **[nostalgic chain forged in
capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With the exhaustion of firsthand
experience, secondhand memory comes to serve nostalgia as well if not
better, redoubling our longing for the firsthand.4 The more we indulge
in our feeling for "good old" anachronisms, the more sentimentally we
look back at our life, the cheaper our nostalgia is to evoke and the
costlier it is to appease. Before long, we have pawned the better share
of our past, our nostalgia subsisting on borrowed memories. [[Subtending
this economic model is]{.mark} the [commodification of affective
memories that constitute nostalgia]{.mark} and nostalgia-driven
activity. **[To capitalize on nostalgia is to profit from the sale
of]{.mark} such [memories]{.mark}** on the premise that they are
reproducible and transferable, [and]{.mark}, in ideological terms, that
emotions, no matter how [manipulate]{.mark}d, retain their
[naturalness]{.mark} [and]{.mark} remain a [counter]{.mark}weight to
[materialism]{.mark}. Ultimately, however, [capitalized nostalgia costs
us]{.mark} part of [our ability to bear]{.mark} the weight of [private
memory]{.mark}---[that]{.mark} is, memory that is alive not in spite but
because of its solitude. It [puts]{.mark} into question [the value of
lived experience]{.mark}, whose reproduction---patented and marketed
[as]{.mark} authentic---becomes itself
[nostalgiogenic]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Such recreated past has little
staying power]{.mark}. [The gratification it provides is]{.mark} devised
as [expendable]{.mark}]{.underline} (given up for another past on
offer). [[Commodified nostalgia is]{.mark} (predictably)
[self-consuming]{.mark} nostalgia]{.underline}. One corollary of the
hollowed-out relationship with the past engendered by this process is
the welcome reproduction of various pasts down to the smallest detail.
[[The logic of nostalgia]{.mark} [dictates]{.mark} that [nothing
can]{.mark} really [be recovered]{.mark}, only re-collected,
re-imagined. But [nostalgia collaborating with capitalism has]{.mark}
this message to convey: with a [little ingenuity]{.mark} and investment,
we, as a society of individualists, can regain desired aspects of the
past.]{.underline} Such verisimilitude rejects the historical integrity
of the original. What was strange transitions as exotic or quaint toward
assimilation into the superficially familiar. The more distant a past,
the better it can serve as a playground for the commercially bound
imagination. If, as a result, we come to regard the ancients as our
contemporaries, it is because what once lay largely in the purview of
aesthetic experience, historical or literary study has become more
readily accessible through forms of mass media entertainment and the
cost- and time-effective heritage industry. Mass production and
consumption exhausts the past by paring down its heterogeneity for
effortless recognition and streamlined exhibition. Whatever the past
redivivus, it is valuable insofar as it confirms us in our current
existence. It is fortuitously dropped from the "historical repertoire"
when its image becomes de-historicized through overexposure and
association with the here-and-now. Its nostalgic potential, utilized in
this way, is thus attenuated. Only after an interval of "commercial
death" or lying low in the hierarchy of market value can we expect its
recrudescence---when it reappears with the vividness of near
nonrecognition, as if from the deep end of the unconscious. For it is
not a cliché that one buries the past, but a quintessential statement on
the past framed by individual existence. The flood of nostalgia
marketing finds another limit in instinctual self-preservation;
manufactured nostalgias do not command our dreams. Despite the artist's
proverbial aversion and resistance to consumerism, capital lays claim to
the artistic past in tandem with the artistic present. This is a simple
matter of manipulating cultural perspective: nostalgia is discovered at
the root of every avant-garde; the present state of art is attributed to
declining aesthetic standards; critics reward the return to classical
technique; and art is proclaimed as a thing of the past. Similar
rhetoric is applied to things commercial and/or practical in purpose,
which often gain artistic value in the process. As Claude Lévi-Strauss
observed in New York in the 1940s, "One surrounds oneself with these
objects not because they are beautiful, but because, since beauty has
become inaccessible to all but the very rich, they offer, in its place,
a sacred character . . ." (263). It is important to think through the
reversal of fortune that this entails: what was commercial and everyday
may, with the passage of time, become sublated. Consumed, its nostalgic
charge spent, it is retired from mass culture, emancipated from the
cycle of economic exchange, and given a shimmering afterlife---until we
come across it, not knowing what to make of something so forgotten and
so arresting. Their decommissioning is an occasion for things even
artificial or utilitarian to begin with, things outmoded or broken,
effaced and worn out, to redeem themselves through time---an occasion
capitalism disavows but cannot prevent.

The Problem of the Picturesque [The contemporary prominence of [visual
culture]{.mark} has [led the picturesque to accrue value relative to the
sublime]{.mark} and the beautiful. In contemporary par- lance, aesthetic
has become an adjective meaning "pleasing to look at," as in, "That's so
aesthetic." Instagramming adolescents are not the only ones seeking
visual pleasure: [Anthropocene-era tourists]{.mark} also [scout out
places]{.mark} [with]{.mark} exotic, [photogenic elements]{.mark} (Smith
2018)---perhaps those [that future gen]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [might
not]{.mark} be able to [capture]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Arctic is a
travel destination possessing such traits, exempli-fied by the explosion
of tourism in Iceland. One unexpected factor contributing to the
country's sudden popularity was pop singer Justin Bieber's music video
for a song fittingly called"I'll Show You" (2015), watched nearly half a
billion times on YouTube (Huddart and Stott 2016). In the video, the
scenic film locations of which attracted visitors in droves to
previously untrammeled Icelandic canyons and cliffs, the singer gazes
down from mossy promontories in shots reminiscent of German Romantic
artist Caspar David Friedrich's painting Wanderer above the Sea of Fog
(1818). Stark Icelandic vistas, however, are more common than icebergs
and polar bears[. These **[icons of Arctic climate change
represent]{.mark} even more highly sought [souvenirs of "last chance
tourism]{.mark}**" (Dawson et al. 2011), [which]{.mark} also
[constitute]{.mark}s "[ruin tourism]{.mark}" in the Anthropocene. Amidst
calving ice sheets and thaw- ing glaciers, as [consumption of spectated
sites]{.mark} [shifts]{.mark} from ruined buildings [to the eviscerating
Earth]{.mark}, Urry's (1992)"tourist gaze" merges [with]{.mark} what
might be called the "Anthropocene gaze." [The]{.mark} proliferation of
picturesque iconography parallels the **[externalization]{.mark},
mediatization, [and com- modification of]{.mark} popular [sites]{.mark}
with[in]{.mark} "[processes of social
remembering]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Edensor 2005, 830). In certain
external narratives, the Arctic is not only depicted as on the cusp of
disappearing: It has already died. In 2016, environmental
nongovernmental organiza- tion Greenpeace built a floating white
platform on which Italian pianist Ludovico Einaudi played a song he
composed titled"Elegy for the Arctic." The plat- form drifted in front
of a picturesque tidewater glacier in Svalbard, playing precisely to the
epoch's aesthetics. [[Acts of]{.mark} remembrance like performing an
elegy---a [lament for the dead]{.mark}---[reify the idea]{.mark} that
[the Arctic is]{.mark} already [lost]{.mark}. As an Economist headline
lamented,"The Arctic as it is known today is almost certainly gone"
(2017). **[Funereal portrayals make it seem as if nothing can be
done]{.mark}** to change the future, **[embodying]{.mark}** what Boym
(2001) identified as **[reflective nostalgia, which "dwells]{.mark}
[in]{.mark}** algia (aching), in longing and loss, **[the imperfect
process of remembrance]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (141).1 The aesthetic
category of the picturesque in the Anthropocene evokes longing and
mourning but rarely anger. In fact, depictions that are not pictur-
esque provoke the most heated reactions. In 2019, a video of a polar
bear---a climate change icon (Ziser and Sze 2007)---with graffiti
spray-painted onto its fur in Chukotka, Russia, went viral,"spark\[ing\]
out- rage," according to a Guardian headline (Roth 2019). The video
disrupted the aesthetics of the Anthropocene that show nature in ruins
without identifying a culprit. The emblazoned polar bear makes painfully
evident that at least one individual committed this act of environmental
vandalism. The ruined ursine violates visual expectations of environ-
mental destruction in the Anthropocene, for there is nothing picturesque
or sublime about the bear.

A third stream of literature---the radical political economy of
tourism---makes additional critical contributions to my framework for
sustainable Indigenous tourism. Arguments emerging from this area run
contrary to many from traditional sustainable tourism literature.
[[Sustainable tourism]{.mark}, working under the logic of sustainable
development, largely [views socio-economic globalization and the spread
of]{.mark} market [economies as **positive**
occurrences]{.mark},]{.underline} focusing on their 61 potential for
poverty alleviation and enhanced living conditions. [[Radical political
economy]{.mark}, on the other hand, [understands capitalism to be an
**unacceptably destructive** mode of producing and consuming]{.mark}
goods and services, and [generally considers globalization to be highly
problematic]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Peet, Robbins, & Watts, 2011).
Radical political economy is underlain by Karl Marx's theory of
capitalism (see the discussion in Chapter 1, section 1.5.2.1 of this
dissertation for a further definition and explanation of capitalism). An
expansive world of theory has developed from the basic foundations of
Marxism, as has a world of theory critiquing it. Interestingly, however,
[only a small number of tourism scholars have centrally engaged Marxism.
Bianchi]{.underline} (2009, 2011) is a principal figure in this area.
His work [argues for approaches to tourism studies that are based in
historical materialism---Marx's name for his theory of social change---
[and]{.mark} that ["scrutinize the logics of state power and]{.mark} the
[increasingly liberalized modes of capital accumulation in
tourism"]{.mark}]{.underline} (2009, p. 498). [Bianchi criticizes
[neo-liberalism]{.mark} [within]{.mark} the [tourism]{.mark} sector,
meaning the set of policies and ideologies that [advance the spread of
capitalism around the world today.]{.mark}]{.underline} Bianchi's work
builds on Britton (1982a, 1991), who is largely regarded as the first
radical political economic tourism scholar. The 2011 volume edited by
Mosedale, entitled Political Economy of Tourism: A Critical Perspective,
has been described as "an homage to .. .[Britton, \[whose\] efforts..
.to locate tourism within the broader context of capitalist
accumulation.. .\[has\] had deep and lasting influence]{.underline}"
(Mair, 2012, p. 1276). A key take away from the radical political
economy of tourism is that [[research]{.mark} focusing solely on the
cultural, performative, and representative aspects of the tourism
encounter---which was a trend in anthropological tourism studies that
Bianchi (2009) critiqued---is insufficient because it [overlooks]{.mark}
the [material foundations]{.mark} of the phenomenon.]{.underline} [[A
radical political economic approach to]{.mark} 62 [sustainable
tourism]{.mark} returns to the Marxist basics of looking at financial
flows (money) and governance structures (power) and analyzing whether
they promote social equity or the continued exploitation of labor and
land by capitalists]{.underline}. This approach is reinforced by Buscher
and Fletcher (2016), who describe the capital accumulation of modern
tourism as "structural violence".

vital-[for]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[historical and material
relations]{.underline}** [of the dialectical praxis of labor and class
as explanations of the material basis of contradictions in capitalism
now and their transformation]{.underline}. In other words, [central
to]{.underline} [biopolitics]{.underline} [is a]{.underline} **[cultural
spiritualism]{.underline}** [which ideologically translates historical
and material relations into
a]{.underline} [transhistorical]{.underline} [and autonomous power of
life- a mystical vitalism - and posits this spiritual vitalism as the
basis of bringing about new social relations]{.underline}. [This new
\"spiritualism\" of life is offered in]{.underline} a variety of
articulations in contemporary cultural theory,
from [writings]{.underline} that overtly address theories of biopower
and biopolitics as in the
writings [of]{.underline} Michael **[Hardt]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} Antonio **[Negri]{.underline}** (Commonwealth),
Giorgio **[Agamben]{.underline}** (Homo Sacer),
Maurizio **[Lazzarato]{.underline}**, and
Antonella **[Corsani]{.underline}**, among others, to the transspecies
posthumanist writings of **[Derrida]{.underline}** (The Animal That
Therefore I Am), Agamben (The
Open), [and]{.underline} Donna **[Haraway]{.underline}** (When Species
Meet). These biopolitical theories claim to address a range of material
problems that are the effect of production for profit in capitalism:
from the encroachment of commodity relations into all aspects of life,
including the private ownership of strands of DNA and whole species of
plants and animals; to the degradation of the environment in the
interests of profit; to economic crisis; to the extension of the working
day; to the subordination of love and sexuality to production for
profit; to the estrangement of workers from social wealth \... Yet, at
the same
time, [biopolitical]{.underline} [theories]{.underline} **[abstract]{.underline}** [these
problems]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [their origins
in]{.underline} **[class relations and exploitation]{.underline}**. [In
place of addressing the material conditions and relations that have
given rise to these
problems,]{.underline} [biopolitical]{.underline} [theories posit an
\"other-world\"]{.underline} and an \"other-worldly life\" -[a concept
of spiritual life that is prior to, constitutive of, transcendent of
and/or outside of the historical and social relations of capitalism - as
the basis of a new \"common\" beyond the material contradictions of
capitalism]{.underline}.

The spiritualization of life in biopolitical theories, to be clear, is
represented as a new form of materialism. [The substitution of \"life\"
for \"class\" in]{.underline} [biopolitical]{.underline} [theories draws
from]{.underline} **[Foucault\'s]{.underline}** [theory of
\"bio-power\"]{.underline} in which he argues that \"modem man is an
animal whose politics calls his existence as a living being into
question.\" 2 \"Bio-power,\" Foucault contends, is a regime of power
that, rather than ruling by threat of death, produces life through the
disciplining of bodies, the regulation of populations, and through the
\"technologies of the self\" in which bodies come to bind themselves to
identities produced through sovereign power. In fact, [Foucault posits
\"bio-power\" -the instrumental disciplining of bodies such that they
come to experience their own subjection as the norm of life and source
of pleasure-rather than the exploitation of labor, as the material basis
of capitalism]{.underline}. Capitalism, Foucault contends, is not
possible without \"bio-power\": \"bio-power was without question an
indispensable element in the development of capitalism; the latter would
not have been possible without the controlled insertion of bodies into
the machinery of production.\" 3 According to Foucault, \"There is no
binary and all encompassing opposition between rulers and ruled at the
root of power relations.\" 4 In this view there is \"no regulative
mechanism\" of power relations. Instead, in Foucault\'s cultural
imaginary of power, \"power is everywhere \... because it comes from
everywhere.\" 5

In this narrative, [an explanatory critique of power as the effect of
class relations of capitalism]{.underline} - relations between exploiter
and exploited -[is regarded as part of a binary metaphysics of power
which discursively imposes a regime of truth (power/knowledge) onto what
is actually, so the story goes, an ineffably and mysteriously plural,
diffuse, and amorphous multiplicity of forces]{.underline}. [On the one
hand,]{.underline} [life is assumed
to]{.underline} [spontaneously]{.underline} [produce]{.underline} [a
discursive proliferation of meanings (knowledges)]{.underline} [that
then discipline and contain it]{.underline}. [On the other hand, life is
regarded as]{.underline} [an ineffable and plural]{.underline} [opacity
that resists
all]{.underline} [conceptual]{.underline} [explanation]{.underline}. [The
subjection of bodies is reduced to a contingent, \"spontaneous\" and
aleatory effect of \"life\" as such or the sheer fact of
living]{.underline}. [This makes it appear as if \"power over life\"
comes not from structural relations of exploitation, but from a
non-structural, amorphous, cultural plurality- a cultural democracy of
power from below to which all have access by virtue of
living]{.underline} [that is \"everywhere.\"]{.underline}

[Foucault\'s theory of bio-power is not a form of materialism but a form
of cultural spiritualism]{.underline}. [When Foucault argues that
\"bio-politics\" is at the root of capitalism,
he]{.underline} **[dehistoricizes]{.underline}** [\"the machinery
of]{.underline} [production\" into which he claims bodies are
\"inserted.\"]{.underline} [The existence of \"the machinery of
production\"]{.underline} [-or a \"controlled insertion\" of bodies-is
itself]{.underline} **[the effect]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[dialectical praxis of labor]{.underline}**. This is
because [power is not an autonomous]{.underline}, trans-historical life
force nor is it an ineffable diffuse plurality beyond historical and
conceptual explanation, [but]{.underline} **[an
effect]{.underline}** [of
definite]{.underline} **[historical]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[material
conditions]{.underline}** [and relations]{.underline}. [Power, in other
words,]{.underline} [rests upon]{.underline} **[material conditions of
production]{.underline}**. [Whether or not the society has the power to
end starvation or to condemn the majority of the laboring population to
a lifetime of starvation, has to do with the level of development of its
material conditions of production-its forces of production-and the
social relations of production (the labor and property relations) that
determine the social ends and interests toward which labor is
put]{.underline}. This is another way of saying that [power is
the]{.underline} **[historical]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[material
effect]{.underline}** [of labor in the]{.underline} **[form of
property]{.underline}**. I[n a society in which property is privately
owned, power is the capacity of the ruling class to \"command over the
surplus-labor\" of workers in production]{.underline}. 6 **[At the
root]{.underline}** [of power relations is
an]{.underline} [**antagonistic class relation**: the antagonism between
owners of the means of production and workers who only own their labor
to sell in order to survive and are exploited]{.underline}. [The binary
of class is]{.underline} [**historical and
material**,]{.underline} [**not**, at root,]{.underline} [discursive:
class binaries are]{.underline} [**not the effect of nature**,
God,]{.underline} [nor]{.underline} [are they the
effect]{.underline} [of \"Western
metaphysics,\"]{.underline} [\"discursive construction,\" \"binary
thinking,\" or conceptualization, but the effect of private ownership of
the means of production]{.underline}.

[Foucault\'s theory of power]{.underline} **[does the ideological work
of
capital]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[concealing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[inverting]{.underline}** [the
structural relations of class in capitalism]{.underline}. [In place of
the material transformation of structural relations of capitalism,
Foucault advocates \"resistance\" within-a change in the discursive and
cultural regimes and a re-valuing of \"life\" -as the basis of a
\"different economy of bodies and pleasures.\"]{.underline} 7 [This
amounts to the]{.underline} **[updating of the culture of
capitalism]{.underline}** [as the]{.underline} **[limit of
change]{.underline}** [while the needs of the masses for material

### L -- Subjectivity

#### The 1AC's focus on [subjectivity]{.underline} is [counter-revolutionary]{.underline} because it [obscures]{.underline} the [sociopolitical context]{.underline} that [produces subjects]{.underline} and only amounts to [individualized resistance.]{.underline}

**Hardt and Negri, 17** \[Michael Hardt is an American political
philosopher and literary theorist. Hardt is best known for his book

**[Neoliberal governance]{.underline}**, as we argued earlier together
with Foucault and Brown, is a governing rationality that [cannot be
understood merely in terms of its **general economic
policies:**]{.underline} the **[privatization]{.underline}** of public
services and industries, the **[deregulation]{.underline}** of markets
and firms, the **[destruction]{.underline}** of labor unions, and so
forth. Neoliberalism [must be grasped]{.underline} also [in terms
of]{.underline} the production of **[subjectivity]{.underline}**, that
is, the creation at all levels of society of individual entrepreneurial
subjects, homines economici, who, in turn, continually reproduce the
neoliberal world. This recognition could easily lead to despair: how can
we resist neoliberalism, let alone create alternatives to it, if our own
subjectivity is produced by it and permeated by its rationality? There
seems to be nowhere outside neoliberalism we can stand.

**[Power]{.underline}**, however---and neoliberal power is no
exception---[is not organic]{.underline} or unitary [but]{.underline} is
always **[defined by]{.underline}** relationship and
**[antagonism]{.underline}**. Foucault himself explains that power is a
structure of "actions brought to bear upon possible actions; it incites,
it induces, it seduces, it makes easier or more difficult; in the
extreme it constrains or forbids absolutely; it is nevertheless always a
way of acting upon an acting subject or acting subjects by virtue of
their acting or being capable of action. A set of actions upon other
actions."26 [Resistance is always present in power from the
beginning]{.underline}, as is the potential for rupture. **[The
processes of]{.underline}** subjection, then, and [the **production of
subjectivities**]{.underline} that are **[functional to power
are]{.underline}** themselves both precarious and **[shot]{.underline}**
through **[with resistances]{.underline}** and alternative potentials.
[Subjectivity]{.underline}, in other words, **[is not a given but a
terrain of struggle]{.underline}**.

The potential for resistances and alternatives to neoliberalism emerged
in our analyses above perhaps most clearly in the context of social
production. The fact that capital functions increasingly through
processes of the extraction of the common, that instead of directly
organizing productive cooperation as it does in the factory it captures
value produced on the social terrain through processes from which it is
distant, indicates that the circuits of social production and, in
particular, the organization of productive cooperation are relatively
autonomous from capital. That is one factor that has allowed finance,
which is always distant from the scene of production, to become the
predominant apparatus of capture. [This migration of capital away from
the scene of social production, moreover, is irreversible]{.underline}.
Capital is not able to organize directly the plural field of
subjectivities who produce socially in cooperation and communication in
part because those subjectivities and the values they produce overflow
capitalist systems of measure. Faced with this reality, the abilities of
capital and neoliberal **[administration]{.underline}** to **[measure,
codify, and reproduce subjectivities]{.underline}** and values [in a
**hierarchical schema**]{.underline} become tenuous. But any attempt by
capital to dictate directly the cooperation of social subjectivities,
just like its attempts to enclose the common as private property, risks
reducing productivity and diminishing profits. Capital cannot get too
close or it will strangle the life force on which its own survival
depends. We do not mean for this analysis of the capitalist extraction
of the common and the relatively autonomous processes of cooperation in
social production to suggest that antineoliberal and non-neoliberal
subjectivities already exist and are simply waiting to be emancipated.
[We mean for it simply to confirm that a battle over the production of
subjectivity is possible]{.underline}---an asymmetrical combat between
the capitalist technologies of measure and the immeasurable, overflowing
forces of enlarged social production and reproduction, which reside in
and produce the common.

To combat neoliberalism requires first a destituent project. We must not
only challenge the processes of emptying the public and the capitalist
right to extract and privatize the common but also demystify and combat
the neoliberal processes of subjection. How can we sabotage and block
the gears of the machines that produce and reproduce neoliberal
subjectivity? This battle is possible because we are inside the
productive project dominated by capital. It is not paradoxical for us to
take what is power for capital---subjection---as an occasion for
destituent subjectivation. In line with the Marxist tradition of
subversion, [this means]{.underline}, on one hand, [that capitalist
subjection is always forced to **individualize productive
subjects**]{.underline} and, on the other, that the subjects put to work
can discover in their own activities that they are not merely
individuals but also have the potential to act together. [To make sense
of this being-together one must **sabotage** the **capitalist
project**]{.underline}, [not only blocking **capitalist machines** but
also **destroying** **ideological** and material **mechanisms** of the
**organization** of labor and **society**, along with their
**individualist subjection.**]{.underline}

To this destituent endeavor needs to be added a constituent project of
subjectivation, that is, in the language we used earlier, the
construction of machinic assemblages to produce alternative
subjectivities. How can the common be reappropriated by the multitudes
that produce it? How can plural subjectivities construct and manage
autonomously their own cooperative social relations? The struggle opens
here to unhinge social cooperation from not only its direct exploitation
but also the mechanisms of financial extraction. It is a matter of
stripping cooperation from command---simple to say, difficult to do.
Control and resistance, commodity production and capacities for
innovation: these are some of the terms of the asymmetry between
subjection and subjectivation, and the passage from destituent to
constituent action.

One way forward at this point is to adopt the standpoint of existing
subjects, specifically to take guidance from the agents of social
production who, subjected to the command of finance capital, nonetheless
manage to organize resistance and even projects of liberation. From the
social struggles we need to learn, argues Pedro Biscay, former director
of the Central Bank of Argentina, "a capacity of political invention
able to transform the financial dynamic in the field of battle against
capital."27 [That power of political invention, we should add, has its
foundation in the cooperative terrain of social production and in the
overflowing productive nature of the common]{.underline}. And,
furthermore, that battle against capital must be also a battle for new
social relations. At the end of chapter 9 we traced a progression, which
is already in action today, from social production to social unionism to
social strike. Social unionism, we argued, by combining the
organizational structures and innovations of labor unions and social
movements, is able to give form to the entrepreneurship of the multitude
and the potential for revolt that is inherent in social production.
[Struggles]{.underline} **[valorize]{.underline}**
[existing]{.underline} **[subjectivities]{.underline}** [but also
**create new ones**]{.underline}; subjectivities are radically
transformed by their participation in political organizing and political
action. [Struggle too is a terrain of the **production of
subjectivity**]{.underline}.

Social struggles, however, even organized as social unionism and social
strike, are not enough. They are not the endpoint but a point of
departure, a launch pad for the production of powerful subjectivities.
An **[alternative production of subjectivity]{.underline}** and
alternative social relations [must be **sustained** and]{.underline}
**[institutionalized]{.underline}**. Earlier we claimed that money is a
social technology that institutionalizes social relations, and we traced
various ways that money sustains capitalist social relations through
their different phases of the mode of production. In chapter 15 we will
argue that this critique should lead us not to oppose money as such but
instead to invent an alternative to capitalist money, that is, an
alternative social technology for institutionalizing new social
relations---a money of the common.

When we advocate for a money of the common we are not imagining any
storming of the Winter Palace (or the Federal Reserve or the European
Central Bank), nor are we thinking of those (however noble) local or
digital currencies that seek to escape from the totalizing power of the
dominant currencies. Our analysis of money is not concerned primarily,
as we said, with [its function as a **means of exchange**]{.underline}.
[We are interested instead in **deconstructing** the **social
relations** that **capitalist money imposes** and **institutionalizes**,
and **institutionalizing** new social **relations** through a **new
money**]{.underline}. A money of the common must first be a subversive
money: it must transform the capacity of struggles over social
production and forms of life into weapons that block (to use old terms)
capital's power to coin money and (in newer terms) the increasing
domination over the common through the financialization of society.
Along with those destituent effects, a money of the common must also
consolidate and extend the autonomous relations of social cooperation,
confirming the values of the common and generalizing its principles of
open access and democratic decision-making. [A money of the common,
then, must be a social technology to crown the processes of
subjectivation, making lasting and socially expansive a production of
powerful subjectivities. In part IV we will need to investigate this and
other pillars of a potential project of transformation and
liberation.]{.underline}

Global civil society [theorists focus their ire on what they understand
to be the]{.underline} narrow, [exclusionary bias of the sovereign
state. In turn, they view]{.underline} a wide constellation of
[transnational actors]{.underline}, from the global mega-NGOs to
[local]{.underline} farming [cooperatives, as representing a radical
alternative that opens up]{.underline} the [space for new]{.underline}
kinds of [political]{.underline} organization and [activity. In fact,
what the celebration of '[bottom-up' politics and]{.mark} the [critique
of the state]{.mark} really express is a deep disenchantment
with]{.underline} mass [society and]{.underline} the demands of [formal
accountability that go along with]{.underline} representative
[democracy]{.underline}.72 [**A consequence of rejecting the political
sphere is that it [leaves political struggles isolated from any shared
framework of meaning]{.mark}** or from any formal processes]{.underline}
of democratic accountability. [[The quest for individual
autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark} and the claim for the recognition of
separate 'political spaces' [and the 'incommunicability' of political
causes]{.underline}, each **[[demonstrate the limits of these radical
claims for the]{.underline}]{.mark}** normative **[[project
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** global **[[civil
society]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[END PAGE 164\] [**['from
below']{.mark}**. Far from reflecting the emergence of new]{.underline}
global [political forces, the global civil society, by virtue of its
social isolation, is marked by political **weakness**]{.underline}. As
such, [[the only strategy left]{.mark} to it [is a retreat
into]{.mark}]{.underline} elite lobbying and **[[individualized ethical
postures]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

It is important to stress that [I am not claiming that the key problem
with radical]{.underline} global civil society [approaches is their
rejection of formal engagement per se in existing political
institutions]{.underline} and established parties. [The point I am
making]{.underline} here [is that [the **rejection of state-based
politics**]{.mark}, which forces the individual to engage with and
account for the views of other members of society, [reflects]{.mark} a
deeper problem -- [an unwillingness to engage in political
contestation]{.mark}]{.underline} per se. **[[Proponents
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** global civil [**[society 'from below']{.mark}
therefore [seek to legitimize their views as the prior moral
claims]{.mark}** of others. This has the effect of
transforming]{.underline} global civic [actors into]{.underline} the
[advocates of those unable to make moral claims themselves]{.underline}.
Alternatively, they put themselves in harm's way and would lead by
inarticulate example. [What [they avoid]{.mark} doing is]{.underline}
pursuing their own interests or [[seeking to build political solidarity
around shared interests]{.mark}. [What can]{.mark} actually [be
achieved]{.mark} through their chosen methods [is
**limited**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Radical lobbying and calls for
recognition may in some cases precipitate a generational turnover in the
establishment. [However, [the rejection of social engagement is]{.mark}
more [likely to lead to a **further shrinking** of the political sphere,
reducing it to a small circle of **increasingly unaccountable
elites**]{.mark}. If the only alternative to the political 'game' is to
threaten to 'take our ball home' -- the anti-politics of rejectionism --
the powers that be can sleep peacefully in their beds]{.underline}.

Empire had been extensively criticized by various commentators (Dean
2003; Rabinow and Rose 2006; Zizek 2008), particularly because its
totalizing metanarrative was of little use for empirical analysis. Here,
we emphasize two points related to Hardt and Negri\'s dismissal of the
state and state-centered politics. First, [[we
question]{.underline}]{.mark}, in line with Zizek,
[[whether]{.underline}]{.mark} Hardt and Negri\'s proclamation of [[a
society of unmediated expression of]{.mark} the [multitude\'s creative
agency is possible]{.mark}. This is the idea of a society without
representation, one of \"absolute democracy\"]{.underline} -that is, \"a
society fully organized in terms of expression of the multitude\" (Zizek
2008, 364). [This illusion is]{.underline}, according to Zizek (364-65),
[aversion of the philosophical problem of \"becoming versus
Being]{.underline} (living productivity versus the sterility of an inert
structure of representation), [where [every representation is
parasitical upon productive expressivity]{.mark}." Rather than accept
the opposition of \"real\" productivity versus the state as sterile
representation, it should be seen as expressing interdependence, that
is, no \"self-organized\" multitude without state power. [There would be
no productive multitude]{.mark} and no diversified creativity (such as
found in social movements and processes of innovation) [without the
structure]{.mark} of mediation]{.underline} and representation. Thus
says Zizek, \"What if Mao was aware that the very flourishing of
movements of the multitude always-already had to rely on some
dispositive of Power which structures and sustains the very space within
which they operate? [Today, the [movements for]{.mark} gay rights,
[human rights]{.mark}, and so on, all [rely on state apparatuses, which
are not only the addressee of their demands, but also provide the
framework for their activity]{.mark}]{.underline} (stable civil life)\"
(371). We contend that [Hardt and Negri\'s conceptualization of power
allows them to eschew any consideration of the extent to which
[the]{.mark} territorial [state]{.mark} and its institutions [**provides
the necessary conditions** for]{.mark} a civil
[society]{.mark}]{.underline}, even as they themselves define it. Thus,
by their use of Empire-the virtual omnipresent logic of postmodern, post
binary, posthierarchical, and postnational forms of organizing-[they
succeed in abandoning]{.underline} completely [the state or a system of
states as an enduring analytical problem and political issue. [At the
national]{.mark} or international [level the state]{.mark} or state
[system **only appears as something to be opposed**]{.mark} **or
overcome**. This is because, for them, all of the movements are
immediately subversive in themselves and do not require any sort of
external assistance and social support to guarantee their
effectiveness]{.underline} (Hardt and Negri 2000, 58) [or conditions of
order]{.underline}, peace, [and stability in which to achieve their
ends]{.underline}. \[END PAGE 29\] Second, and more disturbing, [what
are the implications of the multitude, which appears as a new form of
civil society \"on steroids\"? The image of [an **unorganized collective
subject** that momentarily expresses]{.mark} its [**creative political
potential** seems to share]{.mark} characteristic [features with
extreme]{.mark} variants of [eschatological politics such as]{.mark}
**[libertarian liberalism]{.mark}, communism, [or]{.mark} even the
[fascist use of crowds]{.mark}** and their expressive
acclamations]{.underline}, recently analyzed by Giorgio Agamben (2011).
[This is no doubt why Hardt and Negri]{.underline} (2004, 99-100) [seek
to distinguish the multitude in terms of its ability to maintain
difference rather than dissolving it into the mindless indifference of
the mass]{.underline} or the fabricated unity of the people. [Yet this
remains a **purely theoretical set of distinctions**. [After the demise
of]{.mark} modern and [enlightenment values, we seem]{.mark} to be [left
with]{.mark} paradigmatic postmodern features, that is, [aestheticized
forms of communication, organization, and identity]{.mark} in which
\"differences express themselves freely\"]{.underline} (Hardt and Negri
2004, 101). [But]{.underline} is the aim of the free expression of all
difference political or aesthetic, and [what are its
consequences?]{.underline} Thus, Levinson instructively observes:
\"Indeed, is not the movement of a spontaneous and \'bodily\' multitude,
without plan or communication, the very formula for the most
aestheticized political models, above all populism, even fascism?\"
(Levinson 2001, 213). [Could it be [that]{.mark}]{.underline} Hardt and
Negri\'s way of [opening up the space for [political innovation **runs
the risk of a crushing limitation** of]{.mark} our [political
choices]{.mark}?]{.underline} It is interesting that Hardt and Negri
seek in Commonwealth to address a range of thinkers who question either
the capacity of the multitude to act as a political actor (Pierre
Macherey, Ernesto Laclau) or question their supposition of its
progressive and liberatory political character (Paolo Virni, Etienne
Balibar, Zizek, and Alain Badiou) (Hardt and Negri 2009, 166-69).
Despite the at times repetitious and dare we say a little desperate
reiteration of key theses (of the primacy of resistance, of the creative
acts of the multitude) they admit that all this is not enough to
establish the political orientation of the multitude. [[Their language
turns toward a]{.mark}n increasingly pious and [normative **wish-list**
in which the multitude **must act outside the corruption of existing
institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline} (the family, the corporation, the
nation) [or should produce the commons and needs a theory on the
\"terrain of organization\"]{.underline} (178). [[Unfortunately]{.mark},
when we search for that theory of organization]{.underline},
particularly in the final chapter of Commonwealth, called \"Governing
the Revolution," [[we find only]{.underline}]{.mark} the admission of [a
series of]{.underline} self-described [["impasses,"]{.mark} such as
finding an answer to the question \"[What or who]{.mark} draws the
political diagonal that]{.underline} \[END PAGE 30\] [[guides the
transition?]{.mark}\" [or]{.mark} on [the nature of the governmental,
constitutional, and juridical framework that comes from the
revolution]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hardt and Negri 2009, 363). [[These are
**hardly minor issues**]{.underline}]{.mark} given the ambition of their
work as revolutionary political theory. It turns out that the authors
are best at specifying conceptions of revolutionary organization they
oppose-that is, the ones that are ready to seize the state, to establish
a counterpower and a newly constituent power, or to found some form of
dictatorship. They are less interested in elucidating revolutionary
organization itself. When they gesture toward an alternative conception
of organization it is one that appropriates current notions of
\"governance without government\" and hopes to subvert and reformulate
them (372-75). [While the antistatism of this literature can be taken as
given, it remains to be seen whether this focus on governance can in any
way be viewed as an adequate way of displacing]{.underline} a conception
and theory of [the state]{.underline}. [[Radical antistatism unites the
militant Left with a **libertarian or neoliberal Right**]{.mark},
autonomist post-Marxists with centrist social democrats and students of
public administration]{.underline}. Yet Hardt and Negri are legitimate
students of Foucault in one sense: they pronounce the anticipated end of
a transcendent form of power and a reign of immanence. They thus foresee
the end of the form of power that is constitutive of the state:
sovereignty. This is due to the rise of the multitude: \"The autonomy of
the multitude and its capacities for economic, political and social
self-organization take away any role for sovereignty. Not only is
sovereignty no longer the exclusive terrain of the political, the
multitude banishes sovereignty from politics. When the multitude is
finally able to rule itself, democracy becomes possible\" (Hardt and
Negri 2004, 340). [This]{.underline}, we note, [is the classic dream of
civil society, to finally become one with itself outside the alienated
condition it suffers under the domination of the state. It is the form
that many modern political eschatologies take]{.underline}.

### L -- Folk Politics

#### The aff [lapses]{.underline} into a 'folk politics' that [cedes the terrain]{.underline} to alter [structural]{.underline} conditions of power subsumed by [neoliberal]{.underline} agents.

In their book *Inventing the Future*, Srnicek and Williams suggest that
**[limited]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[timid]{.underline}** (if
not altogether absent) [demands amongst]{.underline}
twenty-first-century [protest movements are the result of]{.underline}
what they call "**[[folk-political sentiment]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
Folk-politics is, they argue, [[characterized by]{.underline}]{.mark} a
series of widely accepted values: "\[[S\]mall is beautiful,
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[local is ethical]{.underline}**]{.mark},
simpler is better, [permanence is oppressive]{.underline}, **[[progress
is over]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [These
[limit]{.mark}ation[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, then, [[are favored over
a]{.mark}ny]{.underline} [**[counter-hegemonic]{.underline}** [project
that could contest capital]{.underline}]{.mark}[ism "[at
the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[largest]{.underline}**
[scales]{.underline}]{.mark}." Instead, [folk [politics]{.mark} is
[driven by]{.mark} a]{.underline} profound [**[pessimism]{.underline}**
[that large-scale]{.underline}]{.mark} [collective social [change is
possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Crucially, [entwined in this is [a fear
of]{.mark} returning to]{.underline} the [[grand narratives]{.mark} that
characterized]{.underline} the **[progressive utopianism]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} nineteenth-century [socialist movements]{.underline}
and fell out of favor amongst postmodernists for obvious reasons:

> Such [folk-political sentiments]{.underline}
> \[**[[ignorantly]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] ~~blindly~~
> **[[accept]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [neoliberal common
> sense]{.mark}, preferring to shy away from]{.underline} **[grand

> [**[posturing]{.underline}** [resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
> [[From]{.underline}]{.mark} the radical left's [[discomfort

> Williams)

One could see these green screen protests as an example of precisely
this "posturing resistance." [[If the unifying
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark} of the green screen protests
[[was]{.underline} **[hard]{.underline}** [to
identify]{.underline}]{.mark}[, perhaps it was because]{.underline}
**[[it was]{.mark} so [by design]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In an era of
[[protest]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[reject]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed
the [grand narratives of]{.underline} social and political
[[progress]{.mark} that [were]{.mark}]{.underline} apparently so
**[comprehensively]{.underline}** [[defeated by]{.underline}]{.mark}
late twentieth-century [[neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, the green
profile pictures operated as a communication device that reached the
same local network ecosystems of the tagged credits photos. Like the
title credits photos, green profile pictures themselves became a means
of communicating industry membership, participation, and identity. At an
individual level, they may have functioned positively for VFX
professionals: signaling solidarity amongst each other in a manner that
was difficult if not impossible for the large studios (who were not
their direct employers) to counteract or object to. [[In]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [**[absence]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
labor mobilization or even **[[concrete demands]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[beyond recognition and incremental improvements]{.underline} in labor
conditions, however, [[there was]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[palpable]{.underline}]{.mark}** [degree of]{.underline} distributed
**[[passivity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [about the protests]{.underline}.
In an environment where professionals under short-term contracts with
extremely stringent non-disclosure clauses are cautious to the degree of
paranoia about making public pronouncements, especially over labor
rights,6 the green profile pictures represented a form of passive
resistance to the events taking place over Rhythm and Hues.

### Refusal

The [boundaries to]{.underline} what can be thought as [[politics
in]{.underline}]{.mark} certain segments of [[the]{.mark}
post-structuralist and **anarchist [Left only benefit
capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some [activists and theorists
[think]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[micropolitical]{.mark}
activities]{.underline}, whether practices of [self-cultivation or
individual]{.underline} consumer [choices]{.underline}, [are **[more
important]{.mark} loci** of action [than large-scale]{.mark} organized
movement]{.underline} --- an assumption [which [adds
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[difficulty]{.mark} of building
new]{.underline} types of [organizations because it makes thinking in
terms of collectivity rarer]{.underline}, [harder]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} seemingly [less]{.underline} \"[fresh]{.underline}.\"
[Similarly]{.underline}, some [activists and theorists treat
[**aesthetic objects** and **creative works**]{.mark} as
displaying]{.underline} a [political potentiality missing from
classes]{.underline}, parties, and unions. This [aesthetic focus
[**disconnects** politics from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [organized
[struggle]{.mark} of working people]{.underline}, [[making
politics]{.mark} into [what spectators see]{.mark}]{.underline}.

its [position]{.underline} and the contradiction between this class and
the rest of us doesn\'t make itself felt as such. The [celebration of
momentary actions and singular happenings]{.underline} --- the [playful
disruption]{.underline}, the temporarily controversial film or
novel-works the same way. [Some]{.underline} on the anarchist and
post-structuralist Left [treat these **flickers** as]{.underline} the
only [proper]{.underline} instances of a [contemporary left
politics]{.underline}. A [**pointless action** involving]{.underline}
the [**momentary expenditure** of enormous effort]{.underline} --- the
artistic equivalent of the 5k and 10k runs to fight cancer, that is to
say, to increase awareness of cancer without actually doing much else
--- the sing[ular happening disconnects task from goal]{.underline}.
[Any]{.underline} \"[sense]{.underline}\" it makes, any [meaning or
relevance]{.underline} it has, is [up to the **spectator**]{.underline}
(perhaps with a bit of guidance from curators and theorists).

Occupation contrasts sharply with the singular happening. Even as
specific occupations emerge from below rather than through a coordinated
strategy, their common form-including its images, slogans, terms, and
practices-links them together in a mass struggle.

The power of the return of communism stands or falls on its capacity to
inspire large-scale organized collective struggle toward a goal. For
over thirty years, the [Left]{.underline} has [[eschewed]{.mark} such a
goal]{.underline}, [accepting]{.underline} instead [liberal
notions]{.underline} that [goals are **strictly individual** lifestyle
choices]{.underline} or social-democratic claims that history already
solved basic problems of distribution with the compromise of regulated
markets and welfare states, a solution the Right rejected and capitalism
destroyed. The Left [failed to defend a vision of [a better
world]{.mark}]{.underline}, an [egalitarian world of common production

[Yet it is this very growth that has prompted mounting concern within
discussions of overtourism.]{.underline} Again, as with sustainable
development broadly, [such [concern is]{.mark} commonly [met with
assertions that]{.mark} a shift to ["green growth" based in "decoupling"
can **reconcile** sustainability with continued economic
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline} (see e.g., United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), Citation2011a, Citation2011b). Yet abundant [[evidence
questions whether such green growth is **actually**
attainable]{.underline}]{.mark} (Fletcher & Rammelt, Citation2017;
Hickel & Kallis, Citation2019; Parrique et al., Citation2019[). And
[even if it were this would not address]{.mark} the [**social
implications** of tourism expansion]{.mark} at the heart of the
overtourism discussion.]{.underline}

Consequently, [questioning growth itself as the basis of sustainable
tourism has now become part of sustainable tourism
discourse]{.underline} (Büscher & Fletcher, Citation2017; Fletcher,
Citation2019; Hall, Citation2009, Citation2010; Higgins-Desbiolles,
Citation2010, Citation2018). Higgins-Desbiolles, for instance, asserts
that [[the global tourism industry "is addicted to growth]{.mark}, which
is [**incompatible** with sustainability goals]{.mark}"]{.underline}
(2018, p. 157). Consequently, she argues that achieving a truly
[["sustainable tourism]{.mark} [necessitates]{.mark} a clear-eyed
[engagement with notions of limits that the current culture of
**consumerism** and **pro-growth ideology**
precludes]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Higgins-Desbiolles, Citation2010, p.
125). Fletcher, similarly, calls for a ["new model \[of\] tourism
management, as well as economic governance more generally, that does not
depend on continual growth]{.underline}" (2019, p. 532). Yet achieving
this entails addressing the nature of the political-economic system
within which most tourism is embedded. We turn to this in the next
section.

[Frequently underappreciated within tourism studies is the extent to
which [the industry can be understood **not merely** as an instrument of
capitalist development]{.mark}]{.underline} (Britton, Citation1991;
Bianchi, Citation2009; Mosedale, Citation2011, Citation2016[) [but as a
**primary** means by which the capitalist system as a whole **sustains
itself** in the face of **fundamental contradictions** that threaten its
long-term survival]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fletcher, Citation2011). [This
analysis begins with understanding the ways that [various spatial and/or
temporal "fixes" help to resolve problems of capital
overaccumulation]{.mark} more broadly]{.underline} via displacing excess
capital through time and space and thereby helping to resolve crisis in
the short term (Harvey, Citation1982, Citation1989; Smith,
Citation1984). [As a principle capitalist industry, [tourism development
can be seen to offer a whole series of such fixes for the capitalist
system more generally]{.mark}]{.underline} (Fletcher, Citation2011;
Fletcher & Neves, Citation2012).

#### A degrowth model of tourism that dismantles broader capitalist structures and increases sustainability.

https://doi.org/10.1080/09669582.2019.1679822. \[NDG

From this political economic perspective, [current discussion of
[overtourism must be understood as a product of structural dynamics
within the global capitalist system as a whole.]{.mark}]{.underline}
This provides a very different vantage point than the common focus on
the ostensibly "anti-tourist" or even "tourism-phobic" attitudes
commonly ascribed to disgruntled residents (see Milano, Citation2017a;
Blanco-Romero, Blázquez-Salom, & Morell, Citation2018; Blanco-Romero,
Blázquez-Salom, Morrell, & Fletcher, Citation2020). Rather, it places
the focus squarely on [a systemic push towards tourism growth more
broadly pursued by powerful actors at local, national and global levels
simultaneously]{.underline}. Widespread pushback against overtourism is
thus a reflection of this campaign. [This response may therefore be
understood as something of a Polanyian double movement, in terms of
which [capitalist development commonly provokes popular resistance
contesting the negative impacts of this development]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Polanyi, Citation1944). More than this, it can be seen as what Nancy
Fraser labels a "triple movement" that goes beyond the state-centered
"social protection" central to Polanyi's analysis to advocate an
autonomous, emancipatory politics pursued beyond state institutions
(Fraser, Citation2013; Fraser & Jaeggi, Citation2018). [And if the
problem to which these movements respond is promotion of tourism growth
itself, [then a potential resolution to this conflict would be to
instead demand containment of such growth, either through social
protection]{.mark} (a double movement) [or]{.mark}, as we are
increasingly witnessing, [calls for tourism degrowth]{.mark} (a triple
movement) [altogether]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Degrowth of tourism is key to sustainable societies.

Within this diverse discussion, [[degrowth is understood in different
ways]{.mark}, from a narrow economic transformation to a far broader
cultural paradigmatic shift.]{.underline} [[Central to]{.mark} most
strands of [degrowth discourse]{.mark}, however, [is]{.mark} "[to
understand critically and undo the phenomenon of growth -- a material,
ecological, historical, discursive and institutional phenomenon that is
at the heart of the Western imaginary and its colonial dominance -- and
to propose alternatives to it]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Kallis,
Citation2018, p. 9). [[This]{.mark} project [comprises]{.mark} both
[macro- and micro-level initiatives]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the
macro-economic level, "degrowth refers to a trajectory where the
'throughput' (energy, materials and waste flows) of an economy decreases
while welfare, or well-being, improves" (Kallis, Citation2018, p. 9).
Specific proposals for implementing such a shift include:

resource and CO2 caps; extraction limits; new social security guarantees
and work-sharing (reduced work hours); basic income and income caps;
consumption and resource taxes with affordability safeguards; support of
innovative models of "local living"; commercial and commerce free zones;
new forms of money; high reserve requirements for banks; ethical
banking; green investments; cooperative property and cooperative firms.
(Kallis et al., Citation2012b, p. 175)

At the micro-level, meanwhile, degrowth proponents advocate activities
such as "cycling, car-sharing, reuse, vegetarianism or veganism,
co-housing, agro-ecology, eco-villages, solidarity economy, consumer
cooperatives, alternative (so-called ethical) banks or credit
cooperatives as well as decentralized renewable energy cooperatives"
(D'Alisa et al., Citation2013, p. 218).

[As a discussion emerging primarily from the high-income Global North,
[degrowth's applicability to low income and Southern societies has been
questioned]{.mark}]{.underline} (Escobar, Citation2015;
Rodríguez-Labajos et al., Citation2019). Thus Escobar depicts a
widespread perception "that degrowth is 'ok for the North' but that the
South needs rapid growth, whether to catch up with rich countries,
satisfy the needs of the poor, or reduce inequalities" (2015, p. 6).
[[Yet degrowth]{.mark} advocates commonly call not merely for economic
contraction but rather "contraction and convergence"]{.underline} --
that is, economic degrowth in societies experiencing excessive resource
use and (limited) growth in others. Yet growth alone cannot redress
inequality within a capitalist system based on uneven geographical
development (Smith, Citation1984). Hence, as Daly (Citation2008, p. 12)
reminds us, ["Without aggregate growth poverty reduction requires
redistribution." For degrowth to be "socially sustainable" (Martinez
Alier, Citation2009) in any society therefore [demands dramatic
redistribution in control of existing land, wealth and
resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[A [common misunderstanding equates degrowth with simple economic
decline or recession]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet as Kallis and colleagues
explain, "involuntary declines are not degrowth in themselves, and
countries in recession or depression are not degrowth experiments"
(2018, p. 294). In this sense, moments and places of crisis, economic
busts, burst financial bubbles, natural disasters, and similar events
have nothing to do with degrowth. [Rather, [degrowth can be
conceptualized as a "radical political and economic reorganization
leading to drastically reduced resource and energy
throughput"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kallis et al., Citation2018, p. 291)

[An important question concerns the extent to which degrowth is
compatible with a capitalist economy and society]{.underline} (Foster,
Citation2011; Liodakis, Citation2018). Raising this question some time
ago[, Foster indeed pronounced [degrowth within capitalism an
"impossibility theorem," arguing]{.mark}, "The ecological
struggle...must aim not merely for degrowth in the abstract but more
concretely for deaccumulation---a transition away from a system geared
to the accumulation of capital without end"]{.underline} (2011, p. 33,
emphasis in original). Responding to this challenge, Kallis and
co-authors indeed acknowledge that ["\[c\]apitalist economies
can...either grow or collapse: they can never degrow
voluntarily"]{.underline} (2012b, p. 177), and hence that degrowth
advocacy often "fails to explain how a capitalist economy would work
without a positive profit rate, a positive interest rate or
discounting." Summarizing this discussion more recently, Kallis
concludes, ["[Growth is part and parcel of capitalism: abandoning the
pursuit of growth requires a transition beyond
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}" (2018, p. 163). Yet in contrast to some
post-capitalist literature that envisions a future of abundance enabled
by information technology (i.e., the internet of things, which will,
ostensibly, lead to abolition of the law of value, echoing Rifkin's
(Citation2014) argument for a 'zero marginal cost' society) (e.g.,
Bastani, Citation2019; Mason, Citation2015; Srnicek & Williams,
Citation2015), degrowth advocates tend to eschew techno-promethean
utopias and instead take seriously the need for a metabolic shift
towards a future entailing living with less and with a lower footprint
(Kerschner, Wächter, Nierling, & Ehlers, Citation2018) -- what Latouche
(Citation2009) calls "frugal abundance" and Salleh (2009) "ecofeminist
sufficiency."

### Alt -- Solidarity Politics (v K Aff)

#### Status quo movements must engage one another---viewing problems as separate denies the [necessity of solidarity]{.underline}. Claims that the aff's struggle is most important [ignore political realities]{.underline} that require [coalitions]{.underline}.

https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/01/trump-black-lives-racism-sexism-anti-inauguration/\]

[[There is deep anger]{.mark} and disgust with the political status
quo]{.underline} in the United States. The [[Occupy]{.underline}]{.mark}
movement, [[B]{.underline}]{.mark}lack [[L]{.underline}]{.mark}ives
[[M]{.underline}]{.mark}atter, the heroic [[pipeline struggles]{.mark}
in North Dakota]{.underline}, and the thirteen million people who voted
for Bernie Sanders [have [unearthed that]{.mark}]{.underline} to the
world.

[When systemic problems become too large to ignore, when socialists
start gaining millions of votes]{.underline}, for example, [or when
black people riot]{.underline} and rebel [in the streets, the news media
is forced to provide some explanation]{.underline}. And in doing so,
they typically give us fractured glimpses of reality. But rarely do they
piece together the entire picture. [[Consider four]{.mark} separate news
[stories]{.mark}]{.underline} from last year.

The first is [the continuing]{.underline} crisis of the [opioid
addiction crisis]{.underline} in this country. [[There are two million
people addicted to opioids]{.mark} in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [[a disproportionate number]{.mark} of whom [are
white]{.mark}. From 2009 to 2014, almost half a million people have died
from opioid overdoses]{.underline}, a fourfold increase since 1999.

[A second story]{.underline}, briefly in the news, reported [on the
[decline in life expectancy for white women]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is
unprecedented for life expectancy to reverse in a so-called first-world
country. In the United States peer countries, life expectancy is
actually growing. [[Why]{.mark} is life expectancy for working-class
white women in decline? [Drug overdose, suicide, and alcohol
abuse]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[In Chicago, the story has been the rise in shootings and murders in the
city's working-class black neighborhoods]{.underline}. In 2016, there
were 4,379 people shot in Chicago, and 797 people killed. The
overwhelmingly majority of both were African-American.

The news media's nonsensical explanations for the violence include
retaliation. But that is only matched by the nonsense offered by elected
officials, which includes the absence of role models and poor parenting.
[What is almost never offered as at least part of the answer is how
[Chicago has the highest black unemployment rate]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the nation's five largest cities [at 25 percent, that nearly half of
black men aged 20 to 24 are neither in school nor employed, that Chicago
has the third-highest poverty rate of large cities in the US, and that
[it is the most segregated city in the country]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Finally, there is the story of the shrinking of the so-called middle
class]{.underline}. In the 1970s, 61 percent of Americans fell into that
vague but stable category. Today, that number has fallen to 50 percent.
It is driven by the growing wealth inequality that exists in this
country.

In the last year alone, the one percent saw their income rise by seven
percent, and the .1 percent saw their income rise by 9 percent. In
general, [[the richest 20 percent]{.mark} of US households [own 84
percent of the wealth]{.mark} in this country, [while the bottom 40
percent own less than one percent]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The media would have us believe that this is a story primarily about the
Rust Belt and disgruntled white workers. In fact, it is also a story
about 240,000 black homeowners, who lost their houses to foreclosures in
the last eight years. It is also a story about urban school closures and
the decimation of employment for black educators. Thousands of black
teachers have been fired in the last decade.

[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} four prominent
[[stories]{.underline}]{.mark} reported on over the last several years
[[are often told separately, reinforcing the perception that different
groups]{.mark} of ordinary people in this country live in their own
world and have experiences that [are **wholly separate from each
other**]{.mark}. But what would happen if we put these stories together,
and told them as a single narrative about life in this
country?]{.underline}

[[If we told them together, it could allow us to see that]{.mark} the
[anxieties]{.mark}, stresses]{.underline}, confusions, [and frustrations
about life]{.underline} world [today [are **not owned by one
group**]{.mark}, but are shared by many. It would not tell us that
everyone suffers the same oppression, but [it would allow us to see that
**even if we don't experience a particular kind of oppression**, every
working person]{.mark} in this country [is going through
something]{.mark}. Everyone is trying to figure out how to survive, and
many are failing]{.underline}.

[If we put these stories together, we would gain]{.underline} more
[insight into how]{.underline} ordinary [[white people have as much
stake in the fight]{.mark} for a different kind of society [as anyone
else]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[We wouldn't]{.underline}]{.mark} so [casually [dismiss their suffering
as privilege, because they do not suffer as much as black and brown
people]{.mark}]{.underline} in this country. In fact, we might find that
the privileges of white skin run very thin in a country where nineteen
million white people languish in poverty.

Apparently, [the wages of whiteness are not so great that they can stop
millions of ordinary white people from]{.underline} literally [drinking
and drugging themselves to death]{.underline}, to escape the despair of
living in this "greatest country on earth."

[If we put these separate stories into a single story, we could
make]{.underline} better [sense of why socialism is rising in
popularity]{.underline}, why people have taken to the streets over the
last six years to protest the growing and racial and economic
inequality. There are 400 billionaires in this country. They are the
reason why there are forty-seven million poor people. [You cannot have
untold, obscene wealth unless you have untold, obscene poverty. That is
the law of the free market]{.underline}.

And [[how does this]{.mark} parasitic [one percent]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the population [[hold onto their wealth]{.mark} when we are so many?
[**Racism, immigrant bashing, homophobia, transphobia, sexism,
nationalism** --- they get us to fight each other]{.mark} while they
hoard their wealth, [and they **keep our stories separate**]{.mark} from
each other, [so]{.mark} that [we never understand the entire story, only
our particular part]{.mark} of it]{.underline}.

But [[**knowledge alone** of]{.mark} the existence of [racism]{.mark},
inequality, poverty, and injustice **[does not
equip]{.mark}**]{.underline} with [[our side with the]{.mark} political
[tools needed to fight]{.mark} the battles]{.underline} of today or
fight [[for a socialist future]{.mark}. **We need struggle, but
[we]{.mark} also [need politics]{.mark}**, because we must contend with
a political establishment]{.underline} that wants to lower our
expectations, to believe that this existing society is the best that we
can expect from humanity.

Hillary Clinton ran a campaign of low expectations, a campaign that
cynically pivoted around the notion that ordinary people shouldn't ask
for too much. For all the excitement that Bernie Sanders' campaign
generated for rightly demanding more, his commitment to remaining in the
Democratic Party then threatens to neuter his political revolution.
Expecting the Democratic Party to fight for the democratic
redistribution of wealth and resources in this country is like expecting
to squeeze orange juice out of an apple. It is impossible.

We must build independent organizations and political parties that are
not connected to the Democratic Party, or that rise and fall with each
electoral cycle. [We have to build organizations that are democratic,
multiracial]{.underline}, and militant, [with a foundation in
solidarity]{.underline}.

[["Solidarity" meaning]{.mark} that [even if you don't experience a
particular oppression, it doesn't matter, because]{.mark} you understand
that as ordinary people, **[our fates are tied together]{.mark}**, and
that [one group's liberation is dependent upon the liberation of
all]{.mark} the oppressed and exploited]{.underline}.

Another world is possible. [Another U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is possible, but only if we organize and fight for
it]{.underline}. In closing, I want to quote from a note that was taped
to the front door of my son Ellison's daycare center on Inauguration
Day. It said simply: "Do not despair. Eyes wide open. Strength in
numbers. Keep the faith. And stay strong."

collegiate debater, I was part of it. In 2007, with a new child and a
struggling income, I walked into a U.S. Air Force recruiting center. I
shared my research, speechwriting, and public speaking skills in the
hopes that the service had a place for me. The recruiter had no
recommendation for what jobs fit the skills of a practiced critical
thinker and vocal communicator. As a result, I signed up for an "open
general" slot for basic training, which left me at the mercy of the
"needs of the Air Force." I was fortunate enough to volunteer and be
selected for the Air Force Honor Guard in Washington, DC, where I spent
my first years as an enlisted airman. But it wasn't until I attended the
Air Force's foundational noncommissioned officer training that I met an
intelligence analyst and discovered an Air Force career for which I felt
custom-built. I signed up to retrain into the operations intelligence
career field in 2013 and began working as an analyst with Air Force
Special Operations Command at Hurlburt Field, Florida. By June 2023, I
had graduated from National Intelligence University with a master of
science degree in strategic intelligence, written a thesis on U.S.
intelligence community measurements of whole-of-society defense
preparedness, and had the opportunity to brief multiple generals,
combatant commanders, and the secretary of the Air Force. My background
is not unique, and my career trajectory shouldn't be either. By making a

### Sustainable Development

#### The plan's development of the Arctic is [critical]{.underline} to transitioning to a [sustainable society]{.underline}.

are critical in achieving global sustainable development goals.\" Nature

[The principle of "leaving no one behind" necessitates the
**equitable**]{.underline} and uniform [implementation of]{.underline}
United Nations (UN) [**[sustainable development goals]{.mark}**
(**[SDGs]{.mark}**).]{.underline} Globally, socioeconomic resources are
predominantly allocated following the Pareto principle, where a minority
of high-income economies defined by World Bank Country and Lending
Groups1 control a substantial portion of the global wealth2. Efforts to
achieve SDGs should therefore prioritize addressing this imbalance,
guided by Liebig's law of the minimum. However, [ameliorating the
disparities in the **pursuit of SDGs**]{.underline} [[presents a
**considerable**]{.mark} **[challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[especially [in **polar regions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including the
**Arctic**, the]{.underline} Antarctic, and the Third Pole (the Tibetan
Plateau and surrounding high mountain areas)3,4,5. Polar regions,
covering approximately 20.1% (or \~300

106 km2) of the global land area and 16.7% (or \~600

106 km2) of the ocean area3, are recognized as outposts (or early
warning systems) of climate change6,7.

Meanwhile, [[these regions serve as **biodiversity reservoirs**]{.mark},
[**water towers**, and]{.mark} [**storage** of **climate driving
gases**]{.mark}]{.underline}[8]{.mark}. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[provide a **diverse array** of ecosystem **services** that [are
**critical** for **global sustainable
development**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the **[[fisheries in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Antarctic [[contribute to
achieving **zero hunger**]{.underline}]{.mark} (SDG2). [The sustainable
management of these fisheries is of great values to conserving and
sustainably [using **global marine resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(SDG14)9. The Third Pole, with its total annual runoff exceeding 650 109
m3, is vital for guaranteeing water security for downstream residents
(SDG6)10. [Furthermore, the protection and maintenance of high mountain
**[vegetation]{.mark}** [and **biodiversity** are]{.mark}
**[fundamental]{.mark}** [for the **global protection**]{.mark} [and
**restoration** of **terrestrial ecosystems**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(SDG15).

[However, sustainable development in polar regions has been largely
overlooked in the formulation of global SDGs]{.underline}11. A mere
0.75% of the SDG-focused studies during 2015--2022 have considered polar
regions, as indicated in our literature reviews (Supplementary Table 1).
Furthermore, the marginalization of polar regions is also reflected in
other international reports, such as the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) Global Environment Outlook (GEO) series12. Beginning
with GEO-213, polar regions have often been treated as side issues,
highlighting their consistent underrepresentation in global
environmental governance systems. In addition, there are currently no
specific SDG indicators for the Arctic or Antarctic regions. Although
mountain areas have garnered more attention than their polar
counterparts, only 3 out of the 248 SDG indicators are associated with
mountain regions14. [[This neglect of SDGs]{.mark} [in polar
regions]{.mark} is mainly [due to the misapprehension]{.mark} [that
sustainable development]{.mark} in [these areas is economically marginal
and would]{.mark} [**contribute minimally** to globa]{.mark}l **SDG
[efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [a belief stemming from their
**sparse** **populations** and **geographical remoteness**.]{.underline}

### Reformism Good

#### Reforming markets are our [best option]{.underline}, even if they aren't perfect.

Brian **Albrecht 24**. Chief Economist at the International Center for
Law & Economics. "I Read the Degrowth Paper, So You Don't Have To."
1/4/24.
https://www.economicforces.xyz/p/i-read-the-degrowth-paper-so-you

[[Markets]{.underline}]{.mark}---[through prices]{.underline}---[have a
way to tell users if something is wasteful]{.underline}. For households,
they have to spend the money and determine if the product is worth the
price. For businesses, [the profit and loss system helps provide the
information]{.underline}. If a company is making a loss, that is a sign
the company is turning more valuable inputs into less valuable output.
You get rewarded for creating value (turning less valuable inputs into
more valuable output) with profits.

[The profit and loss system isn't perfect]{.underline}. There are
externalities which do not factor into profit or loss but create or
destroy value for other people. Externalities are crucial in this
discussion, because degrowth is concerned with damage to the
environment, which tends to not get priced.

[Even though the price system is imperfect]{.underline}, [it **still can
[help us address environmental issues]{.mark}** and calculate
environmental usage]{.underline}. [Does the product use gasoline?
Lumber? Does it take land? All of **that will show up in
prices**]{.underline}. [With externalities, [prices]{.mark} are not
perfect conveyors of value but **they [give]{.mark} SOME
[information]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [If there are two identical
producers, except one tends to use more gasoline in their production,
[the **less efficient company**]{.mark} [will]{.mark} make smaller
profits and tend to [be **driven out of the
market**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The **[market will select for firms that
are]{.mark} relatively good at [using fewer resources]{.mark}**. Prices
and profit and loss do the work, if imperfectly.]{.underline}

[[Dismissing prices]{.mark} **simply [hides tradeoffs; it does not avoid
them]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Instead of using prices to think about
costs and benefits of different goods, degrowthers have to resort to
things like adding the weight of biomass and fossil fuels as a measure
of waste. Do we really want to try a mechanism that **[rewards firms
for]{.mark} [using fewer tons]{.mark} of "resources" [without regard
to]{.mark} [social value]{.mark}** of those resources?]{.underline} The
authors do not suggest that, but [it's the implicit idea if you say this
is a meaningful metric of waste.]{.underline}

Instead, [[prices allow people to **make tradeoffs in a coherent
manner**]{.mark}. They can decide whether the short time life of clothes
is worth the monetary savings]{.underline}.

To be fair, current institutional contours provide no end of fodder for
critique. We don't have prices where we should. We should find more ways
to price externalities when possible. Tell me what is not properly
priced and let's talk about how to price it.

[Prices and markets remain deeply imperfect but **[radical
overhaul]{.mark}** [demands]{.mark} **properly [weighing social costs

Over the last decade, the 'vanishing glacier' narrative used in the
media has triggered a new rise in glacier tourism and the 'last-chance
tourism' (LCT) trend (Groulx et al., 2016; Lam & Tegelberg, 2019). In
this context, LCT is occurring as a result of societal angst over
climate change prompting tourists to visit and experience 'endangered'
glaciers and associated natural environments before they ultimately
vanish (Abrahams et al., 2022). Polar bears, snow, and sea ice are other
typical LCT attractions (Varnajot & Saarinen, 2022), and the origin of
the LCT concept is found in Arctic and Antarctic tourism studies
(Eijgelaar et al., 2010; Lemelin et al., 2010). Although LCT is being
criticised for ignoring visitors' greenhouse gas emissions, which
further threaten vulnerable natural elements (Eijgelaar et al., 2010;
Lemelin et al., 2010), the LCT tourists' motivations to visit glaciers
and other threatened natural elements are linked to their connections to
nature and place attachment (Groulx et al., 2016). The place attachment
experienced by LCT tourists is based on their emotional connections to
nature and can provoke intentions to engage in pro-environmental
behaviour, which can be defined as 'an action by an individual or group
that promotes or results in the sustainable use of natural resources'
(Groulx et al., 2016; Lemieux et al., 2018; Salim et al., 2023; Salim &
Ravanel, 2023). [The LCT phenomenon is also tied to the status of
[melting glaciers]{.mark} as [a powerful symbol of climate
change]{.mark}: 'By the early twenty-first century, glaciers had reached
celebrity status, with almost all popular writers who discussed global
warming making glacier retreat a key component of their
story']{.underline} (Carey, 2007, p. 498). In 2019, [[activists and
scientists in Iceland held a funeral for]{.mark} the vanished
[Okjökull]{.mark}]{.underline}, the first Icelandic glacier lost to
climate change (Árnason & Hafsteinsson, 2020; Magnason, 2020). For
several years, the Presenna glacier in the Austrian Alps has been
covered in UV blankets during summertime to prevent melting (Bruns,
2021). These activities point to [**[an affective relationship between
humans and glaciers]{.mark}** that warrants greater study. The
[meaning]{.mark} and cultural significance of **[glaciers]{.mark} also
[manifest as]{.mark} a [salient component of place
attachment]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Allison, 2015; Sherry et al., 2018).
[Place attachment to a specific place [encompasses both physical and
social connections]{.mark} that individuals form with their surroundings
and [that]{.mark} are established through a multifaceted process of
meaning-making]{.underline} (Halpenny, 2010; Sebastien, 2020). [These
connections [develop]{.mark} into [a sense of self and identity;]{.mark}
in other words, [an individual's environmental surroundings shape their
understanding of themselves]{.mark}. Consequently, [environmental
events]{.mark} that [alter]{.mark} these surroundings or necessitate
relocation can [pose a threat to the individual's personal]{.mark} and
social [identities]{.mark}]{.underline} (Amundsen, 2015; Heyd, 2014)
[[and spur engagement of those affected]{.underline}]{.mark} (Groulx et
al., 2016; Lewicka, 2005). In our context, work in the human geography
and sociology of knowledge fields on nonhuman agency and relational
ontologies that seek to bridge the divide between society and nature is
particularly relevant. This work points to the need for different
ontologies that allow for experimental and embodied ways of knowing and
recognising affective and emotional relations to more than the human
world as an important precondition for climate action (Huijbens, 2021;
Nightingale et al., 2022; O'Brien, 2016; Stirling, 2019; West et al.,
2020). Such perspectives can also inform tourism geographic scholarship
that focuses on sustainability and climate action. [[Recognising the
relational nature of nonhuman agency]{.mark} in a web of humans and
practices, this article [show how nonhuman actants]{.mark} can [catalyse
pro-environmental behavior]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g Contesse et al.,

For several decades, how the material world interacts with the social
world has been of interest to geographers and science and technology
scholars. Human geographers, such as Sarah Whatmore and Nigel Thrift,
have deconstructed the subject--object dichotomy between humans and
nature and have thereby decentred human agency and shown how [notions of
wilderness are constituted by hybrid and heterogenous social
relationships]{.underline} (Thrift, 2004; Whatmore, 2002). We drew on
two theoretical concepts to conduct the analysis presented in this
article: boundary objects and nonhuman charisma. [We also rely on an
understanding of wilderness that acknowledge the construction of the
glacier as a hybrid entity, which again entails the redistribution of
social agency to that of the agency of things]{.underline} (Whatmore,
2002). This form of nonhuman agency can also manifest through charisma
(Lorimer, 2007). The charisma of nonhuman entities has primarily been
studied in conservation biology as a property of 'flagship' species,
which serve to aid environmental protection and thus display nonhuman
agency. Nonhuman charisma can be defined 'as the distinguishing
properties of a nonhuman entity or process that determine its perception
by humans and its subsequent evaluation' (Lorimer, 2007, p. 915) and as
'affective enchantment' (Barua, 2020, p. 679). In particular, Lorimer's
'feral charisma' is relevant to the study of glacier--human
relationships. Feral charisma is grounded in 'a sense of respect for the
other and for its complexity, autonomy and wildness' (Lorimer, 2007, p.
920). In contrast to the anthropomorphic 'cuddly charisma' that is
associated with panda bears and other flagship species, feral charisma
is expressed through wildness and chaotic characteristics. Thus, we
argue that feral charisma can be a property of non-living entities that
exhibit such characteristics. Charisma can be seen as the relational
qualities between the social and natural worlds that manifest through
affect and an ethical relationship (Lorimer, 2007). [Affect is
understood as a collection of shared and interconnected forces that
operate between bodies and, thus, it is not entirely the same as
emotions, which, in a relational perspective, could be seen as the
subjective encoding of the experience of these forces]{.underline}
(Anderson, 2006). Affect is both being 'attached' and being 'moved'
(Latimer & Miele, 2013), and Lorimer (2007) argued that, in terms of
conservation, affect is the force that drives people to get involved. In
addition, Nightingale et  al. showed that 'It is precisely at this
interface where the boundary is made between the 'we', the 'I', and the
'more than human', that affects flow, and where possibilities for
transformation open up or close down' (Nightingale et  al., 2022, p. 7).
Thus, affect that occurs as a response to the 'agency' of events and
changes in the more-than-human world can inspire transformative changes
in values and practices. The affective dimension of charisma is strongly
tied to care. Care is simultaneously a practice, an affection, and an
ethic (Puig de La Bellacasa, 2017) and can be extended to nonhuman
entities (Barua, 2020; Lorimer, 2007). Caring for nonhuman objects
creates the opportunity for intersubjective, mutual relations that
transcend the modernist duality between the social and natural worlds
(Huijbens, 2021; Jackson & Palmer, 2015; Stirling, 2019; West et  al.,
2018[). There is a growing call for caring practices that enable the
transformation to sustainability, which can be understood as 'affective,
ethical dispositions in looking after damaged and neglected
ecologies]{.underline} (of humans and nonhumans) (...)' (Arora, 2019, p.
1575). However, the challenge is to identify the venues where such
caring practices can have a tangible impact on broader sustainability
transformations. Charismatic entities can also serve as boundary objects
that connect different realms or epistemic communities, such as science
and the public (Lorimer, 2007; Star, 2010; Star & Griesemer, 1989).
Boundary objects 'have different meanings in different social worlds but
their structure is common enough to more than one world to make them
recognisable, a means of translation' (Star & Griesemer, 1989, p. 393).
Therefore, boundary objects enable translations of meaning and
significance across boundaries between different social realms. Melting
ice means different things to different epistemic communities. For the
tourist community, glaciers are a material venue for bodily experiences
and extraordinary sensory impressions, and awareness of melting ice may
spur tourists to undertake LCT. For the public, melting ice has become a
symbol and indicator of global climate change through the 'endangered
glacier narrative' (Carey, 2007; Moulton et  al., 2021). As Mahony
(2013) has shown, glaciers feature prominently in the scientific
discourse of climate change. Quantitative records of glacial-front
retreats and ice cores are used as proxies for the impact of climate
change and for understanding the historic and current physical dynamics
of climate change. [The power and effectiveness of boundary objects also
depend on the performances of boundary work---deliberate attempts to
connect different epistemic communities through mediation and
learning]{.underline} (Clark et  al., 2016; Dannevig et  al., 2020).
Glacier tourism actors, science communicators, and others may perform
such work, drawing on, funnelling, and enforcing glacial charisma. In
glacier tourism and other types of nature-based tourism, [the tourist's
experience---and thus the effectiveness of boundary work---is influenced
by the social relationship between the guide and client]{.underline}
(Løvoll & Sæther, 2022). This relationship is formed by the trust and
care that are established when venturing into a challenging environment.

problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. Economics is indeed at the core of the
problem. Or [rather]{.underline}: [**misguided** market forces

[One seeming solution then would be to simply [change our

[Some]{.underline}, like activist author Naomi Klein, [call for "taxing

**taxing the filthy**]{.underline}. [[Instead of "**sticking it to the

carbon]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Far from posing a fundamental problem to capitalism]{.underline},
[[it's capitalism]{.mark} with all its **[innovative and entrepreneurial

the looming [climate shock]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That's not a call for
letting markets run free]{.underline}. [[Laissez-

accent--- in theory. But it [**[can't work]{.mark}** in a situation
[where **prices don't reflect**]{.mark} **the [true costs]{.mark}** of

drive, really--- is what has gotten us into this current predicament.
[Properly [channeled]{.mark} human drive and [ingenuity]{.mark}, [guided

nature. According to Gottlieb movements such as Eco Marxism and Eco
socialism have therefore proposed that the environment cannot be
properly addressed without also disparaging of capitalism (2019, pp
173). Gottlieb does not necessarily accept this premise and offers that
"To begin, [[it is a mistake to believe cap]{.mark}italism [cannot be
reformed]{.mark}. [It has accommodated]{.mark} unions, the social safety
net, occupational health and safety regulations, and affirmative action.
[Environmental care]{.mark} need only another level of reform -- [and
can be shaped to benefit corporations and the general
public]{.mark}]{.underline} alike" (2019, pp 175). [From this it may be
suggested that capitalism and **[capitalist mechanics may be utilized to
advance the interest of nature and the environment]{.mark}** -- [if
reformed]{.mark} and applied towards this purpose. [Establishing deep
sea mining]{.mark} as an industry [may]{.mark} in other words **[be
carried out within a framework of cap]{.mark}**italism -- which has
proven vastly effective over time [-- yet still in service of bettering
the]{.mark} state of [environment]{.mark}. Capitalism has also proven an
effective vehicle for technology development and proliferation -- in a
world with fast approaching deadlines for change such efficiency may be
crucial.]{.underline} Gottlieb is addressing how one may go about
changing society. "...issues are technical as well as moral and
political. [Changes in environmental practices need to be both
technologically feasible and socially acceptable.]{.underline} If we
simply eliminate sexual harassment and racist jokes, no replacements are
needed. But we must provide energy and grow food even as we stop using
fossil fuels and carcinogenic pesticides."(2019, pp 169). This ties in
with allowing for a mineral economy to replace the fossil economy. It is
not, in the short perspective, demanding a shift away for modern life as
we know it. It is a substitution -- and could therefore be socially
acceptable. Technologically the substitution is feasible -- but it is
not an environmentally neutral solution. Gottlieb also addresses such
conundrums: "Morally, [[we are caught in a system we did not]{.mark}
[design]{.mark}, faced with unpleasant choices we would rather skip
over, torn between wanting a little more ease and a nagging conscience
that suggests such ease is not worth the moral cost, and sometimes
[compelled to choose]{.mark} [what]{.mark} we would like to think [is
the least bad]{.mark} of two distressing
alternatives]{.underline}"(2019, pp 150) In this case the unpleasant and
difficult choice in question is the tradeoff between mining the ocean
with adverse effects of uncertain or unknown magnitude -- to possibly
reduce the accelerating effects of fossil fuels on climate change and in
turn on nature.

### Perm -- Geothermal Aff

#### Perm do both -- hydrogen development through geothermal is key to transitioning away from capitalism

**Leung '25** (Rosaline Leung is a graduate from UCB in political
science and psychology; "THE ROLE OF ENERGY DEMOCRACY IN SHAPING THE
STRUGGLE BETWEEN CAPITALISM & RENEWABLE ENERGY -- HYDROGEN POLICY AS A
CASE STUDY"; April 2025) RCV

[I hold that [energy]{.mark}, unlike other commodities, [is a necessity
to the functioning of capitalism]{.mark} itself through enabling labour
and production]{.underline} (Bosch & Schmidt, 2019), wherein "the
intimate relationship between energy and development... and carbon and
growth... remain tightly coupled" Newell and Mulvaney (2013). [[The
significance of fossil fuels to]{.mark} the current rates of [capitalist
development]{.mark}]{.underline} (Huber, 2009; Gonzalez, 2012) [despite
their inherent environmental degradation [speaks to the fact
that]{.mark} "the [limitation]{.mark} of the fossil resource basis
inevitably [brings]{.mark} about [the end of the capitalistic
system]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Bosch & Schmidt, 2019). In a Gramscian
sense, [fossil [fuels]{.mark} are [tied]{.mark} [to]{.mark} both [the
political and economic faces of contemporary power]{.mark}: corporations
within capitalist systems rely on energy to fuel production, manufacture
goods, [and accumulate capital; whereas the capitalist state,]{.mark}
dependent on surplus capital production, [ensures]{.mark} that [the
ruling class receives the necessary energy]{.mark} to supply
production]{.underline} (Carroll, 2020). This close relationship prompts
governments and corporations to leverage their respective political and
economic forms of power to remove discussions of energy governance from
the sphere of the average citizen (Huber, 2013). [As a result, [fossil
capital and its associated power is centralized]{.mark} and provided to
private investors who are only accountable to themselves.]{.underline}
In summary, the primary goals of renewable energy and capitalism have
irreconcilable differences. Where renewable energies prioritize
sustainability over efficiency, capitalism seeks growth and capital
accumulation; where renewable energies support decentralization and
democratization, capitalism tends towards unequal distribution of power
and resources. These characteristics are intrinsic to each respective
system and thus renewable energies cannot be fully implemented within
capitalism without also compromising other aspects of its role in a just
transition. The two are incompatible, but capitalism, reinforced by path
dependency, prevails.

## Impact Answers

### Cap Sustainable

#### Capitalism is sustainable and there are [no limits]{.underline} to growth. 

Hannah **Ritchie 24**. Deputy Editor and Lead Researcher at Our World in
Data, and a researcher at the Oxford Martin Programme in Global
Development*. Not the End of the World : How We Can Be the First
Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet*. 2024. Chapter 1.
Sustainability: A Tale of Two Halves.

"[What about '**degrowth'**]{.underline} -- shrinking the economy --
instead? This argument hinges on the fact that, historically, economic
growth has been linked with more resource-intensive lifestyles. As we
got richer, we used more energy from fossil fuels, had a higher carbon
footprint, used more land and ate more meat. And [it's true that in a
world without **technological change**]{.underline}, [we'll be stuck
with fossil fuel power, petrol cars and inefficient homes]{.underline}.
But as the chapters that follow will show, [[new technologies]{.mark}
are [allowing us to **decouple**]{.mark} **a good**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [**[comfortable life]{.underline}** [from an
environmentally destructive one]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is what makes
it possible for us to be the first generation. [In rich countries
**carbon** [emissions]{.mark},]{.underline} **[[energy
use]{.mark},]{.underline}** deforestation, fertiliser use,
**[[overfishing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[plastic
pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, air pollution [[and]{.underline}
[**water** pollution are all
**falling**]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} while these countries
continue to get richer.vii [The [idea]{.mark} that these [countries
were]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[more sustainable]{.underline}**
[when]{.underline}]{.mark} [they were [poorer **is**]{.mark} **simply
[not true]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is another important reason why
degrowth will not build a sustainable future. Degrowth argues that we
can redistribute the world's wealth from the rich to the poor, giving
everyone a good and high standard of living with the resources already
at our disposal. But the maths doesn't check out.20 [The world **is far
too poor**]{.underline} [to give everyone a high standard of
living]{.underline} today **[through redistribution
alone.]{.underline}** We can see this with a quick thought experiment.
Let's imagine that every country in the world ends up like Denmark.
Almost all its population lives above the \$30 poverty line that most
rich countries adopt, and it is one of the most equal countries in the
world.21 That's what I want: everyone in the world to live a
comfortable, poverty-free life, and in a society with low levels of
inequality. In this scenario, we're going to do a global redistribution:
all the countries that are richer than Denmark are brought down to its
average level of income, and all the countries that are poorer -- which
is 85% of the global population -- are brought up to it. There are no
inequalities between countries, and inequalities within countries are
"also shrunk massively. Would it be possible to achieve this by just
redistributing the world's money? No: [the global economy would have to
be at least **five times bigger**]{.underline} [than it is
today.]{.underline} That's right: to lift everyone "out of poverty, with
a level of equality like Denmark, [the global economy would need
to]{.underline} **[increase five-fold]{.underline}**. If everyone in the
world lived on \$30 per day with zero inequality (so the richest and
poorest both get \$30), the global economy would need to more than
double. [A world without economic growth would remain a **very poor
one**]{.underline}. I'm agnostic about growth in rich countries, but the
data is clear that we need strong economic growth globally to end
poverty, even with lots of redistribution. [Historically, countries have
become **rich** from fossil fuels and other resources]{.underline}.
[That means many people now assume that growth equals
'**bad'**.]{.underline} [But there is no reason **for it to stay** that
way]{.underline}. [If a country]{.underline}, or an individual for that
matter, [can lead the way in providing]{.underline} a
**[cheap]{.underline}**, **[low-carbon energy]{.underline}** [source
that could power the world, I would be more]{.underline} than
**[happy]{.underline}** for them [to get rich from it]{.underline}. And
they could. [There is a massive '**solutions vacuum'**]{.underline} [for
our environmental problems]{.underline}. [The [early movers]{.mark} in
this space can [build a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[prosperous
economy]{.underline}** [while **building
solutions**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to our problems]{.underline} at the
same time. [Countries can '**grow'**]{.underline} [by leading the way
on]{.underline} '**[good' technologies]{.underline}**, not just
exploiting polluting ones. This leads to another argument, which is that
having money gives us options. [The solutions and [technologies]{.mark}
we need to]{.underline} **[fix]{.underline}** [our environmental
problems [have become]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[viable]{.underline}**]{.mark} [only in the last few
decade]{.underline}s. Some, such as **[solar energy]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[electric vehicles]{.underline}**, [only in the last
few years]{.underline}. Before then, these technologies did not exist or
were far too expensive. [They've become competitive through]{.underline}
[**years of investment** and]{.underline} **[development]{.underline}**
-- [and that has needed **extra cash**]{.underline} from governments and
entrepreneurs. [For hundreds of thousands of years, burning wood was the
**only source** of '**controllable'** heat and light that our ancestors
had.]{.underline} Then, [a few centuries ago, our ancestors]{.underline}
[**acquired** a couple more]{.underline} -- albeit
[destructive]{.underline} -- [options]{.underline}: whale oil and coal.
But we've only had real choice in the last few years. [[Economic growth
is not **incompatible**]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark}
[reducing our [environmental impact]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this book
I'll show that [[we can]{.mark} **reduce our environmental
impact**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[[reverse our past
damage]{.underline}]{.mark}** while becoming better off. The big
question here is whether we can decouple these impacts fast enough. The
answer to that depends on what actions we take today.

#### "Complexity is wrong." Capitalism is [sustainable and politically resilient]{.underline}. 

Daniel **Drezner 23**. Professor of international politics at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a
nonresident senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, "Are
we headed toward a "polycrisis"? The buzzword of the moment, explained,
https://www.vox.com/23572710/polycrisis-davos-history-climate-russia-ukraine-inflation

[[The]{.mark} deeper [flaw in the polycrisis logic is the presumption
that one]{.mark} systemic crisis [will **inexorably** lead to negative
feedback]{.mark} effects that cause **other systems** to tip into
crisis.]{.underline}

If this assumption does not hold, then the whole logic of a single
polycrisis falls apart. To their credit, the Cascade Institute authors
acknowledge that this might not happen, but [they posit: "it seems more
likely that causal interactions between systemic crises will worsen,
rather than diminish, the overall emergent impacts."]{.underline}

[At first glance, this seems like a plausible assumption to make.
Remember, however, that the [proponents of]{.mark} a [polycrisis]{.mark}
also [assert]{.mark} that the [systems]{.mark} under stress [are
**highly complex**]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading to unpredictable
cause-and-effect relationships. If that is true, then
[[presuming]{.mark} that [one]{.mark} systemic [crisis would]{.mark}
automatically **[exacerbate stresses]{.mark}** in other systems [seems
premature]{.mark} at best and skewed at worst.]{.underline}

Indeed, [over the last year [there have]{.mark} been at least two
[examples of one]{.mark} systemic [crisis]{.mark} actually [**lessening
stress** on another system.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly centralized autocracy
generated [a [**socioeconomic disaster** in the form of "zero
Covid]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} lockdowns. Xi Jinping kept that
policy in place long after it made any sense, accidentally throttling
China's economy. The timing of China's lockdown [was
fortuitous]{.underline}, however, [as stagnant Chinese demand [helped
prevent]{.mark} an **[inflation]{.mark}ary spiral** [from
getting]{.mark} any [worse.]{.mark} China's [exit]{.mark} from
zero-Covid [will]{.mark} likely also [be **countercyclical**,
jump-starting]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark} at a time when other
regions tip into recession.]{.underline}

Another weird, fortuitous interaction has been the one between climate
change and [Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. As Europe aided
Ukraine and resisted Russia's blatant, illegal actions, Russia
retaliated by cutting off energy exports. Many were concerned that
Russia's counter-sanctions would make this winter extremely hard and
expensive for Europe.

[[Climate change]{.mark} may have [provided a]{.mark} weird
[**geopolitical assist** to Europe]{.mark}, however. The warming climate
is likely connected to [Europe's]{.mark} extremely [temperate]{.mark}
fall and [winter]{.mark}. That, in turn, has [required **less
electricity** for heating, leaving]{.mark} the continent with plenty of
[energy reserves]{.mark} to last the winter.]{.underline} Russia's
ability to wreak havoc on the European economy has been circumscribed.

None of this is to say that systemic crises cannot exacerbate each
other. Just because a polycrisis has not happened yet does not mean one
is not on the horizon. Just as one buys insurance to guard against
low-probability, high-impact outcomes, policymakers and elements of
civil society need to guard against worst-case scenarios.

[As a term of art, however, "[polycrisis" distracts more than it
adds]{.mark}. It mostly seems like a device to make people care about
the **Really Bad Things** that climate change can do, without turning
people off by warning them yet again about the hazards of climate
change.]{.underline}

### Cap Good -- Resources 

#### Capitalism can [solve]{.underline} resource constraints through innovation. 

Dr. Alessio **Terzi 22**. PhD in Political Economy from the Hertie
School, Economist at DG ECFIN of the European Commission, lecturer at
HEC Paris and Sciences Po (Lille), an Affiliate Fellow at Bruegel, the
leading European economics think-tank, and a Fulbright Scholar at the
Harvard Kennedy School, MPA in economic policy from the London School of
Economics, "Growth for Good: Reshaping Capitalism to Save Humanity from
Climate Catastrophe", Harvard University Press, ebook

[The concern that]{.underline} some **[input material]{.underline}**
[will come to an end]{.underline}, [and that this crisis will deal a
**fatal blow to civilization**]{.underline}, [is a **recurrent theme in
history**]{.underline}. [In **Britain**, the fear]{.underline} [was
expressed in the age of sail that when the country was depleted of
oak,]{.underline} the fundamental wood [used in
shipbuilding]{.underline} and masts at the time, [the country would
become defenseless at sea. Clearly, this did not happen]{.underline};
[eventually iron replaced the need for wood]{.underline}, and in the
meantime, sufficient supplies came through trade with Scandinavia, the
Baltics, and North America. [For goods that cannot be
replaced]{.underline}, [prices generate **strong
incentives**]{.underline} [to become better at **extracting** and
**recycling** them]{.underline}.38 [Think of **copper**, which has good
properties as an electrical conductor. As electrification was in full
swing in the early twentieth century in the United States, geologist and
copper-mining expert Ira Joralemon warned that "the age of electricity
and of copper will be short]{.underline}. At the intense rate of
production that must come, [the copper supply of the world will last
hardly a score of years]{.underline}.... [Our civilization based on
electrical power will dwindle and die]{.underline}." One century later,
we can see that [this prediction **did not age well**]{.underline}.

[[It is **not**]{.mark} **even [a necessity]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} the
**bulk**]{.underline} [of our [tech]{.mark}nological [solutions]{.mark}
must [be based on **geological materials**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Think]{.underline}]{.mark}[, for example, [of]{.mark} recent research
on **[fertilizers]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [based on the
[discovery]{.mark} [that]{.mark} certain **[bacteria]{.mark}** [can
capture]{.mark} atmospheric nitrogen]{.underline}, [without the high
**pressures** and **temperatures**]{.underline} [of the polluting
Haber-Bosch process described above.]{.underline} Likewise, [the
[**research frontier** is shifting toward **new materials**]{.mark},
opening up the possibility of producing consumer goods with algae-based
**bioplastic**]{.underline}. It would seem that [if the twentieth
century was characterized by the triumph of inorganic
chemistry,]{.underline} **[the twenty-first might well be the century of
[organic materials]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,
**[repurposed]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to **meet human
needs**]{.underline}. [This age is being ushered in by [the advent of
**biotechnology**]{.mark} which, also thanks to recent advances like
Crispr / Cas9, [will provide **powerful tools**]{.mark} to **address
current challenges**]{.underline}, [from [reducing]{.mark} the [use of
pesticides]{.mark} and herbicides in agriculture to [fostering **natural
carbon sequestration**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[**Innovation**]{.mark} not only [yields]{.mark} **new technologies**
and **products**]{.underline}, [but also allows more **[value]{.mark}**
to be extracted [from what is **already
available**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Under the heading of more efficient
material use falls, for example, the idea of the circular economy, in
which society is organized to reuse or recycle extensively, and rely
less on new material extraction.]{.underline} [[The **digital
revolution** has]{.mark} also [caused the economy to be]{.mark} more and
more "**[dematerialized]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [in production and
consumption, as it becomes more based on **intangible
goods**]{.underline}.39 This is what economist Danny Quah refers to as
the "weightless economy." [Another push toward more efficient use of
reduced material inputs is known as [the "**sharing economy**]{.mark},"
as seen recently in urban settings with cars, mopeds, home rentals, and
coworking space]{.underline}s. Under this model, [people shift from
individual ownership of an asset to an arrangement, usually employing
digital technology, by which it can be shared by multiple users,
collectively **[extract]{.mark}**ing [more utility out of the
same]{.mark} amount of [material]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Andrew [McAfee shows]{.underline} in More from Less [the extent to which
the [American economy has **dematerialized**]{.mark} since the
1970s]{.underline}, including [by [**slashing** its **consumption**
of]{.mark} virtually **[all]{.mark}** the seventy-two [material
resources]{.mark} tracked by the US Geological Survey, including
minerals, timber, and cement, whether domestically sourced or
imported]{.underline}. In its agricultural sector, [the United States
managed to increase crop production by 35 percent]{.underline} between
1982 and 2015, [while reducing the use of fertilizers and returning to
nature an amount of land equivalent to the state of
Washington]{.underline} (45 million acres). [The same combination of
productivity enhancements and dematerialization has allowed many
advanced economies to see **reforestation** and **economic growth**
progressing]{.underline} [**together** over the past three
decades]{.underline}.40 To sum up this discussion, an old quip might
suffice: [The]{.underline} **[Stone Age]{.underline}** [did not come to
an end because we ran out of **stones**]{.underline}. Likewise, [the age
of **oil and gas** will not end because we will run out of those, and
[**innovation** will not come to an end because we run out of **material
inputs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While in **theory**,]{.underline} [and
strictly speaking of physical inputs, it is **conceivable** that a
finite planet could be depleted of all materials **at
once**]{.underline}, **[as a practical reality this is not a
concern]{.underline}**. [Assuming that point were ever reached, it would
be **in a future so distant that**, by then, our material sources would
**probably not be confined to this planet.**]{.underline}

Christophers should correct his profound scientific illiteracy and
appreciate the massive emissions reductions capitalism has achieved in
the West, and [place blame for rising global emissions]{.underline}
where it belongs: [on China.]{.underline} Indeed, environmental
disasters in China aren't limited to just emissions. They actually are
so widespread they boggle the Western capitalist mind. The [capital of
[Beijing]{.mark} is so [inundated with air pollution]{.mark} that
[spending]{.mark} just [one day]{.mark} there could be [equivalent
to]{.mark} **smoking [40 cigarettes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, according to
the Economist. And that's in the center of power, with smog so bad it
must really be seen to be believed. The American embassy in Beijing
tracks air quality to determine if residents should duct-tape their
homes shut. After bad press compelled China to make some progress in
combating Beijing's smog (mainly by moving coal plants to surrounding
provinces, worsening air quality elsewhere), last year the city's air
quality again plummeted. The Washington Post blames the deterioration on
China's "economic reliance on coal-fired power and polluting heavy
industries such as steel, aluminum and cement." [So much for communist
economies prioritizing the environment!]{.underline} But [communist
**[ecological catastrophes]{.mark}**]{.underline} aren't limited to
today's China. They're [an **[inherent feature]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of]{.mark} **[Marxist]{.mark} state[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Just
look at the [Aral Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}. It was once the
fourth-largest lake in the world. Then the [Communist [S]{.mark}oviet
[U]{.mark}nion followed its **ideological [dogma]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
"the [transformation of nature]{.mark}" and began to destroy it starting
in the 1960s in favor of a series of cotton-irrigation
programs.]{.underline} Today, [the Aral Sea is about a [**tenth** of its
**original size**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The transformation has crushed
once-prosperous fishing communities, [devastated natural
pollution-control mechanisms]{.underline}, and spread deserts across the
region. [**[Communists]{.mark} [triggered]{.mark}** a massive ecological
collapse so serious former United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-moon
called it "one of **the [planet's worst environmental
disasters]{.mark}**."]{.underline} Meanwhile, [global **[CO2
emissions]{.mark}** [per **dollar of**]{.mark} **economic
[output]{.mark}**]{.underline} [have **steadily
[declined]{.mark}**]{.underline} [since the 1960s, largely [due to **new
tech**]{.mark}**nologies** [and **market incentives**]{.mark} compelling
businesses to constantly seek to reduce their energy costs]{.underline}.
A worldwide retreat from capitalism and embrace of less efficient
economic systems would endanger that trend. [To protect the environment,
**we need more capitalism**, not less.]{.underline}

### Cap Good -- War 

#### No one system "[causes]{.underline}" war, but [capitalism]{.underline} is the [closest]{.underline} to preventing it.

Tim **Krieger &** Daniel **Meierrieks 24**. Wilfried Guth Professor of
Constitutional Political Economy and Competition Policy at the
University of Freiburg, PhD in economics from the University of Munich.
Senior Researcher with the Department for Migration, Integration and
Transnationalization at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, PhD in
economics from the University of Paderborn. *Handbook of Research on
Economic Freedom*. Edward Elgar Publishing. 360-363.

First, economic freedom is associated with the freedom to
**[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** internationally as well as the
promotion of economic exchange within a country (e.g., by removing
regulations that would complicate internal trade and exchange).
Consequently, economic freedom [[creates]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
**[[interdependencies]{.underline}]{.mark}** between people and regions
(i.e., domestically) as well as between countries (i.e.,
internationally). These interdependencies, in turn, ought [[to
**disincentivize conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, in a
world of economic interdependencies, [economic bonds could be
**destroyed** in a war, making peace]{.underline} and war [a matter of
**cost-benefit calculus**]{.underline}, with the destroyed bonds
constituting a high cost for any expected utility-maximizing government
(Schneider 2010). In a similar vein, while economic freedom may allow
for the substitution of trading partners, potentially reducing bilateral
interdependencies, thus making conflict more likely (Martin et al.
2008), **[[multilat]{.mark}eral]{.underline}** economic
[interdependencies]{.underline} within a globalized world (as
facilitated by economic freedom) may [[lead]{.underline}]{.mark}
economically invested [[**third parties** to show]{.underline}]{.mark}
their [[disapproval of]{.underline}]{.mark} bilateral
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} by sending trade-based signals of
resolve (Kinne 2014). This holds not only for interstate war but also
for internal war, which some trading partners may aim to stop through,
for example, interventions (Bussmann and Schneider 2007; Powell and
Chacha 2016).

Second, [economic [freedom is]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[linked
to]{.underline}]{.mark} low levels of taxation and [[small
government]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., measured as government
expenditure as a share of total GDP). [[If]{.underline}]{.mark}
potential [[participants]{.underline}]{.mark} of conflict [are
motivated]{.underline} by a desire [to **[capture rents]{.mark}**, a
[small]{.mark}er [government constitutes a **smaller
prize**]{.mark}]{.underline} that would have to be compared with the
payoff from non-violence. Consequently, for example, as shown in Kirk's
(1983) model, [smaller governments]{.underline} (as a consequence of
economic freedom) are expected to [see **less conflict**]{.underline}
compared with larger governments (where the prize of conflict is
comparatively larger).

Third, economic freedom may be conducive to economic growth and
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}**, e.g., as higher levels of
economic freedom [[coincide with]{.mark} stronger [property
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}; stronger [[property
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[incentivize
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} and thus, ultimately, productivity gains
and economic development (see de Haan and Sturm 2024 in this volume).
Similarly, Vadlamannati and de Soysa (2014) argue that sound legal
institutions that safeguard [profits [create incentives for]{.mark}
investment into]{.underline} (**[[civilian]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[production]{.mark}, making this]{.underline} type of investment
[[**more attractive** than]{.underline}]{.mark} investment into
[[war]{.mark}fare]{.underline}. As a final example, [economic freedom
may]{.underline} help to [channel]{.underline} the struggle caused by
incompatible (economic) goals into a [competition]{.underline} for [but
not]{.underline} a [conflict]{.underline} over mobile financial,
physical or human capital; here, economic exchange acts as a signaling
and communication device (O'Neal and Russett 1999; Gartzke et al. 2001).
Mobile capital, in turn, is an important input for economic growth and
development (e.g., Grossman and Helpman 1993). For instance, Gartzke
(2005, p. 32) di\\scusses how economic freedom interacts with
international factor mobility:

> Economic freedom means you can take \[your wealth\] with you. When
> conditions get bad domestically, capital can leave the country,
> creating an economic, and thus political, drain on the society.
> Obviously, governments do not want money to leave. To the degree that
> sovereigns are unable to stop the flight of capital, however, they
> must create conditions that favor the voluntary retention of money
> within their borders.

By fostering **[economic [success]{.mark}]{.underline}**, higher levels
of economic freedom [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[make]{.mark} it
[less]{.mark} likely]{.underline} that potentially violent [actors will
have]{.underline} to engage in conflict to satisfy their
**[[greed]{.underline}]{.mark}** for resources or accommodate their
economic grievances, [given]{.underline} that [more resources will be
available]{.underline} to them [through]{.underline} the marketplace in
the process of economic **[development]{.underline}**. The basic
underlying assumption here is that the probability of an internal and
international war to occur is a decreasing function of per capita income
(e.g., Collier and Hoeffler 1998; Schneider 2010).

Fourth, [[economic freedom]{.mark} may be [linked
to]{.mark}]{.underline} other **[[institution]{.underline}]{.mark}**al
outcome**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are [conducive to
non-violent]{.underline} conflict [resolution]{.underline}. For
instance, a sound [[**rule of law** is a crucial]{.mark} element
of]{.underline} sound [market]{.underline} institution[s]{.underline}.
At the same time, [a]{.underline}n impartial and [functioning
**judiciary**]{.underline} also [underpins democratic
development]{.underline} (e.g., Larkins 1996). Indeed, [economic
[freedom and democracy are]{.mark}]{.underline} usually **[[positively
related]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see Choutagunta and Gutmann 2024 in this
volume) and argued to give rise -- in combination -- to a (capitalist
and) democratic peace (Russett 1993; Rummel 1997). What is more,
[economically free countries are characterized by]{.underline} a wide
[[**dispersion of power** because of market]{.underline}]{.mark} and
political [[competition]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, [this may
[prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} (small) [[**elites** from
abusing]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[power]{.underline}]{.mark} to start
conflicts out of self-interest and at the expense of not only their
enemies but also domestic non-elites.

Fifth, [economic [freedom may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[foster
**values**]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [conducive to
peace]{.underline}. Indeed, the idea of doux commerce (voiced by
Montesquieu and others) already emphasized the 'civilizing' potential of
economic exchange as such exchange is argued to produce gentleness,
honesty and understanding during the Enlightenment. In detail, [economic
freedom may [promote]{.mark} **social trust** and
**[tolerance]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Berggren and Jordahl 2006;
Berggren and Nilsson 2013). For instance, large and free markets (which
are likely outcomes of high levels of economic freedom) facilitate trust
in others [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} such trust makes it more likely
to engage in voluntary [**transactions** and]{.underline} build
long-lasting **[[business relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially
when market participants do not know each other (e.g., Platteau 2000).
Trust, [tolerance]{.underline} and related values, in turn,
[[make]{.mark} it [less]{.mark} likely that [conflict]{.mark} breaks
out]{.underline}, e.g., because religious cleavages are less likely to
be influential (e.g., Weingast 1998).

In sum, conceptualizing violent conflict as a function of cost--benefit
considerations of potential conflict participants (e.g., states,
insurgent or terrorist groups) that respond rationally to (economic)
incentives, we can discuss how economic freedom may matter to the
emergence of conflict. More specifically, one could think of a
theoretical framework in which economic freedom (or specific aspects of
economic freedom) affects directly or indirectly (via certain mediators)
the incidence of peace or conflict. In addition, there may be moderating
factors that make the link between economic freedom and peace or
conflict more or less relevant; for instance, this may concern regional
and institutional bonds (e.g., the European Union considers itself
explicitly as a peace project; Birchfeld et al. 2017) or a shared
ethnicity or religion (e.g., Woodwell 2004).

Indeed, [[there are **various pathways**]{.underline}]{.mark} through
which higher levels of economic freedom are expected to reduce the
likelihood of different types of conflict, including, for example,
increased economic interdependencies, strong levels of economic
development as well as the development of sound, democratic, pro-peace
institutions and values. At the same time, we acknowledge that [[not
all]{.mark} types of conflict [are]{.mark}]{.underline} anticipated to
be affected by economic freedom (and its specific sub-categories) in
[[the same]{.underline}]{.mark} way. For instance, one may hypothesize
that the promotion of international trade through the dismantling of
trade barriers (which would indicate higher levels of economic freedom)
may be especially relevant to conflict between states. Similarly, [while
[the overall effect]{.mark}]{.underline} of economic freedom on conflict
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} expected to be [[**favorable**, we **cannot**
identify a **single** mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark} (mediator)
[that]{.underline} alone [explains this]{.underline} relationship. In
other words, specific ingredients of economic freedom (while related to
non-violence in theory) may not be sufficient to guarantee a peaceful
outcome. For instance, again consider international trade and interstate
war. When threats are highly asymmetric, one's opponent may consider the
reluctance to endanger the benefits of prosperous economic ties as
weakness (Gartzke 2005). In this situation, even for positive-sum games
it has to be guaranteed that 'all possible participants must be
unwilling to play the game of chicken or, indeed, to use military force'
(Gartzke 2005, p. 32). Hence, the opportunity costs of foregoing one's
share in the mutual benefits from trade are -- alone -- insufficient to
guarantee peace.

EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

Having discussed various mechanisms through which economic freedom may
influence violent conflict, in this section we discuss the empirical
evidence that relates (higher levels of) economic freedom to (reduced)
international conflict, i.e., conflict between states, as well as to
reduced internal conflict in the form of civil war and terrorism.

Economic Freedom and Interstate War

A first set of studies considers the effect of higher levels of economic
freedom on the emergence of violent conflict between two or more
nation-states. For instance, this type of conflict may take the form of
a militarized interstate dispute (i.e., the display of military force
short of war by one state explicitly directed towards another state) or
a conflict that involves a minimum level of battle deaths to qualify as
a full-blown war (Anderton and Carter 2011).

[A **number** of [empirical studies]{.mark} provide evidence [in favor
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[capitalist peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
where sound economic institutions (i.e., high levels of economic
freedom) coincide with a reduced likelihood of militarized disputes and
warfare between nation-states (e.g., Gartzke et al. 2001, Mousseau et
al. 2003; Souva 2004; Mousseau 2005, 2009; Gartzke 2007; McDonald 2010).
For example, Gartzke (2007) [examines [a **global
sample**]{.mark}]{.underline} of countries [[between]{.mark}
**19[50]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **19[92]{.mark}**[,
find]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that high levels of external [openness
discourage conflict]{.underline} between states.

Consistent with our theoretical discussion above, several [empirical
contributions highlight the role]{.underline} international [**trade**
plays]{.underline} in creating economic interdependencies and wealth
that disincentivizes interstate conflict (e.g., Hegre 2000; Gartzke and
Li 2003; Gelpi and Grieco 2008). International trade ought to be fueled
by high levels of economic freedom, e.g., by means of low tariffs and
low trade regulations. Other voices emphasize the role sound economic
institutions may play in the development of institutions and values that
promote equality, tolerance and respect for the rights of others (e.g.,
Mousseau 2009).

In sum, [**many** empirical studies suggest]{.underline} that there is a
**[[capitalist peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with countries that are
economically free being less likely to engage in conflict with other
countries. At the same time, this finding points to one important aspect
that is also the subject of academic debate. How does economic
liberalism (high levels of economic freedom) interact with political
liberalism (high levels of political freedom) and how do both variables
affect conflict (e.g., Schneider 2014)? In this contribution, we cannot
discuss at length the nuances of the literature on the capitalist peace
vis-à-vis the democratic peace. However, our reading of the capitalist
peace literature highlights two major points. First, sound economic
institutions appear to lead to less interstate conflict independent of
the effect of democracy (e.g., Gartzke et al. 2001; Mousseau et al.
2003). Second, it is possible that economic and political freedom
reinforce each other, with both also potentially sharing a beneficial
relationship with economic development, suggesting that rich,
[economically **and** politically liberal countries]{.underline} may
[see]{.underline} especially [low levels of]{.underline} international
[conflict]{.underline} (e.g., Mousseau 2005).

The reflections developed show how [[sustainable development can be

[into]{.mark} the logics of [the]{.mark} [trad]{.mark}itional

involve balancing economic growth with environmental protection,

examples demonstrate [that [cap]{.mark}italism [itself]{.mark}, through
its competitive mechanisms, can serve as a tool to [incentivize
sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sustainable labeling, the
recognition of environmental performance by financial institutions, and

[food security and environmental sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline}
also reveals that regulatory tools, such as decoupled payments and

1308/2013, represent an effective point of balance. These tools not only
foster sustainability but also [[ensure sufficient long-term
productivity]{.mark}, contributing]{.underline} to a balanced
transformation of economic sectors. Ultimately, sustainable development
is not an alternative to the existing economic model but its evolution.

The article examines the [complex]{.underline} relationship between
environmental sustainability and food security, proposing a model of
green capitalism inspired by historical challenges and contemporary
contexts. Drawing from Jared Diamond, it explores parallelism between
the collapse of past civilizations and current environmental risks,
exacerbated by climate change and global interconnectedness. Carlo
Cipolla's analysis of historical transformations, such as the communal
and industrial revolutions, provides a useful [framework for mapping
paths toward economic sustainability]{.underline}. The Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2023--2027 and the European Green Deal emerge
as central instruments for integrating sustainability and food security
objectives. [Decoupled payments and enhanced conditionality reflect a
regulatory approach aimed at reducing environmental impact without
compromising agricultural productivity.]{.underline} However, challenges
such as regulatory complexity and the need for local adaptability arise.
The article discusses the role of the CAP in the transition toward
resilient agriculture, balancing economic and environmental needs. [It
advocates for [sustainable capitalism grounded in]{.mark} green
principles and [innovative collab]{.mark}oration[s,]{.mark} emphasizing
the importance of cultural and legislative shifts to achieve a balance
between economic growth and planetary preservation]{.underline}. In
recent years, [the transition toward [a sustainable econ]{.mark}omy has
[become]{.mark} a [global imperative]{.mark},]{.underline} driven by the
urgency [to address escalating environmental crises, mitigate the
effects of climate change,]{.underline} and [ensure food security in a
context of finite resources and a steadily growing global
population]{.underline}. In this scenario, the European Union has
assumed a leadership role, developing ambitious tools such as the
European Green Deal and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2023--2027,
which aims to integrate environmental sustainability with economic
productivity. These instruments not only seek to transform agricultural
and production systems but also represent an attempt to redefine the
fundamental principles of capitalism in a more sustainable direction
However, the implementation of such models raises complex questions,
particularly regarding their potential adaptability on a global scale.
[Economic and technological inequalities, cultural barriers, political
resistance, and the need to tailor strategies]{.underline} to local
specificities are just some of the challenges to be addressed. This
article explores these issues and offers a reflection on how to
construct a "green capitalism" model, drawing on lessons from history
and contemporary dynamics. Building on the contributions of authors such
as Jared Diamond and Carlo Cipolla, the analysis examines parallels
between the collapse of past civilizations and current threats, aiming
to understand how historical mistakes and solutions can guide the
development of more resilient strategies. Furthermore, recent European
legislative and policy innovations are analyzed, highlighting the
potential of the CAP and the Green Deal to strike a balance between food
security and environmental sustainability. The recent literature
(2022--2024) provides additional insights, delving into topics such as
decoupled payments, enhanced conditionality, and eco-schemes, suggesting
more flexible and inclusive approaches to managing natural resources and
production systems. [Ultimately, this work seeks to outline [a path
toward]{.mark} a more equitable and [sustainable future]{.mark}, where
public [policies]{.mark}, [tech]{.mark}nological [innovations]{.mark},
[and cultural]{.mark} transformations converge to [ensure]{.mark} the
well-being of present and [future gen]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}.
Achieving this goal requires not only a shift in mindset but also an
integrated vision]{.underline} that combines economic growth with
respect for planetary boundaries, thereby defining the contours of a new
paradigm for global development. [The [environ]{.mark}mental
[challenges]{.mark} the [planet]{.mark} [faces today]{.mark} are [not
new in the history]{.mark} of humanity.]{.underline} Although human
impact on the environment has reached unprecedented proportions, [the
issues manifesting today are, in many cases, [evolutions of
threats]{.mark} that shaped the fate [of ancient
civilizations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[\<\<\<text condensed none omitted\>\>]{.underline}

[Comparing the past and the present is not merely a historical exercise
but an opportunity to understand how past mistakes and solutions can
provide valuable lessons for addressing the future.]{.underline} In this
context, Jared Diamond and Carlo Cipolla offer complementary
perspectives. Diamond analyzes the environmental causes that led to the
collapse of civilizations, while Cipolla identifies the economic and
social transformations that have shaped modernity. Both, albeit from
different angles, invite us to reflect on how major changes---whether
destructive or transformative---affect the relationship between humanity
and the environment. From this historical analysis, insights emerge for
building a sustainable future, where the economy and the environment can
coexist in balance. According to Jared Diamond, "the environmental
problems we face today are the same eight dangers that threatened
societies in the past, with the addition of four others: climate changes
caused by human intervention, accumulation of toxic chemicals in the
environment, scarcity of energy resources, and depletion of the Earth's
photosynthetic capacity." [He argues that, in the past, the causes of
the extinction of ancient civilizations were rooted in specific factors:
deforestation and habitat destruction, soil issues, water crises,
overhunting, introduction of invasive species, population growth, and
anthropogenic pressure on the environment.]{.underline} The author
highlights that, in addition to traditional threats, four new dangers
have emerged today, directly linked to human activities and global
transformations: human-induced climate change,2 the accumulation of
toxic substances in the environment,3 energy resource shortages, and the
depletion of the Earth's photosynthetic capacity. Diamond urges us to
reflect on the fact that we are facing challenges similar to those that
led to the collapse of past societies but, on a much larger scale,
exacerbated by global interconnectedness. Humanity has the
responsibility to choose between two paths: adopting a sustainable
approach based on reducing environmental impact and fostering global
cooperation4 or continuing along the path of unsustainability, risking a
collapse that, this time, could involve the entire planet.5 A concrete
example that demonstrates how historical environmental problems remain
relevant, often as the root of modern ones, is deforestation With this
brief anthropological premise, it is possible to outline another
historicalsocial reflection based on the thought of Carlo Cipolla, one
of the greatest historians of the Italian economy. In one of his essays,
Cipolla identifies three fundamental transformations that marked the
development of Western Europe between the tenth and ninteenth centuries7
: The Communal Revolution (tenth--thirteenth centuries): With the
emergence and establishment of communes, especially in Italy, new forms
of political and economic organization were introduced, fostering urban
and commercial development. The Scientific Revolution
(sixteenth--seventeenth centuries): Marked by a profound transformation
in thought and knowledge, the scientific method emerged, and discoveries
were made that revolutionized the worldview and technology. The
Industrial Revolution (eighteenth century): Introduced the widespread
use of machines and new technologies in production, radically
transforming the economy, society, and labor structures.8 Following a
thread similar to that outlined by Diamond, these three historical
revolutions can be correlated to the transitions necessary for building
a contemporary sustainable economy The reason this work begins by
highlighting analogies between the past and the present is to emphasize
that fundamental lessons can be drawn from history. As Cicero wrote:
"Historia vero testis temporum, lux veritatis, vita memoriae, magistra
vitae, nuntia vetustatis." 12 Building on these premises, we will
analyze the economic and legal scenarios related to agriculture,
focusing on coupled13 and decoupled14 production subsidies in Italy and
Europe. Additionally, we will examine the relationship between
agricultural production aimed at food security and that oriented toward
environmental sustainability. In the case of humans, a species not
subject to predation, the sustainability of its evolution has been
influenced by the use and abuse of industrial technologies and the
intensive exploitation of natural resources. The critical question is
how to reconcile sustainable15 development while simultaneously ensuring
certain quantitative standards. There is no universal formula for
implementing green growth strategies. The transition to a greener
economy depends on the policies adopted, the institutional framework,
the level of development, resource endowments, and specific
environmental challenges. Advanced, emerging, and developing countries
face different challenges and can seize distinct opportunities; the same
applies to countries with diverse economies and political circumstances.
According to a renowned author,16 it is necessary to abandon the model
of a society based solely on growth---a society consumed by an economy
whose sole objective is growth for the sake of growth. This logic does
not aim to increase production to meet needs but rather to perpetuate
infinite growth, justified by the idea of limitless consumption, leading
to consequences such as the senseless increase of waste and pollution.17
Essentially, it is a model that leads to the destruction of the planet
\[ For scholars advocating18 for a degrowth society, the main points of
contention with the so-called unlimited growth society (or growth at all
costs) are as follows: • GDP problem: These authors criticize the idea
that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is an indicator of well-being, arguing
that it fails to account for environmental and social damages. •
Planetary limits: They highlight how an economy based on unlimited
growth is incompatible with the planet's finite resources and
contributes to ecological and climate crises. • Degrowth is not
recession: Degrowth is not a forced economic contraction but a radical
rethinking of economic and social priorities (Table 1). In this context,
the European Union's 2023--2027 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
introduces reforms that can be linked to the principles of the degrowth
society. The latter emphasizes environmental sustainability, reduced
consumption, and the promotion of local economies. The decoupled
payments of the CAP and the principles of the degrowth society can be
connected by analyzing how these tools influence agricultural models and
sustainability. Decoupled payments, introduced with the 2003 Fischler
reform19 and consolidated in subsequent reforms, aim to support farmers'
incomes without linking them to production levels, thereby separating
public support from agricultural output. The CAP reforms in the
twenty-first century have significantly reduced the EU's intervention in
markets, shifting the focus from production-oriented support---such as
coupled payments---to environmental goals. This trend has led the CAP to
formulate a series of programs aimed at sustainability, such as greening
and biodiversity promotion, giving member states considerable discretion
in implementing the most relevant initiatives.20 The communication of
November 11, 2019, known as the European Green Deal, aims to lead Europe
to "climate neutrality21 " by 2050. This program, combined with the need
to preserve and promote biodiversity, represents an almost complete
reversal in the way agriculture is conceived. From its origins to the
present day, agriculture has contributed to massive deforestation,
removing tree species that capture and store large amounts of CO₂ and
selecting more productive plant and animal species while discarding or
eliminating other varieties \[9\]. The agri-food system, as a whole, is
an ideal field for applying the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
outlined in the 2030 Agenda. In this context, the European Union plays a
leading role, setting new sustainability targets integrated into the
European strategic framework and the priorities of the European
Commission \[10\]. In the European Commission's communication "The
Sustainable Future of Europe: Next Steps. European Action for
Sustainability" of November 22, 2016, it is reiterated that "sustainable
development has long been at the heart of the European agenda." This
underscores how sustainability is a deeply rooted theme in the EU's
strategy, now more critical than ever for addressing contemporary global
challenges. The application of the European Green Deal to the rest of
the world, on the other hand, presents significant opportunities but
also complex challenges. On one side, the Green Deal can serve as a
model to promote a global ecological transition, encouraging
decarbonization, sustainable agriculture, circular economy practices,
and biodiversity protection. However, its implementation on a global
scale faces obstacles related to economic, technological, and political
inequalities among countries. While developed nations can sustain
substantial investments in clean energy and innovation, many developing
countries are still struggling to meet basic needs, making it
challenging for them to adopt high environmental standards. Moreover,
the lack of a uniform international regulatory framework and the risk of
7 Some policy recommendations 2.7.1 Strengthen the link between the CAP
and the green deal for an inclusive ecological transition It is
recommended to consolidate the principles of the European Green Deal
within CAP policies by further encouraging regenerative agricultural
practices and biodiversity conservation. This can be achieved through
targeted funding mechanisms, such as incentives for organic farming and
agroforestry systems, and awareness campaigns to guide consumer choices
toward sustainable products. "carbon leakage" further complicate the
dissemination of these policies.22 To address such issues, it is crucial
to develop mechanisms for international cooperation, such as climate
financing, technology transfer, and capacity-building programs, to
ensure that the green transition is fair and inclusive on a global scale
(Figure 3).23 The European Union should intensify efforts to transfer
green technologies and foster partnerships with developing countries.
Establishing an international regulatory framework that includes
financial incentives and tools for emissions management could ensure a
fair green transition, overcoming the risk of "carbon leakage" and
addressing global economic disparities. 2.7.3 Support the resilience of
local economies to reduce dependence on imports Policies aimed at
strengthening local agricultural economies should be implemented,
promoting short supply chains and encouraging food self-sufficiency.
This approach contributes to decarbonization, reduces risks related to
global crises, and enhances the cultural and environmental heritage of
rural European regions (Figure 4). The comparison between today's
environmental challenges and those faced by past civilizations
highlights the need to learn from historical dynamics to avoid repeating
mistakes that could lead to a global collapse. Jared Diamond's
reflections emphasize that environmental problems are often evolutions
of ancient threats, now amplified by a globally interconnected and
technologically advanced context. Similarly, Carlo Cipolla's perspective
invites us to consider how major historical transformations, such as the
communal, scientific, and industrial revolutions, can offer useful
analogies for shaping a more sustainable contemporary development model.
Sustainability emerges as the cornerstone of a possible balance between
economy and environment---a choice humanity must pursue through
innovative and collaborative approaches. The Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) and the European Green Deal represent concrete steps toward more
environmentally friendly agriculture, aligning with the principles of
degrowth, which opposes the paradigm of unlimited growth. However, to
ensure an effective transition, it is crucial that European policies are
accompanied by a cultural and social shift that prioritizes waste
reduction, the promotion of local economies, and the protection of
biodiversity. Ultimately, history teaches us that change is inevitable,
but its direction depends on collective choices. A sustainable
development model requires not only technological innovations but also a
profound shift in mindset, one capable of integrating lessons from the
past with the needs of the present and the opportunities of the future.
This path, though complex, represents the only way to reconcile human
well-being with the respect for planetary boundaries. 3. The CAP
2023--2027: A balance between food security and environmental
sustainability 3.1 Introduction: Complexity and contradictions of the
CAP 2023--2027 Today's legislator operates in an extremely complex and
contradictory context. On the one hand, they are tasked with protecting
agricultural production to ensure food security, particularly in light
of unforeseen and significant events, the so-called black swans24 (e.g.,
the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing conflicts). On the other hand, they
must address the numerous challenges associated with environmental
protection in the face of profound climate changes, which many argue,
are closely linked to humanity's impact on the planet. 3.2 The European
green deal and the agricultural sector In this context, the European
Union has adopted a series of strategies, including the European Green
Deal, aimed at redefining the production and consumption model by
promoting sustainability across all economic sectors. The agricultural
sector, in particular, plays a crucial role in this transformation, both
for its contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and its
potential for sustainable land management. The Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP) 2023--2027 serves as a key tool for addressing these
challenges by integrating objectives related to food security,
environmental protection, and strengthening the socioeconomic fabric of
rural areas. Within the strategic framework of the European Green Deal
are the communications from the European Commission and the European
Parliament to the Council on May 20, 2020, which introduce important
strategies for the agricultural sector. These include initiatives such
as "From Farm to Fork: for a Fair, Healthy and EnvironmentallyFriendly
Food System" and "Biodiversity Strategy for 2030: Bringing Nature Back
into Our Lives." 25 The ambitious goals of these strategies aim to
enhance environmental sustainability across all productive sectors while
intensifying efforts to combat climate change. In this perspective, the
agricultural sector is also deeply involved, as it is simultaneously a
risk factor for greenhouse gas emissions and a vital resource for land
conservation, preventing depopulation of rural areas, and mitigating
hydrogeological risks \[11\]. 3.3 The CAP 2023--2027: Legislation and
subsidiarity The proposals for the CAP 2023--2027 date back to a period
prior to the adoption of the Green Deal, yet they address similar
issues, particularly the complex relationship between agriculture and
environmental26 protection. The new European legislation is structured
around three main regulations: • Regulation (EU) 2021/2015, which sets
out rules on support for the strategic plans that Member States must
draft under the CAP, financed by the EAFRD (European Agricultural Fund
for Rural Development) and the EAGF (European Agricultural Guarantee
Fund)27 ; • Regulation (EU) 2021/2116, concerning the financing,
management, and monitoring of the CAP28 ; • Regulation (EU) 2021/2117,
which amends, among other things, the regulation on CMOs (Common Market
Organizations) (Regulation 1308/2013) and the regulation on quality
products (Regulation 1151/2012) In compliance with the principle of
subsidiarity, the CAP delegates the development of national strategic
plans to member states, which establish the framework fo measures to be
implemented at the national level.29 Specifically, the principle of
horizontal30 subsidiarity promotes the direct involvement of citizens,
associations, and local communities in managing public functions,
ensuring that decision-making power is exercised as closely as possible
to the citizens \[12\]. In the current legal framework of the European
Union, subsidiarity has taken on a central role in defining competences
and the functioning of the EU's multi-level governance system.31 The
future prospects for the principle of subsidiarity, which regulates the
relationship between state systems and the EU, include strengthening
democratic participation, enhancing social cohesion, and monitoring and
adapting the regulatory framework to ensure its uniform and effective
application. In this context, subsidiarity32 proves to be a fundamental
principle for addressing the EU's current challenges, such as the
environmental crisis and ecological transition,33 crisis management,34
social policy and welfare,35 agricultural policy and territorial
cohesion,36 as well as digitalization and participatory governance37 .
artially in conflict with point (b). For example, some environmental
protection measures, such as reducing emissions from agricultural
machinery or more moderate use of herbicides and pesticides, could
decrease crop productivity, favoring environmental sustainability
objectives.39 Conversely, points (a) and (c) can be considered
complementary, reflecting the long-standing debate between productivity
and social development.40 3.5 CAP interventions and conditionality Title
III of the regulation represents the most relevant section. It governs:
• Direct payments, both decoupled and coupled (Articles 16--41); •
Interventions for certain specific products (Articles 42--68); •
Second-pillar interventions (Articles 69--84). Among the provisions
common to all types of intervention, those regulating conditionality
stand out. This principle establishes that, to access the system of EU
payments, farmers must comply with rules related to proper agronomic
management of land, environmental protection, public health, and animal
welfare, with penalties applied in cases of non-compliance.41
Conditionality, in effect since 2005, is a cornerstone of the Common
Agricultural Policy (CAP), making most payments contingent on adherence
to regulations concerning the environment, health, and animal welfare.
However, it has compl In Regulation 2021/2115, "conditionality" has been
reformulated as "enhanced conditionality." 44 This incorporates rules
for maintaining land in good condition as well as commitments that,
under the previous Regulation 1307/2013, were included in greening.45
Additionally, the regulation places greater emphasis on environmental
aspects by introducing the so-called eco-schemes: a set of commitments
required to obtain a specific payment related to climate, environment,
and animal welfare.46 The introduction of enhanced conditionality and
the so-called eco-schemes highlights the growing importance attributed
to environmental sustainability in the agricultural sector. However, a
prominent economist argued in an essay \[15\] published a few years ago
that conditionality measures do not account for the specificities of
individual countries and may undermine long-term economic growth. He
advocates for a more flexible approach that is sensitive to local needs,
promoting sustainable development without imposing rigid external
conditions. In his essay Rewriting the European Economy \[16\], Joseph
Stiglitz proposes an alternative model for the economic management of
Europe, moving away from rigid austerity policies and external
impositions. Among other things, he promotes flexibility in sustainable
development47 and attention to local needs.48 Similarly, Amartya Sen,
Indian philosopher and economist, in his essay Development as Freedom,
emphasizes the importance of a flexible approach to sustainable
development, tailored to local specificities rather than imposed through
rigid and uniform criteria \[17\]. Sen highlights how communities must
have the power to decide how to manage resources and environmental
challenges in a way that is most suitable for their reality. 3.7
Conclusion: Challenges and opportunities The Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) 2023--2027 represents an ambitious and complex attempt to
reconcile two seemingly conflicting needs: food security and
environmental sustainability. In a global context marked by
unprecedented challenges, such as climate change, health crises, and
geopolitical tensions, the CAP aims to provide a regulatory framework
that integrates economic, social, and environmental objectives. The
introduction of enhanced conditionality and eco-schemes highlights the
growing priority given to environmental protection in the agricultural
sector. However, the challenges pointed out by the European Court of
Auditors, such as unclear objectives, complex regulations, and
insufficient controls, cast doubt on the effectiveness of the
implemented measures. These obstacles risk undermining the delicate
balance between agricultural productivity and environmental protection.
The theoretical debate, enriched by the contributions of economists like
Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, suggests the need for a more flexible
approach that is adaptable to local specificities. Both emphasize the
importance of avoiding rigid and uniform policies, instead promoting the
participation of local communities in the management of resources and
environmental challenges. This approach would not only foster
sustainable development but also ensure greater equity and inclusiveness
in agricultural policies. Ultimately, the CAP 2023--2027, while
providing a solid foundation to address current challenges, requires
further interventions to ensure alignment between objectives and
implementation. It is crucial that lawmakers and European institutions
work to simplify the regulatory framework, strengthen control systems,
and encourage policies that account for local diversity. Only through an
integrated vision and effective implementation will it be possible to
build a sustainable agriculture that meets the needs of the global
population without compromising the

4\. The CAP between sustainability and food security: Toward sustainable
capitalism [4.1 Introduction: The CAP as a tool for [sustainable
capitalism]{.mark} The new framework of the Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) aims to **[provide]{.mark}** forms of payment not linked to the
**[agricultural production]{.mark} [directly achieved by individual
farmers]{.mark}**, limiting coupled payments to marginal cases compared
to decoupled payments. [Farmers are entitled to receive a series of
payments]{.mark} (previously a single payment under Regulation
1782/200349) solely for owning agricultural land [suitable for grazing,
cultivation]{.mark}]{.underline}, or for performing a minimum activity
defined by the member state, even in the absence of direct productive
activity.50 4.2 Decoupled payments and food security In this context,
the irrelevance of production choices for accessing subsidies represents
a tool to steer the entrepreneurial activities of European farmers
toward the market, without having crop decisions primarily depend on the
European Union's production support mechanisms. Basing subsidies on
non-productive variables, but linked to environmental conditions, the
so-called "green conditions," seemingly impacts, as we will see, the
actual productivity of European crops, with visible effects in the long
term. This raises questions about how to reconcile the issue of food
security, included in the 2030 Agenda51 as a key element for
sustainability, with the green logic that inspires the Green Deal and
the CAP 2023--2027. 4.3 Environmental targets of the CAP and challenges
in the agricultural sector Agriculture, the first food production
activity analyzed, raises environmental and climate concerns, especially
when conducted intensively.52 To address these issues, several targets
have been set to be achieved by 203053 (non-legally binding): 4.5 The
green new deal and sustainable [**[capitalism]{.mark}** The approach of
Article 210-bis is part of a set of regulatory changes aimed at
**[promoting a sustainable econ]{.mark}**omy in the European Union,
altering in certain respects some of the [logic of modern
cap]{.mark}italist [development]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to
some,59 the climate emergency can only be addressed through a "Green New
Deal." This plan envisions a future based on ecological transition, with
sacrifices in consumption and improvements in quality of life, such as
accessible transportation, reduced inequalities, and decreased urban
pollution \[19\]. Just as Keynes,60 in his time, proposed state
intervention to counterbalance the imbalances and crises of the economic
system \[20\] today, there is a need for a similar approach, but with a
sustainable focus.61 Therefore, Article 210-bis does not conflict with
the development of a "healthy62 " capitalism, but rather redefines its
logic to [**[protect sustainable capitalism]{.mark}**. In this
perspective, business aggregations can be effective tools not so much
for increasing production, but for enhancing its sustainability, in a
context where production must [comply with **environmental
protection**]{.mark} constraints. The Green Deal strategy indeed
includes non-binding targets to be achieved by 2030 to improve the
sustainability of agriculture**, [including the following]{.mark}**: •
**[Reducing]{.mark}** overall sales of **[antimicrobials]{.mark}** used
[in livestock]{.mark} and aquaculture. • Reducing the overall use of
[chemical pesticides]{.mark} and the most hazardous ones, as well as the
associated risks. • Reducing [nutrient losses]{.mark} due to the use of
fertilizers. • [Increasing]{.mark} the area dedicated to [organic
farming]{.mark}. • Expanding areas dedicated to landscape elements with
high biodiversity.63 4.6 Food security and sustainability: A possible
coexistence The complexities of reconciling [food security and
sustainability]{.mark} can be addressed [through]{.mark} changes to the
structure of [cap]{.mark}italism and the rules that [have characterized
it]{.mark}]{.underline} 4.7 Sustainable development and the
transformation of capitalism The introduction of Article 210-bis in
Regulation (EU) 1308/2013 is emblematic of this transformation, allowing
sustainability agreements among economic operators that bypass
traditional competition restrictions. This tool not only promotes
sustainable practices but also redefines some of the foundations of
European capitalism, adapting them to the needs of an ecologically
responsible economy. In a context inspired by the Green New Deal, the
focus shifts from increasing production to the sustainability of
production itself, ensuring higher environmental standards and fostering
resilient agriculture. Challenges related to the relationship between
food security and sustainability require a rethinking of economic rules
and legislative support. Conditionality and incentives for sustainable
practices demonstrate that food security is no longer just a 4.8
Conclusions: The CAP as a model for sustainable development Ultimately,
the path outlined by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), with the
integration of legislative tools such as Article 210-bis, shapes a
vision of sustainable capitalism that, though complex, offers a concrete
pathway to reconcile environmental, economic, and social objectives.
However, its effectiveness will depend on the ability of Member States
and operators to implement these regulations consistently and
integratively, thereby ensuring the long-term sustainability of the
European agricultural system. 5. Sustainable development and modern
capitalism: A balance between food security, green logics, and economic
competitiveness 5.1 Introduction: The challenge of sustainable
development in modern capitalism The question we ask, in conclusion to
the previous reflections, is whether sustainable development, within the
framework of green logics, can truly reconcile with economic development
as it has been conceived up to the latest revolution of modern
capitalism. Furthermore, how food law can address the challenge of
balancing, on the one hand, food security, and on the other hand, the
sustainability of the planet's natural ecosystems. 5.2 Obstacles and
opportunities of sustainable development When considering on a
macroscopic scale, some contradictions related to the theme of
sustainable development immediately emerge as follows: • The difficulty
of achieving a balance between economic growth and environmental
protection. • Diverging interests among different stakeholders, such as
businesses, governments, and local communities. • Issues related to
financing sustainable initiatives. • Lack of awareness, ethics, and
political will. • The disproportionate impact of environmental and
social challenges on the most vulnerable groups, which exacerbates
existing inequalities. 5.3 Examples of sustainability integration into
capitalism Considering these challenges, it can be stated that only
through a collective effort will it be possible to build a sustainable
future for all. However, one positive aspect, 21 [Toward a [Green
Capitalism]{.mark}:]{.underline} Balancing Sustainability and Food
Security DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.1008683 from a
macroscopic perspective, concerns the ability of the competitive logics
of "classical67 [" capitalism to [integrate sustainability-related
elements]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example: • Labeling of sustainable
foods has gained significant competitive value, with a notable price
mark-up starting in 2024.68 • [[Financial institutions]{.mark} are
increasingly [valuing companies]{.mark} that [improve their
environmental performance]{.mark}, as evidenced by the focus [on]{.mark}
the]{.underline} three scopes of **[[CO2
emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Scope 1, 2, and 3).69 • Sustainability
reports are becoming central as tools for communicating value to
business stakeholders.70 These elements suggest that sustainable
development is finding its realization within the very logics of the
traditional economic system, using the means offered by capitalism to
promote a sustainable transition. 5.4 Stakeholder capitalism according
to Stiglitz Stiglitz proposes an economic system that takes into account
the interests of all stakeholders involved in the production process
(the so-called stakeholder capitalism): workers, local communities,
consumers, suppliers, the environment, and society at large. He
specifically proposes the following points: • Overcoming profit as the
sole objective: The stakeholder [[capitalism model]{.mark} requires
companies to [consider]{.mark} their social and [environmental
impact]{.mark}, in [addition to financial returns]{.mark}. • Centrality
of public policies: [Governments]{.mark} must create a regulatory
framework that incentivizes responsible business behavior, discourages
short-term thinking, and **[rewards sustainability]{.mark}**. •
[Redistribution of economic benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}: Stiglitz
argues that the value produced by companies should be distributed
fairly, avoiding a disproportionate share of profits going to
shareholders and executives.

[The [climate threat is]{.mark} certainly [dire]{.mark}]{.underline},
and carbon taxes are unlikely to be enough to solve the problem. [[But
**eco-socialism** is]{.mark} probably [not]{.mark} going to be [an
**effective method** of addressing that threat.]{.mark} [Dismantling
an]{.mark} **entire [economic system]{.mark}** is never easy, and
probably [would touch off **armed conflict** and **major

**[abandon]{.mark} their [limitation]{.mark}** [on fossil-fuel

to]{.mark} **profound [environmental degradation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The world\'s climate does not have several decades to spare.

[[Even without]{.mark} international [conflict]{.mark}, [there's little
guarantee]{.mark} that [moving away]{.mark} from capitalism [would

leader]{.mark} Evo [Morales]{.mark}]{.underline} took power in Bolivia,
living standards have improved substantially for the average Bolivian,
which is great. But this has come at the **[[cost]{.mark} of [higher
emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S managed
to decrease its per capita emissions a bit during this same period
(though since the U.S. is a rich country, its absolute level of
emissions is much higher).

In other words, in terms of economic growth and carbon emissions,
Bolivia looks similar to more capitalist developing countries. That
suggests that [[faced with a choice of **enriching their people** or
helping to **save the climate**]{.mark}, even **[socialist]{.mark}**

environmental goals [will have **trouble staying in

### AT: Degrowth

#### Transitioning to eco-socialism would require an [impossible]{.underline} level of [global]{.underline} economic planning. 

Noah **Smith 21**. PhD in Economics from University of Michigan. "People
are realizing that degrowth is bad."
<https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/people-are-realizing-that-degrowth>.

So even if there is a sustainable growth path, we are not currently on
it. About this, degrowthers are right; a gentle, natural transition to
green growth is possible, but is an unaffordable luxury. But
**[[degrowthers' prescription is]{.mark} the [wrong]{.mark}
one.]{.underline}** [The reason, in a word, is
**politics**]{.underline}. [The kind of massive intention reordering of
global production and consumption that degrowthers fantasize about is
not just pragmatically impossible to implement]{.underline}, [it's the
kind of thing that essentially everyone in the world except for a few
very shouty people in Northern Europe and the occasional Twitter
activist is going to reject]{.underline}. To see why, let us turn to the
excellent articles/podcasts by Milanovic, Piper, and Klein. The
political argument against degrowth Milanovic actually has two excellent
posts on the topic of degrowth. In the first one, he lays out why
forcing developing countries to stay in poverty would be bad: Let us
suppose, for the sake of the argument, that we interpret "degrowth" as
the decision to fix global GDP at its current level...Then, unless we
change the distribution of income, [we are condemning to permanent
abject poverty some 15 percent of world population that currently earn
less than \$1.90 per day and some quarter of humankind who earn less
than \$2.50 per day...Keeping so many people in abject poverty so that
the rich can continue to enjoy their current standard of living is
obviously something that the proponents of degrowth would not condone.
Enforcing global degrowth would [require freezing]{.mark} [world
income]{.mark} at about \$17,000/year]{.underline}. That means that
[most people in the world would never even come close to current
rich-world living standards]{.underline} --- instead, [they would at
best only be able to reach the level currently enjoyed in China or
Botswana]{.underline}. Perhaps that's not such a horrible fate, but as
Milanovic notes, **[this would require [impoverishing]{.mark} most of
the [population of developed countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He
elaborates on this point in his new post, pulling no punches: \[In order
to avoid keeping most of the world in poverty, degrowthers must\]
introduce a different \[income\] distribution (B) where everybody who is
above the current mean world income (\$PPP 16 per day) is driven down to
this mean, and the poor countries and people are, at least for a while,
allowed to continue growing until they too achieve the level of \$PPP 16
per day. But the problem with that approach is that [one would have to
engage in a massive reduction of incomes for...practically all of the
Western population. Only 14% of the population in Western countries live
at the level of income less than the global
mean]{.underline}...**[[Degrowers]{.mark} thus [need to convince]{.mark}
[86% of]{.mark} the population living in [rich countries that their
incomes are too high]{.mark} and need to be
reduced]{.underline}**....[It is quite obvious that such a proposition
is a political suicide]{.underline}. Milanovic quite rightly waves away
degrowthers' protestations that GDP is not a good measure of human
welfare. GDP isn't perfect, he notes, but it's close enough where the
basic point stands. [Demanding that people in rich countries accept
absolutely catastrophic declines in their living standards is
a]{.underline} **[[political non-starter]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Klein,
on his podcast, tries to point this out as gently as possible: I think
that if the political demand of the \[degrowth\] movement becomes you
don't get to eat beef, you will set climate politics back so far, so
fast, it would be disastrous. Same thing with S.U.V.s. I don't like
S.U.V.s. I don't drive one. [But if you are telling people in rich
countries that the climate movement is for them not having the cars they
want to have, you are just going to lose]{.underline}. **[You are going
to lose fast]{.underline}**...This is where the politics of \[degrowth\]
for me fall apart... [I just don't see the argument for degrowth as
being anything but an extraordinarily slower way of approaching the
politics]{.underline}, [probably counterproductive compared to what
we're doing, which is]{.underline} **[I think you can make tremendous
strides on climate change by deploying renewable energy
technologies]{.underline}** and [giving people the opportunity to have a
more materially fulfilling life atop those technologies.]{.underline}
Milanovic is less gentle, calling [this "outright magical
thinking"]{.underline}. He is correct. [When you look at how much people
in America are willing to sacrifice in terms of their material
well-being in order to fight climate change, it's far less than what
Klein is talking about]{.underline}. And Klein is really softballing it
here --- [it's not just [giving up beef]{.mark} and [SUVs]{.mark}, it's
a [dramatic reduction in]{.mark} the size of [housing]{.mark} and the
amount of [food]{.mark} and the ease of [transportation]{.mark} and the
quality of [medical care]{.mark} that people in rich countries
enjoy.]{.underline} **[[It is]{.mark}, frankly, [not
happening.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But even this vastly understates the
political and practical difficulties of degrowth. Piper adds several key
points. First of all, she notes, because developed countries have been
decoupling resource use and growth for a while now, [curbing resource
use will actually cause a lot more restrictions on developing countries
than Milanovic's simple calculations would suggest]{.underline}: From a
climate change perspective, though, there's a problem \[with simply
reducing rich-world living standards\]. First, it means that
**[[degrowth would do nothing about]{.mark} the bulk of
[emissions]{.mark}, which are occurring in developing
countries.]{.underline}** This is an incredibly important point. For
example, [[China]{.mark} now [produces more]{.mark} CO2 emissions than
the U.S., the EU, and Japan combined]{.underline}: [(And no, this is not
because of outsourcing]{.underline}, as you can see by looking at the
trade-adjusted emissions numbers.) Another way of looking at this is
that [China's CO2 emissions per dollar of GDP are more than twice
America's, and about five times that of the EU]{.underline}. Any global
[degrowth]{.underline} plan that actually reduces resource use [is going
to entail more pain for China than its GDP numbers would
suggest]{.underline}, simply because China is at a more
resource-intensive stage of growth. [[Do you think China]{.mark} [will
accept]{.mark} a substantial diminution of its living standards, in
order to satisfy the environmental-economic [diktats of activists
in]{.mark} Northern [Europe]{.mark}?]{.underline} If so, **[you need to
rethink a great many things]{.underline}**. Anyway, Piper makes a second
crucially important point. So far we've been waving our hands and
talking about lowering rich-world GDP while raising GDP for poor
countries. In fact, economies don't work like that: Second, the global
economy is more interconnected than Hickel implies. When Covid-19 hit,
poor countries were devastated not just by the virus but by the
aftershocks of virus-induced slowdowns in consumption in rich countries.
There's some genuine appeal to the idea of an end to "consumerism," but
the pandemic offered a taste of how a sudden drop in rich-world
consumption would actually affect the developing world. Covid-19
dramatically curtailed Western imports and tourism for a time. [The
consequences in poor countries were devastating. Hunger rose, and child
mortality followed. Degrowth would thus require deep changes in the
entire way that the global economy works]{.underline}. Change happens,
but not like that; implementing [the kind of reallocation schemes that
[degrowthers]{.mark} throw around with abandon would [require **global
economic planning**]{.mark} that would put Gosplan to
shame]{.underline}. Klein points this out, again rather gently: Degrowth
is, as its advocates understand it, a act of global economic planning
really without equal anywhere in human history. It is an act of
extraordinary central planning. In other words, **[[it is abject
fantasy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Taken together, **[these criticisms are
utterly devastating to the entire degrowth project]{.underline}**. In
its current form, [it will not advance beyond a media fad]{.underline}.
No matter how shrilly degrowthers quote apocalyptic projections, **[the
things they call for simply will not happen]{.underline}**. Luckily,
there is a better way to save the planet. And there is a better role for
the degrowth movement, if they're willing to rethink their approach and
become more fact-based, reasonable, and humble. A better direction for
Earth, a better direction for the degrowth movement [Degrowth is a
**non-starter**]{.underline}, and green growth won't happen fast enough
on its own. Thus, [the world has only one viable option]{.underline}:
**[Forced green growth.]{.underline}** Government policy will have to
accelerate the transition to green energy and dematerialized GDP faster
than these transitions would otherwise take place. For climate, this
will involve things like: A forced rapid transition to green electricity
Forced rapid electrification of most energy use The forced rapid
adoption of low-emissions heat for industrial processes Forced
restriction of deforestation ...and so on.
