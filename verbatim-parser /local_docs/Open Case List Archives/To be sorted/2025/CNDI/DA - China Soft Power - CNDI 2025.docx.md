#### China is gaining arctic influence through the building of the Polar Silk Road.

[AS [CHINA]{.mark} has [grown]{.mark} in [economic]{.mark} might [and
geopolitical heft]{.mark}, it, too, has **[begun testing]{.mark} its
[prospects]{.mark} [in the Arctic]{.mark}**. It has **[declared
itself]{.mark}** a [near-Arctic state]{.mark}]{.underline}---a
designation of its own invention---and since 2013 has been an observer
at the Arctic Council. [China is [exploring]{.mark} the [expansion
of]{.mark} its [naval and]{.mark} [commercial reach]{.mark} by
[investing]{.mark} in its [own **fleet of icebreakers**]{.mark}, and it
is [testing]{.mark} out the [prospect of]{.mark} itself **[taking
advantage of new pathways through]{.mark}** the [ice]{.mark}---through
North America, across the top of Russia, or even via the North
Pole.]{.underline} So what is the extent of China's interest in the
Arctic? Given that the country is neither adjacent to nor possessed of a
long history of involvement in the region, what is its motivation? The
answer to the second question is both complex and straightforward[: it
is at once neither **geopolitical**, **commercial**, nor **military**,
and yet simultaneously all of these: an important component of
[China's]{.mark} [progression toward]{.mark} genuine **[superpower
status]{.mark}**, a [forward-looking approach]{.mark} to the
[challenges]{.mark} and [opportunities]{.mark} [presented by]{.mark} a
[changing Arctic]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} a move to secure a prominent seat
at the table to [influence and benefit]{.mark} from [decisions]{.mark}
that [inevitably]{.mark} will be [made]{.mark} in response to those
Arctic changes.]{.underline} In 2021, China's National People's Congress
formally adopted its latest Five-Year Plan, the fourteenth in total and
the first to mention the Arctic. That mention was
blink-and-you'll-miss-it brief, but what it chose to include could
reasonably be inferred to [highlight [Beijing's priority]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the northern [polar regions]{.mark}. China will, it read,
"[participate]{.mark} in practical [cooperation in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} and [build]{.mark} the '**[Polar Silk
Road]{.mark}**.'"]{.underline} That [China should be invested in the
idea of **shipping routes** through the Arctic to the point of wanting
to **develop infrastructure** to support those routes and even give the
concept some catchy branding should, on one level, be no
surprise.]{.underline} [China boasts, by at least one measure, the
**largest merchant fleet in the world**;]{.underline} by other measures,
it lies second behind Greece, but whatever metric one chooses---[be it
gross tonnage, deadweight, or number of vessels---its position on the
charts has been rising,]{.underline} and having overtaken Japan's fleet
in 2018, it is at the very least competitive in size with the Greeks and
increasing at a faster rate. In such circumstances, it would arguably be
a dereliction of duty not to read the tea leaves and take as many
necessary precautions as possible for a world in which shipping routes
through the Arctic are viable and competitive. The notion of a Polar
Silk Road, however, suggested something deeper and more substantive. But
exactly what it means and how much import Beijing assigns to it is
unclear. [The [Polar Silk Road]{.mark} was announced as a component of
China's Belt and Road Initiative, which has been [described as]{.mark}
"[one of]{.mark} the [**most ambitious** infrastructure projects ever
created]{.mark}."]{.underline} When it was announced in 2013, it was
[portrayed as a "vast collection of development and investment
initiatives . . . originally devised to link East Asia and Europe
through physical infrastructure," which in the decade since "has
**expanded** to Africa, Oceania, and Latin America, significantly
broadening China's economic and political influence."]{.underline}

#### Arctic multipolarity is a lie -- one country's increase in control decreases another's, proven by Russia.

//Sreekantan

[The [Arctic is Russia's resource base]{.mark} for the 21st century and
the Kremlin needs Chinese FDI and technological expertise to develop it.
But even more, Putin views the Arctic as a means to restore Russia's
great power status.]{.underline}\[ix\] To this end, Russian national
security policy seeks to revise the status quo in favor of "maintaining
strategic stability and mutually beneficial partnerships in a poly
centric world."\[x\] [In the Arctic, **[the U.S. has become
sidelined]{.mark}** in an increasingly important geopolitical region,
one in which it actually has a geographical stake with tangible national
interests and economic potential.]{.underline}

[[Sino-Russian ties]{.mark} could **[undermine the U.S]{.mark}.**
elsewhere across the globe, and in different ways. In a non-military
sense, for starters, use of the NSR when it becomes commercially viable
will circumvent US dominance in global trade,]{.underline} of which 90%
is facilitated by sea.\[xi\] Bilateral trade between Russia and China,
furthermore, reached \$84 billion in 2017 after growing 19% each year
over the past decade.\[xii\] Such interdependence strengthens not only
the economic positions of two of the US's strategic rivals, but their
standing in world affairs as well.

[The U[.S. would benefit from]{.mark} an [increased Arctic
presence]{.mark}. Modernizing US military assets in Alaska is a logical
first step given increased human presence in the region, just as Russia
has done in its own Arctic territory.]{.underline} Furthermore, the U.S.
should engage more actively in the Arctic Council. Although the Council
and other sub-regional institutions cannot fully remedy mutual distrust
between the U.S. and Russia, they do help to "\[smooth\] out the impact
of tensions \[elsewhere\] on Arctic cooperation...and to keep regional
players from reckless moves."\[xiii\] Moreover, if its mandate were
expanded to give the Council legislative power, the U.S. could leverage
that authority to manage the role of non-Arctic actors such as China and
others in the region.

Both of these recommendations are responsible and low-risk, highlighting
that [until the [U.S.]{.mark} starts to [take the Arctic
seriously]{.mark}, it [can]{.mark}not realistically hope to [balance
against Sino-Russian cooperation]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline}

#### Chinese decline paired with Xi's insecurity means that China's first move will be to invade Taiwan.

//Sreekantan

[[Insecurity]{.mark}, bordering on **paranoia**, [drives Xi]{.mark} to
ensure the loyalty of the PLA through permanent purges and
indoctrination.]{.underline} Xi has appointed or replaced all the top
leaders of the PLA, and has dictated that the PLA units devote between
20 and 40 percent of their time undergoing political and ideological
indoctrination, which includes glorification of Xi himself. "Political
power," as Mao asserted, "grows out of the barrel of a gun." Thus, Xi
spends whatever he thinks necessary to ensure that those who wield the
weapons are loyal and responsive to him personally.

One might reasonably conclude from all this effort at control that Xi
sees the principal purpose of the PLA as defending him and regime
against potential domestic opponents rather than winning wars against
foreign adversaries. After all, every hour of indoctrination is an hour
not training to fight. This interpretation would make sense if the
indoctrination requirements were applied only to the army, which would
be expected to play the main role in internal repression, as it did in
June 1989. However, these requirements apply across all forces. It is
not likely that the PLA Navy, Air Force or Rocket Force would be used
against protesters.

Therefore, it is likely that [Xi's [efforts to **dominate the
military**]{.mark} imply a desire to ensure his unlimited freedom to
deploy the PLA for warfighting]{.underline}, without having to consult
colleagues or worry about the military's loyalty. This means that [**Xi
alone can make decisions** about resorting---or not resorting---to
military force to achieve his ambitions]{.underline}, and he alone will
pay the political price for any negative outcomes of those decisions.

The most consequential of those decisions is whether to use force to
bring Taiwan under CCP rule, an explicit and central goal that has
eluded every leader of the CCP since Mao. Achieving that goal would
confer near mythic status on Xi. [The question of whether Xi would risk
using military force for that purpose is central to estimating the
probability of a shooting war between China and the U.S.. [China would
**prefer**]{.mark} **first of all [to absorb Taiwan]{.mark}** without
firing a shot, second, to use the PLA to conquer Taiwan while deterring
U.S. armed intervention, and third, to engage in direct combat against
U.S. forces only as a last resort.]{.underline}

Until China's economic deceleration, the probability of war was slim.
This was because Xi maintained a relatively long timeline for realizing
his ambitions, noting that PLA modernization would be completed by 2035.
This timeline was based on Xi's age, PLA needs, and the CCP's assumption
of China's inexorable rise in comparison to a declining U.S.. China's
economic and political strength would grow, and the U.S. would sink into
economic, political, and military irrelevance, leaving China free to act
in the Western Pacific without need to consider U.S. reactions. However,
that is not what is happening. Instead, China's economy under Xi has
stalled in the face of declining productivity, overproduction, weak
demand, deflation, massive debt, and a shrinking population of workers.

None of these problems are susceptible to a quick fix. Therefore, China
must contend with low levels of growth for the long term and a likely
economic decline relative to the U.S.. This turn of events has changed
the timeline for Xi. The more time that passes, the weaker China's
position becomes relative to the U.S.. Furthermore, [without economic
growth, [Xi must rely]{.mark} more heavily [on nationalism and foreign
threats]{.mark} as a basis for legitimacy. All of this will [incentivize
Xi to **act against Taiwan sooner**]{.mark} rather [than later]{.mark}.
Given that Xi now exerts uncontested control of the PLA, the
[pressure]{.mark} on him to use it [to realize]{.mark} his
[Taiwan]{.mark} ambition [will be immense]{.mark}. Therefore,
[U.S.]{.mark} and allied leaders [cannot presume they have ample
time]{.mark} to decide how they would respond and coordinate in the
increasingly likely event Xi does resort to the military
option.]{.underline}

#### War over Taiwan goes nuclear.

Michael T. **Klare 22**, The Nation's defense correspondent, professor

Control Association, 10/13/22, "Could the Fight Over Taiwan Trigger
Nuclear War?"

In the days that followed, [[China]{.mark} also [sent
nuclear-capable]{.mark} H-6 [heavy bombers across the median]{.mark}
line [in]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait, a previously respected
informal boundary between China and that island]{.underline}. Worse yet,
[[**state-owned media** displayed]{.mark} images of Dongfeng-17 (DF-17)
[hypersonic ballistic missiles]{.mark}, also believed [capable of
**carrying**]{.mark} **[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline},
being moved into positions off Taiwan.

[[Washington]{.mark} has not overtly deployed nuclear-capable
weaponry]{.underline} in such a brazen fashion near Chinese territory,
but it [certainly has [sent aircraft carriers and]{.mark}
guided-[missile warships]{.mark} into the area, [signaling]{.mark} its
[ability to launch attacks]{.mark} on the mainland should a war break
out]{.underline}. While Pelosi was in Taiwan, for example, the Navy
deployed the carrier USS Ronald Reagan with its flotilla of escort
vessels in nearby waters. [Military [officials in both countries
are]{.mark} all too [aware]{.mark} that [should]{.mark} such ships [ever
attack Chinese territory]{.mark}, those DF-15s and DF-17s would be let
loose against them---and, if armed with nuclear warheads,
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[provoke]{.mark} a US [nuclear
response]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### UQ/L- China Arctic Leadership 

#### China will fill the leadership gap created by US withdrawal, but US commitment to the arctic [crowds out]{.underline} Chinese soft power

**Karim 25**, Postdoctoral fellow at Yunnan Minzu University (Ejaz,
2-10-2025, "The Vacuum in Global Leadership in the Trump Era and
Opportunities for China"
https://www.wgi.world/the-vacuum-in-global-leadership-in-the-trump-era-and-opportunities-for-china/)
wtk

Since the Cold War, a profound transformation in global politics has
transpired during President [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration. His '[America First' policy]{.underline}, [characterized
by diplomatic withdrawal, economic protectionism, and skepticism towards
multilateralism]{.underline}, [eroded established alliances and
[diminished America's status as a global leader.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Under President Trump's administration, [[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is
prioritizing]{.mark} narrow [nationalism]{.mark} over international
cooperation]{.underline}, as evidenced by the withdrawal from the World
Health Organization (WHO), the Paris Climate Accord, and closure of
USAID, the United States Agency for International Development. On the
other hand, [[China seized the opportunity to]{.mark} position itself as
a global [lead]{.mark}er [and promote global development]{.mark},
economic diplomacy, and multilateralism]{.underline}. Beijing has
substantially augmented its economic and geopolitical influence in
recent years. [[China may occupy the gap created by America's
exit]{.mark} from international agreements and
multilateralism]{.underline} via the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
climate commitments, and strategic partnerships with developing nations.
[[Beijing is pursuing influence via soft power]{.mark}
mechanisms]{.underline} such as trade agreements, development loans,
infrastructure investments, cultural initiatives, and educational
exchanges. On the contrary, the United States has historically
emphasized military alliances and economic sanctions. The Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI), China's most ambitious worldwide investment endeavor,
was launched in 2013 and encompasses over 150 countries, funding
infrastructure projects including ports, roadways, trains, and energy
systems. Chinese-constructed initiatives have benefited several nations
in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, reinforcing Beijing's economic
dominance in these regions. Despite critics arguing that elevated
interest rates and unclear loan conditions may ensnare developing
nations in prolonged dependency, China's loans attract these countries
due to their generally fewer restrictions than those imposed by the IMF
or World Bank. During the COVID-19 epidemic, China used its 'Health Silk
Road' initiative to distribute millions of vaccination doses worldwide.
Despite skepticism regarding the vaccine's efficacy among certain
recipients, China's swift response strengthened relationships with
nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America---many of which received no
direct support from the U.S. throughout the crisis. China has enhanced
its standing as a benevolent economic partner by providing debt relief
to struggling economies such as Ethiopia, Zambia, and Pakistan. When
asked about the U.S exit from WHO, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson
Guo Jiakun emphasized the agency's "central and coordinating role in
global health governance." He added that, "China will, as always,
support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities, deepening
international cooperation in public health, strengthening global health
governance and promoting the building of a community of human health".
Secondly, climate diplomacy is China's most persuasive assertion of
global leadership. Following Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement
and retracting U.S. environmental regulations, China promptly endeavored
to fill the leadership void. China has significantly contributed to
global decarbonization efforts, being the foremost producer of solar
panels, wind turbines, and lithium-ion batteries. China has reinforced
its dedication to sustainability by augmenting green energy investments
in developing countries via the Belt and Road Initiative. China has
pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, signifying long-term
environmental objectives while being the largest carbon emitter
globally. Nonetheless, given China's continuous investment in
coal-powered energy initiatives, skepticism remains over the
authenticity of these commitments. Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry
spokesperson Guo Jia kun reiterated China's concern about the U.S.
withdrawing from the Paris Agreement. He said that "Climate change is a
common challenge facing all mankind... "China's determination and
actions to actively respond to climate change are consistent." He added.
Moreover, [the burgeoning strategic [cooperation between China and
Russia is a significant facet of its rise]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[The Xi-Putin alliance has recently strengthened due to their mutual
antagonism to Western hegemony.]{.underline} The video meeting between
Xi and Putin, occurring within hours after Trump's inauguration,
signaled a coordinated challenge to the U.S.-led global order. Their
collaboration establishes the foundation of an emerging China-Russia
bloc, encompassing energy agreements, joint military drills, and
diplomatic support. Both nations reject the liberal international system
led by the United States and advocate for a multipolar world order.
China's economic objectives include achieving global leadership in
technology. Beijing seeks to dominate critical areas such as
telecommunications, semiconductor production, and artificial
intelligence via its 'Made in China 2025' initiative. China's
technological advancement is spearheaded by Huawei and Alibaba,
challenging Western dominance in critical sectors. Beijing's strategic
focus on innovation and digital infrastructure is evident in the
advancement of 5G networks and government-funded quantum computing
research. Despite the United States' attempts to impede China's
technological progress, China's ongoing investments, despite trade
restrictions and penalties, demonstrate its dedication to leading the
fourth industrial revolution. China's growing participation in
international organizations signifies its expanding power. China boosted
its engagement with the World Trade Organization (WTO), World Health
Organization (WHO), and United Nations (UN), while the Trump
administration has withdrawn from international organizations. Beijing
has contested Western-dominated frameworks and advocates for alternative
governance models. China's status as a significant global financial
power has been further reinforced by the Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank (AIIB), a China-led alternative to the World Bank. Beijing's
enduring objective of reshaping the global order, to align with its
interests, is underscored by its diplomatic strategy. Moreover,
**[[China's Arctic expansion signifies a substantial shift in
geopolitics]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Beijing has declared itself a
'near-Arctic state'. It has invested in infrastructure projects in
Greenland and Russia, prompted by the emergence of new trade routes
resulting from melting ice caps. [[China has]{.underline}
**[strategically prioritized the Arctic]{.underline}** [to
dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} [vital [transportation]{.mark} routes
[and]{.mark} exploit untapped [resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
increasing influence of China in the region continues to alarm the
United States and its allies, who perceive it as advancing Beijing's
broader geopolitical objectives. [**[A retreat of]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} administration [from global leadership]{.mark}** [may
allow China to **increase its influence**]{.mark} through multilateral
cooperation, economic diplomacy, climate commitment and technological
investments.]{.underline} While it remains uncertain whether the United
States can regain its leadership status, [[Beijing is currently betting
that **actions have a greater impact than
rhetoric**]{.underline}]{.mark}, regardless of its deliberations.
[[China's rise to dominance, as a preeminent global force, appears
increasingly secure as the world realigns its alliances and
partnerships.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### UQ -- Arctic Influence

#### China is focusing on the arctic now -- increasing cooperation to strengthen their presence

**Garamone, 24' (**Jim Garamone, Dec. 5, 2024, Reporter covering
defense-related news and updates for the U.S. Department of Defense,
article, "China Increasing Interest in Strategic Arctic Region",
https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3986308/china-increasing-interest-in-strategic-arctic-region/,
A.Msigma)

[The Arctic strategic environment is changing profoundly]{.underline},
and the United States must pay greater attention and dedicate more
resources to this crucial area, said Iris A. Ferguson, the deputy
assistant secretary of defense for Arctic and Global Resilience.

[[Ferguson addressed]{.mark} the **[increased attention]{.mark}** that
the People\'s Republic of **China has [in the
Arctic]{.mark}.**]{.underline} She spoke at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies today. China is, by no means, an Arctic nation.
But [[Chinese]{.mark} leaders [see the region as]{.mark} a new
crossroads of the world, [a]{.mark} new [source of raw materials
and]{.mark} new avenues **[for]{.mark}** manifesting **[its growing
power]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[China is [working closely with Russia]{.mark} in its attempt to be seen
as an Arctic power, Ferguson said.]{.underline} Even with Russia\'s
unjust war on Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin is investing heavily on
military and economic strategies in the Arctic. \"We\'re seeing Russia
continue to have immense focus on the Arctic region, and it\'s part of
their ... security calculus, vis-a-vis the U.S. and NATO,\" Ferguson
said. \"Despite the attrition in Ukraine, we still see them \... heavily
focused on the region.\" A shifting climate is speeding the pace of
change in the region. \"Climate change is still a factor in the region,
where the region warms at some four times the rate of the rest of the
world,\" she said. This means more access for settlements in the high
North and more chances for what she calls \"competitor activity.\"

\"\[China\] is one of the newer entrants on the scene,\" Ferguson said.
\"Over time, the strategic interests that they have in the region are
... giving us pause. How their long-term vision for the region could
affect our interests, is \[also\] giving us pause.\"Even more disturbing
is the increasing levels of collaboration between Russia and China
especially in the military domain, she said. Russia and China exercised
together in the Bering Strait in summer of 2023. \"Just this past
summer, right after we released our department \[Arctic\] strategy, we
saw a joint bomber patrol off of the coast of Alaska.\"

[There has]{.underline} also [been increasing cooperation between the
**[Chinese]{.mark}** and Russian **coast guards** in the region. \"This
kind of **[increasing levels of military]{.mark}** cooperation is new,\"
she said. \"Certainly, it\'s new [within and around
Alaska]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

The new DOD Arctic strategy is aimed at preserving the region as a place
that is both stable and secure, Ferguson said. She also discussed the
Defense Department\'s three main lines of effort in the region. The
first is enhancing domain awareness to see and detect threats, and to
ensure U.S. forces can operate in the region effectively.

\"We\'re also really focused on engaging with our allies and partners,\"
she said. These nations are a unique U.S. strategic advantage that
stretches from the border of European Russia to the Bering Strait. These
are \"seven like-minded partners that are incredibly militarily capable
and also have heavy geostrategic alignment with us,\" she said.

Finally, the United States is working on using military exercises in the
region. \"We\'ve long had exercises that operate in the region, but
we\'re really looking at how we can use those as a deterrent effect,
working alongside our allies and partners,\" she said.

There\'s an evolution in how competitors think about the region,
Ferguson said. \"We\'re going to continue on the DOD side to monitor
military activity.\"

But this attention cannot be just limited to that. [The Chinese are
using other aspects of their national power to insinuate themselves into
the region. **[China]{.mark} is [involved in ]{.mark}**scientific and
research **[projects]{.mark}** [in the region]{.mark}. China is looking
[to establish economic ties]{.mark} **with[in the
Arctic]{.mark}**.]{.underline} \"We really just need to be clear-eyed
about some of their intentions and, how we can be like thinking about
their long-term interests and, how we can best protect ours,\" Ferguson
said.

[In its Made In [China 2025 initiative]{.mark}, the People's Republic of
China (PRC) detailed its [plan to fully integrate]{.mark} itself [into
the global manufacturing chain]{.mark} and broaden control of strategic
geographic locations. These plans are [driving its expansion into the
Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctic]{.underline}. On 19 November 2014, the PRC
Party Secretary & Director of the State Oceanic Administration stated
that China is destined to be a "great polar power" by 2030. [[China has
launched expeditions and established research facilities in both the
Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctic, [strengthening their influence]{.mark} in
polar affairs and shaping the evolving geopolitical
landscape]{.underline}. Beyond scientific exploration, China's growing
presence in these remote frontiers aligns with its broader strategic and
military objectives. In the Arctic, melting ice sheets pose global
challenges, but Beijing also sees opportunities. China leverages
scientific and commercial ventures to influence governance, access
natural resources, and establish new shipping routes, despite lacking
sovereign jurisdiction. Emerging shipping routes could shorten trade
transit times and improve regional resource access. However, lacking
sovereign territory in the Arctic, China relies on partnerships with
other nations to advance its interests.\[1\],\[2\],\[3\]

[China's expansion into the polar regions, as part of their Science of
Military Strategy, reflects a calculated effort to enhance its global
influence [and military capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, posing
significant challenges to U.S. national security and the Department of
Defense (DoD). Tied to its military-civil fusion (MCF) strategy, China's
Arctic research raises security concerns. Arctic research enhances
China's knowledge of submarine operations, icebreaker navigation, and
undersea communication cables, which are crucial for military
strategy.\[4\],\[5\]

efforts to increase its global influence, from bilateral humanitarian
response at the outbreak to vaccine diplomacy. China sent medical teams
and donating medical equipment to over 150 countries and joined COVAX,
the global initiative to ensure an equitable distribution of a vaccine,
before the United States. Estimates indicate that China's economy has
already recovered from the downturn driven by the pandemic, growing by

economies likely to show an overall positive rate of growth for 2020.

posts---including embassies, consulates, and permanent missions to
international organizations. In 2018, China increased its budget for
foreign aid by 7%. Belt and Road. China is expected to spend over \$1
trillion on its "Belt and Road Initiative" -- seven times the size of
the Marshall Plan in real dollars. This initiative seeks to build new
markets for Chinese goods and increase China's economic connectivity in
130 countries around the world, encompassing more than 60% of the
world's population and one-third of global GDP -- including 40 out of 54
African countries. In the first half of 2020, China's investments in the
Belt and Road Initiative dropped by about 50% due to pandemic
restrictions. Many countries announced they were postponing, cancelling,
or reviewing Chinese-funded projects, including Egypt, Bangladesh,
Pakistan, and Tanzania due to pandemic related internal economic
concerns, as well as Nigeria or Myanmar whose own pandemic economic
challenges may constrain their ability to service Belt and Road related
debt later. Chinese Development Institutions. In 2018, China launched a
ministry-level development agency -- the China International Development
Cooperation Agency -- to better coordinate and advance its commercial
and foreign policy interests around the world through foreign aid. China
also launched the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2014 which
already has 103 member states, including many of America's strategic
allies. China does not participate in international coordinating
agencies to ensure effective assistance like the OECD Development
Assistance Committee. Many of today's most pressing humanitarian crises
receive little financial contribution from the Chinese government which
has tended to focus on responding to one or two disasters annually.
Development Financing. Many have warned that China's approach to
development financing creates strategic dependencies by burdening a
borrowing nation with enormous debt and using it as leverage, a tactic
known known as debt-trap diplomacy, however, China's approach to lending
has evolved with time and experience. Recipient countries are expanding
their negotiating power and procurement capacity, Chinese banks are
willing to restructure the terms of existing loans, and multilateral
institutions and great powers are playing a role in negotiations. While
Chinese leader Xi Jinping says Chinese investments are meant to "embrace
the historic trend of economic globalization," many have left countries
-- including Djibouti, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Montenegro --
at significant risk with large debts owed to China. These concerns have
led countries such as Pakistan, Malaysia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, and
Tanzania to scale back their commitments to the initiative. Climate
Change. China, a signatory of the Paris Climate Agreement, is also the
world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (almost equal to the United
States, Europe and India combined). President Xi Jinping said China will
"aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon
neutrality before 2060," and, according to the Chinese Ministry of
Ecology and Environment, China reduced its "carbon intensity" by 18.8%
between 2015 and 2020. At the same time, in the last three years, China
has also allowed an extra 250 gigawatts of domestic coal-fired power
plants and funds 1/4 of the world's new coal-fired power plants in other
countries. CHINA'S GROWING ECONOMIC INFLUENCE AROUND THE WORLD The
Communist Party of China approved China's 14th Five-Year Plan in March
2021, an economic roadmap with a goal of raising the country's per
capita output levels up to that of "moderately developed
countries"---nearly three times the 2020 level---by 2035 such as Spain
or South Korea, through an expansion of the state's role in the economy,
dual circulation, and secure supply chains. Trade Deals: China's entry
into two new trade deals, one with 15 Asia-Pacific countries and one
with the European Union, signals its commitment to set global standards
for trade and furthers Beijing's image as the dominate economic power in
the world. Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a 15-country
trading block in the Asia-Pacific region, unites China, Japan and South
Korea in a trade deal for the first time and includes 10 Southeast Asian
countries plus Australia and New Zealand -- a population of 2.2 billion
people, almost 1/3 of the world's population. Comprehensive Agreement on
Investment binds China and the European Union to their current levels of
market openness for investments and prevents potential rollbacks, with
the possibility enhanced EU market access in China, in sectors such as
health services, chemicals, electric vehicles, and telecoms. Technology:
"China Standards 2035" creates a path for China's government and leading
technology companies to increase the number of Chinese standards that
become international standards for emerging technologies like 5G
internet, the "Internet of Things" applications for manufacturing, and
artificial intelligence. [[China aims to advance its]{.mark} digital
[infrastructure and domestic rules globally]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
has raised concerns about the ways in which it deploys and exploits
technology. Huawei, the largest telecommunications equipment
manufacturer in the world with an annual revenue of US\$108.5 billion,
has been banned in 13 countries, with 19 countries weighing a ban or
chosen competitors due to undue Chinese state support, links to the
People's Liberation Army, and cybersecurity concerns.. President Xi
announced that new energy technologies, such as car batteries from
state-owned enterprises, will enable half of the vehicles in China to be
electric or fuel-cell powered, and half hybrid by 2035. Latin America:
China has invested \$150 billion in the region since 2005, more than the
combined lending from the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank,
and the CAF-Development Bank of Latin America, of which 90% has been
directed to four countries: Venezuela, Brazil, Ecuador, and Argentina.
China has leveraged its influence to isolate Taiwan, America's strategic
ally, pressing Panama, the Dominican Republic, and El Salvador to cut
ties with Taiwan. Africa: China has increased its investments in Africa
by more than 520% over the last 15 years, surpassing the U.S. as the
largest trading partner to Africa in 2009 and becoming the top exporter
to 19 out of 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. According to McKinsey,
there are now over 10,000 Chinese firms in Africa with the potential to
generate \$440 billion in revenues by 2025. China's Export-Import bank
loaned nearly \$67 billion to Africa in the 2000s, more than 500% of the
combined World Bank loans of \$12.5 billion and aims to loan more than
\$1 trillion on the continent by 2025. Asia: China spent more than \$48
billion on diplomacy and development across East Asia and the Pacific
between 2000 and 2017, rewarding countries that support its foreign
policy positions and buy its products. More than 95% of China's
investments -- totaling \$120 billion -- have focused on infrastructure
development in the region. WHAT THEY ARE SAYING: CHINA'S GROWING GLOBAL
INFLUENCE U.S. Congress Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman, Bob
Mendez (D-NJ): "This moment demands a strong, strategic response that
can begin to rebuild American leadership and invest in our ability to
out-compete China in the generation ahead." Senate Foreign Relations
Ranking Member, James Risch (R-ID): "As we proceed through the 21st
century, [[China is going to be a major competitor]{.mark} of ours [in
every way]{.mark} that there is. Obviously [economically]{.mark} and
[militarily, culturally and every other way]{.mark}]{.underline}." House
Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairman, Gregory W. Meeks (D-NY): "China
has used floods of high-quality industrial investment from Hong Kong,
Taiwan, Japan, Korea and Singapore to become a center of world
manufacturing. [[These]{.mark} are structural [changes]{.mark} that
[will not be reversed; rather, they]{.mark} are likely to
[accelerate]{.mark}.]{.underline} And while the US needs tough policies
to prevent financial manipulation and enforce American rights as they
proceed, our response to the two giants must rest fundamentally on a
willingness to recognize their accomplishment and a determination to
match it." House Committee on Foreign Affairs Ranking Member, Mike
McCaul (R-TX): "With the emergence of China's Belt and Road Initiative
and their coercive lending practices, we must make it easier for our
businesses to have access to foreign markets...Our diplomatic personnel
on the ground in these countries and have unique insights on their
political and economic complexities. We must do more to use this
information to help the private-sector do business abroad and support
U.S. foreign policy in upholding global stability." The Biden
Administration President, Joseph Biden: "American leadership must meet
this new moment of advancing authoritarianism, including the growing
ambitions of China to rival the United States. We'll confront China's
economic abuses; counter its aggressive, coercive action; to push back
on China's attack on human rights, intellectual property, and global
governance." Secretary of State, Antony Blinken: "[[Where we pull back,
China fills in]{.underline}]{.mark} and then they're the ones writing
the rules and setting the norms of these institutions; standing up for
our values when China is challenging them, including in Xinjiang against
the Uyghurs or democracy in Hong Kong; making sure that our military is
postured so that it can deter Chinese aggression; and investing in our
own people so that they can fully compete." Secretary of the Treasury,
Janet Yellen: "The Biden administration will engage in a
whole-of-government approach to China that uses our available tools in a
manner that is designed to achieve our economic, national security, and
foreign policy goals. Going forward, we should strive to meet this
important challenge by building a united front of U.S. allies and
partners, including through multilateral institutions, to confront
China's abusive behaviors." National Security Leaders Admiral Philip
Davidson, Commander, United States Indo-Pacific Command: "We have to
move out in the diplomatic and the information space, as well as the
economic space, quite briskly because China is spreading dollars around
very perniciously through corruption, through the mechanisms that you
talked about earlier, and we've got to be willing to work in these other
realms." Additional Resources The USGLC held a virtual event with
Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) on the importance of America's diplomacy and
development programs to addressing competition with authoritarian
governments like the China Communist Party: According to Senator Romney,
"The way we win long-term against China is to have people of the world
understand what's happening there and encourage them to clamor for
freedom and democracy---which is why America's role on the world stage
is critical. We need to put a strategy in place that uses our tools of
influence---including diplomacy and development---to strengthen our
alliances and partnerships and dissuade China from the course they are
on to become a responsible member of the international community." WATCH

analysis of more than 120 think tank analyses across the political
spectrum found broad agreement on the importance of combating rising
authoritarianism but reflected different approaches to the challenge.

### UQ -- FoPo 

#### China is gaining foreign policies influence now

**Atkinson, 25'** (Emma Atkinson, March 10, 2025, Marketing &
Communications Writer / Research Podcast Host and background in
journalism, article, "'The Dragon Roars Back': How China's Foreign
Policy Is Reshaping Global Power",
https://www.du.edu/news/dragon-roars-back-how-chinas-foreign-policy-reshaping-global-power,
A.Msigma)

With the makings of a tariff war and heightened tensions between the
United States and China, it's uncertain what will happen in the coming
months when it comes to the two world powers.

Amid these geopolitical tensions, we look to [[experts in foreign
policy]{.mark} to [help us make sense of]{.mark} what's going on---and
what could be next.]{.underline}

One of those experts is the University of Denver's Suisheng Zhao, a
professor in the Josef Korbel School of International Studies and the
executive director of Korbel's Center for China-U.S. Cooperation
(CCUSC). His 2024 book on the history of Chinese foreign policy, "The
Dragon Roars Back: Transformational Leaders and Dynamics of Chinese
Foreign Policy," was named a best book of the year by Foreign Affairs
magazine.

The DU Newsroom caught up with Zhao to chat about his book and his take
on U.S.-China relations.

How would you characterize [[**Xi Jinping**---the current leader of
China]{.underline}]{.mark}---and his approach to foreign policy as
compared to that of his predecessors?

He has a totally different leadership style. Mao Zedong had what I call
"revolutionary foreign policy.". He had China stand up against the
foreign imperialist powers to make China independent. Deng Xiaoping\'s
foreign policy was "developmental foreign policy"; he used foreign
policy to serve China, \[developed\] economic modernization and economic
development objectives to create a more peaceful regional and
international environment.

[Xi Jinping [has tried to,]{.mark} in his own words, [make China
powerful]{.mark} and strong. So, he [has **developed**]{.mark} what he
calls "**[Great Power" diplomacy]{.mark}**. [China behaves]{.mark},
under Xi Jinping's leadership, [just like]{.mark} the United States, [a
big power]{.mark}.]{.underline} \[It\] tries to expand influence
globally, tries to protect and defend its expanded national interests,
tries to redefine China's relationships with its neighbors and also with
the United States. To a great extent, it tries to compete with United
States.

How has domestic public opinion influenced Chinese foreign policy?

Because China is an authoritarian, one-party state, public opinion has
normally been shaped and manufactured by the state to serve its domestic
and foreign policy agenda.

[[Xi Jinping]{.mark} just tells the Chinese people what he wants them to
know. For example, on the internet, he [has built a very powerful
firewall]{.mark} so that Chinese people only read and know what the
government wants them to read and know, [and he has **mobilized Chinese
people to support his foreign policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And his
foreign policy has become much more confrontational---it targets "evil
Western power" and U.S. and Western values. [[He tells his
people]{.mark}, "They don\'t want to see China rise. [They will do
anything to undermine China\'s rise."]{.mark}]{.underline}

What do you think the next four years will hold for the relationship
between the U.S. and China?

It's very, very difficult to make a prediction. Nobody can predict what
will happen with Trump in the White House. But [the trend has]{.mark}
[been]{.mark} very [clear;]{.mark} these two big powers have been in a
competition for the global leadership on three issues, basically.

The U.S. is the so-called "top dog" and tries to maintain that top dog
position; [[**China is a rising power** and]{.mark} wants to become a
peer of the U.S. Xi Jinping has talked about profound change---seeing a
century in which the East is on the rise and the West is in decline,
basically saying that China is rising, and the UK and the U.S. are in
decline.]{.underline}

The second is competition. For quite a while, it was ideological
competition, although ideological differences between these two
countries have been there since the normalization of the relationship in
the 1970s. After Xi Jinping came to office in last decade, China is now
challenging the U.S. democracy to a certain extent. **[China [emphasizes
its own path of modernization]{.mark},]{.underline}** which is totally
different from the liberal democratic path of modernization.

The third issue is the Taiwan issue. China, for quite a while,
emphasized peaceful unification, but that has not worked well. Taiwan
become democratic and China became authoritarian, and the U.S. also
became more sympathetic to Taiwan---to Taiwan\'s democratic
development---and the U.S. has increased support to Taiwan, both
economically and diplomatically. Taiwan has been a very hot issue that
could spark military confrontation between China and the U.S. But now
that Trump has come into office, all this has changed. He does not care
if the U.S. protects Taiwan or not.

### UQ -- Hegemony

#### China is establishing themselves as the new global hegemon after surpassing the US in every sector.

Not Hard to Imagine a Chinese-Led Global Economy;" 04-16-25; acc.

lileto

What comes next? Perhaps it shouldn't be so hard to imagine, given the
drift of what's now called geoeconomics. Already, [China commands global
trade]{.underline}, and modeling from Bloomberg shows that, as
constituted today, the [tariffs will only add to the lead --- pushing
many more countries to work more with China and less with
America.]{.underline} According to one model, 30 percent of American
trading partners would fully recover from even total cessation of U.S.
trade within one year; within five years, more than half would. This is
why [chaos is rarely the chosen strategy for a
**hegemon**]{.underline}**:** Barring what Trump calls a "beautiful
deal," the biggest single beneficiary of the whole crusade may well end
up being its intended target. [Twenty-five years ago, eight out of 10
countries in the world conducted more trade with the United States than
with China. Today **seven out of 10 count China as their larger trade
partner**.]{.underline} Probably we needn't think in such zero-sum
terms, though across four administrations, our leaders and wonks have
often urged us to, presenting as a new cold war what looks more like a
national rivalry with only a veneer of ideological conflict. And China
is facing headwinds, too --- slowing economic growth, a shrinking
population, mass youth unemployment and a lack of comfort with those
projections of soft power that for so long sustained the hologram of
unshakable American pre-eminence. Which means that the hologram of a
Chinese century is looking shaky as well, even if you're the kind of
person who sees the world's future as a neatly forking binary**.
[China's share of global manufacturing has grown so much that by
2030]{.underline}**, it is [expected to reach seven times what it was in
2000; America's will have fallen by half.]{.underline} And while Trump's
supporters describe the trade war as an effort to reverse that pattern,
they've done so little beyond erratic tariffs --- with no major pledges
of government investment and no real commitment to policy stability ---
it all looks more like policy by culture-war meme. And yet the best
memes of the past week appeared to come from China: satirical A.I. reels
of slop triumphalism showing obese Americans struggling to piece
together electronics on grimy factory floors. The Chinese Ministry of
Finance predicted that the United States "will become a joke in the
history of the world economy." It has been a decade since [China started
its Made in 2025 industrial policy]{.underline}. America bet big on
artificial intelligence and an economic future in which it reigns.
[China went big on building more stuff]{.underline}, and it turns out
that over 10 years a country like that can build quite a lot (including,
apparently, competitive A.I.). Probably you have heard about its
[**dominance in clean energy**.]{.underline} The country is now
routinely [installing as much solar power as the rest of the world
combined while producing 90 percent of the world's solar panels and more
than three-quarters of its electric batteries]{.underline}. (As part of
its tariff response, it has halted the export of several rare-earth
metals and magnets; it produces 90 percent of the world's supply of
those, too.) [China is piling]{.underline} up a [dominant position in
new patents]{.underline} as well, [surpassing the United
State]{.underline}s, and though patents are just a crude measure of
technological progress, the [gap is only widening]{.underline}. [Chinese
spending on university and government research had surpassed that in the
United States, even before Trump declared war on the country's elite
universities.]{.underline} And then along came Elon Musk and his
so-called Department of Government Efficiency to reduce the American
budget by billions of dollars and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to
deport international students here on visas or with green cards. As
recently as 2010[, China]{.underline} produced a truly negligible part
of the world's medicine; now it is the [world's second-biggest developer
of new drugs,]{.underline} and from 2020 to 2024, the [value of drugs
licensed worldwide from China grew fifteenfold,]{.underline} as The
Economist recently noted. From 2013 to 2023, China's share of global
clinical trials grew to 28 percent from 4 percent. The country has
[surpassed Europe and the United States in the number of high-quality
scientific papers published and has opened up leads in materials
science, engineering, chemistry and computer science]{.underline} ---
all domains in which **[China is responsible for more than 60 percent of
cutting-edge research]{.underline}**. These seem like important fields.
In one recent analysis of data comparing the composition of national
economic elites, America's leadership class was dominated by financial
capital workers and China's much more by engineers. For most of Trump's
second term, an electric-car billionaire has been at least the
second-most-powerful man in government, but Tesla's stock price has
fallen by nearly half since December, with liberal backlash in America
and sales in European countries falling almost 50 percent compared with
last year. China's electric vehicle powerhouse, BYD, meanwhile, expects
sales in Europe to double in 2025, having grown its global sales almost
15 times over since 2020. "[The first China shock was when China was
incorporating into our supply chains,]{.underline}" the economic
historian Adam Tooze proclaimed in November. "[The second China shock is
when we beg to be incorporated into theirs."]{.underline} We're not
there yet. But the president is choosing an entirely new phase of pretty
cutthroat geoeconomic competition by stiff-arming every potential ally
to the left of Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, slashing public investment
in research and development and announcing that the country's plan on
commerce --- as on climate and science and public health --- is to go it
alone. How long will it last? As recently as the fall, the American
economy was often described as the envy of the world. Now? "The [World's
Hot New Trade Is 'Sell America]{.underline},'" Axios declared on Friday.
The pattern is bigger than Treasury bonds. Some 30 percent of Vietnam's
G.D.P. has derived from exports to the United States. This week it
signed 45 new deals with China.

#### China is building up their power and dominance--causing a global power shift

**Butler, 24'** (Alexia J. Butler, January 18, 2024, Alexia J. Butler is
currently a sit\'s graduate institute graduate student pursuing a
master\'s degree in diplomacy and international relations. She has a
bachelor of arts in international political science with a certificate
in global peace and security. Butler has done numerous research articles
on international power dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and

international
system",https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2024/01/18/21st-century-chinese-hegemony-in-the-international-system/,
A.Msigma)

In modern times, the US is still the most powerful country, but its
persistence in interfering "in the internal affairs of other countries,
pursue, maintain, and abuse hegemony, advance subversion and
infiltration, and willfully wage wars, \[brings\] harm to the
international community," (MFAPRC, 2023) making it increasingly
unpopular. In contrast, [**[China has been building]{.mark}** its
network, **[dominance]{.mark}**, and alliances [over the past few
decades]{.mark} with a centric goal of becoming the world's new
hegemon.]{.underline} The United States is indeed the pinnacle of
military capability, but when analyzing contemporary geostrategy,
economic power is the true key to controlling the international system.
China's economic strategy is pummeling Europe and the US as the country
has already surpassed both in many economic sectors. Countries that have
normally allied with the US may find themselves "likely to collaborate
more with China economically, and even prospectively challenge the US
over strategic leadership," (Lambert, 2023, p.5). Not to mention, with
the emergence of BRICS centered around a Russian-Chinese core, the
United States nor the EU are capable of overpowering the two on a
technological, economic, or defense level. As predicted by Standard
Chartered Bank of London, China will be the #1 economy by 2030, with a
GDP of \$64.2 trillion, while the US sits at #3 with \$31 trillion.

[[China has]{.mark} taken [several unique approaches]{.mark} [towards
heg]{.mark}emony **which [have been successful]{.mark}** thus far. These
include the emergence of the BRICS bloc, the Belt and Road Initiative,
and the establishment of ports in Europe.]{.underline} In the past, the
commotion in the international system consistently dealt with the United
States, European, and Soviet Union affairs, but [the collapse of the
USSR and ever-weakening American and European order has provided an open
window for Chinese Hegemony. The Western command will be difficult to
overturn, but China's rapid reform proves its determination to apex the
international scheme.]{.underline}

When evaluating the prospect of China becoming the new world hegemon,
many do not take serious consideration. This is due to the idea that the
United States is at an uncompetitive spot in the international system,
but one must look into the past to strategically foresight the future.
For centuries, Britain was the ultimate power whose colonialism
stretched far throughout the four hemispheres. The European region is
the true creator of written history and civilization and is still a
major power today. However, much of its current success is dependent on
the United States and China. It was not until WWII that a wedge in
global power was created and the US was able to swiftly assume the
responsibility of global hegemon. Flash forward to [today, [the
US']{.mark} [tendency to spread itself too t]{.mark}hin has
[created]{.mark} various [wedges]{.mark} for other powers to sneak in
and overcome. This paper [explains how China is taking this very
opportunity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Research and Methodology

Gathered in November 2023, the trusted sources used to support this
research are from online, free, and publicly available databases. [All
initiatives, strategies, and plans included in this paper have been
active from the late 20th century to the present. [With the combination
of qualitative, survey, and exploratory research along with inductive
reasoning]{.mark}, my research aim is to analyze the **[economic]{.mark}
[movements of China]{.mark}** and how it [has strategically **formulated
Chinese hegemony**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe and the international
system in the coming decades.

First, I interpreted the rise of the United States as the global hegemon
despite originally being a project of the British. The evolution of the
British-American relationship remains a common theme throughout the
paper as it was interesting to note the paradigm of global power shifts
with the emergence of Chinese hegemony. I included [various statistics
confirming American hegemony in the 1950s while comparing it to the
Chinese position at this time to assert how far [China has]{.mark} [come
in the international **scheme of great power**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Then, I exposed America's shortcomings in connection with China's
influence over North Korea to expose China's first "win" in response to
American insecurity. Following this, I included America's current
behavior to foreshadow the fall of its power by the latter half of this
century.

I then go back to explain the rise of the Chinese Government since the
1950s and its success in the previous decades to portray its elegant and
swift rise to power. Including the Soviets' contribution to this success
provided a basis to elaborate on the mutually beneficial Chinese-Russian
relationship as well as the emergence of BRICS. I used [reliable sources
that have been measuring China's linear movement in overcoming its
surrounding regions, with Europe being one of the primary attainment
goals.]{.underline}

This allowed me to delve into the importance of Europe in this matter
as, according to the Rimland theory, whoever controls the regions in the
rimland, will control the world. While the origin of America was
codependent on Britain's supremacy, the roles have reversed in modern
times with America as the hegemon with vast control over the Western
hemisphere. However, with the predicted trajectory of modern America,
the fall of its hegemony would immediately correspond with the fall of
Europe, a great victory for the Chinese agenda. I included primary and
secondary research on European Union dilemmas and their dependency on
American aid, economics, trade, and defense. With this research, I was
able to formulate an educated [prediction of European welfare amid a
[global power shift from America to China]{.mark}]{.underline}. I also
briefly touched on the [economic initiatives of China such as the BRI,
BRICS, and the **establishment of Chinese institutions** in Europe to
widen the readers' view on the Chinese strategy [to surpass European
power.]{.mark}]{.underline}

While conducting this research, I used the institutional analysis and
development (IAD) framework by analyzing international actors,
historical backgrounds, institutional settings, incentive structures,
policies, and more to develop the subsequent Chinese hegemony. Taking
[the most influential initiatives such as the Belt and Road initiative,
the formation of the BRICS Bloc, and [establishing Chinese
institution]{.mark}s beyond their immediate scope,]{.underline} I [was
able to examine how each strategy [has **contributed to China's
success**ful economic position]{.mark} and hegemonic prowess. I conclude
with supporting evidence of Chinese economic strategy to further
convince the reader that Chinese dominance in Europe is forthcoming,
thus generating a new world order summited by China.]{.underline}

Contemporary Chinese Power

Today, [it is clear that China is far greater than its tumultuous past
and is underway to become a formidable global force.]{.underline} In
comparison to American economic power in the 1950s, it is as if China
has mirrored these successes today. Having quadrupled the size of its
economy since the late 1970s, [China now "has become one of the world's
major manufacturing centers and consumed roughly a third of the global
supply of iron, steel, and coal while accumulating massive foreign
reserves,"]{.underline} (Ikenberry, 2008, p.26). [[The country
has]{.mark} [increased its military spending]{.mark} to over 18 percent
yearly while extending its diplomatic ties to Europe, the Middle East,
Latin America, and Africa. Originally portrayed as an emerging market,
China has now taken over the international stage "as both a military and
an economic rival--**[heralding a profound shift in the distribution of
global power]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} (Ikenberry, 2008, p.26).

[China needed to increase its soft power. The Chinese government has
[spent tens of billions of dollars to that end]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Admittedly, it has achieved mixed results at best, owing to two major
obstacles: it has stoked rancorous territorial disputes with a number of
its neighbors, and the [CCP maintains tight control over all
organizations and opinions in civil society]{.underline}. China
generates resentments when it ignores internationally recognized
borders. And it comes across poorly to people in many countries when it
jails human rights lawyers and compels nonconformists, such as the
brilliant artist Ai Weiwei, into exile. At least before Trump's second
term began, China lagged far behind the United States in the court of
global public opinion. Pew surveyed 24 countries in 2023 and reported
that a majority of respondents in most of them found the United States
more attractive than China, with Africa the only continent where the
results were even close. [More recently, in May 2024, Gallup found that
in [133 countries it surveyed, the United States had the advantage in 81
and China in 52. If Trump keeps undercutting American soft power,
however, these numbers may change markedly.]{.mark}]{.underline} To be
sure, American soft power has had its ups and downs over the years. The
United States was unpopular in many countries during the Vietnam War and
the Iraq war. But soft power derives from a country's society and
culture, not just the actions of its government. Even during the Vietnam
War, when crowds marched through streets around the world to protest
American policies, they did not sing the communist "Internationale" but
the American civil rights anthem "We Shall Overcome." An open civil
society that allows protest and accommodates dissent can be an asset.
But the soft power derived from American culture will not survive the
excesses of the U.S. government during the next four years if American
democracy continues to erode and the country acts as a bully abroad. For
its part, [[China is striving to fill any gaps that Trump creates. It
sees itself as the leader of the so-called global South. It aims to
displace the American order of international alliances and
institution]{.underline}s]{.mark}. Its Belt and Road infrastructure
investment program is designed not only to attract other countries but
also to provide hard economic power. [[More countries have China as
their largest trading partner than have the United States as
such]{.underline}]{.mark}. If Trump thinks he can compete with China
while weakening trust among American allies, asserting imperial
aspirations, destroying the U.S. Agency for International Development,
challenging the rule of law at home, and withdrawing from UN agencies,
he is likely to be disappointed.

### UQ -- Soft Power

#### China is increasing its soft power while the US has dismantled its own soft power through budget cuts and lack of strategic policy 

Li **Qiang 6/25**/2025 -- Li Qiang is the founder and executive director
of China Labor Watch and a human rights advocate with over 30 years of
experience investigating global supply chains. ("Before the US Realizes
the Cost, China Is Rapidly Gaining Soft Power Ground," The Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2025/06/before-the-us-realizes-the-cost-china-is-rapidly-gaining-soft-power-ground/)
-- **DF**

For U.S. policymakers, the lesson should be clear: sustaining
communication channels with foreign societies is not an afterthought. It
is a strategic necessity if Washington wishes to retain global soft
power. As it stands, [the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[is]{.mark} at risk of **[losing its leadership in]{.mark} the [global
narrative space]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- not because of China's rise,
but due to its own retreat. The United States' global dominance has not
rested solely on economic and military prowess. For decades, [its
cultural leadership, international authority, and values-driven
alliances were supported by robust investment in international
broadcasting, global aid, humanitarian assistance, and
projects]{.underline} anchored around the universal values of freedom
and human rights. However, recent [[federal budget cuts have]{.mark}
swiftly [dismantled]{.mark} these pillars of
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} VOA, among other federal
government-funded media, is just a part of the picture. [[Civil society
organizations]{.mark}, long the [backbone of]{.mark} U.S. [soft
power]{.mark} and global credibility, [are]{.mark} also [being
weakened]{.mark} by funding delays, political drift, and administrative
uncertainty.]{.underline} If Congress fails to act, authoritarian
regimes will be the one to fill the void in the global information
arena.The [White House's proposed fiscal year 2026 budget makes matters
worse]{.underline}. It calls for the complete elimination of funding for
the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), which currently supports
over 1,900 projects worldwide, including independent media, election
monitoring, and labor rights initiatives. Without this funding, many
grassroots programs would simply collapse. China Labor Watch, a
non-profit I founded over 20 years ago, is among many affected. Two
current grants, with an annual combined budget of \$600,000 -- or 80
percent of our 2025 budget -- are due to expire in September. Despite
resuming operation after a temporary freeze, our future remains
precarious. Just last week, China Labor Bulletin, founded 30 years ago
to monitor labor rights violations in China, announced its closure,
citing a lack of funding[. In the China field, U.S. soft power is
diminishing.]{.underline} NGOs working on China issues face dual
pressure: dwindling economic resources and growing repression. The
Chinese government has imposed coordinated efforts targeting overseas
civil society through surveillance, harassment, and coercion -- often
extending to the family of activists across borders. The impact of this
could be long-standing. In the China human rights field alone, there are
already fewer young professionals with Chinese language proficiency and
human rights experience entering the field, leading to a growing talent
gap that likely threatens the sector's future. More importantly, many
are starting to doubt the United States' commitment to defending human
rights and safeguarding activists against repression. Major
international NGOs and international organizations are announcing
layoffs and closure of field offices, threatening a slew of global
initiatives including international peacekeeping and humanitarian aid
missions, critical social and biomedical research, as well as human
rights advocacy. The work of organizations like CLW is not immaterial.
Our investigations have had meaningful impacts, leading to Samsung
re-auditeding over 100 factories worldwide, Apple publicly acknowledging
its suppliers' labor violations, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) restricting certain imports. All of these are only possible thanks
to sustained funding and a network of reliable, passionate partners and
talents. Without these essential resources, CLW and similar
organizations may no longer be able to carry out similar work. [All of
these play into a part of a broader trend of the United States'
declining global image, eroding the country's influence]{.underline}.
While civil society organizations around the world are affected by U.S.
budget cuts**, [[China is expanding its global narrative
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**[. Beijing is [pouring colossal
amounts of resources to build]{.mark} an [international media
apparatus]{.mark} with the task of "telling China's story well." This
network now includes more than 30 overseas media outlets broadcasting
contents in different languages, with a reach of over 60 countries and
over 100 million people]{.underline}. Simultaneously, hundreds of
[[state-funded institutes]{.mark} such as Confucius Institute and [think
tanks]{.mark} are [shap]{.mark}ing elite [discourse in Africa, Southeast
Asia, and Latin America]{.mark}, cultivating the next generation
of]{.underline} political, business, and academic [leaders.]{.underline}
In Brazil, for example, China has established 11 Confucius Institutes,
and in Malaysia, China has provided scholarships for students. [China's
trillion-dollar [Belt and Road Initiative]{.mark}]{.underline}, though
criticized for creating debt dependency and lack of transparency, [has
delivered large-scale [infrastructure and development assistance to
countries long neglected]{.mark} by traditional donors and has been
described as an effort to [increase the country's soft
power]{.mark}.]{.underline} While the [U.S. government significantly
reduced USAID funding, NGOs in Colombia say that the **[Chinese
government is interested in filling the void]{.mark}**; similarly,
Nepal's government mentioned that Chinese officials signaled they could
provide development funding.]{.underline}What ties these efforts
together is coordination and ambition. Backed by centralized control,
Beijing has built a stable, far-reaching opinion ecosystem that rapidly
amplifies its messages. In comparison, the [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has recently shown a [lack]{.mark} of coherent and
long-term [strategy to sustain]{.mark} its global [soft
power]{.mark}.]{.underline} Its dismantling of civil society support
systems has proven not only counterproductive but difficult and costly
to repair. The story of VOA's Persian Service should also serve as a
cautionary tale.

#### US decline lets Chinese soft-power come to the forefront

//as//\]

[Since the [Trump administration]{.mark} came into office, it [has
quickly torn apart the U.S. foreign aid apparatus]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Besides freezing many types of aid, the [administration has decimated
the U.S. Agency for International Development]{.underline}, [firing over
1,600 staffers, closing the Agency's headquarters]{.underline}, and
putting most of the Agency's staff around the world on leave. (A federal
judge, U.S. District Court Judge Carl Nichols, recently allowed these
actions to continue, refusing to keep a temporary stay on the Agency's
closure.)

These actions have resulted in the [shutdowns of thousands of USAID
programs worldwide, including many regions where [China is increasingly
ascendant]{.mark}]{.underline}---equal to or greater than the United
States [regarding trade with, investment in, and diplomatic ties to
states in these regions.  ]{.underline}

[China has also been inching closer [to U.S. soft
power]{.mark}]{.underline} in many parts of the world and will now seek
to eclipse Washington's soft power by immediately stepping into the
void. Southeast Asia is one example: China already dominates regional
trade and has increasingly dominated regional diplomacy. Additionally,
[it has bolstered its soft power]{.mark} and won more significant
concessions from Malaysia and Indonesia on the South China Sea dispute
than in the past.

Under Anwar Ibrahim, [Malaysia has moved significantly closer to
China.]{.underline} This shift is partly due to Anwar's belief in his
ability to negotiate effectively with Beijing, partly because of China's
substantial economic influence, and partly because the war in Gaza has
made the United States highly unpopular in Malaysia.

[Even before the USAID shutdown, polls by the ISEAS Yusof-Ishak
Institute in Singapore showed that **[China had [edged
ahead](https://www.iseas.edu.sg/centres/asean-studies-centre/state-of-southeast-asia-survey/the-state-of-southeast-asia-2024-survey-report/)
of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates** [in popularity]{.mark} in many
Southeast Asian states.]{.underline} This may have been in part because
of the unpopularity of the Gaza war in much of Southeast Asia.

My anecdotal interactions with a wide range of opinion leaders from the
ten ASEAN states and Timor-Leste suggest that much of [Southeast
Asia]{.mark} was [losing faith in the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited States
[even]{.mark} beyond the Gaza war and [before the Trump
administration]{.mark} began to reduce aid. This loss of faith was in
areas once core strengths of U.S. popularity and influence, including
trade and economic leadership, interest in political reform, the
popularity of U.S. culture and education, the appeal of high-tech
consumer goods, and the value of security and strategic support.

They believe [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [will continue to fall
behind]{.mark} the region's [trading trends and trade
integration]{.mark}]{.underline}. They see the [United
States,]{.underline} which is [experiencing democratic
backsliding]{.underline}, preaching democratic reform to some countries
like Myanmar and Cambodia while ignoring it in others like Vietnam,
which is strategically important to Washington. Additionally, they
[[increasingly view Chinese products]{.mark}, from electric cars to
phones, [**as equal to or better** than American ones]{.mark} and
believe the United States is losing its technological
advantages.]{.underline} This belief is evident in the rapid expansion
of Chinese car makers into places like Thailand and Indonesia.

Many Southeast Asian opinion leaders do not understand the wild swings
in U.S. policy positions from administration to administration, except a
tiny handful who intensely follow U.S. domestic politics. Nor do they
comprehend many of the issues that seemed strange to them to dominate
U.S. politics (issues related to how courses are taught in U.S. higher
education, bathroom rights) but which have little relevance in Southeast
Asia and appear to undermine U.S. policymaking. [U.S.
culture]{.underline} increasingly seems to [befuddle, too,]{.underline}
with so much [online U.S. discourse divorced from issues in their
region]{.underline} and, sometimes, divorced from reality. U.S. higher
education is becoming difficult to access, and now, under the Trump
administration, it will get much more complicated for Southeast Asians
and [other foreigners]{.underline}---they [are [turning instead]{.mark}
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand,
Singapore, and [[China]{.mark}.]{.underline} With these losses, only
U.S. security protection has remained, and the Trump administration has
thus far remained unclear on how it will handle key U.S. allies and
partners in the region like Australia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand, and Vietnam.

Now, another pillar of [U[.S. popularity has been
**decimated**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While [USAID and other foreign
aid]{.underline} consumed a tiny portion of the total U.S. budget, they
were [often the leading edge of U.S. soft power, along with U.S.
culture]{.underline}. This was not only the case in Southeast Asia but
also in Africa, Central Asia, Latin America, and other developing
regions where China was already competing with or surpassing the United
States in economic and diplomatic influence.

China has not only wasted little time touting the end of much U.S.
foreign aid---USAID spent about \$40 billion a year---but has also
linked it to the overall U.S. global decline. It has also begun to
identify places with potential projects in countries where USAID is now
gone or all but gone.

[China has already increased its foreign aid and outright grants in
Southeast Asia in recent years]{.underline} despite its focus on loans
for projects as its primary source of aid. For example, [China donated
more than]{.underline} [seven million vaccines to nine ASEAN
countries]{.underline} during the COVID-19 pandemic, has funded
[infrastructure projects]{.underline} like the Phnom Penh‑Sihanoukville
Expressway, and granted university scholarships to Malaysian students.
And, of course, [China has made huge promises of
investments]{.underline}, admittedly not grants[, to other
regions.]{.underline} The *Christian Science Monitor*
[[notes]{.underline}](https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-Pacific/2025/0225/china-usaid-freeze-doge),
"Last fall, Beijing hosted a China-Africa summit at which Chinese leader
Xi Jinping pledged that [China would contribute \$50 billion in loans
and investment to boost economic and infrastructure development in
Africa over the next three years."]{.underline}

**[Beijing appears to be seeking to move to places where USAID has moved
out]{.underline}**. Beijing seems to be considering increasing a range
of humanitarian aid projects in health, education, and sanitation in
mainland Southeast Asia, in some of the region's poorest states. Beijing
picks out particularly notable and newsworthy projects to take over,
too; it assumed the cost of a high-profile de-mining project in Cambodia
that the United States used to fund, for instance. In strategically
important Nepal, *Politico* reported that China would likely provide the
aid to [replace the funding]{.underline} that USAID had provided. In
Colombia, "non-governmental organizations that received USAID funding
say the Chinese government [is interested in putting up money to help
fill]{.underline} the void."

[These are early days, too. Without a doubt, [China will take]{.mark}
more and more [advantage of the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
[squandering of its soft power]{.mark}.]{.underline} If, as is possible,
the White House's appointees to run Voice of America and the
organization that oversees outlets like Radio Free Asia's many networks
turn these media outlets---U.S. government, backed but with a reputation
for absolute independence---into essentially propaganda, it will make it
easier for China to continue to get Xinhua accepted as a regular news
source in outlets across the world, a process it has been working on for
more than a decade. Suppose other donors, like the Gates Foundation or
major donors like Japan, cannot fulfill projects USAID abandoned. In
that case, [China will likely begin providing more outright aid, not
loans, to continue some of these initiatives, especially in states of
strategic importance to Beijing.]{.underline} In Southeast Asia and many
other developing regions, [[it is China's time now.]{.underline}]{.mark}

PLiii

[The [Arctic]{.mark}, a region long characterized by its remoteness and
extreme conditions, is [rapidly]{.mark} [transforming into]{.mark} a
[geopolitical hotspot.]{.mark}]{.underline} [This [change]{.mark} is
[driven]{.mark} not only [by]{.mark} the accelerating effects of
[climate change]{.mark} but [also]{.mark} by the strategic and
scientific [interests of]{.mark} both Arctic and [non-Arctic
states]{.mark}. Among these, [China]{.mark} stands out for its
significant and growing influence, [leveraging]{.mark} scientific
[research to bolster]{.mark} its [position]{.mark} in this evolving
arena.]{.underline} [[Scientific research]{.mark} has been
[pivotal]{.mark} in the Arctic, particularly in delineating the
boundaries of the continental shelf, which in turn [helps determine
which states can exploit]{.mark} the region's natural
[resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} Arctic states are investing millions to
document their territorial claims, with scientific data presented to the
United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS).
The CLCS then makes recommendations to help ascertain ownership, a
process that underscores the importance of scientific evidence in
geopolitical claims. [Non-Arctic states like [China]{.mark}, India, and
South Korea have also [utilized scientific research]{.mark} to
[gain]{.mark} [observer status]{.mark} on the Arctic Council, the
primary forum for cooperation in the region. This strategy
[allows]{.mark} them [to participate in discussions]{.mark} and
[influence decisions despite no]{.mark}t having [territory]{.mark} in
the Arctic. The [presence]{.mark} of non-Arctic states is most [visible
in Svalbard]{.mark}, a territory in the high Arctic under Norwegian
sovereignty but [open to scientists]{.mark} from countries that are
parties to the Svalbard Treaty. This unique arrangement has made
Svalbard a hub for international scientific collaboration and a [focal
point for]{.mark} countries like [China]{.mark}, India, and the United
Kingdom.]{.underline} Global attention on the Arctic has intensified
amid global warming, particularly since 2007. [[China]{.mark}'s
[interest]{.mark} has [drawn]{.mark} significant [scrutiny]{.mark} due
to its emergence as a global superpower, its [develop]{.mark}ment of
advanced [polar tech]{.mark}nology, including [icebreakers]{.mark}, and
its official [Arctic policy]{.mark}, which [outlines]{.mark} its
[ambitions]{.mark} in the region. Chinese [activity]{.mark} has been
particularly [focused on]{.mark} the central [Arctic Ocean,]{.mark} an
area considered international waters beyond any state's jurisdiction.
This status allows non-Arctic states like [China]{.mark} to
[engage]{.mark} more [freely than in other parts]{.mark} of the Arctic.
[China]{.mark} has [signed]{.mark} and [ratified]{.mark} an
[international agreement that prohibits commercial fisheries]{.mark} in
these waters until at least 2037, placing science at the heart of this
moratorium.]{.underline} Scientists are tasked with assessing if
sizeable fish stocks can be harvested sustainably, influencing future
guidelines and ensuring the long-term health of these stocks. As China
prepares for its 14th annual Arctic expedition this summer, it's crucial
to understand how its scientific research is evolving and what
implications this holds for the region. [Since the early 2000s,
[China]{.mark} has [emerged as]{.mark} a major [contributor to Arctic
science]{.mark}, a trend that continues into the 2020s.]{.underline}
Analyzing data from Web of Science, a bibliometric database, reveals a
five-fold increase in the percentage of scientific articles on the
Arctic authored by Chinese scientists from 2000 to 2024. This surge
coincides with a significant decrease in the proportion of articles by
scientists from the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada. [Two
specific areas within the Arctic Ocean stand out for their focus in
[Chinese research]{.mark}: the central [Arctic Ocean and]{.mark} the
[Gakkel Ridge]{.mark}, a mountainous formation on the sea floor.
[Publications]{.mark} on the central Arctic Ocean have [increased
eightfold]{.mark}, while those on the Gakkel Ridge have seen a sixfold
rise, attributed largely to China's annual Arctic expeditions. The
central [Arctic Ocean]{.mark} is [crucial for China's geopolitical
interests]{.mark}, particularly concerning the potential establishment
of a regional fisheries management organization.]{.underline} This
organization would play a key role in lifting the current moratorium on
commercial fisheries, contingent on the development of sustainable
guidelines for fish stock health and survival. [The [Gakkel
Ridge]{.mark}, with its hydrothermal vents, presents another [area of
interest due to]{.mark} its potential for [mineral exploitation]{.mark}.
[Russia claims]{.mark} this ridge as a continuation of its continental
mass, [but]{.mark} the [possibility of]{.mark} mineral [extraction by
non-Arctic states]{.mark}, including China, has been
[speculated]{.mark}. As of the mid-2020s, [China ranks]{.mark} as the
[fourth-largest contributor to scientific knowledge]{.mark} about this
part of the Arctic. [Chinese]{.mark} scientific [research]{.mark} in the
Arctic is [notable for]{.mark} its [limited engagement with
Western]{.mark} publications and [scientists]{.mark}. According to
Scopus, a database of scientific articles, [45% of articles]{.mark} by
Chinese scientists on the central Arctic Ocean are [published in
outlets]{.mark} run or sponsored [by Chinese]{.mark} research
institutes, such as the Chinese Society for Oceanography and the Polar
Research Institute of China. Researchers Mayline Strouk of the
University of Edinburgh and Marion Maisonobe of University Paris Cité
have noted that [China]{.mark}, along with other non-Arctic states like
India and South Korea, tends [to pursue scientific autonomy]{.mark},
[minimizing collaboration]{.mark} with international
scientists.]{.underline} This approach is reflected in the authorship of
scientific papers: approximately 65% of articles by Chinese authors on
the central Arctic Ocean from 2010 to May 2024 were written solely by
Chinese researchers, with no involvement from non-Chinese scientists.
This trend persists despite China's participation in multinational
efforts like the Mosaic Expedition of 2019, which included scientists
from 19 countries and aimed to generate comprehensive insights by
studying the central Arctic Ocean for an entire year. [[Despite]{.mark}
the [collaborative nature]{.mark} of this expedition, [Chinese
scientific research]{.mark} in the Arctic remains predominantly
[authored by Chinese]{.mark} scientists and published in Chinese-run
outlets. The growing [dominance of China in]{.mark} Arctic scientific
[research]{.mark} has significant [impli]{.mark}cations for Arctic
states. The [decreasing presence of Arctic states]{.mark} in scientific
publications means that [critical knowledge]{.mark} is increasingly
being [shaped by]{.mark} the interests of [non-Arctic
nations]{.mark}.]{.underline} This shift poses challenges for Arctic
states as they navigate the complex interplay of scientific research and
geopolitical strategy. [For Arctic states, [investing in Arctic]{.mark}
science is [crucial to maintain influence]{.mark} over the region's
future.]{.underline} Scientific research provides the foundation for
legal regimes and rules that will govern the central Arctic Ocean, an
area of immense strategic and economic importance. Ensuring that these
rules are informed by a comprehensive and collaborative understanding of
the region is essential. [[China's approach]{.mark} to Arctic science,
characterized by a [focus on autonomy]{.mark} and [limited international
collaboration]{.mark}, highlights the [need for Arctic states]{.mark} to
[prioritize transparency]{.mark} and [coop]{.mark}eration in their
scientific endeavors.]{.underline} Science should be an open and
collaborative enterprise, fostering shared understanding and mutual
benefits. [The trend of [isolated research by China]{.mark}, however,
[reflects]{.mark} broader [geopolitical dynamics]{.mark} and underscores
the importance of vigilance and proactive engagement by Arctic nations.
[China's surging presence]{.mark} in the Arctic is [reshaping]{.mark}
the region's [geopolitical landscape]{.mark}. Through sustained
investment in scientific research and strategic initiatives, China is
[positioning itself as]{.mark} a [key player]{.mark} in the Arctic,
raising important questions about the future of international
cooperation and governance in this rapidly changing region. [As climate
change continues to thaw]{.mark} the Arctic, the [actions]{.mark} of
states like China will [significantly influence the region's
trajectory.]{.mark}]{.underline} For Arctic and non-Arctic states alike,
the challenge lies in balancing national interests with the need for
collaborative, science-based stewardship of this unique and fragile
ecosystem. [The [evolving dynamics]{.mark} in the Arctic
[underscore]{.mark} the critical [role of science]{.mark} in shaping the
future of one of the world's last frontiers.]{.underline}

[[China's expanding presence in]{.underline}]{.mark} both [[the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and Antarctic [[is part of its **broader
pursuit of global great power status**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Its
contributions to polar science have]{.underline} **[given it a

affairs]{.underline}, while [[opening the door to

International cooperation will be necessary for the responsible
management and stewardship of the poles, and China can play a positive
role in those efforts. Still, the United States and its allies should
carefully monitor China's evolving activities and push for greater
transparency.

[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} should also [[focus on crafting

[partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline} with like-minded countries and

China's Arctic Strategy In 2018, the PRC published China's Arctic Policy
white paper, outlining China's policy goals, principles, policies, and
positions on Arctic affairs, governance and international cooperation,
scientific exploration, and exploitation of resources. [The white paper
describes [China]{.mark} as an **important stakeholder** in Arctic
affairs; [committed to scientific collaboration]{.mark}, research, and
exploration in the Arctic; and [invested in]{.mark} the
[econ]{.mark}omic development in all Arctic states and asserting China
should be considered an equal partner as a near-Arctic state. [Changing
conditions]{.mark} in the Arctic, claims the white paper, [have a
**direct impact on China**'s climate]{.mark}, ecological
[environment]{.mark}, [and economic interests]{.mark}; thus, Beijing
proposes China should have rights and privileges in the Arctic analogous
to those nations having territories within the Arctic
Circle.]{.underline} The PRC assessed the current situation in the
Arctic "[goes beyond its original inter-Arctic States or regional
nature, [hav]{.mark}ing a [vital bearing on]{.mark} the interests of
States outside the region and the interests of the [international
community]{.mark} as a whole, as well as on the [survival]{.mark}, the
[development]{.mark}, and the **[shared future for
mankind]{.mark}**."]{.underline}9 According the Arctic Narratives and
Political Values: Arctic States, China, and NATO report, the PRC
assesses Arctic issues have global implications and international
impacts, and "States from outside the Arctic region do not have
territorial sovereignty in the Arctic, but they do have rights in
respect of scientific research, navigation, overflight, fishing, laying
of submarine cables and pipelines in the high seas and other relevant
sea areas in the Arctic Ocean, and rights to resource exploration and
exploitation in the Area, pursuant to treaties such as UNCLOS \[United
Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea\] and general international
law." [Thus, [Beijing holds Arctic exploration]{.mark}, exploitation,
[and development]{.mark} of Arctic natural resources [as **key strategic
objectives for China's future**]{.mark} energy, economic, and
development needs]{.underline}, while portraying China as having "shared
interests with Arctic States and a shared future with the rest of the
world in the Arctic."10

China's Strategic Interest in the Arctic [[China's interest in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} dates back to the 1980s, though it was
initially limited to scientific research. Since 2012, however, its
involvement [has [intensified]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with increased
budget allocations and strategic planning]{.underline}. In 2013, China
gained observer status in the Arctic Council, even though it is not
geographically part of the Arctic region. [In 2017, it announced the
Polar Silk Road]{.underline}, and in 2018, it published a white paper
titled China's Arctic Policy. According to some studies out of China,
the Arctic may be navigable at times by 2030. Beijing has already signed
agreements with Russia, Iceland and Greenland to secure access, aiming
to establish the Arctic as one of its key shipping routes.
[[China's]{.mark} economic and strategic [power relies heavily
on]{.mark} manufacturing and [trade]{.mark}. This dependence requires
importing energy resources]{.underline}---such as oil and natural
gas---[and exporting manufactured goods]{.underline}. [Maritime shipping
is the primary mode of transport for both]{.underline}. More than 80% of
global trade by volume is carried by sea. Most of China's energy imports
and goods exports depend on the Southern Hemisphere route---as opposed
to the Arctic, which represents the northern route---specifically
through the Pacific and Indian oceans. This path includes key choke
points and shipping routes such as the South China Sea, Strait of
Malacca, Arabian Sea, Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb, Red Sea and Suez
Canal, all of which are largely under US influence and surveillance.
[[Using the Arctic route can reduce travel time]{.mark} for Chinese
ships to Europe]{.underline}---and back---[by up to 40%.]{.underline}
[If China also imports energy from the Arctic]{.underline}---where an
estimated 30% of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its
undiscovered oil may be located---[transportation costs could be lowered
on shorter shipping times.]{.underline} This could lead to reduced
production costs, increased profit margins, and greater competitiveness
for Chinese exports---all from a region that, unlike the southern route,
does not yet fall under US influence. Consequently, **[[the Arctic holds
significant geopolitical and economic importance for
China.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Russia's Strategic Interest in the Arctic
The Arctic is deeply rooted in Russian identity and history. Russia has
the strongest military and political presence in the region, with its
Arctic territory stretching across 24,140 kilometers of coastline. The
Kremlin now hopes to use the Arctic's natural resources to maintain its
influence over global energy markets, particularly natural gas. One of
Russia's longstanding geopolitical challenges has been its historic lack
of direct and reliable access to warm water ports. The thawing of the
Arctic and opening of the region to year-round shipping represents the
possibility of finally overcoming this longstanding geographical
disadvantage. Year-round shipping via the Arctic holds out the promise
of enhancing Russia's geopolitical influence, elevating the country's
strategic importance in the calculations of China and Europe, while also
undermining US hegemony. It would also create significant economic
opportunities, reflected in the Kremlin's ongoing interest in developing
the Northern Sea Route. While Russia views much of the Arctic as its
domain and a component of its national security, China's growing
interest in the region may raise concerns in the future. The current
Russia-China cooperation is primarily tactical, rooted in shared
opposition to U.S. dominance. Russia lacks the investment capacity to
fully develop the Arctic and may need Chinese capital, while China seeks
Russia's political and legal support in the region. US Strategic
Interest in the Arctic The United States borders the Arctic via Alaska,
which was acquired from Russia in 1867 for \$7.2 million---a deal mocked
at the time as "Seward's Folly," named after US Secretary of State
William H. Seward, who handled the purchase. Today, however, it might be
more accurately described as "Seward's foresight." [With climate change
accelerating in the Arctic and Chinese]{.underline} and Russian
[ambitions growing]{.underline}, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has [[increased its interest in the region
to **counter potential strategic challenges**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
example, the 2020 US military budget included funding for the
construction of a port in Alaska to bolster US military presence in the
Arctic, though the project has since slipped into limbo due to cost
overruns. President Trump's repeated proposals and demands to acquire
Greenland from Denmark also fit within the emerging frame of Arctic
geopolitics, where Washington looks to expand its influence and counter
Chinese and Russian encroachment into the region. Another factor behind
the US interest in the Arctic is the enduring influence of Alfred
Mahan's (1840--1914) geopolitical doctrine on American strategic
thinking since the time of President Theodore Roosevelt (1901--1909).
Mahan was a friend and adviser to Roosevelt, and his geopolitical ideas
helped shape the president's policies. During Roosevelt's presidency,
the United States became the second most powerful naval force in the
world, behind the United Kingdom. Mahan believed that world dominance
could be achieved through control of global trade routes that crossed
the seas and oceans. Maintaining dominance over the seas---not the land,
as Halford Mackinder believed---during both peace and war meant
domination of the world. Looking Ahead Mahan's arguments and recent
history suggest that [[the Arctic could become a major global trade
route]{.mark} in the future]{.underline}. **[[If the United States does
not gain significant influence over it]{.underline}]{.mark}**---matching
Washington's current dominance over southern routes---**[[the result
could be a significantly weakened US hegemony and changes to the global
order.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Chinese General Secretary [Xi Jinping believes]{.underline} he is
[leading his country into a "**new era" of geopolitical
dominance.**]{.underline}15 According to Xi, since its founding in 1921,
the [CCP has overcome China's long history of socioeconomic
turmoil]{.underline} and secured remarkable successes. He holds up the
[CCP's recent achieve- ments in "eliminating absolute
poverty]{.underline}" and "[build- ing]{.underline} a moderately
[prosperous society]{.underline}" as [evidence of]{.underline}
**[China's inexorable rise]{.underline}**.16 Xi therefore sees [China as
well positioned to take "center stage"]{.underline} in world affairs and
[displace the United States]{.underline} [in terms of "comprehensive
national power and international influence."]{.underline}17 In this new
era, the [CCP]{.underline} will [remold the international system into an
expression of "socialism with Chinese characteristics]{.underline}."
[Xi's exuberance]{.underline}, however, is [tempered by]{.underline} his
[belief that the CCP's worldmaking campaign will meet resis- tance from
the United States.]{.underline} In fact, he insists that a "[protracted
struggle" is already underway]{.underline} [between Chinese socialism
and Western democratic capital- ism]{.underline} that will [decide the
fate of the international sys- tem]{.underline}. [Xi has]{.underline}
[every confidence]{.underline}, though, [that structural trends lend
**China an overwhelming advantage**]{.underline}. If the CCP marshals
enough discipline and cunning, [Beijing will emerge victorious over a
United States trapped in inexorable decline]{.underline}. "Our continued
success [in adapt- ing Marxism to the Chinese context]{.underline} and
the needs of our times," Xi boasted in November 2021, "has . . .
[significantly shifted the worldwide historical evolu- tion . . . in a
way that favors socialism]{.underline}."18 To expedite these historical
forces, [Beijing dan- gles ambitious development and security
programs]{.underline} before countries on Eurasia's sprawling periphery
as an alternative to the US-led liberal order. [The Belt and Road
Initiative and Global Development Initiative,]{.underline} for example,
are designed to [export China's devel- opment model and bring countries
in Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa under Beijing's
sway]{.underline}.19 The CCP also offers the Global Security Initiative
as a [more "inclusive" architecture for "world peace and tranquility"
than the American "unilateralism]{.underline}" that has [long frustrated
the so-called Global South]{.underline}.20 The Global Security
Initiative is [meant to provide partner countries with better internal
and "regime" security]{.underline} in contrast to Washington's alliance
system and pro- vision of external security. These Chinese programs
certainly cast a veneer of altruism, but they are sub- terfuge for the
CCP's campaign to supplant Washing- ton's influence across Eurasia.
Bolstering the [CCP's worldmaking project is its deepening relationship
with Russia]{.underline}. When Xi called on [Vladimir Putin]{.underline}
at the Moscow summit in March 2023, he [expressed confidence that their
"no limits" partnership was driving a change in the international
system]{.underline} "that hasn't happened in 100 years."21 Xi sees Putin
and himself in a "[back-to-back" struggle]{.underline} on the Eurasian
landmass [to topple the US liberal order and usher in a seismic
transformation]{.underline}.22 He has there- fore [urged Putin to press
ahead with Russia's brutal war in Ukraine to fatally weaken America's
forward position in Europe]{.underline}. The Chinese leader treats that
conflict as a historic opportunity to split Washing- ton from NATO even
as he moves to [undermine the US alliance system in the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline}. Xi's strategic intent is to gain mastery over
Eurasia by breaking America's far-flung alliances.23 China's geography,
however, complicates Xi's grand design. The CCP faces a historic
predicament that doomed previous continental bids to overthrow the
international order. Analogous to Napoleonic France in the 19th century
and Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union in the 20th, Xi considers China
to be hemmed in by hostile littoral powers backed by a globe-trotting
maritime patron. And much like his continental forerunners, he believes
[China must dis- solve this suffocating seaward barrier before vying for
primacy in Eurasia and beyond. Xi's challenge]{.underline}, then, is to
**[remake Eurasia with- out provoking a cataclysmic war]{.underline}**
or a stifling mari- time cordon. Put simply, he must avoid rerunning the
same continental script that led France, Germany, and Soviet Russia to
national ruin. Classical geopolitical theorists would have rec- ognized
Xi's dilemma.24 China bestrides a swath of what Alfred Thayer Mahan and
Nicholas Spykman--- American strategists writing in the first half of
the 20th century---respectively dubbed the "debat- able zone" and
"rimland": a vast arc on the Eurasian periphery where continental and
maritime powers collide.25 Both called for an Anglo-American-led rim-
land alliance against continental threats---be it Czar- ist Russia and
Imperial Germany for Mahan or Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan for
Spykman.26 They shared British geographer Halford Mackinder's fear that
if a hostile power or combination of powers dominated the Eurasian
"World-Island," the bulk of the world's industrial and military
potential could be arrayed against the democratic West.27 Still, Mahan
and Spykman found some comfort in the dismal success rate of continental
revisionists like Napoleonic France. And, if they had witnessed Nazi
Germany's and Imperial Japan's defeat in World War II, or the Soviets'
slow disintegration in the Cold War, their confidence in a rimland
defense would have grown.28 For Chinese strategists, who are keen
students of Mahan and the Soviet collapse,29 the disasters that befell
their continental antecedents are instruc- tive.30 The authoritarian
revisionists of the 19th and 20th centuries all failed to resolve
threats on their seaward flanks. And they ultimately suffered for it,
whether by igniting disastrous hot wars (as did France, Germany, and
Japan) or a suffocating cold war (as did the Soviets). Neither
Napoleonic France nor Germany was naturally inclined to the sea.
Napoleon fell victim to a rimland coalition led by his era's mightiest
sea power, Great Britain. As for Germany, its back-to- back bids for
Eurasian primacy were both foiled by an Anglo-American consortium that
partnered with land powers such as France in the First World War and
Soviet Russia in the Second.31 Though more nautically disposed, Imperial
Japan failed to rec- oncile the continental-maritime divide, thereby
condemning itself to a catastrophic two-front war against Chinese armies
on the Asian mainland and American expeditionary forces at sea.32 And,
in the Cold War, the Soviet Union vainly attempted a naval
transformation even as it fractured under the weight of a US-led rimland
barrier that spanned the Eurasian periphery.33 To date, then, ancient
Persia and Rome are the only land-dominant pow- ers that have
successfully augmented the founda- tion of their military might with any
sort of lasting maritime transformation.34 To be sure, geography is not
destiny. Beijing, though, recognizes how the spatial dimension shapes
its options. A careful student of history, the [CCP has determined that
before transforming Eurasia into a Sino-centric supercontinent, it must
first consoli- date an exposed seaboard.]{.underline} And to alleviate
the con- tinental isolation that condemned its revisionist forerunners,
Beijing is exploiting a loose autocratic axis---featuring Russia, Iran,
and North Korea35--- to eject Washington from its neighborhood and lock
down a China-dominated "Asia for Asians."36 Thus, given that [China's
existing military capacity confines the bulk of its striking power to
the western Pacific, the Asia-Pacific rimland represents the cen- tral
region in **Beijing's struggle for global primacy**. Whether the CCP
rewrites the continental script will hinge on its ability to break the
US alliance system on its maritime periphery without exhausting itself
in a great-power war that takes it to the **nuclear
brink**.]{.underline}

### L -- Military Power

#### US asserting its military power only makes Chinese escalation inevitable---goes nuclear

**Zhao 24** \[Tong; Senior Fellow, Carnegie China, Nuclear Policy
Program; "POLITICAL DRIVERS OF CHINA\'S CHANGING NUCLEAR POLICY;"

lileto

The power politics mindset drives a strong internal sentiment that it is
[imperative for China to **prioritize development of its strategic
military power** instead of considering restraint.]{.underline} In this
view, Beijing attributes the [source of instability solely to perceived
**U.S. aggression**]{.underline} and believes that its [own military
capability development is inherently stabilizing.]{.underline} While
Beijing has been publicly denying its nuclear buildup to deflect
international pressure and buy time, it is confident that its rivals,
particularly the United States, will detect its [rapid growth in
strategic capabilities through national intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance capabilities and that this will lead to more
accommodating approaches in U.S. policy toward China.]{.underline}

Beijing does not consider its growing power politics mindset a problem,
because it blames the [United States' "hegemonic" behaviors]{.underline}
for [making Beijing adopt this viewpoint]{.underline} even though this
does not reflect China's preferred worldview and moral principles. This
line of thought suggests that the [U.S. obsession with and reliance on
brute power means that China,]{.underline} in response, [must focus on
building its own material power to **compel the United States into
accepting peaceful coexistence**.]{.underline} The deepening [sense of
existential threats]{.underline} and the development of a fatalistic
concern that a narrowing gap in power will [lead to an eventual showdown
between Beijing and Washington]{.underline} have [contributed to China's
perceived need to]{.underline} take quick, radical countermeasures,
including **[accelerating its nuclear expansion.]{.underline}**

### L- Climate Leadership

#### Trump's war on clean energy means that Chinese leadership can and will [revolutionize]{.underline} the clean energy transition.

#### Chinese leadership can [only]{.underline} thrive if there's a "[vacuum]{.underline}" from US climate inaction. 

**Murtaugh** 11-7-20**24**, political columnist @ Bloomberg (Dan,
"Trump's Return Gives China a Second Chance at Climate Leadership:
Beijing's green-energy boom leaves it well-placed to step into the
vacuum Washington may create," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-07/trump-s-return-gives-china-a-second-chance-at-climate-leadership?srnd=phx-economics-v2)

Donald [[Trump's victory]{.underline}]{.mark} in this week's US election
comes with plenty of risks for China. But it also [[hands Beijing a rare
opportunity]{.underline}]{.mark}. The president-elect's climate
credentials are known. He immediately pulled out of the Paris Agreement
after being inaugurated in 2017. He vows to boost fossil-fuel production
and terminate domestic green policies he labels a "scam." [This should
be Xi Jinping's cue]{.underline}. [[Last time, China's efforts]{.mark}
to play up global expertise]{.underline}, work with Europe and Canada,
and bolster its emission-reduction targets largely [[came to
nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather than being hailed as a leader,
Beijing was accused of not doing enough to curb fossil fuels. **[But
[fast forward to 2025, and China is in a much better position to take
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Since the start of 2023, the nation
installed 493 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity --- about as much as
France, Germany and the UK combined. The massive amounts of new clean
energy put it on the cusp of peak emissions nearly a half-decade before
the target. [China i**s** still the biggest greenhouse gas emitter, and
the most important thing it can do for the climate fight is to keep
cleaning up. But the scale of the domestic market makes those transition
efforts largely self-reliant and **immune** from Washington's
vacillations]{.underline}. [The country's solar, battery and
**e**lectric-**v**ehicle companies currently dominate global
production]{.underline}. They made clean technologies affordable, though
they also resulted in **[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}** being pilloried
for undermining other countries' supply chains. [These manufacturers
**[can]{.mark}**]{.underline} still [[help speed up the switch to
renewable power, **especially in the Global
South**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Many are already doing their part,
investing in overseas factories to skirt tariffs and localization rules.
**[[Trump's plans to drag the US from the climate stage will leave a
vacuum]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[China can step up]{.mark} its global
presence]{.underline}, help untangle knots such as finance ---
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [**[win]{.mark}** enough
**[trust]{.mark}** to keep trade barriers low and sell more solar panels
and wind turbines]{.underline}. A lackluster domestic economy should
only add to the incentive. [[Second chances are rare. There's every
reason to take advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### US climate retreat allows China to step in

**Dlouhy 24**, citing David Waskow, director of the World Resources
Institute's International Climate Initiative, Energy and environmental
policy reporter @ Bloomberg (Jennifer, "If **[Trump]{.underline}** Wins,
Climate Diplomats Are Ready to Bypass US Role Secret talks are preparing
to keep global cooperation alive under an adversarial US president. A

leadership over to China]{.underline}**," Bloomberg,
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-10-31/trump-s-possible-return-spurs-secret-talks-to-bypass-him-on-climate)

Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} has been clear that he [[plans
to]{.underline}]{.mark} lead another US [**[retreat from]{.underline}**
**[global climate diplomacy]{.underline}**]{.mark} if he wins a second
term in the White House, vowing to once again abandon the landmark Paris
Agreement that he calls "horrendously unfair." Environmentalists,
[[government]{.mark} official**[s]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} former
[diplomats are]{.mark}]{.underline} already **[bracing]{.underline}**
for the possibility and [[plotting ways to Trump-proof global
cooperation on climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}. A series of
conversations, [[crisis simulations and political wargaming have spanned
the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}, described by people familiar with the
sessions as **[[galvanized by a desire to maximize climate
progress]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- even **[[with an adversarial US
president]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "These discussions are an example of
[[global leaders having learned]{.underline}]{.mark} a lesson [[from
their first experience with]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Jake Schmidt, senior adviser to
the NRDC Action Fund, an environmental group. "Other countries that
[[are working hard on climate]{.underline}]{.mark} will not be burned
again by an administration acting on behalf of fossil fuels interests."
[A **[US exodus]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- or even the post-election
prospect of one --- [would trigger a wave of consequences]{.underline},
[inevitably altering]{.underline} the nature of annual United Nations
[climate negotiations]{.underline} and rippling through the system in
sometimes unpredictable ways. [The departure of the world's
second-biggest greenhouse gas emitter]{.underline} could provide
leverage and political cover for laggard countries to stall new climate
action. At the same time, it [[could create an opening for
China]{.underline}]{.mark}, the world's top polluter, [[to **step up**
and claim the mantle of climate leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[**[It
would put China]{.mark}**]{.underline} even more **[[at the
center]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said David Waskow, director of the World
Resources Institute's International Climate Initiative. [[The US would
be]{.mark} effectively "[leaving other countries space to do
more]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Scientific Research The three warfares strategies are the most subtle in
the realm of scientific research, [[by **maintaining China's presence**
in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} region through expeditions, facilities,
and collaboration with Arctic states, Beijing slowly [develops
positive]{.mark} psychological and [public opinion]{.mark} effects
inside and outside the region [to set]{.mark} the [conditions for legal
participation]{.mark} in the geopolitical arena and **[support China's
long-term strategic objectives]{.mark}** in the Arctic. Public opinion,
legal, and psychological aspects of the three warfares strategy have
been shaped by mostly contemporary Arctic-related
developments.]{.underline} In 1993, China purchased an icebreaker from
Ukraine, upgraded the vessel for polar conditions, and named it the Xue
Long, translated as the Snow Dragon.31 In 1999, China launched its first
national scientific research expedition to the Arctic into the Bering
and Chukchi Seas. In 2019, a second polar-capable icebreaker, the
domestically built Xue Long 2, entered into service, and China is
reportedly planning to build a third polar-capable icebreaker.32 Since
1999, the Chinese National Arctic Research Expeditions (CHINARE) have
conducted 12 expeditions into the Arctic, with the Xue Long and Xue Long
2 as the primary research vessels. In 2004, China built its first Arctic
research center, the Yellow River Station, in Ny-Ålesund, Norway. Since
2004, China has built a satellite ground receiving station in Kiruna,
Sweden, in 2010; a second remote-sensing satellite ground station near
Kiruna in 2016; and the China--Iceland Arctic Science Observatory
station in Kárhóll, Iceland, in 2018. Additionally, China unsuccessfully
pursued scientific research stations in Canada and Greenland. [China's
[scientific development]{.mark} interests invest heavily in bilateral
and multilateral cooperation, focusing significantly in forums that
allow for non-Arctic state participation, that can **[bolster China's
image]{.mark}** as an extraregional Arctic power protecting the common
interest, [raise its environmental profile]{.mark}, and **[legitimatize
its participation]{.mark}** in the Arctic governance
regimes.]{.underline}33 [Public sentiment and academic commentary within

technological power]{.mark} that [must play an active]{.mark},
preemptive, and vigilant [role in exploration]{.mark}, exploitation,
[development]{.mark}, and governance [in Arctic]{.mark}
affairs.]{.underline}34 China's science diplomacy is an example of
psychological and public opinion warfare setting conditions for future
operations in the Arctic with legal effects enabling legitimization for
those future operations. [Through scientific exploration and
cooperation, [Beijing can **conduct influence**]{.mark} operations
utilizing its scientific expedition platforms and research facilities
[to normalize China's presence in the Arctic]{.mark}, to gain acceptance
or indifference from Arctic states to its presence in the region, and to
solidify the PRC's self-narratives as an important stakeholder and
near-Arctic state.]{.underline}35 Gaining increased access into the
Arctic for scientific purposes remains an important regime endeavor and
facilitates other access goals. However, China also knows how to
establish its own access and influence. The opening of the China--Nordic
Arctic Research Center (CNARC) in Shanghai is an excellent example. This
institute allows China to attract international participation while
having significant control over agendas and interests. The organization
also helps to strategically improve China's legitimacy and need to be an
Arctic governance actor. Public opinion warfare is relatively straight
forward. [Negative climate-change impacts on China allow Beijing to
pursue scientific access with almost default Chinese social acceptance
and support as a natural expectation.]{.underline} As a result,
psychological and legal warfare are areas where China might maintain
more focus and resourcing.

Over the last two decades, [China]{.underline} has significantly
[expanded its polar **agenda** and **activities**]{.underline}. It is a
[**long-term [strategic priority]{.mark}** [for China to establish
itself as]{.mark} a]{.underline} legitimate and [influential [**polar**
**stakeholder**]{.mark} with a permanent presence]{.underline} and
access to conduct various activities **[[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Antarctic. In Chinese strategic
considerations and plans, the polar regions, together with the deep
seabed and outer space, are [categorized as]{.underline} "[strategic
spaces]{.underline}" \[zhanlüe kongjian\] or "**[[new strategic
frontiers]{.underline}]{.mark}**" \[zhanlüe xinjiang yu\].1

China's growing emphasis on ensuring itself an advantageous position in
regulating and controlling access to these new strategic frontiers is
often viewed as stemming from an expectation that these domains will be
important for great-power struggles over critical resources and
geopolitical influence.2 This is undoubtedly a key part of China's
motivation. However, [there is]{.underline} also [a]{.underline}
[[**strong link between** China's efforts to ensure its "**polar
stakeholder**" position and achieve its "**global scientific power"
ambition**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beijing sees [these new strategic
frontiers]{.underline} as challenging areas in which to operate,
resulting in [constant pressure on **Chinese**]{.underline}
**[researchers]{.underline}**, engineers, and other experts [to advance
their knowledge and improve their **technological
capabilities.**]{.underline}

The ability to conduct [[Chinese **research
expeditions**]{.underline}]{.mark} and other activities [[in]{.mark} the
**[polar regions]{.mark}**]{.underline} is therefore also [valued as a
way to promote and **[raise]{.mark}** the **[overall]{.mark} level of
[innovation and technology in China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which
constitutes [a **key priority**]{.mark} in the national development
strategy]{.underline} for restructuring and upgrading its economic
model.3 The [knowledge and technology]{.underline} developed have
[**parallel civilian and military uses**---**[dual-use]{.mark}
application**---and therefore also [play into Beijing's
**"military-civilian fusion**"]{.mark} strategy and the [**strategic
priority** of]{.mark} [developing]{.mark} a **[world-class
military]{.mark}**]{.underline}.4 Such links between the domestic
economic agenda and the polar regions have contributed to the continued
emphasis on expanding China's polar capacity and activities in key
policy documents, despite the significant setbacks that Beijing has
experienced, especially in the Arctic, in recent years.5

China's polar engagement has come a long way since it took off in the
mid-1980s in the Antarctic and the mid-1990s in the Arctic, driven
primarily by an ambition to build Chinese polar research capacity.6
Initially, it was led by individual researchers and research
institutions under the guidance of the State Oceanic Administration,
which was established in 1964 under the Ministry of Natural Resources
with the overall aim to "engage China in polar expeditions in the
future."7 This indicates that already at an early stage there was an
expectation in China that ensuring access to the polar regions was
important.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Chinese polar activities gradually became
more centrally administrated and controlled. In 1989 the Polar Research
Institute of China (PRIC) was founded to support scientific polar
research, administer the polar research facilities, and provide logistic
support for polar expeditions, with the first Chinese icebreaker Snow
Dragon 1 arriving from Ukraine in the mid-1990s. China has been most
active in the Antarctic. It established its first research station there
in 1984 and conducted regular research expeditions throughout the 1990s.
Today, China has four research stations in the Antarctic, and in April
2023 it restarted construction on a fifth during its 39th Antarctic
expedition.8 It was only in 1999 that China conducted its first research
expedition in the Arctic. By June 2023, however, it had conducted twelve
Arctic expeditions. Regarding Arctic research facilities, China has had
the Yellow River Station on Svalbard since 2004 and a smaller research
facility in Iceland since 2018. In addition, it has several satellite
receiver stations in the Antarctic and one in the Arctic in Kiruna,
Sweden. These stations play a critical role in the Chinese BeiDou
navigation satellite system.9

The research expeditions and facilities that [[China]{.mark} has set up
point to a gradually **[expanding]{.mark}** and **increasingly
[ambitious polar research agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially in
the Antarctic but also [[in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. By all
estimates, China today has significant polar research capabilities and
competencies. In 2019, it added Snow Dragon 2, which is China's first
domestically built icebreaker. The vessel is a result of cooperation
with a world-leading Finnish company and is equipped with cutting-edge
oceanographic [[**surveying** and **monitoring**
**apparatus**]{.underline}]{.mark}, allowing for advanced
[[research]{.mark} in polar]{.underline} oceanography,
[[biod]{.mark}iversity]{.underline}, and [atmospheric and [environmental
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 A third Chinese nuclear-powered
icebreaker is under construction.11

Through an examination of the post-expedition reports from Chinese
researchers, it becomes clear that [China]{.underline} today [conducts
[**cutting-edge** **experiments**]{.mark} and **probes** on its polar
expeditions]{.underline}. For instance, during its ninth Arctic
expedition in 2018, Chinese researchers deployed unmanned observational
equipment such as an indigenously produced autonomous underwater glider
for deep-sea observation. Activities such as these have [[**greatly
enhanced** China's ability to **observe** and **monitor** the **Arctic
environment**]{.underline}]{.mark}**.**12 Chinese polar research still
centers on gaining a better understanding of the changing polar climate
and ice conditions in order to better predict and prepare for the
implications of climate change as well as to establish China as a
valuable polar partner. This is what is often termed "science
diplomacy," where non-polar states seek to use research activities to
legitimize and strengthen their polar presence and establish networks.13
Nevertheless, the [content and focus of [China's]{.mark} [polar]{.mark}
research [agenda]{.mark} have been gradually **[changing]{.mark}** and
**broadening** in the last decade]{.underline}. This is especially the
case in recent years. The domestic [focus on [establishing China as a
**leading power** in **innovative new tech**]{.mark}**nologies** has
been further emphasized [as]{.mark} the **[great]{.mark}-[power
competition]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has [intensified]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Similar to the
United States, China has prioritized reducing its dependencies and thus
increasing its self-reliance, especially in critical resources and key
technologies.14

As highlighted above, China sees its presence and influence in the polar
regions as essential to provide access to critical resources, such as
oil, gas, and rare earth minerals. These resources are abundant in the
polar regions and are now becoming more accessible. Furthermore, China
possesses one of the world's largest distant-water fishing fleets and is
increasingly interested in ensuring access to new fishing grounds. This
relates to the more specific Chinese emphasis on securing favorable
access to Arctic sea routes. Besides their importance for extracting
Arctic resources, these routes are considered attractive alternatives to
the longer and strategically vulnerable routes through the Strait of
Malacca and the Suez Canal. A significant portion of China's maritime
trade passes through the Malacca Strait. Already back in 2003, then
president Hu Jintao coined the term "Malacca dilemma" \[Maliujia
kunjing\] to highlight how China's dependence on this critical
entry-exit point for upholding its economy, and hence security, creates
vulnerabilities that need to be mitigated.15 Chinese concerns about this
dependence and potential alternative routes have only increased since
then, as China's relations with the United States and several of its
Southeast Asian neighbors have deteriorated.

The Transpolar Sea Route cutting straight across the North Pole seems to
attract the most Chinese attention.16 It is the shortest of the three
Arctic sea routes, but it is especially attractive from the Chinese
perspective because unlike the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest
Passage it runs mostly through international waters, where all states
have freedom of navigation. Chinese ships would thus not have to follow
the specific regulations of the relevant Arctic state, most
significantly Russia in relation to the Northern Sea Route.

More generally, [[China]{.mark} has emphasized [polar engagement]{.mark}
as a means to [advance]{.mark} its **[overall]{.mark}** **level of
[innovation and technology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Made in China
2025 strategy identifies [key]{.underline} [sectors or industries such
as [**robotics**, **space tech**]{.mark}**nology,**
**[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**, the next generation of
**[communication]{.mark}** and **[info]{.mark}rmation**
[tech]{.mark}nology, and **maritime** **technology** and
**capabilities**]{.underline}. Within these sectors or industries,
[**[China aims to take the lead]{.mark}**]{.underline} by setting global
standards [through targeted investments, acquisitions, and research and
development.]{.underline}17 This is also one of the main drivers behind
the [[Belt and Road]{.mark} Initiative]{.underline}, which since June
2017 has [[included]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**Arctic** **sea
routes**]{.mark} [under]{.mark} the heading "**[Polar Silk
Road]{.mark}**]{.underline}."18 Consequently, the [expanding polar
engagement]{.underline} also [[reflects Beijing's ambition]{.mark} to
play a [key]{.mark} role [in]{.mark} **negotiating** and
**[deciding]{.mark}** on **[global]{.mark} standards**, [rules]{.mark},
and regulations]{.underline}. This is especially a Chinese priority in
relation to these new strategic frontiers that are still rather
unexplored and unregulated spaces. In other spaces, China sees itself as
a latecomer and thus as disadvantaged. [Through the [**leadership**
of]{.mark} the **[new strategic frontiers]{.mark}** there is an
[opportunity for China]{.mark} [to]{.mark} be involved from the
beginning and]{.underline} even **[[take a dominating
role]{.underline}]{.mark}**.19

In sum, it is evident that there is a [significant polar
dimension]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the [key Chinese
strategies]{.underline} published in the recent decade, [[linking
**China's polar engagement** with its **long-term ambitions** and
**vision**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In recent years, Beijing has experienced significant setbacks in its
effort to establish itself as a legitimate and influential polar
stakeholder. China's strategy has been to knit itself into the polar
regions on multiple levels, through bilateral and multilateral
agreements and engagements within research, infrastructure, and resource
extraction. This has especially been the case in the Arctic. However,
the overall growing concerns in both the United States and Europe about
the intentions of a stronger and more assertive China have made the
Western Arctic states considerably reluctant to engage with China.20
Chinese activities have come under scrutiny in the Antarctic as well.21

[Beijing's unwillingness to distance itself from Russia]{.underline}
following the country's full-blown invasion of Ukraine in February 2022
further complicates China's polar engagement by increasing the overall
level of suspicion and wariness among Western states. On the other hand,
it also [[opens **new opportunities** for China to challenge the
**weakened polar governance** **regimes**]{.underline}]{.mark} as well
as [to [take advantage of]{.mark} a [weakened Russia]{.mark} that is
more dependent on China]{.underline}.22 [China]{.underline} potentially
now [has more room to [promote]{.mark} its long-standing [argument
about]{.mark} the [**ineffectiveness** and]{.mark} **indeterminateness**
of]{.underline} the [[existing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[institutional]{.mark}]{.underline} and legal [[architecture]{.mark} in
the polar regions.]{.underline}

#### Access to the NSR is key to Chinese geopolitical power

[[China has expressed a strong interest in the NSR]{.underline},]{.mark}
[[which offers a significantly shorter route between Asia and
Europe]{.mark} than the Suez Canal. [The NSR is a **key
component**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of China's]{.underline}]{.mark}
ambitious [[Polar Silk Road]{.underline},]{.mark} which seeks to connect
Asia and Europe while strengthening global trade. [[Gaining influence
over this]{.mark} crucial shipping route [would]{.mark} provide
substantial economic benefits and **[increase China's geopolitical
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To secure its position in the Arctic,
[China has proposed investments in Arctic and near-Arctic port
facilities]{.underline} like Arkhangelsk, Russia, as well as
transportation infrastructure such as Russia's Arctic Express No. 1, and
nuclear and non-nuclear icebreaker technology. While [[these
projects]{.underline}]{.mark} face scrutiny and resistance from some
Arctic states, they [[underscore China's strategic intent to establish a
foothold in this emerging maritime corridor]{.underline}]{.mark} and
could also enable it to project naval power in the Arctic while securing
vital trade routes.

### At: Not Zero Sum

#### Soft power is zero sum

wtk

[This is]{.underline}, of course, just the latest in [a deliberate
effort to disarm America's soft power]{.underline} capabilities and
sabotage its image abroad. Russia, China, and Iran are engaged in a
massive international effort to make the world safe for autocracy, and
the United States just decided to disband its most effective forces
against this endeavor. With the destruction of USAID, and the Congress'
refusal to stand up for the budget that it previously approved to
support its vital mission, [[it's as if China had succeeded in
convincing the U.S.]{.mark} government [to]{.mark} [surrender]{.mark}
all its best tools for commanding respect, goodwill, and
[influence]{.mark} abroad.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [[China continues
to]{.mark} seed and [cultivate its own influence through the]{.mark}
[Belt and Road]{.mark}, all while America looks the other
way.]{.underline}

America's soft power is what makes it different from its adversaries.
Rather than coercing, cajoling, and corrupting countries around the
world, American foreign policy should be based on attracting, asking,
and advising. The United States should attract because there is inherent
good and value in our system and working with the United States is
preferable to falling prey to authoritarian interests. Asking (not
telling) signals respect to those our country wishes to influence---by
listening and demonstrating that the U.S. genuinely values them as
partners, we create lower-risk environments that build life-long trade
and security relationships. By advising, we offer our own expertise to
improving quality of life and governance abroad, instilling American
values to create partnerships that ultimately make the world a safer and
more secure place. The alternative is infinitely more expensive and
deadly---just ask Russia.

As our country engages in the rapid unscheduled disassembly of its own
institutions with a mix of glee, apathy, and horror, critics of the old
status quo will state that these organizations were full of waste,
fraud, and abuse. Most Americans agree that it is absolutely worth
analyzing these organizations for effectiveness and efficiency.
Unfortunately, [[the current approach]{.mark} by the
administration]{.underline} and DOGE [[appears hell-bent
on]{.underline}]{.mark} throwing out all the good with the bad,
completely [[disregarding]{.mark} the measurable
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline} and impact these [agencies have had in
benefiting the United States and its foreign policy
objectives]{.underline}. While no organization is perfect, and certainly
examples of misused funding are documented, that's when you hire trained
professionals to help improve the organization instead of committing
arson.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, Russia, and Iran [[will]{.underline}
**[undoubtedly seize the opportunity to fill the
vacuum]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and our lawmakers should be appalled by
the speed at which the United States is actively dismantling its most
historically effective means of establishing goodwill abroad and respect
for the United States. They should stand up for these proud institutions
of American soft power, but instead the champagne is flowing in Moscow,
Beijing, and Tehran. The question is, why is America pouring the drinks?

### I/L -- Arctic Coop

#### China will keep its promises and wants to build relationships with Nordic countries -- the US does the opposite

Chen **Peiqing &** Guo **Huiwen '23** -- Writers at the Arctic Institute

Countries," The Arctic Institute, 6/20/2023,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/chinese-perspective-arctic-implication-nordic-countries/) -
**DF**

To [[achieve mutual development through win-win cooperation is]{.mark}
the first [aim of Chinese Arctic policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. China and
the Nordic countries are highly complementary in terms of economic
structure. China is an [important manufacturing country with strong
infrastructure capacity and is the world's largest consumer
market]{.underline}. As for the Nordic countries, the pillar industries
are animal husbandry, fisheries, shipping, resource extraction,
high-tech manufacturing, and tourism. [[China and Nordic]{.mark}
countries are [complementary in]{.mark} the [international
industri]{.mark}al [and supply chains]{.mark} and there is [no
competition]{.mark}.]{.underline} In China's Arctic Policy published in
2018[, China systematically elaborates the objectives, principles and
policy propositions of China's participation in Arctic
affairs]{.underline}. [Cooperation and [mutual
benefits]{.mark}]{.underline} are the basic position of China. [Unlike
the [U.S. dichotomy of "friend or foe]{.mark}" and the [confrontational
mindset of]{.mark} ["lose or win,"]{.mark} [China]{.mark} bases its
policy on its long-history of Confucian culture and peace-harmony gene
and [does not force Nordic countries to take sides]{.mark} between China
and the United States, but advocates the concept of "making friends with
the world" and aims for win-win results]{.underline}.^4)^ China
advocates solidarity, mutual assistance and sharing the same boat, likes
[working together with other countries on Arctic climate, scientific
research and trade issues, and hopes to extend China's concept of
"community with a shared future for mankind" to the Arctic
region]{.underline}. Secondly, [[China will keep its promises]{.mark}
when it deals with Nordic states]{.underline}. Keeping promises is one
of China's important Arctic values. [Keeping promises [matters
for]{.mark} China's international [reputation and soft
power]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the [U.S. has more advantages over China
in competition with the Nordic countries through its strong military,
economic influence and shared values related to political and economic
culture with the Nordic states]{.underline}. Therefore, keeping promises
is highly important for China as a new entrant that wants to carry out
practical cooperation with the Nordic countries. [[China can't
afford]{.mark} the price of [breaking]{.mark} its words in the
[China-Nordic relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a newcomer to the
Arctic, China looks forward to constructing a positive international
image and making progress to win the trust of the Nordic countries.
Examining world history and contemporary international politics, it is
clear that the [[U.S. is less committed to keeping]{.mark} its
[promises]{.mark} than China, and that the [U.S. does not care about
weaker nations]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the other hand, the Chinese
Confucian culture advocates "words must be kept and deeds must be done",
that is, to speak with credit and to do things with results. [Keeping
promises is deeply rooted in Chinese culture. Unlike the utilitarian and
capitalist national values of the United States, the Chinese cultural
tradition of not making promises lightly and striving to deliver on
promises has helped China to bring [more predictable benefits to the
Nordic countries in cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### I/L -- Softpower K2 CCP Legitimacy

#### Softpower success is key to [regime legitimacy]{.underline}. 

**Edney 15**, Lecturer in Politics and International Relations of China
in the School of Politics and International Studies at the University of
Leeds. (Kingsley, "Building National Cohesion and Domestic Legitimacy: A
Regime Security Approach to Soft Power in China," *Politics*, 25.3-4)

The need to overcome the security dilemma by reducing the fear its rise
provokes in others is one of China\'s most complex national security
challenges and the most widely cited reason for the country wanting to
increase its soft power. According to Li (2009, p. 31), [[soft power
is]{.mark} 'primarily [utilized to refute the "China threat"]{.mark}
thesis]{.underline}, facilitate a better understanding of China\'s
domestic socio-economic reality, [[and persuade]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
outside [world to]{.mark} accept and [support China\'s
rise']{.mark}]{.underline}. Deng (2009, p. 64) argues that [in
China]{.underline} the concept of **[[soft power]{.underline}]{.mark}**
'to a large extent, [**[means]{.mark}** the ability to influence others
in world politics with the goal of achieving **[great power
status]{.mark}** [without sparking]{.mark} fully fledged traditional
power politics of hostile [balancing or war]{.mark}'.]{.underline} In
his analysis of the concept\'s role in China\'s rise, [Ding]{.underline}
(2010, p. 266) [argues that the country\'s soft power strategy is one of
reassurance that helps 'to deal with foreign challenges and create a
friendly international environment']{.underline}. Rawnsley (2012, p.
126) notes that China\'s soft power strategy has been prompted by the
emergence of a 'China threat' discourse in the West and therefore
China\'s soft power can be seen as 'not only reactive, but defensive'.
Nye also claims that its soft power strategy is intended 'to make its
hard power look less threatening to its neighbors' and that soft power
can help to reduce the effectiveness of regional coalitions that attempt
to balance against China (Nye, 2011, p. 23; 2013). This kind of national
security perspective helps explain why building soft power has become
such an important task for the CCP. But we need to consider the
possibility that [**domestic [concerns]{.mark}** [over **regime
security**]{.mark} are]{.underline} also [[driv]{.mark}ing [China\'s
soft power]{.mark} project.]{.underline} 'Regime security' generally
refers to 'the condition where governing elites are secure from violent
challenges to their rule' (Jackson, 2010, p. 187). In China\'s case,
however, the insecurity of the regime is generated by the possibility
not only of violent challenges, but also of 'peaceful evolution' (heping
yanbian), which is an extremely seriously concern for the CCP,
particularly following the 'color revolutions' that have occurred in
some post-Soviet states (see Shambaugh, 2008, pp. 88--89). The 'regime'
can be defined as 'the small state of persons who hold the highest
offices ... and/or are the elite that effectively command the machinery,
especially the coercive forces, of the state' (Job, 1992, p. 15). While
this article uses the term 'regime security' rather than 'state
security', it should be noted that there is often no clear dividing line
between the two within a 'state-embedded polity' (Gilley, 2006, p. 501)
such as China, where there is significant penetration of the state by
the CCP. Despite China\'s successes in dealing with many of the common
sources of insecurity for developing states, such as permeability by
external actors and susceptibility to armed conflict (see Ayoob, 1995,
p. 15), [two important sources of regime insecurity remain problematic
for the authorities: **lack of legitimacy and lack of national
cohesion**.]{.underline} For a political authority such as the CCP,
[legitimacy is determined by the degree to which it 'holds and exercises
political power with legality, justification and consent from the
standpoint of all of its citizens']{.underline} (Gilley, 2009, p. 11).
In other words, the use of power must proceed according to rules, these
rules are justified by widely shared beliefs and the actions of those in
subordinate positions provide evidence that they consent to the power
relationship (Beetham, 1991, p. 16). There has been a great deal of
elite discussion of party legitimacy in China, particularly since the
early 2000s; one study showed that 68 per cent of sampled Chinese
journal articles about legitimacy took the view that the CCP\'s
legitimacy was under threat, while 30 per cent claimed the party faced a
legitimacy crisis (Gilley and Holbig, 2009, p. 343). A more recent study
found that Chinese intellectuals are more pessimistic about regime
legitimacy in China than their Western counterparts (Zeng, 2014). For
the purpose of this article it is not necessary to resolve the question
of whether or not the CCP currently faces a legitimacy crisis, however
-- only to show that [the potential for the party-state to lose its
legitimacy is a serious source of insecurity.]{.underline} The Fourth
Plenum of the 18th Central Committee, held in October 2014, provides
clear evidence that senior party officials are highly concerned about
the legality of CCP power. The Plenum\'s major focus was the need for
the party to 'rule according to the law' (yi fa zhi guo) and pointed out
that 'good law is a prerequisite for good governance' and that for the
party to rule according to the law it must first rule according to the
constitution (Xinhua, 2014). Responsibility for the justification of
party power falls on the Central Propaganda Department, which utilizes a
comprehensive network of institutions to attempt to reproduce the
official discourse justifying CCP rule and suppress any rival discourses
that might challenge it (see Edney, 2014). Lack of consent is also a
problem that requires significant resources to overcome. According to
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in recent years the annual
number of major protests in China has exceeded 100,000 (Huang, 2012).
While all states use domestic force to some extent (see Buzan, 1983, p.
67), the huge investment of the Chinese authorities in the internal
security apparatus, which in recent years has exceeded even China\'s
military spending (Martina, 2014), demonstrates that the lack of consent
to CCP rule is widespread enough to be a cause for serious concern.
[[Soft power]{.mark} is primarily relevant to the
**[enhance]{.mark}**ment of [regime legitimacy]{.mark} where a
significant component of [the]{.mark} moral [justification]{.mark} for
maintaining the current system [is based on the regime\'s ability to
improve]{.mark} the **international [status]{.mark}** of the national
unit. [The]{.mark} international [increase in]{.mark} positive
attraction that is associated with a rise in [**soft power** makes it
easier]{.mark} for the regime [to convince]{.mark} its [citizens
of]{.mark} the truth of its claim that [the country\'s]{.mark}
international [status is improving under its
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}, where 'status' is defined not only in
terms of material capabilities, but also in terms of social recognition.
For the most part, [evidence of an increase in international recognition
and attraction]{.underline} could be [used to bolster claims that the
regime has successfully improved the country\'s international
status]{.underline}, regardless of whether soft power is a result of
attraction to political values, culture or foreign policies, or whether
it is generated by the policies of the regime or sources within broader
society. Some internationally attractive cultural products can also be
the work of dissidents or relate to aspects of culture or values that
the regime would rather suppress, however, and these sources of
attraction are difficult for the authorities to exploit. Chinese
political elites feel a keen sense of obligation to restore the
country\'s past great power status (Deng, 2008, pp. 8--9) and show its
people that China is globally respected and admired (Zhang, 2012, p.
620). The leadership attempts to appease domestic nationalist audiences
by gaining 'face' for China abroad (Gries, 2004, pp. 120--121) and the
party-state has often publicized statements of support or admiration
from foreign allies to demonstrate China\'s international status and
thereby bolster its moral claim to rule (e.g. Brady, 2003, p. 228). If
there is a broad-based growth in Chinese soft power, these statements
are likely to become more common and more credible as the number and
variety of foreign actors who are attracted to China increases.
Moreover, [[international attraction]{.mark} to China\'s success in
areas such as **economic development** **[expands]{.mark}** the number
of 'nodes' in networks of '**[legitimacy]{.mark}** belief', thereby
reducing the marginal cost of persuasion and **[squeezing out
alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline} discourse[**[s]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
might [challenge]{.mark} regime [legitimacy]{.mark}**
(]{.underline}Gerschewski, 2013, pp. 26--27). [This makes it easier for
the CCP to claim legitimacy based on its success in moving China toward
the shared goal of national 'rejuvenation'.]{.underline} Although
'national cohesion' is a concept that is rather nebulous and difficult
to assess, the regular references to 'cohesion' in official CCP
statements indicate that Chinese leaders are worried about it and seek
to improve it (e.g. CCP Central Committee, 2011; 2013). As China has
become a more plural society, generating social consensus (ningju
gongshi) and unifying the people (ningju renxin) have become serious
concerns for the propaganda authorities (Edney, 2014). According to
propaganda chief Liu Yunshan, achieving the 'China dream' of the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires cultural cohesion (Xinhua,
2013), while an early article on national cultural security published on
a CCP website argues that [[if a country lacks cohesion]{.mark} -- even
if it is strong in terms of other forms of power -- when it faces
challenges]{.underline} such as a natural disaster or foreign invasion
**[[it]{.mark} [will 'collapse at the first blow']{.mark}]{.underline}**
(bu kan yi ji) (Yang, 2006). A lack of national cohesion can be a
persistent problem for weak states that are unable to generate 'a
domestic political and social consensus of sufficient strength to
eliminate the large-scale use of force as a major and continuing element
in the domestic political life of the nation' (Buzan, 1983, p. 67).
Normally soft power refers to a country\'s attractiveness to foreign
constituencies. To consider the possibility that it could enhance
national cohesion, however, it is necessary to apply the concept to the
relationship between domestic constituencies. In this sense, the soft
power of the political, social and cultural core of the polity
encourages domestic interest groups and individuals on the margins to
want the same outcomes, such as stability and national cohesion, as the
authorities at the center. Although this might seem to be a major step
away from the traditional interpretation of soft power, Nye\'s (2011,
pp. 19--20) argument that soft power is a key requirement of an
effective counter-insurgency strategy and that dealing with the threat
of terrorism requires the soft power of an appealing narrative that can
win over mainstream society and prevent terrorists recruiting new
members to their groups, highlights the concept\'s potential
significance for state efforts to respond to domestic sources of
instability. In this case, [soft power involves enhancing regime
security by making it less likely that domestic adversaries who pose a
threat to national cohesion will be able to obtain material support from
the local population, which then makes it easier for the state to deal
with the security threat they pose. The authorities in Beijing face a
range of **threats to national cohesion** from peripheral regions,
including]{.underline} the ongoing problem of [terrorism and insurgent
attacks in Xinjiang]{.underline}, protests and discontent in Tibet,
pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and de facto independence in Taiwan.
In light of these challenges it would not be unreasonable for scholars,
or even the authorities, to interpret '**[[soft
power']{.underline}]{.mark}** as something that could also be applied to
[[improve regime security by enhancing the cohesion between the]{.mark}
political, social and cultural [core of the Chinese polity and those on
the margins]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, in more general terms, Wang
and Lu (2008, p. 427) have pointed out that Chinese interpretations of
soft power include 'the ability to generate compliance in a society by
moral example and persuasion'.

#### Soft power is key to defuse threats to CCP legitimacy -- unites different factions and strengthens core values

between Nationalism, Legitimacy and International Influence,"

As China's rapid economic development has continued, economic inequality
has widened between its rich coastal cities and the poor rural interior.
There is a risk that anger and frustration among the poor might turn to
hostility towards the authority and legitimacy of China's rulers. In
this context, [[Beijing]{.mark} wants to [use]{.mark} the elements of
Chinese **[soft power]{.mark}** [to promote national pride and]{.mark}
the [confidence]{.mark} of the whole population]{.underline}.
[Beijing]{.underline} also [wants to promote socialist thought [and to
unite the Chinese people]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in commitment to the CCP
and]{.mark} the **[P]{.mark}**eople's **[L]{.mark}**iberation

But [[China sees]{.mark} the improvement of cultural **[soft

[international influence']{.mark}**]{.underline}. He also argues that,
'[internally, [soft power can strengthen socialist core values, improve

thought and [morality, **and strengthen all-Party**]{.mark},
all-[military]{.mark}, [and all-people's

[[Governing regimes sustain]{.mark} political [legitimacy via]{.mark}
hard and [soft strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Because their citizens
often resent hard strategies]{.underline} like inculcating
regime-preferred values via formal education and state-controlled
propaganda, such [[regimes may engage in]{.mark}]{.underline}
alternative **[[legitimacy-boosting approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
By telling riveting stories, memorializing historical events, restoring
cultural heritage, ritualizing political behavior, and visiting
monuments, governing regimes may cultivate soft strategies that
selectively frame, highlight, and dispense political information
(Gorsuch, 2007; McCracken, 2005; Meladze, 2021; Qian, 2020). Mass media
often institutionalize these discursive efforts. Assigning values---such
as patriotism, anti-imperialism, national independence, national honor,
political loyalty, and social responsibility---to heritage sites
transforms them into meaning vehicles for creating collective identity,
politicized consumption, and a shared community (Fayard, 2022; Hartmann
& Su, 2021; Jung & Mittal, 2020; McCracken, 2005; Mirrlees, 2016;
Pretes, 2003; Zhang et al., 2018).

[[Soft strategies can enhance political legitimacy by allowing a
governing regime greater flexibility, persuasiveness, and courtesy in
ruling its citizenry]{.underline}]{.mark} (Edney, 2015; Nye, 2004,

(Hollinshead & Suleman, 2017).

## \[Impacts CPP Collapse\]

### CCP Collapse = Diversionary War

#### Losing legitimacy prompts Chinese aggression to maintain government image

**Carter '19** \[Erin Baggot Carter, 22 January 2019, Assistant
Professor at the University of Southern California, Hoover Fellow at
Hoover Institution, Author of Propaganda in Autocracies, "Diversionary
aggression in Chinese foreign policy,
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/diversionary-aggression-in-chinese-foreign-policy/,
EC\]

In 2018 Xi Jinping shattered longstanding norms within the regime's
inner circle. [In positioning himself to rule for life, [Xi created
enemies]{.mark} among the ruling elite,]{.underline} who were already
deeply displeased by his politically motivated anti-corruption campaign.
Xi now confronts profound threats from senior members of the elite. His
central task is to survive them. To do so, I argue, [[he will **craft a
foreign policy that embraces diversionary
aggression**]{.mark}.]{.underline} That is, [he will [**initiate
international conflicts** in order to]{.mark}]{.underline} build the
sort of public nationalism that [[make]{.mark}s [it difficult for elites
to challenge him]{.mark}.]{.underline} The result will be a more
aggressive, destabilizing, and unpredictable foreign policy. China's
"rise" is among the great challenges of the 21st century, in part
because China's domestic politics compel risky behavior on the
international stage. [Xi's [attempts to consolidate power]{.mark} have
[made diversionary foreign policy]{.mark} more
[likely]{.mark},]{.underline} but China's political system itself
incentivizes this behavior. Indeed, my research suggests that
diversionary aggression may account for as much as 40 percent of all
conflict that the Chinese government initiates with the United States.
It is critically important for U.S. policymakers to distinguish between
diversionary aggression, which evaporates with the resolution of China's
domestic tensions, and revisionist aggression, in which China seeks to
permanently reshape the strategic landscape in East Asia. [[For the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates,
[[responding]{.mark} to diversion as though it were revision **[risks
antagonizing China]{.mark}** precisely when Xi is trying to appear tough
on foreigners. [This]{.mark} risks [creat]{.mark}ing **[a spiral of
escalating conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Yet responding to revision
as though it were diversion also carries risk: allowing China to expand
its influence in East Asia unchecked. When does China employ
diversionary aggression? How can U.S. policymakers recognize it? And how
should Washington respond? Fortunately, China's diversionary aggression
emanates at specific moments and has key distinguishing features, which
I discuss below. Ultimately, the U.S. government should respond to
diversion with strategic restraint, and to revisionism with containment.
The reason Why would tensions between Xi Jinping and senior government
officials compel the Chinese government to initiate conflicts with the
United States? Understanding this requires understanding China's
domestic political struggles, which are competitive, factional, and
ubiquitous. Deng Xiaoping ousted Mao's successor in a bloodless coup in
1978. The Bo Xilai affair scandalized the regime in 2012. And today,
rumors of assassination attempts against senior leaders are common.
Accordingly, Chinese presidents take steps to insulate themselves from
the conspiracies of regime insiders. This is how China's diversionary
foreign policy should be understood. Scholars have long believed that
autocrats can employ popular support to inoculate themselves against
elite conspiracies. This dynamic was first observed by Machiavelli, who
wrote that "one of the most efficacious remedies that a prince can have
against conspiracies is not to be hated and despised by the people."
When a conspirator "can only look forward to offending them, he will not
have the courage to take such a course." Machiavelli's observation has
special implications for China, where the population is widely regarded
as nationalist. [[Citizens express]{.mark} high [support for the
government in international conflict scenarios]{.mark}.]{.underline} For
instance, when presented with a hypothetical dispute over the Diaoyu
Islands, Chinese survey respondents overwhelmingly support not only
Chinese defense of the islands against Japan, but even Chinese invasion
of the islands. [International crises enable leaders to showcase their
competence and cue an "us-versus-them" dynamic that fosters national
solidarity and, in turn, domestic support]{.underline}. Domestic support
protects Xi against dissatisfied elites, who recognize that toppling a
popular leader would invite a backlash. In short, diversionary
aggression is an investment. When elites are dissatisfied, Xi can employ
diversionary aggression to cue nationalism among Chinese citizens and so
inoculate himself from elite conspiracies. Diversionary aggression is an
investment. When elites are dissatisfied, Xi can employ diversionary
aggression to cue nationalism. Evidence How do we know that diversionary
aggression is a critical element of Chinese foreign policy? China's
unique political economy enables us to measure just how much of the
conflict that China initiates toward the United States is diversionary.
The Chinese regime is underpinned by an autocratic social contract: In
exchange for loyalty, elites expect the regime to compensate them. In
the early 1990s, Deng Xiaoping transformed China's emerging equity
markets into a massive patronage system. To reward loyal supporters,
Deng appointed them to senior positions at state-owned enterprises about
to go public. There, they could purchase ownership shares prior to the
IPO. Because initial share prices were dramatically undervalued, this
constituted a massive arbitrage opportunity. Since the 1990s, the
Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) has served primarily to reward elites.1 To
reassure them, Chinese leaders have repeatedly pledged to protect elite
investments in the stock market. In contrast, there is virtually no
connection between stock returns and public interests. In 2011, only 9
percent of Chinese households invested in the SSE. Strikingly, the SSE
has no relationship with growth, inflation, or unemployment, and so
there is no evidence that SSE shocks foster popular discontent. To
explore the relationship between elite welfare and China's foreign
policy more systematically, I created a day-level dataset of over 3,000
bilateral interactions between the United States and China from 1990 to
2010 by coding some 10,000 pages of primary and secondary historical
materials.2 Controlling for a range of features,3 I find that [[when the
SSE declines]{.underline}]{.mark} by 5 percent to 15 percent, [[the
Chinese government is **twice as likely** to initiate
disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} with the United States. This level of
volatility is extraordinarily common. It occurs in three of every 12
months. Two other features of China's diversionary aggression suggest
that its key objective is to cultivate public support. First, it is
routinely accompanied by propaganda that broadcasts to senior government
officials just how popular the regime is: how its chief aim is to
advance public welfare. The People's Daily is the regime's flagship
propaganda newspaper. Its principal function is to communicate regime
doctrine to elites. When the SSE declines, the People's Daily covers
"party-mass relations" (dangqun guanxi) much more positively. The size
of the difference is equivalent to the difference in how positively Fox
News covers Democrats versus Republicans. In short, when elite interests
suffer, the regime's propaganda apparatus informs elites that it is
widely supported by the public. Second, China reliably undertakes
diplomatic charm offensives after episodes of diversionary aggression.
For China, diversionary aggression is risky. The United States might
mistake it for a genuine attempt to revise the power balance in East
Asia and respond with containment policies. Accordingly, whenever China
employs diversionary aggression, it quadruples its diplomacy the
following month. Critically, this diplomacy is virtually always private,
since Chinese citizens might view more public forms of cooperation with
the United States as capitulation to the foreign adversary so recently
demonized. Newly released diplomatic cables provide a unique opportunity
to observe this process in action. Between January and July 2010, the
SSE lost one-third of its value. A range of evidence suggests that this
crisis profoundly shaped Chinese foreign policy towards the United
States. In March, U.S. policymakers were subjected to a "lengthy
presentation" on China's rights in the South China Sea, which were
described as a "national priority." Chinese propaganda reported that
bilateral relations were "strained" and "at a low point."
Simultaneously, the editor of the Global Times, the government's most
nationalist state-run newspaper, told U.S. Ambassador John Huntsman "not
to be concerned" because China's belligerence was "necessary to satisfy
the Chinese people." Huntsman reported to Washington that "over the
coming months, China would stomp around and carry a small stick." "This
attitude," he advised, "has more form than substance and is designed to
play to Chinese public opinion." In July 2010, the SSE stabilized, and
the economic interests of Chinese elites recovered. China quickly
backpedaled.4 Chinese officials accepted a longstanding offer for
President Hu to visit Washington, agreed to support a U.N. Security
Council statement condemning North Korea, reauthorized military
exchanges with the United States, said they had not authoritatively
called the South China Sea a "core interest," and told US officials they
were "willing to begin expert talks on a code of conduct in the South
China Sea." State Councilor Dai Bingguo even traveled to Pyongyang on a
secret mission on behalf of the United States to warn North Korea not to
respond to South Korean military exercises. China ensured that these
signals were correctly interpreted by American policymakers.
Organization Department Minister Li Yuanchao told National Security
Adviser Tom Donilon that China "would not challenge the United States
for global leadership" and that "there was no inevitable conflict in
their interests." China's private behavior during this period offers
additional clues that its aggression was diversionary rather than
revisionist. Despite headlines proclaiming that China was "incensed"
with American "containment," Beijing agreed to help with an Iran
resolution at the United Nations, on one condition: that it could keep
its assistance private. Why this matters In attempting to secure
near-dictatorial powers, Xi has created enemies among the Chinese elite.
[Financial [crises]{.mark} and political purges [create incentives for
elites to oppose Xi]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some will try to remove him.
[[To inoculate himself against their conspiracies, **Xi will employ
diversionary foreign policy**]{.mark} even more frequently]{.underline}
than past generations of Chinese leaders, [[for whom **such incentives
motivated 40 percent of conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} initiation with
the United States, my estimates suggest. For the U.S. government, of
course, this creates a dilemma. It is almost certainly better off
ignoring China's diversionary conflicts. As the cables above make clear,
the Chinese government has no interest in pursuing these crises beyond
saber-rattling, and so forbearance is ultimately relatively costless.
The risk, of course, is that the Chinese government will exploit U.S.
strategic restraint to genuinely expand its influence in East Asia.
Given this dilemma, what is the best strategy for the U.S. government?
To answer this question, U.S. policymakers must weigh the dangers of
false positives (misinterpreting Chinese revision as diversion) against
those of false negatives (misinterpreting Chinese diversion as
revision). The risk of a false positive is straightforward: By
exploiting U.S. strategic restraint, China wins an opportunity to revise
the power balance in East Asia. The risk of a false negative is that
[**[if the U.S. government mounts a containment response]{.mark}**
during a diversionary episode, [**it would antagonize China**,]{.mark}
and precisely when Xi aims to persuade citizens of his commitment to
China's vital security interests. Having already activated these
audience costs, [Xi would be forced to adopt **even more aggressive
policies**]{.mark}.]{.underline} These, of course, would further
convince the United States of China's revisionary aims. The result is a
classic, self-reinforcing security dilemma: conflict escalation that
neither side genuinely wanted. In this scenario, false negatives are far
more dangerous to U.S. interests than false positives. In past episodes
of diversionary conflict, China has always walked back its diversionary
claims after a few months. For example, China said the South China Sea
was not actually a "core interest," silenced typically loud demands
about Taiwan and Tibet, and advocated cooperation so much that U.S.
policymakers left meetings knowing the term (hezuo) in Chinese. Despite
its saber rattling, Beijing's diversion left no lasting imprint upon the
international order. Despite its saber rattling, Beijing's diversion
left no lasting imprint upon the international order. The U.S. policy
response should be based on the recognition that the power balance in
East Asia cannot be rewritten overnight. The U.S. government is acting
from a position of preponderant power. If Xi exploits America's
strategic restraint, Washington will be able to restore the status quo
ex ante in relatively short order. Moreover, if Xi does not withdraw his
diversionary claims after a domestic crisis passes, he will provide
important information about his true, revisionary goals. In contrast,
[[the security dilemma,]{.mark} once activated[, is difficult to
deescalate]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is far more threatening to U.S.
interests because it is difficult to rein in. Accordingly, some
willingness to tolerate an occasionally diversionary foreign policy is,
in my view, among the costs the United States must bear as the global
hegemon. Identifying diversionary aggression While pursuing this policy
of strategic restraint, the U.S. government should minimize the prospect
of mistaking diversion for revision, or vice versa. Fortunately, four
principles distinguish the two types of aggression: Diversionary
aggression only occurs amidst serious tensions between Xi and the ruling
elite. Absent such tensions, policymakers should view Chinese aggression
as revisionism, and respond accordingly. When aggressive foreign policy
is accompanied by a propaganda blitz that focuses on Xi's popularity, it
is more likely to be diversionary. [[To be diversionary]{.mark},
[Chinese aggression must be observable to citizens]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Private forms of aggression like aggressive aircraft tails, more
extensive military patrols, and submarine dogfights are more likely to
be genuine attempts to reshape the regional power balance. By contrast,
the U.S. government should recognize public posturing that plays well in
Chinese media---such as absurd statements by retired military officials,
protests at news conferences, or obstructionism at the United
Nations---for what it is: an inconvenience imposed by tensions among
China's ruling clique. Finally, the most important feature of
[[diversionary aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} is that it ceases as soon
as Xi's domestic crisis passes. It will be followed by sustained,
private diplomacy and may even occur simultaneously with cooperation on
issues that may be kept private, as with negotiations on Iran and North
Korea in 2010. If these initiatives do not materialize within a few
months, the U.S. government should treat Chinese aggression as the
destabilizing revisionism that it is. Though Washington may have lost
some ground in the meantime, it will be able to reverse Xi's short term
gains. Equally important, it [[will have]{.underline}]{.mark} avoided
the risk of **[[needless escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** and will have
learned valuable information about Xi's true intentions.

#### Reduced legitimacy causes the CCP to [embrace nationalism]{.underline}\-\--leads to war, draws in other major powers

**McKnight 15**, MA degree in international relations at the University
of San Diego, now a career naval aviator from the helicopter sea combat
(HSC) community. (Tyler, "Regime Legitimacy and the CCP,"
https://fliphtml5.com/vvok/jqha/Regime_Legitimacy_and_the_CCP/)

Perhaps [the most]{.underline} reasonable and [likely path the CCP will
pursue to]{.underline} **[[shore up]{.mark} its
[legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}[is by **[embracing
nationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is a lot for the Chinese to be
proud of these days. They are a country that has risen from the ashes of
the Cultural Revolution to become the second largest economy in the
world. Most of the people of China no longer live a life of subsistence,
but one of material wealth. Many Chinese can now afford things that were
once considered luxury items such as televisions and cars. China has
firmly established itself as an economic power. China is now not only
economically strong, but also politically and militarily strong on the
international stage. After many years of subjugation, exploitation, and
humiliation at the hands of foreign powers China is now a strong nation.
China is powerful enough now to defend its borders against any potential
threat. Increasingly, China is also able to flex its muscles beyond its
own borders and territorial waters as exemplified by China's recent
establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) over the
disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea. [China's ability
to **project power** is quickly catching up with]{.underline} potential
rivals such as [Japan and the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. The
use of nationalism to support regime legitimacy is not a new concept for
the CCP. Since the late 1970s the CCP have been cultivating nationalism
as a way to compensate for the weaknesses of communist ideology. After
the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and the "sanxin weiji" (three
spiritual crises) the CCP started using nationalism as a way to
establish a hegemonic order of political values and as a way to rally
popular support behind a less popular regime and its policies by
creating a sense of community. The CCP double downed on using
nationalism as a way to unite the country and reinforce its legitimacy
after the Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Nationalism
was viewed as a way to counter Western liberal ideas and calls for
democracy. As the CCP did after the protest of 1989 and continues to do
today, the party continues to sell itself as the protector of the
Chinese people against foreign aggression. If the CCP were to allow
weakness, disunity, and disorder at home it would open a Pandora's box.
Such chaos would weaken China and give foreign aggressors the chance to
reassert themselves. With China's history of foreign exploitation, such
an argument can carry a lot of weight in China. China is once again a
strong country and it does not want to fall back into a role of
subjugation.xxiii The problem with nationalism is it is a fickle beast.
[If the CCP were to **strongly embrace and [stoke nationalism, it would
be hard to contain]{.mark}**]{.underline} it. If [the CCP]{.underline}
were to define itself as the guardians of Chinese nationalism it [would
have to work]{.underline} hard [to ensure it appeases the concerns of
nationalist. China continues to have]{.underline} a number of
**[[festering territory disputes with]{.mark} its
neighbors:]{.underline}** the continued de facto independence of
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its border with [India, and the
Senkaku]{.underline}/Diaoyu [islands]{.underline} in the East China Sea
to name a few. With its history of foreign exploitation, China is
acutely sensitive to any territory dispute. [The CCP would have a very
**hard time maintaining**]{.underline} its [**nationalist credentials**
if it were to allow other countries to assert control over
any]{.underline} of the [disputed areas]{.underline}. The Chinese
leaders ran into this problem in the late 1990s when there was a
distinct rise in nationalism in China. The authors of the popular
[nationalist]{.underline} book The China That Can Say No were openly
critical of the Chinese government for taking a stance they viewed as
too soft towards the United States and Japan. They [endorsed taking
action to **[annex Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline} at any cost
[and]{.underline} **[open confrontation with Japan and
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. A
move such as this would at best be risky considering China was, and
still is, dependent on Japan and the United States to ensure its
continued economic growth.xxiv As a result of China's history of
humiliation and the CCP's need to strengthen its nationalist
credentials, [China is more likely than other countries to
**[use]{.mark}**]{.underline} strong-arm tactics or **[[force]{.mark} to
assert itself.]{.underline}** [Such moves are a double-edged
sword]{.underline} for the CCP. [They]{.underline} could [help the
CCP]{.underline} to [maintain]{.underline} its [credentials as the
guardians of the Chinese people]{.underline}, but this would be [at the
expense of]{.underline} hurting its standing in the international
community, or worse, **[sending China on path towards armed
conflict.]{.underline}** [When military units of opposing countries are
in close proximity]{.underline} to each other [and tensions run high, it
can be]{.underline} very [difficult to prevent acts of aggression from
**[spilling over into armed conflict.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[Posturing on one side can be viewed as an **[imminent]{.mark}
intent to [attack]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the other. China will have
to balance a fine line to ensure their actions are not viewed as too
soft at home or overly aggressive by the international community. If the
CCP relies heavily on nationalism to strengthen its legitimacy and it is
viewed too soft at home, it will hurt the staying power of the regime.
[If China is viewed as too aggressive by its neighbors, it could
face]{.underline} reduced foreign investment, sanctions, or worse,
**[[armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. All of which would also hurt
the economic growth of China and as a result damage the legitimacy of
the regime.

#### Chinese political instability leads to [nuclear war]{.underline}. [Loose nukes]{.underline} and [Taiwan]{.underline}. 

**David 8**, Professor of IR @ Johns Hopkins (Stephen, "Catastrophic
Consequences: Civil Wars and American Interests," p. 116-121)

While some American policymakers would greet the prospect of [a
[China]{.mark} mired in [internal conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} with
relief, a crippled China [presents]{.underline} its own threats to
American interests, [threats]{.underline} that [are]{.underline} in many
ways [more dire than those posed by a rising China.]{.underline}
American and Chinese economies have become closely inter- twined with
huge amounts of American investment in China and even larger Chinese
purchases of American bonds. If domestic unrest undermines this
relationship, any hope of China becoming prosperous would be dashed,
while the American economy would be throw n into recession ---or worse.
[China is a great power]{.underline} with a population of 1.3 billion
people, bordering on 14 countries. [Its collapse would threaten the
stability of close American allies such as South Korea and Japan, create
opportunities for mischief by Russia and North Korea, and produce a
humanitarian catastrophe unprecedented in world history.]{.underline}
[Should China choose to stave off internal unrest through aggressive
actions against Taiwan, prospects for a Sino-American military
confrontation become all too real]{.underline}. Precisely because China
needs good relations with its neighbors and the United States to
continue on its path of economic growth, there is reason to hope that
the Chinese leadership would not deliberately opt for bellicose
policies. [If China is wracked with instability]{.underline}, however,
[Chinese leaders may not be able to control what happens within and
outside their borders, endangering key]{.underline} American
[concerns]{.underline}. Understanding the consequences of a failing
China for the United States re- quires first grasping why a stable China
is so important to American concerns. As will be seen, China plays a
central role in American economic and strategic interests. Why China,
despite its seeming prosperity and progress, may fall victim to civil
unrest is then examined. Unlike Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico,
China forces us to confront what the collapse of a great power would be
like. Far from a welcome occurrence, [the implications]{.underline} of
such an event [are potentially **[catastrophic]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} America, China\'s Asian neighbors, and [the
world]{.underline} community. American Interests in China The United
States cares about what happens in China, because [America\'s
prosperity]{.underline} and well-being [rests on China remaining
stable]{.underline}. China is the second largest trading partner of the
United States (after Canada ), a relationship whose [disruption would be
disastrous for both countries]{.underline}. [The low cost of Chinese
exports has kept inflation down in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, while delighting consumers with S40 DVD players
and S20 digital cameras. These benefits, while highly visible, pale in
comparison to the critical role played by Chinese purchases of American
securities. China holds over one trillion dollars in foreign reserves,
one of the largest holders of such reserves in the world. Because China
exports so much and imports so little, it accumulates huge amounts of
dollars. This would normally cause the Chinese currency (yuan) to gain
in value, thus reducing its exports and its mammoth reserves. To
preserve its critical export sector, however, China has not allowed the
yuan to float freely and instead has kept its value relatively constant
by buying dollars to the tune of S20 billion per month, ensuring that
its reserves will continue to grow. Approximately 707c of these reserves
are in U.S. dollars, with the great majority in U.S. treasury bonds,
widely seen as the most secure investment one can make, since they are
backed in full by the American government. A major reason why [interest
rates]{.underline} in the United States [have been kept low]{.underline}
is [because China buys]{.underline} so many of these [bonds. These low
interest rates are central to the health of the American
economy]{.underline}, fostering economic expansion and high home prices.
The housing market is especially critical, as it has been the major
engine of growth for the American economy over the past several years,
as homeowners (many of whom have saved little) borrow against the ever
rising values of their houses, stimulating the economy with their robust
consumer spending. If China stops buying American treasury bonds or
dramatically slows down their purchase, American interest rates would
need to increase in order to attract other buyers, making business
expansion more costly , houses much more expensive, and dramatically
cutting consumer spending.\' China displayed its economic clout the day
after the Democrats won control over both houses of Congress in November
2006, when the head of China\'s central bank declared that the Bank
would diversify more of its reserves into nondollar currencies. This
prompted an immediate worldwide sell-off of American dollars, which
dramatically cut the dollar\'s value. If such a seemingly benign
announcement could produce this effect, one shudders to think of the
impact of a major Chinese sell-off of American bonds on the United
States.4 Some have taken solace in the view that Chinese self-interest
would prevent Beijing from acting in ways that would harm the American
economy. If, for example, China halted its purchase of American
securities, China too would suffer as the value of the bonds in its
possession would also decrease. [If China is convulsed with domestic
disorder]{.underline}, however, [it would be **unable** to purchase the
American bonds, plunging the U.S. economy into crisis]{.underline}. An
unstable China also presents major strategic concerns for the United
States. Since the death of Mao in 1976, China has largely cooperated
with the United States on key foreign policy goals. China has been a
prime player in talks with North Korea, striving to contain the damage
done by Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons. In part because of
China's concerns about its own Islamic minority, Beijing has worked with
Washington after 9/11 to confront terrorism. China has become a major
international player in the United Nations, contributing more troops to
peacekeeping missions around the world than any other Security Council
member. 5 With Washington's endorsement, China joined the World Trade
Organization, where it is expected to play a major role in lowering
tariffs and establishing rules for free trade that the world (and it)
will follow. To be sure, the United States and China do not agree on
everything. The United States is concerned about China\'s lack of
democracy, overlooking of human rights abuses in Darfur and elsewhere,
border disputes with its neighbors, close ties with Iran, and continuing
claims to Taiwan. Nevertheless, in a world increasingly divided between
those fostering terror and instability and those seeking to maintain
order and enhance prosperity, China clearly belongs in the latter camp,
much to America\'s relief. If China is beset by internal disorder,
however, there is no telling what kind of regime might emerge in its
wake. The brutal civil war in China in the late 1940s gave birth to an
equally brutal government that made life miserable for its neighbors and
America for decades. [A twenty-first-century civil war could well bring
about the emergence of a hostile, expansionist China that, armed with
**[nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} and a strong economy, [posed
an even greater threat to]{.underline} American interests and [world
stability]{.underline} than its Maoist predecessor. [A strong China is
necessary to preserve Asian stability]{.underline}, a vital interest of
the United States. The prosperity of Asian nations is directly linked to
the surging Chinese economy. In the 1990s, Asian nations produced goods
largely for non-Asian countries, particularly the United States. By
2005, more than half of all regional exports were to other states in the
region, with China the most likely destination. China is the number one
trading partner of such Asian powerhouses as South Korea and Japan, both
of which now provide more direct investment to China (over S5 billion
per y ear) than even the United States.6 Moreover, China has emerged as
the major player in Asian multilateral organizations, including the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization (SCO), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
(APEC). None of these organizations could meet their goals of fostering
economic and political interdependence without the active cooperation of
China. [Insofar as economic interdependence and international
institutions promote peace and security, the continued economic growth
and stability of China is essential for Asia]{.underline}. The
importance of a stable China to American strategic interests is best
seen by considering what might happen [if China unraveled]{.underline}.
One of the first consequences would be millions of refugees pouring from
China's borders, unsettling its neighbors. [The stability of key
American allies such as Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan would be severely
tested as they try to cope with]{.underline} this massive human flow
along with [the economic shockwaves of China\'s
dissolution]{.underline}. Nor would the United States be immune, as mam
Chinese may take advantage of corrupt officials or professional human
smugglers (\"snakeheads\') to make their way to America\'s shores.
[North Korea]{.underline}, unpredictable under normal circumstances,
[may flex its military muscle]{.underline} along its borders with China
and South Korea, **[[with dreadful results]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Ethnic minorities in provinces such as Tibet and Xinjiang might seize
the moment to attempt to break away]{.underline} from Beijing\'s
domination, fostering even greater instability. [China\'s control of
its]{.underline} more than 200 **[[nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, usually very secure, [may be
compromised, with the arms]{.underline} eventually [falling into unknown
hands]{.underline}. The [territorial disputes]{.underline} that China
has [with Russia]{.underline}, Vietnam, [India, and others could well
degenerate into **[armed warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline} [as China loses
control over its own military forces]{.underline} and its neighbors seek
to take advantage of its internal strife. As Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping remarked (following the 1989 Tiananmen demonstrations), the
collapse of Chinese rule would have terrible effects that would go far
beyond China\'s borders: \"And if a civil war broke out, with blood
flowing like a river, what \'human rights\' would there be? If civil war
broke out in China, with each faction dominating a region, production
declining, transportation disrupted and not millions or tens of millions
but hundreds of millions of refugees fleeing the country, it is the
Asia-Pacific region, which is at present the most promising in the
world, that would be the first affected. And that would lead to disaster
on a world scale.\"9 While Deng may have had reason to exaggerate the
effects of the toppling of the Chinese regime, his concerns ring true.
[American relations]{.underline} with China [would be severely damaged
in the wake of Chinese unrest.]{.underline} [The Chinese regime might
single out the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as an enemy in
order to stifle civil strife by fostering anti-American
nationalism]{.underline}. [If China violently suppressed
protests]{.underline}, as it did during the 1989 Tiananmen
demonstrations, the American [Congress might retaliate with economic
sanctions, further escalating tensions]{.underline} between China and
the United States. Especially if China takes actions against groups
favored by the United States, such as Chi- nese Christians, the American
leadership is likely to react harshly against Beijing. Chinese leaders
already worry about the United States exploiting internal unrest to
remove them from power. Actual American support of insurgent groups even
if it is confined to expressions of sympathy, could be taken as a sign
that Washington had joined with the rebels, throwing Sino-American
relations into crisis. [China would very quickly turn from an erstwhile
ally into a superpower adversary]{.underline}. The deterioration of the
American relationship with China would be especially dangerous regarding
Taiwan. Under the best of circumstances, Taiwan presents a flash point
in the Chinese-American relationship. China\'s claims that Taiwan is a
renegade province belonging to the People\'s Republic fly in the face of
America\'s commitment to protect Taiwan, a democratic and prosperous
ally. [So long as Taiwan does not declare its independence, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China can agree to
disagree about Taiwan\'s future, but should internal unrest engulf
China, this uneasy and informal accommodation could
unravel]{.underline}. [If China falls victim to widespread instability,
the pressure to act against **[Taiwan would be
enormous]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It would give China the excuse to
impose martial law, improving its abilities to suppress any budding
revolt. China\'s claims to Taiwan enjoy near unanimous approval among
the Chinese people. [Acting against Taiwan would enable the Chinese
leadership to fan the flames of nationalism]{.underline}, one of the few
means at its disposal to rally support for an otherwise illegitimate
regime.\" [A Sino-Taiwanese confrontation could also come about
inadvertently if the Chinese leadership decided to provoke a crisis over
Taiwan only to find itself at war as popular emotions prevented a
peaceful resolution]{.underline} of the crisis. If a Taiwanese leader
decided to exploit Chinese unrest by declaring independence, the Chinese
government might have no choice but to launch an attack. As the
political scientist Susan Shirk argues, no Chinese regime can stand
aside and allow Taiwan to announce its independence without going to war
if it expects to survive in power.12 Whether through miscalculation or
brinksmanship, [war with Taiwan producing a Sino-American confrontation
could well be the unintended out- come of Chinese civil
conflict]{.underline}. China is well prepared to take forceful action
against Taiwan if it decides to do so. China has been constantly
upgrading its air and sea capabilities for a possible invasion across
the Straits of Taiwan. 13 If China chooses not to invade, it could
launch the hundreds of ballistic missiles deployed on its coast against
Taiwan or it could blockade its two principal ports. Given that Taiwan
is critically dependent on foreign trade (75% of its GDP) and imports of
fuel for energy consumption (95% of its energy needs come from outside
the country), either of these actions would cripple the island state. 14
It is difficult to see the United States remaining indifferent to a
brutal assault against one of its allies. Perhaps most worrisome, we
simply do not know all of the effects that the collapse of China would
bring. The prospect of civil unrest in China threatens an existing great
power poised perhaps to become the major power of the twenty-first
century. [The impact of civil conflict in China cannot be isolated to
one or a handful of consequences. As seen in the French
Revolution]{.underline} of 1789-- 1799 [and the Russian Civil
War]{.underline} of 1918-- 1920, [great powers do not suffer civil
violence quietly, or alone]{.underline}. [Given China's central role in
the world economy]{.underline}, enormous population, **[[nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and growing international influence,
[the unraveling of China cannot help but be **[shatter]{.mark}ing for
[the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Change can be beneficial, and the
weakening of a prospective superpower competitor would be celebrated in
some American quarters. Nevertheless, an uncontrolled, cataclysmic
transformation in China would threaten American interests as much as, if
not more than, the purposeful designs of Maoist China a generation ago.

### Taiwan War = Nuclear

#### Nuclear war. It's [on the brink]{.underline} and [underestimated]{.underline}.

**Khan 24**, PhD, chair of international history and diplomacy at Tufts
University's Fletcher School. (Sulmaan, "[[China and the U.S.
Are]{.underline}]{.mark} Numb to the Real Risk of War: The pair are

https://archive.ph/J8LHf#selection-3053.0-3059.76) \[Language edited\]

[[Beijing and Washington have become desensitized to the risk]{.mark}
these circumstances pose]{.underline}. But in the militarization of
foreign policy and the failure to grasp the full significance of that
militarization, [[the pair are]{.underline}
**[one]{.underline}**]{.mark} accident and a **[[bad decision]{.mark}
removed [from a catastrophic war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Mathematicians
speak of the "edge of chaos": the final point separating order from
doom. A system operating at [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} edge [[has no
room for error]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is where the accumulated
weight of the past has brought the [United States, China, and
Taiwan]{.underline}. They walked right up to the edge of a war that
could go nuclear several times in the past: in 1954-55, 1958, and 1996.
Now, they [seem to be living on that edge permanently]{.underline}.

In recent years, China's policy has alienated Taiwan completely. As
China has bullied, threatened, and displayed force at home and abroad,
it has made unification unacceptable to much of the Taiwanese
electorate. And it has enjoyed only mixed success in trying to isolate
Taiwan diplomatically. It has managed to buy off many of Taiwan's
erstwhile allies, but its conduct over COVID-19 and support for Russia
despite the invasion of Ukraine have cost it friends, too---and those
former friends have turned to the island across the strait.

Since at least 2021, Taiwan has had a seemingly endless parade of
visitors, from Germany's education minister to Liz Truss, the former
U.K. prime minister. In November 2021, the European Parliament sent its
first official delegation to the island; the head of the delegation,
Raphaël Glucksmann, told Tsai, "We in Europe are also confronted with
interference from authoritarian regimes and we came here to learn from
you." In October 2022, Tsai received lawmakers from Lithuania and
Ukraine; the former had recently established a representative office in
Taiwan despite Beijing's anger, while the latter was making a gesture of
solidarity with a country that, unlike China, had been sharp in its
criticism of Moscow. A Japanese parliamentary delegation that arrived in
December 2022 spoke glowingly of Tsai's defense plans and emphasized
Japan's own determination to keep the status quo in the region from
being "changed by force or unilaterally." China has warned against or
condemned many of these visits.

Beijing has only itself to blame for Taiwan's strengthened diplomatic
position. Its wolf warrior nationalism and reluctance to break with
Moscow have cost it European support. If visits from foreign politicians
were to translate into condemnation of China at the United Nations,
Beijing could veto a Security Council resolution. In this case, like
Russia, China would find itself a pariah state---and unlike Russia,
China cares about how it is seen by the world. China's own corrosive
nationalism has eaten into its body politic, too. It has not torn itself
apart in a bout of political bloodletting, but it has certainly let
loose the kind of jingoism that would allow that to happen. What it will
decide to do in a crisis is uncertain. Beijing itself does not know.

The United States, meanwhile, seems intent on reviving a defense treaty
with Taipei that it once spent more than a decade trying to break.
Taiwan has become a means of showing China just how tough the United
States can get. Washington is not clear on how getting tough will alter
Beijing's conduct, but "deterrence" is the concept invoked most often. A
show of force, the thinking goes, will deter China from aggression. But
what if deterrence fails? What if the show of force backs China into a
corner from which it feels it has no option but to lash out? To this,
Washington has few answers beyond preparing for war.

Some **[U.S.]{.underline}** pundits have waxed lyrical about how they
would fight a war with China. Taiwan, they opined, will be turned into a
"porcupine" with hardened defenses. One former defense official
suggested the use of "low-yield tactical nuclear weapons" in the event
of a conflict with China. (The bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki
qualify as low yield.) The possibility of Russian President Vladimir
Putin using such weapons sent shock waves of horror through the world,
but the idea of employing them in a [war with China]{.underline} became
normal in some circles. There was no guarantee that, once the nuclear
taboo was breached, the weapons would stay "low yield." But the question
of what would happen if the two powers escalated to higher-yield arms
and **[plunge]{.underline}**d [the world into **nuclear
holocaust**]{.underline} has been left unresolved.

It is as though the United States is being haunted by all the ghosts of
its long past with China and Taiwan, forcing it to relive questions it
had once thought resolved. U.S. military leader Douglas MacArthur wanted
to wage war against China in 1950. President Dwight D. Eisenhower
considered using nuclear weapons against China in 1955 and 1958. Today,
Washington abides by the "One China" principle, but it wants Taiwan to
enjoy "self-determination." It vows that it does not dispute the
formulation that Taiwan is a part of China, but it will help Taiwan
resist Chinese coercion. It wishes to promote Taiwan's presence in
international organizations, but it remains unwilling to recognize
Taiwan itself. The United States has shifted from pure ambiguity to
ambiguity with a tilt in favor of Taiwan---and it has done so because it
decided China is an enemy.

Like China, the United States is mired in jingoism and confusion. Like
China, it has no idea what it would do if things go wrong. With the 2024
U.S. presidential election heating up, the one thing every candidate,
Democrat or Republican, has done is to show how tough they could get on
China. Republicans vying for the nomination got in on the act early;
former President Donald Trump has denounced French President Emmanuel
Macron for "kissing Xi's ass," referring to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Joe Biden, with the power of the incumbent, has not stopped at rhetoric.
Whether supporting a TikTok ban unless the app is sold or calling for
increased tariffs on Chinese goods, his policies are calibrated to
demonstrate toughness on China.

Taiwan's own presidential elections, held on Jan. 13, showed just how
deeply the island's electorate had turned against unification. At first,
William Lai, the candidate from Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), vowed not to alter the status quo, though he accused Beijing of
doing so. Taiwan, he argued, was already sovereign. There was no need to
change what worked. But his caution soon vanished. While campaigning,
Lai defined success for Taiwan as its leaders being able to visit the
White House. This was a gauntlet thrown down---Taiwanese officials are
blocked from visiting Washington. The Biden administration immediately
demanded an explanation. This was not, U.S. officials made clear, how
the relationship worked. Where Tsai had been prudent, Lai was willing to
push his luck.

The Kuomintang (KMT), the main opposition party, was not leaning toward
Beijing, either. Its nominee, Hou You-yi, the mayor of New Taipei City,
said that he would reject both "one country, two systems" and a formal
move for independence, but that if Taiwan were attacked, he would face
the challenge. Taiwan, according to Hou, needed to be ready to defend
itself. On the crucial question of how to deal with China, there was
little difference between the policies Lai and Hou espoused.

A third candidate, Ko Wen-je of the Taiwan People's Party, was
calculatedly vague on China policy. His campaign made clear that he was
depending on votes from traditional KMT supporters: those who would have
favored a closer relationship with China. He claimed that he would find
the middle ground between the KMT's appeasement of China and the DPP's
provocation of it; he would make Taiwan a bridge for Sino-American
communication rather than a front in a Sino-American war. How he
proposed to do all this was left undefined.

Lai eventually won the presidency, but it was not the ringing triumph
Tsai had won four years earlier. Lai scraped through with a mere 40
percent of the vote, his victory made easier by the fact that Hou and Ko
had failed to join forces. As he prepares to take office on May 20, Lai
faces a deeply divided, volatile populace and a legislature in which the
DPP is bereft of a majority.

This is a point China has been quick to underline. The DPP, it huffed
after the election, is not representative of "majority public opinion."
What is lost on Beijing is that the other candidates made clear that
unification was not something they were willing to countenance either.
Hou had made a point of not inviting Ma Ying-jeou, the last KMT member
to serve as Taiwan's president, to his rallies; he knew that to
associate himself with Ma's embrace of China would have doomed his
candidacy. Beijing still does not understand Taiwan. Meanwhile, the
United States continues to disavow support for Taiwanese independence
while making plans for further delegations to the island. With the U.S.
presidential election going into fifth gear, the risk of miscalculation
will only rise.

[[At the edge of chaos, a single choice can make the difference between
order and catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}. More than 80 years on from
the Cairo Declaration, which held that Taiwan would be "restored to the
Republic of China" at the end of World War II, we can see that there
were myriad moments that could have yielded different outcomes, for
better or for worse. If President Franklin D. Roosevelt had insisted on
self-determination for Taiwan after World War II, if the Korean War had
not happened, if Beijing had made "one country, two systems" work, if
Taiwan had developed a nuclear weapon, if Pelosi's plane had indeed been
shot at---if someone had made a different decision at any of those
moments, the world would be a radically different place.

[[When deterrence]{.mark}, toughness, [and pride drive policy, the room
for error **diminishes** to]{.mark} virtually
**[nil]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[China, Taiwan, and the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [are at a point where the choices

Those choices are best made with the historical record---and all its

#### Taiwan invasion sets off a [wave]{.underline} of [global]{.underline} catastrophes\-\--[extinction]{.underline}. 

**Easton 23**, MA, China Studies, National Changchi University, senior
director and research fellow, Project 2049 Institute \[Ian, "The World
After Taiwan\'s Fall," Pacific Forum International, Issues and Insights,
23.2)

American policymakers and military leaders are increasingly convinced
that the [[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [is]{.mark} the strategic [**nerve
center** of the **world**]{.mark}. **No other** flashpoint is as
structurally **unstable**, as]{.underline} politically vexing, and as
[likely to **draw** the world's leading **superpowers** into a
war]{.underline}. Through both word and deed, Chairman Xi Jinping and
the Chinese Communist Party ([[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}) elite [are
signaling their intention to [**annihilate**
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}'s government [[through]{.underline}]{.mark}
the use of overwhelming **[[force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is a
growing concern in Washington that it may no longer be a question of if
a Chinese attack on Taiwan will occur, but when and how.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

Of course, it is debatable whether the CCP high command is operating
according to a cast iron timeline. While prudent U.S. defense planners
might assume that the countdown to war has already begun (and argue that
countervailing American and Taiwanese preparations should proceed
accordingly), wise strategists will not close their minds to other
possibilities. It may very well be the case that Xi Jinping's plans and
intentions for Taiwan are elastic and changeable. For all we know, Xi is
convinced that a long-term campaign of coercion will succeed at
crumbling the Taiwanese government's ability to resist annexation. It
may even be the case that several politicians in Taiwan have been
secretly cultivated by Chinese intelligence, and they might one day
collaborate with the CCP to affect a takeover. The purpose of this
paper, however, is not to discuss such analytic problems, but rather to
explore what lies beyond the compass of the current discourse. An
understudied aspect of the Taiwan defense debate is what would happen
after an invasion was over. What might happen, for example, if the
People's Republic of China (PRC) succeeded in conquering Taiwan? How
would that impact U.S. national security? If Taiwan (Republic of China,
ROC) falls, what would the implications be for regional and global
security? In the following pages, we will examine these questions and
attempt to come to grips with an overlooked aspect of the most
consequential foreign policy problem of our time. Into the Great Unknown
It is axiomatic that there is no way for us to know how the future will
unfold. Unlike a code, puzzle, or cipher, the future cannot be solved.
There is no master key that can crack open the door and give us a look
at the scenes that will appear weeks, months, and years from now. At the
present time, we stand at the entryway of the here and now straining to
peer ahead, but we see nothing because there is nothing to see. That
world has yet to exist. Since accurate prediction is impossible and the
science of time travel remains speculative, we must exercise our
imaginations and, to a certain degree, our logic. We must think about
the unthinkable and accept that any thoughts we think will almost
certainly be falsified by events. Indeed, we will cherish the hope that
the future plays out in different ways entirely. With luck, the
following scenarios will prove wrong. Tens of millions of lives are at
stake, and the fates of billions of people could be irrevocably altered
by war in ways that we are ill- equipped to forecast. For the sake of
keeping our thought exercise within reasonable bounds, we will explore
only two of the manifold scenarios that are available or could be
conjured. In the first of our imagined futures, Taiwan is invaded by the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) and falls with no outside assistance from
the United States or others. In the second imagined future, Taiwan is
stormed and occupied by the PLA in spite of belated U.S. and allied
attempts to forestall that eventuality. In scrutinizing both cases, our
main concern will not be the finer details of how the storyline
unspools, but rather what the situation looks like once it does and what
the implications are for the United States and the region. But before we
plunge into our two nightmare scenarios, let us first take stock of what
it would mean for the United States to lose Taiwan as a democratic
partner and strategic bulwark against PRC expansionism. The Constants If
Taiwan falls, several implications will remain constant irrespective of
how it happens. Taiwan has outsized strategic value due to its
extraordinary political character, its unique military and intelligence
capabilities, its critical role in global high-tech supply chains, and
its geographic location in the heart of East Asia. Regardless of how
Taiwan is captured by the Chinese authorities, the region and the world
will have lost a leading democracy, and the security architecture of the
region will be altered. This would be a traumatic---and potentially
catastrophic---event in the history of American foreign policy. When a
Democracy Dies At the time of this writing, Taiwan is ranked among the
top 10 democracies in the world.1 Freedom House gave Taiwan a composite
score of 94 out of 100 when it came to measures of global freedom (in
comparison the United States ranked 83 and China ranked 9).2 Reporters
Without Borders recently said that Taiwan has a remarkably high level of
press freedom. Taiwan ranked 38 out of 180 in its World Press Freedom
Index (in comparison the United States ranked 42 and China ranked 175).3
Since its transition to democracy, Taiwan has not had a seat at the
United Nations or other international organizations. The United States
and many other countries nonetheless have robust unofficial
relationships with Taiwan, and Taiwan is widely considered by
governments across the democratic world to be a responsible, like-minded
partner and a model of good governance. Today, Taiwan can be counted on
to advance democratic values and human rights. If Taiwan was conquered,
it would become an occupied territory ruled by China's one-party
dictatorship. Its politics would fundamentally change. The free and
independent country that used to be Taiwan (ROC) would disappear, and a
repressive police state would emerge. The Chinese military would
establish an overwhelming presence on Taiwan alongside the CCP's
multi-layered internal security forces (MSS, MPS, PAP, Chengguan, etc.).
The Communist Party can be expected to employ terror tactics against the
local Taiwanese population. The mass surveillance and control complex
that is omnipresent in Xinjiang and Tibet would likely be exported to
Taiwan. A local proxy government under the direct control of Beijing
would rule the islands, and all territory formerly administered by the
ROC government would be harshly policed. Patriotic education and mass
propaganda campaigns would be launched in Taiwan to spread "Xi Jinping
Thought" and imprint "Chinese socialist values" onto the minds of the
vanquished population. A number of Taiwan's film, television, and
Mandopop stars can be expected to amplify Beijing's messages (many
already do). The post-invasion media environment would be characterized
by its high levels of censorship. Taiwan would exist on the brink of an
informational blackhole. While international reporters would not have
open access to Taiwan, it seems almost certain that scattered pieces of
information would emerge out of occupied areas in the form of grisly
pictures, video recordings, and refugee testimony that show violations
of human rights were underway.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS CONTINUE\>\>

Having lost one of its leading representatives, the [**free world**
would likely be in the presence of]{.underline} a
**[growing]{.underline}** sense that [**illiberal** forces]{.underline}
were on the march and **[[authoritarianism]{.underline}]{.mark}** was
[[spread]{.mark}ing in an **[unchecked]{.mark}** fashion]{.underline}.
The loss of Taiwan could [lead many democracies to experience a **crisis
of confidence**. [Many]{.mark}]{.underline} observers might
[[draw]{.mark} the [conclusion]{.mark} that
[China's]{.mark}]{.underline} Marxist-Leninist [[model]{.mark} was
**[superior]{.mark}**]{.underline}---or at the very least
ascendant---and liberal democracies too weak to resist the new world
order that Beijing was creating.

Lost Military and Intelligence Capabilities

[Taiwan's military **stands watch** over]{.underline} the vulnerable
flanks of **[Japan]{.underline}**'s southwestern approaches, protecting
Japan [and other **East Asian** countries from the threat of PRC
**expansionism**]{.underline}. Indeed, the ROC armed forces patrol and
monitor some of the world's busiest lines of communication. The air,
water, and electromagnetic spectrum around Taiwan are dense with all
manner of military and commercial traffic. Although often
unacknowledged, Taiwan's military has long been a reliable partner to
the United States on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief
operations. The U.S. and ROC governments reportedly share intelligence,
which the Americans are well positioned to collect with sophisticated
satellites, aircraft, and submarines, and the Taiwanese collect with
human agents, listening posts, and surveillance radars.4

[If Taiwan falls, its military **bases** and
**intelligence**]{.underline} facilities [would be **occupied** by the
[PLA]{.mark}. The Chinese **navy** can be expected to base]{.underline}
its ships and submarines in Taiwan's deep-water ports. The naval bases
at Su'ao and Keelung would be especially valuable for the PLA, [which
for the **first time**]{.underline} in its history would [[have
**unencumbered** access to]{.underline}]{.mark} the deep waters of the
[**[Pacific]{.mark}**. The **American**, **Japanese**, and
**Taiwanese**]{.underline} surveillance [systems]{.underline} that
currently track Chinese submarines in the shallow waters off the East
Asian littorals [would be]{.underline} rendered less effective (or
**[completely neutralized]{.underline}** in Taiwan's case).

By invading and occupying Taiwan, the [PLA would breach the **center**
of the First Island Chain]{.underline}. After the invasion, Chinese
bombers and missile units based on Taiwan would be able to
[[hold]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. forces in [**[Okinawa]{.mark}** and
[**Guam** at risk of]{.mark} **surprise [raids]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Chinese special forces and amphibious units [could use Taiwan to
**[invade]{.mark}** Japan's **[Ryukyu]{.mark}**]{.underline} islands
([**Yonaguni**, **Ishigaki**]{.underline}, etc.) [and Luzon, the
**[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline}' largest and most populated
island. PLA Navy surface action groups and aviation units based in
Taiwan and the Penghu islands could [threaten a **blockade** of Japan
and South **[Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline} by cutting off their primary
sea lines of communication. The [top of the
**[S]{.mark}**]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea [would be
"**corked**"]{.underline}---providing PLA ballistic missile submarines
with a maritime bastion and further [reinforcing China's military
**dominance**]{.underline} of Southeast Asia.

The United States would lose access to a critical intelligence gathering
hub, and the American analytic community would lose their primary window
into China. Taiwan is an irreplaceable source of Mandarin language
training and all-source intelligence on China. Without Taiwan, the
Pentagon and CIA would likely begin producing flawed analytical
products, which could leave policymakers ill-informed and prone to
making strategic mistakes. In the wake of the successful Chinese
invasion of Taiwan, U.S. intelligence failures could be expected to
increase.

Shattered Supply Chains

Today, Taiwan is the United States' 8th largest trading partner.5
According to the State Department: "U.S. exports of goods and services
to Taiwan supported an estimated 188,000 American jobs in 2019 \...
Taiwanese cumulative investment in the United States was nearly \$137
billion in 2020. Taiwan's direct investment \... directly support an
estimated 21,000 jobs in the United States and \$1.5 billion in U.S.
exports."6 A cross-Strait war would cost hundreds of thousands of
Americans their jobs, and hundreds of billions of dollars would be lost.

Further deeper economic pain would likely follow the initial blow to
American prosperity. "U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in Taiwan
(stock) was \$31.5 billion in 2020, a 8.8 percent increase from 2019.
Reported U.S. direct investment in Taiwan is led by manufacturing,
finance and insurance, and wholesale trade," according to the Office of
the United States TradeRepresentative.7

[The loss of Taiwan would]{.underline} negatively impact the health of
the U.S. economy and could [[trigger]{.mark} an economic
**[recession]{.mark}**]{.underline} in America and [[across]{.mark} the
**[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A recent report asserted that
"[[Taiwan]{.mark} may be the **most [critical link]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}
the entire **[tech]{.mark}**nology [ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline},"
[due to its **dominance** in]{.underline} the **[chip
sector]{.underline}**, original equipment manufacturing, original design
manufacturing, and role as a central hub for producing
technology-related materials. The report found, "Taiwan currently serves
as a [key supplier]{.underline} and partner [to]{.underline} many
leading [U.S. **tech**nology **firms** like Apple, Nvidia, Texas
Instruments, and Qualcomn, as well as to many U.S. allies
globally]{.underline}."8 [That would all **disappear**]{.underline},
forcing companies to suffer massive profit losses at the very moment
they needed to invest in costly new facilities.

It is possible that a Chinese invasion of Taiwan would cause a 21st
century version of the Great Depression. In any event, globalization
would probably cease to exist, as the world splintered into hostile
trade and security blocs. [**[Supply chains]{.mark}**,
already]{.underline} significantly [impacted by]{.underline} the
COVID-19 [pandemic]{.underline}, the Russian invasion of [Ukraine,
and]{.underline} instability in the [Middle East, would be
[**shattered**. Prices]{.mark} would
**[skyrocket]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Panic buying and hording would be
followed by a [[surge in **nativism** and]{.mark} strong impulse
toward]{.underline} trade **[[protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
self-sufficiency.

Harsh Geostrategic Realities

By seizing Taiwan, the [[PRC]{.mark} would have]{.underline} effectively
[**carved** out a **[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}phere
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfluence for
itself in Asia using violent methods. This invasion would [have grave
implications for **i**nternational **law**]{.underline}, the ideal of
national self-determination, and the principle of state sovereignty. The
fall of Taiwan [would undermine **perceptions** of U.S.]{.underline}
global diplomatic and **[military leadership]{.underline}**, straining
(and possibly **[[brea]{.mark}king]{.underline}**) [the American
**alliance**]{.underline} system [and]{.underline} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations
System. [China would be]{.underline} viewed as [the **most powerful**
nation in the **world**]{.underline} and the primary mover of the 21st
century. Leaders would experience trepidation as Beijing marched
[toward]{.underline} its vision of a **[new]{.underline}** centralized,
[**authoritarian** world order]{.underline}.

[[Nuclear **arms racing**]{.underline}]{.mark} would start and [could
[easily]{.mark} rapidly **[spiral]{.mark}** out of control]{.underline}.
The likelihood of **[[World War Three]{.underline}]{.mark}** breaking
out could [[climb]{.mark} **higher**]{.underline} than anything
previously seen. It can be expected that the [**world** would begin
sliding toward]{.underline} the brink of an **[abyss]{.underline}**, and
human [**[civilization]{.mark}** would risk being **[knocked
backward]{.mark}**]{.underline} in its developmental story. Abstract
ideas like international law and universal values would increasingly
appear quaint, even faintly ridiculous. This would be a new age of
empires; might would once more make right.

In such circumstances, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} could be expected to
go nuclear and [[become]{.mark} heavily
**[militarized]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Tokyo would likely be in the grip
of a profound sense of insecurity and disillusionment with U.S. defense
guarantees. It is possible that [Japanese politics could [swing
in]{.mark} a **right-wing**, [**authoritarian** direction]{.mark}.
Alternatively]{.underline}, it is possible that far left-wing
politicians could gain power, and Japan might [end up **band wagoning**
with China]{.underline}. In either event, there would be an increasing
risk that Japan's democracy would erode, and the country could
experience a wave of political violence. Over time, it may even be
[possible]{.underline} that [Japan would become a
**dictatorship**]{.underline}.

South Korea would almost certainly feel itself being pulled into China
orbit, and policymakers in Seoul would face the unpalatable choice of
losing of their freedom and sovereignty or resisting CCP influence
alongside the United States and Japan. [**South [Korea]{.mark}** would
likely [go **nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline} and attempt to save their
nation from takeover by [building an independent **deterrent
force**]{.underline}. South Korea may experience an even deeper domestic
political crisis than Japan. It seems likely that the [**Philippines**,
**Indonesia**, **Malaysia**]{.underline}, and other Southeast Asia
nations that are currently hedging their bets would conclude that they
had no choice but to **[align]{.underline}** themselves [with
Beijing]{.underline} against the United States.

[**[North]{.mark} Korea** would likely be
**[emboldened]{.mark}**]{.underline} by a successful Chinese invasion of
Taiwan and reconsider long-dormant **[plan]{.underline}**s
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} weaken and, if possible, [**destroy** South
Korea's government and affect a **[takeover]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
the peninsula. With the power and prestige of the United States
drastically reduced and South Korea acutely vulnerable, it seems
probable that North Korea would seek to obtain China's help in attacking
South Korea. [Beijing]{.underline} is likely to [see the situation as an
**opportunity** to drive American forces **off** the Asian mainland.
China's government would]{.underline} probably
**[encourage]{.underline}** and support some degree of [North Korean
aggression]{.underline}. At a minimum, an unprecedented campaign of
coercion would likely result, which could escalate to war. At the same
time, CCP influence over Pyongyang would grow, and North Korea would
struggle in vain to maintain its independence from the new PRC empire.
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}** would almost certainly see the loss of
Taiwan as a national security disaster and [quickly **[expand]{.mark}**
its **[nuc]{.mark}**]{.underline}lear weapons [arsenal and further
**[build up]{.mark}** its conventional **[military]{.mark}** along the
**border**]{.underline}. With Taiwan gone, the [[PLA]{.mark} would
likely [focus on **re-taking**]{.mark} territories controlled by
**[Delhi]{.mark}**]{.underline} as its next major mission.
[[**Australia** will fear]{.mark} being
**[encircled]{.mark}**]{.underline} and isolated as the Chinese military
pushes across the South Pacific. [**Canberra** might opt to
[develop]{.mark}]{.underline} its own independent [[**nuclear**
armaments]{.underline}]{.mark} program and accelerate plans to acquire
nuclear-powered submarines. The Quad would be at a distinctive
crossroads; it may become the foundation for a collective security
organization like NATO, but it could just as easily fall apart.

A similar crossroads would be reached in Europe. With the United States
distracted humiliated by China, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
countries might rally together in common cause and redouble their
efforts to bolster collective security. It seems at least as probable,
however, that the post-war bonds that have long tied together the great
democracies of Europe [[would **fray**]{.mark}. Combined Chinese and
Russian **influence**]{.underline} campaigns might [**succeed** in
getting [countries]{.mark} such as **Germany**, **France**, and
**Italy** to [embrace **pro-Beijing** policies]{.mark}]{.underline} that
drive them against the United States [and **fatally [fracture]{.mark}**
the NATO [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} network. [[European
**disunion**]{.mark} might [follow]{.mark}, throwing the continent
into]{.underline} a political environment eerily reminiscent of the
1920s and [19**30s**]{.underline}.

### At: No CCP Collapse 

#### CCP fragile now- government missteps cause catastrophic collapse

**Antoni, 23'(**E.J. Antoni, 9/29/ 2023, PhD, *Chief Economist, and
Richard Aster Fellow, in The Heritage Foundation's Grover M. Hermann
Center for the Federal Budget, article, "China's Economic Collapse
Carries a Warning About Our Own Future"
https://www.heritage.org/china/commentary/chinas-economic-collapse-carries-warning-about-our-own-future,
A.Msigma)*

Party's panicked response has been to order banks to buy stocks in an
attempt to buoy falling stock prices and the Chinese yuan. [For its own
part, the CCP has finally given up on publishing phony economic
statistics and now just refuses to publish them at all.]{.underline} One
way to deal with historically high youth unemployment is to ignore the
problem.

\>\>\> China's Defense China's state-dominated economy is going the way
of all centrally-planned economies---down the drain. With many in the
media loudly proclaiming that "China's 40-year boom is over," it's worth
contemplating why this is happening, if for no other reason than to
avoid the catastrophe here at home.

China's manufacturing base, the mainstay of its economy for decades, is
hemorrhaging. Its trillion-dollar homebuilding industry is collapsing
under unsustainable debt levels. And its unprecedented infrastructure
campaign has been a crash course in malinvestment.

The Chinese Communist Budget Is Much Bigger Than It Looks

For perspective, China's economy was about 77 percent the size of
America's in March 2022. Today, it is closer to 68 percent. What began
as anemic growth is becoming a full implosion.

The cause, in short, is an incompetent government that routes trillions
to politically-favored industries and state-owned enterprises, all while
suppressing the very entrepreneurs and markets that began launching
China's rise to prominence 40 years ago.

[But [the CCP]{.mark} has [take]{.mark}n [a]{.mark} decidedly dark
[turn]{.mark} of late, with ever more government intrusion in the
economy. [The regulatory state has]{.mark} even [clamped down]{.mark} on
internet and financial [companies]{.mark}, such as Alibaba and Ant,
whose billionaire founders [were seen as challenging the CCP's
authority.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The average [**Chinese** citizen]{.mark} ha[s **effectively had
a**]{.mark}n unspoken [**deal** with the CCP]{.mark} for 40 years: [**As
long as economic times are good**]{.mark} and the people get richer,
[**the party can do** **what**ever **it wants**,]{.mark} personal
liberty be damned. That meant turning a blind eye to the imprisonment of
dissidents and the enrichment of party bosses. But it was a small price
to pay, so long as the economy kept growing at light speed.]{.underline}

But [now that the CCP is losing its economic "mandate of heaven,"
regular **Chinese** [folks]{.mark} are **[los]{.mark}ing
[confidence]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} their government's handling of the
[economy]{.mark} for the first time since the global financial
crisis.]{.underline}

President Xi Jinping is now achieving barely 5 percent growth in China,
which is mediocre for a "developing" country and deeply disappointing to
Chinese, who have gotten used to miracle growth.

[Mediocrity is not enough compensation for a population]{.underline}
that has endured some of the most notorious COVID lockdowns, only to see
them ended almost overnight without explanation. That clarified for many
Chinese that Beijing doesn't know what it's doing, [and that
[government's failures can be---and often
**are---catastrophic**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The CCP's mishandling of everything, but especially the economy, has
left it facing an increasingly skeptical citizenry]{.underline} that is
pulling back on spending and investment as it loses confidence. Foreign
investors and private enterprise are retreating. China's labor force is
shrinking.

\>\>\> The Case for Urgency Against China

The CCP's attempts to stimulate the economy will likely just flip the
current deflation to more inflation, which could drive massive capital
flight overseas while piling more debt on top of China's \$50 trillion
mountain.

The situation is bleak, yet one cannot help but notice the striking
parallels between China's mistakes and increasing U.S. government
intervention in our own economy.

The Biden administration's preference for higher taxes and more
regulation of business, as well as the pouring of trillions into
politically favored businesses and voting blocs, should set off alarm
bells. Further, attempts to stimulate the economy by pouring in freshly
printed money have resulted in 40-year-high inflation, while anemic
growth has left Americans frustrated. The result is stagflation---the
combination of high prices and slow growth.

Productive investment hasn't grown under President Biden, whose approval
rating on the economy is a paltry 36 percent. A recent poll shows that
most people (58 percent) believe that his policies have specifically
made things worse. Home affordability is at a 34-year low. Americans
have accumulated record credit-card debt amid skyrocketing grocery
bills. Paychecks are bigger on paper, yet people are poorer.

The stark realization for Americans is that we are becoming more like
China. The question is whether [[the]{.mark}]{.underline} ongoing
[[collapse of China **will**]{.mark}]{.underline} motivate us to change
our ways, or just to ignore the warning and
[**[risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} the same
**[[fate.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The leadership's current power politics mindset can be traced back to
the thinking of previous paramount leaders. For instance, Mao famously
expressed his view on the United States by stating that "[American
imperialists are very arrogant]{.underline}. Wherever they can act
unreasonably, they will definitely do so. If they show a little bit of
reason, it is only because they have been pushed to a point where they
have no other choice."59 These sentiments, although less prominent
during the period of [China's reform]{.underline} and opening, [have
regained popularity]{.underline} in recent years. Echoing these
sentiments, Chinese policy experts today often assert that [**Beijing's
recent** **demonstration of military power has prompted other countries
to adopt more accommodating approaches toward China**]{.underline}.60
Even international experts have openly argued that [China's bigger
nuclear arsenal has made Western countries soften their positions toward
China on a range of issues]{.underline}.61

capabilities]{.underline}, Chinese nuclear experts and public opinion
leaders have also maintained that Russia's nuclear modernization and
assertive nuclear posture have [made Washington more cautious in dealing
with Moscow.]{.underline}62 They therefore conclude that a [larger
Chinese nuclear arsenal would **discourage the United States from

They believe that an [expanded nuclear arsenal would compel Washington

https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/4932894-the-end-of-us-global-dominance-presents-an-opportunity-for-america/\]

The era of [American **[hegemony]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which dominated
global affairs since 1945 and reached its peak after 1991, [is [coming
to an **end**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [rather than lament
this]{.underline} shift, [[the U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} and the world
[[should **embrace**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[opportunities]{.mark} it
presents]{.underline}.

For too long, [the U.S. has shouldered]{.underline} the burden of
**[global policing]{.underline}**, tied to the notion of [maintaining a
"[rules-based]{.mark}]{.underline} international
**[[order]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [that [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
increasingly **[[irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The end of this era
opens the door to [a]{.underline} more just, prosperous and
[**[realistic]{.mark}** world order]{.underline} --- one that [is [based
on **balancing**]{.mark}]{.underline} global [powers rather than
dominating them]{.underline}. It's time for the U.S. to adopt a grand
strategy of restraint, rooted in realist international relations theory,
and reshape its role in a multipolar world.

The decline of American hegemony has been a gradual process, accelerated
by major events but always rooted in deeper structural trends. The rise
of other global powers has challenged the ability of the U.S. to control
world affairs. [The **myth** that Washington]{.underline} believed after
the Cold War, that it [could dictate global **governance**]{.underline}
indefinitely, [was]{.underline} always [an illusion.
**Overreach**]{.underline} in military interventions, [coupled with
domestic and international **challenges**]{.underline}, have [weakened
American primacy.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} international system that the U.S. helped build after
World War II --- a [system of]{.underline} multilateral institutions and
[**liberal** norms]{.underline} --- has [shown **cracks** for
years]{.underline}. This was not a neutral or benevolent framework; it
was a structure that [served **American** interest**s**]{.underline},
often [at the expense of **other**]{.underline}
nation**[s]{.underline}**.

Now, with rising competition from other powers, the idea that Washington
can --- or should --- continue to act as the global enforcer is not only
unrealistic but also **[counterproductive]{.underline}**. [Clinging to
hegemony leads]{.underline} only [to]{.underline} more [costly
**interventions** and strategic **failures**]{.underline}, as evidenced
by recent decades of U.S. foreign policy.

The end of American hegemony is not a catastrophe but an opportunity to
adopt a more restrained and realistic approach to international
relations. A grand strategy of restraint, as grounded in realist theory,
recognizes the limitations of U.S. power and the dangers of
overextension.

Realism --- with its focus on national interest, the balance of power
and the inevitability of competition among states --- offers a clear
path forward. Rather than attempt to dominate or impose an ideological
framework on the world, the U.S. should focus on protecting its core
interests while avoiding unnecessary entanglements.

[[In a **multipolar** world]{.mark}, the [U.S]{.mark}. should be
**[one]{.mark}**]{.underline} power [[among many]{.mark}. The key to
maintaining **security**]{.underline} and stability [is]{.underline} not
through imposing American leadership but [through balance]{.underline}
--- [[engaging in]{.mark} selective competition and
**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline} with other powers, without trying
to dominate them. This shift away from hegemony opens space for new
coalitions and more flexible partnerships based on mutual interest
rather than unilateral dominance.

As China rises and challenges American influence, it is tempting for
policymakers to frame the situation as a new Cold War, with China
replacing the Soviet Union as the primary adversary. But this is a
flawed analogy. The Cold War was a unique ideological and military
struggle between two superpowers, and trying to apply that same logic
today only invites dangerous escalation. [The U.S. should **not**
attempt to]{.underline} "**[contain]{.underline}**" [China]{.underline}
in the traditional sense of the word, which would only provoke
confrontation without serving U.S. interests.

Instead, Washington should pursue a strategy of "blunting" --- using its
power and influence to prevent any one nation from dominating key
regions or setting the rules of global governance. This realist approach
acknowledges that while [**[China's rise]{.mark}** cannot be stopped, it
[can be **managed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. should work with
allies and regional powers to ensure that Beijing's ambitions do not
come at the expense of American security or that of its partners. [By
focusing on]{.underline} maintaining a [balance of power, the U.S. can
**prevent** Chinese domination]{.underline} without overextending itself
in futile efforts at containment.

[**Blunting** is]{.underline} not about imposing America's will on the
world, but about [ensuring]{.underline} that **[no]{.underline}** other
[power can impose its **will**]{.underline}. This strategy recognizes
that the global order is shifting, and Washington's role should be [one
of prudent **management** rather than aggressive
intervention]{.underline}. Realist restraint means recognizing that the
U.S. cannot and should not be involved in every conflict, nor can it
dictate terms to every rising power.

The end of American hegemony liberates the U.S. from the yoke of global
policing, which it has borne to its own detriment for far too long. A
grand strategy of restraint would prioritize America's core national
interests, avoiding the costly and unnecessary interventions that
characterized much of its foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. The
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan illustrate the dangers of overreach and the
futility of trying to impose democratic values through military means.

[[Restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is **not
isolationism**]{.mark}. The U.S. still has [critical
interests]{.mark}]{.underline} that require engagement, particularly
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} key regions like [the [**Indo-Pacific** and
**Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But engagement must be guided by a
sober assessment of American power and the realistic limits of
influence. Realist theory teaches that international relations are
governed by competition among states, and in a multipolar world, [[the
U.S]{.mark}. must [pick]{.mark}]{.underline} its [[battles
**carefully**]{.underline}]{.mark}, choosing to intervene only where its
vital interests are at stake.

[This]{.underline} strategic recalibration [would allow]{.underline}
America to play [a **smarter** role in world affairs]{.underline} ---
working with allies when necessary, but not leading every charge. The
notion that any instability anywhere in the world threatens U.S.
security is no longer tenable, nor is the belief that the U.S. must bear
the burden of global governance alone.

The shift away from American hegemony opens the door to a more
sustainable world order that reflects the multipolar character of
contemporary international politics. This transition is a natural
evolution of the international system, and the U.S. must adapt by
embracing restraint and realism as the guiding principles of its foreign
policy.

In a more multipolar world order, [**smaller** powers and **regional**
actors]{.underline} will [have greater **agency**]{.underline}, and
multilateral [cooperation]{.underline} will be [driven by **shared
interests** rather than imposed]{.underline} norms. The U.S. has an
opportunity to lead by example instead of through coercion. By focusing
on blunting the more extreme ambitions of illiberal powers like China,
Washington can help shape a world that is more stable and equitable.

[The age of U.S. dominance is over]{.underline}, but that is not a cause
for alarm. It is a chance to build a more just and prosperous
international system --- one grounded in the realities of power politics
and the recognition that **[[restraint]{.underline}]{.mark}**, rather
than overreach, [is [the path to]{.mark} sustainable
**[security]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Nesrine Malik offers a powerful and clear-eyed perspective in her recent
piece, "[It]{.underline} [is difficult to imagine a post-American world.
But imagine it we must]{.underline}." She doesn't shy away from the
discomfort such a shift entails, but instead leans into it with honesty
and vision. Malik writes:

"Ironically, this all might be the beginning of a process that leads to
genuine 'liberation days' for other countries, but not the US itself.
There is pain ahead, but also a sort of independence."

Malik exposes the long-standing myth of American exceptionalism,
reminding us that [[what the U.S. has long defined as "peace and
prosperity" was]{.underline}]{.mark} in fact a version [[crafted to
serve its **own interests**]{.underline}, [imposed through **power and
propaganda**]{.underline}.]{.mark} Malik's call to imagine otherwise is
not only necessary; it is liberating and essential.

It's well-documented (or should be) that since the 1950s, [[the U.S. has
actively overthrown governments]{.mark} in Latin America, the Middle
East, Africa, and Asia]{.underline}. Iran in 1953. Guatemala in 1954.
Indonesia in 1965. Chile in 1973. The list goes on. The aim? To install
regimes that protect U.S. corporate and strategic interests and keep
trade flowing in dollars.

[When violent coups and wars became too costly]{.underline} --- or too
unpopular --- [the strategy shifted to [economic
warfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
World Bank began offering "help" in the form of structural adjustment
programs: austerity, deregulation, privatisation, and forced trade
liberalisation. [These policies [devastated local economies]{.mark},
dismantled public sectors, and locked countries into cycles of debt and
dependency.]{.underline}

This is the world system we live in today --- and one that continues to
uphold inequality, exploitation, and neocolonial power relations.

What about China?

It's difficult to talk about U.S. hegemony without bringing China into
the conversation. [[Much of the narrative around China's growing
economic influence frames it as an aggressive takeover]{.underline} [---
but that]{.underline}]{.mark} analysis [[misses a **crucial
point**]{.underline}: [the foundation for China's expanding market share
was]{.underline} **[laid by decades of U.S.-led neoliberal
policies.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

Under the banner of free markets and deregulation, the U.S. pushed for
the liberalisation of global trade, the offshoring of industrial
capacity, and the privatisation of critical infrastructure across the
world. This global restructuring, driven by profit maximization and
minimal state intervention, hollowed out domestic industries and
weakened democratic control over strategic sectors.

As a result, Chinese companies --- backed by a more state-coordinated
economic strategy --- have stepped into the void. From
telecommunications to green tech, they are not simply "invading"
markets; they are capitalising on the very system the U.S. helped build
and enforce.

These developments didn't happen in a vacuum. They are the result of
decades of neoliberal policy: deregulation, privatisation, and a
market-first ideology driven by the U.S. and its institutional allies
--- the IMF, EU, and World Bank. So if we're alarmed by China acquiring
ports or power grids, we should also ask: why is that even possible in
the first place? Through U.S. imposed neoliberalism.

Let's be clear: China is no utopia. But its rise has disrupted the
dominant Western narrative of how development must work and who it must
serve.

China's political system does have problems and internal contradictions
that must be overcome and labour conditions can be harsh, and the
treatment of ethnic minorities remains a serious concern. But at the
same time, it's impossible to ignore the scale of China's achievements:
a country of nearly 1.4 billion people that has lifted hundreds of
millions out of poverty, expanded access to housing, healthcare, and
education, and built infrastructure at an unprecedented pace.

These transformations are rooted not in free-market capitalism, but in a
state-led model shaped by China's revolutionary socialist foundations
--- which is to be celebrated.

That matters --- because it challenges Western assumptions about what
development must look like, and who it must serve.

The difference between socialist and capitalist systems matters
profoundly especially when assessing poverty. Socialist policies often
keep the cost of meeting basic needs low in ways that conventional
price-based poverty measures don't capture. This was the case in China.
Before the market reforms of the 1980s and '90s, the government provided
food, housing, and basic services at little to no cost. In that context,
US\$1.90 (extreme poverty) a day stretched much further in China than in
comparable capitalist countries. Research shows that over the past 40
years the numbers of people in China living in extreme poverty fell by
almost 800 million.

A few researchers analysed OECD data and came to the conclusion that
extreme poverty was lower in China than in countries like India,
Indonesia, and Brazil during the 1980s. China consistently outperformed
these countries on life expectancy, infant and child mortality, average
years of schooling, and access to electricity.

The researcher's acknowledges that extreme poverty is difficult to
measure with precision. But the overall picture suggests that China's
transition toward market liberalisation may have worsened poverty
temporarily. To combat this China government made state-led efforts in
recent decades which reversed those trends. The government has since
invested heavily in poverty alleviation, housing, and public services,
reaffirming its commitment to some of its foundational goals.

[As China's global power has grown, so too has the debate around what
kind of hegemon it may become.]{.underline} [[Unlike the U.S., **China
does not maintain hundreds of military bases**]{.underline}, [nor has it
relied on drone warfare or regime change]{.underline}]{.mark} [to
project influence]{.underline}. [Instead, [it exerts power
through]{.mark}]{.underline} trade, infrastructure, and economic
[[diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark} --- most notably through the Belt and
Road Initiative. [This is still power]{.underline}, still strategic,
still potentially coercive --- [but]{.underline} it [signals a shift
from military domination to economic interdependence.]{.underline}

#### Decline motivates [restraint]{.underline} and peace, [not]{.underline} violent wars.

**MacDonald** & Parent **18**, \*PhD, Associate Professor of Political
Science at Wellesley College. \*\*PhD, Associate Professor of Political
Science at the University of Notre Dame. (Paul K. and Joseph M.,
"Twilight of the Titans: Great Power Decline and Retrenchment", pg. 2-3,
Published by *Cornell University Press*)

In this book, we argue that [[the **conventional wisdom** is
**wrong**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Specifically, we make three main
arguments. First, relative [[**decline** causes **prompt, proportionate
retrenchment** because states seek **strategic
solvency**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The international system is a
competitive place, and great powers did not get to the top by being
imprudent, irrational, or irresponsible]{.underline}. When their
fortunes ebb, states tend to retain the virtues that made them great.
[In the face of decline, [great powers have a **good sense of their
relative capability**]{.mark} and tend not to give away more than they
must]{.underline}. Expanding or [[maintaining **grand strategic
ambitions** during **decline** incurs **unsustainable burdens** and
**incites unwinnable fights**]{.underline}]{.mark}, so the faster states
fall, the more they retrench. Great powers may choose to retrench in
other circumstances as well, but they have an overriding incentive to do
so when confronted by relative decline. Second, the depth of
[[**relative decline** shapes]{.mark} not only [how much a state
retrenches, but]{.mark} also **[which policies it
adopts]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The world is complex and
cutthroat; leaders cannot glibly pull a policy off the shelf and expect
desired outcomes. Because international politics is a self-help system,
great powers prefer policies that rely less on the actions of allies and
adversaries. For lack of a better term, we refer to these as domestic
policies, which include reducing spending, restructuring forces, and
reforming institutions---all to reallocate resources for more efficient
uses. But [international policies]{.underline} may also help, and they
[include [**redeploying forces**, **defusing flashpoints**, and
**redistributing burdens**]{.mark}---all to [**avoid costly conflicts**
and **reinforce core strongpoints**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The faster and
deeper states fall, the more they are willing to rely on others to
cushion their fall. Retrenchment is not a weapon but an arsenal that can
be used in different amounts and combinations depending on conditions
and the enemies faced. Third, after depth, structural conditions are the
most important factors shaping how great powers respond to relative
decline. Four conditions catalyze the incentives for declining states to
retrench. One is the declining state's rank. States in the top rungs of
the great power hierarchy have more resources and margin for error than
those lower down, so there is less urgency for them to retrench. Another
is the availability of allies. Where states can shift burdens to capable
regional powers with similar preferences, retrenchment is less risky and
difficult. Yet another is the interdependence of commitments. When
states perceive commitments in one place as tightly linked to
commitments elsewhere, pulling back becomes harder and less likely. The
last catalyst is the calculus of conquest. If aggression pays, then
retrenchment does not, and great powers will be loath to do it. The
world is not just complex and cutthroat, it is also dynamic. No set of
conditions is everlasting, and leaders must change with the times.
Empirically, [this work aims to add value by being the first to study
systematically all modern shifts in the great power pecking
order]{.underline}. [[We find **sixteen cases of relative**
**decline**]{.mark} since 1870]{.underline}, when reliable data for the
great powers become available, [and compare them to their non-declining
counterparts across a variety of measures]{.underline}. To preview the
findings, [[retrenchment is **by far the most common response** to
**relative decline**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and declining powers behave
differently from non-declining powers. States in decline are more likely
to cut the size of their military forces and budgets and in extreme
cases are more likely to form alliances. This does not, however, make
them ripe for exploitation; declining states perform comparatively well
in militarized disputes. Our headline finding, however, is that states
that retrench recover their prior rank with some regularity, but those
that fail to retrench never do. These results challenge theories of
grand strategy and war, offer guidance to policymakers, and indicate
overlooked paths to peace.

#### Fears of transition wars are a [self-fulfilling prophecy]{.underline}\-\--parity is [far more peaceful]{.underline} than dominance.

**McKinney 19**, PhD from Singapore's Nanyang Technological University
(Jared Morgan, How to avoid a contest for supremacy in East Asia,
Comparative Strategy, 38:4, 316-326, DOI: 10.1080/01495933.2019.1633183)

\[PTT = Power Transition Theory\]

This fear is widely held.17 Insofar as a strategist accepts the
theoretical assumption that the international system is hierarchical and
constituted by the rise and fall of dominant/ hegemonic states,18 this
fear is warranted. Historical evidence indicates that war becomes more
likely in conditions of power parity,19 and a world without U.S.
dominance is likely to be more illiberal in noticeable ways.20 So much
for the better angels of our nature.21 [Given this dilemma, America's
new consensus is that it is time for the U.S. to "get tough" and to
"stand up" to China]{.underline}.22 [That this requires unlearning the
lessons of the First World War]{.underline} (i.e., [the danger of
inadvertent escalation]{.underline}) [is simply a cost to be paid in the
quest to win the contest for supremacy]{.underline}.23 If the choice is
either to compete in Asia to maintain America's hegemony or to cravenly
leave24 for the sake of peace---surrendering it to the Chinese---only
the first option realistically matches America's (supposedly) deeply
rooted attachment to the region25 and deepseated phobia of
appeasement.26 Honest balancers, such as John Mearsheimer, acknowledge
that [staying in the region to compete for [hegemony comes with a very
**serious risk of major-power war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if
neither side sought intentionally to cause such a war, the "lessons" of
the First World War suggest that [[competitive risk-taking
can]{.underline}]{.mark} occasionally [**[get out of hand]{.mark}**,
and]{.underline} a great [war]{.underline}---neither quite intentional
nor quite accidental---[can materialize]{.underline}.27 What should be
"almost unthinkable" in an age of nuclear weapons28 remains quite
possible, for, as the annals of history demonstrate, [political leaders
are not]{.underline} consistently "prudent, enlightened, far-sighted,
and [peaceloving]{.underline}." 29 [Far from coolly calculating
interests, [leaders]{.mark} are well known to [act intuitively
and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[emotionally]{.underline}**]{.mark},30 to
choose war even when it is "materially inefficient," 31 [[to prefer
catastrophic defeat to **humiliation**]{.underline}]{.mark},32 [to be
[obsessed with national **prestige**]{.mark}]{.underline},33
[[and]{.mark} to [fight for]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[status]{.underline}**]{.mark}.34 [This is the "stuff" of
international politics]{.underline}, and anyone who blindly implies the
contrary has not seriously grappled either with the historical record or
the ever-growing body of scholarship on the many paths to war.35
[[Risking major-power war]{.mark} may [**make sense** if the only
alternative is]{.mark} U.S. [dominance]{.mark} or Chinese
dominance]{.underline}.36 But this is a false dichotomy. [In fact, [PTT
is **fundamentally flawed**]{.mark}]{.underline} [both conceptually and
historically]{.underline}. [Conceptually, the [theory ignores]{.mark}
the obvious possibility [that approximate parity can be a
***destination***]{.mark}]{.underline} [[just as well as it can be a
mere waypoint.]{.underline} **[Making international politics about
"supremacy" is as likely to create a contest for supremacy as it is to
describe one]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Historically, PTT **vastly
overstates** the evidence supposedly in its favor]{.underline}.
Hegemonic wars do take place.37 However, such wars seem to require
certain structural conditions. These include the emergence of
technologies that can give certain states a large lead, the existence of
powerful enabling ideologies (e.g., monotheism38 or Nazism39) and the
material significance of land and mass labor in generating wealth and
power.40 That being said, [PTT's most common illustrations for
"hegemonic war"]{.underline}---[the Peloponnesian War and the First
World War]{.underline}---[only support the theory in]{.underline} the
**[vague]{.underline}**st of **[manners]{.underline}**. In 431, [Athens
can be said to have acted from hubris and Sparta from
honor]{.underline};41 [in 1914, Russia---not Germany---was seen as the
rising and unstoppable colossus]{.underline}.42 In both cases, [war
developed out of a confluence of international structures, the actions
of allies/clients, and chance]{.underline}. [[It is far from clear that
the theory of "hegemonic war" **actually explains
anything**]{.underline}]{.mark} [about these cases]{.underline}.43

### 2AC -- UQ -- No US Influence

#### US soft power is [irrecoverable]{.underline}

[[Some might hope]{.mark} that [Trump's alienation
of]{.mark}]{.underline} US [[allies can be reversed]{.underline}]{.mark}
under the next administration. **[[Don't bet on
it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Regardless of how Trump's tariff war plays
out, [the damage to the idea of the West has already been
done]{.underline}. As European Commission President Ursula von der
Leyenput it, "the West as we knew it no longer exists." The Liberal
Party's astonishing comeback in Canada shows the depth of that country's
revulsion vis-à-vis the US. Relationships that were shredded overnight
will take years to rebuild.

[[Might Trump still strengthen the US]{.underline}]{.mark}, even as he
weakens the West[[?]{.underline} **[Don't bet on that,
either]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Not only have America's]{.underline}
friends and [[allies lost faith]{.underline}]{.mark} in it as a reliable
security or trading partner; [[they will constantly wonder what
other]{.mark} resources and [concessions the US might try to squeeze out
of them]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Such]{.mark} [concerns]{.mark} [will
weaken the]{.mark} alliance [system that has always given the West a
decisive edge over]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia and
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Though [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} such as Japan, Saudi Arabia,
South Korea, India, and Singapore are not going to cut security ties
with the US, they and others [[will]{.mark} be tempted to
[reduce]{.mark} their [dependence on America]{.mark} and improve ties
with others. Trump's foreign policy will]{.underline} almost certainly
[lead to more hedging or non-alignment.]{.underline} The European Union,
for example, will seek to expand its partnerships with non-Western
emerging powers such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and
Turkey.

At the same time, [[Trump's policies]{.mark} could strengthen the
momentum behind groupings like]{.underline} the [BRICS]{.underline},
which recently added five new members, bringing the total to ten.
**[They also [will enhance the appeal of]{.mark} [arrangements that
include China but not the US]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, an Asia-Pacific free-trade
agreement that includes US partners and allies such as Australia, Japan,
South Korea, and Singapore, could become a significant global player, as
is also true of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which brings
together China, India, Britain, Germany, and Italy.

[Such extra-American cooperation]{.underline}, already seen in the Law
of the Sea, the International Criminal Court, and the Paris climate
agreement, [will gain even more traction in a Trumpian
world]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} new US [administration is]{.mark}
rapidly [undercutting]{.mark}]{.underline} not only Western dominance,
but also [[America's]{.underline}]{.mark} own [global
[influence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Trump is sure to encourage different
combinations of rising powers, middle powers, regional influencers, and
other arrangements across the "West-Rest" divide. And this new framework
-- what I call a global multiplex -- will hasten the arrival of both a
post-American and a post-Western world.

#### USAID cuts thump

Even in these uncertain times, one thing seems clear enough: Donald
[[Trump's]{.mark} sharp [cuts]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} this country's [[humanitarian aid]{.mark}
will]{.underline} **[[ensure]{.mark} that [its soft power
crumbles]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[doing lasting damage to]{.mark} its
international [standing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Logic of Foreign Aid

[Foreign aid]{.underline}---giving away money to help other nations
develop their economies---[remains one of America's greatest
inventions]{.underline}. In the aftermath of World War II, Europe had
been ravaged by six years of warfare, including the dropping of
2,453,000 tons of Allied bombs on its cities, after which the rubble was
raked thanks to merciless ground combat that killed 40 million people
and left millions more at the edge of starvation.

Speaking before a crowd of 15,000 packed into Harvard Yard for
commencement in June 1947, less than two years after that war ended,
Secretary of State George Marshall made an historic proposal that would
win him the Nobel Peace Prize. "It is logical," he said, "that the
United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the
return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can
be no political stability and no assured peace." Instead of the usual
victor's demand for reparations or revenge, the US gave Europe,
including its defeated Axis powers, \$13 billion in foreign aid that
would, within a decade, launch that ruined continent on a path toward
unprecedented prosperity.

What came to be known as [the Marshall Plan was]{.underline} such [a
brilliant success]{.underline} that Washington decided to apply the idea
on a global scale. Over the next quarter century, as a third of humanity
emerged from the immiseration of colonial rule in Africa and Asia, the
United States launched aid programs designed to develop the fundamentals
of nationhood denied to those countries during the imperial age. Under
the leadership of President John F. Kennedy, who had campaigned on a
promise to aid Africa's recovery from colonial rule, disparate programs
were consolidated into the US Agency for International Development
(USAID) in 1961.

At the outset, USAID's work was complicated by Washington's Cold War
mission. It would sometimes even serve as a cover for CIA operations.
Just a few years after the Cold War ended in 1991, however, USAID was
separated from the State Department and its diplomatic aim of advancing
US interests.

Then refocused on its prime mission of global economic development,
USAID would, in concert with the World Bank and other development
agencies, become a pioneering partner in a multifaceted global effort to
improve living conditions for the majority of humanity. Between 1950 and
2018, the portion of the world's population living in "extreme poverty"
(on \$1.90 per day) dropped dramatically from 53 percent to just 9
percent. Simultaneously, USAID and similar agencies collaborated with
the U.N.'s World Health Organization to eradicate smallpox and radically
reduce polio, ending pandemics that had been the scourge of humanity for
centuries. Launched in 1988, the anti-polio campaign, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention estimates, spared 20 million children
worldwide from serious paralysis.

Behind such seemingly simple statistics, however, lay years of work by
skilled [[USAID]{.mark} specialists]{.underline} in agriculture,
nutrition, public health, sanitation, and governance who delivered a
multifaceted array of programs with exceptional efficiency. Not only
would their work improve or [save millions of lives]{.underline}; [they
would also be [winning]{.mark} loyal [allies for America at a time of
rising global competition]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

And Along Comes DOGE

Enter Elon Musk, chain saw in hand. Following President Trump's example
of withdrawing from the World Health Organization on inauguration day,
Musk started his demolition of the federal government by, as he put it,
"feeding USAID into the wood chipper." As his DOGE hirelings prowled the
agency's headquarters in the weeks after inauguration, Musk denounced
that largely humanitarian organization as "evil" and a "viper's nest of
radical-left Marxists who hate America." Without a scintilla of
evidence, he added, "USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to
die."

With head-spinning speed, his minions then stripped the USAID logo from
its federal building, shut down its website, purged its 10,000
employees, and started slashing its \$40 billion budget for delivering
aid to more than 100 nations globally. The White House also quickly
transferred what was left of that agency back to the State Department,
where Secretary of State Marco Rubio spent six weeks slashing 83 percent
of its global humanitarian programs, reducing 6,200 of them to about
1,000.

As USAID's skilled specialists in famine prevention, public health, and
governance stopped working, the pain was soon felt around the world,
particularly among mothers and children. In Colombia, the agency had
spent several billion dollars to settle a decades-long civil war that
killed 450,000 people by mapping 3.2 million acres of uncharted lands so
that the guerrillas could become farmers. That work, however, was
suddenly halted dead in its tracks---project incomplete, money wasted,
threat of civil conflict again rising. In Asia, the end of USAID support
forced the World Food Program to cut by half the already stringent food
rations being provided to the million Rohingya refugees confined in
miserable, muddy camps in Bangladesh---forcing them to survive on just
\$6 a month per person.

In Africa, the aid cuts are likely to prove catastrophic. Departing
USAID officials calculated that they would be likely to produce a 30
percent spike in tuberculosis, a deadly infectious disease that already
kills 1.25 million people annually on this planet and that 200,000 more
children would likely be paralyzed by polio within a decade. In the
eastern Congo, where a civil war fueled by competition over that
region's rare-earth minerals has raged for nearly 30 years, the United
States was the "ultra dominant" donor. With USAID now shut down, 7.8
million Congolese war refugees are likely to lose food aid and 2.3
million children will suffer from malnutrition. In war-torn Sudan, US
aid sustained more than 1,000 communal kitchens to feed refugees, all of
which have now closed without any replacements.

With 25 million of the world's 40 million HIV patients in Africa, cuts
to USAID's health programs there, which had reduced new infections by
half since 2010, now threaten that progress. In South Africa, half a
million AIDS patients are projected to die, and in Congo, an estimated
15,000 people could die within the next month alone. Moreover, ending
USAID's Malaria Initiative, which has spent \$9 billion since President
George W. Bush launched it in 2005, essentially ensures that, within a
year, there will be 18 million more malaria infections in West Africa
and 166,000 more likely deaths.

On March 3, with such dismal statistics piling up, Elon Musk insisted
that "no one has died as a result of a brief pause to do a sanity check
on foreign aid funding. No one."

Writing from Sudan just 12 days later, however, New York Times columnist
Nicholas Kristof reported that Peter Donde, a 10-year-old child infected
with AIDS at birth, had just died. A USAID program launched by President
Bush called PEPFAR had long provided drugs that were estimated to have
saved 26 million lives from AIDS (Peter's among them) until Musk's cuts
closed the humanitarian agency. Kristof reported that the end of US
funding for AIDS treatment in Africa means "an estimated 1,650,000
people could die within a year without American foreign aid." Why, he
asked, should Americans spend even 0.24 percent of their Gross National
Product on programs that keep poor children alive? Answering his own
question, he wrote that the demolition of USAID "means that the United
States loses soft power and China gains."

Indeed, Dr. Diana Putman, USAID's former assistant administrator for
Africa, argues that the agency's programs have been the chief currency
for US ambassadors in negotiations with developing nations. "Their
leverage and ability to make a difference in terms of foreign policy,"
she explained, "is backed up by the money that they bring, and in the
Global South that money is primarily the money that USAID has."

The Loss of Soft Power

In short, globally, [[the]{.mark} sharp [cuts]{.mark} to USAID's
humanitarian programs [represent a]{.mark}]{.underline}
~~crippling~~\[[[devastating]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [[blow to America's
soft power at a time when]{.mark} great-power [competition with
Beijing]{.mark} and Moscow [has reemerged]{.mark} with stunning
intensity.]{.underline}

In back-handed testimonials to USAID's success, the world's autocrats
celebrated the agency's demise, particularly the end of the \$1.6
billion---about 4 percent of its annual budget---that it devoted to
pro-democracy initiatives. "Smart move," said former Russian Prime
Minister Dmitri Medvedev. On X (formerly Twitter), Hungarian strongman
Viktor Orbán announced that he "couldn't be happier that \@POTUS,
\@JDVance, \@elonmusk are finally taking down this foreign interference
machine." Expressing his joy, Orbán offered a "Good riddance!" to USAID
programs that helped "independent media thrive" and funneled funds to
the "opposition campaign" in Hungary's 2022 parliamentary elections.
Similarly, El Salvador's de facto dictator, Nayib Bukele, complained
that USAID's pro-democracy funds had been "funneled into opposition
groups, NGOs with political agendas, and destabilizing movements."

Offering even more eloquent testimony to USAID's past efficacy, [[China
has moved quickly to take over a number of]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
abolished [agency's]{.mark} humanitarian [programs]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly in Southeast Asia, where Beijing is locked in an intense
strategic rivalry with Washington over the South China Sea. Writing in
the journal Foreign Affairs, two public health specialists observed that
"[[a U.S. retreat on global health]{.underline}]{.mark}, if sustained,

#### US soft power is [cooked]{.underline} -- the country has become an "international pariah".

Lee **Hockstader 25** \[3/14/25, Brown University, BA in American

"Under Trump, the U.S. bleeds soft power overseas",
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/14/trump-soft-power-reputation-prestige-us/>\]
//Sreekantan

Yet his judgment reflects the dizzying speed at which [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is **bleeding soft power**]{.mark} ---
the [ability to exert its international will]{.mark} not by bullets and
buying power, but because other nations admire American values, culture
and policies, especially the commitment to tolerance, rule of law and
human rights.]{.underline}

[All politics, including the international variety, is a struggle for
"competitive credibility,"]{.underline} a term popularized by Harvard
scholar Joseph Nye, who also first articulated the idea of soft power
and described its crucial importance. [In the information age, "[it's
not just whose army wins]{.mark}," observed Nye, "[it's also **whose
story** wins]{.mark}." He accurately credited soft power as a critical
factor in the Cold War's outcome.]{.underline}

Over the course of nearly a century, very few countries have accumulated
a mother lode of soft power as formidable as that of the United States.
[But right now, [Trump]{.mark}, with important assists from Vice
President JD Vance and Elon Musk, [has mounted an attack as
**devastating to our reputational**]{.mark} well-being [as the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11]{.mark}, 2001, were to our physical
security.]{.underline}

During his first term, Trump did terrific damage to the United States'
global image. In spring 2018, just over a year into his presidency,
favorable views of America had dropped, and in many cases plummeted, in
22 of 25 major countries surveyed by the Pew Research Center. The poll
registered double-digit declines in Mexico, the Netherlands, Germany,
Canada, Sweden, France, Italy, Indonesia, Brazil, and Spain, Great
Britain and Argentina.

This time around, the results are likely to be worse. [[The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, having voted at the United Nations with
North Korea and Russia against a resolution condemning Moscow's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine, [joined ranks with international pariahs
**and is vilified**]{.mark} for it across the Western
world.]{.underline}

Vilification has a price. Musk, seen internationally as a proxy for the
Trump administration, appears to be the canary in that reputational coal
mine. Sales of Tesla, his flagship company, have nosedived this year
across Europe, where it has a gigantic factory near Berlin, as well as
in Australia.

The costs of Washington's emerging pariah status could take many forms
--- boycotts of U.S. goods; protests at U.S. embassies and consulates;
international students who might shun U.S. colleges and universities.
Trump, who betrays his contempt for allies at every opportunity, is
depleting a stockpile of goodwill built up over decades.

The president's acolytes have taken the cue. This week, Musk took it
upon himself to disparage Poland's staunchly pro-American foreign
minister, Radek Sikorski, by calling him a "small man."

That insult was directed at an ally that deployed thousands of troops to
fight alongside U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, where they suffered
scores of casualties. It was an unimaginable slight from a White House
official, but it was in line with Trump's threats to wrest Greenland by
force from Denmark, whose per capita loss of troops in Afghanistan was
roughly equal to that of the United States.

[Writing last week in the Financial Times, Nye said [Trump "does not
understand soft power."]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet he also noted that the
U.S. capacity for self-criticism and reform has helped it recover from
self-inflicted wounds in the past, including the wars in Vietnam and
Iraq. Critically, the resilience of America's appeal has been enhanced
by factors beyond government's scope: Hollywood's seductive magic; the
generosity of U.S. foundations and churches; the astonishing freedom of
intellectual inquiry at American colleges and universities.

In 100 days, **[Donald Trump has inflicted more damage to the United
States\' image and influence]{.underline}** than in the four years of
his first term. On the suggestion of billionaire Elon Musk, he has
[dismantled the federal development aid agency USAID,]{.underline}
condemning vital programs for health, education and civil society
worldwide to disappear. [By attacking American universities, media and
the judicial system]{.underline}, [he trampled on the very principles
the US has traditionally used to promote the democratic model. By
mistreating allies and cracking down on immigrants]{.underline}, he
[destroyed the legend]{.underline} established by President Ronald
Reagan: that of \"the shining city on the hill,\" the ideal that
attracted pilgrims to America\'s shores and served as a compass [for the
free world]{.underline} during the Cold War. Today, [Trump has **no
interest in seduction or influence**]{.underline}; for him[, power is
exercised only through intimidation,]{.underline} deals or force.

Whatever happens to Ukraine and Gaza, to markets, to Canada and the

[irrecoverable]{.mark} even if fear persists indefinitely]{.underline}.
In 1969, Richard Nixon failed to frighten the North Vietnamese into
making a quick peace through propagation of his "madman theory" --- that
he was capable of anything if they failed to yield --- because they
didn't believe he was mad.

Today, [[America's]{.mark} putative [allies]{.mark} [are uncertain
whether the president]{.mark} is clinically unstable. But they are
surely absolutely convinced that his word can't be believed for more
than a day; that his courses of [action are irrational]{.mark}; and that
he and his associates, JD Vance and Elon Musk, are strangers to truth
and every convention of diplomacy, decency and courtesy.]{.underline}

A letter was recently dispatched to Trump from an almost-forgotten
giant: Lech Walesa, one of the most celebrated and courageous leaders of
resistance against the 1970s Soviet oppressors of Eastern Europe, winner
of the Nobel Peace Prize and eventually president of Poland. Now, he has
written to express his disgust about American conduct toward Ukraine:
"We find it insulting that you expect Ukraine to show respect and
gratitude for the material assistance provided by the United States in
its fight against Russia," he wrote. "We do not understand how the
leader of a country that symbolizes the free world cannot recognize
\[that Ukraine's struggle is the struggle of us all\]." Walesa wrote
that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's treatment in the Oval
Office "reminded us of the interrogations we endured at the hands of the
Security Services and the debates in communist courts. Prosecutors and
judges, acting on behalf of the powerful Communist political police,
would explain to us that they held all the power, while we held none."

"We find it insulting that you expect Ukraine to show respect and
gratitude for the material assistance provided by the United States in
its fight against Russia," he wrote. "We do not understand how the
leader of a country that symbolizes the free world cannot recognize
\[that Ukraine's struggle is the struggle of us all\]."

Walesa wrote that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's treatment in
the Oval Office "reminded us of the interrogations we endured at the
hands of the Security Services and the debates in communist courts.
Prosecutors and judges, acting on behalf of the powerful Communist
political police, would explain to us that they held all the power,
while we held none."

The history of the 20th century showed, said the writer, that [whenever
the US sought to distance itself from democratic values and its European
allies, [it ultimately became a threat to itself]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Walesa was a towering contributor to the collapse of the Soviet empire.
In the cause of freedom, he endured persecution, show trials and jail
sentences.

Those of us who recall his crusade find his letter to [[Trump almost
intolerably moving. He is a moral titan]{.mark}. Yet his words received
little coverage in American media. I doubt that the president has even
been shown his letter. Morality is absent from the Trumpworld
dictionary.]{.underline}

No democracy has maintained impeccable standards throughout history. As
a reporter, I myself witnessed some of the least admirable actions of
the US in Indochina and elsewhere. Despite all our respective national
sins, however, as a historian I recoil from the we-are-all-guilty view
of the past. Few of us ever doubted that, in the grand sweep of human
affairs, Americans were the good guys --- as Lech Walesa put it, theirs
has been the "country that symbolizes the free world."

### 2AC -- UQ -- No Chinese Arctic Military Presence

#### Fears of increased Chinese activity in the Arctic are [outdated]{.underline} and don't assume the squo -- lack of coop with other countries means that there's no risk.

Jay **Heisler 24** \[5/17/24, Mr. Heisler is a foreign policy analyst,

//Sreekantan

[[China's effort to establish]{.mark} itself as a "near-[Arctic
power]{.mark}" [have become increasingly **confined**]{.mark} to the
territory of its close ally Russia as other [nations lose interest in
coop]{.mark}erating [with Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to
Canadian security experts.

[The [degree in]{.mark} which [China]{.mark} poses a serious
geopolitical [threat in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} region [is
debatable]{.mark} among experts.]{.underline}

[Chinese [efforts to establish research stations]{.mark} in up to half a
dozen Arctic nations [ground to a halt]{.mark} because of travel
restrictions during the COVID pandemic.]{.underline} Mounting concerns
over China's human rights record and its aggressive actions elsewhere
have made several of those countries reluctant to see operations resume,
said experts.

"In many ways our fear of China and the Arctic dates back to five or six
years ago when China's power and influence seemed very much to be on the
uptick in the region," said Adam Lajeunesse, a professor focusing on
Arctic issues at St. Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova
Scotia. "[[Its **political, economic**]{.mark} **and soft power
[influence]{.mark}** [in the Arctic]{.mark} outside of [Russia **has
collapsed**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["Our [fears of China are]{.mark} still [lagging]{.mark} events. A lot
[from pre-COVID era]{.mark} when there was a lot of [fears]{.mark} [that
China]{.mark} was going to [dominate Arctic]{.mark} infrastructure. ...
**That [didn't happen]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} Lajeunesse said.

VOA reported in December 2022 that China had sent or announced plans to
send several people to its two most important scientific outposts in
Norway and Iceland after lengthy absences of Chinese scientists from
both sites.

But there were [no signs of China trying to renew two other scientific
projects in Sweden and Finland]{.underline}, where national
organizations told VOA that Chinese activity was set to end or had
ended.

[By identifying China as the main threat to U.S. interests in the
Arctic, the Pentagon's new strategy contributes to enhancing a somewhat
skewed narrative of the threat China actually poses there]{.underline}.
While some commentators portray China as a "polar great power"
attempting to push its way into the Arctic---and as Beijing runs highly
visible Arctic diplomacy---[the reality is that China currently has very
limited political, economic, and military influence there]{.underline}.
Whereas the U.S. strategy observes that China "seeks to promote the
Arctic region as a 'global commons,'" the Arctic is neither unclaimed
nor ungoverned. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS) constitutes not only the legal basis on which the Arctic
littoral states can claim sovereign rights to most of the Arctic Ocean
(this includes the United States, despite its failure to ratify the
treaty), but also a core of the governance regime covering the region.
Beijing's ability to use bilateral channels to enhance its influence is
also limited because four of the five are strong democracies and NATO
members---and that number increases to seven out of eight if the entire
Arctic Council (made up the five littoral states plus Finland, Iceland,
and Sweden) is included. [It is difficult to see any Arctic
nation]{.underline} beyond Russia being [keen on enabling China to gain
a strong foothold in the region.]{.underline} Indeed, evidence suggests
that the Arctic democracies have all become increasingly aware and wary
of Chinese overtures. For instance, when rumors surfaced in September
that local Norwegian authorities welcomed Chinese investors in the
Arctic port of Kirkenes, Norwegian Minister of Justice and Public
Security Enger Mehl quickly clarified that Oslo will not allow such an
investment if it runs counter to national security interests. Similarly,
[China has failed to entice Iceland and Greenland]{.underline}---both of
which are often seen as particularly vulnerable to the lure of large
Chinese investments. In fact, [most of China's attempts at investing in
Arctic resources]{.underline} outside Russia [have been put on hold or
have failed altogether]{.underline}. Even in the Russian Arctic[,
China's economic footprint is relatively limited beyond its engagement
in the Yamal liquefied natural gas project.]{.underline} Moreover,
[China's ambition for a so-called Polar Silk Road through the Arctic
Ocean has yet to result in any substantial shipment of goods through
Arctic waters. Regarding military activities]{.underline}, which is the
Pentagon's main concern, **[China has no military presence in the Arctic
beyond brief visits]{.underline}.** Chinese icebreaking research vessels
occasionally operate in the Arctic Ocean, and some of their research
activities may indeed have military value. In early October, Chinese
Coast Guard vessels sailed into the Arctic Ocean for the first time on a
joint patrol with two Russian Border Service ships. [It will take more
than a couple of icebreakers and coast guard vessels to make China a
military player in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[Wider research activity by China in the Arctic]{.underline}, which
members of the U.S. Congress drew attention to recently, clearly may
have a dual-use or purely military purpose. Yet this [should also be
kept in perspective.]{.underline} [While the Chinese Polar Research
Institute has a presence in Ny Alesund on Svalbard]{.underline}, a
Norwegian archipelago, [and on Iceland]{.underline}, this is a [minor
engagement compared to its five independent research stations in
Antarctica]{.underline}. Moreover, [China's lack of military presence
and activity in the Arctic obviously **reduces the military value of any
dual-use research**.]{.underline} This is clearly the case for the land
and sea domains, but perhaps less clear-cut with regard to aerospace
activities.

**China is expected to withdraw from previous Arctic ambitions.**

[China is expected to redefine its Arctic policy -- including an
ambition to become a great polar power by 2030 -- amid growing scrutiny
from far northern countries and a possible US-Russia cooperation deal
for the region, according to experts and insiders.]{.underline}

Beijing put forward its plan for a "Polar Silk Road" -- as a complement
to its massive infrastructure scheme, the Belt and Road Initiative -- in
a 2018 white paper that envisioned greater access to the Arctic's rich
natural resources and a bigger role in its governance.

[China's description of itself in the plan as a "near-Arctic state" --
despite sitting 1,400km (870 miles) south of the Arctic Circle and
having no territory in the region -- raised the suspicions of the US and
its allies,]{.underline} in the midst of intensifying geopolitical
rivalries.

It also provoked a **backlash from the Arctic countries** -- including
Russia, which stretches across more than half of the region's coastline
and has long prioritized maintaining its sovereignty there.

[Since then, China has put more emphasis on science diplomacy --
including a focus on building heavy icebreakers and carrying out polar
observations -- while **largely toning down its other
ambitions**.]{.underline}

According to Marc Lanteigne, a professor of political science at the
Arctic University of Norway, "China has been trying to rework what the
Polar Silk Road is all about and it has also started to take a more
practical approach to the Arctic".

An insider with direct knowledge of the situation, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, noted that Beijing's interest in continuing its
Arctic push had appeared to decline in response to the geopolitical
tensions.

"The Chinese interest was really first announced quite aggressively in
the white paper \[with\] the term near-Arctic state that **everybody
seems to have had problems with**," the insider said.

["Now the Chinese have stopped using that term]{.underline} and I think
we've seen a withdrawal, or a significantly lower Chinese interest in
the Arctic."

The U.S. is a capitalist country, and the principle of confrontation

interests. The costs of competing with China in the Nordic region have
to be calculated and balanced. Confrontation with China can only be

costs are higher than the benefits, [it will be [difficult for the U.S.

profit-seeking properties of capital dictates a strong internal
countervailing force which will make the U.S. tired of dealing with it.
According to the analyses of Hillary Clinton, China has the advantage of
a more powerful political system than the United States, which controls
fewer national resources than China. "We'll never beat China unless 'we

[[The U.S. has no ability to oblige]{.mark} the [Nordic countries to
disengage with China]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Expelling Chinese power from the Arctic]{.underline} and preventing
China from gaining a foothold in the Nordic region [is one of the goals
of U.S. Arctic strategy]{.underline}. In recent years, the U.S. has
strengthened its control over the Nordic countries through military and
intelligence cooperation, constantly forced the Nordic countries to
disengage from China and attempted to exclude China from the Nordic
region while controlling the Nordic countries at the same time. But [the
[complementary economic structures between]{.mark} the [Nordic countries
and China]{.mark} as well as the attractiveness of Chinese funding and
infrastructure technology **[makes disengagement
impractical]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Nordic countries will lose
diplomatic autonomy if they blindly follow the US instruction. They will
miss the opportunity to ride the Chinese development train.

Globally, [it has been the goal of U.S. policymakers to push the U.S.
and its allies to disengage with China]{.underline} in the areas of
economic trade, technology, and education. This aim replicates the Cold
War era when they ganged up and disintegrated the Soviet Union. Some
experts call it the "New Cold War." Such theorists argue that China will
collapse if it is excluded from the current international system and
prevented from benefiting from the world trading system and
technological development -- as what happened with the Soviet Union.
However, [policymakers holding this assumption do not realize the
difference between today's China and the Soviet Union of the Cold War
era. China manufactures large amounts of industrial goods]{.underline}
for the world every day, [and has the largest and most comprehensive
industrial system in the world.]{.underline} **[Even the United States
is not yet able to decouple from China]{.underline}**. Despite
escalating national security tensions, trade between the United States
and China hit a record high in 2022, with the bilateral goods trade
between the countries rising to \$690.6 billion, according to official
U.S. data, topping the previous record of \$658.8 billion in 2018.
Exports to China increased by \$2.4 billion to \$153.8 billion, while
imports of Chinese products rose by \$31.8 billion to \$536.8 billion,
according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.9)

The U.S. sanctions against China inevitably lead to damage to its
allies' economic systems. In President Joe Biden's 2023 State of the
Union address, the U.S. leader announced that it wants to begin a trade
embargo against allies: "Tonight, I'm announcing new standards that all
construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects must be
made in the United States. America-made lumber, glass, gypsum board and
fiber optic cable. American roads, American bridges and American
highways will be made with American products." U.S. alliance policy is
filled with a plethora of inherent contradictions, such as targeting the
embargo on products made by allies -- harming the interests of allies.
Will the U.S. policy succeed in defending "Made in America" and
excluding Chinese and U.S. ally products? History and facts have proved
its failure. As long as China insists on "equality and mutual benefit"
and continues to strengthen the trade ties with the world, and if the
U.S. allies can benefit from trade with China, the policy of containing
and isolating China is doomed to failure. Britain, France, West Germany,
Japan and Canada traded with the Soviet Union despite the Iron Curtain
during the Cold War. There is a similar situation with China today. At
the request of Russia, the UN Security Council held a public meeting on
February 21, 2023 for the Nord Stream gas pipeline explosion of last
September. The convening nations discussed launching an international
investigation of the Nord Stream II explosion. The results of the
investigation may continue to tear apart the US-led Atlantic alliance
system.

[Because the U.S. shares more of the same political-economic values as
the Nordic countries, **[China has never expected the Nordic countries
to side with China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [nor expected the Nordic
countries to betray the United States.]{.underline} [[What China plans
to do is to ignite Nordic countries' ideals for higher standards of
living]{.mark}, to awaken their inspiration for national dignity and
their dream for independent policy making.]{.underline} **[[Nobody can
stop people's aspiration for a better life once it is
ignited]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The elites and populations of the Nordic
countries have the natural right to pursue higher levels of economic
development, higher-level industrial structures and more autonomous
national strategies. [[If the U.S. attempts to]{.mark} forcefully
[separate these countries from China]{.mark}]{.underline}, including
commercial and academic exchanges between both sides, [[it
may]{.underline}]{.mark} instead [[stimulate]{.underline} **[greater
interest in their exchanges with China]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[and
raise the cost of U.S. control over]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[since it is]{.underline} **[impossible
to cut off the Nordic countries from China]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the
information age.

The U.S. Nordic policy will eventually bite back at itself

The U.S. is a capitalist country, and the principle of confrontation
with China in the Nordic region is subject to hegemonic and economic
interests. The costs of competing with China in the Nordic region have
to be calculated and balanced. Confrontation with China can only be
profitable and sustainable if the benefits outweigh the costs. Once the
costs are higher than the benefits, it will be difficult for the U.S. to
sustain the competition. The profit-seeking properties of capital
dictates a strong internal countervailing force which will make the U.S.
tired of dealing with it. According to the analyses of Hillary Clinton,
China has the advantage of a more powerful political system than the
United States, which controls fewer national resources than China.
"We'll never beat China unless 'we take back the means of
production.'"10) China can utilize more resources and compete with the
U.S. at any cost, but the U.S. political system cannot do so. Due to the
political system advantages, China will be the last winner in the Nordic
competing with the U.S.

According to Chinese Taoism, "Reversion is the action of
Tao（反者道之动)", which means that things may develop in the opposite
direction of the will, and that strengths and weaknesses can be
transformed into each other. U.S. Arctic policy is falling into the trap
of "Reversion is the action of Tao" by aggravating friends, helping
adversaries, and hurting itself. The result of oppressing allies and
sacrificing their interests blindly is to push them toward China.

[The U.S. is falling into a trap and vicious cycle. The greater the
effort to boycott China, the greater the price it has to pay and the
greater the loss it will suffe]{.underline}r. Any miscalculation will
push the U.S.' allies toward China, which adhere to the principle of
mutual benefit and win-win. The disastrous effects of U.S. policy are
not visible now, but they will be in the future. [**[The Nordic
countries could maintain and increase cooperation with the
U.S.]{.mark}** rationally, **[while strengthening their ties with China
which adhere to win-win cooperation]{.mark}** and keeping its promises,
and obtain practical benefits and national dignity in the face of power
competition]{.underline}. For the United States, the only way out is to
either give up the vicious competition with China or cooperate with
China to maintain peace and prosperity in the North Atlantic and Arctic.

[S]{.underline}ea, the [S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea, [and China's borders]{.underline} with India and
North Korea.45 The PLA's priorities, as expressed by its shipbuilding
and force design, certainly demonstrate this focus on China's
near-abroad (Taiwan and taking full control of the disputed waters of
the South China Sea in particular). In short, [the closer a region is to
China, the more important it is to Beijing]{.underline}, with Chinese
strategists viewing the world as a series of concentric circles of
decreasing priority. [[Beyond Asia, Chinese attention is given to
Africa, Europe, and then the Americas]{.underline}]{.mark}. While this
means China will risk undertaking provocative actions closer to home,
such as military exercises near Taiwan or the PLA's construction and
fortification of artificial islands in the South China Sea, it does not
mean China will do so in the comparatively distant Arctic.46

[[Given the small Chinese footprint in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}
and hypothetical military threat in or through the Arctic, what accounts
for the vigor with which many political and academic commentators insist
that the United States and its Arctic state allies must mount a military
response to China in the region? [[Narratives]{.mark} tend to
[conflate]{.mark} the more]{.underline} [**[hypothetical]{.underline}**
[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} [that China poses]{.underline} as an
international actor [in the Arctic]{.underline} [[with the]{.underline}
**[real]{.underline}** [risk]{.underline}]{.mark} [that Beijing already
poses as a regional actor in the Pacific]{.underline}. The danger is
that over-inflated or misplaced fears about China's military threat to
and in the Arctic may prove to be a strategic distraction, diverting
Arctic states' attention and defense resources from elsewhere.47 In this
sense, prematurely elevating China to military peer or near-peer
competitor status in the Arctic can divert attention from parts of the
world where the PRC's capabilities and interests actually warrant such
status.

Within the Chinese bureaucracy, the polar regions are formally
categorized as maritime affairs. Accordingly, Beijing's emerging Arctic
strategy is part of China's maritime strategy, and policy documents show
that China's growing Arctic interests reflect the growing importance
that Beijing attaches to maritime affairs.48 China's rapid economic rise
has fueled its military modernization, but sober analysis shows that
very little of this effort has been applied to the Arctic.49 China began
commissioning a series of ice-capable patrol boats in 2016, though these
were not designed for polar ice conditions. China also has two
icebreakers that can work through up to 1.5 meters of ice. These,
however, are unarmed.50 The so-called icebreaker gap between China and
the United States is more the result of commentators attempting to shame
US decision makers into recapitalizing America's own fleet than about
Chinese scientific vessels posing threat. [China has few aircraft that
could reach the Arctic, and the]{.underline} People's Liberation Army
Navy's ([PLAN]{.underline}) [nuclear submarine fleet is small and
ill-equipped for under-ice operations]{.underline}.51 Ultimately, [we
see [China's ability to project military power into the Arctic]{.mark}
as [minimal]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[a fact **unlikely to change in**
]{.mark}**the foreseeable future**]{.underline} [[because of the limited
strategic gains]{.mark} to be had in the region compared to commensurate
energies invested in other parts of the world]{.underline}.52

A rational calculus of the threat that the Chinese military might pose
to Arctic states yields modest risks in even the worst-case scenario. In
2019, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decried China's "pattern of
aggressive behavior" around the world and raised the prospective of PLAN
submarines operating under the ice-cap.53 However, as Adam Lajeunesse
and Tim Choi have argued, the use of North American waters by Chinese
submarines for regular operations is unlikely given the lack of
attractive targets in the region, the danger of moving ballistic missile
submarines (SSBN) through the Bering Strait, the geographical
constraints on Chinese sea control or denial of the region, and the
limitations of the Northwest Passage as a route to move joint forces to
Asian theaters.54

A preoccupation with Chinese icebreakers or even submarines as
capabilities designed to challenge Arctic sovereignty or launch attacks
against the Arctic states may miss the larger picture. Growing strategic
competition between China and the United States affects all the Arctic
states, but the epicenter of their competition remains the Indo-Pacific
region. The danger in overestimating China's Arctic military capability
is that such a narrow fixation draws resources away from the real center
of gravity in Sino-Western competition. Along these lines, Beijing may
anticipate that any display of Chinese military interest or capability
in the region will draw a disproportionate response from the Arctic
states. Accordingly, the Arctic may present an enticing opportunity for
China to feign strategic interest and bait Arctic states to over-invest
in or over-commit capabilities to that region rather than elsewhere in
the world. In short, the Arctic offers potential advantage as a
diversionary theater.55 In contrast to other commentators'
representation of the Arctic as a theater of primary and particular
interest for the Chinese,56 we suggest that Chinese strategy and
behavior in the Arctic are best appreciated as a part of a global
expansion of soft power with specific interests centered around economic
and long-term governance objectives.

Conclusions

[China is a strategic competitor both globally and regionally, [but
Beijing is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not a peer]{.underline}**]{.mark} or
even near peer [[in an Arctic context]{.underline}]{.mark}. To suggest
that China enjoys such status plays into Beijing's desired narrative
about its place as a near-Arctic state with rights and interests
throughout the region. Rather than casting China as this regional peer
competitor and fixating on China as a direct military threat to Arctic
state sovereignty or security, analysts should focus on how Beijing's
Arctic strategy reflects its global objectives[. [China does not have
unlimited resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the level of Beijing's
direct [investment in the Arctic has been
**overstated**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[particularly when it comes to
northern infrastructure development]{.underline}. Although [few Chinese
projects have actually materialized]{.underline}, Western media and
experts have inadvertently played into the narrative that China is a key
(and even essential) economic player across the Arctic, relying on
superficial information and media releases to reinforce China's claims
to relevance. Furthermore, China is certainly not a peer to the United
States or any other Arctic coastal state in the maritime domain. Its
scientific research icebreakers do not have the same presence, impact,
and capabilities as the Arctic state fleets, and its knowledge of the
region naturally lags those states' considerably---even though China has
effectively leveraged its reputation and limited activities to
"normalize" its regional presence.57

That stated, [[commentators]{.mark} have a strong propensity to [focus
on]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[potential]{.underline}**]{.mark} Chinese
[[investments]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Sober analysis]{.underline},
however, [reveals that the [Arctic states have]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[not]{.underline}**]{.mark} blindly or [[naïvely accepted Chinese
investments]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} recent [[trends
suggest a strong sentiment against attempts by Chinese actors to
acquire]{.underline}]{.mark} land or strategic [[infrastructure]{.mark}
in the Arctic]{.underline}.34 A telling example is Chinese real estate
tycoon Huang Nubo's failed 2014 attempt to buy a 218 km2 parcel of land
near Longyearbyen on Svalbard, ostensibly to build a resort for Chinese
tourists. Likewise, Chinese state-owned company General Nice Group's
attempt to purchase a former naval base in Greenland failed three years
later. In 2020, state-owned Shandong Gold Mining announced a deal to buy
TMAC Resources and the Hope Bay mining project in Nunavut, Canada. A
Canadian review deemed it a national security risk, culminating in a
formal rejection in December 2020. These examples are illustrative of a
[wider trend of growing caution among Arctic states and recognition of
the security risks posed by Chinese investment in resource development
projects and infrastructure]{.underline}. However, displeased with these
outcomes, **[[Beijing has been unable to force China's way
in.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

As the circumpolar North steadily pushes away from China's win-win
narrative, Russia remains the one Arctic state still willing to embrace
it. Until 2014, Russia was wary of Beijing's self-described Arctic role,
particularly China's desired place in regional governance structures.35
In the wake of Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent
imposition of Western sanctions, Moscow turned to China for the
investment and markets needed to advance Russia's vital Arctic resource
projects. Moscow has had some success, most clearly the Yamal LNG
project, which is partially owned by China National Petroleum Corp.
(CNPC) (20 percent) and the Silk Road Fund (9.9 percent). Moscow has
also highlighted Russia's growing access to Chinese markets and capital
to counter the perception that Western sanctions have been successful in
damaging or isolating the Russian economy.

[While [China's role in Russia's Arctic]{.mark} economy has]{.underline}
certainly [grown]{.underline} since 2014, [this [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[not representative]{.underline}** [of a broader]{.underline}]{.mark}
[or systemic [Chinese integration]{.mark} into the region]{.underline}.
[Chinese multinational oil companies are loath to run afoul of Western
sanctions]{.underline}, [and China's embrace of Russia has not stopped
those firms from discreetly pulling back from new projects]{.underline}.
Despite Beijing's official position in opposition to sanctions, the
Chinese government seems to recognize the difficulties that it can cause
multinational companies. In March, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs reportedly summoned officials from the three major energy
companies (Sinopec, CNPC, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation
\[CNOOC\]) to review their business ties with Russia and "urged them not
to make any rash moves buying Russian assets."36

Relying on Chinese companies for Arctic development presents other
problems for Russia. While Chinese companies are still engaged in many
of these projects, those state-owned enterprises do not bring the same
capabilities as Western partners. From a technological point of view,
Russia cannot reliably substitute that lost cooperation with Chinese
equivalents. Russian experts have pointed to the partially Chinese-owned
Arctic LNG 2 (CNOOC 10 percent / Polar Silk Road 10 percent) project as
the most affected by the loss of Western engineering and technological
support. Professor Natalia Zubarevich of Moscow State University made it
clear that Russia should not count on China providing these critical
technologies.37

A transactional need to avoid conflict and advance resource projects
(for Russia) and shipping (for China) has driven Russia and China's
cooperative approach to Arctic investment and development. More broadly,
the Arctic is an area where the two powers can demonstrate a degree of
solidarity as part of their continuing economic and strategic conflict
with the United States and the West more broadly. Nevertheless, deep
differences remain---and are likely to become harder to disguise as
Chinese activity in the region increasingly intrudes in traditional
Russian spheres of interest. After all, China does not---and
cannot---accept Russian sovereignty and control over much of the
maritime space that Russia claims as internal waters.38 Connected to
this are questions of China's near-Arctic identity, its economic
development, and its shipping activity in the region, which challenge
Russian sovereignty and can be perceived as usurping Russia's role in
the Arctic as Moscow becomes increasingly tied to, and dependent upon,
China. [[Russia will tolerate China as a partner, but not a peer, in
Arctic development]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The latter would erode
Moscow's strident attempts to legitimize Russia's perceived position as
the primary Arctic power]{.underline}.39

### 2AC -- No China Fill In

#### China wont fill leadership void

Notwithstanding [**[Chinese leaders\' stated]{.mark}** global
vision]{.underline}, the regime\'s diplomacy must serve the interests of
its domestic political economy first and foremost. [[**Filling a**
sudden **void**]{.mark} in global leadership [left by America]{.mark}\'s
withdrawal is **[not necess]{.mark}aril[y]{.mark}** aligned with this
objective.]{.underline} LONDON -- With many commentators eulogizing the
liberal international order that had hitherto underpinned US hegemony,
some are wondering if President Donald Trump has given his Chinese
counterpart, Xi Jinping, a gift. While Trump prizes unpredictability, Xi
aims to position China as a force for global stability. Thus, there is a
widespread [assumption that China will rush to fill the vacuum left by
an increasingly nationalist and isolationist United States. But the
**Chinese leadership has [no interest in filling America's
shoes]{.mark}.** Attempting to do so could cost China dearly just when
it is undertaking a broader economic reorientation at home.]{.underline}
The world may be tired of US interventionism -- and, now, of Trumpian
aggression -- but that does not mean it is ready to welcome an
abstemious superpower. China has studiously avoided becoming involved in
major crises beyond its immediate neighborhood. Though it has proposed
global initiatives on "development," "security," and "civilization," and
articulated a vision of multipolarity in which all countries are treated
equally, its efforts to realize these goals have not gone beyond
economic statecraft. While foreign commentators debate what China's
vision entails -- with some describing it as a potentially benevolent
hegemon, and others as a malevolent one -- [**Chinese authorities** and
intellectuals are **more** immediately **concerned with** weathering the
storm that **Trump** has unleashed.]{.underline} CHINA'S CORE INTERESTS
Independent commentators and Chinese leaders alike have long pondered
the same question: What are China's core national interests? [Viewed
from outside, the answer seems straightforward: **to replace the US** as
global leader. **But pursuing that role may contradict** other core
interests, such as maintaining regime legitimacy and security,
orchestrating a continuous rise in living standards, and reunifying
Taiwan with the mainland. [**These goals** might **bes**]{.mark}**t be
[serve]{.mark}d by [maintaining]{.mark} a cold [peace]{.mark}** with the
US, rather than embracing conflict with it.]{.underline} that being a
global superpower would inevitably draw it into regional conflagrations
that it would prefer to avoid. But China also knows that it has
benefited massively from the relatively stable world economy that the US
and its allies helped bring about. China needs to retain enormous
amounts of resources and manpower domestically to tackle its biggest
challenges. Chinese leaders must manage an economy that is no longer
driven primarily by property development and exports, while preparing
for the possibility that one of its largest trading partners could
descend into total isolation. Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs and
escalatory duties in response to Chinese countermeasures were a wake-up
call. Whatever happens in the trade war, China urgently needs to
rebalance its economy by stimulating greater domestic demand.

### 2AC At: CCP Collapse- Arctic Specific

#### President Xi's adaptive policies and reforms make sure he maintains power despite complaints and international issues---failure in the arctic doesn't cause CCP collapse.

**Ang '22** \[Yuen Yuen Ang, July 2022, professor of political science,
Alfred Chandler Chair of Political Economy at Johns Hopkins University,
Author of *How China Escaped the Poverty Trap* (named one of the "Best
Books of 2017" by Foreign Affairs) and *China's Gilded Age,* Journal of
Democracy, Volume 33, Number 3, pgs. 77-89, "How Resilient is the CCP?",
https://muse.jhu.edu/article/860246, EC\]

The typical formula for authoritarian survival is a four-part mix of
repression, propaganda, patronage, and rigged elections. Since taking
power in 1949, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has consistently
practiced the first three---and during the era following the death of
Mao Zedong in 1976, it honed another source of resilience:
institutionalization. Writing in the Journal of Democracy in 2003,
Andrew Nathan argued that the [[greater stability]{.mark} wrought by
institutionalization had [**made the CCP resilient and helped it to keep
power even as China modernized** and integrated itself into the global
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 Making the process of leadership turnover
orderly and predictable was an especially important feature of
institutionalization; other dimensions included professionalizing the
bureaucracy and allowing greater political participation within selected
spaces. Today, it appears to many that Xi Jinping has ended all this. In
2012, he became paramount oleader of the People\'s Republic of China
(PRC) in the midst of a high-profile corruption scandal that laid bare
the intensity of factional struggles among political elites. In 2018, he
overturned constitutional term limits and is expected to make himself
president of the PRC for a third term and possibly for life at the
upcoming Twentieth Party Congress in October 2022. Under his rule as
general secretary, the CCP has extended its reach into economic and
social policy, domains that had previously been left to the executive
branch led by the premier and the State Council. The limited leeway once
given to political participation in forms such as investigative
journalism has been squeezed down to almost nothing. A personality cult
now revolves around the leader, with \"Xi Jinping Thought\" enshrined in
the constitution and taught to young children in school. \[End Page 77\]
Has institutionalization really ended under Xi? And if so, will the CCP
regime remain a resilient autocracy? While Xi has drastically weakened
dimensions of institutionalization---particularly limits on his own
power---he has not eliminated it. The CCP still commands a high-capacity
bureaucracy that the president and the party can mobilize to execute
their commands, as seen during the covid-19 outbreak. Moreover, despite
his authoritarian turn, [[Xi has not]{.underline}]{.mark} entirely
[[abandoned the **CCP\'s famously adaptive methods of
governance**]{.mark}, including policy experiments]{.underline}. When Xi
runs into problems with no easy solutions---for instance, how to curb
the excesses of capitalism without crushing entrepreneurial
incentives---[[he still]{.mark} exhorts the bureaucracy to [adapt and
experiment]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, he is more repressive
than his predecessors: He has tightened ideological controls on society
and the bureaucracy, punished activists and critics, and stamped out
pockets of freedom that existed prior to 2012. In recent years,
increasing U.S. animosity toward China has given Xi even more ammunition
to rally the CCP and the nation behind him. Just as the CCP\'s formula
for authoritarian resilience has evolved, so too have the risks it
confronts. Under the power-sharing arrangements marking the reform era
from 1978 to 2012, elite corruption enriched factions and threatened to
splinter the CCP. Xi has made it his mission to fight corruption. But
his concentration of personal power has reintroduced the risk of
succession battles. Concentrated power also amplifies the effects of
both good and bad decisions made by the single leader who holds it. When
Xi makes a bad decision, the effects are seismic, felt not only within
the PRC but around the world. Looking Beyond Formal Democratization
Institutionalization rarely features in mainstream literature on
authoritarian survival, except in the study of China and \"soft
autocracies\" in East Asia. Unlike other plainly corrupt and repressive
dictatorships, such as Iraq under Saddam Hussein or Zimbabwe under
Robert Mugabe, post-Mao China is a high-performing authoritarian state
that for forty years running has delivered political stability, economic
growth, public services, and even policy innovations. To understand why
the CCP has been able to deliver these results, one must look beyond
formal democratization to institutional reforms carried out at the
highest level of power and within the bureaucracy. According to Nathan,
the first dimension of institutionalization is norm-bound succession:
Each top leader serves two consecutive terms and then hands power to a
successor. When Jiang Zemin stepped down as CCP general secretary in
2002, \"it was the first time that any leader of a communist nation had
left office without dying or being deposed by a coup,\" Susan Shirk
noted.2 Ten years later, when Hu Jintao retired as CCP general
secretary, PRC president, and Central Military Commission \[End Page
78\] chairman and passed the baton to Xi, it appeared that the CCP had
institutionalized peaceful, predictable transitions of power. Deng
Xiaoping, who led China from 1978 to 1992, championed a second aspect of
institutionalization---meritocracy---promoting bureaucrats based on
performance and thereby helping to limit factionalism and patronage. Mao
demanded fervent shows of loyalty to himself as the means to political
survival and rising in official ranks. Deng, by contrast, insisted that
bureaucrats should be rewarded for solving problems. This shift toward
merit is clearly reflected in the goals assigned to bureaucrats in the
post-Mao period: Economic growth and social stability were at the top of
the list. Students of the PRC have produced a voluminous literature
establishing the links between promotion and performance in the
bureaucracy. Third, the reformist leadership sought to professionalize
the bureaucracy by separating the CCP from the direct management of both
the government and business enterprises. The aim was for decisions to be
guided by economic rationality rather than political ideology. Parallels
can be found in East Asian developmental states: Chalmers Johnson
credited the performance of Japan\'s post-1945 technocracy to its
insulation from the vicissitudes and short-term incentives of electoral
politics.3 In the 1990s, China pursued a wide range of administrative
reforms, including the formal establishment of a civil service in 1993,
followed by the creation of a fleet of new regulatory agencies fit for a
market economy. These efforts steadily built up the bureaucracy\'s
professional and monitoring capacities. Fourth, although [[the
CCP]{.underline}]{.mark} violently suppresses dissent, as part of the
reform push it [[selectively encouraged various]{.mark} \"input
[institutions\" that]{.mark} allowed citizens to express complaints and
seek redress on particular issues---so long as petitioners carefully
avoided challenging the regime as a whole.]{.underline} Examples include
empowering citizens to overturn administrative decisions through the
courts and permitting newspapers to expose corruption and other social
problems. In 1988, the CCP introduced village elections, not for the
sake of promoting Western-style democracy, but rather to defuse local
conflicts by allowing villagers to select their own leaders. According
to Nathan, [these measures [fostered **high citizen trust in the CCP
regime**, thus promoting]{.mark}]{.underline} authoritarian
[[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}.4 To be sure, all these
\"institutionalization\" measures were combined with repression,
censorship, and cooptation of influential and restive groups, as
practiced in other dictatorships. But what clearly distinguished \[End
Page 79\] reform-era China was its delivery of political stability at
the highest level and responsive governance at the street level through
continuous institutional reforms, many of which were initiated by local
governments. [That is why more recent [surveys]{.mark}]{.underline}
conducted by Bruce Dickson [[continue to find \"a surprisingly **high
level of regime support**\" despite \"frustration about a variety of
policy issues]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}5 Did China Really
Institutionalize? For about a quarter-century after the 1989 Tiananmen
crisis, the CCP appeared to have achieved institutionalization, with a
stable method for turning over power at the highest levels. In February
2012, however, a political explosion went off: A henchman of Politburo
member Bo Xilai, a leading contender to head the CCP, fled to the U.S.
consulate in Chengdu with claims about Bo\'s corruption and his
involvement in the 2011 murder of a British businessman. Party leaders
denounced Bo for \"grave violations of party discipline.\" In 2013, a
court found Bo guilty of corruption and sentenced him to life in prison.
With Bo\'s fall came Xi\'s rise. In contrast to the flamboyant Chongqing
party boss, Xi was a low-key figure who seemed a safe choice for the top
spot. Once in office, however, he surprised everyone. He began by
launching the most vigorous anticorruption campaign in CCP history,
removing senior officials and shaking up numerous power-sharing
arrangements. Sidelining the premier and other top leaders, Xi
personally took charge of economic and social policies through special
leading groups, earning him the nickname \"The Chairman of Everything.\"
In November 2021, the CCP Central Committee passed a historic resolution
that called for full implementation of Xi Jinping Thought, cementing
Xi\'s place as the CCP\'s third great leader after Mao and Deng.6 Did
the CCP really institutionalize? Joseph Fewsmith says no. Rules and
professional norms were \"largely quarantined to non-critical parts of
the system,\" he insists, while \"at the core, the struggle for
dominance remained alive and well.\"7 Xi\'s authoritarian turn seems to
have completely demolished the institutionalization thesis. In 2021,
Fewsmith wrote: As is clear now, Xi Jinping has overthrown many of the
norms and practices that have guided the CCP in the reform era,
destroyed the \[consensus-based\] factional system ... constructed a
political system revolving largely around himself, and seems headed for
a third term in office when the 20th Party Congress meets in 2022.8
Contrary to Fewsmith, I argue that reform-era China did
institutionalize---but I hasten to add that power-sharing arrangements
and succession norms in the CCP turned out to be fragile and reversible.
Contrary to Nathan\'s claim that \"political factions today have neither
the power nor, perhaps more importantly, the will to upset the rules
that have been painfully \[End Page 80\] arrived at,\" Xi proved that a
strongman can break these rules. Yet even though Deng\'s efforts to
constrain elites with rules only lasted \"for a while,\" to use
Fewsmith\'s words, the effects of those efforts were revolutionary.9 The
institutionalization drive that began with Deng gave China enough
political stability to anchor its transformation from a poor and
politically torn society into a capitalist powerhouse---in just a single
generation. Furthermore, although Xi has drastically weakened aspects of
institutionalization---particularly limits on his own power---he has not
eliminated institutionalization altogether. At the level of elite
politics, as Nathan pointed out, \"Xi has so far carried out his
consolidation of power within the bounds of existing institutions rather
than by breaking them.\"10 For example, at the Nineteenth Party Congress
in 2017, the CCP maintained the retirement norm of \"seven up, eight
down\" (meaning that those on the seven-member Politburo Standing
Committee who reach the age of 68 must retire). Wang Qishan, whom Xi had
named anticorruption czar, stepped down from the inner Politburo that
year and now holds only the PRC vice-presidency. Consistent with the
impression that the CCP has usurped the authority of the executive
branch, my research finds that under Xi, the share of directives issued
by the CCP Central Committee has risen relative to what it was during
the pre-Xi era, but the State Council still issues the vast majority of
central commands on governance-related matters. Those who equate Xi with
Mao miss a key contrast: While Mao deliberately incited chaos,
[[Xi]{.mark} is a man of order.11 He [wants to **keep some institutions
intact to ensure stability** and strong administrative capacity]{.mark}
under his rule.]{.underline} Weakening Bureaucratic Autonomy One must
also distinguish between institutionalization at the peak of power and
in the bureaucracy. The latter should not be dismissed as
\"non-critical,\" for it is the bureaucracy that implements the commands
coming down from the top and determines whether or not [**[the CCP can
deliver results and weather crises]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is worth
noting that Xi inherited a technocracy that Mao and Deng did not have.
Contrary to the trope that China has consistently had a highly educated
Confucian bureaucracy for thousands of years, Michel Oksenberg estimated
that local leaders in the 1960s had on average only 4.8 years of formal
schooling, due to a century of war, poverty, and Mao\'s
anti-intellectual policies.12

How Stable Is China?

Because **[[the CCP]{.mark} has [maintained]{.mark}]{.underline}**
itself in political [**[power for seven decades]{.underline}** **[and
weathered]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[multiple]{.mark} internal
[upheavals]{.mark} and external challenges]{.underline}**, many scholars
and analysts assume this will continue. Certainly, that **[the party
survived the worldwide crisis of communism in the late
1980s]{.underline}** and early 1990s is remarkable. Communist parties
fell from power across Eastern Europe in 1989 and the ruling Communist
Party of the Soviet Union could not prevent its own demise two years
later.

In the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre of 1989, **[some predicted
the beginning of the end]{.underline}**. At the turn of the century, one
analyst wrote of The Coming Collapse of China. But the CCP has
demonstrated considerable resilience. More recently, a prominent U.S.
scholar caused a sensation when he penned a provocatively titled essay,
"The Coming Chinese Crackup." A year later, the same scholar clarified
that what he forecast was the gradual decline of CCP rule rather than
its imminent disintegration. Most recently, another respected scholar
forecast "China's coming upheaval."

**[The resilience of the ruling CCP and its ability to maintain power
are attributed to a combination of carrots and sticks]{.underline}**.
The foremost "carrot" is **[[China's booming
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which **[[has lifted hundreds of
millions out of poverty]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[The party]{.mark}
also [gets]{.mark} popular [credit for]{.mark} maintaining [law and
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[which is partly driven by the public's
phobia of instability]{.underline}**. Moreover, under CCP rule, **[China
has grown in power]{.underline}** and stature **[on the world stage.
Chinese people take tremendous pride in the fact that [their country is
now considered a great power]{.mark}]{.underline}** and respected by
other countries. **[Credit]{.underline}** **[for China's rising hard and
soft power]{.underline}** **[goes to the CCP]{.underline}**.

**[[The CCP has assembled]{.mark} an impressive "stick": [a
muscular]{.mark}, multilayered, and technologically sophisticated
[coercive apparatus]{.mark}]{.underline}** or "digital
authoritarianism." **[Local public security bure]{.underline}**aus and
People's Armed Police **[are reinforced by closed-circuit television,
informants, and thugs for hire.]{.underline}** All of **[this is
backstopped by the]{.underline}** regular military, the People's
Liberation Army (**[PLA]{.underline}**). Moreover, **[the People's
Militia has been revitalized]{.underline}** in recent years **[and is
mobilized to deal with emergencies]{.underline}**, including social
unrest and natural disasters. **[[The CCP appears]{.mark} to be in a
[strong]{.mark} position]{.underline}**, **[[with an array of
instruments for social control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, it
**[[has deftly handled most challenges]{.mark} and threats in the reform
era.]{.underline}**

The greatest irony of the People's Republic --- as I have written
elsewhere --- is that what the ruling CCP fears most are the people of
China. The CCP is fearful that the people power opposition movements
which shook countries and toppled regimes around the world will inspire
Chinese crowds to take to the streets. The CCP is preoccupied with a
plethora of different groups --- disgruntled workers, irate farmers,
unhappy veterans, disaffected religious groups, and restive ethnic
minorities --- each of which has registered dissatisfaction through
physical demonstrations and online activism in recent years.

**[But the Chinese Communist Party's greatest challenge may not come
from [the people]{.mark}. While Chinese have numerous
complaints]{.underline}** about corruption, pollution, income
inequalities, and other issues, **[most [remain supportive of the
CCP]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### No regime instability or collapse.

Relations. (Yanzhong Huang, 9-8-2020, \"America's Political Immune
System Is Overreacting to China\", *Foreign Policy*,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/08/america-overreacting-to-china-political-immune-system/)

Fallacy 2: It underestimates CCP Strength and Resilience

In identifying the CCP regime as the archrival of the United States,
Secretary **[Pompeo]{.underline}** makes a distinction between it and
the "dynamic, freedom-loving" Chinese people. His belief that CCP does
not represent the Chinese people might in part derived from his 1989
experience, where there was a genuine gap between Eastern European
people and the ruling communist parties. He **[fails to
recognize]{.underline}** **[the extremely strong support CCP receives
from the Chinese society]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[even after factoring
in the possibility that people may hide their actual
feelings]{.underline}** out of fear of government retribution, **[high
level of support of the regime in China was identified by various
opinion surveys]{.underline}**, **[including]{.underline}** a
**[Pew]{.underline}** Global **[Research]{.underline}** in 2014,
**[which found [92 percent of Chinese respondents had confidence in
Xi]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The disengagement thesis also unwittingly uses the Soviet empire to draw
an analogy with China. True, the CCP is "repeating some of the same
mistakes that the Soviet Union made," but **[[the resilience of
China]{.mark}'s authoritarian state [far surpasses]{.mark} that of
[the]{.mark} former [Soviet Union]{.mark}, which it has already
outlasted]{.underline}**. Economic historians remind us that even at its
peak, the Soviet economy produced considerably less than half of the
U.S. GDP. In 2019, however, **[China's GDP already amounted to
two-thirds of the size of the U.S. economy. [The GDP gap continues to
shrink in China's favor]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the second quarter of
this year, **[China registered an economic growth of 3.2 percent
compared to the same period a year ago.]{.underline}**

Furthermore, **[[Beijing has not lost its ability to respond to a
crisis]{.mark} by mobilizing resources]{.underline}** **[and
bureaucratic capacities for high priority]{.underline}**. **[The CCP's
commitment to ensuring its survival has been [clearly demonstrated
during]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19
pandemic. **[The outbreak caused the most severe]{.underline}**
social-political **[crisis]{.underline}** **[since]{.underline}** the
1989 **[Tiananmen]{.underline}** crackdown. **[Instead of allowing the
crisis to become China's]{.underline}** "**[Chernobyl
moment]{.underline}**," however, **[[the CCP turned to]{.mark} a
combination of traditional vehicles of the party-state and
high-[tech]{.mark} means]{.underline}** (e.g., big data and QR codes)
**[[to contain]{.mark} the spread of [the virus]{.mark}]{.underline}**
relatively **[quickly]{.underline}**.

By early April, **[it was clear that Xi had emerged as a winner in the
fight against the outbreak]{.underline}**. A series of national online
surveys of urban residents in China, conducted by the UCSD China Data
Lab, suggested that **[[the pandemic]{.mark} has [beefed up]{.mark}
government [legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. On a scale of 1 to 10,
**[the average level of social trust in the central government
increased]{.underline}** from 8.23 in June 2019 to 8.87 in May 2020. The
percentage of respondents who "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that they
prefer living under China's political system as compared to others
increased, too, from 70 percent in June 2019 to 83 percent in May 2020.

Xi might be a "true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology," as
Secretary Pompeo said, referring to Marxism, but **[the Party nowadays
increasingly relies on nationalism instead of communism alone as a
pillar of its legitimacy. The [failure of the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** effectively **[[handle the
outbreak]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and its "bullying" approach have
[pushed]{.mark} [nationalism]{.mark} and anti-Americanism [to an
all-time high]{.mark} in China]{.underline}**. Social media outlets in
the country are saturated with comments and posts that portray the
United States as a diminishing and hostile power. Social injustice,
political polarization, and policy paralysis are undermining the United
States' role as a beacon of democracy for China. According to the same
UCSD study, Chinese public's views toward the United States in May 2020
were significantly more negative than those in June 2019. **[[A large
percentage]{.mark} of the public, including those who are young and
educated, now dislike]{.underline}** **[and
[despise]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[the U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. **[[There is no]{.mark} natural
[constituency waiting to turn against the Party]{.mark} with the right
prompts.]{.underline}**

Don't get me wrong. I am not suggesting that the Chinese political
system is superior to Western liberal democracies. **[The Chinese
system]{.underline}**, like the Soviet one, **[is]{.underline}**
fundamentally **[flawed]{.underline}** and full of inherent
contradictions. But as former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates reminded
us, the system started to crumble only after Gorbachev took away the
fear and terror it depends on to survive. **[However, Xi is anybody but
Gorbachev,]{.underline}** **[and [there is no indication]{.mark} that
[the Chinese regime will collapse]{.mark} anytime soon]{.underline}**.
That is why we need to keep the competition peaceful and manageable. But
decoupling policy not only risks a new Cold War, but also increases the
chances of an actual war that results from an accidently sparked
conflict involving the two militaries. The United States may still win a
future cold (or even hot) war with China, but the cost would be way too
high to justify considering it a viable policy option.

#### Popular support is [ironclad]{.underline}. 

**Lo 20**, has been a Post columnist since 2012, covering major issues
affecting Hong Kong and the rest of China. A journalist for 25 years, he
has worked for various publications in Hong Kong and Toronto as a news
reporter and editor. He has also lectured in journalism at the

Most Americans think with its democracy, the United States has the best
form of government. China, with its one-party dictatorial state,
communist or otherwise, has the worst form. This is China's Achilles\'
heel and will spell the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).
In reality, **[from [the Chinese]{.mark} people's
perspective]{.underline}** and theirs alone, **[their
[government]{.mark}]{.underline}** today [**[enjoys greater
legitimacy]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
**[popularity]{.underline}** **[than any American]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[or Western [government]{.mark}]{.underline}** with respect to their
own citizens. Consider the latest "Understanding CCP Resilience:
Surveying Chinese Public Opinion Through Time" produced by the Ash
Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at the Harvard Kennedy
School of Government. **[[Based on]{.mark} eight
[surveys]{.mark}]{.underline}** conducted between 2003 and 2016,
**[[and]{.mark} face-to-face [interviews]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[with
more than]{.underline}** **[31,000]{.underline}**
**[Chinese]{.underline}** urban and rural **[residents]{.underline}**,
**[the [satisfaction]{.mark} of the Chinese people with the central
government [was]{.mark}]{.underline}** as high as
**[[93]{.underline}]{.mark}**.1 **[[per cent]{.underline}]{.mark}** in
2016, and that of the other three-level governments -- provinces, cities
and counties -- was more than 70 per cent. By 2016, the Chinese
government as a whole was more popular than at any time in the previous
20 years. But by an almost universal (mis)understanding, the US
government represents the people and their interests while the Chinese
government doesn't. It's this unshakeable presupposition that leads many
outsiders to distinguish between the communist state and the Chinese
people. It turns on the all-important question of political legitimacy
and explains why top US officials nowadays don't refer to the Chinese
government but the Chinese Communist Party. It has become a common
rhetorical strategy for US President Donald Trump, Attorney General
William Barr, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and any number of Pentagon
generals and national security chiefs to draw a line between China's
leaders and its people. I would argue **[it's mainly because of this
unshakeable presupposition among many Westerners]{.underline}** -- and
Hong Kong people -- **[that so many analysts and pundits consistently
get China wrong]{.underline}**. **[Their doom-and-gloom prognosis has
been so consistent that people]{.underline}** who listen to them **[are
unfailingly surprised by how [China]{.mark}, instead of
collapsing]{.underline}**, **[[has achieved the greatest progress in
economic development]{.underline}]{.mark}** and human betterment
**[[in]{.mark} the shortest period of time in [history]{.mark} -- to
become the second-largest economy.]{.underline}** You are free to hate
and despise the Chinese state all you want, but **[[if you think it will
collapse]{.mark} by its own weight]{.underline}** **[[because it lacks
legitimacy]{.mark} or popular support, [you will always be
surprised]{.mark}]{.underline}** and never understand your enemy.

### 2AC -- At: CCP Collapse- Alt Causes

#### Alt Causes to CCP collapse- econ collapse, military coup, civil revolt, etc.

**Hsu '23** (James J.Y. Hsu, retired professor of theoretical physics,
"Scenario of a collapse of the CCP", Sep 29, 2023,
https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2023/09/29/2003806928)
-AGM

[The ultimate end of a situation in which communists are in charge of a
capitalist economy is economic depression, with China's economic woes
the prime example]{.underline}. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) regime
has suspended monthly reports on youth unemployment, which had
previously been at a record high, going beyond 20 percent and rising. It
is often joked about in academic circles that when a national laboratory
has made a great discovery, the institution will quickly call a news
conference to announce it to the world, but when the research has been a
total failure, the institution will keep it under wraps. [The
manifestation of [China's economic depression]{.mark} would most [likely
cause the demise of the CCP, not dissimilar to the]{.mark} collapse of
the [Soviet Union]{.mark}.]{.underline} Less scientific, more
metaphysical predictions came from the prophecies of ancient Chinese
mystical books, Iron Plate Diagrams (鐵板圖) and Tui Bei Tu (推背圖).
Both books appear to predict that [Chinese President Xi Jinping (習近平)
will be the last emperor of the CCP]{.underline}, brought down by his
subordinates. Many of his subordinates have been "forced to disappear,"
including his foreign minister, defense minister and some high-ranking
military officers. Some political observers think Xi actually believes
the prophecies of the two books. [[A military coup, a political coup and
a civil revolt are the three potential major crises Xi
faces.]{.mark}]{.underline} It has been quipped that Chinese military
leaders understand it is easier to attack the Zhongnanhai --- the center
of power in Beijing --- than to cross the Taiwan Strait, just as a
Russian counterpart found it easier to attack Moscow than invade Kyiv.
In immature democracies, military coups often occur, and they even
happen in more mature democracies. There are even some instances of
political coups by high-ranking officials. However, these are the power
games of ruling elites and would not grant democracy to the people.
Worse, coup leaders are, more often than not, more interested in
extending their power beyond the "status quo" at the expense of
constitutions and democracy. [[The CCP has already gone through several
coups,]{.mark} some of them successful, such as Chairman Mao Zedong's
(毛澤東) Cultural Revolution, the overthrow of the gang of four by Deng
Xiaoping (鄧小平), and the failed coup of former Chinese minister of
defense Lin Biao (林彪). It would not be surprising to see another coup
under Xi's watch.]{.underline} In a democratic system, power is already
in the hands of the people, so accommodating revolutionary ideas and
implementing changes requires a grassroots movement. Short of a popular
uprising, China will not become a democratic country anytime soon. [[The
fact that Xi is afraid of military personnel having unnecessary social
contact speaks volumes]{.mark} about how worried [he is about a popular
uprising combining the power of the military]{.mark}, political elites
and the people.]{.underline}

#### Alt causes to CCP collapse & collapse is inevitable

**Jha '23** (Mausam Jha, A journalist covering International Relations,
and Business, "Xi Jinping raises concerns over potential collapse of
Chinese Communist Party: Report", 19 Jul 2023,

-AGM

Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]{.mark} has]{.underline} recently
[[expressed concerns about]{.mark} the [potential collapse of the
Communist Party of China]{.mark}]{.underline} (CCP) [as approximately
[415 million]{.mark} worldwide, [renouncing]{.mark} their [affiliation
with the CCP]{.mark}, including its regiments, teams, and other
associated organizations.]{.underline}

As reported by ANI citing Greek City Times, these mass resignations have
been reported since July 1 of this year.

As per the report, People\'s reaction across the globe has taken the CCP
authorities aback with Xi Jinping in the recent SCO Summit stating that
he is opposed to any country\'s instigation of \"colour revolutions\"
and \"interference in internal matters\" for any reason, according to
the report.

Greek City Times reported that at the SCO summit, Xi said that SCO
member states said that they should be wary of the \"external forces\"
[creating a scenario for the new cold war and creating confrontational
camps. He has been repeatedly issuing warnings regarding the [collapse
of the CCP]{.mark}, which if not dealt with, [seems
**inevitable**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

According to a report from Greek City Times, in 2022, Chinese President
Xi Jinping delivered a speech to a young cadre training class, which has
now been published as an article in the Communist Party of China\'s
journal, \"Seeking Truth.\" In the speech, Xi Jinping expressed his
concern about the potential collapse of the CCP.

Xi Jinping emphasized the significance of adhering to the principles of
Marxism and Communism within the context of Chinese characteristics. He
warned that deviating from these beliefs could lead to a similar
disintegration as seen in the case of the Soviet Union.

[[CCP is]{.mark} reportedly [concerned about]{.mark} the possibility of
[suffering a fate similar to that of the Soviet Union]{.mark}, which
experienced dissolution following a significant wave of people leaving
the party. CCP is becoming increasingly worried due to [a combination of
China\'s worsening internal and external issues, as well as its growing
competition with the international community. China is facing various
challenges on both the economic and social fronts.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 2AC AT: Taiwan War

#### No Taiwan war\-\--Xi is [risk averse]{.underline}. 

**Roy 24**, PhD, Senior Fellow @ the East-West Center in Honolulu.
(Denny, 4-17-2024, \"Why China remains unlikely to invade Taiwan,\" Lowy
Institute,
https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/why-china-remains-unlikely-invade-taiwan)

We cannot know Xi's priorities with certainty. Nevertheless, from what
we can observe, an elective [[war against Taiwan is
**hardly**]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[compelling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
proposition [for Xi]{.underline}'s government.

[Even with China's massive arsenal]{.underline} of modern warships,
combat aircraft and missiles, [[Beijing is **nowhere near** the]{.mark}
level of [superiority that would **guarantee**]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[success]{.underline}]{.mark}**ful invasion [given the probability of
US and Japanese]{.underline} military [resistance]{.underline}. [[Xi
would need to]{.mark} worry about]{.underline} more than
[**[ferry]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} enough [[forces]{.underline}]{.mark}
and their supplies across the Strait [[through the **gauntlet**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Taiwanese, **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[Japanese]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[ships]{.underline}, [missiles]{.underline},
[sub]{.underline}marine[s]{.underline}, [[mines and drones]{.mark}. A
cross-Strait [war would disrupt]{.mark} regional [economic
activity]{.mark}]{.underline}, threatening the livelihoods of millions
of Chinese. [The **[resulting]{.mark}**]{.underline} social
[[**turmoil** could **endanger Xi**]{.mark}'s rule]{.underline}.

[[A]{.mark} Chinese **[blockade]{.mark}**]{.underline} of Taiwan's ports
would be less risky, but [would have disadvantages. Taiwan's government
may]{.underline} choose to [resist. Beijing's action [would
stimulate]{.mark} increased **[anti-China
coop]{.mark}**]{.underline}eration around the world; [China could
expect]{.underline} to suffer **[sanctions]{.underline}** over a long
period. And [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[would have **ample time** to **surge
forces**]{.underline}]{.mark} into the region to assist Taiwan.

Beijing's attempts to intimidate the US government into abandoning
support for Taiwan have failed. [Helping Taiwan to defend itself remains
bipartisan]{.underline} US policy, even supported by Republican Party
politicians who want to stop arming Ukraine. Despite the longstanding US
policy of "strategic ambiguity", President Joe Biden has publicly stated
four times that US forces would intervene in Taiwan's defence.

[Xi doesn't necessarily need to **solve** the **Taiwan** problem during
his tenure to **earn a legacy**]{.underline} in Chinese history. [Xi has
three **huge domestic projects**]{.underline}. The first is [restoring
the primacy]{.underline} and authority [of the]{.underline} Communist
**[Party]{.underline}**, [which]{.underline} prior to Xi's tenure as
general secretary [had suffered a decline in prestige due
to]{.underline} rampant **[corruption]{.underline}**, decentralised
governance and the empowerment of civil society. The
[second]{.underline} is what Xi sees as **[ideological
purification]{.underline}**, including cleansing China of "Western"
ideas and values. [Third]{.underline}, Xi must oversee [the transition
of China's **econ**]{.underline}omy from reliance on exports and
investment in infrastructure to a new model that can maintain robust
growth and advance China from a middle-income [to]{.underline} a
**[high-income]{.underline}** country. Success in [these projects would
be **enough**]{.underline} to secure **[glory for Xi]{.underline}**, who
already enjoys a section in the Party's constitution honouring "Xi
Jinping Thought."

[A **struggling econ**]{.underline}omy [does not make Beijing more
likely to launch a war. China's **[economic
malaise]{.mark}**]{.underline} appears to have
**[[dampened]{.underline}]{.mark}** the Chinese public's
[**[enthusiasm]{.mark}** for a Taiwan campaign. [The **natural
reaction** to]{.mark} a [lack of strength]{.mark} at home [is to be
**more cautious**]{.mark}]{.underline} in foreign affairs, [not **more
aggressive**]{.underline}. Thus, [the appearance of serious issues in
China's economy in 2023 led to Xi trying to **lower
tensions**]{.underline} with the United States, and a direct appeal to
the business community to invest more in China during Xi's visit to
California last year.

Several US commentators and politicians raised alarm about Xi
purportedly "warning" Biden during the California summit that China
plans to forcibly seize Taiwan. A more accurate summary of Xi's remarks
would be that he restated the decades-old mantra that unification will
happen. He gave no timeline, he said he hoped it would occur by peaceful
means, and he denied that his government has a plan to attack Taiwan.

Like any People's Republic paramount leader, [Xi must **repeat the
promise** of eventual unification]{.underline}, build up a military
machine that deters independence, insist that the international
community adheres to the "one China" principle, and maintain pressure on
Taipei to enter negotiations with Beijing. [There is no indication that
Xi's position in China is in jeopardy due to a perception he is not
tough enough toward Taiwan]{.underline}.

[Xi needs merely to avoid Taiwan **declaring**]{.underline} formal
**[independence]{.underline}**. If Taiwan did do so, Xi would probably
opt for war. But [even Taiwanese governments controlled by
the]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**emocratic
**[P]{.underline}**rogressive **[P]{.underline}**arty, which rejects the
idea of Taiwan being part of China, [have shown that they **will not
cross this** line.]{.underline}

[[Xi reached the pinnacle]{.mark} of the Party hierarchy
[through]{.mark} a career of **[careful
positioning]{.mark}**]{.underline} and quiet ruthlessness, [[not]{.mark}
by taking **[grand gambles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Since then, [he has
shown a preference for **grey-zone tactics**]{.mark}. There is
**no**]{.underline} convincing [**reason** to expect him to rush to a
military showdown over Taiwan]{.underline}.

#### China is not equipped in squo to invade Taiwan

**Lee '25** (U-Ming Lee, I write about business, finance, and

[Back in 2022, I laid out why a full-scale invasion of Taiwan would be a
logistical nightmare for China.]{.underline} Doomsayers who argued that
Beijing could "go for it" ignored a basic reality: [invading Taiwan
would require a level of effort from the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) equivalent to the Normandy D-Day landings. To achieve a
successful invasion, the PLA would need to coordinate a massive movement
of men and materiel over several months, all in full view of
surveillance satellites.]{.underline} When (if) it happened, creating a
beachhead in Taiwan would be deadlier than Normandy. [Taiwan has been
preparing for an invasion for decades. Its military will use every inch
of the island's mountainous terrain to turn it into an impregnable
fortress.]{.underline} Launching an invasion of Taiwan would be an
all-in gamble for President Xi Jinping. And Xi Jinping didn't get to
where he is today by being an inveterate gambler. Finally, I highlighted
that China's primary ambition is to regain its millennia-long position
as a pre-eminent global civilisation. [Any large-scale invasion would
horrify the world, undoing China's decades-long soft power efforts to
rebuild its prestige]{.underline}. [Why would China throw away all its
efforts on a hugely expensive military adventure in Taiwan when it could
bide its time, build its reputation, and potentially merge with Taiwan
peacefully?]{.underline}

#### The People's Liberation Army is falling apart, unable to conduct an invasion

**Lee '25** (U-Ming Lee, I write about business, finance, and

[Since 2022, there has been significant turmoil in the upper echelons of
the PLA, suggesting considerable disagreement between PLA
factions.]{.underline} China has had three defense ministers in as many
years. Two generals who previously served in this post were fired,
investigated for corruption, and expelled from the Communist Party. [The
removal of high-ranking ministers followed a purge of nine generals,
several of whom led the PLA Rocket Force, with operational control of
China's missile and nuclear capabilities.]{.underline} Then, in November
2024, the axe fell on Admiral Miao Hua, a member of the Central Military
Commission and former close protege of Xi Jinping, allegedly for
"disciplinary violations." Miao's defenestration ended his accelerated
move up the ranks, which began in 2014, thanks to his close relationship
with Xi Jinping. Xi Jinping's willingness to purge erstwhile loyalists
implies the top ranks of the PLA are tainted with factionalism or
corruption. [Bloomberg News has previously cited intelligence reports
claiming that corruption is rife in the PLA. Several nuclear-capable
missiles were filled with water instead of fuel, while malfunctioning
silo lids could prevent the launch of ICBMs.]{.underline} Whether the
PLA is experiencing factionalism or corruption, or some combination of
both, the conclusion is the same. [President Xi Jinping is less likely
to contemplate military action than would otherwise have been the
case.]{.underline}

A Coast Guard cutter spotted the ships during a routine patrol of the
Bering Sea, north of Alaska: a guided missile cruiser and two smaller
ships from China, traveling in formation with four ships from Russia.
The cutter followed until they split up and dispersed. The ships broke
no rules and violated no boundaries. But their appearance so close to
the Arctic this past fall raised concern in Washington nonetheless. For
years, [China has worked to establish footholds in the
region]{.underline} that would give it access to rich mineral deposits
and shipping lanes, as well as a greater say in Arctic affairs.
That---and a [strategic presence in a region ringed by the United States
and several other NATO countries.]{.underline} Researchers at RAND and
the Swedish Defence Research Agency looked at where China is operating
in the Arctic, what it wants, and what that could mean for regional
security. They concluded that [China has made only limited inroads in
the Arctic,]{.underline} but that\'s not for lack of trying. "**[The
threat should not be inflated]{.underline}**," said Stephanie Pezard, a
senior political scientist at RAND who specializes in Arctic security.
"But at the same time, they have a clear intent to not be excluded from
Arctic developments as the region becomes more accessible. The real
questions are, How much of a role do they want, and what does that mean
for an Arctic nation like the United States?" Conditions in the Arctic
have always been so extreme, the distances so vast, that even rivals
like the United States and Russia were forced to cooperate there. But
the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere else on the planet. Sea
routes that sailors and explorers have dreamed about for centuries are
starting to open. The promise of Arctic riches---oil, minerals, trade
routes, even fish---has started to draw interest from far outside the
northern latitudes. China has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," a
designation it invented to push for a greater role in Arctic governance.
It has dispatched research expeditions, sought to establish mining and
gas operations, and envisioned a network of shipping routes crossing the
Arctic, a "silk road on ice." It describes itself as an "active
participant, builder, and contributor in Arctic affairs," one that has
"spared no efforts to contribute its wisdom to the development of the
Arctic region." But in the Arctic, as in the rest of the world, the
[United States sees China as a potentially destabilizing
force,]{.underline} with the economic and military power to try to bend
the established order to its liking. The Pentagon considers China its
"pacing challenge" of the foreseeable future. Its Arctic strategy,
released in October, pays particular attention to the risk of China
using commercial or scientific access to the Arctic for military
advantage. [Researchers at RAND set out to document known Chinese
activities in the North American Arctic]{.underline}, which touches
Alaska, Canada, and Greenland. Their counterparts in Sweden focused on
the European side, from Iceland, through the Nordic countries, to
Russia. What they found: Especially in the North American Arctic,
"[there\'s not a ton going on]{.underline}," Pezard said. China has
invested in a handful of mining operations, mostly chasing valuable rare
earth minerals. It has trade partnerships with Greenland and a small
stake in a zinc mine in Alaska. A Chinese company tried to buy a
shuttered U.S. Navy base in Greenland, but the Danish government quashed
the idea. China has used loans and infrastructure deals to prop open the
door for itself in countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. But
the countries of the North American Arctic have generally taken a hard
look at any proposed Chinese investments---and often a hard pass. Canada
blocked a \$150 million gold mine deal that would have put Chinese
interests too close to military installations. Greenland has held up
plans for another Chinese mine over concerns about pollution. "[We
didn\'t see the more nefarious activities that we\'ve seen in other
parts of the world]{.underline}, like predatory lending or influence
over local decisions, that are more damaging to international norms,"
said Stephen Flanagan, an adjunct senior fellow at RAND and former
senior director for defense policy and strategy at the U.S. National
Security Council. "All of the governments are being careful in how they
deal with China. It\'s a \'buyer beware\' approach." RAND\'s study did
not include the Russian side of the Arctic. That may be China\'s best
route to greater Arctic influence. The Arctic Council, a governing body
of Arctic States and indigenous nations, suspended its meetings last
year, refusing to engage with Russia after it attacked Ukraine. A panel
of experts that RAND convened for its study noted that Russia could seek
to form its own Arctic governing council, with a more central role for
its ally, China. The experts thought that was possible, but not
necessarily probable. Despite its joint operation in the Bering Sea this
past fall, and codevelopment of a natural gas project in the Russian
Arctic, Moscow has also been wary of letting China pursue its ambitions
so close to its home shores. And rather than walk away from the existing
council, Russia has called for it to resume its meetings, with Russia
back at the table. For now, **[the U.S. should continue to make the
Arctic a diplomatic, economic, and strategic priority, to demonstrate
its commitment to the region]{.underline}** and its people, researchers
concluded. It should work to strengthen solidarity among its Arctic
allies---and explore conditions under which it could restart some
engagement with Russia, such as on search-and-rescue preparedness. But
the [U.S. should also recognize that engaging with China in the Arctic
does not have to be a win-or-lose proposition. There are opportunities
to cooperate]{.underline}---on climate change, for example, or pollution
control. China has already played a key role in international agreements
to protect Arctic fisheries and to create maritime shipping regulations.
On paper, at least, both **[China and the United States are committed to
ensuring the Arctic remains a region of peace and
stability.]{.underline}**

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[shouldn't manage]{.mark} the [competition with China**; it should
win**]{.mark} it.]{.underline} [[Beijing]{.mark} is [pursuing]{.mark} a
raft of global initiatives designed to disintegrate the West and usher
in an [antidemocratic order]{.mark}. It is [underwriting]{.mark}
expansionist **[dictatorships]{.mark}** in [Russia]{.mark},
[Iran]{.mark}, [No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea,
[and [Venezuela]{.mark}. I]{.underline}t has more than [[doubled its
**nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}]{.mark} since 2020 [and is [building
up]{.mark} its [conventional forces]{.mark} faster than any country has
since World War II. These actions show that China isn't aiming for a
stalemate. Neither should America.]{.underline}

What would winning look like? China's communist rulers would give up
trying to prevail in a hot or cold conflict with the United States and
its friends. And the Chinese people---from ruling elites to everyday
citizens---would find inspiration to explore new models of development
and governance that don't rely on repression at home and compulsive
hostility abroad.

In addition to having greater clarity about its end goal, the United
States needs to accept that achieving it will require greater friction
in U.S.-Chinese relations. [[Washington]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} to
adopt rhetoric and [policies that]{.mark} may feel uncomfortably
confrontational but in fact are necessary to [reestablish
boundaries]{.mark} that Beijing and its acolytes are
violating.]{.underline} That means imposing costs on Chinese leader Xi
Jinping for his policy of fostering global chaos. It means speaking with
candor about the ways China is hurting U.S. interests. It means rapidly
increasing U.S. defense capabilities to achieve unmistakable qualitative
advantages over Beijing. It means severing China's access to Western
technology and frustrating Xi's efforts to convert his country's wealth
into military power. And it means pursuing intensive diplomacy with
Beijing only from a position of American strength, as perceived by both
Washington and Beijing.

No country should relish waging another cold war. Yet a [[cold war is
already being waged]{.mark} against the United States [by China's
leaders. Rather than denying]{.mark} the existence of this [struggle,
Washington should own it]{.mark} and win it. [Lukewarm
statements]{.mark} that pretend as if there is no cold war perversely
[court]{.mark} a **[hot war]{.mark}**; they **[signal
complacency]{.mark}** to the American people and conciliation to Chinese
leaders]{.underline}. Like the original Cold War, the new cold war will
not be won through half measures or timid rhetoric. Victory requires
openly admitting that [a **[totalitarian regime]{.mark}** that
**[commits genocide, fuels conflict]{.mark}**, and **[threatens
war]{.mark}** will never be a reliable partner.]{.underline} Like the
discredited détente policies that Washington adopted in the 1970s to
deal with the Soviet Union, the current approach will yield little
cooperation from Chinese leaders while fortifying their conviction that
they can destabilize the world with impunity.

BIDEN'S NEW BASELINE

The administration's China policy initially showed promise. President
Joe Biden maintained the tariffs that President Donald Trump had imposed
on Chinese exports in response to the rampant theft of U.S. intellectual
property. He renewed, with some adjustments, the executive orders Trump
had issued to restrict investment in certain companies affiliated with
the Chinese military and to block the import of Chinese technologies
deemed a national security threat. In a particularly important step, in
October 2022, Biden significantly expanded the Trump administration's
controls on the export of high-end semiconductors and the equipment used
to make them, slowing Beijing's plans to dominate the manufacturing of
advanced microchips. Across Asia, Biden's diplomats pulled longtime
allies and newer partners closer together. They organized the first
summits of the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, bringing
together the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States,
and convened high-profile trilateral summits with the leaders of Japan
and South Korea. Biden also unveiled AUKUS, a defense pact among
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

As it turned out, however, aggression would come from the opposite
direction, in Europe. Less than three weeks before invading Ukraine,
Russian President Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[signed
a]{.mark} "no limits" [security pact with Xi]{.mark} in
Beijing.]{.underline} In a prudent step after the invasion, Biden drew a
redline by warning Xi in a video call that the U.S. government would
impose sweeping sanctions if China provided "material support" to
Moscow. [[Xi]{.mark} nonetheless [found]{.mark} plenty of [ways to
support]{.mark} the **[Russian war machine,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[sending semiconductors, unarmed drones, gunpowder, and other wares.
China also supplied Moscow with badly needed money in exchange for major
shipments of Russian oil. Chinese officials]{.underline}, according to
the U.S. State Department, [even spent more money on pro-Russian
propaganda worldwide than Russia itself was spending.]{.underline}

[Beijing was also [coordinating]{.mark} more closely [with Iran and
No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea[, even [as those
regimes sent]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark} to help Moscow wage war in
Europe.]{.underline} Yet Washington was pursuing siloed
policies---simultaneously resisting Russia, appeasing Iran, containing
North Korea, and pursuing a mix of rivalry and engagement with
China---that added up to something manifestly incoherent. Indeed, the
situation that Xi had forecast at the start of the Biden administration
was becoming a reality: "The most important characteristic of the world
is, in a word, 'chaos,' and this trend appears likely to continue," Xi
told a seminar of high-level Communist Party officials in January 2021.
Xi made clear that this was a useful development for China. "The times
and trends are on our side," he said, adding, "Overall, the
opportunities outweigh the challenges." By March 2023, Xi had revealed
that he saw himself not just as a beneficiary of worldwide turmoil but
also as one of its architects. "Right now, there are changes, the likes
of which we haven't seen for 100 years," he said to Putin on camera
while wrapping up a visit to the Kremlin. "And we are the ones driving
these changes together."

If ever the time was ripe to call out Beijing for fomenting chaos and to
start systematically imposing costs on the country in response, it was
early 2023. Biden, inexplicably, was doing the opposite. On February 1,
residents of Montana spotted a massive, white sphere drifting eastward.
The administration was already tracking the Chinese spy balloon but had
been planning to let it pass overhead without notifying the public.
Under political pressure, Biden ordered the balloon shot down once it
reached the Atlantic Ocean, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken
postponed a scheduled trip to Beijing to protest the intrusion. Press
reports suggested the administration had kept quiet about the balloon in
order to gather intelligence about it. But a troubling pattern of
downplaying affronts by Beijing would persist in other contexts.

In June 2023, leaks to the press revealed that Beijing, in a remarkable
echo of the Cold War, was planning to build a joint military training
base in Cuba and had already developed a signals intelligence facility
there targeting the United States. After a National Security Council
spokesperson called reports about the spy facility inaccurate, a White
House official speaking anonymously to the press minimized them by
suggesting that Chinese spying from Cuba was "not a new development."
The administration also greeted with a shrug new evidence suggesting
that COVID-19 may have initially spread after it accidentally leaked
from a Chinese laboratory. If the virus, which has led to the deaths of
an estimated 27 million people worldwide, turns out to have been
artificially enhanced before it escaped, the revelation would mark a
turning point in human history on par with the advent of nuclear
weapons---a situation that already cries out for U.S. leadership to
govern dangerous biological research worldwide.

In the spring of 2023, as Beijing's actions grew bolder, Biden initiated
what the White House termed an "all hands on deck" diplomatic
campaign---not to impose costs on Beijing but to flatter it by
dispatching five cabinet-level U.S. officials to China from May to
August. Blinken's June meeting with Xi symbolized the dynamic. Whereas
Xi had sat amiably alongside the billionaire Bill Gates just days
earlier, the U.S. secretary of state was seated off to the side as Xi
held forth from the head of a table at the Great Hall of the People. For
the first time in years, Xi appeared to have successfully positioned the
United States as supplicant in the bilateral relationship.

What did the United States get in return for all this diplomacy? In the
Biden administration's tally, the benefits included a promise by Beijing
to resume military-to-military talks (which Beijing had unilaterally
suspended), a new dialogue on the responsible use of artificial
intelligence (technology that Beijing is already weaponizing against the
American people by spreading fake images and other propaganda on social
media), and tentative cooperation to stem the flood of precursor
chemicals fueling the fentanyl crisis in the United States (chemicals
that are supplied mainly by Chinese companies).

Any doubts that Xi saw the American posture as one of weakness were
dispelled after Hamas's October 7 massacre in Israel. Beijing exploited
the attack by serving up endless anti-Israeli and anti-American
propaganda through TikTok, whose algorithms are subject to control by
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Chinese diplomats, like Russian ones,
met with Hamas's leaders and provided diplomatic cover for the terrorist
group, vetoing UN Security Council resolutions that would have condemned
Hamas. And there is little sign Beijing has done anything, despite
Washington's requests, to help rein in attacks carried out by the
Houthis on commercial vessels and U.S. warships in the Red Sea---attacks
conducted by the Yemeni rebel group using Iranian missiles, including
ones with technology pioneered by China. (Chinese ships, unsurprisingly,
are usually granted free passage through the kill zone.)

Whether Xi is acting opportunistically or according to a grand
design---or, almost certainly, both---it is clear he sees advantage in
stoking crises that he hopes will exhaust the United States and its
allies. In a sobering Oval Office address in mid-October, Biden seemed
to grasp the severity of the situation. "We're facing an inflection
point in history---one of those moments where the decisions we make
today are going to determine the future for decades to come," he said.
Yet bizarrely---indeed, provocatively---he made no mention of China, the
chief sponsor of the aggressors he did call out in the speech: Iran,
North Korea, and Russia. Through omission, Biden gave Beijing a pass.

THAT '70S SHOW

The current moment bears an uncanny resemblance to the 1970s. The Soviet
Union was undermining U.S. interests across the world, offering no
warning of its ally Egypt's 1973 surprise attack on Israel; aiding
communists in Angola, Portugal, and Vietnam; and rapidly expanding its
nuclear arsenal and investing heavily in its conventional military.
These were the bitter fruits of détente---a set of policies pioneered by
President Richard Nixon and his top foreign policy adviser, Henry
Kissinger, who stayed on and continued the approach under President
Gerald Ford. By using pressure and inducement, as well as downplaying
ideological differences, the United States tried to lure the Russians
into a stable equilibrium of global power. Under détente, Washington
slashed defense spending and soft-pedaled Moscow's human rights
affronts. The working assumption was that the Soviet Union's appetite
for destabilizing actions abroad would somehow be self-limiting.

But the Russians had their own ideas about the utility of détente. As
the historian John Lewis Gaddis observed, the Soviets "might have viewed
détente as their own instrument for inducing complacency in the West
while they finished assembling the ultimate means of applying
pressure---their emergence as a full-scale military rival of the United
States." Nixon and Kissinger thought détente would secure Soviet help in
managing crises around the world and, as Gaddis put it, "enmesh the
U.S.S.R. in a network of economic relationships that would make it
difficult, if not impossible, for the Russians to take actions in the
future detrimental to Western interests." But the policy failed to
achieve its goals.

President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1977 intending to keep
détente in place, but the policy didn't work for him either. His attempt
to "de-link" Soviet actions that hurt U.S. interests from Soviet
cooperation on arms control ultimately yielded setbacks in both
categories. The Soviets became more aggressive globally, and a wary U.S.
Congress, having lost faith in Moscow's sincerity, declined to ratify
SALT II, the arms control treaty that Carter's team had painstakingly
negotiated. Meanwhile, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security
adviser, had grown increasingly skeptical of détente. Brzezinski felt
that a turning point had come in 1978, after the Soviets sponsored
thousands of Cuban soldiers to wage violent revolution in the Horn of
Africa, supporting Ethiopia in its war with Somalia. The Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan the following year was "the final nail in the coffin" for
arms control talks, Brzezinski wrote in his journal---and for the
broader policy of détente.

By the time President Ronald Reagan entered the White House, in 1981,
Nixon and Kissinger's invention was on its last legs. "Détente's been a
one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its aims,"
Reagan stated flatly in his first press conference as president,
effectively burying the concept.

Reagan sought to win, not merely manage, the Cold War. In a sharp
departure from his immediate predecessors, he spoke candidly about the
nature of the Soviet threat, recognizing that autocrats often bully
democracies into silence by depicting honesty as a form of aggression.
In 1987, when Reagan was preparing to give a speech within sight of the
Berlin Wall, some of his aides begged him to remove a phrase they found
gratuitously provocative. Wisely, he overruled them and delivered the
most iconic line of his presidency: "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall."

THE SMOKELESS WAR

Washington must adopt a similar attitude today and try harder to
disseminate truthful information within China itself and to make it
possible for Chinese citizens to communicate securely with one another.
Tearing down---or at least blowing holes in---the "Great Firewall" of
China must become as central to Washington's approach today as removing
the Berlin Wall was for Reagan's.

[[Beijing is waging a bitter info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark} against
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates---which is losing, despite
its natural advantages. [[Xi and]{.mark} his inner [circle see]{.mark}

(PRC) [have become a]{.underline} comprehensive [**[challenge]{.mark}**
for the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates. [China's **Machiavellian
policies**]{.underline} and actions [at home and abroad have turned
a]{.underline}n otherwise naturally complementary
[Sino-American]{.underline} economic [relationship into a]{.underline}
near **[zero-sum]{.underline}**, if not already a zero-sum, [competition

[**[primacy]{.mark}**. Beijing]{.underline} now [openly **flexes

beyond [[to]{.mark} resist]{.underline}, reduce, [and
**[replace]{.mark}** American **leadership**]{.underline} and presence

**[international]{.mark}**]{.underline} economic [[**order** and]{.mark}
American-anchored **collective [security]{.mark}**
arrangements]{.underline}. The PRC has been burning billions, for
example, hoping to replace the U.S. dollar with the over-printed Chinese
Renminbi (RMB). Extraordinarily heavy extraction of its own economy, the
world's second largest, and its enormous foreign currency reserve
resulting from the gross imbalance in U.S.-China trade have enabled the
PRC to massively expand its military. That military is already the
world's second largest; its navy, for example, is projected to soon
surpass the U.S. Navy in fleet tonnage. At the same time, massive but
opaque spending sprees has allowed the PRC to actively procure power and
proxies even inside the United States, positioning Beijing to reshape
international opinions and norms more easily than ever. What is less
known, perhaps, is that [the **rising [PRC]{.mark}**]{.underline} state
also [[seeks an **overhaul** of]{.mark} the **very world order**
that]{.underline} has [enabled the **greatest advances** of human
civilization]{.underline} over the past few centuries -- [the
Westphalian system of **[nation-states]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
world order was codified in the 17th century, expanded to a global scale
in the 20th century, and now is in its post-World War II and post-Cold
War iteration --- [the so-called **America-led L**]{.underline}iberal
**[I]{.underline}**nternational **[O]{.underline}**rder (LIO). [The rise
of Chinese power, under the **autocracy** of the
**C**]{.underline}hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty (CCP), [is not just contesting]{.underline} U.S.
national security and [American global leadership but]{.underline} also
[the **existing world order**. Never since the heyday of the Cold War
has the world seen such a **full challenge** to the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} to
[the Westphalian system]{.underline}. [The CCP is leading]{.underline}
the PRC [toward]{.underline} a Chinese Dream of a world order in its own
image, which I call [the **China Order**]{.underline}. The China Order
is a millennia-old political tradition and ideology that mandates [a
unitary, authoritarian]{.underline} (often totalitarian), [omnipotent
and omnipresent government for the **whole**]{.underline} known
**[world]{.underline}**. This alternative world order has had a variety
of euphemisms in the long history of China: from tinaxia yitong
(unification of all under heaven) and shijie datong (world's grand
harmony) in the imperial past, to Mao Zedong's world solidarity for
Communist revolution only forty years ago, to now Xi Jinping's community
of common human destiny. The China Order has powerfully revived to guide
rising PRC power, under the banner of a Chinese version of
globalization, ingeniously taking advantage of the various calls in our
time for [global [governance]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[address]{.mark}
**transnational issues** such as **[climate]{.mark} change**,
[**inequality**, **epidemics**, and **terrorism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[This [China]{.mark} Order is]{.underline} normatively and practically
[[at]{.mark} **fundamental [odds]{.mark}** [with the
**LIO**]{.mark}]{.underline} version of the Westphalia system [that
enshrines]{.underline} comparison and competition among [nations
**coexisting** with equal sovereignty]{.underline}. The China Order has
been widely addictive to the powerful and ambitious in history, whether
they have been ethnically Han or not. It has been highly effective in
practice, in great part because it became deeply legitimized and
internalized in elite Chinese culture over many centuries. The China
Order is now the sole acceptable model of the world under the
authoritarianism known as the Qin-Han polity that the PRC now practices.
But under this world order, as documented by [The China
Order]{.underline} (#ad), human civilization [is socio-economically very
**suboptimal** and **hopelessly stagnant**]{.underline}, inevitably
shortchanging the lives of just about everyone, especially nonelites, as
the tragic and often catastrophic history of Eastern Eurasia under the
China Order before the nineteenth century amply demonstrates. Since
1949, when the PRC restored traditional Chinese autocracy under the
guise of imported Marxism-Leninism, [the CCP has been
**ceaselessly**]{.underline} and callously [fighting its **own people**
internally and the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
**American allies**]{.underline} externally [to preserve its monopoly
**over power**. Only **sheer exhaustion**]{.underline} and near collapse
[could force the CCP to **slow down** and **retreat**]{.underline}, at
home and abroad. External powers have influenced and facilitated the
rise of PRC power, but have so far failed to transform the Qin-Han
autocracy and its China Order ideal, thus remaining unable to change
Beijing's world views and global pursuits. Various, often false,
[rationalizations have justified]{.underline} the continuation of
[American]{.underline}/Western [engagement with the PRC,
which]{.underline} has greatly enriched and [**enabled** the CCP to
persist in its **[consolidation]{.mark} of power**. Beijing's push for
power [is]{.mark}]{.underline} nothing personal; it is [a brand of
authoritarianism]{.underline} just happens to be [[**anchored**
in]{.mark} the]{.underline} remarkably persistent [[belief that
**failing**]{.mark} **to achieve control** over the whole]{.underline}
known [world [would spell]{.mark} the loss of the "mandate of heaven"
and **political [extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, the CCP is
driven (or doomed) to methodically and opportunistically seek ever
greater influence. [The **[rise]{.mark} of China**]{.underline}, or more
precisely the ever-greater power of the PRC state, [represents a shift
of the distribution]{.underline} and concentration [of power in the
international system]{.underline} (conceptually known as power
transition) [and an effort to **reorder the units**]{.underline} in the
system [and change the system's **governing norms**. Chinese
leaders]{.underline} have already **[openly claimed]{.underline}** that
[they are]{.underline} now moving to [the center of the world stage,
leading a revolutionary change in]{.underline} the [world order,
**[upending]{.mark}** the **Peace of [Westphalia]{.mark}**]{.underline}
established "four hundred years ago," in the words of PRC leaders [This
points to a systemic change of world politics]{.underline} and a choice
for all of us at the grandest possible scale: a scale [that could
reshape nations [and **redirect**]{.mark} **the path** of **human
[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The PRC's challenge is therefore
greater than the struggle between the two European ideologies of
Capitalism and Communism. [The confrontation between the **U.S.-led
LIO** and the PRC-dreamed **China Order** transcends]{.underline} these
often vaguely defined [civilizational clashes]{.underline}. If the PRC
challenge, the rise of an unscrupulous, ever more resourceful and
determined PRC state, is not managed well and promptly, [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[will]{.mark} have to [face]{.mark}]{.underline} a much worse choice in
the not too distant future between tragic capitulation and a
[**desperate [war]{.mark}** for its national security [and]{.mark}
**world leadership**]{.underline} and for the way in which humankind is
organized worldwide. [In the age of]{.underline} many kinds of
**[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction, this will be a harrowing
decision. Of course, one may argue that the grandiose China Dream of a
China Order may be just another pretentious way for the CCP to invoke
traditional, nationalist, and populist ideals to justify its autocratic
governance of the Chinese people forever, similar to the splendid
slogans and missions fabricated by many other dictators. Perhaps the
highly insecure CCP leadership is fighting for its survival, not world
domination. However, words have consequences. Propaganda and dilution
often greatly mesmerize and mislead the pretenders themselves. More
importantly, [the CCP has been **steadily following**]{.underline} up
[its words with action]{.underline} and money for years (basically
nonstop since 1949); it has just pledged over 10 times the total sum of
the Marshall Plan (in today's dollars) for its Belt and Road Initiative
alone, for instance. As the logic of the China Order dictates,
[[the]{.mark} rising Chinese [power will **not stop**]{.mark} **short**
of [**unseating** the]{.mark} **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and **reordering the [world]{.mark}**[,
unless]{.mark}]{.underline} Beijing's Qin-Han polity is transformed
and/or [the]{.underline} ever richer and more [powerful PRC is
[checked]{.mark}]{.underline}. The alternatives, [American
**capitulation** or **world war**, are]{.underline} horrific to
contemplate, but [not]{.underline} necessarily [impossible]{.underline}.
Unlike in Hollywood, the "good" guys do not always win necessarily in
the real world. A mighty autocracy that tightly controls one-fifth of
humankind, willfully spends a disproportionately larger portion of the
fruits of the world's second largest economy, and vows (even if only
hypocritically) to reform and reorder the world under its leadership, is
and will always be a mortal challenge to the national security of the
United States. [[America's]{.mark} **global [position]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} way of life, **[world
[peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and the overall world order [all [rest
on]{.mark} how the **[PRC]{.mark} challenge** is
managed]{.underline}---soon.
