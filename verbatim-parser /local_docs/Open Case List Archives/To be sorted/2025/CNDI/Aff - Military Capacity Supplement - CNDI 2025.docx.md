# Aff

## Note

This is a supplement to the existing military aff that talks about
opening shipping lanes in the Arctic.

You clearly can not read all of the impacts of this advantage -- pick
and choose. You can choose to smush this adv with the existing conflict
adv or read it instead (but maybe transfer over one of the
capacity/capability cards). I wouldn't read both this and conflict but
you can certainly read this advantage + missile defeat.

You can dip into the icebreakers aff for some impact extensions.

We did some of the highlighting but you'll need to finish some of it on
your own \<3

Thank you so much to my research group -- Cora, Joy, Kai, Kelly, Kit,

**First,** **Shipping lanes are opening in the Arctic -- that can
reshape global trade and magnify China-Russia cooperation**

**Humpert 25** \[Malte, journalist for High North News, a newspaper
published by the High North Center at Nord University, US Government
Investigates Strategic Importance of Northern Sea Route as Part of Study
on Maritime Chokepoints, pg. lexis, ALB\]

[[The U.S]{.mark}. Government [has identified Russia's Northern Sea
Route as a]{.mark}n emerging and [critical choke point in]{.mark}
international [shipping that could reshape global trade
patterns]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[[As the region\'s waters become ice-free]{.mark} for longer periods,
[the Northern Sea Passage offers a shortcut]{.mark} [between Europe and
Asia]{.mark}, reducing travel time and fuel consumption]{.underline},"
[the Federal Maritime Commission writes]{.underline}.

The commission is an independent agency of the government regulating
oceanborne transportation.

[The FMC further points out that [the opening]{.mark} of the Arctic to
shipping "has [sparked competition]{.mark} over governance, [with Russia
seeking control]{.mark} [over the]{.mark} [shortest maritime
route]{.mark} between Europe and Asia, and imposing fees, while other
nations push for international access]{.underline}."

[The U.S. has thus far not sent any commercial vessels through the
Arctic or along Russia's Northern Sea Route]{.underline}. [Two summers
ago the U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker Healy traveled adjacent to the NSR
but remained outside Russia's exclusive economic zone and territorial
waters]{.underline}.

[[The]{.mark} Northern Sea [Passage\'s strategic importance is]{.mark}
further [amplified by]{.mark} increased [military activity from Russia
and China]{.mark}]{.underline}

In contrast [[commercial shipping companies from]{.mark} both [Russia
and China have gained substantial experience]{.mark} on how to operate
[in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} two [countries have also collaborated on joint Arctic
patrols]{.underline}, including in proximity of Alaska during the summer
of 2024 as well as in the Barents Sea near Norway.

"[The Northern Sea Passage\'s strategic importance is further amplified
by increased military activity from Russia and China, including new
bases and icebreakers,]{.underline}" the FMC writes.

[The research into the NSR is part of a larger study by the agency into
seven global choke points, such as the Suez and Panama Canals as well as
Straits in Gibraltar and Singapore.]{.underline}

Increasing stakes in Arctic

[Some Arctic logistics and security experts have long argued that [the
strategic importance of emerging Arctic shipping lanes is set to
increase]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The FMC is calling for public comment on the study by May 13, 2025. [The
inclusion of the Arctic into this broad investigation into international
maritime chokepoints continues the recent surge of Arctic policy
interest in the U.S]{.underline}.

For much of the past six months President Donald Trump's comments on
Greenland, including visits by one of his sons and Vice President JD
Vance, have perpetually kept the Arctic in the country's news cycle.

While Greenland's mineral wealth is often front and center as to why
Trump is interested in the territory, others point to the island's
central location along potential future Arctic shipping routes.

[As the sea ice continues to recede, a central Arctic shipping route,
referred to as the Transpolar Sea Route, passing along the east coast of
Greenland, could emerge]{.underline}.

The FMC also references the recent increase in naval military activity
along Arctic trade routes.

"\[This\] is reflecting its growing value for nuclear deterrence and
missile defense. As a result, both Russia and NATO forces are ramping up
their military presence, increasing the potential for tensions and
conflicts," the FMC concludes.

#### Second, the deadly combo of receding ice and opening shipping lanes determines the future of the economy, gives Russia and China the ability to topple the liberal international order, and creates an alliance that makes a Russian nuclear attack likely. ONLY THE PLAN SOLVES.

Must Adopt a More Proactive Arctic Strategy," The Arctic Institute,

ALB\]

[The Arctic is insufficiently prioritized amidst the United States'
competing global interests]{.underline}. [The future battlefield is
melting and demands US attention, as a partnership between Russia and
the People's Republic of China fuels strategic competition in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Thus, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must
adopt a proactive Arctic strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}, working with its
NATO Allies [to ensure that the Arctic remains stable and free from
conflict]{.underline}. The US's 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS)
outlines that the United States "seeks a stable Arctic region
characterized by adherence to internationally agreed upon rules and
norms."1) [To achieve a secure Arctic, the 2024 Arctic Strategy,
produced by the U.S. Department of Defense, follows a
"monitor-and-respond" approach]{.underline}. However, [this [reactive
strategy is inadequate]{.mark}.]{.underline}2)

[Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine provides evidence that [Moscow will
not adhere to the current global order]{.mark} and will continue to
challenge Western international norms wherever possible, including in
the Arctic]{.underline}. NATO's growing appeal among European states
suggests that NATO may also be called upon to guarantee the future of
Arctic stability. Instead of dividing Europe, isolating Ukraine, and
expanding its influence, Moscow's invasion of Ukraine has resulted in a
closer alliance between the United States and its Arctic NATO allies.
Moreover, NATO, with the accession of Finland and Sweden, has expanded,
and now seven out of the eight Arctic nations are NATO members. The
alliance offers an opportunity for the United States to strengthen its
position in the Arctic region while not having to go it alone.

[[The current US Arctic Strategy insufficiently counters Russian and
Chinese strategic Arctic ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}, though the
makings of a more effective Arctic Strategy already exist in the pages
of the 2024 Arctic Strategy. Washington must build on this foundation,
shifting its mindset towards the Arctic. A proactive Arctic Strategy is
needed, in which the United States and its NATO partners are not afraid
to define the rules and laws governing the north. [Critics of this
approach will claim that taking a more assertive position in the Arctic
will further antagonize Russia and divert important resources from the
Indo-Pacific region and China. This is simply not the case. Russia and
China have already taken steps to claim and militarize the Arctic. [By
acting now, the US]{.mark} and its NATO allies [will be better
positioned to counter the threat posed by Russia and China in the Arctic
and beyond]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Why the Next War Will Be Won or Lost in the Arctic]{.underline}

[[Climate change has accelerated strategic competition]{.mark} in the
region among both Arctic and non-Arctic nations, such as
China]{.underline}. [Melting sea ice from rising global temperatures has
created new military and economic opportunities in the
region]{.underline}. Since 1979, [the Arctic has warmed four times
faster than the rest of the world]{.underline}, according to an August
2022 scientific study published in Nature.3) [As ice rapidly melts in
the Arctic, increased access to critical rare earth elements, such as
platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel emerge. Moreover, [melting
ice is opening]{.mark} more easily traversed [Arctic waters,]{.mark}
[which has led to a surge of]{.mark} both military and commercial [ship
activity in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} two
[developments have increased the potential for conflict in the
Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Any nation that can effectively mine, process, and refine the materials
will have a strategic advantage]{.underline}. [These minerals are
required for developing technologies ranging from renewable energy
systems to electronics used for national defense]{.underline}. According
to the World Bank, the demand to produce minerals, many of which are
found in the Arctic, could increase by nearly 500 percent by 2050 to
meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies.4) [China already
dominates the global supply chain for critical materials. [The United
States depends on these materials for its economic
competitiveness]{.mark} and national defense]{.underline}.5)

As ice melts, [new routes are emerging that are more navigable. This has
resulted in more ship activity in the region]{.underline}. For instance,
the Arctic Council Working Group on the Protection of the Arctic Marine
Environment reports that there has been a 37 percent increase in ship
numbers and distance sailed in the Arctic over the past ten years.6)
[While much of this activity is commercial, [Russia and China have also
taken advantage of the new sea routes to project their naval
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. They have carried out numerous regional
deployments and patrols, demonstrating their ability to execute military
operations in the austere Arctic climate.7) [The expanded presence of
[Russian and Chinese ships in the region poses a growing threat]{.mark}
to NATO member states]{.underline}. In October 2023, Finnish
investigators suspected the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of dragging
its anchor over the seabed and severing three Baltic telecom cables and
one pipeline. While the international community has not assigned blame
wholly to China, China later admitted to accidentally destroying an
important gas pipeline connecting Finland and Estonia in the Baltic Sea
in 2024. These examples suggest that incidents of this nature could
become more likely as military activity increases in the region.8)

Competition in the Arctic Is Heating Up: Russian and Chinese Ambitions

The growing partnership between Russia and China provides early warning
signs that the region could become a site of future conflict. In 2021
Russia and China renewed their 20-year-old Sino-Russian Treaty of Good
Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, a move described as "an act of
friendship against America."9) Moreover, both Russia and China have deep
historic and economic ties to the Arctic. NATO's expansion to include
Finland and Sweden have increased tensions in the region, while both
Russia and China have expressed their disapproval of NATO's increasing
presence in the Arctic.10) However, despite feeling antagonized by
NATO's actions, [Moscow and Beijing may not have the economic and
military capacities to reshape the current international rules-based
order in the Arctic in the near term.]{.underline}

Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic, [[Russia controls
over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline, making it a decisive player in
the future of the region]{.underline}]{.mark}.11) Yet, Russia's Arctic
ambitions are not new. Russia's connection with the Arctic can be traced
back to the sixteenth century, beginning with its conquest of Siberia,
which was part of a larger initiative to search for resources and trade
routes.12) As the nation matured, its Arctic ambitions did as well.
During the Cold War, the Soviets established both a nuclear and naval
presence on the Kola Peninsula to project power against the U.S. With
the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia, as the de jure inheritor of
the Soviet nuclear arsenal, did not abandon its desire to be an Arctic
power.

As the Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s under Vladimir
Putin, Russia began posturing for Arctic supremacy, reopening multiple
Soviet-era military bases, modernizing its navy, and developing new
hypersonic missiles designed to evade U.S. sensors and defenses.13)
Moreover, in August 2022, Moscow announced that it would refocus its
military power on the Arctic and Nordic region.14) According to Colin
Wall, a research associate at Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington, "The military balance in the Arctic is heavily
weighted towards Russia." Furthermore, the International Institute for
Strategic Studies and Reuters cite that Russia's bases inside the Arctic
Circle outnumber NATO's by roughly a third.15) [[Russia's
remilitarization of the Arctic and its revitalized strategic partnership
with China, provides both countries with the means to challenge the
current Western rules-based international order]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Although China's Arctic history does not mirror Russia's centuries-old
presence in the north, [Beijing's desire for Arctic supremacy has
rapidly evolved over the past century]{.underline}. China's involvement
in the Arctic began in 1925 with the signing of the Svalbard Treaty,
providing a legal basis for China to conduct non-military activity, such
as scientific exploration, resource extraction, and fishing in the
Arctic.16) However, [China's rationale to operate in the region extends
beyond scientific exploration.]{.underline}

In 2018 China released its first Arctic White Paper, which asserts that
it is a "Near-Arctic State."17) China employs a dual narrative to
explain its aims in the Arctic. Externally, Beijing appeals to foreign
audiences by advocating for the safeguarding of international interests
and promoting sustainable Arctic development. However, [this is
juxtaposed against the narrative it promotes for domestic audiences,
which emphasizes competition for resources and China's desire to become
a "polar great power]{.underline}."18) The Svalbard Treaty has currently
enabled China to shroud its military activity and influence in the
Arctic as scientific exploration and global cooperation. But it is
becoming clear from its growing partnership with [[Russia]{.mark} and
increasingly aggressive military [action in the Arctic that China's
intentions to reshape the international system extend well beyond the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. and NATO would be wise to
recognize China's aims in the Arctic.

[The historic ties of Russia and China and their Arctic ambitions reveal
that the Arctic is likely to be an arena for future strategic
competition]{.underline}. Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has
temporarily bolstered the West's position in the Arctic, as previously
neutral Finland and Sweden joined NATO. Finland's accession into NATO
not only increased the NATO-Russia land border by over 650 percent and
moved the defense alliance a mere 250 miles from St. Petersburg, but it
also contributed to creating a divided Arctic, where nearly half belongs
to NATO while the remaining half is Russian territory.

Threatened by the growing alliance, in June 2022, Putin warned that if
U.S.-NATO military contingents or military infrastructure appears in
either Sweden or Finland, Russia will respond "symmetrically" by
deploying nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea region to restore military
balance and strengthen its defenses.19) In February 2023, Putin made
good on this threat and deployed Russian ships armed with tactical
nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea. According to Norway, this was the
first time in 30 years that this has happened.20) Then in June 2024,
Moscow began to train soldiers and sailors to deploy tactical nuclear
weapons in Leningrad, a military district bordering NATO members Norway,
Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.21) As evidenced by
these actions, while Putin is not afraid to rattle the nuclear saber, it
is not likely that Russia has the military or economic capacity to
engage in a direct conventional conflict with NATO.

[NATO leaders recognize that there is a finite window of time to prepare
for conflict against Russia]{.underline}. In 2024 the head of the
Norwegian armed forces warned that NATO countries only have two to three
years to prepare for a Russian attack. Norwegian General Eirik
Kristoffersen claims that Moscow is building up its military stockpile
faster than previously predicted, while Western nations have depleted
their own weapons by supplying them to Ukraine.22) Several other
European leaders have echoed these concerns, citing that they have
between three and eight years to prepare for a Russian attack against
NATO.23) Despite Russia's aggressive rhetoric, Moscow understands that
because of its war against Ukraine it likely will not have the
capability to attack NATO in the near future. For instance, Russia
removed nearly all its ground forces from the Finnish border to Ukraine
in June 2024.24) [[Russia's timeframe to launch a successful attack is
dependent not only on its economy but also on its partnership with the
PRC.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### And, Russia is being hella terrible in Arctic shipping lanes -- cooperation with China [amplifies the potential for conflict]{.underline}

eyes natural resources and shipping routes"
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putins-arctic-ambitions-russia-eyes-natural-resources-and-shipping-routes/)

US President Donald Trump's desire to acquire Greenland from Denmark has
recently [helped to highlight the growing geopolitical importance of the
Arctic region in international affairs. As global temperatures rise and
polar icecaps melt, increased access to Arctic resources and trade
routes look set to make the region and major focus of international
competition in the coming decades.]{.underline} Since the Trump White
House and the Kremlin began negotiations in February 2025 to end the
Russian invasion of Ukraine, potential cooperation between the United
States and Russia in the Arctic has been high on the agenda. However,
the US will face stiff competition from China in this arena, with Arctic
initiatives occupying an important place at the heart of the
strengthening strategic relationship between Beijing and Moscow.

[Maritime strategy has long played a significant role in Russian
President Vladimir Putin's thinking as he works to expand Moscow's
influence on the international stage.]{.underline} In August 2024, Putin
ordered the establishment of a Russian maritime collegium headed by his
close personal ally and advisor Nikolai Patrushev, who formerly led
Russia's FSB security service and the country's National Security
Council.

[The recent creation of a maritime collegium comes at a time when Russia
is accused of engaging in a wide range of hostile naval acts including
the sabotage of undersea cables in the Baltic Sea along with
surveillance activities off the coast of Britain and other NATO member
states. Unsurprisingly, one of the stated goals of the new collegium is
to help secure Russia's national interests in the Arctic.]{.underline}

Russia's Arctic ambitions are similarly evident in the country's current
maritime doctrine. [Russian control over the Northern Sea
Route,]{.underline} which runs through Arctic waters along Russia's
northern coast and serves as the shortest shipping route between Europe
and the Pacific, [is vital for the Kremlin's plans]{.underline}. With
this in mind, [Putin is currently prioritizing an enlarged and
modernized military presence in the Arctic region including enhanced
naval capabilities.]{.underline}

[Moscow sees the Northern Sea Route as part of Russia's national
transport infrastructure and has sought to control access for shipping
from other nations.]{.underline} This is particularly controversial as
the Northern Sea Route covers a vast area that is expected to become
increasingly navigable in the coming years due to changing environmental
conditions. Some of the areas currently claimed by the Kremlin are
situated well beyond the territorial waters of the Russian Federation.

[Critics have argued that Russia's efforts to restrict access to the
Northern Sea Route directly violate the 1982 United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).]{.underline} However, while Russia is a
signatory of the convention and ratified its commitments to UNCLOS in
1997, Kremlin officials say the terms are not applicable to Russia's
maritime claims in the Arctic region. 

[With Russia militarizing along the Northern Sea Route and laying claim
to large parts of the Arctic maritime zone, the scope for potential
future conflict is huge. Geopolitical tensions are likely to be further
heightened by the deepening regional involvement of China in partnership
with Russia. The two nations have identified the Arctic as a key area of
cooperation, both as a trade route linking China to Europe and as a
source of the natural resources that Beijing needs to fuel its
economy.]{.underline}

In the years ahead, [the ports of the Northern Sea Route could become
increasingly important for the projection of Chinese and Russian naval
power on the international stage, both in the Arctic region and
beyond.]{.underline} This could allow both countries to enforce their
claims to Arctic resources and overwhelm other regional nations with
less powerful navies such as Canada, Denmark, and Norway. [This is
leading to security concerns over a number of isolated and vulnerable
islands throughout the region.]{.underline}

[Allowing Russia to gain the ascendancy in the Arctic would lead to
unpredictable geopolitical consequences. Control over the oil and gas
resources of the Arctic region could dramatically increase Russian state
revenues]{.underline}. Past experience indicates that this windfall
[would likely be used by the Kremlin to finance military
spending]{.underline}, potentially [setting the stage for fresh acts of
aggression. Limiting Russian access to the Arctic should therefore be
viewed as matter of international security.]{.underline}

[As the struggle for dominance in the Arctic heats up, it is already
clear that NATO member states need to dramatically strengthen their
presence and capabilities in the region.]{.underline} It would also make
sense to call upon international bodies such as the International Court
of Justice to request clarification regarding the regime that Russia has
arbitrarily established in the waters of the Northern Sea Route.
Ultimately, the goal should be to conclude an international convention
based on UNCLOS and the UN Charter that can prevent today's mounting
tensions from leading to armed conflict in the Arctic. Before that can
happen, [countries]{.underline} with territories that [could potentially
be at risk from an expansionist Russia]{.underline} should look to seek
enhanced security agreements with the United States and other NATO
members that comply with the requirements of international law.

#### And, trade routes are in crisis that undermines US global economic and military leadership -- only the plan rectifies

[Maritime trade channels essential for America's globalized economy lie
in the crossfire of security threats]{.underline}. Examples abound: in
the Middle East, [Iran has seized ships passing through the Strait of
Hormuz]{.underline} and has employed Houthi rebels as proxies in the Bab
el-Mandeb Strait to target commercial vessels and disrupt trade. [The
Suez Canal is threatened by the spillover of regional instability with
the Israel-Hamas war, while the Strait of Malacca is dominated and
increasingly militarized by Beijing]{.underline}. [The common
denominator is clear: global trade routes are under siege and the United
States must look for feasible alternatives]{.underline}.

The United States may turn its attention to the North for alternative
trade routes: [The Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Northwest Passage
(NWP)]{.underline}. [These trade routes are gaining strategic relevance
with the ever faster recession of the Arctic ice shield]{.underline}.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is an Arctic power; its
direct access to the region]{.underline} [and national security
objectives in the Arctic give the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [a say in the region's future]{.underline}.
[However, when it comes to the NSR and NWP, passages used and
administered by Russia and Canada, the U.]{.underline}S. is dependent on
international cooperation and [can only access the existing Arctic trade
routes through international partnerships]{.underline}. [While these
routes are already faster than the Suez or Panama Canal]{.underline},
[ice melt from global warming will open an even more efficient
Transpolar Sea Route (TSR) by mid-century]{.underline}. [This presents a
unique geostrategic opportunity, for which]{.underline} [many nations
will compete]{.underline}. [The United States must enter this
competition and seek to capitalize on the economic potential of
trans-polar trade]{.underline}. [Russia already has a formidable
military presence in the region and has a major]{.underline} economic
and strategic [interest in the TSR]{.underline}. [Moscow continues to
push military capabilities closer to the North Pole, laying claim to the
TSR before it opens up ice-free for international use in the next few
decades]{.underline}.

[The threat of Russia cutting off the United States from the TSR is
a]{.underline}n economic, strategic, and security [challenge that has
received too little attention]{.underline} in Washington, DC. [If the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [does not stifle encroaching
Russian influence in the region now, it might lose its freedom of
commercial navigation in the TSR when it opens up]{.underline} in the
2040s -- the current best estimate, based on the trajectory of ice
melting.

[The United States can shape its engagement in the region]{.underline}
in several ways, however each strategy will have trade-offs. Broadly
speaking, the U.S. may have three objectives in the region: (1) the
avoidance of conflict with, and, where possible, cooperation with
Russia, (2) economic dominance of the TSR, and (3) [greater military
presence near the TSR]{.underline}. Between three possible outcomes and
combinations thereof, only two are ever attainable, with the third
always becoming a casualty. The U.S. thus faces an Arctic Trilemma. ..

What is the way forward? I argue that [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must embrace Great Power Competition and contain
Russia's ambitions in the Arctic by pursuing]{.underline} (2) [economic
dominance of and (3) military presence in the TSR]{.underline}. [The
United States must secure dominance of the TSR through military command
of the sea, and restructure military plans on the strategic,
operational, and tactical levels to contest Russian hegemony in the
Arctic]{.underline}.

The Current Geoeconomic Situation in the Arctic

Trade in the region is economically existential for Russia. Currently,
30% of Russia's GDP can be traced back to the Arctic, and thus, Russia
has a vested interest in securing and developing its commercial assets
in the region. However, it has not always been this way. For centuries,
Indigenous settlers, European explorers, and nation-states have used two
conventional Arctic routes for military, economic, and tourist
activities: the NSR, which hugs the northern coast of Russia, and the
NWP, which rides the North American border and weaves into the Canadian
Arctic Archipelago. The NSR was first used by the Soviet Union to
extract resources and move military equipment from one side of the
nation to the other. The fall of the Soviet Union initially diminished
Russian presence in the Arctic, however Putin's rise precipitated
renewed interest in the NSR. Trade volumes increased by 755% between
2014 and 2022, and Russia plans to further increase trade volumes
tenfold by 2035. As Russia's trade security diminishes in the Black Sea
due to its war in Ukraine, the Arctic is becoming an increasingly
attractive substitute. Furthermore, a ship traveling between Europe and
East Asia takes roughly 30 days to complete the journey via the Suez
Canal but this journey can be reduced to 18 days via the NSR.

Canada is another, yet (much) friendlier geopolitical actor in the
region with control over the NWP, which runs opposite to Russia's NSR.
Dangerous ice coverage on the NWP made passage impossible until the
latter 20th century. Due to global ice melting, induced by accelerating
global warming, the summer of 2007 marked the first time the NWP could
be fully utilized without the concern of icebergs imperiling ships.
While Canada grants access to the United States and its partners, it
claims that the NWP lies in its territorial waters, as Russia does with
the NSR. However, the United States has contested this claim since the
1980s: it posits that under the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (UNCLOS), the NWP is an international strait as the nexus
between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. While the United States
presents the same argument against Russia's NSR, cordial relations with
Canada mean that the U.S. need not contest Canada's claims nearly as
fiercely as the Russian ones. However, if the U.S. presses Canada too
hard and continues to levy demands against its Northern neighbor, the
relationship between the two states may take a toll. Souring cooperation
with a continental ally would cost the United States the benefits of
shorter commercial trips---shaving up to 2,500 nautical miles off total
travel time. The opening of the TSR will simply offer a more
economically viable trade route.

The Opening of the Transpolar Sea Route

The Arctic is warmer than has been at any point over the past 2,000
years. This region is particularly vulnerable to climate change, heating
nearly four times faster than the rest of the Earth since 1979. As a
result, from 1979 to 2010, Arctic ice coverage has fallen by 40%, while
the thickness of the ice has fallen by 70%. Disproportionate and intense
warming is changing the geographical structure of the Arctic.

Figure 1: A map displaying the Northern Sea Route, the Northwest
Passage, and the Transpolar Sea Route -- the three maritime shipping
lanes in the Arctic.

By 2040, this change will open a third maritime trade route called the
Transpolar Sea Route (TSR). The route runs from the North Pacific Ocean
to the North Atlantic Ocean, cutting through the North Pole. The TSR is
different from the NSR and NWP because the bulk of the TSR is not
covered by exclusive economic zones or sovereign territorial waters.
Furthermore, the TSR is undeniably faster. A ship that uses the TSR can
travel through the Arctic one to five days faster than if it used the
NSR, while a ship that normally relies on the Suez Canal could save up
to 41% of its distance. Shorter travel times means a ship can make more
commercial trips, use less fuel, and incur lower operating costs,
thereby generating increased revenue. The TSR is the optimal trade route
in the Arctic.

[While the TSR is not open yet, as the Arctic continues to warm, the
Central Arctic Ocean (CAO) could be navigable by ice-breaking cargo
ships as early as 2030. By 2045, moderate global warming models predict
low enough ice levels in the CAO for standard cargo ships to conduct
commercial activity during summer. The question is not if the CAO, and
by extension the TSR, will open, but rather, how soon? Given the
economic benefits of the TSR, the United States must take steps now to
secure access for its ships before its adversaries]{.underline}.

The Threat Landscape

[While the TSR may not fully open for another 20 years, Russia has
already taken steps to cement its influence in the region]{.underline}.
In July 2022, [Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the Russian
military will defend its claims to the Arctic "by all means"
necessary]{.underline}. Putin has backed his rhetoric with substantive
commitment to the area: Russia has about 33% more military bases in the
Arctic Circle than NATO does. While this may be unsurprising because 53%
of the Arctic coastline is under Russian control, that does not mean
that the United States and NATO partners should accept a position of
regional inferiority.

[Russia has more icebreakers -- valuable military assets that help clear
icy paths for commercial and military ships -- than NATO. The U.S. only
accounts for two icebreakers in NATO's undersized fleet, lagging far
behind its adversary. Icebreakers will be essential in making use of the
TSR as early as the 2030s]{.underline}. [This may seem relatively far
away. But the race begins now. Icebreakers need to be
constructed]{.underline}. [Military bases need to be built. Transit
infrastructure needs to be set up. All of this takes time, and for the
U.S. to be ready when the Arctic becomes accessible, it must lay the
groundwork now]{.underline}.

[Given Russia's military bases and icebreakers, scholars believe that
the West trails 10 years behind Russia militarily in the region. Russia
has established a foothold near the CAO that will give it oversight,
control and area-denial capabilities over the TSR. The U.S. must contest
the aspiring Russian hegemony in order to better position the United
States toward active use of the TSR.]{.underline}

[[The growing alignment between]{.mark} the People's Republic of [China
and]{.mark} the [Russia]{.mark}n Federation [has significant
implications for vital U.S. interests]{.mark} and the interests of U.S.
allies and partners. [Animated by shared grievances against]{.mark} the
configuration of the international order and mutual concerns about
perceived external threats, principally from [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [the Sino-Russian partnership has deepened over the
last decade]{.mark} across the military, economic, and diplomatic
domains. [Beijing and Moscow's strategic alignment will pose a
significant test for the]{.mark} incoming [Trump
administration]{.mark}.]{.underline} China and Russia's strategic
alignment and top threats to vital U.S. interests [[China's continued
economic and diplomatic support for Russia enables]{.mark} the latter to
sustain its war of [aggression in Ukraine. This war undermines]{.mark}
the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that underpin
[global stability]{.mark}, [threatens the United States' NATO allies,
and risks drawing the United States into a military
confrontation]{.mark} in Europe. China]{.underline} has supplied Russia
with industrial inputs, many dual use, including microelectronics,
military optics, drone and turbojet engines, armored vehicles, satellite
technology, and materials like nitrocellulose. These [exports have
flowed directly through Chinese suppliers and via third countries and
have facilitated the reconstitution of Russia's defense industrial base.
China has also undercut efforts to isolate Russia diplomatically. It
continues to lend credence to Moscow's narrative that paints Russia as
the victim of Western aggression and NATO expansion as the real driver
of the war in Ukraine. As such[, Sino-Russian cooperation poses a direct
threat to the interests of the United States as well as]{.mark} its
European [allies]{.mark} and partners. China and Russia are [weakening
the underpinnings of American leadership on the world stage and]{.mark}
core elements of [the existing rules-based international order]{.mark}.
Beijing and Moscow are disseminating narratives of terminal U.S. decline
across the Global South and developing alternative supply chains and
financial institutions to insulate themselves from U.S. sanctions. [The
two]{.mark} states [are determined to end]{.mark} what they see as [a
U.S.-dominated international order]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the
support of the Global South, [they are seeking to create an order in
which the United States and its Western partners have a diminished role,
and authoritarian states are free from international scrutiny and immune
to Western sanctions.]{.underline} The Russia-Ukraine war and the
escalating crisis in the Middle East, which have sharply divided the
United States, its allies, and its partners from much of the rest of the
world, have given Beijing and Moscow a boost in advancing such aims.
While China or Russia alone might not present a credible alternate pole,
a joint China-Russia "pole" is appealing to middle powers including
Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, regimes in the Middle East, and other
Global South states who believe that the current international order
does not sufficiently account for their voices. This is evidenced by the
growing popularity of the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization. [[Hedging by]{.mark} these [middle powers]{.mark} creates
geopolitical capital for Beijing and Moscow, economic benefits for
Moscow in particular, and [limits the influence of the United
States]{.mark}, its allies, and its partners. China and Russia's
deepening military alignment poses a challenge to U.S. interests in the
Indo-Pacific region. China-Russia military interactions, including joint
exercises, have increased in frequency over the decades]{.underline}. In
recent months, the two countries have held live-fire maritime drills in
the South China Sea and joint long-range bomber patrols near Alaska.
While cooperation and integration between the People's Liberation Army
and the Russian Armed Forces are still limited, there is considerable
potential for deeper integration. [These developments complicate
strategic planning for the United States, its allies, and its partners
given how costly and complex it would be to deter coordinated, if not
joint, China and Russian military operations. In addition, [China-Russia
technological cooperation in the military]{.mark}
domain]{.underline}---including Chinese purchases of advanced Russian
fighter jets, submarine technologies, and air defense systems; Russian
purchases of Chinese semiconductors that power military drones and
tanks; and research collaboration in artificial intelligence, quantum
computing, and space technology---[[raises significant security concerns
for the United States]{.mark} and its partners. Identifying the
challenges and strategic opportunities China and Russia's strategic
partnership will persist as long as each continues to see the United
States as its principal adversary. The United States maintains a
significant trust deficit with both Beijing and Moscow which creates
challenges for bilateral engagement. Neither Beijing nor Moscow believes
that they have anything to gain by working with Washington to check the
other's influence.]{.underline}

The National Security Strategy of [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates laid out that the Nation [is
[entering]{.mark} a [decisive decade]{.mark}]{.underline}---not only for
itself but also [[for the world]{.underline}]{.mark}.1 The current era
of strategic competition is [[characterized by]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[reemergence of a geopolitical [contest]{.mark} between powerful states
[over]{.mark}]{.underline} the shape of [the]{.underline} future
[[global order]{.underline}]{.mark}. After World War II, the Allies
established [a rules-based international order]{.underline} rooted in
cooperative values and predicated on a framework of diplomatic and
economic rules, led and enforced by like-minded nations. This system has
enabled decades of prosperity for all nations that have elected to
participate, but it [is]{.underline} now [under stress by
[revisionist]{.mark} nation[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. The People's
Republic of China (PRC), Russia, and North Korea are each intent on
changing the international order to achieve their national ambitions.

[The changing]{.underline} strategic [environment]{.underline} has
[[created]{.mark} a wicked [deterrence challenge]{.mark} that will
test]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its
allies]{.underline}. These revisionist states are dissatisfied with the
current international order because they see it as a threat to their own
national objectives. Their ambitions pose a direct strategic challenge
to the continued security of the United States and its allies because
these nations are increasingly capable and willing to use force as a
coercion mechanism. [Russia is]{.underline} openly [flouting
i]{.underline}nternational [laws and norms]{.underline}---including its
own commitment to the 1994 Budapest Memorandum---by [invading Ukraine,
violating its sovereignty and]{.underline} attempting to [annex
territory by force]{.underline}. China seeks to establish its own sphere
of influence in the Pacific region that excludes the United States and
Western influence while also attempting to resolve territorial disputes
through coercion and threatening behavior. The most serious component of
these strategic challenges for the United States is the modernization
and expansion of [both Russia's and the PRC]{.underline}'s nuclear
arsenals. [For the first time in]{.underline} its [history, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is]{.underline} simultaneously
facing [two]{.underline} [adversarial nuclear peers]{.underline} whose
aspirations directly challenge U.S. national values and [threaten U.S.
allies.]{.underline}

Wicked Deterrence Challenge

A wicked problem is one that is difficult to solve because of its
complexity, incomplete and changing information, multiple stakeholders,
competing and conflicting objectives, clash of cultures, or the
unprecedented or novel nature of the situation.2 Deterrence, by its very
nature as a function of influence over leadership decisionmaking, is a
wicked problem. Leadership decisionmaking can be impacted by numerous
unique factors, making the application of deterrence strategy more art
than science. As Keith Payne writes, "[There are few]{.underline}, if
any, [universal constants]{.underline} in this regard; instead, there is
[a wide variety of]{.underline} operating
[[factors]{.underline}]{.mark}, some seen, others unseen,
[that]{.underline} can [vary greatly across time, place, and opponent,
and [may be decisive]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in determining]{.mark}
if]{.underline} and how [[deterrence]{.mark} will
function]{.underline}."3

The emergence of the multilateral strategic environment and the need to
deter many nuclear actors simultaneously while continuing to assure
allies require the United States to rethink its deterrence policy. How
does deterrence policy need to adapt to address the changing multi-actor
environment? To begin to answer this question, analysts must start with
building an understanding of the strategic environment, including a deep
understanding of individual nations and the specific leaders the United
States seeks to deter. While this understanding will never be perfect,
it will reduce ignorance and provide a basis for designing a tailored
deterrence policy.

People's Republic of China

[[The PRC's]{.mark} meteoric rise]{.underline} has been [motivated by
its perceived need to restore its]{.underline} rightful [place in the
world order]{.underline}---to right the wrongs done to China during its
so-called Century of Humiliation. While former Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping articulated the PRC's strategy as one of patience---the famous
"hide and bide" strategy---current President Xi Jinping has abandoned
this approach, instead seizing the opportunity to achieve his Chinese
Dream of the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."4 However, Xi
views the current world order as an unacceptable impediment to China's
geopolitical ambitions and the United States as a direct threat to its
national security.5 The PRC views Western and particularly U.S.
influence in the Pacific region as a violation of its right to act as
the regional hegemon and an impediment to unification with Taiwan. Xi
envisions China as the rightful preeminent Asian and global power. Xi's
bolder, more confrontational strategy has provoked responses both from
regional nations concerned about their sovereignty and security and
global nations invested in the current rules-based international order.

[The PRC]{.underline} has [[repositioned]{.mark} itself [politically,
economically, and militarily to]{.mark}]{.underline} better enable it to
[[achieve]{.mark} its [aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The People's
Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}) has [undertaken a holistic military
[modernization of]{.mark}]{.underline} both [its [conventional and
nuclear]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}. Modernization
[efforts]{.underline} have been under way for decades, but they have
[increased to an alarming pace under Xi]{.underline}'s leadership. [The
PRC]{.underline} has [sought to]{.underline} develop an ability to
[forcibly expel Western forces and]{.underline} ultimately to [prohibit
their reentry]{.underline} into the region for the purpose of securing
its ambitions. Nuclear weapons forces are "a strategic pillar of China's
great power status," the linchpin in excluding U.S. and Western
interference, and ultimately serve as the backstop to achieving its
ambitions.6

[The PLA's rapid development of its]{.underline} nuclear [arsenal
[is]{.mark} the [fastest]{.mark} peacetime expansion of a nuclear
arsenal the [world has witnessed]{.mark}]{.underline}, going from just a
few hundred weapons at the end of the Cold War era to a projected 1,500
by 2035 if its current pace continues unabated.7 [These developments
will]{.underline} match, and in some areas qualitatively [exceed,
equivalency with the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Xi has stated that he believes a robust nuclear
weapons program is critical to the PRC's ability to counter the United
States in the Pacific region. To this end, the PRC is [[investing
in]{.underline}]{.mark} and expanding the number of its [[land]{.mark}-,
[sea]{.mark}-, [and air]{.mark}-based nuclear delivery platforms and
[constructing]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark} necessary [[to
support]{.underline}]{.mark} this [major
[expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}.8

The PRC's nuclear strategy has been relatively consistent since it first
acquired nuclear weapons in 1964, relying on a minimum deterrence
strategy made credible by a small nuclear arsenal capable of delivering
a secure second strike. The PRC's declared no-first-use policy further
reinforced this public commitment to maintaining a nonaggressive
position. However, the PRC's rapid nuclear expansion calls into question
whether the PLA is still committed to this strategy.9 In his testimony
before the House Armed Services Committee, General Anthony Cotton,
commander of U.S. Strategic Command, articulated this point, stating,
"[The PRC's actions are wholly inconsistent with its]{.underline}
long-professed [policy of minimum deterrence]{.underline}."10 The
expansion of the PRC's nuclear arsenal opens myriad possibilities of
ways it could adapt its strategy to both deter and coerce other nations.
However, due to a lack of transparency and an unwillingness to engage in
dialogue, it is unclear what the PRC's intentions are.11

The PRC's potential to change its nuclear strategy cannot be understated
in the maturing global circumstances. PLA officers are writing publicly
about the need to articulate conditions under which nuclear first use
may be permissible or even desirable. These include exceptional
scenarios such as conventional defeat threatening regime survival,
conventional attack on a nuclear scale, or attacks on PLA strategic
forces.12 As a result, the durability of the PRC's long-honored
no-first-use policy may soon be limited or deficient. While PRC debate
surrounding this policy gets the most attention from strategists and
policymakers, there is also debate surrounding its "sole purpose"
policy, with PLA strategists debating the benefits of using nuclear
weapons to deter conventional conflict.13 The active debate in the PRC
about changing its nuclear policy coupled with a lack of transparency
and communication increases uncertainty and the potential for
instability.

[The discovery of 300 new]{.underline} potential intercontinental
ballistic missile ([[ICBM]{.underline}]{.mark})
[silo[s]{.mark}]{.underline} [brought into sharp relief the extent of
the PRC's]{.underline} nuclear modernization and
[expansion]{.underline}.14 When complete, [these]{.underline} silos
[[will provide]{.underline}]{.mark} the PRC with [persistent readiness
and]{.underline} the [ability to conduct extremely [rapid launch]{.mark}
sequences]{.underline}. In addition to investing in fixed silos, [the
PLA Rocket Force is investing in road mobiles and
[expanding]{.mark}]{.underline} the number of [[launchers and
crews]{.underline}]{.mark} in each unit [at an unprecedented
rate.]{.underline}15 The PLA Navy's six Jin-class ballistic missile
submarines (SSBNs) rotate through near-continuous deployment equipped
with JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), though this
platform is vulnerable as it needs to enter the open Pacific in order to
target the United States. However, the PLA Navy is building the Type 096
SSBN, which will carry the updated JL-3 SLBM capable of targeting the
United States from Chinese littoral waters, significantly increasing the
survivability of its sea-based deterrent.16 Finally, the [PLA Air Force
is [reestablishing its air leg]{.mark}]{.underline} with the updated
H6-N bomber, which will complete a true regional triad. It is also
[developing a new strategic bomber]{.underline}, the H-20, but while
specifications are still unknown, it is clear that the PRC is intent on
obtaining a credible global triad.17 Beyond a traditional triad, [the
PRC is developing]{.underline} additional capabilities such as
[[hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark} missile[[s]{.underline}]{.mark},
fractional [[orbital]{.underline}]{.mark} [bombardment systems,
and]{.underline} the Dong Feng-26 medium-range ballistic missile with
both [conventional and [nuclear payloads]{.mark}]{.underline} that could
be swapped quickly in the field.18 While these capabilities are not
novel, they all have the potential to be destabilizing.

At the same time the PRC is modernizing its nuclear capabilities, it is
modernizing the command and control infrastructure to support it.
[Investments in [ground-based]{.mark}]{.underline} large [phased-array
[radars]{.mark} and]{.underline} the [ability to detect]{.underline}
ballistic [[missile]{.mark} launche[s]{.mark}]{.underline} with
geostationary satellites [have provided]{.underline} the PRC with [a
comprehensive [early warning]{.mark} capability]{.underline}.19 These
capabilities make credible the PRC's desire to shift to a "launch on
warning" nuclear posture, [[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[potential for miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. The U.S.-China
Economic and Security Review Commission detailed the risk with such a
posture, stating that the "difficulties associated with learning to
operate such a system could generate false alarms about nonexistent
incoming nuclear attacks, potentially triggering a nuclear exchange
between China and the United States."20 [The PRC's
[unwilling]{.mark}ness [to enter]{.mark} risk-reduction dialogues
and]{.underline} complete [refusal to enter [arms
control]{.mark}]{.underline} negotiations [mean]{.underline} these
[risks are left unaddressed]{.underline}.

Russia

[[The challenges]{.mark} posed [by Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} to the
rules-based international order [have [been on]{.mark} full
[display]{.mark} since]{.underline} at least [2008,
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia's [invasion of [Georgia,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} again in 2022 when President Vladimir Putin
began his "special military operation" in [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}
to halt Kyiv's economic and cultural progress toward the West. Putin
views the U.S.-backed rules-based international order as a threat to the
Russian way of life. It is his intent to renew the Russkiy Mir, the
Russian world, and restore Russian prestige and cultural and political
influence in the vein of previous Russian empires.21

The current revisionist and irredentist narrative in Russia argues that
Russia is a victim of U.S.-European hegemony and is besieged by North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion in its periphery, a direct
threat to the goal of reestablishing the Russian world. The war in
Ukraine is a direct result of this perceived threat. Non-NATO and
non--European Union states with strong relationships with the West, in
general, have been less susceptible or receptive to Russian influence,
thereby diminishing Russia's status in its near abroad. At the prospect
of further NATO enlargement, Putin felt threatened to the point of
taking belligerent action. According to Dmitri Trenin, a member of
Russia's Foreign and Defense Policy Council, "What Russia craves is
respect. It does not want to be a junior partner---it wants to be an
equal."22

Despite significant initial gains in Ukraine, the Russian war effort has
endured countless tactical, operational, and strategic setbacks and has
begun to show clear signs of devolution into a protracted slog
reminiscent of the Korean War in the 1950s. A significant portion of
Russia's conventional capability has been degraded and destroyed by the
ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which could increase Putin's reliance on
nuclear capabilities for Russia's defense. The continued use of nuclear
saber-rattling by Putin and other Russian officials has effectively
deterred Western intervention and heavily influenced the type of
military assistance the West is willing to provide to Ukraine and
undermined Ukrainian resistance.23 As evidenced by steadily increasing
economic and material support from NATO, the effectiveness of these
nuclear threats is eroding. Putin's legitimate reliance on nuclear
weapons, however, coupled with robust nuclear signaling should not be
ignored or dismissed out of hand because [Russia's nuclear
weapons]{.underline} arsenal [remains a]{.underline} significant
[existential threat]{.underline} to the United States and its allies
throughout Europe and the Pacific region.

[The capability and credibility of Russia's]{.underline} strategic and
tactical nuclear [forces make them a serious concern]{.underline} that
cannot be ignored. [[Russia continues to]{.mark} invest substantial
resources to expand and [modernize]{.mark}]{.underline} its strategic
and nonstrategic nuclear [capabilities]{.underline}. Russia's
modernization plan, which has been in the works for over a decade,
includes [improving each leg of its]{.underline} triad of [nuclear
delivery]{.underline} systems and developing new and novel nuclear
capabilities. For example, the Sarmat is a new silo-based ICBM that will
be capable of carrying up to 10 nuclear warheads.24 Russia's strategic
submarine fleet will include an entirely new Dolgorukiy class of SSBN
submarines equipped with SS-N-32 Bulava nuclear ballistic missiles by
2028. The Tu-160M supersonic strategic bomber aircraft has extended
range and is equipped with more capable onboard systems than previous
iterations, and 10 are already in the field.25 The modernization of the
Russian nuclear force has increased the capability and credibility of
Russia's nuclear triad.

In addition to modernizing its legacy systems, [Russia is
[developing]{.mark}]{.underline} and improving its
[[hypersonic]{.underline} [and other]{.underline}]{.mark} novel
[delivery system[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. These include new systems such
as the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, the Kinzhal
[[air]{.mark}-launched ballistic missile, and]{.underline} the Tsirkon
[[land]{.mark}-attack cruise missile]{.underline}. Furthermore, Russia
maintains over 2,000 non--treaty accountable---often referred to as
tactical or nonstrategic---nuclear weapons that provide diverse and
flexible use and deterrence options. In fact, it is this very threat of
tactical nuclear weapons that has caused NATO nations to revitalize
focus on both their conventional and nuclear capabilities to ensure that
the Alliance possesses a credible deterrent.26 [Both Russia's [strategic
and t]{.mark}actical [n]{.mark}uclear [w]{.mark}eapon[s]{.mark} are
backed by]{.underline} a body of [doctrine]{.underline} that explicitly
lays out the conditions for nuclear use, including possible first use in
response to threats to the "existence of the state."27

Since 1972, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet
Union, later the Russian Federation, has been partially stabilized by a
series of arms control agreements that provided mechanisms for building
trust and reducing risk by allowing some strategic predictability in the
relationship. For the first time in more than 40 years, U.S.-Russia
relations lack the stabilizing guardrails of these arms control
treaties. The last remaining arms control treaty regulating U.S. and
Russian strategic forces, [[New START]{.mark}, has suffered due
to]{.underline} the U.S. support of [Ukraine]{.underline} after the
Russian invasion. Shortly afterward, Russia began refusing onsite
inspections by U.S. personnel allowed by the treaty. Later, Russia
"paused" its compliance with New START and has since refused to begin
negotiations to extend or modify the agreement, which is set to expire
in February 2026.28 The [[expiration]{.mark} of strategic treaties with
Russia will]{.underline} not only [end]{.underline} self-imposed
[restraints, [potentially spurring]{.mark} an [arms race]{.mark},
but]{.underline} will also [eliminate]{.underline} one of the most
important conduits for [communication]{.underline} between the United
States and Russia [[and]{.mark} set [conditions for]{.mark}]{.underline}
dangerous miscommunication, misunderstanding, and
[[miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}ulation.

North Korea

North Korea has posed a consistent threat to the United States and its
allies since the 1953 armistice. The nature of this threat has
oscillated between moderate and acute but has remained consistently
hostile. The persistence of the threat and more acute emerging
challenges have unfortunately allowed some to become numb to the true
severity and magnitude of what a conflict with North Korea could mean
for the region and the United States. Conversely, North Korean leader
Kim Jong Un does not waver in his focus on the United States as the
perceived preeminent existential threat to his nation. To secure his
power and protect his regime, Kim continues to invest in and grow North
Korea's nuclear arsenal. [The growth of North Korea]{.underline}'s
nuclear power [goes beyond security]{.underline}. Jung H. Pak, a Fellow
at the Brookings Institution, observed, "\[Kim\] has elevated and
embedded nuclear weapons in both the popular consciousness and the
ideological, physical, and cultural landscape, enshrining them in North
Korea's constitution and has effectively linked them to the country's
perception of prosperity."29

Along with advancing weapons development, [[North Korea]{.mark} has
[continued to advance]{.mark} its nuclear program,
accelerating]{.underline} its [[testing]{.underline}]{.mark} program
while refining its nuclear doctrine. North Korea enshrines its nuclear
doctrine into law, the most recent update occurring in 2022 with the
establishment of the State Policy and Nuclear Forces. This law served as
an update to the 2013 Law on Consolidating Position of Nuclear Weapons
State. While the [2022 law remains consistent with]{.underline} the
earlier version in [affirming the role of nuclear weapons]{.underline}
in deterring aggression or responding if deterrence should fail, it also
outlined the [[situations]{.underline}]{.mark} that [could [warrant a
preemptive]{.mark} nuclear [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}.30 Most
concerning, the 2022 North Korean law details the potential for an
automatic nuclear response---often referred to as a "dead man's hand"
mechanism---should military commanders be unable to communicate with
leadership in Pyongyang during a conflict. This severely complicates the
deterrence and escalation management strategies of the United States and
its allies.31

Doubts regarding the credibility of North Korea's nuclear capability
should be discarded. [Each]{.underline} successive underground [nuclear
test has produced a larger yield]{.underline}, with North Korea's last
test in 2017 producing a yield of approximately 250 kilotons---10 times
larger than the bomb used at Nagasaki in 1945.32 Furthermore, [North
Korea's delivery systems continue to advance as]{.underline} the [nation
adheres to an aggressive testing schedule]{.underline}. In 2022, North
Korea conducted nearly 100 missile tests, more than it had ever
conducted.33 North Korea is developing ICBMs capable of holding the
United States at risk and several intermediate- and medium-range
ballistic missiles capable of targeting South Korea and Japan. It is
also pursuing an SLBM capability, which would increase the survivability
of its deterrent.34 Estimating the size of North Korea's nuclear arsenal
is exceedingly difficult, as the regime is even less transparent than
that of the PRC. That stated, North Korea is thought to have anywhere
from 35 to 65 warheads today, with the ability to add up to 18 more
warheads per year.35 The international community should no longer
consider Kim a proxy of the Chinese Communist Party or a buffer state
puppet and must not ignore North Korea's unique national objectives.

Complexity in the Multi-Actor Strategic Environment

The PRC, Russia, and North Korea represent primary nuclear security
concerns for the United States and its allies because of those states'
abilities to threaten existentially and coerce effectively. In the
developing multi-actor environment, U.S. relationships with each of
these states do not happen in a vacuum. [The strategic environment
contains other nuclear]{.underline} weapons [states]{.underline},
including U.S. allies [the U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom and
[France. India and Pakistan]{.underline} are de facto nuclear weapons
states, as they are not signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation
Treaty (NPT), nor are they recognized as sanctioned nuclear weapons
states by the NPT, as they acquired their capability after 1970. [There
are]{.underline} also [[additional nations]{.mark} that [may
desire]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}---adversaries
[[such as Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}.

For its part, the United States extends deterrence with its nuclear
umbrella through collective defense treaties to the 31 (soon to be 32)
nations of NATO, as well as Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Thus, the
deterrent relationships are never bilateral, as is often misremembered
about the Cold War era, but instead contain the security concerns of
multiple actors. As numerous deterrence scholars have expressed,
including Thérèse Delpech, [[this multi-actor]{.mark} strategic
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline} "may [[make]{.mark} a
[situation]{.mark} more [unstable]{.mark}]{.underline} . . . as
\[multiple actors\] introduce more variables" into deterrence
strategies.36 In U.S. deterrence efforts, each
[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} relationship [[must be
tailored]{.underline}]{.mark} for each state or actor and must consider
the nearly incalculable positions of allies and partners as well as
cooperators, competitors, and adversaries.

Cooperation between the United States and its traditional allies remains
strong and continues to grow. However, in the maturing multi-actor
deterrence reality, there is [increased cooperation between]{.underline}
and among the historically fiercely independent [PRC, Russia, and North
Korea]{.underline} in instances where their strategic objectives align.
These adversaries also have their own strategic deterrent relationships
beyond those with the United States. China, India, and Pakistan form a
deterrence triangle that features China's and Pakistan's increasing
cooperation while both actively deterring India and each other. This
[makes]{.underline} the second- and third-order effects of [strategic
choices]{.underline} as [critically important]{.underline} as any
deliberate direct effort. [[Actions]{.underline}]{.mark} taken
[[by]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates to assure an Indo-Pacific ally [could
[inspire]{.mark} the [PRC]{.mark} to adjust]{.underline} its deterrent
strategy, [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[trigger India]{.mark} to
adjust]{.underline} its deterrent strategy,
[[causing]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[ripple effect

#### Russia-China alliance collapses the international order and causes global conflict

While relentlessly pursuing its genocidal policy to destroy Ukraine as a
nation and Ukrainians as a distinct national and ethnic group, [Moscow
has been pushing an international agenda of a \'new world order' to
replace the Western-led, rules-based system of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations. The West's weak
response to Russia's threat to international peace has catalysed an
imploding of the global security order. [We are facing an emboldened
Sino-Russian alliance which strongly believes there is a window of
opportunity to gain the power to set the rules for a]{.underline} new,
unfree [world, ruled by force.]{.underline} Russia's large-scale
destruction of Ukraine is tangible evidence of how [international peace
can crumble in front of our eyes when rogue actors who seek to detonate
it demonstrate more determination and resolve than those
who]{.underline} purport to [defend it.]{.underline} The free world's
demonstrable lack of resolute will to uphold international law is a
major factor in the current global crisis and invites further chaos and
violence. [This historic moment calls for urgent revision of the current
Western course of conspicuously inadequate actions to remove the threat
of Russia as the linchpin of the anti-Western]{.underline},
anti-democratic [axis]{.underline}. [If the world is to avoid a new
global conflict, Western policy must be refocused on a full commitment
to defending the principles of the liberal rules-based
order]{.underline} that is designed to make the world safer. The Russian
Threat Vladimir Putin's Russia is not just an existential threat to
Ukraine. [Russia\'s aggressive]{.underline}, revanchist [regime is the
origin point of the international anti-Western axis]{.underline}. Just
as at other critical moments in its history, [Russia is once again
redefining itself through confrontation with the West]{.underline}.
[Moscow is challenging Western primacy]{.underline} in international
relations in order [to reclaim its status of global power]{.underline}.
For the Kremlin, the freedom to act above and outside the limits and
restrictions of international law is the symbol of such supremacy. For
the past two decades, the world has been observing an escalating
\'Russia crisis\' -- the critical threat posed by a criminal,
militarised, totalitarian, aggressive, revanchist and genocidal regime
to international peace. Rather than countering the growing threat,
Western policy has relied on the \'too big to fail' approach in dealing
with Moscow. Consequently, Russia has largely enjoyed protection from
the consequences of its criminal actions, and has been able to continue
pursuing its nefarious strategic course. Moscow's goal is to replace the
current liberal, rules-based international system with a 'new world
order', where the role of the West is notably reduced. This was Vladimir
Putin's message in speeches given in 2014, 2023 and 2024. In 2014, Putin
made a threatening warning which made clear that Russia will have no
limits in pursuing this goal: '\... changes in the world order -- and
what we are seeing today are events on this scale -- have usually been
accompanied by, if not global war and conflict, then by chains of
intensive local-level conflicts.' Russia's hostile ambitions were
spelled out formally when, in 2021, Moscow issued an ultimatum to NATO,
publicly outlining its far-reaching demands for a dangerous level of
influence over the eastern flank of the alliance. Western powers
continue to treat Russia as a pillar of the strategic global balance, as
a consequence of which their policy towards Russian aggression has been
ultimately premised on Kyiv making concessions to Moscow Moscow's
determination to defy the West has been severely underestimated. [The
quest for a 'new world order', driven by the Sino-Russian alliance, is
changing global dynamics]{.underline}. In essence, [the new Eastern-led
order is based on]{.underline} taking advantage of the globalised
economy while [destroying the liberal rules-based international
order.]{.underline} Rogue regimes in Iran, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela
and Belarus are being legitimised. The expanding BRICS group is building
an alternative economic system of the \'global majority' to provide
shelter from Western sanctions and ensure global political dominance.

**Russia and China's strategic alliance based on control of the maritime
Arctic -- this makes the U.S. [extremely vulnerable]{.underline} to a
Russian nuclear attack**

and China's cooperation in the Arctic is a rising nuclear threat,"

[As the Russia-China axis further aligns itself against the U.S. and its
NATO allies, the power struggle has expanded to a new, previously
ice-locked frontier]{.underline}: [the Arctic.]{.underline}

[When American fighters intercepted two Russian and two Chinese
bombers]{.underline} in the U.S. Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)
[over Alaska]{.underline} in July, the unprecedented move underscored
this increasingly assertive and expansive partnership. And [while
Beijing and Moscow have been working to establish a strategic foothold
in the region for more than a decade, Washington]{.underline} and
Brussels are [just now waking up to the threat.]{.underline}

[The clock is ticking, and the West is on thin ice.]{.underline}

[Just how important the Arctic is to Russia in terms of maintaining its
threatening nuclear posture toward the U.S. cannot be
overstated]{.underline}. [In a nuclear exchange, Moscow would likely
fire long-range ballistic missiles --- from ballistic missile submarine
bases near the Kola Peninsula --- through the poorly surveyed airspace
over Greenland. And hindered by low visibility in the Arctic, U.S.
forces would be ill-prepared to detect and counter the
strike.]{.underline}

[Russia has been building up this Arctic force since its 2014 invasion
of Crimea]{.underline}. In its efforts, [melting sea ice has presented
both opportunities and challenges for the country]{.underline}. On the
one hand, [the economic importance of Russia's Arctic coastline is
growing because of its commercialization as a feasible shipping
route]{.underline}, allowing Moscow to profit from providing short
shipping routes for commercial vessels carrying cargo between Asia and
Europe. However, [more traffic also means Russia's control of its vast
Arctic coastline --- stretching from the Barents Sea in the west to the
Bering Strait in the east --- is now threatened]{.underline}.

So, using a dense network of air defense, aviation and ground forces at
its Northern Fleet bases, Russia has been focusing on closing off access
to the Kola Peninsula at the Barents Sea to protect its strategic
submarine force and preserve the fleet's year-round access to the
Atlantic. It has also invested heavily in precision-guided missile
technology to threaten distant targets and achieve sea denial without
having to deploy traditional naval or air forces.

Additionally, in order to maintain and operate a strategic submarine
force near Alaska without relying on Northern Fleet repair facilities at
the other end of Eurasia, Russia has constructed new hardened submarine
shelter pens and repair and maintenance facilities south of the Bering
Strait near Vladivostok.

Amid all this, [as further evidence of its "no-limits" partnership with
Russia, China has been developing its dual-use Arctic capabilities too,
bolstering Russia's ability to threaten the U.S. and its NATO allies
while diverting attention from the Indo-Pacific. It has also increased
its regional civilian and military cooperation with Moscow]{.underline},
[linking its polar Silk Road to the Russian Arctic by investing in
infrastructure.]{.underline}

As it stands, China's polar satellites, ~~unmanned~~ \[uncrewed\]
underwater vehicles and research vessels --- three of which are
icebreakers --- give Beijing an edge in terms of tracking shipping
routes, mapping the Arctic seabed and monitoring sea-ice and aerial
movements. And [with the joint venture between Russia's state-owned
nuclear energy firm Rosatom and China's Hainan Yangpu NewNew Shipping
company, the two countries will now cooperate on building infrastructure
and ice-class container vessels to operate a year-round Arctic route.
The collaboration empowers Moscow to monitor and control activities
along its Arctic coastline, and to better protect Russian ballistic
missile submarines as well.]{.underline}

[Taken altogether, Russia's and China's maritime, cyber and space
capabilities in the Arctic now threaten NATO's sparse communications and
data infrastructure in the region. Communications cables weren't built
to withstand hybrid warfare. Plus, insufficient radars, surveillance
drones, unmanned aircraft, anti-submarine capable warships and satellite
coverage make the U.S. vulnerable to Russia's nuclear
threat]{.underline}. It simply isn't enough for America to develop
capabilities of its own.

"Why Did China and Russia Stage a Joint Bomber Exercise Near Alaska?" https://www.csis.org/analysis/why-did-china-and-russia-stage-joint-bomber-exercise-near-alaska)**

[On July 24, [the]{.mark} North American Aerospace Defense Command
([NORAD]{.mark}) [intercepted two Chines]{.mark}e Xian H-6K
[bombers]{.mark} and [two Russian]{.mark} Tu-95MS Bear [bombers flying
near Alaska. Both]{.mark}]{.underline} types of bombers [[are]{.mark}
[nuclear capable]{.mark}.]{.underline} The bombers were intercepted by
American F-16s and F-35s and Canadian CF-18 fighter jets. While the
aircraft remained in international airspace and did not fly into
Canadian or U.S. sovereign airspace, they were operating in the Alaska
Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). [[These joint flights come at a
time of growing]{.mark} great power [competition]{.mark} and
[solidifying the Chinese-Russian]{.mark} "no limits"
[partnership]{.mark}. This incident was the first of its kind for the
two countries, [showing a willingness of Beijing and Moscow to extend
cooperation to]{.mark} their strategic [nuclear forces]{.mark} and
[signaling their continued testing of U.S. resolve]{.mark}, including
through actions in proximity to the U.S. homeland.]{.underline} Q1: Is
it normal for China and Russia to conduct joint patrols in the Pacific?
A1: [This is the first time China and Russia have conducted a joint air
patrol near Alaska and in the northern Pacific. It is also the first
time that Chinese and Russian aircraft have taken off from the same
Russian air base.]{.underline} The bombers came within 200 miles of the
coast of Alaska. While staying within international airspace, they did
fly through Alaska's ADIZ---airspace that is controlled for national
security reasons, where aircraft are required to identify themselves.
According to a statement by the Russian Ministry of Defence, the
countries were conducting joint strategic air patrols in a "new area of
joint operations" with two Chinese Xian H-6 planes and two Russian Tu-95
bombers, escorted by Russian fighter jets. This is the eighth joint
bomber flight that China and Russia have conducted since 2019. The
previous bomber flights were conducted in the Sea of Japan, East China
Sea, and Western Pacific, with some flying through the ADIZ of Japan and
South Korea. Not just limited to bombers, [Chinese and Russian joint air
and maritime patrols in the Indo-Pacific have also become more frequent,
[suggesting a deepening and broadening level of bilateral
cooperation]{.mark} since Beijing and Moscow declared a "no limits"
partnership in 2022.]{.underline} Q2: Why are Russia and China
conducting joint patrols and why now? A2: A spokesperson for China's
Ministry of National Defense said [the purpose of the strategic air
patrol was "further testing and enhancing the level of cooperation
between the two air forces, as well as deepening strategic mutual trust
and practical cooperation between the two countries."]{.underline} He
also stressed that it was not aimed at any third parties and "has
nothing to do with the current international and regional situation."
Given the growing competition in the region, including rising nuclear
risks, [[this]{.mark} statement [should be viewed in a wider
context]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a result of their continued
cooperation, [[China and Russia are demonstrating that they can jointly
project military power]{.mark} in the region [and reach the U.S.
homeland]{.mark}, while also building greater operational proficiency
among their military forces. This patrol is just the latest
manifestation of [increasing military cooperation]{.mark} and
sophistication [in]{.mark} [the China-Russia partnership]{.mark}. The
timing of these flights could also be seen as a counter to high-profile
international events between the United States and its allies in the
region.]{.underline} Beijing and Moscow have done this in the past. In
May 2022, coincident with a meeting of Quad leaders in Tokyo, Chinese
H-6 bombers and Russian Tu-95 bombers flew near Japanese airspace,
leading Japan to scramble fighter jets in response. Now, this incident
comes as the United States, along with 28 allies and partners, carries
out its biennial Rim of the Pacific Exercise---the world's largest
international maritime exercise, which earlier this month included a
test of a B-2 bomber sinking a maritime target. China was not invited
after abusing past invites. It also comes as U.S. secretary of defense
Lloyd Austin and U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken are visiting
Japan for the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee meeting, which
will be followed by Austin's visit to the Philippines---which has
expanded its defense cooperation with the United States under President
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Additionally, on August 6, Austin will host an
Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultation in Annapolis. These and other
initiatives, such as the Nuclear Consultative Group with South Korea and
the Australia-UK-U.S. agreement on joint development of nuclear
submarines and technology sharing, point to a strengthening of alliances
to posture against intensifying Chinese and North Korean military
activities in the region and further Russian aggression in and beyond
Ukraine. While Beijing and Moscow may assert the exercises are a means
of counterbalancing Western influence and attempting to divide the
United States from its allies, they seem to be having the opposite
effect. Q3: Are these bomber flights part of a broader military
cooperation agenda between China and Russia? A3: [Both Beijing and
Moscow have described past joint bomber flights as being conducted "in
accordance with their annual military cooperation plan"]{.underline}
(author's translation). This plan, [designed to enhance the strategic
partnership and coordination between their armed forces, has manifested
through various military activities]{.underline}, including joint air
patrols, naval exercises, and training missions. [Their partnership
has]{.underline} also [[expanded to nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}, space,
and industrial base [[cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Chinese and
Russian navies have engaged in joint exercises since 2012, including
exercises in the Baltic Sea, the Sea of Japan, and the Arctic. Last
summer, a flotilla of 11 ships sailed near the coast of Alaska and the
Aleutian Islands, comprised of Chinese and Russian destroyers, an
intelligence collection ship, and other support vessels. This month, the
two navies commenced their annual joint maritime patrol in the
Asia-Pacific region, including a three-day exercise in the South China
Sea. In 2018, [[China declared itself a "Near-Arctic State"]{.mark} and
expressed an interest in the Arctic for both economic and strategic
reasons. As the polar ice caps melt, [the region could open up new
shipping lanes]{.mark} [that would be of particular value to China in
expanding its trade routes with an "Ice Silk Road]{.mark}."]{.underline}
A 2022 RAND study concluded that China does not have a major presence in
the region, but "not for lack of trying," having dispatched numerous
research expeditions and attempting to conclude a \$150 million gold
mine deal, which was blocked by Canada. [[China]{.mark} may be [seeking
to leverage Russia's presence in the Arctic]{.mark} as it attempts to
gain a stronger foothold in the region. Beyond joint strategic bomber
flights, the [partnership includes nuclear
cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Since 2018, China has regularly sent
forces to participate in Russia's annual military district-level
exercises (e.g., Kavkaz, Tsentr, Vostok, and Zapad). Additionally, in
early 2023, Western media reported that Rosatom---Russia's state-run
nuclear energy corporation---was supplying China with thousands of
kilograms of highly enriched uranium to fuel fast breeder reactors. U.S.
officials believe that these reactors will produce weapons-grade
plutonium for Beijing's nuclear weapons program. Relating to space and
missile defense, Beijing and Moscow signed technology transfer
agreements in 2017 and 2019, although it is unclear whether such
transfers between the two countries have increased. However, Chinese
firms have provided the Wagner Group with satellite imagery to assist
its combat operations in Ukraine. Finally, [[China]{.mark} plays a key
role in [supporting Russia's war in Ukraine]{.mark}. Beijing is
providing Russia with "dual-use material and components for weapons,"
which has only increased since Russia invaded Ukraine.]{.underline} Q4:
Were the flights intentionally escalatory and should we expect more of
them? A4: [Alaskan national security leaders have highlighted the
potentially escalatory nature of Chinese-Russian flights]{.underline}.
U.S. senator Lisa Murkowski described the [patrol as an "unprecedented
provocation by our adversaries,"]{.underline} while U.S. senator Dan
Sullivan declared, ["Make no mistake, [this is an
escalation]{.mark}."]{.underline} Intercepts in the Alaska ADIZ,
however, are far from unusual: on average, NORAD conducted six to seven
intercepts of Russian aircraft annually between 2007 and 2023. While the
presence of Chinese bombers in this latest patrol is new, the operation
follows a similar pattern to previous Russian patrols near Alaska, with
aircraft operating in international airspace and comporting to
international law and practice. The real significance of the patrol is
in what it demonstrates about growing cooperation between China and
Russia and intensifying competition between the United States and those
adversaries. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should expect
continued challenges]{.mark} from China and Russia in the Western
Hemisphere to demonstrate that the U.S. homeland is within their reach,
as well as further challenges across other domains]{.underline},
including at sea, in space, and across the nuclear dimension. [Both the
Chinese and Russian bombers involved in the patrol were nuclear capable,
a signal that corresponds with the [rapid expansion of China]{.mark}'s
[nuclear forces and persistent Russian nuclear
saber-rattling]{.mark}]{.underline}. Q5: How should the United States
respond to future provocations? A5: Defense Secretary Austin explained
in a press briefing on July 25 that the Chinese and Russian aircraft
approaching U.S. airspace was "not a surprise," revealing that U.S.
forces had "closely monitored these aircraft, tracked the aircraft,
intercepted the aircraft," with reference to the United States' "very
good surveillance capabilities." The fact that NORAD was able to track
and intercept Chinese and Russian bombers over 200 miles from the U.S.
coast illustrates the strength of U.S. early warning and intelligence
capabilities and the preparedness of U.S. and allied air forces. By
continuing to demonstrate professionalism in these incidents and calling
out irresponsible adversary behavior---as Chinese and Russian air and
maritime forces frequently demonstrate---the United States can highlight
its adversaries' aggressive behavior for the international community.
[[U.S.]{.mark} leaders]{.underline}, however,
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[improve homeland defenses
against a wider range of threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} While NORAD can
reliably detect and intercept adversary aircraft, [the [Chinese balloon
incident]{.mark}]{.underline} in early 2023 [[revealed gaps]{.mark} in
the United States' ability to detect and disrupt other adversary
activity in U.S. airspace.]{.underline} Further, the bipartisan U.S.
Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States
[observed advances in Chinese and Russian [coercive attack
weapons]{.mark} that [can reach the U.S.]{.mark} homeland. [Improvements
to]{.mark} U.S. homeland [defense radars]{.mark} and accelerating the
fielding of integrated air and [missile defense capabilities]{.mark}
would [equip U.S. forces to better defend]{.mark} the U.S. homeland
[from]{.mark} a variety of [potential threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The United States should also work to better understand Chinese-Russian
cooperation. U.S. intelligence collection and analysis tends to be
siloed, with the intelligence community maintaining separate Chinese and
Russian intelligence units and experts. As China and Russia work
together more closely, there is a growing need to closely examine the
bilateral relationship as a whole, including the ways in which the two
countries work together and the vulnerabilities in their partnership.
This effort will require greater cooperation between Chinese and Russian
experts within and across intelligence agencies.

Finally, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, its allies, [and its partners [anchor
stability]{.mark} and security across the Indo-Pacific [through force
posture]{.mark} and presence, exercises and [training to build
readiness]{.mark} and interoperability, [and]{.mark} complementary
i[nvestments in]{.mark} modern [defense
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While China and Russia are
attempting to project power together, the United States already does
this and must continue.]{.underline}

Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in September. "[The Russian doctrine covers
the use of tactical nuclear weapons, and they talk about it almost every
week now]{.underline}. If you repeatedly threaten to use nuclear weapons

As the Munich Security Conference gets underway, [[the spectre of a
third world war looms on the horizon]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Military and
political [leaders]{.mark} in NATO nations [have issued]{.mark}
[chilling warnings]{.mark} for populations [to brace for the possibility
of devastating superpower conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Admiral Rob [Bauer, chair of NATO's Military Committee, fired the
opening salvo in the grim round of predictions]{.underline}. [He
cautioned that Russia could launch an attack within the next two
decades. In words reminiscent of World War II, Bauer urged allied
countries to mobilise citizen armies]{.underline}.

[British Defence Secretary]{.underline} Grant [Shapps has gone even
further, foreseeing potential wars involving China, Russia, North Korea
and Iran within the next five years]{.underline}. The situation is
transitioning "from a post-war to pre-war world", he asserted bleakly.

[General]{.underline} Sir Patrick [Sanders, the UK's army chief, echoed
that dark prediction]{.underline}. He described the British population
as a "pre-war generation" that may need to prepare for conflict with an
increasingly aggressive Russia.

German politicians and military leaders have discussed resurrecting
mandatory military service in response to growing threats and Sweden has
already introduced a form of national service as it closes in on NATO
membership.

[[With Russia holding]{.mark} over [53% of the Arctic]{.mark} [Ocean
coastline]{.mark}, Vladimir [Putin believes domination]{.mark} of the
region's resources [is critical to]{.mark} the economic [survival of his
regime]{.mark}]{.underline}

[To many, the idea that increased tensions sparked by Russia's attacks
on Ukraine could lurch towards a wider European conflict seems not only
probable but inevitable]{.underline}.

However, [[amid the drumbeats of international conflict]{.mark}, [one
crucial factor is being overlooked: the impact of climate change as a
potential trigger for war]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[NATO has committed to taking a leading international role on climate
and security]{.underline}. Yet [the landmark climate agreement reached
late last year at the COP28 conference in Dubai underscores the need for
Western leaders meeting in Munich to raise their climate ambitions and
translate them into tangible action]{.underline}.

[NATO recognises climate change as a 'threat amplifier' for traditional
security issues]{.underline}, but it needs to go further as studies
indicate [global warming is already rapidly accelerating the likelihood
of armed conflict, especially in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[[Arctic icecaps are melting at record rates]{.mark}, making deposits of
gas, oil and minerals worth trillions of dollars accessible for the
first time. Over the coming years, [this will spark a race for Arctic
dominance that Russia is hellbent on winning]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[With Russia holding over 53% of the Arctic Ocean
coastline]{.underline}, Vladimir [Putin believes domination of the
region's resources is critical to the economic survival of his
regime.]{.underline} The Arctic is estimated to hold 412 billion barrels
of oil and gas, about 22% of the world's undiscovered reserves.

[Putin is hardly trying to hide his agenda. [Russia already operates a
third more Arctic military bases than the US and its NATO
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Now [[Putin is moving soldiers,
icebreakers, warships and submarines to the region]{.mark}, as well as
conducting Arctic drills that test hypersonic missiles capable of
evading American defences]{.underline}.

His propaganda machine regularly releases pictures of troops training in
white fatigues and clutching assault weapons as they zip over the snow
on sleighs pulled by reindeer.

[[It]{.mark} is time for world leaders to act in the knowledge
that]{.underline} failure to urgently address the climate emergency
[[exposes the world to]{.mark} the risk of [a devastating conflict
between NATO and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}

America and Denmark have filed sovereignty claims in the central Arctic
Ocean but it was Moscow that, in 2007, planted a titanium Russian flag
on the seabed two-and-a-half miles under the North Pole.

[More aggressive Russian claims in the Arctic could force NATO to act
and risk sparking the global conflict]{.underline} that the generals and
politicians are warning of. While traditional military preparations for
global war are undoubtedly vital, leaders convening at Munich must also
prioritise climate action to mitigate the risk of global warming
becoming the catalyst for a catastrophic clash.

A similar story is being recorded right across the High North. "Arctic
amplification" is the term meteorologists use for the accelerated rate
of global warming. But the same amplification is occurring with the
geopolitics of the region. [The Arctic is melting --- one scientific
study, published in June, claimed that the first summer in which all sea
ice disappears could occur as early as the 2030s --- and, from China to
the US to Putin's Russia, suddenly everyone wants a piece]{.underline}.
The era of "Arctic exceptionalism" declared by Russian president Mikhail
Gorbachev in 1987 is resolutely over, his entreaties for the Arctic to
remain a "zone of peace" free from conflict and exploitation forgotten.
[As climate change accelerates and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has
cleaved apart the international order]{.underline}, [[the Arctic has
emerged as the]{.mark} potential [theatre of the next global

Finland, Iceland, the US and Russia) warns that the global race to
plunder the Arctic could have devastating consequences. "If you don't
co-operate on the Arctic and we don't get these things right, then I'll
tell you this, my friend: the world can change very rapidly."

[[Russia,]{.mark} whose territory spans around 53% of the Arctic Ocean
shoreline, [and China are rapidly developing plans to expand the
Northern Sea Route]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} maritime
[passage]{.mark} between the east and west of the Arctic Ocean [is
regarded by the Kremlin as vital to avoid Western
sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is already possible to navigate the
route for anyone with several briefcases full of dollars to pay for the
mandatory Russian ice breakers which accompany any transit as patrol
vessels. In 2024, the Kremlin is planning to commence year-round
navigations of the route, through which it hopes to increase the amount
of cargo shipped from around 30 million annually to 80 million.

[China --- which has ominously declared itself a "near-Arctic state" ---
also harbours ambitions to transform the passage into a silk road of the
far north]{.underline}, while in March, a Russian delegation to India
held talks over new co-operation over the route. The West is similarly
flexing its muscles, with Finland (and the expected accession of Sweden)
extending Nato's borders into the Arctic. In June, the US Secretary of
State Anthony Blinken announced that the US would be opening an outpost
in the far-north Norwegian town of Tromsø, stressing the need to have "a
diplomatic footprint" above the Arctic Circle. "[The war in Ukraine has
really torpedoed this idea of Artic exceptionalism," explains Dr Neil
Melvin, Director of International Security at the Royal United Services
Institute (RUSI). "The whole focus of northern Europe has basically now
shifted to building security against Russia]{.underline}."

As Melvin points out[, the [heavy losses]{.mark} sustained by Russia's
land army [in Ukraine will force it to become]{.mark} increasingly
[reliant on its nuclear forces stationed in the
Arctic]{.mark},]{.underline} where the UK and US have also long operated
their own attack submarines. [Russia's Northern Fleet comprises of a
dozen or so nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as surface
vessels, including two heavy nuclear-powered missile battle
cruisers]{.underline}. In recent years, [Russia has also reoccupied old
Cold War-era Arctic bases to bolster its presence]{.underline}. "[[They
will feel more vulnerable as a result of not having a strong
army]{.mark}, and I think [we are likely to see them threaten nuclear
options much more as part of national defence]{.mark}]{.underline},"
Melvin says of Russia's designs in the Arctic. "[They are going to be
much more explicit and threatening]{.underline}."

[Beneath the ice, [the Arctic possesses untold riches]{.mark}. The
region is estimated to contain a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil
and gas reserves and rare earth elements]{.underline} such as gold,
nickel and zinc. While most of these are present within the largely
undisputed land borders of the Arctic nations, [[it is the]{.mark}
increasingly [navigable international waters that present the most
likely flashpoint]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} An ongoing process led
by a United Nations commission is considering sovereignty rights to the
central Arctic Ocean between Russia, Denmark and Canada. While Putin is
cooperating with the process so far, he has also planted a flag in the
most literal sense --- dropping a titanium standard of the Russian
Federation two miles beneath the ocean on the North Pole seabed in 2007.
Fishing rights are also key; as southern oceans heat up, species will
migrate ever further north, causing estimated catches in higher
latitudes to increase by up to 20 per cent by 2050.

[According to Professor]{.underline} Klaus [Dodds, an expert in
geopolitics and ice studies based at Royal Holloway and author of the
recent book, Border Wars, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard could
prove another area of conflict]{.underline}. Under a treaty originally
signed in 1920, a host of countries including China and Russia have
rights to engage in commercial activities across Svalbard. Moscow
conducts coal mining operations on the island of Spitsbergen (and
insists on referring to Svalbard by the same name, to emphasise its
historic claim on the land). In settlements such as Barentsburg, Russian
is the predominant language.

"[The concern is [we know we have potential flashpoints]{.mark} like
Svalbard [which]{.mark}, having caused agitation and tension in the
past, [might be escalated]{.mark} very [quickly]{.mark}]{.underline},"
Dodds says. [Aggression could be anything from attacks on underwater
cables]{.underline} (last year, a Russian trawler was linked to the
severing of a sub-sea fibre-optic cable which linked Svalbard to the
Norwegian mainland), [to an outright attack on oil and gas
infrastructure]{.underline}. "The Norwegian European Arctic will be the
space where, if anything, this is most likely to happen," Dodds says.
"That would also be the ultimate opportunity for Russia to test Nato's
resolve."

Leadership Network; European Leadership Network, "Envisioning a
Russia-NATO Conflict: Implications for Deterrence Stability,"

Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once]{.mark} a [conflict was under way]{.mark}, the "[fog of war"
and]{.mark} rising [unpredictability would inevitably set]{.mark} in,
complicating the implementation of any]{.underline} predetermined
theories of escalation, deescalation and inter-[conflict management. The
actual dynamics of]{.underline} a [conflict]{.underline} and the
perceptions of the stakes involved [are extremely difficult to predict.
Simulations]{.underline} and table-top exercises can [give]{.underline}
only [limited insights]{.underline} into the actual decision-making
processes and interactions.

Still, [Russian military theorists]{.underline} and practitioners seem
to [assume]{.underline} that [a conflict with NATO can be managed and
controlled in a way that would bring it to a swift end consistent with
Russian aims. The [Russian theory]{.mark} of victory]{.underline} would
[seek to [exploit weak points in]{.mark} an [Alliance]{.mark} war
effort. Based on the conviction that democracies are weak
and]{.underline} their leaders and populations are [risk-averse,
[Russia]{.mark} may [assume]{.mark} that]{.underline} its [[threats
of]{.mark} horizontal or vertical [escalation could
be]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly [[effective. It
would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [try to bring home the
notion]{.underline} that [it has much higher stakes in the
conflict]{.underline} (regime survival) [than]{.underline} a majority of
the [NATO members]{.underline} involved, [and]{.underline} thus [will be
ready to [push]{.mark} the [boundaries]{.mark} of]{.underline} the
[conflict further. It would]{.underline} most likely [[try to]{.mark}
test and [exploit]{.mark} potential [divisions]{.mark} within the
Alliance, combining selective diplomacy and activation of its
intelligence assets in]{.underline} some [NATO states]{.underline} with
a degree of selectivity in terms of targets of particular attacks.

[[Any]{.mark} NATO-Russia [conflict would]{.mark} inevitably [have a
nuclear]{.mark} [dimension]{.mark}. The role of nuclear weapons as a
tool [for escalation control]{.mark} for Russia has been]{.underline}
thoroughly [debated by experts, but when]{.underline} and how [Russia
might use]{.underline} (and not merely showcase or activate) [nuclear
weapons in a conflict remains an open question. Beyond]{.underline}
catch phrases such as ["escalate to de-escalate"]{.underline} or
"escalate to win" [[there are a]{.mark} wider [range of options for
Russian]{.mark} nuclear weapon [use]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example,
[[a single nuclear]{.mark} warning [shot could be lethal]{.mark} or
non-lethal. It could be directed against a]{.underline} purely [military
target or a]{.underline} military-[civilian one. [Detonation could
be]{.mark} configured for an [EMP effect]{.mark}. A "false flag" attack
is]{.underline} also [conceivable. These options]{.underline} might be
used to [signal escalation and could significantly complicate NATO's
responses]{.underline}.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. [It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be willing to escalate the
conflict]{.underline} to achieve these goals, [and what
mechanisms]{.underline} and means [it would use while trying to
maintain]{.underline} some degree of [control]{.underline} over the
conflict.

[The goals]{.underline} and methods [of waging a conflict with Russia
would]{.underline} probably [have to be limited in order to avoid a
massive nuclear exchange. Such limitations]{.underline} would also
involve restrictions on striking back against targets on Russian
territory. But too narrow an approach [could put too much restraint on
NATO's operations: the Russian regime's stability may]{.underline}
ultimately [need to be threatened]{.underline} in order [to force the
leadership into terminating the conflict]{.underline}. NATO would thus
need to establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian
actions would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks
against military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be
useful as tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover,
individual NATO Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's
actions, might pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of [escalation
control]{.mark}]{.underline} and on lessons [from the Cold
War]{.underline} confrontation [[might be misleading]{.mark}. The
circumstances in which a [Russia-NATO conflict would]{.mark} play out
would [be]{.mark} radically different from the 20th century]{.underline}
screenplay. Moreover, [instead of gradual]{.underline} (linear)
[escalation or salami tactics escalation, it is possible to
imagine]{.underline} surprizing [["leap frog"
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, possibly [connected]{.underline} with
actions [in different domains]{.underline} (e.g. a cyberattack against
critical infrastructure). Flexibility, good intelligence and
inventiveness in responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO assumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.underline} most likely [not survive the first hours
of]{.underline} an [actual conflict. Both sides are capable of
underestimating the resolve of the other side to prevail]{.underline} in
a conflict [and the other side's willingness to]{.underline} commit the
necessary resources and [endure the costs, especially once
both]{.underline} sides [start committing]{.underline} their [political
capital]{.underline} and resources and the casualties accumulate.

Body

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has frozen hopes of Arctic coordination
and left simmering a future competition between a Sino-Russian strategic
partnership and the West's Arctic claimants]{.underline}. [Even as
Russia expends its conventional military in Ukraine, its authoritarian
regime retains power, flexibility, and opportunities with its premier
icebreaker fleet and Arctic basing]{.underline}.1 [Bolstered by a new
maritime strategy that asserts the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation
and Northern Sea Route]{.underline} (NSR) [are "vital areas of national
interest,]{.underline}" Russia's Duma passed a law in December 2022
claiming the four key straits along the route as internal seas.2

[China---Russia's "friend with no limits" and aspiring "polar great
power"---has built multiple domestic icebreakers and proposed a "Polar
Silk Road]{.underline}" [for maritime voyages between Europe and
China]{.underline}.3 As global water temperatures warm, fish populations
in near-Arctic waters have grown and are increasingly subject to Chinese
illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. [As the only service
with a mandate for icebreakers, the U.S. Coast Guard will be challenged
to keep "free and open" a maritime trade route and its near seas that
connect key U.S. allies and partners]{.underline} (such as Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan) [with the economies of NATO---notwithstanding
Sino-Russian capability and interests.]{.underline} Further worrying is
the service's limited budget and a Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program
already in danger from shipyard consolidation, running the risk of
pushing delivery to fiscal year 2027, as Vice Admiral Peter Gautier,
Deputy Commandant for Operations, testified in December 2022.4 PSCs will
be critical, but [the Coast Guard also must innovate its organizations
and technology if it wishes to push back on Russian maritime claims
along the NSR or regulate near-Arctic IUU fishing]{.underline}.

[Conventional single-ship Navy freedom of navigation
operations]{.underline} (FONOPs) [like those conducted in the South
China Sea will be insufficient along the NSR]{.underline}. [Developing
new approaches will require several steps]{.underline}. First,
policy-makers must understand the details of Russian claims. Second,
[the Coast Guard should establish a "Task Force
Rush"]{.underline}---named after the earliest Revenue Cutters that
served on the Bering Sea Patrol starting in 1874---at Coast Guard Sector
Anchorage.5 The task force would be tailored to rapid operational
innovation and the deployment of commercially available ~~unmanned~~
\<uncrewed\> [systems and artificial intelligence for the Arctic's
maritime domain.]{.underline} Third, [the Coast Guard should
consider]{.underline} changes to support its long-range aviation fleet
of HC-130Js; further coordination with the Navy, Air Force, and Space
Force; and [adoption of commercially available, cost-effective hybrid
air vehicles (HAVs) and high-altitude balloons (HABs) to increase Arctic
aviation capacity.]{.underline} Last, the Coast Guard should seek to
establish "Task Force ICE"---Icebreaker Coordination Element---modeled
in part after the Standing NATO Maritime Groups to bring together the
icebreaker fleets of U.S. allies and partners. Task Force ICE would
enable future coalitions of icebreakers to plan transits along the NSR
in concert with unmanned systems and joint aviation assets, ultimately
asserting a "free and open Arctic."

Pack Ice Packed with Legal Details

[Commentators have intermittently called for an Arctic FONOP to push
back on Russia's claims, and Congress specifically highlighted the issue
in the fiscal year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act]{.underline}
(NDAA). NDAA Sections 11219--20 direct that, within the year, "the
Secretary shall submit to . . . Congress a report that describes the
ability and timeline to conduct a transit of the NSR and periodic
transits, . . . \[a separate study\] to assess Coast Guard and
Department of Defense collaboration," and evaluate steps taken to manage
risks in Arctic Coast Guard, environmental, and commercial maritime
operations.6

Russia's law does not claim the entirety of the NSR; nor does it differ
significantly from historical Soviet doctrine on prenotification of
warship passages in the Arctic. In many ways, our Canadian neighbors
have been more outside international norms concerning Arctic claims.7 In
particular, experts note that the Russian law amends a 1998 federal law,
wherein flag states must "apply for permission to enter NSR internal
waters greater than ninety days before passage; with no more than one
warship allowed in these waters," and "a special clause requires
submarines to surface and show their flag while passing through NSR
internal waters. . . . \[The Russian\] Government reserves the right to
suspend passage for warships for security reasons."8 As U.S. Coast Guard
icebreakers are warships under the United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea definition, an NSR FONOP would require specificity in
execution and capacity.9

[Whereas Navy FONOPS are often single-ship transits, more than one
warship would be required to challenge the inland sea sovereignty in key
NSR straits that Russia asserts. Opportunity also could exist in an
announced but submerged transit by submarines]{.underline} or
~~unmanned~~ \<uncrewed\> [underwater vehicles]{.underline} (UUVs), [or
in a U.S. choice to conduct any transit without preapplication and
Russian endorsement, including in the airspace above the claimed inland
seas.]{.underline}

[Capacity, however, remains the key issue]{.underline}, as history
informs. Soviet icebreakers forced U.S. icebreakers to turn around in
1965 and 1967 during the last attempted transits through the Vilkitsky
Strait.10 The responsibility of Arctic icebreaking shifted from the Navy
to the Coast Guard in 1965, and the Chief of Naval Operations rebuffed a
recent call in Congress for Navy icebreakers and ice-strengthened
hulls.11 In the 1965 and 1967 attempts, the Coast Guard had a total of
five icebreakers; the Soviet Union's icebreaker fleet numbered 18.12
Today, Russia's icebreaker fleet numbers at least 40, with more under
construction.13 Having failed with a Russian-U.S. icebreaker ratio at
3.6:1, the Coast Guard is now forced to contemplate a transit with
icebreaker ratios nearing 20:1. More capacity and better icebreakers are
needed.

['Task Force Rush']{.underline}

[Addressing Arctic capacity should begin with increased investment in
autonomous systems and artificial intelligence]{.underline}, which
eventually should be cheaper and more plentiful than traditional manned
systems. A "Task Force Rush" at Coast Guard Sector Anchorage would speak
to the need for agility and innovation while honoring two pioneering
Revenue Cutters---both named Rush---from the Bering Sea Patrol, which
began in 1874. Task Force Rush would take inspiration from the Navy's
Task Force 59 and the Coast Guard's own unmanned systems experiments
elsewhere, developing rapid operational innovation and deploying
commercially available unmanned systems and artificial intelligence.
Task Force Rush could accelerate deployment of the unmanned aerial,
surface, and undersea vehicles industry is developing for the polar
regions. The Coast Guard flew the Puma AE unmanned aerial system from
the USCGC Healy (WAGB-20) in 2014; Saildrone operated its unmanned
surface vehicles (USVs) in the Arctic with the Coast Guard in
partnership with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) and NASA; and the Navy deployed the Bluefin-21 UUV autonomously
under the Arctic Circle in 2022.14

Task Force Rush also would support future joint integration. Before
2011, the Coast Guard District 17 Commander served as commander, Naval
Forces Alaska; some have argued the District 17 commander should also
become the Arctic joint forces maritime component commander (JFMCC).15
Whether the Coast Guard assumes JFMCC, Task Force Rush could spur the
creation of Alaska Command task forces with the 11th Air Force and 11th
Army Airborne, similar to Central Command's innovation-focused Task
Forces 99 and 39 (U.S. Air Force and Army, respectively).

[Of the new autonomous platforms, UUVs could be the most critical for
Task Force Rush. Russia requires submarines to surface when transiting.
Small, hard-to-detect UUVs could directly challenge this rule, either
compelling a Russian response or demonstrating the facile nature of
Russia's Arctic legal regimes]{.underline}.

Amplifying Arctic Aviation

[Adapting some HC-130Js with ski landing gear---similar to that on the
New York Air National Guard's LC-130H "Skibirds"---would enhance the
ability of these capable long-range surveillance aircraft to work with
the new task forces while still carrying out traditional Coast Guard
missions, such as search and rescue, in the High North. They could be
joined by P-8A Poseidons, with their sophisticated intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and electronic warfare
capabilities as well as joint datalink communication and
information-sharing systems]{.underline}. Employing Poseidons could be a
truly multinational component, as many U.S. allies fly this aircraft.
Even without skis, Coast Guard HC-130Js are equipped with a version of
the U.S. Navy's Minotaur mission system and APY-11 phased-array radar,
while the Air Force is deploying interim Link 16 capabilities on its
HC-130Js.16

At the highest end of the Arctic aviation spectrum would be an
occasional augmentation of the allied task forces with U.S. Air Force
assets, such as RC-135V/W Rivet Joint reconnaissance aircraft and B-1B
Lancer bombers, which could provide sensor and payload capabilities the
HC-130s and P-8s lack.

But why employ these exquisite airplanes when HAVs and HABs will do?
HAVs, which can be described as part blimp and part airplane, will bring
a new ability to deliver heavy equipment to austere locations. They
would be important assets in multidomain missions. The HAVs would be
contracted; the Coast Guard would not have to own them. Instead, it
would lease or hire them to emplace sensor packages in austere locations
(including ice packs), resupply far-flung Arctic outposts, and even
deliver UUVs and USVs to their point of need. HAVs are the only aircraft
that currently can set down on any flat surface: water, ice, or land.
Certified for Arctic operations, a hybrid airship that can reach the
North Pole with tourists could potentially deliver payloads anywhere in
the polar regions.17

Recent Chinese spy balloon operations are clear examples of the
potential applications of HABs for various statutory missions in the
Arctic region. These balloons--- equipped with cameras, radars, or other
sensors---could be deployed at the edge of space and maneuver using
buoyancy and wind to support civilian and military applications in areas
such as communications, search and rescue, ISR, and environmental
protection. (For more on HABs, see "Launch Mines from the Stratosphere,"
pp. 99--101.)

[One unique polar difficulty is access to internet protocol services
from satellites in low-Earth orbits, because of the orbital geometries
needed to provide communications at high latitudes. But HABs equipped
with communication and position, navigation, and timing (PNT)
capabilities could establish alternative network options in the
region]{.underline}.18 So equipped, HABs could transfer data between
task force assets, speeding response times and effectiveness in the
Arctic.

Task Force ICE & Arctic Transits

The Polar Security Cutter program is moving slowly. Until and even after
those ships are fielded, other nations and their icebreakers might
provide additional opportunities to challenge Russian claims along the
NSR. A Task Force ICE could serve as a working group of allies and
partners comprising Canada, Finland, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
and the United States---the Arctic Council countries other than
Russia.19 "Arctic 7" missions align in many cases with the Coast
Guard's. Under the auspices and endorsement of the these seven nations,
Task Force ICE could operate in principle like the Standing NATO
Maritime Groups. This task force could plan toward routine transits of
the NSR to demonstrate that commercial ships do not require Russian
escort and that Russia's inland sea claims are illegitimate.

It seems unlikely that every member of Task Force ICE could or would
provide icebreakers at the same time in a coalition transit of the NSR.
But at the very least, the task force could serve as a forum in which
participating nations would conduct a coalition equivalent of Global
Force Management to allocate icebreakers and facilitate interaction,
technological delivery, and support to Arctic and Antarctic missions, as
many states have requirements at both poles. If that same coalition did
eventually decide to attempt an NSR transit, each icebreaker would be
far better prepared if it were flanked and escorted by numerous
unmanned, Arctic-capable systems and overflown by multiple joint air
assets.

Freedom of Navigation

This past April, two Coast Guard cutters and an L3Harris Arabian Fox
MAST-13 unmanned surface vessel transited the Strait of Hormuz while
operating in support of the International Maritime Security Construct,
an 11-nation coalition led by the United States that focuses on maritime
operations near key waterways in the Middle East.20 It is easy to
imagine bombers, patrol and ISR aircraft, and HAVs or HABs providing
overwatch for a similar transit in the Arctic in the near future.

[Competition with Russia and China and new technologies have created
challenges and opportunities in the rapidly warming Arctic and its near
seas. An enlarged U.S. icebreaker fleet alone will be necessary but not
sufficient to answer the call in this new security paradigm; the Coast
Guard will need to employ multidomain capabilities in concert with
allies and partners so that Russia and China do not use the region in a
way detrimental to global security. Task Forces Rush and ICE could
answer the call---if the United States innovates boldly to employ joint,
international, and commercial means in new ways]{.underline}.

In the context of the United States\' 2022 \"National Strategy for the
Arctic Region\" and the Department of Defense\'s \"2024 Arctic
Strategy,\" [the US government should]{.underline} continue to expand
its global perspective [regarding presence and access to the
Arctic.]{.underline}

[US stakeholders should identify key priorities for capabilities and
procurement of Arctic-enabled systems, specifically domain awareness
capabilities and ice-capable ships with anti-aircraft and anti-submarine
capabilities]{.underline}, as well as streamline coordination efforts
internally as well as with NATO allies.

[US NORTHCOM must become the \"Arctic capability advocate\" envisioned
by the 2024 DoD Arctic strategy.]{.underline} This will require
increased coordination with EUCOM (North Atlantic Area of
Responsibility) and INDOPACOM (military assets and troops in Alaska),
especially regarding deployments, readiness, and exercises.

NATO must both determine its role and place in circumpolar security and
internally build its Arctic dimension and framework of operations -
without necessarily creating a full-fledged strategy or an \"Arctic
command.\" In other words, the Atlantic alliance should answer the
questions \"how much NATO\" is needed and necessary in the Arctic as
well as \"what kind of NATO\" is relevant to the region. NATO needs an
operational roadmap for the Arctic. This can be achieved by building
internal awareness and knowledge of Arctic affairs as well as taking
stock of already existing endeavors and streamlining them under one
umbrella. [This will require more information and intelligence sharing,
and ultimately better coordination, such as with the help of a dedicated
Arctic working group]{.underline}.

The Nordic allies should seek opportunities to lead in the alliance on
regional security challenges. As cooperation and collaboration continue
to grow, particularly among Norway, Sweden, and Finland, these nations
can provide needed insights and recommendations to the alliance on how
to approach the High North security challenges and lead on a
comprehensive NATO strategy.

NATO also needs to determine the contour of command and control
organization for Arctic operations, likely under JFC Norfolk. Critical
to this debate will be the interconnection with JFC Brunssum, NORAD, and
US command structures within NATO in an Arctic context.

NATO\'s role and place in Arctic military security affairs must be
caveated by a thorough discussion on the limits of NATO\'s regional
presence. The alliance should not monopolize the debate on regional hard
security issues, nor should it be the sole and only arena of discussion.
NATO must find an appropriate balance between minimal presence and
over-militarizing Arctic affairs.

In terms of future governance, the Arctic needs a dedicated military
security architecture - although the exact format and what it would fall
under remain to be determined. The Arctic 7 must learn to bridge
diverging national views on circumpolar security, especially what
constitutes defense and security priorities within the current threat
environment. The Arctic 7 should collectively agree on what represents
acceptable, legitimate, and nonthreatening military operations at
peacetime in the region. This could be achieved by creating an Arctic
Military Code of Conduct.

Discussions around Arctic military security affairs should come with the
caveat that they should as far as possible not securitize the debate.
The intrusion of geopolitics and a hard security discourse in the Arctic
must not take wider discussions hostage or overshadow the conversation
on the impact of climate change, environmental protection, or human
security in the region.

[Arctic-specific deterrence must consider effectively limiting nefarious
behavior from Russia, while avoiding the risk of miscalculation and
horizontal escalation. Deterrence must also factor in critical regional
choke points such as the GIUK-GIN gaps and the Bering
Strait]{.underline}.

[Integrated Arctic deterrence should focus on imposing cost on continued
low-intensity warfare operations and other forms of subthreshold
destabilization visible in the region such as air incursions, snap
military exercises, GNSS/GPS jamming and electronic warfare operations,
and subsea warfare activities]{.underline}.

[The Arctic is ripe for contestation with emerging and disruptive
technologies]{.underline}. [The regional threat environment requires new
technologies to better identify threats - especially low-intensity
warfare activities coming from Russia and China - and achieve overall
domain awareness]{.underline}.

[Future deterrence concepts will have to stay relevant in the face of
modern technologies, especially considering remote access to a changing
Arctic]{.underline}.

[Finding the appropriate balance between human presence and remote
access will inform US and NATO procurement requirements for future
Arctic operations in key technology sectors, particularly uncrewed
platforms, autonomous systems, and space-based assets]{.underline}.

[Continued investments in Arctic-specific hardware and equipment are
paramount for successfully deterring Russia\'s contestation efforts and
potential Chinese encroachments]{.underline}. [As part of multidomain
threat detection, comprehensive domain awareness must be prioritized
through aerial surveillance, maritime domain awareness, space-based
assets, and in the cyber domain and across the electromagnetic
spectrum]{.underline}.

New Trade Routes, New Economic Opportunity The Arctic region has been
warming four times faster than the rest of the world over the past four
decades, according to a 2022 study by Finnish and Norwegian scientists.
[Scientists are projecting that by [2035, parts of]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} will be [free of ice during summer]{.mark} months,
[open]{.mark}ing [up]{.mark} prospects for [commercial shipping]{.mark}
to ply these waters and [shorten transit time between]{.mark} the [U.S.,
Europe and Asia]{.mark}. Some studies project that Arctic [routes could
be]{.mark} 30% to [50% shorter than]{.mark} the [Suez]{.mark} Canal [and
Panama Canal]{.mark} routes, with [transit time reduced by]{.mark} an
estimated [14 to 20 days]{.mark}. Beyond commercial shipping, the new
routes could attract cruise ships and adventure tourists. Access not
only creates opportunities for the maritime sector, but the region is
rich in fossil fuels, critical minerals and marine life. Commercial
industries potentially will gain access to billions of dollars of
untapped resources. Unlike Antarctica, a land mass, there is no treaty
protecting the Arctic from international development. This makes
[control over]{.mark} the [waterways]{.mark} and natural resources [ripe
for dispute and]{.mark} potential [conflict]{.mark}. The race to build
infrastructure to support and control navigation has already
begun.]{.underline} Northern Sea Route, Northwest Passage and Future
Trans-Arctic Shipping Route The Northern Sea Route (NSR) was first
opened by the Soviet Union in the 1930s but has not been a reliable
transit route due to ice coverage. Climate change is changing that.
Russia claims that the NSR lies within its territorial waters, giving it
exclusive rights to develop the area and patrol ships. The U.S. and
other countries dispute this claim, saying it runs through international
waters. Seeing the emerging opportunity, Russia has been refurbishing
more than 50 Soviet bases, providing them with strategic ports and
sending a political message that the NSR is under Russian sovereignty.
Canada claims the Northwest Passage (NWP) is located in internal
Canadian waters and subject to Canadian law and sovereignty. The U.S.
and Europe disagree, arguing it also is an international strait and
subject to freedom of navigation under the Law of the Sea. To date,
there are very few ports along the NWP, with Churchill being the only
deep-water port with shelter and berthing facilities. There are no
deep-water ports along the North Slope of Alaska or throughout the
Canadian Archipelago. But this is changing. The U.S. has plans to build
its first deep-water Arctic port in Nome, Alaska, and Canada is planning
a deep-water port in Qikiqtarjuaq, Nanuvut, which is located at the
entrance to the NWP. The Trans-Arctic Route, which cuts straight across
the North Pole, avoids the territorial waters of Arctic states and lies
in international high seas. Currently, and probably until mid-century,
it is only navigable by nuclear icebreakers.

#### Warming makes Arctic shipping routes that weren't viable before hugely appealing to states

Arctic," Emory International Law Review, Vol. 38 Iss 2, pg. lexis, ALB\]

I. Climate Change and the Arctic

A. Melting of Ice and New Resources

As measured by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, the Arctic Circle
consists of 5.5 million square miles. The definitions provided by UNCLOS
\[\*458\] Article 56 allow the United States, Canada, Russia, Iceland,
Norway, and Denmark (via Greenland) to claim Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZs) in the Arctic Circle.

While exact figures remain unknown, [scientists have estimated the
Arctic contains \"almost 22 percent of the undiscovered resources in the
world that can be harvested using existing technology]{.underline}.\"
According to estimates from the American Geological Survey, these
[undiscovered resources include \"90 billion barrels\" of oil and gas
reserves, \"1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 44 billion
barrels of natural gas liquids]{.underline}.\" [Although the Arctic\'s
resources are vast, technological limits, the severe Arctic climate, and
the polar ice caps have long hindered extraction of these
resources]{.underline}. [However, rising global temperatures stand to
remove these barriers as ice caps melt and Arctic ice
recedes]{.underline}.

[In 2005, the Arctic ice cap shrunk to a historic low. Scientists
predict that this melting, if it continues, will eventually result in a
\"seasonal sea nearly five times the size of the Mediterranean,\"
exposing these vast amounts of untapped Arctic seabed resources and
opening the potential for resource excavation and extraction, as well as
clearing the way for new and efficient trade routes]{.underline}. As
state interest often drives action at the international level, [tensions
could rise among the Arctic states and between Arctic and non-Arctic
states as they begin to vie for resources and access to strategic trade
routes]{.underline}. Arctic law must adapt to handle the corresponding
pollution and environmental harm that will come with increased ship
traffic and development of the Arctic.

\[\*459\] B. Trade Routes

[Climate change not only reveals physical resources, but also strategic
resources. Currently, the Suez and Panama Canal routes both serve as
important trade routes between Asia and Europe.]{.underline} However,
[the melting of Arctic ice has made previously inaccessible routes a
reality]{.underline}. [For instance, while travel between East Asia and
Western Europe typically involves a distance of 24,000 kilometers via
the Panama Canal, the Arctic Northwest Passage (NWP) route could shorten
the distance to only 13,600 kilometers]{.underline}. Although currently
in existence, [the NWP does not yet have status as a commercially viable
trade route due to current Arctic conditions]{.underline}. Ships can
only navigate the passage during summer months, and the presence of
year-round ice hinders profitability. [However, if Arctic ice continues
to recede, the route could become popular, and thus an economic boon to
those able to utilize it.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [climate change could increase the viability of the
Northern Sea Route (NSR). Travel between East Asia and Western Europe
via the Suez Canal typically involves a distance of 21,000
kilometers.]{.underline} T[hrough the NSR along Russia\'s Arctic coast,
however, travel would only involve a distance of 12,800 kilometers and
reduce travel time by ten to fifteen days compared to the Suez Canal
route]{.underline}. Although Russia opened the NSR route for
international transit in 2009 and has since invested significant
resources in its development, the NSR has yet to reach large-scale
commercial viability. Uncertainty as to the \"duration of the viable
navigation season\" combined with \"disparities arising in the oceanic
and sea ice regimes in th\[e\] region\" currently hinder the route\'s
profitability. But [as Arctic ice continues to melt, the route\'s
viability will increase, and many speculate the NSR may become the first
maritime route free of Arctic ice.]{.underline} [Both China and Russia
appear interested in turning the NSR into a trade passage, having
invested heavily in relevant infrastructure]{.underline}.

#### The future of China-Russia cooperation determines shipping routes in the Arctic -- evidence sees high probability for collaboration 

**Klimenko 18** \[Ekaterina Klimenko; Klimenko joined SIPRI as a

\-- CL

On 26 January 2018 China's State Council Information Office published a
white paper clarifying China's vision of the Arctic, its intentions,
goals and objectives in the region. According to the paper, [[China sees
itself as a 'near Arctic state']{.mark}, a stakeholder and 'an active
participant, builder and contributor' when it comes to the scientific
research, commercial development of the Arctic, and Arctic
governance.]{.underline} The paper emphasizes China's respect for the
international law frameworks and institutions governing the Arctic, its
recognition of the legal jurisdictions of the Arctic states in their
respective areas of the Arctic Ocean and respect for indigenous peoples
inhabiting the Arctic. In return, [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} expects
mutual respect from the Arctic states and [[emphasizes that]{.mark}
within the current framework of international law, [China]{.mark}, as
any other non-Arctic state, [has th]{.mark}e right for 'scientific
research, navigation, overflight, fishing, laying of submarine cables
and pipelines in the high seas and other relevant sea areas in the
Arctic Ocean, and [rights to resource exploration and exploitation in
the Area']{.mark}.]{.underline} The document stipulates China's
commercial interest in the Arctic, including development of resources
and shipping routes[. [China's]{.mark} grandiose infrastructure project,
the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road
(Belt and Road Initiative/[BRI]{.mark}), is specifically referred to,
thereby officially [linking]{.mark} the BRI [with the Arctic
region]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to the white paper[, [the BRI
will bring 'opportunities]{.mark} for parties concerned [to jointly
build a "Polar Silk Road]{.mark}"'. [Connecting the BRI with shipping
routes in the Arctic, and the]{.mark} Northern Sea Route ([NSR) is not a
new idea for]{.mark} either Chinese nor [Russia]{.mark}n government
officials and policy institutions]{.underline}. In June 2017, China's
National Development and Reform Commission and the State Oceanic
Administration published, 'A Vision for Maritime Cooperation under the
Belt and Road Initiative', which stressed China's intentions for
cooperation with relevant Arctic states in the region. On several
occasions, [high-level Russian politicians--including President Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}--[revealed the intention to develop cooperation with
China on the 'Ice Silk Road'.]{.mark} [China and Russia already have
ambitious joint projects in the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and [China's Silk Road
Fund]{.mark} together [own]{.mark} almost [30 per cent of]{.mark}
Russia's [NOVATEK]{.mark} project, Yamal LNG. NOVATEK, the biggest
Russian non-state natural gas producer, is also reviewing the Arctic LNG
2 project with Chinese partners]{.underline}. Development of the Arctic
LNG 2 project and other oil and gas projects in the Russian Arctic will
significantly impact the intensity of shipping traffic along the NSR.
The prospects of cooperation between China and Russia are, however, not
free from possible contradictions in the vision of the cooperation on
the 'Cold Silk Road'. Just recently, the Russian Government gave the
rights for transporting hydrocarbons along the NSR exclusively to
Russian shipping companies. In the past, all Chinese shipping companies
operating on the NSR have complied with the rules of navigation enforced
by Russia. However, China's Arctic Policy emphasizes the freedom of
navigation and the right of China to use the Arctic shipping route. At
the same time[, [the mutual interests between Russia and
China]{.underline}]{.mark} [as well as Russia's desire to attract
Chinese investments into the development of the Russian Arctic [could
provide a solid base for compromise. To a large extent, such cooperation
will determine the future of the NSR.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Russia is already positing to take shipping control over the NSR.

**Overfield 22**, \[Cornell Overfield is an analyst at the Center for
Naval Analyses, the Navy's federally funded research and development
center, 10-17-2022, \"Wrangling Warships: Russia's Proposed Law on
Northern Sea Route Navigation\", Default,
https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/wrangling-warships-russias-proposed-law-northern-sea-route-navigation\]//WMD

The governance of the Northern Sea Route competes with the extension of
continental shelves for the title of most contentious and widely
misunderstood aspect of Arctic law. [[Russia]{.mark} claims certain
[jurisdictions]{.mark} [over]{.mark} the Northern Sea Route
([NSR)]{.mark} that the United States and some other states find
expansive and [incompatible with international]{.mark}
[law]{.mark}.]{.underline} To date, these do not apply to foreign
warships, but a recent Russian legislative initiative seeks to change
this. [An amendment proposed on Aug. 4 would [require]{.mark}, among
other things, diplomatic [clearance]{.mark} [for]{.mark} any foreign
[warships]{.mark} [transiting the straits]{.mark} of the Northern Sea
Route.]{.underline} As of Oct. 17, however, the proposal remains a
draft. The Russian lawmakers who drafted the proposal present it as a
neat, [[legal solution to Russia's desire]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
[control]{.mark} navigation by all users in [the]{.mark} Russian
[Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, Moscow's past legal claims
actually undercut the proposal's legal argument that Russia today enjoys
total control over foreign navigation in the covered internal waters.
Instead, a regime of innocent passage clearly applies to the internal
waters of the Northern Sea Route. As climate change reshapes the
[Arctic, Russian [officials]{.mark} [hope]{.mark} that it will also
[reshape the patterns of global trade]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In recent
years, Moscow has promoted the Northeast Passageas a new artery that
will save time and money for shipping between Europe and
Asia]{.underline}. This vision has not yet panned out in practice[;
destination shipping moving Russian natural resources to markets far
outweighs Europe-to-Asia shipping, and international traffic collapsed
in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline} Still, Russia
has introduced governance regimes that aim to make the [Northeast
Passage an artery for global trade [while maintaining control over
commercial]{.mark} [navigation]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Figure 1).
Russia's Law on Internal Waters and Territorial Sea and Codex for Trade
Activities define the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and require foreign
commercial vessels to seek prior permission before entering the NSR
zone, as well as adhere to requirements on icebreaker and ice pilotage
services.

#### Militarization of the Arctic solves economic interests -- Russia is a threat

"NATO Needs a Strategy to Address Russia's Arctic Expansion". https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/nato-needs-a-strategy-to-address-russias-arctic-expansion/)**

This week, NATO will hold its landmark seventy-fifth anniversary summit.
The Washington, DC, event is expected to focus on trade security, the
war in Ukraine, and the organization's greatest adversary, Russia. This
comes on the heels of news that a record twenty-three out of thirty-two
NATO countries will reach the Alliance's defense spending target of 2
percent of gross domestic product this year, according to NATO
statistics published on June 17. This increase in spending is in large
part a direct response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. At
the same time, [the danger Russia poses extends well beyond Eastern
Europe.]{.underline} The Washington summit provides the Alliance an
opportune moment to develop a strategy to address [[Russia's growing,
and unsettling, Arctic presence]{.mark}, which [is connected
with]{.mark} Moscow's complex [cooperation with China]{.mark} in the
region [and]{.mark} with [new sea lanes opening due to]{.mark}
accelerated [ice melting]{.mark} in the region. [Russia has long viewed
the Arctic as a crucial source of]{.mark} income, national pride, and
[strategic importance]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Russian military has
continued to establish an outsized Arctic presence even during its war
in Ukraine, now consisting of the Northern Fleet, nuclear submarines,
radar stations, airfields, and missile facilities. A large share of this
presence is concentrated in the Kola Peninsula, near NATO allies
Finland, Sweden, and Norway. According to the International Institute
for Strategic Studies, Russia operates one-third more military bases in
the Arctic Circle than all NATO members put together. [Moscow's interest
in securing its trade routes in the High North has been boosted by
Russia's alignment with Beijing.]{.underline} NATO members should note
that [Russia has outpaced the Alliance in its establishment and usage of
trade corridors in the Arctic region, funded heavily by Chinese
investment. [Transporting energy and mineral commodities via the]{.mark}
Northern Sea Route ([NSR]{.mark}) [presents strong advantages to
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}: staying within its territory and
circumventing the Suez Canal shortens Russian tankers' trips to China by
about ten days per journey. [As climate change warms the Arctic at a
pace far exceeding other parts of the world, [the viability of the NSR
will increase]{.mark} and the region's [strategic importance
will]{.mark} continue to [grow]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically,
Russian energy in the High North has been dispatched using ships
specially built to navigate sea ice, but in September 2023, the first
shipment was sent using a conventional, non-ice class oil tanker due to
high levels of summer ice melt, an increasingly common phenomenon. "The
energy crisis that has emerged from the Ukraine war has been building
for decades," Paul Sullivan, an energy and international relations
professor at Johns Hopkins University, told us. "[[Russia's]{.mark}
development of Arctic LNG \[liquefied natural gas\] and [usage of the
NSR should be of top concern to NATO countries]{.mark} with concerns
about the precarity of energy sources and trade routes, respectively."
[Russia's economic dependence]{.mark} on exporting its extensive energy
and mineral resources [has led to strengthened cooperation with
China]{.mark}, an imperfect relationship based on mutual
need.]{.underline} Chinese state-owned energy enterprises have in the
past five years invested billions of dollars in Russian oil and gas
ventures and mineral projects in the Arctic. Since facing Western
sanctions, Russian reallocation of its crude oil supply to a discounted
Chinese market cemented the partnership between the two nations. Since
then, this infrastructure investment for ports, pipelines, mines, and
railways has surged. Moscow's interest in securing its trade routes in
the High North has been boosted by Russia's alignment with Beijing,
which has affirmed its own involvement in the region as a "near-Arctic
state." For example, Russian and Chinese vessels were spotted in August
2023 conducting joint military exercises near Alaska's Aleutian Islands.
That said, NATO members rethinking Arctic strategies should take a
clear-eyed approach as to the extent of the "no limits" partnership
between Moscow and Beijing. At the beginning of June, the Russian gas
market announced a pause of the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline to China.
The deal has reportedly stalled over monopsonistic Chinese demands to
pay drastically lower prices for lower quantities of gas. NATO's Arctic
member states---the United States, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Finland, and Iceland---remain intent on maintaining free and navigable
Arctic shipping lanes and are exploring their own energy and mineral
resource projects in the region. Jennifer Spence, the project director
of the Arctic Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center,
explained to us that "[in these remote areas, [military and economic
infrastructure development go hand in hand]{.mark}---[securitization of
the Arctic can]{.mark} help [facilitate investments in a more
diversified economy]{.mark} for Arctic states."]{.underline}

#### US dominance of Arctic shipping routes key to the economy 

**Forsyth 18** (Michael J., former chief of staff of the Alaskan NORAD
(North American Aerospace Defense Command) Region and Alaskan Command at
Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson, Alaska, then the director of the U.S.
Army School of Command Preparation, "Why Alaska and the Arctic are
Critical to the National Security of the United States,"
https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Journals/Military-Review/English-Edition-Archives/January-February-2018/Why-Alaska-and-the-Arctic-are-Critical-to-the-National-Security-of-the-United-States/)-MZ

Alaska makes the United States an [[Arctic]{.mark} nation]{.underline},
and its location places the state and country at the center of this
fast-evolving region.2 Thus, Alaska is critical to the national security
of the United States; however, we are not, as a nation, keeping pace
with the rapidly changing security situation in the Arctic. Lagging here
could also have an enormous impact on our economy. To change this
dynamic, there are several things that the U.S. military can do to
ensure the future security of the region. "Alaska is the most strategic
place on earth," stated Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell in testimony before
Congress in 1935.3 The reason for this bold statement is that Alaska is
the closest U.S. location to the center of the Northern Hemisphere (see
figure 1). The state is singularly closer to many national capitals in
the hemisphere than most points in the lower forty-eight states. This
makes Alaska the perfect power projection platform for the United States
from a military standpoint. Further, because Alaska sits astride the
Bering Strait chokepoint and the Great Circle Routes between North
America and Asia as can be seen in figure 2 (on page 115), it is
[[critical to]{.mark} our [economic and national
security]{.mark}]{.underline}.4 The air lanes and sea lanes of the Great
Circle Routes are heavily [[trafficked by shipping]{.mark}
companies]{.underline} because [they [shorten]{.mark} the
[distance]{.mark}]{.underline} between the two continents,
[[saving]{.mark} [time and money]{.mark} for shippers]{.underline}.
Consequently, the city of Anchorage and [Alaska]{.underline} are at the
[[center of]{.mark} existing [commercial]{.mark}
[shipping]{.mark}]{.underline} lanes between East and West. Anchorage,
at roughly the halfway point between the major commerce centers of North
America and Asia, is an [important [hub for]{.mark} such [international
corporations]{.mark}]{.underline} as Federal Express and DHL.5 Moreover,
many nations such as China and Russia are routinely making use of these
routes for their economic benefit. However, while Alaska is critical to
intercontinental shipping now[, emerging routes due to shrinking ice
impediments]{.underline} could [raise]{.underline} the state's [economic
stature]{.underline} to even greater heights. The [retreat of
ice]{.underline} coverage in the Arctic Ocean has [opened up the
potential for shipping along the Northern Sea Route and the fabled
Northwest Passage]{.underline} (see figure 3, page 116).6 The Northern
Sea Route parallels Russia's Arctic coastline, as much of it is within
the country's exclusive economic zone. In the past few years, shipping
along this route has increased, topping out with seventy-one passages in
2013.7 [Moving goods along]{.underline} this [route cuts]{.underline}
off [thousands of miles]{.underline}, [saving money on]{.underline}
[fuel costs and insurance]{.underline} (since there are no pirates along
this route).8 Moreover, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is [facilitating
passages through the use of its large icebreaker fleet]{.underline},
making her an [[indispensable player]{.mark} in shipping]{.underline}
through the High North while [[profiting]{.underline}]{.mark} from such
transit [[by charging fees for services]{.mark} akin to a
toll]{.underline}.9 Thus, the emerging Northwest Passage has recently
become a possibility for shippers. For centuries, explorers and
adventurers sought a route from Europe to Asia across Canada's High
North. Most of these individuals failed in this attempt, but now the
dream is nearing reality. In 2017, the luxury cruise liner Crystal
Serenity made a trip through the Northwest Passage starting from Seward,
Alaska, and terminating in New York City.10 While much of the Northwest
Passage remains difficult to navigate due to remaining heavy ice pack,
continued ice retreat could make this route feasible in the future.
Alaska's position on the east side of the Bering Strait places the state
in a central position on the choke point of both routes. However, with
increasing human activity, it is inevitable that disagreements among
nations making claims in the area will arise as competition heats up.
Again, Alaska's location thrusts her to the forefront of strategic
calculations that the United States must make to deal with emerging
geopolitical and geoeconomic circumstances. Incidentally, what makes the
Great Circle Route good for shipping also makes it the preferred route
for the employment of missiles aimed at North America. As previously
noted, this route shortens the distance between the two continents. Just
as shippers prefer the route because the reduced distance saves time and
money, the same principle of distance holds true for ballistic missiles.
Potential adversaries could fire weapons along this trajectory to close
the distance more quickly while lessening the potential for early
warning to their attacks. Thus, Alaska's location makes the state a
critical component of the nation's ballistic missile defense system. In
addition to the great potential for shipping through the Arctic, there
is considerable capacity for economic expansion based on the [[abundant
natural resources]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. There are across
the [entire Arctic [oil, gas, coal, rare-earth metals, and
fisheries]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is estimated that [[13 percent
of]{.mark} the [undiscovered oil]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[30 percent
of]{.mark} the [gas]{.mark} worldwide is [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[region]{.underline}]{.mark}, along with a [host of other
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}.11 As a result, Arctic nations are very
interested in [tap]{.underline}ping [into these to [facilitate economic
growth]{.mark}]{.underline} [and [generate revenue]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The retreat of sea ice and glacial melt is making these [resources [more
accessible]{.mark} to]{.underline} Arctic and [interested near-Arctic
nations]{.underline} like China. The desire to obtain this mineral and
energy wealth is stimulating competition among these countries. All of
the Arctic nations have made claims beyond their exclusive economic
zones on the outer continental shelf so that they have exclusive right
to exploit these resources (see figure 4, page 117). Claims are made
under the auspices of the United Nations (UN), which then adjudicates
them according to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The problem
is that many of these claims overlap, complicating the UN's ability to
judge in a manner satisfactory to all the claimants. This in turn gives
rise to friction among the nations as they increasingly confront each
other. Herein lies the potential for conflict in the Arctic region,
which has heretofore been known for regional cooperation and peace.

### Russian Econ Heg Bad

#### Dominant Russian economy means increased chance of war

While higher public spending has underpinned much of the growth in
recorded GDP, Russia's federal government deficits have remained
relatively small, at approximately 2% of GDP in 2022 and 2023. Revenues
from, for example, oil taxes have remained high despite the oil embargo
and the oil price cap imposed on Russian oil countries by coalition of
countries against Russia's war on Ukraine In short, available data show
that the [[Russian economy]{.underline}]{.mark} is [progressively
becoming [militarised]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Economic]{.mark} activity
is [dominated]{.mark} by increased government]{.underline} spending and
supported by high revenues from energy exports. The structure of the
[economy has changed]{.underline} as more and [[more resources]{.mark}
have been [poured into waging]{.mark} the [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Some sectors and some regions have been winners in [Russia's new
[war-oriented economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is especially true for
some of Russia's poorest regions, where the [war has [offered]{.mark}
many people upward social mobility that was not available in the
preceding decades of Russia's reintegration into global
economy]{.underline}. At the same time, the economy is approximately at
full capacity so that [further [increases in military
production]{.mark}]{.underline} will likely to be met with high
inflation or further decreases of the civilian economy. Moreover, uneven
growth across sectors and regions due to [[exploding military
spending]{.underline}]{.mark} creates distortions not only for the
current economy but also for future dynamics. Economic sanctions Russia
has been under sanctions since 2014 when Russia illegally annexed Crimea
and sent its troops to the Donbas. Full-scale invasion triggered many
rounds of sanctions from the EU countries, the US, the UK and many other
allies. In a surprise move, Western countries froze the international
assets of the Bank of Russia that were invested in their jurisdictions
on 24 February 2022. Hilgenstock et al. (2024) estimate that these
frozen assets were worth some \$300 billion. On 21 May 2024, the EU
decided to use the proceeds (around €3 billion) from these frozen funds
to support Ukraine. Economic sanctions constrained the Russian
government in its ability to wage war, but the implementation and design
of sanctions blunted their effectiveness. For example, restrictions were
incomplete and phased in gradually. Some Russian banks continue to have
access to SWIFT, a bank messaging system. Europe's deadline for stopping
import of Russian oil was in December 2022 rather than February 2022 and
the oil price cap neutralised some of the effects of the EU embargo,
which originally included an embargo on the provision of services for
Russian seaborn oil. These deficiencies gave the Russian government
ample space to find workarounds and exploit loopholes. For instance, as
no decision had been made to stop trade with Russia and Europe remained
dependent on Russian energy, it was necessary to leave certain channels
for cross-border transactions open. Gazprombank, one of Russia's largest
banks, and Raiffeisen Bank, a large Austrian bank, are exempted from
sanctions. Not surprisingly, the [Russian financial system has been able
to adapt]{.underline}. Have sanctions failed? No. They have achieved
what they could considering their limited nature, a macroeconomic
environment supportive to Russia for an extended period, authorities'
preparations in recent years and their policy response, as well as
support for Russia from countries outside of the sanctions coalition. At
the same time, [Russia's [ability to finance]{.mark} the
[war]{.mark}]{.underline} critically depends on energy exports and thus
remains vulnerable to future sanctions. Furthermore, the Russian economy
continues to rely heavily on Western technology, a potential choke
point. Finally, secondary sanctions can significantly tighten the screw
and therefore inhibit Russia's economic and military capabilities.

[[Russia's economic]{.underline}]{.mark} **resilience is defying
expectations,** [[enabling]{.mark} the [Kremlin to sustain]{.mark} its
[war efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} **in Ukraine despite mounting
challenges, and raising doubts about hopes for a swift resolution.**
[Russia [regained]{.mark} the [momentum on]{.mark} the
[battlefield]{.mark}]{.underline} **in Ukraine last year. Although
Russian progress remains slow and costly, the outlook for the year ahead
is bleak. Ukraine's energy system has been heavily damaged by Russian
air strikes, and its forces continue to lose ground in southern Donetsk,
where the heaviest fighting is taking place. Perhaps most importantly,
political shifts in some of Kyiv's key allies -- especially the US --
could result in crucial financial and military aid being substantially
reduced in the year ahead. Together, these trends raise the prospect of
Ukraine being forced to accept a crushing defeat after three years of
heroic resistance. Against this lugubrious backdrop, many analysts have
seized on what appears to be a rare bright spot: Russia's faltering 'war
economy', which -- according to some -- is 'Putin's greatest weakness'.
An acute labour shortage, persistent and rising inflation caused by
soaring military expenditure, and ever-tightening sanctions will -- it
is claimed -- finally bring about an economic crisis that will force
Moscow to abandon its maximalist aims in Ukraine and bring about an end
to the war on terms more acceptable to Kyiv and its allies. Sadly, these
hopes are likely to prove misplaced.** [[Russia's
economy]{.underline}]{.mark} **has confounded expectations throughout
the war and, despite suffering several complications, remains**
[[well-placed to support]{.mark} the Kremlin's [ambitions in Ukraine and
beyond]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Dashed Hopes... This is not the first
time that Kyiv's supporters have placed their hopes in Russia's economy
proving to be its Achilles' heel. In the early months of the war,
analysts forecast that Russia would suffer a severe and long recession
that would cause living standards to slump and the state's fiscal
resources to dwindle. Moscow, it was hoped, would be forced to make an
embarrassing retreat with potentially fatal consequences for President
Vladimir Putin and the ruling elite. But these hopes were soon dashed.
The** [[imposition of capital controls]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a**
[[surge in]{.mark} federal [expenditure]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and
the** [[successful reorientation]{.mark} of foreign
[trade]{.mark}]{.underline} **at breakneck speed arrested the signs of
economic distress observed in the first months of the war. Although
Russia did not avoid a recession in 2022, it was much shallower than
expected (GDP fell by only 1.9%) as the economy adapted to its new
circumstances.** [[Growth exceeded]{.mark} nearly all
[expectations]{.mark}]{.underline} **in 2023 (3.6%), with this momentum
continuing into 2024. Output is likely to have expanded by 3.6--4% last
year. ...Raised Again Nevertheless, the quantitative expansion of the
last two years has been accompanied by growing signs of weakness on
several important economic indicators, raising questions over the
quality and sustainability of Russia's better-than-expected performance.
Mounting labour shortages, fuelled by the demands of war, are just one
factor that threatens to derail growth. The massive expansion of the
military and defence-industrial production has drawn large numbers of
men away from the civilian labour force. Although Russia undoubtedly
faces significant challenges, there is** [[little to suggest]{.mark}
that these will result in any significant political [consequences
that]{.mark} might [prompt]{.mark} the [Kremlin to rein]{.mark} in its
[ambitions in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} **Along with rising demand
from other sectors of the** [briskly [growing
economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**, this has caused the supply of labour to
tighten considerably. Unemployment reached 2.3% in October, a
post-Soviet record low. Maintaining the current rate of economic growth
will only be possible if Russia utilises its existing labour force more
efficiently. Labour shortages are not the Kremlin's only problem.
Western sanctions and a shrinking trade surplus contributed to a sharp
depreciation of the ruble last year, causing import prices to rise and
amplifying inflationary pressures. At the end of November, the Central
Bank of Russia (CBR) recorded an annual inflation rate of 8.9%, well
above the bank's target rate of 4%. Even this rate likely understates
the real extent of price growth, with some staple goods registering
price increases in excess of 70%. In an attempt to quell inflationary
pressures, the CBR raised the key rate throughout the year, setting it
at a post-Soviet high of 21% in October. Many businesses now find the
cost of borrowing prohibitive. Many analysts have attributed these signs
of overheating to elevated spending on the war in Ukraine, pointing to
record-high military expenditure which is expected to have reached over
7% of GDP in 2024. With** [[defence spending]{.mark} expected to
[rise]{.mark} by nearly [25%]{.mark}]{.underline} **this year,
accounting for** [around 40% of federal government
expenditure,]{.underline} **some have raised the prospect of Russia
slipping into 'stagflation', combining high inflation with low to no
growth. Finally, with new UK and US sanctions targeting Russia's oil
industry, and G7 states seeking to tighten the enforcement of the oil
'price cap', some hope that Moscow's vital hydrocarbon revenues will be
crimped even further, exacerbating the losses caused by the collapse of
Russian gas exports to Europe and flagging coal sales. Desperate but not
Serious Unfortunately, hopes of an imminent economic crisis are unlikely
to be realised. Although Russia undoubtedly faces significant
challenges, there is little to suggest that these will result in any
significant political consequences that might prompt the Kremlin to rein
in its ambitions in Ukraine. The tight labour market has benefitted many
Russians used to stagnant income growth in the decade before the war.
Real wages have soared since 2022, fuelling the fastest sustained growth
in consumer spending in over a decade.** [[Soaring military
production]{.underline}]{.mark} **and record-high wages for soldiers
have helped reduce some of Russia's chronic regional inequalities.
Crucially, the absence of a large pool of latent labour need not
constrain growth so long as labour productivity continues to rise.
Russia's low-productivity economy means that there are** [plenty of
[easy wins available]{.mark}]{.underline} **for firms prepared to
undertake simple organisational changes or investment in new machinery.
Inflation also has its advantages. Rising prices send important signals
to firms to expand supply by investing in areas where prices are growing
fastest.** [[Investment]{.underline}]{.mark} **-- chronically low for
most of the post-Soviet period --** [has [grown faster]{.mark} than GDP
[since the war]{.mark} began]{.underline}**. Rising prices have also
helped swell public coffers, with turnover taxes like VAT growing at
record levels and boosting the Kremlin's fiscal position. The CBR's
record-high key rate is not as damaging as it might be in a Western
economy, either. Large swathes of Russian business -- including those in
strategically important sectors -- can access state-subsidised loans at
considerably lower interest rates. Even those firms unable to access
subsidised loans will be able to use record-high retained earnings to
finance investment. Russian consumers have also benefitted from state
support. Most mortgages offered during the recent housing boom were
taken on at subsidised rates. Even the extent to which Russia has a 'war
economy' is exaggerated. While the broad NATO measure of military
expenditure is likely to account for around 40% of federal spending this
year, this will amount to closer to 20% of Russia's consolidated state
spending (that is, including both regional and national expenditure).
Although this is high, it is comparable to US military spending during
the Vietnam War. The** [[militarisation]{.mark} of the [economy]{.mark}
has undoubtedly [grown]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, it remains well
below the crippling levels observed in the 'hyper-militarised' Soviet
economy. Importantly, many of the features of true war economies -- such
as price controls, the centralised allocation of resources, and
widespread nationalisation of private sector assets -- have yet to
appear in Russia. Sources of Resilience If Russia's weaknesses are not
as severe as many hope, its sources of strength and durability also
remain impressive. Take the country's balance sheet. Despite fighting
the most intense war in Europe since 1945,** [[Moscow]{.mark} has
managed to [fund the war]{.mark}]{.underline} **with staggeringly modest
budget deficits of between 1.5--2.9% of GDP since 2022. As a result, the
Kremlin has barely had to borrow to fund the war. At around 15% of GDP,
Russia has the smallest state debt-to-GDP ratio of the G20 economies.
Despite being cut off from most external sources of capital, Russia
remains more than capable of financing domestic investment and
government expenditure with its own resources. Over the past two years,
Russia has recorded a surplus on its current account -- that is, the gap
between aggregate savings and investment -- of around 2.5% of GDP. For
as long as Russia can continue to export large volumes of oil, this is
unlikely to change. Designed to ensure that the Kremlin can pursue a
sovereign foreign policy against the interests of the collective West,**
[[Russia\'s economic system]{.mark} is [doing its
job]{.mark}]{.underline} **Crucially, the Kremlin's fiscal position
remains very healthy. Tax revenues generated by domestic activity have
soared since the war began. Oil and gas revenues are forecast to account
for 28% of federal government tax receipts in 2024, significantly lower
than the 53% recorded in 2018. Even if export revenues slump, perhaps
due to a looming trade war or China's spluttering economy,** [Russia has
plenty of resources it could tap to maintain elevated levels of state
spending]{.underline}**. The largely state-owned banking system is
sitting on piles of cash that could be paid as dividends to their owner:
the state. Banks could also be directed to buy government bonds, as they
were at the end of 2024. If all else fails, the CBR could buy government
bonds. Importantly, Russia's resilience is not purely financial in
nature. The foundations of the market economy built in the turbulent
1990s remain strong. Much of Russia's unexpected adaptability has come
not only from its well-trained and professional economic managers, but
also from its large and growing class of private business. Accustomed to
operating in an often hostile and challenging business environment,
privately owned firms have exploited the opportunities created by
sanctions to supply soaring demand from the government and consumers.
The number of registered private businesses has grown briskly since the
war began, reaching a record high in 2024. It is this strong base of
commercially oriented firms that will enable Russia to continue adapting
to sanctions and the demands of war. Calibrating Expectations To be
clear, Russia's economic prospects are far from rosy. Property rights
remain weak, and the** [state's role in the economy is high and
growing]{.underline}**. The vagaries of the international oil market
always retain the potential to generate a strong external shock. Western
sanctions will also continue to raise the cost of doing business and
restrict the flow of know-how to Russian businesses. As a result, Russia
is unlikely to join the ranks of high-income countries any time soon.
However, the country's poor long-term prognosis should not lead us to
overlook its short-term resilience. Throughout its 500-year history,
Russia's economic system has rarely delivered broad-based growth or
economy-wide innovation for long. Instead, the needs of the market have
usually been subordinated to the needs of the state, often to enable the
Kremlin to pursue security-related objectives. Today's system is no
different.** [Designed to ensure that the Kremlin can pursue a sovereign
foreign policy against the interests of the collective West, it is doing
its job]{.underline}**. The** [[market]{.mark} is [strong]{.mark} enough
[to give]{.mark} the system [adaptability and
dynamism]{.mark}.]{.underline} **And the** [state is strong enough to
[ensure]{.mark} that [sufficient resources]{.mark} are [mobilised
towards]{.mark} [achieving]{.mark} its [security
objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For as long as this equilibrium
remains intact,** [[Russia]{.mark} will be able to [generate]{.mark} the
necessary [economic resources to sustain]{.mark} enough [military power
to wage war]{.mark} in Ukraine [and]{.mark}]{.underline}**, over the
longer term**[, to [rearm for]{.mark} a prolonged [confrontation with
the West]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Any hopes that its economic
vulnerabilities will bring it to the negotiating table are therefore
unlikely to be realised.**

#### Putin's rapid militarization of the Russian economy demonstrates his mindset of how critical Russian economy dominance is to providing weapons for war

shows economy is firmly on war footing," The Washington Post, 5-13-24,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/05/13/andrei-beluosov-defense-minister-russia/)-MZ

Vladimir [[Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} surprise [[selection of]{.mark}
Andrei [Belousov]{.mark}]{.underline}, an economist, as defense minister
is the [clearest [sign]{.mark}]{.underline} yet that [[Russia]{.mark}
has [shifted]{.mark} its [economy onto]{.mark} a [war
footing]{.mark}]{.underline} and that the fate of Russian forces in
Ukraine depends heavily on winning an arms manufacturing race with the
West. "[Belousov's appointment]{.underline} is, in part, a [[recognition
o]{.mark}f]{.underline} how central the war has become to the economy,
and [[how central]{.mark} the [economy is to]{.mark} the
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Sam Greene, a professor of Russian
politics at King's College London. "But it's also more than that,"
Greene said. "It's an attempt to reshape what has become one of the key
dividing lines within Putin's power elite." He was referring to
rivalries within the Russian government between economy-oriented
ministers and officials focused on security and defense, who often
battle for influence and budget resources. Belousov, 65, a former
economic development minister who began his career in academia and has
no background in military or law enforcement, was nominated by Putin on
Sunday to replace Sergei Shoigu, Russia's defense minister since 2012,
in a dramatic reshuffle of Kremlin security chiefs. The shake-up, which
followed Putin's inauguration last week for a fifth term as president,
also comes just a few weeks after Shoigu's close ally and deputy defense
minister, Timur Ivanov, was arrested and accused of taking \$11 million
in bribes, a whopping sum even in Russia, where official corruption is
rampant. In that context Belousov's nomination signaled a [desire by
[Putin]{.mark} to]{.underline} impose tight control over the country's
soaring military budget, and to [[ensure]{.mark} that the huge
[expenditures result in]{.mark} much-needed [weapons, ammunition
and]{.mark} other [material reaching]{.mark} the [front lines in
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} --- by curbing graft that had long been
tolerated in the ministry's top brass. Experts said the appointment also
[indicated the [importance of ramping up wartime defense]{.mark}
manufacturing]{.underline} --- and overcoming Western sanctions and
export controls that have limited the country's access to important
parts and supplies, especially high-tech components. "The problem is
that any military activity is accompanied by a technological race ---
the West has better potential for such a race than Russia, which has
lost a lot of it," said Igor Lipsits, an economist who worked with
Belousov years ago. "So Belousov will have to try and reinstate the
military-scientific complex of Russia." Throughout his career, Belousov
has kept a low profile. Analysts and people who know him described him
as a competent technocrat with little to no political ambition. "He has
always been very calm and very professional," said Konstantin Sonin, a
Russian economist who is a professor at the University of Chicago and
has met Belousov multiple times. "And among those people who were
squarely for industrial policy, state involvement, and state-led growth,
he was by far the most competent one." Sonin, however, said he did not
believe that Belousov's economic views were a factor in his elevation to
defense chief. "I don't think his views determined anything --- it's
[[Putin's]{.underline}]{.mark} view," Sonin said. "And he is [a loyal
soldier in this [march toward]{.mark} nationalization and
[militarization of the Russian economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. He's a
person whom Putin trusts, and he has no charisma, political following,
or political base. And these are the people whom Putin consistently uses
for positions of authority." On Monday, as part of a reshuffle of
high-level officials at the start of Putin's fifth term, the Russian
parliament approved the appointment of Dmitry Patrushev as a vice prime
minister. Patrushev, who had been agriculture minister is the son of
longtime Putin ally Nikolai Patrushev who was ousted as head of the
National Security Council on Sunday to make way for Shoigu. The Kremlin
has said Nikolai Patrushev will get a "new job" to be announced in
coming days. The elevation of his son is widely viewed as a reward for
years of loyalty to Putin. In 2018, Belousov rattled Russia's top
earners by proposing that Putin create a mechanism allowing the
government to reap extra funds from state enterprises that earned high
profits. In a working memo to the president that was leaked to the
financial outlets by some of the affected billionaires, Belousov
proposed redirecting about \$7.6 billion in "excess income" from 14
metallurgical, chemical and petrochemical companies that performed well
as a result of changes in "external market conditions" --- including a
weaker ruble and high global demand for their goods. The effort met with
fierce resistance from the business community and largely fizzled. The
day after Belousov's letter came to light, shares of state-controlled
industrial companies plummeted on the Moscow stock exchange, shrinking
the fortunes of Russian business executives by more than \$3 billion in
a single day, Bloomberg News calculated at the time. The Russian Union
of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, effectively a lobbying group for
Russian oligarchs, argued that several companies would have defaulted if
Belousov's plan had been implemented. Tense negotiations between finance
officials and businesses dragged on for a year until Putin intervened.
Enterprises agreed on a concession: simply allocating money for large
scale infrastructure projects outlined in Putin's May Decrees, a set of
orders charting Russia's economic course. Belousov, nevertheless,
cemented his reputation as a true "statesman" who prioritizes government
needs over private hands and who champions strong state control over the
economy and building growth through state investment. His ideas proved
useful after Russia suffered stunning defeats in the first year of its
invasion of Ukraine and was faced with the reality of a protracted war,
which required more creative ways to reshape the economy and fuel the
war machine. Although the idea was "perverted" and did not take into
account whether the companies had extra profit, Lipsits said: "The
principle was simple --- if you are big, you must share." In 2023, Putin
signed into law a one-time windfall tax, forcing large companies whose
average pretax profit for 2021-2022 exceeded 1 billion rubles (about
\$11 million) to pay a share to the government. "[Putin's [priority is
war]{.mark};]{.underline} war of attrition is [[won by
economics]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Alexandra Prokopenko, former Bank
of Russia adviser, now a research fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia
Center. "Belousov is in favor of stimulating demand from the budget,
which means that military spending will at least not decrease but rather
increase," Prokopenko wrote on X. Ideologically, Belousov aligns with
the vision of a conservative, traditionalist and self-reliant Russia
that Putin has said he is intent on building. Russian media reported
that Belousov shares [Putin's belief that their country is surrounded by
enemies]{.underline} and that Belousov has proposed concepts for
Russia's technological advancement that envision it developing its own
chips, high-precision machines, planes, drones, medical equipment and
software to end reliance on Western imports. Belousov is also very
religious --- in recent years he served as an altar boy in a church in
the Vladimir region, according to photos published by Russian media ---
which experts said would help him find common ground with some other
members of Putin's military brass. During a parliament session Monday
that effectively served as a confirmation hearing, Belousov gave a short
speech vowing to help soldiers who have faced problems gaining access to
benefits and medical care. Many families have accused Shoigu of
neglecting mobilized soldiers and mercenaries by setting up convoluted
mechanisms for confirming veteran status, a requirement to receive free
medical care. "I think it is absolutely out of order when the
participants of the special military operation, who come on holiday, are
... sent to hospitals, which are often overcrowded," Belousov said in
televised remarks. "This also applies to excessive bureaucracy and
paperwork related to the confirmation of benefits." The appointment of a
civilian to head the defense ministry amid a protracted war might seem
surprising. In fact, Putin has never looked to career military officers
to fill that post. Shoigu, a loyal Putin ally, also had no background in
the military. Shoigu never served in the army. Rather, he studied civil
engineering, and came to the defense job with managerial experience and
a level of popularity he scored leading the Ministry of Emergency
Situations from 1991 to 2012. Before Shoigu, economist and former tax
service chief, Anatoly Serdyukov, was brought in by Putin in 2007 to
shepherd an unpopular but Kremlin-backed military reform. After five
years, he was fired, accused of embezzlement and fraud. He was jailed
briefly but released under a general amnesty order. Since the start of
the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Shoigu has faced blistering
criticism over repeated military blunders and been tainted by the
corruption investigation of his deputy. Belousov, by contrast, has not
been the center of corruption scandals and has a clean reputation,
something analysts said may have also motivated Putin's choice, given
the defense ministry's notoriety for misappropriating funds on all
levels. "Compared to figures like Shoigu and his detained deputy Ivanov,
Belousov appears ascetic," Prokopenko said. "The Kremlin's gamble might
hinge on his curtailing corruption." The Kremlin made sure to calibrate
Shoigu's removal by quickly announcing his appointment as the head of
Russia's security and defense council, a consultative body, where other
officials who once enjoyed elevated status in Putin's inner circle have
been reassigned. Shoigu will also hold an influential post at a
government body that oversees procurement of weapons from abroad. "This
doesn't appear to be designed as a demotion for Shoigu, who not only
received an important position as Secretary of the Security Council but
also will retain oversight of domestic and foreign defense issues,
taking that from the new Minister of Defense," said Rob Lee, a military
analyst with the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

#### Russia is allowing China to stake a claim in the Arctic Region

Historically, the Arctic represented a model of cooperation among the
eight circumpolar nations. However, on March 3, 2022, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the United States issued a joint
statement announcing the suspension of their cooperation with Russia
within the Arctic Council, leaving [[Moscow]{.mark} in [need]{.mark} of
[new partners]{.mark} to develop the region.]{.underline} Since the
onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022,
[[Russia]{.mark} has been [making unprecedented concessions to
China]{.mark} when it comes to [Arctic affairs]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
March 2023, [the two countries agreed to [establish a joint working
group]{.mark} to [advance]{.mark} the [Northern Sea Route]{.mark}
project.]{.underline} The following month, [they signed a Memorandum of

law]{.mark}]{.underline}. In May, within the "Arctic Thinking -- Global
Thinking" project framework, [BRICS country representatives convened to
formulate a unified Arctic agenda.]{.underline} [[China's covert
support]{.mark} for Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project]{.underline} The
Arctic is poised to become a vital energy hub for [Russia]{.underline}.
The [Arctic LNG 2 project]{.underline}, the second major onshore gas
initiative on the Gydan Peninsula, is being [[developed]{.mark} with
[international collaboration]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russian media predict
that by 2050, these [operations could contribute to 9 percent of global
production of liquified natural gas]{.underline} (LNG). To attract
foreign investors, the [Russian government]{.underline} has
[introduced]{.underline} substantial [tax breaks and
subsidies]{.underline}. However, the landscape shifted dramatically
after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Major global oil
companies, including BP, Statoil and ExxonMobil, pulled out of or paused
their collaboration with Russia. Consequently, the Arctic LNG 2 project
has been unable to proceed as originally planned. France's Total, a key
foreign investor in these Arctic ventures, also declared it would cease
funding new projects. In November 2023, the U.S. imposed sanctions on
the Arctic LNG 2 project, into which over \$20 billion had already been
invested. In response to escalating Western measures, Russia offered a
40 percent discount on the sale of LNG. However, a year later, Russia
has still not found a buyer for Arctic LNG 2. [[China's]{.mark}
involvement]{.underline} in this project mirrors [President Xi Jinping's
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}: on one hand [[supporting
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and aiming to [prevent the downfall of the
Arctic LNG 2 project]{.underline}, while simultaneously not wanting to
jeopardize its access to Western markets. Under pressure from the U.S.
and Europe, China's Wison New Energies officially withdrew from the
Arctic LNG 2 on June 21. However, in August, a small fleet of [[Chinese
cargo ships]{.mark} covertly headed to the Arctic to [support]{.mark}
the project.]{.underline} These ships were laden with [substantial power
generation equipment]{.underline} for the Arctic LNG 2 project, provided
by Wison New Energies. During its journey within Chinese waters, one
ship changed its name twice to avoid detection. Its automatic
identification system listed Norway as its destination, masking its true
route to Russia. This discreet operation successfully delivered Modules
1-3 to the project site in Russia. When these activities were exposed,
Wison denied direct involvement and suggested that a third party was
responsible. China did not have sufficient time to deliver the final two
power modules to the Russian Arctic within the year. With the Arctic
summer shipping season over, Modules 4-5 now remain at the Zhoushan
shipyard. Another covert operation will likely take place next year.
Despite Washington explicitly threatening sanctions against involvement
in the Arctic LNG 2 project, on June 7 of this year PetroChina Chairman
Wang Yilin and Novatek Chairman Leonid Mikhelson signed a share purchase
agreement in St. Petersburg. This agreement stipulated that PetroChina
would acquire a 10 percent stake in Arctic LNG 2. This move was not
merely a decision by PetroChina but the fulfillment of an [agreement
made between President Xi and President Vladimir]{.underline} Putin
during the former's visit to Moscow in March. Simultaneously, Beijing
continues to engage with the U.S. and Europe. For instance, on April 16,
China and Iceland signed a trade rights agreement, during which leaders
of both nations reaffirmed their cooperation on Arctic affairs.
Scenarios Likely: China becomes a forefront player in Arctic development
[[China's]{.mark} current [Arctic operations]{.mark}]{.underline} focus
on two main methods: Eurasian transit of bulk cargo transport through
the Northeast Passage and [[direct shipments to]{.mark} ports along
[Russia's Northern Sea Route]{.mark}]{.underline}. When new routes
become navigable, [Beijing will be perfectly positioned to expand its
activities]{.underline}. China will even launch tourist cruises to the
Arctic on a large scale in 2025. This summer, China completed three
Arctic research missions and began building several heavy icebreakers
for its coast guard fleet. Furthermore, it plans to launch a manned
submersible to the Arctic seabed from the polar research vessel
Exploration III. Previously dependent on foreign technology, China will
now be able to rely on its own capabilities. Likely: [Arctic cooperation
between Russia and China intensifies]{.underline} All of [[China's
activities]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} are [[only possible thanks
to Moscow]{.mark}'s facilitation]{.underline}. A [commercially viable
[shipping route along Russia's Arctic coast]{.mark}]{.underline} could
soon become a reality, which would be [economically [beneficial
for]{.mark} both [Moscow and Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}. A [[joint
venture between Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} Rosatom and
[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} Hainan Yangpu Xinxin [[Shipping
Company]{.underline}]{.mark} is set to [construct the necessary
infrastructure and polar-class container ships to operate these Arctic
routes year-round.]{.underline} This [development]{.underline} will
likely [increase [Russian economic dependence on
China]{.mark},]{.underline} but President Putin has few options
available to break out of international isolation and secure external
support while he continues to wage war against Ukraine.
[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} seeks to [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [Northern Sea Route]{.underline} remains [[free of Western
interference through]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[cooperation with
Russia]{.underline}.]{.mark} For example, the Chinese Coast Guard
recently participated in its first Arctic patrol with Russia. It is
conceivable that Russia will grant China more influence in Arctic
development moving forward. At the moment, the Arctic capabilities of
the democratic circumpolar states appear to be less robust than those of
China and Russia. The U.S. has only two icebreakers, and Canada does not
seem urgently focused on defending the Arctic's northern reaches.

#### Russia and China are increasing cooperation in the Arctic in the status quo. US must take action

Climate change has opened up previously frozen parts of the Arctic for
navigation, and potentially for the development of natural resources. A
strong case can be made for international cooperation in what remains a
very challenging region of the world. [At the same time, as a result of
[global geopolitical changes]{.mark}, the Arctic is becoming another
theater for fierce competition between various countries]{.underline}.
[The [continued rise of China]{.mark} to the position of a global
superpower is inevitably leading to its participation in this
competition alongside the Arctic littoral states.]{.underline}
Cooperation between international players in the High North is taking
place amid an [atmosphere of renewed U.S.-Russian
confrontation]{.underline}, as well as [[increasing rivalry]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} the [United States and China]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
U.S. government views Russia's activity in the Arctic and China's
newfound presence in the region as a threat to the West]{.underline}.1
Russia, in turn, has expressed concern about the growing U.S. and NATO
military activity in Europe's North and the adjacent seas. There is a
sense of new Sino-American bipolarity in the air. The perception of
Russia as China's junior partner and potentially its tributary state is
quite popular in the West. According to this view, China is expanding
westward, gradually subordinating Russia by increasingly exploiting its
resources and capabilities to Beijing's advantage. One of the avenues
for this Chinese expansion, as per proponents of this position, is
China's creeping conquest of the Arctic: gaining access to the region's
natural resources, creating transportation and communication
infrastructure there, and developing and taking control of the Northern
Sea Route---also known as the Northeast Passage---along the Siberian
coast, linking East Asia to Europe. How accurate is this perception? How
do Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic compare and overlap? What
can be learned from a comparative analysis of the Arctic strategies of
both countries and their practical steps in this area? And, finally, how
does or could Russian-Chinese cooperation in the Arctic impact European
and Eurasian security? To answer these questions, we will examine the
following subjects with respect to the Arctic region: Russian and
Chinese interests; Moscow and Beijing's strategies and practical
policies; Prospects for cooperation between the two states. We will also
present our conclusions on the impact of Russian-Chinese relations on
European and, more broadly, Eurasian security. Russia, China, and the
Arctic From a geopolitical perspective, Russia is a northern country
whose territory occupies almost the entire north of the Eurasian
continent except for Scandinavia. [Russia also boasts the longest Arctic
coastline]{.underline}. The medieval republic of Novgorod established an
outpost on the Arctic and Kola Peninsula (Murman) coasts as early as the
twelfth century. Russians reached the Spitsbergen (now Svalbard)
archipelago---which they called "Grumant"---in the fifteenth century,
and the Bering Strait in the middle of the seventeenth century. For a
long time, Russia's main trade route to Western Europe was through the
Arctic port of Arkhangelsk, since the Czardom of Muscovy lacked free
access to the Baltic and the Black Sea. [Russian polar surveys and
expeditions have been conducted since the eighteenth
century.]{.underline} [Development of the Arctic was particularly active
during the Soviet era.]{.underline} The Soviet Union didn't just join
the 1920 Spitsbergen Treaty; it also secured a permanent presence there
by establishing a coal concession on the archipelago. In 1926, the
Soviet government staked a claim to an enormous chunk of the Arctic: 6.8
million square kilometers of sea, declaring it the polar territory of
the USSR. As a result, the territory of the Soviet Union grew from the
furthermost continental points on the Kola and Chukotka peninsulas all
the way to the North Pole. The first ship sailed along the Northern Sea
Route in 1932. It was in that period that the largest cities beyond the
Northern Polar Circle, Murmansk and Norilsk, were built. During World
War II, the polar region became one of the theaters of war: having
successfully defended the Kola Peninsula, the Red Army liberated
northern Norway from Wehrmacht forces. During the Cold War, the Northern
Fleet headquartered in Severomorsk became the most powerful of the four
fleets of the Soviet Navy. The area was the base for Soviet ballistic
missile submarines: the core of the second-strike nuclear force, a key
deterrence factor. It was from there that the Soviet Navy, with its
mighty submarine fleet, was preparing to sail into the Atlantic in the
event of a war with NATO. The Arctic airspace also provided the shortest
trajectories for U.S. and Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles
aimed at potential enemy targets. In 1987, toward the end of the Cold
War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev delivered a speech in Murmansk on
the prospects of international cooperation in the Arctic.2 He stressed
the need for peaceful relations: joint scientific research, working on
the problems of the indigenous people of the North, ensuring radiation
security, and opening up the Northern Sea Route to international
navigation, with the Soviet Union providing the services of icebreakers.
The vector set by Gorbachev remained central to Russian policy in the
region for a quarter of a century. In the mid-2000s, the prospects of
developing Arctic hydrocarbon resources and the Northern Sea Route
became the top priority, while in the mid-2010s, those issues were
partially eclipsed by Moscow's new confrontation with Washington and a
sharp decline in relations with its NATO allies. [China]{.underline} is
thousands of miles away from the Arctic, so [its interests in the region
differ widely]{.underline} from those of Russia. They primarily stem
from [China's position as one of the two leading global powers of the
twenty-first century,]{.underline} and, on a more formal level, as a
permanent member of the UN Security Council, which entails global
responsibility. China has been part of the Spitsbergen Treaty since
1925, but only in the late 1990s did China start organizing Arctic
expeditions, and its geopolitical activity in this sphere dates back to
the mid-2000s. After that, the process accelerated as a result of
China's rapid ascension to the level of a leading global power. In 2013,
Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward the Belt and Road initiative,
which was originally focused on its neighboring countries in Eurasia.
One of the projects associated with the [initiative is the Ice Silk Road
to Europe]{.underline}, which [China aims to establish via the Arctic
waters]{.underline}. Russian and Chinese Interests The Russian
leadership views the "Arctic zone of the Russian Federation" (the
official description of an area covering 9 million square kilometers
that makes up 40 percent of the entire Arctic space) as a strategic
resource base. The area's population is only 2.5 million, but it
generates 12--15 percent of the country's GDP: 80 percent of Russian
gas, as well as nickel, diamonds, and rare earth metals are extracted
there. The Arctic provides a quarter of the country's exports and a
third of its fish caught. It contains enormous expanses and new
frontiers: Russia's new international façade and its new maritime
border. Apart from significant economic interests (resources and
transportation, among others), Russia has essential security interests
in the region. Nuclear deterrence remains the main guarantee of the
country's security, and the Northern Fleet retains its significance as
one of the main instruments in the country's nuclear deterrence
strategy. The Arctic is also home to the indigenous peoples of the
Russian North[. Soviet military and economic activity previously led to
the contamination of the Arctic territories,]{.underline} so in recent
years Russia has become sensitive to the fragility of Arctic ecological
systems. Beijing's official narrative presents [China's Arctic interests
as mostly related to environmental issues,]{.underline} [scientific
research, navigation, and the surveying and development of natural
resources]{.underline}. Indeed, thanks to air flows and other natural
phenomena, Arctic climate change also affects the climate of various
Chinese regions. However, it's evident that it is China's global
ambitions that are driving its attempts to be present in every corner of
the globe and every part of the World Ocean, including the Arctic. Under
the slogan of building a common future for all humanity, [China is
conceiving a new world order, where, as one of the strongest global
powers, it will be one of the key norm-setters and guarantors of
order.]{.underline} The Russian authorities are both aware and somewhat
wary of this objective. Moscow defends the hierarchy of states' national
interests in the Arctic. Top of the table are the five Arctic Ocean
coastal states: Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States.
Russia claims that the interests of this group, including its own, take
precedence. All five countries have direct access to the Arctic Ocean,
and have exclusive economic zones there where they develop natural
resources, and must protect their indigenous populations. Next come the
three other permanent members of the Arctic Council: Finland, Iceland,
and Sweden. For those three, economic issues are the primary
consideration. Only then do other countries' interests come into play.
Those include the observer countries in the Arctic Council, including
France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom in Europe, as well as
China, India, Japan, and South Korea in Asia. For this last group,
prestige, politics, and navigation play a significant role. As can be
seen, Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic are very different in
both scope and nature. China has much greater economic, financial, and
technological resources than Russia, and the gap is growing. China's
economic dynamics also look stronger. While [China is charging ahead,
Russia is merely trying to protect its positions: its sovereignty,
territorial integrity, national control over navigation, and the
precedence of international law]{.underline} (i.e., interstate
bargaining) over any kind of a universal rules-based order. Russia is,
in a word, a status quo power, while China is seeking to open up the
region for the world and capitalize on that. The two countries' legal
positions reflect that. Legal Arguments In 1982, the Soviet Union signed
the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). By doing so, Moscow
was forced to abandon its idea of Soviet polar territories extending all
the way to the North Pole. After the breakup of the Soviet Union, the
Russian Federation actively participated in multilateral diplomacy.
Russia became one of the founders of the Barents Euro-Arctic Council in
1993 and the Arctic Council in 1996. By keeping the discussion of
Arctic-related issues to those bodies, Moscow seeks to defend its
exclusive rights as an Arctic state. Russia firmly believes that the
Arctic Five must resolve all essential questions directly among
themselves. So from Moscow's perspective, the Arctic Council serves as a
sort of regional equivalent of the UN Security Council. These are not
just pious wishes. In 2010, Russia and Norway managed to resolve their
long-running dispute over their Barents Sea maritime borders, and
divided up the 175,000 square kilometer (67,567 square mile) area of
water between them. Currently, Russia is looking to expand its exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) in the Arctic. If the UN Commission accepts its
assertion that the underwater Lomonosov and Mendeleyev ridges are the
extension of the continental Siberian Shelf, the Russian EEZ in the
Arctic will gain 1.2 million square kilometers. China officially
considers itself a "near-Arctic state." Beijing also bases its position
on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, but claims that the Arctic
belongs to all mankind. This position aligns with the general Chinese
view that global commons should be open to all humanity. Whereas Moscow
supports the exclusive rights of Arctic states, Beijing demonstrates
broad inclusivity. It might seem to the outside observer that by
defending a liberal multilateral approach, China is defending the
interests of humanity from the selfish small group of Arctic states that
includes Russia. For a mighty power with limited resources, however,
this position serves the Chinese national interest. Russia has no allies
in the Arctic Council: all the other countries are founding members of
the U.S.-led NATO. Nevertheless, Canada's approach to the Northwest
Passage is almost identical to the Russian position on the Northern Sea
Route. Ottawa considers the straits between the islands in the north of
Canada to be the country's historical waters. Other states are also
trying to defend their rights on the Svalbard archipelago, where Russia
recently protested the restrictions introduced by Norwegian
authorities.3 China's position on the status of the Arctic and freedom
of navigation there to a large extent echoes that of the United States
and other major maritime powers: the United Kingdom, India, and Japan.
However, it should be remembered that the United States is not a
signatory of UNCLOS, and---it is very important to note---Washington
fears that China could enter the Arctic and establish a firm presence
there. Strategies Throughout almost the entire twentieth century, Russia
was a leader in Arctic exploration. After the collapse of the Soviet
Union, it lost many of its positions. Only at the very start of the
2010s did Moscow rekindle its interest in the Arctic. Russia's main goal
now is to reclaim the mantle of the leading Arctic power. In 2008, the
country's government adopted a document titled "The Foundations of
Russia's Strategy in the Arctic,4 and in 2013, the "Strategy for the
Development of the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation Through 2020"
was approved.5 Developing the Arctic zone is a personal priority for
President Vladimir Putin. Russia's Security Council oversees the
strategy, while the Ministry for the Development of the Russian Far East
is in charge of implementing the megaproject. [[Russia's]{.mark} Arctic
strategy [views]{.mark} the [region as]{.mark} a [strategic resource
base]{.mark} for the country, and seeks to bolster it.]{.underline}
While aiming to maintain peace and develop cooperation with its Arctic
neighbors, the Russian strategy provides for the expansion of its
military presence and installation of a border control system in the
region. Moscow believes that any international system of governance in
the Arctic should recognize Russia's role and significance. This
concerns not only the protection of the region's unique ecological
system, but also the use of resources and regulation of navigation. As
far as Moscow is concerned, the Northern Sea Route should remain under
Russian jurisdiction, and Russian icebreakers should be used there, as
Gorbachev proposed years ago. Russia's Arctic strategy aligns closely
with the broader concept of Greater Eurasia, which in the mid-2010s
replaced the concept of a Greater Europe.6 According to this new
concept, Russia is a self-sufficient geopolitical unit in the north of
the Eurasian mega-continent. The continent's other countries---from the
European Union west of Moscow to China to its east, India to the south,
and the Muslim world to the southeast---are all Russia's neighbors.
[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}, which created and leads the Eurasian
Economic Union (EaEU) that includes several former Soviet republics,
[reached an [agreement with China]{.mark} in 2015 on synergizing the
EaEU and the Belt and Road initiative.]{.underline} It also offers other
groupings, from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to
the "integration of integrations" with the EU, and the so-called Greater
Eurasian partnership.7 China's Arctic strategy was adopted for the first
time in 2018.8 It's a comprehensive and detailed document, but unlike
its Russian counterpart, it's more declarative. China intends to conduct
scientific research in the Arctic, protect the environment and habitat
of indigenous peoples, contribute to the development of the region, and
participate in its management. [[China]{.mark} also [expresses]{.mark}
its [respect]{.mark} for other countries, [declares]{.mark} its
[willingness to cooperate]{.mark},]{.underline} and proclaims the
mutually beneficial nature of relations and its commitment to
sustainable development. The security section of the document talks of
strengthening peace and stability, ensuring the security of maritime
trade, and supporting the right of all states to use the Arctic. In
keeping with its basic position, the Chinese strategy offers an
inclusive system of managing the Arctic. Naturally, considering China's
significance, such a system presupposes that the country will play a
leading role in it. This is where the main conflict between the Russian
and Chinese strategies lies. In the words of a Russian analyst, the
Chinese strategy is "an attempt to lead the process of strengthening the
role of out-of-the-region players in the Arctic, a successfully
camouflaged wish to play one of the leading roles among them in
formulating the Arctic agenda."9 The Chinese Arctic strategy follows
China's Ice Silk Road concept,10 which, in turn, is part of the Belt and
Road initiative. This conceptual architecture is crowned by the idea of
a common future for humanity. Moscow hasn't put forward anything of that
kind since Soviet times. Chinese globalism, sustained by the colossal
economic potential and dynamic development of the most populous nation
on earth, is in stark contrast to Russia's current agenda, which seeks
to retain and defend its great power status in competition with stronger
players. Aspiring to become a leading maritime power, China is also
implementing a grand shipbuilding program. As a future lord of the seas,
China, like the United States, is interested in supporting the freedom
of navigation principle, including sailing through the Arctic, which
provides a route to Europe that is one-third shorter than traveling via
the Suez Canal. In this context, Beijing insists that navigation along
the Northern Sea Route shouldn't be regulated by national (i.e.,
Russian) laws. It's not only the principle per se that is important to
China. Beijing takes into consideration that maritime routes that
connect China with Europe and the Middle East pass through the narrow
Malacca and Hormuz straits, whose control has been disputed by regional
powers. It's difficult for Beijing to be fully consistent on this issue,
however, considering the country's own interests in the South China Sea
and the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese strategy also insists on the right of
naval ships to "innocent passage" through the exclusive economic zones
of the Arctic states. For now and in the foreseeable future, China has
no military presence at all in the Arctic. But in the more distant
future, [Chinese interests in the Arctic Ocean---developing energy
resources and other minerals, including rare and rare earth
metals---might require naval protection.]{.underline} Until those issues
become relevant, Beijing is forced to reluctantly observe the Russian
military buildup in the Arctic. For its part, Russia is predictably
unhappy with Chinese aspirations to manage the Arctic. Moscow firmly
intends to preserve the special privileges bestowed on the five Arctic
Ocean coastal states. The Kremlin doesn't trust the statements on
environmental protection and caring for indigenous peoples included in
China's Arctic strategy. Those statements seem to be at odds with the
continuing large-scale environmental pollution on mainland China and
Beijing's tough stance toward ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang-Uyghur
Autonomous Region and Tibet. [In 2013,]{.underline} [[Moscow and Beijing
launched]{.mark} their [Arctic dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}. China had,
however, begun a similar dialogue with the United States even earlier.
It's obvious that some key provisions of the Chinese and Russian Arctic
strategies contradict one another. Nevertheless, Moscow and Beijing
don't accentuate their differences and avoid conflicts on practical
policy issues. This conforms to the general pattern: [[China and
Russia]{.mark} pragmatically engage in [increasingly close
cooperation]{.mark} on issues of common interest, while agreeing to
amicably disagree where their positions do not align.]{.underline}
Practical Policies In implementing its Arctic strategy, Russia isn't
only concerned with strengthening the positions weakened during the
post-Soviet era; it is also working on the new opportunities emerging as
the Arctic frees itself of ice. The changing business climate---above
all the volatility of oil prices---and the geopolitical situation are
prompting Russia to commit less effort to hard-to-extract energy
resources. Mega-projects like the development of the Shtokman field in
the Barents Sea have been frozen. At the same time, greater attention is
being paid to developing the Northern Sea Route. In the atmosphere of
the new confrontation with the United States, there is even greater
focus on military security. Russian garrisons have returned to the
Novaya Zemlya archipelago; other military bases abandoned after the
Soviet Union's breakup have been reactivated and modernized; and new
airfields are being built. The confrontation between Russia and the
United States triggered by the Ukraine crisis, along with Moscow's
deteriorating relations with the European Union states, have drastically
reduced the possibilities for cooperation with Western companies on
Arctic exploration. This situation is likely to persist for a long time.
Under the current conditions, Moscow is forced to look for other
partners capable of bringing cutting-edge technologies to its projects,
and those partners mostly come from Asia. The Japanese companies Japan
Oil, Gas, and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) and Mitsui have come
on board the Arctic LNG project being implemented by Novatek, a private
Russian gas company.11 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated in
2020 that India may become the first non-Arctic state to begin
extracting resources in the Arctic.12 In Asia, India is a natural
counterweight for Russia vis-à-vis China. Meanwhile, [[China]{.mark} has
[become Russia's main economic and technological
partner]{.mark}.]{.underline} After its break with the West,
[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} was forced to [[relax]{.mark} its pre-2014
[restrictions on]{.mark} attracting [Chinese
partners]{.mark}]{.underline} to Russian energy projects. When
[[woo]{.mark}ing [Chinese companies]{.mark}]{.underline}, which are
clearly [[backed by]{.mark} official [Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline},
Russia tries to protect its own interests. China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC) and the Silk Road Fund have become co-investors in
the Yamal LNG project, investing 20 percent and 9.9 percent of the
capital, respectively. [[Russia]{.underline}'s]{.mark} state-owned
companies Rosneft and Gazprom have [agreed to [cooperate with Chinese
partners]{.mark} in the [Arctic]{.mark} seas.]{.underline} [Chinese
companies]{.underline} have also been [contracted to modernize the
Arkhangelsk seaport and construct the White Sea--Komi--Ural (Belkomur)
rail link.]{.underline} In addition, the development of the [Northern
Sea Route would create the conditions for the further development of
ports in northeastern Chinа and in the cities of Dalian and Qingdao in
the Shandong province]{.underline}. Beijing's tactics consist of
gradually advancing its interests, avoiding conflicts, accumulating
resources, and awaiting favorable conditions for further advance. China
obtained observer status in the Arctic Council back in 2013, having
agreed to the legal rights of Arctic states while clearly seeking to
bring international governance to the region[. For Beijing,
[Russia]{.mark} [is]{.mark} an [important]{.mark} partner,]{.underline}
but not the only one in the Arctic. The Chinese have actively invested
in Greenland and Iceland, perhaps viewing the autonomous Danish
territory and the small island state as welcoming footholds for
anchoring themselves in the region. Another place where China might gain
some ground is the Svalbard archipelago, where, it should be remembered,
Beijing has certain rights under the 1920 treaty, which recognized
Norwegian sovereignty over the archipelago but gave signatories the
right to engage in commercial activity there. [Beijing demonstrates calm
and patience when dealing with Russia in the Arctic]{.underline}, and
toward Russia in general. [[Chinese]{.mark} officials mostly
[treat]{.mark} their [Russian]{.mark} counterparts [in]{.mark} a
[friendly and businesslike]{.mark} manner]{.underline}.13 However, China
is certainly taking advantage of Russia's geopolitical isolation,
relative technological lag, and near-inability to obtain advanced
technology from its traditional Western sources. [As long as cooperation
between Moscow and Beijing in the Arctic is in the interest of both
countries]{.underline} and, importantly, doesn't make Russia excessively
dependent on China, it will continue and develop. Prospects and
Conclusions The lack of alternatives to cooperation among the Arctic
states, which was a common theme in the 1990s and 2000s, is now a thing
of the past. Relations between Russia and the four Western Arctic states
will remain tense in the foreseeable future. However, the Arctic hasn't
yet become the setting for a new Great Game. While the disagreements
between states are evident, cooperation has not stopped completely, and
the preference for diplomatic rather than military conflict resolution
still prevails. Relations between Russia and the West in the Arctic are
still somewhere between cooperation and confrontation for now, but are
moving in the direction of greater competition. Despite the fact that
U.S.--Russian and U.S.--Chinese relations are clearly or increasingly
hostile, while [[relations between Russia and China]{.mark} are becoming
[increasingly close]{.mark}]{.underline}, the world is not yet
witnessing the formation of opposing blocs like those seen during the
Cold War. China and Russia act in accordance with their own interests,
which are not always identical. For the time being, the creation of a
Russo-Chinese military alliance isn't a viable idea. [Cooperation
between China and Russia in the Arctic]{.underline} is exclusively
economic (energy and infrastructure projects). There is no reason to
believe that this cooperation will acquire a military component in the
foreseeable future.

China was only scientifically interested in the Arctic. The military
aspect is something new. \"We don\'t understand why they are in the
Arctic. If you don\'t understand why a nation with a growing military

--- is here, that\'s worrisome.]{.underline} It is also not entirely
clear why they grow so quickly. So [that worries the alliance.\"
Conflicts in one region have global consequences]{.underline} NATO
admiral Rob Bauer You say you don\'t know why China has increased its
presence in the Arctic. What exactly are your concerns? \"[Conflicts in
one region have global consequences.]{.underline} That is why the
conflict in Ukraine draws attention in nations such as New Zealand,
Australia, Japan, South Korea. They understand that what is happening in
Ukraine with Russia can happen anywhere. The violation of a sovereign
state and internationally recognized borders can also happen in their
region, and they are very concerned about the capabilities and the
increasing aggressiveness of China, says Rob Bauer, leaning forward.

[[China]{.mark} has a [history of engaging]{.mark} with [Arctic]{.mark}
countries]{.underline}, bilaterally and through intergovernmental
forums, on economic development and science in the Arctic. For instance,
China has been Alaska's largest export market and has sought mining
stakes in Alaska, Canada, and Greenland.16 Chinese companies have
invested in Nordic logistics, energy, and telecommunications
enterprises. China has also built scientific research sites and engaged
in space observation activities in Iceland, Sweden, Finland, and the
archipelago of Svalbard.17 As an Arctic Council observer, China has
helped to [cultivate projects]{.underline} on Arctic science and other
topics.18 China was a voice in International Maritime Organization
negotiations concerning the International Code for Ships Operating in
Polar Waters (Polar Code) and has explicitly stated its intentions to
abide by this code in its Arctic policy.19 China is also a signatory to
the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated Fisheries in the Central Arctic
Ocean.20 The Iceland-based Arctic Circle Assembly conference continues
to be a strong platform for dialogue with China, among other
international Arctic stakeholders, on such topics as natural resource
development and governance issues. China's Arctic engagement also takes
place at the bilateral level. For example, during an official visit by
Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang to Norway in May 2023, both sides
discussed the value that their respective governments place on their
bilateral cooperation, including for Arctic issues.21 However,
[[China's]{.mark} [strongest Arctic partnership]{.mark} has arguably
been with [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline} has the
[largest Arctic presence]{.underline} because of the size of its
population living in the Russian Arctic, the length of its Arctic Ocean
coastline, the amount of economic activity that takes place at high
northern latitudes, and the extent of its efforts to [develop Arctic
specific military capabilities and infrastructure]{.underline}. [Russia
perceives]{.underline} its [Arctic]{.underline} as a [highly strategic
region]{.underline} for protecting its strategic military capabilities,
ensuring its territorial sovereignty (which had a fairly reliable
natural barrier in the now-melting sea ice), and for developing valuable
hydrocarbon and mineral resources that represent an essential source of
income for the country.22 Russia's Arctic presence also has sizable
populations and industries. The Russian Arctic is also perceived as a
launching pad to project power; the presence of the Northern Fleet in
Murmansk and a number of new and rehabilitated military installations
along the NSR indicate Russia's efforts to assert dominance in the
region.23 In particular, Russia has strategic nuclear assets in the
Arctic. Finally, Russia has used control over the Arctic as a
nationalist theme to galvanize domestic political support because---in
addition to the more tangible economic and military uses of the
Arctic---the vast Russian north holds special historical, cultural, and
symbolic significance for many Russians.24 As a result, Russia has
asserted its control over the NSR through its interpretation of Article
234 of the United Nations' Convention on the Law of the Sea---an
assertion that the United States rejects.25 Russia seeks recognition for
its extended continental shelf in the Arctic---a claim that overlaps
with those of Canada and Denmark through Greenland.26 Because of the
large size of the Russian Arctic, the vast resource extraction
opportunities, and the fact that the NSR is still, as of 2024, the most
navigable polar route, it is [[not surprising]{.mark} that
[China]{.mark} has sought to [engage Russia to gain]{.mark} more [access
to the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, [[Russia and China]{.mark}
have forged a [cooperative relationship]{.mark}]{.underline} that has
(at least to some measure) [[helped]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark} to further
[develop its northern economy]{.mark}]{.underline} and [afforded
[China]{.mark}]{.underline} tangible [[opportunities to
establish]{.mark} [itself as]{.mark}]{.underline} a recognized
[[stakeholder]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region. The most prominent
example is the [investment of Chinese companies]{.underline} in two
liquid natural gas (LNG) projects in the YamaloNenets Autonomous Okrug
in northern Siberia and the Power of Siberia 1 pipeline.27 Overall,
[[China]{.mark} has [invested billions]{.mark} of dollars [in energy and
mining projects in Russia's]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline},
although the bulk of its investment in Russia (and across the Arctic
writ large) is in Yamal LNG, which is a massive undertaking.28 In
addition, the [[Chinese transportation]{.underline}]{.mark} company
COSCO SHIPPING Lines Co., Ltd., has been [[exploring]{.mark} the use of
the [NSR]{.mark} running [along Russia]{.mark}'s Arctic
coastline]{.underline} as an [[option for future]{.mark} global
logistics]{.underline}.29 China's [[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}
with Russia is [[not limited]{.mark} to the [economic]{.mark}
domain]{.underline}. [[Chinese]{.underline} [and Russian destroyers
sailed]{.underline}]{.mark} [[together near Alaska]{.mark}'s Aleutian
Islands]{.underline} in 2022 and 2023, and again in 2024, farther north
in the Bering Sea.30 These Russian and Chinese vessels appeared to have
operated in accordance with international law and were south of the
Arctic Circle. Yet the fact that their joint operation
[[approached]{.mark} the Arctic in the [vicinity of
Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline} is remarkable. [[Historically]{.underline},
[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [has been [wary of]{.mark} the presence of
[non-Arctic countries]{.mark} in this region]{.underline}, especially
regarding military activity. Despite the declaration of a limitless
friendship with China, Russia has not provided Beijing with
opportunities to conduct overt military operations directly in and
around the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation (AZRF). Compared with
the growing frequency and scale of U.S. cooperation with Norway on
Arctic military training and exercises, sailing a few destroyers well
below the Arctic Circle pales in comparison. Similarly, China has not
written a blank check for Russia to develop its Siberian energy
reserves. To the contrary, Moscow has been unable to convince Beijing,
as of the time of this publication, to fund the larger capacity Power of
Siberia 2 pipeline, despite numerous meetings between these countries'
leadership. There are several potential reasons for this lack of
funding: One is that China is waiting for an even better deal on energy
resources; another is that Beijing could be wary of being overly
dependent on Russia for energy, after having observed Europe's
energy-related struggles in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
The following section will show that the Sino-Russian relationship in
the Arctic can evolve in several ways. Russia and other Arctic countries
control large swaths of the Arctic and China's access to it, so China
will ultimately choose the path of least resistance to strategic gains
in the region.

### Russian Expansionism

**Russian control of sea lanes k2 Russian power**

ALB\]

At a December public forum in St. Petersburg, Admiral Nikolay [Yevmenov,
head of the Russian navy, spoke of a "full-scale development beyond the
200-mile limit" of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone in the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}. What I am translating as "development" here is the
Russian word освоение, a word that bears multiple translations,
extending from development to mastery to expansion, often with an
economic angle. [Elsewhere, it is translated as "take-over" or
"expansion." The context in which he spoke it was in relation to the
Arctic as a "strategic resource base" of economic
development]{.underline}.

In his remarks, [Yevmenov closely ties that economic development to the
defense of sovereignty]{.underline} and territorial integrity in
relation [to that resource base]{.underline}, [displaying how
closely]{.underline} [national security, defense and economics are
intertwined in Russian]{.underline} economic [thinking about the
Arctic]{.underline}.

[His words were]{.underline} fully [in line with the]{.underline} body
of [strategic thinking that]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n
Federation under President Vladimir Putin [has established since
2020]{.underline}. [What we find in them does not sit comfortably with
the concept of an "A5" of Arctic Ocean littoral states working together
to settle jurisdictional questions diplomatically]{.underline}, a
concept captured in the 2008 Ilulisat Declaration signed by Canada, the
Kingdom of Denmark (for Greenland), Norway, Russia and the United
States.

A careful unpacking of Russia's evolving approach to international law
and relations in the Arctic is in order.

[First, we should take a step back to look at what is at
stake]{.underline}. [Demarcating the jurisdictional map of the far
northern continental shelf has so far been largely a matter of science,
in accordance with]{.underline} requirements the United Nation's
Convention on [the Law of the Sea]{.underline}. Briefly put, its
[Article 76 permits a country to extend past its 200-mile exclusive
economic zone to the margins of the continental shelf should it be
demonstrated its physical characteristics are continuous. That
demarcation comes with rights to exploit resources in that expanded
zone]{.underline}.

Canada, Denmark and Russia have all submitted the data underlying their
respective claims to the UN's Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf, which rules on the integrity of the science. (The
United States, not a signatory to the Law of the Sea, released its claim
in fall 2023.) [The commission ruled in 2023 that most of Russia's
submission was valid]{.underline}. [Canada's and Denmark's claims are
only likely to be pronounced upon later this decade or early
next]{.underline}. As of now, Canada, Denmark and Russia claim some of
the same places in the central Arctic Ocean, concentrated along the
Lomonosov Ridge.

[Once the commission has ruled, a situation may emerge where all three
have empirically justified claims to the same part of the
shelf]{.underline}. If so, the final jurisdictional boundaries are
agreed upon bilaterally. Canada-Denmark negotiations may not be easy,
but however cool-minded they are, they will also be more or less
amicable, and strictly at the negotiating table. A precedent for that is
the settling of boundary disputes on Hans/Tartupaluk Island and in the
Labrador Sea they concluded in 2022.

[So, what about Russia? There is good reason to think that Russia will
be less than an amicable negotiator and not leave it to the diplomats
alone]{.underline}.

Here it is important to look at what the Russian leadership is saying on
the matter. Useful resources are its main strategic documents, released
over the last four years. The 2023 Foreign Policy Concept, the 2023
amendments to the 2020 Arctic Strategy, the 2022 Maritime Doctrine and
the 2021 National Security Strategy reveal that [Russia]{.underline}
indeed [thinks]{.underline} that [it has a lot at stake]{.underline}.
Canada, Denmark and [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should take these seriously and prepare accordingly]{.underline}.

To start, [these documents make clear that the Arctic Ocean and its
continental shelves]{.underline} [are an integral part of Russia's
geopolitics and prosperity]{.underline}. [The Russian position is
committed to exercising an extended jurisdiction on the Arctic Ocean's
continental shelf]{.underline}. Significantly, [the National Security
Strategy identifies the military's defense of the continental shelf as a
priority, a "goal of state security]{.underline}," [which dovetails with
the document's emphasis on resource exploitation rights as a function of
national security and the general priority of the Arctic region in this
regard.]{.underline}

[The Maritime Doctrine lists the Arctic as the top priority of maritime
strategy and is outspoken on Russian interests beyond its exclusive
economic zone to the continental shelf and the delimitation of maritime
boundaries under international law]{.underline}. The Foreign Policy
Concept says that [Russia will "step up]{.underline}" (Russian:
активизации) [the delineating of these borders in a region it identifies
as the second most important]{.underline} after the countries of central
Asia and eastern Europe, and what it calls the "near abroad."

[These statements fit into a process of geopolitical transformation
Russia is trying to undertake to turn into a coastal Eurasian power,
defined as much by its northern maritime edge as its terrestrial land
mass]{.underline}. [While the Arctic has long been touted as central to
Russian identity]{.underline}, [global warming is opening sea lanes that
also conveniently enable Russia's pivot to Asia, accelerated by the
precarious relations with Europe]{.underline}.

[This vision of Arctic coastal Russia is closely tied to its prosperity
agenda]{.underline}. The region had already been an important part of
economic planning. [Now it is coming to be seen as the linchpin of
future economic development. The Maritime Doctrine describes the Arctic
Ocean as the only "vital" ocean to national interests, with its
socio-economic development a "decisive condition" for future
prosperity]{.underline}. [Seabed resources on the continental shelf, it
claims, are "predetermined" to be essential to alleviating depleted
terrestrial deposits]{.underline} (itself a questionable claim).

[Into this mix the strategies assess a sharply competitive, sometimes
violent international context, including in the Arctic]{.underline}.
[The strategic documents describe the other Arctic countries as
exhibiting varying degrees of hostility to Russia]{.underline}. [The
Foreign Policy]{.underline} Concept (Section 50.2, for instance),
[accuses the other Arctic countries of "militarizing" the region ---
conveniently ignoring Russia's own steady modernization of its armed
forces in its north]{.underline}.

[Russia then goes on to state it will "counteract unfriendly
states']{.underline} ... [militarization of the region]{.underline}."
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies are
pursuing an explicit "containment" strategy and trying to limit its
access to the oceanic resources, according to the Maritime Doctrine; it
goes on to say the Arctic is a place of "strategic
competition]{.underline}." According to the National Security Strategy,
Russia's Arctic development is being "obstructed" (a reference to
sanctions on oil and gas projects). The disparaging epithet of
"Anglo-Saxon" is hurled in Canada's general direction in the Foreign
Policy Concept as one of the United States' henchmen.

[The updated Russian Arctic Strategy introduces ambiguity into this
overall depiction]{.underline}. It has retained an earlier description
of the other Arctic states as "challenges" (Russian: вызовы) and did not
elevate them to threats (Russian: угрозы). While it did deprioritize the
relations with the other Arctic states from the 2020 document and
replace them with bilateral, case-by-case relations with any states, the
retention of the "challenge" language is almost certainly not an
oversight and optimistically might be seen to represent something of an
underlying offer to the Arctic community in the case of improved
relations, against the hyperbolic accusations of militarization and
Anglo-Saxonism in the other strategies. (A workable hypothesis here is
that Russia's long-term concerns in the Arctic include managing a
potentially overreaching China, for which having Arctic partners would
be decidedly beneficial for Moscow.)

#### Russian Control over to the NSR is key to their economy.

Despite recent delays [large-scale [Arctic]{.mark} projects will remain
[a key driver of Russia's economy]{.mark} in the future, new government
data show. The [Russian]{.mark} government expects [resource]{.mark}
[development]{.mark} in the region to [contribute in excess of \$160bn
in tax revenue]{.mark} to the federal budget over the next decade to
2035.]{.underline} Western sanctions have halted or slowed down a number
of projects along the Northern Sea Route -- namely Arctic LNG 2 and
Vostok Oil -- but existing projects including Yamal LNG and the Arctic
Gate oil terminal already provide substantial revenues. [A key region
for Russia's GDP The [region]{.mark} already [contributes]{.mark}
significantly to Russia's Gross domestic product (GDP) and exports. In
2024 the Arctic generated [11 percent of exports and accounted for 7.5
percent of the country's GDP]{.mark}. Those [figures]{.mark} are likely
[to increase in the coming]{.mark} years.]{.underline} It is one of the
key economic engines of Russia\'s development In comparison the state of
Alaska accounts for only 0.3 percent of U.S. GDP. In neighboring Canada
that figure is 0.5 percent for the three northern territories. \"[The
Arctic is a geostrategic territory on a global scale. It is one of the
[key]{.mark} [economic]{.mark} [engines]{.mark} of Russia\'s
development,"]{.underline} said Alexey Chekunkov, Minister for the
Development of the Far East and the Arctic, in remarks last week. "As
the projects that have already begun are implemented, the importance of
the Arctic in the economy, logistics and national security of Russia
will only increase," he continued. Russia has earmarked investments of
\$40bn over the next decade to create an economic environment to ensure
implementation of all proposed projects. If the government can meet
those significant financial investments, however, remains to be seen.
President Putin's lofty goals of reaching 80 million tons of cargo along
the route by 2024 did not materialize, with the total tonnage only
coming in at slightly less than half of that figure last year. "The
government's central task is to ensure such conditions for the life and
work of people in the Arctic that all plans for the development of the
macro-region come true," Chekunkov concluded. The development of
infrastructure along the Northern Sea Route, including ports and
nuclear-powered icebreakers ensuring year-round access, will be key to
implementing the economic plan. Russia recently commissioned its eighth
nuclear icebreaker, the largest fleet it has ever operated, exceeding
previous records set during the height of the Cold War. By 2030 the
fleet is set to encompass ten vessels. [[Shipping]{.mark}
[traffic]{.mark} associated with oil and liquefied natural gas projects
along the Northern Sea Route also generates [substantial]{.mark}
[revenue]{.mark} for Rosatomflot, operator of the country's nuclear
icebreaker fleet.]{.underline} [Fees for large oil tankers and LNG
carriers can reach between \$[300,000 -- \$700,000 for a single
escort]{.mark}]{.underline}, depending on the size of the vessel, the
distance traveled and the time of year. In 2024 Atomflot provided
escorts to 976 vessels. A standard delivery of supercooled gas from the
existing Yamal LNG plant racks up [icebreaker fees of around \$400,000.
Out of a total of 287 shipments in 2024, at least 120 required
icebreaker escorts between the months of December and May, [likely
generating in excess of \$50m]{.mark} for Atomflot]{.underline}. How
exactly Western shipping owners and operators of the LNG carriers
provide payment to Atomflot is unknown; the Russian state-owned entity
has been under sanctions since May 2023.

#### Russian oil revenue survives through new NSR routes to China. 

**Humpert, 23** \[ Malte Humpert is a journalist for the High North
News, which focuses on arctic issues, 8-3-2023, \"Russian Crude Oil Now
Flowing To China Via Arctic Ocean\", High North News,
https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russian-crude-oil-now-flowing-china-arctic-ocean\]//WMD

With the onset of the summer navigation season on the Northern Sea Route
([[NSR]{.mark}), Russia has begun sending [crude oil shipments to
China]{.mark} via the Arctic. After an initial trial voyage in November
2022, energy analysts expect Russia to send [regular shipments]{.mark}
through the Arctic during 2023 and beyond]{.underline}. With Europe
completely out of the picture as a result of sanctions, [Russia now
diverts parts of its Arctic production to China]{.underline}. Additional
shipments are destined for India. Two initial shipments departed from
the Primorsk and Ust-Luga oil terminals near St Petersburg on 12 July
and 13 July, passing through the Baltic Sea and up the Norwegian coast
lines. The two Aframax oil tankers, NS Arctic and Primorsky Prospect,
each carrying around 730,000 barrels of crude oil, traveled along the
NSR throughout the second half of July and are expected to arrive in
Rizhao, China in mid-August[. Compared to the traditional route through
the Suez Canal, the [Arctic shortcut is around 30 percent
faster]{.mark}.]{.underline} In November 2022 the tanker Vasily Dinkov
traveled from near Murmansk also to Rizhao in around four weeks. The NSR
will be key to diverting the flow of crude oil away from Europe and
toward Asia. With the massive Vostok oil project slated to open next
year, the amount of crude oil being shipped via the Arctic will increase
rapidly. [Until recently the NSR had seen less than a handful of oil
shipments to Asia over the past decade.]{.underline} The pivot to the
East in terms of the flow of exports of oil and liquefied natural gas
(LNG) was always planned by the Russian government, says Matt Sagers who
specializes in Russian energy at S&P Global, a research and analysis
company. "This process is now being pushed harder with the loss of the
European market for Russian oil and the re-orientation of oil exports to
"East of Suez". [Use of the Northern \[Sea\] Route reduced the number of
days at sea and therefore the number of tankers (and overall capacity)
that is required to move oil eastward. Entire upstream developments,
like Vostok Oil, are intended to be evacuated via the
route]{.underline}," explains Sagers. And the overall volumes will
likely expand quickly given the availability of suitable vessels.
"According to our records, Russian state-owned tanker company -
Sovcomflot (SCF) alone owned over 35 ice class tankers above 70,000 dwt.
There is more tonnage in operation, with varied ownership," says
Svetlana Lobaciova, Senior Market Analyst at E.A. Gibson, an
international shipbroker. Shipping crude oil via the Arctic, compared to
LNG, coal, or general cargo, significantly increases the risk profile
for the region, experts say. "Overall, increased traffic increases the
probability of an accident occurring in this region, and the
consequences would be very high," says Mawuli Afenyo, Professor for
Maritime Business Administration at Texas A & M University, who has
conducted extensive research on oil spills in the Arctic. Oil spills in
ice-covered waters add a whole new level of complexity to the problem,
Afenyo says. "Oil spills in open water are already complex and
difficult, with far-reaching impacts. It becomes even more complex when
the oil spills in ice-covered waters, because the oil could get
encapsulated in ice, get in between leads, and spill on snow in some
cases." Oil encapsulated in ice can then quickly travel significant
distances before the ice melts and the oil gets released into the ocean.
"This means an oil spill can occur at one point, but the effects could
be felt many miles away," Afenyo emphasizes. In terms of cleaning up oil
spills in ice-covered waters, burning the oil in place has been
identified as the most effective and often only option, with serious
environmental impacts. Environmental organizations also warn against
further fossil fuel exploration in the region. "New fossil fuel
production projects in the Arctic pose additional risks to Arctic
ecosystems, species and communities that have been already impacted by
rising temperatures," explains Dr Sian Prior, Lead Advisor to the Clean
Arctic Alliance, a coalition of 20 non-profit organizations working to
protect the Arctic. The region's remoteness and lack of infrastructure
will also increase the response time, prolonging the time the oil
remains in the water. "Remote and harsh Arctic conditions means long
spill response clean-up times, with accidents ruining local ecosystems
for decades," cautions Prior. [[China]{.mark} [taking]{.mark}
[advantage]{.mark} of new reality Meanwhile, China stands to [benefit
from Russia's pivot to the East]{.mark} as it continues to expand its
energy imports, [primarily LNG and crude]{.mark} [from the
Arctic.]{.mark} In 2022, [Russia]{.mark} surpassed Saudi Arabia as
China's [largest supplier of]{.mark} oil. In total, [China]{.mark} spent
\$[58bn]{.mark} on [oil imports]{.mark} from Russia in 2022, [a
figure]{.mark} that is likely [to grow larger]{.mark} this
year]{.underline}. In addition, it purchased \$8bn of LNG from Russia,
primarily from Novatek's Yamal LNG plant in the Arctic. Last year Russia
sent around 35 percent of its oil exports to China, up from 31 percent
in 2021. On [average, China pays \$7 less per barrel for Russian crude
oil than it pays for products from other countrie]{.underline}s.
Analysts say that Chinese refineries have been able [to use the western
ban on Russian crude oil to their advantage in price negotiations with
Russian sellers.]{.underline} "[As [Moscow]{.mark} is [no longer able to
sell its fossil fuels in Europe,]{.mark} [Asia has become a vital
partner]{.mark} for Russian energy trade, with [China]{.mark} [at the
head]{.mark} of the line,"]{.underline} explains Marc Lanteigne
professor and researcher in politics, security and international
relations at the University of Tromsø. "Beijing has also successfully
been able to negotiate bargain prices for these shipments, helpful at a
time when China is still recovering from its post-Covid economic
disruptions," he continues. While Chinese support of Russia's energy
ambitions has limits -- in May President Xi Jinping did not publicly
endorse the development of the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline -- it
[appears committed to take receipt of fossil fuels delivered via the
NSR. "It is highly likely that [Beijing]{.mark} [will]{.mark}
[continue]{.mark} [to]{.mark} take advantage of a window of opportunity
to [import more oil and gas from Russia]{.mark} as European markets
remain closed,"]{.underline} concludes Lanteigne.

2022, [Russia has made more than [three times as much money]{.mark} by
exporting hydrocarbons [than Ukraine has received in aid
allocated]{.mark} by its allies]{.underline}. Data analysed by the BBC
show that Ukraine\'s Western allies have paid Russia more for its
hydrocarbons than they have given Ukraine in aid. [Campaigners say
governments in Europe and North America need to do more to stop Russian
oil and gas from fuelling the war with Ukraine]{.underline}.
[[Proceeds]{.mark} made [from]{.mark} [selling oil and gas]{.mark} are
key to keeping Russia\'s war machine going. Oil and gas [account for
almost a third of Russia\'s state revenue]{.mark} and more than [60% of
its exports]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the wake of the February 2022
invasion, Ukraine\'s allies imposed sanctions on Russian hydrocarbons.
The US and UK banned Russian oil and gas, while the EU banned Russian
seaborne crude imports, but not gas. [Despite this, by 29 May,
[Russia]{.mark} [had]{.mark} [made]{.mark} more than €883bn
(\$[973bn]{.mark}; £740bn) [in revenue]{.mark} from fossil fuel exports
since the start of the full-scale invasion, including €228bn from the
sanctioning countries]{.underline}, according to the Centre for Research
on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). The lion\'s share of that amount,
€209bn, came from EU member states. EU states continued importing
pipeline gas directly from Russia until Ukraine cut the transit in
January 2025, and Russian crude oil is still piped to Hungary and
Slovakia. Russian gas is still piped to Europe in increasing quantities
via Turkey: CREA\'s data shows that its volume rose by 26.77% in January
and February 2025 over the same period in 2024. Hungary and Slovakia are
also still receiving Russian pipeline gas via Turkey. EU institutions
such the European Union and the European Commission have allocated more
than €52bn in aid to Ukraine so far. Despite the West\'s efforts, in
2024 Russian revenues from fossil fuels fell by a mere 5% compared with
2023, along with a similar 6% drop in the volumes of exports, according
to CREA. Last year also saw a 6% increase in Russian revenues from crude
oil exports, and a 9% year-on-year increase in revenues from pipeline
gas. Russian estimates say gas exports to Europe rose by up to 20% in
2024, with liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports reaching record levels.
Currently, half of Russia\'s LNG exports go the EU, CREA says. The EU\'s
foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, says the alliance has not imposed
\"the strongest sanctions\" on Russian oil and gas because some member
states fear an escalation in the conflict and because buying them is
\"cheaper in the short term\". LNG imports have not been included in the
latest, [17th package of sanctions on Russia approved by the EU, but it
has adopted a road map towards ending all [Russian gas imports]{.mark}
by the end of 2027. Data shows that money made by Russia from selling
fossil fuels has [consistently]{.mark} [surpassed]{.mark} the amount of
aid Ukraine receives from its allies]{.underline}. The thirst for fuel
can get in the way of the West\'s efforts to limit Russia\'s ability to
fund its war.

Despite recent delays [large-scale [Arctic]{.mark} projects will remain
[a key driver of Russia's economy]{.mark} in the future, new government
data show. The [Russian]{.mark} government expects [resource]{.mark}
[development]{.mark} in the region to [contribute in excess of \$160bn
in tax revenue]{.mark} to the federal budget over the next decade to
2035.]{.underline} Western sanctions have halted or slowed down a number
of projects along the Northern Sea Route -- namely Arctic LNG 2 and
Vostok Oil -- but existing projects including Yamal LNG and the Arctic
Gate oil terminal already provide substantial revenues. [A key region
for Russia's GDP The [region]{.mark} already [contributes]{.mark}
significantly to Russia's Gross domestic product (GDP) and exports. In
2024 the Arctic generated [11 percent of exports and accounted for 7.5
percent of the country's GDP]{.mark}. Those [figures]{.mark} are likely
[to increase in the coming]{.mark} years.]{.underline} It is one of the
key economic engines of Russia\'s development In comparison the state of
Alaska accounts for only 0.3 percent of U.S. GDP. In neighboring Canada
that figure is 0.5 percent for the three northern territories. \"[The
Arctic is a geostrategic territory on a global scale. It is one of the
[key]{.mark} [economic]{.mark} [engines]{.mark} of Russia\'s
development,"]{.underline} said Alexey Chekunkov, Minister for the
Development of the Far East and the Arctic, in remarks last week. "As
the projects that have already begun are implemented, the importance of
the Arctic in the economy, logistics and national security of Russia
will only increase," he continued. Russia has earmarked investments of
\$40bn over the next decade to create an economic environment to ensure
implementation of all proposed projects. If the government can meet
those significant financial investments, however, remains to be seen.
President Putin's lofty goals of reaching 80 million tons of cargo along
the route by 2024 did not materialize, with the total tonnage only
coming in at slightly less than half of that figure last year. "The
government's central task is to ensure such conditions for the life and
work of people in the Arctic that all plans for the development of the
macro-region come true," Chekunkov concluded. The development of
infrastructure along the Northern Sea Route, including ports and
nuclear-powered icebreakers ensuring year-round access, will be key to
implementing the economic plan. Russia recently commissioned its eighth
nuclear icebreaker, the largest fleet it has ever operated, exceeding
previous records set during the height of the Cold War. By 2030 the
fleet is set to encompass ten vessels. [[Shipping]{.mark}
[traffic]{.mark} associated with oil and liquefied natural gas projects
along the Northern Sea Route also generates [substantial]{.mark}
[revenue]{.mark} for Rosatomflot, operator of the country's nuclear
icebreaker fleet.]{.underline} [Fees for large oil tankers and LNG
carriers can reach between \$[300,000 -- \$700,000 for a single
escort]{.mark}]{.underline}, depending on the size of the vessel, the
distance traveled and the time of year. In 2024 Atomflot provided
escorts to 976 vessels. A standard delivery of supercooled gas from the
existing Yamal LNG plant racks up [icebreaker fees of around \$400,000.
Out of a total of 287 shipments in 2024, at least 120 required
icebreaker escorts between the months of December and May, [likely
generating in excess of \$50m]{.mark} for Atomflot]{.underline}. How
exactly Western shipping owners and operators of the LNG carriers
provide payment to Atomflot is unknown; the Russian state-owned entity
has been under sanctions since May 2023.

#### China and Russia's joint bomber exercise proves their escalating partnership and the need for better US defenses

"Why Did China and Russia Stage a Joint Bomber Exercise Near Alaska?" https://www.csis.org/analysis/why-did-china-and-russia-stage-joint-bomber-exercise-near-alaska)**

[On July 24, [the]{.mark} North American Aerospace Defense Command
([NORAD]{.mark}) [intercepted two Chines]{.mark}e Xian H-6K
[bombers]{.mark} and [two Russian]{.mark} Tu-95MS Bear [bombers flying
near Alaska. Both]{.mark}]{.underline} types of bombers [[are]{.mark}
[nuclear capable]{.mark}.]{.underline} The bombers were intercepted by
American F-16s and F-35s and Canadian CF-18 fighter jets. While the
aircraft remained in international airspace and did not fly into
Canadian or U.S. sovereign airspace, they were operating in the Alaska
Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). [[These joint flights come at a
time of growing]{.mark} great power [competition]{.mark} and
[solidifying the Chinese-Russian]{.mark} "no limits"
[partnership]{.mark}. This incident was the first of its kind for the
two countries, [showing a willingness of Beijing and Moscow to extend
cooperation to]{.mark} their strategic [nuclear forces]{.mark} and
[signaling their continued testing of U.S. resolve]{.mark}, including
through actions in proximity to the U.S. homeland.]{.underline} Q1: Is
it normal for China and Russia to conduct joint patrols in the Pacific?
A1: [This is the first time China and Russia have conducted a joint air
patrol near Alaska and in the northern Pacific. It is also the first
time that Chinese and Russian aircraft have taken off from the same
Russian air base.]{.underline} The bombers came within 200 miles of the
coast of Alaska. While staying within international airspace, they did
fly through Alaska's ADIZ---airspace that is controlled for national
security reasons, where aircraft are required to identify themselves.
According to a statement by the Russian Ministry of Defence, the
countries were conducting joint strategic air patrols in a "new area of
joint operations" with two Chinese Xian H-6 planes and two Russian Tu-95
bombers, escorted by Russian fighter jets. This is the eighth joint
bomber flight that China and Russia have conducted since 2019. The
previous bomber flights were conducted in the Sea of Japan, East China
Sea, and Western Pacific, with some flying through the ADIZ of Japan and
South Korea. Not just limited to bombers, [Chinese and Russian joint air
and maritime patrols in the Indo-Pacific have also become more frequent,
[suggesting a deepening and broadening level of bilateral
cooperation]{.mark} since Beijing and Moscow declared a "no limits"
partnership in 2022.]{.underline} Q2: Why are Russia and China
conducting joint patrols and why now? A2: A spokesperson for China's
Ministry of National Defense said [the purpose of the strategic air
patrol was "further testing and enhancing the level of cooperation
between the two air forces, as well as deepening strategic mutual trust
and practical cooperation between the two countries."]{.underline} He
also stressed that it was not aimed at any third parties and "has
nothing to do with the current international and regional situation."
Given the growing competition in the region, including rising nuclear
risks, [[this]{.mark} statement [should be viewed in a wider
context]{.mark}.]{.underline} As a result of their continued
cooperation, [[China and Russia are demonstrating that they can jointly
project military power]{.mark} in the region [and reach the U.S.
homeland]{.mark}, while also building greater operational proficiency
among their military forces. This patrol is just the latest
manifestation of [increasing military cooperation]{.mark} and
sophistication [in]{.mark} [the China-Russia partnership]{.mark}. The
timing of these flights could also be seen as a counter to high-profile
international events between the United States and its allies in the
region.]{.underline} Beijing and Moscow have done this in the past. In
May 2022, coincident with a meeting of Quad leaders in Tokyo, Chinese
H-6 bombers and Russian Tu-95 bombers flew near Japanese airspace,
leading Japan to scramble fighter jets in response. Now, this incident
comes as the United States, along with 28 allies and partners, carries
out its biennial Rim of the Pacific Exercise---the world's largest
international maritime exercise, which earlier this month included a
test of a B-2 bomber sinking a maritime target. China was not invited
after abusing past invites. It also comes as U.S. secretary of defense
Lloyd Austin and U.S. secretary of state Antony Blinken are visiting
Japan for the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee meeting, which
will be followed by Austin's visit to the Philippines---which has
expanded its defense cooperation with the United States under President
Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Additionally, on August 6, Austin will host an
Australia-U.S. Ministerial Consultation in Annapolis. These and other
initiatives, such as the Nuclear Consultative Group with South Korea and
the Australia-UK-U.S. agreement on joint development of nuclear
submarines and technology sharing, point to a strengthening of alliances
to posture against intensifying Chinese and North Korean military
activities in the region and further Russian aggression in and beyond
Ukraine. While Beijing and Moscow may assert the exercises are a means
of counterbalancing Western influence and attempting to divide the
United States from its allies, they seem to be having the opposite
effect. Q3: Are these bomber flights part of a broader military
cooperation agenda between China and Russia? A3: [Both Beijing and
Moscow have described past joint bomber flights as being conducted "in
accordance with their annual military cooperation plan"]{.underline}
(author's translation). This plan, [designed to enhance the strategic
partnership and coordination between their armed forces, has manifested
through various military activities]{.underline}, including joint air
patrols, naval exercises, and training missions. [Their partnership
has]{.underline} also [[expanded to nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}, space,
and industrial base [[cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Chinese and
Russian navies have engaged in joint exercises since 2012, including
exercises in the Baltic Sea, the Sea of Japan, and the Arctic. Last
summer, a flotilla of 11 ships sailed near the coast of Alaska and the
Aleutian Islands, comprised of Chinese and Russian destroyers, an
intelligence collection ship, and other support vessels. This month, the
two navies commenced their annual joint maritime patrol in the
Asia-Pacific region, including a three-day exercise in the South China
Sea. In 2018, [[China declared itself a "Near-Arctic State"]{.mark} and
expressed an interest in the Arctic for both economic and strategic
reasons. As the polar ice caps melt, [the region could open up new
shipping lanes]{.mark} [that would be of particular value to China in
expanding its trade routes with an "Ice Silk Road]{.mark}."]{.underline}
A 2022 RAND study concluded that China does not have a major presence in
the region, but "not for lack of trying," having dispatched numerous
research expeditions and attempting to conclude a \$150 million gold
mine deal, which was blocked by Canada. [[China]{.mark} may be [seeking
to leverage Russia's presence in the Arctic]{.mark} as it attempts to
gain a stronger foothold in the region. Beyond joint strategic bomber
flights, the [partnership includes nuclear
cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Since 2018, China has regularly sent
forces to participate in Russia's annual military district-level
exercises (e.g., Kavkaz, Tsentr, Vostok, and Zapad). Additionally, in
early 2023, Western media reported that Rosatom---Russia's state-run
nuclear energy corporation---was supplying China with thousands of
kilograms of highly enriched uranium to fuel fast breeder reactors. U.S.
officials believe that these reactors will produce weapons-grade
plutonium for Beijing's nuclear weapons program. Relating to space and
missile defense, Beijing and Moscow signed technology transfer
agreements in 2017 and 2019, although it is unclear whether such
transfers between the two countries have increased. However, Chinese
firms have provided the Wagner Group with satellite imagery to assist
its combat operations in Ukraine. Finally, [[China]{.mark} plays a key
role in [supporting Russia's war in Ukraine]{.mark}. Beijing is
providing Russia with "dual-use material and components for weapons,"
which has only increased since Russia invaded Ukraine.]{.underline} Q4:
Were the flights intentionally escalatory and should we expect more of
them? A4: [Alaskan national security leaders have highlighted the
potentially escalatory nature of Chinese-Russian flights]{.underline}.
U.S. senator Lisa Murkowski described the [patrol as an "unprecedented
provocation by our adversaries,"]{.underline} while U.S. senator Dan
Sullivan declared, ["Make no mistake, [this is an
escalation]{.mark}."]{.underline} Intercepts in the Alaska ADIZ,
however, are far from unusual: on average, NORAD conducted six to seven
intercepts of Russian aircraft annually between 2007 and 2023. While the
presence of Chinese bombers in this latest patrol is new, the operation
follows a similar pattern to previous Russian patrols near Alaska, with
aircraft operating in international airspace and comporting to
international law and practice. The real significance of the patrol is
in what it demonstrates about growing cooperation between China and
Russia and intensifying competition between the United States and those
adversaries. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should expect
continued challenges]{.mark} from China and Russia in the Western
Hemisphere to demonstrate that the U.S. homeland is within their reach,
as well as further challenges across other domains]{.underline},
including at sea, in space, and across the nuclear dimension. [Both the
Chinese and Russian bombers involved in the patrol were nuclear capable,
a signal that corresponds with the [rapid expansion of China]{.mark}'s
[nuclear forces and persistent Russian nuclear
saber-rattling]{.mark}]{.underline}. Q5: How should the United States
respond to future provocations? A5: Defense Secretary Austin explained
in a press briefing on July 25 that the Chinese and Russian aircraft
approaching U.S. airspace was "not a surprise," revealing that U.S.
forces had "closely monitored these aircraft, tracked the aircraft,
intercepted the aircraft," with reference to the United States' "very
good surveillance capabilities." The fact that NORAD was able to track
and intercept Chinese and Russian bombers over 200 miles from the U.S.
coast illustrates the strength of U.S. early warning and intelligence
capabilities and the preparedness of U.S. and allied air forces. By
continuing to demonstrate professionalism in these incidents and calling
out irresponsible adversary behavior---as Chinese and Russian air and
maritime forces frequently demonstrate---the United States can highlight
its adversaries' aggressive behavior for the international community.
[[U.S.]{.mark} leaders]{.underline}, however,
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} further [[improve homeland defenses
against a wider range of threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} While NORAD can
reliably detect and intercept adversary aircraft, [the [Chinese balloon
incident]{.mark}]{.underline} in early 2023 [[revealed gaps]{.mark} in
the United States' ability to detect and disrupt other adversary
activity in U.S. airspace.]{.underline} Further, the bipartisan U.S.
Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States
[observed advances in Chinese and Russian [coercive attack
weapons]{.mark} that [can reach the U.S.]{.mark} homeland. [Improvements
to]{.mark} U.S. homeland [defense radars]{.mark} and accelerating the
fielding of integrated air and [missile defense capabilities]{.mark}
would [equip U.S. forces to better defend]{.mark} the U.S. homeland
[from]{.mark} a variety of [potential threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Another factor behind the US interest in the Arctic is the enduring
influence of Alfred Mahan's (1840--1914) geopolitical doctrine on
American strategic thinking since the time of President Theodore
Roosevelt (1901--1909). Mahan was a friend and adviser to Roosevelt, and
his geopolitical ideas helped shape the president's policies. During
Roosevelt's presidency, the United States became the second most
powerful naval force in the world, behind the United Kingdom. [Mahan
believed]{.underline} that [world dominance could be achieved through
control of global trade routes that crossed the seas and
oceans.]{.underline} [Maintaining dominance over the
seas]{.underline}---not the land, as Halford Mackinder
believed---[during both peace and war meant domination of the
world.]{.underline} Looking Ahead [Mahan's arguments and recent history
suggest that the Arctic could become a major global trade route in the
future. If the United States does not gain significant influence over
it---matching Washington's current dominance over southern routes---the
result could be a significantly weakened US hegemony and changes to the
global order.]{.underline} Yet all of these strategic ambitions---from
resource extraction to military positioning and new trade routes---are
closely tied to the future of climate change. [If the Arctic continues
to thaw as expected, a major geopolitical, economic and strategic shift
may occur, redrawing the map of global power dynamics, intensifying
competition and conflict in a new region]{.underline}, and shifting the
center of political gravity toward the Arctic.

### Russian Expansionism

ALB\]

At a December public forum in St. Petersburg, Admiral Nikolay [Yevmenov,
head of the Russian navy, spoke of a "full-scale development beyond the
200-mile limit" of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone in the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}. What I am translating as "development" here is the
Russian word освоение, a word that bears multiple translations,
extending from development to mastery to expansion, often with an
economic angle. [Elsewhere, it is translated as "take-over" or
"expansion." The context in which he spoke it was in relation to the
Arctic as a "strategic resource base" of economic
development]{.underline}.

In his remarks, [Yevmenov closely ties that economic development to the
defense of sovereignty]{.underline} and territorial integrity in
relation [to that resource base]{.underline}, [displaying how
closely]{.underline} [national security, defense and economics are
intertwined in Russian]{.underline} economic [thinking about the
Arctic]{.underline}.

[His words were]{.underline} fully [in line with the]{.underline} body
of [strategic thinking that]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n
Federation under President Vladimir Putin [has established since
2020]{.underline}. [What we find in them does not sit comfortably with
the concept of an "A5" of Arctic Ocean littoral states working together
to settle jurisdictional questions diplomatically]{.underline}, a
concept captured in the 2008 Ilulisat Declaration signed by Canada, the
Kingdom of Denmark (for Greenland), Norway, Russia and the United
States.

A careful unpacking of Russia's evolving approach to international law
and relations in the Arctic is in order.

[First, we should take a step back to look at what is at
stake]{.underline}. [Demarcating the jurisdictional map of the far
northern continental shelf has so far been largely a matter of science,
in accordance with]{.underline} requirements the United Nation's
Convention on [the Law of the Sea]{.underline}. Briefly put, its
[Article 76 permits a country to extend past its 200-mile exclusive
economic zone to the margins of the continental shelf should it be
demonstrated its physical characteristics are continuous. That
demarcation comes with rights to exploit resources in that expanded
zone]{.underline}.

Canada, Denmark and Russia have all submitted the data underlying their
respective claims to the UN's Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf, which rules on the integrity of the science. (The
United States, not a signatory to the Law of the Sea, released its claim
in fall 2023.) [The commission ruled in 2023 that most of Russia's
submission was valid]{.underline}. [Canada's and Denmark's claims are
only likely to be pronounced upon later this decade or early
next]{.underline}. As of now, Canada, Denmark and Russia claim some of
the same places in the central Arctic Ocean, concentrated along the
Lomonosov Ridge.

[Once the commission has ruled, a situation may emerge where all three
have empirically justified claims to the same part of the
shelf]{.underline}. If so, the final jurisdictional boundaries are
agreed upon bilaterally. Canada-Denmark negotiations may not be easy,
but however cool-minded they are, they will also be more or less
amicable, and strictly at the negotiating table. A precedent for that is
the settling of boundary disputes on Hans/Tartupaluk Island and in the
Labrador Sea they concluded in 2022.

[So, what about Russia? There is good reason to think that Russia will
be less than an amicable negotiator and not leave it to the diplomats
alone]{.underline}.

Here it is important to look at what the Russian leadership is saying on
the matter. Useful resources are its main strategic documents, released
over the last four years. The 2023 Foreign Policy Concept, the 2023
amendments to the 2020 Arctic Strategy, the 2022 Maritime Doctrine and
the 2021 National Security Strategy reveal that [Russia]{.underline}
indeed [thinks]{.underline} that [it has a lot at stake]{.underline}.
Canada, Denmark and [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[should take these seriously and prepare accordingly]{.underline}.

To start, [these documents make clear that the Arctic Ocean and its
continental shelves]{.underline} [are an integral part of Russia's
geopolitics and prosperity]{.underline}. [The Russian position is
committed to exercising an extended jurisdiction on the Arctic Ocean's
continental shelf]{.underline}. Significantly, [the National Security
Strategy identifies the military's defense of the continental shelf as a
priority, a "goal of state security]{.underline}," [which dovetails with
the document's emphasis on resource exploitation rights as a function of
national security and the general priority of the Arctic region in this
regard.]{.underline}

[The Maritime Doctrine lists the Arctic as the top priority of maritime
strategy and is outspoken on Russian interests beyond its exclusive
economic zone to the continental shelf and the delimitation of maritime
boundaries under international law]{.underline}. The Foreign Policy
Concept says that [Russia will "step up]{.underline}" (Russian:
активизации) [the delineating of these borders in a region it identifies
as the second most important]{.underline} after the countries of central
Asia and eastern Europe, and what it calls the "near abroad."

[These statements fit into a process of geopolitical transformation
Russia is trying to undertake to turn into a coastal Eurasian power,
defined as much by its northern maritime edge as its terrestrial land
mass]{.underline}. [While the Arctic has long been touted as central to
Russian identity]{.underline}, [global warming is opening sea lanes that
also conveniently enable Russia's pivot to Asia, accelerated by the
precarious relations with Europe]{.underline}.

[This vision of Arctic coastal Russia is closely tied to its prosperity
agenda]{.underline}. The region had already been an important part of
economic planning. [Now it is coming to be seen as the linchpin of
future economic development. The Maritime Doctrine describes the Arctic
Ocean as the only "vital" ocean to national interests, with its
socio-economic development a "decisive condition" for future
prosperity]{.underline}. [Seabed resources on the continental shelf, it
claims, are "predetermined" to be essential to alleviating depleted
terrestrial deposits]{.underline} (itself a questionable claim).

[Into this mix the strategies assess a sharply competitive, sometimes
violent international context, including in the Arctic]{.underline}.
[The strategic documents describe the other Arctic countries as
exhibiting varying degrees of hostility to Russia]{.underline}. [The
Foreign Policy]{.underline} Concept (Section 50.2, for instance),
[accuses the other Arctic countries of "militarizing" the region ---
conveniently ignoring Russia's own steady modernization of its armed
forces in its north]{.underline}.

[Russia then goes on to state it will "counteract unfriendly
states']{.underline} ... [militarization of the region]{.underline}."
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies are
pursuing an explicit "containment" strategy and trying to limit its
access to the oceanic resources, according to the Maritime Doctrine; it
goes on to say the Arctic is a place of "strategic
competition]{.underline}." According to the National Security Strategy,
Russia's Arctic development is being "obstructed" (a reference to
sanctions on oil and gas projects). The disparaging epithet of
"Anglo-Saxon" is hurled in Canada's general direction in the Foreign
Policy Concept as one of the United States' henchmen.

[The updated Russian Arctic Strategy introduces ambiguity into this
overall depiction]{.underline}. It has retained an earlier description
of the other Arctic states as "challenges" (Russian: вызовы) and did not
elevate them to threats (Russian: угрозы). While it did deprioritize the
relations with the other Arctic states from the 2020 document and
replace them with bilateral, case-by-case relations with any states, the
retention of the "challenge" language is almost certainly not an
oversight and optimistically might be seen to represent something of an
underlying offer to the Arctic community in the case of improved
relations, against the hyperbolic accusations of militarization and
Anglo-Saxonism in the other strategies. (A workable hypothesis here is
that Russia's long-term concerns in the Arctic include managing a
potentially overreaching China, for which having Arctic partners would
be decidedly beneficial for Moscow.)

the projects that have already begun are implemented, the importance of
the Arctic in the economy, logistics and national security of Russia
will only increase," he continued. Russia has earmarked investments of
\$40bn over the next decade to create an economic environment to ensure
implementation of all proposed projects. If the government can meet
those significant financial investments, however, remains to be seen.
President Putin's lofty goals of reaching 80 million tons of cargo along
the route by 2024 did not materialize, with the total tonnage only
coming in at slightly less than half of that figure last year. "The
government's central task is to ensure such conditions for the life and
work of people in the Arctic that all plans for the development of the
macro-region come true," Chekunkov concluded. The development of
infrastructure along the Northern Sea Route, including ports and
nuclear-powered icebreakers ensuring year-round access, will be key to
implementing the economic plan. Russia recently commissioned its eighth
nuclear icebreaker, the largest fleet it has ever operated, exceeding
previous records set during the height of the Cold War. By 2030 the
fleet is set to encompass ten vessels. [[Shipping]{.mark}
[traffic]{.mark} associated with oil and liquefied natural gas projects
along the Northern Sea Route also generates [substantial]{.mark}
[revenue]{.mark} for Rosatomflot, operator of the country's nuclear
icebreaker fleet.]{.underline} [Fees for large oil tankers and LNG
carriers can reach between \$[300,000 -- \$700,000 for a single
escort]{.mark}]{.underline}, depending on the size of the vessel, the
distance traveled and the time of year. In 2024 Atomflot provided
escorts to 976 vessels. A standard delivery of supercooled gas from the
existing Yamal LNG plant racks up [icebreaker fees of around \$400,000.
Out of a total of 287 shipments in 2024, at least 120 required
icebreaker escorts between the months of December and May, [likely
generating in excess of \$50m]{.mark} for Atomflot]{.underline}. How
exactly Western shipping owners and operators of the LNG carriers
provide payment to Atomflot is unknown; the Russian state-owned entity
has been under sanctions since May 2023.

### Russia = Threat

#### Russia is a growing threat in the Arctic -Ukraine and military buildup prove

#### Mongilio 24 **(Heather Mongilio is a reporter with USNI News. She has a master's degree in science journalism and has covered local courts, crime, health, military affairs and the Naval Academy. "Russia's Arctic Rise". https://news.usni.org/2024/10/29/russias-arctic-rise.)**

Concerns about Russia operating in the Arctic are not new -- the U.S.
has had these apprehensions since the Soviet Union used submarine
patrols to assert power in the North Atlantic. The difference now is
that [[Arctic nations are dealing with an]{.mark} increasingly
[unpredictable Russia]{.mark}n regime [since]{.mark} President Vladimir
[Putin invaded Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, an Icelandic official told
USNI News and *The Washington Post* in a recent trip to the region.
"[[It's not only about]{.mark} the [capabilities]{.mark} of the
technology, [it's about the intention]{.mark}, and that's why it's so
important to monitor]{.underline} the \[submarine\] traffic," the
official told USNI News during a mid-October visit to Iceland. "...
\[[This is a [Russia]{.mark} that]{.underline}\] [[is willing to take
much more risk]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is actually [every day bombing
civilians in Ukraine deliberately]{.underline}. And it's the same
government that's doing that as \[is\] operating the submarines and the
planes. [So [we have to be vigilant]{.mark}]{.underline}." Russia's
increased military activity in the Arctic, including its attempts to
alter the governance in the High North, adds to the region's challenges.
[[The Arctic is a major concern]{.underline}]{.mark} for U.S. Fleet
Forces commander Adm. Daryl Caudle, partially due to the U.S. military's
lack of search and rescue abilities, the expansion of commercial and
military ships operating in the Arctic as ice melts and China's
assertion that it is an Arctic nation. Russia is an Arctic nation that's
so vast its northern border makes up 40 percent of the Arctic coastline.
[Russia wants to make Arctic waters its own]{.underline}, Caudle told
USNI News, similar to what China has done in the South China Sea.
"Additionally, the 'High North' remains the first line of defense in our
ability to conduct full spectrum maritime homeland defense, which starts
above the Arctic Circle," Caudle wrote in an email to USNI News. Iceland
is a connection between the Artic countries of North America and those
in Europe, Icelandic Minister of Foreign Affairs Thórdís Kolbrún
Reykfjörd Gylfadóttir told USNI News. The U.S. and Iceland have had a
long-standing relationship, one that Iceland values, Gylfadóttir said.
Iceland is a key base for the U.S. to track Russian submarines from both
the land and the sea, she said. Although Iceland does not have a
military, it can provide air monitoring while relying on the U.S. for
undersea surveillance. The U.S. also has a cohort of service members
deployed to Keflavik Air Base who operate P-8A Poseidon flights in the
North Atlantic. Tracking submarines in the Greenland-Iceland-United
Kingdom Gap --- a maritime chokehold due to the harsh northern waters
between the countries --- peaked during the Cold War between the Soviet
Union and the United States. It picked up again in 2014, following
Russia's annexation of Crimea, the Icelandic minister of foreign affairs
said. [Those [Arctic assets are increasingly active as]{.mark} the war
in [Ukraine continues]{.mark}. "We see, and [we know that they are quite
strong]{.mark} in that regard. And [that must worry
us]{.mark},"]{.underline} Gylfadóttir said. Russia's Arctic Intentions
Russia considers the Arctic its number one maritime priority, surpassing
the Atlantic, Former U.S. 2nd Fleet commander Vice Adm. Dan Dwyer said
during a Navy League conference last year. Moscow is, "prioritizing the
Arctic as its most important maritime direction, pledging to protect
these waters 'by all means.' This includes increasing attention on the
Arctic littorals as well as the introduction of new missile
capabilities," he said. That includes operating six dual-use military
bases, a dozen airfields and a fleet of at least 40 icebreakers. The
emphasis on the Arctic is not only military but increasingly economic,
experts have told USNI News. Moscow sees the Arctic as a strategic
source of energy and natural resources, and the Kremlin wants to
continue its scientific research in the area, Senior Associate at the
Arctic Institute Pavel Devyatkin recently told USNI News last week.
Russia also wants to manage the Northern Sea Route's shipping lanes and
protect both its economic and security interests in the region through
military presence. Recently, Moscow added a fifth component about the
Indigenous people in the region. Russia's military presence in the
Arctic peaked during the Soviet era and new increases to defense
spending have expanded operations in the region, though it's still far
below the Cold War peak, Devyatkin said. Russia's stance on the Arctic,
in terms of its 2023 defense strategy, is more domestic rather than
valuing international cooperation, Devyatkin wrote in a co-authored with
Nikita Lipunov piece for the Arctic Institute. Last year Russia revised
its Arctic 2035 policy taking a page out of China's South China Sea
playbook. In the 2023 revision to Arctic 2025, the Kremlin emphasized
its own national interest in the region and rather than working with the
Arctic Council, it would instead deal with nations bilaterally. This
comes as the other Arctic nations have shied away from working with
Moscow in protest of its invasion into Ukraine. While Russia is still a
member of councils that focus on economic concerns in the Arctic, Russia
was not invited to the last two meetings of the Arctic defense chiefs.
Instead, Russia is looking to non-Artic partners, like China, Devyatkin
said. "The Arctic is a sensitive region for Russia as it is critical to
Russia's economic outlook. The loss of Western markets and partners has
created significant problems for Arctic energy projects, but Russia will
continue to make major investments in the region (led by some of the
country's largest companies) and is confident in the viability of these
projects over the long term," he said in an email to USNI News. The
Russo-Ukrainian War might lead Russian to put more emphasis on its
Northern Fleet, according to an article in scientific journal [*Polar
Science*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873965224000070).
The Black Sea Fleet, which sustained major attacks from Ukrainian
forces, is essentially stuck in the Black Sea, while Moscow's Baltic
Fleet is now surrounded by mostly NATO countries. "Based on the Kola
Peninsula in the European Arctic, the Northern Fleet is the only
Europe-based Russian fleet with direct access to the Atlantic Ocean --
and thus to the world's oceans," reads the article, which notes that the
Northern Fleet holds almost all of Russia's nuclear submarines. Arctic
countries want to keep tension low in the region, Gylfadóttir said, but
they also have to be prepared for more chances of miscalculation or
misunderstandings that could result in military action. The Arctic
Countries Concerns [[U.S]{.mark}. and U.K. [concern about
Russia]{.mark}n submarine activity [in the Arctic]{.mark} and North
Atlantic [has]{.mark} steadily [been on the rise]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In the last year, British officials have said they now routinely see
Russian submarines operating around the U.K. and in the Irish Sea in
higher numbers. Gylfadóttir alluded to increased activity in monitoring
Russian submarines. "I would say that there is a good reason for the
increased submarine surveillance around the island and in the region,"
she said. Last year, the nuclear attack boat *Kazan*, a Yasen-M-class
guided missile submarine armed with long-range land attack missiles
sailed for exercises in the Caribbean, USNI News reported at the time.
The capability of Russia's modern nuclear attack boats and their ability
to strike targets in Europe from the High North was a major the reason
the U.S. Navy reestablished 2nd Fleet, USNI News understands.
[[Additionally]{.underline}](https://news.usni.org/2022/07/08/doomsday-submarine-armed-with-nuclear-torpedoes-delivers-to-russian-navy),
Moscow has developed a new breed of "Doomsday" submarine that fields a
school-bus-sized torpedo with a nuclear warhead designed to attack major
port cities in the Atlantic, USNI News has previously reported. The
first Project 09852 *Belgorod* delivered in 2022 and is assigned to
Russia's North Fleet. [[The growing threat]{.mark}s [is]{.mark}
[prompting officials]{.mark}]{.underline} like Caudle [[to issue more
warnings about the risk Russia poses in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The Arctic can be a bit out of sight, out of mind, but Moscow does have
a military presence there, and the country patrols the region using its
icebreakers, submarines and aircraft, he told USNI New He pointed to the
national security interests for Russia as evidence that Moscow has
priorities in the High North.

[Conclusion: How a Proactive Arctic Strategy Supports America's Focus on
the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}

The [United States publication of the 2024 Arctic Strategy provides a
transparent approach aimed at reducing the possibility of escalation in
the Arctic]{.underline}. Moreover, [the current strategy recognizes
Russia's and China's Arctic ambitions and that the growing collaboration
between Russia and the PRC have "the potential to alter the Arctic's
stability and threat picture]{.underline}." [The strategy presents a
tangible and realistic way forward for the U.S. to enhance the Joint
Force's Arctic capabilities]{.underline}, engage with Allies and
partners, and demonstrate an ability to work together across defense
forces. Although the strategy indicates increased U.S. involvement in
the Arctic, it remains reactive. The 2024 Arctic Strategy already
outlines a tangible way for the United States to commit energy and
resources to the region. Although a deliberate shift in messaging will
not change the U.S. footprint in the Arctic, it will change the U.S.
mindset towards the region. [By making the Arctic a priority, the U.S.
demonstrates its commitment to supporting its Allies in the event that
Russia or China attacks.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [by shifting to a proactive Arctic Strategy, the United
States is not abandoning its focus on the Indo-Pacific]{.underline},
[because the PRC envisions itself as a polar power and intends to
reshape the international system in its favor. Future conflict with the
PRC will not be geographically constrained to the Indo-Pacific. By
shifting to a proactive Arctic Strategy now, the United States can deter
China from expanding its control over the Arctic and its critical
resources. The future battlefield is melting and only by taking actions
today can the United States and its NATO allies win tomorrow's war in
the Arctic.]{.underline}

#### The plan wrecks currently untouched regions, having disastrous ecological effects -- THEIR AUTHOR.

At first glance, this map invokes the audience with a futuristic vision
of an elaborate high speed rail network connecting the globe, with
exciting possibilities such as traveling from New York to Paris on a
single train. The map appears to revolutionize the convenience and
accessibility of long distance international travel with ultra high
speed rail. While the map catches the eye of most for this reason, it is
important to note that transportation experts and the project proposal
itself agree that the true use-case for the Intercontinental Railway
would involve cargo and not passengers. Transporting goods between North
and South America currently requires either crossing the Panama Canal or
taking lengthy, expensive sea routes. A faster, less expensive, and more
effective mode of transportation would be made available by the
Intercontinental Railway, which would result in significant cost savings
for both businesses and consumers. Its construction would enable
seamless trading by rail between North and South America and Eurasia. By
enhancing trade, expanding markets, and lowering transportation costs,
this integration could spur economic growth in all of the regions
connected by the railway. Another advantage of this project is the
potential reduction of fossil fuels. Although building such a sizable
railway network is a monumental construction project, it would result in
more environmentally friendly transportation options. Long-haul
transportation's greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by using
electric trains that are powered by renewable energy sources. The
Intercontinental Railway would vastly diminish the frequency of highly
polluting, fossil-fuel burning cargo ships crossing the Pacific Ocean.
Conversely, [many environmentalists hold significant concerns about both
the initial and long lasting effects the railway would have. Alaska and
eastern Russia are some of the most desolate and naturally undisturbed
regions in the world. The effect of an infrastructure project of this
scale, as well as the active disturbance of a rail line cutting through
the habitats of numerous species of wildlife would have disastrous
effects on the immediate ecosystem. ]{.underline}

[Critics]{.underline} of the mega-project within Russia [such as Sergei
Grigoryev, vice-president of state controlled energy conglomerate
Transneft, have been skeptical]{.underline} of the plan. \"[We need to
first develop oil fields in East Siberi]{.underline}a,\" he noted last
month. Others have [questioned the longevity of the project, saying
North America already has plenty of energy resources]{.underline}, thus,
[eliminating a significant benefit]{.underline} of the project. [As an
alternative, opponents say Moscow should focus on providing energy to
resource-starved countries in Asia,]{.underline} such as China and
Japan. In terms of sheer size and complexity, [the]{.underline} Channel
Tunnel or \"[Chunnel]{.underline}\" connecting England and France [is
most frequently compared to the BST projec]{.underline}t. Completed in
1994 by 13,000 workers at a total cost of US\$13 billion, the seven year
project is still considered a technological marvel. But
[the]{.underline} Chunnel [project]{.underline} [has been besieged by
lingering problems such as bankruptcy, cost overruns; lower than
expected passenger and freight volumes, high operating and debt levels,
and competitive pressures. The BST project is likely to face similar --
if not more severe -- problems]{.underline}, namely, issues such as
[infrastructure development, project planning and construction will
require the development of unique geopolitical synergies]{.underline}.
Moreover, [dual U.S. and Canadian approval, inhospitable terrain,
environmental concerns, long-term financing and tunnel
administration]{.underline} will need to be adequately addressed. [Given
the current state of U.S.-Russia]{.underline} bilateral
[relations]{.underline}, recent [discussions surrounding the BST project
are]{.underline} somewhat [surprising]{.underline}. President [Putin has
shown that he will use energy as a weapon against]{.underline} countries
such as the [Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia, displaying authoritarian
tendencies that have complicated foreign relations]{.underline} with the
EU and the U.S. He has [called for the establishment of an anti-American
energy block to counter perceived global U.S. hegemony]{.underline},
making moves to organize and lead a \"gas cartel\" in both Central Asia
and the Middle East. [The idea of open competition and transparency in
Russia's energy markets has been an idea foreign to Putin]{.underline},
with the enigmatic leader consolidating his power by nationalizing key
energy sectors, imprisoning energy executives opposed to his views and
forbidding foreign access and investment in many of Russia's
\"sensitive\" industries. Moreover, [Putin has circumvented U.S.
security efforts in the U.N., attempted to crush his country's democracy
movement, increased spying and espionage activities in the West and made
statements]{.underline} this week [that his country had successfully
test-fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile]{.underline} capable
of overcoming the U.S. missile defense shield. Over the past year, Putin
has consolidated his country's energy, defense and media sectors, all
part of a larger strategic plan to increase Moscow's control and global
influence. [With such a suspect record, why would Washington want to
join forces with Moscow on the BST project, even if the economic and
energy benefits were overwhelming?]{.underline} One [important
difference]{.underline} to keep in mind as countries in Asia and North
America explore the feasibility of the BST project [is that the English
Tunnel project involved two EU countries -- France and England -- with a
history of economic, trade, security and energy cooperation. Will an
economically independent and increasingly powerful Russia be a reliable
friend or an emerging foe for America?]{.underline} For now, [Washington
would be wise to invest its money not in a 10-20 year construction
project with a Cold War adversary; rather, it should support the
development of alternative energy sources and support global markets
that ensure free competition, transparency, human rights and Western
ideals.]{.underline}

Aside from building an ACRL, which would be the foundational stage,
[stages two and three of creating a Bering Strait crossing really
involve Russia.]{.underline} Frankly, [there is no reason to lay track
in Alaska between Fairbanks and Nome unless there is clear intent to
connect to the Russian rail system]{.underline}. Privately, [one senior
Alaskan political leader admitted he supports eventually building a
Bering Strait tunnel, but unless Russia and other]{.underline} countries
(e.g., China, South Korea, Canada) [clamor for it, the American side
will never act on its own]{.underline}.\[18\] [Without clear-cut
demonstrations of international support and]{.underline} even
[insistence, from the American point-of-view this project will remain a
pipe dream. Since 2007, Russia has expressed noticeable interest in a
Bering Strait tunnel]{.underline} according to press reports.\[19\] In
fact, in the lead up to recent G8 and G20 summits, the Russian news
services have speculated that the project would be on the summit agenda.
Even though that did not occur, one may presume that behind the scenes
Russian delegates broached this subject with Chinese, Canadian, American
and other attendees. While the [degree of Russia's professed interest
may vary depending on the current world economy]{.underline}, the
country that will most influence the U.S. to begin to take the project
seriously is Russia. Perhaps a sustained Russian effort to lobby the
American political leadership over a decade or more will ultimately bear
fruit, especially if world economic and political conditions become more
stable. Of course, over such a period, [U.S.-Russian relations must
greatly improve \-- and definitely not sour]{.underline}.
[Once]{.underline} the [Americans realize the Russians are indeed
serious, and consistently so over several Russian administrations, then
the U.S. will get the message that it cannot afford to ignore this
project. Not to be underestimated are the national security implications
of creating a Bering Strait project. A great deal of the strategic and
military policy of each nation toward the other will have to be modified
and updated to reflect a higher level of trust that will be a
prerequisite to commencing this project. More immediately, the maritime
boundary between Russia and the U.S. in the Arctic is still not agreed
upon, despite an exchange of diplomatic notes with the Soviet Union
in]{.underline} 1990.\[20\] [This will have to be settled well before
consideration of a Bering Strait tunnel.]{.underline} The Bering Strait
project must be seen by both Russia and the U.S. (as well as Canada and
China) as an historic task that will cement their ties for the
long-term, and bridge not only former adversaries but entire continents
and hemispheres. It should be seen as a great global task of permanent
peace-building.

#### No political support because of costs and relations -- project only benefits the powerful 

**Shirk 15** \[Shirk, Adrian. "A Highway Across the Ocean." *The

[Given]{.underline} the [massive costs and unpredictable engineering
challenges associated with such projects,]{.underline} not to mention
[political obstacles, none have come to fruitio]{.underline}n. And in
addition to those setbacks, [today's TEPR may have difficulty selling
ground transportation as a viable alternative to flying.]{.underline} So
why do they keep coming up? (And even if that hypothetical New Yorker
could wheel her way to continental Europe---would she? Through thousands
of miles of freezing wilderness?) Perhaps that's the wrong question.
While the image of the East and West joined by casual passenger traffic
is romantic, the real return would be new channels of energy resource
transport, as well as oil and gas development in the arctic. Yakunin,
the Russian Railways executive, said the TEPR would include gas and oil
pipelines to help boost the country's energy profits, creating a dozen
new industries and countless jobs, and a more dynamic global economy.
The next question, then---which has been on the table now for 150
years---is [whether anyone would be willing to invest in a project that
could collectively cost trillions of dollars and whose anticipated
economic yields would be a generation away.]{.underline} Bering Strait
tunnel or no, Russia has already begun building railway through its Far
East, in hopes to expand the energy economies in its distant provinces.
Moscow and Beijing are moving forward with the construction of a high
speed train between the two cities via Siberia, funded chiefly by the
state-run China Railway High-speed, according to Business Insider: "The
Moscow-to-Beijing direct route will measure about 7,000 kilometers
(4,340 miles), effectively three times farther than the longest
high-speed railway in the world, the Beijing-to-Guangzhou train, which
is also operated by CRH." In his 2013 keynote speech at the Schiller
Institute, structural engineer Hal Cooper (of Cooper Consulting Co.,
Kirkland, Washington)---a rare American proponent of the Bering Strait
tunnel, and who has met with Yakunin in the past---reported that the
rail to the coastal Magadan is being designed now. He described Russia's
plans to build single-track diesel cars, and later, double-track
electric, in addition to a four-lane highway, and "probably natural gas
pipelines, too." He believes that all of this will foster the
development of northeastern Russia, whether or not the Bering Strait
Tunnel gets built\--but that such development would be exponentially
more profitable if it does. "[Russia's moving along with that and
they're not going to stop]{.underline}," Cooper told me. He estimates
that the Bering Strait tunnel could facilitate transport of "up to one
and a half million barrels a day... from Alberta to China, and that
alone would be enough to economically justify the project." But [there
are very few Americans even talking about this project, let alone
actively promoting it.]{.underline} One of them, of course, is Cooper,
who, in 2006, finished a 2,326-page feasibility study for the Bering
Strait tunnel (which was sponsored by the Canadian Arctic Railway
Company, whose owner later went bankrupt). And the other is Russian-born
Alaskan businessman Fyodor "Theo" Soloview, about whom Cooper says, "He
and I seem to be that [last two men standing]{.underline} \[on this
issue\] in North America at the moment." Soloview started InterBering
LLC, a consulting group that lobbies for the Bering Strait railway
tunnel. (His other business ventures include supplying the Russian Far
East with American consumer goods in the 1990s, running an art gallery
and gift shop, and inventing a genealogical card game called Six
Generations). When I ask him about the lack of North American interest
in the Bering Strait tunnel, Soloview blames politicians for being too
shortsighted: "It is a combination of lack of historical vision and
patience for both politicians and businessmen," he said. ["No politician
was really interested to fulfill this project because everyone who runs
\[for\] office is too old to see this project done]{.underline}."
Soloview says [the]{.underline} Bering Strait [tunnel is better
off]{.underline} as [private sector]{.underline} project,
[anyway]{.underline}, at least in part because [any agreements made with
Putin would be moot under a new administration. Besides, why would the
public sector invest, with Russia's economy in the tank?]{.underline}
The issue left unaddressed in both my conversations with Cooper and
Soloview is that [none of this would be possible unless current
diplomatic tensions are resolved, and]{.underline} furthermore that
[there is no natural constituency in the U.S. to support the
project]{.underline}. James Brooke reports for Voice of America that,
unlike Europe's Chunnel, "there are two islands along the Bering
route---geographical factors that would ease construction and allow for
ventilation and emergency access[.]{.underline}" This is a point that
proponents for the project often make. But the [comparison brings
together countries with totally disparate civic values: Western Europe
invests in infrastructure; America invests in defense.]{.underline} The
[project is almost mystical in its proportions]{.underline}. Were it to
succeed, it would be among the largest infrastructure projects in
history. So [the Bering Strait tunnel is,]{.underline} in effect, [a
fantastical plan at this point, tantamount to the space
elevator]{.underline}---another proposed Russian-American collaboration
spanning the 20th century---[and will almost certainly never be a
popular use of American funds.]{.underline} And the thing we have to
remember about the proposal is that, despite the rhetoric, [the real
impetus is driven largely---if not primarily---by private investment
from oil and gas]{.underline}. That old Cosmopolitan Railway ideal of
William Gilpin's seems, then, merely a cipher: [this is not exactly a
global railway bringing together "humankind as citizens in the world,"
but rather linking the private interests of a powerful few.]{.underline}

### Canada says no

#### Canada says no -- trade relations are too bad.

[Relations between Canada and the United States have reached a low point
not seen since the colonial era.]{.underline} The relationship between
the two North American nations has been largely positive since Canada
gained autonomy from Britain. Following the American Revolutionary War
in the early 1800s, the newly independent United States and the British
controlled Canadian territory went to war over Britain's refusal to
withdraw forces from south of the Great Lakes. Since then, the only
major territorial dispute came in 1903 when a row erupted over who
controlled Alaska, which eventually went the way of the US after Britain
relented. But Canadian anger at the time was aimed less at the Americans
and more at the British for that perceived betrayal. Now, [Canadians are
living through "dark days]{.underline}", according to the country's new
Prime Minister. Since his election last year, US President Donald [Trump
has repeatedly threatened to annex Canada]{.underline} while also
imposing tariffs that have set off a chaotic trade war between the once
close allies. "I think Canada would be much better off being the 51st
state because we lose \$200 billion a year with Canada. And I'm not
going to let that happen," Trump told Fox News last month. Canada's
outgoing Prime Minister Justin [Trudeau]{.underline} has [described the
newly aggressive American posture towards his country as "an existential
threat",]{.underline} while stressing that Canada will never be
America's "51st state". Canada's [incoming]{.underline} Prime Minister
Mark [Carney has kept up the fighting rhetoric]{.underline} since being
elected as leader of the ruling Liberal Party yesterday. "[Canada never
ever will be part of America in any way, shape or form]{.underline},"
Carney told Liberal Party supporters in Ottowa yesterday. "The
[Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our
country]{.underline}," he said, adding "these were dark days brought on
by a country we can no longer trust. "We have made this the greatest
country in the world and now [our neighbours want to take us. No
way]{.underline}," Carny told the crowd. "We're all being called to
stand up for... the Canadian way of life." Even before Donald Trump took
office in January, he had declared his intention to impose high tariffs
on imports from Canada, complaining that the US was "losing" billions of
dollars due to its trade deficit with its northern neighbours. Trump has
also [swung between imposing and then suspending tariffs on goods coming
across the northern border of the US.]{.underline} Canada, which last
year imported \$349.4 billion worth of US goods, has in turn responded
with its own tariffs in the ongoing trade war with its longtime ally. US
goods imports from Canada in 2024 totalled \$412.7 billion. As far back
as November 2024, Trump had promised to impose 25% tariffs on Canada and
Mexico on his first day in the Oval Office. On 1 February, Trump signed
an executive order imposing tariffs of 25% on Mexican and Canadian
imports and 10% on Chinese goods. Trump declared a national emergency --
ostensibly over undocumented immigration and drug trafficking -- in
order to do so. Trump then suspended the tariffs on Canada and Mexico on
3 February after discussions with the leaders of both countries. Thirty
days later, the tariffs came into effect, although the levy on Canadian
energy was revised down to 10%. The Canadian government retaliated by
imposing tariffs on more than \$100 billion worth of American goods.
Trump then suspended the tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods related
to the auto industry, before expanding the suspension a day later on
many imports from the two countries. Canada then suspended a planned
second wave of tariffs on US goods. [Trudeau]{.underline}, who Trump has
repeatedly called the "governor" of Canada, [said]{.underline} recently
[the US President wants "to see a total collapse of the Canadian
economy. Because that will make it easier to annex us".]{.underline}
Trump has also been issuing regular threats about annexing Canada and
making it America's "51st state", something Trudeau said would never
happen. The New York Times has reported that during discussions held
between Trump and Trudeau at the time, the US [President said he did not
believe the treaty that delineates the US-Canada border was
valid.]{.underline} In bilateral talks between US and Canadian
officials, [US Secretary of Commerce]{.underline} Howard Lutnick also
[told his Canadian]{.underline} [counterpart]{.underline} Dominic
LeBlanc [that Trump wanted to tear up agreements related to the sharing
of lakes and rivers.]{.underline} On top of that, Trump also wants to
kick Canada out of the intelligence-sharing alliance known as the Five
Eyes, which also includes the UK, Australia and New Zealand. Trudeau has
said "Canadians face from our neighbour an existential challenge", while
Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly said last week that, based on
conversations she's had with US officials, [Canada is taking Trump's
threats of annexation "very seriously".]{.underline} We didn't ask for
this fight. But Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the
gloves," Carney said on Sunday, making an ice hockey reference. "So the
Americans, they should make no mistake, in trade as in hockey, Canada
will win," he said.

#### Canada won't jump to work with the US -- tariffs spooked them.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark [Carney]{.underline} said his top Cabinet
ministers are in contact with White House officials and [want to have
"serious" negotiations about trade]{.underline}, as U.S. trading
partners brace for President Donald Trump's next barrage of tariffs.
"With respect to the president, the point is to have substantive
discussions. The point is not theater, the point is to get serious ---
[sovereign nation to sovereign nation]{.underline}," Carney told
reporters March 25 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. "That's what we're looking
for in terms of putting this trading relationship back on a new path ---
a new path that works best for Canada, given the [unreliability of
America]{.underline}." Trump said March 24 he'll announce import taxes
on automobiles in the coming days --- a move that would inflict damage
on Canada's manufacturing sector --- but indicated some nations will
receive breaks from next week's so-called "reciprocal" tariffs. His
comments created further confusion about his plans for a sweeping tariff
announcement scheduled for April 2. [Carney]{.underline} has
[said]{.underline} he's prepared for discussions with the U.S., but that
[Trump must drop his taunts about]{.underline} Canada becoming [the
51st]{.underline} U.S. [state]{.underline}. The new prime minister
hasn't spoken with Trump since being sworn in on March 14 and is now in
the middle of an election campaign, with ballots set to be cast on April
28. Carney has said he believes Trump is waiting for the outcome of the
vote before speaking with Canada's leader. "[We have
learned]{.underline}, and others have learned over time, that [there is
an unpredictability]{.underline} to U.S. trade policy. There's certainly
an [opacity to U.S. trade policy]{.underline}," Carney said. "How does
one respond to that? What you do is you prepare for the worst. And part
of that is what we have done in the last weeks," he added, pointing to
his government's changes to unemployment insurance for workers and
financial support programs for businesses. So far, [Canada has placed
retaliatory tariffs]{.underline} on about C\$60 billion (\$42 billion)
worth of U.S.-made goods in response to Trump's tariffs on a wide array
of things, including Canadian-manufactured steel and aluminum. Carney
pointed out that the government has an additional list of C\$95 billion
of U.S. products on which it plans to apply import taxes on April 2, if
Trump follows through on threats for more tariffs against Canada. The
U.S. imported about \$413 billion of goods from Canada last year, led by
energy, while exporting \$349 billion to its northern neighbor,
according to U.S. Commerce Department data. Carney, 60, also mentioned
the [government's focus on Canadian procurement and cross-country trade
to strengthen the domestic economy]{.underline} and make it less
vulnerable to Trump's threats. He has [pledged to remove all trade
barriers between provinces]{.underline} by July 1. "It shows the
Americans that we're stronger," he added. "[We're going to get stronger
where they get weaker because they are inflicting harm on themselves
with these tariffs]{.underline}, and that is going to put us in a better
place for negotiations when they come." "[We're not rushing to the
table]{.underline} to take something," he said, reiterating that [Canada
wants serious, comprehensive discussions. "That's when we will get the
best deal]{.underline} for Canada."

### CP fails

#### Engineering of the project is near impossible and there is little economic or political support

Crossing. Is It a Sci-fi Proposal or Soon to Be Reality?" *International
Youth Scientists Journal*, 20 May 2022,

[The Bering Strait is]{.underline} just [outside of the Arctic
Circle]{.underline}, and [extreme cold engulfs the region for the
majority of the year. Icebergs]{.underline} are present for 8 months a
year. In Spring, as icebergs [melt]{.underline}, pieces of ice break off
and [create "ice flows" which are hundreds of meters wide, flow
downriver at high speeds, and can produce 5,000 tons of
force]{.underline} (Ricci). Additionally, [profound temperature changes
and extremely salty seawater in the region creates wear and tear on the
bridge. Any small crack could become fatal]{.underline}. Therefore, a
new design of bridgepost is needed to ensure that the bridge can survive
such forces occurring on a regular basis. According to the documentary
Extreme Engineering by the Discovery Channel, experimentation at the
Confederation Bridge (crossing the Northumberland Strait in eastern
Canada) has discovered that a cone shaped bridgepost can use the force
of the incoming iceberg to break it apart rather than absorb the force
(Bridging the Bering Strait). [The bridge would also have to withstand
earthquakes]{.underline}, as the Bering Strait is located near the
northern tip of the infamous Pacific Ring of Fire -- [a union of two
aggressive tectonic plates responsible for thousands of volcanic
eruptions]{.underline} including those that created the Hawaiian
islands. A way to add strength and endurance to the bridge or tunnel so
that it could withstand earthquakes up to 7 on the Richter scale would
be to use prestressed concrete in its creation. While it can withstand
massive compression forces (pushing together), standard [concrete easily
cracks under tension forces]{.underline} (pulling apart). Prestressing
concrete is the process of stretching steel rods, setting concrete
around the rods, and then releasing the rods once the concrete is set so
the rods compress. It is a similar concept to the idea that if you hold
a stack of books vertically and apply enough inwards force on both ends,
you can flip the stack horizontally and none will fall. This process
gives the material the compression strength of concrete and tensile
strength of steel ("Prestressed Concrete"). In this scenario,
prestressed concrete will allow the flexibility for the bridge to expand
and condense without forming cracks as the temperature changes from
upwards of 10 degrees Celsius in the summer to -16.7 degrees Celsius in
the winter. The project is estimated to cost about \$12 billion for the
crossing, and \$60 billion in total when all surrounding infrastructure
is created. However, it is estimated that a railway across the Bering
Strait could carry 3% of global freight and produce \$7 billion in
profits each year, which could see the crossing paying back its
investment in under a decade. Additionally, the shipping of oil across
the Bering Strait through pipes within the tunnel or bridge could see
additional profits. [The biggest question resides in who would pay for
the crossing, as it would require the cooperation of Russia, China, USA,
three superpowers that have aroused tensions in recent
years.]{.underline} It is important to [stress the current unlikelihood
of a Bering Strait Crossing in near decades. Despite the potential
benefits]{.underline} of intercontinental trade and peace, [the vast
costs and possible failure of the project deter the support of the
majority of American voters]{.underline}. A [Russian-born American
businessman]{.underline}, Fyodor Soloview, once [described himself and
Dr. Hal Cooper (]{.underline}PhD in Chemical Engineering), two
proponents of a Bering Strait Crossing, [as "last two men standing
\[]{.underline}on this issue\] in North America at the moment" (Shirk,
2015). As of now, [there is no clear scientific consensus on if this
project would 1 Succeed and 2. Provide sufficient benefits to compel its
creation]{.underline}. However, it is important for citizens of the
world to not forget about infrastructure projects as such while shifting
towards the digital age.

#### The project fails -- insane infrastructure, high costs, shipping more economical, and bad relations between US and Eurasia

Constructing the China-Russia-Canada-America railway line could provide
capacity for up to 100 million tons of freight, or 8 per cent of world
freight cargo each year between Europe, Russia, China, Japan, South
Korea, Canada and the USA. Moreover, it would enable passengers to
travel between the USA and Russia in just a little over 20 minutes if
high-speed trains would run on the network. It is also dubbed the Global
Land Bridge, as it would connect the world, advocate those proposing the
project. However, it is [not surprising that]{.underline} the
[majority]{.underline} of the RailFreight readers [voted with little
confidence in the project]{.underline} (56%). Technically, [the project
is very challenging,]{.underline} the [costs are sky-high,]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} maybe most importantly, [the political relations
between the USA, Russia and China are not]{.underline} at
[the]{.underline} very [best]{.underline}. What is more, [it is not
entirely clear who is to construct the tunnel, as various parties seem
to have their respective ambitions. Technically, the
crossover]{.underline} at the Bering Strait [is the most challenging
task]{.underline}. If an underwater tunnel were constructed here, it
would be the longest in the world, extending over 103km. In comparison,
the Channel Tunnel, currently the world's longest, is 50km long.
InterBering, an Alaska-based company, seems to be actively working on
the project. The project would actually involve constructing three
parallel tunnels under the Bering Strait, along with sections of railway
linking to the rail systems on each of the two continents. InterBering
writes. "Two tunnels would accommodate two-way traffic and consist of
two levels: the bottom part for slower-moving cargo and passenger
traffic, and an upper level for high-speed rail trains. The third tunnel
would function as an emergency tunnel and be placed in the middle."
InterBering says to "integrate information and management processes with
particular focus on the organisation, financing and construction of an
interhemispheric Bering Strait tunnel and joining the railways of two
continents, North America and Asia". According to the company, the
[project would take 12-15 years, at an estimated 35 billion US Dollars
cost. However, that includes the underwater link alone]{.underline}. To
make this a global land bridge connecting China and the USA, [new
infrastructure needs to be laid, as there are currently many missing
links.]{.underline} [On the Russian side, the closest terminus lies
3,000km away, while in Alaska, the project would require some 1,200km of
new rail line.]{.underline} What makes things more complicated is that
[Russian and American railways use different track gauges]{.underline},
writes Ed Peters in the South China Morning Post. It is [this missing
infrastructure that makes the project a huge financial
challenge]{.underline}. The [estimated]{.underline} [total costs are
around 200 billion US Dollars]{.underline}, which according to the
critics, is out of proportion. [As the shipping routes already exist, it
is more viable to continue shipping by ocean,]{.underline} is the
often-heard argument of opponents. [Although Interbering claims to
"actively bring about a historic agreement between]{.underline} the
Governors of the State of Alaska ([USA]{.underline}) [and]{.underline}
Chukotka Autonomous Okrug ([Russia]{.underline}), making this proposed
rail tunnel a future reality, [China seems to be on a completely
different page.]{.underline} As mentioned, [China announced]{.underline}
its [plans]{.underline} to build the China-Russia-Canada-America line
[in 2014.]{.underline} At the time, [engineers from China claimed to be
in talks with Russia about beginning the line.]{.underline} Moreover,
[it currently realises the world's first underwater bullet
train]{.underline}, which would extend from Ningbo, a port city near
Shanghai, to Zhoushan, an archipelago of islands off the East coast.
[Many consider this a test project to see whether they could realise the
longer Bering Strait Tunnel.]{.underline} The Ningbo-Zhoushan tunnel is
77km long, of which 16.2km is situated underwater. Although the
underwater section is shorter than the Channel Tunnel, the novelty is
that it will facilitate high-speed rail traffic. To be precise, it will
have a Maglev train, levitating above a magnetic track as it is
propelled along at high speeds. And [this is not a dream project, as it
is already underway. China and Russia are not unlikely to cooperate in
this project]{.underline}. After all, t[hey already share the longest
railway line in the world: the Trans-Siberia Line. The two countries
have worked together very closely over the past few years to form a
bridge between Europe and Asia, and a railway line to the USA would be
an extension of this effort. However]{.underline}, the [willingness of
the USA to work with Russia and China]{.underline} on this megaproject
[is less likely]{.underline}. Currently, the [relationship between the
USA and Russia is not at its best, and as China is taking
over]{.underline} as the dominant economic player in the world, [the USA
may not be so eager to facilitate this growth.]{.underline} At the same
time, the benefits will be for all the countries involved. "The Bering
Strait rail and tunnel project can help enhance and expand prosperity
for the 21st Century by linking the world's greatest industrial nations
with the vast untapped mineral resources of the Arctic", said Alaska's
Governor Wally Hickel. [To realise the project, the countries involved
will all have to chip in and contribute. Before consensus is reached and
funding is made available from all sides, the
China-Russia-Canada-America line is likely to remain a dream
project.]{.underline}

An [ambitious plan to build a 1,600-mile railroad that would link the
Alaskan and Canadian rail systems is on hold and appears to be in
jeopardy. A year ago]{.underline}, former Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell
and other [state leaders were gushing with enthusiasm over the Alaska to
Alberta Railway's plan to build a railroad]{.underline} from northern
Alberta to the eastern Interior of Alaska to transport raw materials
like minerals or bitumen for export. "We're hoping to begin formal
permitting with the environmental impact statement process sometime
either late this year or early next," Treadwell said in an interview
last September. [But now it's hard to find any of that initial
enthusiasm. Treadwell, the project's vice chair, isn't talking publicly
about the \$17 billion project]{.underline}. Also, [the chairman of the
Calgary-based railway company has left,]{.underline} along with other
top executives, [after he was accused of financial
improprieties.]{.underline} Meanwhile, those still with the company are
seeking to protect it from creditors to avoid liquidation while they try
to sell it or refinance the project. And [the main lender for the
proposed railway is in court-ordered receivership while authorities
investigate it over allegations of financial wrongdoing.]{.underline}
All of which has left Alaska Railroad President and CEO Bill O'Leary
wondering about the future of the project. "It certainly appears to be a
tough situation at this point," he said, "and I think most of their
efforts are going towards trying to figure out what their next steps
are." O'Leary said in a recent interview that he's still supports the
idea of an Alaska-Canada railway that would link up with the Alaska
Railroad. It's a concept that's been proposed several times over the
years, and he says the Alaska to Alberta Railway's proposal is the most
promising he's seen. Now, however, he's [uncertain about its
future.]{.underline} "But, at this point, I'm not sure I have any -- I
know I have no -- inside information on how this is going to all play
out," he said. Fairbanks Economic Development Corporation President and
CEO Jim Dodson also strongly supports of the project. But he says he,
too, is now worried whether it'll come to fruition. "[Quite a boondoggle
over the financing of the project," he said. "Whether the guy that owns
it is in financial trouble, or it's an institution that's in financial
trouble ..." The guy who owns it]{.underline} is Winnipeg businessman
Sean McCoshen. And evidence uncovered by investigators suggests he [and
the lender]{.underline}, Bridging Finance, both [are]{.underline}
[indeed in trouble]{.underline}. The CBC reports that an
[investigation]{.underline} by the Ontario Securities Commission [has
found many financial "irregularities"]{.underline} between McCoshen and
Bridging Finance. And according to the Toronto Globe and Mail, [millions
of dollars from the lender intended for the rail project have instead
been transferred into]{.underline} McCoshen's [personal bank
account]{.underline}. His name now no longer appears on the A2A company
website, and the Globe and Mail [says he hasn't been seen for more than
two months now. "I honestly don't know if we should still be
hopeful,]{.underline}" Dodson said. He says he's trying to reserve
judgement about the company and its ability to build the A2A Railway.
But he adds that [it's hard to remain enthusiastic,]{.underline}
especially [because the company has failed to provide any information
about the project since it sent out a news release three weeks ago
announcing its bankruptcy]{.underline} and the lender's receivership.
"There's been no additional clarity offered, that I know of," Dodson
said. Some clarity may come from an Alberta judge's decision on Monday
to appoint an interim receiver and authorize it to take control of the
Alaska to Alberta Railway and manage its operations and assets. A person
who's knowledgeable about the issue who spoke on background says the
judge's action should clear the way for selling the company or
refinancing the project.
