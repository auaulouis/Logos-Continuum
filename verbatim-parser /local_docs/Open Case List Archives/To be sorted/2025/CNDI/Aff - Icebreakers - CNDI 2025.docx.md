# Icebreakers Aff

## Notes

Background for the aff: global warming means that different shipping
lanes and resource deposits are opening up from melt, and "icebreaker"
ships that can break through sheets of ice on the surface of waterways.
Right now Russia has more icebreakers than anyone else, which gives it
several strategic advantages in accessing resources, utilizing shorter
shipping lanes, and controlling territory in the event of conflict. The
plan has us make/use more Icebreakers to close this gap.

The security advantage is like the conflict advantage on the military
aff. It says that Russia is building up its military might and becoming
more aggressive in the Arctic now and that the plan is key to prevent
Russia and China from having unchecked dominance in the area.

The research advantage says icebreakers are key to several fields of
research. Scenario 1 is climate change: icebreakers give us more data
about climate change, and it also increases our science diplomacy which
helps efforts to solve warming. Scenario 2 is disease: research gives us
more information about potential hibernating "'zombie viruses" and how
to combat them, and science diplomacy is key to the cooperation
necessary to solve a pandemic should one occur.

[[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, once a frozen frontier largely
ignored by global powers, [has [emerged as]{.mark} a geopolitical
**[hotspot]{.mark}** in the 21st century.]{.underline} Climate change
has melted vast swathes of polar ice, unveiling [**new** [**shipping**
routes]{.mark}]{.underline}, untapped [natural
**[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [**[strategic
opportunities]{.mark}**. At [the]{.mark} **heart**]{.underline} of this
transformation lies a seemingly mundane yet increasingly [**[critical
tool:]{.mark} the [icebreaker]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} These specialized
vessels]{.underline}, capable of smashing through thick ice to clear
paths for navigation, [have become symbols of **national power**,
sovereignty, and ambition]{.underline} in the Arctic. [[Nations]{.mark}
like Russia, China, Canada, Finland, and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[are **racing** to bolster their]{.mark}
icebreaker [fleets]{.mark}]{.underline}, driven by a mix of economic
interests, security concerns, and territorial claims. This article
explores how [icebreakers have evolved from utilitarian ships into
**pivotal** instruments of geopolitics, with a focus on Arctic
sovereignty and exploration]{.underline}, and provides background on the
fleets and future plans of these key players.

The Arctic's New Geopolitical Frontier

[The Arctic Circle]{.underline}, encompassing the Arctic Ocean and the
northern reaches of eight countries, [holds [immense
potential]{.mark}.]{.underline} The U.S. Geological [Survey estimates it
contains 90 billion barrels of **oil**, 1,669 trillion cubic feet of
natural **gas,** and vast]{.underline} deposits of
**[r]{.underline}**are **[e]{.underline}**arth
**[m]{.underline}**ineral**[s]{.underline}**---resources [worth
**trillions**]{.underline} of dollars. Meanwhile, melting ice has opened
up the Northern Sea Route [(NSR)]{.underline} along Russia's coast and
the Northwest Passage through Canada's archipelago, [promising **shorter
shipping** lanes between Asia, Europe, and North America. These
developments [have turned]{.mark} the [Arctic into a stage for **great
power competition**]{.mark}, where presence and capability are
paramount.]{.underline}

[[Icebreakers are the **backbone**]{.mark} of this contest. [They
enable]{.mark} year-round [access to]{.mark} icy waters]{.underline},
support **[[scientific research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, facilitate
**[[resource extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and project **[[military
power.]{.underline}]{.mark}** For Arctic nations, [they are tools of
sovereignty, ensuring control over territorial waters and]{.underline}
exclusive economic zones **[(EEZs).]{.underline}** For non-Arctic states
like China, they represent a foothold in a region far from their shores.
As the ice recedes, [[the ability to operate in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}---particularly during the harsh winter
months---[has made icebreakers a [barometer of national strength]{.mark}
and intent.]{.underline}

Russia: The Icebreaker Titan

[[Russia **dominates** the]{.mark} Arctic [icebreaker
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} boasting the world's largest
and most capable fleet. With over 40 operational icebreakers, including
seven nuclear-powered giants, Moscow has leveraged its Soviet-era legacy
to maintain a commanding presence in the region. [The
**N**]{.underline}orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea **[R]{.underline}**oute,
stretching along Russia's 24,000-kilometer Arctic coastline, [is a
cornerstone of its strategy.]{.underline} Russia views the NSR as both
[a commercial artery---potentially slashing shipping times between
Europe and Asia by 40%---and a national security priority.]{.underline}

The jewel of Russia's fleet is the Arktika-class nuclear icebreakers
under Project 22220. The lead ship, Arktika, began sea trials in 2019,
followed by Sibir and Ural, with Yakutia and Chukotka under
construction. These behemoths, capable of breaking ice up to 3 meters
thick, dwarf most competitors in size and power. Russia aims to have 13
heavy-duty icebreakers by 2035, reinforcing its dominance. Additionally,
[[it has]{.mark} introduced **[combat icebreakers]{.mark}** like the
Ivan Papanin, armed with missiles, signaling [a **militarized**
approach]{.mark} to Arctic control.]{.underline} Backed by 17 deep-water
ports and a network of renovated Cold War-era bases, Russia's icebreaker
fleet underpins its claim as the Arctic's preeminent power.

China: The "Near-Arctic" Challenger

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite lacking Arctic territory,
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} boldly declared itself a "near-Arctic state"
since its 2018 Arctic Policy white paper. Its interest stems from [[the
**Polar Silk Road**,]{.mark} an extension of the **B**]{.underline}elt
and **[R]{.underline}**oad **[I]{.underline}**nitiative, which envisions
Arctic shipping routes as a shortcut for its trade with Europe. Beijing
also eyes the region's resources [to **fuel** its industrial
economy.]{.underline} Though its icebreaker fleet is modest compared to
Russia's, China is rapidly expanding its capabilities.

China operates three icebreakers: Xue Long (Snow Dragon), a converted
Ukrainian cargo ship acquired in 1994; Xue Long 2, a domestically built
vessel launched in 2019 with Finnish design input; and Jidi, a
next-generation icebreaker unveiled in 2024. A fourth, a heavy polar
icebreaker with a 26,000-ton displacement, is in development, with plans
for nuclear propulsion---a technology only Russia currently masters. In
summer 2024, China made headlines by deploying all three icebreakers to
the Arctic simultaneously, operating near Alaska alongside Russian
vessels, a move that alarmed U.S. officials. [This growing presence,
coupled with seabed mapping and intelligence-gathering activities,
[underscores]{.mark} China's [ambition to become a **polar
player**]{.mark}]{.underline}, challenging Arctic nations' dominance.

Canada: Defending the Northwest Passage

Canada's Arctic sovereignty hinges on the Northwest Passage, a
historically ice-choked route through its northern archipelago. Ottawa
claims these waters as internal, subject to its full control, a stance
contested by the United States, which views them as an international
strait. Icebreakers are critical for Canada to assert its authority,
support Indigenous communities, and protect its EEZ, which holds
significant oil and gas reserves.

The Canadian Coast Guard operates nine icebreakers, including two heavy
vessels (\*CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent\* and CCGS Terry Fox) and seven
medium ones. However, many are aging, with Louis S. St-Laurent,
commissioned in 1969, nearing retirement. Canada's National Shipbuilding
Strategy includes plans for new icebreakers, such as the John G.
Diefenbaker, a polar-class vessel slated for delivery in the early
2030s, though delays and cost overruns have plagued the program. The
2024 ICE Pact with the U.S. and Finland aims to accelerate construction,
leveraging Canadian shipyards like Davie, which acquired Finland's
Helsinki Shipyard in 2023. Canada's fleet renewal is both a practical
necessity and a geopolitical statement, reinforcing its Arctic claims
against Russian and Chinese encroachment.

Finland: The Icebreaker Superpower

Finland, though not a major Arctic power in territorial terms, is a
global leader in icebreaker design and construction. With 80% of the
world's icebreakers designed and 60% built by Finnish firms, its
expertise is unrivaled. This stems from necessity: Finland's Baltic Sea
ports freeze annually, requiring icebreakers to keep trade flowing,
which accounts for over 90% of its commerce. The state-owned Arctia Ltd.
manages a fleet of eight to twelve icebreakers (estimates vary due to
classification differences), including the innovative Polaris, launched
in 2017, which uses LNG for cleaner operation.

Finland's role in the ICE Pact, signed in July 2024 with the U.S. and
Canada, positions it as a linchpin in Western Arctic strategy. Finnish
shipyards can deliver polar-class vessels in 24 months at a fraction of
U.S. costs, offering a cost-effective solution to allies. The pact aims
to produce 70--90 icebreakers over the next decade, boosting Finland's
economy while countering Russia's fleet advantage. Finland's NATO
membership, formalized in 2023, further aligns its icebreaking prowess
with Western security goals, making it a quiet but critical player in
Arctic geopolitics.

The United States: Playing Catch-Up

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, an
Arctic nation via Alaska, [**lags** far behind its rivals. The U.S.
Coast Guard [operates]{.mark} just [two]{.mark} aging icebreakers: Polar
Star]{.underline}, commissioned in 1976 and overdue for retirement, and
Healy, a medium icebreaker sidelined in 2024 by an electrical fire. A
third, Polar Sea, is inactive and being cannibalized for parts. This
paltry fleet contrasts starkly with Russia's dozens and China's growing
numbers, [[leaving the U.S. reliant on]{.underline}]{.mark} allies like
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Arctic access---**[a vulnerability
in an era of heightened competition]{.underline}**.

The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program aims to build six to nine new
icebreakers, with the first, Polar Sentinel, now delayed to 2030 due to
cost overruns (estimated at \$10 billion total) and design challenges.
In December 2024, the Coast Guard acquired Aiviq, a former oil
exploration vessel, as an interim solution, to be based in Juneau,
Alaska. The ICE Pact represents a strategic pivot, tapping Finnish and
Canadian expertise to scale up production. U.S. leaders, from President
Trump in 2020 to Admiral Linda Fagan in 2024, have emphasized
icebreakers as vital for sovereignty, security, and countering Russian
and Chinese advances. Yet, with only one heavy icebreaker operational
today, the U.S. faces a steep climb to reclaim Arctic relevance.

The Future of Icebreaker Geopolitics

Icebreakers have transcended their traditional roles, becoming chess
pieces in a high-stakes Arctic game. Russia's fleet ensures its
dominance along the NSR, while China's expansion signals broader polar
ambitions. Canada and the U.S., spurred by the ICE Pact, are racing to
close the gap, with Finland providing the industrial backbone. Projected
construction---Russia's 13 heavy icebreakers by 2035, China's nuclear
aspirations, and the West's 70--90 new vessels---foreshadows an
intensifying contest.

Beyond numbers, [the **[militarization]{.mark}** of
icebreakers]{.underline}, as seen in Russia's combat variants,
[[raises]{.mark} the **[specter of conflict]{.mark}** over shipping
lanes and resources. **[Sovereignty disputes]{.mark}**]{.underline},
like Canada's over the Northwest Passage, [[could
**escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark} as ice recedes and traffic grows.
Meanwhile, [exploration]{.underline}---scientific and economic---[relies
on [icebreakers]{.mark} to **[unlock]{.mark}** the Arctic's secrets and
**[wealth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, making them indispensable to national
strategies. In this frozen frontier, [icebreakers are not just breaking
ice; they're **[breaking]{.mark}** new [**ground** in **global
power**]{.mark} dynamics.]{.underline}

#### Development is [inevitable]{.underline} and the [lynchpin]{.underline} of arctic dominance, but the US needs to expand the [speed]{.underline} and [scope]{.underline} of development.

Them,"
https://www.wsj.com/world/trumps-arctic-goals-demand-icebreakers-but-u-s-struggles-to-build-them-e13a33b9\]

At 13,000 tons, the U.S. Coast Guard's Polar Star is a mammoth vessel
made to crash through Arctic ice more than 20 feet thick. But it is the
U.S.'s only icebreaker that operates year-round, and it was built nearly
half a century ago.

In the intensifying global race to access the Arctic,
[[icebreakers]{.mark} are the **[essential]{.mark}** tool [to]{.mark}
open **[trade]{.mark}**]{.underline} routes, [allow [**resource
extraction** and]{.mark} project [**military power**.]{.mark} The
[U.S.]{.mark} and its allies have **[fallen]{.mark}** far
**[behind]{.mark}** Russia, and China is rapidly gaining
ground]{.underline} with the help of the world's largest shipbuilding
industry.

President [[Trump]{.mark} has **[signaled]{.mark}** that he wants [to
put]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} back [at]{.mark} the [**top** of]{.mark}
the U.S.'s priority [list]{.mark}.]{.underline} [He has
said]{.underline} the U.S. needs to take ownership of Greenland for
national security and that the [[Coast Guard will expand]{.mark} its
[fleet]{.mark} of icebreakers.]{.underline}

[["We're going to order]{.mark} about **[40]{.mark}** Coast Guard big
icebreakers. Big ones,"]{.underline} Trump said last month.

[That will be **[a tall order]{.mark}** to fill. The [U.S. has been
**struggling**]{.mark}]{.underline} for years to build a single
icebreaker---vessels that clear a path through the ice for other ships.
Even if Trump is able to marshal the political will and money to build
more, [the [U.S. will have to **breathe life back** into]{.mark} its
ailing [shipbuilding]{.mark} industr]{.underline}y, which has been in
decline for decades.

[Russia]{.underline}, meanwhile, [has]{.underline} around [40
icebreakers capable of operating in polar conditions, as well as new
giant nuclear-powered ones]{.underline} under construction. Despite
being 900 miles from the Arctic Circle, [China has four such
vessels.]{.underline} Its first domestically built nuclear-powered
icebreaker could be unveiled as soon as this year, experts say.

[[Russia]{.mark} has [faced setbacks]{.mark} in recent
years.]{.underline} Sanctions over the Ukraine war have limited its
access to components and technologies needed to build icebreakers, such
as propulsion systems and radar equipment. A nuclear-powered icebreaker
under construction called Rossiya is running three years behind
schedule. [[But]{.mark} it already [has a **massive lead**]{.mark}
and]{.underline} years of [experience operating in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

As in other areas, Russia is tapping China's investment and
technological support, potentially fueling Beijing's increased interest
in the polar regions. It took a Chinese shipyard two years to deliver
one recent icebreaker. Though the U.S.'s new icebreaker will be a
heavier ice-breaking class than the Chinese vessel, construction started
only recently, five years after the contract was awarded to build it.

Cutting through thick Arctic ice

[[Icebreakers are]{.mark} seen as **[indispensable]{.mark}** for
maintaining a presence in the Arctic.]{.underline} Even as global
temperatures warm and open up shipping lanes, [the region remains
largely impenetrable for ships in all but one or two summer
month]{.underline}s---unless accompanied by a Polar class icebreaker.

Greenland, the world's largest island, is still treacherous to
circumnavigate by ship because of the ice conditions. The island has one
of the world's largest undeveloped zinc deposits in its far north, but
the fjord where it is located is icebound almost all of the year.

["We can't access the region and we can't have a presence without
icebreakers,"]{.underline} said Shannon Jenkins, a senior Arctic policy
adviser at the U.S. Coast Guard, which operates U.S. icebreakers.

Icebreakers are classified based on the thickness of the ice they can
handle, with [Polar-class ships built for the thickest ice. [Russia has
**seven** of the heaviest]{.mark} class of Polar icebreakers. The [U.S.
and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark} [have]{.mark} a combined
**[three]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with an average age of 46 years,
according to consulting firm Arctic Marine Solutions.

Polar icebreakers are shaped in a way that allows them to push their
bows up onto the ice and break it with the ship's weight. The broken ice
generally folds under adjacent solid ice, leaving a path of clear water
in the ship's wake.

Icebreakers have reinforced hulls that add weight to the ships, and
powerful engines. While conventional ships usually give priority to fuel
efficiency over raw power, that math doesn't work for icebreakers, which
need to generate greater force to break through the ice.

The U.S.'s Polar Star, which was commissioned in 1976, is nearly 20
years beyond its designed service life, according to a Congressional
Budget Office report last year. The U.S.'s second icebreaker, the Healy,
commissioned in 1999, is less powerful, with half the horsepower of the
heavy icebreaker.

Canada, which has around 100,000 miles of Arctic coastline, has two
Polar-class vessels and two under construction. Over the past decade,
they have also built five Arctic and offshore patrol ships---armed
vessels that can plow through ice.

European nations including Finland, Sweden, the U.K. and Germany---all
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization---have a further 13
icebreakers capable of working in the Arctic, according to some of those
countries and the Arctic Institute, a think tank.

The U.S. battle to build an icebreaker

Polar icebreakers are expensive and complex, and the U.S. hasn't built
one since the Polar Star. The U.S. awarded a contract to build a new
heavy icebreaker, the Polar Sentinel, in 2019. The first of three new
planned ice breakers, it isn't expected to be finished until after 2030.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost for the three
ships will reach \$5.1 billion, 60% higher than original projections.

The U.S. icebreaker program has fallen so far behind Russia partly
because the Arctic faded as a U.S. priority after the Cold War. That
began to change around a decade ago, said Rebecca Pincus, director of
the Polar Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington-based think tank.

[But [momentum]{.mark} on building icebreakers [has been hampered
by]{.mark} the Coast Guard's small [**budgets** and]{.mark} lack of
**[political power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, said Pincus, who has worked
on Arctic policy at the Coast Guard and the Defense Department. The
Coast Guard has moved from department to department before most recently
becoming a part of Homeland Security.

#### Icebreaker dominance lets Russia [circumvent]{.underline} the oil price cap and limit US maneuverability.

"Confronting America's Polar Icebreaker Gap,"
https://www.thefai.org/posts/confronting-america-s-polar-icebreaker-gap\]

The [[Arctic is]{.underline}]{.mark} no longer just a frozen
expanse---it is quickly becoming [[a]{.mark} geopolitical
**[hotspot]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As its ice diminishes, its [[economic
potentia]{.mark}l has increased. Arctic [shipping]{.mark}
routes]{.underline} between the Atlantic and Pacific [offer the
potential to [reduce travel]{.mark} times by up to 40%,]{.underline} and
the area is estimated to [[contain]{.mark} 13% of the world's
undiscovered [oil and]{.mark} 30% of its untapped natural [gas]{.mark}
reserves]{.underline}. However, far less attention has been given to
what is required for successful U.S. deterrence in the Arctic,
particularly in countering Russia's assertiveness.

The Arctic is particularly valuable for America's competitors. [[Russia
has used the]{.underline}]{.mark} Northern Sea Route [[(NSR) to
bypass]{.mark} the West\'s \$60-per-barrel [oil price
cap]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2023, [a record 80% of Russian oil exports
were shipped via non-G7 tankers, avoiding the cap]{.underline}, with
exports to China rising by 23% since the invasion of Ukraine. [Oil
[shipments]{.mark} along the NSR have also
**[surged]{.mark}**]{.underline}, growing from zero before the war to
over ten in 2023. Given the Arctic\'s strategic economic and military
importance, [the [U.S. must]{.mark} **[bolster]{.mark}** its
**[infrastructure]{.mark}** and military capabilities for successful
deterrence]{.underline}, which it currently lacks.

During his testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier
this year, General Gregory M. Guillot, the Commander of the U.S.
Northern Command (USNORTHCOM), warned that ["[we're]{.mark} severely
[**outnumbered**" and]{.mark} have [**limited** "freedom of
maneuver"]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic. The numbers concerning
**[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [are [**crucial**
for]{.mark} enabling [naval forces to **navigate**]{.mark} ice-covered
waters, are particularly stark.]{.underline} Compared to Russia's seven
nuclear-powered and thirty diesel-powered icebreakers, [the U.S.
operates only two diesel-powered icebreakers.]{.underline} Since the
Polar Sea, one of the U.S.'s two heavy polar icebreakers, suffered an
engine casualty in 2010, the Coast Guard has relied on the Polar Star as
its sole operational heavy icebreaker.

Meanwhile, [[Russia]{.mark} continues to **[expand]{.mark}** its
icebreaker [fleet]{.mark} to **[reinforce]{.mark}** its regional
**[dominance]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Through its Project 22220
initiative, [[Russia]{.mark} is [developing]{.mark} at least six
**[nuclear]{.mark}**-powered [icebreakers]{.mark}:]{.underline} three
already built, a fourth under construction, and two more in development.
Decades of sustained investment have given Russia a commanding presence
in the Arctic---one that the U.S. is currently unprepared to counter.

[[**Delays** and]{.mark} rising **[costs]{.mark}** have [beset efforts
to modernize]{.mark} its Arctic icebreaker fleet.]{.underline} The Polar
Security Cutter (PSC) program won't deliver its first icebreaker ready
until 2029. Unresolved design issues and rising material and labor costs
have increased the price of the first three ships by 39 percent. As a
result, the Coast Guard must spend \$15 million per year to repair the
aging Polar Star, which first entered service in 1976. The U.S. Coast
Guard assessed that [[America needs]{.mark} at least [eight]{.mark}
icebreakers]{.underline} -- four heavy and four medium ships --
[[for]{.mark} its future polar [missions. Without]{.mark} a [**shift**
in Arctic policy]{.mark}, the [U.S]{.mark}. and its allies may
[**struggle** to counter Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}'s [increasing
influence.]{.underline}

#### Enforcing the price cap is key to limit Russian oil revenues that sustain expansion into Ukraine. 

**Brooks '24** \[Robin and Ben Harris; June 26; senior fellow in the
Global Economy and Development program at the Brookings Institution, PhD
in Economics at Yale; vice president and director of Economic Studies at
the Brookings Institution, PhD in Economics at George Washington
University; Brookings, "Why the US should sanction more Russian
tankers,"
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-the-us-should-sanction-more-russian-tankers/\]

The [**[price cap]{.mark}** was established]{.underline} with the [dual
goals of [limit]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [[Russian profits]{.mark} from
the trade of crude oil]{.underline} and refined products [[while]{.mark}
also [maintaining **stability**]{.mark} in global energy
markets.]{.underline} The central approach established by the price cap
coalition (the G7, plus the European Union and Australia) was to
disallow the provision of services in trades that exceeded the maximum
allowable price of each product. The primary lever utilized by the
coalition was the sanctioning of service providers who violated these
terms, with a broad range of services subject to the cap, including
shipping, insurance, brokering, flagging, and financing.

The [**[success]{.mark}** of the price cap [was]{.mark}]{.underline}
most pronounced in the early stages of its implementation, especially in
terms of [**[limiting]{.mark}** trading **[profits]{.mark}** accruing to
Russia.]{.underline} In terms of export volumes, Russia's seaborne
exports of crude oil and refined product have been stable near six
million barrels per day since December 2022, so a key goal of the price
cap---to ensure the continued flow of Russian oil to global
markets---has been met. Simultaneously, the composition of its exports
has shifted away from advanced economies---which now import near
zero---to emerging markets, where China, India and Turkey have emerged
as large buyers. Despite drastic reshuffling of its export destinations,
export volumes have remained largely stable since the invasion of
Ukraine---and have even increased on the margin prior to recent
voluntary cutbacks to meet OPEC+ production quotas. Price stability has
accompanied global production stability, which is somewhat remarkable
when contrasted against geopolitical turmoil in oil production-relevant
regions.

With export volumes stable, [Russia's [oil tax revenues---**critical**
to fund]{.mark} its [war in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}---have
[[fluctuated]{.underline}]{.mark} with the price of Urals (Figure 2). In
the months before and after the pre-announced implementation of the
[[price cap]{.underline}]{.mark} in December 2022, Russian
[[revenues]{.underline}]{.mark} remained
**[[depressed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to the U.S. Treasury
Department, [Russian oil tax [revenues fell]{.mark} by **[40%]{.mark}**
over the first nine months of]{.underline} 2023 compared to one year
earlier, while analysis from the Atlantic Council put the monthly
revenue loss at around \$5 billion through the first ten months of the
cap. However, as the price of Urals has risen over the past year, so
have Russia's tax revenues on oil, a key challenge for the coalition of
countries behind the price cap. Notable, too, is the closing of the
Brent-Urals spread, suggesting that Russia has devised strategies for
circumventing the price cap.

The closing of the Brent-Urals spread has been enabled by Russian
countermeasures to circumvent the price cap, namely the cultivation of
an expanded shadow fleet of aging tankers, often covered by inferior
insurance provided by the Russian company Ingosstrakh. The expanded
[[shadow fleet has allowed Russia to blunt the]{.mark} price
[impact]{.mark}]{.underline} of compliant service providers by shifting
away from Western-provided services, which simultaneously reduces the
leverage of non-Western trading partners like China. While the expanded
shadow fleet ultimately means more oil revenue for Russia, the gain is
somewhat offset by increased expenditures for obtaining the shadow fleet
and higher trading costs---namely increased insurance fees. That being
said, [the key point is that **[limiting]{.mark}** the scope of
[the]{.mark} [shadow fleet is **central** to]{.mark} preserving the
continued **[success]{.mark}** of the price cap.]{.underline}

#### Ukraine's defeat is [existential]{.underline}. 

Peter **Dickinson '23**. Fellow at the Atlantic Council's Eurasian
Center. \"Arming Ukraine is cheap compared to the far higher price of
Russian victory\". Atlantic Council. 10-26-2023.

McConnell's arguments are certainly persuasive. However, in order to
fully appreciate the true value of continued support for Ukraine, [it is
necessary to contemplate what would happen [if **Western**]{.mark}
military [**aid** came to an end]{.mark} and Vladimir **Putin**
**succeeded** in **subjugating** the country.]{.underline}

The most immediate costs of a Russian victory would be felt by the
Ukrainian population, of course. With much or all of Ukraine under
Russian control, the war crimes already witnessed in occupied areas of
the country would multiply. Tens of thousands would be executed or
imprisoned, while millions would be subjected to forced deportation.
[These horrors would create **major humanitarian challenges** for the
wider **European community**, with a **[massive new wave]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **Ukrainian [refugees]{.mark}** [flooding]{.mark} across the
**border** into [the **EU**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Vindicated]{.underline} **[and [emboldened]{.mark} by victory in
Ukraine]{.underline}**, [[Putin]{.mark} would]{.underline} almost
certainly seek to go further. The Russian dictator has already made
clear that he sees the reconquest of Ukraine as part of a broader
mission to correct the perceived injustice of the Soviet collapse and
the fall of "historical Russia." [His next [targets would]{.mark} most
likely [be]{.mark} **[Moldova]{.mark}**, **[Armenia]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} the countries of **[Central Asia]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[If the West proves unwilling or unable to stop Russia in **Ukraine**,
there will be [little to **deter**]{.mark} **further aggression**
against **smaller** and more [**vulnerable** former Soviet
republics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[With **[NATO discredited]{.mark}**]{.underline} by the fall of Ukraine,
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} [would then be tempted to [test]{.mark} the
**[resolve]{.mark} of the alliance** in a more fundamental manner by
[threatening the Baltic states]{.mark}]{.underline}. Would a demoralized
and divided NATO go to war with a resurgent Russia over an isolated
incident on the Estonian or Latvian border? If not,
**[Putin]{.underline}** [would **exploit this weakness**]{.underline}.
[[Failure to defend]{.mark} the territorial integrity of a **NATO member
state** would [spark]{.mark} the **rapid** [**unraveling of the entire
alliance**,]{.mark} [plunging]{.mark} the whole of [**Europe** into
**chaos**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Even if the worst case scenario of a **[[direct]{.mark} military
[confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[between]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[could be **avoided**,]{.underline} [a Russian victory in Ukraine would
inevitably oblige Western leaders to boost]{.underline} **[defense
spending]{.underline}** to levels not witnessed since the end of the
Cold War. This would require sums far in excess of the money currently
being allocated to Ukraine. Outgoing US Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair
General Mark Milley recently warned that a Russian victory in Ukraine
would lead to a potential "doubling" of defense budgets. Others have
suggested the cost would be much higher, noting the need to establish
and indefinitely maintain a dramatically increased military presence in
Central and Eastern Europe.

While the direct financial and security costs of a Russian victory in
Ukraine are already alarming, [the **geopolitical price** would be even
**greater**]{.underline}. The recent escalation in
**[Israel]{.underline}** [is a direct consequence of the West's
**indecisive response** to]{.underline} Russia's attack on
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. If Putin's invasion is seen to succeed,
[other **[authoritarians]{.mark}** will be [encouraged]{.mark} and
**international [instability]{.mark}** [will **spread even
further**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The entire world will face **[decades
of insecurity]{.mark}** marked by mounting **militarism**, **mutual
suspicion**, and multiplying acts of **international
aggression**]{.underline}. [The opportunity [cost to the]{.mark}
**[global economy]{.mark}** will be **measured** in the **[tens of
trillions]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

None of this is inevitable. On the [contrary, it can **all be avoided**
by providing Ukraine with the tools to defeat Russia]{.underline}. The
Ukrainians are ready and able to do the fighting themselves; all they
ask is for their international partners to stop dithering and deliver
the necessary weapons without delay.

Opponents of continued military [aid]{.underline} to Ukraine often say
it is too expensive. In reality, it [is **infinitely cheaper** than the
**alternative**.]{.underline} They also claim supporting Ukraine risks
provoking **[[World War III]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but in truth,
[nothing is **more [likely]{.mark}** [to **provoke**]{.mark} **Putin**
than **[Western weakness]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

With his genocidal invasion of Ukraine, the [Russian dictator has burned
his last remaining bridges and is now completely **committed to
confrontation** with the **West**]{.underline}. He will not stop until
he is stopped. The longer Western leaders delay, the higher the price
they will pay.

#### Russia and Chinese collaboration and dominance over icebreakers lets them [militarize]{.underline} the arctic.

Russia And China: Dozens Of Ships, Big Ambitions

When the Pentagon presented its new arctic strategy in late July, it
highlighted in detail [[Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}'s interest
in advancing their respective Arctic capabilities as well as the fact
they are frequently leaning on one another to achieve their goals.

"Increasingly, the \[People's Republic of China\] and Russia [[are
**collaborating**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} across multiple
instruments of national power. While significant areas of disagreement
between the PRC and Russia remain, [their growing [alignment]{.mark} in
the region [is of **concern**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and DoD continues to
monitor this cooperation," according to the document. [["Russia's
**isolation**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a result of its full-scale
invasion of Ukraine [has [made it]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly
[[reliant on the PRC for]{.mark} financing energy [export
infrastructure]{.mark} in the Arctic."]{.underline}

The US Coast Guard's data indicates that as of 2020, Russia's fleet was
just a few ships short of the Moscow's recent claim of 41 ships, with
several vessels under construction. Another extensive icebreaker tracker
comes from Aker Arctic, a Finnish shipbuilding firm dating back to the
1930s, which tallied roughly four dozen Russian icebreakers without
considering vessels caught in the gray areas --- capable of breaking ice
but not always used for that purpose.

The ambiguity around what constitutes an "icebreaker" makes comparing
these tallies against one another difficult, but there is a clear
consensus among sources that Russia has prioritized being able to
navigate ice both in polar regions and elsewhere its fleet might be
needed.

[["Russia's icebreaking capacity is significant]{.mark},"]{.underline}
said Salonius-Pasternak. "\[You\] just have to look at the map. They've
of course had many reasons to keep it up," referring to the country's
geolocation and the environments its ships must frequently transit.

And with that in mind, the Pentagon's Arctic strategy warns not to
underestimate the country's ambitions.

"Russia's maritime infrastructure [[could allow it to enforce
**excessive** and **illegal** maritime claims along the]{.mark} Northern
Sea Route ([NSR]{.mark})]{.underline} between the Bering Strait and Kara
Strait," according to the document. "Russia claims the right to regulate
Arctic waters along the NSR in excess of the authority permitted under
the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), placing
excessive requirements on foreign vessels transiting the route and
threatening force against vessels out of compliance with Russian
regulations."

While Russia's geolocation and membership in the Arctic Council, an
international forum for Arctic nations to sort out disagreements, give
it explicit and inherent interest in the High North, Chinese ambitions
and icebreaker shipbuilding is a more complicated issue for Washington.

In 2017, [[China]{.mark} claimed to be a "near-arctic state" and
[has]{.mark} since then [sought to insert itself into]{.mark} the
[governance]{.mark} of both the High North]{.underline} --- a claim the
US has rejected --- as well as the Antarctic, where its claims have
greater credibility on the global stage given its geolocation.

China is known to [[operate]{.underline}]{.mark} at least five
[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, not all of which are capable of
polar navigation, and like other countries, certain ships are owned by
the state while others are managed by universities. (Pentagon officials
contend the line between military and commercial use is less meaningful
in the context of the Chinese because, they say, the state will
frequently and covertly use assets for dual purposes.)

Beijing has also previously [[announced]{.underline}]{.mark} it was
developing a **[[nuclear-powered icebreaker,]{.underline}]{.mark}** but
publicly available details about that ship remain scarce. The country's
opacity makes it difficult to track its ships in detail, even for
veteran observers.

Elizabeth Buchanan, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy
Institute, told Breaking Defense that [China's proclaimed stake in the
arctic stems from its economy and security turning on "the ability to
secure unrestrained sea lines]{.underline} of communication and control
of global trade."

"The emerging [[N]{.underline}]{.mark}orthern [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea
[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}oute, further [[bolstered by partnership with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Far East, North Pacific Ocean and
Russia's Northern Sea Route, [[connect Beijing to
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} in a much more efficient (time and cost
terms) manner," she said. ["**[Militarizing the route]{.mark}** would
further [ensure]{.mark} supply [security]{.mark} [and allow China to
diversify]{.mark} its reliance on the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea for seaborne trade between Asia
and Europe."

She also argued that the United States' speedy rejection of China's
"near-arctic state" claim was "risky" because it allows Beijing to
criticize Washington for not respecting China's rights to the high seas.

[For [the US]{.mark} to secure its own interest in the
arctic]{.underline}, she said, it [[must **invest**]{.mark} in
capabilities [to **"deter**]{.mark} ambitious [Chinese behavior" --- to
include]{.mark}]{.underline}, but not limited to,
**[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. ICE Pact could offer one pathway
to doing that.

#### Russia is revisionist. Arctic militarization is the [cornerstone]{.underline} of its strategy to crack the liberal international order.

In some ways, the Kremlin's focus has paid off. Unlike in other
geopolitical arenas where Moscow faces economic and military
constraints, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} now [enjoys significant
advantages in the Arctic]{.underline}. It [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} the
world's [**[largest]{.mark}** fleet of **[icebreaker]{.mark}**
ships]{.underline}, maintains a [[strong **military**]{.mark}
presence]{.underline} in the region and
**[[controls]{.underline}]{.mark}** more than half of [the Arctic
[coastline.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But Moscow also has significant economic and military insecurities in
the region. Efforts by Western countries in 2022 to isolate Russia from
Arctic cooperation, as well as a more ambitious US, have only fuelled
these anxieties. In response, the Kremlin has doubled down on its Arctic
strategy in both visible and opaque ways, forming what this paper will
call a "policy iceberg". Russia's massive economic investment is the
visible tip; its attempts to create a northern sea trade route buoy at
the waterline with both clear economic and murkier military aims; while
its [[attempts to **militarise**]{.underline}]{.mark} in [the
Arctic]{.underline} are submerged from view---and the most
**[[threaten]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing to [[Western
interests.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In time, [[Moscow hopes]{.mark} the Arctic can become part of its
leverage [to]{.mark} help [renegotiate a **"new world
order".**]{.mark}]{.underline} This strategy involves asserting itself
in the Arctic not only through economic investment and military displays
but also via overt cooperation with China. Meanwhile, [Moscow aims to
[use]{.mark} symbolic concessions in the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
(such as arms control deals, a revived Arctic Council or limits on
non-Arctic state involvement) [[as]{.mark} bargaining [chips for
strategic gains]{.mark}]{.underline} elsewhere, particularly [[in
Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark} This year's negotiations with the US
showed signs of this, with Russia using Arctic cooperation on offshore
resources as a lure to reopen broader talks with the West.

With Putin personally invested in strengthening Russian control over the
Arctic and Trump signalling a prioritisation of the region, the next
major point of European confrontation could be in the Barents or Baltic
seas---not in eastern or central Europe.

In this paper, we examine the new phase of Russia's Arctic policy,
focusing on domestic shifts and external positioning. It seeks to
distinguish the Kremlin's actual priorities from the image it projects
to pressure the West into renewed negotiations over Arctic governance
and Russia's broader geopolitical standing. To do so, we examine how two
core insecurities shape Russia's Arctic policy, analyse their
implementation and explore how they are projected internationally
through legal, diplomatic and bilateral instruments. This paper
concludes with four key recommendations for European policymakers to
mitigate Russia's economic and military ambitions and to avoid getting
squeezed out of an increasingly strategic region.

The cold hotspot

For a long time, European Arctic states were determined to see the
region as a "peaceful zone of cooperation". Before 2022, the main Arctic
issues for Europe were climate change, the environment and sustainable
development. Also on the agenda were new economic opportunities in
shipping routes, energy reserves and rare minerals. But these were not a
priority.

That era has ended. [[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} is no longer a
peripheral concern for European security and strategy---it
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} rapidly becoming [a **[central]{.mark}**
theatre [in the]{.mark} emerging [global order.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Europe is caught between Russia, which sees the Arctic as part of its
broader confrontation with the West; and the US, which under Trump is a
more hostile and transactional Arctic actor. Now
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}'s [strategic interests [**directly
challenge** the EU]{.mark}]{.underline}'s [foreign policy objectives in
the Arctic.]{.underline} Climate policy, defence issues, multilateral
governance and energy security all converge in this one theatre.

Despite these shifts, the EU's Arctic policy is based on a strategic
document that dates back to 2021. This focuses on developing a
"peaceful, sustainable, and prosperous Arctic" and prioritises
environmental issues and scientific cooperation over defenсe and
protecting the security interests of member states. The lag, in turn,
hampers Europeans' ability to respond to what is fast becoming a
geopolitical hotspot.

Meanwhile, non-Arctic states, especially China, are seeking a stake in
the region through partnerships with Russia and long-term infrastructure
investments. This is part of a broader attempt led by Russia to shape an
alternative, illiberal Arctic order that stands in direct contrast to
Europeans' vision. EU and NATO member states control swathes of Arctic
territory, and some have begun developing their military capabilities.
But unless the European Union's tactics change, it still risks being
politically marginalised and strategically outflanked.

Russia's Arctic insecurities

Moscow often frames its foreign and domestic policies as defensive
responses to perceived threats, aiming to protect its national interests
and legitimate its assertiveness. As such, the Kremlin's actions provide
a window into its insecurities. These are particularly acute in the
Arctic, where concerns over nuclear military vulnerabilities and the
capacity to extract Arctic resources have massively influenced Russia's
policy rationale.

Military insecurity

[Russia's [relations]{.mark} with Western countries in the Arctic [have
been entangled in a **"security dilemma"**]{.mark}]{.underline} for over
a decade: actions taken by one state to enhance its security often lead
to countermeasures by others, **[[fuelling]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
cycle of tension and **[[militarisation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Russian expansion causes nuclear war. 

**Fazal '22** \[Tanisha M.; April 6; Professor of Political Science at
the University of Minnesota; Foreign Affairs, "The Return of Conquest?
Why the Future of Global Order Hinges on Ukraine,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/ukraine-russia-war-return-conquest\]

There is reason to fear that [Putin's [ambitions
**go**]{.mark}]{.underline} well **[[beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}** these
goals. As his remarks questioning the legitimacy of
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** as an independent country suggest,
Putin seems [[interested in]{.mark} much **more** than merely putting a
crony in charge of a former Soviet republic or **carving
out**]{.underline} parts of the [country; he]{.underline} may be
[contemplating **[redrawing]{.mark}** the map of **[Europe]{.mark}** to
hark [back to **imperial** Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Russia were
to take over the entirety of Ukraine, Putin would drive a stake into the
heart of the norm against territorial conquest.

If Putin went that far, then the fate of the norm would depend largely
on how the rest of the world reacted. Norms are nourished by
enforcement. In 2013, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad clearly violated
the norm against the use of chemical weapons (and international law)
when he fired sarin-filled rockets at the Damascus suburbs. Even though
U.S. President Barack Obama had declared the use of chemical weapons to
be a redline, the response to this violation was so tepid that one can
be forgiven for asking whether the taboo against chemical weapons still
holds.

Fortunately, much of the world's response to the Russian invasion
indicates that countries are largely united in their determination to
protect the norm. Unprecedented sanctions on Russia, combined with
donations of humanitarian aid and weapons for Ukraine, are applying
pressure on Putin while offering (admittedly limited) relief to
Zelensky. [[If]{.underline}]{.mark} that international [[**resolve**
were to **ebb**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [countries that neighbor
Ukraine, such as [**Moldova**, **Poland**, and **Romania**]{.mark},
would **[rightly]{.mark}** become [nervous]{.mark}]{.underline} about
their sovereignty. Indeed, they already are. It is notable that the
international community has not banded together to repel Russia's
incursion the way a U.S.-led global alliance turned back Iraq's
attempted annexation of Kuwait. That move not only restored Kuwaiti
independence but also reinforced the norm against conquest. (Russia, of
course, is far more powerful than Iraq ever was and possesses nuclear
weapons to boot.)

At the same time, enforcing the norm against [**territorial
[conquest]{.mark}** [comes with]{.mark}]{.underline} tradeoffs, about
which everyone should be clear-eyed. Protecting Ukrainian sovereignty is
likely not worth a third **[[world
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**---especially [one [that could go
**nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The world should not [pay the
**ultimate price**]{.underline} just to support the norm against
territorial conquest. But the bloody costs that come with that choice
cannot be ignored. The West is currently walking a difficult line,
seeking to respond to Russia's invasion with strength but without
escalating the conflict.

#### Arctic conflict causes extinction.

**Shute '23** \[Joe; September 12; Ph.D. Researcher at Manchester
Metropolitan University; UnHerd, "An Arctic War is Coming,"
https://unherd.com/2023/09/an-arctic-war-is-coming-russia-china/\]

A similar story is being recorded right across the High North. "Arctic
amplification" is the term meteorologists use for the accelerated rate
of global warming. But the same amplification is occurring with the
geopolitics of the region. The Arctic is melting --- one scientific
study, published in June, claimed that the first summer in which all sea
ice disappears could occur as early as the 2030s --- and, from China to
the US to Putin's Russia, suddenly everyone wants a piece. [The **era**
of]{.underline} "[Arctic **exceptionalism**]{.underline}" declared by
Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987 [is]{.underline} resolutely
**[over]{.underline}**, his [entreaties for]{.underline} the [Arctic to
remain a "zone of peace]{.underline}" free from conflict and
exploitation [forgotten]{.underline}. As climate change accelerates and
Russia's invasion of [Ukraine]{.underline} has [**cleaved** apart the
international **order**, [the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[emerged
as]{.underline}]{.mark} the potential [[theatre of]{.mark} the next
**[global conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Alexander, who also represents the Gwich'in on the Arctic council (which
includes the eight Arctic states, Canada, Denmark, Sweden, Norway,
Finland, Iceland, the US and Russia) warns that [the global **race** to
plunder]{.underline} the [Arctic]{.underline} could [have
**devastating** consequences]{.underline}. "If you don't co-operate on
the Arctic and we don't get these things right, then I'll tell you this,
my friend: the world can change very rapidly."

**[Russia]{.underline}**, whose [territory **spans** around 53% of the
Arctic]{.underline} Ocean [shoreline]{.underline}, and
**[China]{.underline}** are rapidly [developing plans to expand
the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**orthern **[S]{.underline}**ea
**[R]{.underline}**oute. The maritime passage between the east and west
of the Arctic Ocean is regarded by the Kremlin as vital to avoid Western
sanctions. It is already possible to navigate the route for anyone with
several briefcases full of dollars to pay for the mandatory Russian ice
breakers which accompany any transit as patrol vessels. In 2024, the
Kremlin is planning to commence year-round navigations of the route,
through which it hopes to increase the amount of cargo shipped from
around 30 million annually to 80 million.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which has ominously [[declared
itself]{.mark} a "**near-[Arctic]{.mark}** [state]{.mark}"]{.underline}
--- also harbours ambitions to transform the passage into a silk road of
the far north, while in March, a Russian delegation to India held talks
over new co-operation over the route. [[The **West**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} similarly [flexing its muscles,]{.underline}
with [Finland]{.underline} (and the expected accession of Sweden)
[[extending **NATO's** borders]{.underline}]{.mark} into the Arctic. In
June, the US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken announced that the US
would be opening an outpost in the far-north Norwegian town of Tromsø,
stressing the need to have "a diplomatic footprint" above the Arctic
Circle. "[The war in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} has really
[[torpedoed]{.underline}]{.mark} this idea of [[Arctic
exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}," explains Dr Neil Melvin, Director
of International Security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).
"The whole focus of northern Europe has basically now shifted to
building security against Russia."

As Melvin points out, [the]{.underline} heavy losses [sustained by
[Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}'s land army in [Ukraine will **force** it
to become [increasingly **reliant** on]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear force**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} stationed [[in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, where the UK and US have also long
operated their own attack submarines. Russia's Northern Fleet comprises
of a dozen or so nuclear-powered attack submarines as well as surface
vessels, including two heavy nuclear-powered missile battle cruisers. In
recent years, Russia has also reoccupied old Cold War-era Arctic bases
to bolster its presence. "[[They]{.mark} will [feel more
**vulnerable**]{.mark}]{.underline} as a result of not having a strong
army, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} I think we are likely to see them
[[**threaten** nuclear options]{.underline}]{.mark} much more as part of
national defence," Melvin says of Russia's designs in the Arctic. "[They
are going to be much more **explicit** and threatening]{.underline}."

Beneath the ice, the Arctic possesses untold riches. The region is
estimated to contain a fifth of the world's undiscovered oil and gas
reserves and rare earth elements such as gold, nickel and zinc. While
most of these are present within the largely undisputed land borders of
the Arctic nations, it is the [increasingly navigable international
**waters**]{.underline} that [present the most likely
**flashpoint**]{.underline}. An ongoing process led by a United Nations
commission is considering sovereignty rights to the central Arctic Ocean
between Russia, Denmark and Canada. While Putin is cooperating with the
process so far, he has also planted a flag in the most literal sense ---
dropping a titanium standard of the Russian Federation two miles beneath
the ocean on the North Pole seabed in 2007. Fishing rights are also key;
as southern oceans heat up, species will migrate ever further north,
causing estimated catches in higher latitudes to increase by up to 20
per cent by 2050.

According to Professor Klaus Dodds, an expert in geopolitics and ice
studies based at Royal Holloway and author of the recent book, Border
Wars, the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard could prove another area of
conflict. Under a treaty originally signed in 1920, a host of countries
including China and Russia have rights to engage in commercial
activities across Svalbard. Moscow conducts coal mining operations on
the island of Spitsbergen (and insists on referring to Svalbard by the
same name, to emphasise its historic claim on the land). In settlements
such as Barentsburg, Russian is the predominant language.

"The concern is we know we have [potential [**flashpoints** like
Svalbard]{.mark}]{.underline} which, having caused agitation and tension
in the past, might be [**[escalate]{.mark}**d very
**[quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Dodds says. Aggression could be
anything from [[attacks on]{.mark} underwater
**[cables]{.mark}**]{.underline} (last year, a Russian trawler was
linked to the severing of a sub-sea fibre-optic cable which linked
Svalbard to the Norwegian mainland), [to]{.underline} an outright
[attack on [oil and gas **infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The
Norwegian European Arctic will be the space where, if anything, this is
most likely to happen," Dodds says. "That [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[be]{.mark} the ultimate **opportunity** for Russia to test
**NATO**'s resolve]{.underline}."

Regardless of the [potential for **[nuclear]{.mark}
conflict**]{.underline}, a burning Arctic poses grave threats for
humanity. The Arctic permafrost contains peatland soils which are the
world's most vital carbon sink. Globally, peatlands store twice as much
carbon as all the forests combined. When this burns, it releases the
carbon back into the atmosphere creating something of a doom loop.
According to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, wildfires
across Canada have released 290 megatons of carbon into the atmosphere
between January and August, more than 25% of the global total for 2023
in the year to date.

Thawing permafrost is also exposing chemical and radioactive waste and
millennia-old "zombie viruses". In 2016, around 100,000 reindeer were
culled in the Russian far north after an anthrax outbreak that killed a
12-year-old boy. Plague bacillus, smallpox and other historic diseases
are also feared to soon re-emerge from the melting earth. The discovery
earlier this summer of 46,000-year-old roundworms lying dormant in
Siberia, which are happily reproducing once again, may hold clues for
adapting to climate change --- but they also raise questions about what
else might venture forth in a thaw. And herein lies [the **great
lesson** of]{.underline} the [far north]{.underline}, Professor Dodds
explains: nothing here ever happens in isolation --- [[there will
be]{.underline}]{.mark} wider [[**ramifications** across the
**globe**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "Change in the Arctic is never
restricted to the Arctic itself," he says. "It is almost as if the
Arctic strikes back."

The time is long gone where we could think of [the Arctic]{.underline}
as a great pristine wilderness. Instead it has become the burning
crucible of our climate crisis. But, as the towering glaciers melt and
the seas of the Earth's fifth largest ocean are revealed to us at last,
their future looks even darker still, [reanimating]{.underline} the
[**bio**logical threats]{.underline} of our deep past, and
[providing]{.underline} yet another [site for]{.underline} human
competition and **[conquest]{.underline}**.

China seeks to establish its own sphere of influence in the Pacific
region that excludes the United States and Western influence while also
attempting to resolve territorial disputes through coercion and
threatening behavior. The most serious component of these strategic
challenges for the United States is the modernization and expansion of
[both Russia's and the PRC]{.underline}'s nuclear arsenals. [For the
**first time** in]{.underline} its [history, the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [is]{.underline} simultaneously facing
**[two]{.underline}** [adversarial **nuclear** peers]{.underline} whose

Wicked Deterrence Challenge

A wicked problem is one that is difficult to solve because of its
complexity, incomplete and changing information, multiple stakeholders,
competing and conflicting objectives, clash of cultures, or the
unprecedented or novel nature of the situation.2 Deterrence, by its very
nature as a function of influence over leadership decisionmaking, is a
wicked problem. Leadership decisionmaking can be impacted by numerous
unique factors, making the application of deterrence strategy more art
than science. As Keith Payne writes, "[There are **few**]{.underline},
if any, [universal **constants**]{.underline} in this regard; instead,
there is [a wide variety of]{.underline} operating
**[[factors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, some seen, others unseen,
[that]{.underline} can [**vary** greatly across time, place, and
opponent, and [may be **decisive**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in
determining]{.mark} if]{.underline} and how [**[deterrence]{.mark}**
will function]{.underline}."3

The emergence of the multilateral strategic environment and the need to
deter many nuclear actors simultaneously while continuing to assure
allies require the United States to rethink its deterrence policy. How
does deterrence policy need to adapt to address the changing multi-actor
environment? To begin to answer this question, analysts must start with
building an understanding of the strategic environment, including a deep
understanding of individual nations and the specific leaders the United
States seeks to deter. While this understanding will never be perfect,
it will reduce ignorance and provide a basis for designing a tailored
deterrence policy.

People's Republic of China

[[The **PRC's**]{.mark} meteoric **rise**]{.underline} has been
[motivated by its perceived need to **restore** its]{.underline}
rightful [place in the world **order**]{.underline}---to right the
wrongs done to China during its so-called Century of Humiliation. While
former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping articulated the PRC's strategy as
one of patience---the famous "hide and bide" strategy---current
President Xi Jinping has abandoned this approach, instead seizing the
opportunity to achieve his Chinese Dream of the "great rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation."4 However, Xi views the current world order as an
unacceptable impediment to China's geopolitical ambitions and the United
States as a direct threat to its national security.5 The PRC views
Western and particularly U.S. influence in the Pacific region as a
violation of its right to act as the regional hegemon and an impediment
to unification with Taiwan. Xi envisions China as the rightful
preeminent Asian and global power. Xi's bolder, more confrontational
strategy has provoked responses both from regional nations concerned
about their sovereignty and security and global nations invested in the
current rules-based international order.

[The PRC]{.underline} has [[repositioned]{.mark} itself
[**politically**, **economically**, and **militarily**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} better enable it to [**[achieve]{.mark}** its
[aspirations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The People's Liberation Army
(**[PLA]{.underline}**) has [undertaken a holistic military
[**modernization** of]{.mark}]{.underline} both [its [**conventional**
and **nuclear**]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}. Modernization
[efforts]{.underline} have been under way for decades, but they have
[increased to an **alarming** pace under **Xi**]{.underline}'s
leadership. [The PRC]{.underline} has [sought to]{.underline} develop an
ability to [forcibly **expel** Western forces and]{.underline}
ultimately to [prohibit their reentry]{.underline} into the region for
the purpose of securing its ambitions. Nuclear weapons forces are "a
strategic pillar of China's great power status," the linchpin in
excluding U.S. and Western interference, and ultimately serve as the
backstop to achieving its ambitions.6

[The PLA's rapid **development** of its]{.underline} nuclear [arsenal
[is]{.mark} the **[fastest]{.mark}** peacetime expansion of a nuclear
arsenal the [world has **witnessed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, going from
just a few hundred weapons at the end of the Cold War era to a projected
1,500 by 2035 if its current pace continues unabated.7 [These
developments will]{.underline} match, and in some areas qualitatively
[**exceed**, equivalency with the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. Xi has stated that he believes a robust
nuclear weapons program is critical to the PRC's ability to counter the
United States in the Pacific region. To this end, the PRC is [[investing
in]{.underline}]{.mark} and expanding the number of its
[**[land]{.mark}**-, **[sea]{.mark}**-, [and **air**]{.mark}-based
nuclear delivery platforms and [constructing]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessary [[to
support]{.underline}]{.mark} this [major
[expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}.8

The PRC's nuclear strategy has been relatively consistent since it first
acquired nuclear weapons in 1964, relying on a minimum deterrence
strategy made credible by a small nuclear arsenal capable of delivering
a secure second strike. The PRC's declared no-first-use policy further
reinforced this public commitment to maintaining a nonaggressive
position. However, the PRC's rapid nuclear expansion calls into question
whether the PLA is still committed to this strategy.9 In his testimony
before the House Armed Services Committee, General Anthony Cotton,
commander of U.S. Strategic Command, articulated this point, stating,
"[The PRC's actions are wholly **inconsistent** with its]{.underline}
long-professed [policy of **minimum** deterrence]{.underline}."10 The
expansion of the PRC's nuclear arsenal opens myriad possibilities of
ways it could adapt its strategy to both deter and coerce other nations.
However, due to a lack of transparency and an unwillingness to engage in
dialogue, it is unclear what the PRC's intentions are.11

The PRC's potential to change its nuclear strategy cannot be understated
in the maturing global circumstances. PLA officers are writing publicly
about the need to articulate conditions under which nuclear first use
may be permissible or even desirable. These include exceptional
scenarios such as conventional defeat threatening regime survival,
conventional attack on a nuclear scale, or attacks on PLA strategic
forces.12 As a result, the durability of the PRC's long-honored
no-first-use policy may soon be limited or deficient. While PRC debate
surrounding this policy gets the most attention from strategists and
policymakers, there is also debate surrounding its "sole purpose"
policy, with PLA strategists debating the benefits of using nuclear
weapons to deter conventional conflict.13 The active debate in the PRC
about changing its nuclear policy coupled with a lack of transparency
and communication increases uncertainty and the potential for
instability.

[The **discovery** of 300 new]{.underline} potential intercontinental
ballistic missile (**[[ICBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[silo**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} [brought into sharp relief the
**extent** of the PRC's]{.underline} nuclear modernization and
[expansion]{.underline}.14 When complete, [these]{.underline} silos
[[will provide]{.underline}]{.mark} the PRC with [persistent
**readiness** and]{.underline} the [ability to conduct extremely
**[rapid launch]{.mark}** sequences]{.underline}. In addition to
investing in fixed silos, [the PLA Rocket Force is investing in road
**mobiles** and [expanding]{.mark}]{.underline} the number of
[[**launchers** and **crews**]{.underline}]{.mark} in each unit [at an
unprecedented rate.]{.underline}15 The PLA Navy's six Jin-class
ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) rotate through near-continuous
deployment equipped with JL-2 submarine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBMs), though this platform is vulnerable as it needs to enter the
open Pacific in order to target the United States. However, the PLA Navy
is building the Type 096 SSBN, which will carry the updated JL-3 SLBM
capable of targeting the United States from Chinese littoral waters,
significantly increasing the survivability of its sea-based deterrent.16
Finally, the [PLA **Air Force** is [**reestablishing** its air
leg]{.mark}]{.underline} with the updated H6-N bomber, which will
complete a true regional triad. It is also [developing a new strategic
**bomber**]{.underline}, the H-20, but while specifications are still
unknown, it is clear that the PRC is intent on obtaining a credible
global triad.17 Beyond a traditional triad, [the PRC is
developing]{.underline} additional capabilities such as
**[[hypersonic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
missile**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, fractional
**[[orbital]{.underline}]{.mark}** [bombardment systems,
and]{.underline} the Dong Feng-26 medium-range ballistic missile with
both [conventional and [nuclear **payloads**]{.mark}]{.underline} that
could be swapped quickly in the field.18 While these capabilities are
not novel, they all have the potential to be destabilizing.

At the same time the PRC is modernizing its nuclear capabilities, it is
modernizing the command and control infrastructure to support it.
[Investments in **[ground-based]{.mark}**]{.underline} large
[phased-array **[radars]{.mark}** and]{.underline} the [ability to
detect]{.underline} ballistic [**[missile]{.mark}**
launche**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} with geostationary satellites [have
provided]{.underline} the PRC with [a comprehensive **[early
warning]{.mark}** capability]{.underline}.19 These capabilities make
credible the PRC's desire to shift to a "launch on warning" nuclear
posture, [[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential for
**miscalc**]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. The U.S.-China Economic and
Security Review Commission detailed the risk with such a posture,
stating that the "difficulties associated with learning to operate such
a system could generate false alarms about nonexistent incoming nuclear
attacks, potentially triggering a nuclear exchange between China and the
United States."20 [The PRC's **[unwilling]{.mark}**ness [to
enter]{.mark} risk-reduction **dialogues** and]{.underline} complete
[refusal to enter **[arms control]{.mark}**]{.underline} negotiations
[mean]{.underline} these [risks are left unaddressed]{.underline}.

Russia

[[The challenges]{.mark} posed [by **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} to
the rules-based international order [have [been on]{.mark} full
**[display]{.mark}** since]{.underline} at least [2008,
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia's [invasion of [**Georgia**,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} again in 2022 when President Vladimir Putin
began his "special military operation" in
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** to halt Kyiv's economic and cultural
progress toward the West. Putin views the U.S.-backed rules-based
international order as a threat to the Russian way of life. It is his
intent to renew the Russkiy Mir, the Russian world, and restore Russian
prestige and cultural and political influence in the vein of previous
Russian empires.21

The current revisionist and irredentist narrative in Russia argues that
Russia is a victim of U.S.-European hegemony and is besieged by North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) expansion in its periphery, a direct
threat to the goal of reestablishing the Russian world. The war in
Ukraine is a direct result of this perceived threat. Non-NATO and
non--European Union states with strong relationships with the West, in
general, have been less susceptible or receptive to Russian influence,
thereby diminishing Russia's status in its near abroad. At the prospect
of further NATO enlargement, Putin felt threatened to the point of
taking belligerent action. According to Dmitri Trenin, a member of
Russia's Foreign and Defense Policy Council, "What Russia craves is
respect. It does not want to be a junior partner---it wants to be an
equal."22

Despite significant initial gains in Ukraine, the Russian war effort has
endured countless tactical, operational, and strategic setbacks and has
begun to show clear signs of devolution into a protracted slog
reminiscent of the Korean War in the 1950s. A significant portion of
Russia's conventional capability has been degraded and destroyed by the
ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which could increase Putin's reliance on
nuclear capabilities for Russia's defense. The continued use of nuclear
saber-rattling by Putin and other Russian officials has effectively
deterred Western intervention and heavily influenced the type of
military assistance the West is willing to provide to Ukraine and
undermined Ukrainian resistance.23 As evidenced by steadily increasing
economic and material support from NATO, the effectiveness of these
nuclear threats is eroding. Putin's legitimate reliance on nuclear
weapons, however, coupled with robust nuclear signaling should not be
ignored or dismissed out of hand because [Russia's nuclear
weapons]{.underline} arsenal [remains a]{.underline} significant
[**existential** threat]{.underline} to the United States and its allies
throughout Europe and the Pacific region.

[The **capability** and **credibility** of Russia's]{.underline}
strategic and tactical nuclear [forces make them a **serious**
concern]{.underline} that cannot be ignored. [[Russia continues
to]{.mark} invest substantial resources to expand and
**[modernize]{.mark}**]{.underline} its strategic and nonstrategic
nuclear [capabilities]{.underline}. Russia's modernization plan, which
has been in the works for over a decade, includes [improving **each
leg** of its]{.underline} triad of [nuclear **delivery**]{.underline}
systems and developing new and novel nuclear capabilities. For example,
the Sarmat is a new silo-based ICBM that will be capable of carrying up
to 10 nuclear warheads.24 Russia's strategic submarine fleet will
include an entirely new Dolgorukiy class of SSBN submarines equipped
with SS-N-32 Bulava nuclear ballistic missiles by 2028. The Tu-160M
supersonic strategic bomber aircraft has extended range and is equipped
with more capable onboard systems than previous iterations, and 10 are
already in the field.25 The modernization of the Russian nuclear force
has increased the capability and credibility of Russia's nuclear triad.

In addition to modernizing its legacy systems, [Russia is
[developing]{.mark}]{.underline} and improving its
[**[hypersonic]{.underline}** [and **other**]{.underline}]{.mark} novel
[delivery system**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These include new systems
such as the Avangard hypersonic glide vehicle, the Kinzhal
[**[air]{.mark}**-launched ballistic missile, and]{.underline} the
Tsirkon [**[land]{.mark}**-attack cruise missile]{.underline}.
Furthermore, Russia maintains over 2,000 non--treaty accountable---often
referred to as tactical or nonstrategic---nuclear weapons that provide
diverse and flexible use and deterrence options. In fact, it is this
very threat of tactical nuclear weapons that has caused NATO nations to
revitalize focus on both their conventional and nuclear capabilities to
ensure that the Alliance possesses a credible deterrent.26 [Both
Russia's [**strategic** and **t**]{.mark}actical **[n]{.mark}**uclear
**[w]{.mark}**eapon**[s]{.mark}** are backed by]{.underline} a body of
**[doctrine]{.underline}** that explicitly lays out the conditions for
nuclear use, including possible first use in response to threats to the
"existence of the state."27

Since 1972, the relationship between the United States and the Soviet
Union, later the Russian Federation, has been partially stabilized by a
series of arms control agreements that provided mechanisms for building
trust and reducing risk by allowing some strategic predictability in the
relationship. For the first time in more than 40 years, U.S.-Russia
relations lack the stabilizing guardrails of these arms control
treaties. The last remaining arms control treaty regulating U.S. and
Russian strategic forces, [**[New START]{.mark}**, has **suffered** due
to]{.underline} the U.S. support of [Ukraine]{.underline} after the
Russian invasion. Shortly afterward, Russia began refusing onsite
inspections by U.S. personnel allowed by the treaty. Later, Russia
"paused" its compliance with New START and has since refused to begin
negotiations to extend or modify the agreement, which is set to expire
in February 2026.28 The [[expiration]{.mark} of strategic treaties with
Russia will]{.underline} not only [end]{.underline} self-imposed
[restraints, [potentially spurring]{.mark} an **[arms race]{.mark}**,
but]{.underline} will also **[eliminate]{.underline}** one of the most
important conduits for **[communication]{.underline}** between the
United States and Russia [[and]{.mark} set [conditions
for]{.mark}]{.underline} dangerous miscommunication, misunderstanding,
and **[[miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}**ulation.

North Korea

North Korea has posed a consistent threat to the United States and its
allies since the 1953 armistice. The nature of this threat has
oscillated between moderate and acute but has remained consistently
hostile. The persistence of the threat and more acute emerging
challenges have unfortunately allowed some to become numb to the true
severity and magnitude of what a conflict with North Korea could mean
for the region and the United States. Conversely, North Korean leader
Kim Jong Un does not waver in his focus on the United States as the
perceived preeminent existential threat to his nation. To secure his
power and protect his regime, Kim continues to invest in and grow North
Korea's nuclear arsenal. [The growth of **North Korea**]{.underline}'s
nuclear power [goes beyond security]{.underline}. Jung H. Pak, a Fellow
at the Brookings Institution, observed, "\[Kim\] has elevated and
embedded nuclear weapons in both the popular consciousness and the
ideological, physical, and cultural landscape, enshrining them in North
Korea's constitution and has effectively linked them to the country's
perception of prosperity."29

Along with advancing weapons development, [[North Korea]{.mark} has
[continued to **advance**]{.mark} its nuclear program,
accelerating]{.underline} its **[[testing]{.underline}]{.mark}** program
while refining its nuclear doctrine. North Korea enshrines its nuclear
doctrine into law, the most recent update occurring in 2022 with the
establishment of the State Policy and Nuclear Forces. This law served as
an update to the 2013 Law on Consolidating Position of Nuclear Weapons
State. While the [2022 law remains consistent with]{.underline} the
earlier version in [**affirming** the role of **nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline} in deterring aggression or responding if
deterrence should fail, it also outlined the
[[situations]{.underline}]{.mark} that [could [warrant a
**preemptive**]{.mark} nuclear [attack]{.mark}]{.underline}.30 Most
concerning, the 2022 North Korean law details the potential for an
automatic nuclear response---often referred to as a "dead man's hand"
mechanism---should military commanders be unable to communicate with
leadership in Pyongyang during a conflict. This severely complicates the
deterrence and escalation management strategies of the United States and
its allies.31

Doubts regarding the credibility of North Korea's nuclear capability
should be discarded. [Each]{.underline} successive underground [nuclear
test has produced a larger **yield**]{.underline}, with North Korea's
last test in 2017 producing a yield of approximately 250 kilotons---10
times larger than the bomb used at Nagasaki in 1945.32 Furthermore,
[North Korea's delivery systems continue to **advance** as]{.underline}
the [nation adheres to an aggressive **testing** schedule]{.underline}.
In 2022, North Korea conducted nearly 100 missile tests, more than it
had ever conducted.33 North Korea is developing ICBMs capable of holding
the United States at risk and several intermediate- and medium-range
ballistic missiles capable of targeting South Korea and Japan. It is
also pursuing an SLBM capability, which would increase the survivability
of its deterrent.34 Estimating the size of North Korea's nuclear arsenal
is exceedingly difficult, as the regime is even less transparent than
that of the PRC. That stated, North Korea is thought to have anywhere
from 35 to 65 warheads today, with the ability to add up to 18 more
warheads per year.35 The international community should no longer
consider Kim a proxy of the Chinese Communist Party or a buffer state
puppet and must not ignore North Korea's unique national objectives.

Complexity in the Multi-Actor Strategic Environment

The PRC, Russia, and North Korea represent primary nuclear security
concerns for the United States and its allies because of those states'
abilities to threaten existentially and coerce effectively. In the
developing multi-actor environment, U.S. relationships with each of
these states do not happen in a vacuum. [The strategic **environment**
contains other **nuclear**]{.underline} weapons [states]{.underline},
including U.S. allies [the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom and [**France**. **India** and
**Pakistan**]{.underline} are de facto nuclear weapons states, as they
are not signatories to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), nor
are they recognized as sanctioned nuclear weapons states by the NPT, as
they acquired their capability after 1970. [There are]{.underline} also
[[**additional** nations]{.mark} that [may desire]{.mark} nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}---adversaries [[such as
**Iran**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

For its part, the United States extends deterrence with its nuclear
umbrella through collective defense treaties to the 31 (soon to be 32)
nations of NATO, as well as Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Thus, the
deterrent relationships are never bilateral, as is often misremembered
about the Cold War era, but instead contain the security concerns of
multiple actors. As numerous deterrence scholars have expressed,
including Thérèse Delpech, [[this **multi-actor**]{.mark} strategic
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline} "may [[make]{.mark} a
[situation]{.mark} more **[unstable]{.mark}**]{.underline} . . . as
\[multiple actors\] introduce more variables" into deterrence
strategies.36 In U.S. deterrence efforts, each
**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** relationship [[must be
**tailored**]{.underline}]{.mark} for each state or actor and must
consider the nearly incalculable positions of allies and partners as
well as cooperators, competitors, and adversaries.

Cooperation between the United States and its traditional allies remains
strong and continues to grow. However, in the maturing multi-actor
deterrence reality, there is [increased **coop**eration
between]{.underline} and among the historically fiercely independent
[**PRC**, **Russia**, and **North Korea**]{.underline} in instances
where their strategic objectives align. These adversaries also have
their own strategic deterrent relationships beyond those with the United
States. China, India, and Pakistan form a deterrence triangle that
features China's and Pakistan's increasing cooperation while both
actively deterring India and each other. This [makes]{.underline} the
second- and third-order effects of [strategic **choices**]{.underline}
as [critically **important**]{.underline} as any deliberate direct
effort. [[Actions]{.underline}]{.mark} taken [[by]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates to
assure an Indo-Pacific ally [could [inspire]{.mark} the **[PRC]{.mark}**
to adjust]{.underline} its deterrent strategy,
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[trigger **India**]{.mark} to
adjust]{.underline} its deterrent strategy,
[[causing]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**ripple** effect
into]{.underline}]{.mark} its deterrent relationship with
**[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Understanding how the relationships
of adversaries, allies, partners, and third parties are interrelated and
connected is necessary to operate in the multi-actor strategic
environment.

#### Funding naval icebreakers [unleashes]{.underline} American arctic dominance.

America's military vessels brave contested waters, hurricanes, tropical
storms, and other chaos---so why is the presence of U.S. Navy ships in
the Arctic so limited? [[The Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, after all, is
no longer just vast icebergs floating around like sentinels of death,
surrounded by silence more oppressive than its cold---it [[is]{.mark}
now [a]{.mark} major geopolitical [**prize** in]{.mark} the **Great
Power Competition** between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [China, and Russia.]{.underline}

[The Arctic has relevance to **[every facet]{.mark}** of this
struggle.]{.underline} Energy? [The U.S. Geological Survey estimates
that [**one-eighth** of]{.mark} the world's untapped [oil]{.mark}
reserves [and **one-third** of]{.mark} its natural [gas]{.mark} reserves
lie in the Arctic.]{.underline} Trade? [The Arctic's three **[trade
routes]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[the Northwest Passage]{.underline}
(above Canada), [the Northern Sea Route]{.underline} (above Russia),
[and the Central Arctic Route]{.underline} (between Iceland and the
Bering Strait, through the North Pole)---[will soon subsume a
substantial share of shipping]{.underline}, by some accounts five
percent of global maritime traffic in 2030 and with no sign of slowing
down. Political-military risk? [The [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}n
[Navy]{.underline}'s elite [Northern Fleet recently
**[expanded]{.mark}** its area-of-responsibility specifically [to secure
the Northern Sea Route]{.mark}, and [China proclaimed]{.mark} itself a
"near Arctic" state as it begins to establish [a **"Polar Silk
Road"**]{.mark} of influence and commerce in the regio]{.underline}n
("near" does a lot of work there). In fact, [China and Russia are
cooperating in the Arctic,]{.underline} as evidenced by their joint
naval patrol near the U.S. Aleutian Islands in 2023.

The Great Powers in the Arctic

The [Great Power Competition in the [Arctic will be won with
**icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}---highly specialized naval vessels
capable of slicing directly through polar ice that would crush
traditional ships and withstanding "storms that can ice over
superstructures until ships become so top-heavy they capsize."
Currently, [complete [exploration, shipping, and patrol]{.mark} of the
Arctic [is **impossible** without them]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet, [there
is a stark imbalance among the Great Powers in their icebreaking
capabilities. China,]{.underline} located 800 miles away from the Arctic
at its closest point, [operates two existing icebreakers]{.underline}
(with a third on the way) and is developing nuclear-powered technology
for these vessels. [[Russia has]{.mark} a fleet of [forty-six]{.mark}
icebreakers, including three nuclear-powered ships for extended Arctic
patrols, and]{.underline} has recently [[launched]{.mark}]{.underline} a
new "class of [[**combat icebreakers** with]{.mark} high-speed guns and
launchers for anti-ship and land-attack cruise **[missiles."]{.mark}**
Both [Russia and China have **centralized** their]{.mark} icebreaker
[programs]{.mark} under their navies, underscoring their view of these
ships as military assets.]{.underline}

In contrast, [[America's]{.mark} icebreaker program is [in
**disarray**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The U.S. government has only two
operational icebreakers---the decades-old Polar Star and the Healy---and
neither of them are capable of year-round operations. [[Plans]{.mark} to
build a new fleet of six to nine icebreakers]{.underline}, through the
Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program, [[are
**faltering**.]{.underline}]{.mark} This joint venture between the Navy
and Coast Guard is vastly over budget and behind schedule, already
exceeding procurement cost by 39 percent, with the first delivery
expected in 2029---four years late. Unlike Russia and China, the U.S.
has no serious plan to equip its developing icebreakers with nuclear
power. Moreover, while the Navy has some involvement in procurement and
construction of the icebreakers, [the Coast Guard alone is responsible
for their operations. This is important because the [Navy is]{.mark} the
U.S. military's **[forward-deployed,]{.mark}** combat-oriented force,
while the [Coast Guard is]{.mark} structured primarily for homeland
[defense. This]{.mark}]{.underline} organizational [[divide
means]{.mark} that the purpose, posture, and [operational reach]{.mark}
of America's icebreakers are dangerously [**mismatched** with]{.mark}
those of its primary [adversaries]{.mark} in the Arctic.]{.underline}

The Need for a U.S. Navy Icebreaker Program

Accordingly, the U.S. [[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark} and the President
[[must enact **legislation** requiring the Navy to build and operate its
own]{.mark} combat-oriented icebreaker [program to **secure**]{.mark}
our national interests in [the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} The [Navy is
**unlikely** to take on this role voluntarily.]{.underline} In 2023, the
former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Michael Gilday, underscored
this reluctance when he deflected questions about icebreaker procurement
to the Coast Guard, making it clear that he did not view the program as
the Navy's responsibility. Currently, the Coast Guard is the only branch
of the U.S. military legally tasked with "develop\[ing\],
establish\[ing\], maintain\[ing\], and operat\[ing\] icebreaking
facilities." [[Without a mandate,]{.mark} the [Navy has]{.mark} shown
[no intention to ]{.mark}]{.underline}expand its footprint into the
[[icebreak]{.underline}]{.mark}ing business. Notably, Gilday's 2022
Navigation Plan, which outlines the Navy's strategic goals through 2045,
does not even acknowledge the Arctic as a major global maritime shipping
route, nor does it identify potential geographic choke points in the
region. In 2020, then-Secretary of the Navy, Kenneth Braithwaite,
acknowledged the importance of icebreakers in front of Congress, but
stated that "it is not a mission that is central to the United States
Navy" and is one it "rel\[ies\] on the Coast Guard to provide." However,
[[leaving this critical]{.mark} program solely [with the Coast
Guard]{.mark}]{.underline}---a service with less than 10 percent the
Navy's size and budget---[**[neglects]{.mark}** U.S. **[strategic
interests]{.mark}** in the Arctic.]{.underline}

[U.S. [presence]{.mark} in the Arctic [requires]{.mark} a
**[robust]{.mark}** naval [combat]{.mark} capability which]{.underline}
the [Coast Guard cannot provide alone.]{.underline} In his 2001
commentary on the differences between the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard,
Professor Colin Gray of the Naval War College identified three unique
characteristics of the Navy, all of which are implicated by the
icebreaker program.

First, the Navy "takes its tune ... from contro\\l (even command) of the
high seas." This means the first duty of "the premier navy, is to
control sea lines of communication---to allow or deny access to the sea,
thence across it, and finally to the land, where humankind lives."
However, [[without]{.mark} an active **[icebreaker presence]{.mark}** in
the Arctic, the [Navy]{.mark} is]{.underline} voluntarily [denying
itself full access to the Arctic [leaving]{.mark} [gaps for i]{.mark}ts
adversaries---namely [Russia]{.mark} and [China, to]{.mark} aggressively
expand and **[militarize]{.mark}** their icebreaker
presence.]{.underline}

Second, the Navy's commitment to "boldly go ... where great navies have
feared to sail" is undermined by its repudiation of icebreaking
operations. [Failing to establish a surface presence in the Arctic with
icebreakers could [yield]{.mark} an [**"asymmetric \[\] equalizer**" for
adversaries]{.mark}, a risk that becomes more imminent as polar ice
melts and access to the Arctic increases.]{.underline}

Third, and most importantly, ["the navy of a superpower that aspires to
protect commerce and international order globally has no responsible
choice other than to pursue excellence virtually wherever military
science takes it,]{.underline} however serendipitously." Russia and
China are actively moving the Great Power Competition to the Arctic:
[Russia is arming its icebreakers with anti-ship weapons and cruise
missiles, both nations are regularly patrolling the Arctic seas with
icebreakers, and heavily investing in nuclear technology for these
vessels.]{.underline} While icebreakers are certainly necessary for the
Coast Guard's missions---including search and rescue, navigation,
environmental protection, interdiction, and ice operations---[[Russia
and China have]{.mark} embraced [icebreakers as **dual-use
assets**]{.mark} that squarely address the Navy's purpose.]{.underline}
Moreover, [the [Navy and Air Force's existing]{.mark} submarine and
aircraft [presence]{.mark} in the Arctic [is **inadequate**]{.mark} for
the Great Power Competition]{.underline}. Submarines and aircraft alone
cannot "clear a path for critical shipping, respond to oil spills, or
conduct maritime safety and security boardings in the U.S. Arctic"---let
alone accomplish more strategic goals of sea control and power
projection in the region.

Separately from the mission, Congress and the President should also
require an independent Navy icebreaker program due to the Coast Guard's
ongoing struggles in procuring and constructing the vessels. This
summer, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
recently [[signed the ICE Pact]{.mark} with Finland and Canada [to
build]{.mark} seventy to ninety [new icebreaker]{.mark}s over the next
decade.]{.underline} While this agreement will help expand America's
icebreaker fleet, it relies on Finland---which can build a polar-class
vessel in two years at just 25 percent of the cost of in America---to
handle construction. [This [outsourcing is]{.mark}]{.underline},
frankly**[, [an embarrassment.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The poor outcomes
in the PSC program may stem in part from its joint structure: since the
Coast Guard operates the icebreakers, the PSC program lacks the Navy's
full commitment. [The [Navy hasn't]{.mark} fully [leveraged]{.mark} its
[**size**, **money**, **expertise**]{.mark} and [**influence** to
**drive efficiency**]{.mark} or accelerate]{.underline} progress of the
program, [while the Coast Guard remains constrained by the Navy's budget
authority.]{.underline} Furthermore, each service can deflect blame onto
the other in congressional oversight hearings, complicating
accountability for the program's setbacks.

In some ways, the PSC Program inverts the issues between space operators
and Air Force leadership that precipitated the United States Space
Force. There, space operators' lack of independence in the DAF---which
is traditionally led by pilots---meant space operations and acquisition
were deprioritized. With icebreakers however, [the [lack of]{.mark}
substantial [**direct involvement** by the
Navy]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially in operations---[[may be
depriving]{.mark} the [military]{.mark} of considerable [**influence**
that could **expedite** and **improve**]{.mark} the development of these
critical [vessels.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Conclusion

The Arctic is poised to become a critical arena in the Great Power
Competition. Thus, to ensure the U.S. is strategically postured in this
region, incoming-President Donald J. Trump should work with Congress to
enact legislation mandating that the Navy build its own combat-oriented
icebreaker fleet---which, upon completion, can sustain a U.S. surface
warfare presence in the Arctic.

### Scenario 1 \-\-- Climate Change

#### Icebreakers are vital to scientific research and enabling on-shore research

**Hammitt 17** \[Robert. "Icebreakers: An Overview,"

[[Icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course, [[are
vital]{.underline}]{.mark} scientific tools, [[enabling
research]{.underline}]{.mark} in the high north as well as Antarctic
waters. [[Research]{.underline}]{.mark} done [[aboard
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[furthered]{.underline}]{.mark}
our collective [knowledge of climate science, hydrology, marine biology,
astronomy, and [many]{.mark} other [fields]{.mark}]{.underline}. Polar
research also has immediate value for polar operations, thanks to
studies of the ice cap, ocean currents, and depth soundings.
[[Icebreakers give scientists access to polar waters, but also allow
equipment and supplies to reach on-shore research
stations]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether in the high north or Antarctica.
Research also supports more narrow national interest such as the
bathymetric work required for countries to claim an extended continental
shelf under the [UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS)](http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf).
The cost of building an icebreaker would be challenging for individual
research institutions to finance, so in this use, an icebreaker is a
classic example of a public good, enabling research that would be
impossible without government support.

#### But current icebreakers are insufficient

[Research icebreakers are a crucial infrastructure and tool for
conducting scientific investigations in the ice-covered areas of the
Arctic Ocean]{.underline} -- those regions that urgently need to be
explored before they disappear,' said Dr Veronica Willmott, Project
Manager of ARICE, International Cooperation Unit at the Alfred Wegener
Institute, Helmholtz Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), in
Germany. Get in touch Get in touch '[[The lack of availability of
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark} in Europe and beyond and a weakly
coordinated polar research fleet [[impedes]{.underline}]{.mark} Europe's
[[capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} to investigate this region.
[[There]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} thus an [[urgent need
for]{.mark} providing polar scientists with [better]{.mark} research
[icebreaker capacities]{.mark} for the Arctic]{.underline}.' Given the
strategic importance of ARICE, the European Commission (EC) funded the
project through the Horizon 2020 Work Programme. Over a project lifespan
of four years, the EC committed €6 million of investment in the
consortium, of which 50% was allocated to giving researchers access to
the research icebreakers 'Arctic marine research is technologically
challenging and cost intensive, so it is often beyond the capacities of
one single nation,' Willmott told ResearchConnect 'Science in the
ice-covered parts of the Arctic Ocean can thus only be carried out in
close scientific and operational international cooperation.' According
to Willmott, retreating sea ice and warming waters create opportunities
and challenges that have given rise to an unprecedented political and
economic interest in the Arctic Ocean over the past decade,
necessitating a project of this nature even more. '[The recent changes
and the resulting increased economic activity in the region have
triggered a societal demand for accurate sea-ice and weather
predictions, information on the status of the Arctic Ocean and its
marine life, and complex predictions of future scenarios]{.underline},'
Willmott explained. 'Even if European Arctic research has contributed
critical knowledge to identifying the processes behind these rapid
changes, [[datasets from the Arctic Ocean are still insufficient to
fully understand]{.mark} and more effectively predict the effects of
[climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}.' The [largest gaps in research
knowledge and understanding of the Arctic]{.underline} system processes
are outside the summer season, when the Arctic Ocean is logistically and
technologically extremely difficult to reach. To address these knowledge
gaps and to develop policy recommendations for a sustainable usage of
the Arctic Ocean and its resources, it is [[imperative that
the]{.underline}]{.mark} international Arctic [[science community
has]{.underline} [access to]{.underline}]{.mark} [world-class research
[icebreakers]{.mark} to study the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}. Keeping

[Science, research and innovation play a key role in increasing our
knowledge of the Arctic]{.underline}, in understanding the changes of
the region and hence in contributing to providing policy responses to
the huge challenges it is facing. [It is an illustration of the
importance of science diplomacy]{.underline}. Science diplomacy has
different dimensions. This article will address how science contributes
to evidence-based policymaking in turbulent times[. While science and
technology play an increasingly important role in the geopolitical
arena, it has been claimed that science diplomacy in the Arctic has been
severely impacted by geopolitics.]{.underline} Though some negative
effects are clearly observable, it is worthwhile to assess the real
dimension of the impact of reduced scientific cooperation with Russia.
Indeed, [a closer look at recent developments demonstrates that current
geopolitics did create new opportunities for science diplomacy in and
for the Arctic, which cannot be neglected.]{.underline}

#### Diplomacy unlocks new opportunities to collaborate and understand key tipping points and timeframes for climate impacts

Storben R. **Christiensen**, 22 April **2025**, environmental scientist
at Aarhus University, Denmark, and the University of Oulu, Finland.,
Arctic researchers need to find ways to keep working together,
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01239-0

[[The Arctic is warming faster]{.mark} on average [than the rest of the
world]{.mark}, with global consequences.]{.underline} Without curbing
greenhouse-gas emissions, [within 15 years, there could be no summer sea
ice to reflect solar radiation from around Earth's North
Pole,]{.underline} amplifying heating elsewhere. Meltwater from ice
sheets will push sea levels up. And [the region's thawing
soils](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01313-4) will release
methane into the atmosphere, boosting greenhouse-gas concentrations
further --- such releases already seem to be
accelerating[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01239-0#ref-CR1).
[All told, [what's happening]{.mark} now in polar regions [could
push]{.mark} the planet's climate system [beyond 'tipping
points']{.mark} into a completely new state]{.underline}. For example,
ice cores show that ice sheets in Greenland and the Antarctic are
extremely sensitive and could deteriorate suddenly, in unexpected
ways[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01239-0#ref-CR2).
[Such concerns have prompted the]{.underline} United Nations
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [(IPCC) to urgently evaluate
the risks of potential tipping points for warming, ice melting and
sea-level rise]{.underline} in its forthcoming Seventh Assessment
Report, which will be completed by 2029**[. Such investigations will
[require Arctic research on permafrost, land ecosystems, land ice, ice
sheets and coasts]{.mark} to be conducted at full speed]{.underline}**
**[in the next two to three years]{.underline}**. [[Accomplishing this
will be hard at a time when]{.mark} some [world powers are hampering
research in the region]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Scientists]{.underline}
[need]{.underline} [to]{.underline} speak up and [develop joint
programmes now to make this crucial work possible. Arctic science has a
long history of peaceful collaboration.]{.underline} Since the
International Geophysical Year in 1957--58, joint Arctic research
between nations has been conducted independently of geopolitics, just as
it is on the International Space Station. For example, the International
Biological Program (1964--74) enabled cross-country comparisons of
tundra ecosystems across the far north, regardless of political borders
and the cold war[. The end of the cold war brought more attention to
science in the region,]{.underline} starting with the Murmansk
Initiative on uniting economic, environmental and security issues in the
Arctic, presented in 1987 by the Soviet Union's then-leader, Mikhail
Gorbachev. The International Arctic Science Committee was established in
1990 to promote collaboration between all Arctic nations. Optimism rose
further with the establishment of the Arctic Council in 1996, as a forum
for coordination among foreign ministers of all Arctic states and
representatives of Indigenous communities. [This was badly needed then,
as it is now, given the seriousness of the climate crisis.]{.underline}

**Warming causes [extinction]{.underline} \-- feedback loops and tipping
points make it [rapid]{.underline} and [catastrophic]{.underline}**

Luke **Kemp '22** \[August 1; Research Affiliate at the Center for Study
of Existential Risk at the University of Cambridge, Ph.D; Chi Xu; Joanna
Depledge; Timothy Lenton; "Climate Endgame: Exploring catastrophic
climate change scenarios,"
https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119\]

Although [bad-to-worst case scenarios]{.underline} remain underexplored
[in the **scientific literature**]{.underline}, statements labeling
[**[climate]{.mark}** change [as]{.mark} **catastrophic**]{.underline}
are not uncommon. UN Secretary-General António Guterres called climate
change [an]{.underline} "[**[existential]{.mark} threat**.]{.underline}"
Academic studies have warned that warming above 5 °C is likely to be
"[beyond catastrophic]{.underline}" (50), and above 6 °C constitutes "an
[indisputable [global catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}" (9).

Current discussions over climate catastrophe are undermined by unclear
terminology. The term "catastrophic climate change" has not been
conclusively defined. [An existential]{.underline} [risk]{.underline} is
usually defined as a risk that cause an enduring and significant loss of
long-term human potential (51, 52). This existing definition is deeply
ambiguous and requires societal discussion and specification of
long-term human values (52). While a democratic exploration of values is
welcome, it is not required to understand pathways to human catastrophe
or extinction (52). For now, the existing definition is not a solid
foundation for a scientific inquiry.

We offer clarified working definitions of such terms in Table 1. This is
an initial step toward creating a lexicon for global calamity. Some of
the terms, such as what constitutes a "plausible" risk or a "significant
contributor," are necessarily ambiguous. Others, such as thresholding at
10% or 25% of global population, are partly arbitrary (10% is intended
as a marker for a precedented loss, and 25% is intended as an
unprecedented decrease; see SI Appendix for further discussion). Further
research is needed to sharpen these definitions. The thresholds for
[global catastrophic and decimation risks]{.underline} are intended as
general heuristics and not concrete numerical boundaries. Other factors
such as morbidity, and cultural and [economic loss]{.underline}, need to
be considered.

We define risk as the probability that exposure to climate change
impacts and responses will result in adverse consequences for human or
ecological systems. For the Climate Endgame agenda, we are particularly
interested in catastrophic consequences. Any risk is composed of four
determinants[: **hazard**, exposure, **vulnerability**, and
response]{.underline} (3).

We have set global [warming of 3 °C or more]{.underline} by the end of
the century as a marker for extreme climate change. This threshold is
chosen for four reasons: [Such a **[temp]{.mark}erature**
[rise]{.mark}]{.underline} well [**[exceeds]{.mark}** internationally
agreed **[targets]{.mark}**]{.underline}, all the [IPCC "reasons for
**concern**"]{.underline} in climate impacts [are]{.underline} either
"high" or ["**very high**" risk]{.underline} between 2 °C and 3 °C,
there are substantially heightened risks of [[**self-amplifying**
changes]{.mark} that would [make it **impossible to limit**]{.mark}
warming to 3 °C,]{.underline} and [these]{.underline} levels [relate to
far greater uncertainty]{.underline} in impacts.

Key Research Thus Far

The closest attempts to directly study or comprehensively address how
climate change could lead to human extinction or global catastrophe have
come through popular science books such as The Uninhabitable Earth (53)
and Our Final Warning (10). The latter, a review of climate impacts at
different degrees, concludes that a global temperature rise of 6 °C
"imperils even the survival of humans as a species" (10).

We know that [[**health risks worsen** with]{.mark} rising
temperatures]{.underline} (54). For example, there is already an
increasing probability of multiple "[breadbasket failures]{.underline}"
(causing a **[[food]{.mark} price shock]{.underline}**) with higher
temperatures (55). For the top four maize-producing regions (accounting
for 87% of maize production), the [likelihood of production
losses]{.underline} greater than 10% [jumps]{.underline} from 7%
annually under a 2 °C temperature rise to 86% under 4 °C (56). The IPCC
notes, in its Sixth Assessment Report, that 50 to 75% of the global
population could be exposed to life-threatening climatic conditions by
the end of the century due to [**[extreme heat]{.mark}** and
humidity]{.underline} (6). SI Appendix provides further details on
several key studies of extreme climate change.

The IPCC reports synthesize peer-reviewed literature regarding climate
change, impacts and vulnerabilities, and mitigation. Despite identifying
15 [tipping elements in **biosphere, oceans**, and
cryosphere]{.underline} in the Working Group 1 contribution to the Sixth
Assessment Report, many with irreversible thresholds, there were very
few publications on catastrophic scenarios that could be assessed. The
most notable coverage is the Working Group II "[reasons for
concern]{.underline}" syntheses that have been reported since 2001.
These syntheses were designed to inform determination of what is
"dangerous [anthropogenic interference]{.underline}" with the climate
system, that the UNFCCC aims to prevent. The five concerns are unique
and [threatened **[ecosystems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, frequency and
severity of [[extreme **weather**]{.mark} events]{.underline}, global
distribution and balance of impacts, total [economic and ecological
impact]{.underline}, and **[irreversible]{.underline}**, large-scale,
[abrupt [transitions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Each IPCC assessment found
greater risks occurring at lower increases in global mean temperatures.
In the Sixth Assessment Report, all five concerns were listed as very
high for temperatures of 1.2 °C to 4.5 °C. In contrast, only two were
rated as very high at this temperature interval in the previous
Assessment Report (6). [[All]{.mark} five **[concerns are]{.mark}**
now]{.underline} at "high" or "[**[very high]{.underline}**"]{.mark} for
2 °C to 3 °C of warming (57).

A Sample Research Agenda: Extreme Earth System States, Mass Mortality,
Societal Fragility, and Integrated Climate Catastrophe Assessments

We suggest a research agenda for catastrophic climate change that
focuses on four key strands:

Understanding extreme climate change dynamics and impacts in the long
term

Exploring climate-triggered pathways to mass morbidity and mortality

Investigating social fragility: [vulnerabilities, **risk
cascades**]{.underline}, and risk responses

Synthesizing the research findings into "integrated catastrophe
assessments"

Our proposed agenda learns from and builds on integrated assessment
models that are being adapted to better assess large-scale harms. A
range of tipping points have been assessed (58--60), with effects
varying from a 10% chance of doubling the social cost of carbon (61) up
to an eightfold increase in the optimal carbon price (60). This echoes
earlier findings that welfare estimates depend on fat tail risks (31).
Model assumptions such as discount rates, exogenous growth rates, risk
preferences, and damage functions also strongly influence outcomes.

There are large, important aspects missing from these models that are
highlighted in the research agenda: longer-term impacts under extreme
climate change, pathways toward mass morbidity and mortality, and the
risk cascades and systemic risks that extreme climate impacts could
trigger. Progress in these areas would allow for more realistic models
and damage functions and help provide direct estimates of casualties
(62), a necessary moral noneconomic measure of climate risk. We urge the
research community to develop integrated conceptual and semiquantitative
models of climate catastrophes.

Finally, we invite other scholars to revise and improve upon this
proposed agenda.

Extreme Earth System States.

We need to understand potential long-term states of the Earth system
under extreme climate change. This means mapping different "[Hothouse
Earth]{.underline}" scenarios (21) or other extreme scenarios, such as
alternative circulation regimes or [[large, **irreversible
changes**]{.mark} in ice cover and sea level]{.underline}. This research
will require consideration of long-term climate dynamics and their
impacts on other planetary-level processes. Research suggests that
previous [mass extinction events]{.underline} occurred due to
**[threshold effects]{.underline}** in the carbon cycle that [**we could
cross** this century]{.underline} (40, 63). Key impacts in previous mass
extinctions, such as [ocean hypoxia and anoxia]{.underline}, could also
**[escalate]{.underline}** in the longer term (40, 64).

Studying potential tipping points and irreversible "committed" changes
of ecological and climate systems is essential. For instance, modeling
of the [Antarctic **[ice sheet]{.mark}**]{.underline} suggests there are
several tipping points that exhibit hysteresis (65). **[Irreversible
[loss]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the West Antarctic ice sheet was
[found]{.underline} to be triggered [at]{.underline} ∼[2 °]{.underline}C
global warming, and the current ice sheet configuration [cannot be
regained]{.underline} even if temperatures return to present-day levels.
At a 6 °C to 9 °C rise in global temperature, slow, [irreversible loss
of the East Antarctic ice sheet]{.underline} and over 40 m of sea level
rise equivalent could be triggered (65). Similar studies of areas such
as the Greenland ice sheet, permafrost, and terrestrial vegetation would
be helpful. Identifying all the potential Earth system tipping elements
is crucial. This should include a [consideration of wider planetary
boundaries]{.underline}, such as biodiversity, that will [influence
**[tipping points]{.mark}**]{.underline} (66), [[**feedbacks** beyond
the climate]{.underline}]{.mark} system, and how [tipping
elements]{.underline} could **[[cascade]{.mark} together]{.underline}**
(67).

[Mass]{.underline} Morbidity and [Mortality]{.underline}.

There are many potential contributors to climate-induced morbidity and
mortality, but the "four horsemen" of the climate change end game are
likely to be famine and undernutrition, [extreme weather events,
**conflict**, and vector-borne **diseases**.]{.underline} These will be
[worsened by additional risks]{.underline} and impacts [such
as]{.underline} mortality from [**air pollution** and sea level
rise.]{.underline}

These pathways require further study. Empirical estimates of even direct
fatalities from heat stress thus far in the United States are
systematically underestimated (68). A review of the health and climate
change literature from 1985 to 2013 (with a proxy review up to 2017)
found that, of 2,143 papers, only 189 (9%) included a dedicated
discussion of more-extreme health impacts or systemic risk (relating to
migration, famine, or conflict) (69). Models also rarely include
adaptive responses. Thus, the overall mortality estimates are uncertain.

How can potential mass morbidity and mortality be better accounted
for? 1) Track compound hazards through bottom-up modeling of systems and
vulnerabilities (70) and rigorously stress test preparedness (71). 2)
Apply models to higher-temperature scenarios and longer timelines. 3)
Integrate risk cascades and systemic risks (see the following section)
into health risk assessments, such as by incorporating morbidity and
mortality resulting from a climate-triggered food price shock.

Societal Fragility: Vulnerabilities, Risk Cascades, and Risk Responses.

More-complex risk assessments are generally more realistic. The
determinants of risk are not just hazards, vulnerabilities, and
exposures, but also responses (3, 72). A complete risk assessment needs
to consider climate impacts, differential exposure, systemic
vulnerabilities, responses of societies and actors, and the knock-on
effects across borders and sectors (73), potentially resulting in
systemic crises. In the worst case(s), a domino effect or spiral could
continuously worsen the initial risk.

[Societal **risk cascades** could involve [conflict, disease]{.mark},
**[political change]{.mark}**, and economic **crises**]{.underline}.
Climate change has a [complicated relationship with
**conflict**]{.underline}, including, possibly, as a risk factor (74)
especially [in areas with]{.underline} preexisting [ethnic
conflict]{.underline} (75). Climate change could affect the
[spread]{.underline} and [transmission of infectious
disease]{.underline}s, as well as the expansion and severity of
different **[zoonotic infections]{.underline}** (76), creating
conditions for [**[novel outbreaks]{.mark}** and infections]{.underline}
(6,77). [Epidemics]{.underline} can, in turn, [trigger cascading
**impacts**]{.underline}, as in the case of COVID-19. Exposure to
ecological stress and natural disasters are key determinants for the
cultural "tightness" (strictness of rules, adherence to tradition, and
severity of punishment) of societies (78). The literature on the median
economic damages of climate change is profuse, but there is far less on
[financial tail risks]{.underline}, such as the possibility [of global
**[financial crises.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Past studies could be drawn upon to investigate societal risk.
Relatively small, regional climate changes are linked to the
transformation and even [[**collapse** of]{.underline}]{.mark} previous
[[societies]{.underline}]{.mark} (79, 80). This could be [due to
**declining resilience** and]{.underline} the passing of **[tipping
points]{.underline}** in these societies. There is some evidence for
critical slowing down in societies prior to their collapse (81, 82).
However, care is needed in drawing lessons from premodern case studies.
Prehistory and history should be studied to determine not just how past
societies were affected by specific climate hazards but how those
effects differ as societies change with respect to, for example,
population density, wealth inequality, and governance regime. Such
framing will allow past and current societies to be brought under a
single system of analysis (37).

The characteristics and vulnerabilities of a modern globalized world
where food and transport distribution systems can buffer against traumas
will need to feature in work on societal sensitivity. Such large,
[interconnected systems bring]{.underline} their own sources of
[fragility]{.underline}, particularly if networks are relatively
homogeneous, with a few dominant nodes highly connected to everyone else
(83). Other important modern-day vulnerabilities include the rapid
spread of misinformation and disinformation. These epistemic risks are
serious concerns for public health crises (84) and have already hindered
climate action. A high-level and simplified depiction of how risk
cascades could unfold is provided in Fig. 3.

(meaning a dampening feedback). See SI Appendix for further information.

Integrated Catastrophic Assessments.

Climate change will unfold in a world of changing ecosystems,
geopolitics, and technology. Could we even see "[warm
[wars]{.mark}]{.underline}"---[technologically enhanced **great power
conflicts** [over]{.mark}]{.underline} dwindling carbon budgets, climate
impacts, or [[SRM]{.underline}]{.mark} experiments? Such developments
and scenarios need to be considered to build a full picture of climate
dangers. Climate change could reinforce other interacting threats,
including [rising **[inequality]{.mark}**, demographic stresses,
**[misinfo]{.mark}rmation**, new **destructive [weapons]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark} the **[overshoot]{.mark}** of other planetary
boundaries]{.underline} (85). There are also [natural
**[shocks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as [[**solar flares**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} high-impact **[[volcan]{.mark}ic
erupti[o]{.mark}n[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, that present possible deadly
synchronicities (86). Exploring these is vital, and a range of
"standardized catastrophic scenarios" would facilitate assessment.

viruse]{.mark}s as they are also known -- [have]{.mark} already [been
isolated]{.mark} [by researchers]{.mark} [who]{.mark} have [raised fears
that a new global medical emergency could be triggered -- not by an
illness new to science but by a disease from the distant past.]{.mark}
As a result, [scientists have]{.mark} begun [planning an Arctic
monitoring network that would pinpoint early cases of a disease caused
by ancient micro-organisms]{.mark}. Additionally, it would provide
quarantine and expert medical treatment for infected people in a bid to
contain an outbreak, and prevent infected people from leaving the
region.]{.underline} "At the moment, analyses of pandemic threats focus
on diseases that might emerge in southern regions and then spread
north," said geneticist Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille
University. "By contrast, little attention has been given to an outbreak
that might emerge in the far north and then travel south -- and that is
an oversight, I believe. [[There are viruses]{.mark} up there [that have
the potential to infect humans and start a new disease
outbreak]{.mark}.]{.underline}" This point was backed by virologist
Marion Koopmans of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. "We don't
know what viruses are lying out there in the permafrost but I think
there is a real risk that there might be one capable of triggering a
disease outbreak -- say of an ancient form of polio. We have to assume
that something like this could happen." In 2014, Claverie led a team of
scientists who isolated live viruses in Siberia and showed they could
still infect single-cell organisms -- even though they had been buried
in permafrost for thousands of years. Further research, published last
year, revealed the existence of several different viral strains from
seven different sites in Siberia and showed these could infect cultured
cells. One virus sample was 48,500 years old. "The viruses we isolated
were only able to infect amoebae and posed no risk to humans," said
Claverie. "However, that does not mean that other viruses -- currently
frozen in the permafrost -- might not be able to trigger illnesses in
humans. [We have identified genomic traces of poxviruses and
herpesviruses, which are well known human pathogens, for
example."]{.underline} Permafrost covers a fifth of the northern
hemisphere and is made up of soil that has been kept at temperatures
below zero for long periods. Some layers have remained frozen for
hundreds of thousands of years, scientists have discovered. "The crucial
point about permafrost is that it is cold, dark and lacks oxygen, which
is perfect for preserving biological material," Claverie told the
Observer last week. "You could put a yogurt in permafrost and it might
still be edible 50,000 years later." But [the world's permafrost is
changing. The upper layers of the planet's main reserves -- in Canada,
Siberia and Alaska -- are melting as climate change affects the Arctic
disproportionately.]{.underline} According to meteorologists, the region
is heating up several times faster than the average rate of increase in
global warming. However, it is not melting permafrost directly that
poses the most immediate risk, added Claverie. ["The danger comes from
another global warming impact: the disappearance of Arctic sea ice. That
is allowing increases in shipping, traffic and industrial development in
Siberia. Huge mining operations are being planned, and are going to
drive vast holes into the deep permafrost to extract oil and
ores]{.underline}. ["[Those operations will release vast amounts of
pathogens that still thrive]{.underline}]{.mark} [there. [Miners
will]{.mark} walk in and [breath the viruses. The effects could be
calamitous.]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} This point was stressed by
Koopmans. "[[If you look at the history of epidemic outbreaks, one of
the key drivers has been change in land use. Nipah virus was spread by
fruit bats who were driven from their habitats by humans.]{.mark}
Similarly[, monkeypox has been linked to the spread of urbanisation in
Africa.]{.mark} And that [is what we]{.mark} are about to [witness in
the Arctic: a complete change in land use, and that could be
dangerous]{.mark},]{.underline} as we have seen elsewhere." Scientists
believe that permafrost -- at its deepest levels -- may contain viruses
that are up to a million years old and so will be far older than our own
species, which is thought to have emerged about 300,000 years ago. "Our
immune systems may have never been in contact with some of those
microbes, and that is another worry," said Claverie. "The scenario of an
unknown virus once infecting a Neanderthal coming back at us, although
unlikely, has become a real possibility." For that reason, Claverie and
others are working with UArctic, the University of the Arctic -- an
international educational network in the polar region -- on plans to
establish quarantine facilities and provide medical expertise that could
pinpoint early cases and treat them locally to try to contain the
infection. "[[We now face a tangible threat and we need to be prepared
to deal with it.]{.mark} It is as simple as that."]{.underline}

#### International cooperation will be key to check these threats

and Responding to Global Health Security Risks from MICROBIAL THREATS IN
THE ARCTIC, THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES PRESS,
<https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25887/chapter/1>, SP

Dr. Jean-Michel Claverie, Aix-Marseille University & CNRS Mediterranean
Institute of Microbiology, provided insights on viruses in permafrost.
Dr. Claverie reemphasized that [24 percent of the northern]{.underline}
[hemisphere]{.underline} [contains]{.underline} [permafrost]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} most of this [is very old and contains ancient frozen
materials]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} [[Arctic]{.mark} is warming
faster than the rest of the world and leads to widespread permafrost
thaw]{.underline} (Tollefson, 2017). [This [thaw may lead to]{.mark}
additional natural consequences such as extremely large holes in the
ground where soil is sinking and may even trigger spontaneous
explosions]{.underline}.1 Dr. Claverie also pointed out that
[warmer]{.underline} [temp]{.underline}erature[s]{.underline} and
[open]{.underline} [shipping]{.underline} [lanes]{.underline} have
[made]{.underline} [large]{.underline} [industrial]{.underline}
[ventures]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [resource]{.underline}
[mining]{.underline} [viable]{.underline} in the Arctic region,
[which]{.underline} further [disrupts]{.underline}
[permafrost]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [associated]{.underline}
[[bacteria and microbes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Dr. Claverie discussed the
potential for permafrost thaw and changes to [the active
layer]{.underline} to [enable]{.underline} the [return]{.underline} [of
[anthrax outbreaks]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [traces of smallpox
virus]{.underline}, [and other pathogens from]{.underline}]{.mark}
[people and [materials buried in the permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Theves et al., 2014). [One example is the regen]{.underline}eration [of
30,000-year-old plants]{.underline} that were [buried]{.underline} [in
Siberian permafrost]{.underline} (Yashina et al., 2012). Given that
[plants]{.underline} [can]{.underline} [be]{.underline}
[revived]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the [permafrost]{.underline},
Dr. Claverie challenged participants to [consider if viruses could be
revived as well]{.underline}. He discussed [work]{.underline}
[at]{.underline} the [Stanchikovsky Yar]{.underline} exposure in
Chersky, Russia and the ancient permafrost that is [exposed]{.underline}
and can be accessed without digging through more recent materials. In
sampling this material, it can be tested for acanthamoeba-killing
viruses through a process that subjects the sample to antibiotic-adapted
acanthamoeba cultures, seeks cell lysis (or breakdown of the cell),
isolates the agent, and characterizes the infectious cycle, genomics,
transcriptomics, and proteomics. [These viruses can survive over long
time periods in permafrost]{.underline}. Two new, previously unknown
viruses were isolated from a single sample from this process (Legendre
et al., 2014, 2015). Dr. Claverie highlighted another example where a
research team was given access to a [skin and hair sample from frozen
mammoth]{.underline} remains recovered from the Yana Rhinoceros Horn
Site, Siberia (Pitulko et al., 2004). The sample [revealed]{.underline}
[four new viruses:]{.underline} (1) [ancient Megavirus, (2) ancient
Pandoravirus, (3) ancient Pithovirus, and (4) Asfar-like
virus]{.underline}. [Another]{.underline} [example]{.underline}
involving metagenomic2 sequencing of cores from the Yakutia region,
[revealed]{.underline} a large [diversity of bacteria as well as
β-lactamas genes, [a potential threat]{.mark} related [to bacterial
resistance to antibiotics]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[These]{.underline} [genes]{.underline} [could]{.underline} potentially
[be]{.underline} [transmitted]{.underline} [to modern bacteria as a new
way of resisting antibiotics]{.underline}. Most of [the]{.underline}
[viruses]{.underline} [detected]{.underline} [were]{.underline} already
[known and expected, but other viruses, less well known and in smaller
quantities, were detected as well. A]{.underline} final
[example]{.underline} [shared]{.underline} by Dr. Claverie illustrates
[the new, viable viruses discovered from Kolyma river]{.underline}
exposures and thawing permafrost in the region near Duvanny Yar and
Chersky[, in addition to three new viruses discovered from the Lena
river, one new virus from the thawed material, and four new viruses from
the Pleistocene]{.underline} (or \>11,700 years ago). He noted that
[these discoveries provide independent confirmation that some DNA
viruses can remain infectious since the end of the last glacial period.
A key issue]{.underline} that arises from the types of discoveries
shared by Dr. Claverie [is the need to ensure that the samples (and
associated data) are not contaminated by modern materials]{.underline}.
[[Understanding the]{.mark} possibility of a real [threat from pathogens
in permafrost is crucial]{.mark},]{.underline} [especially]{.underline}
[when]{.underline} [the topic receives]{.underline} a great deal of
[media attention]{.underline}. [Confirmation]{.underline} of the results
[can]{.underline} [be achieved through different sample sites, sample
types, and investigation methods.]{.underline} Dr. Claverie concluded
his remarks by [emphasizing that hazards from thawing permafrost depend
on the presence, viability, and resilience of known and unknown viruses
pathogenic for humans, animals, and plants]{.underline}. However[,
exposure will grow due to increased human presence in the warming Arctic
and potentially through increased permafrost disruption]{.underline}.
Therefore, [it could be useful for large-scale Arctic industrial
projects to include on-site medical surveillance as well as on-site
quarantine or isolation facilities and protocols]{.underline}. He also
suggested that [[research on pathogenic permafrost microbes]{.mark}
including protozoa [is important to move forward]{.mark},]{.underline}
yet it can be extremely difficult to export potentially infectious
samples out of the region. This [[highlights the importance of
international research partnerships]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[[In]{.mark} the field of [infectious diseases research, Science
Diplomacy is applied widely and plays a pivotal role]{.mark}
globally]{.underline} on a macroscale, as well as in the day-to-day work
of individual scientists. The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that
infectious diseases have no geo-political borders and has been a wake-up
call to scientists, policymakers and the public that Science [[Diplomacy
should be utilized efficiently to fight global health
crises]{.underline}.]{.mark} It was also a reminder that one nation or
community cannot operate in isolation to tackle a highly contagious and
deadly infectious disease, and that we are all only safe if we work
together. This collaborative effort should include infectious disease
researchers, healthcare professionals, government law makers, global
organizations and more importantly, the general public, working together
towards a common goal of achieving successful surveillance of disease
spread, along with robust treatment and prevention mechanisms to
mitigate disease. [[In]{.mark} the case of]{.underline} the Ebola, Zika
and [[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}-19 outbreaks, [[Science Diplomacy was
deployed to draw resources and experts from around the world to study
the disease, help tackle the spread of the disease, and test and invent
vaccines and treatment modalities.]{.underline}]{.mark} This global
[[coordination is critical during pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Although the measures that were taken were eventually significant to
slow the spread of the disease, vaccinate people and lower [[the death
toll,]{.underline}]{.mark} the COVID-19 pandemic [[has
shown]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[signs of failure of coordination
between science and diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, and a lack of proper
leadership at the global level to execute it. [[The slow transmission of
information between science and governments caused failures in slowing
the spread of the virus in its early stages]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
ability to communicate effectively across various disciplines and
stakeholders is a necessary tool for successful deployment of Science
Diplomacy. Policymakers often become aware of an issue and turn to
scientists for solutions only after the problem emerges and is at a
critical stage, rather than taking actions to prevent it by listening to
scientific warnings. For example, when COVID-19 emerged, policymakers
needed a solution quickly. Scientists have been warning of such
outbreaks for decades but the lack of awareness of policymakers in
scientific research, miscommunication and also in some cases
deliberately ignoring warnings cost a lot of lives globally. Therefore,
[in the future of Science Diplomacy, the successful involvement of
knowledge brokers and 'boundary spanners' to fill these gaps will
greatly improve global Science Diplomacy in the infectious disease
field]{.underline}. Moreover, it is imperative that academic
institutions prepare researchers not only for academic careers but also
expose them to experiences that prepare them to work across the
intersection of science and policymaking. As an academic scientist, I
have experienced the lack of knowledge in the communication between
science and policymaking. I believe that changing the academic curricula
to address miscommunication and knowledge gaps between scientists and
policymakers is critical. In my future career as an infectious disease
scientist, I plan to conduct projects through which science can
contribute to policy, and to collaborate with legislators and
policymakers across disciplines to produce policy relevant science.'

Several [**epidemics**, such as the Black Death and the Spanish
flu,]{.underline} [have]{.underline} [**threaten**ed]{.underline} **[human
life]{.underline}** [**throughout history**; however, it
is]{.underline} **[unclear]{.underline}** [if
humans]{.underline} [will]{.underline} **[remain]{.underline}** [safe
from the]{.underline} **[sudden]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[fast
spread of epidemic diseases]{.underline}**. Moreover, [the
transmission]{.underline} **[characteristics]{.underline}** [of
epidemics remain]{.underline} **[undiscovered]{.underline}**. In this
study, [we present]{.underline} the results of [**a**n
epidemic]{.underline} **[simulation experiment]{.underline}** [revealing
the]{.underline} [relationship between epidemic parameters and
pandemic]{.underline} [risk]{.underline}. To analyze the time-dependent
risk and impact of epidemics, we considered two parameters for
infectious diseases: the recovery time from infection and the
transmission rate of the disease. Based on the epidemic simulation, we
identified two important aspects of human safety with regard to the
threat of a pandemic. First, humans should be safe if the fatality rate
is below 100%. Second, even when the fatality rate is 100%, humans would
be safe if the average degree of human social networks is below a
threshold value.
Nevertheless, **[certain]{.underline}** [diseases]{.underline} **[can]{.underline}** potentially **[infect
all nodes in the
human]{.underline}** **[social]{.underline}** **[networks]{.underline}**,
and [these]{.underline} diseases [cause a pandemic when the average
degree is]{.underline} **[larger than the
threshold]{.underline}** [value. These]{.underline} results indicated
that certain infectious [diseases]{.underline} **[lead to human
extinction]{.underline}** and can be prevented by minimizing human
contact.

1\. Introduction

[The emergence of
a]{.underline} **[pandemic]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} one of the
various scenarios frequently discussed as [a]{.underline} **[human
extinction event]{.underline}**, and it is listed as [one of the
global]{.underline} **[catastrophic]{.underline}** [risks]{.underline} [in
studies regarding the future]{.underline} \[1,2,3\]. In
particular, [several]{.underline} pandemics, [such as
the]{.underline} **[Black Death]{.underline}** \[4,5\], [Spanish
flu]{.underline} \[6\], and those caused
by **[smallpox]{.underline}** \[7\], severe acute respiratory syndrome
(**[SARS]{.underline}**)
\[8\], [and]{.underline} **[Ebola]{.underline}** \[9\], [have affected
a]{.underline} **[large population]{.underline}** [throughout
history.]{.underline} [The risk of
pandemics]{.underline} **[increases]{.underline}** [with an increase in
population]{.underline} **[mobility]{.underline}** between cities,
nations, and continents,
thereby [threatening]{.underline} **[humankind]{.underline}** \[10,11,12\]. [It
is essential to analyze the epidemic spread
in]{.underline} **[society]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[minimize]{.underline}** the **[damage]{.underline}** from
epidemic disasters; however, extinctive epidemic spreading experiments
have limitations in real-world situations, as they predict stochastic
effects on the spread without considering the structure of human
society. Network-based approaches have been proposed to overcome these
limitations and perform epidemic spreading simulations by considering
the network structure of numerous real-world connections \[13,14,15\].
These methods use various models of epidemic spreading, such as the
susceptible--infectious--susceptible (SIS) \[16,17,18\],
susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) \[19,20,21\], and Watts
threshold models \[22\]. While these methods are mathematically
convenient, they are epidemiologically unrealistic for various
infections because they require exponentially distributed incubation and
infectious periods \[23,24,25\]. Moreover, previous epidemic studies did
not perform quantitative assessment of the pandemic risk depending on
the network connectivity in individuals and fatality rate of various
diseases \[26\].

In the present study, we applied an SIR epidemic model to a scale-free
network with Monte Carlo simulation to identify the quantitative
relationship between infectious diseases and human existence. Our
fundamental hypothesis states that [when the epidemic spreads to
all]{.underline} **[nodes]{.underline}** of the network and the fatality
rate is 100%, [it can increase
the]{.underline} **[pandemic]{.underline}** [risk]{.underline}. To
address this, we initially constructed a scale-free network to simulate
a society. Moreover, for the epidemic spreading simulation, an SIR model
was applied to the network to describe the immune state of an individual
after infection. From the simulation study, we found that the mean
degree of a scale-free network was an essential factor in determining
whether epidemics threaten humans. This approach provides important
insights into epidemic spreading analysis by investigating the
relationship between epidemic and scale-free network parameters.
Furthermore, it highlights the necessity of determining information flow
during an epidemic.

2\. Materials and Methods

[We designed an epidemic]{.underline} **[simulation
process]{.underline}** to identify the relationship between pandemic
risk and network parameters. This study was performed in four steps
(Figure 1): (i) generating a scale-free network model to reflect
real-world conditions; (ii) applying an SIR model to the scale-free
network for epidemic spreading simulations; (iii) adapting the Monte
Carlo method to reflect the stochastic process in the node status of the
SIR model; and (iv) iteratively performing simulation for every
parameter set and analyzing the results. We have provided the source
code and sample results of epidemic simulation in Supplementary
Materials.

Figure 1. Overview of epidemic simulation process based on the Monte
Carlo method. (A) We generated scale-free networks for a fixed
population (N = 1,000,000) and various node degrees (k = 2, 5, 7, and
10). (B) Epidemic spreading was simulated by applying a
susceptible--infectious--recovered (SIR) model to the scale-free
network. We set the epidemic parameters, β and γd. β represents the
spreading rate of epidemics, and γd is the reciprocal of γ and reflects
the time interval between infection and recovery. Randomly, 0.05% of
nodes were initially infected. (C) [We adapted the]{.underline} **[Monte
Carlo method]{.underline}** [to determine the status of the
transition]{.underline} from the infection node to immunization node.
Repeated simulations were performed until a steady state was achieved.
(D) For every parameter set, 10,000 simulations were performed.

2.1. Network Generation Based on a Scale-Free Model

We constructed a network model for the epidemic spreading simulation
(Figure 1). The nodes and edges of the network represent people in the
society and their physical contacts, respectively. We used a scale-free
network model, which follows the preferential attachment property
observed in numerous real-world networks, such as social networks,
physical systems, and economic networks \[27,28,29\]. In the scale-free
network, when a node is added to the network, its likelihood of
connecting to existing nodes increases with an increase in the node's
degree. Hub nodes, which lead to fast and vast spreading of epidemics,
exist. Two characteristic parameters, including N and k, affect the form
of scale-free networks. The parameter N denotes all nodes in the
network. In the real world, N indicates the whole population size. The
parameter k is the average degree of the network, which determines the
degree of the newly attached node for each step during network
generation. Following the characteristics of the network model, we
generated scale-free networks representing human contacts for epidemic
spread. The scale-free network was generated by the Barabasi--Albert
graph distribution, in which the network is constructed from a cycle
graph with three vertices, followed by the addition of k edges at each
construction step \[30\]. The k edges are randomly attached to the
vertex based on the degree distribution of the vertex. After network
generation, we investigated the degree distribution properties of the
network (Figure 2). The results indicate that the degree distributions
have similar tendency for networks with varying number of nodes and
edges. This study constructed scale-free networks with the largest
number of nodes considering computational complexity (N = 1,000,000).

\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]

Figure 2. Degree distribution of the scale-free network. We analyzed the
degree distribution of the network based on the number of nodes (N) and
mean degree (k).

2.2. Epidemic Spreading Based on the SIR Model

For the epidemic spreading simulations, we applied an SIR model to the
generated scale-free network. The classical SIR model can be expressed
by the following nonlinear differential equations \[21\]:

\[EQUATIONS OMITTED\]

where S, I, and R represent susceptible, infected, and recovered
compartments, respectively, in the whole population. S represents people
who have not been infected yet but can be infected in future. I
represents infected people who can spread the epidemic to susceptible
people through physical contact. R denotes people who have recovered or
died from the epidemic and who no longer participate in the epidemic
spreading process. The sum of the S, I, and R values represents the
whole population size N. Epidemics have two parameters in the SIR model,
transmission rate (β) and recovery rate (γ), which arise from the basic
reproduction number R0 (Figure 1B). The basic reproduction number is the
number of infections caused by one infective node \[31,32,33\]. If the
R0 is more than 1, the infection can spread in a population, whereas if
R0 is less than 1, the infection cannot spread. We express the basic
reproduction number as R0 = β/γ, where β represents the spreading rate
of epidemics between infective nodes and adjacent susceptible nodes and
γ represents the probability of recovery from infection \[34\]. We
mainly used γd, which is the reciprocal of γ and reflects the time
interval between infection and recovery.

2.3. Investigation of Epidemic Status Based on the Monte Carlo Method

The epidemic simulation was performed for a time series event by
constructing epidemic status matrix (z) to represent the status of the
nth node at time step t. For each node, the value of epidemic status
matrix at time step t can be 0, 1, or 2, indicating that a node is
susceptible, infective, or recovered, respectively. We initially (t = 0)
set every value of epidemic status matrix to 0 because all nodes are
susceptible before the epidemic spreads. At the initial infection stage,
randomly selected 0.05% of nodes were infected. At every time period, we
performed immunization and observed the infection stages (Figure 3).

\[FIGURE 3 OMITTED\]

At the immunization stage, we identified infective nodes and determined
whether these nodes would be recovered in the next time step. To
calculate the transition probability of infected and recovered
phenomena, the Monte Carlo method was applied \[35,36\]. When infection
and recovery parameters are provided, it is possible to investigate
whether a node transitions from an epidemic state to another state. To
accomplish this, we compared the method revealing the change in each
population in every compartment over time (Figure 4).

\[FIGURE 4 OMITTED\]

The final steady state of the epidemic spreading simulation model
indicates the total number of casualties of the epidemic who either are
dead or have recovered from the disease. Infective nodes at time t (zn
\[t\] = 1) are transformed to recovered nodes at time t + 1 (zn \[t +
1\] = 2) when 1/γd is larger than a random real number between 0 and 1.
We determined whether the neighbor nodes of the infection node would be
infected by identifying susceptible nodes adjacent to the infective
nodes at time t (zn \[t\] = 0, with the adjacent infective node) (Figure
5). When β is larger than a random real number between 0 and 1, a
susceptible node becomes an infective node at time t + 1 (zn \[t + 1\] =
1); this scenario represents epidemic spread. For each time step, we
recorded the number of susceptible, infective, and recovered nodes
during epidemic spread.

\[FIGURE 5 OMITTED\]

2.4. Simulation Parameters

We carried out simulation trials for various mean degrees of networks (k
= 2, 5, 7, and 10). Each network considered the following epidemic
parameters: β ranges from 0.05 to 0.95 and γd ranges from 1 to 10. The
Monte Carlo model was repeatedly simulated to observe saturation of the
recovery process. Considering that the simulation pipeline contains
random processes such as initial infection and Monte Carlo trials, we
performed the simulation iteratively until the status of nodes remained
unchanged. After simulation, time series data from every simulation were
interpolated in the time domain.

The fatality rate determines the ratio of deceased and recovered
individuals in the final population \[37,38,39\]. If the fatality rate
is below 100%, the recovered population contains both dead and recovered
individuals. Such a situation does not always cause a pandemic. In this
simulation, we assumed a 100% fatality rate. To accomplish this, we
enumerated the recovered nodes as dead for considering the pandemic
risk.

3\. Results

Through our method, we obtained epidemic spreading data with various
network and epidemic parameter sets. In the present study, we focused on
the case where the epidemic infects all nodes and defined this
phenomenon as "extinctive spread". [Diseases causing extinctive spread
are potential candidates of]{.underline} **[high pandemic
risk]{.underline}**. In the real world, [extinctive spreading
indicates]{.underline} that the [disease will]{.underline} **[infect
every person in the society]{.underline}**. From the simulation data, we
calculated the extinctive spread score by dividing the total number of
simulation trials by the number of extinctive spread cases. Thereafter,
we identified that the number of extinctive spread cases is mainly
influenced by spreading speed, which is determined by β, γd, and k
(Figure 6).

\[FIGURE 6 OMITTED\]

The extinctive spread region (brown area in Figure 6) is expanded as the
value of mean degree of network (k) is increased, thereby indicating
that the area of extinctive spread becomes noticeably wider in a dense
network than in a sparse network. Thus, the more contact between people,
the higher the risk of epidemics. Moreover, high γd and high β cause
extinctive spread across a large region, indicating that the high
spreading rate and short time interval between infection and recovery
are risk factors of epidemic diseases. In contrast, the infective nodes
recover before they transmit the disease to their neighbors in low β and
low γd scenarios, thus disconnecting the network and preventing
extinctive spread. This occurs because the infective nodes need more
time to transmit the disease in low β and high γd scenarios. Therefore,
the disease begins to subside due to a lack of new infective nodes.

Furthermore, we investigated the range of β and γd for existing
epidemics of the common cold \[40,41\] and fatal diseases, namely,
cholera \[42,43\], Marburg \[44,45\], Ebola (Congo and Uganda)
\[46,47,48,49\], SARS \[50\], and MERS \[51\] (Table 1). We selected
diseases with relatively well-known epidemic parameters, such as average
duration of infection and basic number of reproductions from previous
studies. Transmission rates were calculated using the mean duration of
infectious periods and basic reproduction numbers of the epidemics.
Different studies reveal multiple values of infectious period and
transmission rate for some of these diseases; we considered these values
separately \[40,41,42,43,46,47,48,49\]. For example, the infectious
period of a common cold is from 3 to 7 days and that of Ebola is 6.5
days. Next, we placed the possible regions of these epidemics as a
disease band for various k values (colored lines in Figure 6). When k \>
5, fatal diseases have an opportunity to cause a pandemic. Even when k =
5, diseases such as cholera and Ebola (Congo) can be threatening in
regions of low γd and high, thus demonstrating that the knowledge of
network parameters of the society and the characteristics of epidemic
diseases can aid in quantifying the risk of epidemics.

4\. Discussion

[Many]{.underline} **[previous]{.underline}** [studies have
made]{.underline} **[stochastic]{.underline}** [SIR models to analyze
the dynamics or stability of epidemic diseases]{.underline}. They
investigated the distribution of susceptible, infected, and removed
populations for specific epidemic disease spreading, such as cholera,
SARS, Marburg, and MERS, based on mathematical modelling
\[52,53,54,55\]. [However, they did not conduct
a]{.underline} **[quantitative]{.underline}** [assessment of pandemic
risk]{.underline} [taking into account]{.underline} **[physical contact
between people]{.underline}**. To solve this limitation, we performed
epidemic spreading simulations by applying an SIR model to scale-free
networks with Monte Carlo simulation. In the simulation, [we
consider]{.underline} **[various]{.underline}** [connectivity
and]{.underline} **[disease]{.underline}** [characteristics]{.underline} on
scale-free networks. For each network and epidemic parameter set, the
probability of extinctive spread was calculated. [The
results]{.underline} [**reveal**ed that]{.underline} **[certain
infectious diseases can lead to extinction]{.underline}**. Moreover,
even if the disease band extends over the extinctive spread regions, it
does not indicate that human extinction results from the disease, as the
fatality rate is below 100%; however, in the case of 100% fatality, the
disease can cause a human extinction event. The risk of infectious
disease is influenced by the network structure. A dense network has a
higher risk of spreading infectious disease than a sparse network, as we
observed in the extinctive spreading maps. According to our results,
when the average degree of human social networks is below the risk
threshold, i.e., less than 4 in this study, human society is safe from
an extinctive outbreak based on our knowledge regarding the epidemic
parameters of the infectious disease. Nevertheless, in other
cases, **[human extinction]{.underline}** [is possible]{.underline}. For
example, if the population is 1,000,000 and there are 4 or more
instances of physical contact between people, human extinction events
may occur, depending on the fatality rate of the epidemics. Hence,
physical contact between people is closely related to an extinction
event of infectious diseases. Eventually, from a public health
perspective, lowering the average contact level of society is an
appropriate way to increase the robustness of strategies against the
occurrence of extinction. In the real world, reducing network density
can be accomplished by epidemic prevention activity, such as isolation
and quarantine treatment. This action prevents epidemic risk to the
society, thereby avoiding human extinction.

Additional considerations may improve our analysis. First, large
population size and various proportions of initial infective nodes were
not considered in the experiments. We have confirmed that the result was
consistent when the proportion of initial infective nodes was 0.05% of
the total population; however, this can vary depending on the distinct
proportion of initial infective nodes in a different population. To
achieve robust results, we need to perform additional experiments for
various parameters; however, we could not address this issue due to
computational complexity. Second, we did not consider numerous known
epidemic diseases. We calculated the transmission rates of epidemic
diseases using the known infectious periods and reproduction numbers of
the epidemics from evidence in the literature. In the present study, we
only considered five epidemic diseases, since the information on
infectious periods and reproduction numbers of diseases was mostly
unavailable for other epidemic diseases. Third, this study only
considers the SIR model on scale-free networks in epidemic simulation.
Since the dynamics of epidemic diseases can be varied in different
models or networks, it is important to experiment in various simulation
environments to confirm the robustness of the results. Nevertheless,
these limitations can be considered in future experiments or using
improved computational methods. With these further improvements, our
approach can be used as a computational tool to analyze the risk of
epidemic diseases.

5\. Conclusions

In this study, we analyzed the risk of epidemic diseases by creating an
epidemic simulation on a scale-free network. [Based on
the]{.underline} **[simulation results]{.underline}** for various
epidemic
parameters, [we]{.underline} **[confirmed]{.underline}** that **[certain]{.underline}** [infectious
diseases]{.underline} **[can lead to extinction]{.underline}** and can
be prevented by minimizing human contact. We believe
that [identifying]{.underline} potential **[candidate]{.underline}** [diseases]{.underline} that
may lead to human
extinction [is]{.underline} **[crucial]{.underline}** [in addressing
epidemic prevention activities]{.underline} such as quarantine.

For the Royal Navy to have more of something than the US Navy is
unusual, but it does happen and one example is icebreakers. The RN has
one, HMS Protector -- and the USN has none. [America does actually have
three icebreakers proper and various icebreaking tugs but these belong
to the US Coast Guard]{.underline}. Pedantry, you'll say, but you have
to brag about something when you're at sea for months on end. In any
case, as a former captain of HMS Endurance -- the icebreaker we had
before Protector -- my interest was piqued when [President Trump stated
a few days ago that "we're going to order about 40 big
icebreakers."]{.underline} There are [plenty]{.underline} of sound
[reasons for him to say this]{.underline}. First, [the US -- Navy or
Coast Guard]{.underline}, it doesn't matter -- [clearly doesn't have an
adequate icebreaker fleet]{.underline}. The [US is a maritime
nation]{.underline} and more, [an Arctic one]{.underline}, [but they
have let this capability wither]{.underline}. The Polar Security Cutter
([PSC]{.underline}) programme [announced in April 2019 is set to deliver
three new Coast Guard icebreakers]{.underline} but [Trump clearly
believes this is not enough]{.underline}. And he's probably right. The
requirement to work in and around ice will only become more important
over time. We [tend to think of icebreakers in terms of]{.underline} the
[High North and the Antarctic]{.underline}, [but that's to forget the
Great Lakes]{.underline}, [which are very icy in winter and carry a lot
of trade]{.underline}. According to [the Lake Carriers'
Association]{.underline}, [inadequate icebreaking resources in the Great
Lakes could inflict up to a billion dollars of damage to the US economy
and cost a lot of jobs]{.underline}. Another area where the winter ice
is of great importance is, of course, the Baltic -- Russia has retained
its exclave of Kaliningrad specifically because St Petersburg ices up.
Then with Russia and China collaborating (sort of) in the High North,
and new resource discoveries in the Southern Ocean seemingly every
month, the requirement for ice capable ships is increasing. [The number
40 could be just Trumpian negotiation]{.underline} -- say 40, get ten.
[Or it could be intended to match up to the Russian icebreaker
fleet]{.underline}, the [world's biggest and most powerful]{.underline}.
Russia also has the most heavily armed ice-class surface ship in the
world, the Nikolay Zubov, with more of her class building. [Given
current US shipbuilding woes it seems unlikely that America could build
all 40 of its new icebreakers]{.underline}. But [only last summer the
Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE]{.underline}) was [signed to
combine the skills of the US, Canada and Finland]{.underline} (the Finns
build a majority of the world's icebreakers) '[to lead to better prices
and speedier deliveries']{.underline}. So collaboration is on the cards.
The other question is what is meant by 'big icebreakers'. 'Big' is not a
recognised icebreaker category. But we have to be careful here because
when it comes to ice vessel categories there are many and, needless to
say, they differ from place to place. Heavy, Medium, Light,
Multipurpose, Coastal and Ice-capable are regularly used description
with the heaviest capable of breaking ice up to 6 metres. My old ship
HMS Endurance was a Lloyds class 1A which meant she was cleared to break
first-year ice up to one metre thick at speeds of up to three knots. She
was therefore considered 'light'. She didn't feel it getting in and out
of harbour, but there we are. At the top of the hierarchy, there are
nuclear powered ice breakers. Only Russia has these. If you're going to
take on the cost of nuclear propulsion at sea, you need to have good
reasons. The very largest aircraft carriers, and submarines, provide
such good reasons. For most other types of ship, nuclear power isn't
justified as almost unlimited power does not mean unlimited speed --
that has a hard limit determined by the hull form, beyond which you can
use more and more thrust but achieve only a tiny bit more speed. But in
an icebreaker, having large amounts of extra thrust available is very
useful. The fact that a nuclear ship only needs refuelling at years-long
intervals (or these days, perhaps not at all in her entire service life)
is also a good thing if you get stuck. This is easier to do than one
might imagine -- particularly if you end up in a sheet that is thicker
than you anticipated and, crucially, which can't move out of the way as
you saw through it. If you do get stuck, applying astern propulsion to
extricate yourself brings the ice you just broke alarmingly close to
your propeller. HMS Endurance carried enough fuel to circumnavigate the
globe, not for that purpose but because that's what you would need to
maintain power -- and so to survive -- if you ended up 'wintering over'
by mistake. The history of previous ships of the name, and our own
seamanship, made us keen to avoid that. Russia has eight behemoth
nuclear icebreakers (seven are operational; one struck a cargo ship it
was supposed to be escorting last Sunday) but given that Congress
approved just three conventionally powered Polar Security Cutters (and
even those are proving expensive) and [none of Trump's new 40 are
currently funded]{.underline}, I think we can take nuclear propulsion
off the table as far as the US is concerned. Overall, however, the
[desire for the US to build more icebreakers is sound]{.underline}. You
can read Trump's announcement of 40 ships as 'positive', 'excessive' or
'menacing' depending on your bias, but the [overall notion is entirely
sensible as is his increased focus on shipbuilding
generally]{.underline}. The [requirement to operate in icy seas will
only increase over the coming years and these are the best ships to do
so safely]{.underline}.

#### US icebreakers falling behind Russia and China

**Potter 24** \[Brian Potter; Senior Infrastructure Fellow at IFP and
author of the Construction Physics newsletter; "Why the U.S. Can't Build
Icebreaking Ships";
https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-the-us-cant-build-icebreaking;
noodle☺\]

Because polar bodies of water are often covered in ice, accessing these
regions by ship requires specially designed ships which can break up the
ice and create a path for other ships to follow. The need for
icebreaking vessels will remain even as climate change reduces the
extent of sea ice: paradoxically, as new polar routes become accessible
and sea ice becomes more mobile, the demand for icebreakers is likely to
increase. [Russia has an aging fleet of more than 40 icebreakers, with
several under construction. China has somewhere between 5 and 7
icebreakers]{.underline} (depending on exactly how you define
"icebreaker"), with more under construction.1 [The U.S., on the other
hand, has allowed its icebreaking capabilities to wither.]{.underline}
The Coast Guard has handled all U.S. icebreaking since 1966, and
estimates that it [needs 8-9 polar icebreakers]{.underline} (4-5 heavy
and 4-5 medium) to fulfill its needs. [But it currently has only
two]{.underline}: the heavy icebreaker Polar Star, and the medium
icebreaker Healy. [The U.S. hasn't built a heavy icebreaker since
1976.]{.underline} In fact, no existing U.S. shipyard has built a heavy
polar icebreaker since before 1970. A 2017 National Academies report
stated that "[The nation is ill-equipped to protect its interests and
maintain leadership in these regions and has fallen behind other Arctic
nations]{.underline}, which have mobilized to expand their access to
ice-covered regions." And [while the U.S. is trying to remedy this with
a Polar Security Cutter]{.underline} program to build a series of new
heavy polar icebreakers (to be followed by a series of medium
icebreakers), [the program is going poorly]{.underline}. When the
contract was first awarded in 2019, the plan was to have the first
icebreaker completed by 2024. But as of July this year, the design of
the ship was still incomplete. [If]{.underline} and when [the ships are
completed (currently 2029 for the first vessel at the earliest), they
are expected to cost \$1.7-1.9 billion apiece, roughly four to five
times what a comparable ship would cost to build elsewhere.]{.underline}
Icebreakers, then, are another unfortunate example of the costs
inflicted by binding national interests to an inefficient shipbuilding
industry.

### Icebreakers K2 Arctic Control 

#### Icebreakers are key to US control of Arctic-Arctic infrastructure useless without them

**Greenwood 22** (Jeremy, macroeconimist at Upenn,"Without Icebreakers,
Arctic Infrastructure Won\'t Matter,"
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/without-icebreakers-arctic-infrastructure-wont-matter/)

[The United States]{.underline} [is]{.underline} woefully
[behind]{.underline} its fellow Arctic States [in building and
maintaining]{.underline} a world-class fleet of
[icebreakers]{.underline} and, thanks to various issues^4)^ and
construction delays,^5)^ [it might be another five years or more until
the Coast Guard's first new Polar Security Cutter (PSC)6) is fully
operational and breaking ice in the Arctic]{.underline}. In the
meantime, Arctic shipping will continue to increase,^7)^ fish stocks
will flow further North,^8)^ and continental shelves^9)^ will continue
to be exploited for more resources. With all of this activity, [the
demand for Arctic infrastructure will grow]{.underline}, especially
deepwater ports capable of servicing the ships engaged in these
expanding fields. [But without icebreakers, building all of this
infrastructure is a bit like hosting a baseball game without any
bats]{.underline}. [Icebreakers are key to the maritime transportation
system and infrastructure]{.underline} of the Great Lakes^10)^ and New
England,^11)^ [clearing the way for vital heating oil shipments and
critical goods]{.underline} throughout both regions. With planning and a
bit of luck, Alaska will join the robust economic activity that these
regions enjoy. There was a brief glimmer of hope that this issue was
being taken seriously in the Trump Administration when it released a
seemingly potent 2020 memorandum^12)^ on safeguarding U.S. national
interests at both poles. The memo breathed fresh life into the effort to
accelerate the U.S. Coast Guard's icebreaker acquisition program, while
seeking bridging solutions to fill the gaps until that acquisition
program could be completed, including a novel effort to lease
icebreakers^13)^ from fellow Arctic State and strategic partner,
Finland. Unfortunately, like many efforts, both good and bad, during
that Administration, they failed to "stick the landing". The effort died
with little result or change in trajectory. [The U.S. Coast Guard's
plans to build a new fleet of heavy and medium icebreakers in U.S.
shipyards is a sound strategic decision]{.underline} and deserves
sustained funding from Congress for the long-term. [The United States
must rebuild America's heavy icebreaker shipyard capacity at all
costs]{.underline}. But, the lack of any sound bridging plan to begin
consistent year-round icebreaker operations in the U.S. Arctic in 2022
is alarming. As an Arctic State and superpower, [the United States
should not rely on one elderly heavy icebreaker,]{.underline}14) [POLAR
STAR]{.underline}, which is also committed to annual Antarctic
operations that occupy all of its service life in a given year, and one
medium aging icebreaker,^15)^ HEALY, which was designed primarily for
scientific missions. [A bridging solution]{.underline}, regardless of
its short-term expense and logistical nightmares, [would allow the
United]{.underline} [States to immediately sustain a year-round maritime
domain awareness in the Arctic]{.underline}, provide search and rescue
capability to remote areas, and train more Coast Guard personnel in the
dangerous and niche nature of polar icebreaking. This experience,
training, and presence will only serve to well-equip the nation for a
much-needed investment in the U.S. Arctic and ensure that it is walking
before having to run to catch up with infrastructure investment and
increased shipping. What could a bridging solution look like? [It could
include a mix of the following: a foreign leased or purchased icebreaker
with known capabilities]{.underline} (with proper Congressional
engagement and re-flagging in the United States), a partnership with an
Arctic ally or partner that has icebreaker capacity, expediting PSC
construction currently underway, a massive investment in POLAR STAR and
HEALY to ensure that they can perform the mission flawlessly for the
near future, or freeing up POLAR STAR from Antarctic duties to focus on
the U.S. Arctic.

#### US must have icebreakers to maintain its presence in the Arctic

**Rascoe and Rybski 24** (Ayesha, Peter, retired US naval officer, "The
U.S. is falling behind in the competition for \'control\' of the
Arctic,"
https://www.npr.org/2024/11/24/nx-s1-5198510/the-u-s-is-falling-behind-in-the-competition-for-control-of-the-arctic)

[Why are icebreakers]{.underline}, then, [important]{.underline}? Is it
[because, even though the ice is receding, the waters are
still]{.underline} pretty kind of [treacherous]{.underline} or difficult
to traverse? RYBSKI: Yes, that\'s exactly it. Just because there\'s more
open ice doesn\'t mean you don\'t have to break the ice through some of
the areas or, you know, keep the ice out of the way. Sort of
paradoxically, I mean, [the]{.underline} [more open ice you have, the
more ships you have]{.underline}. [And then to keep those vessels safe
and to get them through some of the stickier parts, you need more
icebreakers or ice-capable vessels to do it.]{.underline} RASCOE: Well,
let me ask you about that because the subject of icebreakers came up at
a recent congressional hearing, and I gather that the U.S. Coast Guard
has just two in operation. Why does the U.S. Coast Guard only have two,
and how does that compare with Russia and China? RYBSKI: That\'s right.
At the moment, the U.S. Coast Guard has two polar-capable icebreakers.
And really, for quite a long time, up until this traffic really took
off, most of what the U.S. Coast Guard was doing with their icebreakers
was supporting scientific research missions. And for that, two vessels
was largely sufficient. But they realized that [in order to patrol all
this area and to ensure that the Navy - should it need to - have access
to the Arctic or the Antarctic waters when they\'re ice-covered, they
would need to have eight or nine vessels.]{.underline} So they started a
program to do so, but it\'s not going so well. People often like to
compare the numbers because it\'s quite stark. I mean, Russia has -
depending on who you talk to and how you - where you draw the line on
what is an icebreaker - you know, 40 to 55 ice-capable vessels that are
operating. But realistically, they have a need to. I mean, they use a
northern sea route to move goods between their own ports. So I don\'t
think the numbers themselves tell the whole story. Rather, it\'s can we
do what we need to do and ensure that the Navy has access should it need
it? RASCOE: So this summer, the U.S. did sign an agreement with Canada
and Finland to increase collaboration on building icebreakers. How
significant might that be, especially in terms of increasing the fleet
of icebreakers? RYBSKI: I think it could be significant, but at this
stage, it\'s too early to tell. I know that the Finns think that they
have the expertise and the ability to help us acquire vessels. But right
now, the indications that I\'ve seen is [that the U.S. Coast Guard wants
to build all of its icebreakers in the United States.]{.underline}
RASCOE: I guess, why is the U.S. industry struggling to do this? RYBSKI:
I think there are two reasons. First is that we haven\'t built an
icebreaker in the U.S. - a heavy icebreaker - since the 1970s. And they
require a lot of special metals because the hull has to be pretty
strong, which requires some welding techniques that our shipyards are
struggling with trying to learn. And basically, we just haven\'t done it
in a while. The second part is that the technology has changed. In the
1970s, icebreakers - like, their ability to break ice was determined by
two things. There\'s the shape of their hull and how powerful their
engines were. But now [modern icebreakers]{.underline} using something
called azimuth propulsion - they\'re just little pods that spin around.
They [can break ice in a different manner that requires less engine
power. And so we\'re trying to build a modern icebreaker as well,
something that hasn\'t been done in the United States.]{.underline}
RASCOE: What might be the consequences if the U.S. doesn\'t increase its
presence in the Arctic? RYBSKI: Well, at the rate we\'re headed,
[one]{.underline} of our [icebreakers]{.underline} is, I mentioned, [is
over 50 years old]{.underline}, and it spends half of its time in
drydock being repaired so it can support the mission. [So if we have a
casualty or a mechanical problem, we\'ll have no presence in the Arctic,
which, from a national security standpoint, means that we can\'t be
present to keep an eye on what Russia or China may be doing up there.
And if we can\'t see it and we can\'t patrol it, then we can\'t control
our own waters.]{.underline}

The icebreaker Aiviq is a gas guzzler with a troubled history. The ship
was built to operate in the Arctic, but it has a type of propulsion
system susceptible to failure in ice. Its waste and discharge systems
weren't designed to meet polar code, its helicopter pad is in the wrong
place to launch rescue operations and its rear deck is easily swamped by
big waves. On its maiden voyage to Alaska in 2012, the 360-foot vessel
lost control of the Shell Oil drill rig it was towing, and Coast Guard
helicopter crews braved a storm to pluck 18 men off the wildly lurching
deck of the rig before it crashed into a rocky beach. An eventual Coast
Guard investigation faulted bad decision-making by people in charge but
also flagged problems with the Aiviq's design. But for all this, the
same Coast Guard bought the Aiviq for \$125 million late last year. The
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
urgently **[[needs new icebreakers]{.mark} in an era when climate change
is bringing [increased traffic to the Arctic, including military patrols
near U.S. waters by Russia and China]{.mark}]{.underline}.** That the
first of the revamped U.S. fleet is a secondhand vessel a top Coast
Guard admiral once said "may, at best, marginally meet our requirements"
is a sign of how long the country has tried and failed to build new
ones. It's also a sign of how much sway political donors can have over
Congress. Edison Chouest, the Louisiana company that built the
icebreaker, has contributed more than \$7 million to state and national
parties, to political action committees and super PACS, and to members
of key House and Senate committees since 2012. Chouest spent most of
that period looking to unload the vessel after Shell, its intended user,
walked away. Members who received money from Chouest pressured the Coast
Guard to rent or buy the Aiviq from the company. One U.S. representative
from Alaska, where the ship will be stationed, told an admiral in a 2016
hearing that his service's objections were "bullshit." And there would
be even tougher pressures to come. It's now been a dozen years since the
Aiviq set out on its first mission to Alaska, long enough for its
troubles to fade from public memory. The ship, though owned and operated
by Chouest, was part of Shell's Arctic fleet, designed for a specific
role: as a tugboat that could tow Shell's 250-foot-tall polar drill rig,
the Kulluk, around the coast of Alaska and help anchor it in the waters
of the Far North. At its christening ceremony in Louisiana, attended by
Shell executives, U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and U.S. Rep. Steve
Scalise of Louisiana, it was named after the Iñupiaq word for walrus. As
a journalist, I'd been following the oil company's multibillion-dollar
play in the warming Arctic with interest. One June morning in 2012, I
got word that Shell was on the move near my Seattle home, so I sped to a
narrow point in Puget Sound with a good view of passing traffic. It was
sunny, the water calm. The Aiviq bobbed past with Kulluk in tow. The
icebreaker's paint --- blue at the time --- was fresh, its hull shiny.
It looked capable. The problems began once the Aiviq was out of view. A
Coast Guard report said that while the ship towed the Kulluk northward
through an Arctic storm, waves crashed over its rear deck and poured
into interior spaces, which investigators determined may have caused it
to list up to 20 degrees to one side. The water damaged cranes, heaters
and firefighting equipment, and the vents to the fuel system were
submerged. On its way back from Alaska's Beaufort Sea two months later,
the Aiviq suffered an electrical blackout, and one of its engines
failed, necessitating a repair in Dutch Harbor in Alaska's Aleutian
Islands. Then the Aiviq and Kulluk set out on a wintertime voyage back
to Seattle. The National Weather Service issued a gale warning
predicting 15-foot seas and 40-knot winds. The sailors aboard the Aiviq
and Kulluk exchanged worried messages. The cable with which the Aiviq
was towing the Kulluk came free two days later when a shackle broke. The
icebreaker's captain made a U-turn in heavy swells to hook up an
emergency tow line, and water again poured over its deck and into the
fuel vents. The Aiviq's four diesel engines soon began to fail, one
after another. Although a Chouest engineer later testified that an
unknown fuel additive must have caused the failures, Coast Guard
investigators believe the likely cause was "fuel contamination by
seawater." They said the fuel system's design, which they described as
substandard, made contamination more likely. The Aiviq and Kulluk were
reattached --- but now, and for the next two days, adrift. Storms pushed
them ever closer toward land. By the time the engines were repaired, it
was too late. The Kulluk ran aground at an uninhabited island off
Kodiak, Alaska, on New Year's Eve. Shell's Arctic dreams began to
unravel. The oil company sold its drill rig off for scrap. (It did not
respond to a request for comment.) And the Aiviq? A month after the
accident, I visited Kodiak to report on what went wrong. I saw it
anchored in the safety of a protected bay, an expensive, purpose-built
ship now stripped of its purpose. Shell formally abandoned its Arctic
efforts in 2015, after failing to find oil. The Aiviq eventually steamed
back south. Chouest began looking around for someone to take the
troubled icebreaker off its hands. The Coast Guard, which had criticized
the ship's role in the Kulluk accident, now became a potential customer.
**[[Traffic]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the warming Arctic **[[has
surged]{.mark} as countries eye the region's natural resources, and [it
will grow]{.mark} all the more]{.underline}** if the storied Northwest
Passage melts enough to become a viable route for freight in the decades

**[U.S. [icebreaker fleet is deteriorating]{.mark}]{.underline}.** The
Coast Guard began raising alarms about the problem decades ago, starting
with a study published in 1984**. [[Russia, with its extensive northern

**[[report]{.mark} to Congress [in 2010
highlighted]{.mark}]{.underline}** what has become known as the
**"[[icebreaker gap]{.underline}": [If we didn't quickly start building
new ships, our existing icebreakers could go out of commission before
replacements were ready]{.underline}]{.mark}. The study called for at
least six new icebreakers. Subsequent Coast Guard [[analysis has called
for eight or nine. To date, the United States has built
zero.]{.underline} [Congress dragged its feet]{.underline}]{.mark}** for
years on funding icebreaker construction. But the Coast Guard also
slowed progress with overly **[[optimistic
timelines]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[fuzzy cost]{.underline}]{.mark}**
estimates and a **[[tendency to keep fiddling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with new designs, according to a 2023 Government Accountability Office
report. More than a decade in, construction on the first of the new
ships has finally just begun. The Coast Guard's latest cost estimate is
\$1 billion per icebreaker, while the Congressional Budget Office last
year put it at \$1.6 billion to \$1.9 billion. Icebreakers have "been
the penultimate studied-to-death subject for 40 years," said Lawson
Brigham, a former Coast Guard heavy icebreaker commander who has a
doctorate from Cambridge University and has researched polar shipping
since the 1980s. The longer the Coast Guard failed to build the ships it
did want, the more pressure it faced to settle for one it didn't.
Chouest seized the opportunity. The company invited Coast Guard officers
to tour the Aiviq as early as 2016 and soon sent over a lease proposal

### More Icebreakers Needed

#### US must invest in icebreakers- Xi and Putin already gained the edge

The U.S. Coast Guard says the United States is an Arctic nation. Its
2019 Arctic Strategic Outlook says: "The United States is an Arctic
nation, and as America's maritime presence the Coast Guard maintains an
enduring responsibility for the national security and economic
prosperity of the Arctic." Yet observers say [if the U.S. wants to be
taken seriously as an Arctic nation, it needs to step up its focus and
investment in the region. One large investment]{.underline} being
scrutinized right now [is in icebreakers]{.underline} -- critical for
transportation of heating oil and other commerce, for defense and
military exercises, for rescue missions, etc[. The Arctic is a maritime
region and without icebreakers, there is no year-round existence. The
U.S. has two icebreakers that are out of date and often out of
service.]{.underline} It ordered three new icebreakers five years ago to
supplement its small fleet that can cut through Arctic ice. One of the
two existing icebreakers, USCGC Healy, canceled its summer mission in
August this year and was out of commission for several months following
a fire. This was Healy's second fire in recent years: it was previously
taken out of commission when it caught fire in 2020. The U.S. Coast
Guard's other icebreaker, USCGC Polar Star, was commissioned in 1976.
The ship's operational life has been extended through four phases to
keep it running, though it is well beyond its expected operational life.
(note: The Coast Guard, part of Homeland Security, operates the ice
breakers, not the Navy, part of the Department of Defense.) Upgrading
the U.S. icebreaker fleet Observers and Arctic experts [say it is clear
the U.S. needs to upgrade its icebreaker fleet to be taken seriously in
the region. Most other countries adjacent to the Arctic operate more
icebreakers.]{.underline} [It has been reported and estimated that
Russia has more than 40, seven of which are powered by]{.underline}
on-board [nuclear reactors.]{.underline} China, which says it is a
"near-Arctic state", is said to have three icebreakers with at least one
more due for delivery in 2025. Other estimates say Finland -- which
builds 60% of the world's icebreakers -- has 12, while Sweden has five,
and Norway has two. [An Arctic nation with a small and outdated fleet
that wants to play an influential role in the region would likely want a
new icebreaker as soon as possible]{.underline}. Yet five years after
commissioning the three new icebreakers, and with the estimated budget
of less than \$2 billion now expected to more than double, the shipyard
with the mandate, Bollinger Shipyards, hasn't yet begun to build the
ships. Louisiana-based Bollinger, which acquired the Mississippi-based
shipyard with the original mandate, did not respond to requests for
comment. ["If the US wants to be the most powerful nation and match up
to other nations, it needs an icebreaker.]{.underline} Russia and China
have newer and more operational icebreakers, so the U.S. should want
them, too," said Mads Qvist Frederiksen, Director of the Arctic Economic
Council. Malte Humpert, Founder and Senior Fellow of The Arctic
Institute, said: "The U.S. hasn't built a ship like this in more than 40
years. That's one of the main obstacles it's currently facing. Another
obstacle is that so few U.S. states care about this. Alaska does,
Mississippi does because that's where the shipyard is, and maybe the
west coast because that's where the Coast Guard ports are. But that's
it." The Biden administration announced the Icebreaker Collaboration
Effort, or ICE Pact, with Canada and Finland in July this year. The
announcement said the three Arctic countries would "collaborate on the
production of polar icebreakers and other capabilities..." Adding: "This
collaboration is intended to strengthen the shipbuilding industry and
industrial capacity of each nation -- and build closer security and
economic ties among our countries through information exchange and
mutual workforce-development focused on building polar icebreakers, as
well as other Arctic and polar capabilities." The cooperation appears to
be moving forward. A Finnish news report says a memorandum of
understanding is due to be signed imminently. Russia and China [The move
was said to support U.S. allies' icebreaker manufacturing, build US
icebreaker expertise, and pre-empt Russia and China's efforts to become
leaders in building icebreakers.]{.underline} Humpert at The Arctic
Institute said: "The Arctic contributes a small percentage to the U.S.
economy, and Alaska oil revenue has been declining, which had been a
large contributor. While in Russia, the Arctic contributes about 20% to
its economy. Russia's economic future lies in the Arctic."
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping, President of China, in 2014 [said that China
wants to be one of "the great polar powers". Russia's role and
aspirations in the Arctic are clear from its geography and large
icebreaker fleet.]{.underline} Jake Sullivan, the U.S. National Security
Advisor, said on the day the ICE Pact was announced: "...authoritarian
nations that are making or offering the icebreakers to the world want to
corner the icebreaker market. We're determined to have democracies be in
the lead in producing icebreaking capabilities." Arctic Today asked the
U.S. Coast Guard what it expected from this trilateral arrangement. A
spokesman said in a statement: ["The Coast Guard will continue to
monitor ICE Pact as it develops; however, it does not anticipate any
immediate impact to ongoing Coast Guard acquisitions.]{.underline} The
PSC \[Polar Security Cutter\] remains a top acquisition priority for the
Coast Guard, and is vital to project U.S. sovereignty and protect
economic, environmental, and national security interests in the high
latitudes." Rockford Weitz, Director of Maritime Studies at Fletcher
School at Tufts University, said the arrangement means the U.S. should
benefit from Canada's and Finland's icebreaker expertise. Weitz added:
"The good news for the ICE Pact is that the Canadians and the Finns have
been building icebreakers successfully for the commercial market. \[The
U.S.\] can leverage that for huge gain." That assumes the US takes the
Arctic as seriously as Jake Sullivan and the U.S. Coast Guard's website
says it does. Not everyone is convinced. "In the past, the U.S. probably
believed that it didn't really need icebreakers to support its economy,"
Frederiksen at the Arctic Economic Council says. "If the U.S. wants to
take the Arctic seriously, then [they need to invest in icebreakers not
just for science purposes but also for their security and growing their
economy in the north."]{.underline}

Winter is coming early this year in the Arctic. Last month, a [Chinese
and Russian joint surface action group came within 75 nautical miles of
Kiska Island, Alaska]{.underline}. [In response, the Coast Guard
mobilized a patrol to monitor the ships]{.underline} as they approached
American home waters. [A year prior, several Chinese warships had
entered the U.S. exclusive economic zone off Alaska]{.underline}. These
repeated tests of American resolve so close to our shores should set off
alarm bells in Washington. Our two greatest adversaries, [[China and
Russia, are]{.mark} now [cooperating]{.mark} on the high seas [to
challenge our presence in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chinese and
Russian [attempts to gain superiority in the Arctic are not
new]{.underline}. In 2015, five Chinese vessels marked President Barack
Obama's visit to the Bering Sea with battle drills off the Alaskan
coast. Russia has long maintained a strong military presence in the
Arctic, even after the end of the Cold War. What is different now,
[however]{.underline}, is that [our [rivals' power projection in the
polar regions is outpacing our own]{.mark}]{.underline}. As a
self-described "near-Arctic power," [[China has been working to
build]{.underline}]{.mark} a "Polar Silk Road" of [[economic and
military infrastructure]{.mark} across the Arctic]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [[Russia is developing]{.mark} its already-formidable
[capabilities to disrupt freedom of navigation and U.S.
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If China and Russia reach their goals,
the Arctic will emerge as a central theater in our respective
competitions]{.underline}. [Alaska is a vital location for monitoring
Chinese and Russian missile forces]{.underline}. The Arctic's natural
characteristics also make it ripe for space launch, reconnaissance, and
energy resource capture. [[Losing the]{.mark} upper hand in the [Arctic
could result in]{.mark} our [exclusion from the region militarily and
economically]{.mark}]{.underline} --- an ominous prospect, given the
trajectory of American relations with Russia and China. The [United
States has]{.underline} already been caught flat-footed, as we have
[invested relatively little in our Arctic forces]{.underline}. For
example, the [[combined icebreaker fleets of our adversaries outpace
ours]{.mark} by more than [25 to 1]{.mark}]{.underline}. U.S. leaders
simply have not met the Arctic challenge, and we are only beginning to
confront this reality now. In recent months, the Biden Administration
has created new posts at the Pentagon and State Department to address
Arctic security. And more [recently]{.underline}, [the White House
rolled out a comprehensive political-military strategy for the
Arctic]{.underline}, which includes a call for a greater military
presence in the region. Our core [challenge]{.underline}, however, [is
that the U.S. defense industrial base will essentially be starting from
scratch to field these capabilities]{.underline}. Decades of [[low
investment in icebreakers]{.mark} from the federal government [has left
U.S. shipbuilders unprepared]{.mark} to service even the best defense
strategy]{.underline}. Today, [[only one shipyard in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is building]{.mark} polar [icebreakers]{.mark}, and we
are set to add just three of these crucial ships by 2030]{.underline}.
[[Without]{.mark} sustained [investment]{.mark} in these capabilities,
[there is little hope of maintaining long-term U.S. power in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}. Congress has worked to authorize funding
for a twelfth national security cutter in this year's defense bill, but
much more needs to be done. [[We need to expand the icebreaker program
and substantially increase the budget]{.underline}]{.mark} for U.S.
Northern Command, which would give planners the tools they need to
navigate this unstable strategic environment. [Russia and China's latest
target, Kiska Island, became known during World War II as one of few
U.S. territories ever to be occupied by a foreign nation]{.underline}.
Japanese control of the island came to an end in 1943 when Adm. Chester
W. Nimitz and his cruisers expelled the Japanese. Since then, U.S.
forces have continued a proud tradition of Arctic operations, including
the first deployment of a nuclear submarine in 1954. It appears Kiska
--- and indeed [[the United States]{.underline} ---
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [once again [coming under threat from a Pacific
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. The moment demands that we unleash the full
might of our defense industrial base to secure our foothold in the
Arctic. As the proverbial winter with China and Russia comes, we should
prepare ourselves to weather it.

U.S. an opportunity to be a leader in the region, should it wish to do
so. "The Coast Guard should seize the opportunity that the ICE Pact
presents and build a common ice breaker platform across NATO countries
and Pacific allies," Weitz at Tufts said. "If they looked at buying 60
icebreakers in coordination with our NATO and Pacific allies it would be
more cost effective than ordering six from a shipbuilder in Mississippi
or Louisiana that doesn't have deep expertise in building icebreakers.
Everyone is thinking too small. We need to think about 60 icebreakers,
not six." The increasing cost of the U.S.'s new icebreakers is
considered too high by some experienced observers. Mika Hovilainen, CEO
of Aker Arctic, a Finnish icebreaker designer, says icebreakers can be
built quickly and for less than \$1 billion each. For example, the
Finnish icebreaker Polaris was built in 31 months from order to delivery
for EUR125 million in 2016, Hovilainen said. Polaris was designed by
Aker Arctic and was built by Arctech Helsinki Shipyard. Others see the
U.S. icebreaker order as a sign it is ready to focus on the Arctic. "I
think [we are closer than ever to the U.S. getting serious about
icebreakers]{.underline}," said Tero Vauraste, Senior Advisor and a
Global Fellow of Woodrow Wilson Center Polar Institute, and former CEO
of Finnish Icebreaker operator Arctia. "Because of Russia and China's
increased multi-faceted interest in the Arctic region, [the urgency of
having icebreakers for security is imminent]{.underline}. International
collaboration in design, building and operation would give the U.S an
operational shortcut and a cost-saving fairway to quickly break the
ice." [If the U.S. does take its position as an Arctic Nation seriously,
and when construction of the icebreakers currently under development is
complete, there will be clear winners and losers]{.underline}

75 [guided-missile destroyers]{.underline} -- [but]{.underline} it
[lacks a type of vessel]{.underline} that could be increasingly
important should it be required [to operate in the Arctic.]{.underline}
[Since 2022]{.underline}, the [Pentagon has been warning that the U.S.

great white North, but [icebreakers are still required for the U.S. to
have]{.underline} year-round [access to]{.underline} what is likely to
be an increasingly [contested region. The]{.underline} United States
[Coast Guard]{.underline} -- which is part of the Department of Homeland
Security not the Department of Defense -- currently
[operates]{.underline} just [two aging icebreakers.]{.underline} [The
problem was made worse]{.underline} this past summer, [when]{.underline}
USCGC Healy (WAGB-20), [the]{.underline} largest and [most
tech]{.underline}nologically [advanced icebreaker]{.underline}, [was
taken out]{.underline} of service due to an electrical fire[. That
forced the cancelation of]{.underline} two [scientific missions to the
Arctic]{.underline} via the Northwest Passage. The other icebreaker,
USCGC Polar Star (WAGB-10) -- which is like WAGB-20 homeported in
Seattle -- is tasked to travel to McMurdo Station, Antarctica, annually.
[A 2023 study]{.underline} (updated in July 2024[) from the
C]{.underline}ongressional [R]{.underline}esearch [S]{.underline}ervice
[concluded that the U.S. requires]{.underline} at least [eight or
nine]{.underline} polar [icebreakers]{.underline}. As a stopgap, the
Coast Guard announced it would acquire a commercial icebreaker and
station it in Juneau, Alaska. This is not entirely a new problem, but it
is one that climate change could make worse. [In early
2022]{.underline}, [the Pentagon]{.underline} warned that it
[required]{.underline} additional [icebreakers]{.underline}, [especially
as Russia has put]{.underline} renewed [interest in the Arctic
region.]{.underline} The [melting ice has opened up new shipping routes
that previously didn't exist]{.underline}, while [the region is rich in
resources.]{.underline} [To protect U.S. interests]{.underline} [may
require]{.underline} deploying [warships to the Arctic]{.underline} --
[and]{.underline} while the ice is melting, it does return in the
winter, necessitating [the need for more icebreakers.]{.underline}
"Strategically, icebreakers provide persistent presence in a way that's
not met by anything else in the maritime region," Randy Kee, who had
served as the senior advisor for arctic security affairs with the Ted
Stevens Center for Arctic Security Studies, explained in a Pentagon
report. "Remember, the Arctic is a maritime region, and icebreaking
provides you year-round access to be able to go in the region."
[Without]{.underline} the [icebreakers]{.underline}, [the U.S. may "not
be able to participate in the opportunities opening up or protect its
interests]{.underline}," the DoD further warned. [A]{.underline} major
[concern]{.underline} [is that Russia is partnering with
China]{.underline}, including [in the Arctic]{.underline}, where Beijing
has sought [to extend its influence.]{.underline} "[We are
seeing]{.underline} more and [more activity where Russia
and]{.underline} \[the\] [PRC are working together]{.underline}, and
[the Arctic is the most recent area]{.underline} that we're seeing
that," explained Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown
ahead of a trip to Iceland in October to attend the Arctic Chiefs of
Defence Conference, USNI News reported. "It's something [we all need to
be paying attention to and to understand what they're doing
togethe]{.underline}r, and is it for some type of positive benefit to
the collective whole, or is that something they're doing to challenge
other nations and other interests?"

WASHINGTON --- In late June, the US Coast Guard announced that one of
its two premier icebreakers, Polar Star, had entered dry dock to undergo
work that will extend its service life. Meanwhile, the Coast Guard's
other icebreaker, Healy, was preparing for its upcoming voyage to patrol
the Arctic. Then, disaster: Towards the end of July, Healy suffered an
electrical fire, derailing the ship's planned patrol and forcing it to
return to Seattle. And just like that, the entirety of America's polar
icebreaking fleet had been sidelined, hampering its ability to project
power and maintain a visible presence in the High North for the
foreseeable future. It's a worst-case scenario, but the fact the US is
on thin ice with its fleet of ships capable of navigating the Arctic has
been a concern for a long time --- a concern that earlier this summer
helped drive the White House to announce a new pact aimed directly at
strengthening the icebreaker fleet. In a July 10 trilateral
announcement, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Finland said
they will work together to build and buy icebreakers, a type of ship
uniquely designed to clear out the kinds of polar ice that would
otherwise sink or severely damage unprepared vessels. Under the
likely-backronym of the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort Pact, or ICE
Pact, the agreement fits into the kind of region-specific, bi- and
tri-lateral agreements the Biden administration has pursued in recent
years. But where ICE Pact stands out is its nature as the rare strategic
pact in which the [[United States' capabilities lag behind that of its
partners]{.mark}.]{.underline} For the US, it's an outreach to two NATO
allies, both of whom are highly proficient in polar navigation, for help
in a race with Russia and China for a stronger presence in a region that
experts have for years predicted will become vital to economic success
and national security. "Our partnerships in the Arctic are unique
because there is such a concentration of like-minded and highly capable
allies such as Canada and Finland. They have a wealth of experience
operating in the Arctic and do so with a high level of proficiency,"
Navy Adm. Daryl Caudle, the four-star officer in charge of US Fleet
Forces, told Breaking Defense. "ICE Pact is just another example of how
our partnerships with our allies serve as a force multiplier for the
United States," he continued. "By leaning on our partners who have a
longer history and deeper expertise in Arctic operations, we are able to
adapt and improve our own practices, making our combined efforts even
more effective. During the NATO summit, the three leaders offered only
preliminary details about ICE Pact, promising a joint memorandum of
understanding would be released later this year outlining future plans.
But the agreement reflects how seriously Washington and its allies are
taking future transits in and through the High North. "With climate
change, our Arctic is becoming far more accessible," Canadian Defense
Minister Bill Blair said in July, just ahead of the ICE Pact
announcement, adding that there are "huge gaps in our security and in
our presence" in the Arctic. "By 2050, the Arctic Ocean could be primary
point of transit between Europe and Asia. And as it becomes more
accessible, security concerns become, I think, far more significant to
us." Getting an accurate count of exactly how many icebreakers there are
in the world is challenging, due to the fact that "icebreaker" is a much
more ambiguous term than "frigate" or "submarine." Which ships should
count largely comes down to a source's interpretation and context. For
example, the United States owns numerous ships that are called
"icebreakers," but White House statements about ICE Pact disregard
vessels that operate solely in the Great Lakes, rather than polar
regions. Dozens of Liquified Natural Gas ships built by South Korean
industry are capable of polar navigation, but their ability to break ice
is secondary to their primary mission, which results in certain sources
not counting them. Some sources include ships owned and operated by
industry, rather than just those strictly managed by the state. The US
Coast Guard maintains a database of the world's icebreakers and provided
Breaking Defense with a report dated to 2020 outlining those ships.
Breaking Defense used that report, supplemented by expert analysis and
publicly available documents from the respective governments, to reach
the ship counts included in this story. When it comes to ICE Pact, there
are five key countries to consider: The three members of the new
trilateral agreement (Finland, Canada and the US) as well as Russia and
China, two governments that are antagonistic towards the Western
nations, both of which have shown significant interest in Arctic
governance and emerging sea routes. Of those five,
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is easily [in the
[lead]{.mark}]{.underline} [for sheer volume]{.underline}, stating in
February that it possessed 41 icebreakers across varying categories. ICE
Pact members Canada and Finland operate 20 and 11 icebreakers,
respectively. The United States, at 12 --- nine of which remain strictly
in the Great Lakes region --- and China, believed to have at least five,
own relatively fewer polar icebreakers given their much bigger navies,
but both countries are planning to build new vessels moving forward. All
of which is to say, [there is no American supremacy when it comes to
this niche sector of shipbuilding, and the United States may have the
most to gain]{.underline} in the new pact due to the age and size of its
current fleet. [America's 12 icebreakers are not operated by the Defense
Department]{.underline}. Instead, [they are owned by the Coast
Guard]{.underline}. "Even though the U.S. Navy doesn't own icebreaking
ships, we work closely with the U.S. Coast Guard, Canada, and Finland,
who do have these capabilities in the arctic," Caudle said. "These
partnerships are crucial, especially in the 'High North,' which is our
frontline for arctic maritime homeland defense." The Coast Guard owns
nine icebreakers that remain in the Great Lakes. While these ships are
important for keeping that region navigable for both armed forces and
civilian commerce, those ships are not suitable for transiting in the
arctic. Instead, [America on paper is reliant on three polar
icebreakers]{.underline} --- but even that number is misleading. The two
heavy-class ships Polar Star (WAGB-10) and Polar Sea (WAGB-11), both
built in the 1970s, are nearing the end of their useful service lives.
Due to a costly engine problem that occurred in 2010, Polar Sea was put
into "inactive commission" --- meaning it's not operational, and the
service has made clear that's unlikely to change. The third ship is the
Healy (WAGB-20), a newer, more technologically advanced icebreaker built
in the 1990s, considered a medium-class vessel. Making things more
complicated for the Coast Guard in the short term is the Healy suffering
an electrical fire in July, forcing it to return to port in Seattle,
Vice Commandant Adm. Kevin Lunday confirmed during a talk at the
Brookings Institution last week. With the Healy forced home and Polar
Star in a California dry dock for maintenance work, all three of
America's polar icebreakers are at least temporarily sidelined. The
Coast Guard said in a 2023 study that its ideal mix of vessels is up to
nine ships --- some medium, some heavy --- to fulfill all its Arctic and
Antarctic missions, according to a Congressional Research Service
report. To date, the Coast Guard has two initiatives to boost its fleet,
separate from ICE Pact. One of its top acquisition priorities, the Polar
Security Cutter, is a shipbuilding program aiming to deliver up to three
heavy-class ships. PSC's prime contractor is the Louisiana-based
Bollinger Shipyards, which took ownership of the program in 2022 when it
acquired Mississippi-based Halter Marine. The program since inception
has seen numerous cost and scheduling issues, but the latest projections
show the first ship hitting the water no sooner than 2029 with a price
tag that will likely exceed initial estimates of \$1.3 billion. In its
initial announcement about ICE Pact, the White House said Bollinger
would play an integral role in that agreement, but did not elaborate
further. A second, relatively newer initiative, is a request the USCG
sent to lawmakers in 2024 asking for \$125 million to purchase a
commercially available polar icebreaker. That acquisition remains at
least \$25 million short of proceeding, according to the service's most
recent budget documents. It's not yet clear what roles the Pentagon and
Coast Guard will have in the execution of ICE Pact. While unveiling the
DoD's new arctic strategy on July 22, and during subsequent public
appearances, Iris Ferguson, the senior Pentagon civilian overseeing
arctic policy, only said the Defense Department is supportive of the
Coast Guard's efforts to bolster its fleet. An administration official
told Breaking Defense the new pact would be a "whole-of-government
project." "The U.S. Coast Guard, as well as the broader Department of
Homeland Security, the U.S. Maritime Administration, as well as the
broader Department of Transportation, the State Department, the
Department of Defense and others will all play important roles---the
specifics of which are being worked through during the negotiation of
the trilateral memorandum of understanding and subsequent implementation
phases of the agreement," the official said. Rebecca Pincus, director of
the Polar Institute at the Wilson Center, a Washington DC-based think
tank, wrote that the primary impact of ICE Pact in the short-term is the
demonstration of "high-level attention" being paid to the Arctic by the
White House and "the credence this lends to efforts to find creative
solutions to the broader set of shipbuilding woes." "While unlikely to
reach the scale and scope of AUKUS, the ICE Pact agreement signifies
sustained interest from the Biden administration in partnering with key
allies on critical naval technology," she continued. Natives Of The
North, Canada And Finland's Reputation Precedes Them In Canada and
Finland, the US has teamed up with two countries that excel at building
icebreakers, and for good reason: Their people and economies depend on
it. While not every ship included in these counts is necessarily capable
of Arctic navigation, they do speak to a shipbuilding proficiency many
US shipyards lack. "One of our absolutely key, vital ports, and sources
of commerce comes through the Great Lakes system up through the St.
Lawrence River to open markets," said David Perry, president of the
Canadian Global Affairs Institute. "So being able to... have free
movement of goods in and out of the Port of Montreal and then to further
inland is vital to the Canadian economy." The Canadian Coast Guard,
which operates its country's icebreakers, lists 20 vessels as part of
the icebreaking fleet, ranging in size from light --- and even
air-cushioned hovercrafts --- to heavy ships. Perry said the state and
age of Canada's ships vary, but Ottawa has recognized a recapitalization
is necessary. "Right now, we don't have enough icebreaking assets to be
able to keep the kind of reliable access into the Canadian north that we
would ideally want, which is why we're looking to build two modern new
icebreakers," he said. Canada currently has two programs aimed at
revitalizing its icebreaker fleet. Seaspan Shipyards and Chantier Davie,
also called Davie Shipbuilding, are under contract to build a new polar
icebreaker each, which will be capable of year-round operations in the
Arctic. The schedule for when those ships will finish construction has
not yet been determined, according to the government. Earlier this year,
Canada also awarded Chantier Davie a contract to begin designing six
program icebreakers to replace several medium and heavy-class ships in
its Coast Guard's fleet. The program ships differ from their polar
counterparts in that they will be less capable of breaking fresh ice in
the High North, but their size and numbers will allow Canada to maintain
presence in the St. Lawrence waterways, Great Lakes and Atlantic and
Pacific oceans. In addition to being responsible for most of Canada's
new icebreakers, Chantier Davie also owns Helsinki Shipyard, based in
the eponymously named city in Finland. The Canadian company purchased
the shipyard's assets in 2023 from its previous Russian owners when
Russia's invasion of Ukraine had created a contentious relationship
between the shipyard and Finnish authorities. Helsinki Shipyard in
particular is responsible for a majority of the icebreakers Finland's
shipbuilding industry produces, according to White House data. While
it's unclear what role Chantier Davie and Helsinki Shipyard will play in
ICE Pact, the relationship speaks to the existing connections between
the two countries' industrial bases. In Finland, the US has partnered
with a country often touted as the world's leader in icebreaker
production. The Finnish government likes to say that the country designs
80 percent of the world's icebreakers and manufactures 60 percent ---
and the state-owned fleet reflects that mastery. "Super up-to-date and
super modern as well. They're very comfortable to live on," Jason Moyer,
an associate at the Wilson Center focused on transatlantic security
issues, said of Finland's ships. "The Finns are extremely modest. They
do not claim to be a superpower in many regards. But this is the one
area where they are pretty confident." Finland's fleet is unique
compared to the United States and Canada because most of its 11 ships
are not operated by the country's navy or coast guard. Rather, a
state-owned company called Arctia operates nine icebreakers, a 10th ship
is manned by the Finnish Navy and another is owned by Alfons-Håkans, a
private company, according to Moyer and other sources reviewed by
Breaking Defense. One of Finland's latest additions to its fleet is the
Polaris, which was publicly debuted in 2017 during the 100th anniversary
of Finnish independence, and it is considered the "pride" of the fleet
by the government. "Completed in 2016 and measuring 110 meters \[361
feet\] in length, Polaris is the first icebreaker in the world to
feature environmentally friendly dual-fuel engines capable of using both
low-sulphur marine diesel oil (LSMDO) and liquefied natural gas (LNG),
significantly reducing the ship's CO2 emissions," according to a Finnish
website promoting the city of Helsinki. "As a result, Polaris is
considered the most environmentally friendly icebreaker in the world."
Charly Salonius-Pasternak, a senior research fellow at the Finnish
Institute of International Affairs, told Breaking Defense that ICE Pact
may also present an opportunity for the Pentagon and US Coast Guard to
pick up on the small tips and tricks created by Finnish ingenuity over
the years. "Just because budgets have always been so tight, \[the
Finnish Navy\] have gotten quite adept at figuring out effective,
low-cost solutions to things," he said, citing the problem of how to
operate in freezing rain as one example. "Now that Finland is a US ally,
this will hopefully be easier to sort out, especially considering that
there are other fields where the US and Finland have collaborated in far
more sensitive security and defense matters than, frankly, icebreakers."
When the Pentagon presented its new arctic strategy in late July, it
highlighted in detail Russia and China's interest in advancing their
respective Arctic capabilities as well as the fact they are frequently
leaning on one another to achieve their goals. "Increasingly, the
\[[People's Republic of [China\] and Russia are collaborating in the
Arctic across multiple instruments of national
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. While significant areas of disagreement
between the PRC and Russia remain, their [[growing alignment in the
region is of concern, and DoD continues to monitor this
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}," according to the document.
"[[Russia's isolation as a result of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine
has made it increasingly reliant on the PRC for financing energy export
infrastructure in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}." The US Coast Guard's
data indicates that as of 2020, Russia's fleet was just a few ships
short of the Moscow's recent claim of 41 ships, with several vessels
under construction. Another extensive icebreaker tracker comes from Aker
Arctic, a Finnish shipbuilding firm dating back to the 1930s, which
tallied roughly four dozen Russian icebreakers without considering
vessels caught in the gray areas --- capable of breaking ice but not
always used for that purpose. The ambiguity around what constitutes an
"icebreaker" makes comparing these tallies against one another
difficult, but there is a clear consensus among sources that Russia has
prioritized being able to navigate ice both in polar regions and
elsewhere its fleet might be needed."Russia's icebreaking capacity is
significant," said Salonius-Pasternak. "\[You\] just have to look at the
map. They've of course had many reasons to keep it up," referring to the
country's geolocation and the environments its ships must frequently
transit. And with that in mind, the Pentagon's Arctic strategy warns not
to underestimate the country's ambitions. "Russia's maritime
infrastructure could allow it to enforce excessive and illegal maritime
claims along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) between the Bering Strait and
Kara Strait," according to the document. "[Russia claims the right to
regulate Arctic waters]{.underline} along the NSR in excess of the
authority permitted under the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (UNCLOS), placing excessive requirements on foreign vessels
transiting the route and threatening force against vessels out of
compliance with Russian regulations." While Russia's geolocation and
membership in the Arctic Council, an international forum for Arctic
nations to sort out disagreements, give it explicit and inherent
interest in the High North, Chinese ambitions and icebreaker
shipbuilding is a more complicated issue for Washington. In 2017, China
claimed to be a "near-arctic state" and has since then sought to insert
itself into the governance of both the High North --- a claim the US has
rejected --- as well as the Antarctic, where its claims have greater
credibility on the global stage given its geolocation. China is known to
operate at least five icebreakers, not all of which are capable of polar
navigation, and like other countries, certain ships are owned by the
state while others are managed by universities. (Pentagon officials
contend the line between military and commercial use is less meaningful
in the context of the Chinese because, they say, the state will
frequently and covertly use assets for dual purposes.)Beijing has also
previously announced it was developing a nuclear-powered icebreaker, but
publicly available details about that ship remain scarce. The country's
opacity makes it difficult to track its ships in detail, even for
veteran observers.Elizabeth Buchanan, a senior fellow at the Australian
Strategic Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense that China's
proclaimed stake in the arctic stems from its economy and security
turning on "the ability to secure unrestrained sea lines of
communication and control of global trade.""The emerging Northern Sea
Route, further bolstered by partnership with Russia in the Far East,
North Pacific Ocean and Russia's Northern Sea Route, connect Beijing to
Europe in a much more efficient (time and cost terms) manner," she said.
"Militarizing the route would further ensure supply security and allow
China to diversify its reliance on the South China Sea for seaborne
trade between Asia and Europe."She also argued that the United States'
speedy rejection of China's "near-arctic state" claim was "risky"
because it allows Beijing to criticize Washington for not respecting
China's rights to the high seas.[For the US to secure its own interest
in the arctic]{.underline}, she said, [it must invest in capabilities to
"deter ambitious Chinese behavior"]{.underline} --- [to
include]{.underline}, but not limited to, [icebreakers]{.underline}. ICE
Pact could offer one pathway to doing that."The US \[also\] needs to
bolster diplomatic ties with Arctic neighbors --- all of them. Including
Russia. An ability to draw Russia back from the brink in terms of its
China relationship in the Arctic is crucial," she said.Russia's
willingness to formally engage with other countries through the Arctic
Council largely stalled in the wake of its invasion into Ukraine and
that suspension of diplomacy "opened the door for Moscow" to more
heavily rely on other countries, such as China, to fuel its ambitions,
Buchanan said."There are set to be many cooks in the kitchen when it
comes to \[the\] Arctic's future," she added.

Security The 2009 US [Arctic]{.underline} Region Policy's focus on
[security has evolved significantly]{.underline}. Previously, the US
emphasized unilateral security and preferred bilateral agreements to
regional cooperation while ignoring Arctic issues.27) Post-Cold War,
[[Russia **expanded**]{.underline}]{.mark} its [presence [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [reverting to **Cold War
norms**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In response, the [[2022]{.mark} National
[Strategy now prioritizes]{.mark}]{.underline} American people and
sovereign territory and rights, committing to enhance [capabilities
through **[infrastructure]{.mark}** improvements]{.underline},
[[including an **expanded icebreaker fleet**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
strengthening cooperation with Arctic allies [against Russian
aggression]{.underline}.28) In his 1987 Murmansk speech, Mikhail
Gorbachev described the Arctic as a "peace and cooperation zone,"
emphasizing collaboration over competition.29) However during the 2000s,
in response to an increased perception of NATO's Arctic presence and
strategic importance, [[Russia]{.mark} began **[militarizing]{.mark}**
the region]{.underline}, [seeking [to reclaim]{.mark} its **[superpower
status]{.mark}**]{.underline} after the Soviet Union's collapse.30) By
2019, [Russia]{.underline} had [established [**14**
airfields]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [six military
bases]{.underline}]{.mark}, refurbished [16]{.underline} Soviet-era
[deep-water **[ports]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and 10 border posts in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} its Northern Fleet boasting an
estimated [120 ships]{.underline}, [[including **40
icebreakers**]{.underline}]{.mark}.31) [Russia allowed PRC to construct
docks at five of the most **significant ports**]{.underline} along
Russia's Arctic coastline.32) In contrast, [the US needs to
**develop**]{.underline} a centralized command structure in the Arctic,
a crucial aspect of its security policy.33) [It has **only one**
significant base]{.underline} at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland, with
two additional bases south of the Arctic Circle in Alaska.34) [[The US
has **only two**]{.mark} ocean-going icebreakers]{.underline}. There is
a stark disparity in military presence between Russia and the US, a
potential security dilemma. [Russia's **action**]{.underline}, [and the
US's **inaction**]{.underline}, [underscore the Arctic's **strategic**
importance and]{.underline} the **[urgency]{.underline}** for a
comprehensive security strategy. Russia has fortified the region to
protect future strategic and economic interests.35) The US has
interpreted this as an attempt to achieve regional dominance, prompting
numerous military operations in the area.36) Moscow views US actions as
aggressive intrusions into Russian territory, which has led to further
militarization on both sides.37) This ongoing dynamic was exemplified
when US Vice Admiral Lewis claimed that his fleet was prepared to secure
sea lanes in the Atlantic and Arctic.38) A Russian Duma member responded
by stating that the US should not tempt fate and that the NSR and Arctic
were Russia's responsibility where Russian national interests are
present.39) [The [current US]{.mark} Grand [Strategy]{.mark} has acted
firmly but [**lacks consistent** messaging]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, in 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo decried Russian aggression
in the Arctic, citing their regulations on NSR shipping, Arctic
fortification, and actions in Ukraine.40) However, Pompeo's message
lacked specificity about why the US felt threatened, simply stating that
the US would host military exercises and increase its presence in the
Arctic.41) [[The US must ensure]{.mark} that its [actions]{.mark} in the
Arctic [are]{.mark}]{.underline} firm, [**[predictable]{.underline}**,
**[consistent]{.underline}**, [and **straightforward** to
avoid]{.underline}]{.mark} [further [escalating
tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}. The US must improve its messaging on
Arctic security by clearly communicating its policies and red lines to
Russia to avoid misinterpretations and unintended confrontations.
However, it's also important to recognize that the Arctic offers
opportunities for cooperation. Enhanced communication can address
immediate threats and foster stable regional collaboration. By improving
its messaging strategy, the US can more effectively navigate the complex
geopolitical landscape and reduce the risks of escalating tensions with
Russia. Economics The future of the American Grand Strategy will be
influenced by accessibility of the NSR and NWP, which has historically
been limited due to short operational seasons (sea ice, weather) and
limited infrastructure. These routes are, however, becoming viable with
the NSR's navigation season expected to extend from three to six months
and the NWP's from two to four months by 2100.42) If these projections
hold, transporting goods from Europe to the Far East via the NSR could
be 25 percent more profitable than the Suez Canal Route.43) The current
shipping industry is already challenged. In 2023, Houthi attacks in the
Red Sea led seven major shipping companies to alter their routes,
resulting in fewer ships using the Suez Canal. Meanwhile, severe drought
in Panama caused a 30 percent decrease in trade since November 2023.44)
These disruptions have led to a 283 percent increase in the cost of a
40-foot container transiting from PRC to northern Europe.45) These
challenges have highlighted the need for alternative shipping routes,
making the Arctic routes increasingly important. The future
accessibility of the Arctic makes it more critical than ever however,
[the [West's **investment** is **lagging**]{.mark}]{.underline}.46) In
contrast, [Russia has **prioritized** the development of the
Arctic]{.underline} to attract traffic, particularly the NSR. From 2011
to 2015, the Russian Arctic doctrine focused on establishing new ports,
customs facilities, and marine checkpoints along the Arctic
Coastline.47) Vladimir Putin has stressed the NSR's strategic
importance, and Russia's development plan for 2035 includes [**\$19
billion** in **infrastructure investments**]{.underline}.48) These
commitments underscore Russia's recognition of the value of the NSR and
the potential increase in cargo transport in the north. The development
of the NSR is also of interest to PRC, who referred to it as part of the
Polar Silk Road in its 2018 Arctic White Paper and the 14th Five-Year
Plan.49) Putin's 2023 visit to PRC aimed to enhance the NSR's
integration into the Belt and Road Initiative.50) PRC's NSR use has
steadily increased, with transits rising from 27 in 2018 to 62 in
2020.51) The economic benefits, predicted to be 25 % greater than those
of the Suez Canal Route, are also a significant driver of PRC's growing
NSR interest.52) PRC stands to gain significantly from Russian NSR, and
Arctic expansion, in general. In contrast, Europe and Japan have a more
complicated view of the NSR. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
there was a decline in NSR transit due to sanctions on Russia.53)
However, by 2023, transits had rebounded, with increased transport of
Russian LNG to Europe.54) Despite condemning Russia's actions, Japan has
not avoided the NSR, indicating that economic advantages often outweigh
political considerations. Shifting maritime traffic from the Suez Canal
to the NSR requires the US to reevaluate trade routes and competitive
strategies. As European and Asian partners increasingly use the NSR,
they will need to maintain good relations with Russia, which could limit
their willingness to oppose Russia, giving Russia a strategic advantage.
The US must consider this shift in geopolitical power while also closely
monitoring the growing partnership between Russia and the PRC in the
Arctic. Increased access to energy and mineral resources extraction due
to ice melt, holds significant capacity for growth.55) The area is home
to 22 percent of the world's resources, which includes up to 25 percent
of unexplored oil and gas reserves. Despite having no Arctic land, PRC
refers to itself as a "near Arctic state," investing heavily in the
region. In 2012, PRC invested \$12 billion in the Russian Yamal LNG
project after US sanctions left Russia short on funds.56) Furthermore,
in 2018, PRC signed an agreement to invest in Alaskan natural gas export
facility,57) and in 2019, Chinese companies purchased 10 percent (\$5.6
billion) of the most prominent Russian natural gas producer.58) PRC has
unsuccessfully attempted to buy mines in Nunavut59) and recently
increased research and land acquisition efforts in the Svalbard.60) PRC
is clearly committed to Arctic resources. The Arctic's growing
accessibility is changing global trade and economics, necessitating an
adaptation of US grand strategy. Considering the potential opportunities
and challenges posed by Russia's and China's growing commercial
influence, the Arctic will play a crucial role in future global trade,
resource extraction, and international relations, making it a key
consideration for American strategic planning. Conclusion [**[Arctic
development]{.mark}** and **policies** have transitioned]{.underline}
from cooperative [to [**competitive** due to **Russian**]{.mark}
**development**]{.underline}, **[[militarization]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[and the PRC's expanding influence]{.underline}, [necessitating a
**recalibrated** US grand strategy]{.underline}. The 2022 US National
Strategy for the Arctic Region presented a comprehensive response,
prioritizing security, climate resilience, sustainable development, and
international governance. Its multi-pronged approach, emphasizing the
immediate need for a unified NATO Arctic strategy, furthers US interests
and aligns military, economic, and environmental policies among Arctic
NATO members. When engaging Russia, [the [US]{.mark} must present a
**[strong deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline} while pursuing selective
diplomatic efforts on shared concerns such as environmental protection
and accident prevention. This balanced strategy, valuing both strength
and diplomacy, [is [**necessary** to reduce]{.mark} the risk of
**[miscalculations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time,
strengthening the US role in multilateral forums like the Arctic Council
is essential to counter PRC's influence and prevent it from gaining
leverage as a self-proclaimed "near-Arctic" stakeholder. [Climate change
will create]{.underline} shipping opportunities and natural resource
access, accompanied by the potential for economic [growth and strategic
challenges]{.underline}. In navigating this evolving landscape, the US
strives to balance energy, security, and environmental protection but
conflicting interests complicate policy coherence. [Political
[**changes** and]{.mark} stakeholder **[sentiment]{.mark}** can
significantly shape strategy]{.underline}, often [[result]{.mark}ing [in
**abrupt shifts**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Maintaining [**consistency** is
**crucial**]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially as environmental issues
increasingly intersect [with **energy independence** and **national
security**]{.underline}. [[Security]{.mark} remains central]{.underline}
to US strategy, [but [**vulnerabilities** exist due to]{.mark} military
and **[infrastructure gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Russia's
**aggressive** Arctic buildup **contrasts**]{.underline}]{.mark} [with
[the US's **limited fleet**]{.mark} and infrastructure]{.underline}. The
US relies on strengthening alliances, mainly through NATO, which Sweden
now reinforces and Finland's membership. Balancing defense, diplomacy,
and coalition-building is vital to safeguarding US interests and Arctic
stability. [[The US can shape the **Arctic's future** through]{.mark}
strategic [**investments** and **leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[ensuring]{.underline} alignment between [national
**security**]{.underline}, environmental, and economic goals. Going
forward, the 2024 DoD Arctic Strategy implements essential initiatives
of the 2022 Arctic Strategy. It strengthens grand strategy by
identifying [[the Arctic as a **critical arena** for **power
projection**]{.underline}]{.mark}, alliance strengthening, climate
adaptation, and resilience. Its' approach forms a cohesive [**response**
[to Russian aggression and]{.mark} build-up]{.underline}, **[[PRC
ambition]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**collaboration** between Russia and
PRC]{.underline}, the addition of Sweden and Finland to NATO and climate
change. To that end, [it [supports **improved**]{.mark} Arctic
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, force readiness for high latitude
operations, and deeper engagement with Allies.61) [Given **adequate**
resources]{.underline} and a functioning joined-up government, the [DoD
[strategy will]{.mark} help **[maintain stability]{.mark}** and security
in the Arctic]{.underline}.

PLAN = People's Liberation Army Navy

[[China]{.mark}'s rapid military buildup has left the]{.underline}
People's Liberation Army Navy [(PLAN**) [poised to overtake the U.S.
Navy]{.mark}** in several measures of maritime might more
[quickly]{.mark} than sometimes assumed.]{.underline} If China continues
to expand its fleet at the current pace and the United States does not
revitalize its shipbuilding industry, [[China]{.mark} will grow
[increasingly]{.mark} [likely to emerge victorious from]{.mark}
interstate war, especially a [prolonged great power
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} The result is a China that will grow more
confident projecting power, threatening its less powerful neighbors, and
disregarding U.S. efforts to deter such behavior. The decline of U.S.
naval dominance will be difficult to reverse. The process has spanned
decades and rests on slow-moving economic and industrial trends. But the
United States can still maintain superiority by investing in smaller
surface combatants like corvettes, frigates, and unmanned naval systems
paired with alternative platforms like aircraft or ground-based missile
launchers; deepening its partnerships with Pacific nations like Japan
and South Korea; and investing more in its domestic shipbuilding
industry---particularly the highly specialized submarine industrial
base. [[**China now possesses the world's largest maritime fighting
force**,]{.mark} operating 234 warships to the U.S. Navy's
219.]{.underline} This count of China's fighting ships encompasses all
of its known, active-duty manned, missile- or torpedo-armed ships or
submarines displacing more than 1,000 metric tons, including the 22
missile-armed corvettes recently transferred to the China Coast Guard
but not the approximately 80 missile-armed small patrol craft operated
by the PLAN. The oft-cited count of about 290 U.S. Navy "battle force
ships" includes combat logistics and support vessels, of which the U.S.
Navy has 126, including those under the Military Sealift Command, and
the PLAN 167, according to the International Institute for Strategic
Studies. [[Such]{.mark} preponderance [provides an **important wartime
advantage**]{.mark}]{.underline}: one recent study concluded that
[[larger fleets won 25 out of 28 historical wars]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Like those historical combatants[, China has the numbers to absorb more
losses than the United States and keep fighting.]{.underline} In one
recent set of wargames, China lost 52 major surface warships compared to
between 7 and 20 U.S. equivalents. Even after such catastrophic losses,
China still had more surface warships than the United States and was
able to continue the naval battle. The United States continues to hold
an advantage in guided missile cruisers and destroyers. Destroyers in
particular serve as the backbone of any modern fleet due to their
multi-mission capabilities, speed, and cruising range. The United
States' 73 destroyers allow it to exert sea control and project power to
a greater extent than do the PLAN's 42 destroyers. But China is closing
the gap, having doubled its destroyer fleet from 20 in 2003 to 42 in
2023. The PLAN operates 23 destroyers launched in the past 10 years
compared with 11 operational U.S. destroyers. [China has also launched
eight cruisers since 2017, while the United States has not launched a
new cruiser since 2016.]{.underline} The U.S. preponderance of cruisers
and destroyers may also be a distraction from the Chinese advantage in
frigates and corvettes. These smaller ships played a key role in World
War II, in which they served as convoy escorts, fleet protection
vessels, and radar picket ships. In a modern conflict, they might serve
similar roles, fight enemy ships in the Indo-Pacific's littoral waters,
or perform other missions that naval strategists have not yet foreseen.
The U.S. Navy appears to recognize that it might be overinvested in
larger cruisers and destroyers: statements by senior U.S. Navy personnel
have emphasized the need to rapidly increase frigate production. Both
the United States and China are also seeking to develop armed naval
surface and underwater systems smaller than China's manned corvettes.
Smaller ships may not be as powerful as larger ones, but they can be
built faster and in greater numbers. U.S. partners can help overcome
China's numerical advantage. The Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force
operates 4 cruisers, 34 destroyers, 10 frigates, and 4 helicopter
carriers, two of which will soon be capable of launching and recovering
F-35s. The South Korean navy operates 3 cruisers, 6 destroyers, 16
frigates, and 5 corvettes. If either navy fights alongside the United
States, the PLAN will lose its numerical advantage. But effectively
integrating U.S. and partner forces is difficult, and whether these
nations will fight alongside the United States is beyond the control of
U.S. defense planners. Solving the problem therefore depends both on
strengthening U.S. partnerships and building a larger U.S. Navy. China's
productive advantage is reflected in the relative ages of active Chinese
and U.S. ships. [[About 70 percent of Chinese warships]{.mark} were
[launched after 2010, while only]{.mark} about [25 percent of the U.S.
Navy's were.]{.mark}]{.underline} China's newer ships are not
necessarily superior, although the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence
assessed in 2020 that China's ships were increasingly of comparable
quality to U.S. ships. [[Chinese ship production dwarfs that of the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} The Office of Naval
Intelligence assessment noted that [China has "dozens" of commercial
shipyards larger and more productive]{.underline} than the largest U.S.
shipyards, and an unclassified [[U.S. Navy]{.mark} briefing slide
[suggested]{.mark} that [China has **230 times** the shipbuilding
capacity of the United States. China's massive shipbuilding
industry]{.mark} would [provide a strategic advantage in]{.mark} a
[war]{.mark}]{.underline} that stretches beyond a few weeks, [allowing
it to repair damaged vessels or construct replacements much faster than
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which continues to face a
significant maintenance backlog and would probably be unable to quickly
construct many new ships or to repair damaged fighting ships in a great
power conflict. The United States probably faces insurmountable
obstacles to meaningful increases in shipbuilding in the coming decade,
but it might be able to reduce China's advantage through its
relationships with Japan and South Korea. These U.S. partners accounted
for 26 and 14 percent of global ship deliveries in 2023, respectively.
The U.S. Navy plans to repair ships at international shipyards in 2025
on a trial basis, which could reduce the maintenance backlog, but
actually constructing U.S. ships using foreign shipbuilders is unlikely
due to U.S. legal restrictions. The only long-term answer is probably an
industrial strategy that supports the broader U.S. shipbuilding sector
for decades. This enormous shipbuilding capacity means that PLAN
expansion will remain a feature of U.S.-China strategic competition as
long as the Chinese economic and personnel systems can support it---and
the Chinese Communist Party leadership deems it important. How big the
PLAN will grow is unknown: unlike the United States, China does not
publish its shipbuilding plans. U.S. defense planners should assume that
the [[PLAN will continue to grow]{.mark}---potentially [at an
accelerating pace]{.mark}---in number, ship size, and firepower. The
challenge faced by the U.S. Navy and the maritime forces of like-minded
nations is only beginning.]{.underline} Raw numbers are only one
component of combat power, the destructive or disruptive force that a
military can bring to bear on the battlefield. Although the U.S. Navy
retains many advantages, [the [PLAN]{.mark} is [on track to surpass the
U.S]{.mark}. Navy [in]{.mark} an important measure of naval power: the
total number of [vertical launch system]{.mark} (VLS) [cells]{.mark},
advanced missile launchers that allow ships to fire
projectiles]{.underline} ranging from anti-ship to land-attack to air
defense missiles. The U.S. Navy currently has about 9,900 VLS cells
spread across its surface combatants and submarines, while the PLAN only
has about 4,200. This means that the U.S. Navy can fire more missiles
than the PLAN in an average salvo, although the PLAN also operates 152
warships armed only with traditional missile or torpedo launchers (in
addition to its roughly 80 missile-armed patrol craft) compared with the
U.S. Navy's 81 such ships. [But China is on pace to catch up **[within
the next few years]{.mark}**.]{.underline} U.S. ships had 222 times as
many launchers in 2004 and now have fewer than three times as many. [If
the current trend continues, China will have more launchers than the
U.S. Navy by 2027]{.underline}. This means that China's navy will be
able to fire more of the advanced missiles that allow it to deliver
precision strikes against ships or onto land and to defend itself
against enemy missiles or aircraft. Building more VLS-equipped ships is
not the only way to deliver firepower at sea. Ground-based launchers,
aircraft, and unmanned systems will all play a role in any war between
the United States and China. The United States can therefore increase
its firepower by investing further in autonomous systems, increasing its
ground-based force structure in key areas, and making its air assets
more survivable. Solving the difficult technical problems associated
with reloading VLS cells at sea could also go a long way toward
maintaining a U.S. firepower advantage by potentially adding the
equivalent of 2,016 VLS cells to the fleet, effectively increasing its
VLS firepower by 20 percent. Finally, the United States can invest more
in high-quality missiles like long-range anti-ship missiles or Maritime
Strike Tomahawks and hypersonic technology to seize a qualitative edge
and limit the Chinese advantage in magazine depth. Some analysts argue
that China's numerical advantages are literally outweighed by the U.S.
Navy's much larger ships. Because bigger ships can move farther and
carry more weapons and support systems than smaller ships, the U.S.
Navy's advantage in displacement suggests that China still trails the
United States in its ability to fight at sea. The extent of the U.S.
advantage depends greatly on the utility of aircraft carriers in a naval
conflict. U.S. aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships (some of
which can serve as "mini-carriers") account for about 90 percent of the
displacement gap. But carriers' utility in a navy-on-navy fight is hotly
debated. [If carriers turn out to be of limited value for modern naval
warfare, much of the [U.S. displacement advantage
disappears]{.mark}]{.underline}, and recent rates of expansion suggest
that China can probably surpass the United States in aggregate
displacement of cruisers, destroyers, and frigates in less than ten
years. The U.S. displacement advantage will translate into a combat
advantage as long as carriers and naval airpower remain dominant at sea.
Even if naval airpower is supplanted by missile power, the U.S. carrier
and amphibious assault fleet will remain useful: U.S. carrier doctrine
will likely evolve as lessons are learned from combat, although failure
to adapt can be fatal. Carriers and amphibious assault ships will also
remain central to projecting power ashore and vital for coercive or
deterrent diplomacy. But uncertainty about the role of carriers in
modern naval combat and the relative need for power projection ashore
suggests that in a conflict with China the U.S. Navy could turn out to
be less than the sum of its tons. Submarine capabilities remain an area
of unquestioned U.S. dominance. The United States operates 66 nuclear
submarines compared with China's 12. Large nuclear submarines are much
more capable than diesel-electric submarines, operating with far greater
range, stealth, and offensive power. U.S. submarines also have a
combined 1,168 VLS cells between them, while PLAN submarines have no
confirmed VLS cells, although various experts project that China will
produce submarines with VLS cells in the near future. China's subsurface
fleet is unlikely to quickly catch up to that of the United States
because the United States has a massive head start in submarine
production, not because the United States has an enduring technological
or production advantage. China's submarine technology is rapidly
improving, and its submarine production capacity is growing. A 2023
Department of Defense report anticipates China growing its submarine
force to 80 units by 2035 while retiring older systems, a remarkable
level of production, even if the majority are not nuclear powered.
Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) has also been a priority for the PLAN,
which is improving its ASW doctrine and assets, although the pace of
improvement seems to lag behind that of its surface warfare capability.
Maintaining its subsurface advantage is vital for the United States.
Open source wargaming and strategic analysis suggest that U.S.
submarines might be called on to play a decisive role in war with China.
The United States' two submarine shipyards are straining to produce even
the two Virginia-class submarines needed to maintain (and eventually
increase) the size of the subsurface fleet. Efforts to increase
construction capacity as China begins to catch up to the United States
in submarine construction and anti-submarine warfare face significant
headwinds, including high materials prices and a lack of workers. It
should come as little surprise that the first item on the U.S. Navy's
Fiscal Year 2025 Unfunded Priorities List was \$403 million for the U.S.
submarine industrial base, and the sixth, seventh, and eighth items were
all related to submarines or ASW. **[[The Clock Is
Ticking]{.mark}]{.underline}** None of this means that the PLAN will
defeat the U.S. Navy in wartime. Wars are too complex for such
predictions. The U.S. Navy has vastly more combat experience and time at
sea than the PLAN. The United States also has a blue water naval
tradition dating back more than two centuries, while the Chinese
tradition dates back less than three decades. A war between China and
the United States will also be a joint war, meaning that the conflict
will engage air, ground, space, and cyber forces. Each country's
relative strength in each of these domains will matter, as will
strategy, leadership, and luck. Nor is China guaranteed to overtake the
United States as the world's---or even the Pacific's---premiere naval
power. Drawing conclusions about longer-term performance from historical
data is always uncertain, especially when relying on open source
information on an organization as secretive as the PLAN. The United
States also has other advantages (and China disadvantages)---like U.S.
alliances, economic heft, and soft power---not captured in an analysis
of naval hardware. But [the [trends]{.mark} are [pointing in the wrong
direction for the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. The [U.S.]{.mark} Navy
[faces]{.mark} a [growing possibility of defeat at sea]{.mark} for the
first time in half a century, and the United States could soon face its
first potential contender for maritime dominance since at least the
collapse of the Soviet Union.]{.underline} China's naval might is
already allowing Beijing to flex its muscles in the Pacific in ways that
endanger U.S. allies and undermine stability. If the United States does
not halt its relative decline, the world will face a more dangerous and
uncertain future.

### China Leads in Icebreakers

#### China pushes ahead of US in icebreakers 

**Humpert 24**, 8/20/24, Senior Fellow and Founder of The Arctic
Institute, China Deploys Three Icebreakers to Arctic as U.S. Presence
Suffers After 'Healy' Fire, gCaptain,
https://gcaptain.com/china-dispatches-three-icebreakers-to-arctic-us-suffers-healy-fire/

[China continues to push ahead with the rapid expansion of its
Arctic-capable fleet.]{.underline} For the first [time it has dispatched
three icebreaking vessels into the region]{.underline} this summer. [The
U.S., meanwhile, will remain without surface presence in the Arctic for
the remainder of the year,]{.underline} possibly longer. Following last
month's fire aboard Coast Guard [icebreaker Healy the vessel had to
abort its Arctic patrol returning back to its homeport Seattle on a
single engine. The only other USCG icebreaker, Polar Star, remains
currently dry docked in an attempt to squeeze a few more years of
service life out of the 55-year old vessel.]{.underline} China's largest
and most capable icebreaking research vessel, [Xue Long]{.underline} 2,
departed for a months-long expedition in early July. Comparable in size
and capability to Healy, the vessel [passed through the Bering Strait
weeks later and spent more than two weeks in the waters of the Chukchi
and Beaufort Seas to the north of Alaska, before continuing its voyage
into the Central Arctic Ocean.]{.underline}

#### China leads US in icebreakers and development 

**Humpert 25**, 1/2/25, Senior Fellow and Founder of The Arctic
Institute, U.S. Department of Defense Sounds Alarm Bells About China's
Growing Presence in Arctic, gCaptain,
[[https://gcaptain.com/china-dispatches-three-icebreakers-to-arctic-us-suffers-healy-fire/]{.underline}](https://gcaptain.com/china-dispatches-three-icebreakers-to-arctic-us-suffers-healy-fire/)

[China's Arctic activities feature prominently in a new DoD report to
Congress about the country's military and security
developments.]{.underline} In the decade since gaining observer status
on the Arctic Council in 2013 China has massively expanded its Arctic
footprint and has begun to work closely with Russia in its attempt to be
seen as an Arctic power. "The PRC's expanding Arctic engagement has
created new opportunities for engagement between the PRC and Russia and
has resulted in unprecedented styles of collaboration," the DoD
concludes. [China]{.underline} continues to expand its ice-capable
vessels and support ships and [has made rapid progress in designing and
constructing icebreakers. Its original icebreaker]{.underline},
Ukrainian-built [Xue Long]{.underline} 1, [has been supplemented with a
host of new polar vessels]{.underline}. In 2019 Xue Long 2 became the
first domestically built polar icebreaker. [In the five
year]{.underline}s since, [the country has launched]{.underline} or
placed into service [two additional icebreaking ships and converted a
commercial one]{.underline}. Ji Di, a 5,600 tonne Polar Class 6 research
vessel, operated by the Ministry of Natural Resources entered into
service in August 2024. A second much larger Polar Class 4 research
icebreaker, Tan Suo San Hao, followed in December 2024. The
similarly-named Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di, a former commercial icebreaker,
was also converted for government use. The summer of 2024 saw three
Chinese icebreaking vessels operate in the Arctic simultaneously for the
first time, while U.S. presence was hampered by the lack of available
Coast Guard icebreakers. "The DoD report once more reads as a defensive
strategy when Washington actually needs an offensive one. Simply
pointing at Chinese vessel growth and investment is becoming a tired
strategy for the U.S. High time to start cutting steel and prioritising
its own Arctic presence -- after all, presence is power," says Elizabeth
Buchanan, a polar geopolitics expert at Australian Strategic Policy
Institute. [The DoD]{.underline} report [lists a number of joint
Russian-Chinese military activity in the Arctic, including
a]{.underline} September 2022 [combined naval patrol in the Bering
Sea]{.underline}, and in 2024 several month-long combined operations
including bomber, naval, and coast guard patrols in the Alaskan ADIZ.
Especially noteworthy is [the two countries' first joint patrol above
the Arctic Circle in October 2024]{.underline}. A four vessel flotilla
crisscrossed the Bering Sea and into the Chukchi Sea passing just miles
from the Alaskan mainland. ["China's growing influence on Russia and its
increasing military presence in the Arctic presents a clear and imminent
threat,"]{.underline} affirmed Iris A. Ferguson, the deputy assistant
secretary of defense for Arctic and Global Resilience earlier in
December 2024. The DoD also highlights the country's growing commercial
interests in the region. [Chinese shipping operators have conducted more
than 100 Arctic transits since 2013]{.underline}, including with
increasingly large container ships. This past summer two Chinese Panamax
container ships transited the Arctic in record time connecting St.
Petersburg and Shanghai in just 21 days. "[The PRC is interested in
increasing the use of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) to cut shipping times
between Europe and the PRC by approximately a third. The use of the NSR
enables the PRC to diversify shipping routes away from the strategic
Strait of Malacca]{.underline}," the DoD report to Congress concludes.
"Chinese leaders see the region as a new crossroads of the world, a new
source of raw materials and new avenues for manifesting its growing
power," Ferguson also confirmed. China's polar activity also extends to
Antarctica where the country is engaged in building its fifth research
station.

states.]{.underline} Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Defense revealed
an updated Arctic strategy last month amid \"growing cooperation\"
between Beijing and Moscow. The document called for increased military
presence, intelligence capabilities, and cooperation between Washington
and its Western allies. [The Xue Long]{.underline} 2, one of the Chinese

departed from Qingdao, a city in the eastern China province of Shandong,
for the country\'s 14th Arctic expedition on July 5. It was shadowed by
HMCS Regina, a Canadian navy frigate armed with missiles, from July 13

access with Xue Long 2 there from July 3 to 4. It is the country\'s
next-generation icebreaking ship and was delivered in June, according to
Chinese media. The Ji Di was underway in the Arctic waters north of the
Chukchi Sea as of Wednesday, AIS data showed. [The sea lies off the
northwestern coast of Alaska and borders Russia\'s Chukchi Peninsula,

between July and October.]{.underline} A third Chinese icebreaker, Zhong
Shan Da Xue Ji Di, which means \"Sun Yat-sen University Polar\" in
literal translation, left Guangzhou in southern China province of
Guangdong on July 27. The 5,852-ton vessel belongs to the university
after it was donated by private Chinese entrepreneurs.

### Russia Arctic Ambitions

#### Russia expanding its influence over Arctic-includes new military equipment

**Kabachynskyi 25** (3/5/25, Illia, journalist for economics and
defense, "Arctic War: How Russia Is Turning a Peaceful Region Into a
Military Base,"
https://united24media.com/world/arctic-war-how-russia-is-turning-a-peaceful-region-into-a-military-base-6461)

As early as 2021, [US media reported that Russia was reviving Soviet-era
bases and building new ones.]{.underline} The Russian Ministry of
Defense announced [590 new military sites, including airfields for Su-34
and Su-35 fighter jets. Moscow is now reportedly positioning missile
systems, aviation units, air defense installations, and radar systems
along its northern border---aiming for full control over the
region,]{.underline} which covers a vast portion of the Northern
Hemisphere. In 2024, Vladimir [Putin reaffirmed his commitment to Arctic
dominance by ordering]{.underline} the largest military exercise in the
region's
history---[[Ocean-2024](https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/opinions/war-in-the-arctic/157377).]{.underline}
The [drill involved 400 warships, submarines, and support vessels, as
well as 120 planes and helicopters]{.underline}---an unprecedented show
of force. As part of the exercises, strategic bombers capable of
carrying nuclear missiles flew over the Barents and Norwegian Seas.
These drills have triggered significant alarm. Since the Cold War, few
considered the Arctic a potential war zone. But [Russia is preparing for
a future where ice recedes, natural defenses disappear, and the region
becomes a battlefield]{.underline}. While much of the world overlooks
this threat, Scandinavian nations feel it acutely. In 2024, discussions
about damaged undersea cables in the Baltic Sea gained traction,
following previous concerns over Russian electronic warfare (GPS
jamming) in 2022 and 2023. However, the Arctic has faced such
provocations for years. Russian military aircraft have repeatedly
violated Scandinavian airspace, and in 2022, a fiber-optic cable
connecting mainland Norway to the Svalbard archipelago was severed.
Suspicion fell on Russia, as a Russian fishing vessel was in the area at
the time of the incident. This cable supports a satellite station in
Svalbard and provides broadband internet access to the Arctic
archipelago. Arctic nations recognize that melting ice does not just
expose Russia's borders---it affects theirs. Moscow's military buildup
may not be about defense, and its exercises may not be just drills.
Ukraine has already learned that lesson. But [military expansion isn't
the only motivation at play]{.underline}. Trade routes and resources The
presence of ice does not mean the Arctic is unnavigable. [Trade
exists]{.underline}, though on a smaller scale than in other parts of
the world, and it requires a special class of escort
vessels---icebreakers. Here, Russia is the undisputed leader. According
to Russia's Transport Ministry, [the country operates 41 icebreakers,
including seven nuclear-powered ones---the only nation in the world with
such a fleet. In contrast, the US, Canada, and European nations each
have only a handful. This dominance has allowed Russia to control the
Northern Sea Route. Since Arctic navigation largely depends on Russian
icebreakers, Moscow profits by charging commercial fees for their
use]{.underline}. At the same time, this gives Russia a crucial
strategic advantage. The [Kremlin retains the power to dictate Arctic
trade flows.]{.underline} Icebreakers also operate alongside Russia's
naval forces, ensuring military operations can be sustained in the
region. Unsurprisingly, Russia's partner nations are now investing in
their own icebreaker fleets rather than relying solely on their
so-called "ally." Russia's Arctic ambitions also serve as a tool for
circumventing Western sanctions. By controlling this trade corridor,
Moscow can continue exporting resources to Asia, bypassing restrictions.
Russia's claim to Arctic dominance is further reflected in its
territorial ambitions. While international agreements designate
territorial waters up to 12 miles (22 km) from the coast and exclusive
economic zones up to 200 miles (370 km), Russia has spent years trying
to expand its claim. [Moscow argues that the Lomonosov and Mendeleev
Ridges are extensions of its continental shelf, thereby asserting rights
over an additional 463,000 square miles (1.2 million km²)---including
the North Pole]{.underline}.

#### Russia asserting dominance in Arctic-developing new civilian and military technology

**Global Defense News 25** (Army Recognition Group, "Analysis: What Is
Russia Implementing to Assert Itself in Arctic Region?," 2/7/25,
https://armyrecognition.com/focus-analysis-conflicts/army/analysis-defense-and-security-industry/analysis-what-is-russia-implementing-to-assert-itself-in-arctic-region)

[Rostec, the Russian high-tech conglomerate, has recently unveiled two
innovations designed to operate in extreme and hard-to-reach
environments.]{.underline} On the one hand, the [Ruselectronics holding
is introducing a satellite data transmission module capable of
functioning under the harsh conditions of the Arctic]{.underline}. On
the other hand, the [High-Precision Systems holding has developed a
small information and landing system]{.underline}, ideal [for
landing]{.underline} light aircraft almost anywhere, including [on
drifting ice floes]{.underline}. The innovations presented illustrate
Russia's determination to strengthen its operational capabilities in
remote areas, notably the Arctic. By investing in robust and autonomous
solutions, [Moscow is equipping itself with tools that facilitate the
deployment of both civilian and military equipment in
difficult-to-access regions]{.underline}.

The new telecommunications module connects to the Gonets satellite
network. It sends and receives messages, continuously transmits
telematic data, and endures temperatures ranging from +50°C down to
-60°C thanks to its hermetically sealed casing and heating elements. It
can be installed on forestry machinery, all-terrain vehicles, or even
ships, without requiring regular maintenance. The landing system
developed by the Central Research Institute of Automation and Hydraulics
(TsNIIAG) consists of two units: one integrated into the aircraft, and
the other set up on tripods on the ground. Compact and easy to deploy,
this system can turn almost any terrain into a runway, even in poor
visibility or extreme weather conditions. It helps aircraft land with a
precision of about one meter, which is crucial for operations in remote
regions, such as Arctic drifting ice floes. For several years now,
[Russia has been working to modernize and expand its presence in the
Arctic.]{.underline} [These communication and navigation devices provide
the means to more efficiently monitor and exploit natural
resources,]{.underline} while offering increased logistical support for
scientific expeditions and industrial operations (forestry, oil
exploration, etc.). Moreover, the ability to manage even minimal air
traffic in isolated areas or on drifting ice contributes to establishing
an operational Arctic infrastructure. [In addition to their civilian and
commercial applications, these technologies are clearly of interest to
the armed forces.]{.underline} Accurate navigation, reliable
telecommunications, and the capacity to set up improvised landing sites
are valuable assets for military or research operations in polar
environments. [In light of growing international competition over Arctic
maritime routes and resources, Russia is thus bolstering its position in
terms of sovereignty and defense of its regional interests]{.underline}.
[]{.mark}The announcements regarding the planned start of production at
the end of the year and the continuation of testing suggest a desire to
rapidly deploy these solutions. [This approach is part of a long-term

Competition in the Arctic Is Heating Up: Russian and Chinese Ambitions
The growing partnership between Russia and China provides early warning
signs that the region could become a site of future conflict. In 2021
Russia and China renewed their 20-year-old Sino-Russian Treaty of Good
Neighborliness and Friendly Cooperation, a move described as "an act of
friendship against America."9) Moreover, [both Russia and China have
deep historic and economic ties to the Arctic.]{.underline} NATO's
expansion to include Finland and Sweden have increased tensions in the
region, while both Russia and China have expressed their disapproval of
NATO's increasing presence in the Arctic.10) However, despite feeling
antagonized by NATO's actions, Moscow and Beijing may not have the
economic and military capacities to reshape the current international
rules-based order in the Arctic in the near term. [Despite being the
only non-NATO member in the Arctic, Russia controls over 53 percent of
the Arctic coastline, making it a decisive player in the future of the
region]{.underline}.11) Yet, Russia's Arctic ambitions are not new.
Russia's connection with the Arctic can be traced back to the sixteenth
century, beginning with its conquest of Siberia, which was part of a
larger initiative to search for resources and trade routes.12) As the
nation matured, its Arctic ambitions did as well. During the Cold War,
the Soviets established both a nuclear and naval presence on the Kola
Peninsula to project power against the U.S. With the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Russia, as the de jure inheritor of the Soviet nuclear
arsenal, did not abandon its desire to be an Arctic power. As the
Russian economy recovered in the early 2000s under Vladimir Putin,
Russia began posturing for Arctic supremacy, reopening multiple
Soviet-era military bases, modernizing its navy, and developing new
hypersonic missiles designed to evade U.S. sensors and defenses.13)
[Moreover, in August 2022, Moscow announced that it would refocus its
military power on the Arctic and Nordic region.]{.underline}14)
According to Colin Wall, a research associate at Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, "The military balance in the
Arctic is heavily weighted towards Russia." Furthermore, the
International Institute for Strategic Studies and Reuters cite that
Russia's bases inside the Arctic Circle outnumber NATO's by roughly a
third.15) [Russia's remilitarization of the Arctic and its revitalized
strategic partnership with China, provides both countries with the means
to challenge the current Western rules-based international
order]{.underline}. Although China's Arctic history does not mirror
Russia's centuries-old presence in the north, [Beijing's desire for
Arctic supremacy has rapidly evolved over the past century. China's
involvement in the Arctic began in 1925 with the signing of the Svalbard
Treaty]{.underline}, providing a legal basis for China to conduct
non-military activity, such as scientific exploration, resource
extraction, and fishing in the Arctic.16) However, China's rationale to
operate in the region extends beyond scientific exploration. In 2018
China released its first Arctic White Paper, which asserts that it is a
"Near-Arctic State."17) China employs a dual narrative to explain its
aims in the Arctic. Externally, Beijing appeals to foreign audiences by
advocating for the safeguarding of international interests and promoting
sustainable Arctic development. However, this is juxtaposed against the
narrative it promotes for domestic audiences, which emphasizes
competition for resources and China's desire to become a "polar great
power."18) The Svalbard Treaty has currently enabled China to shroud its
military activity and influence in the Arctic as scientific exploration
and global cooperation. But it is becoming clear from its growing
partnership with Russia and increasingly aggressive military action in
the Arctic that China's intentions to reshape the international system
extend well beyond the Indo-Pacific. [The U.S. and NATO would be wise to
recognize China's aims in the Arctic.]{.underline} The historic ties of
Russia and China and their Arctic ambitions reveal that the Arctic is
likely to be an arena for future strategic competition. Russia's 2022
invasion of Ukraine has temporarily bolstered the West's position in the
Arctic, as previously neutral Finland and Sweden joined NATO. Finland's
accession into NATO not only increased the NATO-Russia land border by
over 650 percent and moved the defense alliance a mere 250 miles from
St. Petersburg, but it also contributed to creating a divided Arctic,
where nearly half belongs to NATO while the remaining half is Russian
territory. [Threatened by the growing alliance, in June 2022, Putin
warned that if U.S.-NATO military contingents or military infrastructure
appears in either Sweden or Finland, Russia will respond "symmetrically"
by deploying nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea region]{.underline} to
restore military balance and strengthen its defenses.19) In February
2023, Putin made good on this threat and deployed Russian ships armed
with tactical nuclear weapons to the Baltic Sea. According to Norway,
this was the first time in 30 years that this has happened.20) Then in
June 2024, Moscow began to train soldiers and sailors to deploy tactical
nuclear weapons in Leningrad, a military district bordering NATO members
Norway, Finland, Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.21) As evidenced
by these actions, while Putin is not afraid to rattle the nuclear saber,
it is not likely that Russia has the military or economic capacity to
engage in a direct conventional conflict with NATO. NATO leaders
recognize that there is a finite window of time to prepare for conflict
against Russia. In 2024 the head of the Norwegian armed forces warned
that NATO countries only have two to three years to prepare for a
Russian attack. Norwegian General Eirik Kristoffersen claims that Moscow
is building up its military stockpile faster than previously predicted,
while Western nations have depleted their own weapons by supplying them
to Ukraine.22) Several other European leaders have echoed these
concerns, citing that they have between three and eight years to prepare
for a Russian attack against NATO.23) Despite Russia's aggressive
rhetoric, Moscow understands that because of its war against Ukraine it
likely will not have the capability to attack NATO in the near future.
For instance, Russia removed nearly all its ground forces from the
Finnish border to Ukraine in June 2024.24) [Russia's timeframe to launch
a successful attack is dependent not only on its economy but also on its
partnership with the PRC.]{.underline}

#### China asserting dominance in Arctic-intends to secure trade routes

**Weisko 25** (3/25/25, Paul, research assistant, masters in
international affairs, research fellow at east asian naval security,
"Dragon on Ice: China's Geostrategic Interests in the Arctic,"
https://www.inss.org.il/publication/north-pole/)

China's Arctic policy is a carefully calibrated strategy that balances
its economic needs, security concerns, and ambition for global
recognition and leadership. Despite being geographically distant from
the Arctic Circle, [China has declared itself a "near-Arctic
state."]{.underline} This claim, although met with skepticism by former
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, serves a crucial purpose: [it
legitimizes China's involvement in Arctic affairs.]{.underline} China
argues that the cascading effects of climate change in the
Arctic---particularly the accelerating melting of ice and the rising
global sea levels---have far-reaching consequences. Even distant nations
like China, where major coastal cities such as Shanghai and Tianjin face
the threat of being potentially submerged, are impacted. [By positioning
itself as a responsible stakeholder with a vested interest in the
region's stability, sustainable development, and climate change
mitigation, China justifies its expanding presence in Arctic
affairs.]{.underline} Thus, it advocates for broader international
participation and a more inclusive approach to Arctic governance,
allowing it to engage in discussions without appearing as an outsider or
opportunist. However, in doing so, China subtly challenges the existing
governance framework, controlled mainly by the Arctic Council and its
member states. The Arctic Council is a highly effective international
forum composed of the eight states located above the Arctic Circle: the
U.S.A., Russia, Canada, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, and Sweden.
In addition to these member states, the Arctic Council includes observer
states and representatives of indigenous peoples in the Arctic. Five of
these states--- the U.S.A., Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark---are
littoral members of the Arctic Ocean and are thus referred to as the A5.
One of these states, Russia, comprises 53% of the Arctic and is notably
different from the other Arctic Council members. Consequently, the
remaining seven Arctic Council members are collectively known as the A7.
Despite the differences between Russia and the A7, the Arctic Council
was historically one of the more effective international forums,
operating on consensus and explicitly barring discussions of military
affairs. However, the longstanding principle of "high latitude, low
tensions" came to an end in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. In
response, the A7 decided that under such circumstances, business as
usual could not continue, and effectively suspended Russia from the
council. A key aspect of the great power rivalry in the region is the
competition for access to the Arctic's abundant natural resources.
According to the United States Geological Survey, the Arctic is believed
to hold vast, largely untapped reserves of oil, natural gas, and
critical minerals such as rare earth elements, titanium, and lithium. As
climate change melts the Arctic ice, these resources are becoming
increasingly accessible. Given its rapidly growing economy and voracious
demand for energy and raw materials, China views securing access to
these resources as a strategic imperative. Although China and Russia
have formed a pragmatic partnership in the Arctic---partly driven by
shared concerns about US global dominance---their ambitions could
eventually clash. Despite challenges from Western sanctions and
geopolitical pressures, [China remains committed to securing access to
Arctic resources]{.underline}. Its involvement in large-scale projects
like the Yamal LNG project, which extracts and then liquefies gas from
Russia's Arctic Yamal Peninsula, underscores its determination to become
an Arctic player. However, projects like LNG 2, which takes gas from a
Russian Arctic area adjacent to the Yamal Peninsula, have been stalled
due to Western sanctions. Nonetheless, [China seems determined to help
LNG 2 proceed covertly]{.underline}. China's approach to securing
resources is often marked by a long-term perspective. It is willing to
invest in projects that may not yield immediate returns but are crucial
for future resource access and long-term energy security. Another
important element of the Arctic competition is control over critical
infrastructure. As sea ice retreats, new shipping routes like the
Northern Sea Route (NSR) are opening, transforming the region into a
vital hub for maritime trade, potentially depriving the Suez Canal.
[China has expressed a strong interest in the NSR]{.underline}, which
offers a significantly shorter route between Asia and Europe than the
Suez Canal. [The NSR is a key component of China's ambitious Polar Silk
Road]{.underline}, which seeks to connect Asia and Europe while
strengthening global trade. Gaining influence over this crucial shipping
route would provide substantial economic benefits and increase China's
geopolitical power. To secure its position in the Arctic, [China has
proposed investments in Arctic and near-Arctic port facilities like
Arkhangelsk, Russia, as well as transportation infrastructure such as
Russia's Arctic Express No. 1, and nuclear and non-nuclear icebreaker
technology.]{.underline} While these projects face scrutiny and
resistance from some Arctic states, [they underscore China's strategic
intent to establish a foothold in this emerging maritime corridor and
could also enable it to project naval power in the Arctic while securing
vital trade routes.]{.underline}

In recent years, [DoD's]{.underline} Arctic [Strategy]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} [undergone]{.underline} [considerable]{.underline}
[review]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [revision]{.underline}. Indeed,
[current]{.underline} [policy]{.underline} [is]{.underline} drastically
[different]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the policies of [a decade
ago]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} [new]{.underline} strategic
[visions]{.underline} no doubt [have]{.underline}
[heightened]{.underline} our [awareness]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [Arctic's]{.underline} [growing]{.underline}

these policies [are]{.underline} [not without their

[strides]{.underline} [leave]{.underline} [one]{.underline}
[wondering]{.underline}: [Are we doing enough? The United States is an

[acknowledges]{.underline}, for example, the [Arctic]{.underline}

[behind]{.underline} [Russia's]{.underline} [interest]{.underline} in
the region---an interest that transformed into action by the 2000s.
[Likewise]{.underline}, [China]{.underline} ha[s]{.underline}
[been]{.underline} [honing]{.underline} [its]{.underline}
[Arctic]{.underline} [intentions]{.underline} [since]{.underline}
[2013]{.underline}, [when]{.underline} [it]{.underline}

[But]{.underline} it [is]{.underline} [worth]{.underline}

While Earth's climate is changing at a faster pace than ever before,
climatic episodes over the past two thousand years---like the Roman
Climate Optimum (200 BCE--150 CE), the Little Antique Ice Age (300
CE--700 CE), the Medieval warming period (950 CE--1250), and the Little
Ice Age (1350--1850)---offer important perspective. In this era of
human-influenced climate change, these periods tell us that [climate
change does not always spell disaster]{.underline}. Indeed, studies of
these periods tell us that climate influences the conduct or outcome of
war rather than determining it. Our [modern era]{.underline}
o[f]{.underline} climate [change]{.underline} [can]{.underline}
certainly [exacerbate]{.underline} [vulnerabilities]{.underline}

Thanks to global warming, there is less ice at the top of the world. And
less ice, paradoxically, means a surge in demand for icebreakers, the
specialty ships that are seen as the must-have currency to be a player
in a melting world. It's that time again, when the very real warming in
the Arctic---four times greater than the rest of the world---is exceeded
only by superheated predictions of a coming great-power clash in the
High North. Russia's been rattling Arctic sabers for years and is now
being joined by China. [There are renewed worries about a resource
scramble, new shipping lanes where ice floes used to be, greater
military competition, and as always, the icebreaker gap that
periodically frazzles U.S. policymakers. Russia has scores of
icebreakers]{.underline}, specially designed ships that crush ice with
their hulls or shear through it to clear lanes of open water, including
numerous nuclear-powered ones and one (soon two) armed with deck guns.
[China has four, as well as a super-advanced one on the
way]{.underline}. [The United States has just one heavy
icebreaker]{.underline}---the half-century-old Polar Star, which is out
of its annual dry dock after its Antarctic run---and one medium
icebreaker, which is out of action for now after catching fire last
month[. This summer, there are no U.S. missions in the Arctic; China has
three.]{.underline} The United States and a pair of Arctic NATO allies,
Canada and Finland, have announced an ambitious plan to team up and
build scores of icebreakers. U.S. officials have touted the so-called
ICE Pact, announced on the sidelines of July's NATO summit, as a mix of
friendshoring and industrial policy, leavened with a dose of great-power
competition fought with rivets and ratchets, not rockets. But the
looming competition in the Arctic is not like that facing the United
States in other oceans or battlefields. The United States has immense
strategic interests and challenges in the warmer waters of the Western
Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the rest. If the
still-chilly waters of the High North get short shrift in Washington,
it's because whatever may come to pass there takes a back seat to things
that are happening in the wider world. The U.S. Defense Department's new
Arctic Strategy essentially boils down to a watch-and-monitor approach
to an arena that for two decades has been the perennial next great-power
flash point. ["Why do we have trouble seeing ourselves as an Arctic
nation in anything like the same way as Russia does? One of the reasons
is that Russia gets a significant and growing share of its GDP from the
Arctic;]{.underline} we do not," said Rebecca Pincus, director of the
Polar Institute at the Wilson Center. ["The United States is clearly
focused on the Indo-Pacific]{.underline} and Europe, so the Arctic is
not top of mind---[so why the obsession with icebreakers?"]{.underline}
said Pincus, who previously worked on Arctic issues at the Pentagon.
[The short answer is that all the Arctic nations---there are eight, and
seven of them are in NATO]{.underline}---have the icebreakers they need,
except for the United States. [The long answer is that there seems to be
a looming great-power competition up north, and the only way to play is
to have]{.underline} the chips, or [ships. But the even longer answer is
that there is]{.underline} only one gambler at the
table---[Russia]{.underline}---and it has a very definite tell that can
be exploited. [If the competition in the Arctic boils down
to]{.underline} another front in the [rivalry with Russia]{.underline}
(and China is at best a self-proclaimed "near-Arctic state," despite its
frequent polar forays[), then the fight should be in Russian shipyards
and vulnerable Arctic facilities]{.underline}, not in American ones. The
better strategy to combat Russia in [the Arctic]{.underline}, Pincus
suggested, [happens to be the one that the United States and Europe are
already employing: making it harder for Moscow to profitably ply the icy
waters]{.underline}, not just easier for Washington to do so.

North American and European Arctic regions. By [[exercising alongside
Arctic Allies]{.mark} and partners, the Joint Force [will improve
interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline} and gain regional expertise. 1.
Service-specific, Joint, Interagency, and Combined Exercises. [[Security
and stability in the Arctic depend]{.underline}]{.mark}, in part, [[on
the]{.mark} Joint Force's [ability]{.mark} [to respond rapidly and
effectively to threats]{.mark} in the region. [Exercises
increase]{.mark} interoperability with Allies and partners, validate
plans, train [our ability to rapidly deploy to all parts of the Arctic
region]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [provide an opportunity to test
equipment in Arctic conditions]{.underline}. As such, the Joint Force
will continue to exercise frequently in the Arctic through Service
specific training, joint exercises --- to include with USCG ---and
combined exercises with our Allies and partners. DoD will ensure CCMDs
with Arctic equities work toward global integration through joint
exercises and ensure key exercise lessons inform capability requirements
and strategic planning. [[In the]{.mark} North American [Arctic]{.mark}
region, [DoD will]{.mark} leverage]{.underline} ARCTIC EDGE, DoD's
premier [Arctic exercise]{.underline}, and U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's
(USINDOPACOM) NORTHERN EDGE [to develop and [strengthen homeland defense
plans]{.mark}, exercise joint presence,]{.underline} and [highlight
global integration]{.underline} among USNORTHCOM, USEUCOM, and
USINDOPACOM. DoD will also enhance readiness through the U.S. Navy's
biennial Operation ICE CAMP submarine exercise north of Alaska,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. Army's annual Alaska rotation of the
Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center. [To [hone Arctic early
warning and missile defense capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, DoD will
train with Canada through Operation NANOOK and through NORAD and
USNORTHCOM-led operations and exercises NOBLE DEFENDER and VIGILANT
SHIELD. In the European Arctic, the Joint Force will participate in
USEUCOM, NATO, and Ally-hosted exercises such as NORDIC RESPONSE,
DYNAMIC MONGOOSE, and ARCTIC CHALLENGE to ensure the Joint Force is
familiar with the different operating conditions in the European Arctic.

addition to exercises, the Joint Force should conduct wargames,
simulations, and tabletop exercises focusing on the Arctic that
challenge prevailing assumptions and explore potential gaps. The
[experiential learning from these [exercises serves as important Arctic
and climate literacy opportunities]{.mark}, further [strengthening
DoD's]{.mark} strategic planning and [engagement with

along with our [Allies, will continue to conduct routine [operations in
the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [operations will include:
[support]{.mark}ing]{.underline} NORAD's [enforcement of the U.S. and
Canadian air defense identification zones]{.underline} consistent with
international law and custom[; providing integrated [air and missile
defense]{.mark};]{.underline} identifying and [intercepting vessels
within waters under U.S. jurisdiction that are acting inconsistent with
navigation rights reflected]{.underline} in UNCLOS; routinely [deploying
submarines to the region to provide undersea awareness [and bolster
integrated deterrence in defense of U.S. and Allied]{.mark}
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline}; dynamically [deploying ground forces to
the Arctic to demonstrate deterrent capabilities]{.underline};
continuing airborne and maritime patrols with Allies across the Arctic
region to include areas such as the Greenland-IcelandUnited Kingdom gap;
supporting NATO's Air Policing mission in Iceland; and providing airlift
and refueling capability to U.S. and appropriate Ally and partner
aircraft in the Arctic region. 3. Training. To operate in the changing
Arctic environment, the Joint Force must have the requisite skills,
training, and experience. Each Service should regularly train Arctic
capable forces individually and collectively in cold weather operational
skills (e.g., skiing, snowshoeing, unit movement, medical care,
equipment sustainment, and survival) required for successful Joint and
combined operations in an Arctic environment. 4. Defending the Stable
and Open International System. [[Preserving]{.mark} navigational rights
and [freedoms in increasingly accessible Arctic]{.mark} waterways [is
key to maintaining a stable and secure region]{.mark}. [DoD will
continue to monitor potential threats]{.mark} to freedom of navigation

[to]{.mark} all States under customary international law]{.underline} as
reflected in UNCLOS[, and [protect the global mobility of

[Climate change has]{.underline} accelerated strategic competition in
the region among both Arctic and non-Arctic nations, such as China.
Melting sea ice from rising global temperatures has [created new
military and economic opportunities in the region]{.underline}. Since
1979, the Arctic has warmed four times faster than the rest of the
world, according to an August 2022 scientific study published in
Nature.3) As ice rapidly melts in the Arctic, [increased access to
critical rare earth elements, such as platinum, copper, lithium, cobalt,
and nickel emerge]{.underline}. Moreover, melting ice is [opening more
easily traversed Arctic waters]{.underline}, which has led to a surge of
both military and commercial ship activity in the region. These two
developments have increased the potential for conflict in the Arctic.
[Any nation that can effectively mine, process, and refine the materials
will have a strategic advantage.]{.underline} [These minerals are
required for developing technologies ranging from renewable energy
systems to electronics used for national defense.]{.underline} According
to the World Bank, the demand to produce minerals, many of which are
found in the Arctic, could increase by nearly 500 percent by 2050 to
meet the growing demand for clean energy technologies.4) China already
dominates the global supply chain for critical materials. [The United
States depends on these materials for its economic competitiveness and
national defense.5) As ice melts, new routes are emerging that are more
navigable. This has resulted in more ship activity in the
region.]{.underline} For instance, the Arctic Council Working Group on
the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment reports that there has
been a 37 percent increase in ship numbers and distance sailed in the
Arctic over the past ten years.6[) While much of this activity is
commercial, Russia and China have also taken advantage of the new sea
routes to project their naval power.]{.underline} They have carried out
numerous regional deployments and patrols, demonstrating their ability
to execute military operations in the austere Arctic climate.7) The
expanded presence of Russian and Chinese ships in the region poses a
growing threat to NATO member states. In October 2023, Finnish
investigators suspected the Chinese vessel NewNew Polar Bear of dragging
its anchor over the seabed and severing three Baltic telecom cables and
one pipeline. While the international community has not assigned blame
wholly to China, [China later admitted to accidentally destroying an
important gas pipeline]{.underline} connecting Finland and Estonia in
the Baltic Sea in 2024. These examples [suggest that incidents of this
nature could become more likely as military activity increases in the
region.8)]{.underline}

#### Loss of hegemony causes global wars and extinction

**Keck 2014---Managing Editor of The Diplomat** (Zachary, "America's
Relative Decline: Should We Panic?",
<http://thediplomat.com/2014/01/americas-relative-decline-should-we-panic/>,
CMR)

Still, [on balance, [the U.S. has been a positive force in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially for a unipolar power. Certainly,
[it's hard to imagine many other countries acting as
benignly]{.underline} if they possessed the amount of relative power
America had at the end of the Cold War. Indeed, the British were not
nearly as powerful as the U.S. in the 19th Century and they incorporated
most of the globe in their colonial empire. Even when it had to contend
with another superpower, Russia occupied half a continent by brutally
suppressing its populace. Had the U.S. collapsed and the Soviet Union
emerged as the Cold War victor, Western Europe would likely be speaking
Russian by now. [[It's difficult to imagine China defending a
rule-based]{.mark}, open international [order if it were a unipolar
power]{.mark}, much less making an effort to uphold a minimum level of
human rights in the world]{.underline}. Regardless of your opinion on
U.S. global leadership over the last two decades, however, [[there is
good reason to fear]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[relative decline]{.mark}
compared with China]{.underline} and other emerging nations. To begin
with, [[hegemonic transition periods have]{.mark} historically [been the
most destabilizing eras]{.mark} in history]{.underline}. This is not
only because of the malign intentions of the rising and established
power(s). [Even if all the parties have benign, peaceful intentions,
[the rise of new global powers necessitates revisions to the
"rules]{.mark} of the road." [This is nearly impossible to do in any
organized fashion]{.mark} given the anarchic nature of the international
system, where]{.underline} there is [no central authority]{.underline}
that [can govern interactions]{.underline} between states. We are
already starting to see the potential dangers of hegemonic transition
periods in the Asia-Pacific (and arguably the Middle East). [As China
grows more]{.underline} economically and militarily [powerful, it
has]{.underline} unsurprisingly [sought to expand its influence in East
Asia. This]{.underline} necessarily [has to come at the expense of other
powers]{.underline}, which so far has primarily meant the U.S., Japan,
Vietnam and the Philippines. Naturally, [these]{.underline} powers [have
sought to resist Chinese encroachments on their territory and influence,
and [the situation grows more tense with each passing
day]{.mark}]{.underline}. Should China eventually emerge as a global
power, or should nations in other regions enjoy a similar rise as Kenny
suggests, this situation will play itself out elsewhere in the years and
decades ahead. [All of [this highlights]{.mark}]{.underline} some of
[[the advantages of a unipolar system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Namely,
[although [the U.S.]{.mark} has asserted military force]{.underline}
quite [frequently]{.underline} in the post-Cold War era, [it [has only
fought weak powers and]{.mark} thus its [wars have been fairly
limited]{.mark} in terms of]{.underline} the number of
[casualties]{.underline} involved. At the same time, [[America's]{.mark}
preponderance of [power has prevented a great power war]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} even [restrained major regional powers]{.mark} from coming
to blows.]{.underline} For instance, [[the past 25 years haven't seen
any conflicts on par with]{.mark} [the]{.mark} Israeli-Arab or Iran-Iraq
[wars of the Cold War]{.mark}. As the unipolar era comes to a close,
[the possibility of great power conflict and]{.mark} especially [major
regional wars rises]{.mark} dramatically. The world will also have to
contend with conventionally inferior powers]{.underline} like Japan
[acquiring nuclear weapons to protect their interests]{.underline}
against their newly empowered rivals. But [[even if]{.mark} the
[transitions]{.mark}]{.underline} caused by China's and potentially
other nations' rises [[are managed successfully]{.mark}, [there
are]{.mark}]{.underline} still likely to be [[significant negative
effects on]{.mark} international [relations]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
today's "globalized" world, [it is commonly asserted that [many of the
defining challenges of our era can only be solved through]{.mark}
multilateral [cooperation]{.mark}. [Examples]{.mark}]{.underline} of
this [[include]{.mark} [climate]{.mark} change, health
[pandemics]{.mark}]{.underline}, organized crime and
[[terrorism]{.mark}, global financial crises, [and]{.mark} the
[proliferation]{.mark} of weapons of mass destruction]{.underline},
among many others. [[A unipolar system]{.mark},]{.underline} for all its
limitations, [[is uniquely suited for organizing effective global
action]{.mark} on these transnational issues]{.underline}. This is
because [[there is a clear global leader]{.mark} [who can]{.mark} take
the initiative and]{.underline}, to some degree, [[compel others]{.mark}
to fall in line]{.underline}. In addition, [[the unipole's preponderance
of power lessens the intensity of competition]{.mark} among the global
players involved]{.underline}. Thus, while there are no shortages of
complaints about the limitations of global governance today, there is no
question that [global governance has been many times more effective in
the last 25 years than it was during the Cold War]{.underline}.

Each of these geopolitical challenges is different, and each reflects
the distinctive interests, ambitions, and history of the country
undertaking it. Yet [there is **growing cooperation** between the
countries that are **challenging** the **regional pillars of the
U.S.-led order.** **Russia** and **China** have **collaborated**
on]{.underline} issues such as energy, sales and development of
**[military technology]{.underline}**, opposition to additional U.S.
military deployments on the Korean peninsula, and naval exercises from
the South China Sea to the Baltic. In Syria, [Iran provided the **shock
troops** that helped keep Russia's ally]{.underline}, Bashar [al-Assad,
in power]{.underline}, as Moscow provided the air power and the
diplomatic cover. "[Our **cooperation** can **isolate
America**]{.underline}," supreme leader Ali Khamenei told Putin in 2017.
More broadly, [what links these challenges together is their
**opposition** to the constellation of **power, norms, and
relationships** that the U.S.-led order entails, and in their propensity
to use **violence**]{.underline}, coercion, and intimidation [as means
of making that opposition **effective**]{.underline}. Taken
collectively, [these challenges constitute a **geopolitical sea
change**]{.underline} from the post-Cold War era.¶ [The revival of
**great-power competition** entails]{.underline} higher international
tensions than the world has known for decades, and the revival of
[**arms races, security dilemmas**, and **other artifacts** of a more
**dangerous past**. It entails **sharper conflicts** over the
international rules]{.underline} of the road on issues ranging from
freedom of navigation to the illegitimacy of altering borders by force,
[and **intensifying competitions** over states that reside at the
intersection of rival powers' **areas of interest**]{.underline}. It
requires confronting the prospect that [**rival powers** could
**overturn** the **favorable regional balances** that have
**underpinned** the U.S.-led order for decades, and that they might
construct **rival spheres of influence**]{.underline} from which America
and the liberal ideas it has long promoted would be excluded. Finally,
it necessitates recognizing that [great-power rivalry could lead to
**great-power war**]{.underline}, a prospect that seemed to have
followed the Soviet empire onto the ash heap of history.¶ Both
[**Beijing** and **Moscow** are]{.underline}, after all, [**optimizing
their forces** and **exercising aggressively** in preparation for
potential **conflicts** with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its allies; [Russian doctrine explicitly
emphasizes the]{.underline} limited [use of **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} to achieve escalation dominance in a war with
Washington. In Syria, [U.S. and Russian forces even came into **deadly
contact**]{.underline} in early 2018. American airpower decimated a
contingent of government-sponsored Russian mercenaries that was
attacking a base at which U.S. troops were present, an incident
demonstrating the increasing boldness of Russian operations and the
corresponding potential for escalation. [The world]{.underline} has not
yet returned to the epic clashes for global dominance that characterized
the twentieth century, but it [has returned to the **historical norm**
of **great-power struggle**]{.underline}, with all the associated
dangers.¶ Those dangers may be even greater than most observers
appreciate, because if today's great-power competitions are still most
intense at the regional level, who is to say where these competitions
will end? By all appearances, [Russia **does not simply want to be** a
"**regional power**"]{.underline} (as Obama cuttingly described it) that
dominates South Ossetia and Crimea.37 [It **aspires** to the **deep
European** and **extra-regional impact** that **previous incarnations**
of the Russian state enjoyed]{.underline}. Why else would Putin boast
about how far his troops can drive into Eastern Europe? [**Why else**
would Moscow]{.underline} be **[deploy]{.underline}**ing military power
[into the **Middle East?**]{.underline} [**Why else** would it be
continuing to cultivate]{.underline} intelligence and [**military
relationships** in regions as remote as **Latin America?**]{.underline}¶
Likewise, [China is **today** focused primarily on securing its own
**geopolitical neighborhood**, but its ambitions for **tomorrow** are
**clearly much bolder.**]{.underline} Beijing probably does not envision
itself fully overthrowing the international order, simply because it has
profited far too much from the U.S.-anchored global economy. Yet [China
has nonetheless positioned itself for a **global challenge** to **U.S.
influence**]{.underline}. [Chinese military forces are deploying **ever
farther** from China's immediate periphery; Beijing has **projected
power** into the **Arctic** and **established bases** and **logistical
points** in the **Indian Ocean** and **Horn of Africa**]{.underline}.
Popular Chinese movies depict Beijing replacing Washington as the
dominant actor in sub-Saharan Africa---a fictional representation of a
real-life effort long under way. [The **Belt and Road Initiative**
bespeaks an aspiration to **link** China to countries throughout
**Central Asia, the Middle East, and Europe**]{.underline}; BRI, AIIB,
and RCEP look like the beginning of an alternative institutional
architecture to rival Washington's. In 2017, [Xi]{.underline} Jinping
[told the]{.underline} [Nineteenth National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party that Beijing could]{.underline} now "**[take center
stage in the world]{.underline}**" [and act as an **alternative** to
**U.S. leadership**]{.underline}.38¶ These ambitions may or may not be
realistic. But they demonstrate just how significantly the world's
leading authoritarian powers desire to shift the global environment over
time. The **[revisionism]{.underline}** we are seeing today [may
therefore be **only the beginning**]{.underline}. As [China's power
**continues to grow,** or if it is successful in **dominating the
Western Pacific**, it will **surely move on** to **grander
endeavors**]{.underline}. If Russia reconsolidates control over the
former Soviet space, it may seek to bring parts of the former Warsaw
Pact to heel. Historically, [this has been a recurring pattern of
**great-power behavior**---interests **expand with power**, the appetite
**grows** with the eating, **risk-taking** increases as **early
gambles** are seen to **pay off**]{.underline}.39 This pattern is
precisely why the revival of great-power competition is so
concerning---because [**geopolitical revisionism** by **unsatisfied
major powers** has so often presaged **intensifying international
conflict**,]{.underline} confrontation, [and]{.underline} even
**[war]{.underline}**. The great-power behavior occurring today
represents the warning light flashing on the dashboard. It tells us
there may be still-greater traumas to come.¶ The threats today are
compelling and urgent, and there may someday come a time when the
balance of power has shifted so markedly that the postwar international
system cannot be sustained. Yet that moment of failure has not yet
arrived, and so the goal of U.S. strategy should be not to hasten it by
giving up prematurely, but to push it off as far into the future as
possible. Rather [than simply **acquiescing**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the **[decline]{.underline}** of a world it spent
generations building, [America should **aggressively bolster its
defenses**, with an eye to **preserving** and perhaps even selectively
**advancing** its remarkable achievements.]{.underline}

current presidents of the United States, [**China, and Russia, find**
**intuitively attractive**]{.underline}. But were such an order to
replace one based on global integration and American leadership in the
geopolitical cockpits of Europe and Asia, [it would only engender
**insecurity and conflict**.]{.underline} [In a spheres-of-influence
world]{.underline}, [great powers order their regions]{.underline}. The
United States would go back to a "Monroe Doctrine" version of grand
strategy; [Russia would dominate]{.underline} the [former Soviet space;
China would govern East Asia]{.underline}, [and India South
Asia]{.underline}. The problem with this kind of order, however, is
several-fold. Too many [spheres overlap]{.underline} [in ways that
**would generate conflict**]{.underline} [rather than clean lines of
responsibility]{.underline}. [Japan would oppose Chinese suzerainty in
East Asia, including by **developing nuclear weapons**]{.underline};
[India and China would **compete vigorously**]{.underline} [in Southeast
Asia]{.underline}; **[Russia and China would contest the resources and
loyalties of Central Asia]{.underline}**; [Europe and Russia would clash
over primacy of Central and Eastern Europe. The Middle East would be an
even more likely arena for hot war between Saudi Arabia and
Iran]{.underline}, [and Turkey would contest regions]{.underline} also
[claimed by Russia]{.underline}, [Europe]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
possibly [China]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline}, like the Soviet
Empire before it, [would keep pushing west until it met enough hard
power to stop it]{.underline}. [A spheres of influence
world]{.underline} [would]{.underline} also **[sharpen great power
competition]{.underline}** [outside of each region]{.underline}.
[Regional hegemony is a **springboard** for global
contestation]{.underline}. [China would be more likely to challenge the
United States out-of-area if it had subdued **strategic
competition**]{.underline} in its own region. [Russia]{.underline}, like
the Soviet Empire before it, [would keep pushing west until it met
enough hard power to stop it]{.underline}. (The fact that Russian troops
marched through Paris during the Napoleonic Wars demonstrates that the
limits of Russian power need not be confined to the former Warsaw Pact).
American leaders have long understood that a "Fortress America" approach
is a source of national insecurity. Franklin Roosevelt made this case in
a series of "fireside chats" in the run-up to America's participation in
World War II --- even before the advent of the far more sophisticated
power-projection technologies that exist today. Roosevelt and his
generals well understood that the United States could not be safe if
hostile powers controlled Europe and Asia, despite the wide oceans
separating North America from both theaters. A [spheres-of-influence
world would]{.underline} also **[crack up]{.underline}** [the integrated
global economy]{.underline} that underlies the miracle in human welfare
that has lifted billions out of poverty in past decades. [It would
replicate the **exclusive economic blocs**]{.underline} [of the
1930s]{.underline}, [including an East Asia]{.underline} "co-prosperity
sphere," [seeding conflict and undercutting prosperity]{.underline}. A
real-world and real-time example of what happens when American power
retreats in an effort to encourage regional powers to solve their own
problems is the mess in Syria. It has produced the greatest refugee
crisis since 1945 --- a stain on the consciousness of human
civilization --- and has led many to conclude that the Middle Eastern
order of states dating to the end of World War 1 is collapsing.
President Obama pursued an express policy of retracting American
military power from the Middle East, including withdrawing all troops
from Iraq and refusing to intervene militarily when President Assad used
chemical weapons against his own people, despite a red-line injunction
from the United States not to do so. Obama and his White House political
advisors believed that American withdrawal from the Arab Middle East (if
not from the ironclad U.S. commitment to Israel) would lead a new
balance of power to form, one policed by regional powers rather than by
America[. This flawed]{.underline}, amoral, and [un-strategic **approach
has led to a series of hot wars **]{.underline}--- in [Syria, Iraq, and
Yemen]{.underline} --- the [collapse of Arab allies' confidence in the
United States as an ally]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} an
[**intensified** cold war with Iran]{.underline}. [Despite the
international agreement]{.underline} freezing Iran's nuclear program,
[Iran's support for terrorism and hostile insurgencies targeting
American allies across its region actually **intensified** during this
period]{.underline}. A [spheres-of-influence]{.underline} world [leaves
weaker states to become the victims of stronger]{.underline} or more
[aggressive ones]{.underline}, and [it seeds **insecurity**
by]{.underline} [removing the reassuring variable of American military
guarantees and presence]{.underline} This experience underlines a core
problem with a [spheres-of-influence]{.underline} world. It leaves
weaker states to become the victims of stronger or more aggressive ones,
and it seeds insecurity by removing the reassuring variable of American
military guarantees and presence. [It emboldens American adversaries and
leads American allies to take self-help measures that themselves may
undercut American security interests]{.underline}. A
[spheres-of-influence world]{.underline} would also [produce
contestation of the open global commons]{.underline} [that are the basis
for the **unprecedented prosperity**]{.underline} produced by the
liberal international economic order. [Should the Indian and Pacific
Oceans]{.underline}, or the [Arctic and Mediterranean Seas]{.underline},
[become arenas of great-power conflict]{.underline} (like the South
China Sea already has thanks to China's militarization and unilateral
assertion of sovereignty over it) [as leading states seek to incorporate
them into their privileged zones of control]{.underline}, [economic
globalization would **collapse**, harming the economies of every major
power.]{.underline} [The United States]{.underline}, because of its
sheer power and resource base as well as its relative geographical
isolation, [might do OK]{.underline} in a spheres-of-influence world.
Most of [America's friends and allies would not]{.underline}. [Their
weakening and insecurity would in turn render the United States weaker
and more insecure]{.underline} --- since [**U.S. allies are
force-multipliers for American hard** and soft **power**]{.underline},
and since norms like [freedom of the global commons]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} in fact [underwritten by that power]{.underline}. More
broadly, [such a transition]{.underline} [would]{.underline} also likely
lead [to the kind of **hot wars** that **reorder the international
balance of power**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} by
**[incentivizing aggressive states to push out and assert regional
dominion]{.underline}**, [knowing that America does not have the will or
interest to oppose them]{.underline}. [The fact that]{.underline} U.S.
[competitors]{.underline} such as [Russia]{.underline},
[China]{.underline}, [and Iran]{.underline} --- all of whom want to
weaken the American-led world order --- [would welcome a
spheres-of-influence world is another reason for Americans to oppose
it]{.underline}. It would also be ironic if the United States were to
back away from its historic commitment to shaping a world that is an
idealized vision of America itself --- one ruled by laws, norms,
institutions, markets, and peaceful settlement of disputes.

While relentlessly pursuing its genocidal policy to destroy Ukraine as a
nation and Ukrainians as a distinct national and ethnic group, [Moscow
has been pushing an international agenda of a \'new world order' to
replace the Western-led, rules-based system of
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations. The West's weak
response to Russia's threat to international peace has catalysed an
imploding of the global security order. [We are facing an emboldened
Sino-Russian alliance which strongly believes there is a window of
opportunity to gain the power to set the rules for a]{.underline} new,
unfree [world, ruled by force.]{.underline} Russia's large-scale
destruction of Ukraine is tangible evidence of how [international peace
can crumble in front of our eyes when rogue actors who seek to detonate
it demonstrate more determination and resolve than those
who]{.underline} purport to [defend it.]{.underline} The free world's
demonstrable lack of resolute will to uphold international law is a
major factor in the current global crisis and invites further chaos and
violence. [This historic moment calls for urgent revision of the current
Western course of conspicuously inadequate actions to remove the threat
of Russia as the linchpin of the anti-Western]{.underline},
anti-democratic [axis]{.underline}. **[If the world is to avoid a new
global conflict, Western policy must be refocused on a full commitment
to defending the principles of the liberal rules-based
order]{.underline}** that is designed to make the world safer. The
Russian Threat Vladimir Putin's Russia is not just an existential threat
to Ukraine. [Russia\'s aggressive]{.underline}, revanchist [regime is
the origin point of the international anti-Western axis]{.underline}.
Just as at other critical moments in its history, [Russia is once again
redefining itself through confrontation with the West]{.underline}.
[Moscow is challenging Western primacy]{.underline} in international
relations in order [to reclaim its status of global power]{.underline}.
For the Kremlin, the freedom to act above and outside the limits and
restrictions of international law is the symbol of such supremacy. For
the past two decades, the world has been observing an escalating
\'Russia crisis\' -- the critical threat posed by a criminal,
militarised, totalitarian, aggressive, revanchist and genocidal regime
to international peace. Rather than countering the growing threat,
Western policy has relied on the \'too big to fail' approach in dealing
with Moscow. Consequently, Russia has largely enjoyed protection from
the consequences of its criminal actions, and has been able to continue
pursuing its nefarious strategic course. Moscow's goal is to replace the
current liberal, rules-based international system with a 'new world
order', where the role of the West is notably reduced. This was Vladimir
Putin's message in speeches given in 2014, 2023 and 2024. In 2014, Putin
made a threatening warning which made clear that Russia will have no
limits in pursuing this goal: '\... changes in the world order -- and
what we are seeing today are events on this scale -- have usually been
accompanied by, if not global war and conflict, then by chains of
intensive local-level conflicts.' Russia's hostile ambitions were
spelled out formally when, in 2021, Moscow issued an ultimatum to NATO,
publicly outlining its far-reaching demands for a dangerous level of
influence over the eastern flank of the alliance. Western powers
continue to treat Russia as a pillar of the strategic global balance, as
a consequence of which their policy towards Russian aggression has been
ultimately premised on Kyiv making concessions to Moscow Moscow's
determination to defy the West has been severely underestimated. [The
quest for a 'new world order', driven by the Sino-Russian alliance, is
changing global dynamics]{.underline}. In essence, [the new Eastern-led
order is based on]{.underline} taking advantage of the globalised
economy while [destroying the liberal rules-based international
order.]{.underline} Rogue regimes in Iran, North Korea, Syria, Venezuela
and Belarus are being legitimised. The expanding BRICS group is building
an alternative economic system of the \'global majority' to provide
shelter from Western sanctions and ensure global political dominance.

WHAT IT TAKES

This strategy will require investment. [The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs to]{.mark} maintain the defense
capabilities sufficient to [deny]{.mark} [China, Russia,]{.mark} and
[Iran]{.mark} their [strategic goals]{.mark}.]{.underline} The war in
Ukraine has revealed weaknesses in the U.S. defense industrial base that
must be remedied. Critical reforms need to be made to the defense
budgeting process, which is inadequate to this task. Congress must
strive to enhance the Defense Department's long-term strategic planning
process, as well as its ability to adapt to evolving threats. The
Pentagon should also work with Congress to gain greater efficiencies
from the amount it already spends. Costs can be reduced in part by
speeding up the Pentagon's slow procurement and acquisition processes so
that the military can better harness the remarkable technology coming
out of the private sector. Beyond military capabilities, the United
States must rebuild the other elements of its diplomatic toolkit---such
as information operations---that have eroded since the Cold War.

[The United States and other democracies must [win the
tech]{.mark}nological arms [race, since]{.mark} in the future,
transformative technologies [will be the most important source
of]{.mark} national [power]{.mark}]{.underline}. The debate about the
balance between regulation and innovation is just beginning. But while
the possible downsides should be acknowledged, [ultimately it is [more
important to unleash]{.mark} these [tech]{.mark}nologies' potential
[for]{.mark} [societal good and]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Chinese progress can be slowed but not
stopped]{.underline}, and the United States will have to run fast and
hard to win this race. [[Democracies will in]{.mark}vestigate these
technologies, call congressional hearings about them, and [debate their
impact]{.mark} openly. [Authoritarians will not]{.mark}. For this
reason, among many others, authoritarians must not triumph.]{.underline}

The good news is that [given the behavior of China and Russia, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [[allies are ready to
contribute]{.mark} to the common defense. Many countries in the
Asia-Pacific region, including [Australia]{.mark}, the
[Philippines]{.mark}, and [Japan, recognize the threat a]{.mark}nd
appear committed to addressing it. Relations between Japan and South
Korea are better than ever.]{.underline} [Moscow's recent agreements
with Pyongyang have alarmed Seoul and should deepen its cooperation with
democratic allies. [India]{.mark}, through]{.underline} its membership
in the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue---also known as [the
Quad,]{.underline} the strategic partnership that also includes
Australia, Japan, and the United States---[[is cooperating]{.mark}
closely with the U.S. military and emerging as a pivotal power in the
Indo-Pacific. [Vietnam]{.mark}, too, appears willing to
contribute,]{.underline} given its own strategic concerns with China.
The challenge will be to turn the ambitions of U.S. partners into
sustained commitment once the costs of enhanced defense capabilities
become clear.

[In Europe, the war in [Ukraine]{.mark} has [mobilized NATO]{.mark} in
ways unimaginable a few years ago. The addition of [Sweden and
Finland]{.mark} to NATO's Arctic flank brings real military capability
and [helps secure the Baltic states. ]{.mark}]{.underline}The question
of postwar security arrangements for Ukraine hangs over the continent at
this moment. The most straightforward answer would be to admit Ukraine
to NATO and simultaneously to the European Union. Both institutions have
accession processes that would take some time. [The key point is this:
[Moscow needs to know]{.mark} that the [alliance does not intend to
leave a vacuum]{.mark} in Europ]{.underline}e.

The United States also needs a strategy for dealing with the nonaligned
states of the global South. These countries will insist on strategic
flexibility, and Washington should resist the urge to issue loyalty
tests. Rather, it should develop policies that address their concerns.
Above all, the United States needs a meaningful alternative to the Belt
and Road Initiative, China's massive global infrastructure program. The
[[BRI is]{.underline}]{.mark} often depicted as helping China win hearts
and minds, but in reality it is [[not winning anything.]{.mark}
Recipients are growing frustrated with the [corruption]{.mark}, [poor
safety and labor]{.mark} standards, and [fiscal unsustainability]{.mark}
associated with its projects. The aid that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [Europe, Japan, and others offer is small by
comparison, but unlike Chinese aid, it can attract significant foreign
direct investment from the private sector, thus dwarfing the amount
provided by the BRI.]{.underline} But you can't beat something with
nothing. A U.S. strategy that shows no interest in a region until China
shows up is not going to succeed. [[Washington needs]{.mark} to
demonstrate sustained [engagement]{.mark} with countries [in]{.mark} the
global South on the issues they care about---namely, [economic
development, security]{.mark}, and [climate]{.mark} change.]{.underline}

WHICH WAY, AMERICA?

The pre--World War II era was defined not only by great-power conflict
and a weak international order but also by a rising tide of populism and
isolationism. So is the current era. The main question hanging over the
international system today is, Where does America stand?

The biggest difference between the first half of the twentieth century
and the second half was the fact of Washington's sustained and
purposeful global engagement. After World War II, the United States was
a confident country, with a baby boom, a growing middle class, and
unbridled optimism about the future. The struggle against communism
provided bipartisan unity, even if there were sometimes disagreements
over specific policies. Most agreed with President John F. Kennedy that
their country was willing to "pay any price, bear any burden" in the
defense of freedom.

The United States is a different country now---exhausted by eight
decades of international leadership, some of it successful and
appreciated, and some of it dismissed as failure. The American people
are different, too---less confident in their institutions and in the
viability of the American dream. Years of divisive rhetoric, Internet
echo chambers, and, even among the best-educated youth, ignorance of the
complexity of history have left Americans with a tattered sense of
shared values. For the latter problem, elite cultural institutions bear
much of the blame. They have rewarded those who tear down the United
States and ridiculed those who extol its virtues. To address Americans'
lack of faith in their institutions and in one another, schools and
colleges must change their curricula to offer a more balanced view of
U.S. history. And instead of creating a climate that reinforces one's
existing opinions, these and other institutions should encourage a
healthy debate in which competing ideas are encouraged.

That said, great-power DNA is still very much in the American genome.
Americans carry two contradictory thoughts simultaneously. One side of
the brain looks at the world and thinks that the United States has done
enough, saying, "It is someone else's turn." The other side looks abroad
and sees a large country trying to extinguish a smaller one, children
choking on nerve gas, or a terrorist group beheading a journalist and
says, "We must act." The president can appeal to either side.

The new Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse---[[populism, nativism,
isolationism, and protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}---tend to ride
together, and they [[are challenging the]{.mark} political [center. Only
the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can
counter their advance]{.underline}]{.mark} and resist the temptation to
go back to the future. [But generating support for an internationalist
foreign policy requires a president to paint a vivid picture of what
that world would be like [without an active U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. In such a world, [an emboldened [Putin
and Xi,]{.mark} having defeated Ukraine, would [move on to]{.mark} their
[next conquest. Iran would celebrate]{.mark} the United States'
withdrawal from the Middle East and sustain its illegitimate regime
[by]{.mark} external [conquest]{.mark} through its proxies]{.underline}.
[[Hamas]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Hezbollah]{.underline}]{.mark} would
[[launch]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[wars]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
hopes that Gulf Arab states would normalize relations with Israel would
be dashed. [The international [economy]{.mark} would be
[weaker]{.mark}]{.underline}, sapping U.S. growth. [[International
waters would be contested]{.underline}]{.mark}, with piracy and other
incidents at sea stalling the movement of goods. American leaders should
remind the public that a reluctant United States has repeatedly been
drawn into conflict---in 1917, 1941, and 2001. Isolation has never been
the answer to the country's security or prosperity.

Then, a leader must say that the United States is well positioned to
design a different future. The country's endlessly creative private
sector is capable of continuous innovation. The United States has an
unparalleled and secure energy bounty from Canada to Mexico that can
sustain it through a reasonable energy transition over the many years it
will take. It has more allies than any great power in history and good
friends, as well. People around the world seeking a better life still
dream of becoming Americans. If the United States can summon the will to
deal with its immigration puzzle, it will not suffer the demographic
calamity that faces most of the developed world.

The United States' global involvement will not look exactly as it has
for the last 80 years. Washington is likely to choose its engagements
more carefully. If deterrence is strong, that may be enough. Allies will
have to bear more of the cost of defending themselves. Trade agreements
will be less ambitious and global but more regional and selective.

Internationalists must admit that they had a blind spot for those
Americans, such as the unemployed coal miner and steelworker, who lost
out as good jobs fled abroad. And the forgotten did not take kindly to
the argument that they should shut up and be happy with cheap Chinese
goods. This time, there can be no more platitudes about the advantages
of globalization for all. There must be a real effort to give people
meaningful education, skills, and job training. The task is even more
urgent since technological progress will severely punish those who
cannot keep up.

Those who argue for engagement will need to reframe what it means. [The
80 years of U.S. internationalism is another analogy that doesn't
perfectly fit the circumstances of today. Still, if the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries taught Americans anything, it is this: [other
great powers]{.mark} don't mind their own business. Instead, they [seek
to shape the global order.]{.mark} The [future will be]{.mark}
determined by the [alliance of democratic]{.mark}, free-market [states
or]{.mark} it will be determined by the [revisionist
powers,]{.mark}]{.underline} [harking back to a day of territorial
[conquest]{.mark} abroad [and authoritarian practices]{.mark} at home.
There is simply no other option.]{.underline}

​The [stability of the international system has long been closely related
to the stability of the key regions of Eurasia: [Europe]{.mark}, the
[Middle East]{.mark} and [East Asia. War]{.mark} or the threat of war
[pervades all three]{.mark} areas at once.]{.underline}

This makes a final feature of our era more sobering: a [still
powerful,]{.underline} but less reliable, [[America]{.mark}. US
[advantages]{.mark}, economic and military, remain [substantial]{.mark},
and American [commitment]{.mark} remains [indispensable]{.mark} to a
decent world]{.underline}. Unfortunately, at a time when many Western
countries face political paralysis, instability, or some mixture of the
two, America's own internal dramas could be uniquely damaging.

Yes, the near-term danger is a second Trump presidency that could weaken
US alliances and spur frontline states like Poland or South Korea to
build their own nuclear weapons --- or, alternatively, a second Biden
presidency in which America is led by a visibly declining
commander-in-chief. But the problems run deeper.

Lurking behind Trump is a larger America First movement that would just
as soon leave the world to itself. Lurking behind Biden is a potentially
potent form of progressive neo-isolationism. The political foundations
of American internationalism are thus unstable. Rising polarization and
domestic tensions could leave the US distracted, even consumed by its
inner demons --- just as surging global volatility makes the price of
that distraction higher.

World War III?

Eras of turmoil can bring happy endings. The Cold War birthed the
liberal international order, which eventually delivered more freedom,
peace and prosperity than humanity had ever enjoyed before. Today,
realism need not be synonymous with despondency, because [the [US
and]{.mark} its democratic [allies]{.mark} still [have]{.mark}
**[long-term advantages]{.mark}** over their foes, including their free
governmental institutions.]{.underline} But for political leaders and
business leaders, navigating this age of fragmentation will require
keeping some core principles in mind.

First, [there is no return to "normal." Today's [crises in
Ukraine]{.mark}, the [Mid]{.mark}dle [East]{.mark} and other
[hotspots]{.mark}]{.underline} aren't freak occurrences. They are
[[symptoms of]{.mark} deep, ongoing [shifts]{.mark} that are changing
the basic rhythms of global affairs.]{.underline}

Particular crises may come and go; particular tensions may rise or fall.
But leaders in government and business must prepare for an era of
persistent vitality, competition and conflict. [[Levels of risk]{.mark},
both strategic and economic, will be [elevated]{.mark} for years to
come.]{.underline}

Second, you can't have it all. After the Cold War, the US and its allies
could enjoy a world that was phenomenally congenial to their interests
and values at a very low price. Multinationals could exploit the
efficiencies globalization offered without worrying too much about the
vicissitudes of global politics. Neither approach is sustainable today.

As the leaders who attended this month's NATO summit can attest, the
cost of national security, and of safeguarding democratic values, is
rising as autocratic powers make their moves. Meanwhile, Western
companies that had to choose whether to stay in Russia after it invaded
Ukraine --- or are wondering how to protect their assets, operations and
reputations if China invades Taiwan --- are discovering that the
dilemmas of operating in a hothouse environment can be severe.

Third, [**[take worst-case]{.mark}** scenarios
**[seriously]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Responsible American officials
need to [consider]{.mark} not just the possibility of a [US-Russia clash
or]{.mark} a [US-China conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} --- as cataclysmic
as either would be --- [but also a **[global war,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in which [conflicts in multiple theaters erupt at once.]{.underline}
International corporations also need to grapple with scenarios that
would have seemed outlandish not so long ago.

[What if the security of vital sea lanes suffers because the Houthis
have set a precedent that others follow? How might their operations be
affected by a Sino-American war that causes a decoupling more
violent]{.underline}, precipitous and far-reaching than nearly anyone
envisions today? We can hope these situations won't come to pass. But
grappling with them is how one builds the resilience, whether military
or intellectual, needed to thrive in a tumultuous world.

Fourth, as geopolitics and geoeconomics become inseparable, the West
needs to invest in new knowledge. In government, national security is no
longer so thoroughly dominated by diplomats and defense nerds.
Understanding investment patterns, financial and technological choke
points, and private sector decision-making has become crucial to
prevailing in modern rivalry. The private sector, for its part, is
entering a moment in which geopolitical illiteracy is simply negligent ,
given that few firms are wholly insulated from the disruption --- or
opportunity --- national rivalries can cause.

This relates to a final precept: Find the upside of adversity. Yes, the
world is getting nastier. But an age of [[fracture creates chances
for]{.mark} the [US to build]{.mark} deeper
[connections]{.mark}]{.underline} with like-minded nations in Europe and
the Indo-Pacific, [to [catalyze]{.mark}]{.underline} a historic burst of
[[innovation]{.mark} in critical technologies]{.underline}, and to
[[demonstrate]{.mark} that [liberal societies]{.mark} can still
[outperform]{.mark} illiberal ones.]{.underline}

It creates chances, as well, for firms to craft more resilient supply
chains; to reap the benefits of the new industrial policy; and to forge
stronger partnerships with a US government that desperately needs
private-sector creativity and innovation to master a new set of
economic, intelligence and military challenges.

We're in the opening phase of a brutally contentious era. The task is to
make the most of it.

dead, displaced, and hungry due to **fighting**]{.underline} [that is
higher than at any time in decades.]{.underline}

Generalizing about what drives the turmoil is hard, given each

crumbl]{.mark}ing**]{.underline}. [More see opportunities [to
**pursue**]{.mark} ends by **[violent means]{.mark}** or fear losing out
if they hold back.]{.underline}

Most governments, of course, do not seek to crush rivals at home or
sponsor proxies abroad, let alone annex neighbors or kill civilians en
masse. But [more are taking things into their own hands]{.underline}.
Increasingly[, the main check on their actions is how much fight their
foes can put up.]{.underline}

[If]{.underline} **[adventurism]{.underline}** [is on the rise, its
knock-on effects]{.underline}---how rivals sensing the same loosened
fetters might react---[are harder to foresee]{.underline}.
**[Interlinked conflicts]{.underline}** [make]{.underline} **[unintended
consequences]{.underline}** [likelier]{.underline}. Yahya Sinwar, the
Hamas leader who masterminded the Oct. 7 assault, surely underestimated
the ruin that a largely unrestrained Israel would wreak on Gaza in
response.

Even Israel, for all its spycraft, did not predict that its hammering of
Hezbollah in Lebanon would help a reformed al Qaeda offshoot seize
Damascus. (Syria's new ruler, despite his jihadi past, says he's not
looking for a fight with Israel.)

Trump's return brings fresh uncertainty. In Europe, the Asia-Pacific,
and the Middle East, Trump's promises are often contradictory, as are
the views of his cabinet picks and loyalists. If he doubles down on
confrontation, how much risk will he tolerate? If he seeks deals, what
trade-offs might they entail, and what might the implications be for
U.S. allies? Outside those arenas, if Washington is largely absent, how
will others fill the space?

Trump's admirers see virtue in impetuousness. [[Keeping rivals and
allies on their toes]{.mark} can **[deter]{.mark}** the former [and
**extract**]{.mark} **[concessions]{.mark}** from the
latter.]{.underline} [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}, they say,
[[was]{.underline} **[shyer]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of acting up [with
Trump]{.mark} in office, [and]{.mark} Trump's]{.underline}
**[[ambiguity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [about NATO has **[shake]{.mark}n
[Europeans]{.mark}** [out of]{.mark} their **[complacency]{.mark}**
about]{.underline} the continent's [security]{.underline} just as much
as the Kremlin's aggression has.

But unpredictability could just as easily backfire. While no one wants
all-out war, [**[miscalc]{.mark}**ulation]{.underline}
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} as much [[a]{.underline}
**[risk]{.underline}**]{.mark} [along **major-power fault
lines**]{.underline} as elsewhere. If Trump or top officials get too
hawkish, a rival could respond in kind, aiming to reset a red line but
crossing one of Washington's own. Or a U.S. ally---the Philippines, say,
or Taiwan or Israel---could overstep, prompting
[**[retal]{.mark}**iation]{.underline} [[from]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} **[Iran]{.underline}**]{.mark}
that [[risks]{.underline} **[dragging in]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

On the other hand, if Trump disparages Washington's alliances, an
adversary---**[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}**, most likely, but
plausibly [**[Pyongyang]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}]{.mark} even
**[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} decide
to [[test]{.underline}]{.mark} Trump's [[willingness]{.mark} to come to
the aid of U.S. allies]{.underline}, [[prompting]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a]{.underline} **[political [uproar]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in
Washington [that **forces**]{.mark} the [president]{.mark}'s
hand.]{.underline}

Bellicosity might also engender more united resistance. [[Talk
of]{.mark} a China-Russia-North Korea-Iran "[**axis**" is
**overblown**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[given]{.underline}]{.mark} [that
[the four]{.mark} capitals [share]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[few
interests]{.underline}**]{.mark} beyond resisting U.S. power and evading
sanctions. [Still, they increasingly help one another out]{.underline}.
Iranian and North Korean arms; dual-use components from China; and, now,
North Korean troops are helping to sustain Putin's war effort in
Ukraine. The defense pact that Putin inked with North Korean leader Kim
Jong Un in November in principle binds Pyongyang, and potentially
peninsular security, to the war in Europe.

Ties among these adversaries will likely tighten if Trump ratchets up
hostility on all fronts---all the more so if he pushes Europe to toughen
trade restrictions on China or encourages NATO to involve itself more in
Asia.

[For dealmaking, Trump's heterodoxy might be]{.underline} more of [an
advantage]{.underline}---if it's aimed in the right direction. The
hypothetical **[[grand bargain]{.underline}]{.mark}** with Chinese
leader Xi Jinping that is floated by some in Trump's orbit---[which
would lead Washington [to accept]{.mark} [Chinese
primacy]{.mark}]{.underline} in Asia, including over Taiwan (the
manufacturer of almost all the advanced microchips that the global
economy relies upon)---[[seems]{.underline}
**[far-fetched]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**

A deal with Russia that left Ukraine demilitarized and without security
guarantees, as Putin demands, would quickly collapse. [**[No stable
path]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[s]{.mark}**phere-**[o]{.mark}**f-**[i]{.mark}**nfluence]{.underline}-type
[[agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} in Asia or Europe
[[exists]{.underline}]{.mark}, even if Trump could persuade U.S. allies
to think otherwise.

And [although [China]{.mark} will continue to be]{.underline} a
[powerful]{.underline} and influential global player, [it is
[confronting]{.mark}]{.underline} a growing set of [complex]{.underline}
**[challenges]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} will significantly
[complicate its development]{.underline}. [Following a]{.underline}
**[decade]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [**[slowing growth]{.mark}**,
China's economy now contends with]{.underline} **[mounting
[pressures]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[turbulent]{.underline} **[[real estate]{.underline}]{.mark}** market,
[**[surging debt]{.mark}**, constrained local]{.underline} government
[finances]{.underline}, [waning productivity, and]{.underline} a
**[rapidly [aging]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[population]{.underline}]{.mark}, all of which will require Beijing to
grapple with difficult tradeoffs. Abroad, [China [faces
regional]{.mark}]{.underline} **[military
[tensions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} increasing
scrutiny and [[pushback]{.underline}]{.mark} by advanced economies.
Indeed, some of the foundational [conditions that drove
China's]{.underline} remarkable [growth]{.underline} over the past two
decades [are unraveling]{.underline}. But just as these new difficulties
are emerging, demanding nimble policymaking, Chinese leader
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping's [consolidation]{.underline} of power has
[stifled]{.underline} political [debate and sidelined technocrats,
yielding]{.underline} a [policymaking]{.underline} process [that is
brittle, reactive, and prone to]{.underline} **[missteps]{.underline}**.
[Chinese young]{.underline} people now [lament]{.underline} the
narrowing space they have to achieve their goals, a trend that won't
change unless [their country's leadership does]{.underline}. But that
event appears distant.

The United States still has a vital edge over China.

Even with its many shortcomings and vulnerabilities, [the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[continues to [command]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[[strategic
depth]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that China]{.underline} fundamentally
[lacks]{.underline}: a unique combination of **[[economic
vitality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, global **[[military
superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [remarkable]{.underline} [**hu[man
capital]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and a political [system]{.mark} designed
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} promote the [[correct]{.underline}ion]{.mark}
of [[errors]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The]{.underline}
**[resilient]{.underline}** and adaptable U.S. [economy has
the]{.underline} world's **[[deepest]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} [most liquid]{.underline} [**[capital
markets]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[unparalleled]{.underline}**
[influence]{.underline}]{.mark} over the global financial system. The
United States [continues to attract]{.underline} **[top]{.underline}**
global **[talent]{.underline}**, [including]{.underline} many [Chinese
nationals]{.underline} now fleeing their country's autocratic political
environment.

Put plainly, [the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[still has]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[vital [edge]{.mark}]{.underline}** [over China [in terms
of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[economic [dynamism]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[global]{.underline} **[[influence]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[tech]{.underline}**nological
**[[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To highlight this fact is neither
triumphalism nor complacency. It is the root of good strategy, because
[[Washington can]{.underline}]{.mark} easily [[squander]{.mark}
its]{.underline} asymmetric [[advantages if]{.underline}]{.mark}
excessive **[[pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}** or panic
[[depletes]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}, muddies
its focus, or leads it to overindulge nativist and protectionist
impulses and close America's doors to the rest of the world. For despite
its problems, [[China is]{.mark} still [making]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[headway]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} specific [domains
that challenge]{.underline} U.S. national [security]{.underline} and
prosperity, [such as]{.underline} **[[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark}**
computing, **[renewable [energy]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}**lectric
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle [production]{.underline}. A
political-economic system such as [China's can remain a]{.underline}
**[fierce rival]{.underline}** in key areas even as it groans under the
weight of its pathologies.

China most often gains primacy in areas in which the United States is
dramatically underinvested. China's greatest assets in its competition
with the United States are not its underlying fundamentals but its
hyperfocus and willingness to expend enormous resources, and tolerate
enormous waste, in the pursuit of key objectives. That means that
[Washington cannot afford to retreat]{.underline} from sectors vital for
competing in the twenty-first century's economy, as it did in the case
of 5G technology in the previous decade.

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric relied
particularly heavily on the specter of American decline.
[The]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [does face]{.underline} its own
daunting array of [[problems]{.underline}]{.mark} abroad and at home,
[but these]{.underline} [**[pale]{.underline}** [in comparison
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [those [China]{.mark} faces]{.underline}. And
Washington's tendency to stress its rivals' power and underestimate its
own strengths has often backfired, becoming a trap that leads to serious
policy errors. Even Trump's most pessimistic advisers should understand
this history---and recognize that U.S. leaders risk making costly
missteps by adopting a reactive posture toward China instead of
capitalizing on the United States' comparative advantages to push
forward its interests at a moment when Beijing is struggling.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

CONFIDENCE GAME Throughout the last century, the United States has
consistently overestimated the strength of its rivals and underestimated
its own. This habit became particularly evident during the Cold War,
when U.S. officials and analysts were consumed by fears that the Soviet
Union had grown superior in military might, technological advancement,
and global political influence. In the late 1950s, for instance, U.S.
officials came to believe that the Soviets had a much larger and more
sophisticated stockpile of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Intelligence gathered by U-2 spy planes and other sources, however,
later revealed that the so-called missile gap had been mostly imaginary.
As the Cold War drew to a close, it became clear that the Soviet economy
was crumbling under the weight of military expenditures, and much of the
feared Soviet superiority was exaggerated or based on
misinterpretations. The tendency to underappreciate the United States'
strength is driven by a difference in how democracies and autocracies
perceive and present their weaknesses. Democratic systems are more
transparent and foster more debate about their own flaws. This can lead
to a heightened focus on domestic shortcomings, making weaknesses appear
more significant than they are. A democracy's vulnerabilities can seem
even more alarming when compared with the apparent strength of
authoritarian regimes, which, conversely, punish criticism and
disseminate propaganda in order to present a brighter picture than the
reality. The Soviet Union strove to maintain a veneer of invincibility
by censoring its press and mounting military parades. Its efforts to
mask its economic stagnation, political infighting, and failure to
innovate often fooled U.S. policymakers; the United States' tendency
toward self-criticism, meanwhile, obscured its own advantages.
Sometimes, this dynamic redounds to the United States' benefit. The
prospect of a rival's ascendancy can mobilize American resources and
political will: for instance, although the claim that the United States
lagged the Soviet Union in its production of ballistic missiles was
largely erroneous, the warning served as a powerful motivator for the
U.S. government to boost its defense spending and accelerate its
technological research. To some extent, the misperception that the
United States was losing its comparative advantage helped it maintain
that advantage. Similarly, the Soviet Union's early space-race
victories---and the fear that the United States would fall behind in a
crucial, symbolic contest---prompted the U.S. government to create NASA,
renew its investments in science education in American schools, and
increase funding for scientific research. In this case, the worry that
the Soviet Union was outstripping the United States was valuable,
catalyzing beneficial investments that undergirded a subsequent half
century of American technological superiority. Underestimating
geopolitical threats also comes with costs, as it did in the case of
Nazi Germany's rise in the 1930s, al Qaeda's growth in the 1990s, and
Russian President Vladimir Putin's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The chaos
that these underestimates unleashed can make it seem as if it is
generally safer to overestimate the threat posed by a potential
adversary. But in many cases, developing an outsize fear of a rival has
led the United States to misallocate government resources, lose sight of
the need to nurture its own sources of strength, become distracted by
peripheral threats, or even become mired in unnecessary wars. The United
States' immense financial and human investments in the Vietnam War, for
example, were inspired in part by the so-called domino theory, which
held that if the United States allowed Soviet-backed communism to take
hold in Southeast Asia, communism would inexorably come to dominate the
globe. That belief led the United States to fixate on winning a costly,
protracted war that ultimately drained its resources, hurt its
reputation worldwide, and eroded Americans' trust in their own
government. Decades later, a similar mobilization against an exaggerated
threat---Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq---led to a disastrous and
drawn-out conflict, domestic turmoil, and the further decline of the
United States' international credibility. The United States' tendency to
point to a rival's strength to spur domestic action has thus been a
double-edged sword. On the one hand, perceived threats can mobilize
resources, drive innovation, and foster unity in the face of potential
challenges, as seen with the space race and military advancements during
the Cold War. A useful overestimate is one that galvanizes constructive
action without leading to paranoia or unsustainable commitments.
Overestimates become damaging when they dramatically skew government
priorities and distract leaders' finite attention from other pressing
issues. Recognizing the difference requires both a nuanced understanding
of a rival's capabilities and the development of a well-calibrated and
sustainable response to them.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

ALL THAT GLITTERS

Today, [many]{.underline} in the United States [fear]{.underline} that
[China will]{.underline} **[eclipse]{.underline}** [its
power]{.underline}. On the surface, evidence for this prediction is
abundant. [In]{.underline} a variety of **[key]{.underline}**
[capabilities]{.underline}, [from]{.underline} **[hypersonic
missiles]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[shipbuilding]{.underline}**,
[China is increasingly powerful]{.underline}, if not dominant, which
appears to demonstrate that China's state-driven political-economic
model remains more than capable of "concentrating power to do big
things," as Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping put it.

[Yet the foundations of [China's]{.mark} strength are
[strained]{.mark}]{.underline} by mounting challenges. The country's
[growth rate]{.underline} has [steadily]{.underline}
**[declined]{.underline}** from its 2007 peak; the [past five
years]{.underline}, in particular, have [ushered in]{.underline} stark
**[[structural problems]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
economic **[volatility]{.underline}**. The [real estate]{.underline}
market, a core driver of China's growth and urban development, [is
[experiencing]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[[historic
correction]{.underline}]{.mark}** with far-reaching implications. In
August 2024, the International Monetary Fund estimated that roughly
**[50 percent]{.underline}** [of Chinese [property developers]{.mark}
are [on]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[brink]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[insolvency]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Their woes are
[driven]{.underline} in part [by]{.underline} a [persistent decline in
housing prices]{.underline}, which as of October 2024, were [falling at
their]{.underline} **[fastest pace]{.underline}** since 2015. Because
[more than 70 percent of]{.underline} Chinese [household wealth is tied
up in]{.underline} the [property]{.underline} market, steep drops in the
value of housing hurt not only developers but nearly all Chinese
citizens.

The real estate [crisis is affecting]{.underline} the finances of
China's [local governments]{.underline}, too. These municipalities were
long reliant on land sales to fund investment in public services and
infrastructure. As property values and land sales falter, these
[[municipalities]{.mark} are becoming]{.underline}
[**[strapped]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[revenue]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [preventing them from
servicing]{.underline} their **[debt]{.underline}** [and
providing]{.underline} essential [services]{.underline}. In an April
2024 analysis, Bloomberg estimated that China's [local
governments]{.underline} had, that month, [generated]{.underline} their
**[lowest revenue]{.underline}** from land sales [in]{.underline} eight
[years]{.underline}. To compensate, [they]{.underline} have [resorted
to]{.underline} collecting **[arbitrary fines]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} local [companies]{.underline}, clawing back bonuses
paid to local officials, [and]{.underline} even seeking
[loans]{.underline} from private firms to cover payroll.

Even [Chinese [citizens' faith]{.mark}]{.underline} in Beijing's
economic stewardship [[is]{.underline}
**[eroding]{.underline}**]{.mark}. According to The Wall Street Journal,
as much as **[\$254 billion]{.underline}** may have quietly [flowed out
of the country]{.underline} between June 2023 and June 2024---[a clear
signal of domestic]{.underline} **[disillusionment]{.underline}**.
[Young people are turning to]{.underline} a posture they call "lying
flat," a [quiet rebellion]{.underline} against societal expectations
that demand relentless effort in exchange for increasingly elusive
rewards. [With youth unemployment surging]{.underline} to record levels,
[young Chinese]{.underline} people [face a bleak reality]{.underline}:
advanced degrees and grueling work no longer guarantee stable employment
or upward mobility.

The external environment that formerly supported China's meteoric rise
is also characterized by wariness. [Foreign
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline} that once rushed to tap the potential of
China's vast market [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} now
[approaching]{.underline} it [with caution]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} some are even [[seeking]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[exits]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[F]{.underline}]{.mark}**oreign
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**irect **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nvestment
into China **[[plunged]{.mark} 80 percent]{.underline}** between 2021
and 2023, [reaching [its]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[lowest]{.underline}**
[level]{.underline}]{.mark} in 30 years. Beijing's 2021 [[crackdown
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark} sector [**[wiped
out]{.underline}** [billions]{.underline}]{.mark} of dollars in value,
[and]{.underline} the country's **[[unpredictable]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[regulatory]{.underline} and political
[[environment]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[forced]{.underline}]{.mark}
multinational [[corporations to rethink]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[China]{.underline} strategies. In September, a survey by the American
Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai revealed a grim outlook: [fewer than
half of foreign firms expressed optimism]{.underline} about China's
five-year business prospects---the lowest levels of confidence in the
survey's 25-year history.

In the years following its accession into the World Trade Organization,
China was warmly welcomed into global markets, with countries eager to
benefit from its manufacturing prowess and seemingly limitless appetite
for foreign investment. China remains deeply reliant on access to the
world's markets, but many foreign [governments are growing]{.underline}
ever more [concerned about]{.underline} the strategic implications of
[China's]{.underline} economic [reach]{.underline} and military might.
Many [developing countries that]{.underline} initially
[embraced]{.underline} its **[B]{.underline}**elt and
**[R]{.underline}**oad **[I]{.underline}**nitiative as a pathway to
infrastructure development, for example, [are scrutinizing the project's
impact]{.underline}, worried about its negative effects on the
environment and on local labor practices. [Advanced
economies]{.underline} such as Australia and Canada have
[erected]{.underline} new [investment screening]{.underline} mechanisms
to better protect their economies from national security risks stemming
from Chinese investment. In March 2019, in a "strategic outlook" report,
the [Europe]{.underline}an Commission formally [labeled China a
"systemic rival,"]{.underline} marking a shift from the traditional view
that the country offered a market opportunity with few downsides. The EU
subsequently [moved to impose]{.underline} [stricter
reg]{.underline}ulation[s]{.underline} on Chinese investments in
Europe's critical infrastructure, technology, and digital sectors [and
tariffs]{.underline} of up to 45 percent on Chinese-made electric
vehicles.

Washington's tendency to focus on its rivals' strength has often
backfired.

[Xi]{.underline}, meanwhile, has [ushered]{.underline} in a governance
style characterized by [reactive]{.underline}, opaque
[decision-making]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} often
[exacerbates]{.underline} China's domestic and international
[tensions]{.underline}. By consolidating his authority within a small
circle of loyalists, [Xi]{.underline} has [weakened]{.underline} the
internal [checks and balances that]{.underline} might otherwise [temper
policy]{.underline} decisions. Beijing's [handling of]{.underline} the
initial [COVID]{.underline}-19 outbreak is a striking example: the
suppression of critical information, along with the silencing of
whistleblowers, caused delays in the global response to the virus,
contributing to its rapid spread beyond China's borders. What might have
been a well-coordinated local response metastasized into a global health
crisis, [exposing China to international condemnation]{.underline} and
illustrating the pitfalls of a system that punishes dissent and cuts off
sources of feedback.

Xi's attempts to reduce economic inequality and curb the excesses of
China's booming private sector have followed a similarly opaque and
erratic course. Policy missteps by the central government---such as its
[reluctance to bail out]{.underline} local [governments and rein
in]{.underline} [shadow banking]{.underline} and capital markets---have
[intensified]{.underline} the **[[fiscal pressure]{.underline}]{.mark}**
on the Chinese economy, [[triggering]{.underline} **[liquidity
crises]{.underline}**]{.mark} for giant real estate developers. Sudden
and [[aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark} regulatory
[[crackdowns]{.underline}]{.mark} in sectors such as technology and
private education have [sent]{.underline} **[shock waves]{.underline}**
through China's business community [and]{.underline}
[[unsettled]{.underline}]{.mark} international
[[investors]{.underline}]{.mark}. With his push to institutionalize what
he calls a "holistic national security concept"---in which Beijing's
economic and political decision-making is guided by concerns about
regime security---[Xi]{.underline} has [[begun to]{.mark}
erode]{.underline} [the]{.mark} very [sources of
[dynamism]{.mark}]{.underline} that propelled China's rapid ascent.
Since Deng began to open China's economy in the late 1970s, Chinese
leaders have striven to offer the country pragmatic, pro-market policies
and to afford local politicians the flexibility to address their areas'
specific challenges. But [hamstrung]{.underline}, now, [by]{.underline}
rigid and [top-down directives]{.underline} that prioritize ideological
conformity over practical solutions, local [politicians are ill equipped
to tackle]{.underline} the mounting pressures of [fiscal **insolvency**
and]{.underline} **[unemployment]{.underline}**.

[Entrepreneurs]{.underline}, once key engines of China's economic
miracle, now [operate in a climate of]{.underline}
**[fear]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[uncertainty]{.underline}**,
unsure of what Beijing's next policy shift might be. The [lack of
transparency]{.underline} or legal recourse in government
decision-making [reveals]{.underline} the deeper [flaws]{.underline} of
centralized governance: [policies are developed]{.underline} and carried
out [with little]{.underline} consultation or [explanation]{.underline},
leaving citizens and businesses to navigate the fallout. Xi's
consolidation of power may offer short-term control and a capacity to
achieve certain strategic and technological outcomes through brute
force. But it [risks rendering China's policymaking]{.underline}
apparatus increasingly tone-deaf, [out of touch]{.underline} with both
domestic realities and global expectations.

GOOD BONES

The extreme [attitudes]{.underline} of either fatalism or triumphalism
can easily [obscure a]{.underline} more [nuanced perspective that
recognizes China's expanding]{.underline} global [influence while
appreciating the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' unique and
**[[enduring]{.underline}]{.mark}** strategic

[and]{.underline} **[open]{.underline}**]{.mark}

remains]{.mark}]{.underline} not only **[[larger]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[than China's but also]{.underline} larger [than the next three biggest
economies combined]{.underline}, and [it is [on track
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[grow faster]{.underline}**]{.mark} [than any
other G-7 economy]{.underline} in 2024 and 2025, according to
International Monetary Fund estimates. During President Joe Biden's

**[[doubled]{.underline}]{.mark}** [its]{.underline} [**[GDP
lead]{.underline}**]{.mark} [over China]{.underline}, and its share of
global GDP remains near the level it was in the 1990s. Analysts such as
the Rhodium Group's Logan Wright have predicted that [China's share of
global GDP peaked]{.underline} in 2021 [and will]{.underline} likely
[remain below]{.underline} that of [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates for the foreseeable
future. Even observers who think the outlook for China's economy is less
dire agree that [its growth is]{.underline} **[slowing]{.underline}**
[and will be]{.underline} **[constrained]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
structural **[challenges]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} a [clumsy
policy]{.underline}making process.

[[America]{.mark}n companies]{.underline}
**[[dominate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [global
[markets]{.mark}]{.underline}: as of March 2024, [nine of the world's
ten largest firms]{.underline} by market capitalization [were
American]{.underline}; [China's largest firm]{.underline}, Tencent,
[ranked twenty-sixth]{.underline}. And [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [continues to
[attract]{.mark} the [most]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[foreign
capital]{.underline}**]{.mark} of any economy, [in]{.underline} stark
[contrast to China's]{.underline} increasing capital
**[outflows]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates also [has more high-skilled]{.underline}
immigrants than any other country; [China]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[struggles to attract]{.underline} any significant amount of
foreign-born [talent]{.underline}.

As the artificial intelligence revolution accelerates, the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} particularly [well positioned to become
the]{.underline} global [[epicenter of]{.underline}
**[AI]{.underline}**]{.mark} innovation and diffusion. According to
Stanford University's Global AI Power Rankings, the United States leads
the world in artificial intelligence, [possessing]{.underline} a
substantial [[lead]{.mark} over China in]{.underline} areas such as AI
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, private-sector
**[funding]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} the
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline}
**[cutting-edge]{.underline}** [AI tech]{.underline}nologies. Over the
past decade, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' tech
sector has consistently outpaced China's in AI, [creating more than
three times as many AI]{.underline}-focused [companies]{.underline}. In
2023, [U.S. companies developed 61 significant]{.underline} AI
[models]{.underline} [compared with China's 15,]{.underline} reflecting
the strength of the United States' AI ecosystem. That same year, [U.S.
[investors poured]{.mark}]{.underline} nearly [**[nine
times]{.underline}** [more capital]{.underline}]{.mark} into AI than
China did, [funding]{.underline} the launch of [897]{.underline} AI
[startups]{.underline}, far [surpassing China's 122]{.underline}. This
[success stems]{.underline} in no small part [from a]{.underline}
decentralized, **[market-driven]{.underline}** [approach]{.underline}
[that China]{.underline}, as it is currently governed, [cannot
emulate]{.underline}. The United States' relatively flexible regulatory
framework, the free collaboration it permits between private companies
and academia, and its ability to attract talent give it an edge.

As the world's largest oil importer, China relies on imports for over 70
percent of its oil needs, leaving it vulnerable to global disruptions.
Geopolitical tensions, supply-chain bottlenecks, or regional conflicts
could severely jeopardize China's energy security. The United States, by
contrast, has nearly achieved energy independence and has emerged as a
leading global producer of oil and natural gas. Its energy dominance is
driven in part by strong innovation in areas such as advanced fracking
and horizontal drilling, and the United States uses its preeminence to
shape global energy markets and strengthen its geopolitical leverage.
After Russia's invasion of Ukraine disrupted Europe's energy supply, for
example, the United States quickly increased its exports of liquefied
natural gas, reducing Europe's dependence on Russian energy.

[The [dollar's status]{.mark}]{.underline} as the world's primary
reserve and settlement currency [[gives]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[unparalleled]{.underline} **[[financial
leverage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, although it also has downsides. In
2023, nearly **[60 percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} global
**[fo]{.underline}**reign **[ex]{.underline}**change
**[[reserves]{.underline}]{.mark}** [were]{.underline} held
[[in]{.underline} **[dollars]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [far
[outpacing]{.mark} the]{.underline} euro (around 20 percent) and the
[[yuan]{.underline}]{.mark} (**[less than]{.underline}** [three
percent]{.underline}). [That gives the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [advantages such as
lower borrowing costs]{.underline}, greater [flexibility in
managing]{.underline} its [debt, and]{.underline} the [ability
to]{.underline} impose [sanction]{.underline}s. At the same time, the
dollar's global status imposes costs on the U.S. economy, such as a
persistent trade deficit and pressure on manufacturing when it makes
American exports less competitive. But these are problems Beijing wishes
it had: it is actively promoting alternatives to the dollar and has
unveiled a digital currency to try to blunt the United States' ability
to weaponize its financial system.

[2024 was]{.underline} **[disastrous]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
Chinese President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping. For all of his
rhetoric about "the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," [his
regime [faced]{.mark}]{.underline} **[staggering
[setbacks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Military purges]{.underline} intended
to root out corruption instead [[revealed]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[systemic [turmoil]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[that]{.mark} continues to
[undermine]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[readiness]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[Economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[cratered]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as [unemployment,
bankruptcies]{.mark}, and capital [outflows]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[soared]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile, [key
[partners]{.mark}]{.underline} in Moscow and Damascus [[stumbled]{.mark}
or fell]{.underline}, **[undermining]{.underline}** [Beijing's
geostrategic]{.underline} **[ambitions]{.underline}**. Together, [these
and other]{.underline} **[crises]{.underline}** [have revealed a China
that looks increasingly]{.underline} **[fragile]{.underline}**, not
formidable.

If 2024 shattered illusions of China's unyielding ascent,
[**[2025]{.underline}** [promises to]{.underline} **[lay
bare]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that Xi can no longer
conceal]{.underline}.

Facing mounting problems at home and soon an emboldened U.S. President
Donald Trump in Washington, Xi is nevertheless not banking on dramatic
shifts or bold reforms. Instead, he is pursuing a policy of
perseverance: muddling through economic stagnation, avoiding outright
confrontation with Washington, doubling down on ideological discipline,
and fomenting chaos abroad to distract adversaries and buy time to
stabilize his precarious position.

Yet [Xi's approach carries significant risk]{.underline}. While his
[willingness to endure]{.underline} hardship may fortify his grip on
power today, it [threatens to]{.underline} **[unravel]{.underline}**
[his aspirations for China's]{.underline} national [revival]{.underline}
tomorrow.

Contrary to Xi's carefully constructed image of competence, [China's
domestic dilemmas remain profound. A **[shrinking]{.mark}
[population]{.mark}**,]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[[weakening
currency]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**dwindling**]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign
**[[investment]{.underline}]{.mark}** have [[exposed cracks]{.mark} in
Xi's economic stewardship]{.underline}. [They]{.underline} also
[undermine the]{.underline} Communist [Party's bargain]{.underline} with
the Chinese people: [prosperity in exchange for compliance.]{.underline}
[China's [crisis]{.mark} of confidence risks
**[spiraling]{.mark}**]{.underline} [into a **vicious
cycle**]{.underline} [as weak growth deters investment, shrinks
spending, [deepens **deflation**]{.mark}, and raises
**[unemployment]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[all of which **[drag
growth]{.mark}** even lower.]{.underline} Xi's reliance on meager
supply-side [stimulus]{.underline} has [delivered fleeting sugar
highs]{.underline}, with modest spending upticks and short-lived credit
expansions. [But]{.underline} **[[ballooning]{.mark}
[debt]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [bad real estate bets, and a stock market
that has been flat]{.underline} for a decade
[[leave]{.underline}]{.mark} Xi with [[few leve]{.mark}rs to reignite
growth]{.underline}.

Worse still, [Xi's campaign to root out]{.underline} perceived
[weaknesses]{.underline} within the party, military, and private sector
has [compounded his conundrum]{.underline}. **[Purges]{.underline}** [of
senior officials]{.underline} such as People's Liberation Army Navy Adm.
Miao Hua---a key enforcer of Xi's ideological conformity accused of
"serious violations of discipline"---as well as former Defense Minister
Li Shangfu [underscore]{.underline} **[rot]{.underline}** [within the
ranks]{.underline}. The reported [detention of]{.underline} more than 80
[business executives]{.underline} in 2024 alone has
[stifled]{.underline} [innovation]{.underline} and fueled fears of
arbitrary state intervention. While [these actions]{.underline} may
consolidate loyalty and enforce control, they also [deepen distrust and
erode]{.underline} the [competence]{.underline} that Xi needs to
navigate mounting pressures.

These widening woes have only steeled [Xi]{.underline}'s resolve. He
routinely [invokes Western]{.underline} "encirclement" and
"[containment]{.underline}," blaming the United States for thwarting
China's rise. But he uses this narrative [to justify ever-expanding
**repression**]{.underline} at home, including
[constructing]{.underline} more than 200 party-run, extrajudicial
[detention facilities to enforce discipline and root out
dissent]{.underline}. In Xi's view, China's domestic struggles
ultimately stem from weak ideological discipline and insufficient
loyalty to his vision. Put differently, in Xi's mind, China isn't
broken; it's disobedient. His solution? A stronger dose of the same
medicine: [tighter party control]{.underline}, [intensified
repression]{.underline}, [and an unrelenting drive to cement his
legacy]{.underline} as the architect of China's historical destiny.

Amid internal challenges, [[Xi is turning to **chaos**]{.mark} abroad
[to **reshape** the **international order**]{.mark} in China's
favor]{.underline}. By [[offering]{.underline}]{.mark} diplomatic cover
and economic [[support for Russia's war]{.mark} in Ukraine]{.underline}
and tacit [[backing]{.mark} for Middle Eastern [disruptors]{.mark} [such
as Iran]{.mark}, Xi is [**fueling crises**]{.mark} that distract,
divide, and drain Western resources.]{.underline} [For Xi, [chaos
is]{.mark}]{.underline} not merely a tactic; it's a form of
[[strategic]{.mark} currency,]{.underline}
[**[undermining]{.underline}** [Western
**cohesion**]{.underline}]{.mark} [while **bolstering**]{.underline} his
narrative of [Chinese]{.underline} resilience and
[strength]{.underline}. [His calculation is stark: [If
**China's**]{.mark} **ascent** is **[faltering]{.mark}**, the
**[international architecture]{.mark}** sustaining its rivals [must
**falter**,]{.mark} too. Seen in this light, [**disorder abroad** is
Xi's **lifeline**]{.mark}---a **calculated gambit** to obscure his
inability to deliver progress at home or globally]{.underline}.

[Yet 2025 will test Xi like never before]{.underline}. Intensifying
scrutiny from Washington---including new semiconductor investigations,
advanced technology export controls, and expanded tariffs---is set to
collide with rising domestic unrest, including labor strikes and online
dissent. At the same time, an emerging anti-authoritarian
alignment---marked by enhanced trans-Atlantic coordination on China and
the new U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral framework---will intensify the
strain. These [converging forces will challenge Xi]{.underline} in ways
he can neither control nor predict, [exposing]{.underline} the
[fragility]{.underline} of his centralized power and [testing the
limits]{.underline} of his carefully constructed narrative of
inevitability.

Xi's biggest X factor will be Trump, whose return promises
unpredictability. In his first term, Trump waited 15 months to impose
tariffs on Chinese goods. This time, tariffs are expected to hit
immediately and intensely, targeting the very lifeblood of China's
faltering economy: exports. These tariffs won't just come faster;
they'll cut deeper, with proposed rates reaching as high as 60 percent
on critical sectors such as technology, consumer goods, and industrial
equipment. Unlike sanctions, which Xi has worked to mitigate and take
years to fully materialize, tariffs take effect overnight, leaving
Beijing with little time to react and forcing Chinese manufacturers to
absorb crushing losses.

Trump's tariff threats translate into tremendous peril for Xi. China's
reliance on the United States---its largest trading partner---sustains
millions of manufacturing jobs, but a rapid tariff escalation could
devastate small and medium enterprises, triggering factory closures and
layoffs. Vulnerable sectors such as electronics and textiles could face
severe disruption, and even the electric vehicle industry---one of
China's few bright spots---is grappling with domestic oversaturation and
budding Western trade barriers. Meanwhile, bipartisan support in
Washington for outbound investment screening threatens to choke off
critical U.S. capital flows, stalling Beijing's technological ambitions
and broader economic goals.

All told, these measures could deliver a knockout blow to China's
economy, which is almost certainly growing below Beijing's official
target of 5 percent. Tellingly, the party has threatened to fire
economists if they warn of economic freefall or express "inappropriate"
views---a hallmark authoritarian move to suppress inconvenient truths.
Xi has made boosting domestic consumption his top priority for 2025, but
this rests on shaky ground, too. If Xi trusts anything even less than
markets, it's the Chinese masses, who have shown no appetite to spend
their way out of his economic quagmire. Investors share this skepticism:
China's 10-year bond yield has plunged to record lows, signaling doubts
about the country's trajectory.

Meanwhile, Xi's reliance on global chaos to sustain his position reveals
a glaring paradox: The instability he is fueling in order to distract
the West could backfire if and when those crises stabilize. In 2025, the
winding down of major conflicts---whether through Trump's promised
dealmaking over Ukraine or Israeli action against Iran's last remaining
proxies---could put the global spotlight back on China. For Xi, this is
a nightmare scenario. The West's fragmented focus has helped mask his
vulnerabilities, but [resolving]{.underline} these [crises could empower
the West to confront him head-on.]{.underline}

[[Xi's choice is]{.mark} stark: hunker down by
[embracing]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}**
strategy [[or risk]{.mark} further [instability by
**overreaching**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both paths will test his capacity
for long-term endurance. Confronted by Trump's aggressive posturing, Xi
is unlikely to pursue outright economic warfare, at least initially,
because he recognizes that an escalation would hurt China more than its
adversaries. Instead, Xi may adopt calibrated, symbolic responses---like
the recently announced rare-earth restrictions---to project strength
while preserving room for negotiations. Xi may also leverage retaliatory
tariffs or regulatory crackdowns on U.S. firms operating in China to
signal defiance without provoking a full-scale confrontation.

Domestically, Xi's task is how to redefine success. If political
stability and ideological discipline now take primacy over economic
growth, Xi will have to reframe hardship as proof positive of China's
resilience and moral superiority over the West. If national rejuvenation
now takes decades longer than planned, Xi will likely cast the delays as
necessary steps in achieving the "Chinese Dream." Whether the Chinese
people will embrace this new narrative---or tire of a perpetually
deferred future---remains an open question.

On the global stage, [Xi's reliance on instability poses]{.underline}
its own [perils]{.underline}. Rather than treading water, [[Xi
may]{.underline} **[escalate tensions]{.underline}**]{.mark}
elsewhere---perhaps [[in]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, [[testing U.S. resolve through
**confrontation** with]{.mark} the
**[Philippines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet as much as [a chaos-driven
strategy]{.underline} intends to distract adversaries and sidestep
direct confrontation, it [[invites]{.underline}
**[miscalc]{.underline}**]{.mark}ulation. More [specifically, Xi [risks
exposing Beijing to]{.mark} the **[vulnerabilities]{.mark}** that have
undermined other authoritarian regimes]{.underline}---from Russian
President Vladimir Putin's disastrous gamble of invading Ukraine to
Hamas's ill-fated Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that invited
overwhelming retaliation.

Of course, the irony of Xi's leadership is that a seemingly
transformational figure obsessed with progress cannot embrace change.
Under his rule, [China has become]{.underline} a power both [disruptive
and constrained]{.underline}, where every effort to tighten control
risks tarnishing Beijing's global standing and undermining the
credibility of its great-power ascent. But muddling through isn't
leading, and for someone whose [**[legitimacy]{.mark}** [hinges on
d]{.mark}elivering **[national prestige]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[mere
**survival**]{.mark} risks [falling]{.mark} dangerously [short of
his]{.mark} own **[lofty ambitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ultimately,
whether 2025 becomes a turning point or simply another terrible,
horrible, no good year will depend on Xi's ability to overcome the
greatest challenge of all: himself.

### Pursuit Inevitable

#### Trump pursues heg inevitably.

Donald [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} isn't even president yet, and he's
already giving US foreign policy a 19th century feel. The
president-elect has [spent]{.underline} the [weeks]{.underline} before
his inauguration [[promoting]{.mark} an]{.underline}
**[epic]{.underline}** [agenda of]{.underline} **[[territorial
expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Western Hemisphere ---
[and]{.underline} [threatening]{.underline} to use
[coercion]{.underline}, even force, to make it a reality.

It's a mistake to dismiss this as Trumpian bluster or diplomatic
trolling: [His [taunts]{.mark} are a preview of]{.underline} the new
**[[continentalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is [likely to color his
foreign policy.]{.underline} The smart version of [that]{.underline}
doctrine [could [help the US]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[flourish]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in a fragmenting
environment.]{.underline} The destructive variant could hasten the
demise of the world order Washington has long labored to protect.

Every president says [[foreign policy begins at
home]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Trump]{.underline} may [really mean
it]{.underline}: [His]{.underline} pre-inauguration
[pronouncements]{.underline} have [targeted America's]{.underline}
hemispheric [backyard]{.underline}. [Trump]{.underline} has
[[threatened]{.underline} **[Mexico]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Canada]{.underline}** [with]{.underline}
**[tariffs]{.underline}**]{.mark} [if they don't stem]{.underline}
cross-border flows of [drugs and migrants]{.underline}. He has also
said, repeatedly, that Canada should become the 51st state and that
Washington should annex Greenland and reclaim control of the Panama
Canal. Altogether, that's a set of acquisitions stretching from the
tropics to the Arctic Circle.

Each of these ideas has its logic. Drugs and migration are immediate,
tangible threats to US security and sovereignty. **[[Chinese]{.mark}
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}** [has been [growing around]{.mark}
the]{.underline} militarily and economically vital [**[Panama
Canal]{.underline}**. [Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} [occupies
a]{.underline} **[[strategic location]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[in]{.mark} a]{.underline} warming, ever-more **[[contested
Artic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is a long, unhappy history of
American designs on Canada. Yet what ties [[Trump's]{.mark}
pronouncements]{.underline} together is that they [[mark]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[revival]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.mark} an
older]{.underline} [**[strategic tradition]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Before the US was a global power, it was a regional power. From
independence to the early 20th century, the [crucial achievements of
Washington's policy involved expanding across the North American
continent]{.underline}, elbowing European powers out of Latin America,
and **[[consolidating]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [hemisphere as
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[bastion]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [American]{.underline}
**[[strength]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [That]{.underline} rough,
sometimes-violent program of national aggrandizement [created
the]{.underline} regional [foundation for America's]{.underline}
eventual [global influence]{.underline}: No Monroe Doctrine, no liberal
international order. And if continentalism seems like an anachronism, it
has become relevant again today.

[The need to]{.underline} [**[reconsolidate]{.underline}** [the
West]{.underline}ern]{.mark} Hemisphere [becomes more pressing as the
world]{.underline} [becomes]{.underline} more
[div[i]{.mark}ded]{.underline}. As the US and China undergo a
slow-motion economic and trade decoupling, [the]{.underline} Western
[[Hemisphere]{.mark} looms]{.underline} larger [as a [source
of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[lithium]{.underline}**,
**[r]{.underline}**are-**[e]{.underline}**arth
**[m]{.underline}**ineral**[s]{.underline}** [and other]{.underline}
**[[vital]{.mark} re[sources]{.mark}]{.underline}** ---
[and]{.underline} as [a]{.underline} potential [home to]{.underline}
more geographically **[[secure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, geopolitically
[resilient]{.underline} [**[supply chains]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[As]{.underline} [**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [try to build]{.underline}
**[empires]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in their]{.underline} own
[regions]{.underline}, [the [need to ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[cohesion]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [America's
[hemisphere]{.mark} grows]{.underline}. [In every great-power
struggle]{.underline} of the last century, [Washington aggressively
defended its]{.underline} regional [sanctuary]{.underline}: Why should
it be any different today?

Indeed, [threats to that sanctuary are growing.]{.underline}
Transnational challenges are becoming more severe, in the case of
migration, or more lethal, in the case of fentanyl.
[**[Geopolitical]{.underline}** [challenges are]{.underline}]{.mark}
also **[[resurgent]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Russia has strong]{.underline} intelligence and security [[ties
with]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the region's most
[repressive]{.underline} [states, such as]{.underline}
**[Cuba]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Venezuela]{.underline}**.
[China's]{.underline} trade and technological [ties with]{.underline}
[**[Latin America]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[booming]{.underline}**]{.mark}; [[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark} has
[[built]{.mark}, or sought to control, critical]{.underline}
**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from]{.underline}
**[Argentina]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[Greenland]{.underline}**. [It would be foolish]{.underline} for Trump
[to ignore the Western Hemisphere]{.underline}, [since America's
adversaries aren't]{.underline}.

The problem, as so often with Trump, is more the "how" than the "what."
[A]{.underline} bold, positive [program for hemispheric
integration]{.underline} --- [centering on]{.underline} [closer
**[trade]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[[investment
ti]{.mark}es]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [[stronger]{.underline}
**[diplomatic]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[security]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [[would be a]{.underline}
**[no-brainer]{.underline}**]{.mark}. But the president-elect, of
course, is leading with outlandish demands and offensive threats.

You can [expect a **[capable]{.mark}** foreign-policy [team]{.mark} that
will bring back]{.underline} an "America First" foreign-policy agenda
[with a [**focus** on **peace**]{.mark}]{.underline} through strength,
fair and reciprocal trade, alliance burden-sharing, ending the war in
Ukraine, getting tougher on China and Iran, securing the southern
border, and unleashing U.S. domestic energy potential.

[Personnel is policy]{.underline}, and there are many accomplished
candidates rumored to be in the running for top foreign-policy posts in
a second Trump administration, [including]{.underline} former Secretary
of State [Mike **Pompeo**]{.underline}, former National Security Advisor
[Robert **O'Brien**,]{.underline} Sen. [Marco **Rubio**]{.underline},
Sen. [Tom **Cotton**]{.underline}, former ambassador to Japan and
current Sen. [Bill **Hagerty**]{.underline}, former director of national
intelligence [and]{.underline} former Rep. [John
**Ratcliffe**]{.underline}, and others.

[These are **[seasoned pro]{.mark}**fessional**[s]{.mark}**
who]{.underline} have [**worked** with Trump]{.underline} over the years
[and [are]{.mark}]{.underline} more **[[trusted]{.underline}]{.mark}**
than the so-called [**adults** in the **room**]{.underline} from the
first term. As another former national security advisor, H.R. McMaster,
explains in a new book, Trump was burned by previous cabinet officials,
such as former Defense Secretary James Mattis and former Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson, who thought they knew better than the president and
wrongly worked to obstruct his agenda. Trump rightly wants to avoid that
problem this time around.

After all, presidents consider loyalty when hiring staff. National
Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken,
for example, are President Joe Biden loyalists who worked with him for
years before being tapped for top posts.

With a like-minded team in place, the world can expect more policy
consistency from Trump 2.0 than in the first term.

[Contrary to charges of "**isolationism**,"]{.underline} the first
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [pursued a **globally
[engaged]{.mark}** foreign policy, including]{.underline} the
[projection of **military [force]{.mark}** [and **diplomatic**]{.mark}
**energy** [into]{.mark} the **[Mid]{.mark}**dle **[East]{.mark}** and
Trump's personal **diplomacy** with the leaders of **all**]{.underline}
major [**allies** and **adversaries** in both [**Europe** and
**Asia**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[He [developed]{.mark} **close [relations]{.mark}**hips
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} some allies, such as
then-**[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}**ese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The
[**Abraham Accords** were a transformative step forward]{.underline} for
**[[Arab-Israeli]{.underline}]{.mark}** peace. The [summits with
**[Kim]{.mark}**]{.underline} Jong Un led to a cessation of North Korean
long-range missile tests for the remainder of Trump's presidency. To be
sure, not all of the diplomatic outreach, such as the trade negotiations
with Chinese President Xi Jinping, led to lasting breakthroughs, but
this extensive personal international engagement belies the notion that
Trump's inclinations are somehow isolationist.

His [[**withdrawal** fro]{.mark}m]{.underline} prominent treaties, such
as the [**[Iran]{.mark}** nuclear **[deal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, known
as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(**[[INF]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [Treaty, [were]{.mark} **not ev**idence
of isolationism]{.underline} as some wrongly claim, [but rather
**[pragmatic]{.mark}** judgments]{.underline} that these agreements were
not in America's interest. All the 2016 GOP presidential candidates
promised to pull out of the JCPOA due to its flaws, and it would have
been foolish to remain in the INF Treaty when Russia had
been cheating on the agreement for years.

[In defense policy,]{.underline} you can [expect a **philosophy** of
"**peace** through **strength**," making America **so strong** that
**no** adversary **dare challenge** it]{.underline}, with a willingness
to punch back hard when threatened. In his first term, Trump presided
over the largest defense budget in U.S. history at the time;
successfully prosecuted the war against the Islamic State; bombed Syria
after Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against his
own people; and killed the coordinator of Iran's terror and proxy
networks, Gen. Qassem Suleimani.

[A major [increase in]{.mark} **defense [spending]{.mark}** will be
necessary for the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its allies to **[counter]{.mark}** the **[new]{.mark} axis** of
**[autocracies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (China, Russia, Iran, and North
Korea) at the same time, but the Biden administration defense budgets
have not kept up with inflation. [Under Trump, expect an **increase** in
**defense spending**]{.underline} (perhaps proposing the first \$1
trillion U.S. defense budget) [and a **concerted [effort]{.mark}** [to
**revive**]{.mark} the **[d]{.mark}**efense **[i]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[b]{.mark}**ase, including a [focus on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [Trump
[**priority** of]{.mark} a **[homeland m]{.mark}**issile
**[d]{.mark}**efense system, an "**[iron dome]{.mark}**," for the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. As the bipartisan
Strategic Posture Commission recently recommended,
[Washington]{.underline} should [[build]{.mark} a **[m]{.mark}**issile
**[d]{.mark}**efense [system to **defend**]{.mark} itself [from
**No**]{.mark}]{.underline}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea,
[[**China**, and **Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Why Regional Hegemony Is (Nearly) Impossible to Achieve

Regional hegemony may be desirable in theory, but history suggests that
it is an elusive goal. As Jonathan Kirshner [points
out](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691166773/an-unwritten-future),
[several different [great powers]{.mark} have [launched bids]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} regional [dominance]{.mark} in the modern era and [all but
one]{.mark} of these [attempts ended in disaster]{.mark}.]{.underline}
France failed under Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte, Germany was beaten
decisively in both world wars, and Japan's attempt to establish a
hegemonic order in Asia ended in total defeat as well. [Only [the United
States]{.mark} managed to pull off [becoming the sole great
power]{.mark} in its region. In the modern world, in short, the success
rate is less than 20 percent.]{.underline} Furthermore, the failures
were not just minor setbacks: They were unmitigated disasters for the
countries that made the attempt. Perhaps a million Frenchmen lost their
lives in the Napoleonic Wars, and Bonaparte died in exile on a remote
island in the South Atlantic. Germany suffered mightily in both world
wars and ended up divided into separate states for more than 40 years.
Japan was firebombed in World War II, had two cities destroyed by atomic
bombs, and its political order was remade by a foreign occupier.
[[Being]{.mark} a regional [hegemon]{.mark} [might be desirable, but
trying to become one]{.mark} almost always [makes a state less,]{.mark}
rather than more, [secure]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Bids for hegemony
fail]{.underline}]{.mark} for two main reasons. First, as defensive
realists have long
[emphasized](https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Alliances-Cornell-Studies-Security/dp/0801494184),
[there is a powerful tendency for [major powers]{.mark} to [balance
against threats]{.mark}. When a powerful state is nearby, when its
[military forces]{.mark} seem [tailored to project power]{.mark} against
others, and when it seems to have revisionist ambitions, nearby
[powers]{.mark} typically band together to [deter or defeat
them]{.mark}.]{.underline} If a would-be hegemon reveals its aims by
starting a war, balancing behavior becomes even more pronounced and
effective. The second barrier to regional hegemony is
[[nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Napoleon discovered when he
invaded Spain, as the Soviet Union [and United States]{.mark} both
learned in Afghanistan, and as Moscow is now being reminded in Ukraine,
local populations will make enormous sacrifices to repel invaders. Even
nations that have been temporarily vanquished often remain restive and
eager to throw off an aspiring hegemon's yoke. The dissolution of the
European colonial empires during the 20th century further illustrates
how the spread of nationalist doctrines [[has strengthened resistance to
foreign dominance]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### The US is here to stay\-\--even if there's [some]{.underline} decline, structural advantages mean it will return to its unipolar status.

\--at: multipolarity

\--at: stagnation

Richard E. **Caroll 21**, retired economist who has been published in
Real Clear Defense, International Policy Digest, and Foreign Policy
News, 5/26/21, "**[Why the United States Is the Once and Future Unipolar
Superpower]{.underline}**",
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-united-states-once-and-future-unipolar-superpower-186156>,
vw

The famous Iron Chancellor of Germany, Otto Von Bismarck, once said of
the United States, "God protects fools, drunkards and the United States
of America." While said perhaps in jest or frustration, his remarks have
proved prophetic throughout the years. [The United States from the fall
of the Berlin Wall in 1989 to the beginning of the Iraq War, enjoyed a
**moment of unipolarity** in international affairs]{.underline}. For the
first time in recorded human history, one country occupied the high
ground of international affairs by itself. [When the United States
became involved in the Iraq War]{.underline}, which soon became a
quagmire, [its two closest competitors on the world stage, China and
Russia, began to extend their influence in world affairs at the expense
of the United States. However, when one looks at the entirety of the
world situation, unless there is a dramatic change in the internal
affairs of the United States, **[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has
a good chance of regaining its unipolarity]{.mark}** in world
affairs.]{.underline} The Fundamentals of American Power [[Part of the
reason for the]{.mark} apparent **[durability]{.mark}** of
the]{.underline} ability of the [United States]{.underline} to maintain
its great power status [[is its **geographical
location**]{.underline}]{.mark}. With an ocean on both coasts, friendly
nations to its north and south, and a climate that provides some of the
best farmland in the world, coupled with navigable rivers which provides
ease of transportation of goods and services from its heartland, **[the
United States is blessed with natural advantages]{.underline}**. In
addition, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is **energy
independent**]{.mark} thanks to the development of oil fracking. An
additional reason for U.S. staying power is [the]{.mark} **enduring
legacy of the U.S. [Constitution]{.mark}**, which so far [has provided
for a **stable transfer** of political power]{.mark} between **various
political antagonists**]{.underline}, notwithstanding the riot and
possible attempt at insurrection on January 6, 2021. With its history of
stable courts and a friendly business environment, [the United States
has been an oasis of stability in the world so far.]{.underline}
Combined with the physical and non-physical advantages discussed above,
[[U.S. demographics provide an]{.mark} internal manufacturing and
consumer market [advantage that **no other nation has**]{.mark}. While
it is true that the annual growth rate of the American population is
approaching stagnation]{.underline} levels, it can be argued that the
previous Trump administration depressed demographic growth by severely
limiting immigration. Coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic, the growth
rate for the American population is anemic. [[Current estimates of
demographic growth]{.underline}]{.mark} range from between 376 million
to 404 million people by 2060. This [[would still make the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [a **manufacturing** and **consumer
market**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And while the United States did achieve a
moment of unipolarity from the end of the Cold War to the invasion of
Iraq in 2003, [[it]{.mark} still [has the potential to return to
unipolarity based]{.mark} not only [on]{.mark} its advantages, but also
with [the **poor governance** and **negative demographic growth**
of]{.mark} its nearest competitors---**[Russia and
China]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The People's Republic of
**[China]{.underline}** It is a popular bit of wisdom that China is the
up-and-coming superpower and that the United States is a nation in
decline. While it is a popular saying, a cold and sober examination of
the facts about China, [the **[economic challenges]{.mark}** that China
faces, China's **[lack of natural resources]{.mark}**, as well as the
**[aging demographics]{.mark}** of China, [casts a **sobering picture**
for]{.mark} the future of the People's Republic of [China]{.mark}.
[While many people rave about China's economic
growth]{.mark}]{.underline}, and businesses' prostitute themselves to
try and tap China's internal market, [[**very few pay attention** to the
massive]{.mark} amount of **[debt]{.mark}** that is an **[impending
disaster]{.mark}** for the Chinese economy, and the danger that such a
collapse could cause. Estimates of Chinese debt are to the order of
**\$28 trillion**. [China's debt]{.mark} to GDP ratio [is **282
percent** of GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is thought that due to shadow
lending, **[the percentage of debt may be even higher]{.underline}**.
Geopolitician Peter Zeihan compares and contrasts the idea of money
between the United States and China. In the United States, money is
regarded as an economic good. In China, money is regarded as a political
good. In the United States, money has value in and of itself. In China,
money is a political good, and only has value if it can be used to
achieve a political goal. The concepts of rate of return or profit
margins do not exist in China, and therein lies the danger;
[[eventually]{.mark} the law of **[supply and demand will win
out]{.mark}**, and the Chinese economy will have to face a correction,
and **[the longer it takes]{.mark}** to face this economic correction,
**[the greater damage]{.mark}** that the inevitable correction will
cause to the Chinese economy. [China's inability]{.mark}]{.underline} of
China [[to feed itself is an **even starker
problem**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Partly to address this issue, Chinese
Premier Xi Jinping has launched a Clean Plate Campaign in China. In
2019, the National Bureau of Statistics reported that [**food prices
increased by 11.2 percent**. Pork prices]{.underline}, a staple in the
Chinese diet, **[rose]{.underline}** some **[85 percent]{.underline}**.
The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences estimates that domestic supplies
of [rice, wheat, and corn will fall short of demand by **25 million
tons** in 2025]{.underline}. Partly in response to its food crisis,
China has dispatched fishing fleets all over the world. China has become
a fishing superpower. From Ecuador and Ghana to the waters off of North
Korea, Chinese fishing vessels prowl the world's oceans harvesting fish
in numbers so huge as to threaten the sustainability of certain fish
species. Another serious issue facing China is the decline of its
population. Currently, there are 1.4 billion people in China. The
population in China declined for the first time in 2020. According to
The Lancet, the **[[Chinese population will drop]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to 732 million people by 2100. This is coupled with the fact that [the
majority of the Chinese population will be middle-aged or
elderly]{.underline}. [[China is]{.mark} also [the **largest net
importer of oil**]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}. In 2020, China
imported 542.37 million tons of oil. The vast majority of this oil is
transported over the ocean, and the ships carrying the oil must run a
gauntlet of not only the Indian Ocean but the first island chain as well
in order to reach China. [[In]{.mark} the event of a [conflict, China
could be **strangled economically**]{.mark}]{.underline} by denying the
use of the sea route to China by any foreign power. When these factors
are considered, [[China's claim to great power status has to be
**questioned**]{.mark}, if not **denied**.]{.underline} Russia If China
is a paper dragon, Russia is a paper bear. If China's claim to great
power status is tenuous at best, [Russia's claim rests solely on its
vast, but **aging**, **nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}. Since the fall of
the Berlin Wall, [[Russia has declined in **almost every
respect**]{.mark} of great power status]{.underline}, though it
maintains a hold on being a regional power. Russia's GDP for 2020 was
\$1.47 trillion. [[Russia's economy]{.mark} is currently ranked at the
**eleventh spot** in the top world economies]{.underline}. While an
impressive figure for a nation with slightly under 146 million people,
contrasted to the U.S. GDP for 2020 of \$20.93 trillion, it **[[is
lacking in great power status]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Russian
demographics trends, like those for China, are on a downward trend. A
Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 2.1 represents the Replacement Level
Fertility, or the average number of children per woman needed for each
generation to replace itself. The TFR for Russia is 1.8. According to a
United Nations report, the **[[Russian population is projected to
fall]{.underline}]{.mark}** to 83.7 million by 2100. Alcoholism and drug
abuse are rampant in Russia, with the latter becoming much more common
recently. It is estimated that there are over 2.2 million practicing
alcoholics and 4 to 6 million regular drug addicts in Russia. This is a
deep-rooted problem among the Russian people, suggesting despair and
lack of hope among Russians. While Russia is blessed with vast amounts
of mineral and natural resources---including iron ore, manganese,
chromium, nickel, platinum, copper, tin, lead, tungsten, diamonds,
phosphates, and gold---only the fossil fuels, oil, natural gas, and coal
are the ones that bring in hard currency. Russia's inability to prosper
despite having vast amounts of wealth is a problem that has bedeviled
Russia since the Mongol invasion in 1240 AD. With these issues facing
the two nearest U.S. competitors, and the absence of any other world
power to assume unipolarity, it is probable that [[the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [will]{.mark} eventually [resume its status as a
**unipolar power**]{.mark}]{.underline}, barring some sort of internal
collapse of the United States.

### Transition Wars

#### [Transition war]{.underline} is inevitable.

**Torrieri '23** \[Jeffrey D; Fall; Gettysburg College; Gettysburg
College Scholarship, "The Effect of Power Shifts on War,"
https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2174&context=student_scholarship\]

THE POWER TRANSITION THEORY

The power transition model, as originally spelled out in The War Ledger,
predicts that [nations are likely to become **aggressors**]{.underline}
[when]{.underline} [they are experiencing rising power yet]{.underline}
still [feel]{.underline} like [they are receiving a smaller share
of]{.underline} the [benefits than]{.underline} other equal, yet more
[established]{.underline}, [powers]{.underline} are receiving from the
international system. This is due to the fact that these rising powers
were not part of the original coalition of nations that built the
international order and, as a result, were not designed to receive the
advantages that other great powers are in such an order (Organski and
Kugler 1980). Without support from other great powers, these [rising
nations]{.underline} would logically [resort to
**aggression**]{.underline} in order [to]{.underline} **[cement
themselves]{.underline}** in the position they think they deserve on the
world stage.

[Whether]{.underline} or not the [emergence of a rising
power]{.underline} disturbs the international system enough to
[cause]{.underline} a [war depends on]{.underline} some factors. Not
only does it depend on the size of the rising nation, but also on the
"**[speed]{.underline}** [with which modernization occurs]{.underline}
within big countries..." (Organski and Kugler 1980, 21). It is likely
only a **[rapid [shift]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in power]{.mark}
that]{.underline} would [[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} to occur, [as a slow rise]{.underline}
in power would [give]{.underline} the [dominant nation]{.underline} more
[time to work out the problems]{.underline} that are occurring as the
rising nation transitions (Organski and Kugler 1980). Besides size and
speed, the **[level of [power]{.mark}]{.underline}** that the rising
nation actually achieves [**[relative]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} how much power [the]{.underline} **[[dominant
nation]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
**[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A [rising nation that
achieves]{.mark}]{.underline} a [power]{.underline} **[nearly
[equal]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to the [power]{.mark}]{.underline} that
which [the dominant nation has will be]{.underline} more
[**[likely]{.underline}** [to **incite**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[a]{.underline} system-changing **[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Kim
1991; Kim 1992).

Woosang Kim adds to the power transition theory as expressed in The War
Ledger, arguing that [**[major war]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[becomes]{.underline} more [[likely]{.underline}
[when]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [established]{.mark}]{.underline}
dominant [[nation feels **threatened**]{.underline}]{.mark} by the way
in which a newly rising power, a power which may become the new dominant
power, is changing the international order (1992). Kim writes,
"Threatened by demands for changes in the existing international order,
[the dominant nation has a **large stake** in preserving
the]{.underline} **[s]{.underline}**tatus **[quo]{.underline}**, in
which it [and its allies share]{.underline} the [benefits]{.underline}
and privileges of.... [The dominant nation]{.underline}, with the
support of its allies, [tries to thwart the challenger's
progress]{.underline}. [During]{.underline} such a period of **[power
transition]{.underline}**...[major power **war** is more
likely]{.underline}." (Kim 1992, 156-157). This means that [there are
two ways]{.underline} in which [power transition]{.underline} could
[lead to war]{.underline}; [if]{.underline} the [rising power feels left
out or]{.underline} if the [dominant power feels]{.underline} like they
are being [overshadowed]{.underline}.

The power transition theory can be useful when trying to figure out if a
contemporary situation in International Relations shows potential for
major conflict. One such situation is the rise of China as a potential
challenger to the United States as the dominant nation on earth (Clarke
2011). Throughout the bulk of this century, [China has been rapidly
growing]{.underline} both **[economically]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[militarily]{.underline}**. China has also been
seeing a sharp increase in the amount of soft power, which is the
ability for a nation to influence another nation without using force or
pressure, that it wields (Nguyen 2017). **[China]{.underline}** [has
been able to expand its soft]{.underline} **[power]{.underline}** by
exporting its culture to other parts of the world. For example, the
Chinese film industry has grown to become the second largest in the
world, and it is being used to promote Chinese culture to global
audiences (Nguyen 2017, 51). The expansion of soft power can be used by
China to rise in overall power more discreetly, as the actual effect of
soft power can't be measured as easily as something like GDP growth.
This discrete rise in power, when combined with its military and
economic expansion, will allow China to appear to be rising in power
even faster relative to the United States, which, according to Organski
and Kugler, is a main factor in increasing the likelihood that a power
transition will lead to war (1980).

The power transition theory is not without its flaws, as literature
exists that claims to disprove, or at least critique, Organski and
Kugler's theory. According to one critique, very few of the dominant
nations since the beginning of modern International Relations (1648),
"were seriously threatened by rising powers or coalitions of great
powers. They went to war because they thought they were powerful enough
to become more powerful still" (Lebow and Valentino 2009, 405). One of
the nations that Lebow and Valentino reference as not seriously
threatened by coalitions of great powers was Nazi Germany (2009). I
would argue that, if you actually examine this time period from the
perspective of the power transition theory, it was **[[Nazi]{.mark}
[Germany]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[was]{.mark} the **rising
power**]{.underline} [[threatening]{.underline}]{.mark} the declining
dominance of [**[Britain]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[France]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} [Britain and France
declared]{.underline} that [they would fight Germany]{.underline} if it
invaded Poland [out of]{.underline} **[fear]{.underline}** [of Germany
**superseding**]{.underline} them [as the dominant power]{.underline} if
they were to successfully do so. Such an explanation would also fit in
with Woosang Kim's addition to the power transition theory stating that
[a dominant power would be]{.underline} [willing to go to war
for]{.underline} the sake of [preserving the]{.underline}
[s]{.underline}tatus [quo]{.underline} from which they benefit, as
Britain and France had enjoyed effectively running Europe postWorld War
I until Hitler became aggressive (1992).

THE THEORY OF HEGEMONIC WAR

Another theory that builds upon ideas similar to the ones laid out in
the power transition theory is **[[Thucydides'
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} **[hegemonic
war]{.underline}**. This theory essentially [[says]{.underline}]{.mark}
that the [[stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, or instability, [of the
international system is [determined by]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[presence]{.underline}, or absence, [of a **[rigid
hierarchy]{.mark}**]{.underline} of nations, [[topped by]{.mark} a
**clear [hegemon]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which can be defined as single
dominant power the global order (Snidal 1985)), free of economic or
political disturbances (Gilpin 1988). In a disturbed system, the threat
of instability [[breaking]{.mark} the [hierarchy]{.mark}]{.underline} of
nations [has the potential to **[ignite]{.mark}**]{.underline} a
**[hegemonic [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which can lead to a system
change if the hierarchy is successfully broken by the conflict (Gilpin
1988).

In the modern day, the theory of hegemonic war, like the power
transition theory, can be examined when looking at the rise of
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [[is]{.mark} predicted to
be]{.underline} "[an **[aggressive]{.mark} state**]{.underline}
determined to achieve regional hegemony" (Beeson 2009, 95). [[If
China]{.mark} was to try and [claim]{.mark}]{.underline} this
[[heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline} in this type of way, [it
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} surely [[shake up]{.mark} the US-led [global
order]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [China would be]{.underline} essentially
[taking]{.underline} a major region of the world, [East
Asia,]{.underline} [out of US control]{.underline}. Given that [China's
economy and military have been growing rapidly]{.underline} over the
last few decades, the [nation]{.underline} has become the world's
largest importer and exporter of goods, and [has seen its]{.underline}
[**military budget** rise by almost a **factor of ten**]{.underline} in
the past twenty years, it seems [the country is gaining
power]{.underline} enough to attempt a reclamation of the region (Nguyen
2017). Furthermore, the East Asian powerhouse [has already begun to
challenge the US]{.underline} "[through trade]{.underline} agreements,
political [rhetoric]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} regional
[organizations]{.underline} that together build up a soft balance
against the U.S. primacy" (Nguyen 2017, 58). [[If]{.mark} this challenge
gets to a point that the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [begins to [feel]{.mark} a
[disturbance]{.mark} in the]{.underline} current
**[hierarchy]{.underline}** of nations, [a]{.underline} **[hegemonic
[war]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} very possibly
[[occur]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Though the theory of hegemonic war is useful in examining possible
threats to the current international system, it is far from a perfect
theory. One issue with the theory is that it assumes that "collective
action in the international system is impossible in the absence of a
dominant state," even though "Graphical analysis...show\[s\] that
cooperation can not only be sustained in the face of declining hegemony,
it may even be enhanced." (Snidal 1985, 579-580). Such information could
disprove the hegemonic war theory's assumption that the absence of a
rigid hierarchical structure of the international system with a hegemon
on top will lead to turmoil, seeing as how cooperation is the opposite
of conflict. On the contrary, however, one could point to instances in
history where the absence of a clear hegemon led to instability, and
eventually to system-changing war. Webb and Krasner point out that in
the period between the first and second World Wars, a time marked by
political instability in Europe and global economic depression, Britain,
which acted as the global hegemon before the first World War, had lost
its ability to do so, and the United States, which emerged from World
War I as the only real candidate to replace Britain, refused to assume
such a role (1989). I would add that the fact that **[[World War
II]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the]{.underline} **[deadliest]{.underline}**
[system-changing war in **history**]{.underline}, directly
[[followed]{.underline}]{.mark} this [inter-war [time
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[hegemonic instability]{.underline}**]{.mark}
further [[proves]{.underline}]{.mark} that the
[**[turmoil]{.underline}** [caused by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} [**[absence]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [a
**[hegemon]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the international order could
**[[outweigh]{.underline}]{.mark}** any [[attempts at]{.mark}
[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}.

APPLICATIONS TO ASSUMPTIONS IN INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS

The theories I elaborate on above are inextricably linked to broader
theoretical perspectives on the study of International Relations. The
power transition theory, as well as the theory of hegemonic war, to an
extent, are fundamentally identified with neorealist theory because of
the focus on national security as the chief concern of major powers in
the international system. Neorealists, as we learned in class, make the
following assumptions about the international system: states are the
only significant actors, the issues that states face are arranged in a
fixed, hierarchical structure with national security always at the top,
and states act as a unitary actor. The power transition theory looks
exclusively at how states interact within the international system,
ignoring any supranational powers, international organizations, or even
individual actors that could alter the course that these states take on
the way to power transition. Organski, Kugler, and even Gilpin seem to
consider all of the various actors, both groups and individuals, within
states as part of one whole, which is a fundamentally neorealist idea.
This comes as no surprise, especially considering that the theory of
hegemonic war is based on the writing of Thucydides, who was the ancient
Greek historian considered the father of the realist theories.

CONCLUSION

By examining the assumptions that are made by both the power transition
theory and the theory of hegemonic war, which I have determined can hold
up to the scrutiny of critical opinions, I have determined that my
original hypothesis, which is that **[system-changing
wars]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} more **[likely]{.underline}** to
occur [when a major actor experiences a **rapid shift**]{.underline} [in
power]{.underline} in either direction, is supported. The power
transition theory supports this hypothesis by explaining the idea that a
[state that is **quickly rising**]{.underline} [in power
can]{.underline} often [cause the state that is]{.underline} already in
the [dominant]{.underline} state of power, or is slipping out of the
dominant state of power, [to feel **threatened**]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} could [lead]{.underline} [to]{.underline} a **[major
war]{.underline}** [between these powers]{.underline}. The theory of
hegemonic war validates this hypothesis by explaining a similar
phenomenon in which [a hegemonic power]{.underline}, when
[feeling]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} [international
system]{.underline} allowing them to retain such dominant power
[is]{.underline} in danger of [collapsing, is likely to initiate
a]{.underline} **[major conflict]{.underline}** [in an attempt to
preserve the system]{.underline}.

I believe both of these theories are useful in making predictions about
how the current, rapidly [**[rising power]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in a
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates-[led]{.underline}
international [system [could]{.mark}]{.underline} possibly [[lead
to]{.mark} the first **[system-changing war]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[since]{.underline} **[1945]{.underline}**. Knowing that these theories
have merit to them, we can assume that it is at least possible that
preventing future relations between the United States and China from
turning into a power struggle where the US is feeling as if China is
trying to undermine or overtake it could make a difference in preventing
system changing wars. The next step would be trying to figure out
meaningful policy goals that both nations could advance to proactively
stop such a disaster from occurring. That, however, is a question for a
different time.

#### Multipolarity fails---it generates violent fill in and risks nuclear war

**Kagan 19---**(Robert Kagan, Senior fellow at the Brookings Institute
and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, "The Jungle Grows
Back: America and Our Imperiled World", Alfred A. Knopf)//ND

At the root of such thinking is the belief that there is an escape from
power or that it is possible to wield power without error and without
failure. [Americans]{.underline}, blessed by their favorable geography
and wealth, still [[believe they have a choice between engaging the
world and letting the world fend for itself]{.underline}]{.mark}. [There
has been no shortage of realists, idealists, progressives, and
conservatives telling them that substantially disengaging from our
alliances and overseas commitments is possible and
cost-free]{.underline}. But the reaMul choice we face is not between the
good and the bad but between the bad and the worse. [It is between
maintaining the liberal world order,]{.underline} with all the moral and
material costs that entails[, or letting it collapse and courting the
catastrophes that must inevitably follow. **[What is likely to follow is
a return to the multipolar power struggles that brought so much
devastation to the world before the United States redirected the course
of history.]{.mark}**]{.underline} That is where the deep ruts lead,
back to the state of the world prior to 1945. [Only this time, the
powers competing and clashing will be armed with nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} It is ironic that some of those who spent the Cold
War warning that America's hawkish foreign policies would result in
nuclear holocaust do not seem "democracies would result in nuclear
holocaust do not seem to fear nuclear war in the competitive multipolar
world that may be our future. We have yet to test the question of
whether nations with nuclear weapons can go to war, because so far the
United States and the liberal world order have prevented such wars. But
[[if history is any guide, to count on the horror of new weaponry alone
to maintain the peace is a most risky bet.]{.underline}]{.mark} Had you
cast that bet before the two world wars, you would have lost. These days
some experts tell us [it was the existence of nuclear weapons that
prevented the United States and the Soviet Union from coming to blows,
but few at the time had any confidence that nuclear weapons were a
guarantor of peace.]{.underline} Throughout much of the Cold War there
were those who simply assumed that the world was heading inevitably
toward Armageddon. They were wrong that it would come as a result of
American Cold War policies, but in the long run they may still prove
right.

####  Unipolarity deters a violent power transition war\-\--[every theory of IR agrees]{.underline}.

Matthew **Kroenig 22**, columnist at Foreign Policy and vice president
and senior director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Center for
Strategy and Security, 8/27/22, "International Relations Theory Suggests
Great-Power War Is Coming",
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/08/27/international-relations-theory-suggests-great-power-war-is-coming/>,
vw

Let us begin with [power politics]{.underline}. We are entering a more
multipolar world. To be sure, **[[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is
still the world's leading power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to
nearly all objective measures, [[but China has risen to]{.mark} occupy a
strong **[second-place]{.mark} position**]{.underline} in military and
economic might. Europe is an economic and regulatory superpower in its
own right. [A more aggressive [Russia maintains the **largest nuclear
weapons stockpile** on Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}. And major powers in
the developing world---such as India, Indonesia, South Africa, and
Brazil---are choosing a nonaligned path. [Realists argue that
[multipolar systems are **unstable**]{.mark} and **prone to major wars
of miscalculation**. World War I is a classic example.]{.underline}
Multipolar systems are unstable in part because [each country must worry
about **multiple potential adversaries**]{.underline}. Indeed, at
present, [the U.S. Defense Department frets about **possible
simultaneous conflicts** with Russia in Europe and China in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. Moreover, U.S. President Joe [Biden has
stated that the use of military force remains on the table as a last
resort to deal with Iran's nuclear program. A [**three-front war** is
**not out of the question.**]{.mark} Wars of miscalculation often result
when states **underestimate their adversary**. States doubt their
opponent's power or resolve to fight, so they test them]{.underline}.
Sometimes, the enemy is bluffing, and the challenge pays off. [If the
enemy is **determined** to **defend its interests**]{.underline},
however, [**major war can result**. Russian President Vladimir
**[Putin]{.mark} likely [miscalculated]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} launching
an invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, incorrectly assuming that
war would be easy. Some realist scholars warned for some time that a
Russian invasion of Ukraine was coming, and there is still the
possibility that the war in Ukraine could spill across NATO's borders,
turning this conflict into a direct U.S.-Russia conflagration. In
addition, there is the danger that Chinese President [**[Xi]{.mark}**
Jinping [**might miscalculate over Taiwan**. Washington's]{.mark}
confusing **["strategic ambiguity"]{.mark}** policy as to whether it
would defend the island [only **adds to the instability**]{.mark}. Biden
has said he would defend Taiwan, but his own White House contradicted
him. Many leaders are confused, including possibly [Xi]{.mark}. He
[might]{.mark} **mistakenly believe** he could get away with an
**[attack]{.mark} on [Taiwan]{.mark}**---[only to have the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates **[intervene violently]{.mark}** to stop
him.]{.underline} Moreover, after several U.S. presidents have
threatened "all options on the table" for the Iranian nuclear program
without backing it up, Tehran might assume that it can make a dash for
the bomb without a U.S. response. [[If Iran is mistaken in doubting
Biden's resolve, **war could result**.]{.mark}]{.underline} \[\[IMAGE
OMITTED\]\] Realists also focus on shifts in the balance of power and
worry about the rise of China and the relative decline of the United
States. [[Power transition theory says]{.mark} that the fall of a
dominant great power and the rise of an ascendant challenger **often
results in war**. Some experts worry that [**Washington and Beijing**
may be **falling into this "Thucydides Trap."**]{.mark} Their
[dysfunctional]{.mark} autocratic [systems make it **unlikely** that
Beijing or Moscow will **usurp global leadership**]{.mark} from the
United States anytime soon, [but]{.mark} a closer look at the historical
record shows that [challengers sometimes start **wars of
aggression**]{.mark} when their expansive **ambitions are
thwarted**]{.underline}. Like Germany in World War I and Japan in World
War II, [[Russia may]{.mark} be **[lash]{.mark}ing [out]{.mark}** to
**reverse its decline**, [and China may also be **weak** and
**dangerous**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some people might argue that nuclear
deterrence will still work, but [military technology is
changing]{.underline}. The world is experiencing a "Fourth Industrial
Revolution" as [new technologies]{.underline}---such as artificial
intelligence, quantum computing and communications, additive
manufacturing, robotics, hypersonic missiles, directed energy, and
others---[**promise to transform the global economy**, societies, and
the **battlefield**.]{.underline} Many defense experts believe we are on
the eve of a new revolution in military affairs. It is possible that
these new technologies could, like tanks and aircraft on the eve of
World War II, give an advantage to militaries that go on the offense,
making war more likely. At a minimum, these new weapons systems could
confuse assessments of the balance of power, contributing to the above
risks of miscalculation. China, for example, is leading in several of
these technologies, including hypersonic missiles, certain applications
for artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. These
advantages---or even the false perception in Beijing that these
advantages might exist---could tempt China to invade Taiwan. \[\[IMAGE
OMITTED\]\] [Even [liberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, a more optimistic
theory in general, **[[provides a reason for
pessimism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To be sure, liberals are right that
institutions, economic interdependence, and democracy have facilitated
cooperation within the liberal world order. The United States and its
democratic allies in North America, Europe, and East Asia are more
united than ever before. But these same factors are increasingly
sparking conflict on the fault lines between the liberal and illiberal
world orders. In the new Cold War, [[international institutions
have]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[become **new arenas for
competition**. Russia and China are **infiltrating**]{.mark} **these
[institutions]{.mark}** and turning them against their intended
purposes]{.underline}. Who can forget Russia chairing a meeting of the
United Nations Security Council as its armies invaded Ukraine in
February? Similarly, China used its influence in the World Health
Organization to stymie an effective investigation into COVID-19's
origins. And [**dictators** vie for seats on the U.N. Human Rights
Council to ensure their egregious human rights abuses **escape
scrutiny**. Instead of facilitating cooperation, international
institutions are increasingly **[exacerbating
conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Liberal scholars also argue that
economic interdependence mitigates conflict. But this theory always had
a chicken-and-egg problem. Is trade driving good relations, or are good
relations driving trade? We are seeing the answer play out in real time.
[[The free world is]{.mark} recognizing that it is [**too economically
dependent** on]{.mark} its enemies in [Moscow and Beijing, and it is
**decoupling**]{.mark} as fast as it can]{.underline}. Western
corporations pulled out of Russia overnight. New legislation and
regulations in the United States, Europe, and Japan are restricting
trade and investment in China. It is simply irrational for Wall Street
to invest in Chinese technology companies that are working with China's
People's Liberation Army to develop weapons intended to kill Americans.
[But China is **also decoupling** from the free world]{.underline}. Xi
is prohibiting Chinese tech firms from listing on Wall Street, for
example, because he doesn't want to share proprietary information with
Western powers. [The **[economic interdependence]{.mark}** between the
liberal and illiberal worlds that has served as a ballast against
conflict **[is now eroding]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Democratic peace
theory says democracies cooperate with other democracies. But [the
**[central fault line]{.mark}** in the international system
today]{.underline}, as Biden explains, [[is "the battle between
**democracy** and **autocracy**."]{.mark}]{.underline} To be sure, the
United States still maintains cordial relations with some
nondemocracies, such as Saudi Arabia. But **[the world order is
increasingly divided]{.underline}** with the United States and its
status quo-oriented democratic allies in NATO, Japan, South Korea, and
Australia on one side and the revisionist autocracies of China, Russia,
and Iran on the other. [One does not need a stethoscope to detect the
echoes of the free world's conflict against Nazi Germany, fascist Italy,
and imperial Japan.]{.underline} Finally, constructivist arguments about
the pacifying effects of global norms were always plagued with doubts
about whether these norms were truly universal. As [[China engages in
**genocide in Xinjiang** and Russia issues **bloodcurdling nuclear
threats**]{.mark} and **castrates prisoners of war** in
Ukraine]{.underline}, we now have our gruesome answer. Moreover,
[constructivists might note that the democracy versus autocracy cleavage
in international politics is not simply an issue of governance but of
ways of life]{.underline}. The speeches and writings of Xi and Putin are
often ideological rants about the superiority of autocratic systems and
the failings of democracy. Like it or not---[we are back in a
**20th-century contest** over whether democratic or autocratic
governments can better deliver for their people, adding a more dangerous
**ideological element** to this competition.]{.underline} Fortunately,
there is some good news. The best understanding of international
politics may be found in a combination of theories. Much of humanity
prefers a liberal international order, and this order is only made
possible by the realist military power of the United States and its
democratic allies. Moreover, 2,500 years of theory and history suggest
that democracies tend to win these hard-power competitions and
autocracies flame out disastrously in the end. Unfortunately, the
clarifying moments that bend history in an arc toward justice often only
emerge after major-power wars. Let's hope that today's incoming students
are not reminiscing at their graduation ceremonies about where they were
when World War III began. But **[[IR theory gives us plenty of reasons
to be concerned.]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[\[IMAGE OMITTED\]\]

### AT: China Rise Inevitable

#### China rise not inevitable -- demographic inversion, education crackdowns, lack of FDI, youth unemployment. BUT the US needs to maintain pressure. 

**Rice '24** \[Condoleezza; August 20; Director of the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University, PhD in Political Science at Josef
Korbel School of International Studies at the University of Denver, MA
in Political Science at the University of Notre Dame, former Secretary
of State; Foreign Affairs, "The Perils of Isolationism,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/perils-isolationism-condoleezza-rice\]

China's future is by no means as bleak as Russia's. Yet
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, [[has]{.mark} internal
[contradictions]{.mark}. The country is experiencing a rapid
[demographic inversion]{.mark} rarely seen outside of war. Births have
declined by more than 50 percent since 2016, such that the total
fertility rate is approaching 1.0.]{.underline} The one-child policy,
put in place in 1979 and brutally enforced for decades, was the kind of
mistake that only an authoritarian regime could have made, and now,
millions of Chinese men don't have mates. Since the policy ended in
2016, the state has tried to browbeat women into having children,
turning women's rights into a crusade for childbearing---yet more
evidence of the panic in Beijing.

[Another contradiction stems from the uneasy coexistence of capitalism
and authoritarian communism]{.underline}. Xi has turned out to be a true
Marxist. [China's golden age of [private sector--led
growth]{.mark}]{.underline} [[has slowed]{.underline}]{.mark} in large
part [because of the C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist
[P]{.underline}arty's [anxiety about alternative sources of power. China
[used to lead t]{.mark}he world [in]{.mark} online [education startups,
but]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2021, [the [government]{.mark} [cracked
down]{.mark} on them because it could not reliably monitor their
content.]{.underline} A once thriving [[entrepreneurial culture has
withered]{.mark} away.]{.underline} China's aggressive behavior toward
foreigners has exposed other contradictions. [Xi knows that [China needs
f]{.mark}oreign [d]{.mark}irect [i]{.mark}nvestment]{.underline}, and he
courts corporate leaders from across the world. [[But]{.mark} then, a
Western firm's offices are raided or one of its Chinese employees is
detained, and, not surprisingly, a [trust deficit grows]{.mark} between
Beijing and foreign investors.]{.underline}

China is also suffering a trust deficit with its youth. Young Chinese
citizens may be proud of their country, but a [[20 percent youth
unemployment]{.mark} rate has undermined their optimism for the
future.]{.underline} Xi's heavy-handed propagation of "Xi Jinping
Thought" turns them off. This has led them to adopt an attitude of what
is known colloquially as "lying flat," a passive-aggressive stance of
going along to get along while harboring no loyalty or enthusiasm for
the regime. Now is thus not the time to isolate Chinese youth but the
time to welcome them to study in the United States. As Nicholas Burns,
the U.S. ambassador to China, has noted, a regime that goes out of its
way to intimidate its citizens to discourage them from engaging with
Americans is not a confident regime. Indeed, it is a signal for the
United States to keep pushing for connections to the Chinese people.

Meanwhile, [[Washington]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} to maintain economic
[pressure on]{.mark} the revisionist powers. It should continue
[isolating Russia]{.mark}, with an eye toward arresting Beijing's
creeping support for the Kremlin.]{.underline} But it should refrain
from imposing blunt sanctions against China, since they would be
ineffective and counterproductive, crippling the U.S. economy in the
process. Targeted sanctions, by contrast, may [[slow Beijing's military
and tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[progress]{.underline}]{.mark},
at least for a while. Iran is much more vulnerable. Never again should
Washington unfreeze Iranian assets, as the Biden administration did as
part of a deal to release five imprisoned Americans. Efforts to find
moderates among Iran's theocrats are doomed to failure and serve only to
allow the mullahs to escape the contradictions of their unpopular,
aggressive, and incompetent regime.

#### The US maintains key advances, despite rapid Chinese buildup.

[[reflects]{.underline}]{.mark} a strategic [[focus on

[faces]{.mark}]{.underline} serious [[obstacles]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[It is grappling with]{.underline}
**[[corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [which]{.underline} could

experience, a vast alliance network, and forward-deployed forces

Perhaps most significantly, however, [[China cannot]{.underline}]{.mark}
yet [[match]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tate**[s']{.underline}** greatest force

These alliances are more than symbolic. [They enable]{.underline}
real-time [coordination]{.underline} that allows the United States to
pre-position forces far from its shores, thus
**[[amplifying]{.underline}]{.mark}** its [military]{.underline}
**[[effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and readiness]{.underline}. A
superpower is a country capable of projecting force and exercising
influence in every corner of the world. The United States meets this
definition. China does not, at least not yet.

The decentralized nature of the United States' **[[democratic
system]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in which significant governance
responsibilities remain vested with state and local authorities,
[[remains]{.mark} an]{.underline} American
[[advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}, too. Unlike in China, the United
States' regular [electoral cycles and peaceful transfers]{.underline} of
power [enable]{.underline} citizens to insist on [change]{.underline}
when they become dissatisfied with the country's trajectory. And
although the United States must urgently address the many threats to its
democratic norms from extreme polarization and institutional erosion, it
still boasts serious checks on presidential power from a free media, an
independent legislature, and a transparent legal system.

FALSE CEILING

It is vital to remember that [Beijing's]{.underline} greatest
[wins]{.underline} have tended to [occur]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [in spite of American efforts, but in
their]{.underline} **[absence]{.underline}**. Take 5G
telecommunications: China developed and deployed next-generation
wireless networks at breakneck speed, cornering markets in Africa, Asia,
and parts of Europe. This did not happen because the United States
lacked the capacity to compete, but because it was slow to invest in
domestic alternatives and unwilling to mobilize resources to scale a
national strategy at China's pace.

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} especially **[rapid
[advancements]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[in]{.underline}
**[quantum]{.underline}**]{.mark} communications [[and]{.underline}
**[satellite]{.underline}**]{.mark} [networks
[underscore]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[extent to which
it]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[prioritized]{.underline}]{.mark}
leadership in **[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies [that
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
been slower to embrace]{.underline} or fund at scale. This success has
been driven by government subsidies, aggressive industrial policies, and
a singular focus on securing critical raw materials, often at a high
geopolitical and environmental price. These gains come with other costs,
too. The Chinese government's laser focus on specific strategic domains
has diverted its attention and resources from projects that would drive
longer-term economic growth, such as reforming the social safety net and
boosting domestic consumption.

As China struggles, [the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
[**[S]{.underline}**t]{.mark}ates [[should press its
advantages]{.underline}]{.mark}. To do so, U.S. [policymakers must make
significant investments]{.underline} in areas in which the United States
appears strong, boosting funding for research and development and
cutting-edge industries, attracting global talent through targeted
immigration reform, fortifying alliances in Asia and Europe, and
**[[rebuilding]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the U.S.]{.underline}
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**ase. If American leaders continue to wring
their hands over China's ascendancy instead of taking these crucial
steps, Washington's strategic advantage could quickly erode.

It is undeniable that the United States faces serious challenges. But it
is equally undeniable that it retains extraordinary strengths---and that
its democratic institutions, albeit stressed, possess a unique capacity
for renewal. **[[Competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the United
States and Beijing [[will be]{.mark} a [defining]{.mark} feature of the
coming decades]{.underline}. But although [China's]{.underline}
centralized governance may deliver rapid advancements in key areas, its
[gains are fragile]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} real
**[peril]{.underline}** [for the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates may [lie]{.underline} not in the unmatchable
rise of a new rival but [in]{.underline} its own

#### China's military is still far behind the US -- nuclear subs, aircraft carries, and transport planes prove.

Militarily, meanwhile, [most [analysts]{.mark} still [see **China as far
from**]{.mark} **being a global peer of [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates**, [despite]{.mark} the rapid [modernization of Chinese
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}. How significant and lasting is the U.S.
advantage? Consider the [capabilities that give the United]{.underline}
States what the political scientist Barry Posen has called "command of
the commons"---that is, [[control]{.mark} over [the air]{.mark}, the
open [sea, and space]{.mark}. Command of the commons is what [makes the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [a true]{.mark} global military
[power]{.mark}. Until [China can contest]{.mark} the United States'
[dominance]{.mark} in this domain, it [will **remain merely a
regional**]{.mark} **military [power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We [have
counted 13 categories of systems as underlying this ability---everything
[from nuc]{.mark}lear [sub]{.mark}marine[s to
sat]{.mark}ellite[s]{.mark} to aircraft carriers to heavy transport
planes---and [China is below 20 percent of the U.S. level]{.mark} in all
but five of these capabilities]{.underline}, and in only two areas
(cruisers and destroyers; military satellites) does China have more than
a third of the U.S. capability. The [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[remains]{.mark} so [far ahead]{.mark} because it has [devoted immense
resources]{.mark} to developing these systems over many decades;
[closing these gaps would]{.mark} also [require decades of
effort]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[disparity becomes]{.mark} even
[greater when one moves beyond a]{.mark} raw [count and factors in
quality]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [United States' 68 nuclear
submarines]{.underline}, for example, [are too quiet for China to track,
whereas China's 12 nuclear submarines remain noisy enough for the U.S.
Navy's]{.underline} advanced antisubmarine warfare sensors [to
track]{.underline} them in deep water.

A [comparison with the Soviet Union is instructive.]{.underline} The
[Red Army was a real peer of the U.S. military]{.underline} during the
Cold War [in a way that the Chinese military is not]{.underline}. The
[[Soviets enjoyed **three advantages that China lacks**]{.mark}. First
was favorable [geography]{.mark}]{.underline}: with the conquest of
Eastern Europe in World War II, the Soviets could base massive military
force in the heart of Europe, a region that comprised a huge chunk of
the world's economic output. [Second was a large commitment to [guns
over butter]{.mark}]{.underline} in a command economy geared toward the
production of military power: the percentage of GDP that Moscow devoted
to defense remained in the double digits throughout the Cold War, an
unprecedented share for a modern great power in peacetime. [Third
was]{.underline} the [relatively uncomplicated nature of [military
tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}: for most of the Cold War, the Soviets
could command their comparatively weak economy to swiftly match the
United States' nuclear and missile capability and arguably outmatch its
conventional forces. Only in the last decade of the Cold War did the
Soviets run into the same [**[problem]{.mark} that [China faces]{.mark}
today**: [how to produce complex weapons that are competitive]{.mark}
with those emerging from a **technologically dynamic America with a huge
military R & D budget** (now \$140 billion a year).]{.underline}

The [[conditions that allowed the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to

]{.mark}**industrial [powers with]{.mark} considerable [potential to
check Chinese power]{.mark}**, and the world's other major power---the
United States---remains [committed to helping]{.mark} defend
[them]{.mark}]{.underline}. India's population is now larger and
significantly younger than China's and its economy is growing more
rapidly. Many of China's neighbors are already balancing more
energetically: [[Defense budgets are rising sharply]{.mark}, and
**[Australia, India, and Japan are coordinating with each
other]{.mark}** and with the United States. The greater their fear of
Chinese hegemony, the more vigorous such responses will be.]{.underline}

In addition, India already has a nuclear arsenal and Japan or South
Korea could acquire a nuclear deterrent if the need arose. [Officials in
[Tokyo and Seoul have]{.mark} previously [made it clear]{.mark} that
[they see this as a viable option]{.mark} should circumstances require,
and [possessing their own deterrent would]{.mark} further [limit China's
ability to intimidate them]{.mark}.]{.underline} If China does not want
more of its neighbors to acquire nuclear weapons, therefore, it should
limit its ambitions and make such a step unnecessary.

[[Nor are Asian powers likely to be swayed]{.mark} by Chinese President
Xi Jinping's suggestion that "it is for the people of Asia to run the
affairs of Asia]{.underline}, solve the problems of Asia, and uphold the
security of Asia." Such statements are [obviously [intended to make the
U.S. role in Asia seem less legitimate, but the
belief]{.mark}]{.underline} that a shared "Asian" identity will override
each individual state's self-interest ignores the power of modern
nationalism, which [[did not exist]{.mark} when the pre-modern,
Sino-centric tributary system was in place. [Nationalism is a powerful
force in China]{.mark}, of course, but [also in India, South Korea,
Japan, Australia, and Vietnam]{.mark}. It is [hard to imagine]{.mark}
any of these [states **preferring subordination to Beijing**]{.mark}
**to national autonomy.**]{.underline}

Lastly, [[modern surveillance and communications tech]{.mark}nology
[makes it]{.mark} much [easier]{.mark} for states to identify
threatening powers and coordinate defensive responses. [A **Chinese bid

that "it is for the people of Asia to run the affairs of Asia, solve the

obviously intended to make the U.S. role in Asia seem less legitimate,
but the belief that a shared "Asian" identity will override each

Western response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine illustrates, countries
facing a common danger can act with surprising swiftness when necessary.
If Regional Hegemony Is Not an Option, What Then? If China's prospects
for regional hegemony are limited, then what do the United States and
China have to fight about? Each is a vast country populated by hundreds
of millions of patriotic citizens. They have large and sophisticated
economies that no outside power could successfully strangle, powerful
conventional military forces, and second-strike nuclear capabilities. An
enormous ocean separates them, and neither side could possibly mount a
successful invasion of the other. [Coexistence is not merely desirable;
it is unavoidable.]{.underline} Yet China's leaders could still decide
to choose the same risky path that other would-be hegemons have
followed. [If they believed the regional balance of power heavily tilted
in their favor, that nearby states could be bullied into neutrality,
that one or two triumphs would render subsequent resistance impossible,
and that other states in Asia would eventually regard Chinese primacy as
legitimate, then the risks of a hegemonic bid (however ill-advised)
would rise.]{.underline} In the worst case, Chinese leaders could
convince themselves that conditions temporarily favored a bid for
regional hegemony while at the same time fearing that the balance of
power could turn against them decisively if the opportunity was not
seized. [This combination of wishful thinking and paranoia is that
textbook condition for preventive war; precisely the logic

for the United States and its Asian partners are clear. On the one hand,
they should work to
[mitigate](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691136462/unanswered-threats)
the various factors that can impede effective balancing and could lead
Beijing to erroneously conclude that a bid for hegemony might succeed.
At the same time, however, the United States and its allies need to make
it crystal clear that they not trying to threaten China's independence
or territorial integrity, undermine the authority of the Chinese
Communist Party, or crash the Chinese economy. Reassurance is needed so
that China's leaders do not conclude that they have no choice but to
pursue hegemony even if the odds of success are small. Consistent
messaging will be essential. Although recent speeches by [National
Security Advisor Jake
Sullivan](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/04/27/remarks-by-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivan-on-renewing-american-economic-leadership-at-the-brookings-institution/)

over the past three centuries, a great power concluded that its security
required it to establish a dominant position over its neighbors. All but
one of these attempts failed catastrophically. [China would be unwise to
make the attempt, but the United States and its allies would be equally
unwise if their own actions unwittingly convinced Beijing that a risky
bid for hegemony was still its best option.]{.underline}

### AT: Russia 

#### Russia is revisionist and must be contained, otherwise territorial aggressions inevitable and goes nuclear.

https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russia/putins-point-no-return\]

On August 6, 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise cross-border
offensive into Russia's Kursk region---the biggest foreign incursion
into Russian territory since World War II. Russian President Vladimir
Putin's response was telling. Days after Ukraine's offensive, [[Putin
**railed**]{.underline}]{.mark} [against the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
Europe]{.underline}. "The West is fighting us with the hands of the
Ukrainians," he said, [[reiterating]{.mark} his [view that Russia's
war]{.mark} [in Ukraine is]{.mark} in fact a **[proxy
battle]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with the West]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
he initiated no immediate military counterattack. Putin was unwilling to
divert substantial numbers of troops away from their operations in
eastern Ukraine even to recover territory back home. Three months later,
with Ukrainian forces still in Kursk, Moscow instead brought in North
Korean troops to help push them out---the first time in more than a
century that Russia has invited foreign troops onto its soil.

Moscow's actions underscore how, after almost three years since Russia's
full-scale invasion of its neighbor, [[Putin is]{.underline}]{.mark} now
more **[[committed]{.underline}]{.mark}** than ever
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the war with Ukraine and [his broader
[confrontation with]{.mark} the [West]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although
[the [conflict is]{.mark} first]{.underline} and foremost
[[an]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[imperial pursuit]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[to end Ukraine's independence,]{.underline} [Putin's ultimate
[objectives are to **relitigate**]{.mark}]{.underline} [the [post--Cold
War **order**]{.mark} in Europe,]{.underline} [[weaken]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [[and usher in]{.mark} a
**[new]{.mark} international [system]{.mark}**]{.underline} that affords
Russia the status and influence Putin believes it deserves.

These goals are not new. But [the war has hardened Putin's
resolve]{.underline} and narrowed his options. There is no turning back:
[Putin has]{.underline} already [transformed Russia's society, economy,
and foreign policy to]{.underline} better position the Kremlin to [take
on the West]{.underline}. [[Having accepted]{.mark} the [mantle of a
**rogue**]{.mark} **regime**]{.underline}, [[Russia is]{.mark} now even
[less likely to see]{.mark} a [need for constraint]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The stage is set for the **confrontation**]{.underline} with Russia [to
intensify]{.underline}, despite the incoming Trump administration's
apparent interest in normalizing relations with Moscow. The war is not
going well for Ukraine, in part because the [limited
assistance]{.underline} the West has sent to Kyiv [does not match the
deep stake it claims to have in the conflict]{.underline}. As a result,
[[Russia]{.mark} is [likely to walk away]{.mark} from the
war]{.underline} [**[emboldened]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[once it has
**reconstituted**]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline}
**[[military]{.underline}]{.mark}** capacity, [[spoiling for **another**
fight]{.mark} to revise the **security order** in
**Europe**.]{.underline} What's more, [the [Kremlin will]{.mark} look to
[pocket]{.mark} any [concessions]{.mark}]{.underline} from the Trump
administration for ending the current war, such as sanctions relief, [to
strengthen its hand]{.underline} for the next one. [[Russia
is]{.underline}]{.mark} already [[preparing]{.underline}]{.mark} the
ground [[through]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[sabotage]{.underline}
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} other [special operations it has unleashed
across Europe and through its **[alignment]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} other
**rogue actors**, including [**Iran** and **No**]{.mark}]{.underline}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea. European countries are only slightly
more prepared to handle the Russian challenge on their own than they
were three years ago. And depending on how the war in Ukraine ends, the
[[possibility of]{.mark} **another [war]{.mark}** with Russia
[looms]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The question is **not**]{.underline} [whether Russia will pose a
threat]{.underline} to the United States and its allies [but how
to]{.underline} assess the magnitude of the danger and the effort
required to **[contain]{.underline}** [it]{.underline}. China will
remain the United States' primary competitor. But even with much of its
attention called to Asia, [Washington cannot ignore a]{.underline}
recalcitrant and **[[revanchist adversary]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in
Europe]{.underline}, especially not one [that [will pose]{.mark} a
direct [**military threat** to **NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} members.

The Russian problem is also a global one. [Putin's [willingness to
**invade**]{.mark}]{.underline} a neighbor, **[assault]{.underline}**
[democratic societies, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} generally
**[[violate]{.underline}]{.mark}** accepted
**[[norms]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and his seeming ability to get away
with it---[[paves the way for others]{.mark} to do the
same]{.underline}.The [Kremlin's provision of military
equipment]{.underline} and know-how to current and aspiring U.S.
adversaries [will amplify]{.underline} these **[threats]{.underline}**,
[[multiplying]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}
that Washington will face [[from]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea, [and any other country]{.underline}
that Russia backs.

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
and Europe, therefore, [[must]{.underline}]{.mark} invest in
[[resist]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} now [or
pay a far greater cost]{.underline} later. The incoming
[Trump]{.underline} administration, in particular, [does not
have]{.underline} the [luxury of shoving]{.underline} [Russia down its
list of]{.underline} policy [priorities]{.underline}. If
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} sees Washington doing so, he [[will
grow]{.underline}]{.mark} only [[more]{.underline}
**[brazen]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
**[ambitious]{.underline}** in his efforts to weaken the United States
and its allies, both directly and through the axis of upheaval that
Russia supports. To prevent that outcome, [Washington]{.underline} and
its allies [must help Ukraine]{.underline} strengthen its position ahead
of negotiations to end the current war. The United States is right to
prioritize China, but in order to effectively compete with Beijing, it
first needs to set European security on the right path. Washington must
remain the primary enabler of that security for now, while making sure
that Europe ramps up the investments required to better handle its own
defense in the years ahead. By taking the steps necessary to counter
Russia today, the United States and Europe can ensure that the threat
they face tomorrow will be a manageable one.

IN TOO DEEP

Putin has changed Russia in ways that will ensure it remains a challenge
to the West as long as he is in power and likely well beyond.
[[Confrontation]{.mark} [is]{.mark}]{.underline} now [the]{.underline}
**[hallmark]{.underline}** [of Russia's foreign policy,
with]{.underline} [Putin citing his]{.underline} country's
"**[[existential struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [with the
West]{.underline} to justify his regime and its actions. This [[idea of
a Russian civilization]{.mark} [in]{.mark} **constant
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[West]{.mark}ern foes [strengthens]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[ideological foundation]{.underline}** [of his rule---a source of
**[legitimacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} he now needs [to safeguard his hold
on power.]{.underline}

Putin's increased reliance on repression has generated risks to the
stability of his regime. Political science research shows that
repression is effective in the sense that it increases autocrats'
longevity in office. But depending too heavily on it, as Putin has done,
can raise the prospect that leaders will make destabilizing mistakes.
Heavy-handed tactics compel people to mask their private views and avoid
sharing anything but what the government wants to hear, which means the
autocrat, too, loses access to accurate information. High levels of
repression also create a rising reservoir of general dissatisfaction, so
that [even a small outburst of discontent can quickly spiral into
trouble for the regime]{.underline}. To mitigate these risks and
reinforce his hold on power, [Putin]{.underline} has [used]{.underline}
[his control over]{.underline} the [info]{.underline}rmation environment
[to convince]{.underline} the [Russian people that their country is at
war with a West that wants to break it apart.]{.underline}

The war has hardened Putin's resolve and narrowed his options.

[[Putin]{.mark} has also **[reoriented]{.mark}** the Russian
[**economy** around]{.mark} his **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Russia's
**[[defense spending]{.underline}]{.mark}** [is]{.underline} [set to
[reach]{.mark} its **[highest point]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the
collapse of the Soviet Union, with \$145 billion allocated in the 2025
budget---[the equivalent of]{.underline} **[6.3 percent]{.underline}**
[of GDP and more than **double**]{.underline} the \$66 billion Russia
budgeted for defense in [2021]{.underline}, the year before the
invasion. And [the true amount of]{.underline} such [spending
will]{.underline} likely [be **higher**]{.underline}, possibly
[exceeding **eight percent** of GDP]{.underline}, once other, unofficial
forms of defense-related expenditures are accounted for.
([When]{.underline} also [adjusting for]{.underline} considerable
differences in [purchasing power]{.underline} parity between Russia and
the United States, [Russia's actual defense spending is]{.underline}
much higher than \$145 billion, [exceeding **\$200
billion**]{.underline}.) Russian factories producing military equipment
have added shifts to increase production; [workers]{.underline} have
[moved]{.underline} from civilian [to military sectors]{.underline},
where the wages are higher; [and payouts for military
service]{.underline} have [skyrocketed]{.underline}. [The war has become
a]{.underline} **[wealth transfer]{.underline}** [mechanism]{.underline}
channeling money to Russia's poor regions, and many economic
[[elites]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[moved into]{.mark} the
[defense]{.mark} sector]{.underline} to cash in on lucrative
opportunities. Elites have, by now, adjusted to the system's current
configuration, enabling them not just to survive but to profit from it.

Having gone through the pain of shifting the economy to a wartime
footing and feeling the pressure of new vested interests, [Putin is
unlikely to undo these changes]{.underline} quickly. After the fighting
in Ukraine ends, [he will]{.underline} probably instead [look to justify
the continuation of the wartime economy]{.underline}. Such was the
inclination of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, who, after the Allied
victory in World War II, soon began to speak of Moscow's new five-year
plans as necessary preparation for the next inevitable war.

Russian foreign policy is also transforming in ways that will be
difficult to undo. The [invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[made it]{.underline} **[impossible]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for Russia
[to build ties]{.mark} with the West]{.underline}, and Moscow has had to
look for opportunities elsewhere. [Its [deepening partnerships
wi]{.mark}th]{.underline} [**[China]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea may
[have been driven]{.underline} largely [by necessity]{.underline}:
[Russia needs their help to sustain its]{.underline} economy and
[warfighting machine]{.underline}. But Moscow also [understands that by
working with these countries, it is in a better position to
sustain]{.underline} a long-term [competition with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies. Not
only does their support make Russia less isolated and less vulnerable to
the United States' tools of economic warfare; [Russia]{.underline} also
[benefits from having]{.underline} **[cobelligerents]{.underline}**
working in tandem [to weaken the West]{.underline}. [The Kremlin has
gone all in on]{.underline} these partnerships, having abandoned caution
in [cooperating with]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea, overcome its concern with overdependence on
**[China]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} elevated relations with
**[Iran]{.underline}** beyond transactional engagement. All of this
amounts to a new strategy for Moscow, one that will not simply disappear
after the fighting in Ukraine subsides or ends.

RUSSIA RELOADS

[Russia's military threat is not going away]{.underline}, either. [The
question of Russian military reconstitution is **not an if** but a
**when**]{.underline}. Even if Russia cannot sustain its current wartime
spending, the [defense]{.underline} [budget is likely to
remain]{.underline} substantially [above prewar levels]{.underline} for
some time to come. The Russian [military]{.underline}, too, [is unlikely
to shrink]{.underline} back to the relatively small army Russia fielded
before the war. One lesson that Russia's military brass took from
Ukraine is that the Russian army was not "Soviet" enough in that it
lacked mass and the capacity to replace losses. In reality, the Russian
military was stuck in a halfway state, having acquired some advanced or
modernized capabilities but also retaining some Soviet-era
characteristics, including conscription and a culture of centralized
command that discouraged initiative. Now, [Russia is likely to maintain
a large]{.underline} overall [force]{.underline} with an expanded
structure and greater manpower allocation, although it will still depend
on mobilization in the event of war to reduce the cost of its standing
army.

Reconstitution is about not just materiel but also the capacity to
conduct large-scale combat operations.The [[Russian]{.mark} military has
shown that it can learn]{.underline} as an organization; [it is capable
of]{.underline} [[scaling]{.underline}]{.mark} the deployment of new
[tech]{.underline}nology [such as **[drones]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[electronic]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**fare systems onto the battlefield, and it
will be a changed force after its experience in Ukraine. Despite its
initial poor showing, the Russian military has demonstrated staying
power and the ability to withstand high levels of attrition.

Russia's military reconstitution will face headwinds, especially from
the country's limited defense industrial capacity and skilled labor
shortage. Russian industry has not been able to significantly scale the
production of major platforms and weapons systems. [Labor and machine
tools remain]{.underline} major [constraints]{.underline} because of
Western sanctions and export controls. [Russia has still been able
to]{.underline} significantly [[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[production of **missiles**]{.underline},
**[p]{.underline}**]{.mark}[recision-**[g]{.mark}**uided
**[w]{.mark}**eapons, [**drones**, and]{.mark} artillery
**[munitions]{.mark}**,]{.underline} and it has set up an effective
repair and refurbishment pipeline for existing equipment. [But it is
also drawing from aging stocks]{.underline} that it inherited from the
Soviet Union for much of its land force equipment. Thus, as it expands
its forces and replaces losses, it is depleting its resources.

From now on, the Russian military will have a duality to it, with areas
of strength but equally prominent weaknesses. On the one hand, it has
become much better at dynamic targeting, precision strikes, the
integration of drones in combat operations, and more sophisticated
methods of employing long-range precision-guided weapons. [Russia
has]{.underline} adapted to---and in some cases [developed effective
tactics to counter]{.underline}---the [Western capabilities]{.underline}
it confronted in Ukraine. Over time, Russian forces reorganized
logistics and command and control, coming up with ways to reduce the
efficacy of Western equipment and intercept Western munitions, and they
have learned to operate with the presence of Western long-range
precision-guided weapons, intelligence, and targeting.

[For]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**, [this ought to set off
**alarms**]{.underline}. Some analysts argue that the way Ukraine is
fighting now is not the way NATO would fight in a potential future war
with Russia.They contend specifically that NATO would quickly earn and
maintain air superiority, changing the nature of the conflict. Although
this may be true, airpower will not solve every battlefield challenge
NATO might face. And most European air forces lack munitions for a
sustained conventional war. The time it would take to deplete their
arsenals can best be measured in weeks and in many cases days.

On the other hand, a substantial percentage of the Russian ground force
will likely continue to field dated Soviet equipment, and it will take
years to rebuild force quality and replace the officers lost in
Ukraine.The outlook for Russia's defense capacity will also depend on
whether its economy is running flat out and the defense sector has
already maximized production or if there is still room for production to
increase as new and refurbished plants and facilities come online.
Overall, the Russian military will remain a patchwork, with some parts
more advanced and capable than they were at the start of 2022 and other
parts still using equipment from the middle of the Cold War, if not
earlier. But the chances of the Russian armed forces being decisively
knocked out and unable to pose a major threat for a prolonged period are
low.

A GROWING GAP

The [[risks from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[reconstitution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of Russia's military [are
[compounded by]{.mark} the West's **[lackluster]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[response]{.mark} to rising]{.underline} **[Russian
aggression]{.underline}**. Europe still has a long way to go before it
is prepared to handle the threat from Russia on its own. European
defense production is insufficient to meet rearmament goals, despite
Europe's advantages in capital, machine tools, and labor productivity.
European countries have substantially depleted their stocks by
transferring older equipment to Ukraine, limiting their militaries'
mobilization potential. These countries will soon face the dual pressure
of funding Ukraine's war effort and recovery while replacing their own
expended war materiel. Given how limited their arsenals were to begin
with, if they want to be equipped to handle Russian belligerence, they
will need to build well beyond 2022 levels---not just restore what was
lost.

Current trends suggest that [although European defense spending is
likely to rise,]{.underline} the [increases may]{.underline} [not be
enough]{.underline} to significantly expand military capability. There
are exceptions, such as Poland and the Baltic states. But many countries
with large budgets, such as Italy and Spain, are lagging behind. Many
have yet to meet the commitment made by all NATO allies to spend the
equivalent of two percent of GDP on defense. Across Europe, defense
production is constrained by industrial capacity, the slow pace of
finalizing contracts, and competing budgetary imperatives. All these
issues can be overcome with sufficient political will, but European
leaders first have to be clear-eyed in their assessment of the security
environment. The United States is not going to significantly expand its
presence in Europe; at best, Washington's commitment to European
security will remain constant as it pushes Europe to do more, and there
is a real risk that it will turn its focus elsewhere. Europe must
prepare to foot more of the bill to ensure that Ukraine is in a position
to defend itself and to deter future Russian aggression against both
Ukraine and Europe as a whole.

[American leaders]{.underline}, for their part, [will have to be
**realistic** about Europe's capabilities]{.underline}. Even those
countries that are now investing heavily in equipment and procurement
are still having issues recruiting, retaining, and training sufficient
forces. And [defense spending does not easily translate]{.underline}
[into]{.underline} the ability to conduct [large]{.underline}-scale
combat [op]{.underline}eration[s]{.underline}. Modern operations are
complex, and [European countries]{.underline} generally
**[cannot]{.underline}** [execute them **without** U.S.
support]{.underline}. [Most militaries]{.underline} on the continent
[have coevolved to **complement**]{.underline} [the U.S.
military]{.underline} rather than to operate independently.

European militaries and NATO have made some progress matching their
defense investments with the requirements of regional defense plans. But
the [forces]{.underline} active [on the continent are not capable of
handling a **large-scale war** on their own]{.underline}. They would
find it difficult to agree on who would lead such an operation and who
would provide the necessary supporting elements. [European militaries
would struggle to defend a]{.underline} fellow [NATO
member]{.underline}, or Ukraine, **[without]{.underline}** [U.S.
help]{.underline}---a dependence that Washington has, to some extent,
perpetuated. Thus, although the United States should continue to press
its European allies to take on more of the security burden, Washington
must appreciate that it will take a long time for Europe to get there.

THE RISING RISK OF WAR

Europe and the United States are not preparing for some far-off threat.
[[Moscow]{.mark} is already [waging]{.mark} an **[unconventional
war]{.mark}** against Europe]{.underline}. Within the past few years,
[suspected Russian-backed actors have [**set fire**]{.mark} to
warehouses in Germany and the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[K]{.underline}**ingdom that were [full of arms and ammunition for
Ukraine, [**tampered** with water]{.mark}]{.underline} purification
[centers in Finland, **[pushed migrants]{.mark}**]{.underline} from the
Middle East and North Africa crossing through Belarus and Russia
[to]{.underline} the borders of [Poland and Finland, **[targeted
railway]{.mark}** infrastructure in the Czech Republic and Sweden,
**[assassinated]{.mark}**]{.underline} a Russian military
[defector]{.underline} in Spain[, and even plotted to assassinate
the]{.underline} German [head of]{.underline} a major [European arms
manufacturer]{.underline}. The Kremlin's goal with these measures is to
show European governments and citizens that Russia can retaliate for
their support for Kyiv.

Yet once the war in Ukraine ends, [Russia's efforts won't
subside.]{.underline} [Moscow's broader aim in pursuing]{.underline}
[these tactics is to **degrade**]{.underline} [the West and its ability
to counter Russia]{.underline}. [It wants to **weaken** Western
societies, **drive wedges** between the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} **[Europe]{.underline}**,
[reduce Europe's capacity]{.underline} for collective action, [and
convince Europeans]{.underline} that [it's not worth]{.underline} the
trouble [to push back]{.underline} against Moscow. [Part of its strategy
is to use **[nuclear intimidation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [such
as]{.underline} the recent [changes to]{.underline} Russian [nuclear
doctrine that]{.underline} seem to [[lower]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[threshold for]{.mark} nuclear [use, to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[heighten]{.underline}** [Western]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[fears]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} [confronting
Russia.]{.underline}

The stage is set for the West's confrontation with Russia to intensify.

[Russia is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [in a position to
challenge NATO directly.]{.underline} The current [low-scale
conflict]{.underline} with NATO countries [is likely to persist until
the]{.underline} Russian [military rebuilds]{.underline}---a process
that could take years. But [the Kremlin will]{.underline} then be
[look]{.underline}ing for opportunities [to]{.underline} further
[undermine NATO]{.underline}. [[Moscow]{.mark} will still]{.underline}
[have reason for **caution**]{.underline}, not least [because it
considers the alliance to be a **superior force**]{.underline}, [but it
may be [tempted if it becomes clear]{.mark} that]{.underline} the
allies---[the]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates the most important among
them---[[lack]{.mark} the **[resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[for]{.mark} **collective [defense]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Kremlin
would be most prone to make this calculation if the United States is
engaged in a major conflict with China in the Indo-Pacific, which
Washington has deemed its highest national security priority. [Should
the Kremlin calculate that Washington would not]{.underline} or could
not [come to Europe's defense]{.underline} and that Europe alone would
not be capable of victory, [[then Moscow could **target**]{.mark} a
country on [**NATO**'s eastern flank]{.mark}, daring NATO to
respond.]{.underline}

The [picture is]{.underline} further [complicated by]{.underline} the
[[Kremlin's propensity for]{.underline}]{.mark} both
[**[risk-taking]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[miscalc]{.underline}**]{.mark}ulation. Already, [Moscow has
**seriously misjudged**]{.underline} [its ability to]{.underline}
rapidly [defeat]{.underline} the [Ukrain]{.underline}ian military
[and]{.underline} to shake [Western resolve]{.underline}. Personalist
autocrats such as [Putin are]{.underline} the type of leader most
[inclined to make **mistakes**]{.underline}, in part [because they
surround themselves with]{.underline} **[yes men]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[loyalists]{.underline}** who tell the leaders what
they want to hear. Washington and its allies should thus not sleep
comfortably even if NATO forces are well equipped to defeat the Russian
military. Having confidence that NATO would prevail in the end is not
enough, especially having observed what Ukraine is experiencing now:
cities destroyed, tens of thousands killed, millions made refugees, and
areas under prolonged Russian occupation. Even if Russia were defeated
today, a future [war with Russia could be devastating]{.underline} for
the country it invades and for the NATO alliance. [The **imperative**
for the **U**]{.underline}nited **[St]{.underline}**ates [and NATO is to
make sure Moscow **never tries.**]{.underline}

AIDING AND ABETTING

The confrontation with Russia will remain most intense in Europe, but
[the challenge from Moscow]{.underline} [is]{.underline}
**[global]{.underline}**. Although the United States and Europe levied
significant costs on Russia in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine,
Moscow has circumvented Western sanctions and export controls and defied
predictions of international isolation. In October, [Russia
hosted]{.underline} the annual summit of **[BRICS]{.underline}** (whose
first five members were Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa),
[with dozens of world leaders]{.underline} in attendance,
[demonstrating]{.underline} a growing interest in [the group's
role]{.underline} as a platform for [challenging Western
power]{.underline} and influence.

[[The more]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[clashes]{.underline}** [with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies [and is
perceived to [get away with it, the more]{.mark} other
[countries]{.mark} will be]{.underline} [**[emboldened]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} issue **[[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}**s of
their own. Russia's war in Ukraine is exposing not only a gap between
the West's rhetoric and its practical commitment but also the limits of
Western military capacity. This is not to say that a seeming Russian
success in Ukraine would automatically prompt Chinese leader Xi Jinping
to invade Taiwan; other factors, such as the military balance of power
in the region and political imperatives in Beijing, will be more
decisive in shaping Xi's calculus. Yet [**[China]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[taking notes]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [as are
onlookers]{.underline} around the world. Would-be Western [adversaries
are assessing the price of]{.underline} using [force]{.underline} and
considering what they might expect were they to launch a similar gambit.
Likewise, the **[inadequate response]{.underline}** [to
Russia]{.underline}n sabotage in Europe [might encourage
other]{.underline} potential [foes]{.underline} to get in the game.

Not content to simply inspire, [Moscow is]{.underline} also actively
[aiding opponents]{.underline} of the West. Russia [has]{.underline}
[lent support to **rogue actors**]{.underline} across the Sahel region
[of Africa]{.underline}, dispensing materiel and diplomatic backing that
enabled military officials to forcibly seize power in Mali in 2021, in
Burkina Faso in 2022, and in Niger in 2023 and subsequently curtail ties
with the United States and Europe. Russia is also sending arms into
Sudan, prolonging the country's civil war and the resulting humanitarian
crisis, [and has lent support to the Houthi]{.underline} militias in
Yemen, who have attacked vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting global
trade, and have fired missiles at Israel, a close U.S. ally.

Although the consequences for the United States of any one of these
developments may be limited, in aggregate, [Russia's actions are
magnifying]{.underline} the [challenges]{.underline} facing Washington.
[In Niger,]{.underline} [Russian support eased the]{.underline} new
[government's decision to force the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to abandon a
base]{.underline} it used to launch counterterrorism missions in the
Sahel. [If Russia were to ramp up]{.underline} its [support]{.underline}
[for the Houthis]{.underline} and provide them with antiship missiles,
[the]{.underline} militant [group would be better able to]{.underline}
[strike]{.underline} commercial [vessels]{.underline} in the Red Sea
[and raise the threat to]{.underline} the U.S. and European
**[warships]{.underline}** defending them. Once the fighting in Ukraine
ends, Russia could devote significantly more resources and attention to
the Houthis and other groups or countries that threaten U.S. interests.

Some observers have held out hope that China's concern for its economic
interests will induce it to rein in Russia. But Beijing's actions so far
indicate no such effort. China did not object to Russia's support for
the Houthis, despite the risks to global shipping. Even if Beijing is
wary of Russia's deepening relations with North Korea, it is unlikely to
intervene, not least because it does not want to spoil its long-standing
relationship with Pyongyang. Instead, China seems content to let Russia
roil the international system and take advantage of the resulting
disorder to further its own rise. If there is to be any check on
Russia's destabilizing activities, then, it will have to come from the
West.

THE AXIS OF UPHEAVAL

[Russia's effort to support **China**]{.underline},
**[Iran]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [is among the most pernicious
problems]{.underline} posed by Moscow. Russia's war in
[Ukraine]{.underline} has [spurred]{.underline} a level of
**[coop]{.underline}**eration among those countries that few thought was
possible, and the Kremlin has operated as the critical catalyst. The
arrival of North Korean troops in Russia is a worrisome reminder that
[with]{.underline} highly personalized [authoritarian regimes at the
helm in]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}** and
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea and with the regimes in
**[China]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} to a lesser extent
**[Iran]{.underline}** moving in this direction,
**[coop]{.underline}**eration [can evolve rapidly]{.underline} and in
unpredictable ways.

A body of political science research shows that [this]{.underline}
particular [type of regime tends to produce the **most risky** and
**aggressive** foreign policies]{.underline}. [Countries
with]{.underline} personalist **[[authoritarians]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[at the helm are]{.underline} the [[most likely to
initiate]{.underline}]{.mark} **[interstate
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the most likely to **[[fight
wars]{.underline}]{.mark}** [against democracies, and]{.underline} the
most likely to [[invest in]{.underline}
**[nuc]{.underline}**]{.mark}lear weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Russia's]{.underline} growing military and political
[support]{.underline} for China, Iran, and North Korea
[will]{.underline} only [facilitate these tendencies]{.underline}. And
[Moscow]{.underline}, by now having shed its concern with its
international reputation, [is likely to become]{.underline} even [less
constrained]{.underline} in its willingness to aid even the most odious
of regimes.

[[Russian]{.mark} support]{.underline} for fellow members of this axis
of upheaval, therefore, [could [bring **disorder** to
**key**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[regions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Take the
[Chinese-Russian]{.underline} relationship. Although Moscow has supplied
Beijing with arms for years---including advanced fighter aircraft, air
defense systems, and antiship missiles---their [defense ties have
deepened]{.underline} at an alarming rate. In September, for example,
U.S. officials announced that [Russia]{.underline} had [provided China
with sophisticated tech]{.underline}nology that will make Chinese
submarines quieter and more difficult to track. Such an agreement was
hard to imagine just a few years ago, given the sensitive nature of the
technology. With Beijing and Moscow working together, the [U.S. military
advantage]{.underline} over China [could erode,
[making]{.mark}]{.underline} a potential [**[conflict]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[Indo-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}** [more
[likely]{.mark}]{.underline} if China believes it has the upper hand.

The costs of resisting Russia will only rise.

[[Russia's support for Iran is]{.underline}]{.mark} similarly
[[troubling]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Moscow]{.mark} has]{.underline} long
[[sent]{.underline} **[tanks]{.underline}**,
**[helicopters]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} [surface-to-air
**[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline} to Tehran, [and]{.underline} it [is
now supporting]{.underline} the Iranian space and [missile
programs]{.underline}. Since Russia's intervention in Syria in 2015 to
shore up the rule of President Bashar al-Assad---joining Iran in that
effort---Moscow and Tehran's increased interaction has enabled them to
overcome a historic distrust and build the foundations of a deeper and
more durable partnership. A decade ago, Russia participated (if warily)
in the international negotiations that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear
deal. But today, Moscow seems far less interested in arms reduction or
nonproliferation. As the wars in the Middle East degrade Iran's proxies
and expose the limits of its ability to deter Israel, [[Tehran's
interest in acquiring a **nuc**]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon [may
grow]{.underline}---and [it [may turn to Russia]{.mark} for
help.]{.underline} That help could be overt, [with Moscow
offering]{.underline} the **[expertise]{.underline}** needed for weapon
miniaturization, for example, [or]{.underline} it could be indirect,
with Russia [shielding Tehran from UN action]{.underline}. [[Iran's
acquisition]{.mark} of a]{.underline} **[nuc]{.underline}**lear weapon,
in turn, [could [send]{.mark} other countries in the region, such as
**[Egypt]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[[Saudi]{.mark}
Arabia]{.underline}**, **[[scrambling]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[to]{.underline} **[nuclearize]{.underline}**, effectively
**[[ending]{.underline}]{.mark}** the current era of
**[[nonprolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration [in the Middle
East.]{.underline}

In the case of North Korea, [Russia]{.underline}'s support
[raises]{.underline} the [risk of **instability**]{.underline} [on
the]{.underline} Korean [Peninsula]{.underline}. According to South
Korean officials, [Pyongyang]{.underline} has [requested advanced
Russian tech]{.underline}nologies [to]{.underline} [improve]{.underline}
the accuracy of its [ballistic missiles and]{.underline} to expand the
range of its [sub]{.underline}marine[s]{.underline} in return for North
Korea sending its troops, ammunition, and other military support to
Russia. And it is not just advanced equipment that [[could
make]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth
**[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea [more]{.underline}
**[able]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}, perhaps, more
**[willing]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [[engage in]{.mark} a
**regional [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. North Korean [troops
deployed to Russia are]{.underline} now [gaining]{.underline} valuable
[battlefield experience]{.underline} and insight into modern conflict.
[Moscow and Pyongyang]{.underline} also [signed]{.underline} a treaty in
November establishing a "comprehensive [strategic
partnership]{.underline}" and [calling on each side]{.underline} [to
come to the other's aid]{.underline} in case of an armed attack---[an
agreement that could]{.underline} potentially [bring]{.underline}
[Russia into a fight between]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [and]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea.

[It is **tempting**]{.underline} [to imagine that if the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates presses Ukraine to end
the war and [pursues a]{.underline} more **[pragmatic
relationship]{.underline}** [with Russia, Moscow's]{.underline}
cooperation with members of this **[axis]{.underline}** [could
lessen.]{.underline} Yet [this is **wishful thinking**]{.underline}. The
[growing ties]{.underline} among China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia
[are driven by incentives]{.underline} far [deeper than]{.underline} the
[transactional considerations]{.underline} created by the war in
Ukraine. If anything, **[[concessions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [made to
Russia]{.underline} to end the war would only
**[[enhance]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the [Kremlin's ability to]{.mark}
help its partners [weaken]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

ORDER OF OPERATIONS

**[Russian ambitions]{.underline}** [may **not**]{.underline} [stop at
Ukraine]{.underline}, and [in the absence of Western action]{.underline}
today, the **[costs]{.underline}** [of resisting]{.underline} Russian
aggression will only [rise]{.underline}. [Russia is a **declining
power**]{.underline}, [but its potential]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[stir conflict]{.underline}** [remains]{.underline} significant. Thus,
the [burden of]{.underline} **[deterrence]{.underline}** [and
**defense**]{.underline} against it [is **not**]{.underline} [going to
lighten]{.underline} in the near term. And because changes to defense
spending, procurement, and force posture require significant lead times,
[Washington]{.underline} and its allies [must]{.underline} think beyond
the current war in Ukraine and [start]{.underline} making
[investments]{.underline} now [to prevent]{.underline}
[Russian]{.underline} opportunistic **[aggression]{.underline}** later
on. Europe must channel its rising defense spending into expanding the
organizational capacity and logistical support necessary to make
independent action possible if the U.S. military is engaged elsewhere.
[Giving in to Russia's demands will not make it any easier]{.underline}
or cheaper [to defend Europe]{.underline}---just look at the events of
the past two decades. At every turn---the war in Georgia in 2008,
Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, and its deployment of troops
to Syria in 2015---[Putin has grown]{.underline} only [more
**willing**]{.underline} [to take risks]{.underline} as he comes to
believe that doing so pays off.

Washington undoubtedly has competing priorities that will shift its
focus away from the Russian threat---China foremost among them. But
[to]{.underline} effectively [address China, Washington
must]{.underline} first [set European security on the right
path.]{.underline} The United States cannot simply hand off European
security to a Europe that is not yet capable of managing the Russian
threat. [If Washington downsized its]{.underline} [commitment to
Europe]{.underline} prematurely, [Moscow could take it as a sign of
growing U.]{.underline}S. **[disinterest]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} use the opportunity to [press ahead]{.underline}.

The prioritization of U.S. policies is important, but so is the
sequencing. The Trump administration will first have to manage the war
in Ukraine. Helping Ukraine achieve an end to the war on favorable terms
is the clearest way to reduce the threat of aggression from Russia and
the axis of upheaval that supports it. This agreement would need to be
embedded in a larger strategy to contain Russia and preserve Ukrainian
security. NATO should do away with the 1997 NATO-Russia Founding Act,
which prohibits permanent deployments of allied forces near Russia, and
station troops on NATO's eastern flank. The alliance should also raise
its members' defense spending targets, increase its readiness, and
improve its ability to deploy forces to defend threatened member states.
Western countries should maintain and better enforce sanctions and
export controls on Russia for at least as long as Putin remains in
power. Western countries must also invest in Ukraine's defense sector
and ensure that Ukraine can sustain its own armed forces to deter Russia
from invading again. Although these measures would not end the
confrontation with Russia, they would blunt Moscow's ambitions and its
capacity to both stir conflict in Europe and strengthen its partners in
other parts of the world.

The Trump administration must also preserve the United States' role as
the primary enabler of European security while working to reduce the
burden of its maintenance. European states must become more capable of
collective action that does not require U.S. aid. They may still rely on
the United States in some circumstances, but the extent of their
dependence can be significantly reduced. Over time, the United States
will become freer to focus on China as it shifts more defense
responsibilities to Europe. And in the meantime, it will avoid an overly
hasty, chaotic [pivot]{.underline} that [would]{.underline} only
encourage and **[embolden]{.underline}** [Moscow and could result in
Russia]{.underline} eventually [launching a]{.underline} **[reckless
war]{.underline}**, either [against]{.underline} **[NATO]{.underline}**
or once again against Ukraine.

There is no easy resolution to the West's confrontation with Russia.
[[Russian]{.underline} **[revisionism]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} **[aggression]{.underline}** [[are not going
away]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even if the current war in Ukraine is settled
via an armistice, without some kind of security guarantee for Ukraine,
another war is likely. [Ignoring Russia]{.underline} or assuming that it
can be easily managed as the United States turns its attention to China
[would]{.underline} only [allow the threat to grow. It would
be]{.underline} far [better for the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and its allies [to
take the challenge from Russia seriously]{.underline} today [than to let
another **conflict** become a more costly]{.underline} proposition
tomorrow.

drove]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**formation** of the [axis with
**No**]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea [and **Iran**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Moscow received large shipments of important weapons and munitions from
both countries, and more than 10,000 North Korean troops are fighting
and dying to help retake Russian land in the Kursk region.

Early this year, both [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and Ukraine [[will
seek]{.underline}]{.mark} leverage in future talks and be more willing
to take risks. That means [[more]{.mark} intense **[missile]{.mark}**
and **[drone]{.mark}** strike**[s]{.mark}** on]{.underline} each other's
territory, heavy fighting at the front lines, [[and
**assassination**]{.mark} attempt**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} by both
sides targeting elites. The [[dynamic will be
**escalatory**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Against this backdrop, President-elect Donald Trump is likely to achieve
his long-sought ceasefire in the war later in 2025. He wants the
fighting stopped, regardless of EU efforts to assume more of the war's
costs. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs a halt to the
fighting because Ukraine is slowly losing the war. Trump's pressure for
a ceasefire would ease the potential political fallout of the unpopular
move because Zelensky could argue that the US president forced him to
accept it. Meanwhile, Putin's army is advancing on the battlefield, and
he will be a harder sell on a ceasefire. But after 600,000 casualties
and three years of sanctions, Russia has its own looming manpower and
economic problems, and Putin will agree in part as an investment in his
relationship with Trump.

The ceasefire terms will freeze forces in place and leave Russia in de
facto control of conquered territory---a major concession to Russia. The
deal will at most "fudge" the issue of Ukraine's relationship with NATO
so that each side can claim a win, though reality will be clear:
Ukraine's membership can occur only in the distant future, if ever. But
while a halt to the fighting is likely, a peace agreement is not. Russia
will still want regime change in Kyiv and Ukraine to formally cede
territory. Ukraine will plan to live for another day when it can retake
territory. Both sides will rearm, and sporadic fighting will continue
along the line of control. The fragile ceasefire will probably continue
through this year, but not much longer.

The [ceasefire **risks** undermining]{.underline} the post-war [European
security architecture, [leaving]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**continent**
exposed to]{.mark} renewed **Russian [attacks]{.mark}**---[on Ukraine
and **beyond**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[Nordics]{.underline}]{.mark},
the **[[Baltic]{.underline}]{.mark}**
countrie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and Poland]{.mark} see Russia
as]{.underline} an [**existential** threat and will [use
all]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[resources]{.mark} they can to support a
**Ukrainian** military buildup]{.underline} during the ceasefire.
[[**France**, **Germany**, **Italy**, and others
will]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [[follow]{.underline}]{.mark} the more
[hawkish [European]{.mark} countries'
**[lead]{.mark}**]{.underline}---supporting the deal while also seeking
to provide security guarantees to Ukraine and bolster Ukrainian and EU
defenses. All EU members and the UK are likely to hold off on
considering sanctions relief---in line with the likely US position,
tying the removal of restrictive measures to progress in peace talks.
The Europeans will also maintain the freeze on Russian assets, since the
ceasefire won't deal with reparations.

[Also **relevant** to Russian ambitions is Trump's **[transactional
approach]{.mark}**]{.underline} toward NATO, [which [will]{.mark}
weaken]{.underline} the [alliance and **[embolden
Putin]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While Trump will not attempt to withdraw
from NATO, the credibility of Article 5 security guarantees will depend
on individual countries' compliance with Trump's demands to increase
defense spending and reduce their bilateral trade surpluses with the US.
Trump will keep key military assets in Europe but will pull back US
troops from deployment rotations, including expensive ones in Eastern
Europe---exposing frontline countries.

In response, [[**Moscow** will continue]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[**rogue policies** toward]{.mark} those countries in [the
West]{.mark}]{.underline} that directly oppose it. Before the ceasefire,
[[that means]{.underline}]{.mark} ongoing [[**efforts** to
**intimidate** EU]{.mark} countries]{.underline}. After the cessation of
the fighting, Russia will be in a somewhat stronger position relative to
both Ukraine and NATO---having achieved at least some of its territorial
goals. But [EU]{.underline} countries [and **Russia** will still pursue
**hostile** diplomatic and security policies]{.underline} toward one
another, knowing that a peace agreement is beyond reach and that the
ceasefire is tenuous and unlikely to last. The optics of US-Russia
policy will improve because of the Trump-Putin relationship, but little
else in the geopolitics will change.

As a result, throughout the year, [[Russia will **interfere**
in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [domestic politics of [countries it sees as
adversarial, pursuing]{.mark}]{.underline} tactics like those it used in
Romania last November, where it [deployed [**cyber** and
**other**]{.mark} tool**[s]{.mark}** to]{.underline} materially
[influence]{.underline} the outcome of a [presidential
**election**]{.underline}. In addition, Moscow will very likely target
undersea cables; for example, the Russian shadow fleet tanker Eagle S
may well have cut a cable off Finland in the Baltic Sea. Moscow will
continue attempts at arson and even assassination and meddle with GPS
systems at airports. Moreover, it will continue to use Telegram to
instill pro-Kremlin views in citizens of European countries and turn
them against their own governments.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said last December that Moscow was
"preparing for long-term confrontation with Ukraine and with us." No
other country in the world is doing more to directly subvert the global
order than Russia[. [In **2025**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, its [efforts
will **intensify**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Ukraine's Expense Will Not Bring Peace,"

[[Russia's]{.underline} **[strategic culture]{.underline}** [is composed
of]{.underline} **[authoritarian]{.underline}**]{.mark} [norms, beliefs,
and [values]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [underpinned by]{.underline}]{.mark}
historical resentment and **[[revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
views relations]{.underline}]{.mark} with other countries [[as
a]{.underline} **[zero-sum game]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in
which]{.underline} the [limits]{.underline} of what is permissible [are
[determined]{.mark}]{.underline} **[only]{.underline}**
[[by]{.underline}]{.mark} (the balance of) [[power]{.underline}]{.mark}.

It would be true to say that there has never been a democracy in Russia.
The game of democracy (with its peculiarities) was necessary for Russian
leaders to convince Western countries that rapprochement with Russia was
not a threat. It is difficult to say whether perceptual blindness or a
choice in favor of [promising]{.underline} energy
[cooperation]{.underline} was more prevalent in Western countries'
assessments of Russia's behavior and intentions, but it [gave
[Moscow]{.mark} the opportunity to change]{.underline} the political
reality in [the]{.underline} European [security space]{.underline} step
by step, first [by]{.underline} **[[discrediting]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and reducing the authority of soft security
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the Council of Europe and
the OSCE and then by **[[violating]{.underline}]{.mark}** the principle
of [[territorial integrity and]{.underline}
**[unleashing]{.underline}**]{.mark} a full-scale
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Another prerequisite for the success of Russian foreign policy on the
European security direction is that Western countries preferred to adapt
to the new political and security environment created by Russia without
changing their approaches to security. The inertia of the defense policy
paradigms of some Western countries was stronger than the shock of
Russia's occupation and annexation of Crimea and even the outbreak of a
full-scale war in Europe.

Even today, NATO member states have different perceptions of the threats
posed by Russia, some of which do not consider its actions to be a
direct threat to their territorial integrity and security. This
differentiation in assessing threats and risks affects NATO's defense
capabilities and creates an atmosphere of uncertainty about the security
guarantees of NATO member states. After all, even the famous Article 5
of the treaty is limited in assisting the attacked Party by outlining
that NATO should take "such action as it deems necessary, including the
use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North
Atlantic area."

Despite statements by Western leaders about their strong intentions to
protect the security of the Euro-Atlantic area, the difference in
defense policy paradigms among NATO member states creates uncertainty
about what response NATO Allies would consider appropriate to an act of
aggression against one of them. It is also unclear whether protecting
the security of the Euro-Atlantic area includes protecting the
territorial integrity of NATO member states. Russia also does not know
this yet and wants to eliminate this uncertainty.

Of the four possible scenarios for stopping the war between Russia and
Ukraine analyzed by John Lough in the Chatham House Briefing Report,
three, the "Long War," the "Frozen Conflict," and the "Defeat for
Ukraine," are winning for Russia. The shock of Russia's actions has
already worn off, and people are getting used to the current political
reality. Since some NATO member states do not see the very existence of
the Russian political regime as a threat to them, they may look for ways
to return to full partnership with Russia and may likely discuss
Russia's conditions for creating a new buffer zone in Central and
Eastern Europe. At the same time, there should be no mistaking the
meaning of neutrality or a "buffer zone" of any kind between Russia and
the old NATO member states. Any buffer security space will be seen by
Russia as an opportunity to expand its zone of control.

Other NATO countries will look for additional opportunities to
strengthen their own security by concluding additional treaties, such as
the Trinity House Agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and
Germany. Differences in assessments of external threats among NATO
allies, coupled with a possible decline in US involvement in European
security, will create tensions within the Alliance and reduce the
already unclear level of joint commitments. In such circumstances,
Russia, together with its allies, may decide to launch a direct
aggression against a NATO member to confirm the inoperability of the
Euro-Atlantic security architecture and create a new political reality
in Europe on Russia's terms.

Conditions for Lasting Truce

Apparently, Putin believes that Russia is close to a strategic
breakthrough in the war with Ukraine and in its confrontation with the
West and, therefore, is not interested in ending the war. The model of
limited deterrence of Russia chosen by the West proved ineffective and
gave Russian authorities time to adapt to the new conditions.
Predictions of Russia's economic and technological collapse due to
limited sanction pressure proved irrelevant. The Russian economy has
adaprted, and it is now dependent on the war while simultaneously being
the basis for waging war. The war has also become a necessary condition
for the domestic political stability of the Russian regime.

[[Russia is waging a war of]{.underline}
**[attrition]{.underline}**]{.mark} in which cheap resources and cheap,
mass-produced technology are crucial. China's support is also an
important element of Russia's resilience. While formally remaining in
the shadows, China is supporting Russia politically, economically, and
technologically in the war against Ukraine (in fact, against the West)
and is studying the conventional experience of this war and the
possibilities of adapting to sanctions. The successes Russia is
achieving are beneficial to China. To a certain extent, Beijing views
Russia as a proxy in its rivalry with the United States because, in the
Sino-Russian tandem, Russia does all the "dirty work" and takes all the
risks in confronting the West.

[The]{.underline} [**[only way]{.underline}** [to stop
Russia]{.underline}'s]{.mark} war against Ukraine and achieve lasting
peace [[is]{.mark} to]{.underline} make this war unprofitable and
dangerous for the Russian political regime or to
[**[weaken]{.underline}** [Russia so]{.underline}]{.mark}
[much]{.underline} that [[it will be]{.underline}
**[unable]{.underline}** [to wage war]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[Kremlin will see]{.underline}]{.mark} all other
**[[compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}** options [[as]{.mark} intermediate
[achievements]{.mark} in]{.underline} the war with the West
[[and]{.mark} will be [convert]{.mark}ed in[to]{.mark}]{.underline} an
**[[escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the confrontation.

Today, it is hardly possible to talk about a lasting peace in the war
Russia is waging. The prospect of [**[peace]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[only]{.underline}** [possible
if]{.underline}]{.mark} [Russia]{.underline} itself
[undergoes]{.underline} internal [transformations]{.underline}. At the
same time, in the short term, states can discuss a lasting truce,
[provided that [the West]{.mark}]{.underline} **[abandons]{.underline}**
its comfortable [anti-escalation strategy and
[adopts]{.mark}]{.underline} a strategy of **[[forceful
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline}
**[depowering]{.underline}** [Russia]{.underline}.

Most discussions about how to stop this war center on the compromise
that Ukraine could make. Instead, the discussion should primarily be
about how to stop Russia. Western policy toward Russia today is aimed at
minimizing the risk of escalation. It is limited by the strategic
dilemma of "not letting Russia win, but not letting Russia fall" and
constrained by the narratives that Russians themselves spread. For
example, the [prospect of]{.underline} **[weakening]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[destabilizing]{.underline}** [Russia
has]{.underline} traditionally [been rejected]{.underline} by the West
[because of]{.underline} the [risks]{.underline} associated with nuclear
weapons. Thus, from the point of view of nuclear security, the stability
of the Russian authoritarian regime is considered beneficial and
necessary despite the destructive actions of this regime.
[Russia]{.underline}n authorities also skillfully [use]{.underline}
**[nuclear]{.underline}**-related [concerns to contain the
West]{.underline}, such as in its military support for Ukraine, and
promote the narrative that the West is to blame for the increased risks
of a nuclear confrontation.

Another narrative that narrows the West's policy options toward Russia
is spread by the so-called Russian opposition in exile and claims that
Russia can be transformed into a liberal democratic state while
maintaining its territorial integrity. At the same time, critics of this
idea say that because Russia is not a homogeneous nation-state,
successful liberalization will inevitably lead to the decolonization of
Russia---to its disintegration, which, as the experience of the collapse
of the Soviet Union shows, can have many stakeholders, be controlled,
and carry minimal risks. An argument in favor of the impossibility of
liberalizing Russia without a radical transformation is that Russian
society has no successful liberal democratic experience, and all
attempts at partial liberalization in Russia have led to a loss of
political control, protest movements, and, as a result, a return to
authoritarianism. Authoritarian Russia pursues an aggressive foreign
policy and launches wars as soon as it has sufficient resources to do
so. A weak Russia does not wage war.

At present, [[Russia is]{.underline}]{.mark} more effectively
[[using]{.mark} the [war]{.mark}]{.underline} with Ukraine
[[to]{.underline} **[destroy]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
Euro-Atlantic [[security architecture]{.underline}]{.mark} than the West
is using Ukraine to contain Russia. The Kremlin has enough resources to
wage war, both human and financial. A sociological study by the Center
for Analysis and Strategies in Europe shows that the Russian government
has enough human resources to fight a war for the next few years without
declaring mobilization. The analysis of the state and processes in the
Russian economy also demonstrates the ability to meet war needs for the
next few years. In a war of attrition, Ukraine is depleting faster than
Russia, but there is still time and opportunity to change the strategy
and stop Russia. To achieve, if not a lasting peace, then at least a
lasting truce, [[it is necessary]{.underline}]{.mark} not only to arm
Ukraine sufficiently and remove all political reservations on the use of
the provided weapons on Russian territory but also to [move [to]{.mark}
a policy of]{.underline} **[complete]{.underline}** economic
**[[isolat]{.mark}ion]{.underline}** [of [Russia]{.mark} by the
West]{.underline}, and most importantly, to stop the flow of oil and gas
revenues, which is the main resource for waging war and sustaining
Russian authoritarianism.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[shouldn't manage]{.mark} the [competition with China**; it should

up]{.mark} its [conventional forces]{.mark} faster than any country has
since World War II. These actions show that China isn't aiming for a
stalemate. Neither should America.]{.underline}

What would winning look like? China's communist rulers would give up
trying to prevail in a hot or cold conflict with the United States and
its friends. And the Chinese people---from ruling elites to everyday
citizens---would find inspiration to explore new models of development
and governance that don't rely on repression at home and compulsive
hostility abroad.

In addition to having greater clarity about its end goal, the United
States needs to accept that achieving it will require greater friction
in U.S.-Chinese relations. [[Washington]{.mark} will [need]{.mark} to
adopt rhetoric and [policies that]{.mark} may feel uncomfortably
confrontational but in fact are necessary to [reestablish
boundaries]{.mark} that Beijing and its acolytes are
violating.]{.underline} That means imposing costs on Chinese leader Xi
Jinping for his policy of fostering global chaos. It means speaking with
candor about the ways China is hurting U.S. interests. It means rapidly
increasing U.S. defense capabilities to achieve unmistakable qualitative
advantages over Beijing. It means severing China's access to Western
technology and frustrating Xi's efforts to convert his country's wealth
into military power. And it means pursuing intensive diplomacy with
Beijing only from a position of American strength, as perceived by both
Washington and Beijing.

No country should relish waging another cold war. Yet a [[cold war is
already being waged]{.mark} against the United States [by China's
leaders. Rather than denying]{.mark} the existence of this [struggle,
Washington should own it]{.mark} and win it. [Lukewarm
statements]{.mark} that pretend as if there is no cold war perversely
[court]{.mark} a **[hot war]{.mark}**; they **[signal
complacency]{.mark}** to the American people and conciliation to Chinese
leaders]{.underline}. Like the original Cold War, the new cold war will
not be won through half measures or timid rhetoric. Victory requires
openly admitting that [a **[totalitarian regime]{.mark}** that
**[commits genocide, fuels conflict]{.mark}**, and **[threatens
war]{.mark}** will never be a reliable partner.]{.underline} Like the
discredited détente policies that Washington adopted in the 1970s to
deal with the Soviet Union, the current approach will yield little
cooperation from Chinese leaders while fortifying their conviction that
they can destabilize the world with impunity.

BIDEN'S NEW BASELINE

The administration's China policy initially showed promise. President
Joe Biden maintained the tariffs that President Donald Trump had imposed
on Chinese exports in response to the rampant theft of U.S. intellectual
property. He renewed, with some adjustments, the executive orders Trump
had issued to restrict investment in certain companies affiliated with
the Chinese military and to block the import of Chinese technologies
deemed a national security threat. In a particularly important step, in
October 2022, Biden significantly expanded the Trump administration's
controls on the export of high-end semiconductors and the equipment used
to make them, slowing Beijing's plans to dominate the manufacturing of
advanced microchips. Across Asia, Biden's diplomats pulled longtime
allies and newer partners closer together. They organized the first
summits of the Quad, or Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, bringing
together the leaders of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States,
and convened high-profile trilateral summits with the leaders of Japan
and South Korea. Biden also unveiled AUKUS, a defense pact among
Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

As it turned out, however, aggression would come from the opposite
direction, in Europe. Less than three weeks before invading Ukraine,
Russian President Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[signed
a]{.mark} "no limits" [security pact with Xi]{.mark} in
Beijing.]{.underline} In a prudent step after the invasion, Biden drew a
redline by warning Xi in a video call that the U.S. government would
impose sweeping sanctions if China provided "material support" to
Moscow. [[Xi]{.mark} nonetheless [found]{.mark} plenty of [ways to
support]{.mark} the **[Russian war machine,]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[sending semiconductors, unarmed drones, gunpowder, and other wares.
China also supplied Moscow with badly needed money in exchange for major
shipments of Russian oil. Chinese officials]{.underline}, according to
the U.S. State Department, [even spent more money on pro-Russian
propaganda worldwide than Russia itself was spending.]{.underline}

[Beijing was also [coordinating]{.mark} more closely [with Iran and
No]{.mark}]{.underline}rth [[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea[, even [as those
regimes sent]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark} to help Moscow wage war in
Europe.]{.underline} Yet Washington was pursuing siloed
policies---simultaneously resisting Russia, appeasing Iran, containing
North Korea, and pursuing a mix of rivalry and engagement with
China---that added up to something manifestly incoherent. Indeed, the
situation that Xi had forecast at the start of the Biden administration
was becoming a reality: "The most important characteristic of the world
is, in a word, 'chaos,' and this trend appears likely to continue," Xi
told a seminar of high-level Communist Party officials in January 2021.
Xi made clear that this was a useful development for China. "The times
and trends are on our side," he said, adding, "Overall, the
opportunities outweigh the challenges." By March 2023, Xi had revealed
that he saw himself not just as a beneficiary of worldwide turmoil but
also as one of its architects. "Right now, there are changes, the likes
of which we haven't seen for 100 years," he said to Putin on camera
while wrapping up a visit to the Kremlin. "And we are the ones driving
these changes together."

If ever the time was ripe to call out Beijing for fomenting chaos and to
start systematically imposing costs on the country in response, it was
early 2023. Biden, inexplicably, was doing the opposite. On February 1,
residents of Montana spotted a massive, white sphere drifting eastward.
The administration was already tracking the Chinese spy balloon but had
been planning to let it pass overhead without notifying the public.
Under political pressure, Biden ordered the balloon shot down once it
reached the Atlantic Ocean, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken
postponed a scheduled trip to Beijing to protest the intrusion. Press
reports suggested the administration had kept quiet about the balloon in
order to gather intelligence about it. But a troubling pattern of
downplaying affronts by Beijing would persist in other contexts.

In June 2023, leaks to the press revealed that Beijing, in a remarkable
echo of the Cold War, was planning to build a joint military training
base in Cuba and had already developed a signals intelligence facility
there targeting the United States. After a National Security Council
spokesperson called reports about the spy facility inaccurate, a White
House official speaking anonymously to the press minimized them by
suggesting that Chinese spying from Cuba was "not a new development."
The administration also greeted with a shrug new evidence suggesting
that COVID-19 may have initially spread after it accidentally leaked
from a Chinese laboratory. If the virus, which has led to the deaths of
an estimated 27 million people worldwide, turns out to have been
artificially enhanced before it escaped, the revelation would mark a
turning point in human history on par with the advent of nuclear
weapons---a situation that already cries out for U.S. leadership to
govern dangerous biological research worldwide.

In the spring of 2023, as Beijing's actions grew bolder, Biden initiated
what the White House termed an "all hands on deck" diplomatic
campaign---not to impose costs on Beijing but to flatter it by
dispatching five cabinet-level U.S. officials to China from May to
August. Blinken's June meeting with Xi symbolized the dynamic. Whereas
Xi had sat amiably alongside the billionaire Bill Gates just days
earlier, the U.S. secretary of state was seated off to the side as Xi
held forth from the head of a table at the Great Hall of the People. For
the first time in years, Xi appeared to have successfully positioned the
United States as supplicant in the bilateral relationship.

What did the United States get in return for all this diplomacy? In the
Biden administration's tally, the benefits included a promise by Beijing
to resume military-to-military talks (which Beijing had unilaterally
suspended), a new dialogue on the responsible use of artificial
intelligence (technology that Beijing is already weaponizing against the
American people by spreading fake images and other propaganda on social
media), and tentative cooperation to stem the flood of precursor
chemicals fueling the fentanyl crisis in the United States (chemicals
that are supplied mainly by Chinese companies).

Any doubts that Xi saw the American posture as one of weakness were
dispelled after Hamas's October 7 massacre in Israel. Beijing exploited
the attack by serving up endless anti-Israeli and anti-American
propaganda through TikTok, whose algorithms are subject to control by
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Chinese diplomats, like Russian ones,
met with Hamas's leaders and provided diplomatic cover for the terrorist
group, vetoing UN Security Council resolutions that would have condemned
Hamas. And there is little sign Beijing has done anything, despite
Washington's requests, to help rein in attacks carried out by the
Houthis on commercial vessels and U.S. warships in the Red Sea---attacks
conducted by the Yemeni rebel group using Iranian missiles, including
ones with technology pioneered by China. (Chinese ships, unsurprisingly,
are usually granted free passage through the kill zone.)

Whether Xi is acting opportunistically or according to a grand
design---or, almost certainly, both---it is clear he sees advantage in
stoking crises that he hopes will exhaust the United States and its
allies. In a sobering Oval Office address in mid-October, Biden seemed
to grasp the severity of the situation. "We're facing an inflection
point in history---one of those moments where the decisions we make
today are going to determine the future for decades to come," he said.
Yet bizarrely---indeed, provocatively---he made no mention of China, the
chief sponsor of the aggressors he did call out in the speech: Iran,
North Korea, and Russia. Through omission, Biden gave Beijing a pass.

THAT '70S SHOW

The current moment bears an uncanny resemblance to the 1970s. The Soviet
Union was undermining U.S. interests across the world, offering no
warning of its ally Egypt's 1973 surprise attack on Israel; aiding
communists in Angola, Portugal, and Vietnam; and rapidly expanding its
nuclear arsenal and investing heavily in its conventional military.
These were the bitter fruits of détente---a set of policies pioneered by
President Richard Nixon and his top foreign policy adviser, Henry
Kissinger, who stayed on and continued the approach under President
Gerald Ford. By using pressure and inducement, as well as downplaying
ideological differences, the United States tried to lure the Russians
into a stable equilibrium of global power. Under détente, Washington
slashed defense spending and soft-pedaled Moscow's human rights
affronts. The working assumption was that the Soviet Union's appetite
for destabilizing actions abroad would somehow be self-limiting.

But the Russians had their own ideas about the utility of détente. As
the historian John Lewis Gaddis observed, the Soviets "might have viewed
détente as their own instrument for inducing complacency in the West
while they finished assembling the ultimate means of applying
pressure---their emergence as a full-scale military rival of the United
States." Nixon and Kissinger thought détente would secure Soviet help in
managing crises around the world and, as Gaddis put it, "enmesh the
U.S.S.R. in a network of economic relationships that would make it
difficult, if not impossible, for the Russians to take actions in the
future detrimental to Western interests." But the policy failed to
achieve its goals.

President Jimmy Carter came into office in 1977 intending to keep
détente in place, but the policy didn't work for him either. His attempt
to "de-link" Soviet actions that hurt U.S. interests from Soviet
cooperation on arms control ultimately yielded setbacks in both
categories. The Soviets became more aggressive globally, and a wary U.S.
Congress, having lost faith in Moscow's sincerity, declined to ratify
SALT II, the arms control treaty that Carter's team had painstakingly
negotiated. Meanwhile, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's national security
adviser, had grown increasingly skeptical of détente. Brzezinski felt
that a turning point had come in 1978, after the Soviets sponsored
thousands of Cuban soldiers to wage violent revolution in the Horn of
Africa, supporting Ethiopia in its war with Somalia. The Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan the following year was "the final nail in the coffin" for
arms control talks, Brzezinski wrote in his journal---and for the
broader policy of détente.

By the time President Ronald Reagan entered the White House, in 1981,
Nixon and Kissinger's invention was on its last legs. "Détente's been a
one-way street that the Soviet Union has used to pursue its aims,"
Reagan stated flatly in his first press conference as president,
effectively burying the concept.

Reagan sought to win, not merely manage, the Cold War. In a sharp
departure from his immediate predecessors, he spoke candidly about the
nature of the Soviet threat, recognizing that autocrats often bully
democracies into silence by depicting honesty as a form of aggression.
In 1987, when Reagan was preparing to give a speech within sight of the
Berlin Wall, some of his aides begged him to remove a phrase they found
gratuitously provocative. Wisely, he overruled them and delivered the
most iconic line of his presidency: "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
wall."

THE SMOKELESS WAR

Washington must adopt a similar attitude today and try harder to
disseminate truthful information within China itself and to make it
possible for Chinese citizens to communicate securely with one another.
Tearing down---or at least blowing holes in---the "Great Firewall" of
China must become as central to Washington's approach today as removing
the Berlin Wall was for Reagan's.

[[Beijing is waging a bitter info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark} against
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates---which is losing, despite
its natural advantages. [[Xi and]{.mark} his inner [circle see]{.mark}
themselves as **[fighting an existential]{.mark}** ideological
**[campaign]{.mark}** against the West,]{.underline} as [Xi's
words]{.underline} from an official publication in 2014 make clear:

Today's security landscape features the danger of direct military
conflict between great powers. [[China's]{.mark} territorial claims
[challenge]{.mark} U.S. allies from [Japan]{.mark} to the
[Philippines]{.mark}]{.underline} and other U.S. partners in the region,
such as [[India]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Vietnam]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Long-held U.S. interests such as freedom of navigation run into direct
conflict with China's maritime ambitions.]{.underline}

Then there is Taiwan. [[An attack on Taiwan would require]{.mark} a U.S.
military [response]{.mark}]{.underline}, even if the policy of
"strategic ambiguity" created uncertainty about the exact nature of it.
For years, the United States has acted as a kind of rheostat in the
Taiwan Strait, with the goal of preserving the status quo. Since 1979,
administrations from both parties have sold arms to Taiwan. President
Bill Clinton deployed the USS Independence to the strait in 1996 in
response to Beijing's aggressive activity. In 2003, the Bush
administration publicly chastised Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian
when he proposed a referendum that sounded very much like a vote on
independence. All along, the goal was to maintain---or occasionally,
restore---what had become a relatively stable status quo.

In recent years, [[Beijing's aggressive]{.mark} military
[activities]{.mark} around Taiwan have [challenged]{.mark} that
[equilibrium]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Washington, strategic ambiguity
has largely given way to open discussion of how to deter and, if
necessary, repel a Chinese invasion. But [[Beijing
could]{.underline}]{.mark} threaten Taiwan in other ways. It could
[[blockade]{.mark} the island, as [Chinese]{.mark} forces have
[practiced]{.mark} in [exercises]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Or it could
[seize]{.mark} small, uninhabited Taiwanese [islands, cut]{.mark}
underwater [cables]{.mark}, or launch large-scale
[cyberattacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} These strategies might be smarter
than a risky and difficult assault on Taiwan and would complicate a U.S.
response.

The overarching point is that [Beijing has Taiwan in its sights. Chinese
leader [Xi]{.mark} Jinping, who views the island as a rogue province,
[wants]{.mark} to complete the [restoration]{.mark} of China and take
his place in the pantheon of leaders next to Mao Zedong. [Hong Kong
is]{.mark} now effectively [a province]{.mark} of China]{.underline},
and bringing [Taiwan]{.underline} to heel would fulfill Xi's ambition.
That [[risks open conflict between U.S. and Chinese
forces.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Alarmingly, the United States and China still have none of the
deconfliction measures in place that the United States and Russia do.
During the 2008 war in Georgia, for instance, Michael Mullen, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, had ongoing contact with his
Russian counterpart, Nikolai Makarov, so as to avoid an incident as the
U.S. Air Force flew Georgian troops home from Iraq to join the fight.
Compare that with 2001, when a hot-dogging Chinese pilot hit a U.S.
reconnaissance plane and forced it to the ground. The crew was detained
on Hainan Island, and for three days, Washington was unable to make
high-level contact with the Chinese leadership. I was national security
adviser at the time. Finally, I located my Chinese counterpart, who was
on a trip in Argentina, and got the Argentines to take a phone to him at
a barbecue. "Tell your leaders to take our call," I implored. Only then
were we able to defuse the crisis and free the crew. The reopening of
military-to-military contacts with China earlier this year, after a
four-year freeze, was a welcome development. But it is a far cry from
the types of procedures and lines of communication needed to prevent
accidental catastrophe.

[China's conventional [military modernization]{.mark} is impressive and
[accelerating]{.mark}. The country now has the [largest navy]{.mark} in
the world]{.underline}, with over 370 ships and submarines. [The
[growth]{.mark} in China's [nuclear arsenal]{.mark} is also
alarming.]{.underline} While the United States and the Soviet Union came
to a more or less common understanding of how to maintain the nuclear
equilibrium during the Cold War, that was a two-player game. [If China's
nuclear modernization continues, the world will face a more complicated,
multiplayer scenario---and without the safety net that Moscow and
Washington developed.]{.underline}

The potential for conflict comes against the backdrop of an arms race in
revolutionary technologies: [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence, [[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark}
computing, [[syn]{.underline}]{.mark}thetic
[[bio]{.underline}]{.mark}logy, [[robotics]{.underline}]{.mark},
advances in [[space]{.underline}]{.mark}, and others. In 2017[, [Xi gave
a speech]{.mark} in which he [declared]{.mark} that [China would
surpass]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [in these
frontier technologies [by 2035.]{.mark}]{.underline} Although he was
undoubtedly trying to rally China's scientists and engineers, it may be
a speech he has come to regret. Just as it was after the Soviet Union
launched the Sputnik satellite, the United States was forced to confront
the possibility that it could lose a technological race to its main
adversary---a realization that has spurred a concerted pushback from
Washington.

Any good strategy starts with a clear goal in mind, and these three
visions of victory should inspire and inform U.S. strategy. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates and its allies
[[should]{.mark} work to [strengthen themselve]{.mark}s as well as
counter [and]{.mark} [weaken China]{.mark}]{.underline} (including by
working to loosen the CCP's grip on power) while simultaneously engaging
in tough-minded diplomacy to show China's leaders that there is a better
way forward if they are willing to end their hostile policies.

[[Some]{.mark} will [argue]{.mark} that a [tougher approach]{.mark} that
threatens the CCP will only [cause Beijing to become]{.mark} even more
[hostile, but]{.mark}]{.underline} in fact, [[China's]{.mark} current
[aggression]{.mark} has been [enabled by]{.mark} an [inconsistent
West]{.mark}ern approach that has failed to impose adequate costs on
Beijing for its malign behavior. A more [resolute
policy]{.mark}]{.underline} of confrontation [is [necessary]{.mark} now
[to bring]{.mark} about a l[ess threatening]{.mark} China in the
[future]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Others might worry that the defeat of China's anti-American policies
would harm the well-being of the [Chinese people,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} of China's partners around the world,
[especially in the [global south]{.mark}. But on the contrary, these
populations would be among the [biggest beneficiaries of a]{.mark} new
[China that is less repressive]{.mark} at home and more cooperative
abroad.]{.underline}

It is hard to achieve success if you cannot envision it. With these
visions of victory clearly in mind, the United States and its allies
should finally set out to win, not just manage, the new cold war.

### AT: Imperialism K

#### Retrenchment causes authoritarian backsliding and makes global imperialism worse. Sweeping defense of "anti-imperialism" cause the US to turn inward and cedes control to revisionist powers.

The trouble with this new consensus, however, is that [Washington is not
operating in a vacuum.]{.underline} An undeviating policy of [U.S.
[restraint risks]{.mark} giving free rein to]{.underline} decidedly
**[regressive forces]{.underline}** in the world---[such as **[China's
authoritarian influence]{.mark}** across the global South, [Iran's
financing]{.mark} of [terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Middle East,
[and **[Russia's]{.mark}** war of **[aggression]{.mark}** against
Ukraine]{.underline}. Progressives are right to have a healthy
skepticism of using military force and coercive power. But the reality
today is that there are [authoritarian powers]{.underline} that are
[repressing]{.underline} their own [populations, bullying neighboring
states,]{.underline} and [[wielding economic]{.mark} influence and
[military force]{.mark} in]{.underline} other [ways that are
antithetical to progressive values. [If]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[retrenched]{.mark}, the [world would]{.mark} surely [see
**more**]{.mark} such behavior, not less.]{.underline}

Today's progressives need to get comfortable with [American
power]{.underline}, which, for all its flaws, [has a crucial role to
play.]{.underline} That doesn't mean condoning illiberal actions to
achieve just ends or cynically invoking progressive ideals to justify
military adventurism. [But it does mean seeking to harness power to
advance the values progressives cherish---and accepting that **[might
sometimes makes right.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

PILLARS OF PROGRESSIVISM

A progressive foreign policy shares some features with other approaches
but stands apart in key ways. [Liberal internationalism]{.underline}, a
foreign policy that aims to spread and protect liberal economic and
political values, [seeks [to]{.mark} promote democracy and [undermine
authoritarianism]{.mark}.]{.underline} So does conservative primacy,
which calls for the United States to maintain the preponderance of
global power. But compared with progressivism, these doctrines are more
optimistic about the ability of military force to achieve its goals, and
they are less committed to opposing imperialism and encouraging
self-determination.

[Progressive foreign policy also has some similarities to deep
engagement, an approach that demands the buildup of a [military]{.mark}
arsenal [sufficient to deter attacks]{.mark} against not only the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [but also its
allies.]{.underline} Proponents of both progressivism
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} deep engagement want Washington to [[work
with]{.mark} allies through multilateral [institutions]{.mark} such as
the UN.]{.underline} But progressives go further, championing
significant changes to these institutions, with an eye to making them
more equitable rather than necessarily U.S.-led. Progressives are also
more willing to hold back military aid from allies---as when the Biden
administration paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May
over growing concerns about the civilian death toll in Gaza.

On domestic policy, progressives mostly agree on specific priorities:
higher taxes for the rich, more spending on social programs, legal
protections for abortion, reforms to address the legacy of racism, and
so on. But there is far less consensus on foreign policy; instead, there
is a more general agreement on certain values that should inform U.S.
foreign policy.

The first is political and economic egalitarianism. This value can be
furthered through policies that promote equal political rights and
economic opportunities for women and other marginalized people, enforce
strong labor and environmental protections in trade agreements, and
condition military aid on human rights conditions. Just as progressives
support domestic policies that advance such goals at home, they champion
similar policies abroad. The platform of Democratic Senator Bernie
Sanders, for example, calls for "a foreign policy which focuses on
democracy, human rights, diplomacy and peace, and economic fairness."

The second principle fundamental to progressive thought is opposition to
needless war and excessive militarism, a tenet often described as
restraint. Progressives generally want Washington to avoid the use of
force and instead resolve disputes through talks. They are skeptical of
military alliances, which they argue can antagonize rivals and imperil
other states. "There are significant drawbacks to NATO's continuing
existence," the progressive historian Daniel Bessner has argued. "For
this reason, one of the major goals of the anti-imperialist left should
be to dismantle NATO." Some progressive advocates of restraint, such as
the economist Jeffrey Sachs and the historian Stephen Wertheim, view
NATO enlargement as one of the primary causes of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine.

The third principle is anti-imperialism, which emerged as a pillar of
leftist and progressive thought in the late nineteenth century as a
reaction against European empire building. To be sure, not every
progressive saw colonialism as problematic---U.S. President Theodore
Roosevelt chief among them. But by the turn of the twentieth century,
many progressives had begun to criticize the colonial projects of
France, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. Later, as
anticolonial movements took root beginning in the postwar era, Western
anti-imperialist activists, including many in the civil rights movement
and the anti-apartheid movement, often supported independence struggles
by sending financial resources to national liberation movements and
publicizing their struggles.

Even today, Western commentators sometimes invoke anti-imperialism in
their calls for international solidarity, as when they argue in favor of
supporting Ukrainians' effort to resist Russia's imperialist aggression.
More often, however, [contemporary [anti-imperialism]{.mark} in the West
[is inwardly focused,]{.mark} [manifested in calls to combat Western
policies]{.mark} and practices that perpetuate systems of domination and
exploitation over poor countries]{.underline}. Progressives worry about
Western companies' behavior in the developing world, such as their use
of cheap labor, land expropriation, and environmental degradation. They
worry, too, about Western governments' imperialist treatment of other
countries, as with the imposition of "Washington consensus" economic
reforms in Latin America.

WHO'S TO BLAME?

For many progressives, these three principles are best pursued through a
foreign policy of retrenchment and restraint, since, in their view, it
is the United States that is to blame for much of what ails the world
today. The political scientist Van Jackson describes
"[[anti-hegemonism]{.mark}" as a branch of progressive grand strategy
that "[prioritizes restraining U.S. military]{.mark} and economic power
because it is the only adequate response to the perceived root cause of
global insecurity."]{.underline} Bessner would also like to see
Washington "restrain and reduce" its power. In this vision, the United
States would have fewer military bases, less influence on global
economic markets, and fewer and weaker military alliances. It would shy
away from getting involved in foreign crises, especially those requiring
military commitments, such as the war in Ukraine.

A United States like that, the logic goes, would no longer entangle
itself in conflicts akin to the "forever wars" that followed 9/11. By
shrinking its global military footprint, moreover, the country would not
be able to spread democracy at gunpoint or forcibly promote its
particular version of hard-edged capitalism, creating more space for
political and economic self-determination and progress toward political
and economic egalitarianism. And because the United States is an empire,
its pulling back would be anti-imperialist almost by definition.
Progressives [take it as a given that retrenchment would not undermine
their foreign policy goals.]{.underline}

UNRESOLVABLE TENSIONS

Progressive foreign policy principles---anti-militarism,
anti-imperialism, and egalitarianism---often conflict. Sometimes, the
pursuit of one undermines the others. Perhaps nowhere is this clearer
than in Ukraine. In October 2022, the Congressional Progressive Caucus
called on the Biden administration to negotiate with Russia to end the
war, only to drop the position under pressure from other Democrats who
concluded that opposition to imperialism should take precedence over
opposition to war. Not all progressives agreed with the caucus's
about-face. The historian Samuel Moyn has described support for Ukraine
as an aspect of "the militarization of the globe under U.S. auspices."
Days after the invasion, the Democratic Socialists of America, the
country's largest socialist organization, called on the United States
"to withdraw from NATO and to end the imperialist expansionism that set
the stage for this conflict." [But if [Washington discontinued]{.mark}
its military [support for Ukraine, progressive aims]{.mark} and values
[in Europe]{.mark} and beyond [would]{.mark} almost certainly [be set
back.]{.mark} A strict [antimilitarist policy would not]{.mark}
[serve]{.mark} the cause of [Ukrainian]{.mark} liberals, [who]{.mark}
would [face]{.mark} a direct threat of repression, detention, or even
[death]{.mark} under Moscow's ruthless rule.]{.underline}

[Retrenchment cannot resolve this tension between]{.underline}, on the
one hand, opposing war and, on the other, [defending egalitarianism and
resisting imperialism]{.underline}. In fact, [[abandoning]{.mark}
Ukraine wouldn't necessarily result in less war; it [could]{.mark} very
well [embolden]{.mark}]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir
[[Putin]{.mark} to intensify his efforts to subjugate the Ukrainian
people.]{.underline} And even if reducing military aid to Ukraine
hastened a formal end to the war through peace negotiations, as some
progressives hope, [[violence against]{.mark} Ukrainian
[civilians]{.mark} by Russian forces in occupied territories would
probably continue apace. It [might]{.mark} even
[escalate.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A similar tension arises in [Syria]{.mark} policy]{.underline}. Some
[[progressive]{.underline}]{.mark} Democrats in the House of
Representatives, such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Becca Balint,
[[have joined isolationist Republicans]{.mark} in calling on Washington
to bring home the 900 U.S. troops still deployed in Syria.]{.underline}
These troops work alongside the Syrian Democratic Forces, a
predominantly Kurdish alliance of rebel groups opposed to the regime of
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, helping combat the remnants of the
Islamic State, or ISIS. The SDF was a crucial ally in the U.S.-led
coalition to defeat ISIS; it governs part of northeast Syria as a de
facto state with a constitution-like charter that reflects a commitment
to democracy, human rights, and gender equality.

[The presence of U.S. [troops]{.mark} is [crucial to]{.mark} the SDF's
efforts to [maintain security]{.mark} in northeast Syria, and the [SDF
has]{.mark} in fact repeatedly expressed [concerns]{.mark} that an
American [withdrawal would be **catastrophic.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [By
dialing back its modest support of the relatively progressive SDF, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would [enable Iran, Russia,
and ISIS to expand]{.mark} their influence in Syria and foil one of the
region's few democratic independence movements. A complete withdrawal
from Syria would be even worse, [creating a]{.mark} security
[vacuum]{.mark} in which these forces could [pursue]{.mark} their
[violent]{.mark}, antidemocratic [agendas]{.mark}. The [same]{.mark}
goes [for Iraq,]{.mark}]{.underline} which still hosts 2,500 U.S.
troops.

Some progressives have decried military intervention as a thinly veiled
imperialist tool. In a 2020 interview, Matt Duss, then a foreign policy
adviser to Sanders, described U.S. forces around the world as part of an
"empire that we have created." In many cases, such as the U.S.
interventions in Iraq in 2003 and Libya in 2011, these arguments have
proved to be well founded. But in some instances, [[military]{.mark}
action has [saved many lives]{.mark}.]{.underline} The British military
[intervention in [Sierra Leone]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2000, for
example, [was essential to sustaining UN [peacekeeping]{.mark} forces
there, [end]{.mark}ing [the war,]{.mark} and fostering a peace that has
lasted for more than 20 years.]{.underline}

Outside of war, [retrenchment can similarly undermine progressive goals.
Consider the extensive role Washington played in preventing a coup in
[Brazil]{.mark}.]{.underline} From 2021 to 2022, the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [worked with Luiz Inácio
Lula da Silva, the democratically elected president of Brazil, to
[prevent]{.mark} supporters of the defeated incumbent, Jair [Bolsonaro,
from]{.mark} illegally [seizing power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[The administration publicly supported Lula's victory, encouraged U.S.
allies to take the same position, and communicated to the Brazilian
military that a coup would leave the country isolated and result in a
downgrading of U.S. security cooperation.]{.underline} The result:
[[violence was avoided]{.mark}, and a]{.underline} popularly elected,
[politically progressive president survived an antidemocratic challenge
from his authoritarian rival.]{.underline} Washington has been complicit
in a long history of abuses in South America. But on this occasion, it
used its diplomatic influence to preserve democratic institutions. [Had
the United States instead stayed out of the dispute, Brazil would
probably have ended up with more violence and less
democracy.]{.underline}

[[Retrenchment from global markets]{.mark}, such as withdrawing from
[trade]{.mark} agreements or international economic
[institutions]{.mark}, can likewise [create vacuums]{.mark} for bad
actors to exploit. Consider the vacuum left behind by the failure of the
T]{.underline}rans-[P]{.underline}acific [P]{.underline}artnership, the
trade deal proposed by the Obama administration that would have
strengthened economic ties between the United States and 11 other
economies. When U.S. President Donald Trump killed the TPP in 2017,
progressives such as Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren, and
Representative Keith Ellison applauded. Progressives can debate what
effect the TPP would have had on American jobs, and they can argue that
the proposed agreement did not go far enough to uphold human rights and
environmental or labor standards abroad. But the TPP's failure did not
ameliorate such abuses; it exacerbated them. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [trading [partners]{.mark} went on to
[look]{.mark} elsewhere for international economic leadership, and they
found it [in China.]{.mark} In 2020, 15 countries, including China,
signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,
[creating]{.mark} the largest [economic bloc in]{.mark} history in a
deal [that includes none of the labor]{.mark}, human [rights, or]{.mark}
[environmental protections]{.mark} envisioned in the TPP.]{.underline}
The interests of American workers should always be considered, but
progressive advocates of protectionism must also grapple with how their
policies affect workers in developing countries.

Progressives who push for restraint and retrenchment generally have
little to say about how the United States should address its own
security threats. Some advocates of restraint argue for "offshore
balancing," whereby Washington pulls back and relies instead on regional
allies to keep challengers in check. Although this approach would reduce
the direct role of the U.S. military in international conflicts, it
still allows for the United States to exercise its influence in proxy
wars that can be just as inimical to peace and security, if not more so.
Today, autocratic countries such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia benefit from
U.S. arms sales, joint military training exercises, and other security
cooperation. Doling out military aid may keep U.S. troops out of harm's
way, but it does not necessarily reduce armed conflict. Often, it merely
renders the United States complicit in violations of human rights and
the laws of war, as in Israel's war in Gaza and Saudi Arabia's war in
Yemen.

Progressives' mistrust of U.S. foreign policy and intervention is
understandable, given Washington's long history of harmful military,
political, and economic interference abroad. American power has often
hindered progressive aims. But it has sometimes advanced them. [A
[rigid]{.mark} commitment to [restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}, no matter
the circumstances and whatever the cost, [[is]{.mark} the stuff of
**[ideological zealotry]{.mark}**, not judicious
policymaking.]{.underline}

A FORCE FOR GOOD

Progressives are rightly skeptical about the ability of military force
to achieve political goals. [But there are scenarios in which the use of
[force aligns with]{.mark} progressive principles: military support for
[anti-imperialist efforts]{.mark}, limited [humanitarian
interventions,]{.mark} and [defensive wars]{.mark} of necessity.
[Washington]{.mark}]{.underline} should rarely resort to military
solutions to international problems, but it [[must retain]{.mark} the
[capacity]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} the [will]{.mark}---[to wield
force]{.mark} or support its use by others in ways that align with
progressive principles.]{.underline}

[Military, economic, and humanitarian [support]{.mark} to
[anti-imperialist combatants]{.mark} is consistent with progressive
principles]{.underline}, as long as the recipients comply with
international humanitarian law and norms regarding the use of force.
Countries with long traditions of progressivism have historically
supported anti-imperialist actions around the world; Sweden, for
example, supplied humanitarian aid to national liberation movements in
Mozambique and Guinea Bissau in the 1960s and 1970s.

Even direct military involvement can be consistent with progressive
values. Many humanitarian interventions have intensified violence and
prolonged wars---as in Libya, where the NATO coalition overstepped its
narrow mandate of protecting civilians and ended up facilitating regime
change. But there are notable exceptions, such as when the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and its
coalition partners [expelled Iraqi]{.mark}]{.underline} [[forces from
Kuwait]{.mark} in the Gulf War]{.underline}. There have also been
[[**countless humanitarian crises**, such as]{.underline}]{.mark} in
[[Rwanda]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1994, in
[[Srebrenica]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1995, and in [[Sri
Lanka]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2009, in [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} the
United States failed to intervene---and in which [[even a modest]{.mark}
military [intervention would]{.mark} likely [have reduced]{.mark} human
[suffering]{.mark} without exacerbating violence.]{.underline} The
political scientist Alan Kuperman has estimated that a "minimum
intervention" to stop the Rwandan genocide could have saved about 75,000
lives.

Finally, [wars for defensive purposes]{.underline}, whether in defense
of the United States or U.S. allies, are generally consistent with
progressive values, so long as they are fought in ways that align with
international humanitarian law and the laws of war. No mainstream
progressive has called for surrendering the country's right to national
self-defense. But many of them advocate [[policies]{.mark} that [could
gut]{.mark} the United States' [defensive capabilities]{.mark},
capabilities [that deter aggression]{.mark} by making war less desirable
for would-be aggressors.]{.underline} For this reason, although
progressives are right to call for cuts to the U.S. defense
budget---which, at nearly \$900 billion a year, remains the world's
largest---a [progressive national security policy must prioritize the
maintenance of an adequate defense base.]{.underline}

### Current Icebreakers Insufficient

#### Icebreakers needed to continue research now -- scientists access to the ships is limited

The University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) and the research vessel
Sikuliaq will join partners from Europe and Canada in the newly formed
Arctic Research Icebreaker Consortium (ARICE). This [new]{.underline}
[international consortium]{.underline}, consisting of 15 partners from
13 different countries, [will support]{.underline} planning and
[implementation of Arctic research cruises by better coordinating the
existing icebreaker fleet, allowing]{.underline} researchers to compete
for fully-funded ship time, and [collaborating with commercial vessels
to increase Arctic data collection.]{.underline}

[Retreating sea ice and warming waters have given rise to]{.underline}
unprecedented [political, economic, and scientific interest in the
Arctic]{.underline} Ocean over the past decade. Research [icebreakers
provide the infrastructure and tools for studying ice-covered areas of
the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}. But [only a few icebreakers are capable
of supporting such research]{.underline}. [One objective]{.underline} of
ARICE [is to help increase the efficiency of how icebreaker cruise time
is designated]{.underline} so this limited resource is used effectively.

[Recogniz]{.underline}ing the [need to provide polar scientists with
better research icebreaker capacities for the Arctic]{.underline}, the
European Commission will give ARICE \$7.1 million over the course of
four years to better coordinate the existing polar research fleet.

The R/V Sikuliaq is owned by the National Science Foundation and
operated by the UAF College of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences (CFOS) as
part of the U.S. academic research fleet. The global-class research
vessel is used by scientists in the U.S. and international oceanographic
community through the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory
System (UNOLS).

\"Our role as a key partner in ARICE raises the international visibility
of Sikuliaq and brings new resources to support our ship operations,\"
said Bradley Moran, dean of the UAF College of Fisheries and Ocean
Sciences. \"[A priority]{.underline} of this program [is to enhance
international scientific collaboration in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent
seas]{.underline}, and in that regard, we look forward to increased
demand for use of Sikuliaq by the broader research community. This is an
important accomplishment for CFOS as operator of Sikuliaq.\"

cutbacks executed by DOGE is still uncertain, sources such as the New
York Magazine report that 30,000 federal workers have been given notice.
The mass firings have mainly targeted probationary workers, 200,000 of
the total of 2.4 million federal workers. The journal Science recently
reported that the mass firings were decimating US science agencies,
saying the \"layoffs decimated the foot soldiers of many health and
science agencies, sweeping up early-career scientists as well as old
hands in new positions.\" The [Trump]{.underline} administration
[has]{.underline} consistently [targeted climate research by cutting
grants and other support for any science]{.underline} endeavors that
focus on climate change. Many of the US president\'s January executive
orders focused on cutting or eradicating climate programs specifically
in an effort to roll back environmental and climate change initiatives
that were implemented under the Biden administration. The US has now
withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and essentially stopped wind power
development. In addition, the Trump administration is trying to undo the
Inflation Reduction Act, the largest investment in climate and energy in
American history. [Even the term \'climate change\' is now subject to
severe restrictions. It has been removed from official websites, grants,
and other support, and researchers must be careful not to use it if they
want to keep their funding]{.underline}.

### Science Diplomacy Low

#### Science diplomacy is at an all time low due---rising conflict deters

Development Goals (2016-18)., Science Diplomacy for the Future, AAAS,
https://www.sciencediplomacy.org/editorial/2024/science-diplomacy-for-future

[The current geopolitical environment is altering]{.underline} the
practice of [science diplomacy by]{.underline} governmental and
non-[governmental organizations in large part because the ability to
carry out international scientific]{.underline} and technological
[collaborations is being affected by security concerns. That is
especially true in collaborative research on technologies]{.underline},
but it is also true in those areas of fundamental research close to
technological advances that have the potential to create significant
advantages and threats for a nation state. International
[scientific]{.underline} and technological [collaboration]{.underline}
funded by governments [is]{.underline} growing among allied countries
but [decreasing between countries in competition and
conflict]{.underline}. That will affect the global advance of science
and technology as well as the ability of countries to collaborate to
solve global challenges. It is also negatively affecting the ability of
the United States as well as other countries to attract talent from
around the world. [The use of science diplomacy as a "window of
communication" between estranged countries is disappearing.
International scientific engagement has always been a vital component of
science and technology capacity-building and a key ingredient of many
science diplomacy initiatives.]{.underline} The new rules and
restrictions being developed and implemented now by government agencies
in the United States and allied countries are being justified by
legitimate security concerns arising from patent infringement,
technology theft, malign foreign talent programs, and espionage, as well
as cases of serious ethical lapses by scientists. This new regime of
research security will potentially affect fundamental research where, in
the past, results have been published in the open literature and where
much of the work has been conducted at universities, civilian national
laboratories, and international facilities. I have been concerned over
the past two years that [the balance between research openness and
security for fundamental research would tip too far towards the security
side. That would likely lead to more areas of "controlled unclassified
information" (CUI) and significantly decrease international scientific
collaboration]{.underline}. In my view, that result would harm the
ability of the United States and other democratic countries to advance
our national interest in being world leaders in science, technology, and
innovation, and in attracting talented people from around the world to
our countries. I have become more optimistic over this past year that
the engagement and dialogue being carried out by U.S. university
leaders, researchers, research-funding agencies, and government security
agencies is leading to a more nuanced and informed risk assessment
process[. Research institutions and research funders are implementing
rules and procedures that will not eliminate risks but will enable a
careful judgment on how to reduce the risks while still achieving the
benefits of the research. When carried out a project-by-project basis
with engagement by highly knowledgeable scientists inside and outside
government, this process should lead to better judgments on the balance
between openness and security for fundamental research.]{.underline}

### Science Diplomacy Spills Up

#### Science diplomacy has proven to increase cooperation

Science diplomacy typically encompasses more than just fundamental
science---many aspects of science, technology, and innovation (STI)
often come into play. Initiatives have been undertaken by national
governments, international organizations, non-governmental institutions,
individual scientists, and of course by collaborations among many
actors. When practiced by governments, [science diplomacy often depends
upon scientific and technical experts being involved in international
scientific engagements to achieve diplomatic goals for the national
interest. National goals can overlap with global goals, but that is not
always the case, and the goals may even conflict. Science diplomacy can
be used to gather intelligence and influence foreign governments through
their scientific communities as well as to improve diplomatic relations,
to advance worldwide science for mutual benefit, and to solve global
challenges]{.underline}. Non-governmental scientific organizations can
engage in science diplomacy to achieve their own scientific and
diplomatic goals, which, again, may not be entirely the same goals as
those of their governments. Some of the most important and successful
science diplomacy initiatives have involved collaboration among
governmental and non-governmental actors. My own involvement in science
diplomacy has lasted over forty years across a wide range of countries
and issues, serving as researcher, professor, executive officer of the
National Academy of Sciences, science and technology adviser to the
Secretary of State, co-chair of the 10-Member-Group advising at the
United Nations on the role of STI in achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), and as a participant in many initiatives of
non-governmental scientific organizations. My views on what can be
achieved by science diplomacy have been profoundly influenced by wise
mentors and practitioners whom I consider to be great "science
diplomats." They include distinguished scientists who had no training in
the art of diplomacy or experience working in government. [They also
include diplomats and politicians who had little or no training in
science]{.underline}. Incorporating multidisciplinary expertise and
knowledge, not just from science, but also the humanities, professional
fields, and practical experience, is invaluable for making progress with
science diplomacy. [One aspect of science diplomacy often
underappreciated is the possibility of scientific and technological
advances to "leap over" diplomatic hurdles that have stymied progress,
through devising new pathways and solutions. Some science diplomacy
successes have lasted for decades, although even some of these have been
reversed when geopolitics have taken a drastic turn.]{.underline} While
it is painfully clear that politics is a more powerful force than
science in the short run, geopolitics can also change in ways that
enable science diplomacy initiatives, even those begun in earlier years,
to take advantage of a new "window of opportunity." Science Diplomacy
Successes in the "Golden Era" of 1980 to 2020 I am fortunate to have
observed and participated in a "golden era" for science diplomacy that
lasted almost forty years. [Among great successes for science diplomacy
were: the Montreal Protocol ratified in the late 1980s, the nuclear arms
control treaties realized in the 1990s, and the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) and its "Summaries for Policy Makers"
negotiated with governments that were influential in achieving the Paris
Climate Agreement signed in 2016]{.underline}. The Montreal Protocol was
made possible by three key ingredients: the scientific advances of the
three scientists who won the Nobel Prize after alerting the world to the
threat of destruction of the ozone layer, the companies that developed
new refrigerants that did not use chlorofluorocarbons, and diplomats who
persisted in pursuing a treaty.

### Research S Science Diplomacy

#### Arctic research strengthens science diplomacy---it creates opportunities to grow

[Science, research and innovation play a key role in increasing our
knowledge of the Arctic]{.underline}, in understanding the changes of
the region and hence in contributing to providing policy responses to
the huge challenges it is facing. [It is an illustration of the
importance of science diplomacy]{.underline}. Science diplomacy has
different dimensions. This article will address how science contributes
to evidence-based policymaking in turbulent times[. While science and
technology play an increasingly important role in the geopolitical
arena, it has been claimed that science diplomacy in the Arctic has been
severely impacted by geopolitics.]{.underline} Though some negative
effects are clearly observable, it is worthwhile to assess the real
dimension of the impact of reduced scientific cooperation with Russia.
Indeed, [a closer look at recent developments demonstrates that current
geopolitics did create new opportunities for science diplomacy in and
for the Arctic, which cannot be neglected.]{.underline}

As geopolitical and military instability abuts nonmilitary humanitarian
pursuits, Arctic states may be forced to allocate resources to
protecting individual interests over supporting scientific cooperation.
However, [in]{.underline} other [periods of tension, science diplomacy
has been key to preserving cooperation between allies and
rivals]{.underline}, as with the Pugwash Conferences on Science and
World Affairs, the Edinburgh Conversations, Cold War--era polio vaccine
cooperation, and the international effort to sequence SARS-CoV-2.

With the Arctic region in a precarious position, now may be the time to
move beyond traditional forms of diplomacy and center the pursuit of
alternative means of [scientific cooperation around health and climate
security as a unifying purpose for continued engagement.]{.underline}

An important component of any [effective international science
collaboration is the personal relationships cultivated between
scientists from around the world]{.underline}, often nurtured over
decades. To preserve those relationships under an Arctic Council with
diminished capacity, we recommend Western policymakers and other
stakeholders engage in bilateral initiatives extending beyond the Arctic
Council framework.

Strategically expanding approaches to scientific cooperation in the
polar regions, particularly through individual contacts, could solidify
the Arctic's significance as a focal point for twenty-first-century
science diplomacy.

Nongovernmental, informal interactions (known as Track II diplomacy)
among scientists from Arctic (and even non-Arctic) states could be a
powerful strategy for keeping Russia engaged and communicating with the
global scientific community. The first mechanism to try is for
researchers in neighboring states or territories (for example, Alaska,
the Russian district of Chukotka, and Yukon, a Canadian territory) to
arrange for partnerships in climate research. [Strategically expanding
approaches to scientific cooperation in the polar regions, particularly
through individual contacts, could solidify the Arctic's significance as
a focal point for twenty-first-century science diplomacy.]{.underline}

Second, [the science diplomacy community]{.underline}, housed in
universities and connected through national scientific academies,
[should continue to play a leading role in Arctic science diplomacy by
incentivizing researchers to build new scientific
partnerships]{.underline} across borders. This would require the
European Union and NATO members that discontinued projects with Russian
institutions after Russia invaded Ukraine to take a step forward in
reestablishing collaborations with Russian partners. Resumed research
partnerships should prioritize studies on the climate risks associated
with permafrost thaw and the mitigation of potential reactivation of
ancient microbiota and dormant pathogens. There should also be a much
more significant focus on cooperation between Arctic states and
Indigenous peoples' organizations, with a research agenda that
intertwines scientific and local knowledge.

And finally, the international community still working within the Arctic
Council platform should prioritize establishing a network of monitoring
stations in the high-latitude Arctic to swiftly identify pathogens in
hot spots of microbial diversity, such as mass bird-nesting sites. Such
monitoring activities can reinforce or create points of contact within
Arctic states and Indigenous peoples' organizations to buttress the
goals of the Arctic Council's 10-year-old One Arctic, One Health
project, which aims to improve coordination and strategies for handling
emerging threats. [Improved monitoring and]{.underline} coordination
would have multiple benefits: [more opportunities to develop scientific
diplomacy, stronger Arctic health and environmental security, more
knowledge about the global impacts of climate change, and the potential
to stimulate new initiatives to understand other microbial hot spots
around the globe.]{.underline}

In one of the last examples of Arctic scientific cooperation with Russia
before its invasion of Ukraine, a study conducted by a team of German,
French, and Russian scholars identified 13 new viruses revived from
ancient permafrost---the result of almost a decade of joint research.
Keeping scientific connections like these alive among Arctic researchers
should be a diplomatic imperative, both to deepen the global
understanding of shared health and climate risks as well as to preserve
peace, stability, and constructive cooperation in the region and beyond.

### Research K2 S Disease

#### Arctic research on pathogens in ice key to disease preparedness - scientists already identifying them

**Mckie 24** (Robin, science and environment editor, "Arctic zombie
viruses in Siberia could spark terrifying new pandemic, scientists
warn,"
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2024/jan/21/arctic-zombie-viruses-in-siberia-could-spark-terrifying-new-pandemic-scientists-warn?utm_source=chatgpt.com&scrlybrkr=73e7d8e6)

As a result, [scientists]{.underline} [have begun]{.underline} planning
[an Arctic monitoring network that would pinpoint early cases of a
disease caused by ancient micro-organisms. Additionally, it would
provide quarantine and expert medical treatment for infected people in a
bid to contain an outbreak, and prevent infected people from leaving the
region.]{.underline} "At the moment, analyses of pandemic threats focus
on diseases that might emerge in southern regions and then spread
north," said geneticist Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille
University. "By contrast, little attention has been given to an outbreak
that might emerge in the far north and then travel south -- and that is
an oversight, I believe. There are viruses up there that have the
potential to infect humans and start a new disease outbreak." This point
was backed by virologist Marion Koopmans of the Erasmus Medical Center
in Rotterdam. "We don't know what viruses are lying out there in the
permafrost but I think there is a real risk that there might be one
capable of triggering a disease outbreak -- say of an ancient form of
polio. We have to assume that something like this could happen." In
2014, [Claverie led a team of scientists who isolated live viruses in
Siberia and showed they could still infect single-cell
organism]{.underline}s -- even though they had been buried in permafrost
for thousands of years. Further research, published last year, revealed
the existence of several different viral strains from seven different
sites in Siberia and showed these could infect cultured cells. One virus
sample was 48,500 years old. "The viruses we isolated were only able to
infect amoebae and posed no risk to humans," said Claverie. "However,
that does not mean that other viruses -- currently frozen in the
permafrost -- might not be able to trigger illnesses in humans. [We have
identified genomic traces of poxviruses and herpesviruses, which are
well known human pathogen]{.underline}s, for example." Permafrost covers
a fifth of the northern hemisphere and is made up of soil that has been
kept at temperatures below zero for long periods. Some layers have
remained frozen for hundreds of thousands of years, scientists have
discovered. "The crucial point about permafrost is that it is cold, dark
and lacks oxygen, which is perfect for preserving biological material,"
Claverie told the Observer last week. "You could put a yoghurt in
permafrost and it might still be edible 50,000 years later." But the
world's permafrost is changing. The upper layers of the planet's main
reserves -- in Canada, Siberia and Alaska -- are melting as climate
change affects the Arctic disproportionately. According to
meteorologists, the region is heating up several times faster than the
average rate of increase in global warming. However, it is not melting
permafrost directly that poses the most immediate risk, added Claverie.
"The danger comes from another global warming impact: the disappearance
of Arctic sea ice. That is allowing increases in shipping, traffic and
industrial development in Siberia. Huge mining operations are being
planned, and are going to drive vast holes into the deep permafrost to
extract oil and ores. "Those operations will release vast amounts of
pathogens that still thrive there. Miners will walk in and breath the
viruses. The effects could be calamitous." This point was stressed by
Koopmans. "If you look at the history of epidemic outbreaks, one of the
key drivers has been change in land use. [Nipah virus was spread by
fruit
bats](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/18/what-is-nipah-virus-kerala-india-bat-borne-outbreak-mass-testing)
who were driven from their habitats by humans. Similarly, monkeypox has
been linked to the spread of urbanisation in Africa. And that is what we
are about to witness in the Arctic: a complete change in land use, and
that could be dangerous, as we have seen elsewhere." [Scientists believe
that permafrost -- at its deepest levels -- may contain viruses that are
up to a million years old and so will be far older than our own species,
which is thought to have emerged about 300,000 years ago.]{.underline}
"Our immune systems may have never been in contact with some of those
microbes, and that is another worry," said Claverie. "The scenario of an
unknown virus once infecting a Neanderthal coming back at us, although
unlikely, has become a real possibility." For that reason, [Claverie and
others are working with UArctic, the University of the
Arctic]{.underline} -- an international educational network in the polar
region -- on plans [to establish quarantine facilities and provide
medical expertise]{.underline} that could pinpoint early cases and treat
them locally to try [to contain the infection.]{.underline}

An estimated [75 % of emerging infectious diseases]{.underline} (EIDs)
[are zoonotic]{.underline} (in origin or current transmission)
[and]{.underline} of these, around [72 % originate from
wildlife]{.underline} (Jones et al., 2008), [while]{.underline} ca. [63
% of all known human and animal infectious diseases]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} defined as [climate sensitive]{.underline} (McIntyre
et al., 2017). [Microbes]{.underline} and their community [composition,
function, physiological response and evolutionary adaptation are
inherently sensitive to climate change]{.underline} (Cavicchioli et al.,
2019) and [zoonotic]{.underline} [diseases]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} generally [more]{.underline} [climate]{.underline}
[sensitive]{.underline} [than]{.underline} [infectious]{.underline}
[diseases]{.underline}, in part [due]{.underline} [to]{.underline} their
[wider host ranges and modes of transmission including vector-borne and
environmental transmission]{.underline} (McIntyre et al., 2017; Naicker,
2011). [Climate change is occurring at the most dramatic rate in the
Arctic]{.underline}, [and it is therefore crucial to understand the
relationship between zoonotic diseases, climate, and the effects of
anthropogenic activities on the epidemiology and epizootiology of
zoonoses]{.underline}. [Understanding]{.underline} [these]{.underline}
[interactions is important to enable informed and effective
interventions to mitigate human, animal, ecological, or economic
loss]{.underline} (Rantanen et al., 2022; Waits et al., 2018). In recent
years, reviews of the current knowledge of zoonotic diseases in the
Arctic covering a broad panel of zoonotic pathogens have been published
(e.g., Keatts et al., 2021; Tryland, 2022; Tryland et al., 2014; Tryland
and Kutz, 2018). This [knowledge]{.underline} [is]{.underline} however
[limited]{.underline} [to scattered efforts, low diagnostic capacity in
remote areas, and relatively low prioritization by Arctic health care
institutions]{.underline}. Moreover, [studies of Arctic zoonoses and has
typically - until recently - lacked implementation of valuable local
knowledge, e.g., from hunters]{.underline} (Tomaselli et al., 2018).
[These]{.underline} priorities (and lack thereof) vary across the Arctic
but nevertheless [leave gaps in our knowledge of current and emerging
zoonotic diseases in large parts of the inhabited Arctic]{.underline}
(Omazic et al., 2019). [Scientific attention to zoonoses in the Arctic
has typically been opportunistic or related to severe disease outbreaks
prompting further investigation]{.underline} (Gigante et al., 2019;
Snyman et al., 2023). With some exceptions such as
academic-community-government partnered wildlife health monitoring
programs (Checkley et al., 2022; Reynolds et al., 2022), [systematic
investigations have been lacking. Research efforts vary
greatly]{.underline} across the Arctic, with several reports from e.g.,
Canada, [but only very scarce information on zoonoses]{.underline} from
e.g., Greenland. [Compounding the challenges and knowledge gaps in this
field are difficulties in obtaining high quality samples for prompt
analysis, lack of timely communication between community stakeholders
and scientists, and other challenges of trans- and multidisciplinary
research.]{.underline} This [includes]{.underline}
[inconsistent]{.underline} [use of terminology, lack of coordinated
research programs and methodology standards, and unclear data
presentation across original research papers]{.underline} (Emelyanova et
al., 2022). Moreover, some weaknesses of traditional diagnostic
modalities - which have been widely used in Arctic zoonoses research -
are now being exposed by modern and ever price reducing high-throughput
sequencing techniques (e.g., Tschritter et al., 2024). Some conventional
diagnostic methods like serology, culture, and targeted genetic
sequencing can only detect and characterize known pathogens, i.e., their
weakness is among other that they demand some a priori knowledge about
what to look for thus hindering the discovery and characterization of
(unexpected) new pathogens. The latter is highly relevant - particularly
in a permafrost-thawing environment. Conversely, metagenomic modalities
present highly useful tools to investigate the presence of both known
and unknown pathogens in a wide range of sample types, and future
(coordinated) efforts will benefit from systematic studies looking into
the pathogenic microbiome of the Arctic, e.g., in traditional foods,
sewage, drinking water, invasive species, migratory species and areas
with high glacial or other permafrost runoff. As mentioned, there are
still many unanswered questions related to Arctic zoonoses, e.g. 1) How
will chemical pollution, biodiversity loss and habitat loss alter
disease dynamics for the known endemic diseases? 2) Which pathogens
remain undetected or unreported in the Arctic, and how are they affected
by multiple stressors? 3) How can disease outbreaks be effectively
managed? 4) Does the increase in tourism increase the risk of infections
and spreading of potential zoonotic diseases? To help prioritize and
coordinate surveillance and research efforts, Table 1 lists zoonoses
known in the Arctic as well as specific concerns increasing their
current relevance. The list also includes potentially emerging zoonoses
considering likely changes in conditions. It is, however, important to
remember that there is a growing number of \"combined\" or mixed
infections in the Arctic, causing potentially heavier course of disease
and additional challenge for diagnostics since many Arctic infections
share the same symptoms.

The U.S. Coast Guard cutter [[Healy]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [largest
U.S. icebreaker]{.underline}, [[is on]{.underline}]{.mark} its way to
[[Alaska for]{.underline}]{.mark} the first of three [[Arctic scientific
missions]{.underline}]{.mark} planned over the coming months. The Healy
departed on Wednesday from Seattle, its home port, the Coast Guard said.
Its first mission will bring scientists to the Beaufort Sea to service
underwater moorings, devices installed to collect information about
oceanic conditions. Scientists on the mission will also survey the
currents between the Bering Sea and the Canadian Beaufort Sea. Other
work to be conducted includes [[monitoring of Arctic algal
blooms]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Coast Guard said. In its second
mission, the Healy is scheduled to carry early career scientists on a
cruise through the Northwest Passage to Greenland. That mission is
intended to [[train scientists in Arctic research
practices]{.underline}]{.mark} and is modeled after a similar mission
conducted last year on the Sikuliaq, a research vessel owned by the
National Science Foundation and operated by the University of Alaska
Fairbanks. The Healy's third scheduled mission is to [[gather data for
the Global Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic Investigations
Program]{.underline}]{.mark}, an international scientific program
established in 2007. That work will collect high-resolution data across
the Arctic basin, the Coast Guard said. "We are excited to support three
significant missions in the northern high latitudes," Coast Guard Capt.
Michele Schallip, the Healy's commanding officer, said in a statement.
"Two of these [[missions]{.mark} are]{.underline} part of long-standing
[data collection projects, aimed at [enhancing]{.mark}]{.underline} our
[[understanding]{.mark} of a changing [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
third mission is dedicated to inspiring future principal investigators
who will continue this important work." At a time when scientific
interest in the Arctic Ocean is intensifying, the [[Healy]{.underline}
["substantially enhances" U.S. Arctic research
capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}, she said. "Healy's crew have been
unwavering in their efforts during our in-port maintenance period,
ensuring the cutter is ready to meet the demands of these missions," she
said.

### Science Diplomacy S Disease

#### Science diplomacy key to interstate cooperation in pandemics

**HPW 23,** 11/03/2023, reports on the leading global health policy
challenges & trends, linking journalists in global North and South on an
independent, non-profit platform, How Science Diplomacy Can Make a
Difference in Global Health, Health Policy Watch,
https://healthpolicy-watch.news/how-science-diplomacy-can-make-a-difference-in-global-health/

[Before]{.underline} the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was
adopted in [2003, the World Health Organization had worked for many
years to prevent damage caused by tobacco consumption]{.underline} with
the goal of passing an international agreement on tobacco regulation.
The agreement, however, was not moving forward. "[The real breakthrough
came as scientific evidence emerged showing the negative consequences of
passive smoking and its impact on children]{.underline}," Ilona
Kickbusch, the founding director of the Global Health Centre at the
Graduate Institute in Geneva, tells host Garry Aslanyan in the new
episode of the "Global Health Matters" podcast. "[These data and this
evidence really made a significant difference in getting the
negotiations started." Thanks to this development, the convention was
eventually adopted, becoming the first international treaty negotiated
under the auspices of WHO. Today, the agreement includes 182 parties,
covering over 90% of the world population]{.underline}. According to
Kickbusch, the convention embodies an important example of how science
and diplomacy can complement each other in achieving a goal or in
driving a change. The expert discusses the role of science diplomacy in
global health with Aslanyan and Aída Mencía Ripley, the Vice-Chancellor
for Research and Innovation at Universidad Iberoamericana in the
Dominican Republic. Ripley shares how in the Dominican Republic science
diplomacy was key to overcoming the challenges of the coronavirus
pandemic. ["We were able to use science diplomacy to build some bridges
and provide some of the early data on COVID sequencing]{.underline} for
our country," she recalls. "We were actually one of the first countries
in the region that was able to do this, thanks to some of these
international collaborations." Kickbusch also notes that the pandemic
clearly showed how many global health issues are also subject to
ideology, making hard evidence crucial[. "Being able to come together
and create a global consensus also means we have to overcome
ideology]{.underline} and we need to have really, really good data," she
says. "We can see that over the years, particularly in issues related to
sexual health in the widest sense of the word, many of the international
agreements, such as those guaranteeing access to medicines for
stigmatized groups, were only possible because we had the hard science."
Another important element for building consensus is promoting trust in
governments and institutions, the two experts say. "[We are in a
situation where trust in science and in policy-making is not as strong
as it was ten or twenty years ago," Kickbusch says. "We really need to
work on that trust. We need to work on health literacy. We need to work
on science literacy, both of the general population and of policy-makers
and diplomats]{.underline}." Ripley highlights that in order to tackle
health issues at the global level, it is essential to consider not only
the hard science but also each society's context. "Global health is
completely over-medicalized at this point," she points out. "I think
that some of the nuances that social and behavioral sciences bring to
the table are crucial because we need to be able to understand people's
socioeconomic and political contexts in order to make sure that we meet
people halfway, especially when we ask them to make major changes to
their way of life, such as we did during the pandemic."

### Arctic Research K2 S Warming

#### Icebreakers are key to arctic science research- help scientists obtain valuable climate data

[Icebreaker vessels play a crucial role in collecting the data we need
to cope with climate change in the Arctic and beyond.]{.underline} An
EU-funded project helped European marine researchers access such ships
to deliver important new insights. The devastating impact of climate
change on the Arctic region affects us all. Retreating sea ice and
warmer temperatures have the potential to trigger profound changes, such
as modified weather patterns, elsewhere. "What happens in the Arctic
does not stay in the Arctic: there is an urgent need to collect data
from the Arctic region to understand the reach of these changes and how
they will affect our future," says Verónica Willmott Puig, ARICE project
manager. The EU-funded [ARICE]{.underline} consortium, coordinated by
the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, [helped fill
in this gap by improving researchers' access to a valuable asset: the
existing fleet of polar research vessels.]{.underline} "[There are only
a handful of research vessels that can break through the ice, and only a
few countries operate such facilities]{.underline}," Willmott Puig
notes. Unique data for climate research breakthroughs Through ARICE,
European [scientists]{.underline} [gain]{.underline}ed [transnational
access to]{.underline} a set of key European and international [research
icebreakers]{.underline}. Seven outstanding research projects were
selected for cruises undertaken thanks to ARICE funding -- with
remarkable results. For instance, [researchers from the DEARice project
joined the MOSAiC expedition which saw German icebreaker Polarstern
drift through the Arctic Ocean for a year]{.underline}. The DEARice team
collected unique data on snow and sea ice which will help improve
climate projections. The GO-WEST project was able to explore the impact
of sea ice decline on polar cod during a cruise on board the American
icebreaker Sikuliaq. Among other achievements, they successfully
trialled a novel under-ice trawl net. [Researchers]{.underline} from
several other ARICE-funded projects [board]{.underline}ed Swedish
[icebreaker]{.underline} Oden [to contribute]{.underline} [to the
Synoptic Arctic Survey. This initiative collected empirical data in the
Arctic Ocean with a view to creating a baseline to track climate change
and its impacts.]{.underline}

forecasting accuracy is dramatically increasing with high performance

variables\--including snowfall, humidity, sunlight, and wind\--they can
more accurately model climate change impacts. For example, the models
can help researchers predict Arctic air and water temperatures that lead
to sea ice retreat and sea-level rise, and forecast coastal flooding,
which can impact Arctic ports, fishing operations, or community
infrastructure. [Researchers huddle over instruments in Alaska for NGEE

land, precipitation, and vegetation enables scientists to better predict
how plants---and the Earth's ecosystems\--will respond to future climate
change. For example, warmer summers and increased permafrost melting can
lead colder water to flow into Arctic streams, affecting vegetation and
the wildlife depending on it. Lab researchers hope to better understand
if and where the Arctic becomes wetter or drier, and the implications
for ecosystems throughout Alaska and around the world. [By gathering and

Antarctic [Research Remains Critical to National Security and Economic
Interests; U.S. Investment in New Icebreaker and Other Infrastructure Is
Essential]{.underline}, Says Report

News Release \| October 20, 2023

WASHINGTON --- A new report from the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine outlines the [importance of access
to]{.underline} the Southern Ocean and Antarctic coast [for research on
critical aspects of global ocean and climate systems, especially related
to climate change. Aging infrastructure available to U.S. researchers
should be replaced and include a new icebreaking research vessel and
other equipment that can support continued and expanded U.S. research
and technological interests]{.underline}, says the new report. [A robust
U.S. research presence in these regions, which are some of the harshest
and most remote places on Earth, is essential for national security and
economic interests]{.underline}, the report says. It identifies three
thematic scientific drivers --- global sea-level rise, the global carbon
cycle, and changing ecosystems --- and related high-priority research
questions as justification for renewed investment in vital
infrastructure and programs in the near term, especially construction of
a Polar Class 3 Antarctica Research Vessel (ARV). "These areas of
scientific research may be physically far away from the U.S., but the
effects of climate change on these areas and their resources are felt
close to home," said Paula Bontempi, dean of the Graduate School of
Oceanography at the University of Rhode Island, and co-chair of the
committee that wrote the report. "[The U.S. is a leader in]{.underline}
Antarctic and Southern Ocean [research, and we must make a continued
commitment to understanding these large systems that have national and
global impacts."]{.underline} he [urgency of this research is
increasing,]{.underline} as Antarctica's ice sheets may be approaching a
dangerous tipping point toward a prolonged period of ice loss driven by
climate change. Antarctica's 58 meters of sea-level rise potential will
have global-scale impacts, yet uncertainty remains about rates and
extent of ice mass loss and the long-term trajectory of sea-level rise.
The Southern Ocean is also where most deep waters rise to exchange
carbon with the atmosphere, and is responsible for about 40% to 50% of
the net removal of fossil fuel derived CO2 emissions. Thus, there is a
need for scientists to better understand how its carbon reservoir may
change. The ecosystems in this region are also uniquely adapted to
extreme environments and perform important functions that regulate the
exchange of energy, nutrients, and carbon throughout the area's food
webs. Considerable uncertainty remains about how ecosystems are
responding to a changing climate and may impact important natural
systems that directly or indirectly benefit humans and global economics.
The National Science Foundation's Office of Polar Programs (OPP) is
charged with supporting Antarctic science and logistical operations.
However, the [aging science infrastructure that serves the region will
not be able to support the research necessary to advance U.S.
interests]{.underline}. Without major and immediate investments,
including urgent investment in a new ARV, the U[.S. will fall behind
other nations in research that is essential to national
security]{.underline}, the report says.

### Science Diplomacy S Warming

#### Science Diplomacy key to solve warming

**Moritz Boeswirth 24**

Moritz Boeswrith is a Science Communication Intern in the IIASA
Communications and External Relations Department "How science diplomacy
can help combat climate change"
<https://iiasa.ac.at/blog/nov-2024/how-science-diplomacy-can-help-combat-climate-change>
\<gk!

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),
[[traditional approaches are not]{.mark} [enough to meet]{.mark} the
[climate goals]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the search for new ways forward,
[[science diplomacy]{.mark} could offer a powerful avenue for
[foste]{.mark}ring the [cooperation needed to develop]{.mark} effective
[solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. IIASA 2024 Science Communication
Intern, Moritz Boeswirth explored this topic. As we find ourselves in
the hottest year on record, it might be a good time to reassess our
current progress on climate change and discuss potential tools necessary
to find new avenues forward. Science diplomacy could play a key role in
helping to address this problem. [Science diplomacy uses scientific
collaborations among nations and peoples to address common, shared
problems and to build constructive international partnerships to achieve
this. In this sense, [science]{.mark} can [play important role in
foreign]{.mark} [policy and diplomacy]{.mark}, and vice versa. [IIASA's
DNA is strongly linked to science diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
foundation of the Institute is a perfect example of diplomacy for
science, as IIASA was originally established to create East-West
collaboration during the Cold War through scientific research unbound by
specific national political agendas. After the Cold War, the Institute
broadened its mandate to achieve a greater global focus. Today, [[IIASA
brings]{.mark} together a wide range of [scientific]{.mark} [skills
from]{.mark} around [the globe]{.mark} [to provide science]{.mark}-based
[insights into critical policy]{.mark} issues in international and
national debates on global change.]{.underline} This approach can be
seen as an extension of IIASA's goals toward science in diplomacy as
embodied in the Vienna Statement on Science Diplomacy a document that
emerged from discussions held during a unique IIASA 50th Anniversary
Science Diplomacy Event in 2022. [The statement presents a unified
vision for the future of science diplomacy, highlights the advantages it
offers in addressing today\'s global challenges, and defines the
principles necessary to promote science diplomacy on a global
scale.]{.underline} To date the document has been endorsed by more than
200 eminent personalities from the academic and policymaking community.
Experts and scientists often refer to the multifaceted problems we are
facing today as complex or wicked problems. Characteristically these
problems have hard-to-define system boundaries as they regularly span
across different regions, nations, societies, and decades. Therefore,
national or standalone solutions might mitigate some effects, but never
solve these crises. Systems analysis provides a way to better understand
these problems.[The climate crisis is but one example of such a wicked
problem, and has kept scientists, governments, and civil society busy
for decades]{.underline}. It seems that the full magnitude of the
problem only recently came to the attention of a larger number of
people, spurring protests and activism, climate anxiety, and
sustainability concerns in business and policy. But are current efforts
enough, and what is needed to further facilitate climate action? [Much
of [current]{.mark} [climate]{.mark} change mitigation is founded on
national action, but from a problem-solving perspective, it [requires
new methods of]{.mark} international cooperation and [diplomacy]{.mark},
as no single nation can tackle climate change on its own.
[Diplomacy]{.mark} pr[ovides]{.mark} the [tools]{.mark} to initiate,
[support, and]{.mark} secure international
[cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline} To address this, some countries
including [[Japan, the U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom, [and]{.mark} the
[USA]{.mark} have [appointed]{.mark} [science advisors as]{.mark}
[formal positions]{.mark} within their foreign ministries]{.underline}.
This might just be the right governance approach to extend work
internationally in close collaboration with national ministries.
[Extensive cooperation will be needed globally, as climate change is not
only international but a global issue. In the best-case scenario,
[science diplomacy can]{.mark} address the gap at the boundary of
diplomacy and science and [operationalize solutions for]{.mark} this
[socio-environmental challenge]{.mark}]{.underline}. It might also lead
to diplomacy staying up to date on the latest climate science and
therefore enhances the legitimacy of [international diplomacy, which in
turn is necessary to create the basis for fruitful, long-term
cooperation.]{.underline} Science diplomacy is consequently essential to
solving what is arguably the greatest crisis of our time. While science
informed policy is not a new concept, the findings of scientists, [as in
[science]{.mark} in [diplomacy]{.mark}, may still [need more recognition
from policy institutions and gov]{.mark}ernments [to facilitate
effective climate action]{.mark}.]{.underline} The traditional approach
of relying predominantly on science in diplomacy, in other words,
relying on scientists to inform policymakers about climate change, could
be complemented by more diplomacy for science approaches like the
approach embodied by organizations such as IIASA to fully address the
crisis. It may seem self-evident that national scientific institutes
should continue to engage in international scientific collaboration, yet
this still remains a relatively underutilized avenue. From a climate
scientist's perspective, it is worth considering that current efforts in
climate change mitigation and adaptation could benefit from further
integration by willing coalitions among research institutes and foreign
ministries. In this context, the momentum of science diplomacy that was
developed during the Cold War and has recently gained traction again,
offers many advantages for solving the complex problems we face today.

Scientific [pr[otectionism]{.underline}]{.mark} [can [slow the pace of
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}, weaken international problem-solving
capabilities, and deprive researchers of the opportunity to work across
borders on global challenges. It also undermines the potential of
science diplomacy to foster channels for understanding and peace, as
geopolitical tensions grow. [[Science]{.mark} has long [provided]{.mark}
a [channel to build peace]{.mark}]{.underline}. From the use of medical
science to solidify peace between the Egyptians and Hittites following
the Treaty of Kadesh 1300 BC, to the collaborations at CERN (the
European Organization for Nuclear Research) that helped heal the scars
of World War II, to the handshake in outer space that relaxed Cold War
tensions, [science has long demonstrated its utility [in peacekeeping
and conflict mitigatio]{.mark}n. Science has also long been a vessel
[for soft power projection]{.mark} [and public
diplomacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, many national pavilions
showcase scientific accomplishments at the World Expos. At Dubai 2020,
the US pavilion displayed a moon rock symbolizing American pioneering in
outer space, while the Moroccan pavilion exhibited the country's
contributions to various scientific fields, including archeology and

[organizations]{.mark} can [work towards smoothing tensions]{.mark}
[during]{.mark} the Israel-Palestine conflict]{.underline}. Initiatives
like the Arava Institute, which fosters Israeli-Palestinian
collaboration on environmental issues, highlight **[the unifying
potential of science to transcend the political fray.]{.underline}** The
Middle East Entrepreneurs of Tomorrow (MEET) teaches computer science
and entrepreneurship to Israeli and Palestinian students, promoting
intellectual cooperation. Similarly, the Science Training Encouraging
Peace (STEP) Program pairs Palestinian graduate students with Israeli
counterparts. [Because such efforts are often challenged by conflict,
resilience and courage are often needed to maintain them]{.underline}.
[The ongoing collaboration]{.underline} at the Synchrotron-Light for
Experimental Science and Applications [in]{.underline} the Middle East
[(SESAME)]{.underline} in Jordan [between scientists from several
countries including Iran, Israel, and Palestine further exemplifies
scientific cooperation persisting amidst political
turbulence]{.underline}. The synchrotron light source experiments
conducted at SESAME have applications for materials science, biology,
and medicine. However, perhaps the boldest development is the creation
of a common ground where knowledge and progress transcend the political
and cultural differences driven by conflict. [Scientists play
significant roles within "track II diplomacy:" non-governmental
(academic and scientific) actors facilitating dialogue and understanding
outside official government channels ("track I")]{.underline}. The Oslo
Accords are a prime example, as they established a framework for peace
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in the
1990s. Academics initially represented Israel at the Oslo talks, as
government officials were restricted from engaging with Palestinian
representatives. Despite the Accords not unfolding as anticipated[,
their initiation marked an important step in dialogue for peace and
underscored the potential of scientific and academic channels to advance
diplomacy]{.underline}. T[he EU Science Diplomacy Framework currently
has the potential to amplify the use of science and technology
capabilities in mediating conflicts through soft power]{.underline}.
This will represent a firm institutional anchoring of an often ad-hoc
phenomenon.

[There is [nowhere]{.mark} in the world that [is changing faster
than]{.mark} in [the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [climate change has
rapidly reduced sea ice]{.underline} cover. Now, [a region that once was
covered in ice most of the year is accessible for human
habitation]{.underline}, travel, and exploitation. [The [US and
Russia]{.mark} share a maritime border along the Bering Strait
and]{.underline} around [the Arctic Ocean.]{.underline} They [both
[share an interest in]{.mark}]{.underline} continued [[cooperation
on]{.mark} safeguarding [Arctic waters]{.mark}]{.underline}, ensuring
that [they can become economically beneficial for all
parties]{.underline}, while [also [pursuing]{.mark} mutually beneficial
[research]{.mark} and preserving the environment]{.underline}. Greater
[cooperation in the Arctic can also mitigate the risks of an "Arctic
arms race"]{.underline} between [NATO nations and Russia]{.underline},
turning the [region]{.underline} into a potential venue [for [conflict
and
competition](https://www.americansecurityproject.org/the-arctic-at-the-center-of-world-affairs/)]{.underline}.
[Putin]{.underline} has already [[signaled a willingness to
meet](http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/putin-ready-meet-trump-finland-hosts-summit-46462926) with
President Trump]{.underline} at a summit on Arctic issues; [the Trump
administration]{.underline} should [make the most of this
opportunity]{.underline}.

[The US and Russia]{.underline} should [pursue joint research
initiatives in the Arctic]{.underline} that would be [mutually
beneficial to both countries.]{.underline} One [possible research
initiative could be expanding support for]{.underline} the
[Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic]{.underline} (RUSALCA),
which has [been ongoing since 2004]{.underline}.

[[The Arctic holds important opportunities for]{.mark} advancing the
fields of biology, environmental [science]{.mark}, ecology, oceanography
and geology]{.underline} that could [lead to [a more robust
understanding of climate change]{.mark}, discovery of new fuel
reserves]{.underline}, and the [[improvement of best practices]{.mark}
in the fields of deep sea extraction, fishing, and
shipping]{.underline}. These [[fields]{.mark} are [likely to yield
economic and scientific benefits]{.mark} for both
countries]{.underline}, and are [not likely to have a military dimension
that would otherwise lead to further competition]{.underline}.
Historically, research [agreements have served as important platforms
for trust building]{.underline} and as [a channel for track-two talks
between the two powers]{.underline}. Expanding [the number of research
agreements would increase these diplomatic dividends]{.underline} while
[also providing beneficial research]{.underline}. The [agreements can
also function as an additional lever]{.underline} of
i[nfluence]{.underline}; judging by [significant shifts in its security
policies, Russia]{.underline} has demonstrated a [greater interest in
the Arctic than the US, which means that research agreements regarding
the Arctic are relatively]{.underline} more value [to them than to the
US. This can potentially be used as a negotiating carrot]{.underline}.

[Arctic research is difficult to militarize]{.underline} and [research
agreements]{.underline} can [be tailored to specific topics that are not
dual-use in any way]{.underline} shape or [form]{.underline}. Just as
[the US could hypothetically threaten to end a research agreement as a
foreign policy response]{.underline}, [Russia could also make similar
threats]{.underline}. Russia's [greater apparent interest in the Arctic
means that they would have relatively more]{.underline} to lose from
[ending any such agreements, which means that it would be less likely to
pursue]{.underline} such [an option.]{.underline}

New Frontiers in Science Diplomacy was written during a "golden age" of
science diplomacy that lasted almost four decades following the
U.S.-China Science and Technology Agreement in 1979.1 That era has ended
abruptly, and we are now witnessing dramatic changes in geopolitics
combined with disruptions from the pandemic, rapid technological change,
economic competition with tariffs and sanctions, climate change,
uncontrolled migration, political polarization, and wars. For science
diplomacy practitioners in the United States to contribute to overcoming
these enormous challenges will require persistent effort, new
strategies, and clear priorities. My priorities for science diplomacy
focus on advancing the U.S. national interest, but many also serve the
global interest and the worldwide advancement of science and technology
(S&T). [In attending to these priorities, [American government]{.mark}al
and non-governmental organizations [can play a critical role in
restoring public trust in S&T as enablers of peace]{.mark}, prosperity,
and security. Advise on nuclear weapons arms control [Nuclear weapons
are an existential threat]{.mark} for humanity and the
planet.]{.underline} This new era with nuclear saber rattling and
rejection of arms control treaties is as dangerous as the Cuban Missile
Crisis in 1962. It is highly likely that nuclear weapon states,
including the United States, will modernize and strengthen their nuclear
arsenals and other advanced weapons to deter nuclear attack given new
alliances of hostile nuclear states, the aggressive behavior of
autocratic leaders, and the growth in the number of countries seeking
nuclear weapons. [Non-governmental security [dialogues between American
scientific experts and those in countries]{.mark} like China, Russia,
Iran, and North Korea [should be encouraged. They can help inform
diplomatic negotiations]{.mark} as has occurred in the past. Accelerate
international scientific collaboration in fundamental research and
[attract STEM talent from around the world]{.mark} If the United States
is [to remain the world leader]{.mark} in science, technology, and
innovation, it must robustly fund its own research enterprise,
collaborate internationally in fundamental scientific research, and
attract smart, creative people for education, research, and innovation
in the U.S.]{.underline} These attributes can be sustained with policies
that set the right balance between openness and security in research.
Increase collaboration with allied nations on emerging technology One
benefit of this new era is greater political support among allied
democracies for increased funding of collaboration and joint research in
scientific fields relevant for emerging technologies. Specific areas for
emphasis include AI for advancing fundamental science, joint research
and development on critical technologies, science and security
dialogues, and "tech-diplomacy." While there are limits to cooperation
even among allies due to economic competition and domestic political
concerns, [the emphasis on moving faster together to enhance collective
security and [diplomacy is a powerful stimulus for democratic
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}. Increase foresight analysis and
dialogue Discussions with many nations on the implications of rapid
scientific and technological developments is vital to help realize
potential benefits as well as to help mitigate potential threats coming
from their applications, including misinformation, disruption, and
warfare. [[Scientific communities can collaborate]{.mark} bilaterally
and multilaterally on foresight analysis [to better understand]{.mark}
potential threats and benefits of [advanced tech]{.mark}nologies. These
collaborations can augment similar work carried out by government
intelligence, security, and research funding agencies.]{.underline}
While scientists cannot predict the future, the top experts in a field
have a head start on envisioning what the future might bring. Expand
engagement with states in competition and conflict with the United
States It is necessary to engage scientific leaders in nations viewed as
being in competition or conflict with the United States to advance areas
of mutual benefit and to serve as important channels of communication.
Maintaining ongoing dialogue between scientific leaders in the United
States and China is especially important. Bilateral engagements by
scientific, engineering, and medical academies and professional
societies are now occurring. They address global challenges as well as
the latest advances in scientific knowledge. Programs that enable future
scientific leaders to interact are equally valuable. Lead on science and
technology for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) The United
States should increase support for national and international action
plans and roadmaps to use science, technology, and innovation to
accelerate progress on all seventeen of the SDGs. Special attention
should be given to those that have the greatest potential in the
near-term to mitigate existential threats and reduce human suffering.
These include climate action, affordable clean energy, pandemic
preparedness, and peace negotiations to aid civilians affected by
conflicts and natural disasters. The national STI for SDGs roadmaps
proposed by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN-DESA)
and under development by six pilot countries illustrate how roadmaps can
stimulate action to realize aspirational goals.2 Other governmental and
non-governmental organizations can use roadmaps to help develop
consensus and make progress through concrete actions. Increase support
for emerging countries U.S. diplomacy would significantly benefit with
more government funding to help emerging countries strengthen their
national ecosystems for science, technology, innovation, science policy,
science advising, and science diplomacy. Work carried out by
international non-governmental organizations, like the International
Network for Governmental Science Advice, the InterAcademy Partnership,
and the International Science Council, as well as by some national
governments, scientific institutions, and philanthropies, are making
real contributions. The United States' non-governmental scientific
organizations are eager to do more. They are contributing as much as
they can using mostly their own funds and fund-raising, as is the case
with assisting Ukraine. More U.S. government funding to support the U.S.
scientific community to strengthen science-policy-society interfaces
around the world could help restore the reputation of U.S. science
diplomacy to the prominent level it achieved during the golden era.
Protect the global commons Increasing global dialogues on the peaceful
uses and management of increasingly contested international commons,
including the atmosphere, outer space, polar regions, and oceans, are
key areas for science diplomacy in the new era. [More [engagement of
foreign]{.mark} ministries with [scientific experts is necessary to
build consensus]{.mark} on how to manage these areas for the benefit of
all. Empower diverse actors The United States should encourage its
scientific and engineering societies, non-governmental organizations,
universities, civil society groups, subnational governments, and private
companies to develop their own roadmaps and partnerships using science
diplomacy to help advance their goals. International partnerships and
roadmaps are an effective approach to stimulate public and private
institutions to learn from similar institutions in other countries and
to take actions together.]{.underline}

1\. Introduction

Despite recent social protests and climate emergency declarations,
[efforts to mitigate climate change to date are
**insufficient**]{.underline}.1 Greenhouse gas ([GHG]{.underline})
[[emissions]{.mark} continue to [rise]{.mark} and global [warming
**above 3 °**]{.mark}**C** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[increasingly
[likely]{.mark} this century]{.underline}**.2 [There is emerging
evidence of]{.underline} amplifying [[feedbacks
**accelerating**]{.underline}]{.mark}3 and dampening feedbacks
decelerating.4 These [feedbacks [exacerbate]{.mark} the possibility of
**[runaway]{.mark}** global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline},5 [estimated
[at **8 °**]{.mark}**C**]{.underline} [or greater]{.underline} by 2100.6
Such temperature increases translate to a range of real dangers,7
shifting the narrow climate niche within which humans have resided for
millennia.8

Looking beyond the framing of "global warming", there is concern that
the [effects of ﻿ [climate change]{.mark} may [pose an ﻿ **existential
risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to humanity]{.underline}, one [that
threatens "**societal collapse**" or]{.underline} even
**[extinction]{.underline}**.9 Understanding these worst-case scenarios
is essential for good risk management.10 Improving awareness of
potential pathways through which ﻿ climate change poses such a risk can
help inform decision- making about interventions.11 Considering societal
impacts that are more tangible for individuals, businesses and
governments,12 and better ﻿ aligned with conventional risk priorities,13
may facilitate more effective action to mitigate ﻿ climate change.14

A number of pathways through which ﻿ climate change could cause societal
collapse have been identified, one being via food insecurity.15
[[Climate]{.mark} change]{.underline} is predicted to [[undermine
**ag**]{.mark}**ricultural** systems [and disrupt **food**]{.mark}
**supply**]{.underline},16 [[which]{.mark} may [lead to **economic**
shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[socio- political]{.underline}**
[instability]{.underline}]{.mark} [as well as
**starvation**]{.underline}, **[[migration]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and
conflict at]{.mark} local through to **[global
scale]{.mark}**]{.underline}.17 [While]{.underline} the [climate
**science**]{.underline} underpinning global warming estimates [is well
established]{.underline},18 albeit subject to sensitivities, the
[uncertainties increase **significantly**]{.underline} [when
we]{.underline} start to [consider]{.underline} these [tangible societal
impacts]{.underline} given the complex relationships involved.19 [Our
[understanding of worst-case scenarios]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} particularly of empirical evidence addressing the
[causal pathways]{.underline} through which ﻿ climate change may cause
societal collapse, [[is]{.underline}
**[underdeveloped]{.underline}**]{.mark}.20

In this chapter we aim to identify and structure an empirical evidence
base of the relationships between ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse. We do this using Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD), a system
dynamics approach that is useful for visualising the relationships
between variables in a complex system.21 This chapter is organised as
follows. In Section 2, we review the societal collapse and ﻿ existential
risk literature to refine the aim introduced above. In Section 3, we
develop an original methodology to establish a new empirical evidence
base and create a novel-format CLD of causal pathways between ﻿ climate
change and societal collapse. In Section 4, we present and discuss the
results from the application of this methodology to the ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway of interest. We
conclude, in Section 5, by identifying avenues of future work that may
build upon this chapter.

2\. Literature Review

To refine the aim of this chapter, introduced in Section 1, our review
examines whether there is historical evidence of ﻿ climate change as a
mechanism of societal collapse and to what extent have causal pathways
been documented to inform our understanding of ﻿ climate change as an
existential threat to contemporary society.

We first define the terms "﻿ existential risk" and "societal collapse" as
used in this chapter. Adopting ﻿ Ord's definition, "an ﻿ existential risk
is a risk that threatens the destruction of humanity's long-term
potential" be it incomplete destruction, such as societal collapse, or
complete destruction, such as extinction.22 Adopting Kemp's definition,
[societal collapse]{.underline} is an "enduring loss of ﻿ population,
identity \[and/or institutional\] complexity";23 it [may be **abrupt**
or gradual]{.underline}, [but is typically **rapid**]{.underline}
because it is notably transformative, [and may be experienced
by]{.underline} a local, national or [the **global community** of
people]{.underline}. Fig. 1 presents a conceptual model of societal
collapse, synthesised from the broader literature, to provide further
contextual definition.

[\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]]{.underline}

The rise and fall of civilisations has been documented since the
earliest recordings of history and is increasingly studied to inform our
understanding of societal collapse.24 We consider two types of
historical studies that provide insight into ﻿ climate change as a
mechanism of societal collapse in the past. We note that other
mechanisms are also discussed in the literature, and there is debate
about the role of different mechanisms in particular societal collapse
events.

The first type of historical study empirically investigates an
individual societal collapse event using primary sources, including
anthropological, archaeological and paleontological data. Based on such
data analysis, natural ﻿ [climate change has been]{.underline} asserted
as [a mechanism of societal collapse in]{.underline}
**[many]{.underline}** of these [case studies]{.underline}, as
established by de Menocal25 and Weiss and Bradley.26 For example, Hodell
et al.,27 Haug et al.,28 and Medina-Elizalde and Rohling29 analyse
paleoclimate data alongside the [archaeological record]{.underline} to
[show]{.underline} that [drought]{.underline} conditions, [driven by ﻿
climate change]{.underline} likely due to solar forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the **[collapse]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline}
Classic **[Maya]{.underline}** [civilisation]{.underline} of Mesoamerica
in \~8--10th century CE. Weiss et al.,30 Cullen et al.,31 and Cookson et
al.32 show that [regional aridity]{.underline}, [driven by ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} likely due to ﻿ volcanic forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the [collapse of]{.underline} multiple [societies
**across Mesopotamia**]{.underline}, including the Akkadian Empire in
\~22nd century BCE. Similarly, natural ﻿ [climate change has been
implicated in]{.underline} the [collapse of multiple Late Bronze Age
societies]{.underline} around the Mediterranean,33 [including
**Mycenaean** Kingdoms]{.underline} in \~12th century BCE,34 the
Harappan Civilization of South Asia in \~19th century BCE,35 the Angkor
Empire of Southeast Asia in \~15th century CE,36 **[multiple Chinese
Dynasties]{.underline}**37 [and civilisations along the Silk
Road]{.underline}38 during the previous millennium, [the Norse
Vikings]{.underline} of Greenland in \~16th century AD,39 and the
Tiwanaku Empire of Pre- Columbian South America in \~10th century CE40
amongst others.

This first type of studies establishes precedence of natural ﻿ climate
change as a mechanism of societal collapse throughout history,
demonstrating the risk that anthropogenic ﻿ climate change similarly
poses to contemporary society. However, the events examined occurred
more than 100 years ago, with most dating back to ancient history, when
societies were relatively isolated. Because these case studies pre- date
contemporary society, they do not provide empirical evidence of
anthropogenic ﻿ climate change in context of today's highly
interconnected society.41

Statistical evaluation of the frequency and significance of natural ﻿
climate change relative to other mechanisms of societal collapse
identified across these case studies has not yet been established within
the literature. However, the second type of historical study does
qualitatively examine collections of these case studies to develop
theories of predominant modes of societal collapse. Three major modes
are observed, as follows.

Fagan42 and McMichael43 focus on natural impact on the human system
across multiple civilisations, concluding that natural ﻿ climate change
is predominant having significantly influenced human existence
throughout history. [Over]{.underline} the past [12,000
years]{.underline}, the [natural and human systems developed within the
**stable climate niche**]{.underline} [of the Holocene]{.underline}
Epoch.44 The associated geographic endowments governed human transition
from band societies based on foraging to complex societies based on
agriculture. Unfavourable subtle (e.g. weather variations) and drastic
(e.g. natural disasters) shifts in climate influenced the collapse of
complex societies either by direct loss of life or indirectly via
resource insecurity. In particular, in this mode, typically, the loss of
agriculture led to de-﻿ population via famine, migration or conflict due
to food insecurity.

Ponting,45 Wright,46 and Diamond47 focus on human impact on the natural
system across multiple civilisations, concluding that human
overpopulation and overexploitation relative to the carrying capacity of
the environment is predominant. [Societal collapse via environmental
degradation]{.underline} often [involved **unsustainable**]{.underline}
[agriculture]{.underline}, [exacerbated by]{.underline} natural ﻿
[climate change]{.underline}, [leading to de-﻿ population as well as
**institutional breakdown**]{.underline} [via loss of **economic
stability**]{.underline} [and socio-political
**dysfunction**]{.underline} due to magnified inequality.
[This]{.underline} mode [aligns with]{.underline} early "Malthusian ﻿
catastrophe",48 "tragedy of the commons",49 and "**[overshoot-and-
collapse]{.underline}**"50 theories.

In their 12-volume magnum opus exploring the rise and fall of 28
civilizations, Toynbee concludes that "[great civilizations are not
murdered]{.underline} \[[but]{.underline} rather\] they [take their
**own lives**]{.underline}."51 Building on this, Tainter,52 Acemoglu and
Robinson,53 and Johnson54 focus on human impact on the human system
across multiple civilisations, concluding that societal complexity in
relation to problem-solving inability (e.g. environmental degradation)
and institutional dysfunction (e.g. inequality and oligarchy internally,
trade ally and hostile neighbour relations externally) is predominant.
As a society becomes more complex, it reaches a point beyond which
"continued investment in complexity as a problem-solving strategy yields
a declining marginal return" and it will be at risk of collapsing under
its own weight via institutional breakdown and de-﻿ population.55 This
mode aligns with "energy returned on energy invested" theory,56 applied
to explore societal collapse by Homer-Dixon.57

Diamond,58 Turchin,59 and Schwartz and Nichols60 examine why some
civilisations have been able to thrive or recover, rather than collapse.
They similarly conclude that societies have flourished due to
combinations of favourable geographic endowment, managing their
existence within the carrying capacity of the natural system, and
co-operative action in problem-solving.

This second type of studies highlights that societal collapse involves a
complex nexus of factors and dynamically interlinked events. For
instance, Gibbon details how all three of the modes, described in the
preceding five paragraphs, contributed to the collapse of the ﻿ Roman
Empire.61 These modes of societal collapse, although based on empirical
evidence pre-dating contemporary society, describe key aspects of the
anthropogenic ﻿ climate change problem faced today. While these studies
describe causal pathways of relevance, to the best of our knowledge, no
study has used CLDs to untangle the complexity and give structure to the
dense information in this evidence base.

Across these historical studies, we observe no apparent temporal or
spatial influence on the occurrence of societal collapse. Rather,
societal collapse has been described as occurring in various forms,
whether it be by known "white-swan" or surprise "black swan" events,62
in different geographic locations and times throughout history.
Additionally, a quantitative statistical analysis by Arbesman shows that
societal collapse has occurred randomly and independent of civilisation
life- spans.63 These qualitative and quantitative observations highlight
that any society may be susceptible to collapse, much in-line with the
Red Queen Hypothesis of the Law of Extinction.

From these historical studies, we observe sets of secondary determinants
for each of the primary determinants introduced in Fig. 1, which are
defined in Fig. 2. Considering a geographically bounded society,
emigration refers to any permanent departure of ﻿ population including
both voluntary or forced migration, conflict mortality accounts for
deaths directly arising from any form of domestic or international
conflict (e.g. due to ﻿ war), and natural mortality accounts for deaths
related to domestic environmental conditions (e.g. due to famine). The
loss of socio-cultural norms, political structures or economic value
accounts for that which notably transforms the identity and institutions
of the society.

[\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]]{.underline}

In addition to these historical studies, we consider the relatively
nascent studies of existential risks (X-risks) that provide insight into
how ﻿ climate change may trigger societal collapse in the future.

Comprehensive surveys of X-risks reveal mechanisms that could cause the
collapse of contemporary society. Bostrom and Ćirković,65 ﻿ Rees,66 and
Ord67 provide eminent scholarly treatment of the field, drawing from the
academic literature. The World Economic Forum68 and Global Challenges
Foundation69 produce global risk reports drawing from decision-makers
and experts across intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations.
These surveys establish that [many **historically**]{.underline}
[observed mechanisms of societal collapse]{.underline},
**[including]{.underline}** natural [﻿]{.underline} [climate
change]{.underline}, [remain applicable as X-risks today]{.underline}.
However, the ﻿ state of existence of contemporary society has led to a
different landscape in which these mechanisms apply, and to a number of
unprecedented mechanisms, including anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. ﻿
Ehrlich and ﻿ Ehrlich70 and Häggström71 note that [although [increased
**complexity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such as globalisation and ﻿
tech]{.underline}nological advancement, [can increase a society's
**resilience** and **adaptability**]{.underline}, [it can also [increase
﻿**vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, globalisation
increases resilience to local agricultural production shocks through
access to global markets; however, it also increases ﻿ vulnerability
through ﻿ exposure to sudden reversal in connectivity, such as trade
restrictions.72 Some **[geoengineering technologies]{.underline}**, for
example, [may enable society to mitigate]{.underline} and adapt to ﻿
[climate change]{.underline}; [however]{.underline}, [they
may]{.underline} also **[increase ﻿ vulnerability]{.underline}** [to ﻿
**termination shocks**]{.underline}, [where **failure**]{.underline} [of
the technology exposes society to **sudden temperature
increases**]{.underline}.73 [[In this]{.mark} highly [**interconnected**
landscape]{.mark}]{.underline},
"**[[synchronous]{.underline}]{.mark}**"74 and
"**[[cascading]{.underline}]{.mark}**"75 [[failures
create]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential for]{.underline}]{.mark}
mechanisms and outcomes of [societal [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline},
[once contained to a single]{.underline} localised
[civilisation]{.underline}, [[to **rapidly spread**]{.underline}
[across]{.underline}]{.mark} multiple [nations and impact humanity on [a
**global scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Works by Lynas,76 Wallace-Wells77 and Gowdy78 draw on the scientific ﻿
climate change literature to explore hypothetical futures under best- to
worst-case scenarios. The scenarios consider the feedbacks within the
natural system that could worsen, as well as the potential for humans to
mitigate, anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. [Shifts in]{.underline} average
weather (e.g. [temperature]{.underline}) [and natural
disasters]{.underline} (e.g. floods) affected by ﻿ climate change [could
impact human mortality **directly**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline}
two effects, [coupled with sea level rise]{.underline} due to melting of
ice caps, [could indirectly impact human mortality via
degradation]{.underline} [of the natural world]{.underline} system
([e.g. land quality]{.underline}) [and the human world]{.underline}
system ([e.g. ﻿ **infrastructure failures**]{.underline}) [resulting in
**resource**]{.underline} and service **[insecurity]{.underline}**.
[This insecurity could impact **institutional stability**]{.underline},
[resulting in economic loss]{.underline}, [political dysfunction and
social **unrest**]{.underline}, [as well as migration and
**conflict**]{.underline}. The hypothetical outcomes for contemporary
society against the threat of anthropogenic ﻿ climate change range from
dystopian (collapse) to utopian (recovery).

These futures studies identify endpoints of different causal pathways
between anthropogenic ﻿ climate change effects and potential impacts on
the human world system, with the latter reflecting key determinants of
societal collapse observed in the historical studies. Scholars have made
limited in-roads to empirically investigating the top-level
relationships between some of these endpoints using recent datasets. The
direct links between ﻿ climate change and the endpoint impacts of
mortality, conflict and migration are, respectively, examined by Mora et
al.,79 Hsiang et al.80 and Hauer et al.81 The feedback between migration
and conflict driven by climate change is examined by Abel et al.82 The
direct links between ﻿ climate change and the endpoint impacts of
economic loss, political instability and shifts in cultural norms are
examined by Burke et al.,83 Sofuoğlu and Ay,84 and Adger et al.85
respectively. However, the complex bottom-level links between and
surrounding these endpoints are generally ill understood,86 and the
strength of empirical evidence is poorly documented from a systems
science perspective.87 To the best of our knowledge, **[no
study]{.underline}** has [empirically examined how the impacts of ﻿
climate change could explicitly translate into societal collapse for
**contemporary** society]{.underline}. [We **do not have a clear
picture**]{.underline} [of ﻿ climate change as a ﻿ **systemic risk** to
our globalised society]{.underline}, particularly at spatial scales
accounting for the heterogeneity of individual identity, business
governance and policymaking across nations, and international exchanges.
This limits our ability to understand feedbacks, identify intervention
points, develop quantitative models and inform strategies to minimise
the risk of societal collapse occurring in the future.88

Given the insights from this review, we refine the aim of this chapter
as follows. Firstly, the empirical evidence base should specifically
address contemporary society. Secondly, the CLD should be constructed at
a scale and granularity that addresses the heterogenous characteristics
of nations and international interactions. The refined aim of this
chapter is thus to identify an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate
change, food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society
and structure the evidence base with a CLD defined at global scale and
national granularity.

3\. Methodology

A two-stage framework, consisting of five steps, was developed to
achieve the aim of this chapter. For each step, below, we first
introduce it generically and then describe its application to our
specific analysis of the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway.

3.1. Stage 1: Establishing an empirical evidence base of societal
collapse in contemporary society

Step I deploys societal collapse proxies via a key word search to
identify "evidence points", which in this instance may be considered
data points, in the form of publications that empirically examine the
causal pathway of interest in contemporary society.

The determinants defined in Fig. 2 provide these societal collapse
proxies to establish the new empirical evidence base in lieu of
historical societal collapse events pre-dating contemporary society. The
﻿population loss set are straightforward to isolate, consistent to
measure across nations and describe tangible consequences. The
institutional breakdown set are relatively less so. Thus, the societal
collapse proxies adopted in this study were natural mortality (i.e.
starvation, with respect to food insecurity), conflict mortality and
emigration; subsequent studies could use the institutional breakdown
set. Key words were selected based on terminology of ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and the societal collapse proxies. Peer-reviewed journal
articles were chosen as the form of evidence point in this study;
subsequent studies could use other publications, such as books and
reports.

The keyword search was performed in Scopus. A record of the search is
contained in the Supplementary Information (A.). Approximately 3,000
publications were reviewed by reading the title, abstract and main body
as needed. Evidence points were selected based on satisfaction of the
following criteria: the publication (a) is a peer-reviewed, English-
language, journal article; (b) uses empirical, data driven methods; (c)
examines the period from 1990 to present (2019), representative of
contemporary society; and (d) primarily examines the causal pathway of
interest. We made an exception to (a) to include the most recent Limits
to Growth book,89 which was not itself a search result but documents the
World3 model that was identified in the search results. We note that (b)
precluded selection of review or essay-style publications; however, we
found that these were often discussed in the literature review of
selected evidence points, so were, nonetheless, accounted for
indirectly.

This step resulted in a new empirical evidence base consisting of 41
evidence points, which are summarised in Fig. 4.

Step II defines a custom colour-coded typology for the new empirical
evidence base. This typology is used in Stage 2, to construct a final
CLD (f-CLD) in a novel format showing the spread of the evidence base
across the system.

In this study, we were interested in the methodological spread as this
provides information on data that may be useful for future studies. Four
methodological categories were identified in the new empirical evidence
base. Each evidence point was classified into one of these categories
and assigned a colour coding, namely: quantitative ﻿ complex systems
model --- red; statistical analysis of quantitative dataset --- blue;
collection / analysis of qualitative interview / survey data --- green;
quantitative data-led case study / scenario --- yellow.

The resulting typology of the new empirical evidence base is shown in
Fig. 4.

3.2. Stage 2: Constructing a novel-format causal loop diagram from the
empirical evidence base

Step III involves creating an individual CLD (i-CLD) for each evidence
point to clearly structure the complex causal relationships examined.
These i-CLDs provide the building blocks from which to construct the
f-CLD in Step IV.

[\[FIGURE 3 REMOVED\]]{.underline}

The process to create an i-CLD is as follows. The corresponding evidence
point was examined in its entirety to identify and record key
information in the form of variables (nodes), links (arrowed lines) and
relationship notation (positive or negative). Key information derived
from the original data-driven content, i.e. the main analysis, of the
evidence point was colour coded in the i-CLD according to the typology
classification established in Step II. Any relationships hypothesised
but not supported by the main analysis were coloured grey. Key
information derived from other content, i.e. the literature review, of
the evidence point was coloured black. The scale and granularity of the
i-CLD was recorded as detailed in the evidence point. This process was
repeated for each evidence point in isolation until a complete set of
i-CLDs was produced for the new empirical evidence base.

All 41 i-CLDs created in this study are contained in the Supplementary
Information (B.). One of the i-CLDs is shown in Fig. 3 as an example.
Step IV reconciles the set of i-CLDs into a standardised format in order
to construct the f-CLD of the system of interest at the desired scale
and granularity.

The standardisation process has two aspects. One aspect is related to
component (variables and links) definition, necessary to maximise
clarity of the f-CLD while covering all information contained in the
evidence base. This addresses the typical challenge of CLDs becoming
dense and overcomplicated, which decreases their ﻿ utility. The other
aspect is related to level of aggregation, necessary to ensure the f-CLD
conveys information at the intended scale and granularity. The
standardisation is an iterative process, as follows.

The \~950 variables from the set of 41 i-CLDs were recorded on a blank
worksheet for the f-CLD, without links between them. A clustering
approach was used to reconcile these variables into like groups. For
each group, an overarching major node was isolated and the i-CLD
variables in the group were virtually deposited into a matrix for that
major node. For example, drought, sea level rise and crop disease were
some of the i-CLD variables clustered into an environmental risk factors
f-CLD major node matrix. The f-CLD major nodes were defined at a level
of aggregation representative of a nation. Doing so effectively scaled
down any global or regional aggregation, and scaled up any sub-national
or local aggregation, in the i-CLD variables. For example, household
food imports was an i-CLD variable of local aggregation that was scaled
up to national food imports (trade) in the f-CLD.

The \~1150 links from the set of 41 i-CLDs were reconciled into arrowed
lines between the major nodes in the f-CLD. This sometimes- required
interpretation of implied causality in the i-CLD relationships in order
to route them across the major nodes in the f-CLD. For example, where an
i-CLD showed a direct link from international food price to conflict
variables, this was routed using arrowed lines from international food
price to national food price to food ﻿ accessibility to food insecurity
and finally to conflict major nodes defined in the f-CLD. Where there
was a discrepancy between relationship descriptions, the relationship
with the most supporting i-CLDs was adopted.

The interim f-CLD produced at the end of each standardisation iteration
was examined to determine whether the major node definition could be
refined to maximise clarity. For example, in one iteration water and
land were defined as separate major nodes, but examination determined
that each had the same arrowed lines to other major nodes; therefore,
another iteration was undertaken with water and land now clustered under
a single natural resources major node in order to minimise redundant
arrowed lines. This process was iterated several times until an f-CLD
had been constructed at an appropriate level of detail for this study.
Additionally, relevant literature reviewed in Section 290 was cross-
referenced, but not included as evidence points, to ensure comprehensive
coverage of key relationships in the f-CLD.

The standard-format f-CLD, consisting of uncoloured and unweighted
components, resulting at the end of this step is contained in the
Supplementary Information (C.).

Step V maps each i-CLD to the f-CLD using a weighted (line thickness)
typology (colour-coded) approach. This visually documents the spread of
the evidence base across the system described by the f-CLD.

The process to map an i-CLD to the f-CLD is as follows. Each variable
(node) of the i-CLD was assigned to its corresponding major node(s) in
the f-CLD. Each link (arrowed line) of the i-CLD was assigned to a
corresponding route along the arrowed lines in the f-CLD. Each time an
arrowed line in the f-CLD had an i-CLD link assigned to it, an
incremental weighting of one-unit line thickness in the corresponding
typology colour-coding of the i-CLD link was added to the f-CLD arrowed
line. This process was repeated for each of the 41 i-CLDs until all had
been mapped to the f-CLD. A record of this process for each of the 41
i-CLDs is contained in the Supplementary Information (D.).

The novel-format f-CLD, consisting of colour-coded and weighted
components, resulting at the end of this final step is presented in Fig.
5.

4\. Results and Discussion

The new empirical evidence base and novel-format CLD of ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society resulting
from the application of our original methodology (Section 3) are
discussed in turn below.

4.1. Empirical evidence base of climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse in contemporary society

The new empirical evidence base (Section 3, Step I), along with its
colour-coded typology (Section 3, Step II), is presented in Fig. 4. It
consists of 41 evidence points, of which 9 examine the natural mortality
(i.e. starvation, with respect to food insecurity), 20 the conflict
mortality and 12 the emigration societal collapse proxy, alongside other
human and natural world system factors. We discuss three key aspects of
the evidence base, namely temporal and spatial distribution, data-driven
method distribution, and advantages of each data-driven methods, below.

The temporal scale and granularity of study varies across the evidence
base; however, our methodology limited the possible scale of study to
the period from 1990 to present, representative of contemporary society.
Within this period, approximately half of the evidence points cover a
scale of less than one decade and the other half a scale of greater than
one decade. Approximately half of the evidence points conduct analyses
at yearly granularity and the other half conduct analyses at granularity
greater than one year, with only a few studies conducting analyses at
monthly granularity. The spatial scale and granularity of study varies
across the evidence base. Approximately one third of the evidence points
investigate the system at a global scale, with the remaining two thirds
focusing on regional or national scales, primarily in Africa as well as
the Middle East and Asia. Approximately half of the evidence points
analyse the causal pathway at sub-national granularity, with the other
half primarily focusing on national-level granularity. This variation
provided different coverage of the complex relationships within the
system, which was informative for constructing our CLD.

The distribution of data-driven methods used across the evidence base is
notably different for each societal collapse proxy. Evidence points for
natural mortality mostly use collection/analysis of interview/ survey
data. This is likely because the minimum daily food intake for human
survival is well established;91 as such, statistical analysis of food
and mortality data sets would not yield significantly new insights into
thresholds whereas interviews/surveys can provide insight into an
individual's circumstances influencing this relationship. Evidence
points for conflict mortality mostly use statistical analysis of
existing datasets. This likely reflects the interest in rigorously
curated conflict datasets, such as UCDP/PRIO,92 across the conflict and
peace fields. Evidence points for emigration mostly use
collection/analysis of interview/survey data, likely because this
provides nuanced insight into an individual's decision to migrate. It
may also be due to data availability and quality challenges that limit
quantitative statistical analyses, which are being addressed by groups
such as the International Organization for Migration's Global Migration
Data Analysis Centre.93 Amongst these data challenges, it is important
to recognise the issue of reconciling different types of voluntary and
forced migration with causal drivers, given the complex social, economic
and political factors at play; this challenge similarly applies to the
other societal collapse proxies but is particularly noted in the
migration studies. We observe from these studies that a food insecurity
threshold for natural mortality is well established but thresholds for
conflict mortality and emigration are not. Indeed, distinguishing causal
drivers within datasets and defining quantitative thresholds for these
determinants remains a "grand challenge".94

[\[FIGURE 4 REMOVED\]]{.underline}

Each data-driven method offers different advantages. The ﻿ complex ﻿
systems models each describe "chunks" of the system at different scale
and granularity. The models provide mathematical definition, are ﻿
calibrated to real-world data and enable quantitative simulation of key
relationships in the system. The statistical analyses quantitatively
examine relationships between a dependent variable and one or more
independent variables within the system, which can be used as a
mathematical basis for extending ﻿ modelling capabilities. The
collection/ analysis of interview/survey data provides insight into
qualitative aspects of human perspective and decision-making that
quantitative data sets cannot provide directly. The data-led case
study/scenarios combine quantitative data with qualitative expert
interpretation to better understand global trends and ﻿ forecasts. These
latter two methods can also be used to inform the development of ﻿
modelling capabilities, the scenarios analysed by such models and their
application in decision- making processes. Collectively, these different
data-driven methods can yield useful insights into the nuances of
relationships in the system of interest.

4.2. Causal loop diagram of the climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse in contemporary society at global scale and national
granularity

The main result of this chapter is the CLD (the f-CLD from Section 3,
Step V), presented in Fig. 5. It structures the relationships between ﻿
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse as described in
our new empirical evidence base (presented in Fig. 4 and discussed in
Section 4.1). We discuss three key aspects of the CLD, namely insights
related to the spread of empirical evidence, the qualitative ﻿ complex
system depicted, and quantitative ﻿ complex system ﻿ modelling, below,
alongside consideration of well-established benefits and limitations of
CLDs.

Our CLD is presented in a novel format that documents the spread of our
empirical evidence base. We use line thickness and colour, respectively,
to depict the density and type of the data-driven methods used by the
empirical evidence points to analyse a given link between two variables.

Doing this aids comprehension of where existing work has been focused
with respect to the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway. It may also help with the identification of
gaps in existing analyses. For example, we can see that the link between
food insecurity and conflict has been investigated mostly by evidence
points using statistical analyses (blue), whereas the links between food
insecurity and migration, and food insecurity and natural mortality,
have been investigated mostly by evidence points using
interviews/surveys (green). This hints that it may be useful to
investigate the former using quantitative statistics, and the latter
using qualitative interviews/surveys, to gain further insights offered
by the different data-driven methods as described in Section 4.1.

It is important to recognise that our CLD may show negligible density
for important links or even be missing important variables and/or links,
either because they have not yet been studied or because our key word
search failed to identify evidence points that have studied them. For
example, our study focused on the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse causal pathway, so the density of our empirical
evidence is concentrated along links central to this pathway, whereas
the links between peripheral variables in the system, such as between
fertility and births, show a lower density of empirical evidence.
Similarly, our use of the ﻿ population loss set of societal collapse
proxies means that the evidence base details natural mortality, conflict
mortality and emigration, whereas the institutional breakdown set are
not detailed. In considering this issue, our methodology attempted to
maximise the ﻿ rigour and transparency of our study by documenting the
spread of our empirical evidence base to help make the reader aware of
exactly how much and what type of evidence was supporting the CLD
presented here.

Further, we can see that while empirical studies have linked ﻿ climate
change via food insecurity to our societal collapse proxies of natural
mortality, conflict mortality and emigration, we found no empirical
studies linking these proxies to the explicit term of societal collapse.
This was expected given the motivation of this study (Section 1) and is
due to the fact that there are no contemporary events of societal
collapse, under the same definition as those in the historical studies
pre-dating contemporary society, that enable these links to be
empirically studied.95

Having considered the spread of empirical evidence, we now consider the ﻿
complex system documented. A key benefit of CLDs is that they simply
present a myriad of information in a single diagram; in doing so, CLDs
enable comprehension of the structure and behaviour of ﻿ complex systems,
including feedbacks, intervention points and far- reaching
interdependencies.96 Our CLD visually depicts a system of 39 variables,
105 links and 32,000 feedback loops,97 integrating information from
different fields including climate science, ﻿ food security, conflict,
migration and health research.

Walking through the CLD at a high-level, we can see how ﻿ population
growth and lifestyle emissions, influenced by institutional/demographic
factors (e.g. emission reduction incentives), combine to directly drive ﻿
climate change. Similarly, they indirectly drive ﻿ climate change via
consumer demand on food production, which produces emissions directly
(e.g. ruminant livestock) and indirectly via industrial capital/ output
(e.g. processing factories). The environmental risk factors (e.g.
extreme weather events) of ﻿ climate change may cause losses of food
production either directly (e.g. plant disease) or indirectly via
agricultural input availability (e.g. loss of water source for
irrigation). A country's food availability is influenced by domestic
food production and international food trade. Food ﻿ accessibility is
influenced by its food price, which responds to domestic (e.g. cost of
food production and distribution) and international (e.g. international
food price) markets, and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. food
subsidies). Food utilisation is influenced by ﻿ infrastructure/services
(e.g. ﻿ education) and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. cultural
traditions). Food insecurity is underpinned by these three pillars of
food availability, food ﻿ accessibility and food utilisation. For a given
country, food insecurity can drive natural mortality (i.e. starvation),
conflict and migration, contributing to ﻿ population loss, as well as
economic shocks and socio- political instability, contributing to
institutional breakdown, which exacerbates the risk of societal
collapse.

[Beyond]{.underline} a given country suffering [increased natural
mortality]{.underline}, [famines]{.underline} (i.e. [food
insecurity]{.underline}) [can place pressure on international
humanitarian efforts]{.underline} ([i.e. **institutional** risk
factors]{.underline}). [Conflict may occur domestically or
**internationally**]{.underline} [and can **feedback**]{.underline} [to
**exacerbate**]{.underline} [food insecurity and institutional
fragility]{.underline} (i.e. institutional risk factors). Potential
[mass emigration can increase **pressure** on food
availability]{.underline}, [natural resources and ﻿
infrastructure/services in the destination nation]{.underline}, which
can lead to socio- cultural tensions (i.e. institutional risk factors)
that fuel conflict. [Food insecurity can]{.underline} also
**[directly]{.underline}** [contribute to]{.underline} institutional
risk factors such as [social unrest, political instability and economic
inequality]{.underline}, [which increase the risk of societal collapse
due to **institutional breakdown**]{.underline}, [that may also ﻿
**cascade internationally**]{.underline}. [While already fragile ﻿ states
are **expected**]{.underline} [to be hit the worst
**directly**]{.underline}, these [insights reveal the **indirect**
ramifications of ﻿ climate change on our **globalised
society**]{.underline},98 [with **serious consequences**]{.underline}
[for **humanity's "existential security".**]{.underline}99

[While some of these relationships may appear **obvious**]{.underline},
it is the act of [**bringing** this information]{.underline}, [which may
otherwise be **siloed**]{.underline} and thus preventing consideration
of the full story, **[together]{.underline}** [in one place]{.underline}
that [is of value]{.underline}.100 In doing so, our CLD attempts to
provide readers with the opportunity to explore the ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway, consider
worst-case scenarios that we want to avoid, develop transformative
narratives of "where we want to go" and think about interventions that
may help us attain this desired future.101

It is important to appreciate that CLDs are only as good as their
information inputs; our CLD documents relationships based on information
portrayed in our empirical evidence base as well as our interpretation
of that information. As such, there exist challenges and limitations.102
For instance, CLDs may mask variability of relationships in different
contexts and locations, because they can only depict a single scale and
granularity. The portrayal of explicit causality between variables in a
CLD is a challenge as this can often work in both directions rather than
one. CLDs can often become either too complicated or too simplified,
which undermines their usefulness. In considering each of these issues,
our original methodology attempted to maximise the ﻿ rigour and
transparency of our study by first documenting the information in each
evidence point with an i-CLD and then consistently applying, and
recording, the iterative process of reconciling the variables and links
from each i-CLD to construct the f-CLD at the selected global scale and
national granularity. In doing so, we sought to enable the reader to be
aware of the nuances of the different scales and granularity of
information underpinning our CLD, as well as our process of carefully
reconciling causality, over 950 variables to 39 variables and 1150 links
to 105 links to maximise the information conveyed while balancing
readability.

It is also important to note that, due to their qualitative and static ﻿
nature, CLDs do not enable us to comprehend the dynamics of the system,
including nonlinear and emergent behaviour, non-intuitive quantitative
results and time delays.103 Complex systems models, although with their
own challenges and limitations,104 provide the opportunity to
quantitatively analyse the dynamics of a system and gain insights into
the potentially far-reaching impacts of our decisions.105 However, ﻿
complex ﻿ systems models that explicitly examine societal collapse in
contemporary society are underdeveloped. The World3 system dynamics
model106 --- an evidence point in this study (refer to Supplementary
Information D).107 --- is the eminent model of relevance, with only a
limited number of studies building on it. World3 examines the potential
for "overshoot-and-collapse" given ﻿ population and industrial growth
within the finite carrying capacity of the natural world system,
implicitly accounting for ﻿ climate change and explicitly accounting for
food availability.

The information contained in our CLD and empirical evidence base may be
useful in identifying and informing opportunities to improve these
existing ﻿ complex systems ﻿ modelling capabilities for ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse scenarios. For example, our CLD
highlights important factors at global scale and national granularity
that World3 does not incorporate because it is defined at global scale
and granularity.108 World3 does not distinguish heterogenous
characteristics of nations, such as distribution of ﻿ population or
geographic endowment of natural resources. It also does not account for
international interactions, such as food trade, conflict and migration.
Relatedly, World3 evaluates societal collapse only by natural mortality
(defined by food availability, age and pollution) and does not include
the other two ﻿ population loss secondary determinants, as noted in the
previous sentence, nor the three institutional breakdown secondary
determinants. While our empirical evidence base may provide useful
direction to datasets, it is important to note that quantitatively
defining these relationships, particularly thresholds as discussed in
Section 4.1, remains a key challenge of developing ﻿ complex ﻿ systems
models. Nonetheless, given that individuals associate with national
identity, business governance and policy-making are concentrated at
national level, and international interactions underpin the functioning
of contemporary society it could be valuable to model societal collapse
risk profiles of different nations to inform the prioritisation and
development of intervention strategies.

5\. Conclusions and Future Work

This chapter identified an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society and
structured the evidence base using a novel-format CLD defined at global
scale and national granularity.

Two types of future work could extend from the results of this chapter.
Identification of gaps in the spread of evidence across the CLD may
guide future data-driven efforts to examine these causal relationships
and define thresholds. The CLD and evidence base may be used to develop
quantitative ﻿ modelling capabilities, particularly by transforming the
structure of World3 to account for heterogenous national characteristics
and international interactions. Three types of future work could extend
from the methodology and literature synthesis. The causal pathway
examined in this chapter could be further detailed by re-applying the
methodology using the institutional breakdown set of societal collapse
proxies instead of the ﻿ population loss set. The methodology, using
either set of societal collapse proxies, could be applied to detail
other causal pathways between ﻿ climate change and societal collapse. The
methodology, excluding the contemporary time- period limitation, could
be applied to document the information in the historical studies
identified in the literature review. Similarly, the methodology could be
applied to construct CLDs at different scales and granularities.

It is hoped that this chapter has contributed to developing our
understanding of the causal pathways through which ﻿ climate change poses
an ﻿ existential risk to humanity and facilitates opportunities for
future work.

[\[CHAPTER 14 BEGINS\]]{.underline}

Highlights:

• In this short chapter the authors draw on several research strands and
papers within CSER to offer a theoretical reflection on how to think
about catastrophic climate change and what Existential Risk Studies can
learn from climate change research.

• [This is **intended to build** on the **previous
chapter**]{.underline}, [in which Catherine Richards]{.underline},
Richard Lupton, and Julian Allwood [provide an empirical assessment of
one **highly concerning**]{.underline} [risk cascade]{.underline}
involving climate change and highlight its potential contribution to
global catastrophic and existential risk.

• Climate change is one of the most empirically well-studied risks and
has deep links to pre-existing bodies of literature, such as disaster
risk management, environmental studies, and food security.

• Drawing on these studies and more, the chapter reflects on how to
frame research questions in existential risk, what causes catastrophic
climate change to be neglected by climate and existential risk
researchers alike, and how to incorporate assessments of response risk
and co-benefits into thinking about catastrophic climate change.

This short chapter brings together a number of important ideas and draws
readers attention to other extant bodies of literature. The relative
value of ﻿ co-benefits approaches is discussed in other chapters in this
volume, including Chapter 4, in more detail. The dangers of ﻿ response
risks are further discussed in Chapter 2.

1\. [Asking the **Wrong Questions** for the **Right
Reasons**]{.underline}

**[Within]{.underline}** [Existential Risk Studies it is common to
hear]{.underline} people ask [the question "[is ﻿ climate change]{.mark}
an ﻿ [existential]{.mark} risk[?]{.mark}"]{.underline}, and
[many]{.underline} who ask this question [answer
**negatively**]{.underline}, [arguing]{.underline} that [as a result ﻿
climate change is not an important topic of research **within the
field**]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, whether it is [answered
affirmatively or not,]{.underline} [this question [is
**misguided**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are three reasons for thinking
this. [Firstly]{.underline}, [it makes little sense on a
**probabilistic** level]{.underline}; whether something will be [a
threat to]{.underline} our [collective existence is not]{.underline} a
[**binary** matter]{.underline}, [it is a question of
likelihood]{.underline}. However, **[many researchers]{.underline}**
[within Existential Risk Studies **mistakenly**]{.underline} [conflict ﻿
existential risk with **events**]{.underline} [that could be existential
﻿catastrophes]{.underline}. [Secondly]{.underline}, ﻿ [[climate change is
not a **single uniform process**]{.underline}]{.mark} that will affect
everyone in the same way; [[it is]{.mark} a set of **[diffuse
impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to different]{.underline} ﻿ exposed
[populations]{.underline}, [interacting with different ﻿ vulnerabilities
and ﻿ exposures]{.underline}, and [[activating different **risk ﻿
cascades**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Richards et al. show, [[it]{.mark}
will inevitably [interact with]{.mark} a **host** of [other
threats]{.mark} (not only ﻿ **[food security]{.mark}** and **[societal
collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} even [factors such
as]{.underline} the explosivity of ﻿ [[volcanic eruptions]{.mark}
or]{.underline} the [emergence of **[zoonotic
pathogens]{.mark}**),]{.underline}1 and [[these]{.mark} can
**interact**]{.underline} with one another [to [create
**reinforcing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [feedback loops or
**"[global]{.mark} systems [death spirals]{.mark}"**.]{.underline}2
Finally, "﻿ existential risk" is too vague and arbitrary a concept for
the question to ever be answered. All the definitions of ﻿ existential
risk that have received the greatest public attention thus far, such as
Toby ﻿ Ord's, focused not in terms of an impact on humanity at any point
in time but rather in terms of "the loss of long-term future value";3
either referring to the author(s) particular vision of a high-tech
intergalactic utopia, or a fuzzy undefined idea of "our potential".4

Other [[authors]{.mark} have practised]{.underline} attribution
**[substitution]{.underline}** [and sought to [answer]{.mark} an
**easier question**]{.underline} [such as ["will]{.mark} the **[direct
impacts]{.mark}** of ﻿ climate change [make]{.mark} the [**Earth
uninhabitable**?"]{.mark}]{.underline} [as a proxy for existential
risk]{.underline},5 [or suggested agricultural
**impossibility**]{.underline} [as a **proxy** for ﻿ civilisational
collapse at a given level of temperature rise]{.underline}.6 [[These
are]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly [more tractable
questions]{.underline}, but [they are also [**entirely different**
questions]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [there is a **danger**]{.underline}
[in thinking that answering them is **sufficient**]{.underline} [to
assess]{.underline} the [overall level of ﻿ **climate
risk.**]{.underline}

We are better off reverting back to the common-sense definition of ﻿
existential risk as the risk to the existence of a given object, and
specifying whether the object under threat is humanity as a whole (﻿
extinction risk), global industrial society (collapse risk), or
something else entirely. We should be thinking of an overall level of
risk emergent from a particular socio-ecological system, and how much ﻿
climate change influences this level.7 And the question we should be
asking about this risk is what contribution, under certain scenarios, ﻿
climate change will make, bearing in mind that it will almost certainly
be operating in tandem with many other drivers of risk.

Considering [this]{.underline} revised question can also [help to
**rectify**]{.underline} [a **recurring** problem in the ﻿ climate risk
literature: using mean global temperature rise as the **sole** threat
indicator]{.underline}. Authors and ﻿ activists alike have frequently
made a direct link between the level of warming and the likelihood of
global ﻿ catastrophe, with 4--6 °C being most frequently used as this
terrible threshold.8 However, [global surface
**temperature**]{.underline} [is **only one**]{.underline} [of the ﻿
climate]{.underline} change induced [factors we need to worry about. 3
°C of warming]{.underline} above pre-industrial levels [could
be]{.underline} entirely **[manageable]{.underline}** [if]{.underline}
it occurs [in a world of adaptive technologies]{.underline}, high levels
of [multilateral cooperation]{.underline}, [wealth
equality]{.underline}, [trust in institutions]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the [safe management of other ﻿ planetary
boundaries]{.underline}. [It could]{.underline} also [be
**catastrophic**]{.underline} [in a world where other ﻿ planetary
boundaries are **transgressed**]{.underline}, [the international order
is **riven with conflict**]{.underline}, lethal autonomous weapons are
in mass production, [and societies are scarred by
**inequality**]{.underline}, low trust, [and
**polarisation**]{.underline}. Understanding the contribution of ﻿
climate change to Global Catastrophic Risk requires a more sophisticated
approach which looks beyond the direct impacts of a given level of
warming to think through fully formed climate scenarios. We believe
that, when conceived of in this way, the risks associated with ﻿ climate
change are more appreciable and it is far harder to argue that
understanding them is unimportant; however, even if others disagree with
this assessment, we still maintain that this is the right way to think
about the problem.

2\. Catastrophic Neglect

Given how poorly questions about [[catastrophic]{.mark} ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} are often framed, it is hardly surprising that it
[has been a highly neglected subject of study]{.underline}, not only
among ﻿ existential risk researchers but also among ﻿ climate change
researchers. Even at the basic level of temperature rise scenarios, [we
give **far more attention**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} studying the
impacts of [lower- end [warming]{.mark} rather than high-end
warming]{.underline}. Text-mining of IPCC reports shows that mentions of
[3 °C and above [is **underrepresented**]{.mark}]{.underline} [relative
to]{.underline} its **[likelihood]{.underline}** ([and
impact]{.underline}),9 a finding that has been verified by both
literature sampling and the reports of popular authors trying to
summarise the climate risk science.10 If anything, [this trend appears
to have **worsened**]{.underline} [over time]{.underline} with
subsequent IPCC reports.111 The [use of **complex**]{.underline} [risk
assessments to study climate scenarios has]{.underline} also [been
**neglected**]{.underline}: [looking at compound hazards is]{.underline}
already **[rare]{.underline}**,12 [let alone considering risk ﻿
**cascades**]{.underline} and integrated climate ﻿ catastrophe
assessments. Yet catastrophic ﻿ climate change remains high on the public
and political agenda, creating both a perception that this is a risk
receiving far more attention than it is, and also an intellectual vacuum
that is easily filled by poor quality research, ranging from speculative
doom-mongering13 to overly simplistic neoclassical economic models.14

[There are four]{.underline} key [reasons for this
oversight]{.underline} of extreme global ﻿ climate risk. First is
international climate policy. The 2015 Paris Climate Agreement on
Climate Change has channelled scientific attention toward the
agreement's goal of limiting warming to 2 °C above pre- industrial
levels and pursuing efforts to stabilise it below 1.5 °C, as these are
now the publicly stated goals of climate ﻿ negotiations (even if they are
highly unlikely to actually be realised). Second, [[analysis]{.mark} of
high-end warming]{.underline} scenarios [and complex risk assessments
[are]{.mark} simply **[harder]{.mark} to do**]{.underline}. [The higher
the warming gets]{.underline}, [the more difficult it becomes to
study]{.underline}, as these scenarios are more displaced for the
current climatic niche. Moreover, **[complex]{.underline}** ﻿ climate
[risk assessments involving multiple factors are]{.underline} far [more
**challenging**]{.underline} than a ﻿ hazard-centric analysis focusing on
only the direct impacts of mean global temperature rise. Third,
[[climate scholarship]{.mark} has had a **strong
incentive**]{.underline} [to "[err on the side of **least
drama**]{.mark}".]{.underline}15 [Climate change has
**long**]{.underline} [been the target of [fossil-fuel]{.mark} industry
[campaigns]{.mark} to **[sow doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [not just
on]{.underline} attempts to assess ﻿ climate change's [catastrophic
potential but even the **fundamental science**]{.underline}, and [this
[create]{.mark}s [incentives for **conservative
science**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that builds
**consensus**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and does not **risk** exploring
divergent hypotheses]{.underline}.16 Finally, [many
**fear**]{.underline} that [discussing extreme risk could]{.underline}
cause people to dwell too much on worst case scenarios,
[breed]{.underline}ing [fatalism]{.underline} and paralysis. However,
[this concern is misplaced]{.underline}; meta-analyses over hopeful vs.
fearful messaging are mixed,17 and in any case this is a false
dichotomy. One of the most referenced pieces for those concerned about
the paralytic effect of fear does show that hopeful messaging is more
poignant than fear but also that "worry" is even more effective than
hope.18 The difference between worry and fear is one of degrees; the
latter could even dissipate into the former over time. Furthermore,
research should not be a PR exercise aimed to sway the public, in open
democracies we have a duty to do honest risk assessments combined with
clear recommendations for what can be done.19

**Extinction \-\-- warming overwhelms adaptation and there's multiple
positive feedbacks.**

to Global Warming?"
https://soapboxie.com/social-issues/Are-Humans-Facing-Near-Term-Human-Extinction-Due-to-Global-Warming\]

Looking back on the history of life on Earth, [the main driver of
species' extinctions have been]{.underline} **[changes in
climate]{.underline}** over time [that species could]{.underline} **[not
adapt to]{.underline}**, even when provided long spans of time to
adapt. [Given]{.underline} [the
unnaturally]{.underline} **[fast]{.underline}** **[rate]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} global [warming]{.underline} climate
change now occurring, [humans would have to adapt to
the]{.underline} **[rapid
loss]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[habitat]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[food
sources]{.underline}**, as well as all the other impacts, at an
unprecedentedly fast speed. Adding to concerns regarding our survival as
a species, pessimists point out that Homo sapiens are the last of
several humanoid species (Neanderthals, Homo erectus, etc.) that made
Earth their home for millions of years until these prior humanoid
species eventually went extinct because they could not adapt to their
environment and competition for food.

Why the Concern Now About Our Survival as a Species?

While some scientists started raising concerns about the burning of
fossil fuels eventually warming the Earth's atmosphere as far back as
the middle 20th century, a consensus among scientists that global
warming is a problem we have to address didn't form until the later part
of the 20th century.

Now that we're progressing through the 21st century, why are some in
scientific circles raising concerns about our near-term survival as a
species? In recent years, [the]{.underline} [effects
of]{.underline} [global]{.underline} [warming have
become]{.underline} **[exceedingly]{.underline}** **[extreme]{.underline}**.
In
fact, [from]{.underline} [record-breaking]{.underline} **[heatwaves]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [unprecedented]{.underline} **[forest]{.underline}** **[fires]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [melting]{.underline} **[polar]{.underline}** **[ice]{.underline}** [sheets,
the]{.underline} [effects]{.underline} [of global
warming]{.underline} [are]{.underline} [occurring]{.underline} [**fast**er
than the scientific community had projected they would just a decade or
two ago]{.underline}. The concern about our viability as a species on
Earth is due to the fast-developing effects of global warming. If we
don't address the causes of global warming or take mitigative
actions, [it
could]{.underline} **[transform]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} **[runaway]{.underline}** [global
warming]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [would]{.underline} [heat]{.underline} [up
the Earth]{.underline} **[so
rapidly]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} [humans]{.underline} [and many
other
species]{.underline} [will]{.underline} [likely]{.underline} [be]{.underline} **[imperiled]{.underline}**.

Many scientists wrongly had confidence that mankind would come to its
senses when faced with the stark reality that our survival as a species
is threatened and we'd collectively take actions to avert catastrophic
global warming by discontinuing our burning of fossil fuels and
replacing them with renewable non-carbon energy sources. However,
despite some tepid efforts to cut carbon emissions, such as the 2016
Paris Agreement, it appears that due to a combination of ignorance and a
concerted effort by the fossil fuels industry to stop any efforts to
move away from carbon-based products, we will likely not address our
continuing release of global warming gases into Earth's atmosphere until
it's too late and the global warming we've experienced in recent decades
transforms into irreversible and catastrophic runaway global warming.

This will occur because [human-caused]{.underline} global [warming
will]{.underline} [eventually]{.underline} [trigger]{.underline} [natural
climate warming]{.underline} **[feedback loops]{.underline}** [to take
over]{.underline}. At that point, global [warming will
be]{.underline} like an **[unstoppable]{.underline}** runaway train, as
the Earth's atmospheric temperatures rise to life-threatening levels.
These warming [feedback loops include]{.underline} such things
as [releases]{.underline} [of]{.underline} global
warming [gases]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [melting]{.underline} polar [ice
sheets and]{.underline} from
frozen [methane]{.underline} [deposits]{.underline} beneath the
oceans, [as well as]{.underline} the [loss of]{.underline} polar [ice
causing]{.underline} the [Earth to absorb more]{.underline} of the
sun's [heat]{.underline} energy. [All]{.underline} [of which
will]{.underline} [cause]{.underline} [additional]{.underline} [warming,
which]{.underline} [then]{.underline} [results
in]{.underline} **[additional releases]{.underline}** of global warming
gases [that will cause]{.underline} additional global temperature rises
in [an]{.underline} **[unstoppable loop]{.underline}** that will
continue until the planet is warmer than it has been in many millions of
years (long before humans existed).

Such [rapid]{.underline} and uncontrollable [warming]{.underline} of
Earth's atmosphere [could warm]{.underline} the
planet [by]{.underline} 4 to [5 degrees Celsius]{.underline} (7 to 9
degrees Fahrenheit) within the current century [and]{.underline} perhaps
eventually [lead to a planet that is]{.underline} 8 to [9 degrees
Celsius]{.underline} (14 to 16 degrees
Fahrenheit) [warmer]{.underline} than it was before humans started
burning fossil fuels in large quantities starting in the 19th century.

Some might wonder, what's the big deal if the planet is 4 to 5 degrees
Celsius or even 8 to 9 degrees Celsius warmer than it has been as humans
evolved on Earth? After all, many parts of the planet routinely
experience temperature swings of this magnitude on a daily or weekly
basis. There are several ways
that **[rapid]{.underline}** [global]{.underline} [warming]{.underline} [on
a planetary scale
could]{.underline} **[threaten]{.underline}** **[human]{.underline}** **[survival]{.underline}**.

[Warming]{.underline} is not evenly distributed. Some areas, including
currently farmable land, will warm well in excess of the global average,
which [would]{.underline} [lead
to]{.underline} **[desertification]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**crop
failures**. This would]{.underline} obviously **[imperial
humans]{.underline}** [due to]{.underline} **[massive food
shortages]{.underline}**.

[Oceans,]{.underline} **[a]{.underline}**nother [major source of food
that]{.underline} [**humans need to survive**, are
impacted]{.underline} by rising global temperatures, [as
higher]{.underline} ocean [temperatures lead
to]{.underline} **[acidification]{.underline}** of ocean
water, [which]{.underline} [will]{.underline} eventually [lead
to]{.underline} **[massive]{.underline}** **[die-offs]{.underline}** **[of
sea life]{.underline}** that provide much-needed food for humans.

[Water]{.underline} [resources]{.underline} [will]{.underline} completely [dry
up]{.underline} in many arid parts of the
world, [making]{.underline} those [areas]{.underline} **[uninhabitable]{.underline}**.

[Dwindling]{.underline} [food and
water]{.underline} [resources]{.underline} [will
inevitably]{.underline} [lead
to]{.underline} **[wars]{.underline}** [between competing nations that
could be]{.underline} **[catastrophic]{.underline}**.

[Humans can't survive at wet-bulb temperatures]{.underline} above 35
degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit), even in the shade, as the human
body loses its ability to cool itself off. [Higher global
temperatures]{.underline} and the higher humidity levels that will occur
with the higher temperatures [could make large parts of the Earth
uninhabitable]{.underline} due to wet bulb temperatures that are lethal.

Would Runaway Global Warming Actually Lead to Human Extinction?

It's a very big step go from runaway global warming to the extinction of
all human beings on Earth. Humans possess the intellectual skills
necessary to design and build technologies that can help us adapt to
climate change. We're also able to move to places with more hospitable
climates. However, some scientists are concerned that [humans
will]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [have time
to]{.underline} **[adapt]{.underline}** [to
the]{.underline} **[quick]{.underline}** **[pace]{.underline}** of
runaway global warming [and]{.underline} some
of [the]{.underline} [impacts will be]{.underline} **[too
harsh]{.underline}** [for
us]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[survive]{.underline}**.

If farmlands and oceans are no longer capable of providing food for
humans, where will we turn to obtain life-sustaining food? It is
possible that humans could migrate towards the poles and try to farm on
land in those areas that is freed up from the ice. However, it is
unclear if the currently frozen areas in and around the polar regions
will have topsoil suitable for farming. What about freshwater fish?
Unfortunately, freshwater lakes and rivers will also undergo
acidification that will likely wipe out most or all fish species that
can provide humans nourishment. Our only hope might be some sort of
synthetic food that is created in factories using basic elements (a
technology that is certainly viable).

There will be other life-threatening factors that humans will face in a
fast warming world. [Massive]{.underline} **[fire
balls]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} **[methane
releases]{.underline}** [will
create]{.underline} **[havoc]{.underline}** [for humans]{.underline}.
These fireballs will start enormous forest fires driven by the warmer
and in many places a more arid world, which will cause turmoil for
humans. [A lack of freshwater]{.underline} in areas that undergo
desertification [will make]{.underline} **[survival
impossible]{.underline}** in such
areas. **[Wars]{.underline}** [over]{.underline} **[dwindling
resources]{.underline}** [will]{.underline} [be]{.underline} **[fought]{.underline}** [out
of]{.underline} **[desperation]{.underline}** [and
could]{.underline} **[end in catastrophe]{.underline}**.

The stress of a warmer world will weaken human immune
systems. [If]{.underline} **[industrial]{.underline}** **[society
collapses]{.underline}** or is greatly reduced, [**health**care and
medicines might become]{.underline} **[very limited]{.underline}**,
lowering life expectancy dramatically. [Humans that
survive]{.underline} all the dangers associated with runaway
global [warming
might]{.underline} **[succumb]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[pandemics]{.underline}** [that
will likely]{.underline} [sweep]{.underline} [the world as opportunistic
pathogens take advantage of weakened human systems]{.underline} [and
cause]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[large]{.underline}** **[loss of
life]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[remaining]{.underline}** **[human]{.underline}** **[populations]{.underline}**.

## Disease !

### Pandemic !

**Pandemic diseases cause extinction**

Organization, PhD in International Relations and Affairs, University of

Biosecurity", Health Security, Vol 15(4),
http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1089/hs.2017.0028)

Historically, [disease events have been responsible for
the]{.underline} **[greatest death tolls]{.underline}** [on humanity.
The 1918 flu was responsible for more than 50 million
deaths]{.underline},1 while [smallpox killed perhaps 10 times that many
in the 20th century alone.]{.underline}2 [The Black Death was
responsible for killing over 25% of the European
population]{.underline},3 while [other pandemics]{.underline}, such as
the plague of Justinian, [are thought to have killed 25
million]{.underline} in the 6th century---constituting over 10% of the
world's population at the time.4 It is an open question whether [a
future]{.underline} [pandemic could result in]{.underline} [outright
human]{.underline} [extinction]{.underline} [or the irreversible
collapse of civilization]{.underline}. [A skeptic would
have]{.underline} many good [reasons to think that existential risk from
disease is unlikely. Such a disease would need to
spread]{.underline} **[worldwide]{.underline}** [to remote populations,
overcome]{.underline} rare [genetic resistances, and evade
detection]{.underline}, cures, and countermeasures. Even evolution
itself may work in humanity's favor: [Virulence and transmission is
often a trade-off]{.underline}, and so evolutionary pressures could push
against maximally lethal wild-type pathogens.5,6 While [these
arguments]{.underline} point to a very small risk of human
extinction, **[they do not rule the possibility
out]{.underline}** entirely. Although rare, [there
are]{.underline} [recorded]{.underline} [instances of species going
extinct due to disease]{.underline}---primarily in amphibians, but also
in 1 mammalian species of rat on Christmas Island.7,8
There [are]{.underline} [also]{.underline} [historical]{.underline} [examples
of]{.underline} [large]{.underline} [human populations
being]{.underline} [almost entirely]{.underline} [wiped
out]{.underline} [by disease, especially when multiple diseases were
simultaneously introduced into a population]{.underline} without
immunity. The most striking examples of total population collapse
include native American tribes exposed to European diseases, such as the
Massachusett (86% loss of population), Quiripi-Unquachog (95% loss of
population), and theWestern Abenaki (which suffered a staggering 98%
loss of population). In the modern context, no single disease currently
exists that combines the worst-case levels of transmissibility,
lethality, resistance to countermeasures, and global reach. But [many
diseases are proof of principle that each worst-case attribute can be
realized independently.]{.underline} For example, [some diseases exhibit
nearly a 100% case fatality ratio in the absence of
treatment]{.underline}, such as rabies or septicemic plague[.
Other]{.underline} [diseases]{.underline} [have a track record
of]{.underline} [spreading]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[virtually]{.underline}** **[every
human]{.underline}** **[community]{.underline}** [**worldwide**,]{.underline} such
as the 1918 flu,10 and [seroprevalence studies indicate that other
pathogens,]{.underline} such as chickenpox and HSV-1[, can successfully
reach over]{.underline} **[95% of a
population]{.underline}**.11,12 [Under optimal virulence theory, natural
evolution would be an unlikely source for pathogens with the highest
possible levels of transmissibility]{.underline}, virulence, and global
reach. [But]{.underline} [advances in biotechnology]{.underline} [might
allow the creation of diseases that
combine]{.underline} [such]{.underline} [traits.]{.underline} Recent
controversy has already emerged over a number of scientific experiments
that resulted in viruses with enhanced transmissibility, lethality,
and/or the ability to overcome therapeutics.13-17 Other experiments
demonstrated that mousepox could be modified to have a 100% case
fatality rate and render a vaccine ineffective.18 In addition to
transmissibility and lethality, [studies have shown that other disease
traits, such as incubation time, environmental survival, and available
vectors, could be modifie]{.underline}d as well.19-

[[The melting]{.mark} Arctic [permafrost could unleash ancient zombie
viruses and trigger a catastrophic global health emergency,]{.mark}
concerned scientists say. "[We now face a tangible threat and we need to
be prepared to deal with it.]{.mark} It is as simple as that,"
geneticist Jean-Michel Claverie, professor emeritus of medicine and
genomics at Aix-Marseille University, told The Guardian. Experts are
already working with the University of the Arctic, an international
educational and research cooperative, on establishing a monitoring
network to help identify cases of diseases caused by the ancient
micro-organisms early on --- before their spread can spiral out of
control. The network would also provide quarantine facilities and
medical services for those infected to help minimize a potential
outbreak, including preventing contagious patients from leaving the
region. So-called [Methuselah microbes]{.mark}, also known as zombie
viruses, [are capable of remaining viable for]{.mark} tens of [thousands
of years encased in the frozen soil, which covers nearly 20% of the
Earth's northern hemisphere]{.mark}. "The crucial part about permafrost
is that it is cold, dark and lacks oxygen, which is perfect for
preserving biological material," Claverie said. Villagers harvesting ice
from a lake in Siberian permafrost. According to scientists, the melting
arctic permafrost could release "zombie" viruses that could cause a
pandemic. A geneticist named Jean-Michel Claverie standing on a stage
with a projector screen in the background Geneticist Jean-Michel
Claverie said zombie viruses are a "tangible threat" that humanity must
be prepared for. SVFU "You could put a yogurt in permafrost and it might
still be edible 50,000 years later." Scientists believe [the deepest
layers of permafrost could be preserving viruses that inhabited the
Earth up to a million years ago]{.mark} --- long before humans' most
ancient ancestors, who it's believed made their first appearance on the
planet some 300,000 years ago. Modern humans would therefore have no
natural immunity against the prehistoric viral invaders. "Our immune
systems may have never been in contact with some of those microbes, and
that is another worry," Claverie told the outlet. "The scenario of an
unknown virus once infecting a Neanderthal coming back at us, although
unlikely, has become a real possibility." A large, dark organism,
resembling a small bacterial cell, discovered in melted permafrost off
the coast of Chile. A micro-organism discovered in thawing permafrost.
Zombies behind a fence Like the zombies of monster movies, researches
are increasingly concerned that viruses that have lain dormant for tens
of thousands of years could pose a threat. The prospect of ancient
viruses escaping their icy prisons in the most remote regions of Earth
and kicking off a new global pandemic sounds unlikely, but virologists
believe there's at least some room for concern. What do you think? Post
a comment. "We don't know what viruses are lying out there in the
permafrost but I think there is a real risk that there might be one
capable of triggering a disease outbreak -- say of an ancient form of
polio," virologist Marion Koopmans of the Erasmus Medical Center in
Rotterdam told the outlet. "We have to assume that something like this
could happen."]{.underline}

[[Melting permafrost could soon present humanity with a new deadly
disease,]{.underline}]{.mark} researchers told The Guardian. [[Global
warming is beginning to release the Methuselah microbe, also known as
the "zombie virus,"]{.underline}]{.mark} from melting Arctic ice. Its
emergence is currently being overlooked by modern scientists, geneticist
Jean-Michel Claverie of Aix-Marseille University in France told the
publication. [At the moment, analyses of [pandemic threats focus on
diseases that might emerge in southern regions and then spread
north]{.mark}]{.underline}," Claverie said. "[By contrast, little
attention has been given to an outbreak that might emerge in the far
north and then travel south -- and that is an oversight]{.underline}, I
believe. [There are viruses up there that have the potential to infect
humans and start a new disease outbreak]{.underline}." Climate scientist
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Kimberley Miner told CNN [[the virus
has a genetic makeup that is unique from modern diseases. This could
allow the virus to exploit weaknesses in the modern immune system that
have not been tested by other illnesses]{.mark}.]{.underline} "We're
really unclear as to how these microbes are going to interact with the
modern environment," Miner said. "It's not really an experiment that I
think any of us want to run." Claverie says he has been following the
virus closely. In 2014, the researcher led a team of scientists in
isolating live samples of the virus as old as 48,500 years old to
observe their ability to infect single-cell organisms. While this
version posed no threat to humans, the scientist warned it pointed
toward the existence of other more damaging strains. The viruses we
isolated were only able to infect amoebae and posed no risk to humans,"
Claverie said. "[However, that does not mean that other viruses --
currently frozen in the permafrost -- might not be able to trigger
illnesses in humans.]{.underline} We have identified genomic traces of
poxviruses and herpesviruses, which are well known human pathogens, for
example." [The virus is just one of several diseases making
headlines.]{.underline} Chinese researchers this month claimed to have
"cloned" a COVID-like virus mutation that showed a 100% mortality rate
in mice. Each mouse displayed symptoms of "piloerection, hunched
posture, and sluggish movements" along with their eyes turning white and
weight loss. They each died within eight days with "late brain
infection" being the supposed cause**.**

still limited" in the Arctic, driven primarily by opportunism and
economic interests. However, these [Arctic exceptionalism views miss the
growing geopolitical competition, driven largely by Russia's dominance
over the Arctic relative to NATO.The Arctic becoming a strategic
battleground]{.underline} was explicitly acknowledged in June 2024
through the U.S. Department of Defense's Arctic Strategy, noting growing
[Russian-Chinese collaboration]{.underline}. [Despite major combat
losses in Ukraine, Russia continues to expand its Arctic military
presence and activities]{.underline}. [The Arctic's unique environment
requires specialized training and equipment, posing challenges for the
United States in projecting and sustaining military forces in the
region. This task is further complicated by the American strategic focus
on countering China in the Indo-Pacific. NATO represents an ideal form
of Arctic burden-sharing, allowing the United States to concentrate
elsewhere]{.underline}.As the Trump administration pivots back to Asia,
[maintaining strong NATO ties is crucial]{.underline}, despite rhetoric
to the contrary. NATO has been tying its strategic survival to an
Indo-Pacific pivot since 2019, and the [Trump administration will need
to rely more on Arctic-minded NATO allies to deter Russian and Chinese
ambitions]{.underline}. The U.S. military has minimal forces capable of
operating in the Arctic but also needs to defend its space-based
infrastructure around the region. [By leveraging NATO, particularly the
Arctic expertise of British, Canadian, and Nordic allies, the United
States can ensure a stable Arctic presence, enabling a robust military
posture in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} Become a Member The Strategic
Importance of the Arctic The [Arctic has become a unique arena of global
competition]{.underline}. It is the sole area of the world where both
Russia and China operate in close proximity to North America across
various domains. Melting sea ice and technological advances have
[increased accessibility]{.underline}, transforming the Arctic from a
"strategic buffer" to a hotspot for [valuable resources like oil, gas,
rare earth minerals, and new fisheries, as well as opening shorter sea
routes between Europe and Asia]{.underline}. This increased
accessibility unlocks immense [economic potential,
including]{.underline} an estimated 90 billion barrels of undiscovered
oil, 30 percent of the world's undiscovered natural gas, and \$1
trillion in rare earth minerals. However, these opportunities bring
[heightened competition, where the growing Chinese and Russian presence
directly challenges U.S. and NATO interests.]{.underline} The [Arctic
has long been central to Russia's identity and security]{.underline},
controlling 53 percent of Arctic coastline, and its [Arctic policy
identifies its economic and security needs]{.underline}. As the ice
melts, the region becomes a [real security concern for both Russia and
the United States]{.underline}. The [Arctic is crucial to Russia's
economy]{.underline}, accounting for 10 percent of Russian GDP and 20
percent of exports. Russia has expanded its [military
footprint]{.underline}, reopening Soviet-era bases, deploying advanced
missile systems, and investing in nuclear-powered icebreakers. The Kola
Peninsula, home to most of Russia's ballistic missile submarines,
underscores the Arctic's role in Russia's nuclear deterrence strategy.
Moreover, Russia attempts to control the Northern Sea Route, challenging
international norms of freedom of navigation, posing a direct threat to
NATO's Northern Flank and member states' economic interests. China's
Arctic activities further complicate the security landscape. Despite not
being an Arctic nation, [China has declared itself a "near-Arctic
state]{.underline}" and seeks influence through its Polar Silk Road
initiative. These efforts, often dual-use, support military objectives.
Sino-Russian joint Arctic exercises, including coast guard and naval
patrols as well as joint bomber patrols, demonstrate increased [military
alignment against the United States. They pose a strategic challenge to
NATO and the defense of the American homeland, by combining Russia's
military presence with China's economic and technological
capabilities.]{.underline} NATO's Valuable Arctic Expertise [Converging
Russian and Chinese interests both in and beyond the Arctic requires the
United States to work by, with, and through allies to counter threats in
the region]{.underline}. Traditionally, the United States has enjoyed
unrivaled military dominance, but in the Arctic, it now faces an
emerging alliance between two formidable competitors. This situation
underscores the need for a collaborative approach with NATO allies to
ensure preparedness for a crisis in the Arctic. American dominance
cannot be taken for granted. In the Arctic, [U.S. capabilities are not
enough to counter Russia, let alone a Sino-Russian
alliance.]{.underline} Per our recently published research, successful
military operations in the Arctic require not only specialized equipment
but also dedicated training and doctrine for polar warfare. Arctic
operations are uniquely challenging, with complex logistics, extreme
weather, and seasonal shifts like polar days and nights. Accordingly,
building [Arctic-ready forces requires]{.underline} "the deliberate
education and development of Arctic-minded leaders alongside
[collaboration with allies and partners]{.underline} to foster enhanced
cold weather war-fighting capabilities across the spectrum." Arctic
warfighting requires more than just specialized equipment --- rather, it
demands the dedicated attention of those troops who will be assigned to
conduct it. Lessons learned from previous Arctic conflicts include the
need for cold weather warfare training and equipment, dedicated polar
war-fighting doctrine, joint operations, interoperability, mobility in
Arctic conditions, planning for increased supplies and unique logistics,
Arctic domain awareness and intelligence, space weather disrupting
command and control, inimitable polar weather issues associated with
polar days and nights, controlling Arctic sea lines of communication,
and ensuring unity of command. Fortunately, NATO already has much of the
necessary infrastructure in place with the Nordics. For instance, the
British-led Joint Expeditionary Force was established in 2014 and
emphasized Arctic warfare capabilities with Nordic military forces in
the High North. More recent developments include the establishment of a
NATO Multi-Corps Land Component Command in Finland, the formation of a
Nordic Air Force, and the creation of a NATO Commander Task Force Baltic
in the German port city of Rostock. All reflect a boost in NATO's
cohesion, capability, and communication, helping establish the "3 Cs of
Deterrence" around the Arctic Circle NATO's role in defending the Arctic
has grown increasingly vital, and the alliance can capitalize on the
polar expertise of its Arctic countries. Canada, Denmark (Greenland),
Norway, Sweden, and Finland are highly trained in cold-weather warfare,
have a deep understanding of Arctic operations, and are geographically
positioned to respond quickly to threats in the region. Moreover, the
Nordic countries are jointly negotiating the procurement of an infantry
fighting vehicle specifically for the subarctic climate. Finland's
expertise in Arctic warfare can be traced to the Winter War
(1939--1940), when it held off a numerically superior Soviet invasion
force longer and better than expected due to superior tactics adapted to
its unique Arctic environment, before ultimately losing. Finland's
contributions to NATO include substantial ground forces and long-range
fires. Likewise, Norway hosts the NATO Centre of Excellence for Cold
Weather Operations. Sweden's recent ascension to NATO bolsters the air
capabilities and industrial base of the alliance while Denmark's Joint
Arctic Command provides critical presence, experience, and capability.
Canada has long been a key U.S. partner in the Arctic as a part of the
bi-national North American Air Defense Command. Filling Gaps in the Ice
While Canada and the Nordics specialize more in Arctic warfighting, NATO
still faces significant military capability gaps in the Arctic. To
effectively counter potential aggression from Russia and China in the
Arctic, [NATO needs to strengthen its ability]{.underline} to conduct a
range of specialized military operations in the Arctic including
long-range fires, multi-domain awareness, air and missile defense,
attack aviation, amphibious operations, and the logistical sustainment
of resilient forces capable of enduring prolonged engagements in harsh
polar conditions. NATO faces specific challenges in Arctic naval
readiness, particularly in ice-capable vessels and icebreakers, which
are an "important element of Arctic sovereignty." Russia holds a clear
advantage with 46 icebreakers, Project 22100 Ocean Patrol Vessels, and
its new ice-capable Project 23550 ships. These vessels offer Russia a
massive Arctic advantage enabling superior presence and mobility. NATO
should focus on building additional vessels like Canada's Harry DeWolf
Arctic Offshore Patrol Ships and an updated version of Denmark's
Thetis-class frigates. The recently penned collaborative ICE Pact
between the United States, Canada, and Finland is a step in the right
direction for bolstering their respective industrial bases to build more
icebreakers. Additionally, [partnerships with non-NATO]{.underline}
allies that have icebreakers, such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia,
could support NATO operations in the Arctic if needed in a crisis. For
current gaps in Arctic coverage, NATO needs more anti-access and area
denial capabilities to pose a credible threat to Russian operations.
NATO needs to embark on a sustained investment campaign to bolster its
Arctic deterrence capabilities both on land and at sea in the Arctic.
Minimal Arctic Capabilities [The United States needs NATO for Arctic
stability]{.underline}, due to struggles in committing tangible
resources to the Arctic besides more hollow strategies. Increasing
Arctic-specific training, expanding icebreaking capabilities, and
enhancing interoperability with Canada, the Nordics, and Arctic-minded
countries (such as the United Kingdom) are essential steps for
projecting force in the Arctic. Training exercises like Arctic Edge and
the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center Rotation 24-02
demonstrate progress but should be scaled up to counter the threat posed
by the growing Sino-Russian alliance. The United States also maintains
critical Arctic installations --- including Pituffik Space Base in
Greenland, which serves as a critical hub for missile defense and
satellite communications --- but more Arctic bases are needed to
effectively compete in the region. Similarly, the U.S. Army established
the 11th Airborne Division "Arctic Angels" in 2022 at Anchorage, Alaska,
with 11,000 soldiers focused on extreme cold weather operations.
However, it is problematic that this unit maintains "readiness for
global deployments ... \[and\] for large-scale combat operations" when
it should be wholly focused on polar warfare. Worse, the unit struggles
with numerous internal morale issues. [The United States ought to go
further in building its Arctic capabilities]{.underline}, by ramping up
its Arctic-specific training programs and investing in research and
development aimed at enhancing cold-weather operational capabilities.
This includes expanding its fleet of icebreakers, which is currently
insufficient to conduct the necessary peacetime missions, let alone
support a potential conflict in the region. However, these initiatives
are unlikely due to the Arctic being a low priority under current global
force management postures. Ruthless defense prioritization means the
Arctic will likely continue to be neglected, despite growing risks.
Thus, the United States should foster greater cooperation with its NATO
Arctic allies, particularly Canada and the Nordics, to ensure a
coordinated and effective response to any potential crisis in the
region. Undergirding that should be civil society engagement with
indigenous populations around the Arctic Circle in a mutually beneficial
way to ensure their security and to partner with them to increase Arctic
domain awareness. A Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for the Arctic
[Canada, the Nordics, and other Arctic-minded allies should lead
NATO]{.underline} in Arctic defense as the United States pivots to
counter China in the Indo-Pacific. The combined [Sino-Russian threat is
global, and the United States needs allies to share the burden of
defense. The United States and NATO should leverage the expertise of
Arctic allies]{.underline} to establish a Nordic-led Arctic-focused
Combined Joint Expeditionary Force within NATO, allowing the alliance to
establish a dedicated force as a credible deterrent in the Arctic.
Forming a Nordic-led Combined Joint Expeditionary Force for the Arctic
would reduce the strain on U.S. forces. NATO lacks an Arctic strategy
other than an October 2024 statement about defending "Allied interests
in the Arctic." [NATO needs a comprehensive Arctic strategy]{.underline}
that leads to investments in infrastructure, training, and equipment [to
match Russian]{.underline} power in the Arctic. [Without proper
resourcing, Russia will keep dominating the Arctic, making it less safe
for international trade, freedom of navigation, and rule of
law]{.underline}. Sino-Russian dominance of the Arctic has severe
implications for global security and economic stability. Through
collective action and improved Arctic-specific readiness, NATO can deter
Sino-Russian aggression in the Arctic while supporting a U.S. shift to
the Indo-Pacific.

#### Trump won't cooperate on Arctic issues -- his threats to take over Canada and Greenland weaken Arctic Counsel

**Huebert 25 (**Rob Huebert; a professor in the Department of Political
Science at the University of Calgary, interim director of the Centre for
Military, Security and Strategic Studies. Can the Arctic Council survive
the Trump administration? Probably not. Here's why. Arctic Today.

In addition, he has openly criticized NATO and the ICC, along with many
of the U.S. economic agreements with other nations. In both his first
term and now his second, [Trump has shown a clear lack of support for
international organizations and multilateral agreements]{.underline}.
Specifically, [he seems intent on either ending American participation
or upending the agreements]{.underline} solely [for American
benefit.]{.underline}

[Trump has]{.underline} already [demonstrated that even if he doesn't
withdraw from the Arctic Council, he would actively gut some of the most
important achievements in line with his own goals]{.underline}. First,
[he doesn't "believe" in climate change]{.underline}. During Trump's
first term, the Arctic Council ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi in 2019
failed to produce a final declaration for the first time since the
organization was created. This was because the U.S. delegation -- under
the leadership of Secretary of States Mike Pompeo -- objected to the
term "climate change" or any reference to the Paris Accord. [There is
nothing to suggest that the American position on climate change will be
altered. If anything, it will probably get more strident.]{.underline}

Reshaping Society

Trump has also moved quickly to end American programs that are in any
way associated with the issues surrounding Diversity, Equity and
Inclusion (DEI). [It is highly unlikely that]{.underline} as part of
this process to reshape American society, [his administration would
support any of the]{.underline} important [initiatives
supporting]{.underline} the [northern Indigenous Peoples under the
Arctic Council]{.underline}. His administration has had no qualms about
ending the support that the U.S. had provided to the developing world,
so [he will]{.underline} almost certainly [be unwilling to continue to
provide any support]{.underline} of the Permanent Participants or any
[of the Arctic Council programs]{.underline} that support them.

Third, [Trump has directly attacked two of the core state members of the
Arctic Council]{.underline}. Since his second term began[, he has
repeatedly threatened to "take over" both Greenland and
Canada]{.underline}. While some at first thought he was just joking,
Trump has continued to say that these are his intentions. He has begun
to take active steps, through the threats of a trade war to critically
weaken Canada in order to make it more amendable to "joining" the U.S.
Again, [even if he doesn't move to directly destroy the Arctic Council,
how could Canada and Denmark work with the U.S., knowing
that]{.underline} the [Americans are actively moving to
weaken]{.underline} or even cripple [them as a state?]{.underline}

Fourth, [the one Arctic state that Trump has attempted to improve
relations with -- Russia -- remains]{.underline} also [problematic for
the Arctic Council]{.underline}. [Trump's effort to work with Russia
will make the existing issues]{.underline} that the Arctic Council had
with Russia even [more difficult]{.underline}. [Trump]{.underline} has
already called for the Russians to be readmitted to the G-7. If he
doesn't move to end the Arctic Council, he [will undoubtedly call
for]{.underline} any [sanctions against Russia to be eliminated and for
the country to be fully integrated.]{.underline}

Escalation is defined as an increase in the nature or intensity of
conflict. [Extending escalation theory to]{.underline} **[cyber
space]{.underline}** would [include situations in which "the target
responds with]{.underline} **[more intense]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[costly]{.underline}** [cyber means]{.underline}
(cyber escalation within the domain) [or]{.underline} through
**[breaching]{.underline}** [the cyber-kinetic threshold]{.underline}
(crossdomain escalation)" (Borghard and Lonergan 2019: 123). Libicki
(2016) simplifies cyber escalation into two factors: intensity (striking
deeper, lasting longer) or more extensive (striking new targets), plus
adds the consideration that an attack in cyber space can escalate to an
attack on physical space.

Cyber escalation is then defined as a reaction with digital tools that
increases intensity or aggression or that spreads the scope of conflict
after an initial move in the digital domain. Theoretically the cyber
domain can contain escalation because of the uncertainty introduced by
cyber weapons (Buchanan 2016). There is also the aspect of civilian
punishment, attacks that hit what might be deemed off-limits civilian
systems, provoking escalation due to the violation in norms between two
actors.

[[In]{.underline} **[practice]{.underline}**]{.mark}, however, [[cyber
escalation is]{.underline} **[rare]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[Stuxnet]{.underline} (2007--2010) [is]{.underline} **[often
cited]{.underline}** [as the prime example]{.underline} of cyber
escalation [yet]{.underline}, put in the context of the wider dispute
between the West and Iran over the development of nuclear weapons, [the
[Stuxnet]{.mark} attack [is]{.mark} actually a]{.underline}
**[[de-escalatory]{.mark} move]{.underline}** [[because]{.mark} the
[other options]{.mark} on the table at the time
[were]{.mark}]{.underline} **[conventional]{.underline}**
[[strikes]{.mark} that [would have caused]{.mark}]{.underline} death and
[[destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Talmadge (2019a: 864) makes the point that [technology itself
is]{.underline} **[rarely a sufficient condition]{.underline}** [for
escalation, "cast\[ing\] doubt on the idea of]{.underline} **[emerging
technologies]{.underline}** [as an]{.underline}
**[independent]{.underline}**, primary **[driver]{.underline}** [of
otherwise avoidable escalation]{.underline}." [Technology became
the]{.underline} **[mask]{.underline}** for the processes that enable
escalation, [rather than the]{.underline} **[cause]{.underline}** [of
escalation itself]{.underline}. It is not the domain that produces
escalation, but the action in the domain that produces outcomes.

We [[have]{.underline} **[ample empirical
ev]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[idence]{.underline}** that **[[escalation is
limited in]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain]{.underline}**. Even in its
simpler form, [there is]{.underline} **[little
retaliation]{.underline}**, [let alone escalation, in the domain or even
out of the domain when cyber actions are]{.underline} the
**[triggering]{.underline}** [events]{.underline}. When conflicts do
escalate in cyber space, we [observe]{.underline} **[limited
engagement]{.underline}** [between the parties unless there
is]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}** [an outright war]{.underline}.
As Valeriano, Jensen, and Maness (2018: 18) note, "[even when cyber
[exchanges]{.mark}]{.underline} **[between rivals]{.underline}**
[escalate, they [remain]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[limited in
scope]{.underline}**]{.mark} [outside of ongoing military
conflict]{.underline}. That is, rivals may use cyber operations to probe
the enemy, test their resolve, and signal the risks of significant
escalation.

**[[Data analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}** [supports these positions and
is developed]{.underline} here [from established data and taken from
ongoing projects]{.underline} to support our background investigation
into cyber escalation processes (Maness, Valeriano, and Jensen 2019).
Table 12.4 [[shows]{.mark} the]{.underline} [**[response
patterns]{.underline}** [between]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates and
its four major adversaries ([**[Russia]{.underline}**,
**[Iran]{.underline}**, **[China]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea) [in
the cyber domain, as well as how each country responds to a cyber
operation with a]{.underline} **[retaliatory]{.underline}** [cyber
operation]{.underline}. Table 12.4 utilizes the cyber operation severity
score from the DCID version 1.5 that measures the impact and national
security importance of each state-initiated cyber operation between the
years 2000--2016 between rival states (Maness, Valeriano, and Jensen
2019). The scale is interval and ranges from 1 to 10.

Table 12.4 shows that the United States is often on the receiving end of
retaliation at a higher rate than expected. However, these responses to
US cyber actions do not indicate within-domain escalation. The severity
levels with a response score of 2 were retaliatory to US actions that
were of a higher severity level. Of the seven actions at the severity
level of 4, three represent a decrease in the initial attack severity
and four represent an increase by one tick in severity. The only other
country that witnesses a statistically significant level of retaliation
at a greater rate than expected is Iran, which is wholly due to US or
Israeli operations. China's significant negative relationship with its
severity score of 2 shows that it prefers higher levels of severity when
it retaliates in the cyber domain. Many of the Chinese incidents involve
entanglements with the United States, which is another great power with
vast cyber capabilities. This [propensity to use]{.underline} **[more
severe]{.underline}** [attacks [does]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[not]{.underline}** [denote escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}, however.
[Escalation is]{.underline} **[rare in digital
interactions]{.underline}** [as measured by]{.underline}
**[rival]{.underline}** [states]{.underline} from 2000 to 2016.

\[Figure omitted\]

Table 12.5 shows how responses are related to the overall cyber strategy
of the initiating states. In terms of response severity by strategic
objective, [disruptive [efforts]{.mark} by initiating states are
[usually met with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[retal]{.mark}iatory
[disruptions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [further indicating]{.underline}
that [the cyber domain is]{.underline}, for the most part,
**[non-escalatory]{.underline}**. Espionage campaigns are also commonly
met with cyber operations that either steal or signal capabilities or
displeasure for the originating action, but [do [not]{.mark} lead to
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[tit-for-tat]{.underline}** [escalatory
ladder]{.underline}]{.mark}, as indicated in Table 12.2. Only
occasionally do we see disruptions or espionage operations escalate to
the severity level of 5, with this happening only five times over the
2000--2016 period.

[Results from]{.underline} **[[war ga]{.mark}mes]{.underline}** have
[[demonstrated]{.mark} the]{.underline} **[complicated]{.underline}**
empirical [picture of the escalation landscape in cyber
space]{.underline} (Schneider 2017). After examining war games from 2011
to 2016, Schneider [finds that government officials were]{.underline}
**[hesitant]{.underline}** [to use damaging cyber weapons]{.underline}.
Most games only witness the use of cyber capabilities after the onset of
conventional warfare, not before. For Jensen and Banks (2018), in the
context of cyber options, [[escalation]{.mark} was
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[exception]{.mark}, not the
norm]{.underline}**.

To explore escalation when cyber options are present within the context
of integrated options of national power, Jensen and Valeriano (2019) ran
a series of war games on 259 participants, including members of the
military, students, and policymakers. The [simulation situated
participants in a]{.underline} typical [crisis that was]{.underline}
**[highly likely]{.underline}** [to escalate given a]{.underline}
**[rivalry]{.underline}** [situation over an]{.underline} **[ongoing
territorial dispute]{.underline}** [when the crisis under
examination]{.underline} was the third in a series over a five-year
period.

The [results]{.underline} **[demonstrated]{.underline}** that
[escalation is not the norm]{.underline}. Based on a general baseline
for all international conflict situations, most options fell below the
48 percent threshold. In fact, the only instance where escalation was
the dominant option was when a cyber action started the crisis and the
target had no cyber response options. This suggests there are
implications of attacking a state with cyber options when they do not
have the ability to respond within the domain. [In]{.underline}
**[most]{.underline}** other [situations]{.underline}, we
[witness]{.underline} **[few demands for escalation]{.underline}** [when
cyber response options are on the table]{.underline}.

[Overall]{.underline}, **[[regardless]{.mark} of [the
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [cyber [escalation
is]{.mark}]{.underline} usually [**[not]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [dominant [response]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
[reality is that even under dangerous conditions cyber response
options]{.underline} can **[actually moderate]{.underline}** [crisis
response patterns]{.underline}. [Surveys demonstrate]{.underline} a
great amount of **[[fear]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the cyber domain,
but this]{.underline} **[[does not motivate
overreaction]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Gross, Canetti, and Vashdi 2017).
Figure 12.2 shows the results from a cyber campaign--directed dyads data
set. What is measured in what follows is whether the combined cyber
operation, which includes diplomatic, economic, and military variables
extracted from ICEWS (Boschee et al. 2018), has escalatory responses
from the target from all four domains recorded in the campaigns. For a
cyber response to be recorded, the target responds within one year from
the start date of the original cyber operation from the initiator for
disruptions and degradations, and from the date the operation becomes
public for espionage operations. For a diplomatic response, the time
frame is one month (thirty days) after the cyber operation's initiation
or public reporting, and for economic and military responses, the time
frame is three months (ninety days) after the same criteria regarding
the cyber operation. For cyber escalation, the severity score must go up
at least one point regarding the cyber response. No cyber responses at
the same severity score are included. For conventional responses, we use
the Conflict and Mediation Event Observation (CAMEO)
conflict-cooperation scores to measure escalation (Schrodt 2012). The
CAMEO scale ranges from −10 to 10 where the more negative score, the
more conflictual and the more positive score, the more cooperative the
foreign policy action. If the conflict scores from each domain are lower
(more negative) from the target state in retaliation for the cyber
incident, escalation in each domain is recorded.

### 1AR \-\-- Trump Killed Cooperation

#### Trump won't continue cooperation in the Arctic -- he's already damaging the Arctic counsel

Science at the University of Calgary, interim director of the Centre for
Military, Security and Strategic Studies. Can the Arctic Council survive

Ultimately, this means that the [Arctic Council now faces two terrible
scenarios]{.underline}. The first is that in his scorched earth policy
toward multilateralism, [Trump will either move to end the Arctic
Council or at least remove the U.S. as a member]{.underline}. [He may
also carry out his threat to ensure that both Canada and Denmark also
cease to be meaningful members of the Arctic Council]{.underline}. If he
truly does intend to take over Canada, it won't even be a state. [Even
if he only means to weaken and reduce Canada to a vassal state, its
ability to participate will be damaged -- if not
eliminated]{.underline}.

Likewise, [if the U.S. takes over Greenland, Denmark's main rational for
being a member of the Arctic Council will be eliminated]{.underline}.
Assuming that somehow the Arctic Council survives an American
withdrawal, and the U.S. follows up its threats to control Greenland and
Canada, [the Council would have only the active membership of Finland,
Sweden, Norway and Iceland]{.underline}.

Even if the U.S. remains in the Arctic Council, its current actions
means the gutting of some of its most important missions, [The U.S.
won't support actions to eliminate the causes of climate
change,]{.underline} and it is very unlikely to support the Permanent
Participants. Outside of the Council, perhaps the Coast Guard forum will
continue. But even here Trump is having an impact. He has already fired
Admiral Linda Pagan, the Commandant of the USCG. American officials have
suggested it was because of her commitment to DEI policies.

Even more dangerously[, this variant of the Arctic Council would include
a U.S. whose policies are now at complete odds with the previous actions
of the Arctic Council]{.underline}. It would also include a Denmark that
has either lost Greenland to the U.S. or will need to take action to
prevent this. It will include a Canada that is being continually
weakened by American action, and is either actively trying to stop an
American takeover or has become a vassal state to the U.S. [It
will]{.underline} also [include a Russia that is being increasingly
supported by the U.S. and has been given the right of conquest over
Ukraine.]{.underline} Furthermore, if Ukraine was conquered for
considering joining NATO, the future of both Finland and Sweden (which
did actually join NATO) will undoubtedly be even more problematic for
Russia.

[These are dire times for the Arctic Council]{.underline}. It is hard to
think of a way to maintain its many successes in supporting an
understanding of the impact of climate change on the Arctic. [It has
also played an important role in supporting a greater awareness of the
northern Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} in the region.
[And]{.underline} perhaps most importantly, it [has served as the
principal means of promoting a peaceful and harmonious international
regime of cooperation]{.underline}.

[All of this is now at risk]{.underline}. Perhaps [Trump won't think
that the Arctic Council is worth]{.underline} his
[attention]{.underline}, and it can somehow remain under the American
radar until the next presidential election. But as many have said in the
past, hope is not a strategy.

During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing in March, Senator Angus
King, an independent from Maine, pressed General Paul Nakasone, the head
of U.S. Cyber Command and director of the National Security Agency,
about the [**lack** of]{.underline} **[significant]{.underline}**
[cyber-operations]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [Russia's
war]{.underline} in Ukraine. After all, Russia has long been known for
targeting Western countries, as well as Ukraine itself, with
cyberattacks. Echoing the surprise of many Western observers, King said,
"[I expected]{.underline} [to see]{.underline} [the grid]{.underline}
[go down]{.underline}, [communications]{.underline} [too]{.underline},
and [that]{.underline} **[hasn't]{.underline}** [happened]{.underline}."
Indeed, although President Joe Biden and members of his administration
have also warned of potential Russian cyberattacks against the United
States, there were remarkably few signs of such activity during the
first six weeks of the war.

That is not to say that cyber-activity has been entirely absent. Proxy
cyber-groups and hackers have mobilized on both sides, ranging from
Ukraine's 400,000-strong "IT Army" to Russia's Conti ransomware group.
Sandworm, an outfit linked to Russian military intelligence, also has a
long record of cyberattacks against Ukraine.

Yet since the war began, such [[operations]{.underline}
[have]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly [[been]{.mark}
**limited**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[[low-cost]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [disruptive]{.underline}
[**[incidents]{.underline}**]{.mark} [rather than]{.underline}
**[large-scale]{.underline}** [attacks]{.underline}
[against]{.underline} [critical]{.underline} civilian and military
[infrastructure]{.underline}. Two [potential]{.underline}
[exceptions]{.underline} only underscore the relatively limited role of
cyber-operations. There is some evidence that at the start of the war
Russian-linked actors conducted a cyberattack against Viasat, a
U.S.-based Internet company that provides satellite Internet to the
Ukrainian military and to customers in Europe. But the
[impact]{.underline} [was]{.underline} **[temporary]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}, more important, [did **not**]{.underline}
**[meaningfully]{.underline}** [affect]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
Ukrainian [military's]{.underline} [ability to]{.underline}
[communicate]{.underline}. Additionally, Ukrainian officials recently
announced that, in early April, [the Sandworm]{.underline}
[group]{.underline} attempted, but **[failed]{.underline}**, to carry
out a cyberattack against Ukraine's power grid. While the hackers
appeared to have gained access to a company that delivers power to two
million Ukrainians, they were **[thwarted]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} **[effective]{.underline}** [defenses]{.underline}
[before]{.underline} [being able]{.underline} [to cause]{.underline} any
[damage]{.underline} or disruption.

In fact, [the **negligible**]{.underline} [role]{.underline} [of
cyberattacks]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the [Ukraine]{.underline}
conflict [should come]{.underline} [as]{.underline} **[no
surprise]{.underline}**. [Through]{.underline} [[war
**sim**]{.mark}ulation**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**stat**i**s**tical]{.underline} [analyses]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [other]{.underline} [kinds of]{.underline}
[[studies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [scholars]{.underline} have
[[found]{.underline} **[little ev]{.underline}**]{.mark}[idence
that]{.underline} [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}-operations
[provide]{.underline} **[effective]{.underline}** forms of
[coercion]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [that they]{.underline} [[cause
**escalation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to **actual**]{.underline}
[military conflict]{.underline}. That is because [for all]{.underline}
[its potential]{.underline} [to disrupt]{.underline} companies,
hospitals, and utility grids during peacetime, [cyberpower]{.underline}
[is **much harder**]{.underline} [to use]{.underline} [against
targets]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[strategic
significance]{.underline}** [or to]{.underline} [achieve
outcomes]{.underline} [with]{.underline} **[decisive
impacts]{.underline}**, either on the battlefield or
[during]{.underline} crises short of [war]{.underline}. In failing to
recognize this, U.S. officials and policymakers are approaching the use
of cyberpower in a way that may be doing more harm than good---treating
cyber-operations like any other weapon of war rather than as a nonlethal
instrument of statecraft and, in the process, overlooking the
considerable opportunities as well as risks they present.

THE MYTH OF CYBER-ESCALATION

Much of [the **current**]{.underline} [understanding]{.underline} in
Washington [about the]{.underline} [role of]{.underline}
[cyber]{.underline}-operations [in conflict]{.underline} [is
built]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [long-standing]{.underline}
[but]{.underline} **[false assumptions]{.underline}** about cyberspace.
Many [scholars]{.underline} [have asserted]{.underline} [that
cyber]{.underline}-operations [could easily]{.underline} [lead
to]{.underline} [military escalation]{.underline}, [up to]{.underline}
and including [the use of]{.underline} [nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
Jason Healey and Robert Jervis, for example, expressing a widely held
view, have argued that an incident that takes place in cyberspace,
"might cross the threshold into armed conflict either through a sense of
impunity or through miscalculation or mistake."
[Policymakers]{.underline} [have]{.underline} also [long
believed]{.underline} [that cyberspace]{.underline} [poses grave
perils]{.underline}. In 2012, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned
of an impending "cyber-Pearl Harbor," in which adversaries could take
down critical U.S. infrastructure through cyberattacks. Nearly a decade
later, FBI Director Christopher Wray compared the threat from
ransomware---when actors hold a target hostage by encrypting data and
demanding a ransom payment in return for decrypting it---to the 9/11
attacks. And as recently as December 2021, Secretary of Defense Lloyd
Austin noted that in cyberspace, "norms of behavior aren't
well-established and the risks of escalation and miscalculation are
high."

[Seemingly]{.underline} [buttressing]{.underline} [these
claims]{.underline} [has been]{.underline} [a long record]{.underline}
[of cyber]{.underline}-operations [by hostile governments]{.underline}.
In recent years, states ranging from Russia and China to Iran and North
Korea have used cyberspace to conduct large-scale espionage, inflict
significant economic damage, and undermine democratic institutions. In
January 2021, for example, attackers linked to the Chinese government
were able to breach Microsoft's Exchange email servers, giving them
access to communications and other private information from companies
and governments, and may have allowed other malicious actors to conduct
ransomware attacks. That breach followed on the heels of a Russian
intrusion against the software vendor SolarWinds, in which hackers were
able to access a huge quantity of sensitive government and corporate
data---an espionage treasure trove. Cyberattacks have also inflicted
significant economic costs. The NotPetya attack affected critical
infrastructure around the world---ranging from logistics and energy to
finance and government---causing upward of \$10 billion in damage.

**[But]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} [assumption]{.underline} [that
cyber]{.underline}-operations play a central role in either
**[provok]{.underline}**ing [or]{.underline} **[extend]{.underline}**ing
[war is]{.underline} **[wrong]{.underline}**.
[**[Hundreds]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[cyber-[incidents]{.mark}]{.underline} [[have
occurred]{.underline}]{.mark} [between rivals]{.underline} [with **long
histories**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[tension]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} even **[conflict]{.underline}**, [[but]{.underline}
**[none]{.underline}**]{.mark} has [ever]{.underline}
**[triggered]{.underline}** an **[escalation]{.underline}** [to
war]{.underline}. [North Korea]{.underline}, for example, [has
conducted]{.underline} [major]{.underline} [cyberattacks]{.underline}
[against South Korea]{.underline} [on]{.underline} at least [four
different]{.underline} [occasions]{.underline}, including the "Ten Days
of Rain" denial of service attack---in which a network is flooded with
an overwhelming number of requests, becoming temporarily inaccessible to
users---against South Korean government websites, financial
institutions, and critical infrastructure in 2011 and the "Dark Seoul"
attack in 2013, which disrupted service across the country's financial
and media sectors.

**[No]{.underline}** [cyber operation]{.underline} [has
**[ever]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[triggered]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[It would]{.underline} [be reasonable]{.underline} [to
expect]{.underline} that [these operations]{.underline} [might
escalate]{.underline} the situation on the Korean Peninsula, especially
because North Korea's war plans against South Korea reportedly involve
cyber-operations. **[Yet]{.underline}** [that is]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [what happened]{.underline}. Instead, in each
case, [the South Korean]{.underline} [response was]{.underline}
**[minimal]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[limited]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} either [direct]{.underline}, **[official
attribution]{.underline}** [to North Korea]{.underline} by government
officials or more indirect public suggestions that Pyongyang was likely
behind the attacks.

Similarly, [although]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[reserves]{.underline} [the right]{.underline} [to **respond** to
cyberattacks]{.underline} in any way it sees fit, including [with
**military force**]{.underline}, [it has]{.underline} until now
[[relied]{.underline} [on]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
**[sanctions]{.underline}**, **[indictments]{.underline}**,
[**[diplomatic]{.underline}** [actions]{.underline}]{.mark},
[and]{.underline} [some]{.underline} reported instances of
[tit-for-tat]{.underline} cyber-[responses]{.underline}. For example,
following Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,
the [Obama]{.underline} administration [expelled]{.underline} [35
Russian diplomats]{.underline} and shuttered two facilities said to be
hubs for Russian espionage. [The Treasury]{.underline} Department also
[levied]{.underline} economic [sanctions]{.underline} against Russian
officials. Yet according to media reports, [[the]{.underline}
**[admin]{.underline}**]{.mark}[istration]{.underline} ultimately
**[[rejected]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[plans]{.underline}** [to
**conduct**]{.underline} **[[retal]{.mark}iatory
cyber-operations]{.underline}** [against Russia]{.underline}. And
although the United States did use its own cyber-operations to respond
to Russian attacks during the 2018 midterm elections, it limited itself
to temporarily disrupting the Internet Research Agency, a Russian troll
farm.

[These]{.underline} measured [responses are]{.underline} [not
unusual]{.underline}. [Despite]{.underline} **[decades]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} [malicious behavior]{.underline} [in
cyberspace]{.underline}---[and **[no matter]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[the]{.mark} level]{.underline} [of
[destruction]{.mark}]{.underline}[---[cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}
[have **[always]{.mark}**]{.underline} [been]{.underline}
**[[contain]{.mark}ed [below]{.mark}]{.underline}** [the level
of]{.underline} **[armed [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Indeed,
[researchers]{.underline} have [found]{.underline} [that
major]{.underline} [adversarial [powers]{.mark}]{.underline} across the
world [have]{.underline} [**[routinely observe]{.mark}**d]{.underline}
[**[a]{.underline}** "**[firebreak]{.underline}**" **[between
cyber]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[attacks]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}
**[conventional]{.underline}**]{.mark} military operations:
[a]{.underline} **[mutually understood]{.underline}**
**[line]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} [distinguishes]{.underline}
[strategic interactions]{.underline} [above and below it]{.underline},
[similar]{.underline} [to the]{.underline} **[threshold]{.underline}**
[that exists]{.underline} [for]{.underline} the employment of
[**nuclear** weapons]{.underline}.
