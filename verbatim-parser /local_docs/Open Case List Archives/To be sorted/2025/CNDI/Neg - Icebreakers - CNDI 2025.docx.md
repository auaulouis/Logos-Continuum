[[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[Canada and Finland have [agreed to]{.mark} coordinate]{.underline}
their [development of new **[icebreaking]{.mark}** vessels]{.underline}

At the NATO Washington summit in July, [Canada, Finland and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [announced a collaboration on
development of new icebreaking ships.]{.underline} The Icebreaker
Collaboration Effort, a non-binding agreement colloquially known as [the
**[ICE Pact]{.mark}**, will [enable]{.mark} the three countries to
**[strengthen]{.mark}** their **[shipbuilding]{.mark}** industries
through information sharing, workforce development and procurement
alignment]{.underline}. Arctic concerns are growing in Washington, which
published an updated strategy for the region earlier this year.

What next

A joint memorandum of understanding that outlines a framework for
implementing the arrangement is expected to be signed before 2025, and
the Biden administration may push for this to happen ahead of next
month's US presidential election. The memorandum will also include a
mechanism for admitting other countries into the ICE Pact; Russian and
Chinese interest in the Arctic may encourage others to join.

Subsidiary Impacts

A bipartisan congressional group has asked the White House to prioritise
service to the Great Lakes region within the ICE Pact framework.

Quebec-based [[Davie]{.mark}, Canada's largest shipbuilder]{.underline},
has announced [[plans to open a shipyard in the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates.

Last month, China sent its three vessels into the Arctic and announced
that it would fast track the construction of a fourth icebreaker.

Analysis

The [[ICE Pact sends]{.mark} an [**immediate signal** to
**industry**]{.mark} partners tha]{.underline}t Canada, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and Finland [are committed to
purchasing more icebreakers. [**Shipbuilders** are **responding** by
**investing** in]{.mark} [**supply chains** and **shipyards**]{.mark} in
anticipation of these orders, positioning themselves to earn procurement
contracts when public funding for new projects is made
available.]{.underline}

The arrangement reflects NATO's awareness of the Arctic's growing
importance, particularly as Russia and China seek to assert their
presence in the region with icebreaker fleets of their own. In the
medium-to-long term, [collaborative [**workforce development** and
**info**]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation [sharing [will **shorten**]{.mark}
the timeline for [icebreaker]{.mark} design and [construction]{.mark},
giving the ICE Pact partners an opportunity [to **close the

Defense Magazine; National Defense Magazine, "Trilateral Pact Aims To
Bolster Icebreaker Production,"
https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2024/10/23/trilateral-pact-aims-to-bolster-icebreaker-production\]

[The recent announcement of a [collaborative agreement]{.mark} between
Finland, Canada and the United States]{.underline} [to build polar
icebreakers]{.underline} comes as China has declared itself a
"near-Arctic state" and Russia is operating the largest fleet of
icebreakers in the world, including the only ones that are
nuclear-powered.

But the pact [is]{.underline} as much [about **[bolstering allied
shipbuilding industries]{.mark}** as it is about addressing global
threats]{.underline}, [and all [**three nations** have something to
**gain**]{.mark}, experts said.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or **[[ICE
Pact]{.underline}]{.mark}**, announced on the sidelines of NATO's 75th
anniversary summit in Washington, D.C., July 11, is a trilateral
agreement between the three nations to collaborate on the production of
polar icebreakers alongside allies and partners, labor and industry.

A statement from the White House announcing the agreement said the
collaboration i[s [intended to "strengthen]{.mark} the
**[shipbuilding]{.mark} industry** and **industrial capacity** of each
nation"]{.underline} and "build closer security and economic ties among
our countries through information exchange and mutual workforce
development focused on building polar icebreakers, as well as other
Arctic and polar capabilities."

The details of the agreement remain hazy, with a memorandum of
understanding promised "by the end of the year," but the statement said
the three governments intend to utilize shipyards in the United States,
Canada and Finland to "build polar icebreakers for their own use, as
well as to work closely with like-minded allies and partners to build
and export polar icebreakers for their needs at speed and affordable
cost."

U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters the day of
the announcement that the pact is about "enhancing the collective
capacity of our three countries to build icebreakers at a time when we
are seeing an increasing need for those icebreakers from partners around
the world who want to operate in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions."

[This "increasing need" puts **[added pressure]{.mark}** [on a **U.S.
shipbuilding industry**]{.mark} that is already a **weak link** in the
**country's** **defense industrial base**]{.underline}, [[suffering from
**delayed programs**]{.mark}, [maintenance]{.mark} **backlogs** and
[**workforce** and supply chain **shortages**]{.mark}, according to
government watchdogs.]{.underline}

The U.S. Coast Guard has only two operational polar icebreakers: the
heavy Polar Star and the medium Healy. Polar Star was commissioned in
1976 and Healy in 2000. Both the fleet's size and age create maintenance
vulnerabilities that could cut the fleet in half if one is out of
commission.

The service has been working to expand its fleet through the Polar
Security Cutter program, which has been "plagued by delays" and more
than doubled in cost, according to a report by the Congressional Budget
Office released in August.

An October Congressional Research Service report noted that the Coast
Guard needs eight or nine polar icebreakers, and the first of the new
ships is not likely to enter service until 2029. That raises questions
about what the United States will be able to deliver under the pact when
it is struggling to meet its own demand.

A letter to the White House signed Oct. 2 by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.,
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security,
Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said a
reliable icebreaker fleet is "critical" to achieving strategic
objectives in the Arctic.

[The letter also said that [strengthening]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
shipbuilding industry of each [ICE Pact]{.mark} country and generating
"**good jobs at shipyards** and related businesses all over" [is]{.mark}
[the **aim** of the **partnership**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- especially
for advancing polar icebreaker recapitalization in the United States
that is "far too slow."

[**[Finland]{.mark}** [and **Canada**]{.mark} [can help, bringing to the
**agreement** a **history** of icebreaker design and **shipbuilding
experience**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Canada has the second largest
icebreaker fleet in the world behind Russia. Meanwhile, 60 percent of
the world's icebreakers are produced at Finnish shipyards and 80 percent
are designed by Finnish companies, according to the Finnish government.

A Canadian government release said the country's "world-class expertise
in Arctic and polar capabilities" will be "foundational" to the
agreement's success.

#### Trump is committed to the ICE pact 

Craig **Hooper**, 1-10-20**25**, \"The ICE Pact And New Icebreakers
Offers Trump Quick Wins\", Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2025/01/10/the-ice-pact-and-new-icebreakers-offers-trump-quick-wins/

Over the past decade, few observers realized that President-Elect Donald
[Trump's maritime enthusiasms]{.underline} have [had lasting strategic
value]{.underline}. Take icebreakers. In his first term in office,
President [Trump regularly celebrated icebreaker]{.underline}-building
and [called for]{.underline} a big [boost to America's icebreaker
fleet]{.underline}. Today, an opportunity to promote icebreakers offers
Trump some quick wins. Trump's early interest in boosting America's
icebreaker fleet---potentially with Finnish help---endured and extended
into the Biden Administration. Over the past four years, Trump's
thoughts on [boosting]{.underline} America's [icebreaker]{.underline}
industrial base grew into a [full-fledged international
agreement.]{.underline} And, in November, as a triumphant
President-Elect Donald Trump visited the White House, the outgoing
[Biden Administration quietly finalized a three-country
icebreaker-building framework]{.underline}. The subsequent agreement
with Canada and Finland, called the "Icebreaker Collaboration Effort
([ICE) Pact]{.underline}", [sets Trump up to finally build the
icebreakers]{.underline} he wanted. Trump wants icebreakers within the
next four years. In a 2020 "Memorandum on Safeguarding U.S. National
Interests in the Arctic and Antarctic Regions," President Trump was
quite clear in calling for a "ready, capable, and available fleet of
polar security icebreakers that is operationally tested and fully
deployable by Fiscal Year 2029." For an incoming president with a flair
for Polar strategy, the [ICE Pact offers]{.underline} some enormous
[opportunities]{.underline}. By moving quickly to survey performance on
America's existing icebreaker program and encourage big new shipbuilding
investments, Trump staffer can, within weeks, chalk up some big
cost-cutting and capability-boosting wins. [Public
confidence]{.underline} from quick ICE Pact-driven wins will [have wider
ramifications]{.underline}, bolstering the Trump Administration's
credibility as it takes on other, more ambitious ventures. Icebreakers
are an easy win. They're not controversial. [Both parties fundamentally
agree]{.underline} with President Trump's June 2020 call for fixing the
Coast Guard's icebreaker program and want to build a bigger Polar fleet.
The ICE Pact is a good way to do it. The [ICE Pact]{.underline},
[described as]{.underline} "a landmark [initiative that advances Arctic
and polar icebreaker development]{.underline}," positions the U.S.,
Finland and Canada to pool both their icebreaker requirements and their
capabilities, ultimately generating a larger market for the ships.
According to a DHS press release generated for the occasion, "the
collective investment in our domestic shipyards has the potential to
scale production and reduce the cost of Arctic and polar icebreakers for
our own use and for our allies and partners." In the race to move beyond
the old Biden Administration, [incoming Trump staffers]{.underline}
[would be unwise to set aside and kill the ICE Pact]{.underline} for a
short-term political demonstration of power. But the temptation is
there. An odd corps of swampy Washington DC pugilists are ready to
pounce, with their attacks likely supplemented by political pressure
from shipbuilding companies. Internationally, both Russia and China have
a vested interest in halting reform of America's poor-performing
icebreaker-building efforts, and are likely to be wielding their own
"influencing campaigns. Regardless of influence, some committed
partisans will simply approach the ICE Pact as little more than a
hurried Biden "win" that merits a rapid political death. That would be a
mistake. The ICE Pact is too good to pass up. Before Trump's win, [ICE
Pact critics regularly ignored the wider context,]{.underline}
forgetting that Donald Trump had, in his first administration, actively
championed the recovery of America's dwindling operational capabilities
at the North and South Poles. With the ICE Pact, America can quickly use
some ruthless free market levers to impose cost-cutting discipline on
the Coast Guard's existing icebreaker-building efforts. Even better, the
ICE Pact lets America exploit other countries' icebreaker know-how to
"on-shore" polar-oriented naval engineering talent, giving U.S.
shipbuilders access to some of the best, low-cost icebreaker designs in
the world. By "on-shoring" Finnish know-how, and supporting a Canadian
company's ongoing effort to set up the West's center of polar-ready ship
production in America, Trump [can create healthy industrial
competition]{.underline} at home while bolstering America's future at
both ends of the earth. In short, the agreement can help America compete
with the world in making icebreakers and other polar-ready craft.
There's little time to waste. Without a good-sized fleet of at least
four to five heavy Polar icebreakers and four to five medium,
lighter-duty Arctic icebreakers, America will be able to do little in
preventing China and Russia from carrying out a territorial "land grab"
in both the Arctic region and on the Antarctic continent. Pushing a
fleet of American-flagged icebreakers into the Polar Oceans can level
the playing field, protecting key resources from China and Russia.
Icebreakers Offers Trump Quick Wins

#### Trump's controversy hasn't affected ICE pact -- commitment remains strong 

Elisabeth **Gosselin-Malo**, 1-28-20**25**, \"Can fresh icebreakers
break the ice between the US and Canada?\", Defense News,
https://www.defensenews.com/naval/2025/01/28/can-fresh-icebreakers-break-the-ice-between-the-us-and-canada/

MILAN --- An [agreement]{.underline} between Finland, Canada, and the
United States [to jointly build icebreaker ships]{.underline} may hold
the key to deeper cooperation between the Arctic nations, as Washington
has set out to boost its fleet against Russian and Chinese efforts to
ramp up their own. The Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or [ICE
Pact]{.underline}, [was signed in July 2024]{.underline} on the occasion
of NATO's 75th anniversary summit in Washington. [It aims to
combine]{.underline} the [three nations' knowledge]{.underline},
resources, [and expertise about the Arctic]{.underline} region in
general and polar icebreaker construction in particular. The core
ambition of the agreement is to collectively build best-in-class ice
boats capable of year-round operations in Arctic waters, plowing
pathways for maritime traffic in a region being transformed by climate
change. Teaming up in a cluster of countries, the [idea]{.underline}
goes, will [lead to better prices and speedier deliveries]{.underline}
for the governments involved. Officials signed an additional memorandum
of understanding last November in Washington to emphasize that the
strategic context of polar regions requires deeper economic and security
cooperation between the three partners. The new U.S. president, Donald
Trump, who was sworn into office this month, has since made disparaging
comments about fellow Arctic players Canada and Greenland, suggesting
that both should become part of the United States. The statement has
prompted pushback from leaders in Canada and Denmark, of which Greenland
is a district, with neither country prepared to have their territorial
integrity challenged by a longstanding ally. A spokesperson for Public
Services and Procurement of Canada, which represents Ottawa's central
purchasing agent in the ICE Pact, said [Trump's combative
talk]{.underline} has [not affected]{.underline} the spirit of the
[icebreaker agreement]{.underline}. "[Canada remains steadfast in its
commitment]{.underline} to the ICE Pact, our collaboration efforts with
the U.S. and Finland continue as planned -- there are currently no
changes to our agreement or initiatives," a representative said in a
Jan. 22 email to Defense News. The three nations have each appointed a
national coordination team for the ICE Pact, which is working to
formulate a plan of action through four working groups, the spokesperson
added. Among the initial priorities outlined by [Trump]{.underline}
during his first term as president was the need to bolster America's
icebreaker fleet. In 2020, he [emphasized that the country needed a
"ready]{.underline}, capable, and available [fleet of polar security
icebreakers]{.underline} that would be operationally tested and fully
deployable by fiscal year 2029," he wrote in a memo. [Washington is far
from reaching this goal]{.underline}, then-commandant of the U.S. Coast
Guard, Adm. Linda Fagan, noted during the Halifax International Security
Forum last November. "So as a nation, we have one heavy icebreaker ...
\[Russia\] has way more than one. It's close to 40," she said during a
panel discussion, as reported by National Defense Magazine. It is
important to distinguish that even as icebreakers are a highly specific
type of ship, countries have different ways of classifying them. While
the U.S. and Canada use a classification system of light, medium and
heavy ships for different types of ice cover, Russia's large fleet is
typically split into categories based on their mission type and other
technical characteristics. In 2023, the Canadian shipyard Davie took
over Finland's Helsinki Shipyard, which produced over 50% of the global
icebreaker fleet. The acquisition entailed a transfer of Finland's
leading expertise, designs and trained personnel into Canadian hands.
The current demand for such specialized ships is at an all-time high, a
statement from Davie said, with over 80 open projects among Western
countries as of last July. Experts have argued that the U.S. defense
industrial base is set to greatly benefit from the ICE Pact, as
America's naval shipbuilding industry has been beset by schedule delays
and cost overruns.

#### Trump committed to icebreaker fleet now 

Craig **Hooper**, 1-28-20**25**, \"In A New Surprise, President Trump
Announces America Will Order 40 Big Icebreakers\", Forbes,
[[https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2025/01/28/in-a-new-surprise-president-trump-announces-america-will-order-40-big-icebreakers/]{.underline}](https://www.forbes.com/sites/craighooper/2025/01/28/in-a-new-surprise-president-trump-announces-america-will-order-40-big-icebreakers/)

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} is continuing his first-term [focus
on]{.underline} building a big, [new American icebreaker]{.underline}
fleet. Days after his second inauguration, the president broke from a
North Carolina hurricane-recovery briefing and made a surprise
announcement that, "[we're going to order about 40 big
icebreakers]{.underline}." The statement, widely dismissed by industry
experts as a gaffe, was well-timed. Just as the Trump was committing the
United States to a massive, as-yet un-funded 40-icebreaker buildup, a
raggedy set of aged American icebreaking tugs were struggling to free a
663-foot transport ship, the Canadian-flagged Manitoulin, trapped by
wind-blown lake ice. The endangered cargo vessel, likely rushing to beat
Trump's threatened 25% tariff on Canadian goods, had just unloaded a
cargo of Canadian wheat in Buffalo and got stuck in the ice outside the
frosty New York port. With the local Coast Guard ship---icebreaking tug
Bristol Bay (WTGB 102)---not up to the task of breaking thick,
wind-blown harbor ice on its own, a second American icebreaking tug, the
Neah Bay (WTGB 105), was called in. Nothing worked. Later, as the
weather improved, a more robust icebreaker, the Canadian Coast Guard
Ship Samuel Risley, finally managed to free the ship. A few lakes away,
America's sole purpose-built fresh water icebreaker, the U.S. Coast
Guard Cutter Mackinaw (WLBB 30), cut a maintenance availability short to
rumble into action. The multi-day effort to free the Manitoulin is a big
deal, reinforcing industry-driven concerns that the Great Lakes requires
better icebreaking support to be competitive in the 21st Century.
According to the Lake Carriers' Association, inadequate icebreaking
resources in the Great Lakes, can, in a single tough season, inflict up
to a billion dollars of damage to the U.S. economy and cost about 5,000
jobs. 40 Big Icebreakers Boosts Aging Fleet President
[Trump's]{.underline} commitment to bulk up the U.S. [icebreaker fleet
is a welcome development.]{.underline} The [Coast Guard
icebreakers]{.underline} that finally freed the Manitoulin [are old and
ready for replacement]{.underline} by new tugs or dual-use breakers
capable of working in either the Arctic or the Great Lakes. While most
of the attention is focused on the ancient U.S. fleet of large,
showpiece icebreakers---the ancient USCGC Polar Star and the less
capable USCGC Healy---the Coast Guard's ice management workhorses,
lower-profile "utility" icebreaking ships---the icebreaking tugs and
buoy tenders that do a lot of the low-profile, day-to-day work of
breaking up ice jams or freeing frozen harbor infrastructure---are
getting old, too. As the breakout progressed, North America's icebreaker
age gap was on full display. USCGC Neah Bay and USCGC Bristol Bay,
representatives of the Coast Guard's 9-ship fleet of 140-foot
icebreaking tugs, were launched in the late 1970's and early 80's. With
the fleet well into their fourth decade of service, and their
cash-strapped operators acutely sensitive to the need to nurse aging
systems aboard the old vessels, these handy harbor-clearing utility
vessels will be less and less useful in a pinch. Despite going through a
comprehensive refit, these ships will need replacement by the 2030's.
But the U.S. isn't the only country that needs new mid-sized
icebreakers. The larger Canadian Coast Guard Ship Samuel Risley---the
breaker that finally helped unstuck the Manitoulin---is 40 years old.
Little more than an ice-hardened oilfield utility vessel, modern,
multi-mission Coast Guards have largely outgrown such simple craft. But
as a robust buoy tender, the Canadian vessel is still certified to break
two feet of ice and the ship can reportedly maintain progress through
ice that is almost three feet thick. Unlike America's old fleet of
icebreaking tugs, the aging Canadian cutter can take on limited tasks in
the Arctic. Despite an industry preference for specialized, fresh water
icebreakers for Great Lakes work, dual-use capability is a template to
follow. In the past, American icebreakers split their time between
winter service on the Great Lakes and Antarctic support work in the
summer. The Samuel Risley has successfully operated in the waters around
Greenland, supporting an annual voyage to resupply the isolated Thule
airbase---offering a useful operational template if Trump is interested
in securing strategic outposts in Greenland. Given that both countries
have old ice management fleets, collaboration makes sense. Frankly,
Canada is farther ahead in refreshing their mid-sized icebreaker fleet
than America, and, with strong ties to Finland, Canada is well
positioned to leverage Finland's polar-focused naval architecture
capabilities, backfilling a massive U.S. skills deficit. U.S. efforts to
leverage Finland's intellectual property can be combined with boosting
the demand signal, lowering the per-unit costs. Canada already plans to
procure up to six "heavy program icebreakers", robust mid-size vessels
capable of working both in the Arctic and in the Great Lakes. America
could certainly use a good handful of these handy-size icebreakers, as
well. Assuming control of the building program is a neat prospect. With
each "heavy program icebreaker" capable of breaking 4.5 feet of ice,
cargo vessels in the Great Lakes can extend their operational seasons
with less risk, while, in the American northwest, Nome and other
traditionally ice-bound Alaskan harbors with low draft requirements can
stay open longer, operating with the confidence that fuel and other key
supplies won't be interrupted. With Trump threatening big tariffs, a big
trade could be in the offing. If Canada-based Davie Shipbuilding commits
to invest in the United States, supporting at least one new U.S.
shipyard, American shipbuilders could work with Davie's Finland-based
experts to acquire the design, gain basic icebreaker fabrication skills
and start a massive 40-icebreaker production run, some of which Canada,
Finland and others, could then, potentially, purchase or lease. [The
business case for icebreakers in the Arctic and Antarctic is
clear.]{.underline} Rather than dismissing President Trump's surprise
commitment for 40 big icebreakers as a childish gaffe, it might be
[smart to consider this announcement t]{.underline}he [first glimpse of

#### Trump is [obsessed]{.underline} with shipbuilding capacity. Other areas solve.

Reporters at Reuters; Reuters, "Trump signs executive order seeking to
revitalize US shipbuilding,"
https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trump-expected-sign-executive-order-us-shipbuilding-sources-2025-04-09/\]

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [signed an
[ex]{.mark}]{.underline}ecutive [[o]{.underline}]{.mark}rder [on
Wednesday [aimed at **reviving** ]{.mark}U.S.
**[shipbuilding]{.mark}**]{.underline} and reducing China\'s grip on the
global shipping industry, [vowing to **[boost funding]{.mark}** for the
effort in **coming years**.]{.underline}

[**Republican** and **Democratic** U.S. [lawmakers]{.mark} for years
have [warned]{.mark} about [China\'s]{.mark} **growing
[dominance]{.mark}** on the seas [and]{.mark} **diminishing U.S. naval
[readiness]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Senators Mark Kelly, a Democrat, and Todd Young, a Republican, welcomed
the executive order and said they would reintroduce their bipartisan
legislation to provide the congressional authorizations needed to
revitalize the industry.

The order directs the U.S. Trade Representative to move ahead with a
proposal that included levying million-dollar U.S. port docking fees on
any ship that is part of a fleet that includes Chinese-built or
Chinese-flagged vessels. Allies will be pushed to act similarly.

USTR\'s recommended port fees had sparked sharp criticism from
commodities exporters, trade groups and U.S. ship operators, who warned
of supply chain disruptions, job losses in port cities and inflation.
The order must be finalized by an April 17 deadline.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday said USTR should
have a final decision on remedies by middle of the month and repeated
his comments from Tuesday, saying that not all of the measures outlined
by the agency\'s original proposal would be implemented.

\"This could have been a miscommunication issue, some people thought
that all of those measures would be imposed,\" Greer said. But after
feedback and public comments, \"now we consider which of those measures
is most appropriate.\"

The order also requires USTR to consider proposing tariffs on
ship-to-shore cranes manufactured, assembled, or made using components
of Chinese origin, or manufactured anywhere in the world by a company
owned, controlled, or substantially influenced by a Chinese citizen, as
well as tariffs on other cargo handling equipment.

The executive order further requires the Department of Homeland Security
to enforce collection of Harbor Maintenance Fees and other charges, and
to prevent cargo carriers from circumventing those fees by routing goods
to ports in Mexico and Canada and then sending cargo into the United
States via land borders.

Asked about the U.S. order on Thursday, China\'s foreign ministry said
the idea that China was to blame for the U.S. losing its competitive
advantage in the shipping industry had no basis in fact.

\"The development of China\'s shipbuilding industry is the result of
technological innovation and active participation in market competition
by enterprises,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular press
conference.

**[Trump]{.underline}**, [speaking in the Oval Office]{.underline},
[said [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would be spending \"a lot of
**money on** ]{.mark}**shipbuilding**\" [to **restore**
]{.mark}**American** [**capacity**]{.mark} in the
**sector**.]{.underline}

\"[We\'re **way, way, way behind**]{.underline},\" he told reporters.
\"[We used to build a ship a day, and]{.underline} [now we don\'t do a
ship a year]{.underline}, practically, and we have the capacity to do
it.\"

The order said recent data showed the United States built less than 1%
of commercial ships globally, while China built about half, an increase
from just 5% in 1999, according to the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.

[Trump\'s order called for creation of a Maritime Security Trust Fund to
provide reliable [funding for programs aimed at **shoring up U.S.
maritime capacity**]{.mark}, **including**]{.underline} consideration of
potential new or existing tariff revenue, fines, fees, or tax revenue.

It also calls for incentives to encourage private investment in
construction of commercial components, and improvements to shipyards,
repair facilities and dry docks.

[The **U.S. shipbuilding industry**]{.underline}, which peaked in the
1970s, [has struggled due to high costs and a complex regulatory
structure, which has **enabled rivals** including China to **grow
rapidly**.]{.underline}

### No S -- Timeframe Delays

#### Icebreakers take years of development-cost overruns mean even current construction delayed until 2028

**Humpert 24** \[Malte Humpert, 5-3-2024, \"U.S. Coast Guard Polar
Security Cutter Program Faces Substantial Cost Overrun and Delay Until
2029\", gCaptain,

noodle☺\]

The initial [Polar Security Cutter (PSC]{.underline}), which has been
awaiting the start of construction since VT Halter Marine was awarded a
contract in 2019, [is now estimated to come in at \$1.9
billion]{.underline}, with subsequent vessels at \$1.6 billion. The
total procurement costs for [the first three vessels will total around
\$5.1 billion]{.underline} the CBO calculates, [60 percent higher than
even the most recent estimate]{.underline} provided by the Coast Guard
just two months ago. Since VT Halter Marine -- now part of Bollinger
Shipyards -- was awarded the program contract in 2019 the procurement
costs for the vessels have more than doubled. The original fixed-price
incentive design and build contract for the [first PSC was valued at
\$746 million. The second and third PSC were expected to cost \$555
million and \$546 million. The cost of the entire three-vessel program,
including procurement of long lead-time materials for a fourth vessel,
was estimated at under \$2 billion.]{.underline} The PSCs are intended
to replace the USCG's two operational icebreakers, Polar Star and Healy.
Both [vessels have faced mechanical mishaps, including fires and a main
propulsion motor replacement.]{.underline} Polar Star is quickly
approaching the end of its service life and is kept afloat by scavenging
spare parts from its inoperative sister ship Polar Sea. In recent
comments to gCaptain the USCG confirmed that initial work on prototype
steel modules had begun, but progress on the first three sections
remained limited. The full PSC consists of 85 modules. "The Coast Guard
is working with the shipbuilder to rebaseline \[the program\], which
will result in a new program schedule. This is expected to be completed
later this year and will be critical to informing future budget
requests," the spokesperson told gCaptain in March 2024. According to
the upcoming CBO report the Coast Guard hopes that the shipyard can
transition from test sections to begin "substantial construction on the
lead ship" by early 2025. [The delivery date for the first vessel has
been continuously pushed back from its original 2024
target.]{.underline} In congressional testimony last year USCG officials
targeted 2027 as a new delivery date, though some comments suggested the
[timeline could slip into 2028.]{.underline} The CBO now states that the
estimated delivery has been pushed back to 2029. This would suggest that
the USCG will not augment its heavy icebreaker presence before the
beginning of the next decade. As a stopgap measure it has secured \$125
million in funding to purchase Aiviq, an ice-capable offshore supply
vessel, from Edison Chouest.

#### Icebreakers facing major delays and cost overruns

[**Wilson 25**]{.mark}

noodle☺\]

Shipyards is moving forward with design work and construction of the
Coast Guard's [first new heavy icebreaker in five decades, part of a
program that has faced repeated delays and cost increases]{.underline}.
The Louisiana-based shipyard recently secured a \$951 million contract
for detailed design and further construction of the USCGC Polar
Sentinel, the first of three planned icebreakers, the company announced
Tuesday. Work on the cutter began in August 2023. Bollinger's
predecessor, VT Halter Marine, first secured a contract to build the
cutter in 2019 for \$745 million. Bollinger purchased VT Halter in 2022.
[Construction of the Polar Sentinel is now estimated to cost \$1.9
billion, according to an August 2024 report by the Congressional Budget
Office. That figure is 39% higher than the Coast Guard's own
projections]{.underline}. Subsequent ships are estimated at \$1.6
billion. The Polar Security Program aims to build at least three heavy
icebreakers to safeguard U.S. interests in the Arctic and Antarctic.
[The Coast Guard initially expected the Polar Sentinel to be operational
in 2024, but it is now unlikely to enter service until
2030]{.underline}, according to a Dec. 18 news release from U.S. Rep.
Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., chairman of the House Homeland Security
Subcommittee on Transportation and Maritime Security. [The nearly \$1
billion contract modification reflects "the growing urgency with which
their platforms are needed to boost our national defense,"]{.underline}
Ben Bordelon, president and CEO of Bollinger Shipyards, said in the
company's statement. The U.S. now operates only two aging icebreakers:
the 27-year-old medium icebreaker USCGC Healy and the 49-year-old heavy
icebreaker USCGC Polar Star. The Coast Guard's other heavy icebreaker,
the Polar Sea, has been out of service since 2010 due to engine failure.
By contrast, Russia operates a fleet of 55 icebreakers, while China has
four, U.S. Rep. Daniel Webster, R-Fla., noted in a Nov. 14 subcommittee
news release. "In the Arctic, the Coast Guard projects American
sovereignty in a region containing substantial resources that support a
robust fishing industry, vast energy and mineral reserves, and new
routes to facilitate maritime commerce," he wrote. Webster said it was
"no surprise" that Russia and China are asserting themselves in the
resource-rich region. To fill the gap until the new icebreakers are
built, the U.S. purchased a second medium icebreaker, the USCGC Storis,
for \$125 million in December. It is expected to enter service next
year. [The Polar Security Program has been "plagued by delays and cost
overruns," according to the Congressional Budget Office's report. It
estimated the cost of three heavy icebreakers at \$5.1 billion --- 60%
higher than the Coast Guard's projections.]{.underline} "It's been six
years since this program was authorized, and we still don't have a final
design," Gimenez said at a Dec. 18 subcommittee hearing. "It only took
us nine years to get to the moon."

### No S -- Resources 

#### Icebreakers not key to resource access. 

**Avey '19** \[Paul; assistant professor for political science at

Sciences at University of Chicago; War on the Rocks, "The Icebreaker Gap
Doesn't Mean America is Losing in the Arctic,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/11/the-icebreaker-gap-doesnt-mean-america-is-losing-in-the-arctic/\]

Finally, [[icebreakers **do not** give states the ability to claim
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} that will become available as climate
change leads to less ice coverage[. "Most Arctic [territory]{.mark} and
resources are [solidly within]{.mark} the [jurisdictions of Arctic
states]{.mark},"]{.underline} writes Kuersten. [[This is **not** the
19th century]{.mark}, when prospectors or military forces could stake
claims to new territory]{.underline}. For example, Douglas Porch
recounts how preoccupation with "effective occupation" led French
military forces in Africa to sacrifice basic prudence in a "desire to
steal a march on international competition." There should be no rush ---
and is no need --- to repeat these mistakes. Indeed, the [Pentagon's
recent Arctic strategy notes that [even "Russia has]{.mark} generally
[followed international law]{.mark} and procedure in establishing the
limits of its extended continental shelf."]{.underline}

To be sure, icebreakers are necessary to access polar areas even as ice
cover diminishes. They are an important element of Arctic sovereignty as
a result. However, [[the numbe]{.mark}r that [other countries
possess]{.mark} [does not affect]{.mark} the number that [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [requires to
provide access to its exclusive economic zone. [It is]{.mark} also
[unlikely]{.mark} that [a country would use icebreakers to stake a
claim]{.mark} to the U.S. Arctic.]{.underline} If it did, capabilities
other than icebreakers would be better suited to dislodging them should
diplomacy fail.

#### Arctic oil and gas is [expensive]{.underline} and [hard to ship]{.underline}. NSR importance is overblown. 

**Johnson '24** \[Keith; September 3; reporter at Foreign Policy
covering geoeconomics and energy; Newsweek, "The Arctic Great Game Won't
Be Won in U.S. Shipyards,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/09/03/arctic-nato-russia-us-china-icebreakers/\]

The Russian Arctic does have mind-boggling amounts of oil and natural
gas. (The U.S. and Canadian Arctic has lots, too, but [[it's]{.mark}
easier and [**cheaper** to frack in North Dakota than]{.mark} to drill
in [the Chukchi Sea.) Tapping]{.mark} those [oil and gas]{.mark}
reserves [is **challenging**]{.mark}]{.underline} enough, but Russia has
been able to do it, to an extent, despite a decade of Western sanctions
that have handicapped some of its frontier energy projects. [[The tricky
part is to move that gas]{.mark} from the frozen north to thirsty
markets in Asia:]{.underline} Arctic ice may be melting, but that
doesn't mean those are warm-water ports or easy to navigate.

Especially after the onset of the war in Ukraine, which largely
foreclosed European energy export markets to Russia, Arctic energy and
its shipping routes to the east have become a key strategic priority for
Putin. The Yamal Peninsula in northwest Siberia is the epicenter of
Russia's newfound trade in liquefied natural gas, or LNG; since piping
it to Europe is no longer an option, and China is proving a hard
bargainer on piped gas headed east, freezing it and shipping it out is
the future for Russian energy.

For Putin, the so-called Northern Sea Route (NSR)---the would-be
shipping lane across the top of Russia---is the embodiment of his
end-run around Europe and toward a full embrace with China. Moscow has
visions of the route becoming a genuine global sea lane to rival such
routes as the Suez Canal or the Panama Canal, no matter the fact that
container ships cannot and will not save a few days' journey by
venturing into shallow, ice-filled, foggy waters that Russia calls its
own and taxes as such. In 2023, [[the NSR]{.mark} had its [best
year]{.mark} yet, [shipping]{.mark} a whopping [36 million]{.mark}
metric [tons. The Suez]{.mark} Canal]{.underline}, when not disrupted by
Houthis, [[transits that much]{.mark} cargo **[in a
week.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Squo solves. New sanctions, pressure. Icebreakers are [irrelevant]{.underline} compared to [economic tools.]{.underline} 

**Johnson '24** \[Keith; September 3; reporter at Foreign Policy
covering geoeconomics and energy; Newsweek, "The Arctic Great Game Won't
Be Won in U.S. Shipyards,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/09/03/arctic-nato-russia-us-china-icebreakers/\]

There is one **[[vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, though. About
half the traffic on the NSR is LNG exports. [[Shipping
gas]{.underline}]{.mark} through ice floes [[requires
icebreaking]{.mark} LNG [tankers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those were
previously being [[built for Russia in So]{.underline}]{.mark}uth
[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}rea, [[but]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark} war
**[put paid to that]{.mark}**,]{.underline} with Seoul canceling the
pending delivery of new ice-class tankers. (Western dry docks are still
servicing the existing fleet, though.) [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} is
trying to build some of its own, and probably can, but it [[may
**struggle** to master]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the [advanced
[cargo]{.mark} containment [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology that was a
Western monopoly, Hovilainen said.

[That is [part of]{.mark} an evolving Western [strategy to **strike**
at]{.mark} the [**Russian weakness**]{.mark} in the Arctic.]{.underline}
Just after the invasion of Ukraine, [Western [sanctions
**poleaxed**]{.mark} the big [LNG liquefaction]{.mark} facility in the
Yamal Peninsula]{.underline}, which was reliant on Western technology.
Novatek, the private Russian company plowing ahead, now hopes to
jury-rig a solution to get its gas super-chilled and super-moving by
2026, but it is employing unproven workarounds. [[The
facility]{.underline}]{.mark} upped production and even started exports
this summer but [[is]{.mark} still running **[below
capacity.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The West has found other chinks in the armor. This summer, [[the
E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion, in its 14th
sanctions package on Russia, [specifically [targeted]{.mark} Russian
[transshipment]{.mark} of LNG [in European
ports]{.mark}]{.underline}---Moscow would use precious ice tankers to
ship gas south, then move the gas to a regular tanker for export
overseas. With that trade foreclosed, [Russia's hard-worked LNG tanker
fleet will have to make the full run from Siberia to the final
destination and back again, essentially [cutting its]{.mark}
energy-export [capacity]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Or take the latest Western step to hit Russia. In late August, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [went after Russia's LNG
[**shadow fleet**]{.mark} with new [sanctions]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
latest sanctions not only [**[intensify]{.mark}** the
**[pressure]{.mark}** on Russian gas production and liquefaction in the
Arctic]{.underline}, but they also [[take aim at]{.mark} the fleet of
specialized [tankers]{.mark}]{.underline} that Moscow needs to build up
in order to get its product to its last remaining big market. The goal,
the U.S. State Department said, is [[to]{.mark} "further
**[disrupt]{.mark}**"]{.underline} both [[**production** and
**export**]{.mark} of Arctic LNG]{.underline}, especially relevant now
that the big plant in Yamal is up and running again.

If there is a great-power competition in the Arctic, it is only
existential for one of the players. And [t[he recipe for success is
**not**]{.mark} building [more icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, welcome
as they may be, [[but]{.mark} making sure that those in Russian hands
are opening leads to nowhere.]{.underline}

"We are [[**pressuring** Russia with **economic tools**]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}, which is a cost-effective means of pursuing our
goals. Russia's icebreaker fleet is all about energy exports to Asia,"
Pincus said. "That's why the sanctions are smart. If we can sustain
them, and the Russian Arctic oil and gas reserves and facilities become
stranded assets, then what is the Arctic to Russia? That could end up
starving the NSR."

#### No heg decline - durable

**Babones 15** (Salvatore, professor at university of sydney, "American
Hegemony Is Here to Stay," June 11, 2015
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/american-hegemony-here-stay-13089)

Or so the story goes. In fact, [reports of the passing of U.S. hegemony
are greatly exaggerated]{.underline}. America's costly wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan were relatively minor affairs considered in long-term
perspective. The strategic challenge posed by China has also been
exaggerated. Together with its inner circle of unshakable
English-speaking allies, [the United States possesses near-total control
of the world's seas, skies, airwaves and cyberspace, while American
universities, think tanks and journals dominate the world of
ideas.]{.underline} Put aside all the alarmist punditry. [American
[heg]{.mark}emony [is now as firm as or firmer than it has ever been,
and will remain so for a long time to come]{.mark}.]{.underline} THE
MASSIVE federal deficit, negative credit-agency reports, repeated
debt-ceiling crises and the 2013 government shutdown all created the
impression that the U.S. government is bankrupt, or close to it. The
U.S. economy imports half a trillion dollars a year more than it
exports. Among the American population, poverty rates are high and
ordinary workers' wages have been stagnant (in real terms) for decades.
Washington seems to be paralyzed by perpetual gridlock. On top of all
this, strategic exhaustion after two costly wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
has substantially degraded U.S. military capabilities. Then, at the very
moment the military needed to regroup, rebuild and rearm, its budget was
hit by sequestration. If economic power forms the long-term foundation
for political and military power, it would seem that America is in
terminal decline. But policy analysts tend to have short memories.
[[Cycles of heg]{.mark}emony [run in centuries, not
decades]{.mark}]{.underline} (or seasons). When the United Kingdom
finally defeated Napoleon at Waterloo in 1815, its national resources
were completely exhausted. Britain's public-debt-to-GDP ratio was over
250 percent, and early nineteenth-century governments lacked access to
the full range of fiscal and financial tools that are available today.
Yet the British Century was only just beginning. The Pax Britannica and
the elevation of Queen Victoria to become empress of India were just
around the corner. By comparison, [[America]{.mark}'s current
public-debt-to- GDP ratio of less than 80 percent is]{.underline}
relatively [benign]{.underline}. Those with even a limited historical
memory may remember the day in January 2001 when the then chairman of
the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, testified to the Senate Budget
Committee that "if current policies remain in place, the total unified
surplus will reach \$800 billion in fiscal year 2011. . . . The emerging
key fiscal policy need is to address the implications of maintaining
surpluses." As the poet said, bliss was it in that dawn to be alive! Two
tax cuts, two wars and one financial crisis later, America's budget
deficit was roughly the size of the projected surplus that so worried
Greenspan. This is not to argue that the U.S. government should ramp up
taxes and spending, but it does illustrate the fact that [it [has
enormous potential fiscal resources available]{.mark}]{.underline} to
it, should it choose to use them. Deficits come and go. America's fiscal
capacity in 2015 is stupendously greater than Great Britain's was in
1815. [Financially, [there is every reason to think that America's
century lies in the future, not in the past]{.mark}. The same is true of
the supposed exhaustion of the U.S. military.]{.underline} On the one
hand, thirteen years of continuous warfare have reduced the readiness of
many U.S. combat units, particularly in the army. On the other hand[,
[U.S. troops are now far more experienced]{.mark}]{.underline} in actual
combat [[than]{.mark} the forces of [any other major military]{.mark} in
the world]{.underline}. In any future conflict, the advantage given by
this experience would likely outweigh any decline in effectiveness due
to deferred maintenance and training. Constant deployment may place an
unpleasant and unfair burden on U.S. service personnel and their
families, but it does not necessarily diminish the capability of the
U.S. military. On the contrary, it may enhance it. [America's limited
wars]{.underline} in Afghanistan and Iraq [were hardly the final throes
of a passing hegemon]{.underline}. They are more akin to Britain's
bloody but relatively inconsequential conflicts in Afghanistan and
Crimea in the middle of the nineteenth century. Brutal wars like these
repeatedly punctured, but never burst, British hegemony. In fact,
Britain engaged in costly and sometimes disastrous conflicts throughout
the century-long Pax Britannica. British hegemony did not come to an end
until the country faced Germany head-on in World War I. Even then,
Britain ultimately prevailed (with American help). Its empire reached
its maximum extent not before World War I but immediately after, in
1922. [Ultimately, it is inevitable that in the long run American power
will weaken and American hegemony over the rest of the world will fade.
But how long is the long run? **[There are few]{.mark} factual
[indications that American decline]{.mark} has begun---or that it [will
begin anytime soon]{.mark}. Short-term fluctuations should not be
extrapolated into long-term trends**]{.underline}. Without a doubt, 1991
was a moment of supreme U.S. superiority. But so was 1946, after which
came the Soviet bomb, Korea and Vietnam[. American hegemony has waxed
and waned over the last seventy years, but it has never been eclipsed.
And it is unlikely that the eclipse is nigh.]{.underline}

\*STWM = Steps to War Model

Our **[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [applied]{.underline} the
three [**main** indicators of **STWM**]{.underline} to the Arctic region
with regard to the Arctic Council states in the period [since
**2014**]{.underline}. We have sought to [answer whether]{.underline}
the [conflict]{.underline} potential has been [trending
upwards]{.underline} since 2014 and how close it is to a critical
threshold based on recent developments. The [outcomes [show **clear**
evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} confirming [rising **confrontational**
behaviour]{.underline} in the militarisation marker. On the other hand,
the rivalry indicator shows [continued [**cooperative**
behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}, while the coalition-building analysis
also [shows a **mostly** cooperative approach]{.underline} in the
post-Crimea period, then a sharp decline after February 2022.

Thus, the STWM, as one of the most sensitive models of escalation
potential of territorial disputes, confirms confrontational behaviour in
two indicators, militarisation and coalition-building. The latter,
however, changed dramatically after February 2022. Regional Arctic
coalitions have suspended most forms of cooperation with Russia, and two
of the regional actors, Finland and Sweden, applied for NATO membership
in May 2022 with Finland joining in April 2023 and Sweden's membership
awaiting Turkish ratification as of November 2023. Since all three
indicators of the STWM must show the relevant trends in order to signal
increased likelihood of international armed conflict, [in the case
of]{.underline} the **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such
[[conflict]{.mark} is **[not predicted]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Thus, while the research clearly shows a [rise in conflict
**potential**]{.underline}, critically, the [[**rivalry**
factor]{.underline}]{.mark} has **[[not
increased]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, [**[no]{.mark}ne** of
the [actor]{.mark}s]{.underline} in the examined region [[has]{.mark} an
[**interest** in **escalating**]{.mark} confrontational
behaviour]{.underline}. While the [[military]{.underline}]{.mark}
presence is growing in the Arctic, this [[growth]{.mark} has **[not
diverged]{.mark}** drastically [from]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**previous** trend]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even on the worsened
geopolitical playing field after February 2022,
[**[communication]{.mark}** channels]{.underline} have
[[not]{.underline}]{.mark} been [[interrupted]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
the rivalry [indicators clearly show **cooperative
behaviour**]{.underline} among the actors, [including]{.underline}
indications of [efforts to **continue**]{.underline} in this manner.

Since 2014, [defence spending]{.underline} has [risen]{.underline}.
There have been frequent rhetorical confrontations, and the undisputable
military build-up by Russia and the other Arctic states has increased.
Overall, international tensions have risen. [Nevertheless]{.underline},
the [actors in]{.underline} the [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[show]{.mark}n **[stability]{.mark}** and [**adherence**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the regime of [regional cooperation
**institutions** and **[treaties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the other
hand, one might argue that increased militarisation, which takes the
most time of all factors and requires the most investment to change, may
indicate that the other factors in STWM could also change easily and
quickly. This is confirmed by a rapid change in coalition-building after
February 2022. However, the [evidence]{.underline} so far
[leaves]{.underline} the **[non-escalating]{.underline}** rivalry
[factor as]{.underline} a [**highly relevant** counterbalance to
increased militarisation]{.underline} and negative trends in
coalition-building. In short, the [rivalry factor]{.underline} is
[[**strong enough** to **offset**]{.underline}]{.mark} and even detract
from the [[tensions]{.mark} caused by developments [in
**militarisation**]{.mark}]{.underline} and coalition-building.

Placing this research within a larger international context, the
[prioritisation of]{.underline} the [Arctic]{.underline} among the key
players [has decreased]{.underline} at the expense of developments in
Eastern Europe and the world energy crisis. The enduring world economic
crisis in the wake of the **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19 pandemic
[and]{.underline} the invasion of [[**Ukraine**
reduces]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[desire for]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[**escalation** of another **[conflict]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the
**[Arctic]{.underline}**. It is thus [expected that]{.underline} the
[[**Arctic** countries]{.underline}]{.mark} will [adhere to
**non-confrontational** behaviour]{.underline}. It is also questionable
whether these countries can sustain their planned Arctic-specific
military spending under the current economic situation and more pressing
issues elsewhere on the international scene. Hence, all these phenomena
further support the idea that the [rivalry factor]{.underline} will
[continue to [support **non-escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
region.

The evidence also reveals Russian activities as the catalyst of recent
military developments, and that confrontational behaviour in the
military dimension pits Russia against the other seven Arctic countries.
In this regard, further research as to if and under what conditions the
Arctic could be a future sphere of new Russian military activities would
be valuable. Russian interests in the Arctic, its military developments
after 2014, and the actual reasons for these activities are key topics
for further debate. Yet, [despite]{.underline} the clearly
[**increased** tensions]{.underline} between Russia and the West [since
**2014**, we]{.underline} have [see]{.underline}n [[**persistent**
rhetoric underlining **coop**]{.mark}**eration** and **joint** dispute
**settlement**]{.underline} in the High North [and agendas setting
**cooperative goals**]{.underline} for respective coalitions. Thus, the
coalition regime under which cooperation in the
**[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** takes place [appears
**[stable]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the time being.

#### No threat of Russian conflict -- they are interested in localized defense and checked by global frameworks

When doing a cursory search of articles and commentaries about the
current state of Arctic international relations, you would be forgiven
if you were to think the Russians are preparing to launch a massive
offensive against other Arctic states, particularly Canada. The
oft-repeated narrative surrounding the Arctic is that the Russians are
building up their northern military capabilities as part of their
neo-imperial ambitions and to turn the Arctic into a sphere of
geopolitical competition, tension, and conflict. There is reason for
this narrative to not only survive, but to grow in its sensationalism.
Russia's provocativeness, actions, and statements from Russian officials
do little to allay fears. For scholars of foreign and defense policy, as
well as casual observers, [a potential [conflict with]{.mark} the
[Russians in the Arctic]{.mark} would be of great interest.]{.underline}
For media outlets, [the idea of conflict in the Arctic continues to
[serve as click-bait]{.mark}, and so the sensationalism continues. The
problem, however, is that [very little of this narrative is grounded in
reality.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Arctic has certainly emerged as an
arena of vast interest in recent years, and rightfully so. Northern
climates continue to change and there are greater opportunities for
access, as well as the possibility of resource wealth. As such, more
attention has been paid to affairs in the circumpolar region. [Covering
approximately 4 percent of the Earth's surface at 20,000,000 square
kilometers with an estimated 4 million people, the [Arctic]{.mark} is
[far more complex]{.mark} [than a simple calculation about Russia's
investments in military technology. Arctic international relations are
based on interstate cooperation,]{.mark} indigenous engagement,
scientific and environmental collaboration, [and]{.mark} is seeing an
emerging [global governance architecture through bodies like the Arctic
Council]{.mark} designed to provide a forum for future cooperation,
resource sharing and [to ensure diplomacy, rather than
conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} This continues to be the predominant
norm. Despite the existing cooperative dynamics in the Arctic, there are
reasons for concern and important historical lessons to bear in mind.
The Arctic is not immune from geopolitics and other international
political events, and it is still very much impacted by the
international system's anarchic structure and great power politics.
Circumpolar relations involve multiple actors, including the eight
Arctic states, Arctic-interested states, international institutions,
indigenous groups, and NGOs. All are contributing to an increasingly
complex Arctic political landscape. This complexity is leading to
concerns over states' intentions in the region, and how other states and
institutions react. Russia has been generating the most attention for
its recent Arctic behavior, primarily due to the ongoing militarization
of its Arctic territory and fears about whether Russia's actions in
Crimea, eastern Ukraine, and Syria might somehow foreshadow aggression
in the north. Given the fact that Russia's Arctic policy has included an
expansion of permanent military forces, new military bases, new air
force divisions, new military technologies, and massive military
exercises, it is understandable that other Arctic states would be paying
close attention to Russia's Arctic moves. However, [the ["Arctic
conflict" narrative assumes that Russia wants to be an aggressor]{.mark}
in the region.]{.underline} This line of thinking existed before
Russia's annexation of Crimea and its incursions into eastern Ukraine,
but those events have sparked more debate about whether Russia's
international behavior is inherently aggressive and whether Russia might
use the Arctic as another theater in a new Cold War. [The
[Arctic]{.mark} is [not immune to the rules of the international system
and great power politics.]{.mark} It is thus [highly unlikely]{.mark}
that [Russia would risk conflict with the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and]{.mark} other [NATO]{.mark} states [in the Arctic]{.mark}. There
[is little to gain by doing so]{.mark} and conflict would disrupt the
emerging balance of power in the Arctic.]{.underline} If Russia was to
initiate [[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} in the circumpolar region, [it
[would unilaterally disrupt]{.mark} the [existing]{.mark} cooperative
[framework and]{.mark} would [yield no]{.mark} significant
[gains]{.mark} in either territory or influence]{.underline} based on
what Russia currently enjoys in the Arctic. Instead, [it makes far more
sense to interpret Russian actions as defensive in nature]{.underline},
given the Arctic's importance for Russia's energy infrastructure, its
nuclear deterrence strategy, its Northern Fleet, and the role a northern
identity plays in Russian national pride. The Putin regime has used the
Arctic as a means of demonstrating to Russians and to the rest of the
world that Russia will defend its Arctic interests by any means
necessary. The ongoing militarization of the region speaks more to
Russia's recognition of just how important the Arctic is for the Russian
economy, and that as greater access to the region becomes possible with
the shifting northern climate, [[Russia is seeking to increase its
presence as a means of defending]{.mark} its territory and both its
commercial and strategic interests.]{.underline} The ongoing buildup of
military resources in the Arctic by Russia and the subsequent response
by other Arctic states is cause for concern and does pose a threat to
the security and stability of Arctic relations. However, there is a vast
difference between identifying emerging threats and the narrative that
the Arctic is on the verge of war. The goal of Arctic states, and
Arctic-interested states and organizations, continues to be cooperation,
information sharing, and diplomacy. If a state is [[to threaten the
emerging Arctic geopolitical framework]{.underline}]{.mark} for purely
offensive purposes without any provocation or threat to its national
interests, it would depart from the current reality of the region and
[[would]{.mark} serve to [hurt Russia's interests rather than benefit
them]{.mark}. In this light, it is best to stick to the status quo than
trying to create conflict where there currently is none.]{.underline}

#### The icebreaker gap is overblown, they're useless and not important for deterring Russia or China.

However, [using relative [icebreaker]{.mark} fleet sizes [as]{.mark} a
key [metric]{.mark} for]{.underline} the state of [strategic competition
in the Arctic [is **flawed**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While they are an
important platform, [icebreakers [do **little** to]{.mark} create or
[address]{.mark} the most commonly identified defense
[challenges]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline} Instead, analysts should
focus on the nature of the military risks in the Arctic, the role of
allies and partners, and economic interests in a broader geopolitical
context rather than comparing specific capabilities. Doing so is
important to avoid mischaracterizing the scope of the danger or
emphasizing the wrong types of solutions.

The Icebreaker Fleets

If relative icebreaker counts are the right way to measure competition
in the Arctic, then the United States is in trouble. Russia possesses
more than 40 icebreakers and plans to build more, with a goal of 13
heavy-duty icebreakers in operation by 2035. China recently acquired its
second, and first domestically built, icebreaker and has aspirations for
a nuclear-powered variant. By contrast, the United States has one aged
heavy icebreaker and one medium version in operation. While there are
plans to build six more (including three heavy icebreakers at an
estimated total cost of \$2.6--2.95 billion), funding is largely limited
to the first one and it will not be available until 2023 or 2024. Unlike
past fears that the United States was on the wrong side of a bomber gap,
missile gap, or the dreaded mine-shaft gap, an icebreaker gap does
indeed exist.

Most analysts who warn about the gap distinguish the Coast Guard's role
--- which operates U.S. icebreakers and is part of the Department of
Homeland Security in peacetime ---from the Department of Defense mission
set. Yet placing the icebreaker discussion alongside threats from Russia
and China makes an implicit or explicit connection between icebreakers
and U.S. military vulnerability.

The Consequences of an Icebreaker Gap

Thankfully for Washington, [the [consequences]{.mark} of this icebreaker
gap for U.S. defense [are]{.mark} often misunderstood or
**[overstated.]{.mark}**]{.underline} First, many of the specific
[[military challenges t]{.mark}hat China or Russia might pose in the
Arctic [are **independent**]{.mark} of icebreakers and best dealt with
in other ways.]{.underline} These [include]{.underline} [denying the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [access]{.underline} to the
region, [missile strikes]{.underline} against the homeland, the [ability
to move forces]{.underline} from the homeland, and demonstrating U.S.
strength against challenges.

[It is [not clear how Russia or China would leverage icebreakers]{.mark}
to exclude the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [from the
region,]{.underline} or how the United States would utilize icebreakers
to overcome such attempts. Take the concern of [Russia [denying]{.mark}
access along the [N]{.mark}]{.underline}orthern
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea [[R]{.underline}]{.mark}oute (setting aside
the limited trans-Arctic shipping to date and modest future
projections). [The Russian ability to do this [stems]{.mark} primarily
[from]{.mark} their growing [missile, air, and surveillance]{.mark}
capabilities deployed within their own territory.]{.underline} As
Mathieu Boulègue observes, the [Russian Northern
[Fleet]{.mark}]{.underline} will likely be able to perform some sea
denial missions "at a limited operational tempo." Yet ["the majority of
its [assets are **not** Arctic-specific]{.mark}]{.underline}, operating
beyond the region and in other strategic directions." [Increasing the
numbers of U.S. [icebreakers would not overcome]{.mark} the Russian
shore-based [area-denial]{.mark} challenge]{.underline}. In the event of
a crisis, [naval surface [vessels]{.mark} operating [behind]{.mark}
slow-moving [icebreakers would be]{.mark}]{.underline}, Andreas Kuersten
notes, ["**[sitting ducks]{.mark}** for aerial, undersea, and
shore-based enemy forces."]{.underline}

[[Icebreakers]{.mark} would play a **[marginal]{.mark}** role in
countering other military challenges to the United States emerging from
the region.]{.underline} Missiles fired from the Russian Arctic toward
the United States would traverse over the Arctic. The status of what the
DoD terms the "aging North Warning System" is a greater concern from
this perspective than a lack of icebreakers. Similarly, while Russia's
icebreakers are important for its Northern Fleet's ability to operate in
and through the Arctic, the number of U.S. icebreakers has little
bearing on this. Addressing Russia's ability to project power into the
North Atlantic, the DoD Arctic strategy focuses on other capabilities.
These include cooperation with Great Britain and Norway on P-8 patrols,
NATO air policing missions from Iceland, and a recognition that
establishment of Joint Force Command Norfolk helps to protect the North
Atlantic sea lines of communication to Europe.

[The United States can use the enormous challenges Russia will face in
2025 as leverage]{.underline} to secure critical concessions in ongoing
negotiations to end the war by continuing and even expanding military
support to Ukraine. [Russia will likely face a number of materiel,
manpower, and economic issues in 12 to 18 months]{.underline} if
Ukrainian forces continue to inflict damage on Russian forces on the
battlefield at the current rate. [Russia\'s]{.underline} defense
industrial base ([DIB) cannot sustain Russia\'s current armored vehicle,
artillery system, and ammunition burn rates in the
medium-term]{.underline}. [Russia\'s recruitment efforts appear to be
slowing such that they cannot indefinitely replace Russia\'s current
casualty rates]{.underline} without an involuntary reserve mobilization,
which Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown great reluctance to
order. [Putin has mismanaged Russia\'s economy, which is suffering
from]{.underline} increased and unsustainable [war
spending]{.underline}, growing [inflation]{.underline}, significant
[labor shortages, and reductions in]{.underline} Russia\'s sovereign
[wealth]{.underline} fund. [These issues will present difficult decision
points to Putin]{.underline} in 2026 or 2027 provided current trends
continue. Putin thus is likely prioritizing breaking Western and
particularly US support to Ukraine in 2025 and securing his desired end
state in negotiations, letting him avoid facing the nexus of difficult
problems he now confronts. US military aid to Ukraine has let Ukraine
drive Russia towards a critical moment when Putin will have to make hard
choices. [The United States can accelerate the moment when Putin must
grapple with these interlocking problems]{.underline} and can likely
coerce Russia into making the concessions on its demands necessary to
secure a peace acceptable to the United States, Ukraine, and Europe. The
United States can achieve a strong negotiating position and negotiate a
deal that maximizes American interests by continuing military aid to
Ukraine and increasing battlefield pressure on Russia.

Russia has the longest Arctic coastline of any country in the world and
has viewed the Arctic both as an east-west transit route via the
Northern Sea Route and as a source of natural resources. Moscow also
sees the region as its own territory from which others should be
excluded. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has long had the largest
[icebreaker [fleet]{.mark}]{.underline} in the world. The size of its
fleet, while enormous relative to all others, even taken together,
[[is]{.mark} frequently [**overstated**. Most]{.mark} of its 41
icebreakers [are **small**]{.mark} and devoted to
[keep]{.mark}]{.underline}ing [[ports]{.mark} and adjoining
[rivers]{.mark} navigable [rather than]{.mark}]{.underline} being able
to [[project]{.mark} Russian [power]{.mark}]{.underline} further into
the Arctic. [[Only seven]{.mark} of its ships are
[nuclear]{.mark}-powered]{.underline}, and many [[are **aging**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} now [forced to undergo significant
repairs]{.underline} that [keep them **[off-duty]{.mark}** for months or
even years at a time]{.underline} (Sudostroenie.info, July 22). Until
recently, [Moscow]{.underline} had sought to compensate for its
longstanding domestic difficulties by [rely]{.underline}ing [on
shipyards in other countries]{.underline}. However, in addition to
[[depriving]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia of the much-needed
[[parts]{.underline}]{.mark} it requires [[to]{.mark} repair or
[modernize]{.mark}]{.underline} existing ships, [Western
[sanctions]{.mark} have largely made that impossible]{.underline} (The
Barents Observer, January 19, 2022, June 24). Having lost those options,
Moscow has increasingly turned to China in hopes that the growing number
of Chinese icebreakers will work with, rather than against, Russian
interests. Some in Russia, however, fear that China will help now only
to turn against Russia in the future, when Beijing, rather than Moscow,
could become the paramount power in the north (see EDM, May 6, 2021; The
Barents Observer, July 10).

#### China has no means or motive to contest the artic: no control of water, logistical uncertainty, different priorities, and Russian resistance

**[Western analysts]{.underline}** [risk **overestimating**
**China's**]{.underline} emergence as an [Arctic **power**]{.underline},
spurred by fears that they initially neglected the reappearance of the
Arctic as a theatre for strategic competition. Contrary to such alarmist
views, [Beijing is]{.underline} in fact [far more constrained in the
region]{.underline}, mainly [because of Russia's ability to resist
encroachment]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [China's]{.underline}
ability to accept [limited resource and transit
opportunities]{.underline} [there]{.underline}. In assessing China's
influence over Russia in the Arctic, there is a tendency to portray
Russia as little more than a springboard for Chinese interests. In this
flawed perception, President Vladimir Putin has invited Beijing into his
Arctic larder as a way of buying goodwill for his invasion of Ukraine.
But this underestimates Moscow, which assumes its alliance with China
will hold without such bargaining. **[Russia]{.underline}** also
[**jealously** guards its backyard]{.underline} [and signals
that]{.underline} regional [advances]{.underline} made [by China would
injure their alignment elsewhere]{.underline} in locations with far
greater strategic importance [for Beijing.]{.underline} To this end,
[Putin has stalled projects that fail to further his]{.underline}
strategic [agenda]{.underline} or give him a controlling stake. [Russian
law stipulates that]{.underline}, while private [Russian energy
firms]{.underline} can develop in the Arctic zone, they [may not cede
controlling stakes to foreign firms.]{.underline} Furthermore, [Russia
has not given China privileged use of the North Sea]{.underline} [Route
or its six major ports]{.underline}---Pevek, Tiksi, Dikson, Sabetta,
Arkhangelsk and Murmansk. [Chinese **ships** have]{.underline} either
[been **refused** **entry**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} have abided by
[Russian transit laws]{.underline} that [**force** **them to pay
tolls**]{.underline}, provide ample notice about journeys and accept
Russian pilots. This freezes China's position below Russia's in the
polar power struggle. And that will be hard to change, given that
Russia's 24,000-kilometre coastline in the Arctic accounts for 53
percent of the total for all countries. Russia also has a lot of skin in
the game, with its Arctic territories contributing about 20 percent of
its gross domestic product, 10 percent of its total investment and 20
percent of its exports. The Arctic accounts for 80 percent of Russia's
natural gas production and 20 percent of its crude oil production. The
[tension between China and Russia in the Arctic lies behind Beijing's
tepid reaction to projects that fulfill Russia's]{.underline} strategic
[goals]{.underline}, such as the co-development of the Power of Siberia
2 natural gas pipeline. [Moscow]{.underline}, in turn, [attempts to
balance]{.underline} its relationship with [China]{.underline} [by
diversifying its Arctic partners]{.underline}, [encouraging India and
the Gulf countries]{.underline} to participate and calling for a science
station on Norway's Svalbard archipelago in cooperation with India and
China. Many [**western analyst**s]{.underline} have
**[failed]{.underline}** **[to]{.underline}** accurately
**[calibrate]{.underline}** the scale of [the **Arctic's** **economic**
**opportunities**]{.underline}, another reason for their overestimation
of China's growing power in the region. [They depict the Arctic as
providing a shorter shipping route than Suez]{.underline} and a treasure
chest of resources, including oil, natural gas, fisheries and critical
minerals. In reality, [developing]{.underline} [a]{.underline} reliable
route to [rival the Suez Canal remains implausible]{.underline} due to
[safety concerns, environmental uncertainties, lack of infrastructure
and shortness of the navigation season]{.underline}. Currently, [less
than 10 percent of global shipping movement is in the Arctic and that
looks unlikely to increase]{.underline} in the near term. [The idea that
there will be a scramble for the Arctic]{.underline}'s natural
[resources in which China plays a major part is]{.underline} also
[overblown]{.underline}. Ostensibly, the opportunities in the region
look promising: according to a US Geological Survey, the Arctic holds an
estimated 13 percent of the world's undiscovered conventional oil
resources and 30 percent of its undiscovered conventional natural gas
resources. But most is in exclusive economic zones. In fact, under the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, six littoral states
control roughly 85 percent of the water space, which includes the
resources in the seabed. Moreover, [Beijing cannot challenge the
sovereign rights of Arctic states over maritime jurisdictions without
contradicting its]{.underline} own [efforts to nationalise the East and
South China Seas,]{.underline} [where]{.underline} its
[stakes]{.underline} [are]{.underline} much [higher]{.underline}.
Finally, [a thaw in the Arctic will pose]{.underline} new [challenges
for China]{.underline} and other nations. The instability of [softening
terrain will make it difficult to build the infrastructure]{.underline}
necessary [for extracting resources]{.underline}. The changing landscape
may also [undermine the role of existing military structures such as
roads, runways, naval bases and communications systems]{.underline}. It
may even destabilise military strategies, as thinning ice
[and]{.underline} increased satellite coverage [make submarines more
exposed]{.underline}. In sum, China's potential in the Arctic is limited
by Russia's concerns of rivalry in the sole region where it remains a
first-rank power, especially as the power gap between the two countries
widens in other fields. [Beijing has decided to respect Russia's
sensitivities]{.underline} and prioritise the pursuit of a shared
revisionist world order, [resulting in an adjustment of its ambitions in
the Arctic]{.underline}. Western analysts should take heed or risk
wasting [**resources** in the Far North]{.underline} that [might be
**better deployed elsewhere.**]{.underline}

#### China is against Russian artic ambitions - favors global cooperation not great power status

**Dagaey 25** Andrei Dagaev is a PhD student at the National Chengchi
University (Taipei). "The Arctic Is Testing the Limits of the
Sino-Russian Partnership: A fundamental disagreement on multilateral
cooperation versus autarky in the Arctic continues to hamper
Sino-Russian cooperation." February 18, 2025
https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2025/02/russia-china-arctic-views?lang=en

Over the past three years, Russia's cooperation with China has reached
unprecedented levels. Still, there is one area where the two countries
have been unable to find common ground: the Arctic. Even in the current
geopolitical climate, [the differences between Moscow and Beijing's
approaches to the Arctic]{.underline} [have]{.underline} so far
**[proven too great to overcome]{.underline}**, [limiting China's
advances in the]{.underline} Far [North.]{.underline} Publicly, Russia
and China maintain they have a "comprehensive strategic partnership,"
which ostensibly extends to Arctic issues. Yet their interests in the
region can be quite disparate. China first took a serious interest in
the Far North in the early 2010s, initially seeking a seat on the Arctic
Council, the region's most important multilateral organization. Russia
did not immediately agree to admit China, setting two conditions: that
China respect the sovereignty of regional powers and abide by
freedom-of-navigation rules. In 2013, China was finally granted observer
status, and with it, a platform to articulate its regional objectives.
In 2018, China's State Council published the country's first-ever white
paper on Arctic policy. The document described China as a "near-Arctic
state" with a vested interest in the region's affairs. It argued that
the Arctic belonged to all mankind, and so China had the right to enter
its waters and airspace, just like other "constructive" parties. The
Arctic was easily integrated into China's global Belt and Road
Initiative---in the form of a proposed "Polar Silk Road"---and its
vision of a "Community of Common Destiny." Overall, it presented Beijing
with an opportunity to burnish its image as a responsible great power.
[China's stated objectives]{.underline} [in the Arctic]{.underline} have
not changed significantly since 2018. It [remains]{.underline} committed
to conducting [scientific research]{.underline}, [conserving the
region,]{.underline} carrying out [commercial activities,
and]{.underline} assisting with the Arctic's [joint management in line
with international law]{.underline}. Indeed, all of
[**China's**]{.underline} statements and [**documents** on the
region]{.underline} [reiterate]{.underline} its **[willingness to engage
in multilateral cooperation]{.underline}** [for the benefit of the
Arctic]{.underline}. Meanwhile, **[the military-political dimension
always goes unmentioned,]{.underline}** with [neither]{.underline} the
2018 white [paper]{.underline} nor any subsequent pronouncements
[hinting at the expansionist designs about which then U.S.]{.underline}
secretary of state Mike [Pompeo]{.underline} [warned]{.underline} in
2019. Russia's Arctic policy is based on altogether different
principles. For Moscow, it is all about unlocking the region's economic
potential and defending sovereignty. Essentially, [Russia wishes to
commercialize the region]{.underline}---with an emphasis on oil and gas
exploration and the creation of a transportation corridor---[and
militarize it]{.underline}, too. Furthermore, **[Russia would do this
unilaterally]{.underline}**, [all references to]{.underline} dialogue
and [cooperation]{.underline} with regional partners having [been
removed from the country's]{.underline} main [documents on the
Arctic]{.underline} amid the breakdown in its relations with the West.
Unlike Beijing, [Moscow has put great stock in national projects with
limited foreign participation]{.underline}. Tellingly[, the Northern Sea
Route]{.underline} [is treated by the Kremlin as a domestic transport
route]{.underline}. While [China welcomes]{.underline} the
[internationalization]{.underline} of the Arctic's transportation
corridors, [Russia has resisted]{.underline} this trend [in favor of
autarky. This fundamental disagreement has]{.underline} long [hampered
Russia's cooperation with China on Arctic issues]{.underline} in every
area except oil and gas. In the 2010s, the two countries actively
collaborated on oil and gas projects in the Arctic, many of which the
Chinese financed, much to Russia's gratitude, particularly after the
West imposed the first sanctions against it in 2014. However, this
partnership could not be extended to other areas of cooperation. Take
infrastructure: [in 2016, the]{.underline} [state-owned China Poly Group
signed a memorandum]{.underline} of understanding [with]{.underline}
[the Arkhangelsk region administration]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the
[construction of a deep-sea port]{.underline} in Arkhangelsk. China was
expected to invest \$78 million in the project and connect the port with
the proposed Belkomur railway line. But [the project never
transpired.]{.underline} Working together on infrastructure is difficult
when [Russia sees every]{.underline} new [project through a national
lens while China views it as a building block in a Polar Silk
Road]{.underline}, an initiative [Russia cannot help but be wary
of]{.underline} in its [multilateralism. Russia's]{.underline} break
with the West and [increased economic dependence on China has not
smoothed over these tensions]{.underline}, [even after repeated
commitments]{.underline} by Vladimir [Putin and Xi]{.underline} [Jinping
to strengthen cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline}, and the
establishment of a bilateral Subcommission on Cooperation on the
Northern Sea Route. Since 2022, [Beijing]{.underline} has taken the same
stance [on the Arctic]{.underline} as it has on the war in Ukraine as a
whole: [neither condemning nor supporting Moscow]{.underline}. Following
the invasion, the seven other members of the Arctic Council refused to
attend any meetings chaired by Russia, leading China to declare that it
saw no point in excluding Russia and suspend its own participation in
the organization. China took the same approach to economic cooperation,
continuing to work with Russia on energy and infrastructure
projects---until that ceased to be viable. The story of Arctic LNG 2 is
indicative. In April 2019, two Chinese oil majors agreed to acquire a
combined 20 percent stake in the project, instantly making Beijing
Arctic LNG 2's largest investor. But in December 2023, CNPC and CNOOC
pulled out of the project in response to the tightening of U.S.
sanctions. Between 2022 and 2023, Novatek, the Russian LNG producer
behind Arctic LNG 2, ordered gas turbine equipment and other technology
from China for the project. Beijing resisted U.S. pressure and continued
to fulfill these orders until January 2025, when sanctions imposed in
the final days of Joe Biden's presidency brought everything to a halt.
**[Russia and China play up their]{.underline}** scientific and cultural
[**cooperation on Arctic issues**, but their practical **use** has been
**doubtful**]{.underline}. While academic contacts are often cited as a
success story for Russia and China, they grew less frequent after
February 2022. Chinese students still attend academic conferences in
Russia, and joint expeditions to the Arctic continue, but these
initiatives do little to meaningfully deepen Sino-Russian cooperation on
regional issues. The fact is that expectations that China might expand
its presence in the Arctic through partnership with Russia have not been
fulfilled. [For Beijing, the priority remains having the freedom to work
with all the Arctic's interested parties]{.underline}. As such, while
China continued to fulfill Russia's technology orders for energy
projects in the Arctic and import energy from the region, it has
refrained from investing further in Russia's Arctic initiatives out of
fear of sanctions. **[China genuinely values its relationships with the
Arctic's other powers]{.underline}**, and [does not want to risk
alienating them]{.underline} [by getting overly close to
Russia.]{.underline} Since becoming an Arctic Council observer, Beijing
has looked for opportunities to work not only with Moscow but also with
others in the region, including Iceland and Norway. Admittedly, its
proposals are given less and less consideration nowadays, with national
security concerns usually cited as the reason. Despite these setbacks,
China remains set on the internationalization of Arctic projects and
committed to multilateralism in the region. With war raging, Russia is
less likely than ever to help China in this endeavor. Claiming
neutrality while simultaneously developing relations with Russia, China
has taken a wait-and-see position toward its strategic partner, with
respect to the Arctic as well as in general. And as Beijing waits for
the resolution of Russia's conflict with the West, it continues to take
what it can from Moscow, starting with its know-how---by now a familiar
dynamic in their relationship.

#### Alt causes to loss of sea power -- collapse of industry and decreased spending decks naval dominance

But the very success of this project now threatens its future.
Seablindness has become endemic. [THE [U]{.mark}]{.underline}NITED
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}TATES [is [**no longer** **investing
in**]{.mark} the instruments of **[sea power]{.mark}** as it once did.
America's commercial shipbuilding industry began losing its share of the
global market in the 1960s]{.underline} to countries with lower labor
costs, and to those that had rebuilt their industrial capacity after the
war. The drop in American shipbuilding accelerated after President
Ronald Reagan took office, in 1981. The administration, in a nod to
free-market principles, began to shrink government subsidies that had
supported the industry. That was a choice; it might have gone the other
way. Aircraft manufacturers in the United States, citing
national-security concerns, successfully lobbied for continued, and even
increased, subsidies for their industry in the decades that
followed---and got them. It is never to a nation's advantage to depend
on others for crucial links in its supply chain. But that is where we
are. [[In]{.mark} 19[77]{.mark}, American shipbuilders produced more
than [1 million]{.mark} gross [tons of merchant ships. By]{.mark}
20[05,]{.mark} that number had fallen to [300,000]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Today, most commercial ships built in the United States are constructed
for government customers such as the Maritime Administration or for
private entities that are required to ship their goods between U.S.
ports in U.S.-flagged vessels, under the provisions of the 1920 Jones
Act. [The U.S. Navy, too, has been shrinking.]{.underline} After the
Second World War[, the [Navy scrapped many]{.mark} of its [ships]{.mark}
and sent many more into a ready-reserve "mothball" fleet.]{.underline}
For the next two decades, the active naval fleet hovered at about 1,000
ships. But beginning in 1969, the total began to fall. By 1971, the
fleet had been reduced to 750 ships. Ten years later, it was down to
521. Reagan, who had campaigned in 1980 on a promise to rebuild the Navy
to 600 ships, nearly did so under the able leadership of his secretary
of the Navy, John Lehman. During Reagan's eight years in office, the
size of the Navy's fleet climbed to just over 590 ships. Then the Cold
War ended. The administrations of Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill
Clinton slashed troops, ships, aircraft, and shore-based infrastructure.
During the Obama administration, the Navy's battle force bottomed out at
271 ships. Meanwhile, both [China and Russia]{.underline}, in different
ways[, began to develop systems that would challenge the U.S.-led regime
of global free trade on the high seas.]{.underline} Russia began to
invest in highly sophisticated nuclear-powered submarines with the
intention of being able to disrupt the oceanic link between NATO nations
in Europe and North America. China, which for a time enjoyed
double-digit GDP growth, expanded both its commercial and naval
shipbuilding capacities. It tripled the size of the People's Liberation
Army-Navy and invested in long-range sensors and missiles that could
allow it to interdict commercial and military ships more than 1,000
miles from its shores[.]{.underline} Both Russia and China also sought
to extend territorial claims into international waters, the aim being to
control the free passage of shipping near their shores and in their
perceived spheres of influence. [In short: Autocratic powers are trying
to close the global commons. Today the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
is [financially constrained by **debt**, and]{.mark} psychologically
burdened by **[recent military conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}---for
the most part, land-based actions in Iraq and Afghanistan fought
primarily by a large standing army operating far from home---[[that
turned into **costly quagmires**]{.mark}. We can [no longer afford to
be]{.mark} both a continentalist power and [an oceanic
power]{.mark}.]{.underline} But we can still exert influence, and at the
same time avoid getting caught up in the affairs of other nations. Our
strategic future lies at sea. AMERICANS USED TO know this. The United
States began its life purposefully as a seapower: The Constitution
explicitly directed Congress "to provide and maintain a Navy." In
contrast, the same article of the Constitution instructed the
legislature "to raise and support Armies," but stipulated that no
appropriation for the army "shall be for a longer Term than two Years."
The Founders had an aversion to large standing armies. George Washington
pushed through the Naval Act of 1794, funding the Navy's original six
frigates. (One of these was the famous USS Constitution, "Old
Ironsides," which remains in active commission to this day.) In his
final address to the American people, Washington advocated for a
navalist foreign policy, warning against "attachments and entanglements"
with foreign powers that might draw the young nation into continental
European wars. The strategy he advised instead was to protect American
trade on the high seas, and advance America's interests through
temporary agreements, not permanent alliances. This seapower approach to
the world became the sine qua non of early American foreign policy. In
time, conditions changed. [The [U.S]{.mark}. was preoccupied by
sectional conflict and by conquest of the continent. **It [turned
inward]{.mark}**, becoming a continental power.]{.underline} But by the
end of the 19th century, that era had come to a close. In 1890, a U.S.
Navy captain named Alfred Thayer Mahan published an article in The
Atlantic titled "The United States Looking Outward." Mahan argued that,
with the closing of the frontier, the United States had in essence
become an island nation looking eastward and westward across oceans. The
nation's energies should therefore be focused externally: on the seas,
on maritime trade, and on a larger role in the world. In the end, the
Second World War was won not by bullets or torpedoes but by the American
maritime industrial base. Mahan sought to end the long-standing policy
of protectionism for American industries, because they had become strong
enough to compete in the global market. By extension, Mahan also sought
a larger merchant fleet to carry goods from American factories to
foreign lands, and for a larger Navy to protect that merchant fleet. In
a few thousand words, Mahan made a coherent strategic argument that the
United States should once again become a true seapower. Mahan's vision
was profoundly influential. Politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt and
Henry Cabot Lodge advocated for larger merchant and naval fleets (and
for a canal through Central America). Mahan, Roosevelt, and Lodge
believed that sea power was the catalyst for national power, and they
wanted the United States to become the preeminent nation of the 20th
century. The swift expansion of the Navy, particularly in battleships
and cruisers, paralleled the growing fleets of other global powers.
Leaders in Britain, Germany, France, and Italy had also read Mahan, and
they wanted to protect commercial access to their overseas empires. The
resulting arms race at sea helped destabilize the balance of power in
the years leading up to the First World War. This is not the place to
relate every development in the evolution of America's naval capability,
much less that of other nations. Suffice to say that, by the 1930s, new
technologies were transforming the seas. Aircraft, aircraft carriers,
amphibious assault craft, and submarines had all been developed into
more effective weapons. During the Second World War, the oceans once
again became battlefields. The fighting proceeded in a way Mahan himself
had never envisioned, as fleets faced off against ships they could not
even see, launching waves of aircraft against each other. In the end,
the war was won not by bullets or torpedoes but by the American maritime
industrial base. The United States began the war with 790 ships in its
battle force; when the war ended, it had more than 6,700. No nation
could come close to challenging the American fleet, commercial or naval,
on the high seas after the war. So great was its advantage that, for
decades, no one even tried to match it. In concert with allies, the
United States created an international system based on free and
unhindered trade. It was the culmination of the Mahanist Age. For the
first time in history, open access to the seas was assumed---and so
people naturally gave little thought to its importance and challenges.
ANEW SEAPOWER strategy involves more than adding ships to the Navy. A
new strategy must start with the economy. [[For 40 years, we]{.mark}
have [watched **domestic industries and blue-collar jobs leave the
country**]{.mark}. Now we find ourselves locked in a new great-power
competition, primarily with a rising China but also with a diminishing
and unstable Russia. [We]{.mark} will [need **heavy industry**]{.mark}
in order to prevail. The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [cannot]{.mark}
simply [rely on]{.mark} the [manufacturing base of other
countries]{.mark}, even friendly ones, for its national-security
needs.]{.underline} In 1993, Deputy Secretary of Defense William Perry
invited the executives of leading defense contractors to a dinner in
Washington---a meal that would enter national-security lore as the "Last
Supper." [Perry spelled out projected [cuts in defense spending]{.mark}.
His message was clear: If the American defense industrial base was going
to survive, then **[mergers]{.mark} would be
[required.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Soon after, the Northrop Corporation
acquired the Grumman Corporation to form Northrop Grumman. The Lockheed
Corporation and Martin Marietta became Lockheed Martin. A few years
later, Boeing combined with McDonnell Douglas, itself the product of a
previous merger. Among the shipbuilders, General Dynamics, which
manufactures submarines through its Electric Boat subsidiary, bought
Bath Iron Works, a naval shipyard, and the National Steel and
Shipbuilding Company. [These mergers preserved the defense industries,
but at a price: a [**dramatic reduction in our overall industrial
capacity.** During W]{.mark}orld [W]{.mark}ar [II]{.mark}, the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates could [claim]{.mark} more than [50
graving docks]{.mark}]{.underline}---heavy-industrial locations where
ships are assembled---that were [[greater than 150 meters in
length]{.mark},]{.underline} each one able to build merchant craft and
naval warships. [[Today]{.mark}, the [U.S. has 23]{.mark} graving docks,
[only a dozen]{.mark} of which [are certified to work on Navy
ships]{.mark}. The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates will [need]{.mark} to
implement a seapower [industrial policy]{.mark} that meets its
national-security needs:]{.underline} building steel plants and
microchip foundries, developing hypersonic glide bodies and autonomous
unmanned undersea vehicles. We will need to foster new start-ups using
targeted tax laws, the Defense Production Act, and perhaps even a "Ships
Act" akin to the recent CHIPS Act, which seeks to bring back the crucial
semiconductor industry. We also need to tell the companies we once
encouraged to merge that it's time for them to spin off key industrial
subsidiaries in order to encourage competition and resilience---and we
need to reward them for following through. In 2011, for example, the
aerospace giant Northrop Grumman spun off its shipbuilding holdings to
form Huntington Ingalls, in Newport News, Virginia, and Pascagoula,
Mississippi. Adding more such spin-offs would not only increase the
nation's industrial depth but also encourage the growth of parts
suppliers for heavy industries, companies that have endured three
decades of consolidation or extinction. Shipbuilding, in particular, is
a jobs multiplier. For every job created in a shipyard, five jobs, on
average, are created at downstream suppliers---well-paid blue-collar
jobs in the mining, manufacturing, and energy sectors. Most of the
civilian merchant ships, container ships, ore carriers, and supertankers
that dock in American ports are built overseas and fly foreign flags.
[We have ignored the [linkage between]{.mark} the [ability to build
commercial ships and]{.mark} the [ability to build Navy
ships]{.mark}---one reason the latter cost twice as much as they did in
1989.]{.underline} The lack of civilian ships under our own flag makes
us vulnerable. Today we remember the recent backlog of container ships
in the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, but tomorrow we could face
the shock of no container ships arriving at all should China prohibit
its large fleet from visiting U.S. ports. Today we're proud to ship
liquefied natural gas to our allies in Europe, but tomorrow we might not
be able to export that energy to our friends, because we don't own the
ships that would carry it. We need to bring back civilian shipbuilding
as a matter of national security. To revive our merchant-shipbuilding
base, we will need to offer government subsidies on a par with those
provided to European and Asian shipbuilders. Subsidies have flowed to
commercial aviation since the establishment of commercial airlines in
the 1920s; Elon Musk's SpaceX would not be enjoying its present success
were it not for strong initial support from the U.S. government.
Shipbuilding is no less vital. [**[Reindustrialization]{.mark}**, in
particular the restoration of merchant-shipbuilding capacity and
export-oriented industries**, [will support]{.mark}** the emergence of a
new, **[more]{.mark} technologically [advanced
Navy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The cost of building Navy ships could be
coaxed downward by increasing competition, expanding the number of
downstream suppliers, and recruiting new shipyard workers to the
industry. Wherever American trade goes, the flag traditionally
follows---usually in the form of the Navy. But the new Navy must not
look like the old Navy. If it does, we will have made a strategic
mistake. As rival powers develop ships and missiles that target our
aircraft carriers and other large surface vessels, we should make
greater investments in advanced submarines equipped with the latest in
long-range maneuvering hypersonic missiles[.]{.underline} We should
pursue a future in which our submarines cannot be found and our
hypersonic missiles cannot be defeated.

### 2NC \-\-- No Arctic War 

#### Arctic not key to US heg - China and Russia not confrontational, and war in arctic is too costly

**Little 24** (Alex, MS graduate at georgia tech and sepcializes in
russian and central asian affairs, "NATO's Arctic Strategy Is an
Overreaction,"
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/natos-arctic-strategy-is-an-overreaction/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[Neither the modernization of Soviet-era military bases nor PRC attempts
to construct a Polar Silk Road constitutes enough of a threat to warrant
making the Arctic the next battleground of great power
competition.]{.underline} Yet the NATO alliance, with Finland and Sweden
recently becoming full-fledged members, is determined to confront the
perceived threat in the Arctic region. Although NATO has historically
lacked an official position on the Arctic, following the start of the
Russo--Ukrainian war in 2022, the Arctic region has become a larger
security focus for the alliance. With Finland and Sweden's ascension to
NATO, the alliance's Arctic presence increased significantly and has
been accompanied by large-scale military exercises, such as Nordic
Response 2024, which involved 13 NATO countries and 20,000 troops.
Moreover, NATO's new Arctic posture includes enhancing surveillance and
reconnaissance capabilities, as well as improving interoperability among
NATO member states. [Despite its increased operations in the region over
the past few years, Russia's ability to mount an Arctic offensive is
negligible]{.underline} as [it remains entrenched in]{.underline} the
quagmire that is the [Russo-Ukrainian War]{.underline}. Moscow's
invasion of Ukraine has been mired with various failures and
shortcomings, including poor planning and running out of necessary
supplies. [Shortages have become enough of an issue for
Moscow]{.underline} to resort to increased cooperation with pariah
states, such as North Korea, to attain necessary equipment. Regarding
China, [Beijing's interest in the Arctic beyond economic endeavors is
minimal. China's main preoccupation has consistently been the Taiwan
Strait]{.underline}, as Beijing has used various coercive tactics short
of armed conflict aimed at wearing down Taiwan to capitulate to its aim
of unification with the island. Military activity in the Arctic would
rank extremely lowly in importance regarding Beijing's military
initiatives. Washington and the NATO alliance should acknowledge that
[engaging in a military confrontation in the Arctic would be extremely
costly and difficult.]{.underline} Even with the addition of Finland and
Sweden to the NATO alliance, Russia will remain the most influential
player in the Arctic. Rather than adding fuel to the fire of Western
relations with Russia, [the West should emphasize keeping channels of
communication open with Russia to avoid and manage crises, as well as
mitigate the risks of conflict through an accident or
miscalculation]{.underline}. The war in Ukraine has undoubtedly made
cooperation and diplomacy in the Arctic more difficult. Nevertheless,
the [U.S. can expect Russia to remain open to peaceful
discussions.]{.underline} [Even during the height of the Cold War,
Russia]{.underline}---then the Soviet Union---[cooperated with the West
on Arctic issues]{.underline}, including initiatives like the 1973
Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears and the 1987 "Murmansk
Initiative" toward regional cooperation. Despite current high tensions,
given the potential for mutual devastation, [Russia and NATO share an
interest in maintaining peace in the Arctic region.]{.underline}

[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[submit]{.mark} these [**claims**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} relevant
**[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as the UN CLCS. The

[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Chrášťanský & Kříž 2011; Rainwater

**coop**]{.mark}eration are [needed for]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[econ]{.mark}**omic **[development]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
Arctic. In addition, [most of the **natural
[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline} (including offshore energy) [are
[located in **uncontested** areas]{.mark}]{.underline} (Byers 2013;

[**conflict**, we]{.underline} thus [[observe]{.mark} a [**long-term

[**institutional** and **legal framework**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
may at times be coloured by competition among some Arctic states
(Chrášťanský & Kříž 2011; Olesen 2017).

In conclusion, [the evidence shows that the **Arctic-8** continue to
behave]{.underline} mostly [in a **coop**erative **manner**, without
increasing rivalry]{.underline}. While this trend did not change after
the illegal annexation of Crimea, since Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
certain tensions with regard to the Arctic can be observed. Overall,
however, [**[disputes]{.mark}** in the region have, thus far, been
**[dealt]{.mark}** with [in]{.mark} a [**peaceful**, **diplomatic** and

Based on this, we can expect that [the **coop**erative **approach** to
territorial disputes will **endure**]{.underline} at least for the

But Østhagen believes [there are three [**major misconceptions**
about]{.mark} geopolitics in the **Arctic**]{.underline}:

The first is the [**[possibility of war]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The second is that there are [[**unresolved**
borders]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Arctic [and that a **[resource
race]{.mark}** is underway]{.underline}. The third is that
[**[climate]{.mark}** change is the primary
**[catalyst]{.mark}**]{.underline} for all changes in the Arctic region.

"[The [**reality** is much calmer]{.mark}]{.underline}," Østhagen says.

"The Electron case illustrates well everything that can go wrong. But it
also shows [why [things]{.mark} usually [**dont** go wrong]{.mark}.
There\'s a **[willingness to cooperate]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Svein
Vigeland Rottem says.

He is a senior researcher at FNI and studies cooperation in the Arctic.

Rottem and Østhagen [[do not agree]{.mark} that the [Arctic is a
**powder keg**]{.mark}]{.underline} and a dangerous place, as recently
stated by Lars Saunes, former head of the Norwegian Navy, to Norwegian
Broadcasting Corporation NRK.

Myth 1: The possibility of war in the Arctic

Østhagen, addressing the misconception of imminent war in the Arctic,
explains that the [[conditions]{.mark} in the Arctic are often **[more
stable]{.mark}** and transparent [than many
**assume**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Conflict]{.mark} is [**not easily** triggered]{.mark}, considering the
[**vast** areas and]{.mark} **diverse** [countries]{.mark}
involved]{.underline}. Østhagen emphasises the enormity of the Arctic,
which encompasses eight countries, four million people, and extensive
ocean areas. The countries include Russia, the Nordic states, the USA,
and Canada.

He notes that the significant Russian presence -- with almost half of
the Arctic landmass under Russian control -- influences perceptions of
geopolitics in the North.

Iver B. Neumann, a Russia researcher and director at the FNI, concurs
that [the [Arctic]{.mark} is [**less likely** to witness]{.mark} armed
[**conflict** than other]{.mark} global locations]{.underline}.

He believes the primary driver for military conflict in the Arctic is
Russia\'s use of Murmansk as a base for nuclear weapons.

"There are three main ways to keep such weapons mobile: in aircraft, on
land by rail, and at sea on submarines. Where such submarines exist, as
in Murmansk, there is also significant military attention. And where
there is military attention, there is also the potential for conflict,"
he says.

Neumann advises caution in responding to Russia\'s desire for global
attention and military control, stressing the importance of Norway
maintaining a cool head, enforcing sovereignty, and not succumbing to
intimidation.

Myth 2: Unresolved borders and a race for resources

As the Arctic becomes more accessible due to melting sea ice because of
climate change, [a **common myth** suggests a scramble for resources and
land]{.underline} in the North will occur.

But Østhagen clarifies that, unlike in other parts of the world, [[there
are]{.mark} almost [**no disputes** over]{.mark} Arctic
[borders]{.mark}]{.underline}.

["All the borders are **settled**]{.underline}," he says, noting that
[the **last** conflict]{.underline} between Canada and Greenland [was
resolved in 20**22**]{.underline}.

Maritime boundaries are key for resource management and potential
conflict. Law of the sea grants coastal states sovereign rights for
resource exploitation in their economic zones.

In the Arctic, only one maritime boundary remains unresolve. It is
between the USA and Canada -- two close allies.

Østhagen, who wrote his PhD on maritime disputes, [[foresees
**no**]{.mark} **major** [concerns regarding **sovereignty**]{.mark} or
territorial issues]{.underline}. He believes the [myth persists due to
**historical** reasons but]{.underline} emphasises that, [with all the
land borders **settled** and just **one** disputed sea border, Arctic
[resources]{.mark} are **[already distributed]{.mark}**]{.underline}
among the eight Arctic states.

Myth 3: Climate change drives all shifts in the Arctic

A third [[myth suggests]{.mark} that **[climate]{.mark}** change is the
**[main driver]{.mark}**]{.underline} for all political shifts in the
Arctic.

But Østhagen [[cautions against **oversimplifying**]{.mark} the
issue]{.underline}, noting that while climate change does affect fish
migration -- leading to potential future conflicts around resource-rich
areas like Svalbard -- it\'s important to be specific about which
aspects of climate change increase conflict risks.

But wait a minute. [[Even if climate change melts new trade routes
through]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} ice,]{.underline} as scientists
predict, [[will it become]{.mark} as [important and contested]{.mark} as
the South China Sea]{.underline}, where China has built and fortified
artificial islands to enforce centuries-old claims? [[Probably not,
agreed every expert]{.underline}]{.mark} we consulted for this article.
[The [Arctic will remain inhospitable, hard to exploit, and far
removed]{.mark} from the world's great hubs of economic
activity]{.underline} -- which are increasingly shifting to Asia, where
the South China Sea happens to be. [[What conflicts arise]{.mark} up
north can probably be [settled by peaceful means]{.mark}]{.underline},
because the poles are literally the [[only place]{.mark}s [on Earth with
no history of warfare over territorial claims]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
fact, while the Russians and Chinese are increasingly asserting
themselves, so far they've been strikingly well-behaved. "Today, there
are some competing claims, but...it's an orderly process and no one is
building islands, drilling in someone else's potential EEZ (Exclusive
Economic Zone), or harassing each other's vessels," said Bryan Clark, a
retired Navy strategist now with the Center for Strategic & Budgetary
Assessments. "Unlike the South China Sea, [the [Arctic will not be a
transit area for 30-40 percent of world trade;]{.mark} will not be
adjacent to the homes of more than one billion people; [and not subject
to multiple overlapping and unresolvable claims."]{.mark} "The [parties
up there]{.mark} are [abiding quite nicely with international
law]{.mark}]{.underline} by and large," added a Washington analyst who
works on Arctic issues. "To date, [the Russians have been good,
meticulously good, about living up to UNCLOS]{.underline} (the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea) on things like the continental shelf
claims process." "They have very poor behavior in parts of Europe (and)
in cyberspace...but the [[Russians]{.mark} in fact a[dhere to
t]{.mark}he letter and spirit of [the law of the]{.mark} sea in the
[Arctic]{.mark},"]{.underline} agreed retired Rear Adm. David Titley,
who led the Navy's efforts on oceanography and climate change. "There
are some similarities to the South China Sea in the sense that multiple
countries will use that water, and the Arctic will be seen in the not
too distant future as a very strategic waterway. I would be really
cautious in taking the analogy too much further than that." "There are
security issues kind of under the surface, under the radar," Titley told
me. So it's possible the Arctic could blow up unexpectedly some day,
just as the South China Sea has. [But [both China and Russia have shown
restraint so far.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yes, China's increasing interest
in a region so far from its shores is a sign of Beijing's growing global
ambition. Besides sending the Sea Dragon, China has gotten observer
status on the Arctic Council and courted the member nations. In fact,
Titley said, ["China has been actively courting the native
Greenlanders."]{.underline} Presumably, he said, Beijing is playing a
very long game in which the underpopulated island secedes from Denmark
and becomes the "Kuwait of the north," located astride key trade routes
and oil fields but dependent on foreign money and workers to exploit
them. Greenland notwithstanding, though, [[China has no territorial
claims in the Arctic.]{.mark} That's a stark contrast to the Western
Pacific.]{.underline} There prickly national pride is at stake in
centuries-old claims to what China considers sovereign territory. [The
US and allied naval presence there brings up painful memories of the
"century of humiliation"]{.underline} at the hands of Western and
Japanese imperialists. It also comes uncomfortably close to major bases
on Hainan. [[The Arctic will never matter as much to
China.]{.mark}]{.underline} In contrast to China, Russia has a long
history in the Arctic, a major military presence and disputed
territorial claims. In recent years, Russia has rebuilt military bases
and a fleet of icebreakers along its long northern coast. That said,
[comparing Russia's 40 icebreakers to America's two is
"silly,"]{.underline} Titley said[, since the US has nowhere near as
much Arctic coastline to keep clear]{.underline}; it's like Tampa
complaining that Toronto has more snow plows. [The so-called Northern
Sea Route runs through this region, and Russian claims part of it as
internal waterways,]{.underline} which Europe and the US quietly
dispute. In recent years, however, [trade along this route has
stagnated, lowering the stakes.]{.underline} A 1920 treaty also allows a
major Russian research station on Norway's strategically located but
polar-bear-infested island of Svalbard. Further afield, Moscow is
pressing a claim to the seabed all the way to the North Pole. Denmark,
which owns Greenland, has also claimed the polar seabed, and Canada may
as well. (The US has done surveys but can't submit a claim because it
hasn't ratified UNCLOS). Unlike the overlapping claims in the South
China Sea, however, [the [Arctic claims]{.mark} don't concern who can
sail, fish, or conduct military operations in the water. Instead, they
[only cover mineral rights to the sea floor and
below]{.mark}.]{.underline} That's sensitive, since everything from oil
to natural gas to manganese nodules is down there, but at least [[it
doesn't affect freedom of navigation for ships, submarines, and
planes.]{.mark}]{.underline} The seafloor claims are also based on
arcana of the "extended continental shelf" -- much of the Arctic Ocean
is shallow -- as defined under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS). The competitors are making their case with survey vessels, not
warships. The final ruling will come from UN scientists based in New
York, though Russia might disregard them, as China has their
counterparts in the Hague. That said, [[Russia has less incentive to
flip the table in the Arctic]{.mark} than China has in the
Pacific.]{.underline} In contrast to the South China Sea, where it's
hard to drill for oil without hitting disputed waters, [the [majority of
Arctic resources]{.mark} seem to [lie in well-defined Exclusive Economic
Zones.]{.mark} ["Virtually everything is in already claimed and
recognized space]{.mark},"]{.underline} said Titley, "apart from a small
area actually between the Yukon territory and Alaska." (The US and
Canada are unlikely to go to war). ["There's really no debate on who
owns which exclusive economic zone in the Arctic."]{.underline} The
problem accessing Arctic oil, gas, and minerals isn't legal. It's
practical: Even when the ice melts, the region remains one of the
harshest environments on Earth. Too Hard To Reach? "There is a lot of
hype over the resource competition and there's a lot of hot air over the
shipping issue," the Arctic analyst said. "The resources are up there. A
lot of them tend to be inside people's territorial waters rather than
being out in the central basin (the disputed area), and they are hard to
access. And the drop in oil prices has really taken the wind out of a
lot of this. You really can't recover oil up there for less than \$80 a
barrel. (It's about \$50 today). Shell tried to do something up there
and essentially threw in the towel." Conditions will get easier as the
climate changes, albeit never as easy as the South Pacific. The Arctic
Ocean will be ice-free in summer sometime in the 2030s, Titley has
written. Just this month, a Russian LNG tanker is bringing Norwegian
liquid natural gas to Asia via the Arctic Ocean, without icebreakers
escorting it. Over time such trips may change from one-off to routine,
he said, but the ice cap will still come back in the winter months.
["Even as the Arctic becomes more accessible, it will not carry the
amount of trade the South China Sea does for several
decades]{.underline}, if ever," Clark said. "High winds, rough seas,
shallow water, and 9-10 months of ice coverage will not make it an
attractive route for large shipping vessels."

#### No Arctic conflict now - it's cooperative and does not compare to other global hotspots

While Pompeo's question was particularly blunt, his sentiment pervades
discourse on US strategy in the Arctic. The US Coast Guard's 2019
Strategic Outlook cited [China's "pattern of behavior" and "disregard
for international law" in the South China Sea as indicative of its
potential to infringe upon America's Arctic access]{.underline}. These
claims subsequently [informed comprehensive and costly action steps to
reinforce US security in the Arctic]{.underline}. There are geopolitical
parallels between the Arctic and the South China Sea, making it easy to
wonder whether increased economic activity in the former could lead the
region to become as hotly contested as the latter. Although this
comparison might seem apparent, the two regions differ in several
crucial ways. [[The Arctic is an incredibly cooperative
region]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in comparison to the South China
Sea. [The dynamics of military involvement, the forms of territorial
disputes, and relative resource accessibility also differ between the
two areas. The Arctic is thus unlikely to be the next South China Sea
[and should not be treated]{.mark} as such
[geopolitically]{.mark}]{.underline}. As climate change warms the
Arctic, [[sea ice is rapidly melting, opening the region to exploration
and exploitation]{.mark} that was previously impossible]{.underline}.
Analyses of Arctic seabeds have found major reserves of oil and natural
gas. Estimates show that 30 percent of the world's undiscovered gas and
13 percent of its untapped oil lie in the region---[[access to]{.mark}
these [oil and gas reserves]{.mark} would [lead to immediate energy
independence for any Arctic country]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The Arctic
is also rich in minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}, including iron ore,
copper, cobalt, nickel, zinc phosphates, and diamonds. Many of these
metals are [[necessary to develop the components of a green
economy]{.underline}]{.mark}, from wind turbines to electric vehicle
batteries. Arctic countries---Norway, Finland, Sweden, the United
States, Russia, Denmark, Canada, and Iceland---as well as "near-Arctic"
China, have begun expressing their ambitions to exploit these resources.
[[The South China Sea is another geopolitically significant
region]{.underline}]{.mark}, where multinational competition over access
to resources, strategic positions, and trade routes has ballooned into a
more overt, hostile conflict[. Since the 1970s]{.underline}, China,
Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia, among other
[countries, have made competing claims over islands and zones in the
South China Sea]{.underline}. [As in the Arctic, [significant untapped
oil and gas reserves have been discovered]{.mark} in the South China
Sea's floor]{.underline}. [[The region also serves as a vital passage
for maritime navigation]{.underline}]{.mark}. But beyond these general
similarities, comparisons between the Arctic and the South China Sea are
excessively simplistic. The [Arctic's main governing body is [the Arctic
Council]{.mark}, an intergovernmental organization consisting of eight
member states]{.underline} (the eight Arctic countries) [and thirteen
observing states]{.underline}, including China, Germany, and India.
Since the end of the Cold War, the Council has resolved disputes in the
region by publishing agreements and establishing norms for environmental
sustainability. The Council is consensus-based and relies on cooperation
between all members. [It [has]{.mark} been applauded for its [success as
a forum]{.mark} for Arctic states and Native peoples [to address]{.mark}
shared [concerns]{.mark}, relying on science, deliberation, and
trust]{.underline}. The Arctic Council has even been uplifted as a model
for other regions in need of cooperative governance solutions. [[The
S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [[does not have a unified governance
structure]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recent efforts to resolve territorial
disputes have come from the intergovernmental Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN has 10 member states---Brunei, Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand, and Vietnam---and aims to be a cooperative platform for
addressing regional economic and security issues. Although it has
experienced some success in fostering the economic integration of its
members, the Association has struggled to respond cohesively to China's
territorial claims. [[ASEAN's slow-moving attempts to create a]{.mark}
South China Sea [Code of Conduct have granted China]{.mark} ample [time
to bolster its military presence and consolidate]{.mark} its
[operations]{.mark} in the contested waters---[making the dynamics of
military involvement in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea
[far different from in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Although Russia
and China have made assertions of their interests in the Arctic, they
have both been relatively civil. [In the South China Sea, conversely,
China has established a much stronger military presence]{.underline}.
Even as the Arctic warms up to increased activity, military concerns are
less pressing. Canadian Inuit military leaders point to the unforgiving
conditions of the Arctic and the general lack of preparedness of Arctic
countries for polar conflict as reasons to doubt any outbreaks, at least
in the short term. Under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea,
countries have jurisdiction over all living and nonliving resources
within the 370-kilometer exclusive economic zone (EEZ) off their coasts.
Contested EEZs are central to the conflict in both the Arctic and South
China Sea. However, the types of EEZ disputes are different between the
two regions. Much of the Arctic's natural gas reserves lie beyond the
EEZ of any singular country. As a result, nations who desire the
resources of the Arctic must try to expand these zones. Russia has made
three attempts to expand its EEZ, first in 2001 and most recently in
2021, claiming that its continental shelf covers up to 70 percent of the
Arctic. These proposals have not been approved by the UN, and Russia has
yet to overstep its boundaries. [[China has successfully established a
far more advantageous EEZ in the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}, asserting its sovereignty over almost the
entire waters. China's nine-dash line, first mapped in 1946, extends its
EEZ by over 1,000 kilometers in some places and cuts through the EEZs of
Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia. In 2016, the
United Nations determined that the nine-dash line was baseless and that
much of the region should be under the control of the Philippines. China
has rejected the UN decision and continues to make exploitative
advances. Should EEZ disputes arise in the Arctic, they will concern
whether or not countries can expand into international waters rather
than the overlap in existing EEZs. [[China has made efforts to establish
itself in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, claiming to be a
"near-Arctic" state and referring to the Arctic as the "Polar Silk
Road." In 2018, it published the Arctic Policy white paper outlining
plans to become influential in the region. [China's motives for
[seeking]{.mark} such influence have explicitly concerned [resource
extraction and access to shipping routes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Despite
these assertions, China has no territorial claims in the Arctic, as it
does in the South China Sea]{.underline}. Connecting China's current
interests in the Arctic with future sovereignty claims is a stretch. The
Arctic and the South China Sea further differ in the relative
accessibility of their resources. [[Although the Arctic is becoming
easier to exploit, extracting resources]{.mark} from the region [is
still]{.mark} extremely [difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Harsh
[conditions and]{.mark} relative [remoteness pose]{.mark} significant
[challenges to building]{.mark} the proper [infrastructure]{.mark} for
extracti]{.underline}on. Moreover, this [[infrastructure would be
expensive and difficult]{.mark} to execute [at the scale
necessary]{.mark} to render projects]{.underline} worthwhile.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, among other nations, [[has made
tech]{.mark}nological [advances]{.mark} with its nonpolar deep-sea
mining equipment]{.underline} in recent years, [[making extraction
projects in the South China Sea much more feasible]{.mark} than those in
the Arctic. The [Arctic]{.mark} also [remains geographically isolated
from major centers of global economic activity]{.mark}, which continue
to gravitate toward Asia.]{.underline}

[[Nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} remain a perennial problem, but
their [strategic [value is **little affected** by]{.mark} the relative
number of [icebreakers]{.mark}.]{.underline} The 2019 DoD annual report
on [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} worries that Chinese civilian research
--- presumably some of which would be undertaken by icebreakers ---
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} support efforts to
[[deploy]{.underline}]{.mark} "[[submarines]{.underline}]{.mark} to the
region as a deterrent against nuclear attacks." Turning to
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, the bulk of its naval [nuclear
deterrent]{.underline} capability [[is]{.mark} based [in]{.mark} the
[Kola]{.mark} Peninsula.]{.underline} Much of [[Russia's]{.mark}
military [activity]{.mark} in the Arctic [is dedicated to defending this
capability]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Austin Long and Brendan Green show,
during the Cold War the United States relied on a combination of
sensors, information processing, submarines, and other anti-submarine
warfare assets to track Soviet nuclear-powered submarines armed with
ballistic missiles (SSBNs). To be sure, technology has not stood still.
Yet tracking Russian and Chinese SSBNs in or in transit to the Arctic
today would involve a variety of U.S. capabilities beyond or already
with access to the Arctic. If anything, diminishing sea ice might
undermine the ability of SSBNs to remain hidden. More generally, [[the
U.S.]{.mark} has [relied on]{.mark} its **[nuclear arsenal]{.mark}** for
decades [to deter]{.mark} nuclear threats. [It is **unclear**
why]{.mark} Russia or China possessing more [icebreakers would undermine
that deterrent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Icebreakers [irrelevant]{.underline} for US power and economic interests.

[Others]{.underline} have [argued that U.S. icebreakers are necessary to
signal resolve.]{.underline} For instance, Sabrina Shankman reports that
more than a dozen polar and military experts concluded that "if a rival
state decided to encroach on the U.S. exclusive economic zone . . . or
step up a military show of force," then the "presence --- or absence ---
of an icebreaker could . . . be a telling message of strength or
weakness." Presumably, though, [a [U.S. ability to respond with]{.mark}
more lethal [subsurface or aerial assets]{.mark} [would constitute
a]{.mark} telling [message.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Second, the [[implications of]{.mark} relative numbers of [icebreakers
look different when considering]{.mark} the **[vastly]{.mark}**
[different]{.mark} Arctic **[contexts]{.mark}**, particularly for the
United States and Russia.]{.underline} According to the Arctic
Institute, Russia has roughly 24,140 kilometers of coastline and two
million inhabitants in the Arctic. The Economist highlighted that, all
told, [[Russia has]{.mark} "at least [half of the Arctic]{.mark} in
terms of area, coastline, population and probably mineral wealth." The
Russian economy depends heavily on oil and natural gas, including from
the Arctic, for its federal budget and exports.]{.underline} As noted, a
sizeable portion of Russia's strategic nuclear deterrent is based in the
Arctic. [Russian interests dictate a large number of
icebreakers.]{.underline} By comparison, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has]{.underline} roughly 4,057 kilometers ([2,521
miles) of [Arctic]{.mark} shoreline]{.underline} and approximately
[68,000 people]{.underline} living in the Alaskan Arctic. [Oil and gas
extraction]{.underline}, even when including the non-Artic portion,
[[makes up]{.mark} a very [**small percentage** of]{.mark} the [U.S.
economy.]{.mark} The U.S. nuclear [triad is **not dependent**]{.mark}
upon basing or SSBN patrols in the Arctic.]{.underline}

#### Centralizing icebreakers [trades off]{.underline} with [more effective]{.underline} deterrence and [flips]{.underline} militarization.

The best way to deal with China and Russia in the Arctic is to address
disputes in their own backyards. Most of the pathways to a great-power
crisis that could end up affecting the Arctic stem from crises outside
the region. Engaging Russia and China elsewhere rather than focusing on
specific capabilities in the Arctic, including icebreakers, will thus
have salutary effects. The nominal Defense Department approach is to
enhance a combat-credible forward presence in Eastern Europe and the
Indo-Pacific. By deterring a conflict there, the logic goes, the Arctic
is less likely to suffer negative "strategic spillover." [A
[**fixation** with]{.mark} the number of
[icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, or ice-hardened vessels more
generally, [as part of competing with Russia or China in the Arctic [can
lead to **unnecessary** investments and **divert** military
assets]{.mark} better utilized elsewhere.]{.underline} Alternative
approaches might focus on some form of grand bargain or a more
restrained U.S. foreign policy to alleviate tensions. The hope of this
approach is that it might broadly reduce competition. That would then
also have benefits for the Arctic.

Local defense challenges in the Arctic will remain, of course. Those
should be addressed using political and economic diplomacy and refining
military concepts and capabilities as necessary. [[Resisting]{.mark} the
temptation to engage in numerical comparisons of [icebreakers]{.mark}
will [help avoid **alarmist** views that may]{.mark} [contribute
to]{.mark} tensions and, at worst, the
**[militarization]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the region if the Pentagon
deploys new resources in response to that perceived vulnerability. Other
concerns, such as China's interest in building airports in Greenland,
are best dealt with by diplomatic, information, and economic tools
rather than military platforms (though trying to buy Greenland probably
isn't the best approach). Even if a larger defense role in the Arctic is
warranted, the United States should focus first on developing concepts
for existing assets, determining what infrastructure requires
modernization, and carefully examining how initiatives elsewhere can
benefit regional security and minimize challenges emerging from the
region.

As the climate changes, human activity in the Arctic (and Antarctic)
will increase. There is a need for additional icebreakers to augment the
Coast Guard's law enforcement, search and rescue, disaster response,
situational awareness, and scientific support missions, among others.
Indeed, "polar icebreakers support 9 of the Coast Guard's 11 statutory
missions." The only two not currently supported are "illegal drug
interdiction and undocumented migrant interdiction." Many of these tasks
clearly advance U.S. national security.

[But [placing icebreakers in]{.mark} a [central]{.mark} defense [role
comes with **opportunity costs.**]{.mark}]{.underline} If the United
States does field multiple new icebreakers, those ships may find defense
missions taking up more and more of their time. As a result, [[they will
be less able to support]{.mark} the myriad of [homeland security
and]{.mark} important [scientific missions]{.mark}]{.underline} they
will be increasingly called upon to perform. It is worth noting the
Coast Guard identified a need for six new icebreakers in 2013 (and gaps
in support for polar missions in 2010), before the public discussion in
Washington shifted to the return of great-power competition broadly and
in the Arctic specifically. Coast Guard polar security cutters will have
plenty to do without additional tasks to offset a perceived military
vulnerability arising from Russian and Chinese icebreakers.

#### Icebreakers not key to heg- they don't address fundamental security concerns or alliances

However, [[using **relative icebreaker** fleet]{.mark} sizes as a **key
metric** for]{.underline} the state of [strategic competition in the
Arctic [is **flawed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While they are an important
platform, [[icebreakers do **little** to]{.underline}]{.mark} create or
**[[address]{.underline}]{.mark}** the most commonly identified
[[defense challenges]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. Instead,
[[analysts should focus on]{.mark} the [**nature** of]{.mark} the
military [risks]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic, [the [role of
**allies**]{.mark} and partners]{.underline}, [[and **economic
interests**]{.mark} in a broader geopolitical context rather than
comparing specific capabilities]{.underline}. [[Doing
so]{.underline}]{.mark} is important to [[avoid
**mischaracterizing**]{.underline}]{.mark} the scope of the [[danger or
emphasizing]{.mark} the **[wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline} types of
[[solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Icebreaker Fleets If relative
icebreaker counts are the right way to measure competition in the
Arctic, then the United States is in trouble. Russia possesses more than
40 icebreakers and plans to build more, with a goal of 13 heavy-duty
icebreakers in operation by 2035. China recently acquired its second,
and first domestically built, icebreaker and has aspirations for a
nuclear-powered variant. By contrast, the United States has one aged
heavy icebreaker and one medium version in operation. While there are
plans to build six more (including three heavy icebreakers at an
estimated total cost of \$2.6--2.95 billion), funding is largely limited
to the first one and it will not be available until 2023 or 2024. Unlike
past fears that the United States was on the wrong side of a bomber gap,
missile gap, or the dreaded mine-shaft gap, an icebreaker gap does
indeed exist. Most analysts who warn about the gap distinguish the Coast
Guard's role --- which operates U.S. icebreakers and is part of the
Department of Homeland Security in peacetime ---from the Department of
Defense mission set. Yet placing the icebreaker discussion alongside
threats from Russia and China makes an implicit or explicit connection
between icebreakers and U.S. military vulnerability. The Consequences of
an Icebreaker Gap Thankfully for Washington, the consequences of this
icebreaker gap for U.S. defense are often misunderstood or overstated.
First, many of [the **[specific military challenges]{.mark}** that China
or Russia]{.underline} might [pose in the Arctic [are **independent** of
**icebreakers**]{.mark} and [best dealt with in **other
ways**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These include [[denying]{.mark} the United
States **[access]{.mark}** to the region]{.underline}, [**[missile
strikes]{.mark}** against the homeland]{.underline}, [the [ability to
**move forces**]{.mark}]{.underline} from the homeland, and
demonstrating U.S. strength against challenges. It is [not clear how
Russia or China would **leverage icebreakers** to exclude the United
States]{.underline} from the region, [or how the United States would
**utilize icebreakers** to overcome such attempts]{.underline}. Take the
concern of [Russia denying access]{.underline} along the Northern Sea
Route (setting aside the limited trans-Arctic shipping to date and
modest future projections). The Russian ability to do this [stems
primarily from their growing **missile**]{.underline},
**[air]{.underline}**, [and **surveillance capabilities** deployed
within their **own territory**]{.underline}. As Mathieu Boulègue
observes, the Russian Northern Fleet will likely be able to perform some
sea denial missions "at a limited operational tempo." Yet "the majority
of [its [assets are **not Arctic-specific**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[operating **beyond** the region]{.underline} and in other strategic
directions." [**[Increasing]{.mark} the [numbers of U.S.
icebreakers]{.mark}** [would not overcome]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[Russian shore]{.mark}-based [area-denial]{.mark}]{.underline}**
challenge. In the event of a crisis, naval surface vessels operating
behind slow-moving icebreakers would be, Andreas Kuersten notes,
"sitting ducks for aerial, undersea, and shore-based enemy forces."
[Icebreakers would play a **marginal role** in countering]{.underline}
other [military challenges]{.underline} to the United States emerging
from the region. [**Missiles** fired from the Russian
Arctic]{.underline} toward the United States would traverse over the
Arctic. The status of what the DoD terms the "aging North Warning
System" is a greater concern from this perspective than a lack of
icebreakers. Similarly, while Russia's icebreakers are important for its
Northern Fleet's ability to operate in and through the Arctic, [the
number of U.S. icebreakers has **little bearing**]{.underline} on this.
[Addressing Russia's ability to **project power**]{.underline} into the
North Atlantic, the DoD Arctic strategy [focus]{.underline}es [on other
capabilities]{.underline}. These include cooperation with Great Britain
and Norway on P-8 patrols, NATO air policing missions from Iceland, and
a recognition that establishment of Joint Force Command Norfolk helps to
protect the North Atlantic sea lines of communication to Europe.
[[Nuclear]{.mark} weapons]{.underline} remain a perennial problem, but
their [**strategic [value]{.mark}** [is **little affected** by]{.mark}
the **relative number** of [icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}. The 2019
DoD annual report on China worries that Chinese civilian research ---
presumably some of which would be undertaken by icebreakers --- could
support efforts to deploy "submarines to the region as a deterrent
against nuclear attacks." Turning to Russia, the bulk of its naval
nuclear deterrent capability is based in the Kola Peninsula. Much of
Russia's military activity in the Arctic is dedicated to defending this
capability. As Austin Long and Brendan Green show, during the Cold War
the United States relied on a combination of sensors, information
processing, submarines, and other anti-submarine warfare assets to track
Soviet nuclear-powered submarines armed with ballistic missiles (SSBNs).
To be sure, technology has not stood still. Yet tracking Russian and
Chinese SSBNs in or in transit to the Arctic today would involve a
variety of U.S. capabilities beyond or already with access to the
Arctic. If anything, diminishing sea ice might undermine the ability of
SSBNs to remain hidden. More generally, [the [U.S.]{.mark} has [relied
on]{.mark} its **[nuclear]{.mark} arsenal** [for **decades** to
**deter**]{.mark} nuclear threats]{.underline}. [It is [**unclear**
why]{.mark} Russia or China **possessing [more icebreakers]{.mark}**

**[[Number of icebreakers tells you little]{.mark} Arctic-related
[stories love to count]{.mark} how many [icebreakers]{.mark} the Arctic
countries have. This is often done [to showcase how]{.mark} Russia is
dominating in the Arctic and the [USA is a laggard]{.mark}. The [main
problem here is that icebreakers are contextual.]{.mark} A range of
[different factors explain why Russia has the number of icebreakers it
has]{.mark}: the [size of]{.mark} its Arctic [coastline, economic
activity]{.mark}]{.underline} in that area[[, and ice
conditions]{.mark}]{.underline} (which is why you have a breaker-of-ice
in the first place). This is beside the intra-institutional set-ups of
each Arctic coastal state concerning coast guard / navy tasks and
whether icebreakers are even useful for the latter. Do not get me wrong.
There is no doubt that the USA is in need of more icebreakers. It
currently has only two operational ones: the USCGC Healy from 1999 and
the USCGC Polar Star from 1976. Moreover, icebreakers are important for
a number of reasons, including their ability to support ship traffic,
keep harbours open in wintertime, and conduct research at high
latitudes. However, [[icebreakers are not the ultimate sign of strength
or military power]{.mark} in the Arctic. [Other parameters, such as
military expenditure, presence and capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}
(beyond breaking ice), [[are better suited.]{.mark} [In most instances,
icebreakers]{.mark} are [not even operated by]{.mark} the various Arctic
[countries' armed forces.]{.mark} Why does [Finland have four times as
many as]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}A]{.underline} when it is not even an
Arctic coastal state? [[Because]{.mark} the country needs to break [ice
in the Gulf of Bothnia]{.mark}]{.underline} and is attempting to reap
commercial benefits from icebreaking services. As such, [the
[number]{.mark}s [of icebreakers do not demonstrate the]{.mark} Russian
[Arctic threat]{.mark}---there are [other things]{.mark} that [are more
relevant]{.mark} for that]{.underline}, ranging from military capacities
(like subsea or surface naval vessels, or airborne capabilities) to
patterns of behaviour (like military exercises, troop posture,
statements).**

[Icebreakers are integral to the security of the American Arctic, but
the media]{.underline}, pundits, and policymakers [have become confused
as to how.]{.underline} In a maritime region covered by ice for
substantial portions of the year, [these vessels are the only means to
ensure year-round marine access to northern communities and sea
lanes.]{.underline} As such, they allow for emergency response, law
enforcement, and commercial activity in one of the harshest regions on
earth. [Icebreakers are, however, of very limited value for defense
purposes]{.underline}, and[, yet, it is in military terms that their
procurement has increasingly come to be framed.]{.underline} This
creates more than simply a problem of semantics, as casting icebreaker
construction in such language risks negative practical impacts on the
Arctic and national security. [Despite their indispensable role in the
far north]{.underline}, the American icebreaker fleet --- [the
responsibility of the U.S. Coast Guard --- has been severely
neglected]{.underline}. It currently consists of one heavy icebreaker
(recently refurbished but due for decommissioning sometime "between
December 2019 and December 2022") and one medium icebreaker. [A second
heavy icebreaker has been out of service since experiencing engine
failure in 2010.]{.underline} Meanwhile, studies commissioned by the
Coast Guard put forth that three of each class are required for the
year-round fulfillment of northern responsibilities --- although the
Coast Guard vice commandant has said that the service only "needs at
least two heavy icebreakers" given current demands. Regardless of the
recommendation relied upon, there exists a gap between American
icebreaking need and the Coast Guard's icebreaking capability, creating
a northern vulnerability. Yet after substantial delay, [progress is
finally being made toward the funding of a new heavy
icebreaker.]{.underline} The Obama administration and members of
Congress have taken up the banner of icebreaker fleet recapitalization,
and the \$1 billion needed for such a vessel has been added to a
proposed bipartisan funding bill. [The Navy will also be joining forces
with the Coast Guard]{.underline} for the acquisition process given its
far greater expertise in large-scale ship procurement[. (It remains to
be seen whether this process will churn out a ship before the icebreaker
fleet is reduced to a single unit and the gap between needs and capacity
expands).]{.underline} Despite the aforementioned positive steps[,
however, popular and governmental icebreaker discourse is increasingly
framed in inappropriate terms]{.underline}. Beyond human, economic, and
environmental security --- and often in their absence --- icebreaker
procurement is increasingly advocated in terms of defense operations. As
an example, [Representative]{.underline} Duncan [Hunter]{.underline}
(R-CA), a key Congressional proponent of icebreaker construction,
recently [said]{.underline}: [My concerns continue to lie with current
mission gaps in the Arctic, particularly defense readiness, due to the
inability of assets to support year-round missions in the
region.]{.underline} And these concerns are driven by the conception of
the Arctic as a region of coming conflict and ominous comparisons
between America's depleted icebreaker fleet and Russia's fleet, which
boasts more than 40 vessels[. It is widely contended that the United
States suffers an "icebreaker gap" with regard to Russia]{.underline}
that it must close to adequately defend its northern interests and win
the "race for the Arctic." [But there is no race to be won.]{.underline}
Most Arctic territory and resources are solidly within the jurisdictions
of Arctic states, and disputed continental shelves are in the process of
being amicably apportioned under the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) (Although not party to this treaty, the United
States accepts the majority of it as customary international law
"binding on nations that do not specifically decline to adhere to
them"). [Arctic states have been operating under this body of law for
roughly 15 years.]{.underline} Contrary to what many in Washington might
expect, Russia has been an active participant in this process from the
beginning. Indeed, Russia has the most to gain from an adhered-to,
rules-based Arctic international regime (or lose if this regime
degrades). As such, it is unlikely that the spirit of cooperation that
pervades northern relations will evaporate any time soon. [Even if there
were a race for the Arctic that involved military forces, icebreakers
would be of limited benefit.]{.underline} Russian [icebreakers add
little military value]{.underline} in terms of any theoretical Arctic
naval combat. Strategic theaters where icebreakers must operate are
largely unfit for surface warfare and warships. [These vessels would be
confined to paths carved, and routes already plowed would refreeze
without constant icebreaker traversal.]{.underline} In addition,
icebreakers turn solid ice sheets into dangerous stretches of large,
floating chunks of ice, so even cleared paths are not without risk.
[Surface warships would therefore lack freedom of movement and be
sitting ducks for aerial, undersea, and shore-based enemy
forces.]{.underline} Moreover, even if icebreakers were to be armed
themselves, they would be ineffective warships. They are massive and
ungainly beasts, built for power and to crush ice rather than to
maneuver ably. This lack of inherent maneuverability is compounded by
the presence of ice in any environment in which icebreakers are needed.
(The Navy has stated that even the complete loss of icebreaker support
in the Arctic would have "minimal impact" on its responsibilities).
Russian icebreakers are not critical to the country's navy because they
facilitate Arctic naval surface warfare. Rather, they are strategically
essential because Russia's principal shipyards, Northern Fleet, and only
access route to the Atlantic Ocean without a major chokepoint are all
located in or traverse the Arctic. Icebreakers allow Russian surface
warships to enter and exit the country's most important naval bases and
reach the Atlantic Ocean. This is a necessity that has no comparison for
the United States. [Furthermore, the bulk of Russian icebreakers and
icebreaker missions carry out non-military duties.]{.underline} The
economy and shipping activity of the Russian Arctic dwarfs that of
America's far north. [And,]{.underline} as a petro-state, [Russia is
keenly interested in developing Arctic fossil fuels to maintain future
revenue streams.]{.underline} As such, Russia's icebreakers are integral
to maintaining Arctic shipping lanes and port access as well as
providing emergency response, rescue, and law enforcement capacity.
These are the core functions for which such vessels are needed in the
U.S. Arctic as well, but in much smaller numbers. In many respects, talk
of an "icebreaker gap" emulates the "missile gap" fervor of the late
1950s and early 1960s. Alarmed by the launch of Sputnik and reports of
the speedy development of Soviet intercontinental ballistic missiles in
the face of perceived U.S. stagnation, Americans became hyper-focused on
comparing missile counts between the two countries. But, as noted by
Greg Thielmann of the Arms Control Association, this "focus on simple
side-by-side numerical comparisons was misplaced; the more important
question was whether the U.S. ability to threaten devastating nuclear
retaliation was really in jeopardy." That is, the key policy locus was
not how many missiles the Soviets had, but how many the United States
needed to achieve its goals and best maintain national security. (It
must also be noted that the missile gap did not actually exist at all).
Similarly, the number of icebreakers possessed by Russia has no
significant bearing on the number the United States needs, nor on how
these vessels should be deployed. The unique character of its own Arctic
territory is the critical metric. [A defense impetus for the
construction of U.S. icebreakers is, however, more than just spurious
grounds for icebreaker procurement: poor issue framing can beget poor
policy, and poor policy can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities or
create new ones. First, if expensive icebreakers are purchased and built
with the expectation that they contribute to U.S.]{.underline} defense,
the Navy will be pressured to utilize them regularly for Arctic surface
warfare exercises and the sailing of warships through the Arctic. [Given
the low military tension in the region and the general impracticality of
surface warships in icy waters, this would entail significant
waste]{.underline} of naval assets and funds that could more fruitfully
contribute to national security elsewhere, particularly if Duncan's
vision of a year-round Arctic defense presence is realized. [Second,
constructing icebreakers]{.underline} with prominent defense
expectations risks meaningfully diverting them from their core functions
once built, which are: emergency response, law enforcement, research,
and facilitating northern commerce. If an icebreaker has to take several
weeks to be party to a naval exercise or lead a warship on a simple
Arctic "sail through," that is time the vessel is unavailable for what
it is actually needed for. Icebreakers contribute to U.S. Arctic
security by providing human, economic, and environmental security, not
by meaningfully enhancing northern defense capabilities. [Consequently,
efforts to frame these vessels in military terms risk degrading American
security both in the Arctic and elsewhere.]{.underline}

[Seven of the eight Arctic nations are]{.mark} either [NATO]{.mark}

well.]{.mark}]{.underline} These states' capabilities and geographic

### 2NC \-\-- Arctic Not K2 Heg

#### Arctic not key to US heg- greater threat to US heg in Ukraine rather than Arctic

**Ignatieff 24** (Micheal, professor of hisotry and former politician,
"The Threat to American Hegemony Is Real,"
https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/us-western-hegemony-vulnerable-to-russian-chinese-coordinated-challenge-by-michael-ignatieff-2024-03)

The post-1945 world order -- written into international law, ratified by
the United Nations, and kept in place by the balance of nuclear terror
among major powers -- is hanging by a thread. [The United States is
divided against itself and stretched to the limits of its
capabilities.]{.underline} Europe is waking up to the possibility that,
come November, America may no longer fulfill its collective-defense
obligations under Article 5 of the NATO treaty. Faced with this new
uncertainty, Europe is cranking up its defense production, and European
politicians are screwing up the courage to persuade their electorates
that they will need to ante up 2% of their GDP to guarantee their own
safety. The Western alliance doesn't just face the challenge of doubling
down on defense while maintaining unity across the Atlantic. It also now
faces an "axis of resistance" that might be tempted to threaten Western
hegemony with a simultaneous, coordinated challenge. The lynchpin of
this axis is the Russia-China "no-limits" partnership. While the Chinese
supply the Russians with advanced circuitry for their weapons systems,
Russian President Vladimir Putin ships them cheap oil. Together they
have imposed autocratic rule over most of Eurasia. [If Ukraine's
exhausted defenders are forced to concede Russian sovereignty over
Crimea and the Donbas region, the Eurasian axis of dictators will have
succeeded in changing a European land frontier by force]{.underline}.
Achieving this will threaten every state on the edge of Eurasia: Taiwan,
the Baltic countries, and even Poland. Both dictatorial regimes will use
their vetoes on the UN Security Council to ratify conquest, effectively
consigning the UN Charter to history's dustbin. This partnership of
dictators works in tandem with a cluster of rights-abusing renegades,
led by Iran and North Korea. The North Koreans provide Putin with
artillery shells while plotting to invade the rest of their peninsula.
The Iranians manufacture the drones that terrorize Ukrainians in their
trenches. Meanwhile, Iran's proxies -- Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis
-- are helping Russia and China by tying down America and Israel.
[Unless the US can force Israel into a long-term ceasefire, it will find
itself struggling to control conflicts on three fronts (Asia, Europe,
and the Middle East).]{.underline} Not even a country that outspends its
rivals on defense by two to one can maintain a war footing
simultaneously across so many theaters. The idea that democracies around
the world will join up with America and Europe against the authoritarian
threat seems like an illusion. Instead of joining with the embattled
democracies of the Global North, the rising democracies of the Global
South -- Brazil, India, and South Africa -- seem unembarrassed to be
aligning with regimes that rely on mass repression, the cantonment of
entire populations (the Uighurs in China), and shameless murder (Navalny
being only the most recent example). To be sure, [the authoritarian axis
currently is united only by what it opposes: American
power]{.underline}. It is otherwise divided by its ultimate interests.
The Chinese, for example, cannot be overjoyed that the Houthis are
blocking freight traffic through the Red Sea. The world's second most
powerful economy doesn't have all that much in common with an
impoverished Muslim resistance army or with theocratic Iran. Moreover,
both Russia and China remain parasitic beneficiaries of a global economy
that is sustained by US alliances and deterrence. That is why they still
hesitate to challenge the hegemon too directly. However, like sharks,
they smell blood in the water. They have not only survived US sanctions
but continued to prosper, replacing their dependence on embargoed
markets with new markets in Latin America, Asia, and India. [Both Russia
and China have discovered that American control of the global economy is
not what it once was.]{.underline} This discovery of American weakness
might tempt them to risk a joint military challenge. As matters stand,
US diplomacy and deterrence have successfully kept the axis divided. CIA
Director William Burns and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan are
keeping the channels open to China. Blowback American strikes against
Iran have apparently convinced the theocrats to rein in Hezbollah and
the militias in Iraq -- though not the Houthis, whom nobody seems able
to control. It doesn't take strategic genius to see the opportunity
China and Russia might be contemplating. If they decided to mount an
overt challenge to the American order -- for example, with a
coordinated, simultaneous offensive against Ukraine and Taiwan -- the US
would struggle to rush weapons and technology into the breach. Nuclear
weapons would not necessarily deter China and Russia from risking a
coordinated attempt to take Taiwan and the rest of Ukraine. All parties
would pay a horrendous price, but [Russia has shown what it is willing
to expend in Ukraine]{.underline}, [and both China and Russia may
believe that there will never be a more opportune moment to overthrow
American hegemony.]{.underline}

**deter adversaries**]{.mark}, **reassure allies,**]{.underline} respond
to crises, [and perform]{.underline} constabulary [functions for the

supporters]{.underline} --- under the illusion that "credibility
anywhere is credibility everywhere" --- darkly [warn that rolling back

[The opposite is true]{.underline}. [A **navy tasked to do all** these

**will [strengthen]{.mark}**, not **weaken**,
**[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For too long, short-term thinking

script. [Readiness for **great-power conflict**]{.underline} [--- peace
through strength rather than global policing --- should once again be
America's **primary grand-strategic aim**.]{.underline}

Too Busy, and Too Small

Few Americans appreciate just how busy their navy is. [At any time, over
one-third of U.S. [Navy]{.mark} ships are deployed --- the greatest
proportion in history]{.underline}. Sometimes these ships are training
with allies and partners, buttressing American power. Sometimes they are
responding to crises where legitimate American interests are at stake
and force may be necessary. But many of the Navy's overseas duties are
unrelated to coercion or deterrence, including humanitarian operations,
freedom of navigation transits, "maritime security" patrols in far-flung
regions, or various missions under the nebulous banner of norms
enforcement.

As my research has shown, [these [**operations** come at a
**cost**]{.mark}: They [have **shrunk** and]{.mark} [**weakened**
the]{.mark} U.S. Navy's **[surface fleet]{.mark}** to a shadow of its
former self]{.underline}. The reasons lie in politics, poor strategic
foresight, and bureaucracy. While critics usually describe the problem
as a mismatch between operational "demand" and the "supply" of ships,
this mismatch is itself a symptom of an underlying national confusion
about the purpose of the Navy itself. The hard truth is that stale ideas
about America's proper role in the world have outlived the geopolitical
circumstances in which they germinated.

After the Soviet Union dissolved, U.S. policymakers saw a new world
marked by brush-fire conflicts, civil wars, and economic dislocation due
to globalization. Global policing, albeit under more the palatable terms
like "engagement" or "liberal internationalism," became the dominant
foreign policy consensus. To offer flexibility for these brush fires,
the Navy designed its fleet around carrier strike groups and amphibious
readiness groups. The Navy made this case --- that an uncertain world
required presence, and presence required carriers, amphibious ships, and
supporting multi-mission combatants --- in its own planning documents,
and led a public relations campaign to this effect. The 1993 Bottom-Up
Review (the Department of Defense's seminal assessment of required force
structure for the post-Cold War era), under a section entitled "naval
presence," explicitly stated that naval forward presence would require
more large-deck ships than the Navy would need if it used the same
force-planning metric as the other services (the two "major regional
contingency" standard). In other words, "presence" as an idea was good
for the Navy's bottom line --- at first.

Circumstances soon changed. First, the large, exquisite ships that
carrier strike groups and amphibious readiness groups required were
expensive. Over time, this drove up customer costs and lifecycle costs,
and inhibited alternative force structures and platform choices, because
the coalition of contractors and policymakers benefiting from the
presence-oriented force structure objected to changes. Accordingly, with
time, the Navy purchased fewer vessels overall, and the fleet began to
shrink.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military's geographic combatant commanders ---
empowered a few years earlier under the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act ---
began demanding surface ships for nearly every crisis that arose in
their theaters. Policymakers, too, grew accustomed to "showing the
flag." Sending a carrier strike group to a hot zone was appealing, as it
avoided the political risk and financial cost of overseas basing and was
an easy way to ratchet diplomatic pressure up and down.

In essence, the Navy did its job too well: It designed a fleet and
promoted a concept for operating it that policymakers and combatant
commanders found addictive. So, throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s,
the surface fleet got busier and busier while becoming smaller and
smaller.

Like a car, a ship can only be run so hard until it becomes too
expensive to maintain. As the Navy overused its ships, they retired
early. Other ships picked up their slack and were then overused
themselves. To support the rising tempo of operations, the Navy
repeatedly delayed maintenance on ships. America's shipyards, which
required predictable contracts to remain economically viable, bled
skilled laborers, driving up costs in an endless cycle.

The result was that the surface fleet shrank from over 400 ships in 1994
to an all-time-low of 272 vessels during the Obama administration
(today, it sits at around 300). Even with an ongoing multi-decade,
multi-billion-dollar investment in the nation's public shipyards, the
U.S. Navy will not clear its maintenance backlogs until at least 2040.
Even the chief of naval operations recently acknowledged that the fleet
will not grow any time soon. [Wargames indicate that,]{.underline} [were
the United States to fight China, the U.S. Navy might eke out a
**nominal win**, but one that **blurs** the **line** between victory and
defeat, setting back **American military power** for a
**generation**.]{.underline}

The Readiness Trade-Off

How was all this allowed to happen?

Everyone, from the combatant commanders to the Navy, lost sight of the
trade-off between operational and structural readiness. "Operational"
readiness refers to the ability of existing military units to fight
tonight. "Structural" readiness refers to a military's ability to
generate sufficient mass for multiple rounds in a prolonged fight,
including factors like the health of the defense-industrial base. In
basic terms, an extremely high level of operational readiness is
required for global policing duties; whereas if the goal is fighting a
long war against a peer competitor, structural readiness is more
important. If resources are finite (which they always are), the two
trade off.

In brief, for three decades, [the U.S. Navy traded its [structural
readiness]{.mark}]{.underline} (for great-power conflict) [for
**operational readiness**]{.underline} (to support naval forward
presence). It [[burned through]{.mark} its **[ships]{.mark}**, and
**debilitated its shipyards**]{.underline}, to [make sure it could
respond to whatever policymakers wanted, whenever they wanted it, no
matter how [irrelevant]{.mark} it was [to **deterrence**]{.mark} and
**warfighting**.]{.underline}

This was not a problem in the 1990s, when the same fleet busy with
presence operations could still fight off any foreseeable challenger.
But by 2015, given the rise of China, the Navy, oversight agencies,
contracted research organizations, and think tanks were all sounding
alarms. Navy leaders begged Congress, time and again, to reduce the
frequency with which Navy ships were deployed, so that the force could
recoup its readiness.

Then came the collisions. In 2017, two U.S. Navy destroyers, in separate
incidents, crashed into commercial ships, and 17 American sailors lost
their lives. Two investigations --- Secretary of the Navy Richard V.
Spencer's Strategic Readiness Review and Chief of Naval Operations John
M. Richardson's Comprehensive Review --- offered recommendations to
restore the Navy's readiness. The Navy's highest-level investigation
even recommended "condition\[ing\] congressional and executive branch
leaders to accept that the higher cost and time to achieve established
readiness standards will mean less Navy presence worldwide." This never
happened, because Congress continued to assume the Navy could balance
both operational and structural readiness, as my research delineating
the hearings after the accidents has shown.

Legislation passed after the collisions resolved none of the Navy's
presence-induced headaches. Congress enacted reforms to restore
operational readiness but ignored the Navy's proposed reforms to improve
its structural readiness. The Strategic Readiness Review had proposed
changes to the Navy's readiness commands (such as eliminating the
so-called "Inouye Amendment") and changes to the adjudication of
combatant commanders' requests for forces. Instead, what the Navy got
was a little more officer training here, some sleep requirements for
officers there. After dipping for one year after the collisions, the
Navy's operational tempo continued its inexorable annual rise that began
in the 1990s. Presence was simply too popular an idea.

**[[Shipbuilding is Not Enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[The U.S. Navy's **[readiness]{.mark}** [for **sustained
combat**]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- and hence its **ability** to deter
China --- [is]{.mark} in a **[catastrophic]{.mark} state**]{.underline}.
The Trump administration should give the U.S. Navy a fighting chance to
rebuild itself.

It can start with the unfinished business of 2017, reforming the global
force management process (the process by which the Department of Defense
adjudicates combatant commanders' requests for military forces) to
prioritize structural readiness over emergent demands. In this process,
the service chiefs and the joint staff consider combatant commander
needs in their theaters and recommend service assets that can be made
available to them. Should a combatant commander need forces in excess of
this established allocation (an "emergent requirement"), he or she can
submit a "request for forces." The idea that the services should "just
say no" to such requests is aspirational, but difficult. Why? Because
--- as the Strategic Readiness Review noted --- the Navy has developed a
culture of meeting non-stop (presence-driven) operational demands.

As the review also points out, [the multiple [overlapping
authorities]{.mark} and the adverse growth of staffs within the Navy has
[made]{.mark} tracking the long-term effects of operations]{.underline}
[on [**structural readiness** a **nightmare**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
addition, the staff of the chief of naval operations, located in the
Pentagon, appears biased towards operational demands and can lose sight
of long-term readiness. The problem is not that the Navy lacks input in
global force management, but that the Navy still does not "say no"
enough. To resolve this, the review recommended establishing the initial
force availability as the "maximum supportable peacetime force," such
that any further combatant commander requests for forces can only be met
with forces moved from other theaters. This is, in essence, a hard cap
on what the Navy can do, ensuring that unready units are never sent to
meet the latest and greatest combatant commander request.

[But [emergent demands aside]{.mark}]{.underline}, [Navy [operational
tempo will still **remain too high** to]{.mark} [restore]{.mark}
**structural** **[readiness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration [should]{.underline} therefore
[reevaluate]{.underline} [the idea of **naval forward presence**
itself]{.underline}: the notion that America's Navy is foremost a
provider of global goods, and a global policeman, rather than the
preeminent warfighting force of a maritime power whose primary goals
ought to be deterring --- and if necessary, winning --- [a great-power
conflict.]{.underline}

if the United States loses command of the seas, China will **step in**
the fill the vacuum]{.underline}. In fact, [**even if** the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [loses command of the maritime
commons, [China is **not positioned** to gain it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, by positioning China as an existential threat, the United
States is boxing itself in politically. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[courts disaster]{.underline}** [when it
**overextends itself** by seeking military primacy in the region. There
is one fundamental reason: **the tyranny of distance**]{.underline}. The
**[[maritime]{.underline}]{.mark}** nature of American [[**power** is a
**double-edged sword**]{.underline}]{.mark}, specifically when it comes
to its competition with China. [American command over the maritime
commons allows the U.S. military to project power globally, but
[when]{.mark} that [power is projected at]{.mark} a **[great
distance]{.mark}** from U.S. shores, as in the Western Pacific, [U.S.
forces are]{.mark} particularly **[vulnerable]{.mark}** to measures
designed to **raise the costs of access**]{.underline}. First, [a
strategy of maintaining command of the maritime commons in the face of
anti-access measures exposes U.S. dependence on allied territory to
support deployed forces]{.underline} through basing, infrastructure, and
logistics. Second, [[as the costs]{.mark} and risks [of maintaining
access increase,]{.mark} the [**asymmetrical stakes** become **more
constraining**]{.mark} for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[than for China. [Overcommitment]{.mark}]{.underline} has historically
been endemic to U.S. grand strategy, but it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
especially **[[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}** [now that China is
capable of inflicting heavy costs upon the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Instead, the United States should, together with
its allies and partners, focus on denying China command of the Pacific
maritime commons. [[It is]{.mark} **cheaper** and [**easier** to
**deny** command of the seas than to exercise it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
If China cannot gain command of the seas, [[the]{.mark} Western [Pacific
will **remain** a contested environment]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [one
[that China **cannot break out**]{.mark} **[of]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[China would]{.mark} either be forced to **[accept the s]{.mark}tatus
[quo]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} make a first move in which it
**[overextend]{.mark}s itself**.]{.underline} While [[giving up command
of the seas]{.underline}]{.mark} may seem unpalatable, it [**[need not
be fatal]{.mark}** to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
its]{.underline} allies and partners' collective [goal to maintain the
regional balance of power]{.underline}. The alternative is unlikely to
end well for them.

[FROM BEFORE THE COMMON ERA until Pearl Harbor, great powers competed at
sea as much as on land.]{.underline} Carthage, Rome, and Troy fought
regularly on the waters of the Mediterranean. Enormous fleets---the 1588
Spanish Armada boasted 130 ships---plied the oceans, fighting other
fleets, seizing prizes, and staking claims to territory. Even in the
days of sail, warships crossed the world: early in the sixteenth
century, the Chinese and Portuguese navies clashed repeatedly near
what\'s now Hong Kong. For millennia, nations sunk into their navies
amounts that might have ended want, only to behold the investments
literally sink. During the modern era, Argentina, Brazil, Britain,
Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States have
expended groaning chests of treasure on warships. Naval rivalries
between Britain and Germany helped ignite both world wars. The Pacific
Theater fighting of World War Il began in part because of America\'s
1940 decision to forward-deploy its fleet from California to Hawaii,
closer to Tokyo, and in part because Japan placed an existential wager
on the maritime theories of Alfred Thayer Mahan, a member of the society
of famous persons who proved, following their deaths, to have been wrong
about practically everything. [Many centuries of an extravagant naval
arms race culminated]{.underline} in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte
Gulf, where 367 warships and 1,800 aircraft hammered at each other with
cannon, bombs, torpedoes, and battleship shells weighing up to 3,000
pounds apiece. [Then the **naval [arms race stopped]{.mark}**[. **So did
naval fighting**]{.mark}. The [**seas have been quiet** for]{.mark}
nearly **[seventy- five years]{.mark}**]{.underline}, perhaps the
longest stretch without bloodshed on the waters since first the sail was
hoisted. [Some Argentine and British ships clashed during the 1982
Falklands conflict]{.underline}, and Iranian and Iraqi vessels scuffled
around oil tankers during the mid- 1980s, [but **[big fights]{.mark} at
sea [have come to a halt]{.mark}**[, as has]{.mark} the **great-power
[naval competition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [last time a major naval
battle occurred, India was not yet an independent nation]{.underline},
the solid-state transistor had not been invented, and the Dodgers played
in Brooklyn. [Century upon century of great-power competition at sea
ended with a **final score of 10---0**.]{.underline} That\'s the
[[number of supercarrier]{.mark} strike [groups possessed by the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [(ten) versus]{.mark} the number
possessed by [**all other** nation**s** combined
(zero).]{.mark}]{.underline} World War Il left the warships of the Axis
powers in Davy Jones\'s locker. The Soviet Union tried to step in with
bucket-of-bolts vessels that craved return to port; since about 1960,
the [[US Navy]{.mark} has **enforced hegemony over the blue
water**.]{.underline} \"Hegemony\" has a bad reputation in political
science, assumed always to be undesirable. In this case, the [[**size**,
**power**, and **competence**]{.mark} of the US Navy has **[banished
fighting]{.mark}** from much of Earth\'s surface. [For a
**half-century**, **no nation**]{.mark} **has [even attempted to
contest]{.mark} US [naval dominion]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
[all-electric, stealth- hull cruisers the United States builds are so
advanced]{.underline} ---nicknamed \"arsenal ships\" for their
firepower---[that no other nation has even experimented with a vessel of
this general type.]{.underline} The [supercarrier strike groups that
America deploys---full-deck, nuclear-powered carriers]{.underline}
bearing long-range jets, [protected by guided-missile destroyers and
screened by nuclear submarines---are so potent]{.underline}, to say
nothing of so expensive ( naval hegemony cost the United States \$155
billion in 2017), [that no other nation has tried to build one.
[**China** and **Russia** **possess no**]{.mark} **nuclear
[supercarriers]{.mark}**[, and have **none under
construction**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The limited-deck, diesel-powered
carriers China began laying down in 2015 will be suitable for patrolling
coastal areas but not for the open ocean, while [everything the US Navy
builds is intended to travel beyond the horizon.]{.underline} Because
the US Navy operates far from the homes of Americans, many are not
attuned to its size and might. Soldiers can march in Fourth of July
parades, and Air Force fighters can perform Super Bowl flyovers; the
Navy\'s boats can be observed only on the waves. Most who live in other
nations are not attuned to the US Navy either. There\'s no compelling
reason to think about a well-behaved military force stationed on the
opposite side of the globe. Under US Navy hegemony, [piracy still
occurs, but great powers have not seized merchant ships in three
generations.]{.underline} That cargo ships whose decks are stacked with
containers of valuable goods can steam anywhere without fear of being
impounded by a warship is the unseen reason global trade took off, and
global trade benefits almost everyone, while reducing war. The reality
that the [US Navy rules the blue water both **reduces a historic cause
of conflict** and **enables the prosperity of the contemporary
era**.]{.underline} Speaking at West Point as president, Obama said that
the United States does not use its might to acquire territory or seize
resources. Instead, [American might is employed to pursue what US
leaders believe is best for the world.]{.underline} Such beliefs may be
wrong, even tragically so. But has any other nation that possessed
overwhelming military force ever refrained from using force for conquest
or pursuit of riches? That is the unseen question of the oceans---unseen
because fighting on the water has stopped.

[US [Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} (USN) Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet [strike
[fighters]{.mark}]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[currently
[deemed]{.mark} [mission ready]{.mark},]{.underline}** [a dramatic
turnaround from]{.underline} **[significantly lower]{.underline}**
[readiness rates reported less than a decade ago.]{.underline} The navy
had reached the 80% rate for the twin-engined fighter and the related
EA-18G electronic-warfare variant in 2019. But the service has been able
to maintain its 80%-readiness target, service officials said earlier
this month. On 3 August, those [[officials]{.underline}
**[touted]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the jets' **[continued high
mission-ready rate]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which comes after the USN
for several years pursued a **concerted effort to improve
readiness**]{.underline} for an aircraft it describes as the "backbone"
of its fighter fleet. US Navy Super Hornets until recently fleet
suffered from precariously low readiness levels, owing to budget
restrictions, high operational demands and an outdated maintenance
system The 80% mission-readiness rate contrasts sharply with the reality
just a few years earlier. In 2017, fewer than 50% of the navy's F/A-18s
and EA-18s were ready to fly. According to Cirim data, the USN had 416
E/F-model Super Hornets in active service at the start of 2023, and 152
EA-18Gs. Senior leaders in the USN are heaping praise on one officer --
Captain Jason Denney -- for overseeing the change. Denney took command
of the navy's F/A-18 and EA-18G programme office in 2019. Known as
PMA-265, the office manages acquisition, delivery and sustainment of the
two aircraft for the service. The year earlier, then-defence secretary
James Mattis had mandated that all fighter types in the US inventory
achieve readiness rates of 80% or greater before the US government's
fiscal year 2019 ended in September of that year. During
[Denney's]{.underline} tenure, which concluded on 3 August, the USN
F/A-18 programme [office rolled out]{.underline} a series of reforms
called [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [Naval Sustainment
System-Aviation]{.underline} ([[NSS-A]{.underline}]{.mark}) -- [a
programme]{.underline} [meant to]{.underline} **[address maintenance
failings]{.underline}** [and to [help]{.mark} the **service [meet the
80% goal]{.mark}.** The]{.underline} navy describes [NSS-A as a
"**data-informed**]{.underline}" [framework that seeks to]{.underline}
"**[increase spare parts]{.underline}**, **[enhance
capability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[maintain]{.underline}**
[aircraft at a faster rate]{.underline}". The improved logistics system,
combined with increasing defence budgets in recent years and an end to
most active-combat operations in the Middle East, appear to have
produced results. Speaking at the 3 August ceremony in which Denney
handed over command of PMA-265, Vice Admiral Francis Morley praised the
Super Hornet pilot's role in the transformation, noting the F/A-18 was
the only platform to reach the 80% readiness target by the end of
FY2019. Denney "pioneered [[the NSS-A mode]{.underline}l]{.mark}, and
this year [[surpassed]{.underline}
**[full-mission]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[capable [readiness
rates]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[for the first time in]{.mark} the
[history]{.mark} of the programme]{.underline}", Morely says. The
uniformed advisor to the assistant secretary of the navy for research,
development and acquisition also notes the NSS-A changes reduced the
per-aircraft maintenance cost by half for each F/A-18. In written
remarks, secretary of the navy Carlos Del Toro says Denney was
"instrumental" in developing [[the]{.mark} new sustainment
[framework]{.mark},]{.underline} which [[is]{.mark} now [being
used]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[across the]{.mark} [navy]{.mark}.** The
[improvements]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline} F/A-18
[[readiness]{.underline} **[appear]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[to be
[lasting]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The navy first reported surpassing the
80% threshold in 2019, and senior admirals at the 2023 Sea Air Space
conference April confirmed publicly that 372 Super Hornets were mission
capable at the time.

[[Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} has long counted on its large fleet of
[[icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}---containing 41 ships, seven of which
are nuclear---to ensure its control not only of the Northern Sea Route
but also of access to the natural resources in and under the Arctic Sea
(Russian Transportation Ministry, February 20). The Kremlin apparently
sees this as a reasonable assumption given the role of such ships in
that ice-bound ocean and the much smaller icebreaker fleets other
countries have fielded, as no other country has more than a handful of
icebreakers (Rosbalt, July 15). However, three developments now call

### 2NC \-\-- No Chinese Threat 

#### China is not an Arctic threat

**Bekkevold and Hilde 24** (Jo, senior fellow at Norwegian institute,
Paal, professor at norwegian institute, "The New U.S. Arctic Strategy Is
Wrong to Focus on China,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/11/11/us-arctic-strategy-china-russia-alaska-geopolitics/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

[By identifying China as the main threat to U.S. interests in the
Arctic, the Pentagon's new strategy contributes to enhancing a somewhat
skewed narrative of the threat China actually poses there]{.underline}.
While some commentators portray China as a "polar great power"
attempting to push its way into the Arctic---and as Beijing runs highly
visible Arctic diplomacy---[the reality is that China currently has very
limited political, economic, and military influence there]{.underline}.
Whereas the U.S. strategy observes that China "seeks to promote the
Arctic region as a 'global commons,'" the Arctic is neither unclaimed
nor ungoverned. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS) constitutes not only the legal basis on which the Arctic
littoral states can claim sovereign rights to most of the Arctic Ocean
(this includes the United States, despite its failure to ratify the
treaty), but also a core of the governance regime covering the region.
Beijing's ability to use bilateral channels to enhance its influence is
also limited because four of the five are strong democracies and NATO
members---and that number increases to seven out of eight if the entire
Arctic Council (made up the five littoral states plus Finland, Iceland,
and Sweden) is included. [It is difficult to see any Arctic
nation]{.underline} beyond Russia being [keen on enabling China to gain
a strong foothold in the region.]{.underline} Indeed, evidence suggests
that the Arctic democracies have all become increasingly aware and wary
of Chinese overtures. For instance, when rumors surfaced in September
that local Norwegian authorities welcomed Chinese investors in the
Arctic port of Kirkenes, Norwegian Minister of Justice and Public
Security Enger Mehl quickly clarified that Oslo will not allow such an
investment if it runs counter to national security interests. Similarly,
[China has failed to entice Iceland and Greenland]{.underline}---both of
which are often seen as particularly vulnerable to the lure of large
Chinese investments. In fact, [most of China's attempts at investing in
Arctic resources]{.underline} outside Russia [have been put on hold or
have failed altogether]{.underline}. Even in the Russian Arctic[,
China's economic footprint is relatively limited beyond its engagement
in the Yamal liquefied natural gas project.]{.underline} Moreover,
[China's ambition for a so-called Polar Silk Road through the Arctic
Ocean has yet to result in any substantial shipment of goods through
Arctic waters.]{.underline} Regarding military activities, which is the
Pentagon's main concern, [China has no military presence in the Arctic
beyond brief visits.]{.underline} Chinese icebreaking research vessels
occasionally operate in the Arctic Ocean, and some of their research
activities may indeed have military value. In early October, Chinese
Coast Guard vessels sailed into the Arctic Ocean for the first time on a
joint patrol with two Russian Border Service ships. [It will take more
than a couple of icebreakers and coast guard vessels to make China a
military player in the Arctic.]{.underline} Wider research activity by
China in the Arctic, which members of the U.S. Congress drew attention
to recently, clearly may have a dual-use or purely military purpose. Yet
this should also be kept in perspective. While the Chinese Polar
Research Institute has a presence in Ny Alesund on Svalbard, a Norwegian
archipelago, and on Iceland, this is a minor engagement compared to its
five independent research stations in Antarctica. [Moreover, China's
lack of military presence and activity in the Arctic obviously reduces
the military value of any dual-use research]{.underline}.

Arctic Partnership" Oct. 30, 2023
https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/3571034/friction-points-in-the-sino-russian-arctic-partnership/

In 2018, China outlined its role and ambitions in the Arctic with a
comprehensive white paper titled China's Arctic Policy.1 In it, Beijing
identified four key areas of interest: shipping, resource development,
regional governance, and science. Underlying these specific priorities
is an ever-present and overarching theme of respect and participation:
respect for China's interests in the Arctic and for the involvement of
non-Arctic states in the region. In many ways, this policy announcement
marked the high point of China's influence in the democratic Arctic.
Since then, [**China's soft power** in the north has
suffered]{.underline} steady **[decline]{.underline}**, [as]{.underline}
Arctic [countries have digested the implications of China's human rights
abuses]{.underline} in Hong Kong and Xinjiang as well as its aggressive
posturing in the South China Sea and against Taiwan.2 Chinese "wolf
warrior" diplomacy tactics3 against some Arctic states have heightened a
sense of distrust, making it difficult to separate Arctic dynamics from
the principal challenge posed by China to long-term U.S. security and
prosperity and those of its allies more generally.4 While the trend in
the seven like-minded states (Canada, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia,
Sweden, and the United States) has generated a distaste toward
engagement with China as an Arctic actor, Beijing has asserted a growing
influence in Russia, where it has managed to consistently advance its
Arctic interests in these four priority areas. Indeed, the Sino-Russia
relationship in the north has tightened in the last couple of years,
creating a mutually beneficial strategic partnership, an easy access
point for China in the Arctic, and a willing financier and supporter for
some of Russia's key northern development projects. Western sanctions
imposed on the Russian economy in the wake of Russia's renewed invasion
of Ukraine have only increased its need for Chinese investment, markets,
and political support. And, in support of this partnership, China's
diplomatic messaging toward the Russian Arctic is defined by the same
"win-win" narrative that it applies globally, with specific attention to
the value of Chinese investment, shipping, and resource development in
the Russian north. Today, there is a broad policy consensus in Russia
about the desirability of keeping Sino-Russian relations on a positive
trajectory in political and economic terms.5 Chinese statements---and
tacit acceptance of Russia's invasion of Ukraine---suggest that Beijing
also sees strategic value in continuing to strengthen that relationship.
This confluence of interest creates obvious dangers for the democratic
Arctic states, which now openly recognize the economic, strategic, and
military dangers posed by both authoritarian states in the Arctic and
elsewhere. Yet despite the seemingly close partnership, [Sino-Russian
relations in the north are not]{.underline} quite the
[friendly]{.underline} terrain of two like-minded states advancing a
"friendship" with "no limits," as described by Vladimir Putin and Xi
Jinping in February 2023. Arctic [cooperation]{.underline} [for the
two]{.underline} authoritarian states [remains]{.underline} a **[highly
transactional]{.underline}** partnership, [underpinned by
deep]{.underline} and abiding **[suspicion]{.underline}**. [China's
presence]{.underline} and activities [in the Arctic have long concerned
Russian leadership]{.underline}, and while the outward face of that
partnership remains positive, the smiles and [handshakes rest on an
unstable foundation, riven by friction]{.underline}. As the world has
seen across the democratic Arctic, China's polar ambitions are subject
to pushback when Beijing's ambitions conflict with local values and
sensitivities. This article is an overview of Sino-Russian friction and
points of vulnerability in their Arctic relationship. Downplayed by the
Russian and Chinese governments and Arctic actors in those countries,
each of these real or possible disputes has the potential to degrade the
growing Sino-Russian strategic partnership in the region. In this
article, we highlight [three main areas of
friction]{.underline}---[navigation, resource exploitation, and
infrastructure]{.underline}---that [we see as exploitable gaps in the
relationship.]{.underline} [Western observers]{.underline} and
commentators should not be neutral in observing this relationship;
rather, we might [benefit from shining a light on these
issues]{.underline} that Beijing and Moscow have so assiduously sought
to sidestep[. In so doing, the like-minded Arctic states will be better
positioned to address Russia and China as]{.underline} distinct
[regional challenges rather than an inherently unified
front]{.underline}.6 China as a "Near-Arctic State" and the Role of
Non-Arctic Actors Chinese strategic messaging regarding the Arctic
promotes an image of China as a peaceful and friendly world power
seeking win-win economic cooperation.7 This narrative, common to Chinese
messaging around the world, is designed to blunt foreign criticism while
facilitating investment, scientific collaboration, and the entrenchment
of Chinese facilities and programs in foreign states. In the Arctic
context, this means securing access to shipping routes, Chinese direct
foreign investment in energy and mining projects, Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) infrastructure projects, and (potentially dual-purpose)
scientific research.8 Although the Arctic still holds the promise of
resources and shipping routes that could one day be important as part of
a global BRI as a "[Polar Silk Road]{.underline}" (PSR),9 many of these
[remain economically unviable]{.underline}. As such, [China's short-term
Arctic interests are more modest than]{.underline} many [Western
commentators sugges]{.underline}t.10 As the region's largest coastal
state and the most capable Arctic power, [Russia has]{.underline} long
[insisted that Arctic governance should remain the sole responsibility
of Arctic states, and Moscow remains intent on protecting its dominant
position in the region]{.underline}. [Beijing]{.underline}, in contrast,
seeks to alter the status quo by advocating a greater role in Arctic
governance. For years, China has [maintained]{.underline} [that
its]{.underline} [interests]{.underline} and capabilities in the Arctic
[make it a "near-Arctic state"]{.underline} while
[promoting]{.underline} the perception of the [Arctic as a global
commons]{.underline}, rather than a strictly regional space.11 As Dmitri
Trenin, former director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, has noted,
**["Russia is,]{.underline}** in a word**[, a status quo power, while
China is seeking to open up the region for the world]{.underline}** and
capitalize on that."12 Disagreements over Arctic governance offer the
most broad-based area for issues between the two states.13 In an
illustrative article for the Guangming Daily in April 2021, Dong
Yongzai, associate [researcher]{.underline} [at the Xi
Jinping]{.underline} Strong Army Thought [Research Center]{.underline}
at the Academy of Military Sciences, [echoes]{.underline} [a common
theme]{.underline} in Chinese political, academic, and media commentary:
namely, [that]{.underline} [China]{.underline} "should play a
constructive role in improving the rules of polar governance, promoting
peace and stability in the polar regions, and safeguarding the common
interests of all countries and the international community."14 In so
doing, it [advances the community of human destiny in the polar
regions.]{.underline}15 This phrase is an increasingly dominant frame in
Chinese messaging, which encompasses the idea that China must be more
active in global affairs as it seeks "to realize the 'Chinese dream' of
what Xi Jinping refers to as the 'great rejuvenation' (essentially,
China's return to the center of world civilization)."16 [Russia
has]{.underline} naturally [pushed back on]{.underline} this notion of
[Chinese rights, entitlement, and desire to internationalize the
Arctic]{.underline}. Indeed, [its concern]{.underline} about China's
emerging Arctic interests [was a]{.underline} [major impediment to
Beijing's application for an Arctic Council observer position**,
obstructing the process for 7 years**]{.underline}. [Moscow]{.underline}
reluctantly [approved China's application]{.underline} to the council
[only after]{.underline} considerable [pressure from Nordic
nations]{.underline} and the drafting of the council's "Criteria for
Admitting Observers," which required that new observers "recognize
Arctic states' sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in the
Arctic."17 In June 2020, in a revealing statement, [the **Russian**
**Foreign Ministry's** special]{.underline} [envoy]{.underline} and
senior official [in the Arctic Council]{.underline}, Nikolai Korchunov,
[stated that Russia is **not interested in delegating**]{.underline} its
share of [**responsibility for the Arctic** Region to other
countries]{.underline}. Korchunov stated, "The Americans are not
prepared for this, either. In this respect it is impossible to disagree
with U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo's statement made in May 2019
that there are two groups of countries---Arctic and non-Arctic. He said
so in relation to China, which positioned itself as a near-Arctic state.
We disagree with this."18 [This statement]{.underline}---from one of
Russia's highest-ranking Arctic officials, [dismissing China's entire
Arctic identity]{.underline}---[is telling]{.underline}. It was surely
planned to send a message and express a growing discomfort with China's
growing self-defined Arctic identity. The manifestations of China's
near-Arctic state identity have also been unsettling to Russia. In the
future, this may become more acute. While [**China's military has no
Arctic presenc**e]{.underline}, its growing icebreaker fleet and
commercial activities give it more capability and leverage in the
region. China's two icebreakers operate independently, and plans for a
new nuclear-powered vessel comparable to the Russian Arktika-class, will
give China the ability to match Russian access.19 This growing access
capability is concerning to the Russians, as it gives substance to
China's broader claims to a near-Arctic identity. There are also
concerns within Russia that China's civilian presence will support a
longer term military presence, although these thoughts are rarely
expressed through official channels. In 2016, Liu Huirong, dean and
professor at the Ocean University of China's College of Law and
Political Science, highlighted such Russian concerns that he saw
surrounding dual-use technology, specifically hydroacoustic research.20
Mapping the Arctic seafloor and studying ocean salinity and thermal
layers as well as regional ice dynamics are all activities of China's
civilian research program and are prerequisites to a naval
presence---particularly when considering potential submarine operations.
For Russia, this is a persistent fear that was dramatically brought to
the fore in June 2020 when Russian authorities arrested Valery Mitko, a
professor at the St. Petersburg Arctic Academy of Sciences. Mitko was
charged with high treason for providing Chinese intelligence services
with classified materials relating to hydroacoustics and submarine
detection methods. While the details of his activities are not public,
Chinese interest in co-opting an Arctic submarine expert must have
provoked new concerns over its long-term objectives. As China increases
its Arctic presence and capabilities, it will likely become more
strident about its rights in the Arctic and more unilateral in its
approach. [Russia]{.underline} has never supported such a presence and
[is explicitly opposed to any direct Chinese role in Arctic
governance]{.underline}. This divergence in policy and philosophy can be
papered over while China's role in polar governance is limited by its
minimal access and tempered ambitions. However, China clearly envisions
its role expanding in the future, in lockstep with access capabilities
and economic clout. As that happens, Russia will have to come to grips
with increased Chinese say in a region deemed to be of vital economic,
military, and psychological importance to the Russian state. Arctic
Sovereignty: Chinese and Russian Disagreements When China became an
accredited observer to the Arctic Council in 2013, it did so on the
condition that it "recognize Arctic States' sovereignty, sovereign
rights, and jurisdiction in the Arctic."21 This mollified many existing
Russian concerns over China's Arctic objectives, and in the intervening
years there have been no disputes over sovereignty or jurisdiction. This
harmony has been facilitated by China's relative absence from the
Arctic, where its ships make up only a small percentage of the voyages
across northern Russia.22 Beneath this harmony, however, remains deep
disagreement on the question of sovereignty and jurisdiction, which
strikes at the heart of Russia's position in the Arctic. [As Chinese
shipping]{.underline} and [activity increase, this disagreement may be
exacerbated.]{.underline} Central to Russia's position in the Arctic is
its assertion of sovereignty or control over the Northern Sea Route
(NSR), or Northeast Passage. While the precise nature of that
sovereignty remains somewhat ambiguous, Moscow claims to control key
straits along the NSR as historic waters, while its published maps
appear to extend its jurisdiction to the limits of the exclusive
economic zone (EEZ), which Russia claims to manage in the same manner as
its internal waters.23 As Russia's strategic thinking has increasingly
emphasized sovereignty, its national regulations related to shipping
along the NSR have been strengthened. In 2013, an authorization
procedure for ships to pass through the NSR was introduced, and between
2017 and 2019, Russia proposed further limitations. In December 2017,
the amendments to the merchant shipping code of Russia granted exclusive
rights to vessels sailing under the Russian state flag to transport
hydrocarbon resources produced in Russia and loaded onto vessels located
in the NSR. In 2018, [Russia banned the use of ships built outside the
country to transport oil and gas extracted from the Russian
Arctic]{.underline}. The following year, Russia added a new notification
procedure for foreign warships passing through the territorial sea of
the NSR. The new procedure means that a foreign state needs to submit a
notification concerning the planned passage no later than 45 days prior
to the start of the proposed passage. It also (under specific
circumstances) requires mandatory icebreaker piloting by
Russian-appointed personnel in the NSR.24 Under international law, such
regulations and requirements should be illegal. [The
Kremlin,]{.underline} therefore, [views the NSR as being firmly within
its]{.underline} (ill-defined) [sovereignty]{.underline}. It is central
to its core national security concerns and an important pillar of its
economy and future development. Given these views, the Kremlin is
committed to protecting its position in the region and would almost
certainly react strongly to any efforts that it perceives to threaten
that position.25 China has not forcefully asserted its position on
Arctic maritime sovereignty regarding the NSR but is unlikely to align
with Russia's views. [China's]{.underline} [2018 Arctic white
paper]{.underline} and statements [backed by senior officials stress
that Arctic shipping routes should be **open to all and governed by
existing international agreements**]{.underline}.26 [That position is
inflexible]{.underline}, given China's commercial reliance on transit
rights around the world. In Chinese expert circles, the Polar Silk Road
is also of growing interest[. In Chinese academic and media
commentary]{.underline}, these [northern routes (]{.underline}and the
NSR in particular) [are]{.underline}---by a wide margin---[the most
discussed elements of China's Arctic interests]{.underline}. Of note,
Chinese-language academic research and media [commentary consistently
assert China's rights of passage]{.underline}.27 Historically, Russia
has shown an aversion to a Chinese presence on this route. In 2012,
[Russia blocked Chinese vessels from operating in the NSR]{.underline},
causing China to suspend its research activities during its fifth Arctic
expedition.28 As recently as the summer of 2021, [Russia denied access
to Chinese sailor]{.underline} Zhai Mo, [a]{.underline} famous
[state-sponsored]{.underline} Chinese [adventurer]{.underline} [who was
attempting to circumnavigate the Arctic Ocean]{.underline} (though
access was later granted). While officially a private citizen, Zhai has
a history of asserting Chinese state sovereignty in disputed areas, a
fact that may have concerned the Russian authorities.29 To date, many
[**Russian experts claim that their government does not accept the
PSR**]{.underline} moniker, which uncomfortably subsumes the NSR into a
China-sponsored initiative.30 Despite misgivings, Russia has adopted a
cooperative position, given its need for Chinese investment in the
region. While both China and Russia have sidestepped the question of
sovereignty and jurisdiction, [as Chinese activity increases these
tensions will be harder to ignore.]{.underline} This difficulty will
manifest for Russia if Chinese shipping comes to dominate the
route---and particularly if China leverages its dominant economic and
political position to deploy its own icebreakers in support. Increased
shipping will also put China in the uncomfortable position of having to
choose between continuing to implicitly (or even explicitly) respect
Russian maritime sovereignty or adopting a clearer line on the freedom
of the seas. The former flies in the face of Chinese Arctic and broader
maritime policy, while the latter would seriously aggravate the
relationship with Russia and highlight the considerable gap between the
two on a political and legal issue of crucial importance to Russia.
Marine Scientific Research and Chinese Encroachment Over the past 20
years, China has undertaken extensive marine scientific research in the
Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. Chinese narratives surrounding this
research program center on questions of environmental research,
geophysics, and other purely scientific pursuits. Despite this,
automatic identification system tracking of the Chinese icebreakers Xue
Long and Xue Long 2 demonstrates a serious interest in resource mapping
and deep seabed mining. Historically, most of this work has been
undertaken on the American continental shelf north of Alaska. In
Washington, this was disconcerting enough to prompt a shift in U.S.
marine scientific research policy surrounding core sampling.31 Because
little Chinese survey work has been undertaken on the Russian
continental shelf or extended continental shelf, this activity has not
generated much friction. In 2020, however, that may have changed when
[China announced the research program]{.underline} [for]{.underline} Xue
Long 2's maiden [Arctic voyage,]{.underline} which centered on a survey
of the Gakkel Ridge. This area of seafloor is suspected to contain
sulfides, rich in copper, zinc, and other minerals. [Just outside of
Russia's claimed EEZ,]{.underline} the ridge was in a section of ocean
dubbed "the Area" by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS), [where access to resources is subject to governance
by]{.underline} the [International]{.underline} Seabed
[Authority]{.underline} and, through it, any state that applies for a
mining license.32 [Russian authorities]{.underline}
[reacted]{.underline} [quickly]{.underline} in 2021 (before Xue Long 2's
voyage), [altering their submission to the Commission]{.underline} on
the Limits of the Continental Shelf [to include the area being surveyed
by China.]{.underline} [This was a clear reaction to China's
activities]{.underline}, [representing concern over the Chinese
presence]{.underline} there. [**Despite** this new **Russian
assertion**]{.underline} of jurisdiction, **[China followed through with
its survey,]{.underline}** collecting seafloor samples and geological
studies that could facilitate later development. [Russia's position on
seabed mining]{.underline} and jurisdiction over the Arctic Ocean more
generally [is **diametrically opposed** to China's]{.underline}. While
both states accept UNCLOS as the governing structure for the region,
Russia has long sought to maximize Arctic state jurisdiction while
minimizing the extent of seafloor that might be considered "the common
heritage of mankind" (Article 136 of UNCLOS)---open to exploitation by
non-Arctic states. A central objective of China's Arctic policy has been
to maximize influence and access for itself and other non-Arctic states
in the region. Its position has been that it should play a leading role
in the development of deep seabed development outside of coastal state
jurisdiction (as outlined in Part XI of UNCLOS). While the economics and
technologies for developing these resources are not yet sufficiently
mature to render exploitation a near-term possibility, continued
geological research by Chinese vessels on the Russian shelf will
invariably generate political friction. To date, all Chinese resource
development activities in Russia have been as minority partners and with
the full cooperation of Russian state enterprises. Chinese research
activities on the continental shelf, however, are independent,
suggesting that Russian partnerships may not be required. As such, this
research poses a direct challenge to Russia's broader position that
Arctic resources should be developed by Arctic states and, potentially,
its direct control over what it declares to be its sovereignty and
control over the continental shelf. Chinese Investment: Both Limited and
Exploitative In the wake of the Russian invasion of Crimea and the
imposition of Western sanctions in 2014, [Moscow has turned to China for
the investment and markets needed to advance Arctic resource
projects.]{.underline} Moscow has had some success, most clearly the
Yamal liquid natural gas (LNG) project, of which 29.9 percent is owned
by the China National Petroleum Corporation (20 percent) and the Silk
Road Fund (9.9 percent). Yet [despite targeted Chinese investments, this
relationship has seen more rhetoric than real investment]{.underline}.
While [many joint projects have been announced, few have moved
forward.]{.underline} In 2009, Hu Jintao and Dmitri Medvedev [announced
more than 200 joint projects]{.underline}. Five years later, [less than
10 percent were actually progressing]{.underline}. In 2014 and 2015,
[Russia created 20 special economic zones to attract foreign
investment]{.underline} to its Far East. [Only six have secured Chinese
investment]{.underline}, [which totaled a mere \$38 million]{.underline}
between 2015 and 2018. [Genuine cooperation has often been held back by
red tape, poor infrastructure]{.underline} (both maritime and
land-based), [and corruption]{.underline}.33 Some of [the most
promising]{.underline} [Arctic infrastructure projects have also
stalled]{.underline}. China's Poly Group's proposal to invest \$5.5
billion in the port of Arkhangelsk is a clear example.34 Instead,
[China]{.underline} frequently [opts to invest in infrastructure
projects supported by other Arctic actors, such as Finland, Iceland, and
Denmark]{.underline}.35 Moreover, [given the high costs of natural
resource extraction in harsh climates, Chinese investors have questioned
the viability of investments]{.underline} with uncertain returns and
frequently opt to conclude lucrative and long-term energy deals with
other actors.36 [Chinese capital is clearly not as anxious to rush into
Russian projects as Russian state media makes it seem. Nor has Chinese
investment in the Russian north been as beneficial for Russia as the
state has advertised]{.underline}. [The most significant]{.underline}
business transaction [was the construction of the Power of
Siberia]{.underline} [pipeline]{.underline} [to export Russian gas to
China]{.underline}. [The pipeline began]{.underline} operations in
December 2019, marking an important step in Russia's economic pivot to
Asia. While the project was sold to Russians as evidence of the
country's broader economic options and reduced reliance on the West, it
does so [on]{.underline} reportedly [poor terms]{.underline}. When the
project was negotiated, [Russia was in a weak negotiating position, and
China took advantage of this reality.]{.underline} In essentially all
respects, [China dictated the terms of engagement]{.underline},
including when to go ahead with the pipeline, after more than a decade
of bilateral talks. The route of the pipeline closely followed Chinese
preferences, and gas pricing has been extremely competitive, to the
detriment of the pipeline's profitability. [The Chinese were able to set
the route of the pipeline and took advantage of Russian weakness on
pricing]{.underline} as well. While exact pricing is not public, it was
widely reported that an oil-linked price had been agreed on, with an
effective slope of 10 percent. This suggested a price of \$10 per
million British thermal units at an oil price of around \$100 per
barrel.37 The linking of the gas price to oil was a major Chinese win
and a hit to profitability, according to Sberbank CIB experts.38 Low
returns on the piped gas must also be weighted against the project's
extraordinary capital costs, estimated at \$55 billion (including
resource development). [Russian attempts to secure \$25 billion in
Chinese prepayments failed, leaving Russia to bear the full
expense.]{.underline}39 In May 2018, the Sberbank CIB investment
advisory group released a report questioning the profitability of the
project and suggesting that its rate of return is likely to be lower
than the cost of capital to Gazprom and to be unprofitable to Russia
even though the government exempted it from the mineral extraction and
property tax.40 Some analysts believe that when prices of oil fall below
\$60 to \$70 per barrel, **[Russia may effectively be sending gas to
China at a loss]{.underline}** (when amortized capital costs are
considered).41 Sitting at around 55° North, the Power of Siberia may
only be a "near-Arctic" pipeline (to steal Chinese phrasing); however,
it should be held up as a cautionary tale for future joint
infrastructure projects. Moscow has already announced that the Power of
Siberia 2 pipeline, drawing gas from Arctic fields, will replace Nord
Stream 2 by delivering 50 billion cubic meters of gas per year to
China.42 At present, these projects are used in Russian propaganda to
bolster the relationship and build support for the Russian government.
Western analysts have an opportunity to flip that script, highlighting
the Power of Siberia 1 line (and potentially the Power of Siberia 2) as
examples of China using its economic and political leverage to exploit a
weakened Russia. Likewise, Chinese investment more generally should be
looked at in a different light: from plentiful and productive to anemic
and exploitative. Following Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine,
many of these trends have become even more apparent as Russia has been
disconnected from the global financial system. [Despite]{.underline}
continued [public support for Russia, China has moved to limit
its]{.underline} own [exposure to the country]{.underline}. The
[Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank froze all its
activities relating to Russia]{.underline} and Belarus, [citing
"adherence to international law]{.underline}" and the need to "safeguard
the financial integrity" of the bank.43 [Belt and Road Initiative
projects have also been put on hold]{.underline}. According to the
report published by the Green Finance and Development Center of Fudan
University, no Chinese economic engagement regarding the Russia-related
part of the BRI occurred in at least the first half of 2022.44 This
decision likely relates to Chinese fears of secondary sanctions as well
as the growing volatility and instability of the Russian market.45
[Chinese support for Russian energy projects has also been thrown
into]{.underline} a state of [limbo]{.underline}. On the surface, the
future of this business relationship looks promising, with the Chinese
Ministry of Commerce openly stating that China will not support
oil-related sanctions or jeopardize Chinese businesses.46 Behind such
statements and implied support, however, this relationship faces growing
challenges. Chinese multinational oil companies are loath to run afoul
of Western sanctions, and China's embrace of Russia has not stopped
[Chinese energy firms]{.underline} from [discreetly pulling back from
new projects]{.underline}. Despite its official position in opposition
to sanctions, the Chinese government seems to recognize the difficulties
that they can cause multinational companies. In March 2022, the
[Chinese]{.underline} [Ministry]{.underline} [of Foreign
Affairs]{.underline} reportedly [summoned officials from the three major
energy companies]{.underline} (Sinopec, China National Petroleum
Corporation, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation) to review
their business ties with Russia [and "urged them not to make any rash
moves buying Russian assets]{.underline}."47 As a result, the corporate
response has been one of caution. In March 2022, Sinopec Group suspended
its talks with Russia's Sibur for a USD 500 million petrochemical
investment and a gas marketing venture. The reported reason for the
cancellation was Chinese concerns over secondary sanctions that might
impact Sinopec's global operations. According to the Russian side, this
caution was primarily motivated by Chinese producers' fear of sanctions
that could come from the side of the European Union.48 Sinopec also
suspended talks over a gas marketing venture with Novatek over concerns
that Sberbank (one of Novatek's shareholders) is on the latest U.S.
sanctions list.49 Construction of the Arctic LNG 2 project has also been
dealt a serious blow by a Chinese yard's decision to cease production on
critical modules. As a result of this and other sanctions-related work
stoppages, Novatek has halted construction on the two unfinished trains
(of three) on the project. Production of LNG was originally due to start
in 2023, but time schedules are now in flux.50 [As the Chinese
government]{.underline} and its state-owned entities digest the reality
of Russia's war with Ukraine and [adjust its approaches]{.underline},
investment may yet begin to flow[. The most likely
scenario]{.underline}, however, [is exploitation]{.underline}. As one of
the only major markets remaining for Russian resources and the only
clear source of investment, [China will hold extraordinary
leverage.]{.underline} One-sided oil or gas contracts or infrastructure
agreements can be used as a clear demonstration of Russian
subordination. The failure of Chinese investment to materialize,
meanwhile, would be a clear indication that the Russian pivot to the
east has failed. Either of these likely scenarios would belie the
win-win Arctic narratives being advanced by both Russian and China.
Conclusion [Russia and China's]{.underline} cooperative approach to
Arctic investment, shipping, and governance has been presented as a key
component of those states' growing partnership. In China, it offers a
new source of hydrocarbons and demonstrates the country's growing global
influence, while in Russia, it channels funds to key projects and
counters the impression that the country has been isolated by Western
political and economic sanctions. More broadly, the Arctic has been
presented as an area where the two Great Powers can demonstrate a degree
of solidarity as part of their continuing economic and strategic
conflict with the West. In October 2022, the U.S. National Security
Strategy noted the growing dangers of Great Power competition in the
Arctic. Russian remilitarization and aggressive behavior represent
military threats, while a rapidly growing Chinese regional presence
presents longer term economic and hybrid security risks.51 Individually,
China and Russia each represents dangers to the democratic Arctic
states; combined, those dangers are far greater. Yet this **[partnership
remains skin-deep, transactional, and deeply vulnerable]{.underline}**.
Important [disagreements over Arctic governance, sovereignty, and
development have been successfully papered over in support of
overarching economic and geopolitical objectives]{.underline}; however,
these sticking points remain just beneath the surface.
[Conflicts]{.underline} [between the two]{.underline} authoritarian
[powers are also likely to become harder to disguise,]{.underline} as
Chinese activity in the region increases and its global ambitions
expand. From a strategic messaging perspective, **[these
disagreements]{.underline}** (both real and potential) **[offer a gap
that could be exploited by the West]{.underline}**. Reframing the
conversation away from the win-win narrative being sold by Moscow and
Beijing both undermines their own messaging and forces a reckoning that
these governments would prefer to avoid. Chinese shipping and marine
scientific research are facilitated by a policy of purposeful ambiguity
toward Russian sovereignty. Simply put, Russia does not ask China to
explicitly recognize its sovereignty, which allows Beijing to avoid
telling Moscow something that might create a rift. This arrangement
works because the question is ignored. [Western observers have an
opportunity to press the issue, highlighting the difference in positions
and making that ambiguity harder to maintain]{.underline}. Likewise,
[questions of economic exploitation, pipeline routing, and research
should be elevated in Western conversations to a strategic
level]{.underline}. These issues have traditionally been relegated to
footnotes or obscure technical publications, yet these points have
broader implications that directly impact the ability of Russia and
China to maintain their "friendship with no limits" in the Arctic[. If
China is exploiting Russian weakness to secure cheap Arctic gas, that is
a point that should be amplified.]{.underline} When Chinese research
vessels work on Russia's extended continental shelf, [Western observers
should seek out clarification of China's position on Russian
jurisdiction.]{.underline} As Chinese Arctic activity grows and Russia
becomes more desperate for Beijing's economic and political support[,
the opportunity to highlight these gaps will only grow.]{.underline}
That relationship benefits from a lack of scrutiny, and [the time is
ripe for a more coordinated effort to reframe the conversation about
Russia's partnerships in the Arctic from that win-win friendship to
something more accurate: an exploitative relationship built on fragile
foundations]{.underline}. JFQ

Nestled in the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, [the slash-and-burn
playbook]{.underline} for the federal government [that the Trump
administration is following while saying it isn't, is a call for
American "science dominance." There is no such thing.]{.underline} And
what the project means by the term---turning the Department of Energy
into a handmaiden of the coal, oil and natural gas industry---betrays
not only the taxpayer but science itself. [By halting federal funds to
scientific research, canceling]{.underline} university [grants and
threatening to deport immigrant scientists, the Trump administration is
restricting the flow of ideas]{.underline}. By trying to legitimize
debunked scientific ideas and allocating taxpayer dollars to research
into those debunked ideas, the administration sows discord and
undermines the role of public health in preventing sickness and disease.
[By canceling global aid]{.underline} for public health projects, [the
administration is shunning the U.S. role in global health. And in their
push]{.underline} for energy dominance, [Trump and his allies are
kicking years of negotiation over climate change]{.underline} to the
curb. By becoming insular, by cutting out the world, [we stand to lose
our best and brightest minds in science]{.underline} and the exchange of
ideas that leads to innovation. Our country is a scientific and economic
powerhouse precisely because we have been so open and collaborative for
so long. China's academic scientific output, as measured by publications
in Nature journals, has surpassed that of the U.S. [How can cutting
federal science funding help the administration's intellectual
war]{.underline} with China? [How can the U.S. further its national
interests if we shut out ideas and people? How does democracy survive if
we stop research and the flow of information?]{.underline} In setting
the stage for the role of the U.S. government in science, Vannevar Bush
told President Harry Truman in 1945 that "[scientific progress is one
essential key to our security as a nation, to our better health, to more
jobs, to a higher standard of living, and to our cultural
progress."]{.underline} He noted the federal government's role in
supporting agricultural research and said, "The time has come when such
support should be extended to other fields." [From the 1950s on, the
U.S. government has been the largest funder of]{.underline} scientific
[research]{.underline} in the nation, not to mention the world. [Those
dollars have helped develop]{.underline} countless [drugs,]{.underline}
and a wide assortment of [military]{.underline} and domestic machinery,
[and]{.underline} they have [paid the salaries of millions of
researchers.]{.underline} Those dollars have saved people and helped
industrialize nations the world over. American scientific research has
also influenced policymaking. This is where the tie to democracy matters
most: [evidence-based policymaking allows the largest number of people
in the country to be healthy, be safe and have a voice. This is what
cutbacks to science threaten]{.underline}. This is how Trump
administration--sponsored research into questions that have basically
been answered, because officials don't like the answer, threatens the
ability of all Americans to thrive. When Secretary of Health and Human
Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., says the nation will know by the end of
the summer what environmental factors cause autism and calls for the
private medical records of autistic people as part of this push, this is
a fishing expedition. Kennedy doesn't like the answers that we already
have---vaccines do not cause autism, and genetics influences the
development of autism---so he wastes taxpayer money. Recently, a group
of scientists from all over the world earned Breakthrough Prize for the
work they did at CERN, a multinational facility that tests fundamental
ideas in physics. [With cuts to science funding, what will happen
to]{.underline} projects like this, [plans to improve our Antarctic
field stations,]{.underline} and efforts like the evidence-driven Paris
climate agreement? Such ideas underpin our grasp of the natural world
and probe the technologies the U.S. needs. [Scuttling science and
shutting doors on the world will leave us in the dark. Domination will
doom us to failure.]{.underline}

damage]{.underline}** because of unintended consequences of their policy

but plausible-sounding, analogy between the risks of nuclear power
plants and nuclear bombs -- turned public opinion against nuclear power
and thereby induced much greater use of coal over the last 50 or so
years (Shellenberger (2020, chapter 8)). The substitution of coal for
nuclear power shortened millions of lives (due to greater air pollution)
and led to higher CO2 emissions than would have otherwise occurred.

These unintended consequences of the anti-nuclear-power narrative should

• advocates aggressive near-term suppression of fossil-fuel use without
considering the huge costs that such suppression would inflict on
humans.

• lacks a realistic sense of proportion about the risks/costs from
continued global warming, which are manageable, not existential.

This paper details the flaws in the Apocalyptic climate narrative,
including why the threat from humancaused climate change is not dire and
why urgent suppression of fossil-fuel use would be unwise. We argue that
sensible public policies would focus instead on developing a diversified
portfolio of energy sources to support greater resilience and
flexibility to respond to whatever weather and climate extremes that
might occur. We identify nine principles for sensible U.S. public
policies toward energy and discuss implications of the flaws in the
narrative for investors and their agents.

2\. Is global warming dangerous?

[Hypothesized]{.underline} damaging **[consequences]{.underline}** of
global warming [include]{.underline} (i) [loss of **life**]{.underline}
from greater intensity and frequency of heat waves, hurricanes, floods,
droughts, and wildfires [and]{.underline} (ii)
**[economic]{.underline}** [losses from]{.underline} such
[extreme-weather events and from sea-level rise due to
melting]{.underline} polar [**ice caps**. Assessments of the impact
from]{.underline} **[human-caused warming]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[complicated]{.underline}** [by the difficulty of
determining the extent to which **[observed]{.mark}** temperature
[increases are]{.mark}]{.underline} **[caused]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} **[[natural]{.underline}]{.mark}** climate
**[variability]{.underline}** -- a difficulty that adds to the
uncertainty in estimates of how much human-caused warming to expect over
the 21st century.

Warming over the past 120 years

[The question of whether]{.underline} global [warming is]{.underline}
**[dangerous]{.underline}** (**[whatever]{.underline}** [its
cause]{.underline}) [can be addressed by examining the]{.underline}
**[behavior]{.underline}** [of the climate]{.underline}
[[since]{.underline}]{.mark} **[before]{.underline}** the time **[human
activity]{.underline}** [generated large]{.underline} amounts of
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse **[g]{.underline}**as
[emissions. Human-caused global warming is typically measured with
reference to [pre-industrial times]{.mark}]{.underline}; for practical
reasons in terms of the availability of data, the usual approach employs
a baseline period in the late 19th century. Since the late 19th century,
Earth's average temperature has increased by about 1.3o C (2.3o F).
[During the **same period**]{.underline}, average global sea level has
risen 8-9 inches, and [[there has been]{.underline}]{.mark} little or
**[[no]{.mark} detectable [change]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} most types of **[[extreme
weather]{.underline}]{.mark}** events when [measured against
the]{.underline} **[background]{.underline}** of natural weather and
climate variability.

Since the late 19th century, with 1.3o C of global warming, [humanity
has seen]{.underline} **[unprecedented increases]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} **[prosperity]{.underline}** and well-being. Global
population has increased from about 1.6 billion in 1900 to 8.2 billion
people in 2024. In 1900, the global average lifespan was 34 years; in
2024 the global average lifespan more than doubled to 73 years. From
1961 to 2020, global agricultural output nearly quadrupled, with a 53%
increase in per capita output despite a 2.6-fold increase in global
population.

Since the early 1900s, [[per capita]{.underline}
**[mortality]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from]{.underline}
**[hurricanes]{.underline}**, **[floods]{.underline}**,
**[droughts]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
wild**[fires]{.underline}** has **[[decreased]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by
almost]{.underline} **[[98%]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Koonin (2021, page
170)). [These]{.underline} favorable **[[trends]{.underline}]{.mark}**
in weather- and climate-related mortality rates [[reveal]{.mark} that
[the world is]{.mark} now]{.underline} **[much
[better]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[at]{.underline} **[preventing
deaths]{.underline}** [from]{.underline}]{.mark} extreme weather and
**[[climate]{.mark} events]{.underline}** than it was a century ago.
[The sharp reduction in]{.underline} **[death]{.underline}** rates [has
been]{.underline} **[accomplished]{.underline}**
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} **[greater [wealth]{.mark}]{.underline}**
([driven by]{.underline} **[energy]{.underline}** derived
[[from]{.underline} **[fossil fuels]{.underline}**]{.mark}), [which
provides better infrastructure, superior advance-warning technologies,
and greater capacity to recover from weather-related
disasters.]{.underline}

Although the role of higher temperatures and atmospheric CO2
concentrations in these favorable changes in mortality rates is open to
debate, two aspects of the increases are unambiguously beneficial.
First, [**[sat]{.mark}**ellite observation**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}
since the 1980s [[indicate]{.underline}]{.mark} **[widespread
[greening]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of the planet. The satellite data show
that, over the last two decades, Earth has **increased**]{.underline}
[its]{.underline} **[green leaf area]{.underline}** [by
approximately]{.underline} **[5%]{.underline}**. [[This]{.mark} greening
[reflects]{.mark}]{.underline} [**increased [CO2
fertilization]{.mark}**, warmer]{.underline} [**temperatures**,
and]{.underline} **[more rainfall]{.underline}** (Chen et al. (2024)).

The second aspect relates to heat and cold extremes. An unambiguous
consequence of global warming is more frequent heat extremes, coupled
with less frequent cold extremes. It is well known that mortality is
substantially greater (almost a factor of 10) for extreme cold than for
extreme heat (Zhao et al. (2021). Consequently, [[rising
**temp**]{.mark}erature[**s** are associated with]{.mark} a **[net
saving]{.mark}** of **[lives]{.mark}** owing to the **reduction of
mortality** from]{.underline} extreme [**cold events**.
**[Heat]{.mark}**-related [mortality is]{.mark}]{.underline} also
**[[declining]{.mark} over time]{.underline}** (O'Neill et al. (2021)),
[owing to]{.underline} general [improvements in]{.underline} **[health
care]{.underline}** systems, [increasing prevalence of]{.underline}
residential **[a]{.underline}**ir **[c]{.underline}**onditioning, and
behavioral changes -- [factors that have dominated]{.underline} **[any
impact]{.underline}** [of a warmer planet on the risk of heat-related
death.]{.underline}

[Although [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[dollar value]{.underline}** [of
damages]{.underline}]{.mark} [from extreme weather events
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} now [greater than]{.underline} it was many
[decades ago, this]{.underline} increase [is [the result of]{.mark}
increasing]{.underline} vulnerability and [**[exposure]{.mark}**
associated [with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[greater
population]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} concentration of
[**[wealth]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[coastal]{.underline}**]{.mark} and other disaster-prone
**[[regions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [A recent analysis **summarizing
[many studies find]{.mark}**s]{.underline} **[[no
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to support claims [that]{.mark} **any
part**]{.underline} [of the overall increase in]{.underline} global
[**[econ]{.mark}**omic **[losses]{.mark}**]{.underline} from weather and
climate disasters [can be **[attribute]{.mark}**d
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} global **[[warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Pielke (2020, 2023)).

Prospective warming over the 21st century

[What about]{.underline} warming over [the]{.underline}
**[rest]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline} 21st
**[century?]{.underline}** [Is there reason to expect **dire
consequences for humanity** going forward in time**?**]{.underline}

[The Apocalyptic climate narrative and the most extreme impacts are
driven by]{.underline} **[extreme emissions scenarios]{.underline}**,
with 4-5o C of warming by 2100 (above a baseline in the late 19th
century). [However]{.underline}, since 2021, [[the **UN**]{.mark}'s
climate **negotiators**]{.underline} [have]{.underline} **[[abandoned
extreme]{.underline}]{.mark}** emissions [**[scenarios]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline} **[unrealistic]{.underline}**]{.mark} for two reasons.
First, [they make]{.underline} **[unrealistic
assumptions]{.underline}**, especially [about]{.underline}
**[coal]{.underline}** use. Second, [**[actual]{.underline}**
[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark} [have been
[tracking]{.mark}]{.underline} **[well [below]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[their most extreme]{.underline} emission [scenario, and
indeed]{.underline} slightly [below their]{.underline}
**[medium]{.underline}** emissions [scenario]{.underline}. The UN is now
working with an estimated year 2100 warming of 2.5°C (UNFCCC (2022)),
while the IEA Roadmap to NetZero projects 2.4°C of warming by 2100 (IEA
(2023)). [When]{.underline} **[plausible scenarios]{.underline}** of
natural climate variability and values of climate sensitivity on the
lower end of the UN's IPCC likely range [are considered]{.underline},
the [expected]{.underline} **[warming]{.underline}** [could
be]{.underline} **[significantly lower]{.underline}** (Lee et al.
(2021)).

If we work with 2.5°C projected warming by 2100, more than half (1.3°C)
of the predicted increase in temperature has already occurred. There are
good reasons to expect continued advances in prosperity and well-being
over the remainder of the 21st century -- and ample reasons such as AI
to expect such advances to accelerate. Moreover, [[the]{.mark} so-called
**[threshold]{.mark}**]{.underline} of danger [of]{.underline}
**[2]{.underline}**o **[C]{.underline}** warming since pre-industrial
times [[is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}**]{.mark} [an]{.underline}
**[[objective]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}** of danger.
[[Rather]{.underline}]{.mark}, 2o C is a **[[political]{.mark}ly
negotiated target]{.underline}** [designed [to
**motivate**]{.mark}]{.underline} broadbased
**[[action]{.underline}]{.mark}**s to reduce emissions (Curry (2023,
page 9)).

Importantly, [[there is]{.underline} **[no credible case]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} **[missing]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the]{.underline}
2o C [target would [pose]{.mark} an]{.underline} **[[ex]{.mark}istential
[risk]{.mark}]{.underline}** to humanity. [[Humans have]{.underline}
**[adapted]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[to]{.underline}**
[(and]{.underline} **[thrived]{.underline}** [in)]{.underline} climates
[extremes]{.underline} **[far worse]{.underline}** [than]{.underline} in
[the **pessimistic extreme scenario**, [as]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[summertime residents of [Phoenix]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[wintertime residents of Minneapolis]{.underline}**
[[demonstrate]{.underline} **[every year]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Two other risk-related points are relevant here. First, a basic
assumption in the socioeconomic scenarios used in formulating the UN
climate-assessment reports is that vulnerability to weather and climate
extremes decreases with greater wealth and economic development, as
adaptive capacity increases. All of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
(SSPs) scenarios constructed for the most recent UN climate assessment
entail dramatic growth, with global GDP in 2100 between four and ten
times larger than in 2010 (Dellink et al. (2017)). These scenarios do
not imply any futures for humanity that are worse than today.

Second, risks from human-caused global warming are difficult to separate
credibly from natural weather and climate variability and the risks are
dominated by the vulnerabilities of less-developed countries and poorer
populations generally. Increasing wealth and productivity will continue
to reduce humanity's vulnerability to weather- and climate-related
risks.

Tipping points and surprises

**[Uncertainty]{.underline}** about the impact on humans of continued
use of fossil fuels [is]{.underline} **[dominated]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} the difficulties of estimating the likelihood of
catastrophic outcomes from climate **[tipping points]{.underline}** that
could cause severe and possibly irreversible damage.

Climate tipping points are defined as abrupt or nonlinear transitions to
a different climate state, which are hypothesized to occur once some
threshold has been crossed, with regional or global consequences that
are largely uncontrollable and beyond our management. In other words,
tipping points are points of no return, at least on the century
timescale. In recent geologic history, abrupt climate change has been
caused by changes in ocean circulation patterns and ice-sheet dynamics,
including (i) the Younger Dryas (12,900- 11,700 years ago) when global
temperatures dropped by up to 15o C in some regions, (ii) an unnamed
sudden cooling event that occurred around 8,200 years ago and that
lasted about 150 years, and (iii) the DansgaardOeschger Events
(115,000-11,500 years ago) with a series of abrupt warmings and cooling
during the last Ice Age with temperature shifts of 5-10o C occurring
within decades.

The IPCC Assessment Reports have considered a number of potential
tipping points associated with global warming, including ice-sheet
collapse, collapse of the Atlantic Overturning Circulation, carbon
release from permafrost thawing, and destruction of the Amazon
rainforest and coral reefs. There are some preliminary climate model
simulations for some of these conjectured tipping points. However,
climate models do not include the appropriate physical, chemical, and
biological processes to adequately simulate such events. Hence, these
hypothesized climate tipping points have been based largely upon the
consideration of imperfect analogues from the geologic past, process
models, and physically based storylines.

[The]{.underline} [**[likelihood]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
any of the above types of [hypothesized **[tipping points]{.mark}**
occurring in the]{.underline} 21st **[century]{.underline}**
[under]{.underline} the **[medium emissions]{.underline}** scenario
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[generally regarded]{.underline}**
[as]{.underline} **[[low]{.underline}]{.mark}**, although there is also
low confidence in any conclusions surrounding possible tipping points
owing to deep (Knightian) uncertainties in our understanding of the
complex climate system.

Could something genuinely catastrophic happen to the climate on the
timescale of the 21st century? Yes, although continued use of fossil
fuels is not the only possible cause. For example, a climate catastrophe
could also be caused by nuclear war, a series of explosive volcanic
eruptions, natural shifts in ocean circulation patterns, and/or shifts
in ice-sheet dynamics driven by geologic processes.

[It is impossible to remove]{.underline} **[all]{.underline}** sources
of [climate]{.underline}-related [risk, and it would be]{.underline}
**[unwise]{.underline}** [to attempt to try [to
avert]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[low probability]{.underline}**]{.mark}
climate **[[catastrophes]{.underline}]{.mark}** [with policy actions
that [would]{.mark}]{.underline} themselves surely [[impose]{.underline}
**[massive]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[near-term
[costs]{.mark}]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}
**[humanity]{.underline}**. There is no doubt that aggressive near-term
suppression of fossil-fuel use would impose significant costs on humans
until such time as viable replacements for fossil fuels were found for
the roles they play in the production of food, steel, cement, and
plastics.

The critical implication: In terms of rational risk management, there is
no case for policies that would suppress fossil-fuel use aggressively
simply because something bad might happen. For such suppression to be
rational, we should have good reason to think that the low probability
climate catastrophe we would avoid would be far worse than the
catastrophe we would surely induce by moving aggressively to net zero.
We have yet to see anyone provide credible support for the latter
argument.

3\. Fossil-fuel suppression: Shooting ourselves in the foot The
Apocalyptic climate narrative incorrectly portrays CO2 emissions as
inherently and unequivocally dangerous and an economic "bad" i.e., a
purely negative externality. This portrayal ignores the fact that CO2
yields direct benefits (e.g., it is plant food) and the inarguable
technological reality that fossil fuels are currently irreplaceable
inputs for producing food (via ammonia-based fertilizer), steel, cement,
and plastics (Smil (2022, chapter 3), Gates (2022, chapter 3)), which
are central features of modern life. The last 150 years have seen an
enormous increase in human welfare that occurred to a large degree
because of the use of fossil fuels for electricity, transportation,
agriculture, and the material inputs for manufacturing and
infrastructure construction. Fossil fuels have enabled huge advances in
medicine, food production, communications, computing, ground and air
travel, and much more. They have enabled billions of people to have
lives of much higher quality, longer length, and generally greater
material abundance than our ancestors -- most of whom lived on the
Malthusian margin of survival. The 2015 Paris climate agreement set a
goal of "net-zero" global emissions (a balance between greenhousegas
emissions and offsetting emission removals) by 2050, which as a
practical matter targets a drastic reduction in fossil-fuel use over the
next 25 years. By 2024, 107 countries had adopted net-zero pledges. The
U.S. entered the agreement under President Obama, exited under President
Trump, re-entered under President Biden, and is in the process of
exiting again under President Trump's second administration. The problem
with the Paris agreement is its urgent timeline for abandoning fossil
fuels before we have viable replacements for the energy they provide and
the myriad other roles they play in creating products that benefit
humanity. As Vaclav Smil (2020) bluntly put it: Designing hypothetical
roadmaps outlining complete elimination of fossil carbon from the global
energy supply by 2050 is nothing but an exercise in wishful thinking
that ignores fundamental physical realities. Failure of net-zero
policies After the Paris agreement, atmospheric CO2 concentrations
increased 5.0% from 401 ppm in 2015 to 421 ppm in 2023. Global emissions
from burning fossil fuels increased 6.6% from 34.7 billion metric tons
in 2015 to 37 billion metric tons in 2023. Today, the world is far from
reaching the net-zero emissions target and the post-Paris emissions
trend is away from target. In recent years, the world has spent enormous
amounts on clean energy in the hope of curtailing fossil-fuel use. In
every year since 2015, outlays on clean energy have been \$1 trillion or
more, with outlays for 2024 on track to reach \$2 trillion (IEA (2024)).
These efforts have succeeded in slightly lowering the percent of global
energy from fossil fuels, but they have done so by expanding other
sources of energy -- notably solar and wind -- and not by reducing
fossil-fuel use. Today, the world gets 81% of its energy from fossil
fuels, down slightly from 82.8% in 2010 and 81.2% in 2000. In absolute
terms, global use of oil, natural gas, and coal have all increased.
Although a decade of government subsidies of electric vehicles has led
to less oil usage than would otherwise have occurred, absolute
consumption of gasoline is now at a record high. In public discourse,
capitalism and democracy are sometimes unfairly blamed for increasing
emissions and the failure of net-zero policies. China has strong
elements of a government-planned rather than capitalist economy and no
reasonable observer would mistake it for a democracy. Yet China is the
world's largest greenhouse-gas emitter. Fossil-fuel firms are also
portrayed as the root cause of global warming. If humans did not desire
the products made with fossil fuels, there would be no firms producing
such products. Consumption demand by individual human beings is the root
cause of fossil-fuel use and greenhouse-gas emissions. Net-zero policies
are failing because they do not deal with this fundamental reality. A
variety of underlying economic and political considerations have played
roles in the failure of the netzero policies embraced by many of the
world's governments. Most obviously, government subsidies have induced a
greater supply of solar- and wind-generated energy, but a range of
technical and political issues have hampered the widespread deployment
of these clean-energy sources. Governments could motivate reductions in
fossil fuels by enacting carbon taxes, which would penalize activities
in proportion to the emissions they cause. However, proposals to enact
such taxes have been very unpopular, especially in the U.S., and thus
have gained virtually no political traction. Although many people say
they are concerned about global warming, there is widespread resistance
among the U.S. electorate to paying for climate-related actions. Voters'
resistance to a carbon tax would be especially difficult to overcome
once they have a realistic understanding of its limited climate impact.
If the U.S. hypothetically cut its greenhouse-gas emissions to zero
today, there would be no reliably detectable effect on Earth's weather
or climate over the 21st century. If we accept the climate model
projections of 1.2o C or maybe 1.3o C additional warming over the rest
of the 21st century, U.S. annual emissions of about 13% of the world's
total would contribute less than 0.2o C of warming over the next 75
years. It would be a very tough sell to convince U.S. voters to incur
massively higher tax bills for a small reduction in the warming trend.
It would be especially tough to make that sale when China, India, and
many other countries are continuing to emit greenhouse gases at
prodigious rates. These problems with clean-energy subsidies and carbon
taxes have led U.S. and European governments to attempt to address
global warming through a variety of other tactics such as mandates,
quotas, prohibitions, and regulations on specific products and
activities because of their carbon footprint. These tactics include
mandating electric-vehicle production through setting caps on total
product-line emissions for automobile firms; outlawing the use of gas
stoves; controlling the supply of fossil fuels by regulatory
restrictions on permits for production; canceling oil and gas pipelines;
lobbying pension funds, university endowment funds and other such
organizations to divest their investment holdings of fossil-fuel firms;
and use of regulatory pressure to discourage banks and other financial
institutions from making loans to support investment in fossil-fuel
projects, both in the U.S. around the world. These tactics have been
adopted because of the urge to "do something" about a potential problem
and because few people recognize that these actions will have negligible
impact on global warming. Geopolitical concerns about fossil-fuel
suppression Another political impediment to suppression of fossil-fuel
use is that it would weaken our national security position by impeding
reliable access to large amounts of energy. China, Russia, and Iran may
say they will eventually reduce carbon emissions, but their incentives
to do otherwise are obvious. All three countries will be stronger in
military and economic terms by continuing to exploit their use of fossil
fuels. The lessons of history indicate that we ignore at our peril the
national security dimensions of energy policy. Consider, for example,
what Daniel Yergin (2008) says about World War II in "The Prize," his
Pulitzerprize winning history of oil (with italics added for emphasis):
"Petroleum was central to the course and outcome of World War II in both
the Far East and Europe. The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor to protect
their flank as they grabbed for the petroleum resources of the East
Indies. Among Hitler's most important strategic objectives in the
invasion of the Soviet Union was the capture of the oil fields in the
Caucasus. But America's predominance in oil proved decisive and by the
end of the war German and Japanese fuel tanks were empty." Moral
concerns about fossil-fuel suppression Aggressive suppression of
fossil-fuel use would be morally unconscionable under any reasonable
ethical code, as it would impose costs on the more than 3 billion people
who have virtually no access to electricity. This large swath of
humanity would like access to abundant, cheap, and reliable
fossil-fuel-based energy to help lift themselves out of poverty and to
reduce the substantial health risk from long-term exposure to airborne
particulate matter caused by indoor burning of dung and wood. There are
now more than 6 billion people who would like to live in ways that most
of us in wealthy countries take for granted, with abundant and reliable
energy that few of us would willingly give up to any degree. The
ostensible urgency of attaining net-zero is seriously hampering progress
towards the UN's Sustainable Development goals of no poverty, no hunger,
affordable and clean energy, and the development of industry,
innovation, and infrastructure. International funds earmarked to aid
less developed countries are being directed away from efforts to reduce
poverty, and toward emission reductions, particularly in Africa. Hunger
eradication has been made more difficult by climate-mitigation efforts,
including (1) restrictions on livestock and fertilizer; (2) impediments
to the development of industry and infrastructure that require steel and
cement, which currently require fossil fuelsfor production; and (3)
continued emphasis on biofuels (because they are renewable and despite
their greenhouse-gas emissions). Other economic, technological, and
social impediments to fossil-fuel suppression Countries that have taken
the lead in the movement toward net-zero have had disappointing track
records, which discourages others from following their lead. For
example, widespread implementation of government-subsidized solar and
wind power has led to increased energy costs in the U.K. and Germany,
contributing to a domestic industrial decline. In 2022, Sri Lanka
experienced a dramatic drop in crop yields and food shortages after the
government banned fossil-fuel-based fertilizers, which led to social
unrest that was so serious that the president and his wife fled the
country. The broader problem is that many of the technologies needed for
net-zero either do not exist or are still in the demonstration or
prototype phase. Substantial innovation and investment is needed to
scale prototypes to be efficient and affordable for users. For solar and
wind, the needs are acute. At present, there is nothing close to viable
energy storage (batteries) available at scale to address the fact that
these sources provide no power absent sunshine and wind. Also needed are
large investments in transmission grids -- not just to move power to
locations far from rural points of origination, but also to accommodate
the asynchronicity of power from wind, solar, and batteries. These
impediments to net-zero are compounded by concerns about the enormous
amounts of materials needed for solar, wind, and battery infrastructure
changes, along with significant environmental impacts from mining of
inputs needed for their production. A closely related impediment is that
the huge land requirements for solar and wind farms are fostering
conflicts with both environmentalists and residents of rural areas about
issues of aesthetics, ecosystem impacts, and competing economic uses for
the land. Bad energy choices Bad choices about future energy systems are
a damaging consequence of the false sense of urgency that the
Apocalyptic climate narrative has created about suppressing fossil-fuel
use. That urgency effectively dictates that existing technologies like
solar and wind must replace fossil fuels. However, overcoming the low
power quality, intermittency, and synchronicity problems of solar and
wind power remains an ongoing challenge that may not ever be solved in a
cost-effective way. The technological reality is that solar and wind are
far inferior to fossil fuels for producing energy at the needed scale
and, at present, they are incapable of producing many of the materials
that are responsible for the lives of remarkable abundance available to
people who live in advanced industrial economies. The unfortunate result
is to distract attention from the potential role of more advanced energy
technologies that are under development and that are expected to provide
better medium- and long-term solutions than solar and wind. The issue is
not if, but when, more advanced energy technologies will emerge as
practical and economically viable at scale. Meanwhile, human flourishing
today requires enormous amounts of lowcost energy. That energy can come
only from the technologies and systems that we know how to build right
now, which are mainly fossil-fuel-based. Attempts to suppress
fossil-fuel use aggressively are therefore socially destructive in that
they would impose significant avoidable costs on humanity. Ever-growing
demand for energy All of these impediments to net-zero exist against the
backdrop of ever-growing demand for energy. There is huge pent-up demand
from developing nations, many of which are mired in energy poverty and
whose billions of citizens would like to lead lives with power access
that is commonplace in wealthy countries. There is a remarkable degree
of self-absorption among net-zero advocates in wealthy nations who
personally have ample access to energy and who feel comfortable arguing
that people in developed countries should exercise energy and material
restraint to slow down global warming when the climate impact of such
restraint will almost surely be undetectable. Greater access to
electricity can help reduce our vulnerability to weather and climate
through air conditioners, water desalination plants, irrigation,
vertical farming operations, water pumps, coastal defenses, and
environmental monitoring systems. And ever-growing amounts of
electricity will be needed for humans to be able to capture the benefits
from innovations in advanced materials, manufacturing, artificial
intelligence, robotics, photonics, quantum computing, blockchain,
electronics, and other economic arenas that are currently unforeseen or
unimagined. There is good reason to fear a future without cheap,
abundant fuel and the continued economic expansion that it fosters far
more than to fear planetary warming from the use of fossil fuels.
Degrading our energy supply by suppressing fossil fuels and forcing a
move to wind and solar will restrict the lifeblood of modern society.
Since there is no credible case of an impending Apocalypse from
continued use of fossil fuels, we would be shooting ourselves in the
foot by urgently suppressing their use. 4. Rational energy policy for
the 21st century Although fossil fuels have played a critical role in
generating enormous gains for humanity, there are good reasons for
seeking ways to reduce our reliance on them, including geopolitical
concerns, environmental degradation, and increasing costs of extraction.
What then makes sense for public policies to foster development of more
abundant, secure, inexpensive, and clean energy? The foundation of any
reasonable approach should be: First, do no harm. That means abandoning
the Apocalyptic climate narrative's prescription of aggressively
suppressing fossil-fuel use to attain net-zero CO2 emissions in the
near-term. We should build on that foundation by (i) recognizing that
human flourishing requires abundant and everincreasing energy, (ii)
pursuing research into a broad range of alternatives to fossil fuels as
energy sources and as material inputs to production (e.g., as with
fertilizer and plastics), (iii) approaching the next 25 years (and
perhaps longer) as a learning period grounded in intelligent trial and
error, and (iv) evaluating all technologies holistically for abundance,
reliability, costs calculated on an "all-in" lifecycle basis, sensible
land and resource use, air-quality impact, and environmental impact
generally. Implications for public energy policies We offer nine
principles for operationalizing this approach to U.S. energy policies,
with #3, #5, and #6 specifying actions we should take and the remainder
highlighting what we should not do. 1. We should not inflict costs on
U.S. citizens -- reduced overall economic prosperity, constrained
individual choice, and diminished national security -- by adopting
public policies intended to mitigate global warming that will not
detectably affect Earth's temperature in the short or long run. 2. We
should not eliminate fossil fuels before we have technologically viable
and cost-effective replacements for the critical inputs they provide in
the production of food, steel, cement, plastics, and electricity. 3. We
should use "carrots" to foster investment in innovation in energy,
materials science, and agricultural science, as well as in the ability
of humans to adapt to a changing climate. 4. We should not use "sticks"
to punish consumption that generates greenhouse gasses (e.g., banning
gas stoves, jet travel, internal combustion engines, and non-vegan
food), while having no material effect on temperatures now or in the
long run. 5. We should cultivate clean energy (to reduce air pollution)
and energy independence (for national defense and economic security
reasons) with a diversified set of reliable energy sources to hedge the
risks of adverse "unknown unknowns" in the evolution of our political,
economic, and physical environments. 6. We should put major emphasis on
the resuscitation (and refined development) of nuclear power, which is
at least as safe as solar and wind and far safer than coal and oil
(based on comparisons of death rates due to both accidents and air
pollution per unit of electricity generated). 7. We should not focus
narrowly on solar panels, wind turbines, and biofuels. Solar and wind
are problematic because of their (i) unreliability and consequent need
for a stand-by power system, (ii) low energy density and consequent
massive land requirements to deliver energy at scale, and (iii) negative
externalities (e.g., from rare-earth mining to produce batteries to
address the unreliability problem). Biofuel emissions are at least as
bad as gasoline, while biofuel production uses massive amounts of
cropland and played a significant role in three major food crises in the
last 20 years. 8. We should not engage in backdoor regulation of
fossil-fuel use by the Federal Reserve (through bank oversight) and the
SEC (through ESG empowerment) that will warp the allocation of
investment capital. 9. We should not use our power to impose credit
policies toward developing countries (e.g., by the World Bank) that
discourage fossil-fuel-based projects and thereby make it more difficult
for world's poorest people to elevate themselves out of poverty. The
three proactive principles (#3, #5, and #6) reflect the physical reality
that human flourishing depends critically on the abundant availability
of energy and on the currently irreplaceable role that fossil fuels play
in the production of food, steel, cement and plastics. Deterrent
principle #7, which cautions against a narrow focus on solar, wind, and
biofuels, reflects the strong technological limits of these
technologies. The remaining deterrent principles (#1, #2, #4, #8, and
#9) reflect the fact that it makes no sense to mandate or constrain
choices that will cause humanity to bear costs when those choices will
have no detectable effect on global warming in the short- or long-run.
These costs have a direct component: Avoidable waste from outlays on
unpromising technologies and on consumption goods that simply sound good
from a carbon emissions perspective. They also have an opportunity cost
component in terms of diverting resources from worthwhile causes,
including investments to foster greater resilience to weather and
climate extremes as well as to help wide swaths of humanity to elevate
themselves out of poverty. Implications for investors and their agents
The flaws in the Apocalyptic climate narrative have three important
implications for the risk-management decisions of private investors and
for the corporate directors and money managers who work on their behalf.
• The actual risks of fossil-fuel-generated climate change are not
nearly as great as portrayed in the drumbeat of worried discussions of
global warming in public discourse that the Apocalyptic climate
narrative has fostered. • Those who nonetheless want to do something to
help mitigate global warming should realize that the long-run
consequences for the planet of the ESG pursuit of a reduced corporate
carbon footprint will do little, if anything, to change the climate over
the course of the 21st century. • The Apocalyptic climate narrative is
itself an element of investment risk. The narrative has gained such
powerful traction -- especially in the U.S. and other wealthy countries
-- that it is significantly affecting the allocation of real resources
and the stock-market values of companies. The latter traction creates
upside investment potential and downside risk. The upside, of course, is
the potential for profits by responding to the demand for green
investments. The downside risk is the possibility that many people will
eventually come to realize that the importance of suppressing
fossil-fuel use has been blown far out of proportion in public
discourse. From a capital markets perspective, the current
green-investment situation accordingly has elements of a stock-price
bubble that is supported by a false narrative. One can expect that
bubble to sustain or grow provided that many people continue to buy into
the premise of an urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels and
as governments add more subsidies to renewable-energy projects. The
danger is that the bubble will pop or dissolve as it becomes
increasingly clear that the Apocalyptic climate narrative is an
extremely effective form of environmentalist propaganda that markedly
overstates the risks to humanity of continued global warming. One might
be tempted to take investment positions that effectively "short the
bubble" and wait for the gains to come rolling in when the bubble pops
or dissolves. The problem with such strategies is that substantial
valuation errors in the capital market can take a long time to correct.
Consequently, arbitrageurs who have finite capital to invest and who
make strong bets against the bubble can be wiped out financially before
the asset-pricing errors are corrected. The upshot is that there is no
clear path to a "free lunch" of abnormal investment performance from
shorting green investments. The reason is that one simply cannot be sure
about whether or when the world will come to broad recognition of the
flaws in the narrative.

What would happen [if the **[U.S.]{.mark}** enforced]{.underline} a

yes because humanity (ostensibly) faces an existential threat from

### 2NC \-\-- Science Diplomacy Impossible

#### Current Geopolitical challenges make mobility for science diplomacy difficult- numbers of talents are severely decreasing

**The Royal Society 25**, The Royal Society is defined by the principles
of open, transparent, decision making based on scientific evidence. The
freedom of researchers to follow the scientific evidence is a key pillar
of progress and where it is threatened, we put at risk the development
and use of science for the benefit of humanity., "Science diplomacy in
an era of disruption," February 2025,

[Environmental challenges]{.underline} such as climate change,
pollution, biodiversity loss, and infectious diseases [have overall
worsened.]{.underline} More than eight billion people are indelibly
impacting the planet and the many other species with which we share it.
Carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels are driving climate change
and ocean acidification. Chemical waste is poisoning ecosystems on land
and in the air and water. Biodiversity is diminishing, as the worsening
quality of many environments and rapid changes to others are causing the
extinction of vulnerable species across the planet. As the COVID-19
pandemic demonstrated, growing human populations, living closely with
other species, are becoming more vulnerable to emerging infectious
diseases. The widespread use of air travel means these can spread across
the world at extraordinary speed. Global warming is enabling the spread
of insect vector-borne infections, hitherto limited to tropical regions.
Widespread antibiotic resistance is allowing 'traditional' infections to
re-emerge with deadly potential. All the while, noncommunicable
diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and ageing-related neurodegenerative
diseases, are also putting increasing pressure on societies around the
globe. [There is a greater need than ever for scientists to understand
these rapidly unfolding and worsening problems through scientific
research,]{.underline} and to help identify potential solutions,
including potential new policy options for international policymakers to
consider[. Indeed, the pandemic demonstrated well the potential of
science diplomacy in a crisis -- notably]{.underline}, in the
internationally collaborative efforts to understand the virus, track its
spread, and develop a vaccine26. [This period was characterised by data
sharing and mutual learning]{.underline} by scientific advisers and
[governments around the world. It also underscored the limits of
cooperation]{.underline} in a global pandemic emergency, as national
governments competed over the supplies of protective equipment, and the
equitable distribution of vaccines proved difficult, despite initiatives
such as the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access
(COVAX) programme. [Indeed, the experience of some lower- and
middleincome countries in being unable to access key technologies and
products undermined trust]{.underline}, negatively impacted
international relations[, and has led to calls for the reform of
intellectual property]{.underline} (IP) protection regimes and for
greater representation in setting global norms. [The world also faces a
growing number of demographic challenges. In wealthier
countries,]{.underline} endogenous [population growth has
slowed]{.underline} or ceased. In many of these countries, [as a
result]{.underline} of increased average human longevity associated with
improvements in public health, [the population of young people is
declining faster]{.underline} than the growth in the population of older
people.. This raises important questions about who will provide and pay
for the health care, retirement needs, and pensions of older people. [In
stark contrast, in many lower]{.underline}- and middleincome
[countries]{.underline} facing persistent poverty, inequality, and
environmental challenges, [population growth continues
apace.]{.underline} In addition to being one of our world's greatest
challenges, this also involves a demographic element. [When younger
people face poverty,]{.underline} food shortages, political unrest, and
greater competition for jobs, [those who have the ability to do so may
migrate to countries]{.underline} which appear to have better economic
prospects and a safer environment, [but where they are often met with
suspicion,]{.underline} resistance, and hostility. [When restrictions on
migration are implemented in response to political demand, this can
sometimes adversely impact science, as the mobility of scientific talent
may then also be impacted]{.underline} (whether intentionally or not)27.

#### Spending Cuts to research makes irreversible affects to research

Jeff **Tollefson et al. 25**, Jeff Tollefson has written about climate
and environmental issues for Nature Magazine since 2007. His work has
focused on earth sciences and technology as well as economics, politics
and global development. "Will US science survive Trump 2.0?," Nature,
April 29, 2025, https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01295-6

[In just the first three months]{.underline} of his second term, US
[President]{.underline} [Donald Trump has destabilized eight decades of
government support for science.]{.underline} His administration has
[fired thousands of government scientists]{.underline}, bringing large
swathes of the country's research to a standstill [and halting many
clinical trials.]{.underline} It has threatened to slash billions in
funding from US research universities and has terminated more than 1,000
grants in areas such as climate change, cancer, Alzheimer's disease and
HIV prevention.

This looks likely to be just the beginning. [Congress approved a budget
bill on 10 April that could lay the groundwork for massive spending cuts
over the coming decade.]{.underline} [The White House is expected to
propose a budget]{.underline} for 2026 [that would slash
investments]{.underline} in science across the federal government; [for
example]{.underline}, the Trump administration is considering [cutting
the science budget for NASA nearly in half and]{.underline} spending at
the National Institutes of Health [(NIH) by 40%.]{.underline} The
administration has also begun implementing strict immigration measures
that have left some students and researchers in detention centres, and
many academics fear that these and future measures could spur
researchers to look for opportunities outside the United States.

[The dismantling of scientific institutions and of much of the research
ecosystem has led increasing numbers of people inside and outside
research to wonder how science will survive Trump]{.underline}. In
March, some 1,900 members of the US National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine, which represent the country's leading
scientists, published an open letter, declaring: "We are sending this
SOS to sound a clear warning: the nation's scientific enterprise is
being decimated."

In a survey of Nature readers in April, [94% of nearly 1,600 respondents
said they are worried about the future of science in the
country.]{.underline} And the same proportion said the Trump
administration's science policies will have negative effects on the
world. Although the poll did not include a statistically representative
sample, it presents a window onto the concerns of a broad array of
researchers (see 'Trump effects').

[Damage caused by the Trump administration]{.underline}, science-policy
experts warn, [could set the United States back for decades. "So many of
the damaging impacts are going to be extremely difficult to reverse and
are going to take a very long time to recover from,"]{.underline} says
John Holdren, a science adviser to former US president Barack Obama who
is now a science-policy specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School in
Cambridge, Massachusetts.

### 2NC \-- No Warming !

**Warming doesn't cause extinction**

**Ord 20** (Ord, Toby. Senior research fellow in Phil. @ Oxford
University. Doctorate in Phil. from the University of Oxford. "The
Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity", Hachette Books,
2020. Accessed 8/13/23.) //Ulven

But the purpose of this chapter is finding and assessing threats that
pose a direct existential risk to humanity. **[Even
at]{.underline}** such **[extreme
levels]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [warming,]{.underline} [it is
difficult to see exactly how climate change could]{.underline} do so.
Major effects of climate change include reduced agricultural yields, sea
level rises, water scarcity, increased tropical diseases, ocean
acidification and the collapse of the Gulf Stream. While extremely
important when assessing the overall risks of climate change, [**no**ne
of
these]{.underline} [threaten]{.underline} **[extinction]{.underline}** [or
irrevocable collapse]{.underline}.

[Crops are]{.underline} very [sensitive to reductions]{.underline} in
temperature (due to frosts), [but]{.underline} **[less sensitive to
increases]{.underline}**. By all appearances [we
would]{.underline} [still]{.underline} [have food]{.underline} [to
support civilization]{.underline}.85 **[Even if]{.underline}** [sea
levels]{.underline} **[rose hundreds of meters]{.underline}** (over
centuries), **[most]{.underline}** [of the
Earth's]{.underline} **[land]{.underline}** **[area]{.underline}** **[would
remain]{.underline}**. Similarly, while some areas might conceivably
become uninhabitable due to water scarcity, other [areas will have
increased rainfall]{.underline}. More areas may become susceptible to
tropical diseases, but we need only [look to the tropics to see
civilization flourish]{.underline} despite this. The main effect of a
collapse of the system of Atlantic Ocean currents that includes the Gulf
Stream is a 2°C cooling of Europe---something
that [poses]{.underline} **[no permanent threat]{.underline}** [to
global civilization.]{.underline}

[From an existential risk perspective]{.underline}, a more serious
concern is that the high temperatures (and the rapidity of their change)
might cause a large loss of biodiversity and subsequent ecosystem
collapse. While the pathway is not entirely clear, a large enough
collapse of ecosystems across the globe could perhaps threaten human
extinction. The idea that climate change could cause widespread
extinctions has some good theoretical support.86 Yet the **[evidence is
mixed]{.underline}**. For when we [look at many]{.underline} of
the [past cases
of]{.underline} [extremely]{.underline} **[high]{.underline}** [global]{.underline} [**temp**erature**s**]{.underline} **[or]{.underline}** [extremely]{.underline} **[rapid
warming]{.underline}** [we]{.underline} **[don't
see]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} [corresponding]{.underline} [**loss
of biod**iversity]{.underline}.87

\[FOOTNOTE\]

We don't see such biodiversity loss in the 12°C warmer climate of the
early Eocene, nor the rapid global change of the PETM, nor in rapid
regional changes of climate. Willis et al. (2010) state: "We argue that
although the underlying mechanisms responsible for these past changes in
climate were very different (i.e. natural processes rather than
anthropogenic), the rates and magnitude of climate change are similar to
those predicted for the future and therefore potentially relevant to
understanding future biotic response. What emerges from these past
records is evidence for rapid community turnover, migrations,
development of novel ecosystems and thresholds from one stable ecosystem
state to another, but [there is very]{.underline} [**little
ev**idence]{.underline} **[for]{.underline}** [broad-scale]{.underline} **[extinctions]{.underline}** [due
to]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [warming]{.underline} [world]{.underline}."
There are similar conclusions in Botkin et al. (2007), Dawson et al.
(2011), Hof et al. (2011) and Willis & MacDonald (2011). The best
evidence of warming causing extinction may be from the end-Permian mass
extinction, which may have been associated with large-scale warming (see
note 91 to this chapter).

\[END FOOTNOTE\]

So the most important known effect of climate change from the
perspective of direct existential risk is probably the most obvious:
heat stress. We need an environment cooler than our body temperature to
be able to rid ourselves of waste heat and stay alive. More precisely,
we need to be able to lose heat by sweating, which depends on the
humidity as well as the temperature.

A landmark paper by Steven Sherwood and Matthew Huber showed that with
sufficient warming there would be parts of the world whose temperature
and humidity combine to exceed the level where humans could survive
without air conditioning.88 With 12°C of warming, a very large land
area---where more than half of all people currently live and where much
of our food is grown---would exceed this level at some point during a
typical year. Sherwood and Huber suggest that such areas would be
uninhabitable. This may not quite be true (particularly if air
conditioning is possible during the hottest months), but their
habitability is at least in question.

However, **[substantial
regions]{.underline}** [would]{.underline} also **[remain
below]{.underline}** [this]{.underline} [threshold.]{.underline} **[Even
with]{.underline}** [an
extreme]{.underline} **[20°C]{.underline}** **[of
warming]{.underline}** [there would
be]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}** [coastal]{.underline} **[areas]{.underline}** [(and]{.underline} [some]{.underline} [elevated
regions]{.underline}) that [would have no days above the
temperature/humidity threshold]{.underline}.89 So [there
would]{.underline} [remain]{.underline} [large areas in which humanity
and]{.underline} [**civ**ilization]{.underline} **[could
continue]{.underline}**. A world with 20°C of warming would be an
unparalleled human and environmental tragedy, forcing mass migration and
perhaps starvation too. This is reason enough to do our utmost to
prevent anything like that from ever happening. However, our present
task is identifying existential risks to humanity and it is hard to see
how any realistic level of heat stress could pose such a risk. So the
runaway and moist greenhouse effects remain the only known mechanisms
through which climate change could directly cause our extinction or
irrevocable collapse.

This doesn't rule out unknown mechanisms. We are considering large
changes to the Earth that may even be unprecedented in size or speed. It
wouldn't be astonishing if that directly led to our permanent ruin. The
best argument against such unknown mechanisms is probably that the PETM
did not lead to a mass extinction, despite temperatures rapidly rising
about 5°C, to reach a level 14°C above pre-industrial temperatures.90
But this is tempered by the imprecision of paleoclimate data, the
sparsity of the fossil record, the smaller size of mammals at the time
(making them more heat-tolerant), and a reluctance to rely on a single
example. Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred
times faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
in which 96 percent of species went extinct.91 [In the end]{.underline},
we can say little more than that **[direct]{.underline}** **[existential
risk]{.underline}** [from climate
change]{.underline} **[appears]{.underline}** **[very
small]{.underline}**, but cannot yet be ruled out.

**No extinction \-- historical precedent**

**Thorstad 23**, PhD, Assistant Professor of Philosophy at Vanderbilt
University. (David, 1-28-2023, \"Exaggerating the risks (Part 4:
Halstead continued),\" Reflective Altruism,
https://reflectivealtruism.com/2023/01/28/exaggerating-the-risks-part-4-halstead-continued/)

But I will bite. I think Halstead is quite convincing in arguing that
the paleoclimate **[data]{.underline}** [does not give]{.underline} us
good [reason to expect climate change to bring
about]{.underline} irreversible **[existential]{.underline}** **[catastrophe]{.underline}** any
time
soon, [and]{.underline} probably [gives]{.underline} [us]{.underline} **[good
reason]{.underline}** [to
expect]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [it]{.underline} [**won't**.]{.underline}

The first thing to note is that [the earth has been]{.underline} **[much
hotter]{.underline}** in the past [than even
the]{.underline} [most]{.underline} **[dire]{.underline}** [warming
projections]{.underline} predict it will soon become. [During
the]{.underline} Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum
(**[PETM]{.underline}**) 55 million years ago, [the earth
was]{.underline} an astounding
14-**[17°]{.underline}**C **[above]{.underline}** [the pre-industrial
average, but]{.underline} **[species
extinctions]{.underline}** [were]{.underline} **[limited]{.underline}**.
Here is Halstead:

Overall, in the PETM, temperatures were upwards of 17°C higher than
pre-industrial levels and [the]{.underline} **[only
species]{.underline}** [that went extinct]{.underline} that we know
of [was]{.underline} a **[single-celled]{.underline}** marine organism,
and [on land it was a time of]{.underline} **[ecological
flourishing]{.underline}**, persistence and diversity.

But if the scorching temperatures of the PETM did not lead to
existential catastrophe, [why believe that lower]{.underline} [levels of
warming will now]{.underline} **[destroy humanity]{.underline}**? We saw
in Part 2 that even Ord seems concerned by this thought:

The best argument against ... unknown mechanisms \[for extinction\] is
probably that [the PETM]{.underline} \[Paleocene--Eocene Thermal
Maximum\] [did]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [lead to a mass
extinction, despite temp]{.underline}erature[s]{.underline} **[rapidly
rising]{.underline}** about 5 degrees Celsius, [to reach]{.underline} a
level of **[14 degrees]{.underline}** Celsius above pre-industrial
temperatures.

Toby Ord, The precipice

However, Ord suggests that even though the PETM was hotter than the 21st
century will be, warming during the PETM was slower than the rapid
warming we are now experiencing:

Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred times
faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
in which 96 percent of species went extinct.

Toby Ord, The precipice

Fair enough. But Halstead has something to say about that too.

Citing Willis and MacDonald (2011), Halstead reminds us that [we have
seen]{.underline} **[rapid warming]{.underline}** [before]{.underline}:

a. [In]{.underline} **[Greenland]{.underline}**, [temperatures]{.underline} may [have
risen]{.underline} by **[10°]{.underline}**C, though this may be an
error in climate proxies.

b. [In]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[Swiss Alps]{.underline}** and
other parts of Europe, a [warming of]{.underline} 2
to **[5°]{.underline}**C [appears to have occurred in 200 years or
less]{.underline}.

c. [In the]{.underline} **[Sierra Nevada]{.underline}** of
California, [rates of warming in the late glacial may have
been]{.underline} 4 to **[5°]{.underline}**C every 500 years [around
15,000 years ago.]{.underline}

d\. At the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, [there were
increases of 5°C and more over a]{.underline} **[few
decades]{.underline}** (11,700 years ago).

e. [Data from]{.underline} **[Greenland]{.underline}** [ice
cores]{.underline} [suggest]{.underline} that a
\>[**10°**C]{.underline} [warming]{.underline} [may
have]{.underline} [occurred over]{.underline} 20 to **[6
years]{.underline}** (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

f\. In California, warming at the close of the Younger Dryas (13,000
years ago) may have been on the order of 3°C in less than 100 to 200
years.

g\. For the entire Southwest US, a general warming of 4°C may have
occurred in less than a century (13,000 to 11,000 years ago).

Halstead, Climate change and longtermism

Just as [history gives us]{.underline} **[abundant
ev]{.underline}**idence [of]{.underline} [large
mammals]{.underline} **[surviving]{.underline}** [temperatures]{.underline} **[hotter]{.underline}** [than]{.underline} [the
earth is projected to be]{.underline} by 2100, [history also gives us
evidence of survival at rates of warming comparable to
the]{.underline} **[worst-case scenarios]{.underline}** [in the IPCC
report]{.underline}.

[Even the worst-looking scenarios give]{.underline} **[cause for
comfort]{.underline}**. For example, [in]{.underline} [the beginning
of]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[Holocene]{.underline}** (\~10,000
BCE), climate change did seem to play a role in the extinction of
megafauna (large animals). But there is little evidence of plant
extinctions, and many megafauna survived. In particular, Halstead
notes, [humans]{.underline} [**lived**, and]{.underline} by all
appearances **[thrived]{.underline}** [during this time]{.underline}.
And as for the megafauna who perished, a live scientific hypothesis is
the overkill hypothesis: they died because we killed and ate them.
(Halstead assigns this 90% credence, but notes that many scientists may
be closer to 50%). All of this gives us every reason for confidence
that **[today's]{.underline}** [humans, with]{.underline} [greater

We saw in Part 2 that the only sustained argument which Ord makes in
favor of climate risk is his discussion of unknown mechanisms in the
context of paleoclimate. But, if Halstead is right to suggest that the
paleoclimate data gives us every reason for confidence in humanity's
survival, then we should not have much confidence in Ord's argument.

The [existential risks]{.underline} [of climate change instead stem from

point]{.underline} global [warming]{.underline} [would
become]{.underline} [severe enough to pose
an]{.underline} [existential]{.underline} [threat]{.underline}. Research
has suggested that warming of 11-12°C would render most of the planet
uninhabitable and would completely devastate agriculture. This would
pose an extreme threat to human civilisation as we know it. Warming of
around 7°C or more could potentially produce conflict and instability on
such a scale that the indirect effects could be an existential
risk, [although it is extremely uncertain how likely such scenarios
are]{.underline}. Moreover, the [timescales]{.underline} [over which
such changes might
happen]{.underline} could [mean]{.underline} that [humanity is able to
adapt]{.underline} enough [to avoid
extinction]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [even
very]{.underline} [extreme scenarios.]{.underline} The probability of
these levels of warming depends on eventual greenhouse gas

is likely]{.underline} [that]{.underline} [we will
pursue]{.underline} [a medium-high

extreme warming is highly uncertain but appears non-negligible. Current
concentrations of greenhouse gases are higher than they have been for
hundreds of thousands of years,21 which means that [there are
significant unknown unknowns about how the climate system will
respond]{.underline}. Particularly concerning is the risk of positive
feedback loops, such as the release of vast amounts of methane from
melting of the arctic permafrost, which would cause rapid and disastrous
warming.22 The economists Gernot Wagner and Martin Weitzman have
used [IPCC]{.underline} [figures]{.underline} (which do not include
modelling of feedback loops such as those from melting permafrost)
to [estimate]{.underline} [t]{.underline}hat [if we
continue]{.underline} [to pursue a medium-high emissions

of]{.underline} [6°C]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [around]{.underline} [10%]{.underline} [and
of 10°C is around 3%. These estimates are of course highly
uncertain]{.underline}. It is likely that the world will take action
against climate change once it begins to impose large costs on human
society, long before there is warming of 10°C. Unfortunately, [there
is]{.underline} [significant]{.underline} [inertia in the climate
system:]{.underline} [there is a]{.underline} [25 to]{.underline} [50

of]{.underline} [the peak concentration of]{.underline} [CO2 will

the peak is reached.]{.underline} Consequently, [it is impossible to
reduce temperatures]{.underline} [quickly]{.underline} [by reducing CO2

the international community will therefore face strong incentives to
find other ways to reduce global temperatures.

"Cooling perspectives on the risk of pathogenic viruses from thawing
permafrost" 8 January 2025
https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/msystems.00042-24

ABSTRACT Climate change is inducing wide-scale permafrost thaw in the
Arctic and subarctic, triggering concerns that long-dormant pathogens
could reemerge from the thawing ground and initiate epidemics or
pandemics. Viruses, as opposed to bacterial pathogens, garner particular
interest because outbreaks cannot be controlled with antibiotics, though
the effects can be mitigated by vaccines and newer antiviral drugs. To
evaluate the potential hazards posed by viral pathogens emerging from
thawing permafrost, we review information from a diverse range of
disciplines. This includes efforts to recover infectious virus from
human remains, studies on disease occurrence in polar animal
populations, investigations into viral persistence and infectivity in
permafrost, and assessments of human exposure to the enormous viral
diversity present in the environment. Based on currently available
knowledge, we conclude that **[the risk posed by viruses from thawing
permafrost is no greater than viruses in other
environments]{.underline}** such as temperate soils and aquatic systems.
INTRODUCTION Permafrost underlies a quarter of Earth's terrestrial
surface (1) and, despite millennia of subzero temperatures, hosts
diverse microbial communities (2). Some microorganisms survive by
altering their physiology and maintaining low rates of metabolic
activity. Others adopt dormant forms such as endospores or cysts (3--7).
Viruses that infect bacteria, archaea, and microeukaryotes (e.g., fungi
and amoebae) are also abundant members of these microbial communities,
both in thawing and intact permafrost (8, 9). They can survive by
infecting active cells, through passive existence as prophages, or as
"stowaways" when an infected cell enters dormancy. In some cases,
cold-adapted viruses may persist frozen outside of their hosts (10--13).
Permafrost also contains the remains of dead microbes, plants, animals,
and occasionally humans, which are preserved by frozen conditions (3,
14, 15). Climate change may thaw up to 40% of Arctic and subarctic
permafrost by the end of the century (16), exposing the preserved
remains of infectious disease victims (both human and animal). If viral
pathogens maintain infectivity while frozen in permafrost, or if
permafrost viruses with microbial hosts can jump to humans or animals,
thaw could potentially initiate disease outbreaks (17). However, there
are many reasons why this possibility should not result in a heightened
sense of alarm. The possibility of pathogenic microorganisms emerging
from thawing permafrost and causing disease is not completely without
precedent. In 2016 an anthrax outbreak, caused by the bacterium Bacillus
anthracis, resulted in the death of one person, sickened dozens more,
and killed thousands of domesticated reindeer on the Yamal Peninsula in
Russia (18). Prior to the introduction of a vaccine around 1930, anthrax
was common on the Yamal Peninsula and periodically decimated reindeer
populations (19). Reindeer herds likely acquired anthrax through the
uptake of environmentally resistant endospores, which can remain dormant
in the soil for decades. This is akin to transmission pathways in
grazing animals from temperate regions (20). From \~1930 to 2016,
anthrax was virtually absent on the Yamal Peninsula due to reindeer
vaccination programs (19). However, routine vaccination was discontinued
in 2007, leading to an immunologically naive host population that was
susceptible to infection by B. anthracis (18, 21). It is unclear whether
the 2016 outbreak was caused by B. anthracis acquired from thawing
permafrost and/or thawed reindeer carcasses, or if it occurred
independent of thaw in a region where anthrax was endemic (22).
Vaccination has since resumed, and no further outbreaks have been
reported (23). [The inability of anthrax to spread from person to person
and the availability of modern vaccines and antibiotics]{.underline}
(24) [suggest that emergence of]{.underline} B. anthracis [**spores from
thawing permafrost would be unlikely to cause a geographically
widespread epidemic** or pandemic]{.underline}. In general, modern
[antibiotics make potential emerging bacterial pathogens more
containable than viral pathogens]{.underline}. We therefore focus on
viral pathogens for the remainder of this perspective. Box 1.
Definitions and terminology Viral pathogen A virus that "causes damage
in a susceptible host or has the potential to do so" (25). Spillover
Transmission of a virus from one species to another, establishing an
infection in a new host (25, 26). This definition includes spillovers
that are followed by transmission between individuals in the new host
species and spillovers that dead-end in the new host (i.e., there is no
subsequent transmission between individuals in the new host species), as
occurs when hantaviruses and the rabies virus spillover into humans from
animal hosts (27, 28). Host jump We define host jump as a spillover
followed by sustained transmission between individuals in the new host
species. Zoonosis Infection transmitted from non-human animals to
humans. Giant viruses The existence of giant viruses was first
recognized in 2003 when a virus measuring 0.7 µm in diameter was
isolated from an amoeba host (29). Since then, many additional giant
viruses have been identified through cultivation-based approaches and in
metagenomic sequence data from environmental samples (30--32). They are
characterized by their exceptionally large size, can typically be
observed with a light microscope, and are larger than some bacterial
cells. Giant viruses have been placed in the diverse Nucleocytoviricota
phylum, which includes other lineages of large (but not giant) viruses.
There is not a formal consensus on which clades within
Nucleocytoviricota constitute giant viruses, in part because taxonomic
classification is challenging (33), but they typically include members
of the Mimiviridae, Marseilleviridae, Pithoviridae, and Pandoraviridae
families (31, 34--37). In some instances, the term "giant viruses" has
been expanded to describe the entire Nucleocytoviricota phylum (38).
However, this phylum covers an enormous phylogenetic range (including
variola virus, which causes smallpox) with lineages that differ
substantially from giant viruses found in permafrost and other
environments (31, 39, 40). Here, we adhere to the non-expanded use of
the term that differentiates between large and giant viruses. Potential
viral pathogens from thawing permafrost could cause human disease
outbreaks through three general pathways. The first is reintroduction of
human viral pathogens, such as those causing influenza and smallpox,
from thawing graves, mass burial sites, or soil or ice to the modern
environment. The second is reintroduction of viruses with wildlife or
domestic animal hosts from thawed remains or soil and ice, which could
be transmitted directly to humans or could infect animals before jumping
to humans. The third is the spillover of permafrost viruses with
microbial hosts, such as microeukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea, to
humans or animals when permafrost thaws. To initiate an outbreak,
viruses spilling over would need to both establish an infection in the
new host and subsequently be transmitted between individuals in the new
host species. As discussed in more detail in later sections, this third
pathway is an especially unlikely scenario. All of these general
pathways depend on whether viruses can survive and remain infectious for
decades to millennia in permafrost in sufficient numbers to cause
disease. The latter two also depend on the ability of viruses to
spillover from the original reservoir and initiate a successful chain of
transmission in the new host (41). This perspective discusses each
scenario and the factors that inform risk assessments. HUMAN PATHOGENIC
VIRUSES IN PERMAFROST Smallpox [Smallpox]{.underline} is caused by the
variola virus, a double-stranded DNA virus with a 186-kb genome (42).
The last known natural case occurred in 1977, and the World Health
Assembly declared it officially eradicated in 1980 (43). Since
eradication, bodies from permafrost have been tested for evidence of
viable virus at archeological sites or when warm temperatures threaten
burial sites (15, 44). The first such test was in the 1990s, initiated
by the discovery of a wooden vault, near the village of Pokhodsk in
northern Siberia, that contained mummified bodies of smallpox victims
(44). Scientists from the Vector Institute (a facility near Novosibirsk
that is one of the two places on Earth that holds remaining stores of
smallpox virus) and their colleagues collected samples from the chamber,
including from smallpox pustules. Back in the lab, they were unable to
isolate live virus from the samples (44--46) and explained that the
**[virus]{.underline} [may have been destroyed by prior
freeze]{.underline}**--[thaw cycles]{.underline} since the burial site
was [near the permafrost surface and may have periodically thawed during
warm years]{.underline} (44, 46). Another [attempt at testing for
variola virus]{.underline} was [from]{.underline} well-preserved [frozen
mummies]{.underline} at an archeological site in the central Sakha
Republic in Eastern Siberia (15). Quick burial after death and
preservation efforts during excavation and sampling increased the
probability of virus preservation. Rather than attempting to recover
viable virus, the length of variola virus DNA fragments was used as a
proxy for the presence of intact virus. Since an intact genome is
necessary for viability, infectivity would be possible only if long
pieces of DNA remained. PCR products were obtained for three short DNA
fragments (139, 145, and 590 bp), and sequence analysis confirmed
amplicons were from the variola virus. Long-distance PCR (targeting an
\~2-kb region of the viral genome) **[failed to produce amplification
products, ruling out the presence of intact viral
particles.]{.underline}** The influenza pandemic of 1918 The influenza
pandemic of 1918, caused by an H1N1 influenza A virus with a 13.5-kb RNA
genome, resulted [in]{.underline} the deaths of tens of millions of
people (47). The pandemic was particularly devastating for residents of
[Alaska Native communities]{.underline}, who suffered 82% of
influenza-associated deaths in Alaska (48). The story of virus recovery
efforts from human remains in permafrost is centered in Brevig Mission
(called Teller Mission in 1918), a small Inupiat village. On 14 November
1918, Brevig Mission had \~80 adult residents. From 15 to 20 November,
influenza claimed the lives of 72 residents. A burial site was dug into
the permafrost, where the preserved remains of victims were undisturbed
until 1951 when scientist Johan Hultin obtained permission from village
elders to excavate the burial site (49, 50). [Tissue]{.underline}
[was]{.underline} [collected from the lungs of four individuals who had
been interred in permafrost]{.underline}. [To determine if infectious
H1N1 virus persisted]{.underline}, the lung tissue was cultured in
embryonated chicken eggs (51), a highly sensitive method for influenza
virus detection (52). However, **[no evidence of infectious virus was
observed]{.underline}** (50, 51). Forty-six years after the first
attempt and [79 years after the pandemic]{.underline},
[Hultin]{.underline} and colleagues [again obtained
permission]{.underline} to excavate the Brevig Mission gravesite
[for]{.underline} an attempt at [H1N1 virus recovery]{.underline}. Lung
tissue was collected from the remains of four individuals buried at a
depth of approximately 2 m. Influenza virus RNA was detected in one of
the individuals using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) testing.
However, [only small fragments of the viral genome]{.underline} (\<120
nucleotides[) could be amplified]{.underline} (51, 53[), showing that
viable viral particles did not remain in the samples]{.underline} and
suggesting that [influenza]{.underline} virus **[does not survive in
permafrost]{.underline}.** The interred remains of individuals from
Brevig Mission represent the highest probability scenario investigated
to date in terms of human pathogenic virus preservation. Gold miners,
who were skilled at excavating in permafrost, were employed by the
territorial government to dig the burial site. Individuals were buried
at 2 m, below depths susceptible to occasional thaw during warm years.
The 1951 [excavation recovered "generous" biopsies from eight lungs,
which all tested negative for the presence of influenza
virus]{.underline} (51). In 1997, the remains of four individuals were
uncovered (53). One was well preserved, which was likely due to
subcutaneous fatty tissue that had protected the internal organs. It was
tissue from that lung that yielded small viral genome fragments (51).
Lessons learned from variola virus and the 1918 H1N1 influenza virus
These **[examples suggest]{.underline}** **[that human pathogenic
viruses probably do not remain infectious when frozen in permafrost,
even when preservation conditions are]{.underline}** nearly
**[ideal]{.underline}** and samples are carefully collected using
procedures to preserve viability or genome integrity (17, 54). The small
number of examples makes the precise hazard difficult to predict, but
also points to another consideration: specifically, that [the number of
well-preserved grave sites may be quite small]{.underline}. [Digging
into frozen ground is difficult]{.underline} and requires special tools
and/or techniques (51). [Burial in]{.underline} the active layer ([soil
overlaying permafrost that freezes and thaws annually),]{.underline} as
occurred in the case of 1918 influenza victims on Svalbard (55), [or in
shallow permafrost]{.underline} that is near freezing and occasionally
thaws during warm years, [can reduce the number of viable viral
particles by many fold due to freeze]{.underline}--thaw cycles (54).
Even for recently deceased influenza victims, **[the infectious hazard
of human remains is low.]{.underline}** Guidelines for funeral directors
and mortuary staff place influenza in the low-risk category, and viewing
and embalming are considered safe (56--58). Together, the combination of
limited infectious virus survival in permafrost, a potentially small
number of well-preserved burial sites, and low transmission risk from
human remains suggests that **[thawing permafrost is not a probable
exposure pathway.]{.underline}**

"Cooling perspectives on the risk of pathogenic viruses from thawing
permafrost" 8 January 2025
https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/msystems.00042-24

CONCLUSIONS Currently available [data indicate that there is no
increased risk of human viral pathogen emergence from permafrost
compared to other environmental sources]{.underline}. We do not claim
that viral pathogens in permafrost pose zero risk or that surveillance
of putative viral pathogens in permafrost is unnecessary. However, there
is **[currently no evidence that human or animal viral pathogens frozen
in permafrost pose an imminent disease outbreak threat]{.underline}**.
Though climate change is accelerating thaw, [the entry of microbes from
ancient permafrost into the modern environment is not a new
phenomenon]{.underline}. [Permafrost is continually and naturally
exposed to the modern environment by processes such as erosion,
cryoturbation, frost heave, solifluction, wildfire, and climate
fluctuations]{.underline} (151--153). [Humans have been in the Arctic
for more than 40,000 years]{.underline} (Alaska up to 25,000 years and
Scandinavia \~5,000 to 12,000 years) (154--156). This [suggests that
people are and have been regularly exposed to viruses from permafrost
soils, with no clear evidence for large-scale health consequences.
Framing viral discovery]{.underline} efforts in the cryosphere [as a
search for "zombie viruses]{.underline}" or potentially pandemic
pathogens [is not]{.underline} particularly [useful and perhaps even
harmful]{.underline}. [Stoking fears]{.underline} of viruses in thawing
permafrost [may]{.underline} inadvertently [discourage customary and
traditional cultural practices among]{.underline} subarctic and [Arctic
residents or divert attention from]{.underline} the more pressing [ways
that pathogens in the warming Arctic pose risk to human health and
well-being]{.underline} (157). For example, [wildlife and humans
increasingly occupy shared habitats, providing opportunities for viruses
maintained in animals to spillover into humans]{.underline} (90).
Arthropod and rodent disease vector ranges are expanding and shifting
northward (158). [Extreme precipitation and flooding events are
increasing, threatening infrastructure such as water and waste treatment
facilities]{.underline} (159--161). [Higher temperatures increase the
survival of some water-borne disease agents]{.underline} (91).
Furthermore, [wildlife health may be affected as a consequence of
climate change, which further compromises fragile ecosystems and the
people that rely upon them]{.underline} (162).

[The current geopolitical environment is altering]{.underline} the
practice of [science diplomacy by]{.underline} governmental and
non-[governmental organizations in large part because the ability to
carry out international scientific]{.underline} and technological
[collaborations is being affected by security concerns. That is
especially true in collaborative research on technologies]{.underline},
but it is also true in those areas of fundamental research close to
technological advances that have the potential to create significant
advantages and threats for a nation state. International
[scientific]{.underline} and technological [collaboration]{.underline}
funded by governments [is]{.underline} growing among allied countries
but [decreasing between countries in competition and
conflict]{.underline}. That will affect the global advance of science
and technology as well as the ability of countries to collaborate to
solve global challenges. It is also negatively affecting the ability of
the United States as well as other countries to attract talent from
around the world. [The use of science diplomacy as a "window of
communication" between estranged countries is disappearing.
International scientific engagement has always been a vital component of
science and technology capacity-building and a key ingredient of many
science diplomacy initiatives.]{.underline} The new rules and
restrictions being developed and implemented now by government agencies
in the United States and allied countries are being justified by
legitimate security concerns arising from patent infringement,
technology theft, malign foreign talent programs, and espionage, as well
as cases of serious ethical lapses by scientists. This new regime of
research security will potentially affect fundamental research where, in
the past, results have been published in the open literature and where
much of the work has been conducted at universities, civilian national
laboratories, and international facilities. I have been concerned over
the past two years that [the balance between research openness and
security for fundamental research would tip too far towards the security
side. That would likely lead to more areas of "controlled unclassified
information" (CUI) and significantly decrease international scientific
collaboration]{.underline}. In my view, that result would harm the
ability of the United States and other democratic countries to advance
our national interest in being world leaders in science, technology, and
innovation, and in attracting talented people from around the world to
our countries. I have become more optimistic over this past year that
the engagement and dialogue being carried out by U.S. university
leaders, researchers, research-funding agencies, and government security
agencies is leading to a more nuanced and informed risk assessment
process[. Research institutions and research funders are implementing
rules and procedures that will not eliminate risks but will enable a
careful judgment on how to reduce the risks while still achieving the
benefits of the research. When carried out a project-by-project basis
with engagement by highly knowledgeable scientists inside and outside
government, this process should lead to better judgments on the balance
between openness and security for fundamental research.]{.underline}

High-Mortality Pandemics

[A]{.underline} [naturally
occurring]{.underline} [pandemic]{.underline} (i.e., not from an
engineered
pathogen) [that]{.underline} [would]{.underline} [threaten]{.underline} [human]{.underline} [extinction
is a]{.underline} **[very
small]{.underline}** [probability]{.underline} [event]{.underline}.
However, historical accounts point to several instances where disease
spread played an important role in causing very significant decline of
specific populations. For example, the introduction of novel diseases to
the Native American population during the European colonization of the
Americas had deadly consequences. It is difficult to distinguish the
effects of the diseases that came with the Europeans from the war and
conflict they also brought with them. Nevertheless, during the first
hundred years of the colonization period, the American population may
have been reduced by as much as 90% (Ord 2020).

Moreover, two major pandemic events, the Justinian Plague in the sixth
century and the Black Death in the fourteenth century appear to have
been severe enough to cause a significant population decline of tens of
percent in the populations they affected. Both events are believed to
have been caused by plague, an infectious disease caused by the bacteria
Yersinia Pestis (Christakos et al. 2005; Allen 1979). While there is a
certain degree of uncertainty involved in studying these events'
societal impacts, historical accounts in combination with modern
scientific methods provide us with some valuable insights into the
effects they may have had on the societies of the time.

With respect to the possibility of a future catastrophic global
pandemic, it appears that this risk is increasing significantly along
with the advances in the field of synthetic biology and the rising
possibility of an accidental or intentional release of an engineered
pathogen. While some of the scientific efforts in the field of synthetic
biology are directed towards increasing our understanding and our
ability to prevent future catastrophic epidemic threats, the risk
stemming from these activities is non-trivial, and may outweigh their
benefits.

The Justinian Plague

The Justinian Plague severely affected the people of Europe and East
Asia, though estimates of its overall mortality vary. Focusing
exclusively on the first wave of the pandemic (AD 541--544), Muehlhauser
(2017) suggests the pandemic was associated with a 20% mortality in the
Byzantine empire. This estimate is based on the mortality rate estimated
for the empire's capital, Constantinople, by Stathakopoulos (2007) to
produce a death toll of roughly 5.6 million. For a longer time span, AD
541 to 600, which included subsequent waves of the plague, scholars
estimate a higher mortality rate of 33--50% (Allen 1979; Meier 2016).

The demographic changes associated with this high mortality led to a
significant disruption of economic activity in the Byzantine empire
(Gârdan 2020). A decline in the labour force caused a decline in
agricultural production which led to food shortages and famine (Meier
2016). Trade also collapsed. Decreased tax revenues caused by the
population decline initiated a major fiscal contraction and consequently
a military crisis for the empire (Sarris 2002; Meier 2016). In the
longer run, however, the massive reduction of the labour force appears
to have had a positive economic effect for the surviving laborers, as
the increased marginal value of labour caused a rise in real wages and
per capita incomes. These beneficial effects for the survivors were also
observed after the Black Death (Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014; Findlay and
Lundahl 2017).

The mortality and the disruption of activity the plague caused in the
Byzantine empire also led to further direct and indirect cultural and
religious consequences. Meier (2016) particularly highlights the
plague's indirect effect of an increase in liturgification (a process of
religious permeation and internalization throughout society as defined
by Meier 2020), the rise of the Marian cult, and the sacralization of
the emperor.

The direct and indirect effects of the plague also appear to have had
far-reaching and long-term political repercussions. The societal
disruptions caused by the plague are believed to have significantly
weakened the position of the Byzantine empire and arguably led to the
decline of the Sasanian empire (Sabbatani et al. 2012). Interestingly,
the pandemic indirectly favoured the nomadic Arab tribes who were less
vulnerable to the contagion while traveling through desert and
semi-desert environments during the initial expansion of Islam
(Sabbatani et al. 2012).

Of note is the absence of a scientific consensus on the severity of the
Justinian Plague's impacts. For example, Mordechai and Eisenberg (2019)
and Mordechai et al. (2019) argue against the maximalist interpretation
of the historical evidence described above. They suggest that the
estimated mortality rate of the plague is exaggerated, and that the
pandemic was not a primary cause of the transformational demographic,
political and economic changes in the Mediterranean region between the
sixth and eighth century. Recently, White and Mordechai (2020)
highlighted the high likelihood of the plague having different impacts
in the urban areas of the Mediterranean outside of Constantinople.

The Black Death

The Black Death which ravaged Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia in
the middle of the fourteenth century is considered the deadliest
pandemic in human history and potentially the most severe global
catastrophe to have ever struck mankind. With respect to its mortality,
Ord (2020) argues that the best estimate of its global mortality rate is
5--14% of the global population, largely based on Muehlhauser (2017).

The plague created a large demographic shock in the affected regions. It
reduced the European population by approximately 30--50% during the 6
years of its initial outbreak (Ord 2020). It took approximately two
centuries for the population levels to recover (Livi-Bacci 2017; Jedwab
et al. 2019b). As the mortality rates appear to have been the highest
among the working-age population, the effects on the labour force were
acute (Pamuk 2007).

The plague\'s mortality, morbidity and the associated societal
disruption led to a major decline in economic output both in Europe
(Pamuk 2007) and the Middle East (Dols 2019). In Europe, however, this
decline in economic output was smaller than the decline in population;
output per capita began to increase within a few years of the initial
outbreak (Pamuk 2007).

The large demographic shock caused by the plague led to a shift in the
relative price of labour which, similarly to the Justinian Plague, had a
positive impact on wages. With a reduced labour force, real wages and
per capita incomes in many European countries increased and were
sustained at higher levels for several centuries (Voigtländer and Voth
2013a; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014). Scott and Duncan
(2001) point out that real wages approximately doubled in most countries
of Europe in the century following the plague.

An additional insight into the long-run relationship between the Black
Death's mortality and per capita incomes in Europe is offered by
Voigtländer and Voth (2013a). Using a Malthusian model, they suggest
that over time, the rise in income caused by the plague's mortality led
to an increase in urbanization and trade. Furthermore, the increased tax
burden (per capita), combined with the contemporary political climate,
increased the frequency of wars. Consequently, higher urbanization and
trade led to an increase in disease spread which along with a more
frequent war occurrence caused a long-term increase in mortality and a
further positive effect on per capita incomes. In this way, the Black
Death appears to have created a long-lasting environment of
high-mortality and high-income specifically in Western Europe,
functioning as an important contributing factor to its economic growth
in the next centuries (Alfani 2020). However, while in Western Europe
incomes remained elevated over the next centuries, in Southern Europe
they began to decline as the Southern European population started
recovering after AD 1500 (Jedwab et al. 2020).

Apart from the positive effects on wages, the increased marginal value
of labour combined with other factors had further economic and social
implications. A decreased relative value of land and the lack of
workforce to use it effectively caused land prices and land rents to
decrease (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk 2007). A decreased marginal value of
capital assets in general led to a lapse in the enforcement of property
rights (Haddock and Kiesling 2002). Interest rates and real rates of
return on assets also decreased (Pamuk 2007; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
and Shatzmiller 2014; Jordà et al. 2021; Clark 2016).

Higher wages in combination with a relative abundance of land increased
people's access to land/home ownership, likely reducing social
inequality (Alfani 2020). On the other end of the income distribution,
decreased incomes for landowners led to an overall decrease in income
inequality (Jedwab et al. 2020; Alfani and Murphy 2017).

With respect to the effects on agriculture, the structure of
agricultural output moved away from cereals to other crops following the
plague. Furthermore, the workforce shortages and the incentives to
increase the labour supply are believed to have caused a shift from
male-labour intensive arable farming towards pastoral farming,
consequently raising the demand for female labour (Voigtländer and Voth
2013b). However, while the Black Death appears to have caused certain
structural agricultural changes, Clark (2016) finds no effect of the
plague on agricultural productivity in the long run.

In terms of other social consequences, the evidence suggests that the
plague\'s mortality reduced labour coercion, particularly throughout
Western Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Haddock and Kiesling 2002; Gingerich
and Vogler 2021). The increased bargaining power of labour caused by the
plague's demographic shock contributed to and accelerated the decline in
serfdom and development of a free labour regime. Gingerich and Voler
(2021) further argue that these effects may have had long-lasting
political implications and that a decline of repressive labour practices
(such as serfdom) permitted the development of more inclusive political
institutions. They find that the regions with the highest mortality were
more likely to develop participatory political institutions and more
equitable land ownership systems. They find that centuries later, In
Germany, the populations in these high-mortality regions were less
likely to vote for Hitler's National Socialist (Nazi) Party in the 1930
and 1932 elections in Germany.

However, the positive effects on the emergence of freer labour did not
take place in Eastern Europe, where serfdom was sustained and even
intensified. Robinson and Torvik (2011) attempt to explain this
asymmetry arguing that these differential outcomes may have been caused
by the varying power and quality of institutions. The authors suggest
that opportunities generated by the increased bargaining power of
labour, in an environment of weak institutions, were less likely to lead
to a positive effect than in the case of regions with stronger
institutions (with more robust rule-of-law or less corrupt or predatory
practices).

Apart from causing a negative demographic shock to the affected
populations, the Black Death appears to have caused further indirect
demographic changes, particularly in Western Europe. The increased
employment opportunities for females caused by worker shortages and a
higher female labour demand led to a decline in fertility rates and an
increased age of marriage (Voigtländer and Voth 2013b). This demographic
transition to a population characterized by lower birth rates likely
helped to preserve the high levels of per capita incomes and contributed
to further economic development of certain parts of Europe, enabling it
to escape the "Malthusian trap" in the following centuries (Pamuk 2007).
Siuda and Sunde (2021) confirm the pandemic's effect on the accelerated
demographic transition empirically, as they find that greater pandemic
mortality was associated with an earlier onset of the demographic
transition across the various regions of Germany.

Unfortunately, the Black Death also led to an increase in the
persecution of Jews (Finley and Koyama 2018; Jedwab et al. 2019a).
Interestingly, Jedwab et al. (2019a) were able to estimate that in the
case of regions with the highest mortality rates, the probability of
persecution decreased if the Jewish minority was believed to benefit the
local economy.

It is important to highlight that the long-term repercussions of the
Black Death were highly asymmetrical. While in Western Europe the
pandemic appears to have led to some long-term dynamic shifts associated
with increased wages, decreased inequality and a decrease in labour
coercion, this was not the case for other regions. A decrease in wages
was observed for example in Spain (Alfani 2020) and Egypt. In Spain, the
plague\'s demographic impact on an already scarce population caused a
long-lasting negative disruption to the local trade-oriented economy.
The workforce disruption in Egypt led to a collapse of the
labour-intensive irrigation system for growing crops in the Nile valley,
with consequent disastrous effects on the rural economy (Alfani 2020).
Borsch (2005) argues that the economic decline in Egypt caused by the
Black Death "put an end to the power in the heartland of the Arab world"
(p. 114) and to the impressive scientific and technological developments
that came out of this region.

A consensus for an explanation of the Black Death's varied impacts
across regions, and their determinants, does not appear to exist.
However, several researchers attempt to provide partial insights. For
example, Alfani (2020) considers the differential outcomes to be broadly
dependent upon the initial conditions in each region. More specifically,
both Robinson and Torvik (2011) and Pamuk (2007) propose that the
asymmetry of impacts can largely be explained by the differences in the
institutional environments of the affected societies.

It is argued that the Black Death defined the threshold between the
medieval and the modern ages, similarly to the way the Justinian Plague
did for antiquity and the Middle Ages (Horden 2021). Furthermore, the
differential long-term outcomes of the Black Death likely provided a
significant contribution to the so-called "Great Divergence" between
Europe and the rest of the world and the "Little Divergence" between
North-western and Southern and Eastern Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
2007).

From this perspective, it would seem rational to conclude that apart
from causing substantial and long-term demographic, economic, political,
and cultural changes, both the Justinian Plague and the Black Death
likely significantly altered the course of human history.

Considering the above, it is not unreasonable to expect that a pandemic
of a similar magnitude to these past catastrophes would do the same in
the present day. However, what societal impacts a pandemic of similar or
higher mortality would inflict in the twenty-first century has not
really been the subject of any study, as far as we were able to
identify. A possibility exists, given the newly developed capacity of
humanity to create new pathogens, that the outcomes of a future
catastrophic pandemic will be even more adverse than those of the
Justinian Plague and the Black Death.

For most of human history, natural pandemics have posed the greatest

believe that [natural pandemics

permafrost" 8 January 2025
https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/msystems.00042-24

PERMAFROST VIRUSES WITH MICROBIAL HOSTS Giant viruses in permafrost In
contrast to the viruses causing smallpox and influenza, numerous giant
viruses have been revived from late Pleistocene-aged permafrost (31,
92). These giant viruses infect Acanthamoeba (31), a genus of amoeba
that is broadly distributed in both natural and built environments (93,
94). Beyond permafrost, giant viruses have a widespread global
distribution and can infect amoebae and other protist hosts such as
algae (95--98). Their persistence in permafrost likely stems from a wide
range of virus and host adaptations to extreme conditions (86). Giant
virus capsids are incredibly stable (99), and their outer walls are
comparable in thickness to Gram-positive bacterial cell walls (100),
which enable the viruses to retain infectivity after exposure to
chemicals, desiccation, and extremes in temperature, pH, and salinity
(85, 101--103). Beyond the robust viral structure, Acanthamoeba hosts
may offer protection against extreme conditions (104). Acanthamoeba form
rugged double-walled cysts (105--108) and may also have freeze-resistant
non-encysted forms with low levels of metabolic activity (109).
Encystment of an infected cell or maintenance of an infection in a
non-encysted state could facilitate virus survival and enable
reemergence when permafrost thaws. Human pathogenic viruses are
comparatively fragile and are not protected from extreme conditions by a
cold-adapted host. Even variola virus, which can survive outside a host
for several years in scabs and lesion crusts (often collected for
variolation efforts) and is known for being stable (110), does not
appear to survive for a few hundred years in permafrost (15, 54), let
alone thousands of years as seen in giant viruses. Together, these data
suggest that [the persistence of giant viruses in permafrost is not a
reliable indicator of the ability of human viral pathogens to likewise
survive in permafrost.]{.underline} Giant viruses have been associated
with conditions in humans, such as pneumonia and keratitis, leading to
questions about their potential to cause disease (111, 112). However,
amoebae that host giant viruses are also present in such cases. These
amoebae either directly cause disease (e.g., Acanthamoeba keratitis
\[113\]) or play a crucial role in infections, such as facilitating the
transmission of Legionella pneumophila in respiratory illness (114).
[There is no evidence of a causal link between giant viruses and
disease]{.underline} (37). The absence of such connections strongly
[suggests that giant viruses are unable to infect humans
directly]{.underline}. [Associations]{.underline} between giant virues
and humans [are probably incidental, caused by viruses co-occurring with
thier amoeba hosts]{.underline} (93, 99, 102, 107). Other microbial
viruses in permafrost In addition to giant amoeba-infecting viruses,
permafrost (like other soils) contains diverse viral communities with
bacterial, archaeal, and other microeukaryotic hosts (9, 115--117).
Stable isotope probing, RNA sequencing, and thaw experiments show that
at least a subset of these viruses maintain viability and can be active
at subzero temperatures (10, 118). In extreme environments, including
permafrost, viruses can have multiple survival mechanisms, such as
increased virion (viral particle) stability and integrity, auxiliary
metabolic genes that aid host survival in cold conditions, and the
ability to integrate their genetic material into the host genome,
allowing the virus to coexist within a (cold adapted) host in a
quiescent state (11, 12, 119--121). Potential for viruses with microbial
hosts to spillover to humans and animals [The theoretical risk posed by
permafrost viruses with microbial hosts to human populations can be
evaluated by exploring the origin]{.underline} and evolution [of
pathogenic viruses]{.underline} and examining whether there is precedent
for microbial viruses spilling over to humans or animals. Host jumps
between closely related species are common at evolutionary timescales;
61% of human pathogens and 75% of emerging human pathogens have zoonotic
origins (122). The likelihood of successful host jumping decreases as
the phylogenetic distance between hosts increases (123--125). [Viruses
bind specifically to molecules on the host cell surface, rely on the
host's cellular machinery for replication, and must evade the host's
immune system]{.underline} (126--128). As a result, [they are typically
highly adapted to specific hosts and can only "work" in hosts with
similar molecular pathways]{.underline} (129, 130). [Given the large
phylogenetic distance between soil microbes and humans, such a **shift
would be extraordinarily unlikely, if not impossible.**]{.underline}
Investigating the origins of human pathogenic viruses shows that
microorganisms are not a source of spillovers. The majority of zoonotic
viruses (\>80%) are from mammals, while the remaining \~20% are
primarily from birds (87, 124, 131, 132). Instances of viruses infecting
both humans and other vertebrates, such as reptiles, are rare (131, 133,
134). Non-zoonotic viruses, such as papillomaviruses and herpesviruses,
which are host specific, offer insights into potential host jumps in the
more distant past. For these viruses, the host phylogenetic tree roughly
mirrors the viral phylogenetic tree (135--137). For example, human
papillomaviruses are most closely related to papillomaviruses with
non-human primate hosts, and the phylogenetic distance between viruses
increases with evolutionary distance between hosts (136, 138, 139).
These evolutionary relationships can largely be attributed to
co-speciation between virus and host and occasional instances of
interspecies virus transfer (135, 137, 140). However, there is no
evidence to support a microbial origin for these viruses (135, 137, 139,
141, 142). [The lack of precedent for microbial viruses jumping to human
or animal hosts suggests this scenario is unlikely to arise from thawing
permafrost.]{.underline} Humans are constantly exposed to an enormous
diversity of viruses from the environment. Viruses are crucial members
of all Earth's ecosystems (143), and soils are perhaps the largest viral
reservoir on Earth (144). In some soils, viral abundance can exceed more
than one billion per gram, and similar counts are found per gram of
human intestinal content (144--146). [Billions of viruses can be
swallowed during a swim in the sea]{.underline} (147, 148). [Despite
th]{.underline}is constant bombardment, **[there is no indication that
microbe-infecting viruses represent a major disease risk for humans,
wildlife, or domestic animals]{.underline}** (87). Research,
surveillance, and prevention strategies aimed at mitigating the risk and
impact of future pandemics do not identify these viruses as potential
threats (90, 149, 150). [**There is no reason to think** **that viruses
from permafrost represent a greater risk** for spillover than viruses
maintained in other environments such as temperate soils and aquatic
systems.]{.underline}

WILDLIFE AND DOMESTIC ANIMAL HOSTS Reintroduction of a virus from
thawing animal remains or water and soil that previously served as
wildlife habitat could have potentially deleterious impacts on non-human
animal populations. Human populations could be affected if the pathogen
is able to shift hosts. [There is,]{.underline} however, [no precedent
for a domestic animal or wildlife disease outbreak following emergence
of a viral pathogen from frozen soils]{.underline}, [nor]{.underline}
recognized [events where viruses]{.underline} [from]{.underline}
recently [thawed permafrost caused zoonotic disease]{.underline}. This
does not mean that such a scenario is impossible, but it does imply that
it is improbable. The closest example, specifically the 2016 anthrax
outbreak, was caused by an environmentally resistant endospore-forming
bacterium rather than a virus, and it is still unclear whether thawing
permafrost was a causative factor (22). [Pathogenic viruses in animal
remains face the same degradative processes that compromise influenza
and variola viruses in permafrost]{.underline}, as described in previous
sections. Delays between death and entombment in permafrost, nucleic
acid damage that accumulates over time, and exposure to freeze--thaw
cycles cause the degradation of viral particles, limiting the potential
for viable virus to persist in animal remains (59--62). [Damage begins
to occur almost immediately after death]{.underline} (59), [causing a
rapid decline in the number of infectious viral particles]{.underline}
(63--65). A few exceptionally well-preserved animal specimens show
evidence of immediate burial in permafrost or ice (66, 67), but the
[majority exhibit signs of delay between death and the point of
preservation]{.underline} (e.g., tissue destruction, partial
decomposition, or dismemberment) (68--72). [Though permafrost slows
nucleic acid degradation, **significant damage still occurs in the form
fragmentation, crosslinking, and lesion accumulation**]{.underline}
(62). DNA extracted from ancient faunal remains contains a mix DNA from
the animal itself, microorganisms (including viruses) present at the
time of death, and microorganisms introduced postmortem (59, 73, 74).
This [DNA is typically highly fragmented]{.underline}, usually [less
than a few hundred base pairs in length but often much
smaller]{.underline} (73--77). [RNA]{.underline}, when recoverable[, is
even more degraded]{.underline} (78). Even remains preserved soon after
death experience nucleic acid damage (79, 80), which accumulates over
time (59). [Most well-preserved animal specimens found in
permafrost]{.underline} [date back to the late Pleistocene]{.underline}
(between 11,700 and 129,000 years ago) and early Holocene (between 8,200
and 11,700 years ago) (68, 81, 82). [These timeframes exceed the
expected survival of fully intact nucleic acids from viral and other
microbial sources]{.underline} unless they are protected by
stress-resistant forms (e.g., capsids that shield against harsh
extracellular environments or cysts) or they have low levels of
metabolic activity that enable DNA repair (79, 83, 84). Unlike viruses
associated with microbial hosts in permafrost (discussed in the next
section), [animal viruses lack adaptations to the permafrost
environment]{.underline} and do not have the protection of a
cold-adapted host that can perform DNA repair or enter dormancy (11, 79,
83, 85, 86). In stark contrast to the hypothetical risk posed by viruses
from thawing permafrost, viruses circulating among wild and domestic
animals have repeatedly jumped into human hosts, causing disease
outbreaks. Examples include the viruses causing coronavirus disease
2019, Ebola, and avian influenza (87--89). This suggests that risks of
disease outbreaks from viruses of animal origin are much more likely to
stem from contact with extant wildlife (direct or indirect) in the
Arctic and subarctic rather than emergence from permafrost (90, 91).

[has received]{.underline} immense and [improper attention]{.underline}
(31, 163). [The term]{.underline} zombie pathogen [is]{.underline}
typically [shorthand]{.underline} [for a pathogen]{.underline} from the
past [that has been preserved in permafrost and could become active and
cause human disease]{.underline} when released by thaw. As we discuss
here, **[this outcome is highly unlikely]{.underline}**, and yet [the
term]{.underline} zombie virus [is used to elicit an apocalyptic fear
response in the reader]{.underline}, often [to grab
headlines.]{.underline} It is not well known, and thus important to
examine, that [the zombie fantasy has origins in the racist past against
people of color]{.underline}, particularly in North America and the
Caribbean (164, 165). [It originated from the dehumanizing violence
against Haitian slaves]{.underline} in the 17th century, born of Vodou
folklore but [then modified and used as a means of control and
oppression]{.underline} (166). It was later made popular in horror
movies containing escapist end-time fantasy (166, 167). Because of its
racist origins, [this mythology perpetuates the idea that "invaders"
that are unlike us are coming to destroy our world]{.underline} [and
that destruction is imminent and fast moving]{.underline} (168). Despite
the collective interest in zombies, it is important to note its cultural
origin so that the concept can be more easily put aside as fiction,
rather than a scientific metaphor. [The word's use]{.underline} in
scientific literature is unhelpful, provides only titillating headlines,
and **unconsciously [supports a narrative of xenophobic fear of things
we do not understand]{.underline}** (169).

to U.S.--China Relations: Reversing the Slide Toward Crisis and
Conflict,\"

Core Restraint Views A Restraint approach to U.S.--China relations is
founded upon and reflects several overall views and assumptions
regarding both vital American national interests and policies and
several key features of the international system. One core Restraint set
of views is that [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} unnecessarily
[[**over-extended** in]{.mark} its **[military involvement]{.mark}**
across the globe]{.underline}, has an excessively broad definition of
its vital interests, [[and too frequently relies on
**military**]{.underline}]{.mark} over diplomatic
**[[means]{.underline}]{.mark}** to defend those interests while seeking
to maintain, to the maximum extent possible, economic and military
dominance worldwide and to extend democracy to as many nations as
possible.2 A second Restraint view that follows from the above is the
notion that post--Cold War [[efforts to maintain]{.mark} U.S. global
**military [primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, whether **[[emphasizing
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** or active intervention, have most
often [**[produce]{.mark}**d [a]{.mark} **more dangerous**, **[less
stable world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby undermining the most vital
U.S. interest of safeguarding the security and well--being of the
American people.3 The United States is physically very secure behind two
oceans and with two friendly neighbors on its borders, and in any event
has the capability, through nuclear weapons and a territory--based
conventional power projection capability, to counter any direct or
indirect military threats to its most vital interests. The definition of
[vital national interests]{.underline} should thus be limited to the
defense and preservation of conditions directly necessary to the
territorial integrity, security, and well--being of the American people
and their way of life. This primarily requires the ability to protect
the nation against both direct and indirect, national, transnational,
and subnational threats to such interests, and a stable global order
open, as much as possible, to trade, investment, technological
innovation, and people--to--people contacts. It also requires
co--existence with countries with different political systems, congruent
with a stable and open global order. Above all, it requires a strong and
cohesive domestic political, economic, and social order. It [does
**not** require]{.underline} absolute security, the maintenance of [a
prominent global military presence,]{.underline} a reliance on [frequent
overseas military forays,]{.underline} [or]{.underline} extensive,
formal, often **[one--sided, security commitments]{.underline}** to a
wide range of other nations. A third Restraint viewpoint stresses the
fact that [the international system]{.underline} within which the United
States defends or advances its interests [is **no longer
unipolar**]{.underline}.4 The conditions that elevated the United States
to the status of global hegemon after the fall of the Soviet Union in
1991 no longer exist and cannot be restored. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has no]{.underline} practical [alternative but to
accept the reality of an increasingly multipolar world and recognize
that]{.underline} both **[continued U.S. dominance]{.underline}** and
world peace [are **illusions**]{.underline}. For the foreseeable future,
[mutual coexistence, compromise, and balance among the great powers will
have to suffice]{.underline} as an operative conception of "peace."5
This concept thus rejects the use of distorting and dangerous, usually
zero--sum ideological frameworks in understanding global politics, such
as "democracy versus authoritarianism," or a singular stress on "great
power competition."6 The Restraint view holds that, within this system,
[two **existential**]{.underline} or near--existential international
[**threats** endanger humankind]{.underline} above all else in the
present century: [first]{.underline}, the increased possibility of
large--scale **[nuclear war]{.underline}** ([as a result of]{.underline}
proliferation, new technologies, the erosion of arms control agreements,
and [deepening great power rivalries]{.underline}); [and
second]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} largely
**[unchecked]{.underline}** worsening of the **[climate
crisis]{.underline}** as the preeminent expression of global
environmental degradation.7 A third threat is primarily domestic and
mostly affects democratic states, although it certainly also has
international implications: the rise of extremely nationalist,
anti--democratic, race--based nativism and the political polarization
and dysfunction it engenders.8 For Restraint advocates, these threats
supersede any supposed global, value--based threats, including the
commonly perceived inflated and distorted international struggle between
democracy and authoritarianism, as well as narrower, conventional
security or economic rivalries among non--nuclear powers. In assessing
the role of diplomacy (and other non--military forms of international
engagement and conflict resolution) versus military force, despite the
introduction of new technologies, Restrainers believe that military
conflict remains fraught with risk, uncertainty, higher than expected
costs, and the likelihood of unexpected consequences. This fact, along
with the gradual emergence of a multipolar order and the frequent
historical failures of U.S.--led attempts to invade, occupy, and remake
distant nation--states, provide good reasons to prioritize diplomacy and
economic or other forms of non--violent tools of statecraft over
military intervention.9 While the political use of military capabilities
is in many cases essential in the conduct of diplomacy, any actual use
of force should be considered a last resort, employed only under extreme
conditions, and in the defense of vital interests only. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, as the
dominant military and economic power on the planet, [has
[developed]{.mark} and maintained [the **dangerous notion**]{.mark} that
only [American]{.mark} global **[primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
"leadership" [[can keep the world **peaceful**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
ensure prosperity.10 Restrainers believe [this idea has led the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to engage]{.underline}
frequently [in]{.underline} a [**feckless misuse** of military
power]{.underline}, [resulting]{.underline} in large part [from
**inflated threats**]{.underline}, overconfidence, and a deep belief in
American exceptionalism. With the possible exception of Israel, [[**no
nation** employs force as frequently]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover,
many Americans remain strongly supportive of high levels of U.S. defense
spending and Washington's many global security alliances. However, many
[citizens are]{.underline} also [growing weary of U.S. military
interventions and]{.underline} the heavy [reliance on **military**
**options**]{.underline} in handling foreign problems.11 Large numbers
of Americans now favor diplomacy over military force.12 And some
question the need for large numbers of overseas military bases around
the world.13 This suggests popular support for a Restraint--oriented
foreign policy, including reduced defense spending if and as security
competitions with other great powers are reduced. Compounding the
problems caused by military intervention in the service of primacy is
the emergence in the United States of deep levels of public uncertainty
and insecurity about the future. The many factors underlying this
feeling of uncertainty include a crisis of legitimacy involving
widespread dissatisfaction with prevailing conceptions of freedom and
democracy when viewed through the lens of race, gender, and sexuality,
as well as egregious government ineptitude, fiscal irresponsibility, and
persistent social problems.14 Politicians often exploit the worsening
domestic situation by inflating the threats posed by undemocratic states
like China to divert attention from their own responsibility for
problems at home and to unify their political base.15 Domestic
circumstances have also created a strong tendency toward an excessive
level of economic protectionism which, in the absence of countervailing
domestic policies, undermines growth and weakens incentives to cooperate
with China and other nations in handling common global economic and
financial threats.16 Restrainers assert that this dynamic, along with a
deeply--rooted commitment to sustaining high levels of defense spending
and hundreds of overseas bases, are increasing the chance of conflict
with non--democratic powers while undermining efforts to properly
define, prioritize and deal with threats at home and abroad.17 Finally,
many U.S. [friends and allies have]{.underline} both [the capacity and
the need to do **far more** to provide for their **own
defense**]{.underline}, thereby [allowing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to significantly reduce its **own global military
posture**]{.underline}. But Restraint does not encourage those countries
to rapidly ramp up their defense spending. Deepening interdependence,
the possibility of large--scale nuclear war, and the emergence of high
priority common security threats such as climate change all argue in
favor of efforts to reduce interstate security competition, which would
lower the need for ever higher defense budgets, and enhance incentives
for more cooperative forms of security.18 If successfully implemented,
[**[Restraint]{.mark}** as a basis of policy]{.underline} vis--à--vis
China [[will **buy**]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[**time** to]{.mark} repair its]{.underline}
severely [damaged domestic order and **[reallocate]{.mark}** national
security [resources]{.mark}]{.underline} to concerns that pose a greater
threat to the security and well--being of the American people than
China. More broadly, [[it will facilitate]{.mark} the identification of
**clear red lines**]{.underline} based on the protection of genuinely
vital interests, the adoption of prudent and balanced approaches to
contentious issues, [and]{.underline} the opening of intellectual and
political space allowing for **[greater
[dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}**, understanding, [[and
**compromise**]{.mark} between Washington and Beijing]{.underline}.19
[[This will]{.mark} significantly **[reduce]{.mark} the chances of
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Urgent Need to Right--Size the
China Threat Multipolarity and the end of American dominance, rising
domestic problems, looming, high--priority transnational threats, heavy
levels of global economic and technological interdependence, and the
resulting need to create a stable long--term basis for productive and
peaceful coexistence together justify an array of Restraint--based U.S.
policies toward Beijing. This must begin with a serious effort to
right--size the threats and opportunities that China poses, both now and
over time, to the international system, American democracy, economic
growth, and U.S. national security.20 Right--sizing the threats posed by
China, along with a fact--based assessment of current and likely future
U.S. and Western resources and capabilities, will provide the foundation
for a realistic and effective Restraint--based strategy toward China. A
responsible Restraint perspective acknowledges that there are
competitive aspects to the Sino--U.S. relationship, and that a
Sino--U.S. security dilemma, along with low levels of trust, is to some
extent unavoidable, especially given the different political systems of
the two nations and China's growing power, both globally and especially
in Asia. However, the security dilemma can certainly be alleviated
significantly, and not all great power competition need be zero--sum in
nature. Furthermore, most Sino--U.S. competitions will not end in a neat
"victory" for one side over the other, unless one or both regimes
collapse, an unlikely prospect. Excessive levels and types of
competition can unnecessarily undermine attempts at cooperation over
issues such as climate change, as trust disappears and the good will
needed to fashion mutual compromises evaporates.21 [The current U.S.
[policy toward China is]{.mark} largely [based on a]{.mark}
**zero--sum**, **[adversarial mindset]{.mark}** that assumes above all
else a **fundamental Chinese commitment** to **weakening** and
**countering the West**]{.underline} and resisting any form of
meaningful bilateral cooperation. [Beijing is regularly presented as a
vaguely--defined **existential threat**]{.underline}, a rapidly growing
military and economic power [bent on **global domination**]{.underline}
through predatory trade and investment practices and/or armed coercion,
a burgeoning high--tech superpower determined to control the key drivers
of future global growth, a hostile opponent of the existing so--called
"rules--based" international order, and a pernicious threat to
democratic societies from within.22 Moreover, in many instances, the
alarm over such supposedly dire threats is magnified by the inaccurate
claim that Washington had been essentially asleep at the wheel until
very recently as China worked to undermine the United States and all
democratic societies.23 China does pose certain challenges to existing
and likely future U.S. interests. These consist primarily of: • In the
military arena, the danger of costly and destabilizing conflicts or
severe crises, resulting from military and political provocations by
either Beijing or Washington (or by U.S. allies) e.g., over Taiwan,
disputed territories in Asia, the Korean Peninsula, or as a result of
incidents involving U.S. and Chinese ships and aircraft operating in
close proximity to one another.24 Chinese military and political actions
could also weaken U.S. alliances and reduce support for the
forward--deployed U.S. military presence in Asia and elsewhere, thereby
increasing the likelihood of arms races and miscalculations by the
United States, China, and other states.25 • In the economic and
technological area,26 the possibility of Chinese behavior eroding U.S.
economic growth rates, U.S. competitiveness in some key high--tech
areas, and possibly, in some extreme cases, U.S. access to certain
technologies and critical regions, most notably Asia. Chinese actions in
this area could also reduce the incentives for other nations to trade
and invest heavily with the United States, whether as a result of
Chinese pressure or zero--sum forms of competitiveness. China could
weaken free market norms in various ways, through its loan practices and
political influence. And Beijing could damage key U.S. corporations by
ejecting them from the critical Chinese market. • In the area of norms
and values, a concern that Chinese behavior over time could weaken
existing Western norms regarding liberal democratic governance, centered
on the rule of law, freedom of political speech and behavior, various
cyber freedoms, and individual voter rights, as well as current or
future norms concerning forms of foreign international intervention
relating to human rights. China challenges many of these norms by
stressing economic and physical security and top-down state authority
over the protection of individual political freedoms and the activities
of non-state actors outside of government control. While certainly very
troublesome, and requiring effective countermeasures in many cases,
[these concerns are not grave enough to justify the kind of absolute,
largely **zero--sum** and **confrontational approach** now common in
U.S. policies toward Beijing]{.underline}. Many [**gray areas** exist in
all three of the above realms, largely reflecting Chinese support for
long--standing core principles of the international order, such as
**state sovereignty**, a preference for **diplomacy** over
**force**]{.underline} in resolving disputes, [the use of force only in
defense of **imminent**]{.underline} and clear **[security
threats]{.underline}**, [open]{.underline} air and sea [lines of
communication]{.underline} and transport across international zones,
many [market--based forms of economic intercourse]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} various other **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations **[norms]{.underline}** and approaches. In
fact, critics of China's global stance often conflate the values and
norms of the global order, as reflected in various international regimes
and practices, with the U.S.--centered structure of global economic and
military power.27 In reality, the preservation or constructive
adaptation of most of the values, structures, and processes of the
global order does not require a single, dominant, democratic ruling
power. The limited and contingent nature of Chinese threats requires a
strong, competitive United States, clearer, more extensive, and to the
extent possible, binding bilateral and international agreements, and
specific, credible red lines regarding violations of truly vital
interests. It also requires a common international commitment to resolve
differences over contentious issues such as Taiwan, political rights and
protectionism or state capitalism through negotiation and compromise.
[Contrary to the prevailing mindset]{.underline} in Washington, [China
does not pose an **existential**]{.underline} or near--existential
**[threat to the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates in the
above areas. [It is not in a position]{.underline} either to replace the
dominance of U.S. and Western economic and military power worldwide or
[to **overturn**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} so--called
**[liberal]{.underline}** world **[order]{.underline}**.28 As a military
power, Beijing poses no threat to the existence of the United States
except possibly via an extremely unlikely nuclear attack, which would be
suicidal. There is no evidence that China wants to threaten, much less
use, its relatively small (but growing), second--strike, counter--value
strategic nuclear force to attack the United States or its allies. To
the contrary, there is much evidence to suggest that [China's leadership
regards nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s]{.underline} predominantly [as a
**deterrent**, not as a possible first--strike, offensive war
weapon]{.underline}.29 Moreover, Beijing's recent improvements of its
strategic nuclear forces are almost certainly intended primarily to
increase the survivability of its second--strike force in the face of
significant improvements in U.S. offensive nuclear capabilities and
ballistic missile defense. [The Chinese might]{.underline} also [be
expanding their nuclear arsenal in response to an increased fear that
Washington would]{.underline} level [nuclear threats or]{.underline}
actually [employ tactical nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} a future [Taiwan]{.underline} conflict, if the U.S.
military were losing on a conventional level.30 That speaks to the
urgent need to stabilize that worsening situation (as discussed below).
On the conventional level, Chinese military capabilities are for the
foreseeable future only of serious concern in the western Pacific, where
Beijing has reached a rough parity of forces with the United States and
Japan along the first island chain near Taiwan, and is arguably now the
dominant military power in the South China Sea, as measured in numbers
of naval and air platforms.31 But even in this vast region, [China is
not poised to acquire the kind of overwhelming conventional power that
would give it the military confidence]{.underline}, even in the face of
high political and economic costs, [to attempt to **seize Taiwan by
force**]{.underline}, [eject the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [from the region, or assert total]{.underline},
direct [control over the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea or maritime Asia as a whole --- unless, that is, the
United States were to force it to undertake the acquisition of such
capabilities and take such actions by threatening to permanently
separate Taiwan from China, or by precipitating a conflict in the
region.32 [Fears that China]{.underline} has decided in the near or
medium future to invade Taiwan and, going further, [is
planning]{.underline} eventual [aggression against other Asian states
are]{.underline} therefore **[unconvincing]{.underline}**.33 [The
lessons of]{.underline} the U.S. invasion of [**Iraq** and]{.underline}
particularly Russia's failures in [**Ukraine** reinforce for the Chinese
the difficulties of]{.underline} an all--out **[invasion of
Taiwan]{.underline}**, as discussed further in the appendix.34 Beyond
this, [[China is **nowhere near** acquiring]{.mark} the [capabilities to
replace the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates as
a global military hegemon and shows few if any signs of having made a
commitment to do so.35 [This would require a force structure capable of
successfully fending off any attempt to defeat Chinese military
components within]{.underline} virtually [**any** ocean or air
space]{.underline}, and to safeguard passage to virtually any major
world port. The United States has enjoyed something approaching this
capacity for decades. [China is **far from attaining it** and currently
has **no clear imperative** to do so.]{.underline} This does not mean
China will eschew developing a military with a significant global
presence. It has already done this to some extent in the naval realm.
And Chinese leaders have said that their goal is to develop "world-class
forces" by 2049.36 But such a presence could take many forms well below
anything approaching that of the U.S. military today, including
relatively small--sized, high--quality flotillas or expeditionary groups
capable of conducting a variety of important missions well short of
achieving control overall critical international ocean areas and air
spaces.37 The above suggests that [China is unlikely to undertake an
**unprovoked**]{.underline}, out--of--the--blue **[lunge at
Taiwan]{.underline}**, [or **anywhere else** in the region]{.underline},
either today or in the near--to--medium---term (i.e., to about 2035).
[[The **most prominent threat** will emerge from
**miscalc**]{.mark}**ulations**]{.underline} [[stemming from efforts by
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates, China,
and other nations [[to **deter**]{.underline}]{.mark} one another [in an
**extreme**]{.underline}, zero--sum [manner within a]{.underline}n
increasingly [**hostile** and **polarized** security landscape. [This
could involve]{.mark} a high--risk miscalculation and]{.underline}
resulting **[[overreaction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the use of
military force]{.underline} by one or both sides [[stemming
from]{.underline}]{.mark} excessive [[**overconfidence** or
**insecurity**, in response to]{.mark} perceived
**[provocations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, [the
primary]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**--related
**[threat]{.underline}** is not about the threat Beijing poses to the
United States, other nations, or the global order. It is the threat that
[arises from an interactive, **worsening security
competition**]{.underline} driven by threat inflation and zero--sum
worst casing of actions and motives on both sides.38 Moreover, [the
Chinese]{.underline} almost [certainly realize that any effort to
achieve]{.underline} global (or even regional) **[military
dominance]{.underline}** over the United States [will prove]{.underline}
extremely **[costly]{.underline}**, [could]{.underline} ultimately
[**fail**, or place it in a]{.underline} virtually
[endless]{.underline}, mutually debilitating zero--sum [military
rivalry]{.underline} with Washington. [This]{.underline} sort of gamble
i[s even more unlikely given the **enormous domestic challenges** that
[China faces]{.mark}, including]{.underline} high levels of
[[**pollution**, a]{.underline}]{.mark} rapidly **[[aging
population]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a weakened leadership succession
system, [[limited]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic natural
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [low]{.underline} levels of
[productivity]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} an excessively
ideological, **[repressive]{.underline}**, and top--down
[policy]{.underline} approach to [development]{.underline} and social
order.39 [[These]{.mark} challenges [demand]{.mark} a
continuous]{.underline}, long--term [[emphasis on]{.underline}]{.mark}
ensuring [**[domestic order]{.mark}** and **growth**, not expanding
China's powers to **dominate**]{.underline} all
**[others]{.underline}**. All this implies that, despite its ambitious
goals, likely belief that the West is in decline, and increasing
suspicion and pushback toward the United States, [Beijing's policies
will]{.underline} necessarily [allow]{.underline} for some level of
[flexibility that could make]{.underline} global (and even Asian)
[competition more constructive and less destructive]{.underline}, while
keeping many doors open to some level of meaningful cooperation between
the two powers, including in the military--security arena. It is
certainly not inconceivable that growing threats to China's sea lines of
communication (SLOCs) and overseas economic and political interests
could one day cause China's leaders to fundamentally reassess the
nation's strategic interests and goals in the direction of a costly,
dominance--oriented military strategy. Nonetheless, it would be reckless
to assume that such a reassessment is inevitable and that the many
factors in favor of cooperation and balance in China's present--day
global (and regional) strategy will disappear. Indeed, [the huge costs
and risks involved in a Chinese attempt to displace the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates as the dominant global military
power [are unlikely to diminish to such a degree]{.underline} in the
decades ahead [that Beijing would conclude it is worth the
effort]{.underline} to undertake --- **[unless]{.underline}**, of
course, [Washington makes it clear that it is using its]{.underline}
global [military dominance]{.underline} to support efforts [to
**strangle China** and **threaten the stability** of its
**government**]{.underline}.40 In the economic and technological arenas,
blanket, unqualified characterizations of China's economy as "predatory"
or "mercantilist" and its loan and assistance programs as
"debt--inducing" distort the reality that some Chinese abuses exist
alongside huge levels of mutual economic benefit for many countries.41
Moreover, China poses a limited, not comprehensive and existential,
economic and technological threat to the United States, in the form of
commercial and technology theft (of which at least the latter is
apparently diminishing), unfair trading practices, and other activities
that result in unfair advantages or possibly dominance in some specific
areas.42 It is highly unlikely that such practices would result in
decisive Chinese leverage over the United States, given the likelihood
of continued American global economic and technological power and
expertise, based on the continuation of its high--quality higher
education system, its rule of law, its competitive energy and drive, its
overall receptivity to talented immigrants, and its ample domestic
resource base.43 All of these features urgently need strengthening. But
this places an even greater premium on reducing distracting and
destructive tensions with China. And in any event, America's advantages
are unlikely to diminish to such an extent that China will achieve
decisive leverage over the United States, given its own huge domestic
problems. There is also the threat that would result from excessive
decoupling of the United States and China in many economic and
technological areas. Such actions would produce high levels of
inefficiency, lower the benefits of global exchange, and create
excessive confidence in the quixotic goal of removing all
vulnerabilities to the U.S. economy.44 As a result, U.S. (and Chinese)
economic growth and resiliency would decline, along with overall global
growth and prosperity. In addition, it is virtually certain that [any
effort by Beijing to create a **Sino-centric**]{.underline}, hegemonic
regional (or global) [**order** would encounter **serious
resistance**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} many other [major
states]{.underline} aside from the United States (such as Japan, South
Korea, India, Germany, France, and the U.K.), many of
[which]{.underline} have or could muster considerable economic and
military capabilities and [would]{.underline} politically and
ideologically [**oppose** being dominated by an **autocratic
China**]{.underline}. Although these states could not counterbalance
Chinese aggression on their own, they would likely unify to greatly
augment a U.S. effort to do so, if necessary.45 Regarding global norms,
despite assertions by some to the contrary, [China is **not
committed**]{.underline} (and does not have the capability) [to
**overturn**]{.underline} what many describe as [the **global
order**]{.underline}, replacing it with an autocratic, mercantilist,
Sinocentric order.46 First, this argument relies on the false notion
that such an order is centered primarily, if not solely, on the three
principles of democracy, human rights, and a free market economic
system. In reality, [the global order consists of a wide array of
norm--based regimes and understandings]{.underline}, only some of which
are associated with Western--defined concepts.47 Moreover, numerous
studies have shown that [[Beijing **benefits from** and
**upholds**]{.mark} the goals and **[norms]{.mark}** of many of these
regimes]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those governing relatively
[**[free trade]{.mark}** and finance]{.underline}, weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) **[prolif]{.underline}**eration, [[freedom of
**navigation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the **[[peaceful
resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of disputes, [and]{.underline} the
management of [transnational security threats]{.underline} China presses
for reforms in global institutions that are, in many cases, long
overdue, including the idea of providing greater representation for
China and developing states in multilateral economic organizations.48
Beijing does want to reduce the influence of Western liberal democratic
values within global regimes in favor of a more state--centered set of
views that reflect the values of economic growth, top--down political
control, limited political freedoms, and social order. However, despite
some American rhetoric to the contrary, [Beijing is not energetically
engaged in a deliberate effort to duplicate its system across the
world]{.underline}, nor poised to establish a predatory, debt--inducing
network of dominance across Eurasia via the Belt and Road Initiative.49
In fact, unlike many 19th and early 20th century imperialist powers,
with some limited exceptions during the revolutionary Mao Zedong era in
the 1970s, [China has **not espoused an ideology** or **mindset** that
views the **acquisition of other territories** or the coercive expansion
of its system]{.underline} to other countries [as essential]{.underline}
to its continued national vitality.50 Finally[, the so--called global
order is rapidly becoming a multipolar order that **no single country**
can **dominate**]{.underline} in most or all spheres.51 Hence, even if
Beijing wanted to create a Sinocentric order, it is extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to see how they could make this happen. Despite the
above developments and conflicting interests, Beijing continues to
recognize its own need to sustain substantive areas of cooperation with
Washington and to avoid slipping into a truly adversarial, destructive,
and purely mercantilist form of competition. While increasingly
assertive, the Chinese see the obvious problems of such a stance. Of
course, it is possible that Beijing eventually comes to regard the high
risks of engaging in such intense competition as worth taking, if the
danger of not doing so increases. Such a change in perception could
occur in part as a result of [[a]{.mark} continued U.S.]{.underline} or
broader Western [[drive toward]{.mark} **[confrontation]{.mark}** and
**zero--sum competition** with Beijing.]{.underline} This development
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} greatly
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** those [[voices within China who
favor **moderation**]{.mark} in the **U.S.--China
rivalry**]{.underline}. In addition [it would]{.underline} significantly
[[**raise the danger** of Sino--American **crises**]{.mark} and
**military conflict**]{.underline}, [[and divert]{.mark}
**[huge]{.mark}** amounts of U.S. [**resources** away from]{.mark}
**desperately needed**]{.underline} non--military **[uses at
[home]{.mark}]{.underline}** and abroad.52 The Key Elements of a
Restraint Approach to China From the above, it is clear that
[a]{.underline} responsible [Restraint strategy toward China
should]{.underline} seek to [[replace]{.mark} the]{.underline} current,
largely zero--sum, comprehensive competition and
[**[confrontation]{.mark} with Beijing** [with]{.mark} a
stable]{.underline}, balanced, mutually beneficial [form of **[peaceful
coexistence]{.mark}** and bounded competition]{.underline} that can
sustain global peace and prosperity while effectively addressing the
primary threats facing both countries. [This will require]{.underline} a
policy toward China geared to effective deterrence regarding red lines,
alongside mutual, credible reassurance in key areas, and the
**[[channeling]{.underline}]{.mark}** of [Sino--U.S. [competition
into]{.mark}]{.underline} as many **[[constructive
realms]{.underline}]{.mark}** as possible, [most
importantly]{.underline} including the [effort to combat]{.underline}
the overriding threats posed by **[[climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[nuclear]{.mark} [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, WMD
**[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
global financial and [**[economic disorder]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [An
open--ended]{.underline}, winner--take--all [**[security
competition]{.mark}** can substantially [increase the chance of]{.mark}
**crises** and [**conflict** and **eliminate options for
coop**]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[in]{.underline} [dealing
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the truly **[[existential
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** all nations face. Ending hostile,
zero--sum political rhetoric, and replacing simplistic, confrontational
policies with prudent, balanced approaches to contentious issues holds
the possibility of creating the intellectual and political space for
compromise and the search for common ground.

**Alonso-Trabanco '25** \[Jose Miguel; January 14; international
relations professional who holds a Master's Degree in Strategic
Intelligence and National Security, currently pursuing a PhD at Massey

Perhaps the [**greatest change** of direction in the world]{.underline}
Zeitgeist derived [from the [**second coming** of
Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} ---and probably the most consequential legacy
of his administration--- [is]{.underline} a prospective
[[**reformulation** of US **fo**]{.mark}reign
**[po]{.mark}**licy]{.underline}. Together, the popular legitimacy of
Trump's second mandate, the [lack of]{.underline} circumstantial
[political **constraints**]{.underline} associated with the quest for
re-election, and intense geopolitical convulsion [open a window of
**opportunity**]{.underline} to make this happen. Such a course of
action would be a departure from the inertial bipartisan trajectory
followed by the US for decades after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Many mainstream media commentators disqualify this hypothetical
possibility, often with contradictory criticisms.
**[Trump]{.underline}** is [portrayed as a **trigger-happy** incendiary
cowboy]{.underline} as a result of his supposed megalomania but, [at the
same time]{.underline}, he is also depicted as [an **irresponsible** and
cowardly **isolationist**]{.underline} eager [to follow]{.underline} the
metaphorical '[**ostrich** policy]{.underline}' or as the reincarnation
of Chamberlain because of his alleged proclivity for appeasement. [These
**misrepresentations** respond to]{.underline} the [lack of]{.underline}
an [appropriate interpretative **referential logic**]{.underline}.
Therefore, it is pertinent ---for diagnostic, predictive and
prescriptive purposes--- to [[overcome]{.mark} the
narrow-minded]{.underline} and [**Manichean** vision of [liberal
**internationalism**]{.mark}]{.underline} with the explanatory
capabilities of theoretical models, such as political realism,
geoeconomics, and classical geopolitics. The purpose of this analysis is
to cover this gap in understanding by offering a higher degree of
clarity as an ingredient of a better judgment through a dispassionate
assessment. The [following contents]{.underline} intend to [dissect the
**cornerstones** of Trump foreign policy]{.underline}.

Illiberal Hegemony as Grand Strategy

As Kenneth [**Waltz** and]{.underline} John [**Mearsheimer**
forewarned]{.underline}, **[[unipolarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** has
[proved to be an **[unsustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
**self-defeating**]{.mark} model]{.underline} of world order. The
[foreign policy implemented]{.underline} and championed [by
the]{.underline} so-called '[Beltway Blob]{.underline}' has [[delivered
**disastrous outcomes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the most important of
which is the [configuration of]{.underline} a [strategic
environment]{.underline} that [[encouraged]{.mark} the **emergence** of
an **[axis of revisionist powers]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as
[Russia]{.underline}, [China]{.underline}, [Iran]{.underline}, and ---to
a lesser extent--- North Korea. In turn, [states]{.underline} like
Brazil, Turkey, and Japan are [assertively reactivating [**imperial**
traditions]{.mark}]{.underline} that had remained dormant for a long
time. Furthermore, the [rampant **proliferation** of
[anarchy]{.mark}]{.underline} has [buried the promise of a **rules-based
order**]{.underline} for all intents and purposes.

The [world is witnessing the [**return** of **great power
rivalries**]{.mark}]{.underline}; the [proliferation of **[interstate
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}; a [high-tech **[arms
race]{.mark}**]{.underline}; irregular [[**proxy**
confrontations]{.underline}]{.mark}; the [outright violation of
territorial **[borders]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the [intersection
between]{.underline} traditional and unconventional [**security**
threats]{.underline}; the operational [[irrelevance of]{.mark}
**international [institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the [implosion of
**[failed states]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the [normalization of
**military predation**]{.underline}; the [**weaponization**
of]{.underline} pretty much all vectors of [complex
interdependence]{.underline}; and the [resurrection of]{.underline}
militant **[[jihadism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, amongst other problematic
issues.

[Much of **Europe**]{.underline} ---whose security and defense has been
outsourced to the Americans through NATO's nuclear umbrella for
generations--- [is in [**disarray** due to]{.mark} internal [political
**upheaval**]{.mark}]{.underline}, strategic [atrophy]{.underline},
**[de-industrialization]{.underline}**, **[demographic]{.underline}**
trouble, [and]{.underline} a [loss of **economic
competitiveness**]{.underline}. Emerging states from the [[Global South
reclaim]{.underline}]{.mark} a [higher **hierarchical** [status]{.mark}
through **asymmetric** equalizers]{.underline}, force multipliers,
regional blocs, hedging strategies, and complex balanced alignments that
[increase]{.underline} their [influence as **independent participants**
in international politics]{.underline}. The [[new world
(dis)order]{.mark} resembles]{.underline} more a [[wild **Darwinian
jungle**]{.underline}]{.mark} than a peaceful Edenic garden.

As realists have long held, [**power** is the **only** valid currency
of]{.underline} the deadly arena of [international
politics]{.underline}. Despite the unwarranted illusions of the early
post-Cold War era, [today's **rude awakening**]{.underline} has
[demonstrated]{.underline} the [unsavory truth that [**political power**
grows]{.mark}]{.underline} ---above all else--- out of the barrel of a
gun, the rest is pretty much commentary. Moreover, [the US [national
interest]{.mark}]{.underline} has been [[harmed by]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [**quixotic crusade** to [export]{.mark} the]{.underline} '**[end of
history]{.underline}**' --- [liberal
**[democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [free market
**[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the American conception of
[**civil liberties** and post-modern [ideological
concoctions]{.mark}]{.underline} --- by force of arms. The [idea of
**[military interventions]{.mark}** to engage in]{.underline} 'nation
building' across the Greater [Middle East]{.underline} has
**[[backfired]{.underline}]{.mark}** by triggering chaos, sectarian
carnage and even 'imperial overstretch.' The proverbial road to hell has
been indeed [paved by **foolish policies** and **misguided
intentions**]{.underline}. Yet, [the twilight of]{.underline} '**[Pax
Americana]{.underline}**' [does not mean the demise of]{.underline} the
United States as a [great power]{.underline}.

Notwithstanding the objections of mainstream commentators, Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** ---judging in [accordance with the **tangible
results** of his first administration]{.underline}--- [is no
**warmonger**]{.underline}, dove, [or]{.underline}
**[isolationist]{.underline}**. To keep things in perspective, bear in
mind that [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} did [order the **targeted
assassination** of Iranian General]{.underline} Qassem Soleimani, though
he [did not engage]{.underline} Iran [in a **full-scale
war**]{.underline}, [despite]{.underline} his [**willingness** to
checkmate the Ayatollahs]{.underline}. Trump certainly [relies
on]{.underline} his trademark [**[strategic unpredictability]{.mark}**
as an asset **leveraged** to gain an upper hand]{.underline}. Yet the
facts on the ground -- his statements and the vision of key individuals
in his inner circle -- indicate that the second Trump administration
will [[follow]{.mark} of a [grand strategy of]{.mark}]{.underline}
'**[[illiberal hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}**'.

Such a behavioral approach [reflects]{.underline} a [[**commitment** to
preserve]{.mark} **US [primacy]{.mark}** in the concert of]{.underline}
nations through [military]{.underline}, [economic]{.underline}, [and
technological **superiority**]{.underline}. It also [champions a **sober
path** which]{.underline} [favors]{.underline} '[peace through
strength]{.underline}' when it comes to [[securing]{.underline}]{.mark}
US **[[national interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[rather
than]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[global **enforcement** of]{.mark}
collective **[rules]{.mark}** for]{.underline} the benefit of an
[illusory]{.underline} '**[[international
community]{.underline}]{.mark}**.' Tellingly, figures like J. D. Vance
and Tulsi Gabbard have been classified as opponents of neo-Wilsonian
hubris, who advocate a more realist Richelovian statecraft.

In a systemic strategic environment shaped by a polycentric balance of
power, '**[[America first]{.underline}]{.mark}**' means the United
States as the first amongst equals in the chessboard of high politics.
Apparently, it also [means the **dismissal** of perpetual **security**
guarantees for [states unwilling to invest]{.mark} in their [own
**defense**]{.mark} and]{.underline} the [burial of **permanent
entanglements** in]{.underline} contested [flashpoints]{.underline} half
the world away. Instead, [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} and fellow
travelers [favor [**compartmentalized partnerships** driven by
**self-interests**]{.mark}]{.underline} on a case-by-case basis, as well
as [selective and **limited interventions** focused on priorities
for]{.underline} the US [national interest.]{.underline} Trump, aware of
the need for restraint, [does not intend to remake the world in
America's **image** and **likeness**]{.underline}. In this view
---[deeply [**skeptical** of]{.mark} American
**[exceptionalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}--- the United States is no
different than any other great power in history.

A prescription derived from this way of thinking is the
[**[pursuit]{.mark}** of]{.underline} transactional [**Faustian deals**
with other great powers so that rivalries [can be
**managed**]{.mark}]{.underline} in a manner [that does [not
undermine]{.mark} systemic **[strategic
instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Clashing interests]{.underline} are
[a natural fact of political life]{.underline}, but there is no [need to
get [incinerated in]{.mark} a **[doomsday]{.mark}** scenario of
**[nuclear Armageddon]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A [potential
**arrangement**]{.underline} could probably [take place
through]{.underline} the [negotiated redistribution]{.underline} of
spheres of influence [or]{.underline} the [**diplomatic conformation**
of]{.underline} an entente cordiale based on the pragmatic necessities
of **[realpolitik]{.underline}**. For example, the [Trump team intends
to [refocus]{.mark} the bandwidth of US foreign policy
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[Indo-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
seen as the world's major epicenter of geopolitical and economic
gravity. In this theatre, [the priority seems to be a policy towards
China that [combines]{.mark} elements of both [**deterrence** and
**containment**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [[not]{.mark} a direct
**[kinetic confrontation]{.mark}** that]{.underline} may
[[unleash]{.mark} nasty]{.underline} military [fallout]{.underline},
[**counterproductive** political effects and]{.underline} **[financial
bankruptcy]{.underline}**. The [costs]{.underline} and risks [of a
**Peloponnesian**-like **[hegemonic war]{.mark}**]{.underline} between
the United States and China [**outweigh** any potential
gains]{.underline}.

#### Try or die for transition. Else, extinction.

**Xing '25** \[Dr. Li; January 21; Yunshan leading scholar and a
distinguished professor at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies;
South China Morning Post, \"As the rules-based order declines, hegemony
takes on a new form,\"
https://www.scmp.com/opinion/world-opinion/article/3295126/rules-based-order-declines-hegemony-takes-new-form\]

History shows that [world orders]{.underline}, [disorders or new
orders]{.underline} often [result from]{.underline} the **[[disturbing
dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[unleashed]{.mark} by crises [amid the
**rise** of new powers]{.mark}]{.underline} and the resistance of
existing powers. [Current dynamics]{.underline} can be understood by
analysing how the world order [is **[transitioning]{.mark}**
from]{.underline} a state of [**hegemony** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} one
of "[[**intertwined** hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}".

Hegemony is a concept that was employed by Italian Marxist theorist
Antonio Gramsci and is applied in international relations to describe
the enduring aspects of an existing order maintained by a leading actor
through a skilful combination of coercive and non-coercive power.

Hegemony is often associated with the [**U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}, which has [served as the **primary
hegemon**]{.underline} shaping the post-war order. US hegemony has been
[exerted through]{.underline} its [**economic** and **military
power**]{.underline}, as well as through [international]{.underline}
institutions used as tools to uphold global [norms]{.underline}, trade
and security structures.

However, [since **September 11** and]{.underline} 2008 [**g**lobal
**f**inancial **c**risis]{.underline}, the [[world
order]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[undergone]{.underline}]{.mark} multiple
crises and [[pivotal moments]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as [China's
rise]{.underline}, the US-China **[rivalry]{.underline}**, the [global
power **rebalance**]{.underline} caused [by
**[Covid]{.mark}**-19]{.underline}, the US [withdrawal from
**Afghanistan**]{.underline}, the
[Russia-**[Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline} war, China's increasing role
in the Middle East, Israel's latest assault in [**[Palestine]{.mark}**
and]{.underline} Donald [[**Trump's** second term]{.underline}]{.mark}.

These crises and [pivotal moments]{.underline} have [[exposed
**vulnerabilities**]{.mark} in]{.underline} the existing world order and
challenged the [hegemony]{.underline} of Western-led institutions and
norms.

The existing world order is [facing [crises across]{.mark} four
key]{.underline} domains. **[[Multilateral
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [increasingly elusive due
to]{.underline} great power [rivalries and [interstate
**conflicts**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [highlighting]{.underline} a [crisis
of functionality]{.underline} as global institutions struggle [to build
consensus on]{.underline} critical issues, such as
**[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}** change, [[**pandemics** and
**cybersecurity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The [US-led]{.underline} "rules-based" **[[global
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}** architecture has [[shown]{.mark} its
[**inability** to]{.mark} effectively [address]{.mark}]{.underline}
worldwide [[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}, reflecting a crisis of
scope. The [failure to deliver]{.underline} a secure and equitable
[global system underscores a [crisis of
**legitimacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Finally, [shifting **power
dynamics**]{.underline} between emerging and established powers
[signifies a crisis of **authority**]{.underline}.

In this context, [**intertwined** hegemony is a better way to
describe]{.underline} the **[[transition]{.underline}]{.mark}** from the
current world order to an emerging one. Intertwined hegemony [reflects a
process [defined by **mutual challenges**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[constraints]{.underline}, [dependencies and accommodation]{.underline}
between existing and emerging powers. Defenders and challengers of the
existing order are deeply intertwined, [engaging in a **continuous
process** of shaping and reshaping the global order]{.underline}.

Firstly, intertwined hegemony [indicates that **[globalisation]{.mark}**
is [steering the world]{.mark} economy [towards]{.mark}]{.underline} an
era of [multiple development models characterised by]{.underline} the
**[[coexistence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of multiple competing economic
systems and modes of governance. [Global economic players]{.underline}
now [include]{.underline} not only [private]{.underline} entities but
[also states]{.underline}, [exemplified by Chinese state-owned
enterprises]{.underline}.

The [Chinese **development model**]{.underline}, often referred to as
[the **[Beijing Consensus]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- understood as
[[regulated state-market-society]{.underline}]{.mark} relations --
[stands in contrast to the US-led **Washington Consensus**]{.underline}
defined by [liberal economic policies]{.underline}. [[**Non-state**
entities]{.underline}]{.mark} like transnational corporations, tech
giants and social movements [also play an **outsize role** in shaping
the world order]{.underline}.

Secondly, [intertwined hegemony [reflects]{.mark} a [shift
towards]{.mark}]{.underline} a [[**post-hegemonic**
world]{.underline}]{.mark}, where [[no single
power]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the US or the West more broadly,
[**unilaterally** [shapes global norms]{.mark}]{.underline} or
leadership. [[**Decentralised** platforms]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[internet]{.underline}]{.mark}** connections, the [**digital
economy** and [**tech** competition]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[[eroded]{.underline}]{.mark} [traditional
[monopolies]{.mark}]{.underline} on discourse, narratives and soft
power.

[[Global norms]{.underline}]{.mark} are [becoming more
**[flexible]{.mark}**]{.underline} and less universal, while
[**[alliances]{.mark}** increasingly]{.underline} form
[around]{.underline} [specific challenges]{.underline} and interests
rather than shared ideologies. In this post-hegemonic era, [no single
power can **enforce** global order]{.underline},
[[raising]{.underline}]{.mark} the risk of [regional [**conflicts**
and]{.mark} great power **[rivalries]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Thirdly, [[intertwined hegemony emphasises]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[diverse perspectives]{.mark}** on mechanisms]{.underline}, policies
and strategies that drive national development and growth. Today,
[[emerging powers]{.mark} have the **capacity** to [formulate]{.mark}
collective **positioning strategies** and **[balancing
tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the global arena.

For example, the [expansion of **[Brics]{.mark}** promotes]{.underline}
a [more inclusive model of global governance]{.underline} that values
cultural and civilisational diversity, [[providing an **alternative**
to]{.mark} the **[universalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} often espoused [by
the West]{.underline}.

The expansion of the [Brics grouping indicates]{.underline} that
[emerging powers are navigating]{.underline} the evolving world order
[[through]{.mark} a **[selective]{.mark} interplay** of
[strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}, including watching or observing
developments, [actively engaging in global affairs]{.underline},
[[bypassing **traditional** structures]{.underline}]{.mark} when
necessary and [influencing the **world system** to align with their
interests]{.underline}.

Last but not least, intertwined hegemony [marks a **[new era]{.mark}**
in which **stratification** between]{.underline} nations in the
traditional core, semi-periphery and periphery, [as well as the
**conventional** North-South axis]{.underline}, may [no longer fully
capture the [**complexities** of today's globalised]{.mark} and
interconnected [world]{.mark}]{.underline}. While they remain useful for
understanding global inequality and historical patterns of exploitation,
the [rise of]{.underline} emerging economies like [China]{.underline}
has [reshaped the established **structure** of global economic
**stratification**]{.underline}.

This is not the first time the [world order]{.underline} has
[encountered a **post-hegemonic** reality]{.underline}. Historical
transitions, such as the period following the fall of the Roman Empire
and the interwar years between the first and second world wars,
experienced similar phases of uncertainty and transformation.

The [[unprecedented pace of **technological**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[**economic** and **environmental** changes]{.underline}]{.mark} are
key distinctions in today's world. [[Whether]{.mark} these
transformations lead to a **new [equilibrium]{.mark}** [or]{.mark}
devolve into [**chaos** depends]{.mark} largely [on]{.mark} how global
actors **address** and **[navigate]{.mark}** these
challenges]{.underline}.

Therefore, [intertwined hegemony is]{.underline} perhaps [the **best
way** to describe evolving global dynamics]{.underline}, where power and
influence are increasingly shared, contested and co-produced across
different regions and actors.

The emerging world order characterised by intertwined hegemony [embodies
a **duality**]{.underline}. As existing powers gradually lose their
dominance, [emerging powers have [yet to establish]{.mark} an
**[alternative hegemony]{.mark}** grounded in universal **principles**
and **norms**]{.underline}.

The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which is causing COVID 19 disease, has
taught us unexpected lessons about the dangers of human extinction
through highly contagious and lethal diseases. As the COVID 19 pandemic
is now being controlled by various isolation measures, therapeutics and
vaccines, it became clear that our current lifestyle and societal
functions may not be sustainable in the long term. [We]{.underline} now
[have to start thinking and planning on how to face [the next]{.mark}
dangerous [pandemic]{.mark}, not just overcoming the one that is upon us
now.]{.underline} Is there any evidence that **[[even worse]{.mark}
pandemics could strike us]{.underline}** in the near future and
[threaten the existence of the human race]{.underline}? The answer is
unequivocally yes. It is not necessary to get infected by viruses of
bats, pangolins and other exotic animals that live in remote forests in
order to be in danger. [Creditable **scientific evidence**
indicates]{.underline} that the human [[gut]{.mark} microbiota **[harbor
billions of viruses]{.mark}**]{.underline} [which are capable of
affecting the function of **vital** human **organs** such as the immune
system, lung, brain, liver, kidney, heart etc.]{.underline} It is
possible that the development of [pathogenic variants]{.underline} in
the gut **[[can]{.mark} lead to contagious viruses]{.underline}** [which
can [cause **pandemics**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [leading to destruction
of vital organs]{.underline}, [causing death or various debilitating
diseases such as blindness, respiratory, liver, heart and
kidney]{.underline} failures. [These diseases could **[result in]{.mark}
the complete shutdown of**]{.underline} our
**[civilization]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} probably the
**[[extinction]{.mark} of human race]{.underline}**. In this essay, I
will first provide a few independent pieces of scientific facts and then
combine this information to come up with some (but certainly not all)
hypothetical scenarios that could cause human race misery, even
extinction. I hope that these scary scenarios will trigger preventative
measures that could reverse or delay the projected adverse outcomes. 1.
Introduction Le Chatelier's Principle: Named after the French chemist,
Le Chatelier's principle posits that "When an external stress (change in
pressure, temperature or concentration) is applied to a system in
chemical equilibrium, the equilibrium will change in such a way as to
reduce the effect of the stress." In other words, a change in a system
will evoke a counter-change, which will bring the equilibrium to a new
point. This principle operates with almost every human or other
activity. For example, it is known that when fruit production in the
Serengeti ecosystem is reduced, the number of elephants, which feed on
these fruits, is reduced proportionally. In the context of this essay, I
hypothesize that human-made changes in climate, the atmosphere, water,
soil, and all other planet-living organisms, will likely evoke
counter-changes that may be highly consequential to human life. Due to
the complexity of our ecosystem, humans do not know exactly how these
changes will affect them in the end. Consequently, they choose to
disregard them because lifestyle adjustments may cost money and
convenience or loss of well-established pleasures. 1.1. The earth is
changing rapidly What is changing on the earth that could induce a
potentially catastrophic counter-change? The answer is everything is
changing , from the living inhabitants (humans, other species, and
plants) to the atmosphere, water, soil, climate, among else. The changes
caused by human activity are sometimes dramatic. For example, it has
been estimated that about 1 million out of 8.5 million species of
plants, animals, and other organisms are in imminent danger of
extinction \[1\]. Other estimates show that 50% of the organisms that
existed 50 years ago have already gone extinct, not to consider
additional species that are gone before we even identify them. Soon, we
will likely be losing more than 80% of the world's species due to human
overdevelopment and its associated consequences. The major reasons for
species extinction are habitat destruction, pesticide poisoning, and
illegal hunting \[1\]. 2. Global warming Some may choose to believe what
the politicians are debating about: that climate change is a fact or
fiction, but the data say that the last 6 years were the warmest on
record \[2\]. Overall, the planet was 1.25°C warmer than in
preindustrial times (in the 1950s). Warmer oceans are melting ice sheets
and rising sea levels by almost 5 mm per year. In Australia,
record-setting heat and drought were responsible for the bushfires that
destroyed almost 25% of southeastern Australia's forests and their
living inhabitants, such as koalas. If we cannot slow down earth's
heating by reducing emissions, the current increase of about 0.2°C per
decade will likely be rapidly surpassed. How will the planet react?
Likely with more catastrophic fires, tsunamis, earthquakes, and floods.
The human homeostatic changes to increased temperatures are very complex
and include many vital organs \[3\]. Global warming may also cause
changes in the biology of our candidate foes, the viruses, bacteria, and
parasites that live in our gut and skin (see Section 2.2). 2.1. How much
human-made environmental damage has been done already? Humans are now
the undisputed masters of the planet and cannot be easily stopped from
actively destroying it, consciously or unconsciously. An interesting
question is how much damage has been claimed to be done already, and do
we have the data to support these claims? Elhacham et al. have recently
compared the natural biomass that exists on the earth with the
human-made (anthropogenic) mass \[4\]. They found that each person on
the globe produces a mass that is about equal to their body weight every
week! Is that too little or too much? Let us first define biomass and
anthropogenic mass. The majority of the earth's biomass is represented
by trees and bushes. The majority of the man-made mass is represented by
buildings and infrastructure such as roads and consists of concrete,
bricks, asphalt, metals, and plastic. Just consider that the total
global mass of produced plastic so far is greater than the overall mass
of all terrestrial and marine animals combined! So, how do we fare when
comparing biomass to anthropogenic mass production? In the 1900s, the
latter represented only 3% of global biomass; but now, in the 2020s, the
two masses are about equal. The projection is that if we go on with more
deforestation, buildings, streets, plastics, cars, and so on, by 2040,
it is likely that anthropogenic mass will almost triple the earth's
biomass. Will there be enough resources and clean air and water to
sustain the life of the projected 9 billion inhabitants? Anthropogenic
mass production is difficult to slow down since this activity is
considered part of our evolving civilization and way of living. 2.2.
Human microbiome The human body consists of approximately 30 trillion
cells, but the microbiota population in the human gut is estimated to be
300 trillion \[5\]! In addition, there is another microbiota in the skin
and other organs. It was initially thought that these microbiota act
locally (e.g., only in the gut or skin), but new evidence suggest that
the effects of microbiota may be global, reaching every cell in the
body. This can be achieved with various mechanisms, one being the
transmission of signals mediated by proteins that can travel through
anatomically distinct structures such as the vagus nerve. For example, a
protein called curli can travel through the vagus nerve and reach the
brain, where it can promote abnormal aggregation of proteins such as
a-synuclein, one major pathogenetic player in Parkinson's disease
\[5,6\]. Another and even more likely mechanism includes the diffusion
of bacterial or viral proteins (some could be toxins to various organs)
or pathogenic viruses into the bloodstream. From there, they can travel
around the body. This is reminiscent of cancer cell metastasis by the
hematogenous route. One piece of evidence for that happening is that
about half of the human metabolome (the collection of all metabolites in
the blood) is derived by host bacteria \[5\]. Bacteria or virus-derived
metabolites could also pass through the placenta and reach the fetus,
including the fetal brain, possibly causing diseases such as autism.
Despite skin not being as hospitable to microorganisms as the gut, a
typical person may have about 1,000 species of bacteria on their skin
\[7\]. These microbial communities continue to grow and diversify until
puberty when hormonal and developmental changes reach a plateau. The
balance between host and bacteria in the skin is determined by the
production of skin-derived microbial nutrients, microbiome-derived skin
nutrients, skin, and microbiome-derived antimicrobial peptides, and by
the interaction of the microbiome with the host's immune system. Similar
as in the gut, there is a delicate balance between beneficial and
potentially harmful bacteria and the host immune system. It is remotely
possible that our future enemies may derive from the gut, skin, or other
organs harboring microorganisms. In addition, the skin is more sensitive
to environmental changes such as climate change as it is directly
exposed to the environment. In conclusion, bacterial, viral, and
parasite-derived proteins or [pathogenic viruses]{.underline} thrive
locally (e.g., in the gut or skin) but [are [capable of]{.mark}
**[acting globally.]{.mark}**]{.underline} 2.3. Human viruses and how
they could cause disease [Many strains]{.underline} of gut bacteria are
harmless, but they [can become **dangerous pathogens**]{.underline}
[under certain conditions, such as **antibiotic use**]{.underline}
\[8\]. It is well known that gut bacteria can harbor many viruses
(bacterial phages) \[9\]. If they do not immediately kill the infected
bacteria, these viruses incorporate into the bacterial genome and stay
latent for extended periods (they are known "prophages"). These
prophages can be reactivated under certain environmental or other
factors and act like pathogenic viruses. It is rather surprising that,
in general, viruses are so many that they qualify as the most abundant
biological entities on the planet. Sometimes, gut bacteria use their
activated prophages as weapons to gain an advantage and kill other
competing bacteria. Phages could also assist in bacterial evolution as
the latter become more virulent \[10\]. The gut bacteria also seem to
interact with the host immune system and can influence the efficacy of
cancer immunotherapy \[11,12,13\]. The microbiome has been blamed for
playing direct or indirect roles in many human diseases, including
cancer, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, dementia, and others \[14\]. The
outcomes regarding health and disease depend on the balance of powers
among the gut/skin/other organ viruses, the gut/skin/other organ
microbiomes, and the host immune system. If this balance is disturbed, a
biological war between these players will be initiated, and the outcome
will be unpredictable. In conclusion, scientific evidence supports the
idea that phages in the mammalian intestine, skin, or elsewhere, not
only can be engulfed by certain eukaryotic cells but also might escape
from the gut or skin, enter the bloodstream, and make their way into
other parts of the body, with as yet undiscovered consequences. 2.4.
Viral variants [[Viruses evolve]{.mark} **continuously**]{.underline},
eventually [[leading to more **transmissible
variants**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which]{.underline} sometimes [can be
more **lethal**]{.underline} than the original strains. The SARS-CoV-2
is an excellent contemporary example. Multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2
are rapidly spreading and are becoming dominant in certain geographic
areas \[15,16\]. For example, the B.1.1.7 variant (United Kingdom) has
23 mutations and 17 amino acid changes; variant 501Y.V2 (South Africa)
has 23 mutations and 17 amino acid changes; and P.1 variant (Brazil) has
approximately 35 mutations with 17 amino acid changes. In April 2021,
when this document was first written, I speculated verbatim that "new
variants with additional mutations could become able to evade our
currently available vaccines by weakening the ability of vaccine-induced
antibodies to neutralize/block viral entry, and by strengthening the
ability of the virus to enter the cells via surface receptors." The
so-called "omicron variant," isolated in November 2021, already
fulfilled this prediction. 2.5. How COVID-19 and possibly other viruses
affect the brain In general, viral invasion of the central nervous
system may be achieved by several routes, including transsynaptic
transfer across infected neurons, entry via the olfactory nerve,
infection of vascular endothelium, or leukocyte migration across the
blood--brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 invades endothelial cells via
transmembrane angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding
and a subsequent proteolytic event, facilitated by transmembrane
protease serine 2 \[17\]. Is there evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can enter
the brain? The answer is yes \[18\]. As already mentioned, one route is
by migrating from the cribriform plate along the olfactory tract \[19\]
or through vagal pathways. Another route may include viral entry into
brain capillary endothelial cells via the ACE2 pathway. Viral RNA was
detected in the medulla and cerebellum by reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. However, viral proteins seem to
be absent from neurons and glial cells. Consequently, the adverse events
of the virus on the brain, including altered neurotransmission and
neuronal damage, are likely mediated by neuroinflammation and hypoxic
injury through cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators. 2.6.
SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other viruses can affect the senses Viruses can
affect our senses. For example, SARS-CoV-2 causes anosmia (loss of
smell) and ageusia (loss of taste) in 40--70% of COVID-19 patients
\[20\]. These effects persist, but it is unknown for how long. Other
neurological symptoms include headache, stroke, impairment of
consciousness, seizure, anxiety, and encephalopathy. Current evidence
suggests that SARS-CoV-2-related anosmia may be a new viral syndrome
specific to COVID-19. This syndrome is likely mediated by intranasal
inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into the olfactory neural circuitry. Since the
olfactory sensory neurons do not express ACE2 receptor, the likely
explanation for the loss of smell is the damage of accessory cells
supporting these neurons. Although anosmia is not a lethal or severe
disease, other neurological damage such as blindness could be
devastating \[21,22\]. 3 Adverse scenarios Fifty years ago, [one adverse
scenario regarding a pandemic was **presented**]{.underline} in the film
"The Andromeda strain," which describes a pandemic caused by a pathogen
of extraterrestrial origin \[23\]. Here, I present an alternative
hypothetical scenario that involves an endogenous virus. Obviously,
[there is a **myriad** of similar scenarios]{.underline}, and [the one
given]{.underline} below can be currently classified as fictional but
**[not impossible]{.underline}**. A prophage, which was residing dormant
for years in the genome of the commensal gut bacterium Bifidobacterium
infantis suddenly, and without an apparent reason, has undergone
induction and started to produce viral proteins, which were subsequently
assembled into whole phages. After cell lysis, these phages infected
other neighboring cells. This cycle was repeated many times, and
millions of free virions were released, some entering the systemic
circulation (viremia). Some virions reached the lung endothelium and
entered the endothelial cells through an, as yet, unknown receptor and
started replicating and lysing these cells. The resulting mucous caused
the host to cough, thus facilitating the transfer of the virus to other
humans through aerosol droplets. Soon, the virus was able to infect,
first a few hundred, then thousands, then millions of other unsuspected
people through coughing and sneezing. The virus was able to travel all
over the world as the pulmonary manifestations were mild, and most
infected individuals thought it was a common flu or a similar ailment.
[Scientists isolated the virus that caused this]{.underline} flu-like
[disease and determined]{.underline} from its genomic sequence that [it
was a novel member of influenza]{.underline} virus B, which usually
causes seasonal flu. [Despite the **pandemic**]{.underline} nature of
the infection, [nobody died]{.underline}, [and governmental bodies were
not]{.underline} highly [concerned]{.underline}. [Six months
later]{.underline}, [one]{.underline} individual [reported a weakening
of his vision]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, within 3 months,
[progressed to **total** blindness]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
unusual form of blindness [quickly spread to other people]{.underline}
until scientists performed epidemiological studies, which linked the
blindness to the previously mentioned mild flu. Soon afterward,
scientists isolated and identified the virus from the brains of blind
and subsequently succumbed individuals and confirmed that the sequence
matched the virus that caused the unusual flu. More elaborate studies
had shown that there was unusual and very severe neuroinflammation
around the occipital lobe of the brain (Brodmann area 17), an area
responsible for the interpretation of visual signals arriving from the
optic nerve. Several therapeutics were tried, but none was proven to be
effective. [Twelve months into the pandemic]{.underline}, **[10
million]{.underline}** people **[lost their vision]{.underline}**, [and
within 18 months]{.underline}, without any success in developing
therapies or a vaccine, [the blindness had spread to]{.underline}
**[whole nations]{.underline}**. 3.1 Blindness The selection of
blindness as a chronic consequence of an acute pandemic was deliberate.
In 1995, Portuguese author Jose Saramago published a fictional novel
entitled "Blindness" (ISBN: 9780151002511), which contributed to him
winning the Nobel Prize in literature in 1998. Blindness, as portrayed
in the book, is a highly detailed story of a mysterious mass
**[epidemic]{.underline}** [that [caused]{.mark}]{.underline} blindness
of a whole nation and the **[[social breakdown]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that followed. [The]{.underline} blindness [pandemic]{.underline}, in
many respects, [is reminiscent of]{.underline} the current
[COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic. Blindness [caused]{.underline}
widespread **[panic, anarchy, and government lockdowns]{.underline}**.
The life of the blind people was characterized by filthiness, aggressive
manners, disrespect of others, and a struggle to survive by any possible
means. The [breakdown]{.underline} of society [was]{.underline} near
**[total]{.underline}**. [Law and order, social services,
government]{.underline}, schools could **[no longer
function]{.underline}**. Families have been separated and could not find
one another. People squat in abandoned buildings and scrounge for food.
[Violence, disease, and despair]{.underline} **[threaten]{.underline}**
to overwhelm **[human coping]{.underline}**. One of Saramago's quotes,
describing life after blindness, is reproduced here "Perhaps humanity
will manage to live without eyes, but then it will cease to be humanity,
the result is obvious..." 3.2 Other ailments Acute
[pandemics]{.underline} could [cause]{.underline} many other **[chronic
diseases]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} can [threaten]{.underline}
the [sustainability]{.underline} of our present society. Although
COVID-19 causes loss of smell and taste, these are considered
nonlife-threatening ailments. However, in the long run, the permanent
absence of smell and taste will mean the loss of innumerable current
pleasures associated with the consumption of food and drinks. Clearly,
loss of hearing will not be compatible with current societal functions
or human achievements. [Acute viral diseases are]{.underline} also
[associated with innumerable]{.underline} **[[organ-specific
diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}** [such as heart, kidney, and reproductive
failures and disturbance of other vital functions that can]{.underline}
~~paralyze~~ \[[[hamstring]{.underline}]{.mark}\] [our current
[society,]{.mark} economy, and culture]{.underline}. Even a minor
weakening of our memory (mild cognitive impairment) could [result
in]{.underline} **[chaotic situations]{.underline}** that authors of
fiction, such as Saramago, attempt to describe in detail in future
books. 3.3 Epilog [Humans]{.underline} have learned to [take for granted
what they]{.underline} currently [have]{.underline} and enjoy. Perhaps,
we did not realize that [the human race's]{.underline} spectacular
[advances are dependent on several]{.underline} potentially volatile
[abilities]{.underline} (senses, brain function) [and that]{.underline}
even one loss, or diminution of such abilities, [could be]{.underline}
**[detrimental, [causing]{.mark} a [collapse of]{.mark} our
[civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The COVID-19 pandemic helped us
realize that [we may be sitting on a **time bomb**]{.underline}, [which
might]{.underline} **[explode]{.underline}** if we continue disturbing
the current equilibrium between humans and other planetary partners. In
addition to viruses of a rather exotic origin, such as SARS-CoV-2,
billions of other viruses and other infectious agents in our gut, skin,
and elsewhere are waiting for the right time to attack us. The lessons
learned from COVID-19 should be a wake-up call for humans to stop
disturbing the equilibrium with actions that favor the well-being of
humans but put in danger the existence of other inhabitants of planet
earth. Human [migration]{.underline}, also known as "travel," has
[facilitated the travel of our **foes**]{.underline}, along with us, [in
**every**]{.underline} conceivable [corner of the world]{.underline}.
Finally, yet, importantly, artists are always ahead of scientists in
seeing things coming. On this occasion, the rock band R.E.M. released a
song 30 years ago entitled "**[It's [the end of the world as we know
it]{.mark}]{.underline}** (and I feel fine)." They are likely not far
off their prediction!

1\. Introduction Despite recent social protests and climate emergency
declarations, [efforts to mitigate climate change to date are
**insufficient**]{.underline}.1 Greenhouse gas ([GHG]{.underline})
[emissions continue to rise and global [warming **above 3
°**]{.mark}**C** [is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[increasingly
[likely]{.mark} this century]{.underline}**.2 [There is emerging
evidence of]{.underline} amplifying [[feedbacks
**accelerating**]{.underline}]{.mark}3 and dampening feedbacks
decelerating.4 These [feedbacks [exacerbate]{.mark} the possibility of
**[runaway]{.mark}** global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline},5 [estimated
at **8 °C**]{.underline} [or greater]{.underline} by 2100.6 Such
temperature increases translate to a range of real dangers,7 shifting
the narrow climate niche within which humans have resided for
millennia.8 Looking beyond the framing of "global warming", there is
concern that the [effects of ﻿ [climate change]{.mark} may [pose an ﻿
**existential risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to humanity]{.underline}, one
[that threatens "**societal collapse**" or]{.underline} even
**[extinction]{.underline}**.9 Understanding these worst-case scenarios
is essential for good risk management.10 Improving awareness of
potential pathways through which ﻿ climate change poses such a risk can
help inform decision- making about interventions.11 Considering societal
impacts that are more tangible for individuals, businesses and
governments,12 and better ﻿ aligned with conventional risk priorities,13
may facilitate more effective action to mitigate ﻿ climate change.14 A
number of pathways through which ﻿ climate change could cause societal
collapse have been identified, one being via food insecurity.15 [Climate
change]{.underline} is predicted to [undermine **agricultural** systems
and [disrupt **food**]{.mark} **supply**]{.underline},16 [which may
[lead to **economic** shocks]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[socio-
political]{.underline}** [[instability]{.mark} as well as
**starvation**]{.underline}, **[migration]{.underline}** [[and
conflict]{.mark} at local through to **global scale**]{.underline}.17
[While]{.underline} the [climate **science**]{.underline} underpinning
global warming estimates [is well established]{.underline},18 albeit
subject to sensitivities, the [uncertainties increase
**significantly**]{.underline} [when we]{.underline} start to
[consider]{.underline} these [tangible societal impacts]{.underline}
given the complex relationships involved.19 [Our understanding of
worst-case scenarios]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} particularly of
empirical evidence addressing the [causal pathways]{.underline} through
which ﻿ climate change may cause societal collapse, [is]{.underline}
**[underdeveloped]{.underline}**.20 In this chapter we aim to identify
and structure an empirical evidence base of the relationships between ﻿
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse. We do this using
Causal Loop Diagrams (CLD), a system dynamics approach that is useful
for visualising the relationships between variables in a complex
system.21 This chapter is organised as follows. In Section 2, we review
the societal collapse and ﻿ existential risk literature to refine the aim
introduced above. In Section 3, we develop an original methodology to
establish a new empirical evidence base and create a novel-format CLD of
causal pathways between ﻿ climate change and societal collapse. In
Section 4, we present and discuss the results from the application of
this methodology to the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway of interest. We conclude, in Section 5, by
identifying avenues of future work that may build upon this chapter. 2.
Literature Review To refine the aim of this chapter, introduced in
Section 1, our review examines whether there is historical evidence of ﻿
climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse and to what extent
have causal pathways been documented to inform our understanding of ﻿
climate change as an existential threat to contemporary society. We
first define the terms "﻿ existential risk" and "societal collapse" as
used in this chapter. Adopting ﻿ Ord's definition, "an ﻿ existential risk
is a risk that threatens the destruction of humanity's long-term
potential" be it incomplete destruction, such as societal collapse, or
complete destruction, such as extinction.22 Adopting Kemp's definition,
[societal collapse]{.underline} is an "enduring loss of ﻿ population,
identity \[and/or institutional\] complexity";23 it [may be **abrupt**
or gradual]{.underline}, [but is typically **rapid**]{.underline}
because it is notably transformative, [and may be experienced
by]{.underline} a local, national or [the **global community** of
people]{.underline}. Fig. 1 presents a conceptual model of societal
collapse, synthesised from the broader literature, to provide further
contextual definition. [\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]]{.underline} The rise and
fall of civilisations has been documented since the earliest recordings
of history and is increasingly studied to inform our understanding of
societal collapse.24 We consider two types of historical studies that
provide insight into ﻿ climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse
in the past. We note that other mechanisms are also discussed in the
literature, and there is debate about the role of different mechanisms
in particular societal collapse events. The first type of historical
study empirically investigates an individual societal collapse event
using primary sources, including anthropological, archaeological and
paleontological data. Based on such data analysis, natural ﻿ [climate
change has been]{.underline} asserted as [a mechanism of societal
collapse in]{.underline} **[many]{.underline}** of these [case
studies]{.underline}, as established by de Menocal25 and Weiss and
Bradley.26 For example, Hodell et al.,27 Haug et al.,28 and
Medina-Elizalde and Rohling29 analyse paleoclimate data alongside the
[archaeological record]{.underline} to [show]{.underline} that
[drought]{.underline} conditions, [driven by ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} likely due to solar forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the **[collapse]{.underline}** [of the]{.underline}
Classic **[Maya]{.underline}** [civilisation]{.underline} of Mesoamerica
in \~8--10th century CE. Weiss et al.,30 Cullen et al.,31 and Cookson et
al.32 show that [regional aridity]{.underline}, [driven by ﻿ climate
change]{.underline} likely due to ﻿ volcanic forcing, [contributed
to]{.underline} the [collapse of]{.underline} multiple [societies
**across Mesopotamia**]{.underline}, including the Akkadian Empire in
\~22nd century BCE. Similarly, natural ﻿ [climate change has been
implicated in]{.underline} the [collapse of multiple Late Bronze Age
societies]{.underline} around the Mediterranean,33 [including
**Mycenaean** Kingdoms]{.underline} in \~12th century BCE,34 the
Harappan Civilization of South Asia in \~19th century BCE,35 the Angkor
Empire of Southeast Asia in \~15th century CE,36 **[multiple Chinese
Dynasties]{.underline}**37 [and civilisations along the Silk
Road]{.underline}38 during the previous millennium, [the Norse
Vikings]{.underline} of Greenland in \~16th century AD,39 and the
Tiwanaku Empire of Pre- Columbian South America in \~10th century CE40
amongst others. This first type of studies establishes precedence of
natural ﻿ climate change as a mechanism of societal collapse throughout
history, demonstrating the risk that anthropogenic ﻿ climate change
similarly poses to contemporary society. However, the events examined
occurred more than 100 years ago, with most dating back to ancient
history, when societies were relatively isolated. Because these case
studies pre- date contemporary society, they do not provide empirical
evidence of anthropogenic ﻿ climate change in context of today's highly
interconnected society.41 Statistical evaluation of the frequency and
significance of natural ﻿ climate change relative to other mechanisms of
societal collapse identified across these case studies has not yet been
established within the literature. However, the second type of
historical study does qualitatively examine collections of these case
studies to develop theories of predominant modes of societal collapse.
Three major modes are observed, as follows. Fagan42 and McMichael43
focus on natural impact on the human system across multiple
civilisations, concluding that natural ﻿ climate change is predominant
having significantly influenced human existence throughout history.
[Over]{.underline} the past [12,000 years]{.underline}, the [natural and
human systems developed within the **stable climate niche**]{.underline}
[of the Holocene]{.underline} Epoch.44 The associated geographic
endowments governed human transition from band societies based on
foraging to complex societies based on agriculture. Unfavourable subtle
(e.g. weather variations) and drastic (e.g. natural disasters) shifts in
climate influenced the collapse of complex societies either by direct
loss of life or indirectly via resource insecurity. In particular, in
this mode, typically, the loss of agriculture led to de-﻿ population via
famine, migration or conflict due to food insecurity. Ponting,45
Wright,46 and Diamond47 focus on human impact on the natural system
across multiple civilisations, concluding that human overpopulation and
overexploitation relative to the carrying capacity of the environment is
predominant. [Societal collapse via environmental
degradation]{.underline} often [involved **unsustainable**]{.underline}
[agriculture]{.underline}, [exacerbated by]{.underline} natural ﻿
[climate change]{.underline}, [leading to de-﻿ population as well as
**institutional breakdown**]{.underline} [via loss of **economic
stability**]{.underline} [and socio-political
**dysfunction**]{.underline} due to magnified inequality.
[This]{.underline} mode [aligns with]{.underline} early "Malthusian ﻿
catastrophe",48 "tragedy of the commons",49 and "**[overshoot-and-
collapse]{.underline}**"50 theories. In their 12-volume magnum opus
exploring the rise and fall of 28 civilizations, Toynbee concludes that
"[great civilizations are not murdered]{.underline} \[[but]{.underline}
rather\] they [take their **own lives**]{.underline}."51 Building on
this, Tainter,52 Acemoglu and Robinson,53 and Johnson54 focus on human
impact on the human system across multiple civilisations, concluding
that societal complexity in relation to problem-solving inability (e.g.
environmental degradation) and institutional dysfunction (e.g.
inequality and oligarchy internally, trade ally and hostile neighbour
relations externally) is predominant. As a society becomes more complex,
it reaches a point beyond which "continued investment in complexity as a
problem-solving strategy yields a declining marginal return" and it will
be at risk of collapsing under its own weight via institutional
breakdown and de-﻿ population.55 This mode aligns with "energy returned
on energy invested" theory,56 applied to explore societal collapse by
Homer-Dixon.57 Diamond,58 Turchin,59 and Schwartz and Nichols60 examine
why some civilisations have been able to thrive or recover, rather than
collapse. They similarly conclude that societies have flourished due to
combinations of favourable geographic endowment, managing their
existence within the carrying capacity of the natural system, and
co-operative action in problem-solving. This second type of studies
highlights that societal collapse involves a complex nexus of factors
and dynamically interlinked events. For instance, Gibbon details how all
three of the modes, described in the preceding five paragraphs,
contributed to the collapse of the ﻿ Roman Empire.61 These modes of
societal collapse, although based on empirical evidence pre-dating
contemporary society, describe key aspects of the anthropogenic ﻿ climate
change problem faced today. While these studies describe causal pathways
of relevance, to the best of our knowledge, no study has used CLDs to
untangle the complexity and give structure to the dense information in
this evidence base. Across these historical studies, we observe no
apparent temporal or spatial influence on the occurrence of societal
collapse. Rather, societal collapse has been described as occurring in
various forms, whether it be by known "white-swan" or surprise "black
swan" events,62 in different geographic locations and times throughout
history. Additionally, a quantitative statistical analysis by Arbesman
shows that societal collapse has occurred randomly and independent of
civilisation life- spans.63 These qualitative and quantitative
observations highlight that any society may be susceptible to collapse,
much in-line with the Red Queen Hypothesis of the Law of Extinction.
From these historical studies, we observe sets of secondary determinants
for each of the primary determinants introduced in Fig. 1, which are
defined in Fig. 2. Considering a geographically bounded society,
emigration refers to any permanent departure of ﻿ population including
both voluntary or forced migration, conflict mortality accounts for
deaths directly arising from any form of domestic or international
conflict (e.g. due to ﻿ war), and natural mortality accounts for deaths
related to domestic environmental conditions (e.g. due to famine). The
loss of socio-cultural norms, political structures or economic value
accounts for that which notably transforms the identity and institutions
of the society. [\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]]{.underline} In addition to these
historical studies, we consider the relatively nascent studies of
existential risks (X-risks) that provide insight into how ﻿ climate
change may trigger societal collapse in the future. Comprehensive
surveys of X-risks reveal mechanisms that could cause the collapse of
contemporary society. Bostrom and Ćirković,65 ﻿ Rees,66 and Ord67 provide
eminent scholarly treatment of the field, drawing from the academic
literature. The World Economic Forum68 and Global Challenges
Foundation69 produce global risk reports drawing from decision-makers
and experts across intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations.
These surveys establish that [many **historically**]{.underline}
[observed mechanisms of societal collapse]{.underline},
**[including]{.underline}** natural [﻿]{.underline} [climate
change]{.underline}, [remain applicable as X-risks today]{.underline}.
However, the ﻿ state of existence of contemporary society has led to a
different landscape in which these mechanisms apply, and to a number of
unprecedented mechanisms, including anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. ﻿
Ehrlich and ﻿ Ehrlich70 and Häggström71 note that [although [increased

**resilience** and **adaptability**]{.underline}, [it can also [increase
﻿**vulnerability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, globalisation
increases resilience to local agricultural production shocks through
access to global markets; however, it also increases ﻿ vulnerability
through ﻿ exposure to sudden reversal in connectivity, such as trade
restrictions.72 Some **[geoengineering technologies]{.underline}**, for

Wallace-Wells77 and Gowdy78 draw on the scientific ﻿ climate change
literature to explore hypothetical futures under best- to worst-case
scenarios. The scenarios consider the feedbacks within the natural
system that could worsen, as well as the potential for humans to
mitigate, anthropogenic ﻿ climate change. [Shifts in]{.underline} average

[This insecurity could impact **institutional stability**]{.underline},
[resulting in economic loss]{.underline}, [political dysfunction and

**conflict**]{.underline}. The hypothetical outcomes for contemporary
society against the threat of anthropogenic ﻿ climate change range from
dystopian (collapse) to utopian (recovery). These futures studies
identify endpoints of different causal pathways between anthropogenic ﻿
climate change effects and potential impacts on the human world system,
with the latter reflecting key determinants of societal collapse
observed in the historical studies. Scholars have made limited in-roads
to empirically investigating the top-level relationships between some of
these endpoints using recent datasets. The direct links between ﻿ climate
change and the endpoint impacts of mortality, conflict and migration
are, respectively, examined by Mora et al.,79 Hsiang et al.80 and Hauer
et al.81 The feedback between migration and conflict driven by climate
change is examined by Abel et al.82 The direct links between ﻿ climate
change and the endpoint impacts of economic loss, political instability
and shifts in cultural norms are examined by Burke et al.,83 Sofuoğlu
and Ay,84 and Adger et al.85 respectively. However, the complex
bottom-level links between and surrounding these endpoints are generally
ill understood,86 and the strength of empirical evidence is poorly
documented from a systems science perspective.87 To the best of our
knowledge, **[no study]{.underline}** has [empirically examined how the
impacts of ﻿ climate change could explicitly translate into societal
collapse for **contemporary** society]{.underline}. [We **do not have a
clear picture**]{.underline} [of ﻿ climate change as a ﻿ **systemic risk**
to our globalised society]{.underline}, particularly at spatial scales
accounting for the heterogeneity of individual identity, business
governance and policymaking across nations, and international exchanges.
This limits our ability to understand feedbacks, identify intervention
points, develop quantitative models and inform strategies to minimise
the risk of societal collapse occurring in the future.88 Given the
insights from this review, we refine the aim of this chapter as follows.
Firstly, the empirical evidence base should specifically address
contemporary society. Secondly, the CLD should be constructed at a scale
and granularity that addresses the heterogenous characteristics of
nations and international interactions. The refined aim of this chapter
is thus to identify an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society and structure
the evidence base with a CLD defined at global scale and national
granularity. 3. Methodology A two-stage framework, consisting of five
steps, was developed to achieve the aim of this chapter. For each step,
below, we first introduce it generically and then describe its
application to our specific analysis of the ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse causal pathway. 3.1. Stage 1:
Establishing an empirical evidence base of societal collapse in
contemporary society Step I deploys societal collapse proxies via a key
word search to identify "evidence points", which in this instance may be
considered data points, in the form of publications that empirically
examine the causal pathway of interest in contemporary society. The
determinants defined in Fig. 2 provide these societal collapse proxies
to establish the new empirical evidence base in lieu of historical
societal collapse events pre-dating contemporary society. The ﻿
population loss set are straightforward to isolate, consistent to
measure across nations and describe tangible consequences. The
institutional breakdown set are relatively less so. Thus, the societal
collapse proxies adopted in this study were natural mortality (i.e.
starvation, with respect to food insecurity), conflict mortality and
emigration; subsequent studies could use the institutional breakdown
set. Key words were selected based on terminology of ﻿ climate change,
food insecurity and the societal collapse proxies. Peer-reviewed journal
articles were chosen as the form of evidence point in this study;
subsequent studies could use other publications, such as books and
reports. The keyword search was performed in Scopus. A record of the
search is contained in the Supplementary Information (A.). Approximately
3,000 publications were reviewed by reading the title, abstract and main
body as needed. Evidence points were selected based on satisfaction of
the following criteria: the publication (a) is a peer-reviewed, English-
language, journal article; (b) uses empirical, data driven methods; (c)
examines the period from 1990 to present (2019), representative of
contemporary society; and (d) primarily examines the causal pathway of
interest. We made an exception to (a) to include the most recent Limits
to Growth book,89 which was not itself a search result but documents the
World3 model that was identified in the search results. We note that (b)
precluded selection of review or essay-style publications; however, we
found that these were often discussed in the literature review of
selected evidence points, so were, nonetheless, accounted for
indirectly. This step resulted in a new empirical evidence base
consisting of 41 evidence points, which are summarised in Fig. 4. Step
II defines a custom colour-coded typology for the new empirical evidence
base. This typology is used in Stage 2, to construct a final CLD (f-CLD)
in a novel format showing the spread of the evidence base across the
system. In this study, we were interested in the methodological spread
as this provides information on data that may be useful for future
studies. Four methodological categories were identified in the new
empirical evidence base. Each evidence point was classified into one of
these categories and assigned a colour coding, namely: quantitative ﻿
complex systems model --- red; statistical analysis of quantitative
dataset --- blue; collection / analysis of qualitative interview /
survey data --- green; quantitative data-led case study / scenario ---
yellow. The resulting typology of the new empirical evidence base is
shown in Fig. 4. 3.2. Stage 2: Constructing a novel-format causal loop
diagram from the empirical evidence base Step III involves creating an
individual CLD (i-CLD) for each evidence point to clearly structure the
complex causal relationships examined. These i-CLDs provide the building
blocks from which to construct the f-CLD in Step IV. [\[FIGURE 3
REMOVED\]]{.underline} The process to create an i-CLD is as follows. The
corresponding evidence point was examined in its entirety to identify
and record key information in the form of variables (nodes), links
(arrowed lines) and relationship notation (positive or negative). Key
information derived from the original data-driven content, i.e. the main
analysis, of the evidence point was colour coded in the i-CLD according
to the typology classification established in Step II. Any relationships
hypothesised but not supported by the main analysis were coloured grey.
Key information derived from other content, i.e. the literature review,
of the evidence point was coloured black. The scale and granularity of
the i-CLD was recorded as detailed in the evidence point. This process
was repeated for each evidence point in isolation until a complete set
of i-CLDs was produced for the new empirical evidence base. All 41
i-CLDs created in this study are contained in the Supplementary
Information (B.). One of the i-CLDs is shown in Fig. 3 as an example.
Step IV reconciles the set of i-CLDs into a standardised format in order
to construct the f-CLD of the system of interest at the desired scale
and granularity. The standardisation process has two aspects. One aspect
is related to component (variables and links) definition, necessary to
maximise clarity of the f-CLD while covering all information contained
in the evidence base. This addresses the typical challenge of CLDs
becoming dense and overcomplicated, which decreases their ﻿ utility. The
other aspect is related to level of aggregation, necessary to ensure the
f-CLD conveys information at the intended scale and granularity. The
standardisation is an iterative process, as follows. The \~950 variables
from the set of 41 i-CLDs were recorded on a blank worksheet for the
f-CLD, without links between them. A clustering approach was used to
reconcile these variables into like groups. For each group, an
overarching major node was isolated and the i-CLD variables in the group
were virtually deposited into a matrix for that major node. For example,
drought, sea level rise and crop disease were some of the i-CLD
variables clustered into an environmental risk factors f-CLD major node
matrix. The f-CLD major nodes were defined at a level of aggregation
representative of a nation. Doing so effectively scaled down any global
or regional aggregation, and scaled up any sub-national or local
aggregation, in the i-CLD variables. For example, household food imports
was an i-CLD variable of local aggregation that was scaled up to
national food imports (trade) in the f-CLD. The \~1150 links from the
set of 41 i-CLDs were reconciled into arrowed lines between the major
nodes in the f-CLD. This sometimes- required interpretation of implied
causality in the i-CLD relationships in order to route them across the
major nodes in the f-CLD. For example, where an i-CLD showed a direct
link from international food price to conflict variables, this was
routed using arrowed lines from international food price to national
food price to food ﻿ accessibility to food insecurity and finally to
conflict major nodes defined in the f-CLD. Where there was a discrepancy
between relationship descriptions, the relationship with the most
supporting i-CLDs was adopted. The interim f-CLD produced at the end of
each standardisation iteration was examined to determine whether the
major node definition could be refined to maximise clarity. For example,
in one iteration water and land were defined as separate major nodes,
but examination determined that each had the same arrowed lines to other
major nodes; therefore, another iteration was undertaken with water and
land now clustered under a single natural resources major node in order
to minimise redundant arrowed lines. This process was iterated several
times until an f-CLD had been constructed at an appropriate level of
detail for this study. Additionally, relevant literature reviewed in
Section 290 was cross- referenced, but not included as evidence points,
to ensure comprehensive coverage of key relationships in the f-CLD. The
standard-format f-CLD, consisting of uncoloured and unweighted
components, resulting at the end of this step is contained in the
Supplementary Information (C.). Step V maps each i-CLD to the f-CLD
using a weighted (line thickness) typology (colour-coded) approach. This
visually documents the spread of the evidence base across the system
described by the f-CLD. The process to map an i-CLD to the f-CLD is as
follows. Each variable (node) of the i-CLD was assigned to its
corresponding major node(s) in the f-CLD. Each link (arrowed line) of
the i-CLD was assigned to a corresponding route along the arrowed lines
in the f-CLD. Each time an arrowed line in the f-CLD had an i-CLD link
assigned to it, an incremental weighting of one-unit line thickness in
the corresponding typology colour-coding of the i-CLD link was added to
the f-CLD arrowed line. This process was repeated for each of the 41
i-CLDs until all had been mapped to the f-CLD. A record of this process
for each of the 41 i-CLDs is contained in the Supplementary Information
(D.). The novel-format f-CLD, consisting of colour-coded and weighted
components, resulting at the end of this final step is presented in Fig.
5. 4. Results and Discussion The new empirical evidence base and
novel-format CLD of ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society resulting from the application of our
original methodology (Section 3) are discussed in turn below. 4.1.
Empirical evidence base of climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse in contemporary society The new empirical evidence base
(Section 3, Step I), along with its colour-coded typology (Section 3,
Step II), is presented in Fig. 4. It consists of 41 evidence points, of
which 9 examine the natural mortality (i.e. starvation, with respect to
food insecurity), 20 the conflict mortality and 12 the emigration
societal collapse proxy, alongside other human and natural world system
factors. We discuss three key aspects of the evidence base, namely
temporal and spatial distribution, data-driven method distribution, and
advantages of each data-driven methods, below. The temporal scale and
granularity of study varies across the evidence base; however, our
methodology limited the possible scale of study to the period from 1990
to present, representative of contemporary society. Within this period,
approximately half of the evidence points cover a scale of less than one
decade and the other half a scale of greater than one decade.
Approximately half of the evidence points conduct analyses at yearly
granularity and the other half conduct analyses at granularity greater
than one year, with only a few studies conducting analyses at monthly
granularity. The spatial scale and granularity of study varies across
the evidence base. Approximately one third of the evidence points
investigate the system at a global scale, with the remaining two thirds
focusing on regional or national scales, primarily in Africa as well as
the Middle East and Asia. Approximately half of the evidence points
analyse the causal pathway at sub-national granularity, with the other
half primarily focusing on national-level granularity. This variation
provided different coverage of the complex relationships within the
system, which was informative for constructing our CLD. The distribution
of data-driven methods used across the evidence base is notably
different for each societal collapse proxy. Evidence points for natural
mortality mostly use collection/analysis of interview/ survey data. This
is likely because the minimum daily food intake for human survival is
well established;91 as such, statistical analysis of food and mortality
data sets would not yield significantly new insights into thresholds
whereas interviews/surveys can provide insight into an individual's
circumstances influencing this relationship. Evidence points for
conflict mortality mostly use statistical analysis of existing datasets.
This likely reflects the interest in rigorously curated conflict
datasets, such as UCDP/PRIO,92 across the conflict and peace fields.
Evidence points for emigration mostly use collection/analysis of
interview/survey data, likely because this provides nuanced insight into
an individual's decision to migrate. It may also be due to data
availability and quality challenges that limit quantitative statistical
analyses, which are being addressed by groups such as the International
Organization for Migration's Global Migration Data Analysis Centre.93
Amongst these data challenges, it is important to recognise the issue of
reconciling different types of voluntary and forced migration with
causal drivers, given the complex social, economic and political factors
at play; this challenge similarly applies to the other societal collapse
proxies but is particularly noted in the migration studies. We observe
from these studies that a food insecurity threshold for natural
mortality is well established but thresholds for conflict mortality and
emigration are not. Indeed, distinguishing causal drivers within
datasets and defining quantitative thresholds for these determinants
remains a "grand challenge".94 [\[FIGURE 4 REMOVED\]]{.underline} Each
data-driven method offers different advantages. The ﻿ complex ﻿ systems
models each describe "chunks" of the system at different scale and
granularity. The models provide mathematical definition, are ﻿ calibrated
to real-world data and enable quantitative simulation of key
relationships in the system. The statistical analyses quantitatively
examine relationships between a dependent variable and one or more
independent variables within the system, which can be used as a
mathematical basis for extending ﻿ modelling capabilities. The
collection/ analysis of interview/survey data provides insight into
qualitative aspects of human perspective and decision-making that
quantitative data sets cannot provide directly. The data-led case
study/scenarios combine quantitative data with qualitative expert
interpretation to better understand global trends and ﻿ forecasts. These
latter two methods can also be used to inform the development of ﻿
modelling capabilities, the scenarios analysed by such models and their
application in decision- making processes. Collectively, these different
data-driven methods can yield useful insights into the nuances of
relationships in the system of interest. 4.2. Causal loop diagram of the
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary
society at global scale and national granularity The main result of this
chapter is the CLD (the f-CLD from Section 3, Step V), presented in Fig.
5. It structures the relationships between ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse as described in our new empirical
evidence base (presented in Fig. 4 and discussed in Section 4.1). We
discuss three key aspects of the CLD, namely insights related to the
spread of empirical evidence, the qualitative ﻿ complex system depicted,
and quantitative ﻿ complex system ﻿ modelling, below, alongside
consideration of well-established benefits and limitations of CLDs. Our
CLD is presented in a novel format that documents the spread of our
empirical evidence base. We use line thickness and colour, respectively,
to depict the density and type of the data-driven methods used by the
empirical evidence points to analyse a given link between two variables.
Doing this aids comprehension of where existing work has been focused
with respect to the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and societal
collapse causal pathway. It may also help with the identification of
gaps in existing analyses. For example, we can see that the link between
food insecurity and conflict has been investigated mostly by evidence
points using statistical analyses (blue), whereas the links between food
insecurity and migration, and food insecurity and natural mortality,
have been investigated mostly by evidence points using
interviews/surveys (green). This hints that it may be useful to
investigate the former using quantitative statistics, and the latter
using qualitative interviews/surveys, to gain further insights offered
by the different data-driven methods as described in Section 4.1. It is
important to recognise that our CLD may show negligible density for
important links or even be missing important variables and/or links,
either because they have not yet been studied or because our key word
search failed to identify evidence points that have studied them. For
example, our study focused on the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse causal pathway, so the density of our empirical
evidence is concentrated along links central to this pathway, whereas
the links between peripheral variables in the system, such as between
fertility and births, show a lower density of empirical evidence.
Similarly, our use of the ﻿ population loss set of societal collapse
proxies means that the evidence base details natural mortality, conflict
mortality and emigration, whereas the institutional breakdown set are
not detailed. In considering this issue, our methodology attempted to
maximise the ﻿ rigour and transparency of our study by documenting the
spread of our empirical evidence base to help make the reader aware of
exactly how much and what type of evidence was supporting the CLD
presented here. Further, we can see that while empirical studies have
linked ﻿ climate change via food insecurity to our societal collapse
proxies of natural mortality, conflict mortality and emigration, we
found no empirical studies linking these proxies to the explicit term of
societal collapse. This was expected given the motivation of this study
(Section 1) and is due to the fact that there are no contemporary events
of societal collapse, under the same definition as those in the
historical studies pre-dating contemporary society, that enable these
links to be empirically studied.95 Having considered the spread of
empirical evidence, we now consider the ﻿ complex system documented. A
key benefit of CLDs is that they simply present a myriad of information
in a single diagram; in doing so, CLDs enable comprehension of the
structure and behaviour of ﻿ complex systems, including feedbacks,
intervention points and far- reaching interdependencies.96 Our CLD
visually depicts a system of 39 variables, 105 links and 32,000 feedback
loops,97 integrating information from different fields including climate
science, ﻿ food security, conflict, migration and health research.
Walking through the CLD at a high-level, we can see how ﻿ population
growth and lifestyle emissions, influenced by institutional/demographic
factors (e.g. emission reduction incentives), combine to directly drive ﻿
climate change. Similarly, they indirectly drive ﻿ climate change via
consumer demand on food production, which produces emissions directly
(e.g. ruminant livestock) and indirectly via industrial capital/ output
(e.g. processing factories). The environmental risk factors (e.g.
extreme weather events) of ﻿ climate change may cause losses of food
production either directly (e.g. plant disease) or indirectly via
agricultural input availability (e.g. loss of water source for
irrigation). A country's food availability is influenced by domestic
food production and international food trade. Food ﻿ accessibility is
influenced by its food price, which responds to domestic (e.g. cost of
food production and distribution) and international (e.g. international
food price) markets, and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. food
subsidies). Food utilisation is influenced by ﻿ infrastructure/services
(e.g. ﻿ education) and institutional/demographic factors (e.g. cultural
traditions). Food insecurity is underpinned by these three pillars of
food availability, food ﻿ accessibility and food utilisation. For a given
country, food insecurity can drive natural mortality (i.e. starvation),
conflict and migration, contributing to ﻿ population loss, as well as
economic shocks and socio- political instability, contributing to
institutional breakdown, which exacerbates the risk of societal
collapse. [Beyond]{.underline} a given country suffering [increased
natural mortality]{.underline}, [famines]{.underline} (i.e. [food
insecurity]{.underline}) [can place pressure on international
humanitarian efforts]{.underline} ([i.e. **institutional** risk
factors]{.underline}). [Conflict may occur domestically or
**internationally**]{.underline} [and can **feedback**]{.underline} [to
**exacerbate**]{.underline} [food insecurity and institutional
fragility]{.underline} (i.e. institutional risk factors). Potential
[mass emigration can increase **pressure** on food
availability]{.underline}, [natural resources and ﻿
infrastructure/services in the destination nation]{.underline}, which
can lead to socio- cultural tensions (i.e. institutional risk factors)
that fuel conflict. [[Food insecurity]{.mark} can]{.underline} also
**[directly]{.underline}** [[contribute to]{.underline}]{.mark}
institutional risk factors such as [social unrest, political instability
and economic inequality]{.underline}, [which increase the risk of
[societal collapse due to **institutional
breakdown**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [that may also ﻿ **cascade
internationally**]{.underline}. [While already fragile ﻿ states are
**expected**]{.underline} [to be hit the worst
**directly**]{.underline}, these [insights reveal the **indirect**
ramifications of ﻿ climate change on our **globalised
society**]{.underline},98 [with **serious consequences**]{.underline}
[for **humanity's "existential security".**]{.underline}99 [While some
of these relationships may appear **obvious**]{.underline}, it is the
act of [**bringing** this information]{.underline}, [which may otherwise
be **siloed**]{.underline} and thus preventing consideration of the full
story, **[together]{.underline}** [in one place]{.underline} that [is of
value]{.underline}.100 In doing so, our CLD attempts to provide readers
with the opportunity to explore the ﻿ climate change, food insecurity and
societal collapse causal pathway, consider worst-case scenarios that we
want to avoid, develop transformative narratives of "where we want to
go" and think about interventions that may help us attain this desired
future.101 It is important to appreciate that CLDs are only as good as
their information inputs; our CLD documents relationships based on
information portrayed in our empirical evidence base as well as our
interpretation of that information. As such, there exist challenges and
limitations.102 For instance, CLDs may mask variability of relationships
in different contexts and locations, because they can only depict a
single scale and granularity. The portrayal of explicit causality
between variables in a CLD is a challenge as this can often work in both
directions rather than one. CLDs can often become either too complicated
or too simplified, which undermines their usefulness. In considering
each of these issues, our original methodology attempted to maximise the
﻿rigour and transparency of our study by first documenting the
information in each evidence point with an i-CLD and then consistently
applying, and recording, the iterative process of reconciling the
variables and links from each i-CLD to construct the f-CLD at the
selected global scale and national granularity. In doing so, we sought
to enable the reader to be aware of the nuances of the different scales
and granularity of information underpinning our CLD, as well as our
process of carefully reconciling causality, over 950 variables to 39
variables and 1150 links to 105 links to maximise the information
conveyed while balancing readability. It is also important to note that,
due to their qualitative and static ﻿ nature, CLDs do not enable us to
comprehend the dynamics of the system, including nonlinear and emergent
behaviour, non-intuitive quantitative results and time delays.103
Complex systems models, although with their own challenges and
limitations,104 provide the opportunity to quantitatively analyse the
dynamics of a system and gain insights into the potentially far-reaching
impacts of our decisions.105 However, ﻿ complex ﻿ systems models that
explicitly examine societal collapse in contemporary society are
underdeveloped. The World3 system dynamics model106 --- an evidence
point in this study (refer to Supplementary Information D).107 --- is
the eminent model of relevance, with only a limited number of studies
building on it. World3 examines the potential for
"overshoot-and-collapse" given ﻿ population and industrial growth within
the finite carrying capacity of the natural world system, implicitly
accounting for ﻿ climate change and explicitly accounting for food
availability. The information contained in our CLD and empirical
evidence base may be useful in identifying and informing opportunities
to improve these existing ﻿ complex systems ﻿ modelling capabilities for ﻿
climate change, food insecurity and societal collapse scenarios. For
example, our CLD highlights important factors at global scale and
national granularity that World3 does not incorporate because it is
defined at global scale and granularity.108 World3 does not distinguish
heterogenous characteristics of nations, such as distribution of ﻿
population or geographic endowment of natural resources. It also does
not account for international interactions, such as food trade, conflict
and migration. Relatedly, World3 evaluates societal collapse only by
natural mortality (defined by food availability, age and pollution) and
does not include the other two ﻿ population loss secondary determinants,
as noted in the previous sentence, nor the three institutional breakdown
secondary determinants. While our empirical evidence base may provide
useful direction to datasets, it is important to note that
quantitatively defining these relationships, particularly thresholds as
discussed in Section 4.1, remains a key challenge of developing ﻿ complex
﻿systems models. Nonetheless, given that individuals associate with
national identity, business governance and policy-making are
concentrated at national level, and international interactions underpin
the functioning of contemporary society it could be valuable to model
societal collapse risk profiles of different nations to inform the
prioritisation and development of intervention strategies. [\[FIGURE 5

identified an empirical evidence base of ﻿ climate change, food
insecurity and societal collapse in contemporary society and structured
the evidence base using a novel-format CLD defined at global scale and
national granularity. Two types of future work could extend from the
results of this chapter. Identification of gaps in the spread of
evidence across the CLD may guide future data-driven efforts to examine
these causal relationships and define thresholds. The CLD and evidence
base may be used to develop quantitative ﻿ modelling capabilities,
particularly by transforming the structure of World3 to account for
heterogenous national characteristics and international interactions.
Three types of future work could extend from the methodology and
literature synthesis. The causal pathway examined in this chapter could
be further detailed by re-applying the methodology using the
institutional breakdown set of societal collapse proxies instead of the ﻿
population loss set. The methodology, using either set of societal
collapse proxies, could be applied to detail other causal pathways
between ﻿ climate change and societal collapse. The methodology,
excluding the contemporary time- period limitation, could be applied to
document the information in the historical studies identified in the
literature review. Similarly, the methodology could be applied to
construct CLDs at different scales and granularities. It is hoped that
this chapter has contributed to developing our understanding of the
causal pathways through which ﻿ climate change poses an ﻿ existential risk
to humanity and facilitates opportunities for future work. [\[REFERENCES

from climate change research. • [This is **intended to build** on the
**previous chapter**]{.underline}, [in which Catherine
Richards]{.underline}, Richard Lupton, and Julian Allwood [provide an
empirical assessment of one **highly concerning**]{.underline} [risk
cascade]{.underline} involving climate change and highlight its
potential contribution to global catastrophic and existential risk. •
Climate change is one of the most empirically well-studied risks and has
deep links to pre-existing bodies of literature, such as disaster risk
management, environmental studies, and food security. • Drawing on these
studies and more, the chapter reflects on how to frame research
questions in existential risk, what causes catastrophic climate change
to be neglected by climate and existential risk researchers alike, and
how to incorporate assessments of response risk and co-benefits into
thinking about catastrophic climate change. This short chapter brings
together a number of important ideas and draws readers attention to
other extant bodies of literature. The relative value of ﻿ co-benefits
approaches is discussed in other chapters in this volume, including
Chapter 4, in more detail. The dangers of ﻿ response risks are further
discussed in Chapter 2. 1. [Asking the **Wrong Questions** for the
**Right Reasons** **Within**]{.underline} [Existential Risk Studies it
is common to hear]{.underline} people ask [the question "is ﻿ climate
change an ﻿ existential risk?"]{.underline}, and [many]{.underline} who
ask this question [answer **negatively**]{.underline},
[arguing]{.underline} that [as a result ﻿ climate change is not an
important topic of research **within the field**]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, whether it is [answered affirmatively or
not,]{.underline} [this question is **misguided**]{.underline}. There
are three reasons for thinking this. [Firstly]{.underline}, [it makes
little sense on a **probabilistic** level]{.underline}; whether
something will be [a threat to]{.underline} our [collective existence is
not]{.underline} a [**binary** matter]{.underline}, [it is a question of
likelihood]{.underline}. However, **[many researchers]{.underline}**
[within Existential Risk Studies **mistakenly**]{.underline} [conflict ﻿
existential risk with **events**]{.underline} [that could be existential
﻿catastrophes]{.underline}. [Secondly]{.underline}, ﻿ [[climate]{.mark}
change is not a **single uniform process**]{.underline} that will affect
everyone in the same way; [it is a set of **diffuse
impacts**]{.underline} [to different]{.underline} ﻿ exposed
[populations]{.underline}, [interacting with different ﻿ vulnerabilities
and ﻿ exposures]{.underline}, and [[activating]{.mark} different **[risk ﻿
cascades]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Richards et al. show, [it
[will]{.mark} inevitably [interact with]{.mark} a **host** of [other
threats]{.mark} (not only ﻿ **food security** and **societal
collapse**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} even [factors such
as]{.underline} the explosivity of ﻿ [volcanic eruptions or]{.underline}
the [emergence of **zoonotic pathogens**),]{.underline}1 and [these can
**interact**]{.underline} with one another [to [create
**reinforcing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [feedback loops or
**"[global]{.mark} systems [death spirals]{.mark}"**.]{.underline}2
Finally, "﻿ existential risk" is too vague and arbitrary a concept for
the question to ever be answered. All the definitions of ﻿ existential
risk that have received the greatest public attention thus far, such as
Toby ﻿ Ord's, focused not in terms of an impact on humanity at any point
in time but rather in terms of "the loss of long-term future value";3
either referring to the author(s) particular vision of a high-tech
intergalactic utopia, or a fuzzy undefined idea of "our potential".4

#### Heg Decked \-- [Domestic crises]{.underline} and [Ukraine]{.underline}

Marwa **El-Shinawy 22**, Assistant Prof. at International American
University for Specialized Studies, 3/1/2022, "Putin puts an end to US
Hegemony,"

The [Ukrainian crisis is showing **day after day** the **weakness** of
the]{.underline} current US [administration]{.underline} headed by Biden
[in a way that **confirms** that the era of American **[hegemony is
about to end]{.mark}**]{.underline}. President [[Biden]{.mark} may have
[made]{.mark}]{.underline} many [[**heroic statements** ahead
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the military operation in [[Ukraine, but]{.mark}
as soon [as Putin decided]{.mark} to opt for [a **military
solution**]{.mark}]{.underline} to get to the negotiating table, [[Biden
**withdrew**]{.mark} from the battle, **shamelessly failing** the
Ukrainian president]{.underline}. The situation provoked the world's
ridicule and the astonishment of the Ukrainian president, who did not
have sufficient ability or experience to properly assess the political
situation. President [[Biden]{.mark} has [managed]{.mark} the
[Ukraine]{.mark} crisis [in the **worst**]{.mark} **possible
[way]{.mark}**[, showing the]{.mark} **whole [world]{.mark}** [that he
can deter Russia]{.mark} when the actual truth [is **certainly the
opposite**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States may have the ability
to project its power anywhere in the world, but [when dealing with
another great power's **s**phere **o**f **i**nfluence, [its deterrence
capacity is]{.mark} **greatly [diminished]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
is not the first time that the weakness of the United States against
Russia has been shown. The reluctance of the United States to take a
hostile decision toward Russia appeared before in 2014 when Putin
annexed Crimea during the Obama administration. At the time, many
scathing criticisms of the Obama administration were directed, but he
was able to sidestep the situation and show the United States as a
powerful hegemon, but reluctant to interfere in matters of Russian
national security. But this time the matter is very different. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [pushed Ukraine to provoke
Russia, despite knowing that its ability to protect Ukraine is **very
limited**]{.underline} for multiple reasons. First, Ukraine does little
to benefit US interests. And secondly, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[**cannot deter Russia** in its
**s**]{.underline}]{.mark}phere **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfluence. Third, [the long and costly wars
of]{.underline} the twenty-first century in [[Afghanistan and
Iraq]{.mark} have **[drained]{.mark} popular [support]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} US-led military **[interventions]{.mark}**
abroad]{.underline}. More importantly, [NATO]{.underline} forces and the
European Union [will not play an **important role** other
than]{.underline} imposing [sanctions]{.underline} and travel bans, as
the European market is highly dependent on Russian natural gas. [[Add
to]{.mark} all of the above **[internal]{.mark} American
[problems]{.mark}** [such as **inflation**]{.mark}, the [**immigrant
crisis**, and]{.mark} **rising [nationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
all these reasons, politicians from both the Republican and Democratic
parties leveled sharp criticism that amounted to mocking Biden's
contradictory actions that undermine the hegemony of the United States
in the international arena. For example, JD Vance, a candidate for the
US Senate, said in a statement on Twitter, "the foreign policy
establishment that led Ukraine directly into the slaughterhouse deserves
nothing but scorn." Also, in another statement, Kevin McCarthy and GOP
leaders said: "Sadly, President Biden consistently chose appeasement and
his tough talk on Russia was never followed by strong action. Republican
Senator Lindsay Graham, speaking about Biden, also said in the same
vein" You said a couple of years ago that Putin did not want you to win
because you're the only person that could go toe-to-toe with him. Well
right now, [Mr. President, you're playing **footsie** with **Putin. He's
walking all over you**]{.underline}."

#### Unipolarity's [structurally]{.underline} unworkable.

Foundation, foreign policy professor at Columbia University's School of
International Public Affairs; "A bolder American foreign policy means
more values and less war,"
https://tcf.org/content/commentary/a-bolder-american-foreign-policy-means-more-values-and-less-war/\]

The **[Gaza]{.underline}** war and the regional conflicts it has
unleashed are **[revealing]{.underline}** that, [no matter how much
p]{.underline}olitical, [**financial**, and **military** capital
[Washington]{.mark} invests, it [can **no longer force**]{.mark} the
policy [**outcomes**]{.mark} it wants]{.underline}---if it ever could.
At every turn, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
**[enabled]{.mark}**]{.underline} the Israeli invasion and decimation of
Gaza, even as the Biden administration has touted its hopes for peace.
It is [[a **losing strategy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The world knows that
the United States could force an end to the Israeli campaign and has
chosen not to, and [Washington's]{.underline} international
[**[rep]{.mark}utation** [is]{.mark} near [an **all-time
low**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A growing portion of the American electorate
appears to be turning against Biden, at least in part [because of the
**hypocritical** U.S. policy]{.underline} on Palestine. America's [role
in]{.underline} the [[war has]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
[[been]{.mark} **politically** [costly]{.mark}.]{.underline} By the
**[[amoral]{.underline}]{.mark}** measure of military victory,
Washington has also been **[[ineffective]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
combined might of the United States and Israel has not been enough to
achieve Israel's stated goals, including the release of hostages and
dismantling of Hamas. And American firepower has failed to deter Houthi
attacks on Red Sea shipping. The United States has a way out of this
mess, but it must act quickly: [Washington needs]{.underline} to develop
a recalibrated foreign policy tailored to America's [more **limited
power**]{.underline}, and to a more competitive, less easily regimented
global environment. While the government and American policy elites
might not be ready to hear this message, sooner or later they will have
to reckon with reality. In the meantime, progressives must begin
developing a U.S. foreign policy that promotes American values while
being more attuned to Washington's attenuated influence. [An
**Inevitable Transition** Washington's [**inability** to drive
events]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Middle East [or achieve policy goals,
and its **shrinking** global **standing**]{.underline}, are symptomatic
of a long-term trend. American hegemony, while not fully expired, is in
retreat. The United States must contend with an increasingly dynamic
global balance of power[. In the emerging world order[, it is **no
longer possible** for **one**]{.mark}]{.underline} or a few dominant
**[[state]{.underline}]{.mark}**s [[to **impose** their will]{.mark}
on]{.underline} smaller **[countries]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} on
the swelling array of [**hybrid** and **nonstate actors**]{.underline}
that populate modern-day wars. Many so-called [middle
powers]{.underline} choose to [balance]{.underline} multiple,
overlapping [alliances]{.underline} over preferential relationships with
Washington. As the international order is transformed, the United States
looks increasingly like just one player, albeit a significantly powerful
one, among many. This moment of transition contains elements of both
risk and reward for the United States. On the one hand, America is
well-placed to be a leader in the new international order. It is still
the most powerful country with the most alliances, the most attractive
economy, a huge military footprint, and a dominant platform in world
culture. Washington needs to develop a recalibrated foreign policy
tailored to America's more limited power. But Washington will only be a
beneficiary of the new order if it is willing to change the way it
approaches its foreign policy. And right now, the rules-based order
Washington claims to represent and the United States' already damaged
moral authority---an important pillar of its international
influence---both look increasingly tenuous. In a previous commentary,
"Time to Discard the Bad Policy That Enabled the Gaza War," we drew on
conversations with dozens of policy experts and officials to map the
roots of American policy misalignment in the Middle East. We argued
that, before October 7, the United States had bought into the idea that
the Middle East could be stabilized by a mixture of realpolitik,
economic self-interest, authoritarianism, and managing rather than
resolving wars, including the Israeli--Palestinian conflict. We argued
that [[the American **approach** has]{.mark} proven
**counterproductive**, increasing **challenges**]{.underline} to U.S.
interests and [international **standing**, and [lead]{.mark}ing
[to]{.mark} an unending cycle of **[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}
that spread human misery [while **deepening**]{.underline} the Middle
East's [strategic **malaise**.]{.underline} Until now, [Washington has
refused to acknowledge its shrinking **hegemony**. It has tried to stay
the course]{.underline}, and [ended up]{.underline} in an even weaker
position: [**[multiple wars]{.underline}**,]{.mark} severely eroded
moral authority, [and increasing **[insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Here, we argue that the United States can negotiate these changes and
still maximize its global influence, but only if it changes its approach
to foreign policy. Mismatched Ambitions and Influence Simply put, [a
**realignment**]{.underline} of the international order [is
**underway**]{.underline}, and American foreign policy is not keeping
up. At least since the U.S. invasion of Iraq, American foreign policy
has been [out of sync with U.S. capabilities]{.underline}: Even when its
power was undisputed, the United States was unable to act as the world's
policeman, but nevertheless sought to assert itself as the indispensable
global power. [A series of [**events**, bad **policies**, and
**setbacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} since the 2003
invasion---**[[painful]{.underline}]{.mark}** not only [[for
America's]{.mark} self-[image]{.mark}]{.underline} but for many
communities destabilized or destroyed in the shockwaves---have been
insufficient to force a correction. Now, [a more **multipolar** order is
**emerging**]{.underline}, one in which the United States is likely to
remain a preeminent player, perhaps the single most influential state.
But Washington will no longer be able to determine outcomes or assume
that its economic and political heft insulate it from paying major costs
for its missteps. U.S. government officials and many in the policy elite
acknowledge that the world is changing. But they are not quite ready to
contemplate, at least in public, an American strategy that accepts a
more modest understanding of U.S. influence; or that accepts that
Washington will have to triage its priorities on the global stage.
President Trump's "America First" and President Biden's "foreign policy
for the middle class" had one thing in common: neither acknowledged that
U.S. power is in relative decline. Despite many differences, both
doctrines began with a false belief that Washington could sustain
international dominance at minimal cost and risk. Like pre-October 7
Middle East policy, these ambitious proposals to reconfigure U.S.
foreign policy all too often disintegrate on contact with the real
world. Sooner or later, one U.S. administration or another will have to
confront reality: [there is **no**]{.underline} magic [**formula** that
will allow]{.underline} [**the** U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to maintain its current level of **global power**
and **influence**]{.underline}, prioritize its national interests and
domestic politics, [and continue to project]{.underline} moral
[authority without incurring huge]{.underline}, politically unpalatable
[costs]{.underline}. At least since the invasion of Iraq, U.S. foreign
policy has been out of sync with its capabilities. The good news is that
the United States can maintain its position of global leadership. Less
welcome news is that this will mean a painful rethink of America's place
in the world and a different sort of leadership than the kind the United
States displayed during the Cold War and the decades after it. Instead,
it must act more like France and Germany do in the EU, or American
automakers eventually did in response to globalization: leading as the
first among equals in a competitive marketplace, and recognizing the
outer limits of its influence and power. Crucially, the United States
must understand the American value-add relative to other countries, by
genuinely prioritizing issues like multilateralism and human rights that
are core to its identity, and which its competitors disregard. If it can
strike the right balance, the United States can accomplish important
good for the world while pursuing its own interests and acknowledging
the interests and priorities of other countries. The Middle East would
be a good place to pilot this new foreign policy---not only because the
current violence and crisis demand better policies, but also because it
is in the Middle East that U.S. aspirations are most strikingly
misaligned with actual American power. A New Approach A new American
approach would prioritize global cooperation to meet the sweeping
structural challenges of our age. In bilateral relations with other
states, the United States ought to recenter values. To execute this new
approach, the U.S. government would have to set realistic expectations
about what American power can achieve in regions like the Middle East.
Neither the United States nor Israel, for example, can dismantle
Hamas---especially not with the current war in Gaza. The brutal military
campaign has become an exercise in radicalizing the Palestinian
population against Israel and the United States, and is driving the
Middle East into region-wide conflict. What is within American power is
putting a stop to the Gaza war---not just pausing the fighting---and
pursuing a political settlement to the Israeli--Palestinian conflict,
based on international law (including the 1967 borders), that reduces
the chance of mass violence by any party. These actions would
significantly improve regional security, and American standing in the
Middle East and the world, while taking away a significant pillar of
anti-American groups' platforms. The genuine pursuit of peace would also
be politically and financially costly, and take years across multiple
U.S. administrations. The United States needs to acknowledge that it
cannot achieve its goals alone, and must seek to share the
burden---including with key international competitors. America needs to
reframe Middle Eastern conflict and instability as a global systemic
issue on a par with COVID-19 or climate change, and seek a genuinely
multilateral response that includes rival superpowers, including, for
example, China. For years, China has been a free-rider on American
security guarantees in the Middle East while lambasting Washington for
its regional policies, including on Israel--Palestine, propping up
Iran's economy, and seeking improved relations with American allies and
partners. Beijing clearly has a vested interest in the stability of a
region that is essential to its energy supply and the global trade
routes that underpin its export-led economy, and has dipped its toes
into mediation in the region. The United States should push for more‚ by
publicly calling on the four other permanent members of the UN Security
Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom) to join Washington
in supporting an Israeli--Palestinian peace process that includes a
prominent role for regional mediation, and a Middle Eastern security
framework that they jointly guarantee, with the United States and China
taking the lead. Actively encouraging autocratic competitor states to
become more involved in the region might appear to be counter to U.S.
interests and values. But a multilateral diplomatic effort on
Israel--Palestine, and the development of a regional security
architecture guaranteed by the Security Council that prioritizes
conflict resolution and regional detente, would free the United States
to stand up for its core values in ways that it struggles to achieve
when it acts alone. The United States is often hesitant to push its
regional allies to comply with international humanitarian or human
rights law, because it fears it will lose influence over their behavior,
or that they might realign toward competitors like China. The Biden
administration hoped its post-October 7 bear hug of Israel would provide
it with influence over the military campaign in Gaza. But it hasn't
worked at all---Israel's assault has been merciless, and it is now
bearing down on Rafah, the last refuge of more than 1.5 million
Palestinians. Meanwhile, keeping China completely out of the region is a
lost cause: many regional players, including Israel and U.S. partners
like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, are already seeking
improved relations with China, and will continue to do so in future.
Washington could secure its core strategic interests---trade and
energy---with the other elements of this policy shift in place: A peace
process would be underway in the Israeli--Palestinian conflict. The new
security architecture would improve regional stability and, crucially,
catalyze conflict resolution rather than merely managing conflict.
Regional conflict between global superpowers would be somewhat
mitigated. Washington could then condition military and other forms of
support to its regional allies and partners (for example, Egypt, Israel,
and Saudi Arabia) on improved human rights and rule of law. In doing so,
it would also call the bluff of partners who have tacitly threatened to
defect to the Chinese or Russian camp, but know that neither Beijing nor
Moscow is willing or able to provide the kind of security guarantees the
U.S currently does. No More Hegemony on the Cheap A dose of realism
would be required to successfully push for multilateral peace-brokering
and stability initiatives while pursuing a values-based bilateral
foreign policy. These policies would by no means achieve perfect
outcomes, and would require the United States to accept some big
up-front costs, including increased regional influence for its rivals
and turbulent relations with long-standing partners. Yet failure to
correct the course would have much worse consequences. [[If Washington
continues]{.mark} on its **current path**]{.underline} in the Middle
East, [[it will remain on the **hook** for]{.mark} **regional
[security]{.mark}** as its influence fades]{.underline} and China and
Russia continue to exploit conflicts to their own benefit. The reality
is that [[if]{.mark} American **[leaders]{.mark}** continue to
**[pursue]{.mark}** a policy of **[heg]{.mark}emony**]{.underline} on
the cheap, while shunning other powers' help on major structural issues,
the American competitive advantage in world affairs will continue to
shrink. [[Washington will be **viewed** as]{.mark} just another
**[self-interested]{.mark} power**]{.underline} among many, one
struggling to maintain alliances with states whose values do not align
with its own, yet unable to make some of the transactional
accommodations that nondemocratic competitors have no problem making.
The American government and policy elite might not yet be ready to
openly espouse a strategy that accepts the limits to U.S. influence and
opens doors to competitors. But the realignment of relative world power
is already underway, and in practice [[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has two
obvious choices. It [[can]{.mark} **double down**]{.underline} on the
status quo, and continue [**pretending** it is still the]{.underline}
world's sole **[superpower]{.underline}** while paying lip service to
values that it fails to back with meaningful policies---thus
**[[forfeit]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** still [more [**influence**.
Or]{.mark} it can **[embrace]{.mark} change**]{.underline}, steer [into
[the]{.mark} multipolar **[transition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and seek
[[to lead]{.underline}]{.mark}, both in partnership with
[[other]{.underline}]{.mark} strong [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark},
and as a force for good in the world. Political constraints make it
easier to stay on the current, flawed path, at least in the short term.
But the best choice is clear: [a more **[modest]{.mark}**]{.underline}
international **[[role]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the United States
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} ultimately [[be]{.mark} the
braver]{.underline} and **[[more effective]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Containment [trades off]{.underline} with domestic investments, which makes collapse inevitable

**Shifrinson 21**, Assistant Professor of International Relations at
Boston University. (Joshua R. Itzkowitz, Winter 2021, "Neo-Primacy and
the Pitfalls of US Strategy toward China", *The Washington Quarterly*,
43:4, 90-91)

The US Faces Domestic Constraints Third, [neo-primacy is of
**questionable domestic sustainability**]{.underline}---indeed, [it has
the potential to **undermine** the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} [own strength]{.underline}.
Independent of competition with China, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates likely [**[needs]{.mark} substantial
[investments]{.mark}** [in **healthcare**, **education**, and
**infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline} (among others) over the coming
decades. Although some of these could be funded as part of a
neo-primacist competition with China, [other social
programs]{.underline} ([e.g., Social Security and public
pensions]{.underline}) [are likely to require additional funding,
particularly as US demographics change]{.underline}.59 [This situation
is further exacerbated as bills come due for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} **[prior spending]{.underline}**; as
the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported [even
**before**]{.underline} the **[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic
[**reduced revenue** and **increased borrowing**]{.underline}, [by
2028]{.underline} "[[the]{.mark} \[Federal\] [government will spend
**more on**]{.mark} **net [interest]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} it will
spend on either **[defense]{.mark}** or **nondefense discretionary
outlays**]{.underline}." 60 Of course, the United States can service its
financial obligations by raising taxes, accepting additional debt, or
both.61 Unless the US economy grows faster than US obligations, however,
the United States will face a difficult choice in the years ahead. On
the one hand, policymakers can constrain the funding available for
foreign activities in order to devote the marginal resource to domestic
needs. In this situation, [neo-[primacy could prove **unsustainable**,
as the **resources** ]{.mark}**needed** to compete with China for
international dominance at a time of declining US relative power [prove
lacking]{.mark} due to **internal demands**]{.underline}. [The United
States would then risk taking on foreign obligations and exacerbating
tensions with China without the wherewithal to service these
missions.]{.underline} On the other hand, [policymakers might opt to
**suppress domestic consumption** to fund the contest with
China]{.underline}. Here, however, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[could]{.mark} end up **[harm]{.mark}ing
[its]{.mark} long-term [competitiveness]{.mark}** [by
**foregoing**]{.mark} the sort of socio-economic [spending that would
ensure]{.mark} US **[economic and military
dynamism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In effect, [current [military
consumption]{.mark} would **[crowd out]{.mark} future [domestic
investment]{.mark}**. Neo-[primacy]{.mark} then [risks]{.mark} being
left unworkable by [**dragging down** the]{.mark} **underlying
[foundations of]{.mark} US [strength]{.mark}** over time.]{.underline}
To be sure, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[' ability to
borrow at favorable rates while attracting foreign investment can
moderate the intensity with which these guns-versus-butter choices have
to be made. Still, they **do not eliminate the problem**]{.underline}.
[All spending choices entail **opportunity costs**, and there are
grounds to believe neo-primacy's costs leave the approach
**unworkable**.]{.underline}

#### Decline is [inevitable]{.underline}\-\--attempts to sustain it guarantee conflicts like the Ukraine crisis.

**Dogan, 2022** (Haluk Dogan 2/22/22. PhD candidate in Strategy and
Security within the Department of Politics at the University of Exeter,
where he also completed his MA in International Relations. "The US
provoked the Russian invasion to maintain its global primacy."
https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/the-us-provoked-the-russian-invasion-to-maintain-its-global-primacy-55000,
ADA-62)

[In a moot effort to cling to its hegemony and keep NATO relevant,
Washington]{.underline} has, in turn, [allowed the invasion to
happen]{.underline}.

Following a long period of escalation, Russian President Vladimir
[Putin]{.underline} has ordered troops into Eastern Ukraine's two
breakaway regions, prompting immediate Western condemnation and an
emergency UN Security Council meeting. While Moscow stands accused by
the West of increasing acts of aggression on the Ukrainian border, the
[invasion was **not a one-sided event**]{.underline}.

For months, [the Anglo-American bloc has been **unwilling to
de-escalate** the crisis]{.underline}. [Washington]{.underline} and
London have [aimed to resuscitate the case for]{.underline} the
[NATO]{.underline} alliance, to invalidate arguments for a separate
European Union-wide security arrangement, [and to weaken Russia in
seeking to prevent the emergence of rival blocs]{.underline} in Eurasia
and the Asia-Pacific regions.

However, to put it bluntly, **[this strategy will not reverse the
decline of American hegemony]{.underline}**.

Is the 'transatlantic alliance' back?

A couple of days before the invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy expressed his disappointment at the failure of his Western
"friends" to support Ukraine vis-a-vis Russian aggression. This
perception is consistent with Ukrainian officials' previous accusation
that US President Joe Biden gave Moscow a "green light" to invade.

Kiev's disappointment is completely understandable.

Giving Moscow the green light is as much about transatlantic relations
as it is about West-Russia or Ukraine-Russia relations. [The US'
post-World War II hegemony is predicated on its domination in
continental Europe, with NATO acting as the principal mechanism for
achieving American primacy]{.underline}.

The Anglo-American strategy now focuses on preventing European states
from acting independently. The Russian threat is thought to serve that
aim, pushing Europe to be in need of American and British power.

The Anglo-American bloc has never been happy with France's attempts to
establish an alternative European security mechanism, or with Germany's
relations with Russia -- especially in terms of cooperation on the Nord
Stream gas pipeline. The growing economic ties between the European
Union and China are also causes of concern for the Anglo-American
alliance.

In this context, it is not surprising Biden pointed out at the 2021
Virtual Munich Security Conference: "America is back. The transatlantic
alliance is back...The partnership between Europe and the United States,
in my view, is and must remain the cornerstone of all that we hope to
accomplish in the 21st Century, just as we did in the 20th Century."

Eliminating Russia in the 'Great Game'?

Neither NATO nor Western states will go to war with Russia over the
invasion of Ukraine. The invasion justifies their efforts to undermine
Russia economically and politically.

However, [the strategy of weakening Russia is not only about its
military activities in Eastern Europe]{.underline}. [The Kremlin has
long embraced an approach that emphasises Russia's great power status in
a multipolar world]{.underline}, in direct opposition to the US' vision
of a unipolar world in which it reigns supreme.

Therefore, [the Anglo-American goal is]{.underline} not only to weaken
Russia via economic sanctions, or harm Moscow's economic interests in
Europe, but also [to divert its attention and energy away from the Indo
and Asia-Pacific in particular, with the aim of hindering Russia's
partnerships with India and China]{.underline}.

India has decades-long ties with Russia, and New Delhi recently started
receiving Russian S-400 defence systems. But India is also a member of
Quad -- an alliance involving the US, Japan, and Australia, which aims
to counter China's growing assertiveness. Both the US and Britain have
long been pushing India to cooperate with them in dealing with China.

At the last Quad meeting, the US requested that India stand by its side
in the face of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Another important topic
for discussion was the growing economic and diplomatic relationships
between Russia and China.

[The Anglo-American bloc hopes that the Ukraine invasion will severely
wound Russia, preventing it from being an important rival actor in their
confrontation with China]{.underline}.

The question of American decline

Anglo-American domination will push Europe into submission to some
extent, and Russia will be wounded. But will this reverse the
unravelling of American hegemony in the long term?

As Russian President Vladimir [Putin made clear]{.underline} in his
televised speech just before the invasion, [sanctions imposed by the
West will not dissuade Russia from attempting to preserve its standing
on the world stage]{.underline}.

[NATO has already **lost prestige and power**, and the invasion of
Ukraine will only **worsen this situation**]{.underline}. [Increasing
the Anglo-American bloc's weight in Europe due to the conflict in
Eastern Europe will also have a **negative impact on their ability to
contain China**]{.underline} in Asia.

As it follows Russia's annexation of Crimea, Russia's invasion of
Ukraine will not cause France to abandon its call for strategic autonomy
for the EU entirely, nor will it change the interdependence of Europe
and Russia on gas.

The Anglo-American coalition's gas diversification efforts in favour of
Europe will affect the strategic dynamics in the Mediterranean and the
Middle East. Yet it is not likely to obstruct the Nord Stream 2 project,
despite Washington wanting to see this. [Due to the steady erosion of
the US' hegemonic position in the world economy]{.underline}, it appears
that [China will continue to be the EU's biggest trading
partner]{.underline}.

[India has already signalled that it will remain neutral on]{.underline}
the [Ukraine]{.underline} crisis, which implies that Russia's invasion
of Ukraine will have little impact on the close ties between Moscow and
New Delhi.

More crucially, [this situation appears to have given Moscow and Beijing
**further reasons to act together and get closer**]{.underline}, despite
their conflicting interests in Asia. They share a common desire to
challenge the Western-dominated international system. Should Russia be
wounded by Western sanctions, it will rely on China in economic terms to
some extent, while their collective security actions will hasten the
demise of US hegemony.

In the case of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there is no absolute
winner. Indeed, **[nothing will change in terms of the ongoing and
gradual unravelling of global American hegemony]{.underline}**.

### 2NC \-\-- Retrenchment

#### Transitions now is key -- its peaceful -- otherwise reassertion of primacy [collapses]{.underline} the international order

**Mazarr 16** (Michael, Senior Political Scientist at the RAND
Corporation, 12-12-2016, \"The Once and Future Order,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2016-12-12/once-and-future-order)//EAW

Yet the survival of that order---indeed, of any ordering principles at
all---now seems in question. Dissatisfied countries such as China and
Russia view its operation as unjust, and people around the world are
angry about the economic and social price they've had to pay for
globalization. It's not clear exactly what President-elect Donald
Trump's views are on the role of the United States in the world, much
less the liberal order, but his administration will confront the most
profound foreign policy task that any new administration has faced in 70
years: rethinking the role that the international order should play in
U.S. grand strategy. Whatever Trump's own views, the instincts of many
in [Washington will be to attempt to restore a unified, U.S.-dominated
system by confronting the rule breakers and aggressively promoting
liberal values. This would be the wrong approach; in trying to hold the
old order together, Washington could end up accelerating its
dissolution.]{.underline} What the United States must learn to do
instead is navigate and lead the more diversified, pluralistic system
that is now materializing---one with a bigger role for emerging-market
powers and more ways for countries other than the United States to lead
than the current order provides. The creation of the current order, like
that of its two modern predecessors---the Concert of Europe and the
League of Nations---was an effort to design the basic architecture of
international relations in the wake of a war among major powers. All
three orders used a range of tools---organizations, treaties, informal
meetings, and norms---to attain the goals of their creators. The current
order's main institutions include the United Nations, NATO, the World
Trade Organization, the In­ternational Monetary Fund (IMF), the World
Bank, and the G-20. Together, these bodies have influenced almost every
aspect of the modern world. The UN has provided a forum for the
in­ternational community to rally around shared interests and ratify
joint action. The international financial institutions have boosted
trade and stabilized the global economy during crises. Multilateral
treaties and agreements brokered through various bodies have helped
avoid chaotic arms races and uncontrolled nuclear proliferation. And
dense global networks of experts, activists, businesses, and nonprofits,
operating within the framework of the liberal order, have built
consensus and taken action on hundreds of other issues. It's not clear
exactly what Trump's views are on the role of the United States in the
world. The rules of any such order are not self-enforcing. When combined
with direct state power, however, they encourage governments to accept
norms of conduct such as nonaggression, the avoidance of nuclear
weapons, and respect for human rights. The United States would be wise
to do what it can to sustain these norms in the future. The trick is
figuring out how to do so---and what, given all the changes the world is
now experiencing, the emerging order should look like. The postwar
liberal order has proved remarkably stable. But it has always
incorporated two distinct and not necessarily reconcilable visions. One
is a narrow, cautious view of the UN and the core international
financial institutions as guardians of sovereign equality, territorial
inviolability, and a limited degree of free trade. The other is a more
ambitious agenda: protecting human rights, fostering democratic
political systems, promoting free-market economic reforms, and
encouraging good governance. [Until recently, the tension between these
two visions did not pose a serious problem.]{.underline} For many
decades, the Cold War allowed the United States and its allies to gloss
over the gap in the name of upholding a unified front against the
Soviets. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington fully
embraced the more ambitious approach by expanding NATO up to Russia's
doorstep; intervening to protect human rights in places such as the
Balkans and Libya; supporting uprisings, at least rhetorically, in the
name of democracy in countries including Egypt, Georgia, and Myanmar;
and applying increasingly sophisticated economic sanctions to illiberal
governments. [In the newly unipolar international system, Washington
often behaved as if the narrower concept of order had been superseded by
the more ambitious one.]{.underline} At the same time, the United States
often took advantage of its preeminence to sidestep the order's rules
and institutions when it found them inconvenient. [The problem with this
approach, of course, is that international orders gain much of their
potency by defining the sources of prestige and status within the
system]{.underline}, such as participation in and leadership of
international institutions. Their stability depends on leading members
abiding---and being seen to abide---by key norms of behavior. When the
leader of an order consistently appears to others to interpret the rules
as it sees fit, the legitimacy of the system is undermined and other
countries come to believe that the order offends, rather than sustains,
their dignity. An extreme version of this occurred in the 1930s, when a
series of perceived insults convinced Japan---once a strong supporter of
the League of Nations---that the system was a racist, Anglo-American
cabal designed to emasculate it. Partly as a result, Japan withdrew from
the league and signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy before
entering World War II. Today, a similar story is playing out as some
countries see the United States as applying norms selectively and in its
own favor, norms that are already tailored to U.S. interests. This is
persuading them that the system's main function is to validate the
United States' status and prestige at the expense of their own. The
United States would be wise to do what it can to sustain the order\'s
achievements. For years now, a number of countries, including Brazil,
India, South Africa, and Turkey, have found various ways to express
their frustration with the current rules. But [China and Russia have
become the two most important dissenters. These two countries view the
order very differently and have divergent ambitions and
strategies]{.underline}. Yet their broad complaints have much in common.
B[oth countries feel disenfranchised by a U.S.-dominated
system]{.underline} that imposes strict conditions on their
participation and, they believe, menaces their regimes by promoting
democracy. [And both countries have called for fundamental reforms to
make the order less imperial and more pluralistic.]{.underline} Russian
officials are particularly disillusioned. They believe that they made an
honest effort to join Western-led institutions after the fall of the
Soviet Union but were spurned by the West, which subjected them to a
long series of insults: NATO's attacks on Serbia in the Balkan wars of
the 1990s; NATO enlargement into eastern Europe; and Western support for
"color revolutions" in the early years of the new century, which
threatened or in some cases actually overthrew Russian-backed leaders in
several eastern European countries. In a June 2016 speech to Russian
diplomats, [Russian President Vladimir Putin complained that certain
Western states "continue stubborn attempts to retain their monopoly on
geopolitical domination,"]{.underline} arguing that this was leading to
a "confrontation between different visions of how to build the global
governance mechanisms in the 21st century." And Putin hasn't just
limited himself to complaining. In recent years, Russia has taken a
number of dramatic, sometimes violent steps---especially in Europe---to
weaken the U.S.-led order. [China also feels disrespected.]{.underline}
The financial crisis at the end of the last decade convinced many
Chinese that the West had entered a period of rapid decline and that
China deserved a more powerful voice in the international system. Since
then, Beijing has increased its influence in several institutions,
including the IMF and the World Bank. But the changes have not gone far
enough for many Chinese leaders. [They still]{.underline} chafe at
Western domination of these bodies, [perceive U.S. democracy promotion
as a threat, and resent the regional network of U.S. alliances that
surrounds China]{.underline}. Beijing has thus undertaken a range of
economic initiatives to gain more influence within the current order,
including increasing its development aid and founding the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank, which it clearly intends to compete with
the IMF and the World Bank. China has also pursued its interests in
defiance of global norms by building islands in contested international
waters and harassing U.S. aircraft in the South China Sea. Worrisome as
these developments are, it is important not to exaggerate the threats
they represent. Neither China nor Russia has declared itself an enemy of
the postwar order (although Russia is certainly moving in that
direction). Both continue to praise the core UN system and participate
actively in a host of institutions, treaties, and diplomatic processes.
Indeed, China has worked hard to embed itself ever more firmly in the
current order. In a 2015 speech in Seattle, Chinese President Xi Jinping
said that "China has been a participant, builder, and contributor" in,
of, and to the system and that it stood "firmly for the international
order" based on the purposes and principles outlined in the UN Charter.
China and Russia both rely on cross-border trade, international energy
markets, and global information networks---all of which depend heavily
on international rules and institutions. And at least for the time
being, neither country seems anxious to challenge the order militarily.
The United States often took advantage of its preeminence to sidestep
the order's rules. [Many major countries, including China and Russia,
are groping toward roles appropriate to their growing power in a rapidly
evolving international system.]{.underline} If that system is going to
persevere, their grievances and ambitions must be accommodated. This
will require a more flexible, pluralistic approach to institutions,
rules, and norms. Another threat to the liberal order comes from the
populist uprisings now under way in many countries around the world,
which have been spurred on by outrage at increasing economic inequality,
uneasiness with cultural and demographic changes, and anger at a
perceived loss of national sovereignty. For the liberal order to
survive, the populations of its member countries must embrace its basic
social and political values. That embrace is now weakening. The postwar
order has driven global integration and liberalization by encouraging
free-trade agreements, developing international law, and fostering
global communications networks. Such developments strengthened the order
in turn by cementing public support for liberal values. But the populist
rebellion against globalization now imperils that virtuous circle. The
populist surge has featured outbursts in Europe and the United States
against the perceived intrusions of a globalizing order. Public support
for new trade agreements has tumbled. Resentment toward supranational
authorities, such as the European Union, has risen steadily, as has
suspicion of and hostility toward immigrants and immigration. The
uprising has already claimed one major casualty---the United Kingdom's
EU membership---and is mutating into angry, xenophobic nationalism in
countries as diverse as Austria, Denmark, France, Greece, Hungary, the
Netherlands, Russia, Sweden, and the United States. So far, none of
these countries has totally rejected the international order. [Populism
remains a minority trend in most electorates, and support for liberal
principles remains robust in many countries.]{.underline} In a 2016
Gallup survey, for example, 58 percent of Americans polled indicated
that they saw trade as an opportunity rather than a threat---the highest
number since 1992. Similarly, a 2016 poll by the Pew Research Center
found that support for the UN among Americans had grown by nine points
since 2004, to a new peak of 64 percent. Reassuring as such findings
are, however, [if even a quarter or a third of citizens turn decisively
against liberal values in a critical mass of nations, it can destabilize
the entire system]{.underline}. In some cases, this happens because
radical parties or individuals can come to power without ever achieving
more than a plurality of support. More commonly, a rejectionist bloc can
cripple legislatures by obstructing steps, such as trade deals and arms
treaties, that would strengthen the prevailing order. And sometimes, as
happened with the British vote to leave the EU, committed opponents of
the order are joined by a larger number of worried citizens in a
successful effort to roll back elements of the system. [International
orders tend to rest on two pillars: the balance of power and prestige
among the leading members and some degree of shared values. Both of
these pillars look shaky today.]{.underline} For many years, U.S. grand
strategy has been based on the idea that the unitary U.S.-led order
reflected universal values, was easy to join, and exercised a
gravitational pull on other countries. Those assumptions do not hold as
strongly as they once did. I[f Washington hopes to sustain an
international system that can help avoid conflict, raise prosperity, and
promote liberal values, it will have to embrace a more diverse
order]{.underline}---one that operates in different ways for different
countries and regions and on different issues. The United States will be
tempted to resist such a change and to double down on the existing
liberal order by following the Cold War playbook: rallying democracies
and punishing norm breakers. But such a narrow order would create more
embittered outcasts and thus imperil the most fundamental objective of
any global order: keeping the peace among great powers. Dividing the
world into defenders and opponents of a shared order is also likely to
be less feasible than in the past. China's role in the global economy
and its standing as a regional power mean that it cannot be isolated in
the way the Soviet Union was. [Many of today's rising powers, moreover,
have preferences that are too diverse to gather into either a U.S.-led
system or a bloc opposed to it.]{.underline}

#### [Multipolarity]{.underline} \-\-- [inevitable]{.underline} and key to drive [US restraint]{.underline}.

Stephen **Walt 23**, PhD, Robert and Renee Belfer Professor of
International Affairs at Harvard, 3/7/2023, \"America Is Too Scared of
the Multipolar World,\"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/03/07/america-is-too-scared-of-the-multipolar-world/

Even if these efforts succeed (and there's no guarantee they will),
[[restoring unipolarity is]{.mark} probably
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [We are going to end up in 1) a
bipolar world]{.underline} (with the United States and China as the two
poles) **[or]{.underline}** 2) a lopsided version of
[multipolarity]{.underline} where the United States is first among a set
of unequal but still significant major powers (China, Russia, India,
possibly Brazil, and conceivably a rearmed Japan and Germany).

What sort of world would that be? International relations theorists are
divided on this question. Classical realists such as Hans Morgenthau
believed multipolar systems were less war-prone because states could
realign to contain dangerous aggressors and deter war. For them,
flexibility of alignment was a virtue. Structural realists such as
Kenneth Waltz or John Mearsheimer argued the opposite. They believed
bipolar systems were in fact more stable because the danger of
miscalculation was reduced; the two main powers knew the other would
automatically oppose any serious attempt to alter the status quo.
Moreover, the two main powers were not as dependent on allied support
and could keep their clients in line when necessary. For structural
realists, the flexibility inherent in a multipolar order creates greater
uncertainty and makes it more likely that a revisionist power will think
it can alter the status quo before the others can combine to stop it.

If the future world order is one of lopsided multipolarity and if such
orders are more war-prone, then there is some reason to worry. But
[multipolarity might not be]{.underline} that **[bad]{.underline}** for
the United States, provided it recognizes the implications and adjusts
its foreign policy appropriately.

For starters, let's recognize that [[unipolarity **wasn't**]{.mark}
**that [great]{.mark}** for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, and **[[especially]{.underline}]{.mark}** not for
those unfortunate [[countries that got the brunt of U.S.
attention]{.mark} in recent decades. [The unipolar era
included]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[Sept. 11]{.underline}]{.mark}**
terrorist attacks, [two expensive and]{.underline} ultimately
**[[unsuccessful]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S. [[wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}, some ill-advised **[[regime
changes]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that [led to **failed
states**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[a **financial
crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark} that altered U.S. domestic politics
dramatically, [[and]{.mark} the emergence of an]{.underline}
increasingly **[[ambitious China]{.underline}]{.mark}** whose rise was
partly facilitated by the United States' own actions. But the United
States hasn't learned much from the experience, given that it is still
listening to the strategic geniuses whose actions squandered
Washington's Cold War triumph and hastened unipolarity's end. The only
restraint on a unipolar power's actions is self-restraint, and
self-restraint is not something a crusader nation such as the United
States does very well.

[The return of [multipolarity will recreate]{.mark} a world where
Eurasia contains [several]{.mark} major [powers of varying
strengths]{.mark}]{.underline}. These states are likely to eye each
other warily, especially when they are in close proximity.
[[This]{.mark} situation [gives the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[considerable
[flexibility]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to **adjust its alignments** as
needed]{.underline}, just as it did when it allied with Stalinist Russia
in World War II and when it mended fences with Maoist China during the
Cold War. [The ability to pick and choose the proper allies is the
secret ingredient of]{.underline} the United States' past [foreign
policy successes]{.underline}: Its position as the only great power in
the Western Hemisphere gave it "free security" that no other great power
possessed, and it made the United States an especially desirable ally
whenever serious trouble arose. As I wrote way back in the 1980s: "For
the middle powers of Europe and Asia, the United States is the perfect
ally. Its aggregate power ensures that its voice will be heard and its
actions will be felt ... \[but\] it is far enough away so as not to pose
a significant threat \[to its allies\]."

In a multipolar world, the other [[major powers]{.mark} will gradually
[take on]{.mark} greater [responsibility for their own
security]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [reducing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[']{.underline} global [burdens]{.underline}. [India
is building up its military force]{.underline} as its economy grows, and
pacifist [Japan has pledged to double its defense spending]{.underline}
by 2027. That's not entirely good news, of course, because regional arms
races have their own risks and some of these states may eventually act
in ways that are dangerous or provocative. But apropos my first point
above, it's not as if the United States has done such a great job
keeping order in the Middle East, Europe, or even Asia in recent
decades. Are we 100 percent sure the local powers will do worse, or that
it would matter to Americans if they did?

[[Even if multipolarity has]{.mark} its [downsides]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see below), **[[trying to prevent it would be expensive
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** probably **[[futile]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** may eventually suffer a decisive
defeat in Ukraine (though that is by no means certain), but
it**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[vast size]{.mark}**, [**nuclear
arsenal**, and **abundant natural resources**]{.mark} will [keep it
within]{.mark} the [great power ranks]{.mark} no matter how the current
war turns out]{.underline}. **[[Export controls]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and internal challenges [[may slow China's rise]{.underline}]{.mark} and
its relative power may peak in the next decade, [[but it will
remain]{.mark} a major player and its military capabilities will
continue to improve. [Japan is]{.mark} still the world's [third largest
economy]{.mark}; it is [beginning]{.mark} a major [rearmament]{.mark}
progra]{.underline}m; and it could acquire a nuclear arsenal quickly if
it ever felt it had to. **[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s trajectory is
harder to forecast, but it [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [certainly
[wield greater weigh]{.mark}]{.underline}[t]{.mark} in the decades ahead
than it has in the past, and the United States has neither the ability
nor wish to prevent this. [Instead of engaging in a futile effort to
roll back the clock]{.underline}, therefore, [Americans should start
getting ready for a multipolar future]{.underline}.

Ideally a world of lopsided **[[multipolarity will encourage]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[to [move away
from]{.mark} its [instinctive]{.mark} reliance on [hard power and
coercion]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to put
[[greater]{.mark} weight on genuine [diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Du[ring the unipolar era, U.S. officials became accustomed to dealing
with problems by issuing demands and ultimatums and then **ramping up
pressure**]{.underline}, starting with sanctions and threats of force
and [then turning to **shock and awe** and **regime
change**]{.underline} if gentler measures of coercion didn't work. [The
disappointing results]{.underline}, alas, [speak for
themselves]{.underline}. In a multipolar world, by contrast, even the
strongest powers must pay more attention to what the others want and
work harder to persuade some of them to strike mutually beneficial
bargains. Take it or leave it diplomacy must give way to subtler
approaches and a lot more give-and-take; relying primarily on the mailed
fist will just lead others to distance themselves. In the worst case,
they'll start lining up in opposition.

Reassessing retrenchment's consequences With this more refined
understanding of retrenchment in hand, we can now turn to reassess its
international consequences. As noted in the introduction, [both pundits
and policymakers have long warned of retrenchment's immense costs which
result from the fact that it opens windows of opportunity for rivals to
improve their position in the international system]{.underline}. But
does retrenchment, indeed, regularly pave the way for rivals to acquire
important strategic assets? I argue that it does not. To make this
point, I proceed as follows. I first show that [[it is the]{.mark}
[collapse of]{.mark} a [great power's authority]{.mark}, [not]{.mark}
the [withdrawal of military force]{.mark} per se, [that]{.mark}
[presents]{.mark} [rivals]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [opportunity]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [expand]{.mark} their [influence]{.mark}]{.underline}. I
then make the case that [great powers engaging in three of the four
types of retrenchment my framework identifies should regularly be able
to avoid precipitating such authority collapse.]{.underline} Finally, I
highlight that [even when great powers engage in the one type of
retrenchment that does create such opportunities for rival gains, there
is good reason to believe that rivals will frequently not be able to
acquire these gains at negligible costs]{.underline}. What invites rival
expansion? Centering great power authority collapse In their warnings
about the dangers of strategic withdrawals, pundits and policymakers
centrally build on the assumption that whenever a great power removes
some its military capabilities from a certain geographic space, this
will open a window of opportunity allowing its rivals to expand their
influence into the area.Footnote33 In this section, I challenge this
popular belief, arguing that it is only when a great power's authority
collapses that the costs for rivals to extend their influence into the
space concerned sink dramatically. Following Weber, authority denotes
the 'legitimate exercise of imperative control' and is a function of
both material capability and legitimacy.Footnote34 The possession of
preponderant coercive capabilities and the ability to use them to issue
coercive threats is the cornerstone of any form of imperative control:
it generates widespread obedience as even those 'subjects who view the
ruler's orders as fundamentally unjust have an interest in compliance if
said orders are backed by preponderant power and the threat of
sanctions'. At the same time, stability and longevity of rule require at
least some degree of legitimacy in the sense that subjects follow the
ruler's commands quasi-voluntarily, i.e. they willingly comply with its
demands for whatever ulterior motivation and therefore do not need to be
constantly monitored and punished.Footnote35 [Historically, great powers
have exercised authority not only over their own homeland but also minor
powers and other political organisations outside of
it]{.underline}.Footnote36 Such cases of spatially extensive authority
in which great powers establish authority over other polities usually
take one of two primary forms. [First, great powers can exercise
authority through the maintenance of a formal empire]{.underline}. In
this constellation, an imperial state or metropole acquires territorial
control over political spaces outside of its own homeland and wields
authority over them as formal colonies or dependencies. Formal empires
thus involve direct rule and formal incorporation into the metropolitan
state.Footnote37 [Second, great powers sometimes exercise authority
without acquiring formal territorial control.]{.underline} [The
political spaces they rule in this manner have variably been called
their 'informal empires' or '[spheres of
influence']{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote38 In these cases, a great power
exercises authority not through territorial control but through national
authorities which enter a relationship of subordination with the great
power while still retaining their nominal independence. [Just like
formal empires, these arrangements of imperial control are
[depend]{.mark}ent up[on]{.mark} both pillars of
[authority]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e. not only the ability to inspire a
sufficient degree of willing obedience but also to project preponderant
power into the space concerned. [Consider, for instance, the US sphere
of influence in Latin America]{.underline}: although the United States'
position of predominance does not require a permanent military presence
on the ground as its local subordinates generally comply with its
demands, [the stability of its rule depends crucially on its ability to
enforce its dictates militarily if push came to shove]{.underline}.
[When a great power exercises authority over a political space, this
effectively [limits]{.mark} the [ability of other]{.mark} great
power[s]{.mark} [to 'gain]{.mark} direct [access]{.mark} and control of'
the 'population and territory' it contains]{.underline}, [as rivals
could hope to extend their influence into the space only at tremendous
costs]{.underline}.Footnote39 Seizing authority over another great
power's territorial possessions would be possible only by conquering and
occupying them. Attempts to challenge a great power's control over its
sphere of influence are similarly costly. After all, its hold on
authority over these spaces implies not only that the great power is
able to project preponderant power there, but also that its rule enjoys
sufficient legitimacy. Any adversary seeking to assert control in its
stead must not only expect to trigger a military confrontation with a
peer competitor but also faces the prospect of an indigenous population
that is committed to retaining said peer competitor's rule. In the words
of Eric Forman, [by claiming authority over various geographic spaces
great powers thus erect 'fences or "hard shells" around specific
portions of the globe', effectively shielding them from the influence of
their rivals]{.underline}.Footnote40 [When a great power's authority
over a space collapses, however, this destroys the protective shell
around it]{.underline}. [Such [authority collapse can occur]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [two]{.mark} main [reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}. One
possibility is that [[the]{.mark} great [power]{.mark} [loses]{.mark}
large parts of the [material]{.mark} [basis]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its
[rule]{.mark}, i.e. it is no longer capable of projecting preponderant
material power]{.underline} into the respective space and is therefore
no longer in a position to fend off outside challenges to its position
of predominance. [The other is that [the]{.mark} [great power
experiences]{.mark} a pronounced [loss in legitimacy]{.mark}, i.e. it
loses its ability to elicit quasi-voluntary compliance with its commands
from subordinate political actors]{.underline}. As the former
subordinates turn away from the great power, they will not only refuse
to defend its rule but might even invite attempts by other powers to
oust and replace it in the hope of thus acquiring greater security or
other material as well as normative benefits for themselves. Overall,
whether the collapse of a great power's authority is due to the erosion
of its ability to project power into the space, its legitimacy, or both,
it radically alters third parties' strategic calculus: specifically, the
great power's peers realise that they now face the unique opportunity to
seek and claim control over a space that was previously impervious to
their rule. [Shifting our analytic focus from the removal of military
capabilities to authority collapse]{.underline} when discussing
strategic withdrawals' likely consequences might at first appear to be
nothing more than a minor semantic move. On closer inspection, however,
it [has far-reaching consequences for how to think about the connection
between retrenchment and possible rival gains]{.underline}. Most
importantly, [it reveals that the [withdrawal]{.mark} [of military
force]{.mark} from a particular space [alone]{.mark} [is neither
necessary nor sufficient to invite]{.mark} [rival]{.mark}
[expansion]{.mark}: it is possible that a great power maintains
authority over spaces outside of its homeland even without a direct
military presence within them, and it is similarly possible that it
loses authority over spaces abroad despite a continued military
presence]{.underline}. As I now turn to show, [[unduly focusing
on]{.mark} the removal of [military power]{.mark} per se [rather
than]{.mark} the collapse of [authority]{.mark} [has thus]{.mark} led
pundits and policymakers [to]{.mark} reach [distorted
assessments]{.mark} [of]{.mark} international [retrenchment's
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why many strategic withdrawals do not pave
the way for rival gains All types of retrenchment my framework outlines
entail at least a partial reduction in a great power's military presence
on the ground. Hence, pundits and policymakers have concluded,
retrenchment regularly invites rival expansion. This thinking, however,
is too simplistic. As noted above, windows of opportunities rivals might
exploit emerge when a great power's disengagement causes its authority
to collapse. In this section, I argue that [there are strong reasons to
believe that [great powers engaging in]{.mark} three out of the four
forms of strategic [withdrawal]{.mark} my conceptual framework
identifies -- cutting back, delegating, and downsizing -- [will]{.mark}
often be able to [retain]{.mark} their [authority]{.mark} over the
respective area]{.underline}. [[Consequently]{.mark}, [no opportunities
for rival expansion emerge]{.mark} that would pose a threat to the
retrenching great power's security]{.underline}. In other words, these
forms of retrenchment do not carry the costs strategic withdrawals are
frequently alleged to entail. [Let us, [first]{.mark}, consider [cutting
back]{.mark}, i.e. retrenchment which takes the form of a great power
engaging in a partial military withdrawal from an area outside of its
homeland]{.underline}. When cutting back, [[the]{.mark} retrenching
[great]{.mark} [power]{.mark} continues to [retain]{.mark} at least a
token [force]{.mark} -- and often more than that]{.underline} -- in the
area, [which helps maintain order on the ground and deters outside
challenges to its rule, at a minimum, by functioning as a
tripwire]{.underline}.Footnote41 [In addition, it [continues to
bolster]{.mark} its [influence]{.mark} through non-military means such
as the provision of economic aid or diplomatic assurances]{.underline},
[which it might even increase in order to assuage any domestic
opposition]{.underline} against the partial troop withdrawal [and signal
to other parties that it remains committed to the defence of the
area]{.underline}. In principle, great powers should thus be able to
retain their authority when engaging in this type of retrenchment. Given
the limited scope and depth of disengagement cutting back entails, the
risks associated with it are relatively small. Admittedly, it remains a
theoretical possibility that a limited troop withdrawal will set off a
cascade of events through which the great power's authority becomes
significantly weakened.Footnote42 For example, domestic as well as
international observers could perceive it as the prelude to a more
thorough disengagement, conclude that the great power's commitment to
the area is wavering, and thus feel incentivised to challenge its
position of predominance. Yet [the [likelihood]{.mark} [for]{.mark} such
[cascades]{.mark} to occur [appears slim]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[as]{.mark} [the threat of]{.mark} great power [war continues to
loom]{.mark} in the background]{.underline}, [and local actors remain
aware of the great power's continued ability to militarily fend of
challenges to its rule if necessary]{.underline}. Most of the time,
cutting back should thus be possible without worrying about creating
opportunities for rivals to expand their influence abroad. [Second,
[even]{.mark} a [complete]{.mark} troop [withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- such as occurs when delegating -- [[need not precipitate]{.mark} the
[collapse]{.mark} of a great power's authority]{.underline}. As
explained above, [when a great power decides to retrench by delegating,
it essentially attempts to switch from a political arrangement in which
boots on the ground are a key foundation of its control over the area to
one of indirect rule,]{.underline} i.e. in which it continues to
exercise predominant influence in the respective space but does so
remotely, usually by recruiting local political authorities as its
proxies. [The underlying logic of delegation]{.underline} -- and what
makes it so appealing for great powers in the first place [-- is that it
allows them to retain predominant influence while dramatically reducing
the costs of doing so by eliminating the direct military presence on the
ground]{.underline}. The goal is not to rescind one's authority, but to
exercise it through an alternative, less costly arrangement. Put
differently, pursuing delegation is centrally motivated by the goal of
withdrawing military forces without precipitating the kind of authority
collapse rivals might be able to exploit. In principle, delegation of
course carries the risk that the switch to indirect rule fails. Hoping
to exercise the same degree of imperative control as before, the great
power might find that it overestimated its ability to rule from afar.
For instance, local political actors might turn out to be unreliable
either in terms of their will to behave in accordance with the great
power's dictates or in terms of their ability to maintain military
capabilities sufficient to deter outside intervention. Yet, as the
strategic actors that they are, great powers are well aware of this
possibility and will therefore only pursue delegation when they are
near-certain that it will succeed, i.e. they are confident in their
prospective proxy's reliability. What should thus occur more frequently
than great powers pursuing delegation and later finding that it failed
is great powers planning to pursue it, concluding that it is not viable,
and therefore never implementing it. Not coincidentally, there are few
examples in modern history in which great powers pursued delegation and
failed.Footnote43 As an illustrative example, consider US plans for a
full military disengagement from Western and Central Europe after the
conclusion of World War II. It is increasingly well documented that,
from the United States' entry into the war onwards, the leadership in
Washington hoped to avoid any prolonged military entanglement on the
continent.Footnote44 During the war, Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that
'the United States will be only too glad to retire all its military
forces from Europe as soon as this is feasible', and throughout the two
following administrations US officials did not give up on the idea that
any direct military involvement on the continent should not be allowed
to become a perpetual one.Footnote45 Yet the United States never
actually implemented a full military withdrawal and -- instead of
pursuing retrenchment as delegation, as initially planned -- US troops
remained on the continent indefinitely after the conclusion of the war.
The key underlying reason for this was that the power differential
between the Soviet Union and the Western European states, despite the
profound aid they had received through the European Recovery Program and
other initiatives, remained too stark as Soviet capabilities soared.
From Washington's perspective, retrenching by delegating was simply not
feasible, and they therefore never engaged in this type of strategic
retrenchment.Footnote46 [[Finally,]{.mark} consider
[downsizing]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recall that when retrenching by
downsizing a great power initiates a partial military withdrawal and
simultaneously works to reduce its politico-economic involvement in an
area outside of its homeland. [The type of disengagement this form of
retrenchment entails is [encompassing in scope]{.mark}]{.underline} --
it targets both military and non-military foundations of influence --
[[but limited in degree]{.mark}, as the great power neither fully
withdraws its troop presence nor completely abolishes its economic and
diplomatic involvement]{.underline}. Whether this type of retrenchment
will pave the way for rival gains will vary from case to case: it
centrally depends on how large the retrenching great power's remaining
politico-military footprint is after the completion of the downsizing
process. Yet, [given that it [retains]{.mark} a [military
presence]{.mark} [and]{.mark} simultaneously [continues to
utilise]{.mark} other tools of [statecraft]{.mark}]{.underline} (albeit
to a lesser extent) to bolster its relationship with local political
actors, [in many cases the retrenching great power's authority will
likely be somewhat weakened but not erode to the point that outside
actors would feel compelled to compete for control over the
area.]{.underline} [The retrenching great power's [remaining]{.mark}
[forces]{.mark} [will]{.mark} help [deter]{.mark} outside
[aggression]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the economic and diplomatic
[support]{.mark} it continues to offer not only [signals]{.mark} its
[continued]{.mark} [interest]{.mark} in shaping the area's political
future but will help [bolster]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark}
[forces]{.mark} and secure their continued allegiance]{.underline}. In
consequence, while the reductions downsizing entails might, in some
cases, indeed end up being so pronounced that they precipitate a
collapse of authority, there are good reasons to believe that there will
exist just as many cases in which great powers downsize without opening
windows of opportunity for their rivals to exploit. The consequences of
abandonment: Strategic disaster guaranteed? [[But]{.mark} what about the
fourth and most extreme type of retrenchment, i.e. [abandoning]{.mark}?
When a great power decides to abandon a certain part of the world, it
effectively [revokes]{.mark} its [authority]{.mark} over
it.]{.underline} Its military forces are fully withdrawn, it no longer
offers economic or security benefits to incentivise subordination from
local political actors, and thus effectively abolishes the hierarchical
relationship that served as the foundation of its influence. [Given the
all-encompassing scope and depth of this type of retrenchment, it is
essentially unavoidable that it [opens]{.mark} a [window of
opportunity]{.mark} [for other powers]{.mark} to compete for authority
over the respective space]{.underline}. As opposed to those cases in
which the other three types of retrenchment are concerned, prima facie
it therefore appears more plausible to argue that when a great power
retrenches by abandoning it is bound to incur significant costs.
[[Still]{.underline}]{.mark}, [one should be careful not to overestimate
the risks associated with abandonment either]{.underline}. [While the
collapse of the retrenching great power's authority will noticeably
reduce the costs for its rivals to try and claim control]{.underline}
over the space it leaves behind -- most importantly, they must no longer
fear a direct military confrontation with a peer competitor -- [[this
does not]{.mark} [necessarily]{.mark} entail that said costs will be
sufficiently low to [render]{.mark} [expansion]{.mark}
[attractive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[When faced]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the
[threat]{.mark} of a great power seeking to claim control over them,
historically, [nation-states]{.mark} have [respond]{.mark}ed not by
appeasing or bandwagoning with the outside power but [by]{.mark}
[balancing]{.mark} against it]{.underline}.Footnote47 Because of these
local balancing dynamics, other great powers seeking to expand their
influence after the retrenching great power's departure are thus [[still
likely to confront a]{.mark} respectable [obstacle that could]{.mark}
prove formidable enough to [deter them]{.mark}]{.underline} from
realising whatever expansionist ambitions they might harbour.Footnote48
Perhaps even more importantly, one should be careful not to take the
above discussion to suggest that abandonment will necessarily represent
a strategic disaster for the retrenching great power. This piece is
primarily concerned with the costs of retrenchment and how they have
been consistently overestimated. Whether retrenchment in any given
instance leads to increases or decreases in a great power's security,
however, depends as much on the benefits it acquires by pursuing this
course of action. In other words, even if retrenchment by abandonment
does open a window of opportunity that is successfully exploited by
rivals which acquire important strategic assets, these costs --
significant as they may be -- might be outweighed by the benefits the
retrenching great power acquires. The latter can include, among others:
a lower likelihood of involving the great power's troops in active
combat; considerably less strain on the great power's economy, on whose
health its power crucially depends in the long run; the ability to
invest more resources to address domestic issues of concern; and freeing
resources to deal with more vital security threat in other regions of
the world.Footnote49 Indeed, being the strategic actors that they are,
we should not observe great powers abandoning certain areas of the globe
unless they are confident that the resultant benefits will ultimately
outweigh the costs they will incur by engaging in this form of
retrenchment.Footnote50

Stories of success: Great power retrenchment in action [Let me now turn
to [the historical record]{.mark} to gather empirical [support]{.mark}
for my argument [that]{.mark} most forms of
[retrenchment]{.mark}]{.underline} -- cutting back, delegating, and
downsizing -- [[do not]{.mark} regularly [create]{.mark}
[opportunities]{.mark} [for rivals]{.mark} to expand their influence at
significantly lower costs]{.underline}. To show that such cases of
successful retrenchment are more than just a theoretical possibility, I
provide three plausibility probes for my argument, each of which
concerns a different type of retrenchment. First, I investigate the
United States' retrenchment from Korea during the 1970s -- a case of
cutting back -- and show that the troop reductions Nixon implemented did
not undermine US authority over the southern peninsula. Second, I assess
the Soviet Union's retrenchment from Romania during the 1950s -- a case
of delegating -- and find that even though Moscow engaged in a complete
troop withdrawal, this did not undermine its authority. Finally, I take
a look at the United States' retrenchment from Western Europe in the
immediate post--Cold War years -- a case of downsizing -- and show that
it weakened but ultimately did not erode Washington's position of
authority vis-à-vis the region. Before moving on, a brief note about my
empirical approach -- that is, utilising a small number of short case
studies as plausibility probes -- is in order. After all, as Harry
Eckstein notes, 'it is true that case studies have been little used in
political studies as plausibility probes', which 'is largely due to the
fact that the idea of any sort of plausibility probe is foreign to the
field'. The logic behind this approach is that 'after hypotheses are
formulated ... \[a\] stage of inquiry preliminary to testing sometimes
intervenes and ought to do so far more often than it actually does in
political study', namely, 'probing the "plausibility" of
candidate-theories'. Note that 'plausibility here means something more
than a belief in potential validity plan and simple', yet 'also means
something less than actual validity, for which rigorous testing is
required'. Essentially, plausibility probes allow scholars to develop 'a
reasoned, not merely intuitive, "feel" for the odds \[for or\] against a
theory', help 'establish that a theoretical construct is worth
considering', and serve as 'suggestive tests ... before more rigorous
tests are conducted'.Footnote51 Given that the present work's focus lies
on proposing a new theoretical intervention to cast doubt on a widely
held conventional wisdom, it falls beyond its scope to also develop,
conduct, and analyse the kind of extensive empirical tests necessary to
reach a final decree about the contending views' validity. At the same
time, if this piece were to provide no empirical evidence at all, its
central proposition would rightly be rejected as not worthy of serious
consideration. Presenting a number of plausibility probes thus
represents an appropriate 'middle way', and the success of recent IR
studies with similar epistemic aims in utilising this approach should
increase our confidence in its effectiveness.Footnote52 [Cutting back:
The [US retrenchment from Korea]{.mark}, 1970s]{.underline} [Facing the
need to drastically cut the US defence budget]{.underline}, which due to
the Vietnam War had risen to \$81 billion in 1969, [President Nixon
decided to retrench from Korea during the 1970s]{.underline}.Footnote53
Although initially hoping that it might be possible to engage in a full
military withdrawal, the United States quickly realised that this was
not feasible at the moment, even if existing treaty commitments were to
be maintained after the military departure. A key reason for this were
continued South Korean pleas that indigenous capabilities to withstand
an attack from the North were far from sufficient. Accordingly, [at this
time retrenchment from Korea remained decidedly limited in both kind and
degree.]{.underline} In the terminology of the framework developed here,
[it represented a case of cutting back]{.underline}. Nixon's focus lay
exclusively on reducing the US military footprint on the ground, leaving
other sources of influence not only intact but in fact bolstering them,
e.g. by offering additional security assurances and promises of
extensive aid. [Although the United States decided in the spring of 1970
to withdraw roughly 20,000 troops from Korea, it provided President
Park's government with a series of reassurances in]{.underline}
[return]{.underline}. These included 'a pledge not to withdraw any more
troops', a 'written guarantee that the United States would support South
Korea if the North attacked', as well as the promise of 'an additional
\$3 billion worth of military assistance between 1970 and
1975'.Footnote54 In addition, the United States far from eliminated its
military presence on the ground in Korea. To the contrary, its remaining
troop presence continued to play an integral part in its plan to
maintain influence over the southern peninsula. [Precisely [because the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [maintained]{.mark} a significant
military [presence]{.mark} even after cutting back
and]{.underline}[,]{.mark} in addition, [[increased]{.mark} its use of
non-military tools of [statecraft]{.mark}]{.underline} to bolster its
relationship with the South Korean government and the latter's ability
to provide for its security, [[the]{.mark} United States'
[decision]{.mark} to cut back from Korea during this time [did not
undermine]{.mark} its [authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In consequence,
[other powers]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and most importantly Soviet
leaders -- [[did not]{.mark} view Washington's [retrenchment as
opening]{.mark} an [opportunity]{.mark} for them to extend their
influence into the area]{.underline}. To the contrary, for observers in
Moscow and beyond, US retrenchment at this time did not bring about a
meaningful change in political conditions. In fact, they essentially
considered it a non-issue. [It was common knowledge that South Korea
continued to fall squarely under the hegemony of the United
States]{.underline}, in both the security and economic realms.Footnote55
In short, after Nixon's decision to cut back from Korea, there was never
any serious worry -- or, from the perspective of US rivals, hope -- that
this might precipitate the erosion of its position of dominance
vis-à-vis South Korea. [No opportunities for rival gains
emerged]{.underline}, as US authority remained soundly intact.
[Delegating: The [Soviet retrenchment from Romania]{.mark},
1950s]{.underline} The previously discussed example of a great power
retrenching by delegating -- the Soviet Union's retrenchment from
Romania in the 1950s -- strikingly demonstrates that this type of
retrenchment need not create opportunities for rival gains either.
Recall that, [following World War II, the Soviet Union centrally relied
on a massive troop presence on the ground to both assert its control
over Eastern Europe]{.underline} and prevent an extension of US
influence into the region. [By the mid-1950s, however, Khrushchev began
to 'seek a more stable and permanent basis of relations with its
satellites']{.underline}. Crucially, 'this did not mean willingly losing
control over them. Instead, it meant making certain readjustments in
order to retain a maximum degree of influence and control, given the
changing circumstances since Stalin's death.'Footnote56 On all counts,
[these efforts to retrench by delegating without seriously undermining
Moscow's position of predominance vis-à-vis Romania [proved
successful]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Despite]{.mark} engaging in a [full
military withdrawal]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} [Soviet]{.mark} [Union]{.mark}
was able to [retain]{.mark} [Romania]{.mark} as part of its sphere of
influence [and avoided]{.mark} leaving [a]{.mark} [window of
opportunity]{.mark} for the West to compete for predominance in this
part of the world]{.underline}. [US leaders concluded from the get-go
that the Soviet Union's complete military withdrawal from the area did
not seriously alter the political circumstances in Eastern
Europe.]{.underline} It had done nothing to undermine the Soviet Union's
authority in the region: Romania still fell squarely within the Soviet
Union's sphere of influence. Accordingly, 'in Washington the withdrawal
decision was not thought to be an important Soviet move'. As several US
officials -- including the assistant secretary of state for European
affairs, the assistant secretary of state for policy planning, and the
special assistant for Soviet bloc political-military affairs at the time
-- recounted afterwards, 'the Soviet troop withdrawal was seen as a
minor action with no relevant impact'.Footnote57 The main reason for why
Western observers considered the Soviet Union's retrenchment from
Romania to be geopolitically insignificant is that [it did nothing to
undermine Moscow's position of authority]{.underline}. In the Romanian
government, the Soviet Union had identified a sufficiently reliable
proxy that would willingly comply with its demands. Thanks to its
geographic proximity, it further retained the ability to project power
into Romania even without a direct military presence and could thus
ensure the stability of its influence. Consequently, no window of
opportunity emerged that would have invited competition for control over
the area. Even before the Soviet Union withdrew its troops, Western
intelligence analyses explained along these lines that a 'Soviet
withdrawal alone would be less important than a settlement which allowed
the satellites to pursue at least a neutral policy'.Footnote58 Put
differently, even a complete military withdrawal would be meaningless
since it would do little to undermine the Soviet Union's ability to
control political developments on the ground. Tellingly, the majority of
Romanians themselves shared this assessment, 'perceiv\[ing\] the
development as one of only limited significance'. Diplomatic reports
from Bucharest spoke of the population's 'cynicism', 'skepticism', and
'apathy', indicating that few expected the Russian troop withdrawal to
meaningfully alter political realities on the ground.Footnote59 In
short, all observers -- whether in the Soviet Union, the United States,
or Romania itself -- concurred that the Soviet retrenchment from Romania
did not meaningfully alter the political landscape in Eastern Europe:
Soviet authority over Romania remained intact, and no opportunity
emerged for the West to expand its influence into the region.
[Downsizing: The [US retrenchment from Western]{.mark} [Europe]{.mark},
1990s]{.underline} Finally, let us turn to a case of downsizing, namely,
US efforts to reduce their commitments to Western Europe in the
immediate post--Cold War years. As previously noted, [following the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington sought to notably reduce its
politico-military footprint on the continent by engaging in significant
troop reductions and supporting the continent's move towards greater
political autonomy]{.underline}.Footnote60 As Geir Lundestad explains,
several reasons caused the George H. W. Bush administration to embark on
this course. For instance, 'the liberation of Eastern Europe had to be
buttressed financially and commercially and, with Reagan having run up
huge budget and trade deficits, Washington now left much of the
initiative for economic dealings with Eastern Europe to the EC
\[European Community\]'. Even more importantly, further integration of
reunited Germany 'was seen as essential for continued stability'.
Finally, the 'EC was also valuable in the perspective of the American
desire for burden-sharing ... If Washington was to do less in Europe and
more in other parts of the world, the European capitals had to do more
in Europe.'Footnote61 To a notable degree, the decision to grant Europe
greater politico-economic autonomy in the immediate post--Cold War years
paved the way for the emergence of Europe as a political power. As
Moravcsik summarises, by 2010 European integration had 'enjoyed an
astonishingly successful run'. Among other achievements, 'it completed
the single market; established a single currency; created a zone without
internal frontiers ("Schengen"); \[and\] launched common defense,
foreign, and internal security policies'. Consequently, the European
Union emerged 'as a major global force' to be reckoned with.Footnote62
In the words of David Lake, as a result of the increasing autonomy
Western Europe gained in both the economic and security realm,
'America's hierarchies in Europe were clearly waning' following the end
of the Cold War.Footnote63 However, although the United States' new
politico-economic role in Western Europe was thus notably limited
relative to the one it had played during the Cold War, [it would be
fundamentally mistaken to conclude that these developments caused US
authority over Western Europe to erode]{.underline}. While the United
States supported the idea of granting Western Europe an increasingly
independent economic and political role, this did not mean that it
sought to grant full foreign policy autonomy. To the contrary, 'in
Washington the assumption was still that the United States would act as
the undisputed leader, despite the relative rise of Western
Europe'.Footnote64 [Both militarily and economically, [Western Europe
continued to be dependent on]{.mark} close relationships with [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. Although the number of US
troops stationed in Europe was cut significantly at the beginning of the
unipolar era, the US military presence in Western Europe remained one of
the largest in the world, exceeding 100,000 until well after the year
2000.Footnote65 US-led NATO continued to play an integral role in
Europe's security structure, and the security guarantee built into it
continues to represent one of the main reasons why Western European
nations appear to see little need to increase their own defence efforts
even today. [For well beyond the post-1990 decade, Washington has thus
been able to exert tremendous influence on the behaviour of Western
European states]{.underline}. Rather than allowing the order which had
served to facilitate cooperation in the West during the Cold War to
collapse, US leaders worked hard to not only maintain but expand it in
the years after 1990. Although the establishment of the 'new world
order', as President Bush came to call it, was centrally inspired by
ideological concerns and motivations, it also represented an
institutional arrangement which would serve to lock in US dominance
vis-à-vis Europe and beyond.Footnote66 This was no coincidence. To the
contrary, the United States consciously moved to maintain its hegemony
over Western Europe even after the fall of the Berlin Wall.Footnote67
Given the remarkable success of these efforts, US authority remained
resolutely intact as the world entered the era of unipolarity.
[Consequently, [no window of]{.mark} [opportunity]{.mark} ever
[materialised]{.mark} that would have allowed either one of the European
states or an outside power to seriously challenge US dominance on the
continent]{.underline}. The United States consciously and successfully
maintained its position of authority and thus Europe's continued pro-US
alignment. Conclusion [It would be an understatement to say that
[retrenchment]{.mark} ha[s]{.mark} a [bad
reputation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many pundits and policymakers today
believe that great powers which withdraw from commitments abroad
ultimately end up incurring significant costs. Specifically, they argue
that retrenchment opens windows of opportunity rivals can exploit to
expand their influence and acquire important strategic assets, thus
shifting the balance of power in their favour and increasing the
retrenching great power's vulnerability. In this piece, I have argued
that, [while intuitively appealing, these arguments [paint a distorted
picture]{.mark} of retrenchment's consequences, as they consistently
[overestimate]{.mark} its [costs]{.mark}]{.underline}: [they [fail to
appreciate]{.mark} that [retrenchment can take various forms]{.mark},
many of which do not regularly open windows of opportunity for rivals to
capitalise on.]{.underline} In short, the causal relationship
purportedly linking retrenchment to significant rival gains does not
operate as commonly postulated. These findings have important
implications for policymakers today. In particular, they speak to the
current debate surrounding US grand strategy and the question of whether
it would be wise for the United States to retrench from some of its
commitments abroad. This piece suggests that [[it is]{.mark} likely
[possible for the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to]{.mark} engage in
some types of strategic [withdraw]{.mark}als [without]{.mark}
[allowing]{.mark} US [rivals]{.mark} such as China or Russia [to
acquire]{.mark} substantial geopolitical [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In this vein, the three cases of successful retrenchment discussed in
this piece provide important insights into why and how the great powers
at the time were able to avoid eroding their authority while retrenching
and thus provide a series of valuable lessons for policymakers today.
Three stand out in particular. First, [whenever the troop reductions
implemented were only partial, this served the retrenching great power
well]{.underline}: whether in the case of its withdrawal from Korea
during the 1970s or from Western Europe in the 1990s, the fact that the
United States continued to retain some of its troops on the ground
helped ensure that its position of authority would persist. Said troops
not only served to remind the local populations of the United States'
special interest in -- and ability to shape -- political developments on
the ground, but more importantly deterred outside powers from
challenging US predominance. Second, as the case of the Soviet Union's
retrenchment from Romania shows, [as long as the retrenching great power
retains the ability to project preponderant military force into the area
it leaves, even a full military withdrawal is unlikely to cause the
erosion of its authority]{.underline}. [Local political actors will
realise that]{.underline} -- even in the absence of a direct troop
presence -- [the threat of force always looms in the background. Put
drastically: misbehave, and foreign troops might return]{.underline}.
Similarly, [[third parties]{.mark} that might consider competing for
authority after the troop withdrawal has concluded [will be aware of the
retrenched]{.mark} great [power's ability to come]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the area's [defence]{.mark} if needed]{.underline}. Finally, as
illustrated neatly by the Korean case, [increases in economic and
diplomatic concessions can go a long way towards compensating for troop
reductions]{.underline}. As much as Nixon's decision to reduce the
number of stationed US troops caused anxiety among the South Koreans as
to whether they would be able to rely on the United States going
forward, his decision to combine these cutbacks with new allocations of
aid, a commitment to not withdraw any more troops, as well as a promise
to come to South Korea's aid in the case of an attack from the North,
did much to alleviate said anxiety and thus bolstered the US position
post-retrenchment. Systematically investigating the success conditions
for the various forms of retrenchment beyond the three cases discussed
here represents one of several exciting avenues for future research
opened by the present piece. In addition, scholars might seek to
investigate whether theoretical and policy discussions would benefit
from an even finer-grained conceptual distinction regarding retrenchment
than the one advanced here. Overall, my hope is that, by providing a
novel conceptual framework distinguishing between various types of
international retrenchment, this piece will enable better causal
theorising and thus a more productive debate about the costs and
benefits of great power retrenchment. Only once our discussions of
retrenchment move past simplistic causal associations based on crude
conceptual foundations can we hope to generate solutions to the grand
strategic challenges confronting policymakers in the present moment.

//NB

Given the meteoric rise of China, the emergence of other important
powers, and major redistributions in the global balance of power, power
transition theory (PTT) has become an important intellectual factor
again. [Many [observers]{.mark} [are anxious about China's
ascendance]{.mark} (and that of other powers) and [expect]{.mark}
[serious]{.mark} [conflict]{.mark} between Washington and Beijing in the
years to come.]{.underline} Many of them ground their skeptical
expectations in PTT or at least a much curtailed under- standing of it.
To give just two examples, former US official Susan Shirk claims in her
book about China that "history teaches us that rising powers are likely
to provoke war," and political scientist Christopher Layne echoes that
"throughout the history of the modern international state system,
ascending powers have always challenged the position of the dominant
(hegemonic) power in the international system---and these challenges
have usually culminated in war."1 Such skepticism, however, is
problematic for three rea- sons. First[, [it is false
theoretically]{.underline}]{.mark}[; PTT does not claim that all rising
powers will resort to war or that all power transitions will result in
war. While highlighting the inherent dangers of power transitions,
[PTT]{.mark} actually [acknowledges]{.mark} that [they]{.mark}
[might]{.mark} [result]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [peace]{.mark} as well as in
war.]{.underline} Satisfaction with the existing status quo is the key
factor here. Second, [it is [false]{.mark} [empirically]{.mark};
[not]{.mark} [all]{.mark} power [transitions]{.mark} in history have
[resulted]{.mark} [in]{.mark} great-power [wars]{.mark}. Third, it leads
to flawed policy advice; if rising powers are always aggressive and
always challenge the international order, then it makes sense to attempt
to contain or oppose them.]{.underline} If, however, rising powers are
not always dissatisfied and do not always challenge the status quo, then
policies meant to oppose them might breed dangerous dissatisfaction in
the first place. [Recognizing that [even traditional PTT allows for
"peaceful power transitions]{.mark}]{.underline}" as well as for "power
transition wars" is a useful antidote against such self-defeating policy
choices.

#### Multipolarity is inevitable, but clinging provokes [nuclear war]{.underline} 

Chris **Wright 23**, professor of history at the City University of New
York, Ph.D., 4/28/2023, \"The Second Cold War Is More Dangerous than the
First,\"
https://www.counterpunch.org/2023/04/28/the-second-cold-war-is-more-dangerous-than-the-first/

Modern history shows that [[the **most dangerous periods** are when
two]{.mark} or more [great powers are **struggling for
heg**]{.mark}]{.underline}emony. The eighteenth century in Europe was a
time of "multipolarity," as Britain, France, Prussia, Austria, and
Russia were almost continually at war, competing for geopolitical
advantage and to divide the continent between them. [The conflicts
escalated in the era of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, as a
mighty France]{.underline}, bursting with revolutionary energy,
[**strove** for **absolute dominance** against]{.underline}, in the end,
[Britain and Russia]{.underline}. The 1815 Congress of Vienna led to a
century-long balance of power presided over by an industrializing
Britain, which soon became the supreme world power. Once
industrialization swept the rest of Europe, however, particularly
Germany, Britain's power began to be challenged, not only in the
Scramble for Africa but in Europe itself. [German elites wanted their
country to be the next Britain, and to a great extent it was their
**desire for heg**emony that precipitated **both world
wars**]{.underline}. Since 1945, the United States has been virtually a
global hegemon. As John Ross notes in the recently published
Washington's New Cold War, even at the height of its relative economic
achievement in the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union's GDP was only 44 percent
of the U.S.'s. The Soviets had vast power in their limited sphere
encompassing Eastern Europe and Central Asia, but they were not a
capitalistically expansive, dynamically growing imperial power in the
mode of the United States---or, more recently, of a resurgent China.
[[China's]{.mark} GDP is 74 percent of the U.S.'s, and its [**growth
rate** is]{.mark} **higher**]{.underline} ([it has grown **[seven times
faster]{.mark}** than the **America**n economy since 2007]{.underline}).
[[Measured by **purchasing power**]{.mark} parities, the U.S. accounts
for only **16 percent** of the world economy, and [China's economy
is]{.mark} 18 percent **[larger]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In short, for
the first time since World War II, [we are entering an era of real
competition between two mammoth economies, a declining hegemon and an
aspiring hegemon.]{.underline} When people talk about "the China
threat," this is, in effect, all they mean. In the long run, China poses
a greater threat to U.S. power than the Soviet Union ever did.
Mainstream commentators and politicians prate about China's threat to
democratic values and human rights---there always has to be an
ideological rationalization for geopolitical strategy---but [U.S.
foreign and domestic policy]{.underline} since the Second World War
[tells us how much its elites care about democracy and human rights.
From]{.underline} the **[Vietnam]{.underline}** War [to]{.underline} the
catastrophic invasion of **[Iraq]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} from
[U.S. support for]{.underline} thugs like **[Batista]{.underline}**,
**[Diem]{.underline}**, Iran's Shah, Suharto, Duvalier, Trujillo,
Somoza, **[Pinochet]{.underline}**, Marcos, Rios Montt, Mobutu,
**[Saddam Hussein]{.underline}**, Mubarak, Sisi, **[Modi]{.underline}**,
**[M]{.underline}**ohammed **[b]{.underline}**in
**[S]{.underline}**alman, [and Netanyahu to **CIA coups**]{.underline}
and attempted coups [against **countless governments**]{.underline}, it
is self-evident that [policymakers care little about the moral values
they pretend to espouse.]{.underline} Americans have to ask themselves:
[[is it worth]{.mark} **risking nuclear war**---and]{.underline} an
**[[apocalyptic nuclear winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**---for no loftier
purpose than [[to maintain their]{.underline}]{.mark} country's
[**violently enforced [grasp]{.mark}** [of **overwhelming**]{.mark}
**global [power]{.mark}**?]{.underline} Threats to U.S. Power The
current flashpoint, of course, is the war in
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which [[is helping]{.mark} to
midwife [a]{.mark} "**[partnership]{.mark}**" [between China and
Russia]{.mark}, both of [which are]{.mark} also
**[deepening]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [[**ties** with
**Iran**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Decades ago, Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote
that "a coalition allying Russia with both China and Iran can develop
only if [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is shortsighted
enough to **antagonize China** and **Iran**
**simultaneously**]{.underline}." He would presumably not be very happy
with [U.S. policies]{.underline} that [are bringing about]{.underline}
exactly [this coalition]{.underline}. At the same time, U.S. [missteps
in the Middle East and]{.underline} its relative
[disengagement]{.underline} from the region since the Obama presidency
[are **allow**ing China to improve its position there, as illustrated by
the deal it]{.underline} recently [brokered between Iran and
Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [to normalize relations]{.underline}. China's
burgeoning economic interests not only in the Middle East but across
most of the world, a function of its colossal, globe-spanning Belt and
Road Initiative, require the country to play an ever-greater diplomatic
role in fraught regions. [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, for its part, [has
shown it is happy to defy Washington, even]{.underline} joining much of
the world in [disregarding]{.underline} Western [sanctions on
Russia]{.underline}. While [Washington's **failure** to convince most
countries to]{.underline} economically and diplomatically [**isolate
Russia** highlights the U.S.'s declining]{.underline}
"**[heg]{.underline}**emony," [the real **threats** to American
power]{.underline} [**run deeper** than **diplomatic
embarrassments**]{.underline}. In coming years, [the]{.underline} very
[status of the dollar as the world's dominant currency may be
threatened]{.underline}. A kind of "**[de-dollarization]{.underline}**"
[has been happening]{.underline} for some time now, as, for example,
[the share of **dollar reserves** held by central banks declined from 71
percent]{.underline} in 1999 [to **59** percent]{.underline} in 2021.
[But]{.underline} in the last few years, and especially
[since]{.underline} Russia's invasion of [Ukraine, the]{.underline}
ongoing [effort]{.underline} by many countries [to undermine the
dollar's dominance of the global financial system has
**intensified**]{.underline}. In part, [this is because of the U.S.'s
"**weaponization**" of the dollar]{.underline}: in the recent past,
Cuba, Venezuela, Iran, Afghanistan, and Russia have all suffered from
financial and trade sanctions that have included even freezing overseas
assets and removal from the SWIFT messaging system that underpins the
world's financial infrastructure. [Other countries]{.underline},
understandably [worried about suffering the same fate, share Russia's
interest in developing **new financial institutions**]{.underline} and
networks [outside of the U.S.-led system]{.underline}. Apart from this
motivation, they simply want to reduce their exposure to the effects of
U.S. economic and monetary policy, which can devastate economies. And
[as China rises, it makes sense for it to promote use of the
renminbi]{.underline}, or at least non-dollar currencies. To that end,
[the BRICS countries]{.underline}, for instance, [have been establishing
[new institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} and market mechanisms [to
[**bypass** the dollar]{.mark}]{.underline}, and are even exploring the
possibility of creating a new reserve currency based on the BRICS basket
of currencies. [Institutions like [the **N**]{.mark}ew
**[D]{.mark}**evelopment **[B]{.mark}**ank]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**hanghai
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ooperation
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization, [new payment infrastructures
that are [alternatives to **SWIFT**]{.mark}]{.underline}, central bank
digital currencies, bilateral trade conducted in currencies other than
the dollar, [[and]{.mark} a **[renminbi oil futures]{.mark}** market
to]{.underline} partially [de-dollarize the]{.underline} global [oil
trade all point toward a future currency regime]{.underline} that is at
least multilateral, if not bilateral. The economist Nouriel Roubini
argues that, "in a world that will be increasingly divided into two
geopolitical spheres of influence," [a bilateral currency regime is
likely to emerge]{.underline}, perhaps in the next decade. [Given
that]{.underline} "[[the dollar]{.mark}'s dominant position]{.underline}
in the global financial system [[\[is\] the]{.mark} very [**foundation**
of]{.mark} \[the U.S.'s\] **global [leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
as two experts note, Washington can hardly be viewing all these
developments with equanimity. Loss of the dollar's status as the world's
reserve currency would have severe consequences for the American
economy. But this outcome is exactly the end-goal of Washington's
bellicose policies toward its perceived rivals! [[Through]{.mark}
**economic [sanctions]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **aggressive [military
actions]{.mark}**[---**expanding NATO** to Russia's borders and
**encircling China** with]{.mark}]{.underline} U.S.
**[[bases]{.underline}]{.mark}**, military [**forces**, and
**militarized partner states**]{.underline} like Japan, South Korea,
Australia, the Philippines, and even Taiwan---[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is
driving]{.mark} into existence [a **hostile bloc**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} great **[[powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
medium-sized powers [that are]{.underline} necessarily [**committed** to
**its defeat**]{.underline}. [[Their policies]{.underline}]{.mark},
then, [will [become **increasingly belligerent**]{.mark}, which
will]{.underline} serve to [justify even more belligerent U.S. policies,
[in a **vicious circle**]{.mark} that amounts to an]{.underline}
extraordinarily [**dangerous** "**hybrid war**" and **arms
race**]{.underline}.

Michael **Swaine 22**, Ph.D., Senior Research Fellow at the Quincy
Institute; and Andrew Bacevich, PhD, Chairman of Quincy Institute's
board of directors, Professor Emeritus of International Relations and
History at Boston University, 11/14/2022, \"A Restraint Approach to
U.S.--China Relations: Reversing the Slide Toward Crisis and Conflict,\"
https://quincyinst.org/report/u-s-relations-with-china-a-strategy-based-on-restraint/

Core Restraint Views A Restraint approach to U.S.--China relations is
founded upon and reflects several overall views and assumptions
regarding both vital American national interests and policies and
several key features of the international system. One core Restraint set
of views is that [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} unnecessarily
[[**over-extended** in]{.mark} its **[military involvement]{.mark}**
across the globe]{.underline}, has an excessively broad definition of
its vital interests, [and too frequently relies on
**military**]{.underline} over diplomatic **[means]{.underline}** to
defend those interests while seeking to maintain, to the maximum extent
possible, economic and military dominance worldwide and to extend
democracy to as many nations as possible.2 A second Restraint view that
follows from the above is the notion that post--Cold War [[efforts to
maintain]{.mark} U.S. global **military [primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
whether **[[emphasizing deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** or active
intervention, have most often [**[produce]{.mark}**d [a]{.mark} **more
dangerous**, **[less stable world]{.mark}**]{.underline}, thereby
undermining the most vital U.S. interest of safeguarding the security
and well--being of the American people.3 The United States is physically
very secure behind two oceans and with two friendly neighbors on its
borders, and in any event has the capability, through nuclear weapons
and a territory--based conventional power projection capability, to
counter any direct or indirect military threats to its most vital
interests. The definition of [vital national interests]{.underline}
should thus be limited to the defense and preservation of conditions
directly necessary to the territorial integrity, security, and
well--being of the American people and their way of life. This primarily
requires the ability to protect the nation against both direct and
indirect, national, transnational, and subnational threats to such
interests, and a stable global order open, as much as possible, to
trade, investment, technological innovation, and people--to--people
contacts. It also requires co--existence with countries with different
political systems, congruent with a stable and open global order. Above
all, it requires a strong and cohesive domestic political, economic, and
social order. It [does **not** require]{.underline} absolute security,
the maintenance of [a prominent global military presence,]{.underline} a
reliance on [frequent overseas military forays,]{.underline}
[or]{.underline} extensive, formal, often **[one--sided, security
commitments]{.underline}** to a wide range of other nations. A third
Restraint viewpoint stresses the fact that [the international
system]{.underline} within which the United States defends or advances
its interests [is **no longer unipolar**]{.underline}.4 The conditions
that elevated the United States to the status of global hegemon after
the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 no longer exist and cannot be
restored. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
no]{.underline} practical [alternative but to accept the reality of an
increasingly multipolar world and recognize that]{.underline} both
**[continued U.S. dominance]{.underline}** and world peace [are
**illusions**]{.underline}. For the foreseeable future, [mutual
coexistence, compromise, and balance among the great powers will have to
suffice]{.underline} as an operative conception of "peace."5 This
concept thus rejects the use of distorting and dangerous, usually
zero--sum ideological frameworks in understanding global politics, such
as "democracy versus authoritarianism," or a singular stress on "great
power competition."6 The Restraint view holds that, within this system,
[two **existential**]{.underline} or near--existential international
[**threats** endanger humankind]{.underline} above all else in the
present century: [first]{.underline}, the increased possibility of
large--scale **[nuclear war]{.underline}** ([as a result of]{.underline}
proliferation, new technologies, the erosion of arms control agreements,
and [deepening great power rivalries]{.underline}); [and
second]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} largely
**[unchecked]{.underline}** worsening of the **[climate
crisis]{.underline}** as the preeminent expression of global
environmental degradation.7 A third threat is primarily domestic and
mostly affects democratic states, although it certainly also has
international implications: the rise of extremely nationalist,
anti--democratic, race--based nativism and the political polarization
and dysfunction it engenders.8 For Restraint advocates, these threats
supersede any supposed global, value--based threats, including the
commonly perceived inflated and distorted international struggle between
democracy and authoritarianism, as well as narrower, conventional
security or economic rivalries among non--nuclear powers. In assessing
the role of diplomacy (and other non--military forms of international
engagement and conflict resolution) versus military force, despite the
introduction of new technologies, Restrainers believe that military
conflict remains fraught with risk, uncertainty, higher than expected
costs, and the likelihood of unexpected consequences. This fact, along
with the gradual emergence of a multipolar order and the frequent
historical failures of U.S.--led attempts to invade, occupy, and remake
distant nation--states, provide good reasons to prioritize diplomacy and
economic or other forms of non--violent tools of statecraft over
military intervention.9 While the political use of military capabilities
is in many cases essential in the conduct of diplomacy, any actual use
of force should be considered a last resort, employed only under extreme
conditions, and in the defense of vital interests only. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, as the
dominant military and economic power on the planet, [has
[developed]{.mark} and maintained [the **dangerous notion**]{.mark} that
only [American]{.mark} global **[primacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
"leadership" [[can keep the world **peaceful**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
ensure prosperity.10 Restrainers believe [this idea has led the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to engage]{.underline}
frequently [in]{.underline} a [**feckless misuse** of military
power]{.underline}, [resulting]{.underline} in large part [from
**inflated threats**]{.underline}, overconfidence, and a deep belief in
American exceptionalism. With the possible exception of Israel, [[**no
nation** employs force as frequently]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover,
many Americans remain strongly supportive of high levels of U.S. defense
spending and Washington's many global security alliances. However, many
[citizens are]{.underline} also [growing weary of U.S. military
interventions and]{.underline} the heavy [reliance on **military**
**options**]{.underline} in handling foreign problems.11 Large numbers
of Americans now favor diplomacy over military force.12 And some
question the need for large numbers of overseas military bases around
the world.13 This suggests popular support for a Restraint--oriented
foreign policy, including reduced defense spending if and as security
competitions with other great powers are reduced. Compounding the
problems caused by military intervention in the service of primacy is
the emergence in the United States of deep levels of public uncertainty
and insecurity about the future. The many factors underlying this
feeling of uncertainty include a crisis of legitimacy involving
widespread dissatisfaction with prevailing conceptions of freedom and
democracy when viewed through the lens of race, gender, and sexuality,
as well as egregious government ineptitude, fiscal irresponsibility, and
persistent social problems.14 Politicians often exploit the worsening
domestic situation by inflating the threats posed by undemocratic states
like China to divert attention from their own responsibility for
problems at home and to unify their political base.15 Domestic
circumstances have also created a strong tendency toward an excessive
level of economic protectionism which, in the absence of countervailing
domestic policies, undermines growth and weakens incentives to cooperate
with China and other nations in handling common global economic and
financial threats.16 Restrainers assert that this dynamic, along with a
deeply--rooted commitment to sustaining high levels of defense spending
and hundreds of overseas bases, are increasing the chance of conflict
with non--democratic powers while undermining efforts to properly
define, prioritize and deal with threats at home and abroad.17 Finally,
many U.S. [friends and allies have]{.underline} both [the capacity and
the need to do **far more** to provide for their **own
defense**]{.underline}, thereby [allowing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to significantly reduce its **own global military
posture**]{.underline}. But Restraint does not encourage those countries
to rapidly ramp up their defense spending. Deepening interdependence,
the possibility of large--scale nuclear war, and the emergence of high
priority common security threats such as climate change all argue in
favor of efforts to reduce interstate security competition, which would
lower the need for ever higher defense budgets, and enhance incentives
for more cooperative forms of security.18 If successfully implemented,
[**[Restraint]{.mark}** as a basis of policy]{.underline} vis--à--vis
China [[will **buy**]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [[**time** to]{.mark} repair its]{.underline}
severely [damaged domestic order and **[reallocate]{.mark}** national
security [resources]{.mark}]{.underline} to concerns that pose a greater
threat to the security and well--being of the American people than
China. More broadly, [[it will facilitate]{.mark} the identification of
**clear red lines**]{.underline} based on the protection of genuinely
vital interests, the adoption of prudent and balanced approaches to
contentious issues, [and]{.underline} the opening of intellectual and
political space allowing for **[greater
[dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}**, understanding, [[and
**compromise**]{.mark} between Washington and Beijing]{.underline}.19
[[This will]{.mark} significantly **[reduce]{.mark} the chances of
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Urgent Need to Right--Size the
China Threat Multipolarity and the end of American dominance, rising
domestic problems, looming, high--priority transnational threats, heavy
levels of global economic and technological interdependence, and the
resulting need to create a stable long--term basis for productive and
peaceful coexistence together justify an array of Restraint--based U.S.
policies toward Beijing. This must begin with a serious effort to
right--size the threats and opportunities that China poses, both now and
over time, to the international system, American democracy, economic
growth, and U.S. national security.20 Right--sizing the threats posed by
China, along with a fact--based assessment of current and likely future
U.S. and Western resources and capabilities, will provide the foundation
for a realistic and effective Restraint--based strategy toward China. A
responsible Restraint perspective acknowledges that there are
competitive aspects to the Sino--U.S. relationship, and that a
Sino--U.S. security dilemma, along with low levels of trust, is to some
extent unavoidable, especially given the different political systems of
the two nations and China's growing power, both globally and especially
in Asia. However, the security dilemma can certainly be alleviated
significantly, and not all great power competition need be zero--sum in
nature. Furthermore, most Sino--U.S. competitions will not end in a neat
"victory" for one side over the other, unless one or both regimes
collapse, an unlikely prospect. Excessive levels and types of
competition can unnecessarily undermine attempts at cooperation over
issues such as climate change, as trust disappears and the good will
needed to fashion mutual compromises evaporates.21 [The current U.S.
[policy toward China is]{.mark} largely [based on a]{.mark}
**zero--sum**, **[adversarial mindset]{.mark}** that assumes above all
else a **fundamental Chinese commitment** to **weakening** and
**countering the West**]{.underline} and resisting any form of
meaningful bilateral cooperation. [Beijing is regularly presented as a
vaguely--defined **existential threat**]{.underline}, a rapidly growing
military and economic power [bent on **global domination**]{.underline}
through predatory trade and investment practices and/or armed coercion,
a burgeoning high--tech superpower determined to control the key drivers
of future global growth, a hostile opponent of the existing so--called
"rules--based" international order, and a pernicious threat to
democratic societies from within.22 Moreover, in many instances, the
alarm over such supposedly dire threats is magnified by the inaccurate
claim that Washington had been essentially asleep at the wheel until
very recently as China worked to undermine the United States and all
democratic societies.23 China does pose certain challenges to existing
and likely future U.S. interests. These consist primarily of: • In the
military arena, the danger of costly and destabilizing conflicts or
severe crises, resulting from military and political provocations by
either Beijing or Washington (or by U.S. allies) e.g., over Taiwan,
disputed territories in Asia, the Korean Peninsula, or as a result of
incidents involving U.S. and Chinese ships and aircraft operating in
close proximity to one another.24 Chinese military and political actions
could also weaken U.S. alliances and reduce support for the
forward--deployed U.S. military presence in Asia and elsewhere, thereby
increasing the likelihood of arms races and miscalculations by the
United States, China, and other states.25 • In the economic and
technological area,26 the possibility of Chinese behavior eroding U.S.
economic growth rates, U.S. competitiveness in some key high--tech
areas, and possibly, in some extreme cases, U.S. access to certain
technologies and critical regions, most notably Asia. Chinese actions in
this area could also reduce the incentives for other nations to trade
and invest heavily with the United States, whether as a result of
Chinese pressure or zero--sum forms of competitiveness. China could
weaken free market norms in various ways, through its loan practices and
political influence. And Beijing could damage key U.S. corporations by
ejecting them from the critical Chinese market. • In the area of norms
and values, a concern that Chinese behavior over time could weaken
existing Western norms regarding liberal democratic governance, centered
on the rule of law, freedom of political speech and behavior, various
cyber freedoms, and individual voter rights, as well as current or
future norms concerning forms of foreign international intervention
relating to human rights. China challenges many of these norms by
stressing economic and physical security and top-down state authority
over the protection of individual political freedoms and the activities
of non-state actors outside of government control. While certainly very
troublesome, and requiring effective countermeasures in many cases,
[these concerns are not grave enough to justify the kind of absolute,
largely **zero--sum** and **confrontational approach** now common in
U.S. policies toward Beijing]{.underline}. Many [**gray areas** exist in
all three of the above realms, largely reflecting Chinese support for
long--standing core principles of the international order, such as
**state sovereignty**, a preference for **diplomacy** over
**force**]{.underline} in resolving disputes, [the use of force only in
defense of **imminent**]{.underline} and clear **[security
threats]{.underline}**, [open]{.underline} air and sea [lines of
communication]{.underline} and transport across international zones,
many [market--based forms of economic intercourse]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} various other **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[N]{.underline}**ations **[norms]{.underline}** and approaches. In
fact, critics of China's global stance often conflate the values and
norms of the global order, as reflected in various international regimes
and practices, with the U.S.--centered structure of global economic and
military power.27 In reality, the preservation or constructive
adaptation of most of the values, structures, and processes of the
global order does not require a single, dominant, democratic ruling
power. The limited and contingent nature of Chinese threats requires a
strong, competitive United States, clearer, more extensive, and to the
extent possible, binding bilateral and international agreements, and
specific, credible red lines regarding violations of truly vital
interests. It also requires a common international commitment to resolve
differences over contentious issues such as Taiwan, political rights and
protectionism or state capitalism through negotiation and compromise.
[Contrary to the prevailing mindset]{.underline} in Washington, [China
does not pose an **existential**]{.underline} or near--existential
**[threat to the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates in the
above areas. [It is not in a position]{.underline} either to replace the
dominance of U.S. and Western economic and military power worldwide or
[to **overturn**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} so--called
**[liberal]{.underline}** world **[order]{.underline}**.28 As a military
power, Beijing poses no threat to the existence of the United States
except possibly via an extremely unlikely nuclear attack, which would be
suicidal. There is no evidence that China wants to threaten, much less
use, its relatively small (but growing), second--strike, counter--value
strategic nuclear force to attack the United States or its allies. To
the contrary, there is much evidence to suggest that [China's leadership
regards nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s]{.underline} predominantly [as a
**deterrent**, not as a possible first--strike, offensive war
weapon]{.underline}.29 Moreover, Beijing's recent improvements of its
strategic nuclear forces are almost certainly intended primarily to
increase the survivability of its second--strike force in the face of
significant improvements in U.S. offensive nuclear capabilities and
ballistic missile defense. [The Chinese might]{.underline} also [be
expanding their nuclear arsenal in response to an increased fear that
Washington would]{.underline} level [nuclear threats or]{.underline}
actually [employ tactical nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} a future [Taiwan]{.underline} conflict, if the U.S.
military were losing on a conventional level.30 That speaks to the
urgent need to stabilize that worsening situation (as discussed below).
On the conventional level, Chinese military capabilities are for the
foreseeable future only of serious concern in the western Pacific, where
Beijing has reached a rough parity of forces with the United States and
Japan along the first island chain near Taiwan, and is arguably now the
dominant military power in the South China Sea, as measured in numbers
of naval and air platforms.31 But even in this vast region, [China is
not poised to acquire the kind of overwhelming conventional power that
would give it the military confidence]{.underline}, even in the face of
high political and economic costs, [to attempt to **seize Taiwan by
force**]{.underline}, [eject the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [from the region, or assert total]{.underline},
direct [control over the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea or maritime Asia as a whole --- unless, that is, the
United States were to force it to undertake the acquisition of such
capabilities and take such actions by threatening to permanently
separate Taiwan from China, or by precipitating a conflict in the
region.32 [Fears that China]{.underline} has decided in the near or
medium future to invade Taiwan and, going further, [is
planning]{.underline} eventual [aggression against other Asian states
are]{.underline} therefore **[unconvincing]{.underline}**.33 [The
lessons of]{.underline} the U.S. invasion of [**Iraq** and]{.underline}
particularly Russia's failures in [**Ukraine** reinforce for the Chinese
the difficulties of]{.underline} an all--out **[invasion of
Taiwan]{.underline}**, as discussed further in the appendix.34 Beyond
this, [[China is **nowhere near** acquiring]{.mark} the [capabilities to
replace the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates as
a global military hegemon and shows few if any signs of having made a
commitment to do so.35 [This would require a force structure capable of
successfully fending off any attempt to defeat Chinese military
components within]{.underline} virtually [**any** ocean or air
space]{.underline}, and to safeguard passage to virtually any major
world port. The United States has enjoyed something approaching this
capacity for decades. [China is **far from attaining it** and currently
has **no clear imperative** to do so.]{.underline} This does not mean
China will eschew developing a military with a significant global
presence. It has already done this to some extent in the naval realm.
And Chinese leaders have said that their goal is to develop "world-class
forces" by 2049.36 But such a presence could take many forms well below
anything approaching that of the U.S. military today, including
relatively small--sized, high--quality flotillas or expeditionary groups
capable of conducting a variety of important missions well short of
achieving control overall critical international ocean areas and air
spaces.37 The above suggests that [China is unlikely to undertake an
**unprovoked**]{.underline}, out--of--the--blue **[lunge at
Taiwan]{.underline}**, [or **anywhere else** in the region]{.underline},
either today or in the near--to--medium---term (i.e., to about 2035).
[[The **most prominent threat** will emerge from
**miscalc**]{.mark}**ulations**]{.underline} [[stemming from efforts by
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates, China,
and other nations [[to **deter**]{.underline}]{.mark} one another [in an
**extreme**]{.underline}, zero--sum [manner within a]{.underline}n
increasingly [**hostile** and **polarized** security landscape. [This
could involve]{.mark} a high--risk miscalculation and]{.underline}
resulting **[[overreaction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the use of
military force]{.underline} by one or both sides [[stemming
from]{.underline}]{.mark} excessive [[**overconfidence** or
**insecurity**, in response to]{.mark} perceived
**[provocations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other words, [the
primary]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**--related
**[threat]{.underline}** is not about the threat Beijing poses to the
United States, other nations, or the global order. It is the threat that
[arises from an interactive, **worsening security
competition**]{.underline} driven by threat inflation and zero--sum
worst casing of actions and motives on both sides.38 Moreover, [the
Chinese]{.underline} almost [certainly realize that any effort to
achieve]{.underline} global (or even regional) **[military
dominance]{.underline}** over the United States [will prove]{.underline}
extremely **[costly]{.underline}**, [could]{.underline} ultimately
[**fail**, or place it in a]{.underline} virtually
[endless]{.underline}, mutually debilitating zero--sum [military
rivalry]{.underline} with Washington. [This]{.underline} sort of gamble
i[s even more unlikely given the **enormous domestic challenges** that
[China faces]{.mark}, including]{.underline} high levels of
[[**pollution**, a]{.underline}]{.mark} rapidly **[[aging
population]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a weakened leadership succession
system, [[limited]{.underline}]{.mark} domestic natural
**[[resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [low]{.underline} levels of
[productivity]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} an excessively
ideological, **[repressive]{.underline}**, and top--down
[policy]{.underline} approach to [development]{.underline} and social
order.39 [[These]{.mark} challenges [demand]{.mark} a
continuous]{.underline}, long--term [[emphasis on]{.underline}]{.mark}
ensuring [**[domestic order]{.mark}** and **growth**, not expanding
China's powers to **dominate**]{.underline} all
**[others]{.underline}**. All this implies that, despite its ambitious
goals, likely belief that the West is in decline, and increasing
suspicion and pushback toward the United States, [Beijing's policies
will]{.underline} necessarily [allow]{.underline} for some level of
[flexibility that could make]{.underline} global (and even Asian)
[competition more constructive and less destructive]{.underline}, while
keeping many doors open to some level of meaningful cooperation between
the two powers, including in the military--security arena. It is
certainly not inconceivable that growing threats to China's sea lines of
communication (SLOCs) and overseas economic and political interests
could one day cause China's leaders to fundamentally reassess the
nation's strategic interests and goals in the direction of a costly,
dominance--oriented military strategy. Nonetheless, it would be reckless
to assume that such a reassessment is inevitable and that the many
factors in favor of cooperation and balance in China's present--day
global (and regional) strategy will disappear. Indeed, [the huge costs
and risks involved in a Chinese attempt to displace the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates as the dominant global military
power [are unlikely to diminish to such a degree]{.underline} in the
decades ahead [that Beijing would conclude it is worth the
effort]{.underline} to undertake --- **[unless]{.underline}**, of
course, [Washington makes it clear that it is using its]{.underline}
global [military dominance]{.underline} to support efforts [to
**strangle China** and **threaten the stability** of its
**government**]{.underline}.40 In the economic and technological arenas,
blanket, unqualified characterizations of China's economy as "predatory"
or "mercantilist" and its loan and assistance programs as
"debt--inducing" distort the reality that some Chinese abuses exist
alongside huge levels of mutual economic benefit for many countries.41
Moreover, China poses a limited, not comprehensive and existential,
economic and technological threat to the United States, in the form of
commercial and technology theft (of which at least the latter is
apparently diminishing), unfair trading practices, and other activities
that result in unfair advantages or possibly dominance in some specific
areas.42 It is highly unlikely that such practices would result in
decisive Chinese leverage over the United States, given the likelihood
of continued American global economic and technological power and
expertise, based on the continuation of its high--quality higher
education system, its rule of law, its competitive energy and drive, its
overall receptivity to talented immigrants, and its ample domestic
resource base.43 All of these features urgently need strengthening. But
this places an even greater premium on reducing distracting and
destructive tensions with China. And in any event, America's advantages
are unlikely to diminish to such an extent that China will achieve
decisive leverage over the United States, given its own huge domestic
problems. There is also the threat that would result from excessive
decoupling of the United States and China in many economic and
technological areas. Such actions would produce high levels of
inefficiency, lower the benefits of global exchange, and create
excessive confidence in the quixotic goal of removing all
vulnerabilities to the U.S. economy.44 As a result, U.S. (and Chinese)
economic growth and resiliency would decline, along with overall global
growth and prosperity. In addition, it is virtually certain that [any
effort by Beijing to create a **Sino-centric**]{.underline}, hegemonic
regional (or global) [**order** would encounter **serious
resistance**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} many other [major
states]{.underline} aside from the United States (such as Japan, South
Korea, India, Germany, France, and the U.K.), many of
[which]{.underline} have or could muster considerable economic and
military capabilities and [would]{.underline} politically and
ideologically [**oppose** being dominated by an **autocratic
China**]{.underline}. Although these states could not counterbalance
Chinese aggression on their own, they would likely unify to greatly
augment a U.S. effort to do so, if necessary.45 Regarding global norms,
despite assertions by some to the contrary, [China is **not
committed**]{.underline} (and does not have the capability) [to
**overturn**]{.underline} what many describe as [the **global
order**]{.underline}, replacing it with an autocratic, mercantilist,
Sinocentric order.46 First, this argument relies on the false notion
that such an order is centered primarily, if not solely, on the three
principles of democracy, human rights, and a free market economic
system. In reality, [the global order consists of a wide array of
norm--based regimes and understandings]{.underline}, only some of which
are associated with Western--defined concepts.47 Moreover, numerous
studies have shown that [[Beijing **benefits from** and
**upholds**]{.mark} the goals and **[norms]{.mark}** of many of these
regimes]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} those governing relatively
[**[free trade]{.mark}** and finance]{.underline}, weapons of mass
destruction (WMD) **[prolif]{.underline}**eration, [[freedom of
**navigation**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the **[[peaceful
resolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of disputes, [and]{.underline} the
management of [transnational security threats]{.underline} China presses
for reforms in global institutions that are, in many cases, long
overdue, including the idea of providing greater representation for
China and developing states in multilateral economic organizations.48
Beijing does want to reduce the influence of Western liberal democratic
values within global regimes in favor of a more state--centered set of
views that reflect the values of economic growth, top--down political
control, limited political freedoms, and social order. However, despite
some American rhetoric to the contrary, [Beijing is not energetically
engaged in a deliberate effort to duplicate its system across the
world]{.underline}, nor poised to establish a predatory, debt--inducing
network of dominance across Eurasia via the Belt and Road Initiative.49
In fact, unlike many 19th and early 20th century imperialist powers,
with some limited exceptions during the revolutionary Mao Zedong era in
the 1970s, [China has **not espoused an ideology** or **mindset** that
views the **acquisition of other territories** or the coercive expansion
of its system]{.underline} to other countries [as essential]{.underline}
to its continued national vitality.50 Finally[, the so--called global
order is rapidly becoming a multipolar order that **no single country**
can **dominate**]{.underline} in most or all spheres.51 Hence, even if
Beijing wanted to create a Sinocentric order, it is extremely difficult,
if not impossible, to see how they could make this happen. Despite the
above developments and conflicting interests, Beijing continues to
recognize its own need to sustain substantive areas of cooperation with
Washington and to avoid slipping into a truly adversarial, destructive,
and purely mercantilist form of competition. While increasingly
assertive, the Chinese see the obvious problems of such a stance. Of
course, it is possible that Beijing eventually comes to regard the high
risks of engaging in such intense competition as worth taking, if the
danger of not doing so increases. Such a change in perception could
occur in part as a result of [[a]{.mark} continued U.S.]{.underline} or
broader Western [[drive toward]{.mark} **[confrontation]{.mark}** and
**zero--sum competition** with Beijing.]{.underline} This development
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} greatly
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** those [[voices within China who
favor **moderation**]{.mark} in the **U.S.--China
rivalry**]{.underline}. In addition [it would]{.underline} significantly
[[**raise the danger** of Sino--American **crises**]{.mark} and
**military conflict**]{.underline}, [[and divert]{.mark}
**[huge]{.mark}** amounts of U.S. [**resources** away from]{.mark}
**desperately needed**]{.underline} non--military **[uses at
[home]{.mark}]{.underline}** and abroad.52 The Key Elements of a
Restraint Approach to China From the above, it is clear that
[a]{.underline} responsible [Restraint strategy toward China
should]{.underline} seek to [[replace]{.mark} the]{.underline} current,
largely zero--sum, comprehensive competition and
[**[confrontation]{.mark} with Beijing** [with]{.mark} a
stable]{.underline}, balanced, mutually beneficial [form of **[peaceful
coexistence]{.mark}** and bounded competition]{.underline} that can
sustain global peace and prosperity while effectively addressing the
primary threats facing both countries. [This will require]{.underline} a
policy toward China geared to effective deterrence regarding red lines,
alongside mutual, credible reassurance in key areas, and the
**[[channeling]{.underline}]{.mark}** of [Sino--U.S. [competition
into]{.mark}]{.underline} as many **[[constructive
realms]{.underline}]{.mark}** as possible, [most
importantly]{.underline} including the [effort to combat]{.underline}
the overriding threats posed by **[[climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[nuclear]{.mark} [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**, WMD
**[[prolif]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
global financial and [**[economic disorder]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [An
open--ended]{.underline}, winner--take--all [**[security
competition]{.mark}** can substantially [increase the chance of]{.mark}
**crises** and [**conflict** and **eliminate options for
coop**]{.mark}]{.underline}eration [[in]{.underline} [dealing
with]{.underline}]{.mark} the truly **[[existential
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** all nations face. Ending hostile,
zero--sum political rhetoric, and replacing simplistic, confrontational
policies with prudent, balanced approaches to contentious issues holds
the possibility of creating the intellectual and political space for
compromise and the search for common ground.

As one would imagine, Packer's essay caused a stir, if not a visceral
loathing, among restrainers (the term du jour for
anti-interventionists). But as historian Samuel Moyn tweeted, Packer's
essay --- while gilding liberal internationalism for a rehabilitation of
American primacy --- reflected the reality that the old order cannot
return after the war on terror, "that [a militarism-first option of
liberal warmongers can't simply be revived]{.underline}." Moreover,
[[military options that characterized]{.mark} the [war on terror
are]{.mark}]{.underline} currently **[[off the
table]{.underline}]{.mark}**: [preemptive invasion --- and occupation
--- of sovereign nations, nation-building in the Middle East, unipolar
dominance]{.underline} by the United States, [etc]{.underline}. Due in
part to the work of journalists like Azmat Khan, [drone strikes have
decreased dramatically]{.underline} during the presidency of Joe Biden.
[Elements of restraint are also evident in]{.underline} the
[Biden]{.underline} administration['s]{.underline} [policy toward
Ukraine]{.underline}. Ostensibly motivated by fear of nuclear
escalation, [[Biden has rejected]{.mark} "New Cold [War" hawks']{.mark}
calls for a **no-fly zone**]{.underline}, sending certain high-tech
weapons to Ukraine, and the prospect of a direct US intervention in
Ukraine. In dealing with great or failed states, [Biden is operating in
the shadow of the **US inability to remake the world**,]{.underline}
even as many national security figures wish this wasn't so. [Alone or in
their aggregate, these new realities do not comprise a foreign policy of
restraint]{.underline}. Restraint must be instrumentalized for a new US
foreign policy --- it is not the end in and of itself. As the war in
Ukraine continues with no foreseeable end in sight, it provides
restrainers with the means to envision and implement a postwar vision
for the world. Restrainers must be critical of efforts to expand US
power in the short term (for instance, a blank check to the Pentagon to
fight the war), but must also look to build an affirmative vision that
relies upon international collaboration to reprioritize national
security threats (around issues such as climate change, migration and
refugee policy, poverty, and global health); deter imperial adventures
by great powers; and demilitarize the landscape of foreign policy
options once the war ends. But first, what is restraint? Restrainers are
often forced to defend their positions against liberal
internationalists. The supposed clarity of liberal internationalism ---
support for global liberty and freedom achieved through military force
and economic might, and buttressed by the inherent exceptionalism of the
United States as a democratic superpower --- is juxtaposed with the
supposed murkiness of "restraint" as a category or term. Restraint can
be defined in many ways, but as a heuristic, it is often reduced to the
idea of pulling back from the world stage --- and is pilloried as a
synonym for "isolationism," an even more loaded term. In addition to the
capaciousness of restraint, other factors hobble its proponents.
Restraint has yet to be tested as a basis for US national security.
Restraint is not codified in institutions of foreign-policy making in
the United States --- quite the contrary. Restrainers also disagree on
the ends of restraint. Some restrainers are nationalists and fiscal
hawks who believe that monies spent abroad fighting monsters, to
paraphrase John Quincy Adams, impair US business interests and free
trade, and raise debts and tax rates. These restrainers are less
concerned with matters of international justice. Other restrainers are
self-described realists focused on "offshore balancing," who seek
spheres of influence akin to the Congress of Vienna following the
Napoleonic Wars. Progressive or left-wing
[[restrainers]{.underline}]{.mark}, like myself, [[believe in a
demilitarized world determined by international cooperation]{.mark} on
issues outside of military competition (poverty, health, climate, for
example), [that can **limit conflagrations** between
**great**]{.mark}]{.underline} and small
**[[powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Some progressive restrainers have
faith in cooperation among member states of the United Nations through
proposed forums like a "Summit of the Future," which they believe can
spearhead international comity. These divides within the restraint camp
are real, but have too often been hyperbolized, deployed to create
caricatures or straw men in service of jingoism. Liberal
internationalism struggles with its own contradictions --- for example,
relying on undemocratic means (military force) to create ostensibly more
democratic ends (liberal democratic societies) --- but these fissures
have not hamstrung the salience of its policies. This is because liberal
internationalism became normative, even naturalized among foreign policy
elites during World War II and into the Cold War. As historian Stephen
Wertheim has written, US foreign-policy makers made a conscious choice
to pursue primacy during World War II --- and the Allied victory allowed
them to sell their vision to the public. Except for brief moments, such
as in the immediate postwar period and the late 1960s and early 1970s,
restrainers in US foreign policy have occupied the minority position.
The totalizing fear of Soviet dominance or Islamic terrorism conjured
unfulfilled panics about the demise of freedom and democracy. Amid an
unstable world and an era of permanent national emergency, the use of
military force to prevent illiberalism and ensure American interests
became an all too convenient, and easily available, option. But
restraint will not thrive simply as the critique or opposition to
liberal hegemony. Restraint cannot be reactive and defensive, seeking
out assorted hawks to lampoon online or in print. That is too easy.
Restraint must also not be the corollary to military withdrawal
following imperial misadventure --- its resonance cannot lie waiting for
America to make mistakes abroad, for empire's excesses to be revealed.
Such was the case with the withdrawal of United States from Vietnam in
the 1970s, or Afghanistan in 2021. As Emma Ashford has argued,
restrainers must be forward-looking. They must build an alternative
strategy to liberal internationalism that is codified around principles
of universal equity; freedom from foreign interference, coercion, and
invasion; global collaboration across wealthy and poor nations; and
international institutions that provide checks and balances on military
spending. In a time of multiple serious dangers --- imperial war in
Ukraine, autocrats flourishing in the Global North and Global South, the
catastrophe of climate change, the unattended failures of the global
response to COVID-19 --- the temptation will be to adopt familiar
paradigms that harken back to the Cold War. This appears to be what is
happening now, with the rush to subsume all global issues under the
framework of "great-power competition." [Restrainers must acknowledge
this reality while mitigating its outcomes. They can highlight the
multiple paths to achieve global cooperation, to prevent future
Ukraine-like invasions, and to avoid turning Ukraine into a
"Munich"]{.underline} --- an analogy and justification for preemptive
invasions of nefarious regimes under a new US administration. If these
suggestions seem utopian, I offer history as perspective. "One-world"
cooperative, [internationalist visions were commonplace in the early
aftermath of World War II.]{.underline} Ideas for sharing atomic secrets
with the Soviet Union under the 1946 Acheson-Lilienthal report, or for a
world federalist movement that reformed the United Nations to make the
great powers more accountable to colonized nations, were discussed but
never realized. Total war and atomic weapons broke open the realm of the
possible in conducting world affairs. [Given the transformative effects
of [the war in Ukraine]{.mark} on global issues]{.underline} (on trade,
oil, transatlantic relations), **[the conflict [could create a similar
moment in which new paths become possible]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It is
true that the political climate in the United States has stifled a
discussion about the future, of what is acceptable discourse on war. The
shock of the invasion, and the durability of Ukrainian resistance to the
Russian military, propelled public support for the war. An honest
conversation about a long-term commitment to Ukraine got lost in the
process. The hand-wringing and fallout from the Congressional
Progressive Caucus letter to President Biden, which called for a
relatively anodyne series of policies that largely echoed the
administration's line on Ukraine, further testified to the caliber of
debate about the war's future. These factors have no doubt stymied
restrainers' agenda. But **[[restrainers are a more visible, organized
bloc than at any time in recent memory]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[Restrainers have homes in academia and at various think
tanks]{.underline}, not just the Quincy Institute for Responsible
Statecraft, but also the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and
the Stimson Center. [The [fallout from]{.mark} the [war on terror is
still fresh in Americans' minds, and when polled, Americans]{.mark}
overall **[favor foreign policy retrenchment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Combined with the steps not taken by Biden to escalate the war, [this
atmosphere proves to be **favorable to restraint**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Nearly immune]{.underline}, however, [is not **immune**]{.underline}.
[Even the most **deeply held [beliefs]{.mark}** find it [difficult to
survive]{.mark} **[sustained]{.mark}**, **long‐​term [assaults]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} contradictory [info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}.
Psychologists who have studied evolution in beliefs report that despite
occasional epiphanies that instantly change minds, like that of Saul on
the road to Damascus, generally speaking the process is very gradual,
and sometimes imperceptible.53 Individuals often recognize that a change
in their beliefs has occurred after the fact, and they resist admitting
that their minds are evolving while the process is under way. [There are
examples of **[gradual]{.mark}**,]{.underline} even generational
[[evolution of beliefs]{.mark} that can give hope to those seeking to
**expunge fear** and **indispensability** from U.S. foreign
policy.]{.underline} "**[[Social Darwinism]{.underline}]{.mark}**," for
instance, **[poisoned]{.underline}** [international politics for
**decades**]{.underline}. The belief that humanity was split into a
number of distinct "races" in a perpetual existential struggle where
only the fittest survive shaped the worldview of generations of
leaders.54 Social Darwinism helped justify any number of pathological
policies, from imperialism to the Holocaust, **[but]{.underline}** over
time, [it **[collapsed]{.mark}** [under]{.mark} the weight
of]{.underline} rational **[[counterargument]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} **[evidence]{.underline}**. The identification of DNA
and the understanding of the genome allowed science to put social
Darwinism and its cousins, eugenics and phrenology, to rest once and for
all.55 Previously, [internalized beliefs]{.underline} about the
inevitability of competition between races [were]{.underline} slowly
[changed by]{.underline} the onslaught of **[evidence]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[reason]{.underline}**, and the understanding that
differences among peoples were cultural rather than genetic. The edifice
did not collapse all at once or with equal speed everywhere, but over
time arguments based on the foundation of social Darwinism stopped
winning popular debates on that "battlefield of beliefs," and foreign
policy behavior changed. Precedent, then, exists for evolution in
fundamental beliefs, enough for one to hope that a similar process could
eventually change popular perceptions toward modern, counterproductive
irrationalities. Precedent does not supply the only encouragement.
[Changing the dominant [U.S. foreign policy]{.mark} belief system is
perhaps **[not as daunting]{.mark} a challenge** as it may at first
seem]{.underline}, for a number of reasons. **[First]{.underline}**, as
already discussed, [[only]{.mark} a **[small number]{.mark} of
opinions** would [have to be altered to have]{.mark} a **[significant
effect]{.mark}**.]{.underline} As nice as it is to imagine that the
United States runs a democratic foreign policy, in reality not all
opinions are equally important. Altering the beliefs of the masses may
be quite difficult, but it is those of the elite that are decisive in
foreign policy; [affecting elites, if only because they are fewer in
number, might not prove to be an **insurmountable task**]{.underline}.
As influential as NSC 68 was, for instance, it was an internal document
read only by senior government officials, and it remained classified
until 1975. The various incarnations of the Committee on Present Danger
concentrated their efforts solely on the upper echelons of the foreign
policy community, and they were quite successful in affecting foreign
policy debate and practice. [Success in minimizing pathological foreign
policy behavior can occur **long before majorities** alter their
beliefs. **Second**]{.underline}, there is reason to believe that
[[foreign policy beliefs]{.mark} are **[not as entrenched as]{.mark}
some [others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Many modern American
[politicians]{.mark}]{.underline} --- to say nothing of the people they
lead --- [[know **very little**]{.mark} about foreign
policy]{.underline}. The U.S. Congress is a wasteland of parochialism,
where members can even be punished for appearing to know too much about
the rest of the world.56 Those at the top of the executive branch have
been little better. The past three U.S. presidents had no background in
foreign affairs before coming into office. Bill Clinton even managed to
turn his opponent's foreign policy expertise into a liability in 1992,
claiming that it demonstrated that the elder Bush did not pay adequate
attention to domestic concerns. Eight years later, voters were unfazed
about George W. Bush's disinterest in the outside world, as manifest in
a record of foreign travel stunningly low for a child of privilege,
inability to name leaders of key countries, and devotion of only three
pages in his campaign memoir to foreign affairs.57 Although Barack Obama
spent large portions of his life abroad, he had no direct foreign policy
experience before 2008, and his 2012 opponent had even less. So although
[21st-century U.S. presidents have some predetermined beliefs about
foreign policy, their [beliefs]{.mark} are probably]{.underline} more
**[[malleable]{.underline}]{.mark}** than those of presidents who have
come to office more seasoned in matters of state. Some of the most
important, [influential minds may **not prove** to be those most
resistant to change. A third reason for hope can be found in the [early
indications from]{.mark} the [changeover in
**generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Generally speaking, [young people
are more susceptible to the possibility of]{.underline}
**[change]{.underline}**, whereas senior members of any generation are
much less likely to admit that their long‐​held theories might be wrong.
That is particularly true for senior scholars, as Thomas Kuhn has
pointed out in his study of paradigms, because they rarely prove eager
to adjust the belief systems that have served them well for so long.58
Junior members of any field are much more likely to adopt new theories
and beliefs, because they are not as invested in old ways, and they may
gain a certain bit of pleasure in tearing down the old shibboleths.59
[Public‐​opinion [polling]{.mark} has suggested that the youngest
generation of adults]{.underline}, the so‐​called millennials[, is
**[less concerned about terror]{.mark}ism** and **[less supportive
of]{.mark} an [activist fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy**]{.underline}
than are its predecessors. Those between the ages of 18 and 29 are half
as likely to be concerned about Islamic fundamentalism as those over
60.60 They also appear to be less patriotic.61 It is often said that
racism is going away one funeral at a time; perhaps, too, generational
change is necessary to relieve some of the pathological popular
pressures in the arena of U.S. foreign policy debate. Finally, it is
worth emphasizing that the target of this work is the marketplace of
ideas, not the beliefs of every individual who contributes to it. The
United States does not always act pathologically, after all. [[Rational
forces]{.mark} are present alongside pathological ones in all foreign
policy discussions, and they **often [win]{.mark}** the [battle]{.mark}
over the direction of policy. It will not require a complete ideological
revolution for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
**[minimize]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[[irrational
beliefs]{.underline}]{.mark}** that plague its foreign policy behavior.
[[Planting]{.mark} the **[seeds of doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
influential minds, seeds that can germinate and grow over time, [may
well prove to be enough to tilt the balance of national debate toward
reason]{.underline}. The task of inspiring gradual improvement in U.S.
foreign policy performance, therefore, may not be as daunting as it at
first seems. In the long run, there is hope, even if few minds will
change any time soon. Thomas Jefferson once wrote, "If we think \[the
people are\] not enlightened enough to exercise control with a wholesome
discretion, the remedy is not to take it from them, but to inform that
discretion."62 [One of the crucial tasks facing policymakers must be to
**inform the general public**]{.underline}, however slowly and
indirectly, of the evidence that might force its members to reexamine
their foreign policy beliefs. Because an informed public is one of the
central sine qua nons of a healthy, functioning democracy, U.S. leaders
ought to repeat the facts about the decline of warfare --- and of the
real risks associated with terrorism --- as many times as necessary for
them to become accepted.63 Although simply correcting misinformation
will not alter beliefs immediately, [over time the constituency for
reason will **grow**]{.underline}.64 Though beliefs are exceptionally
slow to change, they eventually do. [Few people still believe that the
earth is at the **center of the universe**]{.underline}, for instance,
[or that insults to honor must be answered by a **duel to the
death**]{.underline}. [Assuming for a moment that the **[current pacific
trends]{.mark}** in international politics [**turn out to have staying
power**,]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[empirical
realities]{.underline}**]{.mark} [will]{.underline} eventually
**[[trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** pathological [**geopolitical
[fear]{.mark}**. Even the most deeply held collective beliefs find it
hard to persist forever in the face of a sustained **[onslaught of
countervailing evidence]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Over time --- and
perhaps with the change of generations --- pure reason can win the
battle of beliefs, even if its victory is never certain.

Crisis Facilitates Change The case studies show that [[**crisis** is
a]{.mark} great **[driver]{.mark} and facilitator** [of
**change**]{.mark}]{.underline} and that foreign policy
[[leaders]{.mark} should]{.underline} have an idea of how they might
[use a **crisis** to **open** or foreclose **opportunities** to
[shift]{.mark} [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. The case of 9/11 makes
the importance of crises unmistakably clear, but international crises
spurred change in the NSC-68 and Vietnam War cases as well. There is
truth in the adage "Never let a good crisis go to waste." [Crises
[generate]{.mark} **policy [plasticity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, opening
the door to strategic change. [[Absent]{.mark} a
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}, a president seeking [[significant
**changes** in **fo**]{.mark}reign **[po]{.mark}**licy [faces a much
**harder task**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider [the impact
of]{.underline} the outbreak of [[the **Korean War**]{.mark} on U.S.
Cold War strategy]{.underline}. The hawkish global approach that Nitze
developed in NSC-68 initially faced opposition inside and outside the
government. The plan was basically shelved in the spring of 1950, and it
gained new life only when the Korean War erupted in June. North Korea's
invasion of South Korea seemed to support NSC-68's central claim that
the United States could not afford to focus solely on competition with
the Soviet Union in Europe. The outbreak of [the war]{.underline} also
[created a sense of urgency]{.underline} that NSC-68's advocates used to
turn their strategy into a reality. [As a **result**, the **U**nited
**S**tates adopted a more **geographically expansive** and
**military-centered conception** of how to wage the **Cold
War**]{.underline}. [The **9/11 attacks** provide an even more clear-cut
case]{.underline} of how a foreign policy crisis fosters major change.
The terrorist attacks created so strong a national desire to punish
al-Qaeda and to prevent another assault on American soil as to give the
Bush administration as close to a free hand in foreign policy as any
presidency since the Second World War. [The White House **used** the
crisis]{.underline} not just to put a higher priority on
counterterrorism but also [to **increase** defense **spending** and
**implement** a **neoconservative** grand **strategy**]{.underline}
aimed at building democracy in the Middle East through military force.
Conversely, [[Carter's]{.mark} **failed [attempt]{.mark}** [to
**withdraw**]{.mark} U.S. forces from **So**uth **Ko**rea
[illustrates]{.mark} the [**difficulty**]{.mark} of achieving
significant **change without a crisis**]{.underline} to motivate and
galvanize support for it. Carter came into office on the heels of
economic and foreign policy crises: the 1973 inflation spike and the
Vietnam War. The latter was one reason he wanted to reduce the U.S.
military posture in Asia by withdrawing forces from South Korea. By the
time he took office, however, these problems had lost intensity.
[**[Support]{.mark}** for **withdrawal** from **So**uth **Ko**rea
[**dissipated**]{.mark} over time]{.underline}, and Carter was
eventually forced to shelve the idea. Crisis is not always necessary for
major change. The Biden administration withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021
in the absence of a foreign policy crisis. It decided to withdraw U.S.
forces in the first year of the administration, during a honeymoon
period when the president still enjoyed strong support from his own
party and control of Congress. The policy had also been pursued by
Trump, making it more difficult for Republicans in Congress to criticize
the withdrawal harshly. By 2021, moreover, evidence that the United
States was not achieving its stated objectives in Afghanistan had piled
up over the years, weakening resistance to change and making withdrawal
popular among a large majority of the American public. Why do
**[[crises]{.underline}]{.mark}** facilitate change? One reason is that
they tend to [[**generate**]{.mark} an **emotional [impetus]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}for action]{.underline}[, [making
**people**]{.underline}]{.mark} [more likely to [**rethink**]{.mark}
their **fundamental [assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline} and goals. In a
time of crisis, [[the public]{.mark}, Congress, [and]{.mark} the
[government]{.mark} bureaucracy [yearn for]{.mark} a
[response]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pressure for action is not always a good
thing, because sometimes the best policy is to avoid taking action in
the first place---in other words, to do nothing---but if the White House
is aiming for a major change, [a crisis [generates]{.mark} a
**[permissive atmosphere]{.mark}** for change to **gain
traction**]{.underline}. **[Crises]{.underline}** can also
[**[overwhelm]{.mark} existing [beliefs]{.mark}** []{.mark}with
disconfirming **info**rmation]{.underline}. In normal times, people tend
to interpret facts according to existing mental frameworks rather than
to revise the frameworks themselves. But [a crisis can cause people to
**rethink assumptions** if an existing framework has proven to be
inadequate for understanding the world]{.underline} and generated
harmful consequences.^1^ In addition, [crises [generate]{.mark} a
**sense of [urgency]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [which can
generate]{.underline} the **[momentum]{.underline}** needed [[to
overcome inertia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Experts on change in businesses,
for example, have pointed out that a sense of urgency can be essential
to large-scale change because it helps generate collective action.^2^

China Can Side-step the Thucydides' Trap, The Chinese Journal of
International Politics, Volume 18, Issue 2, 2025, Pages 151--172,
https://doi.org/10.1093/cjip/poaf001

A balance of power reading of Thucydides suggests that [US\' efforts to
maintain its post-Cold War hegemonic position, either unilaterally or
through broader consent, are bound to fail]{.underline}. [The post-Cold
War "unipolar moment" was not a permanent fact but rather a temporary
artifact of the sudden and unexpected collapse of one pole in a bipolar
system]{.underline}.187 By virtue of its large population and high level
of economic growth, China was destined to replace the Soviet Union as
another pole in the 21st century international system. The interesting
question is not whether unipolarity will last but will it be replaced
with a bipolar or multipolar system?188 [One of the most important
causes of hegemonic wars in the wake of power transitions is the
security dilemma, the unintended dynamic in which the efforts one state
takes to ensure its security often undermine that of
others]{.underline}.189 While in an anarchical international system, the
security dilemma can never be completely eliminated, it can be mitigated
by the policies states adopt. Thucydides attributes the Peloponnesian
War to the breakdown of the balance of power between Athens and Sparta
and he applauds Pericles' efforts to try to re-establish it through
restraint rather than replacing Spartan hegemony. [Not only is [a
balance of power]{.mark} grand [strategy]{.mark} [less likely to
exacerbate]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} [dilemma]{.mark}, it is
eminently more feasible and will better serve American
interests.]{.underline}190 [A balance of power approach by the USA in
its rivalry with China will be effective because it builds upon a number
of well-established tendencies in international
politics]{.underline}.191 Most importantly, [[states]{.mark} tend to
[balance against threats]{.mark}, rather than band wagoning with
them]{.underline}.192 [As China grows more powerful and assertive,
states closest to it are feeling a greater sense of peril]{.underline}.
[Their response will be to seek ways to respond to that threat by
counterbalancing it. [A less]{.mark} [forward]{.mark} and assertive US
[posture will]{.mark} not only mitigate the security dilemma with China
but also [dampen]{.mark} common pathologies of balancing such as
[buck-passing]{.mark} by allies to the larger power and otherwise
under-providing for their own security]{.underline}. [The common problem
behind both is what economists call "moral hazard," or the propensity of
actors to behave recklessly if another is insuring them against its
consequences]{.underline}.193 Some fret that recent Chinese investments
in anti-access/area denial ([[A2/AD]{.underline}]{.mark}) technologies
make it harder for the USA to continue to project power close to China.
However, these same [technologies [could]{.mark} also [bolster]{.mark}
America's beleaguered [allies]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}.194
Taiwan, the most probable casus belli, is further from mainland China
than Great Britain was from Nazi-held Europe and about the same distance
that Cuba was from Cold War Florida. Despite these relatively short
distances, neither was ever successfully invaded. [Today, [China will
have to project power across water]{.mark}, always [a]{.mark} [dicey
proposition]{.mark} but one made even harder now if US allies in the
region invest in their own A2/AD technologies to preserve the balance of
power.]{.underline} [Donald [Trump's]{.mark} return to the White House
raises the question of whether he [might be]{.mark} more
[amenable]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [replacing]{.mark} America's long-standing
[Primacy]{.mark}]{.underline} approach to maintaining the status quo in
the Western Pacific with one premised upon a balance of power?195 [There
are]{.underline}, in fact, [grounds for thinking that Trump might
be]{.underline}. The latter approach would not seek to prevent any
change in the region, only those that threaten the global balance of
power. [During his first term in office, he [adopted]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
more "[transactional approach]{.mark} \[which\] often differed from his
team's competitive approach."]{.underline}196 [To be sure, the recently
re-elected former President has not shied away from economic
competition]{.underline} with China and has shown little compunction
about rattling the tariff saber and even threatening a trade war. [But
he seems "[ambivalent]{.mark}" [about]{.mark} embracing the American
China [hawks']{.mark} commitment to defend Taiwan against China if it
seeks independence]{.underline}.197 Hardly anyone would compare the
former and future President to the great Athenian leader Pericles, but
[it is entirely possible that Trump might at least embrace a Periclean
balance of power approach as a way out of the Thucydides'
Trap]{.underline}. Thucydides' fundamental lessons for the contemporary
USA in its rivalry with China is that democratic Athens erred when it
grasped for primacy by expanding its empire during the Peloponnesian
War; [today [America]{.mark} does not need to preserve a position of
primacy in East Asia but [can]{.mark} instead [rest content]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} maintaining a [balance of power]{.mark}
there]{.underline}. Indeed, [the tragedy of Thucydides' account is that
neither Athens nor Sparta appreciated the limits imposed upon their
striving for primacy by the balance of power]{.underline}.198 [The best
grand strategy for the contemporary USA]{.underline} I believe, and the
Thucydidean approach I know, [favors the more restrained balance of
power approach for the USA to manage its rivalry with China in this
century]{.underline} without blundering into the "Thucydides' trap."

Like many believers, [proponents of hegemonic stability theory base
their view on **faith alone**]{.underline}.41 [There is **precious
little evidence** to suggest that the United States is responsible
for]{.underline} the [pacific trends]{.underline} that have swept across
the system. In fact, [[the world remained]{.mark} **equally
[peaceful]{.mark}**]{.underline}, relatively speaking, [[while the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[cut]{.mark}
its [forces]{.mark} throughout the 1990s, [as well as]{.mark} while it
**[doubled]{.mark}** its military spending in the first decade of the
new century]{.underline}.42 **[Complex statistical
methods]{.underline}** should not be needed to [demonstrate that levels
of U.S. military [spending have been]{.mark} essentially [**unrelated**
to]{.mark} global [stability]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hegemonic stability
theory's flaws go way beyond the absence of simple correlations to
support them, however. [The theory's supporters have **never been able
to explain adequately** how precisely **5 percent** of the world's
population could **force** peace on the other **95
percent**]{.underline}, unless, of course, the rest of the world was
simply not intent on fighting. [Most states are quite free to go to war
without U.S. involvement but **choose not to**]{.underline}. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can be counted on, especially
after Iraq, to **steer well clear** of most civil wars and ethnic
conflicts]{.underline}. It took years, hundreds of thousands of
casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal [violence
in]{.underline}, say, [most of [Africa]{.mark} would be unlikely to
attract serious attention of the world's policeman, much less
**intervention**]{.underline}. [The continent [is]{.mark},
**nevertheless**, **more [peaceful]{.mark} today** than at **any other
time** in its history]{.underline}, [something for which U.S.
[heg]{.mark}emony **[cannot take credit]{.mark}**]{.underline}.43
[[Stability exists]{.mark} today [in]{.mark} **many such
[places]{.mark}** [to which]{.mark} U.S. [heg]{.mark}emony **simply
[does not extend]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Overall, [proponents of the
**stabilizing power** of U.S. hegemony should keep in mind one of the
most **basic observations** from **cognitive psychology**]{.underline}:
[**rarely** are our actions as important to others' calculations as we
**perceive them to be**]{.underline}.44 [The]{.underline} so‐​called
**[egocentric bias]{.underline}**, which is essentially ubiquitous in
human interaction, [suggests that although it may be **natural** for
[U.S. policymakers]{.mark} to interpret their role as crucial in the
maintenance of world peace, they are **almost certainly
[overestimat]{.mark}ing [their own importance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Washington is probably not as central to the **myriad decisions** in
foreign capitals that help maintain international stability as it thinks
it is. The **indispensability fallacy** owes its existence to a couple
of factors]{.underline}. First, [although all people like to **bask** in
the **reflected glory** of their country's]{.underline} (or culture's)
**[unique, nonpareil stature]{.underline}**, [Americans have long been
**exceptional** in their **exceptionalism**]{.underline}.45 [The short
history of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which can
easily be read as an almost uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story
of success, [has led to a]{.underline} (perhaps natural) [belief that it
is **morally, culturally**, and **politically superior** to other,
lesser countries]{.underline}. It is no coincidence that the exceptional
state would be called on by fate to maintain peace and justice in the
world. [Americans have always combined that feeling of **divine
providence** with a sense of mission to spread their ideals around the
world and **battle evil**]{.underline} wherever it lurks. It is that
sense of destiny, of being the object of history's call, that most
obviously separates the United States from other countries. Only an
American president would claim that by entering World War I, "America
had the infinite privilege of fulfilling her destiny and saving the
world."46 Although many states are motivated by humanitarian causes, no
other seems to consider promoting its values to be a national duty in
quite the same way that Americans do. "I believe that God wants
everybody to be free," said George W. Bush in 2004. "That's what I
believe. And that's one part of my foreign policy."47 When Madeleine
Albright called the United States the "indispensable nation," she was
reflecting a traditional, deeply held belief of the American people.48
Exceptional nations, like exceptional people, have an obligation to
assist the merely average. Many of the factors that contribute to
geopolitical fear --- Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested
interests, and neoconservatism --- also help explain American
exceptionalism and the indispensability fallacy. And unipolarity makes
hegemonic delusions possible. With the great power of the United States
comes a sense of great responsibility: to serve and protect humanity, to
drive history in positive directions. More than any other single factor,
the people of the United States tend to believe that they are
indispensable because they are powerful, and power tends to blind states
to their limitations. "Wealth shapes our international behavior and our
image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It brings with it the freedom to make
wide‐​ranging choices well beyond common sense."49 [It is quite likely
that the world **does not need the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[to enforce peace]{.underline}**. In fact,
[if **virtually any** of the overlapping and mutually reinforcing
[explanations for]{.mark} the current [stability]{.mark} are correct,
the trends in international security may well [prove **difficult to
reverse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[No]{.mark}ne** of the **contributing
[factors]{.mark}** that are commonly [suggested]{.mark}]{.underline}
[(**[economic development]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, complex
[**interdependence**, **nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}**,
international [**institutions**, **democracy**]{.mark}, **shifting
global [norms]{.mark}** on war]{.underline}) [seem **poised to
[disappear]{.mark}** any time soon]{.underline}.50 [[The world
will]{.mark} probably **[continue]{.mark}**]{.underline} its
[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}ful ways for the near future, at the very
least, [**no matter what** the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[chooses to do or not do]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis concluded while
pondering the likely effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made in
foreign capitals, "It is very unlikely that pulling off the American
security blanket would lead to thoughts of war."51 The United States
will remain fundamentally safe no matter what it does --- in other
words, despite widespread beliefs in its inherent indispensability to
the contrary.

#### No offense \-\-- heg isn't key to global stability. 

**Fettweis, 2017** (Christopher J. Fettweis 17. Associate professor of
political science, Tulane. "Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace."
Security Studies, 26:3, 423-451, ADA-65)

These assessments of conflict are by necessity relative, because there
has not been a "high" level of conflict in any region outside the Middle
East during the period of the New Peace. Putting aside for the moment
that important caveat, some points become clear. The great powers of the
world are clustered in the upper right quadrant, where US intervention
has been high, but conflict levels low. US intervention is imperfectly
correlated with stability, however. Indeed, it is conceivable that the
relatively high level of [US interest and activity has made the security
situation in the Persian Gulf and broader Middle East
**worse**]{.underline}. In recent years, [substantial hard power
investments (Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq), moderate intervention (Libya),
and reliance on diplomacy (Syria) have been equally **ineffective** in
stabilizing states torn by conflict]{.underline}. While it is possible
that the region is essentially unpacifiable and no amount of police work
would bring peace to its people, [it remains hard to make the case that
the US presence has improved matters]{.underline}. In this "strong
point," at least, [US hegemony has **failed to bring
peace**]{.underline}. In much of the rest of the world, the United
States has not been especially eager to enforce any particular rules.
[Even]{.underline} rather [incontrovertible evidence of genocide has not
been enough to inspire action]{.underline}. Washington's intervention
choices have at best been erratic; Libya and Kosovo brought about
action, but [much more blood flowed uninterrupted in Rwanda, Darfur,
Congo, Sri Lanka, and Syria]{.underline}. The US record of peacemaking
is not exactly a long uninterrupted string of successes.
[During]{.underline} the turn-of-the-century conventional [war between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, a highlevel US delegation]{.underline} containing
former and future National Security Advisors (Anthony Lake and Susan
Rice) [made a half-dozen trips to the region, but was unable to prevent
either the outbreak or recurrence of the conflict]{.underline}. Lake and
his team shuttled back and forth between the capitals with some
frequency, and President Clinton made repeated phone calls to the
leaders of the respective countries, offering to hold peace talks in the
United States, all to no avail.67 The war ended in late 2000 when
Ethiopia essentially won, and it controls the disputed territory to this
day. The Horn of Africa is hardly the only region where states are free
to fight one another today without fear of serious US involvement. Since
they are choosing not to do so with increasing frequency, something else
is probably affecting their calculations. Stability exists even in those
places where the potential for intervention by the sheriff is minimal.
Hegemonic stability can only take credit for influencing those decisions
that would have ended in war without the presence, whether physical or
psychological, of the United States. It seems hard to make the case that
the relative peace that has descended on so many regions is primarily
due to the kind of heavy hand of the neoconservative leviathan, or its
lighter, more liberal cousin. Something else appears to be at work.
Conflict and US Military Spending How does one measure polarity? Power
is traditionally considered to be some combination of military and
economic strength, but despite scores of efforts, no widely accepted
formula exists. Perhaps overall military spending might be thought of as
a proxy for hard power capabilities; perhaps too the amount of money the
United States devotes to hard power is a reflection of the strength of
the unipole. When compared to conflict levels, however, there is no
obvious correlation, and certainly not the kind of negative relationship
between US spending and conflict that many hegemonic stability theorists
would expect to see. [During the]{.underline} 19[90s]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [cut back on
defense by about 25 percent]{.underline}, spending \$100 billion less in
real terms in 1998 that it did in 1990.68 [To those believers in the
neoconservative version of hegemonic stability, this irresponsible
"peace dividend" endangered both national and global
security]{.underline}. "No serious analyst of American military
capabilities doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to
meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace," argued
Kristol and Kagan at the time.69 The world grew dramatically more
peaceful while the United States cut its forces, however, and stayed
just as peaceful while spending rebounded after the 9/11 terrorist
attacks. [The incidence and magnitude of global conflict **declined
while the military budget was cut**]{.underline} under President
Clinton, in other words, and kept declining (though more slowly, since
levels were already low) as the Bush administration ramped it back up.
[Overall US military spending has varied during the period of the New
Peace from a low in constant dollars of less than \$400 billion to a
high of more than \$700 billion, but war does not seem to have
noticed]{.underline}. [The same nonrelationship exists between other
potential proxy measurements for hegemony and conflict: there does not
seem to be much connection between warfare and fluctuations in US GDP,
**alliance commitments**, and forward **military
presence**]{.underline}. [There was very little fighting in Europe when
there were 300,000 US troops stationed there]{.underline}, for example,
[and that **has not changed** as the number of Americans **dwindled by
90 percent**]{.underline}. Overall, [there **does not** seem to be much
correlation between US actions and systemic stability]{.underline}.
[Nothing the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[actually does seems to matter to the New Peace]{.underline}. It is
possible that absolute military spending might not be as important to
explain the phenomenon as relative. Although Washington cut back on
spending during the 1990s, its relative advantage never wavered. The
United States has accounted for between 35 and 41 percent of global
military spending every year since the collapse of the Soviet Union.70
The perception of relative US power might be the decisive factor in
decisions made in other capitals. One cannot rule out the possibility
that it is the perception of US power---and its willingness to use
it---that keeps the peace. In other words, perhaps it is the grand
strategy of the United States, rather than its absolute capability, that
is decisive in maintaining stability. It is that to which we now turn.
Conflict and US Grand Strategy The perception of US power, and the
strength of its hegemony, is to some degree a function of grand
strategy. If indeed US strategic choices are responsible for the New
Peace, then variation in those choices ought to have consequences for
the level of international conflict. A restrained United States is much
less likely to play the role of sheriff than one following a more
activist approach. Were the unipole to follow such a path,
hegemonic-stability theorists warn, disaster would follow. Former
National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski spoke for many when he
warned that "outright chaos" could be expected to follow a loss of
hegemony, including a string of quite specific issues, including new or
renewed attempts to build regional empires (by China, Turkey, Russia,
and Brazil) and the collapse of the US relationship with Mexico, as
emboldened nationalists south of the border reassert 150-year-old
territorial claims. Overall, without US dominance, today's relatively
peaceful world would turn "violent and bloodthirsty." 71 Niall Ferguson
foresees a post-hegemonic "Dark Age" in which "plunderers and pirates"
target the big coastal cities like New York and Rotterdam, terrorists
attack cruise liners and aircraft carriers alike, and the "wretchedly
poor citizens" of Latin America are unable to resist the Protestantism
brought to them by US evangelicals. Following the multiple (regional,
fortunately) nuclear wars and plagues, the few remaining airlines would
be forced to suspend service to all but the very richest cities.72 These
are somewhat extreme versions of a central assumption of all
hegemonic-stability theorists: a restrained United States would be
accompanied by utter disaster. The "present danger" of which Kristol,
Kagan, and their fellow travelers warn is that the United States "will
shrink its responsibilities and---in a fit of absentmindedness, or
parsimony, or indifference--- allow the international order that it
created and sustains to collapse." 73 Liberals fear restraint as well,
and also warn that a militarized version of primacy would be
counterproductive in the long run. Although they believe that the
rule-based order established by United States is more durable than the
relatively fragile order discussed by the neoconservatives, liberals
argue that Washington can undermine its creation over time through
thoughtless unilateral actions that violate those rules. Many predicted
that the invasion of Iraq and its general contempt for international
institutions and law would call the [legitimacy]{.underline} of the
order into question. G. John Ikenberry worried that Bush's "geostrategic
wrecking ball" would lead to a more hostile, divided, and dangerous
world.74 Thus while all hegemonicstability theorists expect a rise of
chaos during a restrained presidency, liberals also have grave concerns
regarding primacy. Overall, if either version is correct and global
stability is provided by US hegemony, then maintaining that stability
through a grand strategy based on either primacy (to neoconservatives)
or "deep engagement" (to liberals) is clearly a wise choice.75 If,
however, US actions are only tangentially related to the outbreak of the
New Peace, or if any of the other proposed explanations are decisive,
then [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can
retrench without fear of negative consequences]{.underline}. The grand
strategy of the United States is therefore crucial to beliefs in
hegemonic stability. Although few observers would agree on the details,
most would probably acknowledge that post-Cold War grand strategies of
American presidents have differed in some important ways. The four
administrations are reasonable representations of the four ideal types
outlined by Barry R. Posen and Andrew L. Ross in 1996.76 Under George H.
W. Bush, the United States followed the path of "selective engagement,"
which is sometimes referred to as "balance-of-power realism"; Bill
Clinton's grand strategy looks a great deal like what Posen and Ross
call "cooperative security," and others call "liberal internationalism";
George W. Bush, especially in his first term, forged a strategy that was
as close to "primacy" as any president is likely to get; and Barack
Obama, despite some early flirtation with liberalism, has followed a
restrained realist path, which Posen and Ross label "neo-isolationism"
but its proponents refer to as "strategic restraint." 77 In no case did
the various anticipated disorders materialize. As Table 2 demonstrates,
armed conflict levels fell steadily, irrespective of the grand strategic
path Washington chose. [Neither the primacy of]{.underline} George W.
[Bush nor]{.underline} the [restraint of]{.underline} Barack [Obama had
much effect on the level of global violence]{.underline}. Despite
continued warnings (and the high-profile mess in Syria), [the world has
not experienced an increase in violence while the]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [chose
uninvolvement]{.underline}. [If the grand strategy of the United States
is responsible for the New Peace, it is leaving no trace in the
evidence]{.underline}. Perhaps we should not expect a correlation to
show up in this kind of analysis. While US behavior might have varied in
the margins during this period, nether its relative advantage over its
nearest rivals nor its commitments waivered in any important way.
However, it is surely worth noting that if trends opposite to those
discussed in the previous two sections had unfolded, if other states had
reacted differently to fluctuations in either US military spending or
grand strategy, then surely hegemonic stability theorists would argue
that their expectations had been fulfilled. Many liberals were on the
lookout for chaos while George W. Bush was in the White House, just as
neoconservatives have been quick to identify apparent worldwide
catastrophe under President Obama.78 If increases in violence would have
been evidence for the wisdom of hegemonic strategies, then logical
consistency demands that the lack thereof should at least pose a problem
As it stands, the only evidence we have regarding the relationship
between US power and international stability suggests that the two are
unrelated. The rest of the world appears quite capable and willing to
operate effectively without the presence of a global policeman. Those
who think otherwise have precious little empirical support upon which to
build their case. Hegemonic stability is a belief, in other words,
rather than an established fact, and as such deserves a different kind
of examination. The Political Psychology of Unipolarity
[Ev]{.underline}idence [supporting the notion that US power
is]{.underline} primarily [responsible for the New Peace is **slim**,
but]{.underline} belief in the connection [is quite strong]{.underline},
especially in policy circles. The best arena to examine the proposition
is therefore not the world of measurable rationality, but rather that of
the human mind. Political psychology can shed more light on unipolarity
than can any collection of data or evidence. Just because an outcome is
primarily psychological does not mean that it is less real; perception
quickly becomes reality for both the unipolar state and those in the
periphery. If all actors believe that the United States provides
security and stability for the system, then behavior can be affected.
Beliefs have deep explanatory power in international politics whether
they have a firm foundation in empirical reality or not. Like all
beliefs, [faith in the stability provided by hegemony is rarely
subjected to much analysis]{.underline}. In their simplest form, beliefs
are ideas that have become internalized and accepted as true, often
without much further analysis Although they almost always have some
basis in reality, [beliefs need not pass rigorous tests to prove that
they match it]{.underline}. [No amount of ev]{.underline}idence [has
been able to convince some people that vaccines do not cause autism, for
example, or that the world is more peaceful than at any time before, or
that the climate is changing due to human activity]{.underline}.
Ultimately, [as]{.underline} Robert [Jervis explains, "we often believe
as much in the face of evidence as because of it."]{.underline} When
leaders are motivated to act based on unjustified, inaccurate beliefs,
folly often follows. The person who decides to take a big risk because
of astrological advice in the morning\'s horoscope can benefit from
baseless superstition if the risk pays off. Probability and luck suggest
that successful policy choices can sometimes flow from incorrect
beliefs. Far more often, however, poor intellectual foundations lead to
suboptimal or even disastrous outcomes. It is worthwhile to analyze the
foundations of even our most deeply held beliefs to determine which ones
are good candidates to inspire poor policy choices in those who hold
them. People are wonderful rationalizers. There is much to be said for
being the strongest country in the world; their status provides
Americans both security and psychological rewards, as well as strong
incentives to construct a rationale for preserving the unipolar moment
that goes beyond mere selfishness. [Since people enjoy being "number
one," they are susceptible to perceiving reality in ways that brings the
data in line with their desires]{.underline}. [It is no coincidence that
most hegemonic stability theorists are American]{.underline}. Of the few
hegemonic-stability theorists from elsewhere, most hail from the United
Kingdom and counsel the United States to follow the lead of the British
Empire. Perhaps [the satisfaction that comes with being the unipolar
power has inspired Americans to misperceive the positive role that their
status plays in the world]{.underline}. Three findings from political
psychology can shed light on perceptions of hegemonic stability. They
are mutually supportive, and, when taken together, suggest that it is
likely that [US policymakers overestimate the extent to which their
actions are responsible for the choices of others]{.underline}. [The
belief in the major US contribution to world peace is probably
unjustified]{.underline}. The Illusion of Control [Could 5 percent of
the world's population hope to enforce rules upon the rest?]{.underline}
[Would even an internationally hegemonic]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [be capable of producing the
New Peace?]{.underline} Perhaps, but it also may be true that [believers
in hegemonic stability may be affected by the very common tendency of
people to overestimate their ability to control events]{.underline}. A
variety of evidence has accumulated over the past forty years to support
Ellen J. Langer's original observations about [the "illusion of control"
that routinely distorts perception]{.underline}.82 [Even in situations
where outcomes are clearly generated by pure chance, people tend to
believe that they can exert control over events.]{.underline}83 There is
little reason to believe that leaders are somehow less susceptible to
such illusions than subjects in controlled experiments. The extensive
research on the illusion of control has revealed two further findings
that suggest [US illusions might be even stronger than
average]{.underline}. First, [misperceptions of control appear to be
correlated with power]{.underline}: individuals with higher
socioeconomic status, as well as those who are members of dominant
groups, are more likely to overestimate their ability to control
events.84 [Powerful people tend to be far more confident than
others]{.underline}, often overly so, and [that confidence leads them to
inflate their own importance]{.underline}.85 Leaders of superpowers are
thus particularly vulnerable to distorted perceptions regarding their
ability to affect the course of events. US observers had a greater
structural predisposition than others, for example, to believe that they
would have been able to control events in the Persian Gulf following an
injection of creative instability in 2003. The skepticism of less
powerful allies was easily discounted. Second, there is reason to
believe that culture matters as well as power. People from societies
that value individualism are more likely to harbor illusions of control
than those from collectivist societies, where assumptions of group
agency are more common. When compared to people from other parts of the
world, Westerners tend to view the world as "highly subject to personal
control," in the words of Richard Nisbett.86 North Americans appear
particularly vulnerable in this regard.87 Those who come from relatively
powerful countries with individualistic societies are therefore at high
risk for misperceiving their ability to influence events. For the United
States, the illusion of control extends beyond the water's edge. An
oft-discussed public good supposedly conferred by US hegemony is order
in those parts of the world uncontrolled by sovereign states, or the
"global commons." 88 One such common area is the sea, where the United
States maintains the only true blue-water navy in the world. That the
United States has brought this peace to the high seas is a central
belief of hegemonic-stability theorists, one rarely examined in any
serious way. Indeed the maritime environment has been unusually peaceful
for decades; the biggest naval battles since Okinawa took place during
the Falklands conflict in 1982, and they were fairly minor.89 If
hegemony is the key variable explaining stability at sea, maritime
security would have to be far more chaotic without the US Navy. It is
equally if not more plausible to suggest, however, that [the reason
other states are not building blue-water navies is not because
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [dissuades
them from doing so but rather because none feels that trade is
imperiled]{.underline}.90 In earlier times, and certainly during the age
of mercantilism, zero-sum economics inspired efforts to cut off the
trade of opponents on occasion, making control the sea extremely
important. [Today the free flow of goods is vital to all economies, and
it would be in the interest of no state to interrupt it]{.underline}.91
Free [trade at sea may no longer need protection]{.underline}, in other
words, [because it essentially has no enemies; the **sheriff may be
patrolling a crime-free neighborhood**]{.underline}. [The threat from
the few remaining pirates hardly requires a robust naval presence, and
is certainly not what hegemonic-stability advocates mean when they
compare the role played by the US Navy in 2016 to that of the Royal Navy
in 1816]{.underline}. It is at least possible that shared interest in
open, free commons keeps the peace at sea rather than the United States.
Oceans unpatrolled by the US Navy may be about as stable as they are
with the presence of its carriers. The degree to which 273 active-duty
ships exert control over vast common parts is not at all clear. [People
overestimate the degree to which they control events in their
lives]{.underline}. Furthermore, if these observations from political
psychology are right about the factors that influence the growth of
illusions of power, then [US leaders and analysts are particularly
susceptible to misperception]{.underline}. They may well be
[overestimating the degree to which the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can affect the behavior of others]{.underline}.
[The rest of the world may be able to **get along just fine**, on land
and at sea, without US attempts to control it]{.underline}.

Military Competition Heightens Security Dilemmas [The most acute and
high-profile dimension of the China challenge is the PLA's rise as a
military power of the first rank. The most tangible danger comes from
policies that encourage China to grow or use that power]{.underline}.
[Over roughly the past two decades, Chinese industrial policy has
evolved from an emphasis on economic development to national security
and autonomy]{.underline}.75 In parallel, [the PLA has been increasing
its military capabilities and shaping its force structure in a manner
that garners alarmist headlines from Western media and
pundits]{.underline}. [The two most important changes in China's
military are its navy and its nuclear arsenal---both have expanded to
degrees that are undeniable and highly complicating for Western military
analysts seeking military solutions to what are deeply political
problems.]{.underline}76 [The purpose of the PLA's naval expansion must
be understood in relation to U.S. military primacy. The operational
concept at the heart of PLA warfighting, what U.S. analysts call
"anti-access/area denial" ([A2/AD]{.mark}), [aims]{.mark} [to keep
the]{.mark} [U.S.]{.mark} military pinned down or [out of a
theater]{.mark} of combat while the PLA undertakes a mission against
some third territory]{.underline} in Asia.77 [[It is not]{.mark} a
military doctrine [capable of]{.mark} facilitating global
[conquest]{.mark} or even regional domination]{.underline}. [And it is
not designed to take over the United States or U.S. territory.
[Rather]{.mark}, A2/AD is a concept that [aims to counter]{.mark} the
advantages of U.S. [power projection]{.mark} in the event that U.S. and
Chinese forces clash in the latter's geographic
periphery.]{.underline}78 [China's nuclear expansion, meanwhile, has a
similar relational quality.]{.underline} [For a generation, [China
sustained]{.mark} a posture of nuclear "[minimum
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}"---a term of art referring to a strategy
of having just enough of a nuclear arsenal to be capa- ble of assured
nuclear retaliation in the event China is attacked with nuclear
weapons.79 In effect, China's nuclear weapons are primarily for
deterrence of nuclear attack. [Over the past decade, however, China has
rapidly accelerated its nuclear modernization.]{.underline} Since the
Trump years, China has constructed more than 200 missile siloes (we do
not know how many have warheads and how many are simply intended to
complicate U.S. targeting) and upward of 350 nuclear weapons as of 2023.
The Pentagon estimates that, at its current pace, the PLA could have
1,000 warheads by 2030.80 [It is also improving the lethality of its
arsenal]{.underline}, testing hypersonic missiles and a fractal orbital
bombardment system (FOBS)---a way of delivering warheads that defeats
early-warning radars and missile defenses.81 [At the nuclear level,
scholars judge that neither country has the desire to launch a first
strike, yet the nature of today's technologies and Sino-U.S. nuclear
postures have locked the two countries in a structural security
dilemma]{.underline}. Recent research shows that "[the shift in the
conventional balance of force in the region and the [U.S.]{.mark}
development of [low]{.mark}er-[yield]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} [has led to]{.mark} greater [fears]{.mark} in China [of
U.S. limited]{.mark} nuclear [use]{.mark} in a conflict]{.underline}.
[Chinese strategists increasingly believe that U.S. nonnuclear strategic
capabilities threaten China's nuclear forces.]{.underline}"82 As the
U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence assessed in 2023,
"Beijing worries that bilateral tension, U.S. nuclear modernization, and
the PLA's advancing conventional capabilities have increased the
likelihood of a U.S. \[nuclear\] first strike."83 [China is thus
expanding its [nuclear]{.mark} arsenal because it fears Washington might
launch nuclear strikes first]{.underline}. [The [modernization]{.mark}
of its nuclear program is a rational response to this
situation;]{.underline} [more, and more diverse, nuclear capabilities
are [necessary to ensure the PLA can retaliate]{.mark} with nuclear
weapons to U.S. nuclear first-use]{.underline}. [Expanding nuclear
capabilities from a position of inferiority, in other words, serves the
same prior goal of "minimum deterrence" but in a context where U.S.
nuclear modernization]{.underline} (priced at more than \$1.7 trillion
over thirty years and dating back to the Obama administration) [changes
the minimum capability required for deterrence]{.underline}. What makes
all this a security dilemma is that, like Chinese officials, most U.S.
policymakers have no desire to escalate to nuclear first use, and yet
the prospect of it remains all the same. To make sense of the risks of
nuclear and conventional war, we need to hold in our minds two truths at
once. [At a global, abstract level, the United States enjoys a favorable
balance of power---overwhelming military dominance relative to all other
powers. However, at a local, concrete level in Asia--- specifically
[across the]{.mark} Taiwan [Strait]{.mark}---[the b]{.mark}alance
[o]{.mark}f [p]{.mark}ower [shifted]{.mark} in favor of the PLA over
[a]{.mark} [decade]{.mark} ago.]{.underline} [The correlation of forces
across the Taiwan Strait tilts against the United States [because
of]{.mark} [geography]{.mark}.]{.underline} Taiwan sits just off China's
coast but it is 5,200 miles away from Hawai'i and 6,600 miles away from
California. Moreover, [all of Taiwan is within range of China's
integrated air defense systems [(IADS]{.mark}),]{.underline} [meaning
there is no possibility of the United States achieving air superiority
in Taiwan without disabling China's IADS]{.underline}. [[And]{.mark}
given China's [large]{.mark} surface and undersea
[fleets]{.mark}]{.underline}, [there is no way to establish sea control
or sea denial off China's coast without attacking ports and critical
infrastructure on the Chinese mainland]{.underline}. [[These must
be]{.mark} [design constraints on]{.mark} U.S. defense
[strategy]{.mark}, not opportunities for arms-racing]{.underline}.
[[Any]{.mark} traditional [warfighting scenario in Taiwan is a
loser]{.mark}, requiring a massive number of missile strikes against
targets on the Chinese mainland]{.underline}. Despite obsessive
war-gaming, [the United States has never come up with a plausible
scenario in which it can launch repeated salvos against Chinese
territory without escalating to nuclear war]{.underline}. No matter what
weapons the United States buys or builds, it cannot dominate the Taiwan
Strait militarily the way it can elsewhere in the world. But it does not
necessarily need to. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been
living with]{.mark} an [unfavorable]{.mark} correlation of
[forces]{.mark} in Taiwan for some time [and]{.mark} the situation [has
been stable,]{.mark} because the calculation of the balance]{.underline}
(who has the upper hand in a nightmare scenario) [is a separate
analytical question from what a state does with its share of the balance
at any given point]{.underline}. [Xi Jinping has said a U.S.-led
campaign of "containment and suppression" of China has "brought
unprecedented, severe challenges," rallying Chinese citizens to "dare to
fight."]{.underline}84 [It is a clear expression of resolve---a
willingness to fight, even jingoism--- but not a willingness to launch a
preventive war]{.underline}. [[China is]{.mark}
inhibited---[deterred]{.mark}---from launching an invasion of Taiwan
because it would be costly in even the best case]{.underline}. [The
United States is similarly deterred from wish-casting for war in Taiwan
because that would be unwinnable]{.underline} in any conventional sense.
The situation is thus a security dilemma, which military policies can
escalate but cannot remedy. [Arguments that the United States needs to
proliferate weapons to allies, build more bases, or accumulate missiles
to fire from standoff range in order to "hold China at risk" are missing
the forest for the trees]{.underline}---you do those things either for
an unwinnable nuclear war, or you do them in the name of deterrence.
[But while the risks of such moves are obvious, the benefits of "more
deterrence" are not. Even without a U.S. military buildup, China has
remained deterred---despite it retaining a favorable balance of power
over Taiwan---for more than a decade.]{.underline} If deterrence holds
as a status quo, then America's foremost priority ought to be not
putting deterrence itself in jeopardy. Instead, [U.S. policy is [seeking
primacy]{.mark}---that is, to retain a favorable imbalance of power,
including in the Taiwan Strait, where that is not possible]{.underline}.
It is [positioning U.S. forces to encircle China]{.underline}---an
accusation that China had been making against the United States for more
than a decade but that, since the Trump years, has become a reality.
[And it is proliferating weapons to allies and partners throughout Asia,
[buoying]{.mark}---rather than arresting---the military
[modernization]{.mark} [trend]{.mark} across the region that
[heightens]{.mark} [mistrust]{.mark} [and]{.mark} confuses war
preparation with war prevention.]{.underline} [The United States may be
undertaking all of this with defensive motives]{.underline}---rational
U.S. officials do not seek open conflict---[but these moves are as bad
for deterrence as they are for democracy. Individually and collectively,
they [exacerbate]{.mark} [security]{.mark} [dilemma]{.mark}
[dynamics]{.mark} and encourage all the choices from China that the
United States claims not to want.]{.underline}

#### But even if they're right, revisionist states are [only]{.underline} dangerous when they've [just had their ambitions denied]{.underline}\-\--the plan creates the only scenario for great power war

Hopkins-SAIS, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments, 10/24/18, "Danger: Falling Powers,"

There is, then, no disputing that [rising powers can have profoundly
disruptive effects. Yet such powers **might not**]{.underline} actually
[**be the most aggressive or risk-prone** type of revisionist
state]{.underline}. After all, [[if a country's position is]{.mark}
steadily [improving]{.mark} over time, [why risk]{.mark} messing it all
up through reckless policies that precipitate a premature
[showdown?]{.mark}]{.underline} Why not lay low until the geopolitical
balance has become still more favorable? [[Why not]{.mark} wait until
one has [surpass]{.mark}ed [the]{.mark} reigning [hegemon]{.mark}
altogether and other countries defer to one's wishes **[without a
shot]{.mark} being fired[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} So [while a rising
revisionist power may be tempted to assert itself, it
should]{.underline} also [have good reason to avoid going for
broke]{.underline}. Now [[imagine]{.mark} an alternative]{.underline}
scenario. [[A revisionist power]{.underline}]{.mark}---perhaps an
authoritarian power---[has been [gaining influence]{.mark} and
ratcheting its ambitions upward. [Its leaders]{.mark} have
[cultivated]{.mark} intense [nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} as a
pillar of their domestic legitimacy; they have [promised the
populace]{.underline} that [past insults will be avenged and [sacrifices
will be rewarded with]{.mark}]{.underline} geopolitical greatness and
[**[global prestige]{.mark}**. Yet [then the country]{.mark}'s potential
[peaks]{.mark}]{.underline}, either because it has reached its natural
limit or because of some unforeseen development, [and the balance of
[power]{.mark} starts to [shift in unfavorable
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. It becomes clear to the country's leadership
that it may not be able to accomplish the goals it has set and fulfill
the promises it has made, and that the situation will only further
worsen with time. [[A **roll of the iron dice**]{.mark} now
[seems]{.mark} more attractive: It may be [the only chance]{.mark} the
nation has [to claim]{.mark} geopolitical [spoils]{.mark} before it is
too late]{.underline}. In this scenario, [[it is **not rising power**
that makes the revisionist]{.mark} state so [dangerous, but]{.mark} the
**[temptation to act before decline sets in]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
this sense, the dynamic bears a resemblance to the famous Davies J-Curve
theory of revolution, wherein a populace is held to be more inclined to
revolt not when it is maximally oppressed but rather when raised
expectations are shown to be in vain. Obviously, [rational analysis does
not always prevail]{.underline} in world politics. Rising states can
become intoxicated with their own strength; they may simply get tired of
waiting to attain the status they desire; or some domestic pressure may
impel leaders to act dangerously. [But revisionists whose power has
begun to decline, or who have hit a rogue bump in the road,]{.underline}
**[may not feel that they even have the option of
waiting]{.underline}**.

### 2NC \-\-- China War !

**Pursuing hegemony locks in a [US-China collision]{.underline} that
goes nuclear and diverts resources from [existential
threats]{.underline}**

\"Ending Primacy to End U.S. Wars,\"

What, exactly, is Biden willing to risk in his attempt to ensure the
U.S. remains the prime power wherever and forever? Might he, or a future
president, risk war?

It is clear that the United States remains committed to [retaining its
hegemony in East Asia and]{.underline}, indeed, [primacy on a global
scale]{.underline}. But this grand strategy [may result in **pernicious
consequences**]{.underline}. [[If the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[fails to recognize China's]{.mark}
legitimate [interests]{.mark} in East Asia and Beijing's]{.underline}
understandable [desire to participate in shaping the global order, the
U.S. might **wind up fighting it**.]{.underline} [[As with the Gulf
War]{.underline}]{.mark} of 1990--91 [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark} War of 2003--11, [a]{.underline}n
ill-considered [[**commitment to primacy** might **engender**]{.mark}
**violent [conflict by pushing the U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[toward confrontation instead
of]{.mark} coop]{.underline}**eration **[and
[engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is especially worrisome given
Biden's portrayal of China as an existential threat to U.S. interests.
As the president remarked to reporters in March 2021, he believes "China
has an overall goal... to become the leading country in the world, the
wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the
world," and he is personally dedicated to ensuring that this doesn't
"happen on my watch."35

There are, of course, obvious differences between the Iraq and China
cases. Unlike Iraq, [China is a peer competitor, has nuclear weapons,
and is]{.underline} a genuine threat to U.S. regional hegemony in East
Asia. Furthermore, China is [the world's largest economy]{.underline} in
terms of purchasing power parity. The United States and China are also
far more economically interdependent than the United States and Iraq
ever were.

If the two wars with Iraq were destructive, then, a [war with China
would be **catastrophic**]{.underline}. [The value of]{.underline}
continued U.S. [primacy in East Asia is **insufficient** to justify the
enormous cost of]{.underline} such a [conflict]{.underline}. For this
reason, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[must]{.underline}]{.mark} adjust to new geostrategic realities,
[**[abandon]{.mark}** the **illusion** of indefinitely sustained
**[primacy]{.mark}**, and work with]{.underline} allies, partners, and
[China]{.underline} itself [[to avoid]{.mark} a [**deleterious
competition** that will **divert attention from**]{.mark}]{.underline}
the **[truly [existential threats]{.mark}]{.underline}** of our era:
**[[inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, population movements,
**[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
above all, **[[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Conclusion

The United States learned the wrong lessons from the Gulf War and the
Iraq War that followed. A "cheap" primacy was never achievable, and
while many analysts and decision-makers today accept the latter
intervention as an unprecedented strategic mistake, it has nevertheless
been treated as an isolated event disconnected from the United States'
broader grand strategy. In reality, [[the Iraq War]{.mark} [grew out of
the U.S. **search for primacy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Fundamentally,
[U.S.--Iraq tensions were rooted in Iraq's challenge to U.S. dominance
in the Middle East]{.underline}. Consequently, a U.S. effort to change
the regime in Baghdad was likely to occur after some inciting incident,
regardless of which political party was in power.

This insight provides guidance for how to navigate current U.S.--China
tensions. **[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[and China will be on a collision
course if U.S. policy is driven by]{.mark} a desire to sustain
[primacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** in East Asia. U.S. and Chinese leaders
must accept that neither country can dominate the other and that
[[mutual recognition is **essential**]{.mark} if we are [to
avoid]{.mark} a **disastrous**]{.underline}, potentially **[[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Those [dangers are]{.mark} particularly [evident when states
seek]{.mark} positional goods, such as [**status** or
**prestige**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [that tend to **be
zero‐​sum**]{.underline}. For instance, Wohlforth argues that status is
connected to material capabilities and that "dissatisfaction \[with
status\] arises not from dominance itself, but from dominance that
appears to rest on ambiguous foundations."28 Multipolar environments, he
argues, cause status dissatisfaction because there are multiple indexes
of capability (e.g., military, naval, economic) across which states
compare themselves, all of which provide different assessments of
status. An illustrative example is the Crimean War, where Russia pursued
status goals against an overwhelming coalition whose members themselves
had no security concerns. Wohlforth argues that Russia's power on land
and its ambiguity about Britain's economic power led Russia to pursue a
higher rank than it could secure with its capabilities. Applying those
arguments to East Asia should give us pause. [Though Wohlforth argues
that unipolarity should produce an unambiguous status hierarchy, East
Asia looks similar to]{.underline} the **[Crimean]{.underline}**
example. Using Wohlforth's metrics, [[China has the **largest ground
force in the world** and]{.mark} the [ability to **rapidly augment
it.**]{.mark}]{.underline} That point of comparison could be relevant
for potential flash points such as the Korean Peninsula. [The Chinese
navy]{.underline} is no match for its American counterpart in the open
ocean, but it [is **growing** and **modernizing** and would likely be
**operating close to its own coasts** in a potential clash]{.underline}.
Economic measures throw the problem into bold relief. Using an index of
energy consumption and iron and steel production, Britain was 13.5 times
more powerful than Russia at the time of the Crimean War. [China's GDP
is roughly half of America's now and is projected to overtake Washington
in the next couple of decades]{.underline}.29 Tsarist Russia had not
undergone the Industrial Revolution and misunderstood its economic
implications. By contrast, Chinese growth is well understood and is the
most salient feature of contemporary East Asian politics. [[There seems
**ample cause for the Chinese** to experience **status
dissatisfaction**]{.mark} across a number of metrics, [which could be
**very difficult to manage** through **American**]{.mark}
**[commitments]{.mark}** in the region.]{.underline} Offensive realist
revisionists pose a similar problem. [Offensive realism predicts a bleak
world of **relentless security competition** because of its focus
on]{.underline} **[uncertainty]{.underline}**. States cannot reliably
predict one another's intentions---a very difficult task in the present,
and an impossible one any distance into the future. "In a world where
great powers have the capability to attack one another and might have
the motive to do so," John Mearsheimer argues, states "must at least be
suspicious of other states and reluctant to trust them." [The result is
that]{.underline} "[each state tends to see itself as vulnerable and
alone]{.underline}, and therefore it aims to provide for its own
survival." The only reliable provision for security is more power.30
[Unfortunately, that conclusion means that]{.underline} "[alliances are
only **temporary marriages of convenience**]{.underline}: [today's
alliance partner might be **tomorrow's enemy**]{.underline}," and vice
versa. [Offensive realist predictions are]{.underline}, therefore,
**[trouble for primacy]{.underline}**. [Friends and foes will be looking
to take advantage of one another, and they will not be prone to
**regarding**]{.underline} the **[commitments]{.underline}** [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [made a long time ago as
**especially relevant**]{.underline} to the present. Indeed, "great
powers are also sometimes unsure about the resolve of opposing states as
well as allies." That [uncertainty leads to **calculated risks** by
aggressors and allies who begin to take security measures as though the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[may not
intervene]{.underline}**. Furthermore, because "fighting wars is a
complicated business in which it is often difficult to predict
outcomes," [[revisionists]{.mark} of all stripes [have
incentives]{.mark} toward **innovation** and **[clever
strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[[Fait accompli
tactics]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that quickly revise the status quo and
then **dare others to push for reversal**]{.underline}, [[or **new
military tech**]{.mark}**nology**]{.underline} and doctrines [that [give
revisionists hopes]{.mark} of a quick victory, are likely to be
**common** in an offensive realist world]{.underline}. [[American
commitments will be of **questionable value**]{.underline} [for
**deterrence**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**or reassurance** under those
circumstances]{.underline}.31 Nuno Monteiro has recently laid out the
problematic relationship between offensive realist assumptions and
American strategy. He argues that [[primacy]{.underline}]{.mark}---which
he calls a strategy of "defensive dominance"--- [[tends to
**create**]{.mark} **extremely dedicated minor power
[revisionists]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for two reasons. First, [[primacy
is]{.mark} a strategy of **[locking in the s]{.mark}tatus
[quo]{.mark}**]{.underline} through formal or informal commitments to
regional actors. [A favorable status quo for major regional powers will
often **come [at the expense]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} local minor
[powers]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} [may]{.mark} be **inclined to try to
[reverse it:]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for both **security reasons**
and]{.underline} the **[non‐​security]{.underline}** reasons noted
earlier, [[a unipolar world will **reduce the "value of peace"** for
some countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The strategic **[[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark}** regime---which
provides the foundation for global stability between the world's two
largest nuclear powers---[[is in **jeopardy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even
during the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union [were able to
avoid **nuclear** confrontation by]{.underline} maintaining [reliable
**[communication]{.mark}**]{.underline} channels, routine [diplomatic
[engagement]{.mark}]{.underline} on arms control,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} establishing mutually agreed
[[safeguards]{.mark} to [avoid **escalation**]{.mark}]{.underline} of
clashes [beyond]{.underline} a given threshold, [**accidents**, or
misperception.]{.underline} The experience of the Cuban Missile Crisis
that brought the United States and Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear
war heightened appreciation for the importance of cultivating a robust
nuclear arms control regime to deter U.S. and Soviet/Russian leadership
from resorting to the use of nuclear weapons. Since the 1970s, the
Soviet Union/Russia and the United States have concluded a series of
strategic arms agreements ensuring transparency and reliable mutual
verification protocols. Along with introducing transformational reforms
of glasnost and perestroika on the domestic front, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev was able to accomplish tremendous strides working with U.S.
President Ronald Reagan to achieve major bilateral nuclear arms
reductions. The fact that many fewer nations have acquired nuclear
capabilities and the international community avoided clashes involving
the use of nuclear weapons must be attributed for the most part to the
stable core foundations of the U.S.-Soviet/Russia nuclear security
regime. The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) that was set to
expire in 2026 has been halted. Russia's war in Ukraine and its severing
of relationships with the United States and its Western allies and the
collapse of U.S.-Russian strategic dialogue and engagement on arms
control, coupled with China's accelerated drive toward nuclear expansion
and escalating tensions in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship, have
ushered in a new period of instability and risk for arms control and
proliferation. U.S. President Joe Biden has acknowledged that
[[we]{.mark} have [reached an]{.mark} "**[inflection point]{.mark}**"
that]{.underline} will [determine]{.underline} the [future
**security**]{.underline} for our allies and partners and the world
community for decades ahead, but the circumstances require careful
assessment of strategic options and consequences of policy choices.
[Innovative [**approaches** will]{.mark}]{.underline} be required to
[[prevent]{.mark} catastrophic [**nuclear escalation** and
**prolif**]{.mark}eration]{.underline} of weapons of mass destruction
[as the world system transitions from]{.underline} an era of bipolar
[nuclear stability]{.underline} to a more comartifiplex three major
power nuclear configuration. Ukraine War, Derailing U.S.-Russia
Strategic Nuclear Collaboration, Risk of Nuclear Response In the past,
it has been the expectation that the United States and Soviet
Union/Russia could compartmentalize differences to prevent other
contentious issues in the bilateral relationship from interfering with
the critical areas of nuclear security and arms control. However, the
fact that Ukraine has been defined as an "existential" security priority
for Russia's leadership suggests that it is no longer a safe assumption
that Moscow will separate clashes on Ukraine from collaboration with the
United States on nuclear security. While the United States and the
Soviet Union/Russia were able to manage competition and differences in
the past on Angola, Ethiopia, Central America, Afghanistan, and, more
recently ,in the Middle East (Iraq, Libya, Syria) without undermining
strategic arms control, Ukraine's location bordering the Russian
Federation with a large Russian-speaking population and extensive
historical, cultural, and geostrategic ties elevates its importance to a
level of being associated by Russia's leadership with survival of the
state. In January 2023, the U.S. State Department reported that it was
no longer possible to verify that Russia was complying with New START
due to the Kremlin's unwillingness to allow for on-site inspections.
Russia's President Vladimir Putin announced his decision to suspend New
START in February 2023, linking resumption of the treaty with an end to
Western military support for Ukraine. The Biden administration responded
by expressing interest in engaging Russia to manage nuclear risks and
develop a post-2026 arms control framework. While Kremlin spokesperson
Dmitri Peskov described the suggestion of the U.S. administration as
"important and positive," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov
reiterated that **[[unless]{.underline}]{.mark}**
"[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} and the West as a whole [do not
radically **[revise]{.mark}**]{.underline} their [[anti-Russian
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}...productive negotiations on [[arms
control]{.mark} will **[hardly]{.mark}** be
[possible]{.mark}]{.underline}." [[**Although** Russia has]{.mark} a
**[n]{.mark}**]{.underline}o-**[[f]{.underline}]{.mark}**irst
**[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**se nuclear policy, since unleashing the
"special military operation" in Ukraine in February 2022,
[[Putin]{.mark} has [not ruled out]{.mark}]{.underline} the use of
[**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the event
that the survival of the Russian Federation was threatened. For Putin,
Russia's territory includes those areas annexed from Ukraine since 2014
(Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia). At the time of
launching Russia's incursion into Ukraine, Putin placed Russia's nuclear
forces on alert and warned that those interfering with Russia's
operation in Ukraine would face consequences on a scale "you have never
seen in your entire history." In September 2022, after annexing four
Ukrainian oblasts to Russia, Putin stated, "[In the]{.underline} event
of a [**threat** to]{.underline} the [territorial integrity]{.underline}
of our country [and to **defend Russia**]{.underline} and our people,
[we will]{.underline} certainly [**make use** of all weapon
systems]{.underline} available to us. This is not a bluff." Russia's
military forces seized control the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant
which is the largest in Europe early on in the war generating concerns
about possible nuclear disaster. In March 2023, Putin announced that
[Russia would station **t**]{.underline}actical
**[n]{.underline}**uclear **[w]{.underline}**eapon**[s]{.underline}** in
Belarus contending this was [no different than]{.underline} the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[positioning nuclear assets among]{.underline} allied nations in
[Europe]{.underline}. \<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>. Putin's
remarks at the St. Petersburg Economic Forum in July 2023 seemed to dial
back concerns about nuclear responses in Ukraine. Putin justified moving
tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus as an "element of deterrence" for
those "thinking about inflicting strategic defeat" of Russia. Following
recounting setbacks in Ukraine's counteroffensive, Putin reiterated that
Russia's official doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons in
situations where the survival of the nation was threatened but then
implied that this option was not necessary at this point. In mid-August
2023, the United States announced approval for the Netherlands and
Denmark to provide F16 fighter jets to Ukraine. Russia has been targeted
with a series of drone strikes on military installations and buildings
in civilian areas over the past months attributed to Ukrainians
operating within the Russian Federation. Following announcement in
August 2023 that the Biden administration would provide the 45 tranche
of military assistance in Ukraine, including additional ammunition for
High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS), Javelin and anti-armor
rockets, Hydra 70 rockets, and 3 million rounds of small arms
ammunition, the head of Russia's space agency ROSCOSMOS Yuri Borisov
stated that the Sarmat MIRV equipped intercontinental ballistic missile
had been placed into service---a weapon that Putin had said would make
Moscow's enemies "think twice." Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security
Council Dmitry Medvedev has issued periodic warnings about a nuclear
scenario stating that "loss of a nuclear power in a conventional war can
provoke the outbreak of nuclear war" and that Russia may be forced to
use a nuclear weapon if Ukraine's counteroffensive succeeds. On August
28, 2023, Medvedev posted on Telegram that Ukraine's approval from
Western nations for missile strikes throughout Russia or to attack
Crimea unfortunately indicates that the "prophecies of the Apocalypse"
were closer. Statements from Russia's leadership on willingness to
resort to the use of nuclear weapons over Ukraine have been echoed by
discussions taking place among leading defense experts. Sergei
Karaganov, former presidential advisor and dean of the Higher School of
Economics in Moscow, published an article in June 2023 calling for
Russia to undertake preemptive nuclear strikes against several European
countries as a way to end the war in Ukraine. While Karaganov
acknowledged that this would be a "terrible choice" on a moral level, he
contends that it is necessary to prevent the West from leading the world
to a final "full-scale" and "last world war for humanity.\" Karaganov's
article prompted a series of responses among other leading analysts of
Russia's foreign policy community contending that employing a nuclear
strike would not "sober up the West" or that Karaganov's position
"underestimates the willingness of Western elites' determination to
climb the escalation ladder with Russia, and, if necessary ahead of
it\..."Former head of the Carnegie Moscow Center Dmitry Trenin affirmed
that nuclear weapons have been "on the table" from the outset and that
basing U.S. strategy on the "belief that the Russian leadership will not
dare use nuclear weapons in the current conflict" was an "extremely
dangerous misperception." Russia's channel 1 and other state-sponsored
media networks have hosted programs with pundits, analysts, and
legislative leaders calling for nuclear responses over Ukraine. U.S.
President Biden cautioned at the outset of the Ukraine conflict that a
direct U.S.-Russia war must be avoided because of nuclear risks. In
October 2022, Biden warned that the risk of nuclear "armageddon" was the
highest it had been since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Biden has said
that there was no way to use tactical nuclear weapons on a battlefield
without it ending in Armageddon. In June 2023, he stated that the threat
issued by Putin to use nuclear weapons was "real" and that deployment of
tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus was "absolutely irresponsible." U.S.
officials have warned of "catastrophic consequences" for nuclear use,
but Biden has remained ambiguous in spelling out scenarios and likely
U.S. responses, which have traditionally been essential for deterrence.
Several analysts have tended to downplay threats of the use of nuclear
weapons coming from Moscow as "bluffing," but others have not dismissed
the possibility or even certainty. Although Putin has referenced the
doctrinal foundation and taken steps to prepare for employing a nuclear
response, he must weigh the consequences in loss of life, destruction of
the environment and infrastructure, and damage to existing significant
international partnerships. China, India, and other valuable partner
nations for Russia have emphasized that nuclear weapons should not be
used in the Ukraine war. There are options available to Russia in the
conventional, cyber, or other domains that would not entail the costs of
using nuclear weapons. At the same time, there is a high risk that the
war in Ukraine could escalate involving neighboring nations evoking an
Article V response from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
and the potential for unleashing a nuclear response should not be ruled
out. The longer the war in Ukraine continues the greater the risk of
miscalculation and accidents that could result in a nuclear
confrontation. Russia had supported Washington and Beijing in containing
North Korea's nuclear development, but the fact that Putin has turned to
Kim Jong-un as a source for ammunition for the Ukraine war with the
prospect for Russia-North Korea cooperation in the nuclear sphere
represents a setback for managing nuclear security and proliferation.
Russia's military cooperation with Iran in the wake of the war in
Ukraine with Tehran providing lethal drone technology and Moscow
offering diplomatic support to Iran poses further complications for
nuclear safeguard compliance. The suspension of the U.S.-Russia New
START, threats of resorting to the use of nuclear weapons and shifting
geopolitical alignments resulting from clashes over Ukraine has
destabilized the global nuclear security order. The issue of perhaps
highest priority on the U.S.-Russia security agenda, ongoing
collaboration among the two nations holding the world's largest nuclear
arsenals, is now in question. NATO Enlargement, Failed Diplomacy, Costs
and Risks of Military Engagement \<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>. Moscow's
invasion of the sovereign nation of Ukraine has come at enormous cost,
but [the **West**]{.underline} also [[made]{.mark} strategic
**[choices]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [contributed to **[provoking
conflict]{.mark}** with Russia. [Russia's]{.mark}
leadership]{.underline}, defense, [and]{.underline} foreign policy
[community]{.underline} [**[consistently]{.underline}** [expressed
**opposition** to expansion]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Western security
alliance. George F. Kennan, architect of America's post-World War II
Soviet containment strategy, had warned that expansion of NATO would be
"[the most **fateful error** of American policy]{.underline} in the
entire post-Cold War era." Moscow tolerated the first rounds of NATO
enlargement in the Baltics and Eastern Europe, but claimed that NATO's
military involvement in Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO crossed a
line constituting a serious immediate and long-term potential threat to
Russia. \<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\> Moscow's leadership had
broached proposals to develop a European security architecture that
would take account of Russia's interests. In 2008, Dmitry Medvedev, then
serving as president of the Russian Federation, advanced a proposal for
a new European security order followed by additional proposals prior to
the invasion of Ukraine that were not afforded serious consideration
among Western nations. Suggestions in the aftermath of the unraveling of
the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact that NATO was dead or had no purpose
were unfounded. NATO provided a platform for bringing nations together
to strengthen capacity for addressing a broad range of significant
security challenges including promoting collaboration in managing
weapons of mass destruction, countering terrorism, cyber and maritime
cooperation, providing disaster support, and much more. Together with
the EU, NATO offered assistance to Soviet successor nations in Europe
and Eurasia for democratic reform, defense transformation, and capacity
building. The NATO-Russia Council fostered practical security
cooperation and consultation until Moscow's annexation of Crimea in
2014, but, for Russians, NATO enlargement was considered a betrayal of
pledges on the part of the United States and its allies that NATO would
not expand and the possibility of Ukraine engaging in military
collaboration with the Western security alliance or Ukraine joining NATO
became a defining red-line for the Kremlin. The reality is that Ukraine
was not a likely candidate for NATO membership in the foreseeable
future, but Western involvement in the Euro-Maidan uprising that
contributed to unseating Ukraine's pro-Russian President Viktor
Yanukovych prompted Moscow's annexation of Crimea. The collapse of the
Minsk peace process and lack of commitment in finding a workable
diplomatic solution for resolving differences between Kyiv and Moscow on
Crimea and Russian-speaking communities in Donbas escalated into the
devastating war witnessed today. The disclosure by former German
Chancellor Angela Merkel revealing that Germany and other Western
nations were not sincere about reaching a diplomatic settlement between
Russia and Ukraine, but only sought to gain time for Ukraine to enhance
NATO military collaboration and presence in Ukraine has done nothing to
enlist confidence that a diplomatic settlement would be possible. The
Russia-Ukraine war has cost thousands of lives, displaced much of the
Ukrainian population, destabilized the European and Eurasian security
and economic orders, and disrupted global energy and food supplies. Had
Ukraine been willing to forego NATO membership remaining neutral, this
war would likely have been averted. Dedicated commitment on the part of
all involved to pursue diplomatic channels toward developing alternative
approaches for the post-Cold War European security structure would
certainly have been preferable to suffering the tragic losses in
Ukraine. There is no reason that Ukraine should not have been able to
maintain ties with Russia and other Eastern European neighbors while
simultaneously benefitting from cooperation with the Euro-Atlantic
community. Moscow's leadership contends that this is not simply a
conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but that the West wants to destroy
Russia. The perception that the West seeks strategic defeat of the
Russian state is not unfounded. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's
public statement that the United States intends to "weaken Russia" by
providing military support to Ukraine and frequent comments on prospects
for regime change in Moscow by Western policy officials and analysts
reinforces the Kremlin's assessments regarding U.S./Western intentions.
Any strategy aimed to destabilize and drive a major world nuclear power
into a rogue nation status is obviously misguided and dangerous. Russia
is still a European power and stabilizing Moscow's relationships with
nations of the transatlantic community will remain consequential for
European and wider global security. Ukraine's most recent June 2023
counteroffensive has been unsuccessful and it should be understood that
Ukraine can not win a war with a much larger committed nuclear power.
Anticipating the difficulties ahead for the Ukrainian military in
re-taking occupied territories, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Mark Milley had said in late 2022 after successes in Kharkiv and Kherson
that it might be time to consider entering into discussions on a
political settlement. This suggestion was widely rejected, and the Biden
administration has been clear that decisions on ending the war in
Ukraine would rest with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and the
Ukrainian population. However, the setbacks in Ukraine's most recent
June 2023 counteroffensive has generated consideration among some in the
administration about the need for an exit strategy. The current period
of geopolitical upheaval in Europe and Eurasia is fraught with risks and
at a minimum it will be important for the United States and its allies
to support Ukraine in re-building and to stabilize relationships with
Russia in order to prevent a wider Russia-NATO or world war. It is
important to recognize that a consequence of the choices that have been
made over Ukraine present major obstacles for continuation of a central
U.S. security priority that has ensured global stability over the past
decades, the U.S.-Russian nuclear arms regime. If the war in Ukraine
continues to grind on for years or becomes a "forever war," the
prospects for negotiating a new START agreement before it expires in
2026 may be over, ending an era of cooperation in arms control and
proliferation. This should be a major motivating factor for resuming
dialogue and diplomacy toward ending the war in Ukraine avoiding further
loss of life and devastation and setting a foundation for a return to
normalcy in managing nuclear arms and proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction. \<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>
**[[Russia-China]{.underline}]{.mark}** Strategic Partnership and
Prospects for Tripartite Major Power Nuclear Engagement Although the
history of the Sino-Russian relationship has not been without clashes,
[the two countries have become]{.underline} more [closely
**aligned**]{.underline} over the past decade forging a burgeoning
"strategic partnership" [described]{.underline} by Russia's President
Vladimir Putin and China's President Xi Jinping [as a "partnership
without limits."]{.underline} Following escalation of tensions with the
West over Russia's annexation of Crimea, Moscow moved to further
strengthen its relationship with Beijing. Moscow continued to turn to
China to offset stringent economic sanctions imposed by the United
States and its European allies in response to Russia's military
incursion in Ukraine. Beijing attributes the Russo-Ukraine war to
Western meddling in Ukraine's domestic politics and NATO's tendency to
remain locked in a Cold War mindset insisting on expansion of the
alliance. [Russia and China [find]{.mark} **common
[ground]{.mark}**]{.underline} in [[resisting]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S.
global [**hegemony** and challenging [American
**leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the rules-based liberal
international order. **[[Both]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline} believe that they [[should be **entitled**
to]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[greater **influence**]{.mark} in shaping
world order]{.underline} in the contemporary multipolar system. Though
the two countries no longer share ideological affinity, both Vladimir
Putin and Xi Jinping are concerned about protecting security of the
state and have been united in opposing Western intervention to advance
democracy which they contend has resulted in chaos and destabilizing
societies. Moscow and Beijing want to ensure that the kind of domestic
turmoil that fueled the color revolutions in Eurasia and upheavals in
the Middle East will never pose threats of regime change in their
respective nations. Cultivation of relationships on the part of Russia
and China with nations of the Global South is another means of
counterbalancing the influence of the United States and its Western
allies. Both countries issue narratives emphasizing legacies of Western
imperialism, moral decadence, and claims of exceptionalism invoking
calls for respecting the diversity of world civilizations and
traditions. Offering investment without imposing domestic requirements
has contributed to China surpassing U.S. economic presence throughout
much of the world. The significant expansion of numbers of nations that
would like to join BRICS threatens the preeminence of U.S. currency and
influence in global finance and economic development over the long term.
[Russia and China]{.underline} have [**[expanded]{.mark}**
military-to-military [**cooperation** and]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[held]{.underline} routine [large-scale military
**[exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline} since 2018 [[in **Asia**, the
**Baltics**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[Mediterranean]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [Russia]{.underline} has
[sold]{.underline} some of its most [advanced]{.underline} military
[equipment to China]{.underline}. While China's economy far exceeds that
of Russia, Russia as one of the world's two largest nuclear powers can
offer support to China in accelerating nuclear development. During the
visit of Xi Jinping to Russia in March 2023, [Putin
announced]{.underline} that Russia's state atomic energy corporation
Rosatom and China's Atomic Energy Agency had entered into a long-term
contract that would include [[exporting **plutonium**]{.mark} from
Russia to China]{.underline} for use in nuclear reactors potentially
[[contributing to]{.underline}]{.mark} more [rapid [**expansion**
of]{.mark} China's [nuclear **arsenal**]{.mark}. [China and
Russia]{.mark} do **not** yet have]{.underline} an
"**[alliance]{.underline}**," [but]{.underline} the two countries have
been [[driven **closer** as]{.mark} a [result of
tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} with the United States. While the conflict
over Ukraine has led to collapse of the initial post-Soviet
rapprochement between the United States and Russia, [the
U.S.-China]{.underline} bilateral [[**relationship**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} quite [[strained over
**Taiwan**]{.underline},]{.mark} competition for [influence in [the
**S**]{.mark}]{.underline}outh **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**hina
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea and wider Asia, economic reprisals in
[the tech]{.underline}nology [sphere]{.underline}, and more. The
Russia-China strategic partnership has advanced too far to hope that the
United States would be able to drive a wedge between the two countries.
The Biden administration's identification of the struggle between
democracy and autocracy as the guiding vision for [American foreign
policy]{.underline} presents additional difficulties for enlisting
cooperation in nuclear security and other critical areas or to avoid
[**uniting** Russia and China]{.underline} against American interests.
In considering approaches to arms control in the current conflictual and
rapidly shifting geopolitical circumstances, U.S. policy officials
should understand that both Moscow and Beijing will expect an equal say
in setting terms for engagement. Major regional concerns for both
countries including Ukraine for Russia and Taiwan for China stand as
impediments to advancing cooperation in nuclear security. Toward a
Tripartite Nuclear Framework for the 21st Century Global Security
Environment Concepts for policies of the past that were effective in
containing geopolitical and ideological clashes among nuclear rivals
such as "peaceful coexistence" and "détente" or aspirations for building
U.S.-Russian "strategic partnership" in the early post-Soviet period no
longer exist. [There is much **greater focus**]{.underline} today
[on]{.underline} what is perceived as inevitable peer or near-peer
[major power **confrontation** rather than considering ways
[nations]{.mark}]{.underline} of different historical experience,
cultures, values, and core interests [[might]{.underline}]{.mark}
co-exist and [**[cooperate]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}]{.mark}
[ensure]{.underline} strategic [security]{.underline}. [**Policymakers**
of]{.underline} the [three nations **[confront]{.mark}**]{.underline} an
emerging global security environment that is more daunting not only
because of [**transition** from a bipolar to a **tripolar**
major]{.underline} power [nuclear order]{.underline}, but also because
protecting nuclear security has become more problematic because of [new
developments in]{.underline} areas such [as [**space**, **cyber**, or
**a**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence.]{.underline} If the
United States and Russia are not able to establish a framework for
continued collaboration in arms control after the expiration of START in
2026 and China is not engaged in nuclear arms control, [the global
**community** will face]{.underline} unprecedented circumstances of
[unconstrained **nuclear** arms **competition**]{.underline}. Beijing is
on track to have 1,500 nuclear warheads by 2035 and has been exceeding
predictions in terms of the pace of development in nuclear capacity, but
China has traditionally been unwilling to participate in arms control
believing that this would only provide advantages to nations with much
larger nuclear arsenals. While the prospects for forging a tripartite
nuclear regime appear quite limited in the current
geopolitical/strategic circumstances, it is simply too important for
global security not to make every effort to preserve longstanding
cooperation with Russia in arms control and proliferation and to foster
nuclear security cooperation with Beijing. Prior to the Ukraine war, we
suggested that the U.S. administration might boldly propose a tripartite
security dialogue with Russia and China to manage nuclear challenges and
other security issues of shared concern. This approach would underscore
U.S. recognition of the major power status of both countries and the
importance of engaging in a constructive and pragmatic spirit to address
issues impacting citizens of all three countries and the world
community. The U.S. administration should understand the risks of
driving Russia and China closer and explore ways to engage with both
countries so as to diffuse the perception that the United States sees no
alternative to future major power war. In the past, relationships among
Presidents have been pivotal in advancing the U.S.-Soviet/Russia arms
control agenda. The fact that the U.S. and Russian presidents do not
communicate and China's president has been reluctant to meet with the
U.S. president presents a major obstacle for advancing an arms control
agenda. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to China in June
2023 was promising in terms of generating dialogue on the U.S.-China
bilateral agenda, but Biden's reference to Xi as a "dictator" upon
Blinken's return from China elicited angry reactions from Beijing.
Presuming that it might be possible to resume dialogue and negotiations
on nuclear security at some point, it would of course be important to
approach discussions with realistic aspirations and low expectations.
This is a process that will require highly skilled diplomats with
commitment, patience, and capacity to recognize the stakes and risks of
failure. All parties must appreciate that there is no winning a war
among nuclear powers and the United States, Russia, and China would
benefit by strengthening commitment to exhausting all diplomatic options
for avoiding conflict and rapid termination of kinetic clashes. Pledges
like "fighting until the last Ukrainian" or promulgating protracted wars
will not bode well for nuclear arms control and avoiding catastrophic
loss of life that should be unacceptable to all. Engaging in discussions
on crisis avoidance, crisis management, and implementing safeguards to
prevent misperceptions that could result in nuclear use would be obvious
priorities. Reliable communication channels among the three nations will
be essential for managing clashes and ensuring that intentions are clear
in any crisis situation. In current circumstances in which nuclear
threats have been issued over the conflict in Ukraine, [[the **risk**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} a [regional conflict [**escalating** to
nuclear]{.mark} use]{.underline} should be clear. Perhaps considering a
tripartite no first-use option would provide an objective that the three
nations could work to accomplish. Recent serious U.S. bilateral clashes
with both Russia and China only underscore the importance for
continually reviewing arms control and deterrence strategies to adjust
to rapidly shifting geopolitical circumstances. Entering into dialogue
on nuclear security would help the three parties to gain better
understanding of the capabilities and intentions of the others. Russia
has agreed to abide by the New START limits on numbers of deployed
long-range nuclear forces. The United States and Russia might consider
agreeing to reductions in order to incentivize China's cooperation.
Destabilization of major nuclear power collaboration will undermine
successes of the nuclear non-proliferation regime as several nations
will only be more determined to acquire nuclear capacity in response to
changing and strained geopolitical circumstances. In the past, although
the United States has been able to collaborate with Russia and China on
issues such as engaging Iran in nuclear negotiations, reigning in the
North Korean nuclear threat, and achieving successes in nuclear
nonproliferation, [the risk of uncontrolled
**proliferation**]{.underline} among both state and non-state actors
[[will only **increase**]{.mark} if the three countries are not able to
manage]{.underline} geopolitical [strains]{.underline}. Given the
[**longstanding** U.S.-Soviet/Russia **experience** and prior
**successes** in nuclear arms control]{.underline}, it would be wise to
build on this foundation and experience [while **reaching** out to bring
**China**]{.underline} into a major nuclear power triad. Simultaneously,
it would be important to [strengthen multilateral
negotiations]{.underline} in nuclear security among P5 countries while
perhaps broadening dialogue with other nuclear nations regarding
safeguards necessary for developments in artificial intelligence and
other areas. These measures toward preventing a nuclear arms race,
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and avoiding nuclear first
use will certainly be difficult to implement at this juncture. However,
such steps would serve the interests of the United States, Russia, and
China and [**enhance** security of the global **community**]{.underline}
and should be among the highest priorities for the world's leading
nuclear powers.

However, over a period of time starting roughly from the turn of the
millennium, the painfully crafted [**[n]{.mark}**uclear
**[a]{.mark}**rms **[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline} (NAC) [instruments
have been **withering**]{.underline} away. In fact, the [US and Russia
currently [stand at]{.mark} the **delicate [threshold]{.mark}** where
their bilateral nuclear arms control is [held]{.mark} together
[by]{.mark} the **slender [thread]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **only** the
**[New START]{.mark}** Treaty. [This]{.mark} too [could
**snap**]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2021 unless the two sides agree to
extend the treaty. Signs of this happening at the time of this writing
appear quite unclear. On the other hand, [what looks **absolutely
clear** is]{.underline} the rather [**grim** nuclear arms control
scenario [as]{.mark} **old [mechanisms]{.mark}** [fade out]{.mark} and
**no new ones** are in sight]{.underline}. USA and Russia are going
through a low phase in their relationship and neither is showing any
interest in engaging on nuclear issues. Meanwhile, the number of nuclear
players has increased from only these two. Multiple [nuclear
dyads]{.underline} ([[**US**-**Russia**]{.mark}, US-**[China]{.mark}**,
US-[**DPRK**, **China-India**,]{.mark}
**India-[Pakistan]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [and the
**[spillover]{.mark}** of developments in capability taking place in
each dyad onto the other, [creating]{.mark} nuclear **[chain
relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, is a new phenomenon. To further
exacerbate the situation, [**[emerging tech]{.mark}**nologies are
**[threatening]{.mark}** to intersect]{.underline} with nuclear
deterrence [[in novel ways]{.mark} and **none** of the]{.underline}
nuclear armed [states is showing **any inclination** to
manage]{.underline} these develop- ments or even acknowledge the need
for doing so. Lastly, a further complication is being created by the
re-emergence of old ideas, such as those of low yield weapons for
nuclear war fighting, or of limited nuclear war. These concepts had long
ago been abandoned as unfeasible and dangerous, but they seem to be
staging a comeback into nuclear doctrines. The [result]{.underline} of
all these developments [is a complex and **extremely stressed** global
**nuclear conundrum**]{.underline} with severe regional implications.
New Delhi is one capital that has traditionally been far away from the
world of arms control. As a non-nuclear weapons possessor until 1998,
and as a country that actively campaigned for the complete elimination
of nuclear weapons as a way of safeguarding its national security, India
considered bilateral NAC between the US and USSR/Russia as one way,
though not necessarily an optimal way, of eventually moving towards
nuclear disarmament. It was perceived as a mechanism that had a largely
bilateral significance but which, never- theless, helped reduce nuclear
risks, arrested the offence-defence cycle and hence had a benign
influence on international security. However, New Delhi was always
conscious of the fact that China, whose nuclear capability impinged on
its security, was not party to any such controls. Yet, the hope was
sustained that the nuclear threat from China would be addressed through
universal nuclear disarmament, realised through the Non-proliferation
Treaty (NPT). This hope, however, was dashed when the NPT was granted an
indefinite and unconditional extension in 1995. Meanwhile, around the
same time, pressures on India to join the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) as a non-nuclear weapon state increased. Keeping its security
compulsions in view, India felt pressured to demonstrate its own nuclear
weapons capability and establish nuclear deterrence. But, in the
process, India's faith in the ability of bilateral arms control or
multilateral non-proliferation instruments to attain nuclear disarmament
was lost. Since the possession of nuclear weapons, [[India]{.mark} is
**more [awake]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}]{.underline} the more realistic
utility of [**[n]{.mark}**uclear **[a]{.mark}**rms **[c]{.mark}**ontrol
as an arms race **management** instrument]{.underline} or a risk
reduction instrument. It is for this reason that the [**ongoing**
[developments]{.mark} in NAC should **[matter]{.mark}** for India, [even
if these are]{.mark} taking place [in]{.mark} the **US-[Russia]{.mark}**
[bilateral]{.mark} **[domain]{.mark}**. They do impact the global
**nuclear order**, will have implications for **China**, and thereby
also on **India**]{.underline}. Whether the future trajectory of NAC
will result in positive consequences or adverse ones for New Delhi will
depend on many factors, including how these are handled. This article
highlights four main issues that will have implications at the global
and regional levels, for India in particular. Loss of an NAC model [The
**[n]{.mark}**uclear **[a]{.mark}**rms **[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline}
arrangements [[between]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
USSR/**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, most of which were underwritten
by verification mechanisms, [[presented]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves
as [a [**template** for others]{.mark} to **follow**. They could be
described as a **model**]{.underline} (even if less than adequate from
the disarmament point of view) [or an **anchor** of successful arms race
**management**]{.underline} and their effective implementation [provided
an [**incentive** for other]{.mark} **nuclear [dyads]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}to adopt and adapt]{.underline}. In the current circumstances,
however, the abandonment of most of these bilateral treaties has led to
the loss of an example or mould of nuclear arms control that could have
been used bilaterally or multilaterally. While a copy of the written
text of the agreement would, of course, be always available, [the
**spirit** seems **lost**]{.underline}. The historical experience of how
to arrive at such agreements in an atmosphere of deep mistrust would be
lost eventually too, [as the **habit** of nuclear engagement **fades
away** in the case of US and Russia]{.underline}, even before it has
been born in the case of other nuclear dyads. Therefore, [despite all
its **imperfections**, the NAC]{.underline} architecture [was a
**framework** whose loss will have **implications** for international
**security**]{.underline}. Presence of Nuclear Cacophony [The
[**vacuum** created by]{.mark} the [loss]{.mark} of NAC has been [filled
by]{.mark} an atmosphere of 'free for all' or **nuclear
[cacophony]{.mark}** that is [allowing]{.mark} a **free [run]{.mark}**
[towards]{.mark} an **[offence]{.mark}-defence
[spiral]{.mark}**]{.underline} as countries pursue the concept of
absolute security. The idea of mutual vulnerability that underwrote
nuclear deterrence, and which sought to be enshrined through the NAC,
appears to be a casualty of the process. This can be prominently seen in
the context of US-Russia and US- China threat perceptions of one another
and their consequent capability build up. Russia and China have long
expressed their concern about how the US ballistic missile defence (BMD)
would undercut their nuclear deterrence. To address the perceived
instability that would be so created, [they have moved ahead
with]{.underline} the deployment of [**MIRVed** missiles]{.underline},
cruise missiles, [and]{.underline} the development of hypersonic glide
vehicles (**[HGV]{.underline}**) to defeat the BMD.

Times; New York Times, "The Risk of Nuclear Conflict is Rising,"
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/07/opinion/nuclear-war-prevention.html\]

At the heart of all of this work is a [**chilling** conclusion: The
[possibility of]{.mark} a **nuclear [strike]{.mark}**, once
**inconceivable**]{.underline} in modern conflict, [[is more likely
**now** than]{.mark} at **[any other time]{.mark}** since the **Cold
War**. "We\'ve had 30 pretty **success**ful years keeping the **genie in
the bottle**]{.underline}," a senior administration official on the
Tiger Team said. While both America and Russia have hugely reduced their
nuclear arsenals since the height of the Cold War, the official said,
"Right now is when nuclear risk is most at the forefront." Russian
President Vladimir Putin [**reminded** the world of this
[**existential** danger]{.mark}]{.underline} last week when he publicly
warned of nuclear war if NATO deepened its involvement in Ukraine. [The
risk of **nuc**lear escalation [in **Ukraine**,]{.mark} while **now
low**, has been]{.underline} a primary **[concern]{.underline}** for the
Biden administration throughout the conflict, details of which are being
reported here for the first time. In a series of interviews over the
past year, U.S. and Ukrainian officials spoke on condition of anonymity
to discuss internal planning, diplomacy and ongoing security
preparations. And while it may cause sleepless nights in Washington and
Kyiv, most of the world has barely registered the threat. Perhaps it's
because an entire generation came of age in a post-Cold War world, when
the possibility of nuclear war was thought to be firmly behind us. It is
time to remind ourselves of the consequences in order to avoid them.
\<\<GRAPHIC OMITTED\>\> EVEN AFTER LAST week's nuclear threat, few
believe that Mr. Putin will wake up one day and decide to lob megaton
warheads at Washington or European capitals in retaliation for
supporting Ukraine. What Western allies see as more likely is that
Russia will use a so-called tactical nuclear weapon, which is less
destructive and designed to strike targets over short distances to
devastate military units on the battlefield. The strategic thinking
behind those weapons is that they are far less damaging than
city-destroying hydrogen bombs and therefore more "usable" in warfare.
The United States estimates Russia has a stockpile of up to 2,000
tactical nuclear warheads, some small enough they fit in an artillery
shell. But the detonation of any tactical nuclear weapon would be an
unprecedented test of the dogma of deterrence, a theory that has
underwritten America's military policy for the past 70 years. The idea
stipulates that adversaries are deterred from launching a nuclear attack
against the United States --- or more than 30 of its treaty-covered
allies --- because by doing so they risk an overwhelming counterattack.
Possessing nuclear weapons isn't about winning a nuclear war, the theory
goes; it's about preventing one. It hinges upon a carefully calibrated
balance of terror among nuclear states. \<\<GRAPHIC OMITTED\>\> IF MR.
PUTIN dropped a nuclear weapon on Ukraine --- a nonnuclear nation that's
not covered by anyone's nuclear umbrella --- what then? If deterrence
fails, how is it possible to reduce the risk of one attack escalating
into a global catastrophe? We might find an answer in the autumn of
2022, when fears of Russia's nuclear use in Ukraine were most palpable.
A lightning Ukrainian military counteroffensive had reclaimed territory
from the Russians in the northeastern region of Kharkiv. The Ukrainians
were on the cusp of breaching Russian defense lines at Kherson in the
south, possibly causing a second Russian retreat that could signal an
imminent broader military collapse. U.S. intelligence estimated that if
Ukraine's fighters managed to break through Russian defenses --- and
were on the march to the occupied Crimean Peninsula, where the Russian
Black Sea Fleet is based --- it came down to a coin flip whether or not
Russia would launch a tactical nuclear weapon to stop them, senior
administration officials said. Moscow has made implicit and explicit
nuclear threats throughout the war to scare off Western intervention.
Around this time, however, a series of frightening episodes took place.
On Oct. 23, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu of Russia made a flurry of
phone calls to the defense chiefs of four NATO nations, including
Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, to say Russia had indications that
Ukrainian fighters could detonate a dirty bomb --- a conventional
explosive wrapped in radioactive material --- on their own territory to
frame Moscow. American intelligence also intercepted chatter around then
among Russian military leaders about using a tactical nuclear weapon,
according to current and former Biden administration officials. General
Austin and the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, held
three phone calls in four days with Russian counterparts during this
tense period. Believing the Russians were building an unfounded pretext
for their own nuclear attack, the Biden administration quickly began a
multilateral effort with allies, adversaries and nations in between to
de-escalate the situation and try to talk Moscow out of it. For nearly a
week, Biden aides pulled all-nighters at the White House, coordinating
high-level conversations and planning for the worst: the detonation of a
small nuclear device in Ukrainian territory that had the power of a few
kilotons or less. Many in the administration believed the Kremlin's
dirty bomb ploy posed the greatest risk of nuclear war since the 1962
Cuban missile crisis. State Department officials traveled to Poland to
ensure that medical supplies and radiation equipment were rushed over
the border. The Energy Department sent equipment to collect potential
debris so that it could be later analyzed by American scientists for
weapon design characteristics and the origin of the nuclear material.
U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees nuclear operations, directed a
team of experts (cheekily named The Writers' Club, because their
findings were written up daily for the Pentagon leadership) to assess
the risk and determine which conditions would trigger Russia to go
nuclear. While cautions about the potential withering economic,
diplomatic and military consequences were delivered in private to
Moscow, administration officials also publicly sounded alarm bells. The
administration's diplomatic push was coupled with efforts by leaders of
several nations, including China, India and Turkey, to explain to Mr.
Putin's government the potential costs if he were to go through with a
nuclear attack. That November, the director of the Central Intelligence
Agency, William J. Burns, met with his Russian counterpart in Turkey,
where he conveyed a similar warning. On Nov. 16, the Group of 20
released a joint statement: If the Russian leader was indeed inching
toward the brink, he stepped back. WHAT TOOK PLACE to prevent a nuclear
attack that fall was a rare moment of consensus on an issue on which
world leaders seem to be moving farther apart. Russia is replacing its
Soviet-era hardware with new jets, missiles and submarines. And the
other eight nations that have nuclear weapons are believed to be
enhancing their arsenals in parts of the world that are already on edge.
**[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has continuing tensions over its
borders with China and Pakistan, [is [fielding
**longer**]{.mark}**-range** [weapons. **Pakistan**]{.mark} is
[developing **new** **b**]{.mark}allistic **[m]{.mark}**issiles and
expanding nuclear **production** facilities. **[North
Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which has an arsenal of several hundred
missiles and dozens of nuclear warheads, regularly [**threatens** to
attack South Korea]{.underline}, where the U.S. keeps about 28,500
troops. **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which has publicly expressed
its desire to control the U.S.-allied island of Taiwan by force if
necessary, [is **increasing** its nuclear **arsenal**]{.underline} at a
"scale and pace unseen since the U.S.-Soviet nuclear arms race that
ended in the late 1980s," the Congressional Commission on the Strategic
Posture of the United States concluded in October. So while Washington
has been helping Ukraine prepare for a nuclear attack, [[**Taiwan**
or]{.mark} **South [Korea]{.mark}** could be **next**]{.underline}. The
National Security Council has already coordinated contingency playbooks
for possible [conflicts]{.underline} that [[could turn **nuclear**
in]{.mark} **Taiwan**, the **Korea**n Peninsula and the [**Middle
East**. **Iran**]{.mark}, which has [**continued** its
**nuc**]{.mark}lear [program amid **Israel**'s war]{.mark} on Hamas in
**Gaza**, has [amassed **enough**]{.mark} enriched **uranium** [to
build]{.mark} several **[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} if and when it
chooses. During this time of widening conflict, the rising nuclear
threat is especially destabilizing: A nuclear explosion in Ukraine or
Gaza, where tens of thousands of civilians have already been killed or
injured, would sizeably escalate either conflict and its humanitarian
toll. The world has been through a version of this moment before. The
last nuclear standoff during the Cold War was cooled in part because of
numerous nonproliferation efforts and arms control agreements between
the United States and the former Soviet Union. The two nations,
recognizing the terrifying situation they were in, worked to identify
weapons that were mutually menacing and simply agreed to eliminate them.
Nuclear warhead numbers plummeted to 12,500 today from roughly 70,400 in
1986. [Now that shared **[safety]{.mark} net** [of
**treaties**]{.mark}]{.underline} and agreements [[is **nearly

**[Even the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [cannot
prudently take on **every adversary** on **multiple
fronts**]{.underline}. [The costs of **military campaigns** against
these adversaries]{.underline} in their backyards, [whether in the
**Baltic States** or **Taiwan**]{.underline}, [would **outstrip the
losses** that the U.S. military has sustained in
**decades**]{.underline}. Short of all-out conflict, [to **mobilize for
dominance** and risk **escalation** on multiple such fronts would court
**several dangers**]{.underline}. [It would **overstretch the country**.
The U.S. defense budget now approaches **\$800 billion
annually**]{.underline}, not including deficit-financed military
operations. [This is a time of **ballooning deficits**]{.underline},
where the Congressional Budget Office warns that "[the prospect of
**large** and **growing debt** poses **substantial risks** for the
nation]{.underline}." If in such conditions, [**current expenditure** is
**not enough** to buy **unchallengeable military
preponderance**]{.underline}---and it may not be---then the failure lies
not in the failure to spend even more. Neither is the answer to
sacrifice the quality of civic life at home to service the cause of
preponderance abroad. [The old "two war standard," a planning construct
whereby the United States configures its forces to conduct two regional
conflicts at once, would be **unsustainably demanding**]{.underline}
against more than one peer competitor, or potentially with a roster of
major and minor adversaries all at once.28 After all, the purpose of
American military power is ultimately to secure a way of life as a
constitutional republic. To impose ever-greater debts on civil society
and strip back collective provision at home, on the basis that the
quality of life is expendable for the cause of hegemony, is perversely
to set up power-projection abroad as the end, when it should be the
means. [The problem lies]{.underline}, rather, [in the **inflexible
pursuit of hegemony itself**, and the failure to **balance commitments**
with **scarce resources.** To attempt to suppress **every adversary
simultaneously** would **drive adversaries together**, creating
**hostile coalitions**]{.underline}. It also may not succeed.
**[Counterproliferation]{.underline}** in North Korea is difficult
enough, for instance, but the task [becomes more difficult still if U.S.
enmity with China drives Beijing to **refuse cooperation**]{.underline}
over enforcing sanctions on Pyongyang. [Concurrent competitions would
also split **American resources**]{.underline}, attention and time.
[**Exacerbating** the **strain** on **scarce resources** between
**defense, consumption** and **investment** raises the **polarizing
question** of whether preponderance is **even worth it,** which then
**undermines the domestic** **consensus** needed to **support**
it]{.underline}. At the same time, [reduced investment in infrastructure
and education **would** damage the **economic foundations** for
**conducting competition abroad** in the **first place.**]{.underline}
Taken together, [**indiscriminate competition** risks creating the thing
**most feared** in traditional U.S. grand strategy: a **hostile Eurasian
alliance** leading to **continuous U.S. mobilization** against **hostile
coalitions**]{.underline}, turning the U.S. republic into an illiberal
garrison state. [If the prospect for the United States as a great power
faces a problem, it is not the **size of the defense budget**,
or]{.underline} the material weight of [**resources** at the U.S.
disposal, or **popular reluctance to exercise leadership**]{.underline}.
[**Rather**, the problem lies in the **scope of the policy** that those
capabilities are **designed to serve**]{.underline}. To make the problem
smaller, Washington should take steps to make the pool of adversaries
smaller.

**Pampinella, 2019** (Stephen Pampinella 19. Assistant Professor of
Political Science and International Relations at the State University of
New York (SUNY) at New Paltz, 1/23/19. "The Internationalist Disposition
and US Grand Strategy."
https://thedisorderofthings.com/2019/01/23/the-internationalist-disposition-and-us-grand-strategy/,
ADA-63)

But in recent weeks, establishment voices have sought to reassert their
control over foreign policy debates by arguing for the necessity of [[US
heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline} and classic liberal internationalist forms
of cooperation. Colás' methodological internationalism illustrates why
traditional US foreign policy approaches **[[will fail to
provide]{.mark} actual [security]{.mark}]{.underline}** for ordinary
Americans. It also suggests (somewhat counterintuitively) what kinds of
grand strategies could do so. A [[great power
concert]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy, in which the United States
pursues a balance of power among its rivals while committing to more
democratic forms of international cooperation, [[can **best**]{.mark}
**resolve**]{.underline} the non-state **[threats]{.underline}** to US
democracy generated by its own liberal order.

The New Internationalism of the American Left

Colás describes methodological internationalism as a focus on
macrostructural processes like capitalism or difference-based
hierarchies which transcend state borders and generate worldwide
categorical inequalities. We can contrast this perspective with
methodological nationalism, the idea that the main units of analysis in
world politics are nation-states. But rather than assume that
international relations (IR) is about neatly bounded sovereigns pursuing
their interests as autonomous actors, methodological internationalism
privileges networks of social relations that constitute subjectivities
in world politics. It refuses to accept that actors are constituted
prior to their interactions with others and recognizes that the
boundaries separating inside/outside are social constructs. What we see
in domestic politics, including various struggles against economic
exploitation and in defense of the environment and marginalized peoples,
are really foreign policy problems that simply manifest themselves in a
particular social context. This radical version of internationalism
suggests that [[resolving]{.mark} our societies' [problems]{.mark} will
[require establishing democratic control]{.mark} over global
processes]{.underline} on the basis of solidarity and respect for
difference.

The emerging discussion around progressive internationalism builds upon
this disposition. For example, Bernie Sanders and Yanis Varoufakis call
for a global movement to revive democracy and oppose growing
authoritarianism in the United States and Europe. Daniel Nexon argues
that progressive multilateralists and anti-hegemony leftists can form a
new foreign policy coalition that aims to lessen inequality through the
deconcentration of economic power. Heather Hurlburt demonstrates that
the United States can no longer pursue trade openness for the benefit of
capital at the expense of workers as a means of extending its influence
across the globe. All these ideas are consistent with methodological
internationalism. [[Given the **scale of transnational threats**]{.mark}
like inequalities produced by global capitalism and catastrophic climate
change, a [true]{.mark} progressive [internationalism would
prioritize]{.mark} intensive [cooperation]{.mark} with other state and
non-state actors to collectively regulate these global
processes]{.underline}. The purpose of national security policy, then,
would be to de-escalate great power competition as a means of enabling
economic and ecological security.

Why Liberal Internationalism Will Fail (Again)

But in recent weeks, mainstream US foreign policy experts have provided
their own spin in progressive internationalism.
[[Advocates]{.underline}]{.mark} and practitioners [[of]{.mark} a
[traditional heg]{.mark}emonic foreign policy]{.underline} have sought
to co-opt progressive internationalism in a series of essays which argue
for the necessity of American power and global influence. These writers
[[embody]{.mark} the post-Cold War centrist foreign policy coalition of
liberal internationalists and neocons]{.underline}ervatives. For them,
that the greatest threat to the democratic "free" world created by the
United States remains the autocratic governance model of Russia and
China. While Washington should pursue cooperation on transnational
governance issues where possible, they argue it cannot do so at the
expense of making security concessions which would reward revisionist
behavior by great power rivals. As in the past, [American
[exceptionalism]{.mark} remains the identity narrative justifying a
return to US hegemony]{.underline}, with Anglo-American norms serving as
the basis for hegemonic socialization and cooperation.

The internationalist disposition is a reminder of why a mere social
democratic twist on US [[heg]{.mark}emony]{.underline} will fail to
provide actual security for the United States and its allies.
[[Establishment]{.mark} voices continue to [rely on]{.mark}
state-centric [assumptions about IR and ignore how state identities and
interests are a function of their relationship with each
other.]{.mark}]{.underline} Or, as Jennifer Mitzen and Michelle Murray
might argue, [the [revisionist]{.mark} intentions of [Russia and China
are a **product of their**]{.mark} **ontological
[insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [A hegemonic
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [defending an
Anglo-American order [denies them]{.mark} recognition of their own great
power identities and [their right to participate in]{.mark}]{.underline}
all deliberations about [[global order]{.underline}]{.mark}. From this
perspective, [[we should challenge the]{.underline}]{.mark} implicit
[[assumption]{.underline}]{.mark} made by Anthony Blinken and Robert
Kagan [[that Russia is revisionist by nature]{.underline}]{.mark}. An
internationalist perspective suggests that [Russia has adopted those
intentions in relation to]{.underline} [a Wilsonian U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [which seeks domination over Moscow]{.underline}
and the transformation of its political system. [[The same]{.mark} is
true [for China]{.mark},]{.underline} which rejects being cast as a
"responsible stakeholder" by Washington which would eventually accept
democracy following its internal transformation by global capitalism. In
other words, the very terms of US relations with these states over the
past 25 years is the source of their revisionist intentions, and not
some essentialized feature of their domestic politics.

Further, a liberal exceptionalist narrative that contrasts "Eastern
autocracy" with "Western freedom" masks how [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has **perpetuated its own systems of illiberal
dominance throughout its history**]{.underline}. [Those same structures
of oppression are the greatest threat to contemporary US democracy and
also serve as glaring evidence of US hypocrisy]{.underline}. In his
defense of American exceptionalism, Jake Sullivan represents
institutional racism as a bug rather than a feature of the American
political system by emphasizing the liberal ideals of the Founders and
casting Donald Trump's white ethnonationalism as an aberration. But
[this telling of the American story whitewashes the long history of an
exclusive, white ethnic US identity]{.underline} dating back to the
early 19th Century and its role in generating the modern United States.
Scholars of American political development and US history have long
demonstrated that [institutions of slavery and land conquest constituted
US society and made possible its economic prosperity]{.underline} rather
than some kind of intrinsic tendency toward freedom.

Fast-forward to the present: liberal exceptionalism further denies how
[economic globalization made possible the rise of
**authoritarianism**]{.underline}. Nils Gilman and David Klion rightly
argue that the [kleptocratic alliance between autocrats and
oligarchs]{.underline} is the true threat to democracy and rule of law.
Their [ability to concentrate political and economic power has been
enabled by the emergence of an integrated global market that privileges
the freedom of capital over the needs of ordinary people, one **created
by the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates when liberal
internationalism went global after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Finally, [attempts to revive US hegemony will **doom transnational
efforts to deal with existential non-state threats**]{.underline}.
Hegemonists like Thomas Wright argue that Russia and China are the
greatest threat to the United States, and that Washington should never
make concessions to either power as a means of ensuring cooperation on
issues of global governance. However, "ring-fencing" global capitalism
and climate change as separate issues will fail to achieve the necessary
level of cooperation to cope with these threats. [National security
policymakers cannot recognize that the greatest dangers]{.underline}
faced by US citizens [are non-state economic and ecological global
processes that shape domestic politics]{.underline} from the inside-out,
[and **not rival sovereigns**]{.underline}. [Economic destitution to the
point of embracing fascist dictators coupled with environmental collapse
are]{.underline} near-certain [non-state threats which transcend our
boundaries]{.underline} -- in fact, [as a global power, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has been **complicit in
creating them**]{.underline}.

The internationalist disposition would suggest that the priorities of US
foreign policy must change. [[Regulating global
processes]{.underline}]{.mark} should be the primary objective, and it
[[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} that the United States pursue intense
[[macro]{.underline}]{.mark}-levels of [[cooperation with]{.mark} all
other states, **including**]{.underline} its
**[[rivals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to achieve them. Yet [it will be
unlikely to do so [if]{.mark} it remains]{.underline} wedded to liberal
hegemony and **[consumed by great power competition]{.underline}**.
[[Short-term incentives to accumulate]{.mark} resources and [power will
override the long-term need for global governance. The result will
be]{.mark} a world whose people live in precarity, **ravaged by [climate
change, and]{.mark} constantly on the verge of [great power
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

From "Disposition" to "Grand Strategy"

The internationalist disposition clearly illustrates why old US
strategies are incompatible with the progressive internationalism of the
US left. However, contra Colás, progressives should not avoid developing
of a positive vision for foreign policy due to the diverse range of
radical perspectives. To do so would cede pro-restraint arguments to
structural realist and libertarian advocates of offshore balancing who
offer no template for global engagement or institutional cooperation.
What progressives must do is articulate a grand strategy, or a plan that
mobilizes all elements of national power and influence, grounded in a
relationalist ontology that combines restraint with internationalism.
This strategy must be post-hegemonic (a term even Ikenberry has flirted
with), post-statist, and supportive of intense international cooperation
based on the diversity of identities and values otherwise ignored by the
universalist pretenses of Anglo-American liberalism. If our very
existence is mutually dependent on others, then we need a foreign policy
based on solidarity in response to collectively experienced threats.

I think there is a strategy consistent with the international
disposition: [[great power concert]{.underline}]{.mark}. A concert
strategy [[requires]{.mark} that all great powers pursue [mutual
accommodation and recognize each other's interests]{.mark} as part of a
larger commitment to maintain international stability]{.underline}.
Patrick Porter and Amitav Acharya argue that a [[great power
concert]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy [[is the best suited to adapt
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the transfer of wealth and power to Asia along
with [the "multiplex" nature of [world politics]{.mark}]{.underline}
(not to mention a global perspective on international relations). [The
emergence of a diverse range of state and non-state actors bound
together by extreme [interdependence makes it **impossible**
for]{.mark}]{.underline} any [[one actor]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [[to establish rules
for]{.mark} global governance which can mobilize [all
other]{.mark}s]{.underline}. On this basis[, a concert strategy would
lead the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to **collaborate with
others** on the basis of mutual co-existence and **embrace joint
decision-making** at the global level for coping with macrostructural
processes that threaten all peoples around the world]{.underline}. In
this way, a concert strategy is firmly grounded the international
disposition and can serve as the realization of progressive
internationalism.

Security and The Balance of Power

[[A concert strategy can]{.underline}]{.mark} do what establishment
foreign policy cannot, namely **[[de-escalate great power
competition]{.mark} by giving up US hegemony]{.underline}**. If adopted,
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would treat other great
powers, like Russia, China, and Iran, as **equal partners in the
maintenance of global stability** and incorporate their interests into
regional security agreements]{.underline}. [The]{.underline}
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would give up its
self-assumed role as an unrivaled global hegemon]{.underline} [and seek
a balance of power based on mutual respect with other great powers as
partners]{.underline} rather than enemies. This kind of international
posture would result in a more horizontal great power system, one that
Stacie Goddard as identified as being productive of status quo rather
than revisionist intentions. [[It would]{.underline}]{.mark} be
compatible with recognition of the great power identities of other
states and [[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} them with [**[ontological
security]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### Global governance is a pre-req to solve existential risks of emerging tech, pandemics, and war brought about by automation 

**Bailey, 2018** (Robert Bailey, professional technologist and strategic
manager who has led initiatives to improve the delivery of civic
services in major North American cities, Master of Science Degree in
Computer science, 9/5/18. "Why do we need global governance?"
https://www.visionofearth.org/social-change/global-governance/, ADA-64)

[[Global governance is necessary because]{.mark} humanity increasingly
faces both [problems]{.mark} and opportunities [that are]{.mark} global
in scale]{.underline}. Today, [[transnational]{.mark} problems such as
violence and pandemics]{.underline} routinely **[reach across
borders]{.underline}**, affecting us all. At the same time,
[the]{.underline} increasingly [[integrated global system has]{.mark}
also [laid the necessary foundations for peace]{.mark} and spectacular
prosperity]{.underline}. [[Effective global governance will allow us to
end armed conflict, deal with]{.mark} new and emerging problems such as
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological [risks and automation]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} to [achieve]{.mark} levels of [prosperity and
progress]{.mark} never before seen]{.underline}.1

[[The most important challenge]{.mark} for humanity to overcome
[is]{.mark} that of **[existential risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One way
to look at the danger of an existential risk is to quantify the level of
global coordination needed to deal with it. While best-shot risks, at
one end of the spectrum only require that a single nation, organization
or even individual (i.e., superhero) has the means and the will to save
everyone, weakest-link risks, at the other end of the spectrum, are
dangers that might require literally every country to take appropriate
action to prevent catastrophe, with no room for failure.2 3

[We've always been at risk of natural disaster, but with advances in our
level of technology the risk we pose to ourselves as a species becomes
ever greater]{.underline}. [[Nuclear weapons]{.mark} are a well-known
risk that we still live with]{.underline} to this day. The progress of
[tech]{.underline}nological [research exposes us to new dangers such as
[**bioengineered superbugs**,]{.mark}
**[nanotech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nological menaces, [and the risk of an
out-of-control [a]{.mark}]{.underline}rtificial
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence [with ill-intent]{.underline}.
[Increased]{.underline} levels of [[global coordination are needed to
combat]{.mark}]{.underline} many of [[these]{.underline}]{.mark} risks,
as described in our article on the cooperation possibilities frontier.

There are other problems that don't necessarily threaten the species or
even civilization as we know it, but which are holding back the
development of prosperity and progress. Armed conflict, around since the
dawn of history, still haunts us today. Even though wars between great
powers appear to be a thing of the past, [regional conflicts still
account for tremendous human suffering and loss of life]{.underline} in
parts of the world without stable governance.4

Other problems have emerged precisely because of our successes in the
past. The unprecedented advancement of human wellbeing and prosperity
over the past century has been based in large part on the use of fossil
fuels, thus exposing us to climate change. [Widespread
[automation]{.mark}]{.underline}, already a stressor on society, [[will
put increased pressure on the]{.mark} social and economic [fabric of our
societies]{.mark}]{.underline} over the next few decades. [[Global
governance can help **alleviate these issues**]{.underline}]{.mark} in
various ways -- we refer the interested reader to the very detailed work
in Ruling Ourselves.

Finally, global governance will increasingly be judged not only by the
extent to which it prevents harm, but also by its demonstrated ability
to improve human wellbeing.5 Progress has let us set our sights higher
as a species, both for what we consider to be the right trajectory for
humanity and for our own conduct.6 Major advances in human wellbeing can
be accomplished with existing technology and modest improvements in
global coordination.

[Effective [global governance]{.mark}]{.underline} is global governance
that **[[tackles these issues better than the regional governments of
the world]{.mark} can independently]{.underline}**. [Global governance
is key to solving global problems. [Without it, we **may not be able to
avoid weakest-link existential risks**]{.mark} or regulate new and
dangerous tech]{.underline}nologies. [With it, we may be able to prosper
as we never have befor]{.underline}e. The next step is to determine how
effective global governance can be achieved.

[[US-Russia talks]{.mark} in Saudi Arabia and the Trump-Putin phone call
[signal]{.mark} a possible negotiation for peace in Ukraine and new
[opportunities for]{.mark} the countries\' [relations,]{.mark} including
[in the Arctic region.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The Arctic]{.underline}, warming four times faster than the rest of the
world, [may be the key region for the US and Russia to advance
cooperation]{.underline}. [[US-Russia rapprochement may]{.mark} broadly
[benefit]{.mark} the world by bringing an end to the disastrous war in
Ukraine and reducing the risk of nuclear war, but existential
[environmental issues]{.mark} still demand attention]{.underline}.

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the \'canary in the coal mine\' for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, [Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region as
a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: \'We need to pursue joint
projects, including, for example, in the Arctic]{.underline}.\' **[The
Arctic region makes sense as a setting for cooperation as [the two sides
have explicitly expressed interest in exploring cooperation in energy,
investment, and geopolitical issues]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Western
sanctions on Russia have led Moscow to step up its cooperation in the
Arctic with China in joint energy ventures and grand plans for Arctic
shipping. **[US officials now see Arctic cooperation as a potential
means to \'drive a wedge\' between Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}**.

[In my meetings in Moscow with American and Russian
diplomats]{.underline} and ~~businessmen~~ \[businesspeople\]over the
past few weeks[, it is clear that many are interested in diverse forms
of Arctic cooperation]{.underline}, from cultural diplomacy that
celebrates the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the
Bering Strait, to scientific diplomacy to understand and adapt to
climate hazards faced by both nations. Business interests, however, are
at the top of the agenda.

Trump\'s suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump\'s threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump\'s statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump\'s plan \'can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region.\'

Together with Trump\'s desire to acquire Ukraine\'s resources and reduce
the US\' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump\'s political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin\'s
offer to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the
US may also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships \'all over the
place\' near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition
in Trump\'s Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

[The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the countries\' diplomatic missions will significantly reduce the
current obstacles to US-Russia scientific cooperation in the Arctic. By
making it easier to issue visas and travel between the two countries,
[Americans and Russians will]{.mark} again [be able to conduct joint
research,]{.mark} expeditions, and scientific conferences [and build
models to better]{.mark} [understand the]{.mark} unfolding
[climate]{.mark} emergency. Scientific cooperation to understand the
[changes]{.mark} affecting sea [ice, permafrost, ecosystems]{.mark}, and
local communities has been blunted by the political fallout of the war
in Ukraine.]{.underline}

**[[Cooperation in the Arctic can help build regional stability]{.mark}.

Russia that could complement or spill over [into]{.mark} other crucial
fields of cooperation such as [arms control]{.mark}, Middle East peace,
[and global health.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

4\. Diplomatic efforts and international governance

[Due to the soft power strategy, Arctic governance has created [the
Arctic Council]{.mark} as a model of inclusiveness and high-level
intergovernmental forum, where science diplomacy [has played a pivotal
role in promoting cooperation]{.mark}, coordination, and interaction
among circumpolar states [on issues of common concern, including]{.mark}
those relating to sustainable [development and environmental
protection]{.mark}]{.underline}. The council brings together the eight
Arctic member states, organizations representing the region's native
peoples, and several observer states and organizations, including China.
\[24\] [The Arctic Council]{.underline} was officially established in
1996 under the terms of the Ottawa Declaration, whose signatories were
Canada, Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), the U.S.,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden. It [cannot deal with
military and sovereignty issues (which are excluded from its field of
competence) to]{.underline} concentrate discussions on subjects that can
more easily be the subject of consensus such as scientific cooperation,
environmental protection, well-being and economic development of
indigenous populations, safety of navigation, etc. Much of the Arctic
Council's work focuses on scientific and technical topics that are
studied in thematic working groups. \[25\]

Outside the Arctic Council, there are a multitude of official
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, whose purpose is to
manage various issues in the Arctic; The Arctic Circle is an
organization established by Iceland on 15 April 2013. Its mission is to
facilitate dialogue between political leaders, business leaders,
environmental experts, scientists, indigenous representatives and other
international stakeholders on issues related to the Arctic. The four
Arctic states located in Europe (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden)
and Iceland, which has strong historical ties to Europe, are known as
the "Nordic countries". Much of the cooperation between these states
relates to issues they have in common with Western Russia, the Baltic
and Barents Sea regions and the greater Nordic region, including
international waters. In addition to those organizations, six other
organizations representing Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have
permanent participant status. \[26\]

There are also non-Arctic countries that have been granted observer
status, such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, France, Spain,
Italy, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland.
This is in addition to many other international organizations such as
the UN through some of its programs related to environment and
development. European and Asian countries have shown their interests and
responsibilities in a strategy document on the Arctic. The EU adopted an
integrated policy on the Arctic zone in 2016 and is currently
considering updating these guidelines. Asian states' ongoing research
agendas and scientific cooperation have made their engagement crucial
for the development of Arctic knowledge. Japan and South Korea launched
the construction of an icebreaker for scientific purposes, to be
deployed in 2026. \[27\]

**[There is no doubt that the war in Ukraine has made cooperation and
diplomacy in the Arctic more difficult. However, [the U.S. can expect
Russia to remain open to peaceful discussions]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
[Even at the]{.underline}]{.mark} [height of the [Cold War, the Soviet
Union cooperated with the West on Arctic issues]{.mark}, including
initiatives such as the 1973 Convention on the Conservation of Polar
Bears]{.underline} \[28\] [and the 1987 Murmansk Initiative toward
regional cooperation, recognizing the special responsibilities and
special interests of the States of the Arctic Region in relation to the
protection of the fauna and flora of the Arctic Region and recognizing
that the polar bear is a significant resource of the Arctic Region that
requires additional protection.]{.underline}

**[To manage the escalating tensions in the Arctic, [states must strike
a balance]{.mark} between cooperation and strategic rivalry [through
bilateral and international diplomacy]{.mark}. Important Arctic nations
like the U.S. and Russia hold bilateral discussions [to lower the
likelihood of armed conflict]{.mark}, frequently concentrating on
[keeping lines of communication open]{.mark} about security-related
issues.]{.underline}** Despite the modest progress made in these
discussions, [they are nonetheless crucial for defusing any
confrontations considering the Arctic's growing
militarization.]{.underline} [Security matters are noticeably missing
from multilateral institutions like the Arctic Council, which offers all
Arctic nations a diplomatic forum to debate environmental, economic, and
indigenous issues]{.underline}.

Despite the current high tensions and given the potential for mutual
destruction, [[Russia and NATO share an interest in maintaining peace in
the Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark} in [addition to diplomatic
frameworks that provide legal channels for settling competing claims to
seabed resources]{.underline}, such as the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \[29[\] NATO's attempts to coordinate
security plans among its Arctic member states, strengthening regional
stability, are another example of multilateral diplomacy in
action]{.underline}. Although these diplomatic efforts aid in the
management of tensions, they frequently fail to address the more serious
security threats brought on by military buildups and geopolitical
rivalry in the Arctic. \[30\]

Conclusion

[With rivalry for resources, vital shipping lanes, and military
supremacy driving war, the Arctic is quickly changing into a disputed
geopolitical region. Global powers like China, the U.S., and Russia are
vying for control of the region because of the melting ice, which has
made it more accessible for economic exploitation. Territorial claims
overlap when states bolster their military presence, raising the
possibility of error or conflict. The Arctic runs the risk of turning
into a hot spot for future hostilities in the absence of defined methods
to handle these tensions]{.underline}.

**[There is an urgent need for more international [collaboration]{.mark}
to [stop this escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Although the UNCLOS
and the Arctic Council have facilitated communication, they are
ill-equipped to handle the region's growing security
concerns]{.underline}. **[Redoubled [efforts should concentrate on
broadening diplomatic channels]{.mark} to cover security and military
matters, setting up a platform for Arctic countries to discuss weapons
control and developing guidelines for military behavior]{.underline}**.
[The moment has come for Arctic countries to engage in **formalized
diplomatic discussion** that covers military and security
matters]{.underline}. [[Whether **through** a distinct treaty or **the
Arctic Council, a new global security framework**]{.mark} **might [offer
a forum for]{.mark} controlling the military buildup,
[negotiating]{.mark} arms control measures, and defining explicit rules
of engagement** to avoid unintentional conflicts]{.underline}. [**In
addition to [lowering the likelihood of violence]{.mark}, this would
establish a crisis management system in the Arctic**. International
organizations must also mediate conflicts and make sure that competition
in the Arctic doesn't jeopardize indigenous rights or the sustainability
of the environment. In the face of mounting global pressure, the Arctic
can only continue to be a region of harmony, collaboration, and shared
wealth via concerted effort.]{.underline}

#### Russia willing to cooperate with the US- mutual Arctic interests

There is nowhere in the world that is changing faster than in the
Arctic, as climate change has rapidly reduced sea ice cover. Now, a
region that once was covered in ice most of the year is accessible for
human habitation, travel, and exploitation. The [US and Russia]{.mark}
share a maritime border along the Bering Strait and around the Arctic
Ocean. [They both [share an interest]{.mark} [in]{.mark} continued
[cooperation]{.mark} [on]{.mark} safeguarding [Arctic]{.mark} waters,
ensuring that they can become economically beneficial for all parties,
while also pursuing mutually beneficial research and preserving the
environment]{.underline}. Greater cooperation in the Arctic can also
mitigate the risks of an "Arctic arms race" between NATO nations and
Russia, turning the region into a potential venue for conflict and
competition. [**[Putin]{.mark} has already [signaled]{.mark}** a
**[willingness to meet with]{.mark} President [Trump]{.mark}** at a
summit [on Arctic issues]{.mark};]{.underline} the Trump administration
should make the most of this opportunity. As the ice melts, previously
inaccessible hydrocarbons can now more feasibly be extracted by offshore
drilling rigs, but this raises the risk of an oil spill. [The
[US]{.mark} [and Russia share an interest in preventing oil
spills]{.mark} and in continuing to expand their capacity to work
together effectively]{.underline} under the auspices of Article 13 in
the Arctic Council's 2013 "Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil
Pollution Preparedness and Response in the Arctic." [[Oil spills
would]{.mark} have negative effects on Arctic fish stocks, research, and
shipping that would [damage]{.mark} the [interests]{.mark} [of
all]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark} [nations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Potential
research breakthroughs in the fields of environmental science, biology,
and ecology can be lost forever due to oil spills; transnational fish
stocks can be damaged or made poisonous to consume, and maritime travel
through oil spills is dangerous. Article 13, Section 1 of the Agreement
on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution states that, "The
[[Parties]{.mark} shall [promote]{.mark} [cooperation]{.mark} and
coordination by endeavoring [to carry out joint
exercise]{.mark}s]{.underline} and training, including alerting or
call-out exercises, table-top exercises, equipment deployment exercises,
and other relevant activities." [Building [interoperability]{.mark}
between US and Russian disaster response groups [can build trust]{.mark}
by increasing intergovernmental contact and potentially limit the
damage]{.underline} of future oil spills by improving international
response times and procedures. [Sharing best-practices and specific
technologies can prevent oil spills in the future from ever
occurring,]{.underline} and a framework for doing so has already been
developed by the Arctic Council. [[The apolitical]{.mark} and largely
civilian [nature]{.mark} of preventing and responding to oil spills
[makes **cooperation o**]{.mark}**n this issue [attractive]{.mark}** and
unlikely to be targeted by domestic politics in either
country.]{.underline} The main risk associated with this plan comes from
the potential export of specific technologies meant to prevent oil
spills from occurring. There is a chance that certain technologies would
also increase Russia's capacity to exploit offshore hydrocarbons, which
would undermine one aspect of current US and EU sanctions against
Russia. The provision of technology is not required to improve
prevention and response capabilities between the US and Russia. If there
are not any technologies that could be exported without undermining
other US foreign policy objections, that provision can be safely ignored
without making cooperation useless.

Previously thought of as a frozen landscape of interest only to
scientists, [the Arctic has increasingly garnered the attention of the
international community]{.underline}. Climate change has seen on average
rise in global temperatures of 0.0 degrees Celsius in the past 140
years. [In the Arctic]{.underline}, however, [temperatures have risen
twice that of the global average due to a reinforcing feedback loop
called "Arctic amplification]{.underline}," where more dark-colored
seawater absorbs heat, and in turn, melts more ice. In the past fifty
years, Arctic sea ice has shrunk to about half its original size. While
scientists do not yet agree on the exact timeline of the melt, it is
estimated that within fifteen to thirty years, parts of the Arctic will
be ice-free for significant durations annually.

[For the littoral Arctic states---Canada, Finland, Iceland, the Kingdom
of Denmark, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States---this melt
brings the potential of accessing previously inaccessible
resources]{.underline}. It is estimated that a fifth of the world's
hydrocarbons is locked under the Arctic ice. Beyond hydrocarbons, a
melted Arctic would also bring additional sources of fish; minerals;
metals; and hydro, wind, geothermal, tidal, and solar power. On the
other hand, [the reduction of the natural barrier formed by the ice is a
security threat. The Arctic states, therefore, all have distinct
interests in maintaining trade routes, resource development, sea ice
claims, and regional stability]{.underline} (see figure 1, page 82).

[Other non-Arctic states---China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan,
the Netherlands, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and
the United Kingdom---have all declared interest in the region and joined
the Arctic Council as permanent observers]{.underline}. For them, the
most important development is arguably the potential viability of new
waterways through the Arctic as the ice melts. If fully opened, the
Transpolar Sea Route, Northern Sea Route, and the Northwest Passage can
significantly cut shipping times from Europe to Asia. Furthermore,
without the canal limitations of traditional shipping routes, bigger
cargo ships can provide greater economies of scale each trip.
Underwater, the access to more ocean floor means more fiber-optic cables
can be laid, making telecommunications more efficient and reliable. [As
many of these non-Arctic states are beneficiaries of the traditional
trade routes, the potential disruption in trade caused by the melting
Arctic is possibly an existential threat]{.underline}. Beyond trade
routes, many of these states are also highly keen on gaining access to
the potential resources in the Arctic.

[Other non-Arctic states---China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan,

states are also highly keen on gaining access to the potential resources
in the Arctic.

Against this backdrop, multiple Arctic and non-Arctic states are making
moves to gain an edge, or even hegemony, before the ice fully melts.
Thus, the question of whether the regional governance should be
restricted locally or expanded globally is an important one. To this
end, **[the authors argue that as the environmental, economic, and
security impacts of the Arctic are global in nature, its governance
should be correspondingly global]{.underline}**. Hence, [as both an
Arctic state and the largest economy in the world]{.underline}, **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[should take the lead
in fostering international cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline}**.

#### Russia will cooperate effectively -- most qualified experts prove

**Thai News Service 25** \["Russia: Cooperation between Russia, US in
Arctic May be Maximum Effective," pg. Lexis, ALB\]

[The joint implementation of projects in the Arctic]{.underline} [by
Russia and the United States]{.underline} **[may be a most effective
area in cooperation between the countries]{.underline}**, in particular,
not only in hydrocarbons extraction, but also in development of the
Northern Sea Route and making the Northern Air Bridge, Alexey [Fadeev,
Doctor of Economics, Deputy Chairman of the Public Council at St.
Petersburg\'s Committee on Arctic Affairs, told TASS]{.underline}.

[Earlier, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Kirill
Dmitriev, said in an interview with the Politico that Russia and the
United States during a meeting in Saudi Arabia discussed possible joint
projects in the Arctic]{.underline}.

\"**[Russia has always been open to cooperation with international
partners. The Arctic is exactly the area where cooperation may be most
effective]{.underline}**. Its hydrocarbon potential\'s development is a
possible area for agreements between the US and Russia. The United
States has significant experience in developing both offshore fields in
the Gulf of Mexico and shallow-water fields in the Beaufort Sea in
Alaska. The transfer of effective organizational, economic,
environmental experience and knowledge would be useful for both sides,\"
Alexey Fadeev said.

In 2012, Russia began cooperation with the United States in this area,
he continued. In 2012, Rosneft signed agreements with ExxonMobil and
General Electric, and they discovered the Pobeda field in the Kara Sea,
but in 2014, due to complicated Russian-American relations, the
cooperation was frozen, and ExxonMobil was forced to quit the project.

Transport and logistics links

[Transport and logistics may be another area of cooperation between
Russia and the US in the Arctic]{.underline}. \"[The Northern Sea Route
is a true alternative to existing global solutions]{.underline}. It may
be used to ship goods from the West to the East and back, including
liquefied natural gas, which over recent years the US has been
developing actively. In addition, some 20 years ago, in the 2000s, quite
popular was the Northern Air Bridge project of cross-polar flights from
Southeast Asia crossing the Arctic towards North America,\" the expert
said.

The air route through the Arctic cuts flight time, where long distances
between continents may be covered within 10 hours. One of the global
problems that hindered this project was the necessary substantial cargo
base - such a flight\'s load should be at least 80-85% to be profitable.
The two countries could solve this task, and the airports on the route
could develop into major transport hubs.

Ecology of high latitudes

No less important than economic projects in the Arctic remain the
environmental consequences of developing high altitude areas, the expert
continued. The US and Russia are members of the Arctic Council, which
features also Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark represented by Greenland,
Iceland and Canada. Russia\'s cooperation with that organization has
hardly been full-fledged in recent years. Despite their political
differences, those countries are collectively responsible for the region
in terms of the environmental agenda, since the changing Arctic climate
can change the climate of the entire planet. Major powers, such as
Russia and the United States, have all the necessary knowledge and
technology to preserve the fragile Arctic ecosystem.

[\"The Arctic is no longer a territory of heroism]{.underline}. **[It is
a promising economic zone with opportunities for international
cooperation in various areas]{.underline}**. [Both Russia and the US
have interests also in the military-industrial complex in the
region]{.underline}, as well as in the extraction of biological
resources, aquaculture, and in the transport sector development. **[The
Arctic is becoming a truly inhabited territory with a high prospect of
development through joint efforts]{.underline}**,\" the expert said in
conclusion.

**Russia will cooperate to ensure stability**

**Thai News Service 25** \["Russia/United States: Russia open to
cooperation with US to ensure security in Arctic embassy," pg. Lexis,
ALB\]

[Russia is open to cooperation with the United States on ensuring
stability in the Arctic region]{.underline}, Russia\'s embassy in
Denmark told Izvestiya.

\"[Russia assumes that security in the Arctic should be built by joint
efforts of countries of the region through dialogue and cooperation.
Russia is open to cooperation with the US on a mutually beneficial basis
in the interests of ensuring stability and sustainable development of
the Arctic]{.underline},\" the embassy said amid reports of a visit by
the American delegation to Greenland.

Russian President Vladimir [Putin said earlier this week that he is
convinced that the United States would keep promoting its military,
political and economic interests in the Arctic Region]{.underline}. The
president also commented on Washington\'s plans to gain control over
Greenland, noting that it was a matter for the two sovereign states
Denmark and the United States - to decide. It \"has no relation\" to
Russia, Putin added.

#### Russia will cooperate despite military build up

**Anadolu 25** \[Anadolu = news service, "Russia plans Arctic military
buildup, eyes cooperation with West," pg. lexis, ALB\]

\"[The number of Russian military personnel in the Arctic will
grow]{.underline},\" Putin said, adding that Russia will develop new
shipyards and acquire both domestic and foreign-built vessels to support
Arctic trade routes.

[Despite Western sanctions and tensions, he expressed his readiness for
cooperation]{.underline}.

\"[We are open to joint work not only with Arctic nations but with all
who share responsibility for a stable future of the
planet]{.underline},\" he said.

#### Trump de-escalates US-Russia tensions

Relations and Its Possible Prospects; March 14, 2025;

[What]{.underline}, then, [are the prospects for US-Russia relations
this time?]{.underline} Will the two nations repeat the cycle of past
failures, or will they break free from this seemingly fatalistic
pattern? [This latest shift]{.underline} in US-Russia relations [differs
from previous ones]{.underline} in several important ways, the most
notable being that [it has alleviated some of the persistent
contradictions that have plagued the bilateral relationship]{.underline}
since the Cold War. Over the past 30 years, [[NATO's eastward expansion
has been the most significant obstacle in US-Russia
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia vehemently opposes NATO's
expansion, viewing it as a strategic security threat, while NATO insists
on continuing its enlargement. This has created an insurmountable
barrier to improving US-Russian relations. The United States has been
the primary driver of NATO's expansion, often taking a more aggressive
stance than Europe. At the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, it was
President George W. Bush who pushed for Ukraine and Georgia to join the
alliance, a move only thwarted by opposition from German Chancellor
Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Now, the
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [has [made it clear that
Ukraine is unlikely to join NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} in the near
future, effectively ruling out the possibility. While this does not
fundamentally resolve the issue, it marks a significant shift. Russia
insists on formal guarantees at the level of international law, which it
wants included in any final peace treaty. The process of Ukraine's
accession to NATO has been ongoing since the 2008 Bucharest summit, and
at the February 2025 Washington Summit commemorating NATO's 75th
anniversary, it was declared that Ukraine's path to membership was
"irreversible." From Russia's perspective, these political positions
must be formally corrected. In any case, [[the]{.mark} new US [policy
has significantly eased tensions between Russia and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, [raising hopes of removing one of the most
contentious issues in their relationship]{.underline}. If Ukraine were
to join a European-oriented military alliance in the future, the
resulting conflict would primarily involve Russia and Europe, not Russia
and the United States. Should NATO continue to fragment and weaken, or
even disintegrate, the issue of NATO enlargement would naturally
disappear from the US-Russia agenda. Security issues have always been
central to US-Russia relations. The US has long viewed Russia as a
security threat and adversary, a stance enshrined in official strategy
documents, including the National Security Strategy (2017) and the
National Defense Strategy (2018) during Trump's first term, as well as
the 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance and the 2022
National Defense Strategy Report under Biden. Since his return to
office, however, [[Trump]{.underline}'s]{.mark} perspective has shifted.
He now [[downplays Russia's security threat]{.mark} to the United
States]{.underline}, viewing Russia primarily as a threat to Europe.
America's new Secretary of Defense, Pete [[Hegseth]{.underline}]{.mark},
speaking at a meeting of the Ukrainian Defense Contact Group in December
2024, [[stated]{.mark} that the [US security]{.mark} focus [would shift
from Europe to the Asia-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}, with Europe taking
primary responsibility for its own security. This indicates that while
the Trump administration has not yet formally redefined Russia's
security threat, the trend is clear: [Russia's perceived threat to the
US has diminished]{.underline}. If the Russia-Ukraine conflict can be
resolved through a peace agreement, it would further reinforce this
shift. Although both China and Russia are officially defined as security
threats by the US, China is considered a "comprehensive and persistent
threat," while Russia is seen as an "acute threat," largely due to the
ongoing war in Ukraine. Should the war end, Russia's perceived threat
level would likely decrease further. To a certain extent, [[Trump has
moved away from value-based diplomacy]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
traditional pillar of American liberal foreign policy and [[a major
source of tension]{.underline}]{.mark} in US-Russia relations.
Value-based diplomacy is fundamentally incompatible with Russia's
diplomatic philosophy, leading to ideological and policy clashes between
the two nations. The US often divides the world based on ideology,
transcends international law, and interferes in other countries'
internal affairs under the guise of promoting democracy, even
orchestrating "color revolutions" to legitimize the overthrow of
governments. It is important to note that value-based diplomacy is not
purely ideological; it is also driven by geopolitical interests. The
regimes targeted by "color revolutions" are often those disliked by the
West, while the new governments that emerge are typically pro-Western.
The West has labeled Russia an authoritarian state, opposing its values
and branding it an "outcast" in the global political moral system. This
has created an invisible barrier between the West and Russia.
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [is]{.underline} notoriously
[[dismissive of ideology in favor of practical interests]{.underline}.
[He is willing to engage]{.underline}]{.mark} with any country [[for
mutual benefit]{.underline}]{.mark} and will not hesitate to confront
any nation, regardless of its ideology, if interests conflict. In doing
so, Trump has at least reduced the impact of ideological factors on
US-Russia relations. Since Trump's return to office, [there is a
possibility that Russia and the United States could restart strategic
arms reduction negotiations.]{.underline} Nuclear arms control has long
been a cornerstone of US-Russia security relations. The New START Treaty
is set to expire in February 2026. Given the ongoing Russia-Ukraine
conflict, negotiations on a new treaty have been stalled. If Russia and
the US can resume talks and reach a new agreement, it would have a
significant positive impact on easing tensions between the two nations.

[Accurate threat assessment is vital]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the
formulation of [foreign policy]{.underline}. Across centuries of
political and technological change, the giants of strategy---from
Sun-tzu and Thucydides to Carl von Clausewitz and George Kennan---warned
against exaggerating threats and ignoring their geopolitical context.
Still, ideologically driven [[threat
inflation]{.underline}]{.mark}---from a phantom Vietnamese attack in the
Gulf of Tonkin to nonexistent Iraqi nuclear and chemical
weapons---[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} repeatedly [[led the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[into costly
quagmires]{.mark}.]{.underline} Despite this history, [[the country
is]{.mark} again [on the brink of]{.mark} a]{.underline}n ideologically
driven [[blunder]{.underline}]{.mark}---this time [[in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. For over a decade, [defense hawks have been
sounding an alarm over Russia]{.underline}'s supposed military
superiority and incipient aggression [in the region]{.underline}.
Previous U.S. presidents resisted the bait, avoiding confrontation and
embracing cooperation through the multinational Arctic Council
established after the end of the Cold War. They knew that Russia's
forces in the region were defensively structured and weaker than they
were before the Soviet collapse in 1991, despite efforts to rebuild them
that began in the mid-2000s. Previous U.S. presidents also knew that
[U.S. and NATO forces had the clear upper hand in the Arctic and that
[predictions of Russian aggression were]{.mark} mainly
[threat-mongering]{.mark}]{.underline} by armchair analysts and vested
political interests. [But]{.underline} the administration of U.S.
President Donald [[Trump has]{.underline}]{.mark} recently [[embraced
Arctic alarmism]{.mark} with a vengeance]{.underline}. [It has stoked
fears of Russian]{.underline} and Chinese "[aggression]{.underline},"
trashed the Arctic Council's delicate diplomacy, and adopted a new
confrontational posture. In so doing, [it joins the alarmists in three
serious mistakes]{.underline}: [the failure to assess]{.underline}
specific [threats accurately]{.underline}, the failure [to consider an
adversary's forces in relation to those of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its allies, [and the failure to evaluate
the]{.underline} broader strategic [landscape]{.underline}---the
political, economic, and environmental factors [beyond the
battlefield]{.underline}. [Violation of]{.underline} [these]{.underline}
three pillars of careful threat assessment [is drawing the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [toward]{.underline} an
unnecessary [confrontation]{.underline} in a region where the real enemy
isn't Cold War ghosts but looming environmental disaster. ... Blind to
looming disaster, Trump's desire to dominate an Arctic endowed with
endless U.S. oil brings to mind a crusader from the Middle Ages who,
while seeking to export his faith on a journey of conquest, unwittingly
imports a plague that devastates his own country. This is no casual
metaphor. Scientists have long warned about the dangers of disease in a
warming Arctic and traced recent anthrax outbreaks to spores from the
thawing carcasses of long-frozen animals. Virologists have "awakened"
dormant viruses from the permafrost, and biologists are charting the
warming-fueled spread of disease in Arctic fish and mammals. The
collapse of key species or the spread of disease between species,
including humans, could make the Arctic the source of the next global
pandemic. In the face of all this, [[bromides]{.underline}]{.mark} from
analysts such as Heather Conley [[that]{.mark} "the country that
controls [the Arctic controls the world" are]{.mark}]{.underline}
extremely [[shortsighted]{.underline}]{.mark}. Climate-driven crises
upend traditional notions of political-military control. **[[The looming
catastrophe can be managed only cooperatively]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Thirty years ago, as the United States and the Soviet Union ended the
Cold War and pondered how to eliminate chemical weapons, U.S. Secretary
of State James Baker proposed disposing of them "somewhere in the
Arctic." Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev replied: "That would be even
worse" because, in the Arctic, "the ecological balance cannot be
disturbed under any circumstances." [Let]{.underline} the
[wisdom]{.underline} of their predecessors **[guide today's leaders in
[halt]{.mark}ing [an]{.mark} incipient [Arctic arms race that can only
hasten global catastrophe.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The recent sixth assessment report of the IPCC from 2023 states that
[decisions being made in this decade may affect the Earth for
millennia]{.underline}28. [In this perspective losing vital climate
research data]{.underline} might [weaken]{.underline} [the
knowledge]{.underline} basis [for appropriate policy
decisions]{.underline}. This adds to the crisis the war itself has
created. **[One effect of the lack of research cooperation is increased
uncertainty]{.underline}**. It is difficult to understand and or verify
data of climate gas emissions (e.g., methane) and permafrost melting
from Russian territory without reliable field work. [Satellites can
provide some information but less]{.underline} so [in the long dark
season]{.underline} of the Northern Hemisphere. [[Even
though]{.underline}]{.mark} previous [[Russian data were]{.mark}
[incomplete]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline} sometimes
[unreliable]{.underline}, and although technology provide some
information, [[the loss]{.mark} of data and know-how [is a set-back for
understanding]{.mark} various [climate]{.mark} mechanisms.]{.underline}
The thawing of permafrost has increasingly been addressed by climate
researchers. And methane and black carbon emissions were among focus
areas for more ambitious mitigation goals during the Russian
chairmanship of the Arctic Council[. Scientists have increasingly better
methods for measuring gas]{.underline} that emerges [from the
permafros]{.underline}t as the temperature in the Arctic rises. [Large
volumes of [methane are released]{.mark}]{.underline} directly into the
atmosphere, [but scientists don't know how much is emitted [from the
vast areas of Siberia]{.mark}, and how this has changed and could change
over time.]{.underline} The thawing of permafrost in Svalbard is already
dramatic and goes deeper than previously anticipated, resulting e.g., in
release of methane and carbon dioxide gas to the atmosphere. [The
observed]{.underline} methane [emissions are surprising]{.underline}
scientists [as the volume is much higher than anticipated]{.underline}.
[To get the full-scale]{.underline} picture these [data should be

partners]{.underline}. The war has not only led to loss of data, but
also to a loss of knowledge and competence. New data shows that much of
the methane emissions are biology-driven and in need of new
methodologies, being a field where Russian scientists have high
expertise. [Western scientists can build up competence and collaborate
with other scientific communities.]{.underline} But the Russian know-how
in combination with the proximity to the Siberian system gives them an
advantage. The permafrost in Svalbard is in some aspects different from
the permafrost in the Canadian and the Siberian Arctic, and a major
piece of the puzzle is now lacking29. [[Not long-ago Russian experts
were close partners, now they don't even respond to emails
anymore]{.mark},]{.underline} says Lise Øvreås, Professor, University of
Bergen30. [However, some data from Russia,]{.underline} relevant for
understanding the systemic changes ongoing in the Arctic, [is still
crossing borders.]{.underline} The World Meteorological Organisation, a
UN body, still collect data from Russia. Meteorological data are
necessary for short term weather forecasts, but they are also central
for assessing and understanding climate change31. 2.5.2. [Ocean related

north-flowing ocean currents transport the warm and salty waters of the
Atlantic into the Arctic Ocean through the Barents Sea[. Warming of the
Barents Sea [have already shown effects]{.mark} on sea ice and marine
ecosystems]{.underline}32. The extent of Atlantification and its
possible impact on the wildlife that follow ocean currents are active
areas of research. [[The data needed to monitor this development are

the region for a long time. [A major recent venture into arctic waters

would never have been possible under the current situation as Russia was
the institute's main partner for logistics and change of personnel. The
Russian support allowed this expedition to continue even during the
Covid pandemic. A[n international project]{.underline} of this scale
[would be impossible in the Arctic today. Some]{.underline} experts [are
however less worried about severe direct effects on ocean science.
Research on the Arctic Ocean can still be conducted in large parts of
the Arctic.]{.underline} Collaboration with Russian scientists was often
not effective as Russian scientists would publish their results in
Russian language journals and did not always share all relevant data. In
addition, expeditions into Russian waters could in many ways be
complicated33

### US-Russia Relations Up

#### Trump and Putin are working to better relations between the countries

**Watson 3/18** \[Kathryn. "Trump and Putin stress improving U.S.-Russia
relations in phone call, White House says," CBS, Kathryn Watson is a
politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.,
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-putin-speak-phone-call-ukraine-war/\]

Washington --- President Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir
Putin agreed to an \"immediate ceasefire on all energy and
infrastructure\" in Ukraine when the two spoke Tuesday in a lengthy
phone call, but Russia has not agreed to a full 30-day ceasefire like
Ukraine has. Hours after the call, air raid sirens sounded and
explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital city of Kyiv. The White House
and the Kremlin both said they agreed to begin negotiations
\"immediately\" to achieve a fuller ceasefire. A Russian readout of the
call from the Kremlin said a key condition for working toward a
resolution to the conflict \"should be the complete cessation of foreign
military aid and the provision of intelligence information to Kyiv.\"
The White House readout did not contain that information, or Mr.
Trump\'s response. \"My phone conversation today with President Putin of
Russia was a very good and productive one,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth
Social. \"We agreed to an immediate ceasefire on all energy and
infrastructure, with an understanding that we will be working quickly to
have a complete ceasefire and, ultimately, an END to this very horrible
war between Russia and Ukraine. \... Many elements of a contract for
peace were discussed, including the fact that thousands of soldiers are
being killed, and both President Putin and President Zelenskyy would
like to see it end.\" The call lasted at least 90 minutes, as indicated
by the timing of White House updates, but the exact duration hasn\'t
been disclosed yet. \"Today, [President Trump and President
Putin]{.underline} spoke about the need for peace and a ceasefire in the
Ukraine war,\" a White House readout of the call said. \"Both leaders
agreed this conflict needs to end with a lasting peace. They also
[stressed the need for improved bilateral relations between the United
States and Russia]{.underline}.The blood and treasure that both Ukraine
and Russia have been spending in this war would be better spent on the
needs of their people. \... The leaders agreed that the movement to
peace will begin with an energy and infrastructure ceasefire, as well as
technical negotiations on implementation of a maritime ceasefire in the
Black Sea, full ceasefire and permanent peace. These negotiations will
begin immediately in the Middle East.\"

decades of U.S. policy," NBC,
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-turns-russia-breaking-decades-us-policy-rcna194518\]

President Donald Trump has said Ukraine --- not Russia --- started the
war. He's called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy --- not
Vladimir Putin --- a dictator. Meanwhile, Trump's administration is
standing down on a suite of tough anti-Kremlin policies. In just over a
month, [Trump has executed a startling realignment of American foreign
policy, effectively throwing U.S. support behind Moscow and rejecting
the tight alliance with Kyiv cultivated by former President Joe
Biden.]{.underline} [The extraordinary pivot has upended decades of
hawkish foreign policy toward Russia]{.underline} that provided a rare
area of bipartisan consensus in an increasingly divided nation. Trump's
recent moves have drawn international attention, unsettling U.S. allies
in Europe and thrilling conservative populists who favor a turn away
from Zelenskyy. The new posture was put in stark relief on Friday during
a tense Oval Office meeting between [Trump and Zelenskyy]{.underline}.
The leaders [clashed in front of the press]{.underline}, raising
questions about the future of American support for Kyiv, more than three
years after Russia opened the largest conflict in Europe since World War
II. [U.S. officials have made a series of policy changes in recent weeks
that seem to herald a more cooperative stance with Russia: The White
House ordered a pause on military aid to Ukraine as the administration
carries out a review]{.underline}, a White House official and a U.S.
official told NBC News on Monday. Late last week, Defense Secretary Pete
Hegseth ordered the [U.S. Cyber Command to cease offensive cyber
operations and information operations against Russia]{.underline}, a
U.S. official familiar with the matter told NBC News. It's unclear how
long the order will last. [Attorney General]{.underline} Pam Bondi, on
her first day in office, [disbanded efforts to seize the assets of
Russian oligarchs]{.underline}, breaking up Biden-era programs known as
Task Force Klepto Capture and the Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative.
In a separate directive, [Bondi ordered a halt to a federal law
enforcement initiative to combat secret influence campaigns by
Russia]{.underline}, China and other traditional U.S. adversaries that
attempt to sow division in U.S. politics. Secretary of State Marco Rubio
and other top Trump administration officials traveled to Saudi Arabia
last month to start peace negotiations with Russia --- but Zelenskyy
said Ukrainian officials hadn't been invited. [Trump has long professed
a desire to reset and improve relations with Russia]{.underline}. [He
has repeatedly said he believes it is in the national interest to "get
along" with Moscow]{.underline} and cast doubt on the value of core
parts of the post-World War II global security architecture, including
NATO and the European Union. Trump's first term was shadowed by former
special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation --- a probe that
Trump has repeatedly dismissed as the "Russia hoax." [Trump's approach
is a dramatic departure from traditional U.S. foreign policy toward
Russia]{.underline}, a period spanning the Cold War with the former
Soviet Union as well as the rise of Putin. American presidents,
Republicans and Democrats alike, typically struck a more bellicose tone
on the threat posed by an emboldened Russia. [Putin's regime has
welcomed the overtures]{.underline} from Trump. In statements reported
by Russian state media agency TASS, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov
praised Trump as a pragmatist who operates with "common sense." "We see
that the collective West has begun to partially lose its unity," Kremlin
spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Monday. Democrats
and [anti-Trump]{.underline} Republican [commentators]{.underline} have
sharply criticized the administration since the Oval Office meeting,
[accusing Trump of effectively selling out Ukraine]{.underline}. In a
post on his Truth Social platform early Monday, Trump defended himself
and insisted he had helped keep much of Ukraine intact. "The only
President who gave none of Ukraine's land to Putin's Russia is President
Donald J. Trump," he wrote in the post. "Remember that when the weak and
ineffective Democrat's criticize, and the Fake News gladly puts out
anything they say!" But there is a partisan divide on Ukraine; Gallup
recently found that 84% of Democrats have a favorable view of Ukraine,
whereas only 54% of Republican poll respondents said the same. In the
wake of the Trump-Zelenskyy spat, a handful of Republican lawmakers
defended Ukraine, while most --- including House Speaker Mike Johnson,
R-La., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. --- said Zelenskyy may have to
resign. The feud between continued Monday, with Trump disparaging his
Ukrainian counterpart in a post on social media.

In recent days, [President Trump and his administration have released a
radical new geopolitical strategy, one in which the White House seems to
be turning against traditional European allies and building closer ties
to Vladimir Putin's Russia]{.underline}. It appears that part of this
interest in [building closer links to Russia]{.underline}, including by
disdaining Ukraine, blaming the war on Ukraine (Russia invaded Ukraine),
and [Trump himself lavishly praising Putin]{.underline}, is the idea
that the United States can use Russia alongside Washington as a tool
together against China. In some ways, this would vaguely resemble a
reverse Kissinger---Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon had courted China,
which was already splitting with the Soviet Union, to build a U.S.-China
front against Moscow. Here, the White House and its China super hawks
seem to believe that they can work with Russia to isolate China from the
world and damage its increasing global presence. More From Our Experts

#### US has completely reset relations

**Mills 3/20**
\["https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-10218/CBP-10218.pdf\]

During a telephone conversation on 12 February 2025, President
[Trump]{.underline} and President Putin [agreed to reset US-Russian
relations and re-establish dialogue on "topics of mutual
interest]{.underline}", including the possible settlement of the Ukraine
conflict. The first round of bilateral talks took place in Saudi Arabia
on 18 February 2025 and was the first meeting between US and Russian
officials in over three years. [Both sides agreed to take steps to
normalise diplomatic relations]{.underline} and to appoint high-level
teams to begin working on a Ukraine peace agreement. The US had faced
criticism prior to the meeting for the absence of Ukrainian or European
representation at the talks. President Zelenskyy said that Ukraine would
not accept any agreements made without the country's involvement and
warned against trusting "Putin's claims of readiness to end the war". EU
High Representative Kaja Kallas, accused President Trump of appeasing
Russia. The [Trump]{.underline} administration has also appeared to
[soften its approach to Russia in other areas, moving to disband various
taskforces combating Russian disinformation, preventing sanctions
evasion by Russian oligarchs and investigating war crimes in relation to
the Ukraine conflict. The US Department of Defense has also suspended
offensive cyber operations against Russia.]{.underline} A summit meeting
between President Trump and President Putin is expected to happen as a
direct result of this reset in relations, although a timeframe is not
yet clear.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region as
a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: "We need to pursue joint
projects, including, for example, in the Arctic." [The
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} region [makes sense [as a **setting** for
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} as [the [two sides]{.mark} have
[**explicitly expressed interest** in]{.mark} **exploring
[cooperation]{.mark}** [in **energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[investment]{.underline}**, [and **geopolitical
issues**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Western sanctions on Russia have led
Moscow to step up its cooperation in the Arctic with China in joint
energy ventures and grand plans for Arctic shipping. US officials now
see Arctic cooperation as a potential means to "drive a wedge" between
Moscow and Beijing.

In my meetings in Moscow [with [**American** and **Russian
diplomats**]{.mark}]{.underline} and businessmen over the past few
weeks, [it is **clear**]{.underline} that [many [are interested in
**diverse** forms of **Arctic cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [from
cultural diplomacy]{.underline} that celebrates the commonalities of
Indigenous peoples on both sides of the Bering Strait, [to scientific
diplomacy]{.underline} to understand and adapt to climate hazards faced
by both nations. Business interests, however, are at the top of the
agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together [with Trump's desire to acquire]{.underline} Ukraine's
resources and reduce the US' dependence on Chinese [rare
earth]{.underline}, it is clear that rare earth minerals are a key focus
of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has large deposits of rare
earth elements and is strategically positioned alongside Arctic shipping
lanes and offshore oil deposits. [[Putin]{.mark}'s offer to [**open**
Russian **rare earth**]{.mark} minerals [to **joint exploration** with
the US]{.mark} may]{.underline} also [have implications for Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

MOSCOW, March 27 (Reuters) - Geopolitical [[rivalries are intensifying
in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} but [[Russia is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[willing to cooperate with foreign partners]{.underline}]{.mark},
including [[from the West]{.underline}]{.mark}, in economic ventures
there [that will benefit all sides]{.underline}, Russian President
Vladimir Putin said on Thursday. In a major speech, Putin said U.S.
President Donald Trump\'s stated intention to acquire Greenland was
\"serious\", and [it was clear that [the U.S. would]{.mark}]{.underline}
continue to [[promote its interests in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}
The Greenland question had nothing to do with Russia, he said. But
Moscow was concerned that \"NATO countries in general are increasingly
designating the far north as a springboard for possible conflicts,
practising the use of troops in these conditions, including by their
\'new recruits\', Finland and Sweden,\" he said, referring to the
alliance\'s latest members. Russia was monitoring the situation and
building a response, including by boosting its military capabilities in
the region. \"We will not allow encroachments on the sovereignty of our
country and will reliably protect our national interests,\" Putin said.
[[Focus on]{.mark} the [Arctic\'s strategic importance for mining,
shipping and security has increased sharply ]{.mark}]{.underline}because
of repeated statements by Trump that he wants to acquire Greenland. He
has not ruled out doing so by force. The [[Arctic holds fossil fuels and
minerals]{.mark} beneath the land [and]{.mark} the seabed that could
become more accessible with global warming.]{.underline} It is also [[an
area of military competition, where]{.mark} defence analysts say [Russia
has built up its presence]{.mark}]{.underline} much faster than the West
by reopening Soviet-era bases and modernising its navy. [The
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [sees the Arctic as crucial]{.mark} for
natural security, including for its early warning system against nuclear
attacks.]{.underline} On the economic front, Putin has made it a top
priority to ramp up commerce via the Northern Sea Route (NSR) through
Arctic waters as Russia shifts trade towards Asia and away from Europe
because of Western sanctions. Oil shipments from Russian ports to China
via the NSR rose by a quarter last year. [[Foreign partners prepared to
cooperate with Russia]{.mark} on investment projects in the region
[would be guaranteed a good return]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} Putin
said. He called for an expansion of Russia\'s northern ports and the
building of a merchant fleet in the Arctic, supported by new-generation
icebreakers including nuclear-powered ones. But he said [[Russia\'s
domestic capabilities were insufficient]{.mark} for this at the moment,
and that [it would]{.mark} also [require buying vessels and interacting
with foreign shipbuilders.]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia was already
successfully shipping oil and liquefied natural gas via the NSR, he
said. \"Now [[we need]{.mark} to create conditions for the growth of
[effective domestic operators that will engage]{.mark} [in transporting
containers of coal, bulk and other cargo through the
Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} We are also open here to the creation of
joint ventures,\" he added. [[International]{.mark} logistics [firms
could]{.mark} supply capital, technology and merchant ships [to support
this]{.mark},]{.underline} he said. Putin delivered his speech to a
conference on the Arctic in Murmansk, a port from which the NSR runs
eastward across the top of Russia to the Bering Strait near Alaska. He
said Murmansk\'s port capacity should be at least trebled in the coming
years, with construction of new terminals and railway links, and
\"partners\" from Belarus, China, the United Arab Emirates and other
countries were showing interest in this project.

[Accurate threat assessment is vital]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the
formulation of [foreign policy]{.underline}. Across centuries of
political and technological change, the giants of strategy---from
Sun-tzu and Thucydides to Carl von Clausewitz and George Kennan---warned
against exaggerating threats and ignoring their geopolitical context.
Still, ideologically driven [threat inflation]{.underline}---from a
phantom Vietnamese attack in the Gulf of Tonkin to nonexistent Iraqi
nuclear and chemical weapons---[has]{.underline} repeatedly [led the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [into costly
quagmires.]{.underline} Despite this history, [the country is again on
the brink of a]{.underline}n ideologically driven
[blunder]{.underline}---this time [in the Arctic]{.underline}. For over
a decade, [defense hawks have been sounding an alarm over
Russia]{.underline}'s supposed military superiority and incipient
aggression [in the region]{.underline}. Previous U.S. presidents
resisted the bait, avoiding confrontation and embracing cooperation
through the multinational Arctic Council established after the end of
the Cold War. They knew that Russia's forces in the region were
defensively structured and weaker than they were before the Soviet
collapse in 1991, despite efforts to rebuild them that began in the
mid-2000s. Previous U.S. presidents also knew that [U.S. and NATO forces
had the clear upper hand in the Arctic and that predictions of Russian
aggression were mainly threat-mongering]{.underline} by armchair
analysts and vested political interests. [But]{.underline} the
administration of U.S. President Donald [Trump has]{.underline} recently
[embraced Arctic alarmism with a vengeance]{.underline}. [It has stoked
fears of Russian]{.underline} and Chinese "[aggression]{.underline},"
trashed the Arctic Council's delicate diplomacy, and adopted a new
confrontational posture. In so doing, [it joins the alarmists in three
serious mistakes]{.underline}: [the failure to assess]{.underline}
specific [threats accurately]{.underline}, the failure [to consider an
adversary's forces in relation to those of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its allies, [and the failure to evaluate
the]{.underline} broader strategic [landscape]{.underline}---the
political, economic, and environmental factors [beyond the
battlefield]{.underline}. [Violation of]{.underline} [these]{.underline}
three pillars of careful threat assessment [is drawing the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [toward]{.underline} an
unnecessary [confrontation]{.underline} in a region where the real enemy
isn't Cold War ghosts but looming environmental disaster. ... Blind to
looming disaster, Trump's desire to dominate an Arctic endowed with
endless U.S. oil brings to mind a crusader from the Middle Ages who,
while seeking to export his faith on a journey of conquest, unwittingly
imports a plague that devastates his own country. This is no casual
metaphor. Scientists have long warned about the dangers of disease in a
warming Arctic and traced recent anthrax outbreaks to spores from the
thawing carcasses of long-frozen animals. Virologists have "awakened"
dormant viruses from the permafrost, and biologists are charting the
warming-fueled spread of disease in Arctic fish and mammals. The
collapse of key species or the spread of disease between species,
including humans, could make the Arctic the source of the next global
pandemic. In the face of all this, [bromides]{.underline} from analysts
such as Heather Conley [that "the country that controls the Arctic
controls the world" are]{.underline} extremely
[shortsighted]{.underline}. Climate-driven crises upend traditional
notions of political-military control. **[The looming catastrophe can be
managed only cooperatively]{.underline}**. Thirty years ago, as the
United States and the Soviet Union ended the Cold War and pondered how
to eliminate chemical weapons, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker
proposed disposing of them "somewhere in the Arctic." Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev replied: "That would be even worse" because, in the
Arctic, "the ecological balance cannot be disturbed under any
circumstances." [Let]{.underline} the [wisdom]{.underline} of their
predecessors **[guide today's leaders in halting an incipient Arctic
arms race that can only hasten global catastrophe.]{.underline}**

The Barents Sea is located in the European Arctic and divided between
Russian and Norwegian territorial waters. The Arctic is no stranger to
NATO military maneuvers, but the presence of U.S. warships in Russia's
backyard is unprecedented since the end of the Cold War. In the
twentieth century, the Barents region was the setting for two invasions
of Russia by Western troops. British, American, and French troops
intervened in the Russian Civil War by occupying Murmansk and
Arkhangelsk, and Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Arctic as part of
Operation Silver Fox. The May 2020 military exercise may be considered a
case of what Michael T. Klare calls [the Pompeo Doctrine]{.underline}.
Named after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, it [is a foreign policy
concept centered on deterring Russia and China in the
Arctic]{.underline}, while exploiting the region's resources.
[Scholars]{.underline} and journalists [have]{.underline} for a while
[predicted]{.underline} the emergence of a "new great game" and [a
contest for Arctic resources]{.underline}, [but in reality, the Arctic
stands as an exemplar of]{.underline} post-Cold War security and
[cooperation]{.underline}. Perhaps [the greatest example of this is the
Arctic Council]{.underline}, an intergovernmental forum that acts by
consensus between the eight Arctic states -- the US, Russia, Canada,
Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. [The Council has been the
venue for agreements]{.underline} on oil spill response coordination,
fisheries management, joint research, and search and rescue operations.
[The Pompeo Doctrine, driven by great power competition]{.underline} and
blind to the climate crisis that disproportionally threatens the Arctic,
**[threatens this peace]{.underline}**. Deterring Russia and China The
joint exercise consisted of around 1,200 sailors from the U.S. and U.K.
They practiced "combined and divisional surface warfare tactics, and
refined coordinated operations with US Air Forces Europe, and reinforced
Arctic communications capabilities." [Russia treats the Barents Sea "a
little like we treat the Virginia Capes]{.underline} Operating Area
(VACAPES) off the Virginia and North Carolina coasts," said Bryan Clark,
a former U.S. submarine officer and senior fellow at The Hudson
Institute. The Far North has in recent years sharply risen on the U.S.
security agenda principally because we are noticing the accelerating
strategic interest of Russia and China in the region. [Russia has long
been an Arctic hegemon]{.underline}; [northern resource extractions
account for around 10 percent of Russian GDP and 20 percent of
exports]{.underline}. [The Russian military is expectedly committed to
maintaining a comprehensive]{.underline} sea, air, and land
[presence]{.underline} [as Russia's northern border makes up more than
half of the Arctic Ocean coastline]{.underline}. On the other hand,
China's Arctic interest is not so straightforward. In January 2018,
China declared itself a "near-Arctic state" with important interests in
Arctic affairs even though China's northern-most territory is 900 miles
from the Arctic Circle. Beijing's Far North activities began with
scientific research and have expanded into heavy bilateral investment in
nearly every Arctic nation. In China's 2018 Arctic Policy, the Polar
Silk Road was highlighted as one of the main maritime shipping passages
of the Belt and Road Initiative. Prolonging Arctic cooperation The
Russian military concentrates a significant part of its nuclear
deterrent ability on the Kola Peninsula, adjacent to northern Norway.
[Northern Russia]{.underline}, particularly the Barents Sea, [has one of
the largest concentrations of military]{.underline} and civilian
[nuclear installations in the world]{.underline}. Most of Russia's
submarine-launched ballistic missiles are maintained in the Murmansk
area, making the region fundamental for Russian national security. The
U.S.-U.K. naval exercise, in an area that includes part of Russia's
exclusive economic zone, represents a new pointed phase in Arctic
security. The event may lead to an increase in tensions in the European
Arctic. Norway did not take part in the recent exercises. Oslo abstained
from joining the NATO-led Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System in
October 2019 to avoid antagonizing Russia. Once again, Norway is wise to
avoid potentially destabilizing its relations with Russia. [Norway and
Russia agreed to divide the Barents Sea in half in 2010 after decades
of]{.underline} arguments and [negotiations]{.underline}. The
Russian-Norwegian accord demonstrated that [both nations are committed
to resolving border disputes]{.underline} in the North [through
international law]{.underline}, especially through the principles of the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the 2008
Ilulissat Declaration. At the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in May
2019, the U.S. stood alone as Pompeo refused to sign a joint declaration
protecting the rapidly melting Arctic because he took issue with wording
that declared climate change as a serious threat. The diminishing sea
ice and thawing permafrost in the North have for a long time demanded
attention from U.S. policymakers. One of the last policy decisions of
the Obama administration was to ban new oil and gas drilling in most of
the U.S. Arctic and Atlantic oceans. Washington has since repealed
numerous environmental regulations and pulled out of the Paris climate
accord. Pompeo criticized Russia's "aggressive behavior" and "illegal
demands" that other nations request permission to use the Northern Sea
Route. Pompeo rejected China's near-Arctic status claim and warned that
Chinese activities would lead to the emergence of a "new South China
Sea." Whither Arctic peace in 2020? Considering the enduring cooperative
mechanisms in the region, [it is in the interest of U.S. national
security that the U.S. upholds the Arctic peace]{.underline}.
Nonetheless, it is hard to imagine the Trump administration shifting its
focus to fighting the climate crisis. The [Trump]{.underline}
administration eliminated the special representative positions at State
Department for the Arctic and climate change. This strengthening of
military force "in response to Russia's destabilizing activities" [risks
the emergence of a security dilemma]{.underline} --- [a treacherous
situation where states embark on the relentless mission of trying to
achieve a monopoly of violence in the region]{.underline}. If the U.S.
joined all seven other Arctic nations, and China, in ratifying the
UNCLOS, it would be in a better position to legally respond to other
states' activities in the Arctic. [The]{.underline} circumpolar [peace
and stability of the Arctic]{.underline} [can]{.underline} still [live
on with comprehensive cooperation]{.underline}, as promoted by the
Arctic Council, [but it requires a transformation in U.S. foreign and
defense policy regarding Arctic affairs]{.underline}. Addressing the
climate crisis is still regarded as our most pressing national security
issue, but will perhaps continue to be overlooked by this
administration.

#### Icebreaker focus leads to alarmism in the arctic - undermines relations with russia and generates competition

**Avey 19** (Paul, assistant professor of political science, "The
Icebreaker Gap Doesn't Mean America is Losing in the Arctic,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/11/the-icebreaker-gap-doesnt-mean-america-is-losing-in-the-arctic/)

Local defense challenges in the Arctic will remain, of course. Those
should be addressed using political and economic diplomacy and refining
military concepts and capabilities as necessary. [Resisting the
temptation to engage in numerical comparisons of icebreakers will help
avoid alarmist views]{.underline} [that]{.underline} may [contribute
to]{.underline} [tensions and]{.underline}, at worst, the
[militarization of the region if the Pentagon deploys new resources in
response]{.underline} [to that perceived vulnerability]{.underline}.
[Other concerns]{.underline}, such as China's interest in building
airports in Greenland, [are best dealt with by diplomatic, information,
and economic tools rather than military platforms]{.underline} (though
trying to buy Greenland probably isn't the best approach). Even if a
larger defense role in the Arctic is warranted, the United States should
focus first on developing concepts for existing assets, determining what
infrastructure requires modernization, and carefully examining how
initiatives elsewhere can benefit regional security and minimize
challenges emerging from the region. As the climate changes, human
activity in the Arctic (and Antarctic) will increase. There is a need
for additional icebreakers to augment the Coast Guard's law enforcement,
search and rescue, disaster response, situational awareness, and
scientific support missions, among others. Indeed, "polar icebreakers
support 9 of the Coast Guard's 11 statutory missions." The only two not
currently supported are "illegal drug interdiction and undocumented
migrant interdiction." Many of these tasks clearly advance U.S. national
security. But [placing icebreakers in a central defense role comes with
opportunity costs. If the United States does field multiple new
icebreakers, those ships may find defense missions taking up
more]{.underline} and more of their [time]{.underline}. As a result,
[they will be less able to support]{.underline} the myriad of [homeland
security]{.underline} [and]{.underline} important
[scientific]{.underline} [missions]{.underline} they will be
increasingly called upon to perform. It is worth noting the Coast Guard
identified a need for six new icebreakers in 2013 (and gaps in support
for polar missions in 2010), before the public discussion in Washington
shifted to the return of great-power competition broadly and in the
Arctic specifically. [Coast Guard polar security cutters will have
plenty to do without additional tasks to offset a perceived military
vulnerability arising from Russian and Chinese icebreakers]{.underline}.

#### Russian Arctic activity is defensive and commercial now- US increase in military presence risks upsetting stability and provoking confrontation

[Most of America's historic foreign policy blunders were driven by
threat inflation.]{.underline} From fake attacks on ships in Havana
Harbor or the Gulf of Tonkin, to falling dominos in Southeast Asia and
WMD in Iraq --- the response to these "dire threats" is often a costly
quagmire. In the Cold War it was phony bomber and missile "gaps" that
sparked a precarious and ultimately pointless nuclear confrontation.
**[Today a new "icebreaker gap" could fuel an Arctic arms
race]{.underline}**. For over a decade, [defense hawks have been
sounding the alarm about Russia's supposed]{.underline} "militarization"
and "[dominance" of the Arctic]{.underline}. More recently, [China has
joined the list of "aggressors]{.underline}" allegedly threatening vital
Western economic and strategic interests in the High North. The Obama
administration resisted calls for a major Arctic buildup coming from a
mix of armchair analysts, defense contractors, and special political
interests. Notably, the U.S. Navy has never joined this chorus. Nobody
denies the need for some new heavy [icebreakers]{.underline} to buttress
an aging fleet, but these [are for Coast Guard missions --- not the
remote warfighting scenarios]{.underline} hyped by Arctic hawks. Theirs
is classic threat inflation, built on equal parts exaggeration and
ignorance, that makes it irresistible to a Trump administration happy to
overturn yet another Obama legacy. And so, with a recent series of
provocative words and deeds, America's Arctic policy has taken an
abruptly belligerent turn. [This]{.underline} is another historic
mistake, not only because it [could lead to]{.underline} costly and
**[dangerous confrontation in an extremely fragile
region]{.underline}**, but because **[its entire premise is
false]{.underline}**. Once a superpower rival in the High North,
[Russia's Arctic presence imploded after the Cold War]{.underline}
leaving America and its NATO allies militarily dominant. Retreating from
rivalry, [Russia joined other regional states in a new Arctic Council
that has proved a model of shared global governance]{.underline},
fostering cooperation in areas from environmental protection and search
and rescue to commercial shipping and fisheries. Importantly, [Arctic
Council members agreed over a decade ago to settle any territorial
disputes through the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[N]{.underline}ations [C]{.underline}onvention on the [L]{.underline}aw
of the [S]{.underline}ea framework --- and have scrupulously kept to
that agreement. **[It is simply false that Russia threatens to
seize]{.underline}** the North Pole seabed or other **[Arctic
territory]{.underline}**, or that China, a nonvoting observer at the
Arctic Council, threatens to undermine the independence of regional
states through its so-called "Polar Silk Road." What
[Russia]{.underline} [has]{.underline} done, after the collapse of its
northern military presence in the 1990s, is invest in new security
infrastructure of [an essentially defensive character]{.underline} ---
which only makes sense, given NATO's offensive advantages and Russia's
dependence on Arctic petroleum, minerals, and shipping routes for its
economic survival. For its part, China has joined the global polar
research establishment, invested several billion dollars in regional
resource projects, and demonstrated its keen interest in Russia's
northern shipping route --- which only makes sense given China's
dependence on trade between Europe and Asia. Beijing's Arctic presence
is both legal and limited --- [nothing like the nefarious web of
influence that is often suggested,]{.underline} making it simply weird
that China's self-identification as a "near-Arctic" state causes
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to erupt in fury. [More than a decade of
investment in rebuilding its Arctic military presence has still not
returned Russia to its level of the 1980s.]{.underline} Its
problem-plagued Northern Fleet is also puny, just a few dozen surface
ships and a similar number of submarines. Many of these vessels are
obsolescent and --- notwithstanding the hype accompanying recent
exercises --- constitute a force mainly suited for coastal defense.
Similarly, [Russia's Arctic air power is far outclassed by
NATO's]{.underline}, [lacking]{.underline} both the range (due to
minimal in-air refueling assets) and sophistication (Russia still has
yet to deploy true fifth-generation "stealth" aircraft, such as NATO's
F-22s and F-35s) needed for [serious power projection]{.underline}. They
mainly fly from the same distant airfields as 20 years ago because
Russia's much-ballyhooed "new Arctic bases" are too small --- and lack
the infrastructure --- to house even a single fighter squadron much less
a full air wing. What they can support are anti-air and anti-ship
defensive missile batteries. But these, of course, are really only
useful for defending while their supposed "area denial" capabilities are
much exaggerated. In other words, [Moscow has severely limited
power-projection capability and has structured its forces to protect its
own shores]{.underline}. [As for the oft-mentioned "icebreaker gap,"
Russia's large fleet of icebreakers is dedicated to escorting commercial
shipping]{.underline} through dangerous polar seas. Otherwise, it
performs the same missions as the U.S. Coast Guard: search and rescue,
anti-smuggling, oil spill response, and resupply of remote coastal
communities and polar research stations. Given the critical importance
of Russia's vast Arctic territory to its economic and scientific
interests (Russia's Arctic coastline is ten times longer than America's)
[an "icebreaker gap" is to be expected. It has nominal military
significance at best.]{.underline} But that has not stopped the Trump
administration from trumpeting the false narrative of Russian "Arctic
aggression," which it has recently followed with several aggressive
steps of its own: undermining an Arctic Council ministerial meeting in
Finland with bombast and threats; denouncing its Danish allies for
rejecting a ridiculous offer to purchase Greenland; announcing the
potential acquisition of foreign Arctic bases along with armed,
nuclear-powered icebreakers; and sending a naval flotilla close to
Russia's Arctic coast in a dramatic show of force. The U.S. rejects
Russia's claim of dominion over some territorial waters as exceeding
what the UNCLOS permits, and Trump administration officials have called
for even more intrusive "freedom of navigation" operations to
demonstrate that rejection forcefully. But some cannot help noting that
the U.S. does not actively challenge Canada's identical claims in its
own Arctic waters, and that the U.S. itself has never ratified UNCLOS
--- which might be a better first step toward a diplomatic, rather than
military, resolution. [Perhaps the strongest argument against such shows
of force in the Russian Arctic is that they are needlessly, dangerously
provocative]{.underline}.

"It can look surprising only at first glance and it would be wrong to

the polar region.]{.underline} "We are certainly concerned about NATO
members [describing]{.underline} the [Far North as the region of
possible conflicts]{.underline}," he said, noting that Russia's
neighbors Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance.
"[Russia]{.underline} has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we
[will]{.underline} closely [follow the developments]{.underline} and
mount an appropriate response [by increasing]{.underline} our [military

[Russia]{.underline} has [sought to assert its influence
over]{.underline} wide areas of the [Arctic in competition
with]{.underline} the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[Canada, Denmark and Norway]{.underline} [as shrinking polar ice from

region, believed to hold up to one-fourth of the Earth's undiscovered
oil and gas. "[We won't allow any infringement on our country's
sovereignty, reliably safeguard our national interests]{.underline}
while supporting peace and [stability in the polar region," Putin
said]{.underline}. [While pledging to strengthen Russia's military
foothold in the Arctic]{.underline}, Putin said that [Moscow was holding

[the more significant the results will be and the broader

Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Putin's

officials, told reporters last month that [Russia and the U.S. should
develop joint energy ventures. "We need joint projects, including in the

consistent messaging. For example, in 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo
decried Russian aggression in the Arctic, citing their regulations on
NSR shipping, Arctic fortification, and actions in Ukraine.40) However,
Pompeo's message lacked specificity about why the US felt threatened,
simply stating that the US would host military exercises and increase

the Arctic are firm, predictable, consistent, and straightforward to

How Russia Is Turning a Peaceful Region into a Military Base,

In recent years, [[Russia]{.mark} has [ramped]{.mark} [up]{.mark} its
[military]{.mark} [buildup]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark},
[turning]{.mark} this critical [trade]{.mark} [route]{.mark}
[into]{.mark} a potential [geopolitical]{.mark}
[battleground]{.mark}.]{.underline} When discussing global trade routes,
two major arteries immediately come to mind: the Suez and Panama Canals.
These passages handle massive cargo volumes between Asia, Europe, and
the United States. However, there is a third, less frequently mentioned
route that is no less important: the Arctic trade route. [Navigating the
Arctic is challenging due to its extreme climate]{.underline}---bitter
cold and waters covered with ice nearly year-round. For now. Climate
scientists disagree on exact timelines, but they all predict [that in
the next 50 years, Arctic conditions will change, temperatures will
rise, and permafrost will retreat.]{.underline} This would not only make
the trade route more accessible but also ease access to another valuable
resource---natural deposits. The Arctic is

to hold 412 billion barrels of oil and gas, about 22% of the world's
undiscovered reserves. For decades, [Arctic-bordering nations have
viewed the region as a zone of peace, cooperation, and shared use.
Russia once did too. But not anymore. [Moscow's]{.mark} relentless
[fixation]{.mark} [on]{.mark} external [threats]{.mark}---and the belief
that enemies are preparing to strike---has changed its
approach.]{.underline} Russia's Arctic border stretches an astonishing
14,000 miles (24,000 km). For a long time, Moscow relied on nature's
brutal conditions---perpetual ice and subzero cold---as its first line
of defense. Yet for the Kremlin, natural defenses are not enough. [The
[Arctic]{.mark} [is]{.mark} now [home]{.mark} [to]{.mark} a
[growing]{.mark} [network]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [Russian]{.mark}
[military]{.mark} [installations]{.mark}.]{.underline} As early as 2021,
[US media
[reported](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/04/05/europe/russia-arctic-nato-military-intl-cmd/index.html)
that [Russia]{.mark} [was]{.mark} [reviving]{.mark} [Soviet]{.mark}-era

[over]{.mark} the [region]{.mark}, which covers a vast portion of the
Northern Hemisphere.]{.underline} In 2024, Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark}

[history]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[Ocean-2024]{.underline}](https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/opinions/war-in-the-arctic/157377).
[The drill involved 400 warships, submarines, and support vessels, as
well as 120 planes and helicopters---an unprecedented show of
force.]{.underline} As part of the exercises, strategic bombers capable
of carrying nuclear missiles flew over the Barents and Norwegian Seas.
[These drills have triggered significant alarm. Since the Cold War, few
considered the Arctic a potential war zone.]{.underline} But Russia is
preparing for a future where ice recedes, natural defenses disappear,
and the region becomes a battlefield. While much of the world overlooks
this threat, Scandinavian nations feel it acutely. In 2024, discussions
about damaged undersea cables in the Baltic Sea gained traction,
following previous concerns over Russian electronic warfare (GPS
jamming) in 2022 and 2023. However, the [Arctic has faced such
provocations for years.]{.underline} Russian military aircraft have
repeatedly violated Scandinavian airspace, and in 2022, a fiber-optic
cable connecting mainland Norway to the Svalbard archipelago was
[[severed]{.underline}](https://www.twz.com/43828/undersea-cable-connecting-norway-with-arctic-satellite-station-has-been-mysteriously-severed?fbclid=IwAR2zCfTNHOpJz3w274Xq5VZIMV6IjgWxxPVSD1UQcbvV3CXi-nKdHRNBuEE).
Suspicion fell on Russia, as a Russian fishing vessel was in the area at
the time of the incident. This cable supports a satellite station in
Svalbard and provides broadband internet access to the Arctic
archipelago. [Arctic nations recognize that melting ice does not just
expose Russia's borders---it affects theirs. Moscow's military buildup
may not be about defense, and its exercises may not be just drills.
Ukraine has already learned that lesson.]{.underline} But military
expansion isn't the only motivation at play. The presence of ice does
not mean the Arctic is unnavigable. Trade exists, though on a smaller
scale than in other parts of the world, and it requires a special class
of escort vessels---icebreakers. Here, [[Russia]{.mark} [is]{.mark} the

Ministry, the country operates 41 icebreakers, including seven

now investing in their own icebreaker fleets rather than relying solely
on their so-called "ally." [[Russia's]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}

international
[[agreements]{.underline}](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2024)754604)
designate territorial waters up to 12 miles (22 km) from the coast and
exclusive economic zones up to 200 miles (370 km), Russia has spent
years trying to expand its claim. Moscow argues that the Lomonosov and
Mendeleev Ridges are extensions of its continental shelf, thereby
asserting rights over an additional 463,000 square miles (1.2 million
km²)---including the North Pole. At stake are 22% of the world's
untapped oil and gas reserves. [[For]{.mark} [Russia]{.mark},
[gaining]{.mark} [control]{.mark} of these resources [represents]{.mark}
[another]{.mark} [opportunity]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [generate]{.mark}

Russia has earned over \$800 billion from Arctic resource extraction.

Arctic: Is an Ice Curtain Emerging?"

Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine effectively cut Western financial and
diplomatic ties in the Arctic region. Even long-standing cooperation
through the Arctic Council came to a halt during Russia's Chairmanship.
Nevertheless, [Russia depends heavily on developing its Arctic zone's
abundant natural resources to sustain economic growth]{.underline}. With
Western partnerships now out of reach, [Russia has turned to China to
fill the looming gap in the Arctic]{.underline}. Under the "no-limits"
friendship declared between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian
President Vladimir Putin, the two nations have intensified their
cooperation in the region.

.The return to great power politics is intensifying the desire among
competing states to establish interests in the Arctic region. [The
**erosion of the cooperative spirit** that has defined the region over
the past three decades could have a profoundly negative impact on Arctic
governance, scientific collaboration, environmental protection, and
sustainable development]{.underline}. Indeed, [the emergence of an ice
curtain]{.underline}---nearly eighty years after Churchill's famous
declaration of an iron curtain descending across Europe---**[will
particularly hinder cooperation in critical areas such as understanding
climate change, preserving fragile ecosystems, and protecting the
environment from unscrupulous resource extraction
practices]{.underline}**. [This situation may also adversely affect
Indigenous communities in the region]{.underline}, limiting dialogue and
collaboration in the circumpolar Arctic. Most concerningly, [the
militarization of the region could reach new heights -- a dangerous
prospect given the lack of mechanisms for dialogue and
deconfliction]{.underline}. [The Arctic security dilemma that has
already taken root may continue to escalate as Western nations seek to
counterbalance Russian militarization]{.underline} and a nascent
Sino-Russian Arctic partnership.

\"The main message I have today is that [we need to **awaken to the
importance** of the relationship between Russia and the United
States;]{.underline} [we should not leave it on **auto-pilot
indefinitely,\"**]{.underline} [said Dmitri Trenin, senior associate and
deputy director, Carnegie Moscow Center]{.underline}, at a 2 February
2007 seminar at the Kennan Institute. Trenin recounted the current
problems in the relationship, arguing that both sides have unrealistic
expectations of one another. In his view, [[the U.S.-Russian]{.mark}
[relationship is]{.mark} of [**crucial
importance**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and he described ways in which
relations could be improved.

\"At the beginning of this year, the talk in both capitals is rather
downbeat,\" Trenin said, adding, \"I think people agree more or less
that we have never had a relationship that was at such a low level as
today since 1991.\" Trenin said that this is true in spite of what he
sees as a great deal of shared interests between the two countries.

[According to Trenin, the **deterioration** of U.S.-Russian relations is
viewed in **starkly different terms** in Washington and in
Moscow.]{.underline} \"If you put your ear to the ground in Washington,
it\'s all because of Putin\'s authoritarianism at home, and increasing
assertiveness abroad,\" Trenin said. He added that Washington views
Russia\'s increased strength as a direct result of its large exports of
oil and natural gas, and for this reason Russia\'s resurgence is seen as
both undeserved and fragile.

\"If you listen in Moscow, you get a very different story,\" Trenin
observed. Prevailing opinion in Moscow regards the heightened tension
between the United States and Russia as a natural consequence of
Russia\'s increased strength. Russia\'s leadership believes that
tensions inevitably arise when one power gains strength rapidly while
another country\'s power diminishes, Trenin stated.

Both of these views are wrong, Trenin believes. \"Despite what some
people in Russia hope, the United States is not a declining power, Iraq
notwithstanding,\" he stated. \"As the world\'s most important nation,
it will be around for a long time.\" [On the other hand, he continued,
Russia is **more important** than most Americans realize. \"[Despite
what]{.mark} a number of [people]{.mark} in the U.S. have [concluded,
Russia **is not**]{.mark} **so much [in decline]{.mark}**[; it
is]{.mark} rather in the process of **[reformatting]{.mark} itself**,
emerging [as a **totally different economy**]{.mark} and **a totally
different society** than the Soviet one,\"]{.underline} Trenin said.

The steady deterioration of relations is threatening to jeopardize
future Russian-American partnership and cooperation, Trenin warned:
\"The U.S. and Russia may be straying into the territory of direct
material damage to their existing interests.\" He noted that this
situation is not likely to change until the respective American and
Russian presidential elections in 2008. [Both of the new presidents will
probably be untested statesmen, and thus an opportunity for
**reinventing the relationship** will arise.]{.underline}

In spite of these disagreements, Trenin emphasized that [Russia and the
United States **need one another** and that cooperation between the two
countries is **essential**.]{.underline} [[On]{.mark} a **wide range of
[issues]{.mark},**]{.underline} [U.S. and Russian [interests coincide,

assistance to modernize and integrate its [economy]{.mark} into the
global market, and to gain access to American markets]{.underline}, he
said. [The United States **needs Russia\'s [cooperation]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the [**fight against terrorism**,]{.mark}]{.underline} he
said. [[Positive relations]{.mark} between the two countries [would
**lead to a more stable world,**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark}
would [enhance]{.mark} both countries\' [security]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In connection with this, Trenin believes that [a new global institution
needs to be formed to **maintain stability and security**.]{.underline}
[This]{.underline} organization would be similar to the G-8, in that it
[would provide a forum for the discussion of major problems confronting
the world,]{.underline} he said, but would be more inclusive than the
G-8, because it would not require a country to be \"democratic.\" The
group could include all the G-8 members, as well as China, India, and
Brazil. Russia wants to be given a seat at the table where decisions are
made, Trenin stressed, and such an organization could be one way to
accomplish this goal.

The Arctic, warming four times faster than the rest of the world, may be
the key region for the US and Russia to advance cooperation. [[US-Russia
**rapprochement**]{.mark} may broadly benefit the world by bringing an
[end]{.mark} to]{.underline} the disastrous [[war in **Ukraine** and
reducing]{.mark} the [risk of **nuclear war**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but
existential environmental issues still demand attention.

The Trump administration has started purging government websites of
climate data. It is now the task of civil society to elevate climate
change as a concern and pressure the two countries to include climate
change in the Arctic cooperation agenda. The Arctic climate crisis is
the "canary in the coal mine" for what awaits other regions.

At the February 18, 2025, Rubio-Lavrov meeting in Riyadh, Kirill
Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, named the region as
a potential setting for US-Russia cooperation: "We need to pursue joint
projects, including, for example, in the Arctic." The Arctic region
makes sense as a setting for cooperation as the two sides have
explicitly expressed interest in exploring cooperation in energy,
investment, and geopolitical issues. Western sanctions on Russia have
led Moscow to step up its cooperation in the Arctic with China in joint
energy ventures and grand plans for Arctic shipping. US officials now
see Arctic cooperation as a potential means to "drive a wedge" between
Moscow and Beijing.

In my meetings in Moscow with [American and Russian]{.underline}
diplomats and businessmen over the past few weeks, it is clear that many
are interested in diverse forms of [[Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}, from cultural diplomacy that
celebrates the commonalities of Indigenous peoples on both sides of the
Bering Strait, to [scientific diplomacy]{.underline} to [understand and
[**adapt** to **climate hazards**]{.mark} faced by **both**
nations]{.underline}. Business interests, however, are at the top of the
agenda.

Trump's suggestion to acquire Greenland, not ruling out military or
economic coercion, has reignited global concerns over Arctic stability.
Trump's threats against Denmark, a NATO ally, have caused alarm in the
Euro-Atlantic community. While some Russian state media pundits
celebrated Trump's statements, Russian diplomats criticized the
destabilizing effect of the proposal and said that Trump's plan "can
only bring uncertainty and tension to the region."

Together with Trump's desire to acquire Ukraine's resources and reduce
the US' dependence on Chinese rare earth, it is clear that rare earth
minerals are a key focus of Trump's political worldview. Greenland has
large deposits of rare earth elements and is strategically positioned
alongside Arctic shipping lanes and offshore oil deposits. Putin's offer
to open Russian rare earth minerals to joint exploration with the US may
also have implications for Arctic cooperation.

Trump has grumbled about Russian and Chinese ships "all over the place"
near Greenland, indicating an element of great power competition in
Trump's Greenland fixation. This is a misunderstanding of Arctic
security, as Russian and Chinese military activity is far from
Greenland, occasionally operating together in the Bering Strait near
Alaska. Greenland may, however, play a role in North American defense as
a radar outpost to detect threats coming from across the North Pole.

The announced plan to revamp diplomatic relations and restore the staff
of the countries' diplomatic missions will significantly reduce the
current obstacles to [US-Russia scientific [**cooperation** in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. By making it easier to issue visas and
travel between the two countries, [Americans and Russians
will]{.underline} again [be able to conduct **[joint
research]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[expeditions]{.underline}**]{.mark},
and scientific conferences [[and]{.mark} build **[models]{.mark}** to
[better understand]{.mark} the]{.underline} unfolding
[**[climate]{.mark}** emergency]{.underline}. Scientific cooperation to
understand the changes affecting sea ice, permafrost, ecosystems, and
local communities has been blunted by the political fallout of the war
in Ukraine.

[[Cooperation]{.mark} in the Arctic can help [build **regional
stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. More importantly, [Arctic cooperation
will build [**trust** between the US and Russia
that]{.mark}]{.underline} could complement or [[**spill over**
into]{.mark} other [**crucial** fields]{.mark}]{.underline} of
cooperation [such as **[arms control]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [**Middle

[[Russian-American relations are]{.mark} nearing Cold War
[low]{.mark}s]{.underline}, and Russia's decision to withdraw from the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty last month could send the world
back to an era of duck and cover. [The perennial question of
Russian-American relations is how to coexist despite differing
geopolitical ambitions---all under the threat of nuclear
annihilation]{.underline}. [[Rapprochement]{.underline}]{.mark} (a
re-establishment of cordial or harmonious relations) [between the U.S.
and Moscow [has happened before and will need to happen
again]{.mark}]{.underline}. American policymakers should begin to
envision under what circumstances rapprochement can occur, what it will
look like, and how rapprochement can further both countries' interests.
Since 1945, there have been two significant rapprochements with
Moscow---with varying degrees of success. The first rapprochement,
called détente, lasted from the Cuban Missile Crisis until the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan. During this period, the Soviet Union and the
U.S. signed treaties such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (SALT), and the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty. They also signed the Helsinki Final Act, which some scholars
argue helped lead to the end of authoritarian communist regimes in
Eastern Europe. The second period of rapprochement was from the
mid-1980s until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. A personal
relationship between U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General
Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev highlighted this period. New bilateral
treaties were signed such as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty and SALT II. While there were still tensions during both
periods---both countries fought proxy wars against each other--- there
was finally movement away from the threat of annihilation. But [the
clouds of malaise and brinksmanship have reappeared]{.underline}. Russia
blames the U.S. for beginning this downward style through NATO's
expansion into Eastern Europe, America's pull out of the Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty in 2001, and its invasion of Iraq in 2003. The U.S. would
counter, arguing that Russia's invasions of Georgia in 2008, Crimea in
2014, and again Ukraine in 2022 have caused significantly more damage to
the U.S.-Russia relationship. Regardless, [[both countries need to find
a way to live with the other]{.underline}]{.mark}. The U.S. needs to
consider under what conditions rapprochement with Russia would be
appropriate. If Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues in its current
form, rapprochement will be politically infeasible. But the path the
conflict will take is uncertain. Rapprochement will, in many ways,
depend on how the conflict concludes. An outright Ukrainian or Russian
victory, frozen conflict, or settlement will lead to different outcomes.
Who leads Russia will matter too. Could American leaders ever cooperate
with Russia if Vladimir Putin is in power? If Putin is not in power, is
it someone more reactionary or more moderate? These questions will
matter if Russian and American leaders wish to form a rapport like
Reagan and Gorbachev, or Clinton and Yeltsin. [There are areas where
[cooperation is necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The most obvious
is]{.mark} the [revival and strengthening of nuclear missile
treaties]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The U.S. and Russia still hold the most
nuclear weapons in the world, and [working to reduce the]{.mark} amount
and [ways they are deployed would]{.mark} help [temper
fears]{.mark}]{.underline} of mutually assured destruction [[and set a
positive precedent for other agreements with nuclear-armed
countries]{.mark} such as China]{.underline}. [Other issues, such as the
[Arctic and cyber security]{.mark}, in which both the U.S. and Russia
are decisive players, [could be future issues both countries bilaterally
resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rapprochement is in the long-term
interests of both countries. For Russia, its demographic crisis will be
exacerbated by the war as more of its young men come home in coffins.
With fewer young men comes fewer workers, leading to economic stagnation
and recession, worsened by global sanctions. Rapprochement could mean
the difference between further stagnation and sustainable demographic
and economic growth. For the U.S., rapprochement with Russia can help
ease demand on a country with limited military and diplomatic resources.
It can allow the U.S. to finally accomplish its pivot towards Asia, a
wishful goal since the early 2010s. And rapprochement may prevent a
formal Sino-Russian alliance, which would both be a geopolitical
disaster for the U.S. and push the world towards a third global
catastrophe. [[If U.S.-Russian relations continue to deteriorate, the
risk of nuclear war will increase]{.underline}]{.mark}. While
rapprochement will not happen until the war in Ukraine concludes, [it is
both countries' moral duty to get there eventually. Both sides can
choose not to be enemies. [They can cooperate when their interests are
aligned and effectively communicate when opposed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The [recent agreement between]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Russia]{.mark} to restore full
diplomatic relations [marks a **significant milestone**]{.mark} in
global geopolitics.]{.underline} The talks held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
facilitated by senior officials from both nations, signal the end of
years of diplomatic estrangement. This development not only represents a
shift in U.S. foreign policy under President Donald Trump but also
reaffirms Russia\'s role as a global power. By acknowledging Russian
political influence and engaging in direct negotiations, [the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has set the
stage for a transformed world order]{.mark} where cooperation prevails
over confrontation.]{.underline} Why Were Diplomatic Relations Broken?
The diplomatic rupture between Washington and Moscow began in 2016 with
U.S. accusations of Russian interference in the presidential elections.
Tensions escalated further in 2018 when the U.S. expelled Russian
diplomats over allegations of poisoning a former Russian intelligence
officer in the United Kingdom. However, the breaking point came in 2022,
after the start of Russia\'s special military operation in Ukraine. In
response, the United States imposed harsh sanctions, expelled Russian
envoys, and restricted the operations of Russian diplomatic missions.
These measures triggered reciprocal actions from Moscow, leaving both
embassies understaffed and bilateral relations at an all-time low.
Negative Impacts of Severed Diplomatic Ties The deterioration of
U.S.-Russia relations had severe consequences, affecting not just the
two nations but the entire global community: Lack of Communication: With
diplomatic missions largely inoperative, direct dialogue between the two
nuclear powers was nearly impossible, increasing the risk of
miscalculations and conflicts. Geopolitical Fragmentation: The hostility
between the U.S. and Russia deepened global divisions, particularly in
Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine disrupted political and economic
stability. Economic Consequences: Trade restrictions and sanctions
significantly affected global markets, particularly in energy and
agriculture, leading to inflation and supply chain disruptions. Military
Escalation: The absence of direct negotiations fueled military
confrontations in Ukraine, increasing the human and financial costs.
Global Security Concerns: The lack of U.S.-Russia engagement exacerbated
conflicts in Syria, the Arctic, and other strategic regions, affecting
global security frameworks. [The Benefits of Restoring Diplomatic
Relations]{.underline} With the agreement fully restoring diplomatic
functions, [a new chapter in U.S.-Russia relations has begun.
[This]{.mark} move [carries **significant benefits:**]{.mark} [Ending
the Ukraine Conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} on Russian Terms: The Riyadh
[talks indicate a [shift toward a realistic resolution]{.mark} of the
conflict in Ukraine. [With]{.mark} President [Trump prioritizing
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline} over prolonged military engagement, the
conflict is likely to conclude in a manner favorable to Russia. This
means Ukraine will not join NATO, and Russia's territorial gains will be
acknowledged. Erosion of NATO's Influence: With the U.S. signaling a
reduced commitment to European security, NATO's role is set to diminish.
This shift aligns with Russia's long-standing objective of limiting
Western military presence near its borders. [[Economic
Revival]{.underline}]{.mark}: The resumption of diplomatic ties is
expected to lead to the [lifting of sanctions, [allowing Russia to
reintegrate]{.mark} into global trade networks. This [will benefit

#### U.S.-Russia relations key to reduce cyberattacks

If quitting China is too expensive for [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, it
still [has]{.underline} three, much less expensive [ways it [can
enhance]{.mark} [US security: discontinuing cyber attacks, ending
nuclear targeting of US cities and military assets,]{.mark} and dropping
support for US adversaries.]{.underline} The first two are especially
easy because they do not involve third parties. Putting [a stop to
Russia's persistent and damaging cyber-attacks on the US]{.underline}
private sector [and]{.underline} critical [infrastructure would
produce]{.underline} immediate [security and economic
benefits]{.underline} [for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.
This cyber standdown would also have to include ransomware attacks by
so-called private gangs based in or supported by Russia. To this point,
US cyber defense companies report that Russian hacking continues
unabated. [Russia could]{.underline} also [easily improve US security by
ending its targeting of the United States with nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} Maybe this is the plan, but again, thus far,
Russia continues to deploy more than 1700 nuclear weapons, targeted
mostly at Americans. [Russia could also stop backing US
adversaries]{.underline}, including [Iran and North Korea]{.underline}.
Russian [pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear program and cease its
support for terrorism would be of great benefit to the United
States]{.underline} and could be the beginning of a grand bargain with
Iran and a complete remaking of the Middle East. However, Iran's Supreme
Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ruled out any possibility of a deal with
the United States. Similarly, it seems improbable that Putin will try to
convince Kim Jong-un to abandon North Korea's nuclear program, given
that Putin owes North Korea for its contribution of troops and supplies
for the war in Ukraine. Even if Putin did agree to press Kim, Putin has
nothing to offer North Korea to go along with a deal except subsidized
energy, and Russia can little afford to subsidize anyone. Prosperity In
theory[, [the new relationship with Russia could also benefit the US
economically]{.mark}]{.underline}, but the path to this result is
difficult to discern. Russia would not appear to offer much that the
United States needs. US GDP in 2023 was almost \$28 trillion. Russia's
official GDP was \$2 trillion, and that is certainly an exaggeration, as
dictatorships grossly overstate their economic wealth and income
statistics. Moreover, as the Trump Administration seeks to redress trade
imbalances, Russia is not a significant market for US goods. Trade
between the United States and Russia in 2024 was valued at \$3.5
billion, a relative pittance. For context, in 2024, US trade with the EU
in goods alone (no services, which add another 50 percent) was almost
\$1 trillion, or 285 times the volume of trade with Russia. Of course,
sanctions are part of the reason for this low level of trade with
Russia, but even absent sanctions, Russia is simply too small a market
to make a difference in the US balance of trade.

#### Cyberattacks go nuclear.

Control Association. "Cyber Battles, Nuclear Outcomes? Dangerous New
Pathways to Escalation."

Another initiative incorporated in the strategy document also aroused
concern: the claim that [[a]{.mark}n enemy [cyberattack on]{.mark} U.S.
nuclear]{.underline} command, control, and communications
(N[[C3]{.underline}]{.mark}) facilities [[would]{.mark} constitute a
"non-nuclear strategic attack" of sufficient magnitude to **[justify the
use of nuclear weapons]{.mark}** in response.]{.underline}

Under the Obama administration's NPR report, released in April 2010, the
circumstances under which the United States would consider responding to
non-nuclear attacks with nuclear weapons were said to be few. "The
United States will continue to...reduce the role of nuclear weapons in
deterring non-nuclear attacks," the report stated. Although little was
said about what sort of non-nuclear attacks might be deemed severe
enough to justify a nuclear response, cyberstrikes were not identified
as one of these. The 2018 NPR report, however, portrayed a very
different environment, one in which nuclear combat is seen as
increasingly possible and in which non-nuclear strategic threats,
especially in cyberspace, were viewed as sufficiently menacing to
justify a nuclear response. Speaking of Russian technological progress,
for example, the draft version of the Trump administration's NPR report
stated, "To...correct any Russian misperceptions of advantage, the
president will have an expanding range of limited and graduated
\[nuclear\] options to credibly deter Russian nuclear or non-nuclear
strategic attacks, which could now include attacks against U.S. NC3, in
space and cyberspace."1

The notion that a cyberattack on U.S. digital systems, even those used
for nuclear weapons, would constitute sufficient grounds to launch a
nuclear attack was seen by many observers as a dangerous shift in
policy, greatly increasing the risk of accidental or inadvertent nuclear
escalation in a crisis. "The entire broadening of the landscape for
nuclear deterrence is a very fundamental step in the wrong direction,"
said former Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz. "I think the idea of
nuclear deterrence of cyberattacks, broadly, certainly does not make any
sense."2

Despite such admonitions, the Pentagon reaffirmed its views on the links
between cyberattacks and nuclear weapons use when it released the final
version of the NPR report in February 2018. The official text now states
that the president must possess a spectrum of nuclear weapons with which
to respond to "attacks against U.S. NC3," and it identifies cyberattacks
as one form of non-nuclear strategic warfare that could trigger a
nuclear response.

That cyberwarfare had risen to this level of threat, the 2018 NPR report
indicated, was a product of the enhanced cybercapabilities of potential
adversaries and of the creeping obsolescence of many existing U.S. NC3
systems. To overcome these vulnerabilities, it called for substantial
investment in an upgraded NC3 infrastructure. Not mentioned, however,
were extensive U.S. efforts to employ cybertools to infiltrate and
potentially incapacitate the NC3 systems of likely adversaries,
including Russia, China, and North Korea.

For the past several years, the U.S. Department of Defense has been
exploring how it could employ its own very robust cyberattack
capabilities to compromise or destroy enemy missiles from such states as
North Korea before they can be fired, a strategy sometimes called "left
of launch."3 Russia and China can assume, on this basis, that their own
launch facilities are being probed for such vulnerabilities, presumably
leading them to adopt escalatory policies such as those espoused in the
2018 NPR report. Wherever one looks, therefore, the links between
cyberwar and nuclear war are growing.

The Nuclear-Cyber Connection

These links exist because [the N[C3]{.mark} systems of the United States
and other nuclear-armed states are **heavily dependent on computers and
other digital processors**]{.underline} for virtually every aspect of
their operation [and]{.underline} because those systems [[are **highly
vulnerable**]{.mark} **to cyberattack**. Every nuclear force is
composed]{.underline}, most basically, [of weapons, early-warning
radars, launch facilities, and the top officials]{.underline}, usually
presidents or prime ministers, empowered to initiate a nuclear exchange.
[Connecting them all, however, is an extended network of communications
and data-processing systems, all reliant on **cyberspace**. Warning
systems, ground- and space-based, must constantly watch for and analyze
possible enemy missile launches. Data on actual threats must rapidly be
communicated to decision-makers]{.underline}, who must then weigh
possible responses and communicate chosen outcomes to launch facilities,
which in turn must provide attack vectors to delivery systems. [All of
this involves operations in **cyberspace**, and it is in **this domain
that [great power rivals seek vulnerabilities]{.mark}** to exploit in a
constant struggle for advantage.]{.underline}

The use of cyberspace to gain an advantage over adversaries takes many
forms and is not always aimed at nuclear systems. China has been accused
of engaging in widespread cyberespionage to steal technical secrets from
U.S. firms for economic and military advantages. [**[Russia]{.mark}**
has been accused]{.underline}, most extensively in the Robert Mueller
report, [of exploiting cyberspace to interfere in the 2016 U.S.
presidential election. Nonstate actors]{.underline}, including terrorist
groups such as al Qaeda and the Islamic State group, [have used the
internet for recruiting combatants and spreading fear. Criminal
groups]{.underline}, including some thought to be allied with state
actors, such as North Korea, [have used cyberspace to extort money from
banks, municipalities, and individuals]{.underline}.4 Attacks such as
these occupy most of the time and attention of civilian and military
cybersecurity organizations that attempt to thwart such attacks. Yet
[for those who worry about **[strategic stability]{.mark} and the [risks
of nuclear escalation]{.mark}**, it is the threat of **[cyberattacks
on]{.mark} N[C3]{.mark} systems** that [provoke]{.mark}s the
[great]{.mark}est [concern]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This concern stems from the fact that, despite the immense effort
devoted to protecting NC3 systems from cyberattack, no enterprise that
relies so extensively on computers and cyberspace can be made 100
percent invulnerable to attack. This is so because such systems employ
many devices and operating systems of various origins and vintages, most
incorporating numerous software updates and "patches" over time,
offering multiple vectors for attack. Electronic components can also be
modified by hostile actors during production, transit, or insertion; and
the whole system itself is dependent to a considerable degree on the
electrical grid, which itself is vulnerable to cyberattack and is far
less protected. Experienced "cyberwarriors" of every major power have
been working for years to probe for weaknesses in these systems and in
many cases have devised cyberweapons, typically, malicious software
(malware) and computer viruses, to exploit those weaknesses for military
advantage.5

Although activity in cyberspace is much more difficult to detect and
track than conventional military operations, enough information has
become public to indicate that the major nuclear powers, notably China,
Russia, and the United States, along with such secondary powers as Iran
and North Korea, have established extensive cyberwarfare capabilities
and engage in offensive cyberoperations on a regular basis, often aimed
at critical military infrastructure. "Cyberspace is a contested
environment where we are in constant contact with adversaries," General
Paul M. Nakasone, commander of the U.S. Cyber Command (Cybercom), told
the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2019. "We see near-peer
competitors \[China and Russia\] conducting sustained campaigns below
the level of armed conflict to erode American strength and gain
strategic advantage."

Although eager to speak of adversary threats to U.S. interests, Nakasone
was noticeably but not surprisingly reluctant to say much about U.S.
offensive operations in cyberspace. He acknowledged, however, that
Cybercom took such action to disrupt possible Russian interference in
the 2018 midterm elections. "We created a persistent presence in
cyberspace to monitor adversary actions and crafted tools and tactics to
frustrate their efforts," he testified in February. According to press
accounts, this included a cyberattack aimed at paralyzing the Internet
Research Agency, a "troll farm" in St. Petersburg said to have been
deeply involved in generating disruptive propaganda during the 2016
presidential elections.6

Other press investigations have disclosed two other offensive operations
undertaken by the United States. One called "Olympic Games" was intended
to disrupt Iran's drive to increase its uranium-enrichment capacity by
sabotaging the centrifuges used in the process by infecting them with
the so-called Stuxnet virus. Another left of launch effort was intended
to cause malfunctions in North Korean missile tests.7 Although not aimed
at either of the U.S. principal nuclear adversaries, those two attacks
demonstrated a willingness and capacity to conduct cyberattacks on the
nuclear infrastructure of other states.

Efforts by strategic rivals of the United States to infiltrate and
eventually degrade U.S. nuclear infrastructure are far less documented
but thought to be no less prevalent. Russia, for example, is believed to
have planted malware in the U.S. electrical utility grid, possibly with
the intent of cutting off the flow of electricity to critical NC3
facilities in the event of a major crisis.8 Indeed, every major power,
including the United States, is believed to have crafted cyberweapons
aimed at critical NC3 components and to have implanted malware in enemy
systems for potential use in some future confrontation.

Pathways to Escalation

Knowing that the NC3 systems of the major powers are constantly being
probed for weaknesses and probably infested with malware designed to be
activated in a crisis, what does this say about the risks of escalation
from a nonkinetic battle, that is, one fought without traditional
weaponry, to a kinetic one, at first using conventional weapons and
then, potentially, nuclear ones? None of this can be predicted in
advance, but those analysts who have studied the subject worry about the
emergence of dangerous new pathways for escalation. Indeed, several such
scenarios have been identified.9

[The]{.underline} first and possibly [most dangerous path to escalation
would arise from the early use of cyberweapons in a great power
crisis]{.underline} to paralyze the vital command, control, and
communications capabilities of an adversary, many of which serve nuclear
and conventional forces. [[In the "fog of war]{.mark}" that would
naturally ensue from such an encounter, [the
recipient]{.mark}]{.underline} of such an attack [[might]{.mark} fear
more punishing follow-up kinetic attacks, possibly including the use of
nuclear weapons, and, fearing the loss of its own arsenal,
**[launch]{.mark} its [weapons immediately]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
might occur, for example, in a confrontation between NATO and Russian
forces in east and central Europe or between U.S. and Chinese forces in
the Asia-Pacific region.

Speaking of a possible confrontation in Europe, for example, James N.
Miller Jr. and Richard Fontaine wrote that "both sides would have
overwhelming incentives to go early with offensive cyber and
counter-space capabilities to negate the other side's military
capabilities or advantages." If these early attacks succeeded, "it could
result in huge military and coercive advantage for the attacker." This
might induce the recipient of such attacks to back down, affording its
rival a major victory at very low cost. Alternatively, however, the
recipient might view the attacks on its critical command, control, and
communications infrastructure as the prelude to a full-scale attack
aimed at neutralizing its nuclear capabilities and choose to strike
first. "It is worth considering," Miller and Fontaine concluded, "how
even a very limited attack or incident could set both sides on a
slippery slope to rapid escalation."10

[What makes the insertion of latent malware]{.underline} in an
adversary's NC3 systems [so dangerous is that it may not even need to be
activated to increase the risk of nuclear escalation. If a nuclear-armed
state comes to believe that its critical systems are infested with enemy
malware, its leaders might not trust the information]{.underline}
provided by its early-warning systems in a crisis and might misconstrue
the nature of an enemy attack, [leading them to overreact and possibly
**launch their nuclear weapons out of fear**]{.underline} they are at
risk of a preemptive strike.

"The **[[uncertainty]{.mark} caused by]{.underline}** the unique
character of **[a cyber threat [could jeopardize]{.mark} the credibility
of the [nuclear deterrent]{.mark} and undermine strategic
stability]{.underline}** in ways that advances in nuclear and
conventional weapons do not," Page O. Stoutland and Samantha
Pitts-Kiefer wrote in 2018 paper for the Nuclear Threat Initiative.
["\[T\]he introduction of a flaw or malicious code into nuclear weapons
through the supply chain that compromises the effectiveness of those
weapons could lead to a **lack of confidence in the nuclear deterrent,"
undermining strategic stability**]{.underline}.11 [Without
confidence]{.underline} in the reliability of its nuclear weapons
infrastructure, [[a]{.mark} nuclear-armed [state may **misinterpret
confusing signals**]{.mark}]{.underline} from its early-warning systems
[and, fearing the worst, **[launch its]{.mark} own [nuclear
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} rather than lose them to an enemy's first
strike. [This makes]{.underline} the scenario proffered in the 2018 NPR
report, of [a nuclear response to an enemy cyberattack, that much more
alarming]{.underline}.

#### Resource exploitation in the Arctic represent a new wave of colonialism- erasing indigenous culture and territory

Recently, [the Arctic]{.underline} began to be [treated as a
"geopolitical hotspot" and]{.underline} as a ["resource
frontier."]{.underline} The region's international (i.e., interstate)
dynamics has been drawing the attention of [scholars and
policymakers]{.underline} seeking to make sense (and [take advantage)
of]{.underline} emerging [geopolitical and economic phenomena in the
region.]{.underline} One of the main drivers of such efforts is the
so-called Arctic resource boom -- an enhanced knowledge on the resource
endowment of Arctic seas and lands, especially in terms of the presence
of hydrocarbon and mineral reserves. Since the publication of the
Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal in 2008, such knowledge of the region
has only increased, and triggered a plethora of economic development
projects for the region -- most geared towards making the commercial
exploitation of such resources viable. Such plans, typical of
[neo-extractivist modes of development and capital
accumulation]{.underline},1) [demand]{.underline} new instruments and
technologies of [control over land]{.underline}, territory [and
resources]{.underline} -- not only in [enabling]{.underline} the
[resource exploitation]{.underline}, but also in [displacing Arctic
Indigenous populations]{.underline} that inhabit spaces where
resource-based economic activity is meant to take place. This process
has been coupled with a range of practices aimed at controlling space
and mobilities in indigenous lands -- what DuPlessis calls "striation
activities". 2) Theorizations and debates on the [Arctic resource
boom]{.underline} or on the geopolitical tensions rising in the region
[are]{.underline} generally [oblivious to indigenous political
projects]{.underline}, institutions and articulations in the region.
This erasure takes the colonial violence underlying the relation between
Arctic States and Arctic indigenous peoples out of sight, [obscuring the
violent history of expropriation underpinning contemporary Arctic
geopolitics and economic development.]{.underline} Another [effect
of]{.underline} [such perspectives]{.underline} [is the presentation of
the Arctic as an "empty" space]{.underline}, devoid of people, social
dynamics and politics other than those developed and brought by
Westphalian States.3) This position [seeks to justify State
interventions in the region for "properly" seizing emerging economic and
strategic opportunities]{.underline} -- [with little to no regard for
indigenous cultures]{.underline} and subsistence in the Arctic, nor to
the already sensible effects of climate change in the region. The
present article seeks to frame the "Arctic resource boom" as a new wave
of Arctic settler colonialism. We argue that, although [projects for
resource exploitation]{.underline} of the Arctic are achieving
unprecedented scale, they [represent a continuity of the colonial
project, benefitting from the way previous waves of colonization have
shaped and reshaped Arctic]{.underline} spaces and the relations between
Indigenous peoples and their traditional territories. Our discussion is
focused on the impacts of colonialism over the Beringian portion of
Inuit Nunaat -- the Inuit homeland -- and the impacts of colonialism
over the relation between State, indigenous peoples and Arctic spaces.
Then we move on to a discussion of the Arctic resource boom and the
strategic and development projects emerging in the Arctic policies of
littoral states and their treatment of indigenous issues amid economic
and strategic pressures to carve out new extractive enclaves in Arctic
territories. We depart from a historical account of Arctic colonialism,
seeking to understand how the colonial encounter between Inuit and
Euro-American populations and the importance of resource extraction
shaped contemporary Arctic spaces -- from baleen and whale oil to the
gold rush and discovery of hydrocarbons. One important element here is
to understand how this first moment of colonialism set up the conditions
for modern-day resource development projects. The discussion, then,
turns to [contemporary economic development projects in the
Arctic]{.underline}, understanding them [as]{.underline}
[neo-extractivist enterprises]{.underline} -- i.e., enterprises [that
rely heavily on resource development and control over space]{.underline}
in a late capitalist globalized economy. As such, these projects
represent a geographical expansion of extractive frontiers in a global
scale, seeking new resource reserves and to reshape space to make them
commercially viable. [This represents a new wave of
colonialism]{.underline} -- i.e., of [attempts by state and capital to
enhance control over traditional indigenous territories]{.underline} --
and a new wave of threats and attempts at dispossessing Arctic
Indigenous Peoples from their rights to their traditional lands and
livelihoods.

#### Western Arctic exploration cements colonialism- reshaping indigenous relationship between nature

**Silva 22;** Brazilian researcher and PhD student at the Institute of
International Relations of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de
Janeiro (IRI/PUC-Rio); The Old Colonialisms and the New Ones: The Arctic
Resource Boom as a New Wave of Settler-Colonialism; The Arctic

<https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/old-colonialisms-new-ones-arctic-resource-boom-new-wave-settler-colonialism/>;
jw

While [contemporary projects of economic development in the
Arctic]{.underline} have reached new scales and exploit new resource
frontiers, they [are closely related to the continuity of 'old' Arctic
colonialisms]{.underline}. In their development, the [perpetuation of
the settler-colonial logic of capitalist economic development coupled
with reasons of the Euro-American polities that claim the Arctic as part
of their territory constitute the basis of 'Arctic
geopolitics']{.underline}. Another new element is the growing importance
of the Arctic as a geopolitical hotspot in world politics. While
economic reasons are an important driver for territorial reorganizations
in the Arctic, national security and defence issues also play an
important part in such processes. The reorganization of military
structures and the redefinition of military strategies and objectives in
the Arctic -- seen in Russia, in the US and Canada, encompassing all of
the Inuit homeland -- points to a tendency of increased control being
exercised over hyperborean spaces by States.

The emergence of neo-extractivist capitalist development21) might be the
defining feature of emerging Arctic colonialisms. [Neo-extractivist
capital accumulation is characterized by pressure over natural resources
and the demand for greater capitalist control over space]{.underline},
reinforcing a relationship between humanity and nature based on the
economic value of land and natural resources. While [colonial projects
attempt to recast themselves as necessary in the face of external
threats or as the reasonable way of seizing the Arctic resource
boom]{.underline}, their objectives are [similar to those of old
colonialisms]{.underline}: [subsume indigenous territories and
subjectivities under the logic of capitalist accumulation and extending
State (and capital) control over the populations that inhabit
them]{.underline}. It is possible to note that, if their scale and
methods are somehow different from eighteenth and nineteenth century
colonialisms, they still represent a continuity of the colonial project.
Moreover, the long history of the nefarious impacts of colonialism and
the deep disarticulation it brought to the Inuit peoples allowed the
erasure of indigenous presences and the emergence of 'empty Arctic'
narratives -- used by both neo-extractivist capitalism and the
national-territorial State in legitimizing the rationale behind such
projects.

Another important aspect of the [colonial project]{.underline} in Inuit
Nunaat (and, in fact, in many other colonized regions), brilliantly
explored in Demuth's work, is the [remodel]{.underline}ling of the
[relation between humanity and nature in colonized spaces]{.underline}.
Be it with land, the sea, sea ice or animals, capitalism as a mode of
production, and neo-extractivism as a path of economic development under
such system, [demand the construction of an instrumental relation to
these non-human elements of the environment]{.underline}. This
understanding entails a relation between human and non-human nature
developed under the mediation of value and valorisation -- the main
goals of capital accumulation and economic activity under capitalist
relations of production. This forecloses a range of different social
practices, seen as something to be moulded under the logic and
temporality of (capitalist) economic practices. While Demuth discusses
how Beringian cultures in general did not have stark distinctions
between humanity and non-humanity, Shadian, on the other hand,
highlights how such relations, among the Inuit are expressed through the
concept of inua. [Rather than seeing man as a separate of and dominating
nature, Inuit populations understood themselves not only as part of
nature, but also as]{.underline} being [stewards of the non-human nature
and of their homelands and home-environments.]{.underline}

In the present text we focused on how Arctic colonialisms came to be and
the technologies [they employed in the attempt of disarticulating Inuit
livelihoods, their social and cultural practices]{.underline}; this is
not the only history to be told. The Inuit -- and, in fact Indigenous
peoples in the Arctic and in the world -- have a long history of
resistance to and struggle against colonialism. The Inuit Circumpolar
Council is an institution born of such efforts and, to this day, it
disputes the contents and objectives of Arctic policies through the
development of its own political instruments and Arctic policies in many
dimensions. Rejecting the acritical acceptance of policies based on
settler-colonial understandings of Arctic geopolitics and economic
development, the ICC articulates understandings of autonomy,
self-government and economic development other than those deployed by
settler-colonial, capitalist, westphalian States.

[[Indigenous peoples have inhabited the Arctic]{.mark} since time
immemorial, [establishing rich]{.mark} regional [cultures and governance
systems]{.mark} long before the introduction of modern
borders]{.underline}. The Arctic Institute's 2022 Colonialism Series
explores the colonial histories of Arctic nations and the still-evolving
relationships between settler governments and Arctic Indigenous peoples
in a time of renewed Arctic exploration and development. Often, security
policies are framed as neutral decisions that are made for the benefit
of the entire population. However, a history of colonialism influences
those policies. For whom are security policies created? Who decides how
security threats and solutions are defined and implemented? [[Ignoring
colonial history]{.mark} when thinking more seriously about how states
behave particularly in the Arctic -- [is a foolhardy
approach]{.mark}.]{.underline} This brief article will look at how
Arctic security policies -- in [[the US]{.mark}, Canada, and Norway --
[rely on colonial hierarchies and power relations to reinforce a
worldview that]{.mark} consistently [puts Western needs and
conceptualizations of security as primary]{.mark}]{.underline}. When
these state-level security policies do not consider colonialism, [[they
miss]{.mark} consequences such as [the prioritization of economic and
national security needs over human]{.mark}, the [historic ignorance of
climate change as a security threat]{.mark}, [and the lack of]{.mark}
current [acknowledgement of food and societal
insecurities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Security policies across the United
States, Canada, and Norway In contrast to its allies Canada and Norway[,
the United States is very much a late player to the Arctic security
table]{.underline}. Most current U.S. Arctic security policies have been
published since 2019. However, the vast array of policies across all
areas of their government points towards a distinct focus on national
state-based security.1) What they all have in common is an overarching
emphasis on threats coming from Russia and China -- more broadly, nation
state competition. While some documents address broader trends such as
climate change and how that is making the Arctic more navigable -- it is
discussed in the context of this competition. In Blue Arctic -- the US
Navy's Strategic Blueprint (2021), for example, second paragraph of the
introduction opens the document by claiming: "In the decades ahead,
[rapidly [melting sea ice and increasingly navigable Arctic
waters]{.mark}]{.underline} -- a Blue Arctic -- [[will create new
challenges and opportunities]{.mark} off our northern
shores]{.underline}. [Without sustained American naval presence and
partnerships in the Arctic region, peace and prosperity will be
increasingly challenged by Russia and China, whose interests and values
differ dramatically from ours]{.underline}." Thus, in many ways, this
type of [[Arctic security]{.underline}]{.mark} approach [[takes bigger
questions of global geopolitical competition and focuses on the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} as one theater of many. What is easy to miss
without considering the role that colonial thinking plays in these
policies is that the American approach to the Arctic is founded on ideas
of state security rather than the security of individuals. [[There
is]{.underline}]{.mark} hardly any mention of [[increasing food
insecurity of Americans in Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} throughout these
documents, nor do the documents touch on questions of permafrost2) [[and
infrastructure concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, the United States
is certainly not alone in this privileging of Western conceptions of
security. Canada takes a very different approach to Arctic security,
although in some ways quite like the United States. In 2010, for
example, Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy adopted a traditional
sovereignty approach that focused on protecting their borders. However,
after much negotiation and collaboration, the Trudeau government
established the Arctic and Northern Policy Framework in 2019.3) This
framework takes a much different approach to security. Rather than the
traditional state-based security of the United States, the framework
more broadly defines security as including, for example, access to
health, energy, and education, with statements such as "Canadian
leadership will be advanced bilaterally and in multilateral forums in
order to promote Canadian values and interests such as human and
environmental security" with large portions of the document dedicated to
food and energy security. It additionally includes statements touching
on the longstanding impacts of colonialism in the Arctic and climate
change as a serious national security threat. However, according to
commentators, the framework -- while it may use the right language --
doesn't fundamentally change how Canada acts in the Arctic in terms to
its security. According to Rob Huebert, for example, the Trudeau policy
is "nothing new."4) In similar fashion to the United States,
[[security]{.mark} is thought of in this policy as something that is
obtained for the state and individual security [is framed through
achieving economic safety rather than through prioritizing the security
of Indigenous]{.mark} or local [values and needs]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Norway has a relatively similar approach to Canada when it comes to its
Arctic Policy, published in 2021.5) There is a focus on cooperation and
climate change as the two main pillars through which the Norwegian
government frames its security, with the document opening with the two
sentences: "Norway's Arctic policy revolves around security, stability,
and interest-based international cooperation. For us, foreign and
domestic policy converge in the Arctic." Rather than looking at it
through a lens of geopolitical competition, much of the policy focuses
on domestic issues such as economic growth, future-oriented jobs, and
the societal security of Indigenous communities such as the Sami.
However, it does recognize Russia's military buildup in the region and
points to NATO as one key for maintaining security. What some Indigenous
commentators note, regardless, is that in using Western ideas of
security and progress, Norway may promote ideas of green colonialism.6)
Green colonialism is defined as programs that promote 'green'
development but that often comes at the expense of people living in
areas, for example, that see massive construction of wind farms. In
Norway, for example, the Sami have protested against wind farm
development7) because it not only infringes on their territory but also
threatens their livelihood because it disturbs reindeer populations that
they rely on for food and societal security. What that misses When these
state-level security policies aren't put into the broader context of
colonialism, any type of analysis misses the type of consequences that
such policies have on residential, particularly Indigenous, Arctic
residents. For example, the [U.S.]{.underline} and Canadian [[Arctic
security policies have often prioritized economic and national security
needs]{.mark} over the needs of people, [putting Arctic residents at
harm]{.mark} -- making a conscious decision to put the needs of the
economy over the needs of people]{.underline}. Residential schools
across Canada and in Alaska were often rationalized by claiming that
Indigenous youth would suffer from a lack of economic prosperity unless
they were helped by Western society. The implication relies heavily on
the idea that [[Western economic ideas of security were more important
than the needs of Indigenous children to grow up with their cultures and
families]{.underline}]{.mark}. It also had the dual impact of forcing
these children to assimilate -- many times violently -- into Western
culture. More broadly, past security strategies from national
governments have often ignored the role of climate change as a security
threat. Instead, these policies have focused on national state-level
security issues such as interstate conflict or transnational threats
that originate from terrorism. While these decisions have been framed as
neutral and the best-suited for the times, they are certainly not
neutral. [[Patterns of thinking from colonialism]{.mark}, particularly
the idea that humanity can and should conquer nature, [has led to a way
of thinking that deprioritizes the environment as a source of any
security concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today that is changing -- with
many governments addressing [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} as an
existential threat in the Arctic, However, even with this
acknowledgement, the only [[solutions]{.underline}]{.mark} that are
proposed [[are technocratic and solely reinforce neoliberalism]{.mark}
rather than a more ecological approach to security]{.underline}.
Moreover, none recognize the role that colonialism itself has had in
exacerbating climate change as a phenomenon. On a local level, and where
the influence of colonialism is the most insidious is how national
security policies focus on questions of state, economic and in some
cases climate, security but ignore local-level insecurities such as food
insecurity and societal insecurity. This is notable across the U.S.
security documents as there is clear evidence that [[climate change is
having consequential impacts on Indigenous communities' ability to find
their traditional sources of food, and their ability to maintain their
societal resiliency]{.underline}]{.mark}. Melting permafrost is even
forcing some communities to move their entire towns inland in what is
known as managed retreat.8) Choosing what to prioritize in a security
document is by no means neutral, and by leaving out questions of these
local-level existential security threats instead to focus on the threat
of Russia and China, these policies often imply what they find
important. Thus, [[a history of colonialism matters when considering
questions of security in the Arctic today]{.underline}]{.mark}, both in
the policies that are made by states as well as the types of security
that are conceptualized and prioritized. Their legacies influence how
security policy is formulated, what priorities are focused on, and what
populations matter. [[Rather than considering these policies and
approaches to Arctic security as neutral, we should instead think about
them within the broader historical context and acknowledge how deeply
rooted they are in colonial legacies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Arctic]{.mark} [states]{.mark} to the [prioriti]{.mark}zation
[of]{.mark} [nation]{.mark}al security threats]{.underline}, from the

realities]{.mark} of its past]{.underline} and present. Contributors to
the 2022 Colonialism Series highlight the diverse and lasting effects of
colonialism in the Arctic---as well as crucial steps forward in a region
of renewed interest. The [c[urrent era of Arctic
exploration]{.underline}]{.mark} [and development [poses]{.mark} new and
critical questions in the contexts of
([neo-)colonialis]{.mark}]{.underline}[m]{.mark}: Can settler
institutions in the Arctic, such as the Church of Sweden, navigate
reconciliation with local Indigenous populations? Can Arctic nations and
stakeholders establish inclusive climate change and development policy
that is sensitive to the needs of local communities? And how will
stakeholders such as China engage with Indigenous peoples as they
explore new interests in the Arctic? More than anything, the 2022
[[Colonialism Series identifies]{.mark} the [need for Indigenous
perspectives to be]{.mark} [integrated]{.mark} into contemporary visions
of Arctic development to avoid repeating colonial mistakes of the past.
[Climate and development challenges must be]{.mark} met with
interventions [appropriate]{.mark} for local communities.
[Reconciliation]{.mark} with Indigenous groups [must include
acknowledgement]{.mark} of past human rights violations [and]{.mark}
increased [paths towards self-determination for Arctic
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. And urban development must feature
inclusive and sustainable spaces that are accessible to diverse
populations. As an Arctic security scholar, widespread and increasing
interest in the region is an exciting prospect. A growing body of
scholarly literature offers novel insights into this critical area and
emerging Arctic policy provides evolving research landscapes to study.
However, the excitement of [[contemporary Arctic development must not
overshadow]{.mark} the existing [realities of]{.mark} the region: The
Arctic is the home of many peoples and has been since time immemorial[.
Political, economic, and cultural activitie]{.mark}s have effects on

future.

We define co-production of knowledge (CPK) as a process that brings
together Indigenous Peoples' knowledge systems and science to generate
[[new knowledge]{.mark} and understandings]{.underline} of the world
that [would likely [not be achieved through]{.mark} the application of
[only one knowledge system.]{.mark}]{.underline} Co-production of
knowledge emphasizes the importance of attaining equity in research
relationships. The value of a [[CPK]{.underline}]{.mark} approach, if
done appropriately and respectfully, is that it [[allows]{.mark} people
engaged in research to bring different ways of knowing, experiencing,
and looking at the world together to gain a broader, [deeper]{.mark},
and new [understanding]{.mark} of topics [and]{.mark} to [generate new
knowledge]{.mark}.]{.underline} A true [[CPK]{.mark} approach is
urgently [needed in]{.mark} the [Arctic to enhance]{.mark}]{.underline}
understanding and to inform adaptive and holistic [decision making in
research, resource management, and [policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
work we [[put forward]{.underline}]{.mark} builds upon the [experiences
of the co-authors, all that they have learned from Indigenous
communities,]{.underline} the work of the many colleagues working within
these and similar topics, [and the decades of [effort and work conducted
by Indigenous Peoples, communities, and
organizations.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}o-[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}roduction of
[[k]{.underline}]{.mark}nowledge [framework]{.underline} presented
includes tools and concepts designed to [assist researchers, decision
makers, and communities to [move toward]{.mark} the goal of [equitable
research.]{.mark} The Arctic is the homeland of over [1 million
Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} across 40 different Indigenous
cultural groups (Karvinen and Rantakallio 2019; Fig. 1). For thousands
of years, Indigenous Peoples have maintained strong cultural ties to
northern lands and waters. Over generations, [they [have]{.mark}
systematically [amassed]{.mark} knowledges with [extraordinary]{.mark}
and distinct [information]{.mark}]{.underline} about their worldviews
and the environments of which they are a part. These knowledge systems
are living and continue to be built upon today. [The
[application]{.mark} of these knowledges [offers great value]{.mark} to
those in and outside the Arctic [for]{.mark} addressing pressing
[contemporary concerns.]{.mark} The [Arctic]{.mark} environment is
rapidly changing]{.underline} (IPCC 2014, 2021) with many ongoing
transformations in Arctic social, economic, and ecological systems
(Marino and Ribot 2012, Chapin et al. 2014, IPCC 2014, Watson and
Huntington 2014, Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity
2017, Reidmiller et al. 2018, Carothers et al. 2019). These
transformations have led to increased attention on the Arctic region
from various interests including geopolitical, military, commercial,
industrial, research, and from large-scale international institutes
(e.g., Ellis and Brigham 2009, Ebinger et al. 2014, ADAC 2019, IPBES
2019, USCG 2019, IASC 2020, NSF 2020, Wilson Center 2020; United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change https://unfccc.int/). Research
activities in or about the Arctic tend to be directed toward efforts to
better understand the transformations taking place and to plan for
future adaptations through policy, management, or other decision making.
[Many of these efforts are directed by [legislation]{.mark} or agency
processes]{.underline} and priorities such as the Arctic Research and
Policy Act that directs the development of a five-year research plan
(APRA 1984). [[Not]{.mark} enough of this research is directed or
[guided by Indigenous communities, nor]{.mark} does it [equitably
include Indigenous]{.mark} Peoples' [knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}
systems, [[nor]{.mark} adequately [address]{.mark} the [needs and
concerns]{.mark} of communities. It is [important to recognize critical
issues]{.mark}]{.underline} shaping contemporary Arctic Indigenous
Peoples' rights, sovereignty, security, and self-determination to better
understand the need [[for building equity that centers Indigenous
Peoples' knowledge]{.mark}s and systems]{.underline} (e.g., governance,
social, political, etc.) across society. Building and [[attaining equity
is foundational to]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[c]{.underline}]{.mark}o-[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}roduction of
[[k]{.underline}]{.mark}nowledge framework. Equity in this context
refers to ensuring that space is fairly provided for all knowledge
systems and knowledge holders in an agreed upon research process. The
CPK framework we share includes a number of conceptual tools that we
believe collectively build toward and create equity (see Figs. 2, 3,
Table 1). The [[inequities experienced by Indigenous Peoples across
Arctic]{.mark} societies, which are manifested in current research
processes and relationships, [are rooted in]{.mark} the broader history
of [colonialism]{.mark}. The traumas and [inequities Indigenous Peoples
have endured]{.mark} directly [as a result of colonialism continue to
persist]{.mark} today.]{.underline} The history of colonialism within
Indigenous Peoples' homelands has included land dispossession,
epidemics, forced settlements, violent removal of children to boarding
schools, racism, and cultural and spiritual suppression (Napoleon 1996).
[Past inequities persist [in the form of inequitable research processes
and relationships across the Arctic.]{.mark} These inequitable processes
and relationships, [which prioritize non-Indigenous ways of being and
knowing]{.mark}, feed a structure of decision making that [does not
fully account for Indigenous Peoples']{.mark} knowledge, perspectives,
or [needs]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[New approaches]{.mark} to research
[are needed]{.mark} to]{.underline} address past and current inequities
that start with shared understandings of the historical and present
trauma experienced by Indigenous Peoples as well as using Indigenous
approaches to [address systematic problems]{.underline}. Developing
shared understandings and Indigenous approaches requires building a
foundation of equity through change in the dominant systems that govern
research and science activities today. We suggest that the [[CPK]{.mark}
framework can [guide us on a path to]{.mark} fostering this [equity
through]{.mark} constructive [change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Arctic, home to four million people ("Arctic Peoples" 2024), is the
planet\'s most rapidly warming region (Rantanen et al 2022). Climate
science has made significant strides in highlighting the experiences of
those most affected: Indigenous peoples of the Arctic. There are forty
different groups, from the Saami that spans across the European Arctic
to the Inuit, which are concentrated mainly in the North American and
Russian Arctic ("Arctic Communities" 2024). However, [a **[gap]{.mark}**
remains [between science and history]{.mark}]{.underline}, often
[**[overlooking]{.mark}** how [colonia]{.mark}lism and climate change
have exacerbated each other]{.underline}, [[harm]{.mark}ing Indigenous
communities]{.underline}. Central to these adverse effects is the
settler colonial state, represented by eight imperial governments:
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the
United States ("Arctic Peoples" 2024). By [[**examining** the state's
role in]{.mark} climate change and [the damaging]{.mark} environmental
[impacts of **colonialist policies**]{.mark}]{.underline}, I aim to
[[**confront** settler **amnesia** regarding]{.mark} the
interconnectedness of [Arctic]{.mark} warming and [colonial
history]{.mark}]{.underline}, revealing that these phenomena are far
more long-standing than previously acknowledged.

I will do this [through the [**framework** of]{.mark}]{.underline} David
Pellow's four pillars of **[[Critical Environmental
Justice]{.underline}]{.mark}**. David Naguib Pellow is a professor of
environmental studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara
("David Pellow" 2024). As a Black American scholar, his work focuses on
the intersections between race and environmental justice. He is the
author of the book What Is Critical Environmental Justice, where he
discusses environmentalism through the case studies of prison systems,
the Black Lives Matter movement and the Israeli occupation of Palestine
(Pellow 2017). Because Pellow defines the pillars of critical
environmental justice as the multiple categories of difference, a
multi-scalar analysis, [[how power is **entrenched**]{.mark} in
society]{.underline}, [and [**who** is]{.mark} deemed as
**[expendable]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Pellow 2017), this paper will
discuss:

1\) The multi-scalar analyses of the causes and details of environmental
struggles in the Arctic. This is done through [an interdisciplinary
analysis of ecology [and **racial justice**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and a
transnational approach to American Studies.

2\) How the [**settler state** control of the Arctic has been a driver
of]{.underline} both [climate change]{.underline} and climate science in
the region.

3\) [**Expendability** of the Indigenous people of the
Arctic]{.underline} and the nonhuman relations they rely upon for the
sake of increased state power.

The fourth pillar of [critical environmental justice]{.underline},
multiple categories of difference, [will be encompassed in our
overarching [understanding]{.mark} of [the state as an **agent** of
**white supremacy** and]{.mark} colonialism]{.underline}. This is
particularly true as all of the Arctic states are either colonial
empires and/or in the Global North (Silva 2022). Therefore we understand
[[the Arctic's position]{.mark} as a boon [for **state
power**]{.mark}]{.underline} that also [[makes it a site for critical
environmental **injustice**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Decolonization

[[Decolonization is the **intentional**]{.mark} and [**active** process
of **recognizing** and **counteracting
processes**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[structures]{.underline}**, [and
**institutions** imposed on Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Decolonization requires [**actively making room** for]{.mark}
[mechanisms that support]{.mark} Indigenous [cultures and **ways of
knowing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and which provide Indigenous Peoples and
organizations the opportunity to lead and direct research activities.

Indigenous Peoples have ways of knowing and understanding the world that
often differ from dominant western worldviews (Smith 1999, Bishop 2005,
Smith et al. 2016). Frameworks and processes (e.g., education, resource
management) have been imposed on Indigenous communities without
including, or by purposefully excluding, Indigenous ways of being and
knowing (Sahlins 2002, Stevenson 2004, Tuck and Wang 2012, Wildcat et
al. 2014). Many of these systems may have originated or were implemented
in the past, but the lived experiences of Indigenous Peoples today are
still rooted in these systems. Some governments recognize these past
injustices and are working toward building equity through decolonization
actions. For example, in Canada decolonization action was initiated
after Truth and Reconciliation (TRCC 2015, Government of Canada \[date
unknown\]).

[[Decol]{.mark}onization [in **Arctic research** means]{.mark} making
the [space to **include**]{.mark} Indigenous]{.underline} Peoples'
[worldviews in ways that]{.underline} can [direct and **guide**
research]{.underline}. Indigenous frameworks and processes are not
archaic but evolve over time and are alive today. Many myths about
Indigenous Peoples persist in large part due to academia (Younging
2018), but Indigenous Peoples are increasingly putting forward their own
narratives and voice. Indigenous Peoples have the right to freely choose
how decolonization manifests, including revitalization. In a CPK
process, [[Indigenous methodologies]{.mark} and processes will need to
be **equitably included**]{.underline} along with western practices,
norms, and scientific methods (Kovach 2009). Additionally, funding
processes and [university and agency **research** protocols will need to
be addressed]{.underline}, possibly through policy and regulation, in
the long term.

Sovereignty

Sovereignty is the inherent right of Indigenous Peoples to have
self-determination over their political, legal, social, spiritual, and
intellectual lives, as well as other aspects of a community or one's
self.

[[Arctic Indigenous Peoples live on]{.mark} and are connected to
[**ancestral** homelands and hold]{.mark} inherent [**sovereign** rights
and **self-determination**]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., the right to
choose freely). [[Researchers must **understand**]{.underline},
**[recognize]{.underline}**, [and **respect**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[Indigenous Peoples hold **sovereignty** over their homelands and have
spiritual connections]{.underline} to land, ice, and water. Often the
information derived from science is used to make decisions concerning
Indigenous homelands. Poorly conducted science can threaten sovereignty
for Indigenous Peoples. Aside from legal requirements, there are [moral
and societal **obligations** to respect]{.underline},
[recognize]{.underline}, [and support self-determination]{.underline}
including in decision making (supporting Indigenous sovereignty) by
Indigenous Peoples [about research]{.underline} activities in or [having
an impact on Indigenous homelands]{.underline}.

[[Indigenous **protocols**]{.underline}, **[ethical
codes]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [spiritual and
traditional [practices should be respected]{.mark}]{.underline} in
Indigenous Peoples' homelands. **[Free]{.underline}**,
**[prior]{.underline}**, [and **informed consent** guidance]{.underline}
is included in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(UN 2007) and can [help researchers]{.underline} better [understand and
support Indigenous sovereignty]{.underline} (ICC AK 2020). Indigenous
Peoples are free to decide if, how, and when they will be involved in
any research activities. Indigenous Peoples must be engaged in
discussions and decision making prior to the start of any activities,
from the very beginning (UN 2005). We refer to "the beginning" as the
first discussions about a proposed project or a researcher's interest in
a particular region. Initial conversations should include a mutual
understanding of needs related to Capacity and Means and Ability.
Indigenous Peoples need to be adequately informed of all potential risks
and opportunities, and costs and benefits associated with engaging in
any research activities, including the sharing of their knowledge (UN
2005). It is essential that researchers understand that Indigenous
Peoples' perceptions of risk may be different from how risk is assessed
from a western worldview. Indigenous partner's views should be included
in discussions to identify potential ways of addressing and mitigating
risk. Indigenous Peoples need to consent to all activities and processes
occurring and this should include the full and effective participation
of all Indigenous partners through the Indigenous communities' or
partners' own decision-making processes (UN 2005, Whyte 2019).

Empowerment

Equitable research relationships empower all participants and create a
balance of authority and responsibility in the process.

[Empowerment means]{.underline} creating and [[supporting]{.mark}
political and [**intellectual** space for Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} to
have **authority** and responsibility]{.underline}. It is necessary [[to
**recognize**]{.mark} and name the [power dynamics at
play]{.mark}]{.underline} in a relationship [and **[actively]{.mark}**
work to [create **balance**]{.mark} through the empowerment]{.underline}
of Indigenous Peoples. A truly equitable research relationship empowers
all participants in their work. This balance increases the authority of
the knowledge produced in a CPK process, because it is inclusive, more
robust, and representative of multiple knowledges.

The equitable inclusion of Indigenous communities in research has been a
challenge, in some part due to the unequal power dynamics at play in
typical research relationships (Nadasdy 1999, Schreiber and Newell 2006,
Raymond-Yakoubian and Raymond-Yakoubian 2015) and the history of
colonization (Huntington et al. 2020). Funders, policymakers, and
society in general, more commonly place a higher value on information
derived from science than information coming from Indigenous Peoples.
[[Recognizing]{.underline}]{.mark} that many [[**science-based**
approaches to research are predicated on a **western
worldview**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Smith et al. 2016) [[means]{.mark}
that [we should seek to take **deliberate** action to include]{.mark}
other perspectives]{.underline} in CPK (ICC AK 2020). [Supporting
equitable processes]{.underline}, [and valuing]{.underline} and
including [[Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark} Peoples'
[[knowledges]{.underline}]{.mark}, [requires **intentionally** working
to change existing systems]{.underline}.

The Contradictions of the State and Settler Scientists

As [[settlers]{.underline}]{.mark}, we have [historically

**[assimilationist]{.mark}**]{.underline} and polluting
[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}, and therefore [[the state's actions
**reflect** our own]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [[shifting]{.mark} of
[**responsibilities** should awaken settler]{.mark} colonial
**[amnesia]{.mark}** of those involved [in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is a phenomenon where [[people are
**not**]{.mark} **fully [aware]{.mark}** of the colonialism]{.underline}
that [[they **benefit**]{.mark} from]{.underline} (Said 1994). It can
manifest in [**[obscuring]{.mark}** the [**scale** of]{.mark} the
**[atrocities]{.mark}** or]{.underline} even flat-out
**[denial]{.underline}**. This misremembering [[leads to]{.mark} the

of [[colonialism]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} the creation of
[[**false justifications** for]{.mark} the
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. The settler scientific community is
particularly culpable, as [our [research]{.mark}]{.underline} into the
specific effects of climate change not only [**[ignores]{.mark}** our
[**own** role]{.mark} in creating]{.underline} such [ecological violence
[through]{.mark} our **[privileged membership]{.mark}** in the
state]{.underline}, but [also how our]{.underline} scientific [research
is]{.underline} often largely [**funded** by the state]{.underline}.

The National Science Foundation, established in 1950, is a federal
government agency of the United States that funds scientific research
("History," 2024).2 From the past fiscal year which started on October
1st, 2023 to September 30, 2024, the National Science Foundation (NSF)
was given 9.06 billion dollars. This funding is not solely for graduate
students but also undergraduates, academics and even companies, with the
requirement that they must be at least a permanent resident if not a
citizen. The National Science Foundation has supported the work of at
least 268 winners of the Nobel Prize. In 2024 alone, four of the six
prize categories were won by people who have received NSF funding ("NSF
Continues Strong Legacy with Nobel Prize Winners," 2024). This does not
include the multiple other government agencies in the United States that
fund scientific research, particularly the Department of Defense, the
Department of Energy and the Department of State.

Therefore it is not surprising that the vast majority of the [scientific
[studies]{.mark}]{.underline} cited in this paper are [[funded by the
**state**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This [[is]{.mark} functionally an
**[oxymoronic]{.mark}** system where [the state
pays]{.mark}]{.underline} largely [[**settler scientists** to]{.mark}
understand and [**critique** the]{.mark} [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}
that have been [[put]{.mark} into place **[by the
state]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is not to scorn or shame scientists
who receive federal funding. In fact, I myself hope to obtain a grant
from the United States government to pursue a master\'s degree in Arctic
climate ecology. As a researcher coming from a low-income background,
such funding would be an integral lifeline to my career. But in taking
funding from the state, scientists need to acknowledge that this fiscal
sponsorship for [**environmental [research]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} not
charity but]{.underline} rather [[a **continuation** of]{.mark}
the]{.underline} long [**legacy** of [scientists **acting as
agents**]{.mark} of the state]{.underline}, from the development of the
atomic bomb to the Cold War space race. Even the colonial developments
discussed in this paper such as the Early Distant Warning Line, oil and
gas extraction, and continental shelf claims would not have been
possible without scientists.

Equity

[[Equity refers to]{.mark} ensuring]{.underline} that
[**[space]{.mark}** is [fairly provided for **all knowledge**]{.mark}
systems]{.underline} and knowledge holders involved in an agreed-upon
process.

Equity is the cornerstone of a CPK approach. [Building equity begins
with [ensuring]{.mark}]{.underline} that both [knowledge systems start
from [a **level playing field**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Throughout the CPK
process, barriers to active participation need to be continuously
identified and removed. Meaningful and active engagement should be
supported for all parties throughout the entire process. Fairness in
terms of means, capacity, decision-making authority, and rights (for
example) are required if working within an equitable space.

Much of the structure of [contemporary [**Arctic research** is
**rooted** in colonialism]{.mark} and has resulted in **systemic
inequities**]{.underline}, often including the relationship between
research and Indigenous Peoples. [The
**[processes]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[procedures]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and funding mechanisms used [to
support research]{.underline}, **[[policy]{.mark}
development]{.underline}**, [[and decision making]{.underline}]{.mark}
were developed and [continue to be used to]{.underline} predominantly
[[address]{.mark} the questions]{.underline},
[**[desires]{.underline}**, [and **worldviews** of]{.underline}]{.mark}
a set of [[**dominant** cultures]{.mark} and scientific
disciplines]{.underline} that are [part [of]{.mark} contemporary
**settler-[colonial society]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Smith 1999, Cochran
et al. 2008, Ballantyne 2014, Simpson 2014, Raymond-Yakoubian and
Raymond-Yakoubian 2017, Brattland and Mustonen 2018, ICC AK 2018,
Pfeifer 2018, Büscher and Fletcher 2019). These processes, procedures,
structures, and approaches most often have not considered resemblant
ones that are used by Indigenous Peoples (Coombes et al. 2014, Larsen
and Johnson 2016, Whyte 2019, Whyte et al. 2019). To truly bring
together knowledge systems these systemic problems have to be addressed,
recognizing that not all knowledge systems have been equally respected
or assigned the same value (Berkes 1993, 2008, Nadasdy 1999, 2003a,
2003b, 2007, Usher 2000, David-Chavez and Gavin 2018, Latulippe and
Klenk 2020; Behe and Angnaboogok 2018
https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.12598.57928/1). Equitable approaches to
research can begin to address these systemic problems if they are
inclusive of the needs, worldviews, knowledge systems, and cultural
approaches of participants.

In the context of research, equity can be built in many ways and can
take many forms. Equity can be built through the sharing of
decision-making power or by ensuring that project budgets fairly
compensate all participants. Equity can be built by ensuring that
training or equipment needs are covered and through purposefully
inclusive sharing and discussions of knowledge. These actions, and
others described below, will contribute to equitable research practices.

[Building [equity requires a **paradigm shift** in]{.mark} thinking and
[**methodology** to create]{.mark} new]{.underline}, **[[inclusive
spaces]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Focusing on [[equity will aid
in]{.underline}]{.mark} building [robust research and
observing]{.underline} systems, adaptive decision making, [and
[**holistic** policies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Equity can be created
through the recognition and utilization of the conceptual tools in the
outer ring of our framework (i.e., relationships, empowerment, capacity,
means and ability, [**deliberate** and **intentional**]{.underline},
ethics, [decolonization]{.underline}, sovereignty, and trust and
respect). Throughout the paper, we identify the conceptual tools using
italics to further demonstrate their recursive nature and connectivity.
Each ring has unique but inter-connecting conceptual tools and actions.
These conceptual tools should be used when understanding research using
a CPK approach.

The outer ring: tools for undertaking research using a co-production of
knowledge framework

We identified a suite of concepts that build equity, called conceptual
tools, which should be used when undertaking research using a CPK
approach (Fig. 3).

Deliberate and Intentional

Every part of the co-production process requires Deliberate (thorough
and careful) and Intentional (by design) decision making to ensure that
the principle of equity and other conceptual tools are being
consistently applied.

[Everyone]{.underline} involved [must make a [**deliberate choice** to
be]{.mark} part of an **[intentional]{.mark}**]{.underline} CPK
[process]{.underline}. Co-production is a process that requires
deliberate consideration and intentional action; [[it is **not
possible**]{.mark} to do co-production "**[by
accident]{.mark}**."]{.underline} Researchers may use some of the tools
needed for co-production in their work (like Empowerment or Trust and
Respect), however [[using]{.underline}]{.mark} some of [[these tools is
**not** the same as **deliberately** and
**intentionally**]{.underline}]{.mark} collaboratively [[deciding to
engage]{.mark} in CPK]{.underline}.

Education Research Journal, 20 (1), 4.;
<https://doi.org/10.14324/HERJ.20.1.04>; Gavin

Based on recent research on the coloniality of historical knowledge in
the Arctic, this article examines the challenges and opportunities that
history education offers in terms of epistemic and cognitive justice
within the context of Arctic memory cultures (R. Petersen, 1978;
Reeploeg, 2021; Segato, 2022). The article begins by engaging with
Indigenous and postcolonial scholarship on how [[historical
thinking]{.underline}, [as a **methodology**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [can
**[currently]{.mark}** be defined as [an **unsustainable** and **unjust
epistemic** habit]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cutrara, 2018; Kuokkanen, 2008).
Using Arctic memory cultures as a research field, the article examines
[historical thinking and historical consciousness not as
separate]{.underline}, if overlapping, epistemic traditions concerned
with managing learning about the past. This [[risks becoming another
site of **sanctioned ignorance**]{.underline}, [which
**reproduces**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and forecloses [**colonialist
structures** through]{.mark} the [**purposeful silencing** of]{.mark}
particular [contexts as]{.mark}]{.underline} being
[**[irrelevant]{.mark}** or too difficult]{.underline} (Guha and Spivak,
1988). Instead, both are integrated into the wider field of memory
cultures that produce (not discover or evaluate) knowledge about the
past through a system of epistemic habits. In doing so, I suggest that
[[**unthinking** these]{.mark} epistemic [habits as part of
a]{.mark}]{.underline} more [nuanced [**critical pedagogical** praxis is
a **necessity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, if historical thinking is to
continue to be part of one of the basic competencies of historians and
educators.

History [education]{.underline} does not only [take place in educational
**institutions**]{.underline}, but also in museums, archives and
libraries, [and in public **discourses**]{.underline} and other sites of
collective memory (Ricoeur, 2010). These create and transmit a variety
of histories and memory cultures, becoming sites of learning about the
past (Carretero et al., 2012). Seen from this perspective, [[historical
thinking is]{.mark} part of a whole set of epistemic habits [closely
tied to]{.mark} the '[**cognitive empires**' of dominant **western**
epistemologies]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ndlovu-Gatsheni, 2021: 882): 'The
rise of [western empires resulted in a wider dissemination of western
knowledge]{.underline}, but also in [the destruction of]{.underline}
much [non-western knowledge]{.underline}, [[from the **burning** of
manuscripts]{.mark} by missionaries [to the **extinction** of]{.mark}
local [languages]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} (Burke, 2010: n.p.).

Seeing that Indigenous scholarship has always combined critical
pedagogical praxis with ways of thinking about the past (Berthelsen,
2020; Graugaard, 2016; Jensen Hansen, 2022; Møller and McLisky, 2021),
this article foregrounds Inuit and Inuit-oriented perspectives on the
coloniality of knowledge in the circumpolar world. (See Global Social
Theory \[n.d.\] for a definition of the concept of the coloniality of
knowledge.) [[Within the **Arctic**]{.mark} **context**]{.underline},
previous research has shown that '[an [understanding]{.mark} of [the
**coloniality** of knowledge and]{.mark} its [connections to **epistemic
violence** is crucial]{.mark}]{.underline} to the study of memory and
historical legacy' (Reeploeg, 2021: 1061). This article concludes that
much can be learned from (not about) Indigenous scholarship and praxis
in and about the Arctic, which has long combined thinking historically
with opportunities to seek epistemic justice and the restitution of
cultural memory.

Background, research approach and structure: controlling the cognitive
wildfire of coloniality

A new Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) framework (UNESCO,
2021: n.p.) aims to 'increase the contribution of education to building
a more just and sustainable world'. The 'Education for Sustainable
Development: Towards achieving the SDGs (ESD for 2030)' framework calls
for education to encourage changes in knowledge, skills, values and
attitudes to enable a more sustainable and just society for all. A
previous report by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on history and history education already
emphasised the importance of history for future-oriented policy in
education:

\[History\] can be a generative process for imagining futures which are
reparative rather than reproductive of injustices past and present.
These approaches to history involve processes of dialogue and exchange;
they are constituted through educational relationships and thus they
point to the ways in which education is a necessary precondition of
reparative address.

(Sriprakash et al., 2020: 6)

The authors here clearly call for education as a mode of transformation,
as well as an interrogation of the logic of diversity, integration and
reciprocity. This may require much more than an 'inclusive'
[recentering]{.underline} of [non-western ways of knowing]{.underline},
and it [must include **rethinking** the very structures on which western
epistemes are based]{.underline} (Kuokkanen, 2008). It must include
[disassembling structures of harm by decentering of **European
hegemonies** of knowledges]{.underline}, but also by interrogating
interlocking systems of epistemic domination and exploitation. In other
words: 'We all need to "buy in" through our personal philosophy,
informing our professional practice and our professional orientation. We
all need to understand the part we continue to play in the colonizing
process and indeed the decolonizing process' (McKenna et al., 2021: 5).

The combined desires for unity and fully knowing 'the other' have long
shaped history pedagogies, research programmes and government policies,
and they appear in the shape of embedded epistemic habits around being
and knowing (Jones and Jenkins, 2008). These in turn inform redemptive
fantasies and practices around equality and diversity aimed at
overcoming history without changing ongoing colonial relations. Jones
and Jenkins (2008), in a book chapter entitled 'Rethinking
collaboration: Working the Indigene-colonizer hyphen', explain the
demand for particular types of ongoing collaborative enquiry and
[**[redemptive gestures]{.mark}** as an expression of a
western]{.underline} enlightenment [desire [for
**coherence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**authorization** [and
**control**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such, this [[forms]{.mark} part of
[a modernist]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [**liberal white** control
system]{.underline}]{.mark} [demanding racial harmony]{.underline},
collaboration and understanding (Jones and Jenkins, 2008). So, for
example, the work of Canadian settler-scholars Heather and Catherine
McGregor seems to offer curricular solutions to the absence of
Indigenous knowledges in schools (McGregor and McGregor, 2016). While
their suggestion to invite Inuit Elders into the educational settings of
Nunavut seems to address a visible knowledge gap,
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[enacts]{.mark} the [embedded epistemic
habits and]{.mark} expertise of [the
**settler-state**]{.mark}]{.underline} (in this case, the Canadian
regional government administrator) (Douglas, 2013; McGregor and Marker,
2018). However, [the [selective]{.mark} and momentary [engagement with
Indigenous knowledges]{.mark}]{.underline} and scholarship [[as
'**additional knowledge**']{.mark} that [simply]{.mark} needs to be
integrated into the long list of]{.underline} methods and '[[things to
do]{.underline}']{.mark} of the busy settler-scholar reduces reciprocity
to a redemptive moment (with the emphasis on momentary) that can be
adopted by anybody (in unity). This [[avoids]{.mark} interrogating and
[**unsettling** the logic of reciprocity]{.mark} in
research]{.underline} and teaching relationships, [and [working
to]{.mark}]{.underline} challenge (not adapt) and
[**[undo]{.underline}** (**[not reform]{.underline}**)
[colonial]{.underline}]{.mark} [systems of domination and
[exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Against this background, Indigenous scholars have long argued for [a
fundamental **restructuring** of relations]{.underline} which adds
respect, truth telling and relationality to education (Kuokkanen, 2019).
For history educators and academic researchers, this [means both
**pedagogic unlearning** and 'recognition and intellectual activation of
Indigenous knowledge']{.underline} (Steeves, 2021: 20): listening to,
learning from, citing and working with Indigenous scholarship, while
acknowledging and transforming different types of structural equality
that have and are affecting it. In the world of history education, this
may include decentering yourself and limiting other dominant voices, if
you are in a position to do so. This seems like a first step towards
respecting (not 'including') Indigenous epistemes and other forms of
knowledge on their own terms, and emerging from their own intellectual
environments. 'This sense of relationality to each other, to the past,
and to epistemologies is integral to a cosmopolitanism that reflects and
respects the uniqueness of local environments' (Cutrara, 2018: 266).

Inspired by Paulette Steeves's (2015: 62) notion of
['**pyro-epistemology**']{.underline}, the research approach for this
article aims for [a [**pedagogic 'cleanse'** of current
discourses]{.mark}]{.underline} and scholarly content [on historical
thinking]{.underline}, [[as they]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[include
'discussions that]{.mark} misinform and fu[el
**racism**]{.mark}']{.underline}. [[Having considered the]{.mark} role
of dominant]{.underline}, [**[eurocentric]{.mark}** scholarship [in
the]{.mark}]{.underline} displacement and [[**erasure** of Indigenous
scholarship]{.underline}]{.mark} overall, [I have]{.underline}, for
example, [**[deliberately reduce]{.mark}d** the **[airflow]{.mark}**
available]{.underline} (via referencing) [[to]{.mark} the vast volume of
[**non-Indigenous** literature about Arctic]{.mark} cultures and
histories]{.underline}. This form of [**weeding** or]{.underline}
controlled [[**incineration** of the **cognitive wildfire**]{.mark} that
is western historical writing seems like a productive way to [respond
to]{.mark} working within [the **coloniality** of
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} (Quijano, 2007; Silova et al., 2017).
[It]{.underline} also [informs much of the work done within western
historical practice itself]{.underline}, by historians [[**continuously
questioning** and countering]{.mark} the eurocentric nature of
[western]{.mark} historical [thinking]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rüsen,
2002). Readers keen to point to the lack of engagement with canonical
texts from history education research or Arctic historiography should
look to Eve Tuck's (2009) 'Suspending damage: A letter to communities',
or to Derek Rasmussen's (2002) 'Quallunology: A pedagogy for the
oppressor' to understand this approach.

In order [[to undo embedded practices of **cognitive injustice** and
**erasure**]{.mark} in academic writing]{.underline}, when it comes to
relating to Indigenous scholarship, this article intentionally employs
some simple stylistic tools and referencing methods to 'cultivate a
conscientious citation practice' (Eidinger, 2019). So, for example, the
word 'Indigenous' is always capitalised, while the word 'eurocentric' is
not. No italics or quotation marks are utilised when using non-european
names, concepts or ideas, but italics or quotation marks are employed
when making use of an overused western term or cliché. Indigenous
authors are referred to by their full names, while non-Indigenous
authors are referenced by only surname, initial(s) and date (as applied
in standard academic writing). Indigenous publications historically
credited to a colonial administrator, collector or editor have had their
original authors and/or translators reinstated or added. Multi-authored
publications show non-Indigenous co-authors as second authors. [This
praxis is]{.underline} aimed at [**normalizing** the giving up of
privilege]{.underline} when it comes to relating to (not assimilating)
Indigenous scholarship in academic writing, and it is intentional, if
somewhat playful and experimental. Hopefully, this research approach,
content and style will allow us to think together about how not only to
suspend damage, but also to clear the way 'for healthy growth in
academic fields of thought and centres of knowledge production'
(Steeves, 2021: 20).

Coda: the interconnected nature of the outer ring concepts

The conceptual tools of the CPK framework are interconnected and
collectively build upon each other to establish Equity in research
relationships. Equity is supported through the understanding,
acknowledgment, and utilization of these concepts. We emphasize that
Equity is crucial to this process, but it is not always easy to see how
to achieve it. Our hope is that this framework provides guidance and
tools for those looking to engage in CPK processes.

For example, building a Relationship rooted in [Equity means recognizing
Indigenous]{.underline} Peoples' [Sovereignty]{.underline} and the need
for mutual Trust and Respect between Indigenous partners and
researchers. Engaging in [[**ethical** research
requires]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we must be **Deliberate** and
**Intentional** about]{.mark} the approaches]{.underline},
[**[methods]{.underline}**, [and **ideas**]{.underline}]{.mark} [we are
using]{.underline}. Increasing the Means and Ability of Indigenous
Peoples [related to]{.underline} research,
**[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and decision-making [[requires
Decolonization efforts]{.mark} in]{.underline} the realms of funding,
[research]{.underline} leadership, [and access to decision
makers]{.underline} (among other things). The importance of the
interconnected nature of the conceptual tools, and how they work
together to build equity, becomes clearer when looking at CPK in action
and applied to research.

The action circle (inner ring)

The inner ring or "action circle" of our CPK framework (Fig. 4)
represents different parts of the research process. We challenge the
reader to [[think about research]{.underline}]{.mark} and research
projects [[not as **linear**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}]{.mark}
[rather as]{.underline} cyclical and [[**iterative**
processes]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Research should not be seen
as]{.underline} being simply [conducted **sequentially**]{.underline}.
Rather, [it is [important **during** the]{.mark} research [process to
**continually revisit**]{.mark}]{.underline} both [the conceptual tools
in the **outer** ring as well as]{.underline} the [various actions of
the research process]{.underline}. [Both]{.underline} the [inner and
outer rings of the framework are **intertwined**]{.underline}, with the
components intersecting with each other. For example, at the stage of
analysis it is important to revisit the concepts of Empowerment and
Sovereignty; are these tools being applied to the analysis of results?
Additionally, the team may be [analyzing results]{.underline}, but [may
want to **revisit**]{.underline} the [[**methods** previously agreed
upon to **re-evaluate** if]{.mark} they are [still
appropriate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Each action in the [research]{.mark}
process]{.underline} should build upon work already done and decisions
already made, continue to use the framework components to guide the
process, and [[should]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be **highly
iterative**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in that [the [concepts and
tools]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., **[Equity]{.underline}**) [presented
[in the framework are regularly]{.mark} being [**revisited** and
**(re)implemented** to guide]{.mark} or strengthen the [evolution of a
project]{.mark}]{.underline} or relationship.
