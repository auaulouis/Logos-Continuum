#### [Diplomatic capital]{.underline} is necessary for all scientific ventures

The second form of science diplomacy, which is rarely as dramatic is the
first, is diplomacy for science. Here the help goes the other way. And
[**[it is hard to overstate just how much researchers in almost every
discipline need diplomats]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Thousands of the
world's leading physicists and engineers, for example, would be unable
to undertake high-quality research if dozens of governments had not come
together to build, at a cost of nearly \$5 billion, CERN's particle
accelerator in Geneva (and those scientists certainly would not have
made the Nobel prize­--winning discovery of the Higgs boson). [[Without a
global compact]{.mark} to pool resources, assemble talent, and maintain
high-level diplomatic attention over several decades, ["big science"
projects]{.mark}]{.underline} like this one [[would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} simply [[impossible]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[["Little science" also needs diplomatic help.]{.underline}]{.mark} An
American seismologist studying earthquakes in China must get permits
from Beijing. A British biologist collecting specimens in South America
must win the approval of the appropriate countries. A biomedical team
from a multinational NGO developing a new vaccine for use in Africa must
gain clearance for multi-country trials. [[At every step of the way,
good diplomatic relations between involved countries are
necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}, but more broadly, good diplomats are
needed to get the exchanges approved, facilitate immigration, sponsor
international conferences, and grant visas for faculty and students.

[[The capability to foster global collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}
must not be taken for granted. In the language of this chapter, it
[[requires conscious investment in diplomatic
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}, defined as institutions and norms designed
to foster cross-cultural collaborations. [[This
applies]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
diplomatic relations among countries but to all initiatives that bring
together diverse actors to address global issues. An important example
is [[the work of the global research community]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Researchers have developed norms and protocols that build confidence in
the quality of the new knowledge created by research. New institutions
are being created to engage in transdisciplinary research on issues
affecting the wellbeing of billions of people. The work of the IPCC is
an outstanding example.

Nevertheless, there are stresses evident in global collaborations. This
chapter began by noting the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the
European Union and the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris
Agreement. These events suggest that [[the current stock of diplomatic
capital has been inadequate]{.underline}]{.mark} for meeting some urgent
global challenges connected to sustainable development and climate
change. Stronger institutions and norms will be needed in the future.

#### US presence in the Arctic requires diplomacy and investments with Europe for effective scientific research.

**1AC Schmitt 2020** (Dr. Benjamin L. Schmitt is a postdoctoral fellow
at Harvard University, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy
Analysis, and a former European Energy Security advisor at the US
Department of State. "How critical science infrastructure investments

As [Washington]{.mark} and Brussels look toward next steps in security
and civil infrastructure development and investment across the Arctic,
they [must]{.mark} also reinvest and [**[expand]{.mark}** their
[**permanent scientific infrastructure** presence in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike robust US investments in permanent
scientific research facilities in other remote environments, Washington
has thus far not matched these initiatives with parallel investments in
the Arctic. Compared with the assertive scientific facility investments
made by China in Svalbard and Iceland, the United States still only
operates a handful of research camps across the Arctic. And despite the
growing scientific and strategic importance of the region, the last time
the US government opened a new major research facility in the Arctic was
1989, when it established the National Science Foundation
(NSF)-administered Summit Station, a high-altitude site on the northern
Greenlandic ice sheet.

The United States Arctic Research Commission (USARC), points out that
while the United States continues to support a wide array of [scientific
research activities across the Arctic, these are as yet not supported by
the established of new or expanded permanent
infrastructure]{.underline}. In fact, the [USARC calls for increased
funding of "...demonstration projects to address engineering design of
Arctic infrastructure."]{.underline} This is key: the technical
realities of the design, deployment, and operations of permanent
infrastructure facilities and instrumentation in the polar regions
presents unique technical challenges, ranging from extreme weather
conditions and temperatures to the reality of building and maintaining
permanent structures on constantly evolving ice sheets. Even a task that
would be straightforward in a temperate climate---say, constructing a
small lab building---requires specialized knowhow. For example, such a
structure includes unique engineering requirements, like jacking
mechanisms to allow the structure to be raised to the level of the
accumulated snow grade each year, as well as precise knowledge on snow
packing densities that ensure building footers are well grounded in the
absence of a soil or bedrock anchoring used in standard construction.
Unique challenges like these are found throughout all aspects of the
operations, communications, and logistics supply chains needed to run
Arctic infrastructure. These challenges are indeed encountered at the
limited array of existing US Arctic facilities like Greenland Summit
Station. The site continues apace with science operations, but could be
expanded in a more robust funding environment, and could therefore
support infrastructure for larger-scale transatlantic science
collaboration in the future. Ultimately, Summit Station could be a
facility with increased support and logistical infrastructure at the
level of US facilities in the Antarctic, though current funding levels
have not yet enabled such development. To move forward, [the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Europe]{.mark} should
[continue]{.mark} the longstanding tradition of [leveraging]{.mark} the
significant [**intellectual capital** and **practical
experience**]{.mark} that has been developed during seventy years of
advancing scientific infrastructure in
Antarctica.\*]{.underline}Washington and Brussels should also harness
the enthusiasm of its own science community, as US and European
researchers continue to press for increased access to the Greenlandic
ice sheet. Even with its limitations, resulting research has yielded
important gains for increasing specialized expertise on what will be
needed for a future of increased Greenlandic operations. The deployment
of an expanded Summit Station, in addition to other facilities in the
global far north, is not merely a plea from the US science community.
[The [Greenlandic and Danish governments]{.mark} continue to [call
for]{.mark} Western---specifically **[US]{.mark}**---**[foreign direct
investment]{.mark}** across a variety of sectors [in Greenland]{.mark},
including the deployment of **[research facilities]{.mark}** supported
by improved logistics]{.underline}. [The Danish government identified
such a need for increased science infrastructure in its most recent
Strategy for the Arctic, stating that "...[research]{.mark} and
monitoring [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} puts a [strain]{.mark} on
[resources]{.mark} and logistics and therefore [international
cooperation]{.mark} on such projects [must continue]{.mark} to be
encouraged..."]{.underline}

[An [increased scientific infrastructure]{.mark} presence in the
transatlantic Arctic will [allow]{.mark} [US and European researchers
to]{.mark} [share their intellectual and operational experience]{.mark}
with policymakers and private sector contracting partners. This will in
turn increase transatlantic capacity and practical knowhow on best
practices for deploying and operating large-scale critical
infrastructure in the Arctic across a myriad of other fields central to
mirroring recent strategic moves taken by Russia and China---and at a
price tag far lower than a focus on purely commercial or military
infrastructure investments.]{.underline} Taken together with other
initiatives, this [[multidisciplinary effort will contribute to
transatlantic policy goals to extend US and European physical presence
across the region]{.underline}]{.mark}, and should be a key
consideration as the Biden administration begins to plot and execute its
national security strategy in the coming months and years.

#### Science research is perceived as Western strategy to militarize the region -- raises risk of conflict 

**SZKARŁAT 25** \[Monika SZKARŁAT, a team member co-founding the Center
for Artificial Intelligence and Computational Modeling at the Maria
Curie-Skłodowska University (UMCS). She serves as a delegate to the
Polish Polar Consortium Council, Securitization of scientific
cooperation: The case of the Arctic, Polish Polar Research,
<https://journals.pan.pl/Content/134616/2025-01-PPR-02.pdf>, AM

EU institutions, acting as securitising agents, are undertaking a
securitising move by proposing amendments to existing regulations
concerning research security and the protection of scientific outputs,
including technology, know-how, and research data, in order to adapt
them to recent geopolitical developments. Analysing the speech act
embodied in these normative acts and their drafts reveals a discourse
oriented towards the securitisation of scientific research. These
documents refer to existential threats (in general terms) such as
[international tensions]{.underline}, [increasing vulnerability of
researchers to threats affecting research security]{.underline}, the
rise of strategic competition and power politics, and hybrid threats, to
which the scientific sector is particularly exposed due to its openness
and emphasis on international cooperation: "[Union-based
[researchers]{.mark} and innovators may be [targeted to obtain
state-of-the-art knowledge and tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}, at times
using methods that are deceptive and covert, or through outright theft
or coercion, but [more [often exploiting seemingly bona fide
international academic cooperation]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Council of the
European Union 2024, C 3510[). The [Council]{.mark} also
[highlights]{.mark} significant [risks associated with the use]{.mark}
of [scientific achievement]{.mark}s by undesirable entities]{.underline}
(states and their intelligence services) [[for military
applications]{.mark}.]{.underline} The document further provides
definitions of research security, critical innovation and technology,
and risk appraisal, describing the latter as: "\[...\] [a process
[in]{.mark} relation to [international research]{.mark} and innovation
[cooperation]{.mark} in which [a combination of main risk factors is
taken into consideration]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} (Council of the
European Union 2024, C 3510). In 2024, the European Commission also
published a White Paper on Options for Enhancing Support for Research
and Development in Dual-Use Technologies (European Commission 2024b).
These technologies, considered as sectors, are referent objects that
require specific actions to mitigate the effects generated by the
aforementioned existential threats. [The [objective]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
to [support]{.mark} [research and development in dual-use
technologies]{.mark} at the EU level, referring to software and
technologies that can be [utilised for both civilian and military
purposes]{.mark}.]{.underline} The document once again underscores
efforts to reduce risk and strengthen the EU's economic security. Among
the strategically significant technologies for which risk assessment
procedures have already been implemented are advanced semiconductors,
artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and biotechnologies. A
similar narrative is found in the European Commission's document on
foreign interference in the research and innovation process: "Foreign
interference (FI) occurs when activities are carried out by, or on
behalf of, a foreign statelevel actor, which are coercive, covert,
deceptive, or corrupting and are contrary to the sovereignty, values,
and interests of the European Union (EU)" (European Commission 2022).
The Commission, acting as a securitising actor, defines existential
threats as those originating externally to the system, in this case the
system being the European Research and Innovation Area, posed by third
states and non-state actors. However, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark}
document [[is]{.mark} [significant]{.mark} not only [because of
its]{.mark} security [threat]{.mark} discourse but also due to its
broader aim: to establish a set of recommendations for the scientific
community, enabling it to appropriately adapt to evolving challenges
[and the increasing risks to international
security.]{.mark}]{.underline} It can thus be argued that the referent
object in this case is not only individual technological sectors but
also the broader research, innovation, and international scientific
cooperation sector. The latter category plays a dual role, as the
[scientific community also serves as the audience, i.e., the target of
the securitising move, intended to prompt specific actions by academic
and research institutions]{.underline}. The document outlines concrete
recommendations, such as: (i) enhancing research data security; (ii)
adjusting collaboration frameworks with foreign researchers to mitigate
the risk of undesirable and high-risk incidents; Polish Polar Research
2025; 1: 5--15, doi: 10.24425/ppr.2025.153919 Securitization of
scientific cooperation in the Arctic 9 (iii) developing a Code of
Conduct for Foreign Interference within academic and scientific
institutions; (iv) establishing a Foreign Interference Committee,
responsible for managing research data and intellectual assets in
international collaborations; as well as (v) providing advice and
support to research groups involved.

Science Diplomacy is Not Just for the Good Guys Discussions of science
diplomacy in politics, the media, and academic literature often frame
science diplomacy as premised on good intentions. In this approach,
collaboration is understood as the development of mutual understanding
between nations and science-informed strategic thinking, especially in
building solutions for global challenges. But, [like all frameworks or
tools intended for finding common interest in political relationships,
[science diplomacy]{.mark} can also be [used to amplify business or
state interests, advancing geopolitical interests divorced from the
common good. ]{.mark}]{.underline}We see [[this as malignant science
diplomacy,]{.underline}]{.mark} with varying significance in the Arctic
with its permanent populations and sovereign governance versus the
Antarctic and its suspended claims to sovereignty and management through
the multi-lateral Antarctic Treaty System. Turning to the Antarctic, the
example of emperor penguin protection highlights how geopolitical
interests can block science-informed policy. [[Proposals to
establish]{.mark}]{.underline} marine protected areas
([[MPAs]{.mark})]{.underline} to better safeguard the penguins from the
effects of the climate crisis, pollution, and tourism have [[enjoyed
widespread support]{.mark} from nations]{.underline} active [in
Antarctic governance.]{.underline} However, [[Russian and Chinese
governments have repeatedly opposed them using what experts are calling
"'spurious science']{.mark}]{.underline} and other bad-faith
arguments."8 The Chinese government, in particular, has been criticized
for citing the work of a divisive researcher who questions the impacts
of climate change on polar species.9 [Other nations have announced plans
to implement the MPA proposal "on a national basis" despite China and
Russia's objections.]{.underline}10 [[While]{.mark} this [push to
implement MPAs]{.mark} neatly [fits]{.mark} the [conventional]{.mark}
[understanding]{.mark} [of science diplomacy,]{.mark} its premise on
positive intent]{.underline} (e.g., pro-conservation science diplomacy)
[[poses challenges to the analysis]{.mark} and interpretation [of Russia
and China's opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, elsewhere in the
Arctic, [[econ]{.mark}omic [interests]{.mark} are [driving]{.mark} the
[development]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [exploitation]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
culturally and [environmentally sensitive landscapes]{.mark}, as seen in
renewable energy development and geoengineering.]{.underline}11 These
examples illustrate the [[vulnerability]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[conventional]{.mark} [understandings]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[science]{.mark} [diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[build on
inherently optimistic interpretations]{.mark} of the
framework.]{.underline}12 Outlook With geopolitical tensions in the
polar regions again rising, many see science diplomacy as pointing to
potential avenues for peaceful cooperation. However[, the
[reality]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [science diplomacy in the polar regions
challenges existing conventions regarding what science diplomacy is and
whom it involves]{.mark}.]{.underline} In light of this, we call for an
evolution of the science diplomacy concept that sets out distinctly
defined practices and pivotal actors, considers different systems of
knowledge beyond conventional scientific research, involves Indigenous
knowledge holders in decision-making processes, and does not shy away
from discussing the causes and consequences of malignant science
diplomacy on cooperation in the key focus of polar governance:
environmental protection. We propose that bringing these dimensions into
the framework for science diplomacy will strengthen its use as a tool of
cooperation both among states and across multiple levels of governance.

in the Arctic

The fall of science diplomacy in INTERACT

Since the [Russian invasion of Ukraine, **geopolitical diplomacy** has
**plummeted** in the Arctic. This has **affected major science
initiatives** such as the work of the Arctic Council but also bottom-up
organisations such as INTERACT]{.underline} (Witze, Reference Witze2022;
Rees & Buntgen, Reference Rees and Buntgen2024). The [exclusion of
Russian stations in INTERACT]{.underline} resulted from directives from
the EU funders (and the inability to transfer funds through sanctions),
directives from the operators of some of the stations and personal moral
choices that varied among participants. Consequently, there were some
major top-down and bottom-up constraints, but some individual bottom-up
contacts remain between Russian and non-Russian stations and staff.

Diplomacy for science

Research stations have joined INTERACT at different times and the
stations themselves have been formed at different times. A great asset
of the INTERACT network is that the oldest have been operational for
more than a century and new ones have formed as interest in the Arctic
has grown. INTERACT was instrumental in developing two research stations
in Siberia. [Sadly, against this dynamic, the Russian invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in a **paused collaboration** between
21 Russian stations and INTERACT. Within a few months, INTERACT went
from a pan-arctic network to a network covering only half of the Arctic
land masses. Even if the work continues with all other Arctic countries,
the implications of this pause are numerous and profound.]{.underline}
Science for diplomacy At the environmental level, the majority of
Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic live in Russia, the longest Arctic
coastline (53% of the Arctic coast line), the largest boreal forest and
the greatest Arctic land area are found in Russia. Changes there are
dramatic and are affecting local people through changes in water
supplies (e.g. Bogdanova et al., Reference Bogdanova, Lobanov, Andronov,
Soromotin, Popov, Skalny and Callaghan2023) and food (e.g. Callaghan et
al., Reference Callaghan, Shaduyko, Kirpotin and Gordov2021a), while
carbon emissions from permafrost thaw (e.g. Schuur et al., Reference
Schuur, Abbott, Commane, Ernakovich, Euskirchen, Hugelius and
Turetsky2022) and increasing forest and tundra fires (Kharuk et al.,
Reference Kharuk, Ponomarev, Ivanova, Dvinskaya, Coogan and
Flannigan2021) have the potential to drive geographically wider impacts.
To predict future changes in the Arctic, we need environmental
information from Russia. The pan-arctic transnational access that
developed within INTERACT during the last decade has contributed to
provide important environmental data from Russia. However, the
transnational access scheme is greatly impacted by the paused
collaboration with Russia. Overall, the number of research stations
providing transnational access decreased from 52 to 39 and the
geographical coverage was greatly reduced to cover half of the Arctic.
Before the Russia/Ukraine war, INTERACT brought environmental research
by about 100 Russian researchers into the Western domain (Callaghan et
al., Reference Callaghan, Shaduyko, Kirpotin and Gordov2021a) and
similarly, it brought researchers from the West to the East. This is now
much more difficult, despite publications showing the bias in the West
of even previous research away from the Russian Arctic (Metcalfe et al.,
Reference Metcalfe, Hermans, Ahlstrand, Becker, Berggren, Bjork and
Abdi2018; Virkkala, Abdi, Luoto, & Metcalfe, Reference Virkkala, Abdi,
Luoto and Metcalfe2019; Callaghan, Cazzolla Gatti, & Phoenix, Reference
Callaghan, Cazzolla Gatti and Phoenix2021b) and a study that shows that
the observational power of the INTERACT network of research stations is
greatly reduced by omitting data from Russian stations (López-Blanco et
al., Reference López-Blanco, Topp-Jørgensen, Christensen, Rasch, Skov,
Arndal and Schmidt2024). Science in diplomacy

INTERACT continues to contribute to science in diplomacy in similar way
as it has done during the last decades but representing the decreased
geographical area. There are some concrete examples where the
[work/collaboration has stopped completely. The first is a
community-based environmental monitoring programme on extreme weather
events in Siberia.]{.underline} Another example is the work related to
the Arctic Council's Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic
Scientific Cooperation which was on a long pause as the Arctic Council
work was on pause. INTERACT was supposed to play a major role to inform
about the agreement and encourage the use of it among research stations
in all Arctic countries.

In all three diplomacy types mentioned above, in the past, scientists
have managed to collaborate despite political tensions. The current
interactions between East and West within INTERACT are more challenging
than those that existed during the International Biological Programme
i.e. during the Cold War. During this period, research stations in the
former Soviet Union contributed to data sharing. Workshops were held in
both the West (Heal, Reference Heal1971) and the former Soviet Union
(Wielgolaski & Rosswall, Reference Wielgolaski and Rosswall1972) and
both regions were represented by researchers. Currently, most [Western
institutions cannot collaborate with state-owned Russian
institutions]{.underline} because of constraints by funding agencies,
employers or personal morality. This current [isolation of East and West
is greater than that during the Cold War and after the annexing of
Crimea]{.underline} because the invasion of Ukraine is the largest
European war since Second World War and has global ramifications.
However, collaborations between colleagues continue in some cases. Such
collaborations are regarded as bridges to continue communication for the
time when, hopefully, normality will return.

The bipartisan consensus on shoring up the US position in the

stated bluntly: "I think we recognize that the United States has a lot
of work to do. . . . We have historically a strong position in Asia.
That position has slipped and we are at risk, and [[we need to make
substantial investments]{.underline}]{.mark} across the board." [Much
analysis has focused [on needed improvements to US force posture in the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}, and many proposals are under
discussion. The PDI itself, as well as the DOD's spending plan, have all
received critiques. Nevertheless, the roiling discussion makes clear
that [[current US posture is not]{.mark} considered
[adequate]{.mark}]{.underline}, that major new spending is politically
feasible, and that there are no simple solutions. [[In this context, it

**[with climate change are]{.underline}** by now quite **[well
rehearsed. But how high is the probability that they will]{.underline}**
**[occur? How likely is it that climate change will lead to
more]{.underline}** interstate wars, intrastate **[wars or terrorism?
How much do we]{.underline}** **[know about the links between climate
change and violence?]{.underline}** **[Are these dangers
'real']{.underline}** in the sense of having a high likelihood of
occurring **[or are they largely fictitious]{.underline}**,
edge-of-range possibilities that are **[used to draw attention to
climate change]{.underline}**, a level of attention that would not be
attainable by stressing the more likely, but less spectacular economic
and social consequences of the problem? **[The latter would be
understandable but potentially]{.underline}**
**[counterproductive.]{.underline}** In the literature on
**[securitization it is implied that when a]{.underline}** **[problem is
securitized it is difficult to limit this to an increase]{.underline}**
**[in attention and resources devoted to mitigating the
problem]{.underline}** (Brock 1997, Waever 1995). **[Securitization
regularly leads to all-]{.underline}** **[round 'exceptionalism' in
dealing with the issue as well as to]{.underline}** **[a shift in
institutional localization towards 'security experts']{.underline}**
(Bigot 2006), such as the military and police. **[Methods]{.underline}**
and instruments **[associated with]{.underline}** these
**[security]{.underline}** organizations -- **[such]{.underline}**
**[as]{.underline}** more **[use of arms, force and
violence]{.underline}** -- will gain in importance in the discourse on
'what to do'. A good example of securitization was the period leading to
the Cold War (Guzzini 2004 ). Originally a political conflict over the
organization of societies, in the late 1940s, the East-West
confrontation became an existential conflict that was overwhelmingly
addressed with military means, including the potential annihilation of
humankind. Efforts to alleviate the political conflict were, throughout
most of the Cold War, secondary to improving military capabilities.
**[Climate change could]{.underline}** **[meet a similar
fate]{.underline}**. An essentially political problem concerning the
distribution of the costs of prevention and adaptation and the losses
and gains in income arising from change in the human environment might
be perceived as intractable, **[thus necessitating the build-up of
military and]{.underline}** **[police forces to prevent it from becoming
a major security]{.underline}** **[problem. The portrayal of climate
change as a security problem]{.underline}** **[could,]{.underline}** in
particular, **[cause t]{.underline}**he **[richer countries in the
global]{.underline}** **[North,]{.underline}** which are less affected
by it, **[to strengthen measures]{.underline}** aimed at protecting them
from the spillover of violent conflict from the poorer countries in the
global South that will be most affected by climate change. It could also
be used by major powers as a justification for improving their military
preparedness against the other major powers, thus leading to arms races.
**[This kind of reaction to climate change would be
counterproductive]{.underline}** **[in various ways]{.underline}**.
Firstly, since **[more border protection,]{.underline}** as well as more
**[soldiers and arms]{.underline}**, is expensive, the financial means
to compensate for the negative economic effects of reducing greenhouse
gas emission and adapting to climate change will be reduced. Global
military expenditure is again at the level of the height of the Cold War
in real terms, reaching more than US \$1,200 billion in 2006 or 3.5
percent of global income. While any estimate of the costs of mitigation
(e.g. of restricting global warming to 2°C by 2050) and adaptation are
speculative at the moment, they are likely to be substantial. While
there is no necessary link between higher military expenditures and a
lower willingness to spend on preventing and preparing for climate
change, both policy areas are in competition for scarce resources.
Secondly, the acceptance of the **[security consequences]{.underline}**
of climate change as an intractable problem could **[well reduce
efforts]{.underline}** **[to find peaceful solutions]{.underline}** to
the conflicts that will inevitably come with climate change. Climate
change will have major consequences, particularly in countries where
living conditions are already precarious (IPCC 2007, WBGU 2007). The
consequences of climate change on some basic foundations of life, such
as fresh water supplies, arable land and agricultural productivity in
various parts of the world can already be roughly estimated for various
global-warming scenarios. There are also more or less well founded
predictions of the consequences of reduced availability of natural
resources such as arable land and water on hunger and disease, even
though such consequences are highly dependent on counter-measures and
adaptation efforts in affected regions. There is no inevitability about
these consequences. This is even more the case for violent conflict of
various types. The links between reductions in resource availability and
violent conflict are complex**[. A deterioration in human security--
threats to the 'vital core of life']{.underline}** (Commission on Human
Security 2003, p. 4) **[does not necessarily imply an increase in
violent]{.underline}** **[conflict. To assume the opposite may lead to
the neglect]{.underline}** **[of opportunities for conflict resolution
and the prevention of]{.underline}** **[conflict from turning

### L\-\--Science Securitization

#### Securitization of science hinders scientific judgement 

**Berling 11**(Trine Villumsen Berling currently works as a senior
researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies in
Copenhagen. Trine is the project leader of a Carlsberg Foundation
Research grant on energy infrastructure and the displacement of security
authority in the Baltic Sea Region. "Science and securitization:
Objectivation, the authority of the speaker and mobilization of
scientific facts"

The first cluster of research on **[the relation between science and
securitization concerns facts produced in the natural sciences
concerning issues such as disease or climate change.]{.underline}**9
According to several authors (e.g. Brauch, 2009), **[such facts have
been securitized to varying degrees]{.underline}**. However, given a
strong trend arguing for the lack of hard scientific facts about how,
for example, **[climate change will affect us,]{.underline}** an
important subdiscussion related to this cluster concerns the role of
science in risk management. In other words, **[when hard facts are
absent, a range of risks need to be juggled.]{.underline}** In the
precautionary mode of risk management, according to Aradau and Van
Munster, **[risk management is constructed as working against
catastrophic and irreversible risks of which there is a high degree of
scientific uncertainty]{.underline}** (Aradau and Van Munster, 2007:
103). In political practice however, **[it is argued that lack of
scientific knowledge should not hinder governments from taking
action.]{.underline}** Sovereign decisions (and not democratic
deliberations) are therefore taken 'at the limit of knowledge' (Aradau
and Van Munster, 2007: 106--7; Oels, 2010) **[and may cause drastic
interventions such as shoot-to-kill policies, pre-emptive strikes and
war]{.underline}** (Aradau and Van Munster, 2007: 105). In the words of
Oels (2010: 7), 'even though science fails to deliver conclusive
evidence, the will to knowledge is becoming unlimited' (emphasis added).
**[Science thus seems to be mobilized as failed science, which leads to
a problematic process similar to that described by securitization
theory: the instrumentalization in politics of a lack of knowledge leads
to the legitimization of undemocratic practices in the name of managing
risk.]{.underline}** The second cluster of research includes the work of
Mark Salter, who draws our attention to how different audiences can
receive ('hear') securitizing moves differently. Salter argues that in
the case of the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA),
expert communities challenged a further securitization of airport
security after the initial securitization of civil aviation post 9-11
through a set of desecuritizing moves -- for example, 'a critical
appraisal of the risk management approach' (Salter, 2008: 333). He does
not, **[however]{.underline}**, take a stand on how **[science operates
and is received in society in general, even though he argues that 'if,
as security experts, it is part of our role to intervene in the
securitization/desecuritization process, then we must gain a tactical
knowledge of the conditions for success and failure']{.underline}**
(Salter, 2008: 343). Part of this knowledge concerns how science is
perceived in society, I would argue. Instead of pursuing this line of
reasoning, however, Salter takes the scientific arguments as they were
presented by scientific agents to a scientific audience. Interesting
questions about the role of science and scientific statements in society
thus remain. How does society perceive of science? What weight does a
scientific argument carry? And, can that influence securitization
processes? The third cluster of research on securitization/science is
occupied by what has come to be known as the Paris School. This school
is concerned with how experts engage in the production of truths and
thus help shape the threat environment independently of dramatic
securitizations.10 According to the Paris School, the Copenhagen School
only studies the tip of the iceberg by focusing on exceptional measures.
Instead, **[securitization is seen as a not very spectacular everyday
practice that often involves 'experts']{.underline}**.11 **[This draws
attention to the status and everyday workings of concrete security
experts and constitutes an important insight for securitization
theory.]{.underline}** The fourth cluster of research on
securitization/science concerns the mobilization of scientific facts in
political practice. In a study of the securitization of the democratic
peace thesis, Christian Büger and I (2007) showed how the scientific
'fact' of democratic peace was transformed into a security policy by
both the US government and the security organization NATO after the end
of bipolarity. In a more thoroughly sociological version of this point,
I argue from a Bourdieusian viewpoint that science can be understood as
both a type of practice and a type of capital, with important weight in
specific fields (Villumsen, 2008). As the above overview shows, **[there
has been some attention to the connection between science and
securitization]{.underline}**, but no real debate within securitization
studies (or within security studies more broadly, for that matter) has
materialized**[.]{.underline}** In the following, I will develop the
ideas sketched above, while keeping in mind the important insights from
the contributions to the science/securitization issue.

### L\-\--Pandemic Securitization

#### The securitization of the COVID-19 pandemic shows how securitization of pandemics causes economic decline (genuinely this isn't a good tag pls rewrite it)

**Nunes 20** (João Nunes joined the Department in September 2014. His
research on global health and Brazil's health system has been featured
in the University of York's research pages and is also an impact
case-study. "The COVID-19 pandemic: securitization, neoliberal crisis,
and global vulnerabilization"
https://www.scielo.br/j/csp/a/sng9pd8tLNdY3cQrDChhqPr/?format=pdf&lang=en)

In recent years**[, securitization has become one of the most important
lenses for interpreting global health]{.underline}** 1. Describing a
specific modality of the nexus between health and security, **[this
theory contends that the statute of "threat" results from an
interaction]{.underline}** between an actor that attempts to define a
given issue as an existential threat and an audience that accepts or
rejects this attempt. What distinguishes a **[process of securitization
is the defense of extraordinary measures]{.underline}** -- including the
suspension of (or exceptions to) normal processes of democratic
deliberation **[-- as necessary responses to this existential
threat]{.underline}** 2. This analytical approach has been used to
analyze cases such as SARS, avian flu, Ebola, and Zika, among others
3,4,5. **[COVID-19 confirms the dynamic of securitization of global
health.]{.underline}** The **[pandemic has been framed in the context of
a threat to people's lives and to the regular functioning of societies.
It was not just about the securitization of the disease, which for the
majority of infected individuals is either asymptomatic or shows
moderate symptoms]{.underline}**. However, COVID-19 has a higher
case-fatality rate than influenza A; the incubation period is 1 to 14
days; and it includes community transmission (possibly even during the
asymptomatic period) via droplets from coughs and sneezes, and also via
contact with contaminated surfaces or objects 6,7. Given these
specificities**[, there has in fact been a securitization of the
circulation of persons and social contact -- that is, securitization of
factors that can lead to exponential growth in the number of serious
cases and consequently a collapse in healthcare services.]{.underline}**
In many countries, the response has resulted in a scenario of exception,
with confinement and social distancing policies. **[Emergency
declarations have given additional powers to authorities and have led to
militarization of the response in some countries]{.underline}**. Aside
from a few cases, societies have accepted this state of exception.
**[Securitization of circulation]{.underline}** and contact **[is a
new]{.underline}** fact that this **[crisis]{.underline}** has
**[brought to global health.]{.underline}** Historically, the objective
of global health governance has been to prevent national disease control
measures from excessively affecting the circulation of persons and goods
8. The 2005 International Health Regulations, for example, specify under
which circumstances national governments can impose additional control
measures to those proposed internationally. Health security mechanisms
emerged as part of a liberal worldview that aims to install and maintain
a "triage" between economically necessary circulation (that should be
promoted) and circulation that is harmful to the economy 9 With
COVID-19, and although the restrictions on circulation do not include
goods and information, global health governance has sacrificed a
significant component in the triage, placing severe limits on
economically necessary circulation. The result has been a set of
economic consequences that may exceed the effects of the 2008 financial
crisis. **[Securitization is normally a mechanism for protection of the
economy, but in the case of COVID-19 it has been used for purposes
contrary to the economy. It is no coincidence that in countries like
Brazil the resistance to securitization has been based on the argument
that "the economy cannot stop".]{.underline}** This argument is correct
-- if one takes it as a manifestation of what has been called
"epidemiological neoliberalism" 10. Since the economy is organized in a
neoliberal format, it cannot withstand a suspension of circulation, even
temporary. COVID-19 thus reveals neoliberalism's lack of resilience when
exposed to a global and large-scale shock originating from a
non-economic or non-financial sector. **[The pandemic further
demonstrates neoliberalism's contradictions, demanding circulation even
when such circulation provenly promotes the sickness and death of a
significant contingent of the population. Thus, COVID-19 is not only a
public health crisis, but also a crisis of the neoliberal
model.]{.underline}** Capitalism has been noteworthy in its own
reinvention over the centuries, assimilating criticisms in various
situations in order to strengthen itself 11. A new reinvention is
possible. It is also possible that the illusion will be maintained,
i.e., that neoliberal business-as-usual can be restored. But we do not
have much time. In a situation of climate emergency, with the
increasingly obvious unsustainability of an economic model based on
uninterrupted growth, conspicuous consumption, waste, and the
destruction of biodiversity, the consequences of COVID-19 may actually
before telling the future.

The Arctic is the ancestral home of diverse Indigenous Peoples, where
they have generated knowledge about their territories, encompassing
natural environments and reciprocal relationships. This profound
relationship of Arctic Indigenous Peoples with their ecosystems
emphasises their crucial role in research, which holds the potential to
impact both tangible and intangible elements of the natural world. The
[[history of Arctic]{.mark} regions [is]{.mark} one [of colonisation
by]{.mark} domestic and foreign [government]{.mark}s whose policies and
practises are still felt today.]{.underline} [This, coupled with the
[influx of external researchers, brought unequal power dynamics]{.mark}
between knowledge systems and methodologies, [causing harm to local
people and undermining]{.mark} the quality of [Arctic
research]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous communities and trained
Indigenous researchers continue to lead research
[[today]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, despite notable shifts in
research methodologies[, **[the enduring legacy of colonialism continues
to]{.mark} cast a pervasive [influence]{.mark} over the entire
[research]{.mark} continuum, from idea to conclusions, implementation,
[and policy outcomes]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In this document, we
provide the ICARP IV process with concrete recommendations for actions
that can advance the parity and complementarity of Traditional
Knowledge, Indigenous Knowledge, and academic scientific knowledge in
order to inform the process and lead to better research outcomes for
all. However, this document cannot be used as a universally applicable
one-size-fits-all approach or as rigid, prescriptive guidelines. The
situations of Arctic Indigenous Peoples vary significantly across the
Circumpolar North due to diverse geographical, environmental, and
cultural factors, which influence their distinct challenges, priorities,
lifestyles, and interactions with the changing Arctic environment.
Dialogues and relationship-building are key to ensure ethical and
effective research practices that genuinely serve to uplift the status,
rights, and roles of Arctic Indigenous Peoples. In order to fulfil the
aforementioned commitment, [[Arctic research needs to be]{.mark}
decolonised and Indigenised.]{.underline} Decolonial research translates
to [[**moving away from the typical institutional and researcher-centric
systems** towards genuine equality in]{.mark} planning and
decision-making on [research]{.mark} strategies, processes, and
funding.]{.underline} The inclusion of Indigenous rightsholders at
eye-level in all decision making, planning and funding of Arctic
research, on equal footing with the relevant institutions at the
nation-state level, advances the realisation of Indigenous Peoples right
to self-determination. [[Self determination is the right of Indigenous
Peoples to independently guide research processes]{.mark}, ensuring
alignment [with their values and needs]{.mark}, thereby enhancing the
relevance and impact of research outcomes. [Decolonising research is
crucial for Indigenous self-determination]{.mark}]{.underline} (see:
Example 1). Championing Indigenous Knowledge has also yielded
ground-breaking discoveries (see: Example 2), which would not have
happened without working with Indigenous Knowledge Holders. Some
research inquiries are most aptly addressed by Indigenous communities
themselves. Overall, decolonial research approaches lead to better
science, better knowledge, improved understanding, and better
decision-making results. In light of these considerations, we have
formulated a set of recommendations for the ICARP IV process.

[[Arctic research continues to operate in a colonial
framework]{.underline}]{.mark} and with an academic mindset
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} largely [[privileges the interests of
southern institutions and fails to address Northern societal
needs]{.underline}]{.mark} and issues, in particular those experienced
in Inuit communities. Canada's reconciliation efforts with
[[Indigenous]{.mark}]{.underline} Peoples must extend to Northern
research practices and its governance. We have seen research principles
go from research on Inuit to research with Inuit, but it is high time we
witnessed research by Inuit for Inuit. If research informs policy, and
policy arguably leads to change, Inuit [[need to have a say in how
research]{.underline}]{.mark} in Inuit Nunangat (Inuit homelands) [[is
governed to better their lives]{.underline}]{.mark}. This piece filters
such matters through the eyes of an Inuk, offering insights into current
Arctic research governance, and maps out some of the solutions and
opportunities for altering it in the interests of Inuit communities. I
do so by drawing on my experience in academia in southern Canada.
Setting the context: The credibility gap and research governance I
joined academia out of the conviction that, by understanding the systems
that control our lives as Inuit, I would be able to envision some of the
solutions that might change such systems to better suit our realities.
In my academic life, I have regularly taken the opportunity to research
and write about topics that relate to Inuit, developing important tools
to critique, analyze, and question systemic issues that Inuit face. This
process has not been without tensions and struggles. I reflect here on
some of the tensions and struggles I have experienced when thinking
about and conducting Arctic research, as an Inuk raised in Nunavut and
as a scholar trained in Western traditions. These tensions are
fundamentally rooted in having to deal with what I call the credibility
gap between Western knowledge and Inuit knowledge. I understand this
credibility gap as the view that Inuit (traditional) knowledge does not
have (the same) credibility compared to Western academic knowledge. The
former is assumed to be based on questionable oral tradition, myth, and
story, while the latter is assumed to come from research that collects,
questions, and analyzes evidence in a rigorous manner. Current
governance of Arctic research speaks to this credibility gap and extends
into policy-making in the North. I take research governance to include
how knowledge is perceived, how research is done (i.e. methodology and
ethics), how results are circulated, and, most importantly, how research
is funded, all being interrelated areas in research governance. We
cannot separate these areas from one another, from policy-making, and
from the wider social-cultural and political-economic context in the
Arctic, since they further replicate colonial relations between Inuit
and Canada. QIA training the first four participants in the community

Association The question of knowledge and capacity-building: Policy and
funding implications Knowledge is a powerful agent in research. Research
methodology should refer not only to the methods applied to carry out a
research project, but also to the research assumptions that govern
research. How we consider knowledge and what is worth relying on as
scientific evidence are critical here. Within Arctic research that
involves Inuit, positive changes in research methodology have resulted
in shifts away from ethnographic description towards community-based
research. Research principles have also transitioned from research on
Inuit to research with Inuit. However, we have yet to see a turn to
research by Inuit for Inuit. This is unlikely to happen as long as
research assumptions about what counts as valid knowledge and scientific
evidence remain unchanged ― the credibility gap will also remain in
place, informing key issues like capacity-building. For some, Inuit
knowledge is traditional knowledge. I am not a fan of this term, as too
often traditional is understood as something at the margins of our
modern times. More importantly, in research it has been related to
ensuring community cultural continuity, rather than providing valid
scientific evidence. At best, it is seen as traditional ecological
knowledge (TEK), with a role to supplement and support scientific
knowledge in the area of climate change and animal life, for example, or
to serve in Inuit adaptation to biophysical changes that affect
activities like hunting. In Inuktun, Inuit traditional knowledge is
Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ), which "encompasses all aspects of
traditional Inuit culture, including values, world-view, language,
social organization, knowledge, life skills, perceptions, and
expectations" (Anonymous, 1998: 1, qtd. in Wenzel, 2004: 240). The
literal translation of IQ would be "Inuit way of doing things: the past,
present, and future knowledge, experience and values of Inuit Society"
(Awa & Tapardjuk, 2002: 4). There is a fundamental difference between
the wider Western understanding of traditional knowledge and IQ. The
latter is a dynamic concept, with a whole worldview captured in a word;
it is not a passive notion, but one that focuses on doing, on
perceiving, and on learning as a community, and on the connection
between past, present, and future as key to community and our relation
to nature. The applied and the communal aspects are perhaps the pillars
of IQ: non-hierarchical, a culture of sharing knowledge by sharing
actions, where welcoming and helping represent central societal values.
For some, Inuit knowledge is traditional knowledge. I am not a fan of
this term, as too often traditional is understood as something at the
margins of our modern times. Given the above, I have not come across
many sources within the literature that define TEK or traditional
knowledge in a way that speaks to its scientific value, similar to the
expertise Western researchers develop through formal training. In
whatever way it is defined, it largely lacks the legitimacy (and
credibility) of scientific knowledge. Hunn's definition that "TEK is
knowledge" (Hunn, 1988:14) is closest to the idea that TEK represents a
different, not less, way of knowing. Bravo (2010) calls it "expert
knowledge ― the knowledge of Inuit travellers, hunters, and researchers.
This knowledge is the product of centuries-old practical tradition of
meticulous first-hand study by Indigenous experts" (445). Such a view is
rather an exception in my experience. Research practices overwhelmingly
show a gap in what is deemed scientifically valuable. This credibility
gap between Western knowledge and IQ in turn informs a key issue in
current Arctic research and policy approaches: capacity-building. It
limits how accountability is practised and it disproportionately drives
benefits to southern Canada. Who decides on research and on what counts
as evidence? What is the return to communities? Whose capacity is really
built? How do Inuit even understand capacity-building? These are
questions that help us all, in particular Inuit, understand Arctic
research governance: decisions on research, on funding research, and on
what evidence informs policy are made in southern Canada. Rather than
recognizing the knowledge that already exists within Inuit Nunangat,
such decision-making processes imply that capacity must be built there.
If we want comprehensive, deep research and effective policy, with the
goal to understand and change rather than represent and be complacent in
the status quo, interpretation of data and its validation in
policy-making need to support closing the credibility gap.
Capacity-building, whether through research or through policy, would
then become a two-way street, rather than a unidirectional exercise in
knowledge application. What are the implications for policy-making and
funding? Consider how the federal government works with the notion of
evidence-based decision making. Research assumptions of what counts as
scientific evidence effectively erase important contributions from
Inuit. Consider also how research funding works. Funding research is
about operating within a system that relies on a colonial institutional
framework. That is, research funding depends on the scientific
credibility of knowledge. TEK is only considered quasi-credible and
quasi-legitimate in research if it is presented and engaged with via
education or research institutions. Or, in academic and research
institutions, knowledge is divided into academic disciplines, producing
and reproducing the objectification of the human and natural elements
the Western knowledge system works with. It means that research takes on
this fragmenting view of life, which fundamentally ignores the holistic
Inuit ontology. Because education and research institutions endorse this
disciplinary mode of inquiry, anything different is necessarily less:
Inuit knowledge ranks lower in the hierarchy of knowledge. Yet, as
Wenzel writes, "TEK has formed an important aspect of scientific inquiry
among Inuit far longer than TEK, as a 'research type', has had
intellectual currency" (Wenzel, 1999: 114). We need to move beyond the
treatment of Inuit knowledge as a source of alternative interpretation
that is selected only when it can complement the more established
Western research knowledge. Thinking differently about Arctic research:
Inuit knowledge is science Recent studies on hunting and ice in the
North support the idea that traditional knowledge is scientific
knowledge. It requires understanding of complex physical, biological,
cultural, and economic processes in Inuit Nunangat. These studies also
capture an essential aspect in Inuit thought: the interrelation of the
natural elements with human communities (Krupnik et al., 2010; Gearheard
et al., 2017). As a community member who was raised to think of hunters
as playing a central role in the community, which went beyond
alleviating food insecurity, such studies brought familiar ground to my
otherwise estranged academic life. I finally had the legitimacy of my
Inuit knowledge, and a "credible" base for considering hunters as
scientists who use their research in support of their communities and
who need to be paid as professionals in their own right. Hunters are
Arctic scientists and professors, experienced wildlife, ice, and water
researchers, and environmental knowledge keepers. I have promoted this
idea of hunters as scientists and researchers in my academic engagements
for a while now. Such a view [[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}s
[[Western-based ontologies of science and research]{.underline}]{.mark}:
It draws on Inuit traditional knowledge and applies it to the current
political-economic context of paid labour to bring positive change to
communities, rather than keeping hunters and their knowledge exclusively
in the ecological and cultural domain. If we are serious about
reconciliation, [[decolonizing knowledge is a must, but so is
decolonizing research]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is a need to think
differently about research in the Arctic. Arctic research must ensure
that 1) Inuit knowledge and everyday practices on the land are
recognized as a qualitative mode of inquiry producing scientific
evidence, and 2) Western ethical research and publication standards do
not exclude recognition of Inuit communities (i.e. hunters / harvesters
/ knowledge keepers) as equally valid references. Western research
schools of thought and funding agencies need to open up the concept of
methodology and alter the definition of rigorous knowledge to include
and reward community gatherings, oral communication, on the land
practices, etc. as platforms of knowledge dissemination and academic
validity in the North. Formally trained Arctic researchers have started
to acknowledge the importance of incorporating Inuit knowledge in how
they do research. How does this affect "the methodological and
theoretical approaches to Northern science" (Wenzel, 1999: 115)? I see
closing the gap in knowledge credibility as part of such methodological
and theoretical reformations of Northern science and research
governance. [[We need to move beyond the treatment of Inuit knowledge as
a]{.underline}]{.mark} source of alternative interpretation that is
selected only when it can [[complement]{.mark} the more established
[Western research knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. As an Inuk trained in
the Western scholarly tradition yet raised in Inuit tradition, I want to
see a research paradigm shift where traditional knowledge is considered
as valuable as scientific knowledge. I want to see both Inuit and
Western researchers credibly engage with one another in search of
solutions to local issues. Let us stop naming one "science" and the
other "knowledge." Instead, let us call Inuit knowledge science.
Science, as it is currently defined, privileges itself over Inuit and it
is time Canada changes the Arctic science vernacular towards a
respectful, equally valid worldview. I cannot stress enough "the
importance of harmonizing the practice of southern science in the North
with the sociocultural and practical needs of aboriginal Northerners"
(Wenzel, 1999: 116). Accessibility of Western research knowledge to
Inuit communities is critical for Inuit input into research design
towards practical purposes and positive change in communities. With the
differences in social and economic well-being indicators between Inuit
Nunangat and the rest of Canada, the advancement of knowledge through
Arctic research must necessarily be accompanied by an applied component
that benefits and is accountable to Inuit communities. This must become
the norm in Arctic research governance. Joeffrey Okalik and Murray

up a dirty word: What's the use of research? As an Inuk scholar who
wants to do research for the well-being of my community, I am conflicted
on three levels: 1) that enough research related to Inuit is out there;
2) that research is a "dirty" word among Inuit; and 3) that action to
solve our problems is more important than research. Perhaps the idea I
have struggled with the most is that research is irrelevant to my
people. The "deep [[suspicions]{.mark}]{.underline} about the relevance
of science" and doubt about its "ability to work in the interest of
anybody other than scientists and southern institutions" were
articulated in the literature starting in the 1980s (Kemp & Brooke,
1983: 1). This view among Inuit [[is rooted in old colonial practices
when]{.mark} Inuit and other [Indigenous Peoples were used for
"advancing science" (e.g., nutrition experiments in residential
schools)]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[It is]{.mark} also [reinforced
by ongoing knowledge extraction practices]{.mark}]{.underline}, when
formally-trained researchers and southern institutions benefit from
advancing knowledge related to Inuit on a long-term basis (e.g.,
career-building, attracting funding and students, publishing, etc.),
while Inuit communities may only see short-term benefits (e.g., income
from hiring local research collaborators and participants, creation of a
database, etc.). Rethinking Arctic research can change the state of
affairs mentioned above. If research is how responsible policy is
arguably made, and the way through which southern institutions can be
challenged for their role in maintaining the power status quo, then
Inuit need research and meaningful collaboration. Altering methods to
create space for Inuit voices and knowledge to be heard and documented
in the research process (i.e. what needs to be researched, how to
conduct the research, how to disseminate results) is a necessary step.
Better yet, [[Inuit can do our own research to benefit our
communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Notwithstanding the challenges that I
have expanded on so far, research is becoming more inclusive of Inuit
voices through progressive methods such as community-based participatory
research. However, [[change cannot happen when the insights resulting
from bridging Western knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} and Inuit knowledge
largely [[remain the exclusive domain of southern
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Arctic research harms Indigenous populations by contributing to environmental degradation, disturbing Indigenous traditions, and leading to unrepresentative decisions

Through Indigenous' Perspectives";

Mia: [The [increased presence of]{.mark} scientists and [researchers in
the Arctic can]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance, [[affect local
communities' time resources and cause "fatigue"]{.underline}]{.mark} to
participate in these research actions. However, it can also help raise
local voices via knowledge exchange -- and by doing so affect planning
and decision-making, as well as create job opportunities and economic
benefits through employment, contracting, and collaboration. Moreover,
if not carefully planned with local communities, and without field work
training for researchers, some [[scientific activities can contribute to
environmental degradation or cause disturbances to wildlife or
traditional actions]{.underline}]{.mark} -- such as reindeer roundups.
Researchers must be familiar with the areas, local cultures, and follow
ethical guidelines. Collaboration, respect, and equitable partnerships
are necessary to avoid negative consequences. How is the scientific
community currently integrating local Arctic communities into their
activities? Mia: The scientific community is increasingly recognizing
the importance of integrating local Arctic communities into their
activities to ensure research relevance, ethical conduct, and positive
impacts on the well-being of these communities. Many scientific projects
in the Arctic such as REBOUND now employ a community-based research
approach, where scientists collaborate closely with local communities
for the lifetime of the project. This ensures that research questions,
methodologies, and outcomes are relevant and beneficial to the community
and that the research results have societal and policy impact as
scientists are increasingly engaging with policymakers. Scientists are
increasingly using participatory research methods that involve local
communities in data collection, analysis, and interpretation and involve
preferences of local communities regarding research priorities and
goals. This not only enhances the quality and validity of research
findings, fosters mutual trust, respect, and ownership, but it also
empowers community members to contribute their knowledge and
perspectives to the scientific process. Without inclusive scientific
approaches it is not possible to produce culturally relevant, socially
responsible, and sustainable research outcomes that benefit both the
scientific community and the communities living in the Arctic and
implement just research practices and policies for the changing Arctic.
Henry: The track record is mixed. Overall, I would say that there has
been some progress on paying closer attention to indigenous knowledge.
Our \[researchers\] methods are improving, more is being done, and more
attention is being given to issues like data sovereignty (that is, who
controls the information, rather than just letting scientists do what
they would like with what they learn). One of the challenges is that it
takes time and effort to work in this way, so [there is often an
incentive to take shortcuts or avoid working with Indigenous
communities.]{.underline} For those who take the time and effort,
however, there are many professional and personal rewards from working
closely with others, learning from them, and discovering things we would
never otherwise have thought of. For Arctic communities, these
collaborations can be a chance for their voices to be heard, for their
ideas to be shared, so that the story being told is not one-sided.
[There is]{.underline} still, however, [much progress to be made in
involving Indigenous knowledge holders]{.underline} in the steps beyond
research. [[The information is]{.mark} often [used to make decisions
around issues]{.mark} that are [intertwined with local people's
lives]{.mark}, such as land and resource management, and [those choices
remain]{.mark} largely [in the hands of people who]{.mark} are not from
the Arctic and who [have limited understanding of indigenous knowledge
and ways of life]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Studies that engage with
indigenous knowledge are good, but not an end in themselves. More needs
to be done to respect and enhance sovereignty and self-determination for
Arctic peoples.]{.underline}]{.mark} How does the scientific community
approach the integration of local indigenous communities in their
research in the Arctic, given the historical background of
marginalization, forced sedentarization, and land dispossession? Henry:
The track-record of scientists working with Arctic peoples is variable.
Some scientists have historically worked very effectively and
respectfully with local people. Unfortunately, other [[scientists have
not been so respectful, and that continues]{.underline}]{.mark} all too
often. It is essential to treat everyone with dignity and respect, which
includes educating ourselves about Arctic peoples' history and ways of
life to avoid assumptions and don't ignore the legacy of the past.

Addressing the crises that will define the next decades of life on Earth
requires advancements in the science diplomacy framework that are
well-defined, in touch with geopolitical realities, and will stand the
test of time.1 In this spirit, there is a need to question current
assumptions and generate greater nuance in our understanding of science
diplomacy. For this purpose, we turn to the polar regions. [The Arctic
and Antarctic are defined by the ongoing climate emergency and
geopolitical challenges that bring justice, security, and sustainability
into question.]{.underline} They provide useful illustrations of science
diplomacy in action, as well as an ideal space to explore potential
drawbacks, oversights, and changing assumptions of science diplomacy.
Using examples from the polar region, we highlight three challenges to
our existing understanding of science diplomacy, which include a lack of
conceptualizing the agents of science diplomacy, inadequate
representation of the diversity of knowledge systems, and the assumption
that actors have positive intent, or are good-faith actors, even though
history shows repeated examples of the opposite.

Agents of Science Diplomacy

[Diplomacy is conventionally understood to concern interstate relations
conducted by national governmental representatives. Conceptions of
science diplomacy extend this logic to respective nations' research
communities, though still largely focusing on interactions at the
international level and in the domain of the state. However, we suggest
that the central actor or indicator is missing in the conceptualization
and practices of science diplomacy.]{.underline}

[By examining science diplomacy practices in the polar context, we can
observe a multi-level model of engagement at work, involving
governmental and non-governmental organizations and actors. This can
include sub-national actors influencing political discourse and policy
through the dissemination of science-based publications. Here, we draw
attention to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) influencing Arctic policy
debates by their publication of a factsheet on Arctic oil and gas.2
Other examples include non-governmental organizations leading
initiatives to change policy, blurring the boundaries between science
diplomacy, policy, advocacy, and communication.3]{.underline}

Knowledges for Science Diplomacy

We argue that the label "[science diplomacy" limits the kinds of
knowledge systems that are included in its scope. In the reality of
science diplomacy in the Arctic, a host of other knowledges and research
practices are at work, from Indigenous or Traditional Ecological
Knowledge (TEK) to local knowledge and citizen science. While there is
growing collaboration in research between science and TEK in funded
research projects, and even some major international agreements (such as
the Paris Agreement) that make space for Indigenous knowledge, there is
insufficient recognition and inclusion of recommendations in agreements
that emerge from science diplomacy efforts.]{.underline}

[Not only does the exclusion of other forms of knowledge beyond
traditional forms of science limit the effectiveness of science
diplomacy outcomes, but it also raises questions of structural
injustice4 and challenges for the exercise of Indigenous sovereignty.
Excluding Indigenous knowledge holders from 'science' diplomacy through
labelling conventions or from the co-creation of policy outcomes through
systemic marginalization inherently undermines Indigenous rights and
self-determination.5]{.underline}

Although the processes of inquiry associated with [[Western
sciences]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., observation, measurement, analysis,
and deliberation that ultimately seek to describe what is presumed to be
an already existing world) are not inherently harmful, they [[become
harmful when people assert and wield them as]{.mark} if it were [the
only valid way of viewing the world]{.mark}. This [claim positions
Western sciences as]{.mark} if they were universal, [objective, and
superior to]{.mark} other [(non-Western) sciences]{.mark}]{.underline}
and other knowledge systems and ways of knowing. [[This ethnocentric and
anthropocentric hierarchy of knowledge is upheld]{.mark} not only [by
Western scientists]{.mark} but also by [institutional funding
structures]{.mark} [as well as cultur]{.mark}al commonsense]{.underline}
about which knowledges matter most, and who constitutes a legitimate
knowledge holder. Thus, part of the defensiveness that often arises in
response to the call to confront colonialism may be due in part to the
fact that [[Western-trained scientists have]{.mark} [become accustomed
to the premise]{.mark} and promise [that Western sciences are
exceptional]{.mark},]{.underline} even though this is not always
explicitly named. As a result, when we suggest that Western sciences are
equal to rather than superior to other knowledges, it can feel like a
demotion and even a dismissal, or people might inaccurately assume that
we are suggesting that another knowledge system is actually the superior
one. [[A]{.mark} presumed [hierarchy of knowledges leads to
non-reciprocal cross-epistemic engagements]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Different kinds of dialogue and collaboration might become possible if
we understood knowledges relationally and contextually, rather than
situated within an inherent competition for epistemic privilege.
Understanding that each knowledge has contextual relevance rather than
universal relevance can lead to an appreciation for a plurality of
knowledge systems and to a recognition that different knowledge systems
are indispensable and insufficient[. [Western sciences are]{.mark} also
[harmful when they are use]{.mark}d [as a means to]{.mark} [rationalize,
enable, and extend]{.mark} the [colonization]{.mark} of lands and
peoples]{.underline} (Liboiron 2021a, 2021b). [[Western
sciences]{.underline}]{.mark} are often expected to provide solutions to
social and ecological problems, but they [[are rarely expected to
address how they]{.mark} have [contributed to creating]{.mark} those
[problems]{.mark} in the first place.]{.underline} Because [[Western
sciences]{.underline}]{.mark} are positioned as exceptional, objective,
and apolitical, they [[are often not perceived to be accountable]{.mark}
for their social and ecological impacts]{.underline}---indeed, in many
cases, these impacts are not acknowledged (Liboiron 2021b). Thus, in
addition to inviting people to consider the politics of which and whose
knowledges are the most institutionally and socially valued, we also
invite people to consider another dimension of the politics of
knowledge, which is a central consideration of many Indigenous knowledge
systems: the extent to which a knowledge system generates knowledge that
either enables or precludes the flourishing and well-being of current
and future generations of humans and other-than-human beings. While we
recognize the risks of critiquing Western science in a moment when it is
under attack from anti-intellectual forces, we emphasize that our
approach is in no way aligned with these attacks, and that even in this
complex and challenging context, it remains the responsibility of those
trained in [[Western sciences]{.mark} to try and interrupt how their
fields have been and [continue to be complicit in colonial
harm.]{.mark}]{.underline} In fact, we invite Western-trained scientists
to consider that scholars of colonialism might see it as
anti-intellectual to deny [Western sciences' complicity in
colonialism,]{.underline} given that there is extensive evidence to
support this (Prescod-Weinstein 2020).

#### The Plan's Epistemology Reinforces The Colonial Uses of Western Science

2\. The link between science and colonialism [[Throughout the colonial
period, science was strongly linked to the expansion of European
empires]{.underline}]{.mark}. From the very beginning of this period,
when European explorers were first venturing into the wider world,
science was present in the fields of navigation, astronomy, and in the
development of new instruments. The long voyages necessitated more
advanced navigational procedures, and so the scientists who journeyed
with the explorers of the early colonial period had to refine their
technology to make accurate astronomical observations and more accurate
maps, Adas (2016). Adas describes how science was conducted both pre and
post industrial revolution. Before the industrial revolution, scientists
in the colonies were more concerned with natural history: collecting
botanical samples, mapmaking and cartography, and classifying different
species of wildlife. However, [after the industrial
revolution]{.underline}, the [focus shifted to fields]{.underline} such
as geology, mineralogy, chemistry, and engineering, fields [which
delivered more concrete benefits to the colonial powers]{.underline}.
Harrison (2005) concurs, saying that [[colonialism was vital to the
development of]{.mark} such fields]{.underline}. 2.1. [[Science as a
tool of empire]{.mark} Many [scientific advancements were borne out of
colonialism.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, in the field of
[[transportation]{.underline},]{.mark} the development of steamboats
came from the need to navigate inland rivers in Africa, and early
[aircraft [were]{.mark} [used to surveille and attack rebellions
in]{.mark} some [colonies,]{.mark}]{.underline} Roy (2014), and the
development of railways in the 19th century allowed faster inland travel
and created a closer link between the colonies and the Western powers,
Jedwab et al (2017). In communications, setting up telegraph lines was
vital to ensure messages could be sent over large distances and during
the Boer wars, the need for rapid communications that were hard to
intercept found its realisation in wireless radio, Roy (2014). In
medicine, the desire to reduce the spread and lethality of tropical
diseases encountered in the colonies meant that many advancements were
made in a short period of time Brown (2004). And in engineering, the
creation of newer, [more [lethal weapons]{.mark} was [necessary to allow
more lands to be conquered]{.mark} and more people to be brought under
imperial rule,]{.underline} Bocetta (2017). However, it was not just
that colonialism benefited science. Although the domination of European
powers opened up new areas of research and provided insights into new
fields of study, [[the]{.mark} main [driving force]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}behind the science conducted in this era [[was]{.mark} the fact
[that science could be used to aid in]{.mark} this [imperialist
expansion.]{.mark} [It gave European nations an advantage over
cultures]{.mark} which they were attempting to bring under
control,]{.underline} Adas (2016), and Arnold (2006) referred to
[[different fields of science as 'tools of empire']{.underline}.]{.mark}
[[Research]{.underline}]{.mark} into cartography [was]{.underline}
motivated by the need for an intimate knowledge of the local geography
[to [ensure that imperial troops could push further
inland,]{.mark}]{.underline} and advancement in the treatment of
tropical diseases was brought about not because of any goodwill towards
the people under colonial rule, but to protect the soldiers and agents
of colonialism from ill health, Roy (2014). In fact, the main focus of
[[science in]{.mark} the [colonies was to identify and extract natural
resources]{.mark} to further the imperialist ideal]{.underline},
Harrison (2005), and Alam (1977) describes this as 'production science',
which is the idea that any scientific research conducted in colonised
areas was done purely to generate profit and provide natural resources
to fuel the empire's industrial needs. Adas (2016) details how fields
such as botany and geology were primarily used to inform the colonists
about the natural resources a colony contained and the best way to
extract them. Figure 2. "In the coming century, the success of
imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope"-Sir
Ronald Ross, a British doctor who worked extensively in Southeast Asia.
This shows that this attitude was widespread at the time, and not just
an observation by historians. Image obtained from en.wikipedia.org.
[[Colonial science could not have been]{.mark} as [successful]{.mark} an
endeavor [if not for the indigenous populations.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Adas (2016) describes how crucial the native populations were in helping
European explorers gather samples, in particular botanical specimens,
finding elusive wildlife and collecting geological samples. Arnold
(2006) describes the help of Indian native as 'indispensable', although
these [[natives were rarely credited for their
work.]{.underline}]{.mark} This shows the culture of exploitation upon
which colonial science was founded, and that although
[[science]{.underline}]{.mark} at that time [[is seen as a]{.mark}
[European achievement]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} it would not have
been possible without the help of indigenous people[. [Science
was]{.mark} also [used as a tool to control the local
population]{.mark}.]{.underline} Harrison (2005) described how the
knowledge of local geography allowed indigenous people to be grouped
into areas that were tied to race, and thus allowed the colonists to
implement social control, and how careful urban planning allowed for
greater control over the populace. Arnold (2000) is in agreement and
explains how [[science was used to]{.mark} gain a deeper understanding
of the indigenous population and subsequently to [control]{.mark}
them.]{.underline} In his book "Colonising the body" (1999), Arnold also
describes how the attempts to control outbreaks of diseases like
smallpox and cholera led to the colonial government implementing social
controls on their subjects, by constricting their movements and even
their diets. Adas (2016) talks about the use of science to influence non
colonised leaders. In places like China and Japan, even though there was
no imperial presence, the British empire still attempted to influence
local politics and affairs to suit itself. [[Science allowed colonial
powers to impress and gain access to leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} in
Asia, and in this way, these countries could be brought more under the
control of the empire, without being formally colonised. Furthermore, in
colonies with a large population of non European natives, access to
scientific knowledge was made extremely difficult out of concerns over
security and economic competition in the future, Adas (2016). In other
circumstances, scientific and technological expertise was limited to the
European elite, with [colonised subjects being denied education in
emerging fields]{.underline}, Harrison (2005), fields which would prove
critical in the modern world. 2.2. The death of indigenous science [The
arrival of European science to other areas of the world had massively
detrimental effects on local scientific knowledge and
expertise]{.underline}. The influx of [[European
scientists,]{.mark}]{.underline} combined with the utter
[[disregard]{.underline}]{.mark} for [[any indigenous
epistemologies]{.underline}]{.mark} resulted in a decline in native
scientific progress, Emeagwali (2008). The scientific domination of
Europe over the colonies resulted in indigenous science being seen as
redundant, and no effort was made to keep local scientific traditions
alive, Alam (1977). In some cases, there were even active attempts to
smother local industry. For example in Africa, the continent was
saturated with cheap materials from Europe, which resulted in the
decline of local production of glass and metal, Emeagwali (2008).
Another factor to consider is that any science carried out in the
colonies usually took the form of fieldwork, with colonial scientists
less involved with research and more with gathering information,
Harrison (2005). And specimens or data were shipped back to Europe where
the actual analysis and publication of research was done and made
available to the European scientific community through scientific
societies, Adas (2016). This division between data gathering and
scientific analysis created a dependence of the colonies on the European
power in terms of scientific development, Villafuerte (2020). The lack
of scientific institutions in the colonies meant that they needed to
rely on their European coloniser for scientific funding and direction,
and it starved these colonised countries of any scientific development
that they could call their own. The implementation of Western science
and the near extinction of indigenous science allowed colonists to use
scientific education to impose their beliefs on certain groups of
indigenous people, Emeagwali (2008), and this led to the creation of a
social class of native people who shared the imperial ideology and thus
could help further the colonial agenda, Pomeranz (2005).

Science, meaning the Western tradition of testing hypotheses and writing
research papers---has its roots in the Enlightenment of 17th and 18th
century Europe. [When this new way to understand the natural world
emerged, colonialism was already well established, with a handful of
nations in Western Europe exerting political and economic control over
distant lands and peoples]{.underline}. Eventually, just eight nations
claimed more than half the globe The colonizers enslaved millions and
wrung precious metals, spices, and other wealth from colonies. They also
extracted specimens that form the foundation of much of modern biology.
The rich natural history collections in London and Paris were born of
empire[. Charles Darwin's revolutionary ideas about evolution sprang
from travel aboard the HMS Beagle, a voyage intended to survey South
America's coast to further British interests. ]{.underline}

**[The scientific enterprise both fueled, and was fueled by, the
colonial one]{.underline}**. For example, 19th century European
scientists isolated the antimalarial compound quinine from the bark of
the cinchona tree, building on what local people in Peru already knew
about its medicinal properties. Europeans then used quinine to boost the
health of colonial troops.

Today, the smudged fingerprints of colonization still linger on the
scientific enterprise. The lingua franca of research is English[. **Top
scientists**---those with the most cited papers---**disproportionately
work in former colonizing nations or in a few former colonies including
the United States**.]{.underline} For decades, [researchers have
benefited from dropping in on former colonies to study their flora,
fauna, and sometimes people, often with little involvement by local
scientists and little credit to their work]{.underline} or intellectual
property. Such "parachute science" is still with us: In 2019, for
example, a study found that fewer than half of papers on infectious
diseases in Africa had an African first author. Many paleontology papers
from the past 34 years have no authors at all from the nations where
fossils were unearthed[. The nomenclature is rife with names from a
racist colonial past, and even recently bestowed names
disproportionately honor people from the Global North.]{.underline}

In 1938, shortly after the Supreme Court recognized Indian ownership of
subsoil resources in treaty and reservation lands,27 [the Indian Mineral
Leasing Act (IMLA) was **enacted to provide tribes with greater
control** over leasing processes for mining and oil and gas and to
increase their revenues]{.underline}.28 The Act requires consent of the
tribal council and approval of the Secretary of the Interior for ten
year mining leases on reservations. In 1982, the Indian Mineral
Development Act (IMDA) (Melcher Act) was enacted enabling tribes to act
as mineral developers on the basis [that "Tribal autonomy and
self-determination certainly should include the right to negotiate terms
of contracts like any owner of valuable resources"]{.underline}. 29
However, it is only in recent years that tribes have developed the legal
and institutional capacity necessary to assert these rights and to
negotiate fair agreements or block unwanted mining developments on
tribal lands, which total some 48 million acres across the US.[30
Indeed, challenges remain for tribes to fully implement FPIC within
their reservations in accordance with their own customary laws and
practices and their right to self-determination]{.underline}, with
creative approaches being developed by tribes to this end.31 [**The
consent requirement** under the IMLA **does not, however, apply to the
vast traditional off-reservation territories that are now classified as
Federal or public lands.**]{.underline} [The dispossession of tribes of
these lands was based **on "cession" in the form of land-surrender
treaties** entered into under duress,]{.underline} conquest in the
context of the "Indian wars", or what effectively amounted to the
application of the principle of terra nullius in the context of nomadic
tribes. 32 [**This was compounded by the confiscation of lands** and
extinguishment of Indian title by Congress under the plenary powers
doctrine. These lands **taken without consent total over 628 million
acres**, almost a third of the US landmass, and contain most of the
areas of historical, cultural, religious or spiritual significance for
Indian tribes. 33]{.underline} As discussed below, under the extant
legislative, regulatory and judicial frameworks[, a duty to hold
meaningful consultations, **without an explicit associated duty to
accommodate or obtain consent**, applies in relation to extractive
industry projects in these lands that impact on the rights of Indian
tribes.]{.underline}34

use tools in their daily lives. Chimps use twigs to fish for termites;
sea otters break open shellfish on rocks they selected; octopi carry
coconut shell halves to later use as shelters. But the latest discovery
has taken this assessment to new heights---literally. A team of
researchers led by Mark Bonta and Robert Gosford in northern Australia
has documented kites and falcons, colloquially termed "firehawks,"
[[intentionally carrying burning sticks to spread
fire]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.2993/0278-0771-37.4.700). While it
has long been known that birds will take advantage of natural fires that
cause insects, rodents and reptiles to flee and thus increase feeding
opportunities, that they would intercede to spread fire to unburned
locales is astounding. It's thus no surprise that this study has
[[attracted great
attention]{.underline}](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/01/wildfires-birds-animals-australia/)
as it adds intentionality and planning to the repertoire of non-human
use of tools. Previous accounts of avian use of fire have been dismissed
or at least viewed with some skepticism. But while new to Western
science, the behaviors of the nighthawks have long been known to the
Alawa, MalakMalak, Jawoyn and other Indigenous peoples of northern
Australia whose ancestors occupied their lands for tens of thousands of
years. Unlike most scientific studies, Bonta and Gosford's team
foregrounded their research in traditional Indigenous ecological
knowledge. They also note that local awareness of the behavior of the
firehawks is ingrained within some of their ceremonial practices,
beliefs and creation accounts**.**[The worldwide attention given to the
firehawks article provides an opportunity to explore the **[double
standard]{.mark}** that **[exists concerning the acceptance of
Traditional Knowledge by]{.mark} practitioners of [Western
science]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}Traditional Knowledge ranges
from medicinal properties of plants and insights into the value of
biological diversity to caribou migration patterns and the effects of
intentional burning of the landscape to manage particular resources.
Today, it's become a highly valued source of information for
archaeologists, ecologists, biologists, ethnobotanists, climatologists
and others. For example, some climatology studies have incorporated
*Qaujimajatuqangit* (Inuit traditional knowledge) to explain changes in
sea ice conditions observed over many generations.**[Yet
[despite]{.mark} the [wide acknowledgement of]{.mark} their demonstrated
[value,]{.mark} many [scientists continue to have]{.mark} had an [uneasy
alliance with Traditional Knowledge and Indigenous oral
histories.]{.mark} On the one hand, [these types of knowledge are valued
when they support]{.mark} or supplements [archaeological, or other
scientific evidence. But]{.mark} when the situation is reversed---[when
Traditional Knowledge is seen to challenge scientific "truths ---then
its]{.mark} utility is [questioned or dismissed as myth.]{.mark} Science
is promoted as objective, quantifiable, and the foundation for "real"
knowledge creation or evaluation while [Traditional Knowledge may be
seen as]{.mark} anecdotal, [imprecise and unfamiliar]{.mark} in
form]{.underline}**. Are Indigenous and Western systems of knowledge
categorically antithetical? Or do they offer multiple points of entry
into knowledge of the world, past and present? There are many cases
where science and history are catching up with what Indigenous peoples
have long known. For instance, in the past two decades, archaeologists
and environmental scientists working in coastal British Columbia have
come to recognize evidence of mariculture---the intentional management
of marine resources---that pre-dates European settlement. Over the
course of thousands of years, the ancestors of the Kwakwaka\'wakw and
other Indigenous groups there created and maintained what have become
known as "clam gardens"---rock-walled, terrace-like constructions that
provide ideal habit for butter clams and other edible shellfish. To the
Kwakwaka\'wakw, these were known as *loxiwey*, according to [[Clan Chief
Adam Dick (*Kwaxsistalla*) who has shared this term and his knowledge of
the practice with
researchers]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10745-015-9743-3). As
marine ecologist [[Amy Groesbeck and colleagues have
demonstrated]{.underline}](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091235),
these structures increase shellfish productivity and resource security
significantly. This resource management strategy reflects a
sophisticated body of ecological understanding and practice that
predates modern management systems by millennia. **[These
[published]{.mark} research [studies]{.mark} now [prove]{.mark} that
[Indigenous communities knew about mariculture for generations---but
Western scientists never asked them about it
before.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Once tangible remains were detected, it
was clear mariculture management was in use for thousands of years.
There is a move underway by various Indigenous communities in the region
to restore and recreate clam gardens and put them back into use. A
second example demonstrates how Indigenous oral histories correct
inaccurate or incomplete historical accounts. There are significant
differences between Lakota and Cheyenne accounts of what transpired at
the Battle of Greasy Grass (Little Big Horn) in 1876, and the historical
accounts that appeared soon after the battle by white commentators. The
Lakota and Cheyenne can be considered more objective than white accounts
of the battle that are tainted by Eurocentric bias. The [[ledger
drawings of Red
Horse]{.underline}](https://news.stanford.edu/features/2016/red-horse/),
a Minneconjou Sioux participant in the battle, record precise details
such as trooper's uniforms, the location of wounds on horses, and the
distribution of Indian and white casualties. In 1984, a fire at the
battleground revealed military artifacts and human remains that prompted
archaeological excavations. **[What this work revealed was a new, more
accurate history of the battle that validated many elements of the
Native American oral histories and accompanying pictographs and drawings
of the events. However, [without]{.mark} the [archaeological
evidence,]{.mark} many [historians]{.mark} gave [limited credence
to]{.mark} the [accounts obtained from]{.mark} the [participating Native
American warriors.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Hypotheses incorporating
traditional knowledge-based information can lead the way toward
unanticipated insights]{.underline}**. The travels of
[[Glooscap]{.underline}](http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/fp/fpz2f21e.shtml),
a major figure in Abenaki oral history and worldview, are found
throughout the Mi\'kmaw homeland of the Maritime provinces of eastern
Canada. As a Transformer, Glooscap [[created many landscape
features]{.underline}](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/glooscap/).
[[Anthropologist Trudy Sable (Saint Mary's
University)]{.underline}](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/saint-mary-s-university-director-indigenous-education-1.3634926)
has noted a significant degree of correlation between places named in
Mi\'kmaw legends and oral histories and recorded archaeological sites.
As ways of knowing, Western and Indigenous Knowledge share several
important and fundamental attributes. Both are constantly verified
through repetition and verification, inference and prediction, empirical
observations and recognition of pattern events. **[While some actions
leave no physical evidence (e.g. clam cultivation), and some experiments
can't be replicated (e.g. cold fusion), [in]{.mark} the case of
[Indigenous knowledge, the absence of "empirical evidence" can be
damning in terms of wider acceptance.]{.mark} Some [types of Indigenous
knowledge]{.mark}, however, simply [fall outside the realm of prior
Western understanding.]{.mark} In contrast to Western knowledge, which
tends to be text-based, reductionist, hierarchical and dependent on
categorization (putting things into categories), Indigenous science does
not strive for a universal set of explanations but is particularistic in
orientation and often contextual.]{.underline}** This can be a boon to
Western science: hypotheses incorporating traditional knowledge-based
information can lead the way toward unanticipated insights.There are
partnerships developing worldwide with Indigenous knowledge holders and
Western scientists working together. This includes Traditional
Ecological Knowledge informing government policies on resource
management in some instances. **[But [it is]{.mark} nonetheless
[problematic when their knowledge, which has been dismissed for so long
by so many, becomes a valuable data set or used selectively by academics
and others]{.mark}]{.underline}**.To return to the firehawks example,
one way to look at this is that the scientists confirmed what the
Indigenous peoples have long known about the birds' use of fire. Or we
can say that the Western scientists finally caught up with Traditional
Knowledge after several thousand years.
